Written expressly for CHAS. RErmoND and GEORGIE BLAKE by 
C. 
R
., DOCKSTADER, and sung by them with great success 
at all the principal theatres. 
Far over the sea from the Emerald Isle, 
Just twenty years ago, 
We sailed one day from Dublic bay--
Ets Ireland we came from, Na-ho ! 
They called us greenhorns when we came, 
But that's in days gone by, 
Now I'll wager there's not a 
couple can dance 
Like my old 
man 
I. and I. 
woman 
CHORUS. 
For I'm forty-one next Friday week, 
And he's just forty-two, Na-ho! 
Sure a 
jollier couple you never have met 
Than Mr. and Mrs. McGrew. 
On the street when we meet the girls and the boys, 
They shout, Hey there, how de do ? 
Oh, don't they look neat from their head to their feet, 
Look at Mr. and Mrs. McGrew! 
We've a 
boy and a 
girl that wears elegant clothes, 
At the theatre now they're engaged, 
And there's holes in the floor and no lock on the door 
Since the two of them vent on the stage. 
For I'm forty-one, & c. 
Li
Written by Thos. DEvENNv, and sung by CIIAS. REDMOND and 
GEORGIE BLAKE. 
Two policemen brave are we— 
That we're Irish you can see— 
We have been out here about five years or so. 
We had influence, of course, 
For to get upon the force, 
And bet that you will never find us slow. 
CHORUS. 
With our badges, clubs, and belts 
We will make our pressure felt 
As we promenade around upon our beat. 
Ton can bet every cent you've got, 
That we will make it hot 
For every little boy upon the street. 
When we're on a 
few years more 
We will leave Columbia's shore, 
And from Erin's land we never more will roam. 
And with our little pile 
We will put on lots of style, 
And be happy in our little Irish home. 
With our badges. & c. 
Jolly Irish Pair. 
Written by CHAS. REDMOND, and sung with great success by CHAS. 
REDMOND and Miss GEORGIE BLAKE. 
We are a 
jolly Irish pair, 
We're full of life and glee, 
Singing, dancing all day long. 
No matter where we be. 
Go where we will, we can't keep still 
We feel so light and gay, 
Where'er we are you're sure to find 
We drive dull care away. 
CHORUS. 
We can sing and dance all day and never tire, 
Our style the boys and girls do all admire. 
Our singing is so pleasing, 
And our dancing is so neat, 
Just watch us now and we'll show you how 
This pair can use their feet. 
We came from Connemara, 
In the little Emerald Isle, 
That's where we learned to sing and dance 
In the real old Irish style. 
We attended every raffle, 
Every dance and every fair 
Where there was fun, you may be sure 
You'd always find us there. 
We can sing and dance, 8.:c. 
The Dandy Senators. 
Written by CHARLES REDMOND. 
Oh here we are two dandy senators, 
As you all can plainly see. 
To sing and dance is our delight— 
No trouble we ever see. 
We learned to dance in Alabama, 
Where we used to pick the cotton and the corn, 
And with our banjos on our arms 
We'd amuse ourselves till morn. 
CHORUS. 
We're as lively as two fleas— 
We can sing and dance, just give us a 
chance. 
'We're as happy as can be. 
Now please give us your attention 
And listen to what we have to say, 
We'll try our best to please you, 
, 
For it makes us feel 0. K. 
Now we're going away to leave you, 
And we will bid you all good night, 
We hope cur song has pleased you, 
For it fills us with delight; 
And if you come some other evening, 
We'll be happy to see 
All your smilingraces— 
It will fill us full of glee. 
We're as lively, & c. 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE. 
We're an Irish pair and we just landed, 
We came across the deep blue sea, 
And now we're here we're going to tell you 
What we will do in America. 
We'll sing a 
dance like many others, 
Let troubles come, go where we may, 
We'll borrow none, our hearts are cheerful ; 
We're always gay on St. Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We'll go home again, we'll go home again, 
So farewell friends, we'll go home again. ( Repeat.) 
So now kind friends we're going to leave you, 
We're going back where we were born— 
That dear old spot that we call Ireland, 
The climate there is always warm. 
When we get there, kind friends will greet us 
With loving hearts and welcome hands, 
So farewell friends, we now must leave you, 
We're going back to old Ireland. 
We'll go home again, &c. 
Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
Composed by J
AS. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by CHAS. 
REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE, at Miner's New York Theatre. 
We are a 
gay laboring pair, 
And we have a 
beautiful daughter 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to 
We thought that she fancied the stage, 
So we greeted her final request, 
And now she's a 
gay ballet dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarthy, 
She comes home at night and from matinees 
With large baskets of flowers and little bouquets— 
Oh she is our only daughter, 
And her father's the man that taught her. 
She wears spangled clothes, goes round on her toes, 
The pride of the ballet is Biddy. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
So I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
So I 
took the old lady along, 
And in the parquet I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance 
Our son Danny was up the tier, 
And he cried out ' Go in, sister Biddy," 
And they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage she is, &c. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by JAS. MAAS, author of" Dancing in the Sunlight" and 
" 
Golden Showers " and other popular songs, expressly for 
CHARLES REDMOND and CEoRoiE BLAKE. 
In waking hours thy smiling face I 
see, 
And when I 
sleep I'm dreaming still of thee ; 
Thou art the star that guides me on my way, 
Sunlight gleams, sparkling streams dashing silver spray. 
Naught with you can compare, 
Pretty Lucy! 
Charming Lucy I 
Like a 
bird that's in the air, 
Pretty Lucy mine. 
For in you I 
place my trust, 
For you're as good as Diamond Dust. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh if the time were only here to-day, 
As your my own I'd carry you away. 
Buds and blossoms now are all aglow, 
Down the tide ripples glide, singing as they go. 
Naught with you, & c. 
Fair the roses, pale the daffodil, 
Droops the willow bending by the rill, 
Opening flowers blushing by the lea, 
Sweet sunlight, eyes are bright, sparkling love from me. 
Naught with you, & c.

The Greenhorns. 
Happy Irish Pair. 
As sung with immense success by CHAS. REDIMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE. 
In dear old Ireland we were born— 
Sure that was many years ago— 
And raised up in sweet Monahan, 
That's where we were born, Na-ha-ho! 
We came across in the Dreadnaught, 
From friends we had to part, 
And it caused us both to weep and wail 
When we left the old dart. 
CHORUS. 
We are two Irish Greenhorns, 
'Twas hard for us to part, 
Sure it caused us both to weep and wail 
When we left the old dart. 
Oh the morning the ship left Liverpool dock, 
Our poor mother did say, 
God bless you my darling children, 
You're going to America; 
You're going to cross the ocean— 
Sure we thought of it on the spot, 
And we often sit down and bless the day 
That we left the old dart. 
We are two Irish Greenhorns, &c. 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGE BLAKE by Tiros. 
D EVENNY, and sung by them with great success at 
all the Western Theatres. 
Oh here we are an Irish pair! 
Happy, jolly, happy Irish pair, 
And from Ireland we came— 
That's where we gained our name. 
Oh, how we love to sing and dance 
To pass away the time when'er we get a 
chance., 
We came over here from Padd 's 
land 
To see the sights so grand. 
CHORUS. 
Listen to the music, hark !—(Break) 
Makes us lively as a 
lark !—( Break) 
Just give us your attention for a 
while, 
To try and amuse you we'll do the best we can, 
Just watch the easy graceful style 
By this pair from Paddy's land. 
When we were in that happy isle, 
Where the boys and the girls are free from care, 
The moments we often did beguile 
To dance the merry hours away. 
No matter whether rambling on the green 
Or in our cabins so elegant and clean, 
Our hearts were ever free from care, 
We attended every Donnybrook Fair. 
Listen to the music, &c.

Petticoat Gov'ment. 
Written by J. S. 
BETBEZE. 
Dedicated to BILLY COURTWRIGHT. 
Romans, fellow-galloots, and citizens of the Third \\yard ! 
Lend me thine auricular appendage, not that I 
charge ye as 
deaf, but that you may hear me. 
Give me—oh-oh, what are 
you giving us ? 
Before I 
deliver my incendiary lecture, 
allow me to assure you that I 
do not advocate the blooming 
principles of the Slamnoodle Gang. I 
do not thrust my 
remorseless " mug " upon you for the purpose of slandering 
the fair name of wo-man ! I 
love that name. 
I 
wish I 
was 
a 
fascinating dark-eyed widow. 
In some instance I 
may be 
rather over- zealous than circumspect in my remarks—but 
d-o-n-t 
you- forget- it, I'm paid to do so, in U. S. lawful crisp, 
aggregating to the tune of Four Hundred dollars. 
I 
speak, 
on this memorable occasion, for the gratification of Slamnood-
lers. 
Recollect, I'm a 
susceptible tow-headed old rooster, 
married, y- o- u 
bet, end a 
father of an extensive family, but of 
healthy voracity. 
Mutual friends— martyrs of the petticoat 
government ! I was feloniously kidnapped by a 
ferocious 
committee of 13 bald-headed members of the Slamnood!e 
Bamboozled Henpecked Duplex Big Boston Gang, and 
requested to so condescend, as to allow my beaming counte-
nance to shine, with eloquence, upon you. 
I 
refused to beam, 
but now, being your prisoner, apparently so, I 
see no alter-
native but to acquiesce to your dictation, and diffuse my 
opalescent luminosity. 
Fellow snoozers, solid muldhoons of the Slamnoodle B. II 
D. B. B. Gang! As I 
stand unblushingly sober before you in 
this ancient shang-hei perforated duster, permit me to—I 
must 
venture to say, from the glacial period—before ice cream was 
discovered and patented without a 
trade-mark—Yes, time 
immemorial, the astounding questions has been propounded 
and expounded, and pounded to infinity, as to who or what is 
—woman. ( Lecturer advances to foot-lights) Now, before I 
proceed further to dissect this dangerous subject, I 
solemnly 
It

request you, gentlemen, that if you see an old - pot- marked, 
one- eyed dam-se, with brass-rimmed goggles perched on her 
arched proboscis, and an antediluvian " sunberrelah" 
in 
hand, and making her way towards me with hostile demon-
stration — obstruct her way ! she's my great great mother-in-
law's oldest sister, and presidentess of the notorious Grand 
Council, 9, Boston Rights and Liberty Old Maid's Association 
—organized for the purpose of prevention of cruelty to— 
hence, you all can appreciate the, my— the situation. 
Wo-o-man ! Who is she ? What in thunder do we know 
about her ? 
I'll venture to bet five copies of Secretary 
Evarts' 48 hours go- as-you-please letters addressed to John 
Bull on the fishery question, that this question embarrass you! 
It does not to me. 
I 
can explain this question, but to hazard 
such a 
gigantic matter, would absorb all my life time. 
I 
can 
thrash the air in three different back and forward ummersets, 
and claw the air by 16 double-back. action, 7

site-motions, semi- rectangle, hyperbold-and-trapeziummed " on 
the fly;" also, am as long-winded, all at the same time, as 
Brother TALMAGE I But I'll dodge this task, and leave it to 
" 
Hurricane TAL." 
To please the Slamnoodlers I 
select one 
of my million of lectures on woman : " Petticoat Gov'ment." 
Woman, we know, is, as the vulgar hath it, of the " shemale 
tribe," 
and I muss say, 
most emphatically, 
that 
she is 
a 
most subtle, persuasive creature. 
Yes, my fellow-beings. a 
true woman is a 
daisy. 
Woman ! oh- oh, woman ! 
For a 
good woman I'd chew rags or undulate in a 
big sea of 
" 
Elephant Johnny's" rot-gut, paralyzing, shoot-around- the 
corner, nitric red hot whiskey, or- r-a—but where vill you find 
her among you, my fellow Slamnoodlers? ' Sdeath ! Look 
t'ye! 
Catch me not I 
catch ye quick—what are you giving us? 
—taffy on a 
wire? Well, v-e- r-y 
well ! 
Look at woman's 
ingenuity ! Is she not the great traditional originator of hash, 
and solid shot cod- fish balls ? 
C-e-r-t-ainly ? But don't you 
forget it, she's the first in a 
gossip ; first to put a 
clothes-pin 
over your nose, when you snore ; first to trifle with your heart; 
14 
first to study phrenology on you, with a 
full hand; first in 
fashion, first to hang the latest Parisian hat on her left ear; 
first to be as unreliable as a 
French clock ; first to introduce us 
to the switch ; first to give us castor— I 
solemnly appeal to 
the battle- scarred bald-headed American roosf.er, that proud 
strutting, magestic bird of liberty— there I 
am again. 
I 
for-
got that I was to elucidate, with moderation, upon the 
responsibilities of our happiness. 
Well, to take another fresh 
hold of the turkey, by the nape o'the neck, I 
muss say we 
must make some exceptions, of course, we have some who are 
just as uncertain as trying to tickle—with a 
nutmeg-grater—an 
unsuspicious, but capricious, mule's hind hoof without making 
him laugh from ear to ear. 
But, let us put on the spectacles 
of inquisitiveness, and gaze back, and pierce through the cob-
webs of the period of time gone by: There's Anna Dick, 
Kate, Mari—no insinuation as to their respective ven—youth-
ful age—Dr. Mari and other britcherloonerticks or suspender-
loonertics, it won't do to allow them to hold the reins of 
government ! They must remain in their female sphere—wash, 
scrub, boil coffee, and expand soft-shelled doughnuts, and-a-
ain't I 
right ? Of course I 
am. 
You say that your wife proved 
to be a 
delusion and a 
snare ? 
If you my fellow-sufferers are 
situated as I 
am, I 
say, ' tis true, y-e- s, ' tis true ! I 
have been 
successfully married IS, w- e- 1-1 
remem-m-bered, years ago. 
I 
have twent—nineteen daughters and—let me spontaneously 
arise ; 
while the tocsin or victory sounds. 
Let me not 
explode with orthodox eloquence—well, 
I be blowed ! I 
thought I 
was giving my Fourth of July oration, well it's 
enough to upset any one to meddle with anything pertaining 
to—even a hair pin will create a first-class riot, in two 
seconds, in the house. 
Well, love is like chicken feathers, 
stuck to a 
bar of soft soap, and—stuck again! Oh I'm bound to 
wade out to- night, and I'm going through this subject just as 
zealously as a 
bobtailed " dorg " with a 
tin pan tied to his hind 
leg flying around the corner. 
Can you tell me, why in the 
name of all that's wonderful in Mrs. Gaine's strawberry blond 
wig, don't woman get bald-headed? 
No, of course not! 
Now — gentlemen, please stop throwing peanuts at me— 
another staggerer is this. 
The daisies—sweet sixteens—sixtys, 
I mean, have the check of a 
petrified Kentucky Giant to 
regard matrimony for the future, as limited to 36 months, that 
15 
matrimony is— to educate and " paddle waxy" juvenility, the 
hope and pride of our country; study phrenology— to the very 
roots ; nocturnal debates—classic curtain lectures, of course ; 
and-a, and ultimately, divorce looming up. 
This is an astound-
ing revelation, and knocks the spots out of aspiring would-be 
Benedicts. 
Cast your eyes to the time of mother Eve; she 
eat most of the apples—two quarts I 
believe—but don't she 
liquidate the debt now by giving us a 
pair ? Certainly! I 
know 
something about that, at least my—Yet, with all this, I 
think 
we are too harsh, let us be more lenient. 
Woman must have 
some recreation in life—periodically. 
What of it, 
if she 
amuses herself, once in a 
while, by tapping you over the head 
with a 
substantial and healthy frying pan, dat's her natural 
proclivity. 
Ef she at dead of night—when cock-roaches hold 
high carnival— ventures to make an inventory of your pocket-
book; or, crow-bar in hand, waits longingly for you, when you 
stagger in at two in the morning, succumb to your fate, grin 
and bear it. 
But if your wife or mother-in-law, or her sister 
and her cousins, or aunts, have the unmalleable cheek of the 
agent selling " Grants Travel Around the World on 15 cents," 
a-hum! yes, if she has the coolness to manipulate and sing 
till midnight—when the proud chanticleer croweth—yes, over 
a 
rusty, cranky, consumptive pie-an-nah, that clatters like a 
cart load of gin bottles, empty of course—with 9,999 empty oil 
cans and tin cups, running away with a yellow cock-eyed, 
blind, hairless stubby tailed-jee-whoa ! mule, d'dont stand' the 
racket ! Raise the yellow- fever flag on the piano ! Small- pox 
flag on the chicken house ! Put a 
ton of Limburger cheese in 
her Saratoga lightning-roded trunk! Put—let man be lord of 
his castle. 
Put—(commotion R. of parquet.) Gentlemen, from 
the alarming appearance of that conglomerated mass of ladies, 
to the right, I 
must say that my mother-in-law has " arriv," 
(Puts white beaver on, clutches umbrella ; on the defence.) 
and all are In secret caucus. 
I 
must postpone this lecture. 
I 
must place myself in ambush to save my scalp (flourish

Them so far away from thee. 
Mine the only right to gather 
All their sweetness full and free, 
So, while parted, I 
would rather 
Have you keep each kiss for me 
CHORUS. 
Little •Nveetlips, keep your kisses, 
Keep them ey'ry one for me, 
Till my heart no longer misses 
All their sweetness full and free. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
It wiil not be very long;

Of the kisses kept for me. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses,

Po Not Leave Me, Darling. 
Written and composed by Win. J. Scanlon. 
You say you're going to leave me, love 
Farewell if we must part; 
To see my darling go from me, 
I 
know twill break my heart. 
God knows I 
loved you better than life, 
For what is life to me 
When you are gone and I'm alone, 
A poor outcast I'll be. 
CHORUS. 
Do not leave me, darling, 
Do not leave me here, 
We've happy been, we'll happy be, 
So do not leave me here. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
fail to see your face, 
My heart will ache with pain, 
From mine eyes the tears will drop 
Like the heavy falling rain. 
And when you cease to thing of those 
Whose love for you did burn, 
There will come a 
day that you'll repent, 
Then to me you'll return. 
(Chorus.) 
Sung with immense success by the DUNCAN SISTERS, at TONY 
PASTOR'S Theater, New York. 
'TWAS in the summer time, when the sun was low, 
Sinking in the west with a 
golden glow ; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
We wandered together in the dim twilight, 
Lovingly together in the summer night; 
Nor thought we then of time's quick flight, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
'Twas sad when the parting time was nigh, 
When we whispered many a 
fond good- by, 
And a 
little tear trembled in a 
bright sky, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
And many a 
time we've been since then 
To meet, my darling love again; 
And ne'er was I 
so happy in my life as when 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
Down in the meadows, etc, 
Sung by the FRENCH TNYni SISTERS. 
Composed by W M. A. 
H UNTLEY, and sung by the W HITINGS—CHARLES 
and ANNIE. 
Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the silver waters softly glide, 
Making sweetest music in the mellow gleam 
Of the sunbeams dancing on the tide. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer day, 
While the leaflets nodding up above 
Are the only ones that list to what we say, 
As we whisper o'er our tale of love. 
CHORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low, 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies, some one says to rrlig 
Oh, I 
love you better than my life •, 
Some one softly answers—in the days tc be 
May I 
hope to win you for my wife? 
Many solemn vows are whispered there and thtt., 
Many words are spoken soft and low; 
'Tis the same old story whispered o'er again, 
New to us as in the long ago. 
Down among the daisies, 8,:c 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Nought shall ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the golden glimmer of our dream. 
Joys may come and go, like flowers that droop and die. 
But as long as life shall brightly gleam, 
We will cling together, darling, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the daisies, &c.

One summers morn while wandering, 
Down through the fields so green, 
Where the hawthorn blossoms sweetly blow, 
I 
meet Alice Aleen. 
So flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of bonny blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through and through, 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers, (Sym). 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Sym.) 
It's then I 
love to roam with her, my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, my sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady grove far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
falling crystal stream, 
Oh what a 
blissful hour. 
'Twas there she whispered, " I 
am thine," 
In tones so lovingly; 
Then murmered low, " When we are wed, 
How happy, dearest, we will be." 
-When ro-iy May, & c. 
Written expressly for, and sung by the MURDOCHS. 
Don't talk to me of kings and earls, 
Wearing crowns and coronets, 
The men who snub our boys and girls, 
But never pay their debts; 
But give me those who work and strive, 
To gain success at last, 
The man who labors hard to thrive, 
And never lives too fast. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheer him on! cheer him on! 
The laboring man for me, 
Cheer him on l 
cheer him on l 
The man of honesty; 
Cheer him on 1 
help him on! 
The free-born man of toil, 
The laboring man for me, boys, 
The honor to our soil. 
Givt him a 
place among the great, 
With those whose names are stainless, 
He'd be a 
blessing to the State, 
flow he'd bounce the brainless! 
Their hands are rough their hearts are pure, 
They're down on tyranny, 
The man I'd like, though he be poor, 
The laboring man for me. 
Then cheer him on, etc.

I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Engaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears, 
With my loving, languishing look. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing in the ballet, 
The beautiful Parisian ballet, 
I 
was the queen, La belle Pauline, 
Dancing in the ballet. 
My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh my, 
That's warbled in Tip-per-rare- e. 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so swt, 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
Now I'm forced to make shirts for the supers J 
meek 
Considered by all en 
Dancing in the ballet, &C.. 
I 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
in slow movements my Lovers, its there I 
exeell, 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
Was thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and sig1e., 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
TP, the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
13ecause I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, kc. 
When standing amidst the coryphees there, 
I 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Paria, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold; 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
filimply because I 
am old.

In India, or China, or in South Carolina, 
He always came home to tea.

WALKING IN THE SNOW. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As performed wina great success by H ARPER & STANSH.L. 
ONE afternoon in Winter, when the snow was falling fast, 
In turning down a 
by street there a 
maid I 
chanced to pass; 
Her cheeks they looked quite ruddy, at least I 
thought them so 
I 
turned around and spoke to her, while walking in the snow. 
CHORUS. 
Walking in the snow, boys, not going very fast, 
I 
found it very pleasant, and the time so quickly passed. 
I 
love this hale darling, I'd have you all to know, 
ne'er forget the day I 
met her, while walking in the snow. 
A 
year and more we courted. without having any strife, 
I 
asked this darling creature if she would be my wife. 
She said to me, my dearest, anon I'll let you know, 
But if I 
do, I'll ne'er forget, our walking in the snow. 
Walking in the snow, Jzr.

WyATT,

Dear one, speak to me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Make me sad whene'er we meet. 
Do not leave me now in scorn, 
Is my pure love all in vain ? 
Are those vows false that were sworn? 
Darling, love me once again. 
CHORUS. 
Dear one, speak to me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Darling, speak to me again. 
Darling, in thy tender heart 
Dost some fond love still abide? 
Dear, one, say not we must part, 
Let me still be near thy side. 
Has it all been but a 
dream ? 
Say not yes, and give me pain; 
Let some fond hope o'er me gleam, 
Darling, love me once again. 
Dear one, speak, &c. 
Dear one, do come back to me, 
Say, oh! say you'll love me still; 
Then you'll my poor heart relieve, 
And my hopes of pleasure fill. 
Then will dark clouds pass away, 
Bearing with them all my pain, 
Night to me will then be day, 
Darling, love me once again.

Allow me to See you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Cornique, New York. 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can ; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude: 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes !" 
And often decidedly " no ;" 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way, 
I 
then think what fools we men are! 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, &c. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
beautiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt want anything more. 
SPOREN.—Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No answer, so I 
raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
but— 
Allow me to see you home, &c.

While we're here cast your eyes upon us;

We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a

We beat Signor Flyn and Mons. McGin

Where'er he went ' twas his intent 
To be a

And left it off in winter, in case it should turn warm. 
He never rode in coach or cab, for fear the horses kicked ; 
He always sewed his pockets up to stop their being picked. 
lie was a 
careful man, & c. 
He always eat quite sparingly, for fear that he'd get stout, 
And had his bed made on the floor, for fear that he'd fall out; 
He never knew the time of day—it may appear a 
silly thing_ 
And he never would wind up his watch, in case he'd break 
the spring. 
He was a 
careful man, &c. 
You'd never see him smoke at all, neither day nor night, 
For fear while puffing his cigar he set himself alight •, 
Fie never goes to balls or parties anywhere in town, 
Because one night by chance he slipped and pulled his part-
ner down. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He rarely lived in one place long—his nature was to roam— 
At last 1 went to Brooklyn, and has since made that his 
home ; 
He joined a 
local vestry, which pleased his friends so much 
They soon induced him to become the parson of their church. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He preached on every topic, and it was his constant aim 
To astonish his congregation and earn himself a 
name. 
Now, not long since he thought he'd go and see New York 
by night, 
So he took two detectives along with him to show him all the 
sights. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He saw so much of loveliness, and of beauty frail but fair, 
And a 
handsome young creature made love to him—a 
blonde 
with golden hair; 
But for fear that he'd be led astray he went down upon his 
knees 
Beside this lovely damsel, and—began to say his prayers! 
For he was a 
careful man, &c.

I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass ; 
A reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, & c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you can 
To earn a

Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor,

To gain that knowledge let him labor,

And when you meet an erring one 
Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast the stone, 
If you yourself be pure and faultics: .

Where my father was king. 
It's of dear old Ireland, 
Where the shamrock grows green, 
And the boys and the girls, sure, 
Are the bravest ever seen.

For I'm singing and dancing 
From morning ' till night, 
I'm a

And full of delight. 
The girls, the dear creatures, 
Do all of them swear 
They're in love with Prince Patrick,; 
The pride of Kildare. 
You've heard of my fathers, 
In days that are passed, 
'Were famous for fighting, 
And never were surpassed. 
And I'm their descendant, 
And this you'll agree, 
For a 
true Irish prince, 
Plaise behold one in me.

ONE in this bright world to me is fair, 
Voice like an angel and dark flowing hair. 
Sweetly does life givc moments of bliss, 
Sealing our love with an angelic kiss. 
Swiftly the moments are passing away, 
Quickly the dawn of life is turning gray ; 
But every moment, as life is growing old, 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
CHORUS. 
Better than gold with sweet thoughts I 
love thee, 
Nothing can ever unfold, 
Better than gold with feelings untold; 
Darling, I 
love you far better than gold. 
When your dark eyes are beaming in mine. 
Firing my heart like the nectar of wine, 
Thou art ever the same unto me, 
Filling my bosom with love's ecstacy, 
Wafting my soul to the realms of the blest, 
Passing and leaving love's wild unrest; 
Then if you love me why treat me so cold ? 
Whom my heart praises far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc. 
Would you still love, through trouble and woe ? 
Follow my footsteps wherever I 
go? 
Ever to thee my poor heart will cling, 
Loving and trusting whatever may bring. 
Let ill betide or lay at thy door, 
Still I 
will love thee the same evermore. 
the sweet secrets my heart can unfold 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold.

As you can plainly see, 
I

To support my family. 
I 
left my dear old native land, 
Oh, yes, that dear ould sod, 
And its here I 
am in America, 
Carrying the hod.

No sooner than I in to the top, 
Than then I'm down below. 
My frienus th y

No matter where I 
trod, 
That there's not a 
man in this whole wide world 
Can bate me carrying the hod. 
At night when I 
am through my work, 
Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a

My children do also, 
It's take a 
chair and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn gut 
From carrying the hod,

When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I

Pull away, pull away. 
I 
left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
For the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
(Repeat.) 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
For the wind must blow, &c.

I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp of Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured " Shamrock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green. 
CHORUS. 
My blessings on those emblems 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
CHORUS. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
Because that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those, etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair; 
Green threads of father's jacket, 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
My father kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea, 
And bade me wear those emblems, 
"For mother dear and me." 
My blessings on those, etc.

We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer ; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear.

And in that time there's nothing wrong 
Transpired in our cot. 
We've had our share of sunshine, 
And of course we can't complain; 
Them good old days that's passed and gone, 
Can never come back again.

In a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said: 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, &c. 
Published by permission of GEO. Mourisux, Brooklyn, 
I've got the sweetest charmer that ever you chanc'd to know, 
She's just my style and fancy, and plays on the piano; 
Her voice it is soprano, her brother his name is Dan, 
She's very high ton'd, I 
assure you, is my darling Sarah Ann. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, 
My peach, and my currant jam; 
My lolly pop, my gum-drop, 
My darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's the sweetest dancer that ever a 
toe could shake, 
You ought to see her features when tackling a 
sirloin steak; 
Her French is most exquisite, ' twould puzzle a 
real French-
man, 
She talks like a 
big dictionary, does my darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, &c. 
She wears a 
train and flounces, a 
hat with a 
feather, too ; 
There's nothing mean about her—she wears an eleven shoe. 
I 
take her home, each evening, a 
stew in a 
little can ; 
She calls me her duckie and dearie, does my darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, &c. 
Her eyes they look so charming, with such a 
decided squint, 
Her father's very wealthy, I 
hear he is worth a 
mint. 
Whenever I 
try to kiss her, she always s.ries out, " Go an ;" 
I've popped! and I'm going to be married to my darling 
Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, & c. 
As sung with great success by TONY M URPHY. 
Farewell false girl, I 
leave you 
in sorrow, tears and pain, 
My absence need not grieve you, 
Soon you'll bear another's name. 
I'm forsaken for another 
One who has gold in store, 
Farewell, old father and mother, ( Repeat) 
I'm forsaken, because I'm poor. " 
We loved in early childhood, 
And vowed to never part, 
Spent many hour in the wild wood, 
But now you've broke my heart. 
There came one day a 
stranger 
From a 
foreign shore, 
He woed and soon he won her (Repeat) 
From me, for I 
was poor. 
When wed the bells were chiming, 
The carriages rolled by, 
The lads and lassies spieling, 
But a 
tear dimmed in her eye. 
Farewell, false girl, the ocean 
Shall part us evermore, 
I 
loved her with devotion, 
I 
was despised, for I 
was poor. 
Written by CHAS. DocicsrAnaa for FANNIE BEANE and CHAS. GILDAY. 
We are an Irish couple, and 
We came here from Tyrone; 
It's many a 
year since we came here, 
In a 
ship across the foam. 
For it's twenty years ago, friends, since 
We landed on your shore, 
And we left behind friends good and kind, 
And them we'll see no more. 
CHORUS. 
The ups and downs of life we've seen, 
The dark days and the bright; 
With poverty we've struggled hard, 
At last our hearts grew light. 
For Dame Fortune smiled upon us, 
And lent us a 
helping hand; 
Sure we blessed the day we came away 
From dear old Ireland. 
We have children two to cheer our lives, 
And make our old hearts glad; 
Sure you should see the girl we have, 
And the handsome fine big lad. 
For a 
blessing they have been to us, 
And happy is our home; 
You should call and see, when you have the time, 
The couple from old Tyrone.

Winter twilight fades away, 
Darker grows the shadows, 
Sweetly falls the sun's last ray, 
On the distant meadows; 
Seated close by Harry Vane, 
Watching days' declining, 
Faces pressed against the pane, 
For each other pining, 
Cnonus. 
Courting in the twilight, 
Courting in the park; 
Neither one can equal, 
Courting in the dark. 
Mother turns the lamp up bright, 
And to rest retires, 
But I 
think it isn't right, 
Gently dim it's fires; 
Soon it burns with fainter ray, 
Dimmer still and dimmer, 
But for fear of what " they say," 
There's the slightest glimmer. 
(Chorus). 
Mother shakes her wise old head 
-With a 
merry meaning, 
When on rising from her bed, 
She, the lamp is cleaning ; 
But I 
vow my handsome beau 
Left at half Past seven, 
Mother fancies, doesn't know, 
It was near eleven.

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
-Rut now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc.

LIFE is full of toil and trouble ; 
Care and sorrow hover near; 
Gloomy thoughts by day oppress us, 
All our nights are pass'd in fear. 
Still a 
brighter day is coming, 
But tow'rd earth our heads are bow'd, 
And we cannot see the sunlight, 
Hid, just now, behind a 
cloud. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Ne'er despair, tho' life seem weary, 
All the bitter cup must quaff ; 
Weeping will not mend the matter. 
Better far at care to laugh. 
Life's a 
farce in which your acting. 
Should be careless, gay and proud, 
Like to his who sees the sunlight, 
E'en tho' hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate, etc. 
Laugh with scorn an 
d 
defiance 
To the ills that life can bring; 
Trouble flees when met undaunted, 
Grief is robbed of half its sting. 
Firmly stand, erect and manly, 
Bend not like the pliant crowd, 
Light will beam in time upon you, 
Litho' now hid behind a 
cloud.

Owen Slattery, 
Written by DAVID DILLON, and sung with great success by JOHN SHED. 
HAN, in the greatest of all Irish sketches, entitled 
" 
THE ASH BOX INSPECTOR." 
My name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made, 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife. I 
wish she was dead; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stand3 on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughte Kate Ann 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
When asked his name lie said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
Me fine laddie buck," says I, " March out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear." 
He made a 'rush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and flannel-mouth Mick. 
' ...' earanouns," says I, " Ellen, don't give me a 
guy." 
I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal, 
lie ash box inspector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain and a 
scented boquet, 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It .was only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear. 
Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. M ACKLEY and sung by HENRY GRAHAM. 
51 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his band in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
t; 
And they hung that,rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
fn the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _ rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it wr,s played on the stage. 
FROM SLIGO. 
Written by Dockstater, expressly for Miss FLORA MOORE. 
Oh! how do you do kind people, 
I 
am glad to see you all, 
I 
just came here from Ireland, 
In a 
ship from Tara's Hall, 
Sure I 
left my friend behind me, 
'Twas hard for us to part, 
For when I 
left it grieved me sore, 
I 
thought 'twould break my heart. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
left Sligo, sweet Sligo, and if you ever should go 
To Lantrom, or Dandtrom, or any other part 
Of Ireland. ( 1(1 Ireland, among her hills and mireland, 
Ycu'll see them dancing jigs and reels at home in the old dart. 
Oh there is capers cut in Ireland, 
'Twould make you laugh to see, 
For the girls and boys have loads of fun, 
In Sligo I 
tell ye, 
Sure in my dreams I 
see them. 
And when I 
wake my heart 
Seems longing for the happy times, 
I 
had in the old dart. 
CHORUS. 
I'm going back to Sligo. sweet Sligo, and if you ever should go 
To Lantrom or Dandtrom, or any other part 
Of Ireland, old Ireland. among her hills and mireland. 
You'll see them dancing jigs aud reels at home in the old dart. 
Floating with the Tide. 
Sung by Miss BEANE with great success. 
This life is but a 
river, 
And it's hard to stem the tide, 
But while you're floating down the stream 
How merrily you glide ! 
Behind you leaving sorrow, and 
Before you life's bright side 
Is shimmering in prospective, while 
You're floating with the tide. 
CHORUS. 
Floating with the tide, boys, 
Floating with the tide, 
You're leaving sorrow far behind, 
As merrily you glide ; 
Floating with the tide, boys, 
Floating with the tide, 
This life is but a 
pleasure, while 
You're floating with the tide. 
If you should meet the rapids. 
And they're growing fast and fl.trong. 
Don't weaken ; keep a 
steady head ; 
Don't turn that rudder wrong. 
Remember those prophetic words 
By Davy Crockett said : 
"Be sartin sure that you are right 
And then go straight ahead." 
Floating wit;i the tide, 8te.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Original. 
Written and composed by BILLY MAYO, and originalll /an by 
M AYO and BASH. 
H E. 
Life is full of memories sweet, 
And every day some girls we meet 
That with coquettish glance of eye, 
Or, perhaps a 
loving sigh, 
Will cause our hearts to palpitate, 
Yes, such has been .my fate. 
I 
first met Susie at a 
country dance, (Break.) 
One glance did my soul entrance, ( Break.) 
Little hands and waist so neat, 
Oh, gently tripping fairy feet ! 
Oh, how I 
loved each merry glance 
Of my Susie at the country dance! 
SHE. 
Oh, dear, how can I 
ever tell 
You of that dear darling swell 
That at a 
country ball I 
met, 
His style and air I 
can't forget 
For with one shy and loving look, 
From me my beating heart he took. 
He said, 
Dear miss, you waltz divine, (Break.) 
Yes, skill and grace you both combine ;" ( Break.) 
His eyes so blue, and dress so neat, 
Oh, oh 
his figure tall and little feet 
I'll not forget, for I 
loved each glance 
Of my swell at the country dance. (Dance.) 
H E. 
SIIE.

SHE.

(Dance.) 
I 
do declare, what shall I 
do, 
That looks like my dear charmer, Sue. 
Oh, stop, my heart, your beatings tell 
The one that's looking is my swell. 
I 
hope, dear Sue, I'm welcome here, 
My heart, in answer, says yes, dear. 
Oh, ain't this happiness, my boys I (Break.) 
Earth can have no greater joys ! (Break.) 
Just see those eyes, and twig those feet. 
See that figure tall and dress so neat. 
Oh. how I 
love each merry glance 
Of my swell at the country dance!

Just to Please the Boys. 
Composed by Wm. A. HUNTLEY, and sang by ELLA M AYO. 
Some people have peculiar ways, and I 
have some, I 
know, 
I 
don't like swell society, restraint I 
cannot go; 
I've done and will do as I 
please, keep still or make a 
noise, 
I 
love to please the ladies, but prefer to please the boys. 
SPOREN.-0h, well, ladies never appear perfect in each 
other's eyes; there's always some little fault, whether caused 
by envy, jealousy, or otherwise. 
So, on this occasion I 
waive 
female opinion and intend— 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys; 
I 
always meant, with good intent, 
To try and please the boys. 
I 
love to sing, to sail, and race, I 
love to skate and dance, 
And love all social parties where they give a 
girl a 
chance; 
My lady friends find fault because they cannot share my joys, 
And tell me I'm too forward when I 
try to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, whenever I 
try to entertain a 
gentleman, I 
hear such exclamations as these; "Ain't she awful?" " How 
exceedingly fresh !" " She will never catch a sensible hus-
band." 
And all this because I 
try— 
Just to please the boys, & c. 
Some people call me fickle, just because I 
change my beau, 
And don't keep one man to myself, and let all others go; 
Now that, I 
think, would be unkind, for no one more enjoys 
To give good-looking men a 
chance, and try and please the 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—Lord! I'm not fickle. 
I 
do like one man. The 
other evening a 
gentleman kissed me just because I 
let him. 
He repeated the act, and then wanted an encore. 
I 
refused. 
He said, " Ella, they all do it." 
He didn't mean me. I 
have 
a 
few kisses left, and when I 
distribute them it will be— 
Just to please the boys, &c. 
JUST OVER,. 
Written and sung with great success by Miss FLORA Mooaa. 
I 
came from Tiperary, 
A 
few short months ago, 
With spirits light and airy, 
I'm an emigrant you know, 
Pray let me ask yer pardon, 
Smile on me if yer please, 
For I 
came from Tiperary, 
So far beyant the seas. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go back again. 
But now I'm going to leave ye, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm going to leave the land I 
love, 
That's dear America, 
I 
am going back to my birth- place, 
In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the oid Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go back again. 
The Yankee Girl, 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for EMMA W HITNEY, of the W HITNEY'S, and 
oerformed by her with great success in their character sketch, 
" 
Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
yankee girl, 
My name is Sally Brown, 
I 
can eat more pumpkin pie or apple sass, 
Than all the girls in Oskosh town. 
I 
can hoe or plow upon a 
farm 
Till the sun my skin does tan, 
My brother Bill caught me last night 
A 
kissing the hired man. 
Spoken.—Yes, Bill catched me kissing the hired man, 
and I 
got the darndest thrashing you ever seen, I 
did, and 
the night before I 
had to go to bed at 4 
o'clock in the 
afternoon for sucking eggs. 
But me and the hired man 
has fun, by gosh, we do. 
We rigged up a 
stuffed man the 
other night, got a 
big white sheet around it, got charcoal 
and blackened him just like ribs, painted his eyes, and we 
got out of bed at 10 o'clock at night and went down to 
Parson Jones' house, stood it on the stoop, pulled the bell; 
the parson he came out, he got scared to death, he closed 
the door, ran in and got an old shot gun and fired out the 
window, and we were running down the street and he shot 
the hired man's hat, and Si Green seen us and told Parson 
Jones, and he had me and the hired man arrested and old 
Justice of Peace Simpson fined us 25 cents apiece, but if 
his daughter Sarah comes down to the Red School House 
I'll make her give me back that 25 cents, or I'll pull all her 
red hair out and give it to our two year old calf. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, wnat good old times we had 
In school ptaying circus clown, 
And playing tag with all the boys 
In good old Oskosh town.

And his firelock on his shoulder,

Winnie Clair, 
Written for Miss BEANE by W ILLIAM E. 
McNuurv. 
In the summer time, when the vespers' chime 
Over hill and dale was pealing, 
In a 
quiet nook, by a 
babbling brook, 
I 
first met Winnie Clair. 
With his curly hair played the fragrant air, 
And the sun's bright rays were beaming, 
Playing hide and seek w 
ith his dimpled cheek, 
Oh, it made him wondrous fair 
CHORUS. 
Free from care, [ Break.] 
Rich and rare, [ Break.] 
Was my darling little handsome Winnie Clair, 
In the summer time, &c. 
Over hill and dale, through a 
grassy vale, 
Arm in arm we then went straying. 
As I 
neared my gate, I 
then knew my fate 
Was a 
future bright and fair, 
For I 
answered " Yes" 
To his slight caress, 
And a 
blush my love revealing, 
I 
am now hi.-3 
wife, yes, his for life, 
And he calls me Winnie Clair. 
Free from care, & c,

Looking for Dates. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME for his friend Eht1LE AMES. 
Good morning, Mr. Agent, 
Anything new to-day ? 
Heard from his Nibs in Boston, 
What did he have to say? 
What ! says he never heard of us ? 
Well, he must have a 
cheek ; 
We've been together for the last ten years. 
And never lost a 
week. 
Cull we have the finest wardrobe, 
And all our acts are new. 
My partner he can do the flip, 
And I 
can do one, too; 
Our breakneck biz it is immense, 
We're sure to kill them dead ; 
My pard he turns a 
double, 
And stands right on his head. 
We also do a 
double clog, 
Or on the end can sit ; 
I 
know all the funny gags, 
And my partner does the split. 
We also do an Irish act, 
And I 
can walk a 
rope, 
Do straight biz for a 
stump speech, 
And we furnish our own soap. 
I 
can sing a 
ballad, dance a 
fling, 
Or do the man fish act ; 
I 
work in dramas, I'm a 
funny clown, 
I 
can split them up the back. 
So that must be a 
mistake, 
Or the salary is too high ; 
You can't be up with cullies 
Who think they are too fly. 
So just drop him another line 
And tell him what we do, 
And if you can't catch a 
hundred, 
Take twenty for the two.

American Fortune-Telling Csurds.— This is the 4old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia. 
monde- and Spades--and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
awd K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

ir,ourtituz Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e, way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-,
-,tlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which naieht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the cliffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
