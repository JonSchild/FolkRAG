The Serenading Band. 
By Joe Mealey. 
Sung with success by Mealy and Hague. 
If you are very fond of music, a 
story I'll relate, 
That happened one evening when the hour was very late; 
I 
was dozing off to sleep just like an honest man, 
When I 
was awoke by a 
serenade by the 
members of the band, 
The leader of the band was full, his cornet played M. O. 
He tried to play the famous how are you Nancy Lee, 
The bass it played the solo, a 
big blacksmith 
played the drum, 
The rest all played. the Oh come, oh ! birdie come. 
CHORUS. 
Thnre's the hornet and the cornet, the leader he did blow, 
The big drum and the little drum, the flute 
and the picolo did squeak, 
I 
nearly lost my senses when I 
heard them on the street. 
The windows were raised up high all along the street 
The neighbors all were crazy the music was so sweet. 
The trombone struck a 
high note that near 
paralyzed us all, 
And knocked the picolo silly when the leaves begin to fall 
The clarinet took a 
spasm, and I 
thought the 
bass would croak, 
When the leader made a 
discord and busted thirteen notes 
The drum turned a 
flip fl tp, and struck the 
side-walk with a 
thump, 
They drank a 
keg of beer apogee, and since then 
they've besn &Utah 
Here we are two hungry tramps, 
Arrived in a 
cattle train; 
To see a 
pie-faced friend of ours, 
Called red-nosed Mary Jane. 
She works in a 
gas- house chewing smoke, 
her father's mune is O'Brien, 
She was arrested last week in Germany, 
For ste ling the River Rhine, 
Oh ! cross-eyed Katy, 
Say you will be mine, 
If you don't I'll hang myself, 
On an old clothes line. 
Caoaus. 
We'll go to work in a 
brick yard, 
And bathe our feet in lime, 
Or else chew hay for a 
dollar a 
day, 
For cross-eyed Kate O'Brien. 
We'll be h'gh-toned'and live on the roof, 
Or else ia some alley way; 
It's cheaper to move than to pay the rent, 
That is what the people say. 
We'll be ash-box inspectors, 
Or cashiers in some sand bank, 
We'll work in a 
feather foundry, 
Or be man fish in a 
tank, 
Then we will be so happy, 
Always try to give you taffy, 
And sing and dance all night for you, 
Until the break of morn.

Mahoney the Rolling-Mill Man. 
Sung by Joe Mealey, IiiMaley and Ilagues latest success, 
" 
SLIPS." 
ve a 
first cousin named Dan Mahoney 
A 
highly respected old friend; 
lie is well liked by all of nis neighbors, 
And he has always a 
dollar to lend. 
He gets early to work in the morning, 
And for short all the boys call him Dan, 
There is no one around more respected, 
Than Mahoney the rolling-mill man. 
...CHORUS. 
You should see him at church on a 
Sunday, 
Along with his wife Mary Ann; 
The man that takes up the collection, 
Is Mahoney the rolling-mill man, 
Now Mahoney was shrewd and ambitious, 
Now don't you think he was smart, 
te now is the pride of the police, 
When ashes he used for to cart. 
It was I 
that had him appointed, 
For I'm boss of the political clan, 
And guarding the Central Park swallows, 
Is Mahoney the rolling-ratil, man._ 
Chorus.

" 
SLLPS ." 
I

As a

With this gentleman swells of the day, 
With due respect the whole fair sex, 
My clothes and shape admire, 
And my dancing I

They do never seem to tire. 
At a

For I'm an Irish gent of honor. 
Chorus, 
Promoted. 
Written for and sung by Miss Nellie Hague, the o 
iy lady 
baritone on OIL: variety stage. 
When a 
little girl I 
went to school, 
And it seemed quite hard to me, 
My parents and my friends, like•Cvise, 
Thought a 
great scholar I 
would be. 
I 
spent my time in idleness, 
In mischief's path I 
did tread, 
While others with pride would persevere, 
And be promoted to the head. 
Cuouus. 
Push to the head, push to the head, 
We all must toil for our daily bread, 
Remember it all, it is true what I 
said, 
Be honest and patient, and push to the head. 
My school days soon were passed and gone, 
And oft I 
did repent; 
If I 
had but the chance again, 
To learn would be my intent. 
I 
know how useful is knowledge, 
If I 
by kind advice was led, 
I'd try my best to beat the rest, 
And be promoted to the head. 
.MSTHETIC MICR. 
As sung by John O'Neal with great success. 
If you have got a 
five dollar note to cash, and want 
to catch a 
lovely mash, 
I'll tell you what t do; 
You must buy a 
bran new silk high hat, a 
pair of 
patent leather boots. 
And a 
necktie that's too-too, 
You must wear a 
flowing ulster, and say that you're 
from Munster, 
And walk off eating quick, 
In your pocket carry a 
billy, in your buttonhole a 
lily. 
And they'll c.all_you the asth ,tic Mick. 
C 
110RUS. 
And the neighbors all will say, as you are walking 
down the alleyway, 
"If that style suits all the families in the rear, I 
am 
sure that style suits me, 
Then what a 
very, very, very stylish young man 
This stylish young Mick must be." 
Be eloquent in praise for the very good old days, 
In the time of Bryan Born, 
And convince them if you can that your sister Mary Ann, 
Wore a 
small size number nine shoe. 
You must tell them she is crazy on the shamrock 
and the daisy, 
No matter what they think, 
You must have a 
terrible gall when you're asked to 
take a 
ball, 
And never miss a 
drink.

And they all will say, as you're walking down the 
alley‘A ay, 
There goes that dizzy young tad I 
see in the Park 
most every day, 
Then what a 
very, very, very dizzy young tad, 
This dizzy young tad must be. 
Now a 
sentimental passion for a 
regalable fashion, 
Now it don't suit you or me, 
If you have only got the cash for a 
five cent plate of 
hash, 
You must strike some brewery. 
If the boys they give you taffy you can walk with 
John McCaffery, 
He's gentle and he's kind, 
Vorget to be Festlietic when you're working up a 
racket. 
And go to the front every time.

There goes that chronic young lush that works the

The Valley of Chamouni. 
Sung by Miss IDA BRUMMELL. 
When the heart in golden fancies 
To the sway of happiest dreams, 
Back to scenes of beauty glances, 
Lit by mem'ry's brightest beams, 
Then I 
see that vale of fountains, 
Where the Alp flow'rs woo the gale, 
Under all the snow-crown'd mountains, 
Shining o'er that beauteous vale 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Chamouni, sweet Chamouni, 
Oh! the vale of Chamouni 
•Oh! Chamouni, sweet Chamouni, 
Oh! Chamouni's sweet vale. 
When I 
hear the Alp horn ringing, 
When Mont Blanc foretells the day; 
And the breeze of morning bringing 
Mountain chime and mountain lay— 
Then once more with rapture glowing, 
All that mountain land I 
hail, 
But my heart, with joy o'erflowing, 
Lingers in that beauteous vale. 
Oh 1

RALPH With BAIRD'S MINSTRELS. 
Little chilling, when your dreaming, 
Fast asleep within your bed; 
And the golden stars are gleaming, 
Far above your weary head; 
Mid the visions sweet of slumber, 
Floating round you bright and free; 
Keep my face among their number, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
CHORUS: 
Little darling we can never, 
From each other parted be; 
So remember now and ever, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
When the rosy morn is breaking 
Over all this world of our's; 
And the merry birdling waking, 
Sing a 
welcome to the flowers. 
On each glowing promise ponder, 
I 
have whispered unto thee t 
As the moments by you wander. 
Don't forget to dream of me.

FAR away down South in Alabama, 
Where the darkies plant the cotton and the corn,— 
In the land where blooms the sweet magnolias, 
In that paradise us darkies we were born;— 
Old Massa. he was kind, and little Missus too, 
They'd be amus'd to see us jump and dance,— 
Oh! they call us Alabama Blossoms, 
And we're going back when e'er we get a 
chance.

Old Massa he was kind, and little Missus too, 
They'd be amus'd to see us jump and dance,— 
Oh ! the eall'd us Alabama Blossoms, 
And we're going back when e'er we get a 
chance, 
Oh the sweet girls down in Alabama, 
We are longing ev'ry day more to see,— 
And there's one that says I 
am her darling, 
And I 
know that she is all the world to me;— 
Oh I 
when she said good-bye, it made this darkey cry, 
My heart was full of ev'ry kind of pain,_ 
But I'm going back to Jane Matilda, 
For I 
want to see her lovely face again. 
Old Massa he was, etc. 
We have been far from old Alabama, 
But there is no place that we love half so well,— 
And our secret now at last we've told you, 
But our love affairs we didn't mean to tell;— 
We know that far away, they're waiting ev'ry day, 
To see us coming smiling up the lane,— 
And we'll go back to the land of Cotton, 
And we'll never leave the dear old place again. 
Old Massa he was, etc. 
Don't give up the Old Friend for the New 
A 
very popular Motto Song. 
Words by JOHN MCVEIGH. 
Music by JOE A. 
Guticit.. 
Sung with great success by M ISS KATE MONTROSE at Novelty Theatre 
New York City. 
There's many a 
song with many a 
motto, 
Each containing good advice; 
Obey their teachings, too, we ought to, 
Tho' great temptations us entice; 
To sing a 
new song I'll endeavor, 
• And one I 
hope will please a 
few; 
Make all the friends you can, but never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
CH011,1JS: 
Then listen to the motto that I 
give you, 
You'll find a 
good one it will prove, and true; 
Make all the friends you can, 
Always lend a 
helping hand, 
But don't give up the old friend for the new. 
You may be poor in life's beginning, 
A man you meet just like yourself; 
His friendship you succeed in winning, 
He helps you on the road to wealth; 
And when you've won it, do not sever 
The ties that bind him still to you; 
He helped you in your need, so never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
To those who may, perhaps, be married, 
A 
word or two I 
have to say; 
By fairer faces be not carried, 
Completely off and led astray; 
In this, the age of quick divorces, 
Men love their wives a 
year or two; 
Then wander into other courses, 
Give up the old wife for the new. 
(Chorus). 
When the roses bud and blossom 
By the rippling river side, 
Where they gently nod and listen 
To the music of the tide : 
While the early stars are shining, 
In the far-off azure deep, 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep, 
In the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
How I 
long to hear you whisper 
All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above. 
Sweetest words to thee addressing. 
Loving arms around me creep, 
Could we evermore thus linger 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
Come to meet me, &c. 
JUST TO PLEASE THE BOYS, 
0.zng with great success in the principal Variety Theaters 
throughout the country by the DUNCAN SISTERS, 
CARRIE AND SOPHIE. 
THE subject of the songs to- day 
Is " Violets Dipped in Dew," 
And " Take, Oh take those Lips Away,", 
And " Laughing Eyes so Blue." 
I 
know these songs are just the thing • 
To please and bring us joys, 
But what I 
now intend to sing 
Is " Just to Please the Boys." 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys 
I've made my mind, and feel inclined 
To try and please the boys. 
To all young men who seek a 
wife, 
Before they are betrayed, 
I'd gladly give some good advie. 
For beauty soon will fade. 
Don't fall in love with all you see, 
Pure gold has no alloy; 
Their winning smiles, you must agree. 
Is just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc. 
Some girls you see upon the street 
Are but a 
fleeting show; 
Don't cast your fond hearts at their feet, 
They're not all pure as snow. 
And now, young men, I 
hope you'll learn 
To shun the world's decoys, 
And recollect that what I've said 
Was just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. 
J. 
FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER & WILLIAMS. 
I used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring- boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you thr ough 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautify' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel or 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When lie laid down and did, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him ink 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone,

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
He said lie learned them up at some free and aisy; 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him 
he broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
He have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring lessons from Professor Joh* 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity, 
He goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight a 
big black nagur; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
He got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
He have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to tL 
bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that he'll be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
He kicked his sister, Honorah in the forehead last week, 
He wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boiled oyster stews, 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the gtHWT.

MONEY. 
As sang vrith immense success by the only Miss NELLIE G.2.1zMON 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Always makes a 
good friend and a 
cronie; 
In a 
palace you'll dwell, there cut a 
great swell, 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
At otlice, of course, you're perfection, 
Your name bears great weight at election; 
You can have your own way, for you know you can pay 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Your name without Esquire, looks funny; 
The ladies all cry, and after you sigh, 
It's not for yourself, but your money. 
You'll have friends in abundance to greet you. 
It's how do you do when they meet you; 
Just lend me a 
ten, I'll pay you again, 
But that is the last of your money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
You will not be elected a 
dummy; 
With no fear of the law, you can open your jaw, 
And laugh at the Judge, if you have money, 
If at racing or cards you've been simple, 
Drank wine till your nose is a 
pimple, 
In some Prison or Jail, no friends to go bail, 
Then you'll know what it is to have money.

BROOKLYN'S GREAT FIRE. 
Composed by P. 
J. 
DOWNEY. 
(Air— " 
Sailor's Return." 
It was on a 
Tuesday night, as the stars were shining 
bright, 
When this happened which I'll now relate to you; 
It's about this sad affair that you bear most everywhere, 
And that o'er our pleasant city spread a 
gloom. 
It of the young and old I'll tell, how their dear lives they 
did sell, 
And who suffered, God only knows what pain; 
But I 
hope they're now at rest, in heaven with the blest, 
And with pain they'll ne'er be troubled any more. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
It was, on this fatal night, when with faces that wer, 
bright 
That those people they all left their happy homes ; 
If the " Two Orphans" they conld see, how happy they 
would be, 
And all to the Brooklyn Theatre they did go. 
The place it was filled soon, and some left for want of 
TOM, 
And them that got seats thought that they were lucky; 
But it's little did they know the trouble or the woe, 
That they were about to leave upon this earth. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
They all sat there with glee and the falling sparks did see, 
And they most all thought that it was in the play; 
But when they saw the flames and smoke they saw it was 
no joke, 
It's then they ran excited for the door. 
Some fell upon the floor, from which they rose no more 
And God help the women, you could hear them cry, 
And young men there with their wives, asking God t4 
save their lives, 
But it seemed they all were led there to die.

The spell is past. the dream is o'er, 
And tho' we meet we love no more; 
One heart is crushed to droop and die, 
And for relief must heav'nward fly. 
The once bright smile has faded, gone, 
And given way to looks forlorn, 
Despite her grandeur's wicked flame, 
She stoops to blush beneath her shame.

We never speak as we pass by. 
Eltho' a 
tear bedims her eye, 
I 
know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I 
sought her side, 
And she became my virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace so fair and bright, 
One sunny day, no gloomy night, 
No life on earth more pure than ours, 
In that dear home 'midst field and finwer4. 
Until the tempter came to Nell; 
It

And when th flatterer casts aside,

In a 
factory 'way down town; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon tile sand. 
Ev'ry summer at Rockaway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer; 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway. 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand plan, 
She never studied notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome hesei4 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
A.s sung with great success by Toir4 ?ASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song ha gew York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing. 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
1. 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze, 
(Chorus).

And to your home you retire '

Oa whom you love to admire; 
You nug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twi.1 bring;

And you'll hide bebin 1

When the sunshine of youtt, fades, and age bends us low,—

Will beam like a

By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing:

The Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Sung with thunders of applause by HARRY Mamoru). 
In the merry month of June, 
From my home I 
started, 
Left the girls of Tuam, 
Nearly broken-hearted; 
Saluted father dear, 
Kiss'd my darling mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother; 
Then off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout black thorn, 
To banish a 
ghost or goblin. 
In a 
bran new pair of brogues, 
I 
rattled over the bogs, 
And frightened all the dogs. 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, 
Whack-fal-lal-le, Whack-fal-lal-le-rido. 
In Mullinger that night, 
I 
rested limbs so weary, 
Started by daylight, 
Next morning light and airy; 
Took a 
drop o' the pure, 
To keep my spirits from sinking, 
That's an Irishman's cure, 
Whenever he's on for drinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while, 
At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a 
bubblin'. 
They ax'd me if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Till I 
was almost tired, 
Of the Rocky Road to Dublin. ( Cho) 
In Dublin next arrived, 
I 
thought it such a 
pity, 
To be so soon deprived, 
A view of that tine city; 
Then I 
took a 
stroll, 
All among the quality,

THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN— Continued. 
My bundle it was stole, 
In a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Then I 
looked behind, 
No bundle could I 
find, 
Upon my stick a 
wobblin'. 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue 
Wasn't much in vogue 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. (Cho.) 
From there I 
got away, 
My spirits never failin', 
Landed on the quay, 
As the ship was sailin'. 
Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he, 
When I 
jumped aboard, 
A 
cabin found for Paddy. 
Down among the pigs, 
I 
played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
The water round me bubblin'. 
When off Holyhead, 
I 
wished myself was dead, 
Or better far instead, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. (Cho.) 
The boys of Liverpool, 
When we safely landed, 
Called myself a 
fool, 
I 
could no longer stand it. 
Blood began to boil, 
Temper I 
was losin', 
Poor ould Erin's Isle, 
They began abusin% 
Hurra my soul, says I,

Saw I

You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you plod, 
When my spirit rests rrom pain ana sorrow free. 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle With the clay; 
In the winter of yonr sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
CHORUS. 
For old Uncle Torn is feeble, 
And his head is bending low; 
The Master calls, lie can ro longer stay--
For his limbs are getting weary, 
And his eyes are growing dim— 
You'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
You will tell our little children that their father dwells above; 
flow the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and sacred love; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the judge his trumpet sounds from realms of bliss on 
high, 
And the morning of thG great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling Chloe, and together you and I, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast. 
For old Uncle Tom is feeble, etc.

THE OLD LOG CABIN ON THE HILL. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY WooDsos 
with groat success at Tony Pastor's. 
Faraway in the South, among the cOtton fields, 
is the place I 
ever long to see, 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh I 
the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Ohl I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, OSA

Run For The Doctor, Charlie Dear.

When I 
got married my wife she said, 
Mamma will live with us, 
I 
felt a 
strong objection, 
But I 
feared to make a 
fuss. 
But still the mother came alas 
I 
fear she'll never go, 
And the worst, oh ! dear, she's always queer, 
For evrey day or so. 
CHORUS. 
It's run for the Doctor, Charley dear, 
Mother's taken very queer, 
Go for your life for Dr. Crupp, 
If you fall down don't stop to get up. 
Tell him she's got the old attack, 
Thinganay up and down her back, 
Make haste, dear, or else I 
fear, 
She never will live till morning.

There's nothing but bottles and nasty smells, 
Of physic from bottom to top.

week, 
She's always taking pills, 
The Doctors pay her visits, 
And I 
pay the doctor's bills.

When I remonstrate with the old lady 
about the amount of money she costs for Dr,. medicine 
etc, my wife rings all the bells, and shouts all over the 
house— 
Chorus. 
Since she's been in our house, 
I've been a 
wretched bachelor, quite, 
I 
only see my wife of a 
day, 
She's with her mother all the night, 
Sometimes I 
go to sleep and dream, 
I'm settled in paradise, 
But the wife soon comes and pulls me out, 
And the weather's cold as ice, 
Spoken.—Yes, my wife pulls me out on the cold floor 
and shouts in my ear— 
Chorus. 
As Sung by Tull: Bnaktems. 
I'm going to wring your tender hearts, 
So ladies all prepare ; 
Get ready your pocket- handkerchiefs, 
And let down your back hair! 
Oh! 
I 
doated on such a 
darling, 
Who intended me to wed— 
I'm certain of that, but don't you see, 
He had to say instead— 
OrtoRUS. 
" 
Good-bye, love, Oh! I'm bound to march away, 
Good-bye, dear, I'll come another day j 
One embrace, then right about face !" 
Then off they march away ! 
For many a 
day when on parade, 
I 
noticed with what ease 
The word of command he understood ; 
" 
Attention—stand—and freeze !" 
Oh ! 
We meant to have settled down upon 
His thirteen pence a 
day ! 
But duty, you know, is everything, 
Anti so he had to say— 
" 
Good-bye, love," &e. 
It's very ttnwrong for girls to love 
A 
soldier, it is plain ; 
They've only time to break our hearts! 
Then off they are again, oh! 
Now mine was a 
dear who could make love— 
At courtship quite au fait! 
But just at the interesting part, 
He always had to say— 
" 
Good-bye, love," &z.

IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know,

But let us bar the door on the days that are no room 
There's a

If you liste.n unto me I 
will tell you, do you see,

Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
B2 England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this vets

W E 
are four dissipated tramps, 
And that you plainly see; 
We came all the way from Buffalo 
A week ago to day. 
We worked our way upon the cars, 
For money we hadn't a 
dime, 
Until we reached this city 
And our comrades here did join. 
Cuoitus. 
Now don't sneer at us when we pass, 
Or say there goes a 
stager! 
Although we're victims of the keg, 
You'll find far worse than " Gaugers." 
This world owes us a 
living, 
And we'll have it to a 
man! 
So let no one despise us 
Because we carry a 
can. 
There's a 
branch that " carries the banner," 
That branch is called V. G.; 
But we're delegates from the " Gaugers," 
Which is far above that degree. 
We go our rounds within our bounds, 
So give us the respect we're due. 
We never go around singing:" hard up," 
Or " The faded coat of blue." 
Now don't sneer, etc. 
Bad scran to the " five-cent schooners," 
But it's them we do disdain! 
Since the first day they were introduced 
In the kegs there's not a 
drain! 
But before we tarn the corner 
We'll fill our cans, we'll wager,

THE HOME OF THE SHAMROCK. 
:0:-
Sung with great success by DAN MCCARTHY AND KITTIE COLEMAN 
---: 0 :----
I'm a 
light-hearted girl from the green shores of Erin, 
The fairest and dearest place to me; 
Although small, its the gem little spot on the ocean, 
And how I 
long to see it free. 
There's where you'll find the true sons of Nature, 
All open-hearted, although some be poor; 
It's the land of my birth- place, forget it, no, nevcr, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Citontrs: 
Then hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
Where true Irishlearts loved with fondest devotion, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Soon I'll be back to my forefathers' country, 
There's where I 
ever long to roam; 
Where stout Irish lads they are willing and hearty 
To make for their friends a 
pleasant home. 
There's where my father and my poor aged mother 
Have lived, and arc happy on Erin's green shore; 
'Tis the land of St. Patrick, forget, 
never, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
IRISH NIGHTINGALE. 
Written by Edwin Talbot. 
Music by Dick Devlin. 
Sung by Devlin & Tracy with great success in their great 
specialty acts and sketches. 
I 
heard the Nightingale's voice the woodland's tufts 
among, 
Yet sweeter were the tender notes of Miss Kelly's song, 
So soft into the ear they steal, so soft into the soul, 
The deep'ning pain of love they soothe and sorrow's pang 
control. 
CHORUS— 
Singing merrily, soft and cheerily, 
Meirily, cheerily, soft and merrily, 
Singing cheerily, merrily, cheerily, 
Through the woodlands all day long. [ Repeat. 
I 
look upon the pure brook that murmured through the 
glade, 
And mingled in the melody that my Miss Kelly made, 
Yet purer was the residence of Miss Kelly's heart, 
Above the reach of pride and guile above the reach of art. 
Chorus. 
Oil! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some FIAT Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one. Jyt the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
dut Put Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Man. 
Hurrah! hurrah hurrah I 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, ha 8 
been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
Skinny Tight Pants. 
Written and sung by M. THOMPSON. 
Good- evening to you, one and all, 
I 
am glad to see you well ; 
If you listen to me a 
little while, 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's all about my blackguard boy, 
I'll tell while I've got a 
chance 
how he has gone to the bad entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
CHORUS. 
He's out all night till broad daylight, 
At every picnic and dance ; 
He's gone to the had entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
He came home here the other night, 
And loudly began to bawl, 
Saying, " Mother come give me my supper quick, 
For I 
going to Wallahalla Hall." 
I 
says, " What's going on there to-night 
" 
Don't you know," says he, " there's a 
dance r 
Indeed, I 
needn't expect anything else 
When you're cleaning your skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, &c. 
Now I 
am told he carries a 
pop, 
And dances the trallaloo; 
You ought to see him when he's all dressed up, 
Promenading the Avenue. 
The girls are all dead mashed on him, 
And with him they love to dance, 
For his legs look like a 
pair of clothes pins 
When he has on his skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, &c. 
Now I'll bid you all good-by, 
As my song is at an end ; 
If there's anybody here with skinny tight pants, 
I 
hope none of you I 
did offend. 
Now, if you are going to a 
party, 
A 
picnic, or a 
dance, 
Take my advice, if you want to look nice. 
Don't wear any skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, etc.. 
TAKE IT BOB. 
Sung with immense success by Miss ALEci.A. JOURDAN. 
I'm a 
jolly Toung miller, Bob Bell is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame ; 
I've a 
dear little sweet- heart, a 
nice little lass, 
I'm fond of her too, and Fin fond of my glass. 
Perhaps I'm too fond they say, that may be, 
I 
try to be merry, ; Ind am as you see; 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drinks a 
day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of my mill seems to say— 
CHORUS. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy my mill seems to say; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it, 
Take it Bob, take it, its better titan tea. 
I 
dreamt ' tother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
lie died at the age—well, say twenty-four, 
And I 
heard the fdlks ' round me say, " drinks done its 
worst." 
And although I 
was was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A 
bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
'Twas me-ant for the mourners, It was'nt for me, 
And as on my bed still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard my mill say— 
Take it Bob, & c. 
Now I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My Pa thinks its business between you and me, 
But you know the old saying that never deceives— 
What the eye does'nt see, the heart never grieves. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good- by to you all, 
Perhaps soon again I'll give you a 
call; 
Now don't ask me to drink before I 
go away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear my mill say— 
Take it Bob, ke.

Home Again. 
UNDER THE LILACS, 
Oh I 
I 
love a 
charmer—a 
sweet little maid— 
With eyes like the stars in the sky, 
Her home is a 
cot in a 
green, mossy glade, 
Where a 
swift flowing brook ripples by; 
'Tis fair as an Eden with beautiful flowers, 
And there day by day at her side, 
Together we talk of the bright happy hours 
We'll pasts when I 
claim her my bride. 
Under the lilacs, under the Dines, 
Talking of love on a 
bright summer's day. 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Together we lovingly pass time away. 
One warm day in summer we sat 'ueath the Italia, 
Her hand within mine I 
held fast, 
So earnestly talking to her, I'm afraid 
I 
knew not how quickly time passed; 
I 
begged her to join me through life's coming h011lift 
She promised that she'd be my wife, 
How I 
bless the day, when ' neath the IllAP's sweet flowers, 
I 
woe, her, my darling, for life. 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE. 
We're an Irish pair and we just landed, 
We came across the deep blue sea, 
And now we're here we're going to tell you 
What we will do in America. 
We'll sing a 
dance like many others, 
Let troubles come, go where we may, 
We'll borrow none, our hearts are cheerful ; 
We're always gay on St. Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We'll go home again, we'll go home again, 
So farewell friends, we'll go home again. ( Repeat.) 
So now kind friends we're going to leave you, 
We're going back where we were born— 
That dear old spot that we call Ireland, 
The climate there is always warm. 
When we get there, kind friends will greet us 
With loving hearts and welcome hands, 
So farewell friends, we now must leave you, 
We're going back to old Ireland. 
We'll go home again, &c.

LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY HuGnEs.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be o good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor 
Now, since leaving old Ireland. my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she mid? 
And the.ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters. sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never Lear, 
We'll make a 
tine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll livp .,us, although we be poor. 
Buttercups and Daisies. 
Recited by DAISY R ENIINGTON. 
49 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather, as I 
journeyed on my way ; 
To any eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid. 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rieh, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch; 
Pointing to the daisies' silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered—these, she said, were gold. 
With the time departing, soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled ; 
Once again I 
wandered, with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden, vast in wealth arrayed. 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
Had been there before us and taken all our gain ; 
With his icy fingers, and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot ; 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief— 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief. 
So it is with friends, then, sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine, but leave us in the fall ; 
When a 
warm friend slights me, or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and.butteretys of gold. 
Erin Green Isle. 
Words and Music by Edward Haley, and sung by the Mtn. 
phys, Paddy and Ella, in all the principal Theatres in 
the United States. 
There's a 
dear spot of land far out in the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle, 
Sure it's there I 
was horn one bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, lily sistir and brother 
Were pleased, to be sure, all the while ; 
And they shed tears of joy for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk of Old England, of France and of Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and great men, 
But the whole -world ( loth know that fair Erin can show 
_Nobler sons, fairer daughters than them. 
I 
can mention such names as O'Connel and Moore, 
And the brave Duke of Ni ellington, while 
King Brian Borhue, and brave Emma, too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's green isle. 
The Lakes of Killarney, on Erin's green isle, 
Are lovely, enchanting and fine. 
Our mountains and vu leys are second to none ; 
Their beauty is really suldime. 
There the shamrock (loth grow in plenty, you .know, 
Encouraged by nature's sweet smile. 
Dear land of my birth; garden spot of the earth— 
You're my idol, fair Erin's green isle.

As sung by REYNOLDS 4.: W ALLING. 
I 
am thinking of the day when hut a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forevergrowing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Rate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played 'neath the Turnpike gate. 
CIIORTIS. 
ror the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
'When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds me ot the Turnpike gate. 
And the old school-hou ,e 
has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
Spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate, 
And those hippy childhood days they'll come again no 
more, 
When we played on the Turnpike gate.

We sat b7 the river, you and I ! 
In the sweet summer time long ago. 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh! we were sadder.-.'d, you and I! 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd. soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream

listen to the soothing song,

American Fortune-Telling CarGn,— This is the old.

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3. to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under , 
standing. Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

'Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
1,J meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
MaraLnoung ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dith. 
de'- 
too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qattflon. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. wit] cover even5 
phase of courtship. 
The eentiments conveyed therein need not hn 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards ia not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties.
