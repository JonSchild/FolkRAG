Barbara Orbach begins the interview by asking Loma McKee all 
the questions on the interview report form (see Barbara Orbach*s 
notes dated 8/19/80). Additionally Loma explains her family’s 
living situation, staying in a trailer close to her in-laws 
because she and her husband cannot afford the payments to build 
their own house on their 44 acres of land at the moment. 
The tape is interrupted by squeaks and squeals due to the equipment 
and the inexperience of the recordist.

Index # Outline of material 
The interview covers some of the family history (see also Interview 
Report form) and the immigration from Denmark first to Breckenridge, 
then to a homestead at Slate Creek, where the family later acquired 
the present ranch in 1918. Ranching activities included cattle 
and sheep raising, milk cows to sell cream; for about ten years a 
small dude ranch was operated on the property. Slate Creek was a 
community of mostly Scandinavian immigrants. The techniques of 
hay stacking and construction of log buildings are discussed, as 
are skiing, cutting of ice, use of the horses, water rights, old 
tools, the switch to gasoline operated machinery, electricity and 
the telephone. Charlie describes the earlier, much larger Slate 
Creek community. He does not recall any specific Scandinavian 
traditions other than eating 'Luchtfisk'.

Index # Outline of material 
The recording starts during a break in the weekly square dance 
practice of the Summit County 4 Squares club. For a while the 
dancing goes on with the ’Hokee Poke' and more such, until I. W. 
McKee resumes his role as a caller and the square dance continues. 
When his wife comes in, he jokes that he has to go home now. 
Intermittent conversation is barely understandable.
