52 years old/ 1962 
One of Steve’s Barns 
00:30 I am the third generation Jarmoc Farmer. My grandfather came to CT  from Poland. He worked on 
a local farm and the owner of the local general store was accustomed to seeing him and said, “Why 
don’t you have your own farm?” and he said because it is a lot money. I just came from Poland and 
don’t have that kind of money. 
1:00 “Well you’ve been here tending Mr. Abbey’s farm for a couple of years and I am very comfortable 
loaning you the money for a farm and you can repay me.” So that is how it started. It was a local Allen’s 
Hardware or General Store that gave him the money to buy our home farm. It was 40 acres and he paid 
3,149.00 for that farm. I still have the chattle mortgage that he had at that time. 
1:35 So he bought it and luckily everything has worked out pretty well since. He paid it off in a couple of 
years. It was subsistence farming with tobacco as the cash crop. 5-7 cares of tobacco and the rest was 
the substance farming 
02:05 They did that through the twenties. My dad was born in 1926. He got to be a farm kid and loved it 
growing up. He started farming also. He went to University of Connecticut and he went for electrical 
engineering. He was in Roxy, or V12 program where you signed up for the war or the military for the 
privilege if a college education. 
03:00 So he actually, after college went to the Korean War, 1957, as a tank mechanic. Got an 
accommodation as the best tank mechanic. Good old Farm boys know their maintenance. That was the 
joke. 
03:35 Once he was done he came back and farmed but he wasn’t sure what direction to go in. He got a 
master’s degree in electrtical engineering and then taught at UConn and MIT. He also farmed some 
tobacco and then he said what happ[ened is that the school work and the farm work was catching up to 
him. 
04:10 A few farms came up for sale here on Broadbrook so he bought them and stopped teaching in 67. 
In 66 he bought one farm that was 14 acres and then the year after he bought another one was 23 
acres. Progression of adjacent farms kept coming up for sale. Went from the 7 my grandfather was 
farming to about 40 when dad worked with him. 
05:28 I was born in 62. Wasn’t worth a lot. In the early 70’s I got to be more useful and would help him 
with anything that needed to be done. And at that time he was growing abour 50-60 acres. 
05:50 I’d be on the planter after school almost every day very rarely did school functions get in the way. 
And I would do my homework after I came at night. You plant then you walk through it and fix the skips. 
Later you cultivate the soil and fertilize or side dress the plants. Then you hoe the tobacco, pulling soil 
up around it to get fertilizer closer to the plant and shoring up the base so that it does not fall over in 
the wind. It can take a little more of the weather.  
07:05 General maintenance period. Then it would start to bud out so you would pick off buds and or 
topping them. Budding is a little different. We call it storm protection. If you get heavy rains or wind that 
flower will fill up with water and become top heavy so it will blow over easily. It is worse than picking up 
sticks as a kid as a game! 
07:40 A thunder storm could blow that tobacco all over so when it falls over it breaks leaves off or 
crunching them. When you pick it up to stand it up and pull dirt in around the base and all you hear is 
the clicking of breaking leaves. It is the worse job on the farm. Whenever you have to stand up tobacco 
it is never a good thing. 
08:10 So we would do that, then we’d go right into the harvest. When I was little I would hand tobacco 
plants to people who puts it on the lath. As I got older I’d drive Tractors to the barn and then hang it in 
the barns. Once the barns are full you open and close them at night depending on weather to keep good 
air in the barn. Sometimes we’d light fires under the tobacco.  Keep the air dry. Then you’d take it down 
and strip the leaves off and pack it up and it would be ready to go.  
09:10 I did those jobs when I was younger and now any of those jobs I do but I am always running 
around to make sure that the next job is ready to do. There is more planning and more BS. When I could 
just work I was happier. Now I have to think and work. That was the sequence when I was little and it 
really hasn’t changed.  
09:45 When I was in highschool my dad thought it would be a good idea if I grew some of my own 
tobacco to learn the business side of it. How much it costs, where to put money, where to cut on 
expenses. That was when I was a junior in highschool. I rented 5 acres of land from him and grew my 
own crop and it turned out pretty good. I actually made some money. He was probably lenient on some 
of the expenses and that was how he trapped me. He sucked me in. I thought this was a great life and 
then you find out that the expenses are a little higher than I thought.  
10:40 I did that as a junior and senior. Made enough money to pay for my own college tuition. I still 
grew tobacco, about 18 acres while I was in college. You find out that not every year is a good year. 
11:20 That is farming. Farming is an economic cycle where you can do everything right and still come out 
the loser in the end due to weather and Mother Nature. You see some good crops get hit by hail and the 
leaves look like Swiss cheese. No one wants a cigar wrapper like Swiss cheese. So that tobacco goes for 
filler or grinding or stemming so it is at a value of 50 cents a pound. It is costing about 6 dollars a pound 
to grow it and get it through the season.  
12:00 You don’t want many bad times. For any tobacco there are three parts to the cigar, the filler with 
broken leaves, the binder it holds it all together. Wraps around several times so that holes get covered. 
Thjen the wrapper goes around one time. If they can get 5 or 6 wrappers out of a leaf, that is a lot better 
than four.  
13:10 When started growing shade that was in 1998 when we tried growing a little shade. The Shade 
Association was looking for farmers to grow it. So we grew 7 acres and it turned out great. 
14:00  With shade you never know. From the Fall 1998 when you are taking the tobacco down you can 
see it but it then gets sent to the Dominican for sorting. They do that late spring of 1999. I was there in 
the Dominican for the winter/spring to look at the crop and see hyow it was doing. There is a lot more 
hand labor with shade but still thought it wasn’t a bad crop. It sorted out well that first year. Beginner’s 
luck. 
15:00 There is a lot more money in shade but there is a lot more risk. To grow an acre of broadleaf is 
around six bucks a pound. That six bucks turns into 10, 12 or 13 thousand an acre. To grow an acre of 
shade tobacco is like 35-40 thousand and more. That is on a low budget. My Farm Credit Agency had me 
pegged at about 58,000 an acre to grow shade. When I started in 98 it was good. 99 I grew a little more 
but that saw some flaws just by increasing in size. 
16:20 We weren’t as careful, more people, more handling but not a bad crop. It made some money. In 
2000 there was a turn in the shade industry. I was an associate member with no voting rights, just filler. 
They told me not to grow it. That was 2000. They didn’t need it. So I just grew broadleaf. 
17:05 In 2001 I grew some. They did not accept me as a member yet but said that they would try to 
market it for me. That never happened. I had some shade. Tried to sell it but most manufacturers want 
it already processed. They don’t want to get stuck if there is a lot of junk in it.  
17:50 We fermented the broadleaf tobacco and classify it. Didn’t do it with shade because there are 40 
classifications for shade and 7 for broadleaf. We sweated the shade tobacco. Once you ferment a leaf it 
never spoils. It is good forever in the box. I was finally able to get rid of that crop around 2004. 
19:00 Every year I would put in to be a member in the shade association. In 2004 they accepted me so I 
grew about 27 acres and it turned out fair. Break even crop. Crazy summer, a lot of rain. Shade does not 
like it. It is all about sun. Everytime it rained we’d add fertilizer but it didn’t like that either.  
20:00 Tobacco is a pig. It will eat anything you feed it. But unfortunately it shows up after. Once it is 
cured out the leaves that took up the nitrogen the veins turned black. Almost a skeleton. Pronounced 
vein system. Halloween looking leaf. That was 2004. 2005 two farms came up for sale and they would be 
great shade farms. One was a shade farm years ago and that one I thought would be a great buy at 
whatever cost. Great piece of land. Farm it or sell. Center of town and easy utilities. Have to know what 
the value is if you can’t farm it. 
21:30 Lego farm. We bought it. 55 acres. It was expensive because it was industrial land. Got if for just 
under 30,000 acre. For shade you need fine dry sandy soil that dries quickly. That makes the best shade 
land. The Thrall’s have the best soil. You can add fertilizer and water and it is available for the plant. 
23:00 That year was probably one of the wettest in history. Even the driest land made marginal tobacco. 
Didn’t do well. That one carried the other farms. Grew dark black tobacco that didn’t burn well. An awful 
year. the summer of 2005. In the fall the farm we are sitting on came up for sale. Due to His will had to 
be sold and divided amongst his heirs. 
24:25 It was centrally located so the farm credit bank gave me more money. Between when my dad 
trapped me in and the bank giving me anything I wanted…. In tobacco land we have about 300 acres or 
275 that is cleared in total we own 500 acres.  
25:20 We will never grow all of that. When we had broadleaf and shade together our highest acreage 
Planted was about 240 acres. There is some space that is lost on the periphery. In shade you leave a lot 
of open space to leave room for the sprayers. In the fields we would lose 20% of the land. Plant 8 leave 2 
open for sprayers 
26:30 Everyone in the association was producing junky shade due to weather. The market started to 
deteriorate. After the 1st year not worried, after 2nd year still waiting After the 3rd year they look 
somewhere else. They grow a lot of shade tobacco in Ecuador.  
27:10 Blue mold was a big factor in shade. You just look at it and it gets diseased. The leaves are thin and 
docile. People didn’t know how to care for it. Weren’t as good at spraying it early and often. By 2007 
that market moved to Ecuador, CT shade in Ecuador. They could grow it for about 30 cents on the dollar. 
Cheap land and labor. Shade passes through the hands 100 times. 
28:30 So shade went from 70 acres to 45 the next year to 23. I grew Havana. Something different. 
Tobacco is like fashion cycles. Havana was grown in Massachusetts. Grew some down here. Group of 
craft cigar makers. They wanted something different than the norm. They loved it. That was 10 years 
ago. 2005 I think. That was my son’s crop. My son is Owen. I got him hooked the same way. 
31:20 We grow a little more Havana each year. It is more like broadleaf. Hardy. Same growing 
techniques as broadleaf but it is easier to handle. The elephant ear leafs of broadleaf break. Havana – 
the leaves grow upward so they don’t get folded under and break. Less damage. More marketable 
leaves. 
We grow about 1/8th Havana. Hard to find cigar makers who want it. Traditionalists are worried about 
getting good broadleaf in 2016. They are more convinced if you have a good line why change it. 
33:00 Through the state we have gotten some different seed that we are trying to make even different 
leaves.  
33:30 Thrall is the biggest tobacco farmer in the area. He is number 1. I am in the top 5. Everyone is 
down in acerage this year. All the guys who were members of the Windsor shade association prior to 
me, I was already affiliated with a broadleaf buyer, so when the shade started to tank the cigar 
manufacturer asked them to grow broadleaf and they could sell it directly to the manufactor. I knew 
right then that it wasn’t a good thing.  
35:00 Most people do not grow both. It is either or. There were about 7 members who now started to 
grtow broadleaf. Put a kink in it for us because we couldn’t sell direct. Their prices could be higher. They 
now got a little over eager and they grew a lot of it and didn’t do quite the job they did in the past so 
they have gotten cut back which will even out the market a little more.  
37:00 We deal with tobacco brokers I will try to sell some direct to craft manufactorors. Cigar show 
every year. All of the manufactors are there. They are there to sell cigars and I am there to sell tobacco. 
It is a symbiotic relationship. I need them and they need me. This year I will be bring Corovo and Creouo, 
38:30 The Bshed was a falling down piece of mess when my dad bought his first farm in 1966. It was 
falling down then. They jacked it up to try and straighten the roof. Metal bracing to pull in the sides. 
They did the best job they could. It outlived the 2010 snow storm. We lost three barns. We were 
shoveling roofs off to save the barns. I never worked so hard in my life. 20 barns. 
40:30 it was a process just to get from shed to shed. A regular plow  truck couldn’t make it through. We 
had back hoes move the snow. Chest high snow to climb the ladder. On the roof, the snow was so deep 
there was little chance to fall off. It was like cutting up a pan of brownies. 36 inches at the least 42 
inches. Half a day to do a side of a shed.  
42:00 When you fall you don’t know what you are in for. You go over the edge and the snow was about 
a foot away from your feet. Up to your neck. We lost three sheds and one to fire but didn’t lose the 
whole shed.  
43:00 Around 2007 that shed caught on fire from propane burners. Fresh tobacco. One of the laths was 
shaken off and landed on a burner. That stick caught fire, the upright started fire. Lucky to save it. 
Tobacco was so green. When the fire got to the roof line the fire exploded. We ended up cutting out the 
middle section. Had two little barns on each end. Then we rebuilt the middle section. 
44:00 It is costly to build a shed but not as bad as you think. To build an acre of shed room is around 
10,000. Big expenses plywood and shingles. Framing lumber is pretty cheap. Hemlock or spruce. 55 
cents a foot board. Not a lot of hinges or metal. We put metal roofs on now instead of asphalt. Will last 
longer, snow slides off and much quicker to replace a roof. Go right over the shingles. Roof a side of a 
shed in a day.  
47:20 IN our heh day from 90’s we built a lot of barns 15. We have probably 45 that we own and we 
filled about 60 when we were at our highest acreage. 45 barns holds about 225 acres. We try to space 
out the tobacco in a barn. More air. Air is cheap. Air is a good thing for tobacco. 
48:30 We are encouraging Owen to work hard. He is going to college. Twins. Daughter to Boston College 
and Owen to Providence College majoring in business. The life cycle of the farm is a tough grind. Some 
years you do everything right you make no money and you are still in debt. (We got interrupted by a 
worker looking for a water barrel and so the interview wrapped up after he left.)
