[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax; Port
Aransas, TX]
March 8, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I was very pleased to see all the letters, which are being returned under separate cover,
but I must confess that I am somewhat a little surprised at your reasons for sending them
to me. I repeat, perhaps for the last time, that I have absolute confidence in you. This
confidence, aside from my personal feelings in the matter, is based on my simple belief
that you and your son are the finest folk song collectors in this country. This has been my
opinion for some time and nothing has happened to make me change it. I am still working
on the schedule in the few spare moments that I have, and hope to have it very soon.
Adrian Dornbush asked me today to help him locate a small group of cowboy singers
numbering from three to six who combine “authenticity” with an ability to entertain. This
is for a gathering in Washington in June in which Mrs. Roosevelt is interested and which
I believe she will attend. The expenses of the singers to and from Washington will, of
course, be paid. I thought perhaps that you would be in a position to recommend a suitable
group. Will you please let me know by air mail whether or not there are such singers in all
of Texas?
With kindest regards, Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
