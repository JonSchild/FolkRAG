Roland has agreed that a panel on ethics would
 
be a fine t
iling for the spring meeting, and has
 
gotten Hector Lee to serve as moderator.  I am
 
presently thinking in terms of you, Barre, and
 
myself as panelists--not quite sure how that
 
ought to be distributed vis-a-vis special concerns,
 
nor whether this would constitute sufficient repres-
entation.
 
I
',n not particularly concerned about "
balance"
 
in the sense of giving those who find ethics
 
irrelevant equal time; I
'm sure t here will be
 
enough of that from the floor!  But I
'd like to
 
have your thinking on it. ,
That aspect would
 
you prefer to c
oncentrate on (
I'm assuming that
 
you're still interested in participating in such
 
a panel), and can you suggest anyone else who
 
could i
iake a worthwhile contribution?
 
(
Barre, I think, c
culd handle the archiving
 
problem.)
 
merry Christmas, and lookin  forward to hearing
 
from ,
you,

Dear Bess,

May 16, 1972
 
I have finally finished with the financial arrangements from
 
the conference,  and am not happy with the results.
 I had
 
everything planned well,  I thought, until  I ran headlong
 
into a man who runs the concession in the cafeteria.
 Had I
 
anticipated the difficulty  I encountered,  I would have insisted
 
on the payment for lunch from those who received it free,  but
 
I simply did not expect the cafeteria to be any different from
 
the rest of the institution, which was so helpful with all
 
the announcements, the mailing, arrangements and so on. 
But! 
After planning the luncheon with the foods class and carefully
 
limiting the cost of the preparation to $75.00, the cafeteria
 
charged us $85 for opening its doors and having a supervisor
 
there,  p
lus serving the coffee!
 I finally got the man who
 
runs the place down to $75, but he would budge no further.
 
My plans to return to the Society about $
100 are reduced to 530.00.
 
(The money, not the plans.)
 Well,  here it is:

I did not charge the Society for the few people that finally
 
made it to the tour of historic  Sacramento,  as it was in part
 
my responsibility to see that the time schedule made that visit
 
possible, and I feel that the delay in the morning contributed to
 
the problems that afternoon.
 It was only a small amount.
 Roland
 
agreed, also, that the entertainment for the dinner was not what
 
we had planned,  so the Brittons did not receiae an honorarium,
 
particularly since they chose to dine there at our expense.

A check for the balance will be sent to you from the Business
 
Office at ARC.  Would you like me to have them send a complete
 
accounting of the money also?
 
I am in the process of sending letters to all of those people
 
who gave reports at the conference, asking their instruction,
 
regarding the disposition of the taped report .  When I finish
 
with that , I shall try to put together a correction list for
 
the Society of names and addresses , which should help to bring
 
the mailing list up to date , although I don 't know how many
 
of those attending were actually members of the society.
 I
 
can perhaps check against that incredibly difficult list they
 
sent if I find time.
 
I appreciate your assistance and your support , and hope that
 
you are not too disappointed `
TIV-the final results.
 As you
 
indicated before , something must always go wrong,  and it did!
 
I was not pleased with the final panel , although I was able
 
to hear only a part of it and have not had time to listen
 
to the tape .  I am trying to learn to be more compassionate
 
about such things , but  I am slow learning...
 
Please forgive the hasty manner of this letter.
 Let me
 
hear from you regarding your response to the budgetary
 
matters .  Hope you are planning some rest and recreation
 
for the coming summer.
 
Fondly,

Dear Bess:
 
Thank you very much for your note of May 1
2, the kind
 
remarks and the request for some information on the finances
 
of the recent CFS meeting. I have been in touch with Marjorie
 
McLain, and you should receive a statement shortly with some
 
small balance for the Society. I t seems the catering outfit
 
at ARC charged $75 for merely opening the cafeteiia for the
 
luncheon. I was pleased to hear you say something about the
 
program, and especially the printed one. While I heard many
 
favorable comments on papers, you are the only who noticed
 
the printed effort. It took many hours of haggling with our
 
print shop, finding appropiite figures, etc. so I appreciate
 
your remarks. I regretted having three performers not show up;
 
I had expected one or two, and had a graduate student of mine
 
in the background if needed. But the papers were of such length
 
and Geoffrey Ahhe soaccommodating, I bypassed them. But if the
 
meeting was successful, I think it was due to your capable
 
presidential hand. You added grace and poise to parliamentary
 
procedure.
 
One thing that still concerns me, and that may class me
 
as a paranoic, is the way the s@lection of a northern vice
 
president was made. I have been a member of the Society almost
 
ten years, have read papers before it twice, served as local
 
arrangements chairman back in 1964, attended meetings whenever
 
possible, and worked diligently to arrange an interesting and
 
balanced program this year; y
.et, when the time comes to select
 
a successor to Dan Crowley, I am evidently overlooked without
 
a second thought in favor of someone only recently associated
 
with the Society, who has never read a paper there or anywhere
 
as far I know, whose training and background in folklore is
 
minimal at best. I have published in SFQ ( 3 times) Saturday
 
Review ( 5 reviews on books concerned with folklore) Names (2),
 
have read papers before AFS, CFS, SEMLA, SWMLA, ANS ( 3 times),
 
Univ of Ky Foreign Language Conference, have two articles yet
 
to be published by Names, will teach three courseshere next fall
 
in folklore, did a disserttAlon in medieval folklore. And y
,et,

I must be so unprepossessing a character that D.K. Wilgus
 
can whisper to me just before he arises to read the nominations
 
that I am on the nominating committee, and show me the names
 
simult&neoussly almost as he announces them. I felt used,
 
and I saw no need for it. It was a most humbling experience
 
but it has also left me a bit sour on the Society,and I
 
would recommend that before alienating other old timers
 
in possible future ele6tions, some formal process for
 
sklecting a nominating committee be instituted. In many
 
organizations, as you know, past presidents serve in this
 
capacity. Our organization• is perhaps too loose to engage
 
in formal balloting, but %* seems to me to avoid the
 
appearance of perpetuating a clique, particularly if students
 
are to be involved, that some public procedure in the
 
nominations would be advisable.
 
Perhaps you think I am making too much of this, but
 
I have worked closely with Marjorie these last few months
 
and that familiarity has bred only a heightened sense of
 
injustice. I hesitate to say more. You may burn, swallow or
 
shred this. As the graffiti have it, even paranoids have
 
enemmesz..maybe what I really need is an enema. In the meantime
 
we will be in touch with all participants, and those who want
 
tapes destroyed will be so honored. Ii two cases no tapes
 
were made, by request of the performer, and there may be more.
 
It was my fault in not reminding two section chairmen; I was
 
too worried about the missing projectors, I guess. Never too
 
old to learn, as Mithridates said to Methusaleh. Congratulations
 
on your part, and as  I said,

Oear Bess,
 
I think you can take satisfaction and pride in the fact that
 
last week's CFS conference will go into the annals as one of the
 
very best.
 
On the matter of changin? the name of the Society, I have a
 
suggestion.
 (One of the burdens of your office is to receive an
 
infinite number of unsolicited suggestions.)  Since at the business
 
meeting the concensus of the house seemed to be that a mail ballot
 
mould be used to get broader representation, I suggest that you
 
give the membership some of the pros and cons of the argument.
 
Let someone (Eisner, for example) write a paragraph stating why we
 
s
' ,ould go "Western" and someone else (Bundes,  for example) do the
 
same for the negative.  Of course, you had already considered do`
.ng
 
something like this.
 
On r
sy suggestion for CFS to coordinate programs leading to
 
jobs in folklore, I think I suggestel a committee.
 Before that
 
gets started,,perhaps I should outline what I had in mind in some
 
kind of position X
J paper and set of proposals.
 I
'll try to get
 
to that sometime t
'
.^is summer; then you will have something specific
 
on which to proceed.
 
Yours,

Sacramento, California
 
Dear President Boettcher:
 
You no doubt will already have heard how successful the Twentieth
 
Annual Meeting of the California Folklore Society was, which was held on
 
your campus, April 28-29.  Having attended all 20 meetings of the Society
 
over the years, I can honestly say that the meeting at ARC was certainly
 
one of the very most successful we have ever held.  "
things were well
 
planned, and visiting delegates and guests were made to feel thoroughly
 
at home.
 
This i
s the f
irst time that our group ever met on a community col-
l
ege campus, a
nd s
o we had the opportunity to observe the reaction to
 
Folklore Studies on the part of a somewhat younger group of students,
 
mid-way, l
et u
s s
ay, between high school and college.  We a
ll f
elt the
 
spirit of eagerness and elation that emanated from these young people
 
with whore we rubbed shoulders.  Professor Hector Lee, Sonoma State College,
 
and for many years a member of the Committee on Accreditation for the
 
Western States, voiced everyone's interest and appreciation in some
 
brief remarks at the Business Meeting following the wonderful ethnic
 
Luncheon, cooked and s
erved by ARC folklore students who had learned the
 
recipes from towns-people in Sacramento and environs.
 
In this presentation Professor Lee made the point that Folklore
 
Studies can exert a salutary influence on the thought of young people at
 
the critical stage of their development as students and as citizens.  He
 
ended his remarks by hoping that fine pilot projects such a
s the one you
 
already have e
stablished at the American River College, under the able
 
direction of Marjorie McLain, might be attempted elsewhere in the State
 
of California, as well a
s in other areas served by the California Folklore
 
Society.  This s
uggestion met with the hearty approval of everyone present.
 
As t
he immediate Past President of the Society I should l
ike to
 
express my  appreciation to you and your colleagues in the American River
 
College for the f
ine Folklore Program you have launched, and to commend
 
to you the excellent l
eadership which Marjorie McLain has provided.
 
Yours sincerely

Just a brief note to congratulate you on a very wonderful meeting
 
of the California Folklore Society.
 
The program itself went off very well, for which we must thank
 
Roland Dickison and Marjorie McLain.  Your presiding at the Annual Banquet
 
and at the Business Meeting was one of the highlights of the whole
 
gathering.  The difficult matters to come before the Society could not
 
have been taken care of with such dispatch and goodwill but for your own
 
tact and grace.
 
The blind courtesy copy of my letter to President Boettcher tells
 
its own story.  It seems to me that by timely and judicious action the
 
California Folklore Society may be able to get Folklore Studies started
 
a bit earlier in the lives of our young students.  I think this would be
 
all to the good.
 
I trust that all goes well with you, and I look forward to seeing
 
you before too long.

Dear Bess:
 
9 May 1972
 
I meant to write this note before I left Sacramento, but
 
left it for the moment,  and since then its intention has
 
been buried under an extraordinarily large mountain of
 
desk work.
 
So to the point:
 It has been many y
_ears since I volun-
teered for any unpaid work, but I should like to serve
 
on the committee that will manage the transformation of
 
the California Folklore Society to the Western Folklore
 
Society.
 Can you manage to get me on the committee?
 
It was a joy meeting you at Sacramento,  and such a pleas-
ure meeting my other old friends.
 Joan ane I had a
 
marvelous vacation in the meetings and out.
 I was in
 
Sacramento a dozen--no,  longer than that--years ago,  and
 
the city has grown in beauty since.

American River College, Sacramento
 
-1-
The twentieth annual meeting of the California Folklore Society
 
was called to order at 2
:00 P
.M. by the President, Bess Lomax Hawes.
 
The minutes were dispensed with and the recording secretary reported
 
that the Society has a bank account with the Santa T
T
ionica Bank, Pico
 
Branch, totalling at present $441.50.  Mr. Lloyd Lyman of the Univ.
 
of Calif. Press, gave an interim report on the status of Western Folklore.
 
Mr. Lyman reported that we now have 849 subscriptions which includes
 
60 student members.  At present the deficit for the current year may
 
come to approximately X7,400.  Subject to an accounting review in July,
 
this deficit may be provided by the Editorial Committee of the Univ.
 
of Calif. Press.  A complete financial statement will be sent to Mrs.
 
Hawes in July by Mr. Lyman.
 
D.K. Wilgus gave the Editor's report.  Western Folklore has a
 
backlog of articles for at least one year.  Two special editions are
 
pla mied.  The matter of reviving the Sour Dough Crock was discussed.
 
Barbara LaPan was a nointed editor of the newsletter.  The subscription
 
rate will be $1.00, the monies to be collected seperately from that
 
of the Journal.  San Fernando Valley State College will subsidize the
 
newsletter for one year and the membership of the society will be sent
 
the first 4
. issues gratis.  After the first year, subscriptionsr
ldf
 
$1.00 a year will be solicited.
 
Mrs. Hawes discussed the problems of a declining membership.  She
 
will be sending out subscription blanks to the teaching members of
 
the society to give to the students and staff of their respective
 
institutions.  Scott B. Smith suggested that students traveling around
 
the country be given subscription blanks to distribute.  Sigmund Eisner
 
suggested that anyone who participates in the conference program must

Hector Lee proposed a vote of thanks to both the Unnversity of
 
California and the University of California Press for their generous
 
and continued support of the Journal.
 
D.K. Wilgus, representing the nominating committee proposed the
 
following slate:  Vice-President from the v
iorth, Marjorie McLain;
 
Student Vice-President from the North, Scott B. Smith;
 Student Vice-
President from the South, Barrie Polansky.� The slate was affirmed.

The matter of a host institution for our 1973 meeting in the
 
South was tabled for board action.  Information concerning details
 
of time and place will be announced as soon as possible, either in the
 
July issue of Z
Vestern Folklore or the September issue of the Crock. 
A motion was presented by Barbara LaPan:
 For the purpose of
 
historical records, we move that the California Folklore Society
 
initiate-
.a project in oral history to collect.from distinguished
 
members of our society (both east and present) who have made out-
standing contributions to the dicipline of folklore as well as to
 
the society itself.  The motion was ammended by Alan Dundes to
 
aonoint a committee to check with the AFS oral history people for
 
suggestions concerning coordination of such a project and report
 
to the membership at our next yearts meeting.
 
Sig Eisner proposed that the name California Folklore Society
 
be changed to the Western Folklore Society to follow the name of
 
the journal and encompass an extended geographical area.
 Hector
 
Lee made a sense of the meeting motion to confirm the position of
 
the membership in this matter by mail.  The motion was approved,

Dear Marjorie:
 
Our representative at the University of California Press (
who i
s also
 
honorary secretary-treasuser of the CFS), Mr. Lloyd G. Lyman,has recently
 
told me he will be able to attend the meeting at ARC on Saturday, April
 
29th.  Would you please send him post-haste a program, the maps of the
 
area, list of motels and all that useful informational packet you sent
 
me?  He can be addressed:
 
Lloyd G. Lyman
 
Assistant Director
 
University of California Press
 
2223 Fulton S
treet
 
Berkeley, California
 
94720
 
It's possible that, by now, he has received the routine mailing; however,
 
when I spoke to him last week, he hadn't, so I
'd appreciate i
t if you'd
 
double-check and mail him another.
 
Also, would you reserve a place for him at the l
uncheon?  He's coming as
 
m
y guest, and I will take care of the bill, i
f that's all right, when I
 
arrive.  I hope things are going smoothly.  See you in a week.
 
Hastily,

Dear Mr. Cummings:
 
I write on behalf of the Executive Board and the attending membership
 
of the California Folklore Society to express our appreciation for your
 
program of old-time fiddle music presented during the Society's luncheon
 
meeting at American River College on April 29, 1972.  The quality and
 
expert musicianship of your group was outstanding in my experience, and
 
many members commented on what a happy atmosphere your music provided
 
for us.  We are very grateful indeed for your participation in our meeting,
 
and I personally look forward to hearing you again on my next trip to
 
the Sacramento area.
 
By the way, I hope some of your members are teaching and working with the
 
"young ones".  I am sure Professor Marjorie McLain would know some students
 
who would like to learn real old-time fiddling and guitar playing.  Such
 
an important American style of music must be passed on, so that our grand-
children and great-grandchildren can get as much enjoyment out of it as
 
we do.
 
Very cordially yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

csngratulations for the excellent program you put together for the
 
recent meeting of the California Folklore Society at American River
 
College.  It was, I thought, an unusually fine meeting; the papers I
 
heard were thoroughly prepared and interesting, and you managed to get
 
a nice geographical distribution among the participants, not always an
 
easy task.
 
Please let me know how you came out financially, though I suppose you and
 
Marjorie McLain will have to get together over that problem.  However,
 
as you heard at the business meeting, if your expenses for such items
 
as the printed program (most particularly attractive, I thought) were
 
greater than your intake in registration fees, we have a treasury to
 
make up the deficit.  Should there be a surplus, a check for the amount
 
could be sent to Joan Ruman Perka
.l (our recording secretary and "real"
 
treasurer) at the Folklore and Mythology Institute, Bunche Hall, UCLA.
 
I am sure the rest of the Executive Board ,
joins me in offering congratu-
lations on a difficult ,
job extremely well done.  We greatly appreciate
 
all your efforts, and I hope that during the two days you found some time
 
in which to enjoy the meeting yourself as much as I did.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
President
 
California Folklore Society
 
P.S.  And thanks again to you and Mrs. Dickison for the pleasant after-the-
banquet gathering at your home.  It was a lovely way to end a somewhat
 
strenuous day.

Dear Wayland:
 
Just a note to thank you once again for your outstandingly warm and
 
wise speech at the banquet session of the recent CFS meeting.  It struck
 
exactly the note I had hoped for and in many ways drew us all together.
 
As I may have mentioned to you at the time, one person remarked to me,
 
"This is my very first meeting, but I already feel nostalgic!"  It is
 
good for us to come together both in argumentation and mutual agreement,
 
and you contributed mightily towards that end.  I still feel that perhaps
 
you were premature in saying that you thought your topic had already
 
been adequately covered in print.  Personally, I should like to see just
 
such an informal historical survey of the important features of past
 
CFS meetings as you presented appearing in Western Folklore. It is the
 
perspective and the personal element that you and Hector and such others
 
can provide that makes us realize that the printed page is just an echo
 
of the voices of human beings of substance and humanity.  Anyway, think
 
it over.
 
And again, thanks.
 
As ever,

Dear Marjorie:
 
Just a scandalously tardy note to join the no-doubt numerous others who have
 
written to congratulate you on the highly successful meeting of the California
 
Folklore Society on your campus.  I know from personal experience how much is
 
involved in the job of Arrangements Chairman, and I surely hope you feel the
 
results were worth all the time and effort required.  From the point of view
 
of an attending member, I can assure you they were; the meeting could hardly
 
have been more conveniently or more pleasantly managed.
 
I am enclosing a
t copy for your files of a letter I wrote President Boettcher
 
thanking him for making the campus facilities available, and also a letter to
 
the president of your Folklore Society, to the Old Time Fiddlers and to the
 
Camtia Dance Ensemble thanking them for their participation in the meeting.
 
I hate to add to your burdens at this point, but could you kindly forward
 
these last three along for me, as I do not have the proper addresses?  I should
 
like also to express the Society's appreciation to the artists who arranged
 
the displays and allowed their works to be shown -
- the sand paintings and
 
the work of the various Chicano artists stand out particularly in my memory,
 
but I unfortunately neglected to take note of their names.  Perhaps you could
 
think them for me (and for the Society); or if you think they would appreciate
 
a personal note, please send me their names and addresses and I
'll get letters
 
out to them right away.
 
I
've also written Mikie Chavez thanking her for her past year's service as
 
Student Vice-President and commending her for the panel presentation which she
 
managed finally to pull off in very excellent form, it seemed to me.  Overall,
 
I hope you're proud not only of yourself but of your students; they do you
 
much credit.
 
I
'll probably be in touch later about other business matters; Joan Perkal,
 
Barbara LaPan (on behalf of the Crock) and I are getting together next week
 
to pull together a list of suggestions for implementing the decisions made
 
at the business luncheon.  I
'll be sending copies of the minutes of the meeting
 
and other information out to a
_
11 the Board members within the month, I hope.
 
In the meantime, congratulations on your election as Regional Vice President,
 
a well-deserved honor.  I hope you will not find the duties too onerous, and
 
please keep in touch with me from time to time.
 
Cordially,

Dear Mikie:
 
This is just a note to thank you for your services this past year as Student
 
Vice President of the California Folklore Society.  I hope your going off
 
the board will not mean you will
. no longer keep in touch with the Society;
 
we need you.
 
I should also like to thank you for the efforts you put in to get the panel
 
on "Folklore: a Revolution in the Ethnic Community" together.  I realize
 
there were many problems involved, but it is a crucial topic and I am delighted
 
that the membership had a chance to hear it presented even if it had to be
 
in a prelinimary fashion.  As chairwoman and organizer, you did an excellent
 
j
ob, and I hope that we can schedule further discussions on this topic at
 
future meetings.  This one, in a sense, was an ice-breaker, and, as such,
 
of primary importance.
 
Barbara LaPan j
oins me in hoping you will get in touch with us when you
 
next visit Los Angeles, and if I can in the meantime be of any service to you
 
I hope you will call on me.

Dear President Boettcher:
 
I write -- unfortunately, most belatedly -- as representative of the
 
entire California Folklore Society to express our gratitude for the
 
gracious hospitality we received at your campus during our recent
 
annual meeting, April 28th and 29th.  The meeting was a great success
 
and will long be remembered by our membership both for its intrinsic
 
quality and as being our initial convocation at a community college.
 
The facilities were excellent -- the rooms convenient and well-equipped,
 
parking and similar logistic problems exceptionally well handled.  Most
 
of all, of course, we appreciated the enthusiasm and cordiality of your
 
students and attending faculty.  We were made to feel welcome by one and
 
all.  And m y I also comment that the participation of so many students
 
in such events as the dancing on the green on the 28th and the ethnic
 
luncheon on the 29th indicates a rare degree of involvement on the part
 
of your student body with the curriculum and the approach of your college.
 
The overall success of our meeting was in no sw
 » part due to the effi-
ciency and hard work of Professor Marjorie McLain of your faculty.  The
 
Society attempted to express its adm-ration for her capability and creative
 
energy by unanimously electing her to the Executive Board as one of our
 
four Regional Vice-Presidents.  I shall look forward to working with her
 
during her term of office, and I congratulate you on having such an out-
standing teacher �n your folklore faculty.
 
It was indeed a pleasure to visit your lovely campus, and I again thank
 
you for making it possible for us to gather there.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
President

Dear Bess,
 
.  FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA 9

April 20, 1972
 
I apologize for being so tardy in answering your letter.
 
The pressure of preparing for Folk Festival Week,  the Folk Musicians
 
series and Folklore Conference all at once is unbelievable.
 I
 
am beginning to see l
:
lt-N
nore clearly now,  so guess I
'll turvive.
 
I have arranged to have a table set up beside the registration
 
table on the Administration Building lawn for the display of Western
 
Folklore,  and I have received the sample copies and membership forms.
 
D
.  K
.  wrote to advise me that he would try to have someone to cover
 
it,  but  I don't see how that can be done long distance, and have
 
selected some responsible students to man the display until Dr.  Wilgus
 
decides to unseat them.
 
The problem with the membership list is indeed a great one.
 
Some of the people who recieved no information were not on the list,
 
probably as a result of their not being paid members at the time the
 
list was published.
 I don't know how old it is, certainly not more
 
than two years,  but there are many errors.
 I have tried to keep an
 
alphabetical file of corrected addresses for those who are coming
 
to the conference but have no way of knowing who should be on the
 
list but is not.
 Some people were not here.
 Dr.  Crowley,  for example,
 
was on sabbatical,  if I remember correctly.
 At any rate,  I see no
 
way of making up a correct list before the conference.
 Afterward, yes,
 
I can help with this problem.
 
Mikie has come out of the place where she was4 and I find
 
that she has been very ill,  so that  I now feel quite guilty about
 
being critical of her.
 However,  I am still a little apprehensive
 
about her patt in the program, as when I spoke with her last,  she
 
was still not quite certain about who would be speaking on the panel.
 
I am not going to worry about it.
 Everything else is going well, with
 
the exception of the possible problem of not having enough lunch for
 
everyone.
 If people would register in time, we could plan,  but with
 
late fees coming in, we may run short of food.
 One has to estimate in
 
advance.
 Ah,  well!
 There's always Colonel  Sanders!
 
I hope that you are feeling optimistic about things now, and
 
that you look forward to visiting here as much as we look forward to
 
having you.
 
Yours,

T
hat disturbed me in '
Washington was nrecisely 
,,
,T
hat ,
you desuribe--exaggerated concern over
 
copyrights and the protection of the
 profes-
sional folklorist, practically none for the
 
human rights of "the folk" whose privacy i
s
 
too often violated
. etc. etc.  That's why I
 
asked you to do this: to discuss exactly the
 
concerns you speak of, largely the question
 
of decent respect for informants and consid-
eration of the cui bono of folklore.
 
B
arre will touch on the more e
soteric matters
 
in connection with archiving, and I agree that
 
they are pretty peripheral, a
s I am sure he
 
does.
 
I think each of u
s should make a relatively
 
full statement .
for openers, with discussions
 
and questions following a
s Hector's contribu-
tion; otherwise there are likely to be pre-
ature distractions.
 
Now that we have l
earned that Angela Davis
 
i
s really "the Giant's Daughter," overwhelmed
 
by passion for a "Squire of Low Degree," we
 
should be able to rest easily about the future
 
u
ses of our discipline.  Folklore lives at the
 
heart of our legal system, and I don't know
 
wiether to laugh or cry!

Dear Bess,

'
,
'hat a dreadful year this is being for �
Tou--
there must be a special place being prepared
 
for you "among the tabernacles of the lord#
 
after su much sorrow.
 
Barre has agreed
_ to discuss the ethics of
 
archiving; it seems to me at present that
 
.
you could make the most useful contribution
 
in the area
, of collecting (
since I
've really
 
done none), leaving the area of teaching to
 
me (
in spite of the fact that I
've done prec-
ious little of that). If ,
you'd prefer to dis-
cuss teaching, though, I
'd b
,/e prepared to
 
swithh with the
 
nderstanding that My observa-
tions on ethica� ccncerns in collecting would
 
be on .
t theoretical level only.
 
In any case, may you return from w
}iat I Dope
 
is at least partly a holiday rested and in
 
,
rood spirits, and God bless.

Dear Marjorie:
 
Enclosed are the registration forms for me, Barbara and her fiance,
 
if that's not too old-fashioned a term.
 (
It does look rather passe,
 
doesn't it?)
 It appears that I will regretfully have to decline
 
your attractive hospitality for dinner on Thursday night, since I
 
can't arrive until Friday morning.  My problem is that I have a
 
seminar that meets until 6
:00 Thursday evenings; I had hoed to be
 
able to cancel it for the one session, but we are already far behind
 
my idealized time-table and need every minute we can get to complete
 
the semester's work.
 
So Barbara, Dennis and I will be arriving together; the two of them
 
plan to stay in the area visiting friends for the week-end, so they
 
will
. '
be renting a car at the airport, and I will hang a ride with them
 
to the meeting location.  You can expect us (or at
 me) at the
 
registration desk by noon, as I'd like to use that 12.
-CO to 2
;00
 
period to catch various people I need to.see.
 
Would it '
be possible for you to arrange to have Phil Sonnichsen's
 
plane met?  l
ie tells me he will come in on the earliest plane possible
 
Saturday morning, arriving at 9
;00 a
.ms he must also make the 5
:00
 
p.m. plane back that evening, as he works both Friday and Saturday
 
nights.  You should, then, count on him for lunch; perhaps you could
 
reserve a place for him and he could pay when he gets in, or else
 
send him a registration blank to fill in ahead of time, if you prefer.
 
His address is 3286 Sawtelle Boulevard, Apt, 1, Los Angeles 90065.
 
I really think you will find him worth all the nuisance.
 
I spoke to Mikey; she was most pleasant, accepted the suggestion of
 
Sonnichsen on the panel as a representative from the south, and
 
agreed to get the names of all panel participants to Roland by
 
Wednesday,  She also said she would get in touch with Barbara right
 
away -- in fact, she was so all-fired agreeable ] I decided not to
 
hassle about the panel title.
 I had mis-read it anyway.
 
I hope all the meeting plans are going smoothly; from here, it seem7, 
as though; it will be a most successful event, and I'm looking forward
 
to seeing you and other old friends.
 
Cordially

Dear Eleanor:
 
It suddenly occurs to me (
I ccem to 7
,o into and -
- occasionally -- out of a kind
 
of fob; these days) that I never answered yo,zr letter of a month ago to say, yes,
 
I will be happy to discuss the ethics of col:
l_ecting on your panel.  I really apolo-
gize for taking so 1on�; to do this simple thing.
 
There are a couple of problems, thoilgli, that I would like to raise with you in
 
advance.  I didn't really get clear what it was that disturbed you about the
 
equivalent discussion at the national meetings.  Since I
've heard about it from
 
no one except you, I don't have any kind of
 i
ide-lines as to what you feel should
 
or n
v
_ght well be emphasized or de-emphasized in our own production.
 
My personal feelings -- open to change and argument -- are that we should a
r
3dress
 
ourselves primarily to the level of the student and the amateur (meaning absolutely
 
no disrespect to either category) and only secondarily to the problems of the pros.
 
In other words, I would like to spend a minimum of time in my section discussing
 
the problems of copyright -- a technical, though clearly ethical, problem whic h
 
affects only one hundredth of a percent of our membership and V
lach is applicable
 
to nor more than one thousandth of a percent of the data collected.
 
Instead, I would feel it more useful to discuss what seem to me more general
 
problems: the responsibility of the collector towards the particular folk community,
 
towards the individual informant, towards himself, towards his discipline and --
if it doesn't sound
. too highfaluting -- towards the truth.  All these have to be
 
balanced in a particular kind of complex and probably always shifting hierarchy;
 
but I sometimes got the feeling
; that one or another of the elements go completely
 
unrecognized and that is, I believe, wrong.
 
All this may sound too moralizing to be tolerable, but personally, I feel that if
 
i
re are to discuss ethics, we should discuss ethical behavior, not just legal niceties.
 
As the current catch phrase goes, being a folklorist is a "heavy" job, and I think
 
its duties and responsibilities should be pointed out before people commit to it
 
seriously -- especially the young.  However, I quite realize you may have other types
 
of considerations in mind, and I
'd cheerfully slant my remarks in other directions that
 
might also need to be covered -- especially in light of your consideration of the
 
factors that were included or not included in the national panel.
 
If you get a moment sometime before too close to the meeting date, drop me a li?ae
 
on this; it might also help if you specified how you wanted to organize our mutual
 
efforts: should each of us make a brief opening statement and then argue, a longer
 
statement with questions to follow, or what?
 
With best rer
,ards,

Dear :
'urt:
 
I notice with reMret that you are not scheduled to read a paper at
 
the upcoming California Folklore :
Society meetings in aacramento.
 
Roland Dickison tells me he has written you asking you to chair one
 
panels you'll also be needed to report on your activities as nook
 
review editor for  W
estern Folklore. 
Do you suppose these two duties
 
will be sufficient basis for ,
you to jar loose some support monies.
 
from -
`YU?
 
.
111 this is in aid of my private campagn to enable and ensure the
 
attendance of as many senior scholars as possible at not only this,
 
but all future meetings.
 S
o
 many students remarked last year that
 
they had been counting on meeting and hearing Hector Lee, and I
 
discovered to my horror that .
t
iayland was thinking
: of not coming
 
until I managed to twist his arm and persuade him to make the banquet
 
address.
 I•m afraid he had gotten the feeling that he was not needed
 
or wanted any more, and I find that disgraceful.  The current gene-
ration is great, but, my Lord, wouldn't a 100' youth-attended meeting
 
be awful -- as they themselves would be the first to agree, I suspect.
 
)
o try to make its  just as old friends,  it would be so pleasant to
 
see you again.

January 27, 1972
 
Yesterday's visit with Roland Dickison brought me to
 
the realization that it is time to be getting on with
 
plans for the Spring Conference.
 Roland has a pretty
 
good program planned,  one that should attract considerable
 
interest, and I am hoping that the local arrangements
 
will be sufficiently different to keep the interest of
 
those who attend.
 I haven't received any word from you
 
regarding your attendance,  and while  I am not worried,
 
I am anxious to know when you will arrive, and if we
 
will have time to visit while you are here.
 I would
 
like to have you be my guest for dinner on Thursday
 
before the conference if it is at all possible for you
 
to come up that early.
 I am expecting Hector lee to
 
be here also, as he has graciously consented to speak
 
to my classes on that day.
 Let me know how your plans
 
look.
 
I also have another question .
.. a matter of some urgency
 
which I thought YOU  might be able to help me
, with.
 I am
 
planning to submit my request to the National Endowment
 
for the Humanities by February 10, a request, you will
 
remember, for funds to establish a community folk center.
 
I need to list in this request the names of several persons
 
who might serve as paid consultants at the time of the
 
organization of the center.
 I am looking for someone,
 
either faculty or student, who has considerable knowledge
 
about folklore in general and a special interest in folk
 
music.
 I
t must be contemporary music,  however.
 Does
 
that sound like a contradiction?
 I think you understand.
 
Perhaps you can recommend someone who would be willing
 
to send some personal information and whose consultant
 
fee would not be excessive, not more than $150 for a
 
weekend, not including expenses,  of course.
 Any firm
 
offer will come only after the grant has been approved,
 
of course.
 
Mikie will be getting in touch with you or Barbara soon.
 
I have convinced Roland that we need to save a block of
 
time on the program for students, and she has something
 
in mind.
 I hope that your year is progressing nicely,
 
and that you are planning some time with us.
 
Sincerely,
 
iNIO

Dear Bess:
 
November 15, 1971
 
I have taken some time to answer your letter inviting me to
 
give the banquet speech at the next California Folklore Society
 
Conference because I
've been thinking it o
ver.  And o
ver.  And o
ver.
 
Your beautiful and generous letter is a compliment that f
ew folklorists
 
could resist.  And I have recently been working (on a very o
ff-and-on
 
basis) o
n three things, any o
ne o
f which might be worth a talk: a folk
 
life study a
bout Southern Utah, some Micronesian tales, and a collection
 
o
f Legends o
f Fifty States.  But none o
f these studies is far enough
 
along to yield worthy substance without some more work, which I don't
 
have time for between now and April.  I only mention these topics here
 
o
ut of my respect for your good o
pinion of me: I don't want you to think
 
that I am o
ne o
f the "
hollow men" without any substance at all.
 
But I
've concluded t
hat I
'd rather not make t
he speech.  I love
 
t
he Society and always enjoy meeting its wonderful people o
n these
 
o
ccasions, but I am quite content to play a minor role.  I
've never
 
really wanted to be the star.  Now I f
ind that I am enjoying my
 
anonymity.  (Forgive me for going  .
nte this, but I want you to under-
stand.)  Until quite recently, for twenty years o
r so I have been
 
living five di:"ferent lives, any one o
f which has given me a
ll the
 
ego food I have deserved--college administration
., teaching English
 
literature, university accreditation o
n t
he regional and national levels,
 
folklore, and western history.  In my vanity I have taken satisfaction
 
from the fact that I have been j
ostled into l
eadership in all o
f t
hem,
 
and it is no doubt the same vanity that motivates mention o
f it here.
 
But one by o
ne I have been diminishing my visibility in four o
f them;
 
o
nly the teaching remains.
 
I have been called a folklorist, and in my way I t
hink I am o
ne.
 
But a
s I grow older I f
eel increasingly t
hat what I have to tell o
ther
 
folklorists i
s becoming less and less important.  Maybe I
'm j
ust a
 
drop-out.  But I
'm happy.  So let me come to t
he meeting, sit at a
 
back table, and enjoy the speech.
 
Yours,

Dear Bess...
 
Just a note to reassure you that all is not forgotten
 
up here in '
'uperior California..I had a very nice luncheon
 
meeting with Marjorie McLean, and we have agreed to hold
 
one session in  Old Sacramento ( it will cost $25 for the
 
use of a hall.. an art gallery
—but beneath is a wine
 
cdllar who will open for the Socidty Saturday afternoon,
 
serve house cheese and wine..each paying for his own .
.. I
 
resent the commercial attitude of both places, and we may
 
optout later .
.. Also, Marjorie was rather unfavorably inclined
 
to your idea of the Newsletter as a vehicle for meeting
 
announcement and call for papers..so  I placated her ( she
 
is so pretty, you know) and we have a joint mailing coming
 
out late this week or early next, using the list she has
 
(which she seems to cherish..at least I
've asked for it and
 
not gotten it —the list that is,). I still like your idea
 
and what wasin the back of myhead was that we could go ahead
 
reiterati
 
with your idea, ieeepppefa
' Ung call for Xpapers and P" 4
4
!ep4ng
 
rea€era
eg meeting details  that are not f
irm enough to be put
 
in next week's mailing. Q  o in line with that, I am enclosing
 
a clever macaronis I picked up in Guadalajara for possible
 
inclusion ( I should add that one of my chicano folklore students
 
claims there is a language called Calo, a mixture of Spanish
 
and -
'nglish used frequently by chicanos .
.. the topic may seem
 
a bit premature, but by the time you and I put together
 
a mailing Christmas will be close enough —don't you think?
 
Let me know what you think of all this...
 
yours

It was good to hear from you recently, and to learn of plans to bring
 
out the f
irst Newsletter.  I have sent you programs of the recent meetings of
 
the California Folklore Society, and of the Folklore and NVthology section of
 
the Southern California Acade W of Sciences, together with numbers of Jottings
 
from the. Field, the house organ of the UCIA Folklore and Wthology program.  I
 
shall continue to send these to you.
 
It will be a pleasure for me to continue on the committee with you.  I
 
have long been interested in state and regional folklore societies, and even
 
before I did the first set of histories way back in the 1
940's, I put together
 
a Directory of State and Regional Folklore Societies, which ran on Cover IV in
 
alternate numbers of the Journal of American Folklore when Ermine Voegelin was
 
editor.
 
I am making specific answer to questions raised in your recent letter,
 
and then sending copies of what I have sent to you to other people in California
 
who will be able to comment on the folklore scene elsewhere in the state.

Dear Bess...
 
This is just a progress note on the spring meeting, in case
 
youwake up at night and wonder what's happened, or not happened...
 
We have enough good rapers on hand to fill all but one session... which
 
is to say we need about 4 or 5 more —and I
'm sure we'll have them in
 
a week or so .
.. We have Wilgus, Brunvand, Tamony, Evans, a Polly Pope,
 
an Anderson ( Malaysia) and three of them use either slides or
 
movies, so the program should have variety.. I have also tentatively
 
lined up Ken and Maria Britbon, from Trinidad, to do Caribbean dances
 
and calypso for the evening program .
.. I saw them while in at Thomas
 
and they are authentic ( He's here just for the Year taking physical
 
therapy classes at SCC) and I
'm hoping we can spare an honorarium from
 
either the treasury or the registration fee.. I think $
25 will do it..
 
what is your reaction to this cheap innovation?
 
you
 
Also, I hope Eleanor Long has been in touch with concerning
 
a proposed panel discussion on the ethics of collecting etc. She bent
 
my ear at length on the phone last month and I have prevailed upon Hector
 
Lee to serve as moderator. Eleanor says you will join and she will provide
 
at least two others .
.. this lively battle will be at 3 on Friday, to
 
allow all to bury the hatchett incocktails at 5 —I've checked with the
 
Caravan and they have no objection to our serving wine with dinner,,, and I
 
plan to get a local winery to donate enough so that no one will notice
 
how bad the program is..we still plan to work Old Sacto in Saturday
 
afternoon... but if we don't get more papers, rather than hold a session
 
there, we'llr make it a tour.  .
... let me hear from y
,ou, particularly as
 
suggest 
W

Dear Bess:
 
Excuse my replying to la--t letter so tardily; it's
 
tares this long to get t
;?pewriter. I sold mine last
 
fall to finance the sabbatical, and Reagan has cut
 
funds so here that we could buy no new ones. I finally
 
found one to bor�ow fro, a colleague.
 
Marjorie McLean and I ha-
.
-e had several talks, and
 
I sent to D
.K. Wilgus the gist of planning so that
 
hopefullil, he could insert in the Ocotober issue of
 
W
.F.
 I haven't heard from him, so I assume he got
 
it and could read it. I
'm not too pleased f
rith the
 
arrangements; ARC will be alright for she meetings
 
and Marjorie has worked hard toset up the rest, but
 
as of ,
-ow we are slated to have a banquet at the
 
C
aravan Inn, a t
T
,nical motel type of place and some
 
five miles from ARC. I had hoped to per�udde her to
 
use the convention facilities here at SSC, where all
 
could room and meet and eat conveniently in one spot,
 
but I gather it's a matter of pride with her to have
 
ARC sponsor, so I didn't push too hard. She and I
 
discussed the mat er of a banquet speaker, and ag reed
 
that if we could come with a lively dance group of
 
natives, or something similar, that perhaps we could
 
dispense with a formal address. How do you feP1 about
 
it?  Perhaps as a new prexy you'd like the platform
 
to discuss the past and future of CFS
 .
.. that would
 
seem entirely appropriate to me.
 
One other problem appears. How do I get a
 
distfibution list to send out the call for papers?
 
Do you have it? or Berkeley?  Reacting to last year's
 
static we cut dorm the number of sessions and reduced
 
reading time a b
it. I hope t
'-is meets with presidential
 
approval. I look forward to hearing from  you.

Dear Roland:
 
I
'm enclosing a l
ittle offset print newsletter which D.K. Wilgu s passed on to me
.
 
His idea was that i
f we c
annot l
ocate either an editor nor proper financing f
or
 
the real old-fashioned kind of Sour Dough Crock this year, perhaps such a single-
sheet production might be i
ssued.
 
It then occurred to me t
hat we might consider using a similar format i
nstead of
 
the usual d
ittoed call f
or papers i
n connection with the 1
972 meeting; and send
 
i
t out as a kind of Sour Dough Crock, Junion Edition, or the Interim Crock, or
 
some such.  This would, i
t seems to me, have several advantages.  First, i
t would
 
keep the Crock alive until we c
an figure out some way to f
inance i
t on a continuing
 
basis.  Second, i
t would produce a metting announcement which people might n of
 
l
ose (
read: throw away) as quickly as i
t seems they d
o t
he dittoed communiques.
 
Thirdly, i
t could combine all the necessary information i
nto one package: l
ocal
 
arrangements information, call f
or papers, approximate schedule of the meeting,
 
etc., saving time, trouble and the expense involved in multiple mailings.  Fourthly,
 
I think the Association could finance the costs involved; we have a small treasury,
 
and this would, I think, be a good use f
or i
t, particularly if you have a printing
 
shop at your c
ampus that might give us a good rate.
 
What do you think?  I
t may be just too much work f
or y
ou, or you may already be
 
committed to the other s
tyle of program announcement.  If you should cotton to
 
the idea, though, I
'd be glad t
o send some appropriate news i
tems from the s
outhern
 
sector and maybe even s
ome bad j
okes -
- though no one c
ould equal Hector's perform-
ance in that sector -
- i
f you need space filler.
 
I just today received your letter of September 2
1st.  D
.K. and I had already worked
 
up a brief and unspecific announcement for the October i
ssue of Western Folklore
 
some weeks ago, so something will appear therein, I should s
ay.  As f
or the arrange-
ments, I agree with you that the motel type of setting i
s depressing, and I had
 
hoped that some more interesting arrangement could be made; but I a
lso agree that
 
Marjorie McLain i
s extremely sensitive, and I can understand your reluctance to
 
push too hard.  Some time I
'll tell you about the hassles at the Fullerton meeting.
 
As for the banquet, by all means l
et us not have a speaker unless we c
an find a
 
really outstanding one, which d
oes not include me.  I am perfectly willing to preside,
 
but would prefer to confine my efforts to trying t
o remember the names of everyone
 
who will have to be introduced  -
- a sufficiently traumatic prospect since I have
 
been known to f
orget my husband's name when hard-pressed.
 
Concerning the distribution list, I asked Berkeley to send one to Marjorie McLain
 
a month ago, since she was worried about the same problem.  If s
he hasn't gotten
 
i
t by now, l
et me know and I will build a fire under them.  You will probably want
 
to cull i
t, eliminating i
nstitutions and t
hose subscribers who l
ive on the East
 
Coast; otherwise, i
t s
hould probably (
if you go along with my suggestion for
 
a combined mailing) be sent to _
just about everybody.  Some harsh words were
 
passed at Fullerton because some people had not received the call f
or papers.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Hawes
 
P.S.  I am back on the campus now, and perhaps some of these problems could be
 
more conveniently discussed.via the tie-line.  My schedule revolves around
 
MWF, with an occasional Th, and I
'm ordinarily on deck in my office between
 
9
:00 and 1
1:00 a.m.; other times at your own risk.  My number here i
s 885-3329.

Dear Marjorie:
 
Thank you so much for your two recent letters.  As you can see by the enclosed
 
report, we are practically all set, and D.K. Wilgus and I have written a tenta-
tive annoutcement which will appear in the October issue of Western Folklore, 
a
ssuming we hear no objections f
rom anybody.
 
I am also enclosing for your consideration two l
etters which have reached me
 
touching on the arrangements problem.  The first i
s exerpted f
rom a l
itter
 
f
rom Wilgus (
the biboace of which concerned Western Folklore, so I didn't bother
 
to xerox i
t).  The second i
s a note f
rom Sig Eisner, a copy of which I have
 
already sent Roland Dickison, since program planning i
s also involved.
 
My own view of Sig's recommendations i
s that they represent a constructive out-
l
ine of what needs to be done, the doing of which i
s another problem.  Almost
 
everybody, in my observation, tries to be as f
ore-handed as he suggests, but in
 
a volunteer association with little or no help available
., matters tend to get
 
delayed and all too frequently simply balled up.
 
I do, however, have to take i
ssue with him on the overall f
inancial problem.  The
 
Society has attempted as f
ar as possible in the past to make i
ts meetings self-
supporting by two i
nethods: charging
, a small registration f
ee (
the setting of which
 
i
s left up to the arrangements cotm Uttee together with the program chairman, as
 
they are the people spending the money); and sponging as far as humanly possible
 
off the good offices of the host institutions.  Program printing can sometimes
 
be absorbed by the sponsoring college, f
or example, as can mailing costs. We do
 
have a small bank account for back-up purposes though, so if you need funds, please
 
let me know as plans develop.  Historically speaking, as f
ar as I know, we have
 
been able to operate our meetings without a deficit for the past four years;
 
Fullerton actually turned a small profit.
 
As soon as I don't hear f
rom the various officers who are receiving the enclosed
 
notice of the forthcoming meeting (
that is, in about ten days), I shall write your
 
president an official acceptance of your campus's hospitality, and another to you
 
that you can put in your file or show people or light a small bonfire with as you
 
like, and the show will be officially on the road.  I shall also continue to send
 
you and Roland copies of any ocrrespondence I receive pertaining to next year's

Dear Sig:
 
Thank you very much f
or your thoughtful l
etter of criticisms and suggestions.
 
I am sorry that I haven't replied before, but I have been up to my eyebrows in
 
all those matters which coincide with the Ides of June -
- a disastrous date
 
in academia, a
s we all know.
 
I have f
orwarded copies of your letter to next year's arrangements and program
 
chairmen f
or their consideration and guidance.  I
'm also enclosing f
or your
 
information my f
irst general communique on the state of the Society's affairs.
 
As you will see, we are being a bit more f
ore-handed this year, but i
t has
 
still taken an appaling amount of time to get the show on the road.  I
'll
 
get better at my end of things as I go along, I suppose, but by the time I
 
become really efficient, I will be sinking gratefully (
if not gracefully) into
 
the role of past president.  So i
t goes.
 
Anyway, I do thank you f
or taking the time and trouble to set down your sug-
gestions so clearly and carefully, and I hope, if any more i
deas occur to you,
 
you will send them along post-haste.  I will see to i
t that they reach the
 
proper people; the more thinking that we all do about the Society, the
 
better i
t will be.
 
I see in a note f
rom Wilgus that he har, asked you to be a regional editor of
 
Western Folklore. I hope you have accepted; you would be a good one.  Have a
 
good summer, and I
'll l
ook f
orward to seeing you in Sacramento, if our paths
 
don't cross before.

Dear Bess:
 
2 May 1
971
 
After all my abrasiveness at Fullerton I thought it only right and
 
courteous to set down for you the suggestions concerning 1972 which I
 
brayed at our recent business meeting.
 These are as follows:
 
For the 1972 meeting the Local Chairman,  the Program Chairman, and
 
their committees should be picked by May or June 1971.
 The Local
 
Chairm an must initiate rooms and hotel space almost immediately so that
 
later disappoirtnents and conflicts are avoided.
 If possible, he should
 
get a rate.
 The Program Chairman should send out a call for papers in
 
the Fall of 1971.
 This call should go to all of the membership.
 If
 
funds are short he co uld use bulk mail or atte: pt to place his announcement
 
into ,V
estern Folklore. 
That last would have to be checked t
�xough with
 
the Editor.
 If it is at all possible, the call for papers should include
 
whatever local arrangements have been made.
 Moderators and chairmen
 
should be instructed to cut off a paper that runs too long.
 A tight
 
schedule is not, of course, the sine non qua of a successful meeting,
 
but it does help.
 Neither members of the Program Committee nor those
 
of the Local Committee should appear on the program.
 However, it is
 
conceivable to keep one or two in the wings to deliver a paper in place
 
of someone who unexpectedly failed to show up or to read a paper written
 
by someone absent.
 The people who are on the program should reflect
 
the distribution of the membership.
 Last month I was disturbed by the
 
emphasis placed on UCLA and former UCLA people.
 The California Folklore
 
Society should tell the PrograLl Chairman just how much he may spend P*r
 
his mailings, telephone calls, etc.
 Then about February or March 1972
 
the printed program, including the final local arrangementspshould be
 
mailed out -- again to all members.
 
I do not write these suggestions to slander anyone connected with
 
our recent program.
 It was a good program, although parochial.
 The
 
fact is that UCLA puts out good people, and these good people were
 
tapped for the program at Fullerton.
 But the Southern California members
 
can meet any time they want and read papers to each other
..
 What I would
 
like to see is people from all over the area served by the California
 
Folklore Society bring their contributions and feel that their contributions
 
are welcomed.
 
You have r
ay permission, if you wish,  to copy this letter for the
 
Board Members, Program Chairman, Local Chairman, and others.  But these
 
are only suggestions, not complaints, and I send them to .
you with
 
absolute good will.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Roland:
 
'
-1
 
I am sorry not to have replied to your letter sooner, but I have been waiting for
 
plans to f
irm up.  It appears now that the week-end of April 2
£3-29th i
s the beat
 
for American River College, so I am sending the enclosed notification around to
 
the officers of the Society.  If nobody squawks back to me within a week, I shall
 
assume the date and place are satisfactory and we will go ahead as outlined.
 
I do not think you need trouble yourself f
urther at the moment with Program
 
Chairman-ing.  Sending out a call f
or papers or such before next fall would seem
 
a waste of time and stamps; and D.K. and I have already taken the l
iberty of
 
preparing; an announcement to be included in the forthcoming i
ssue of Western
  
Folklore (
October?).  However, I think you should know that there was a little
 
f
lak at the Fullerton meeting -- nothing hurtful,  j
ust enough to keep things
 
l
ively -
- initiating f
or the most part f
rom Sig Eisner, who l
ater on wrote me
 
his recommendations in some detail.  I a
nt enclosing a xerox of his l
etter for
 
your consideration.
 (
I have also sent a copy to Marjorie Dasch, who writes me
 
that f
or various reasons she now wants to be known f
ormally as Professor Marjorie
 
W. McLain.)
 
Some of the problems Sig raises warrant, perhaps, a few more comments.  Concerning
 
financial support of the meetings by the Society, the general rule of thumb, I
 
gather i
s that the Society expects to sponge off the host institution as far as
 
i
t i
s at all possible to do so; but we do now, at least, have a backlog fund in
 
the unfortunate event that we should have to pay any of our own bills.  We trust
 
you and Professor McLain will do your best for us, as I really hope to be able
 
to get the Crock back into operation and we will have to do i
t without Hector
 
Lee's f
inancial assistance.  Please let me know, though, what the financial out-
l
ook i
s as things begin to shape up.
 
Regarding Sig's discussion of the program, what he means i
s that the meeting was
 
more or l
ess dominated by UCLA and featured anthropologically-oriented papers.
 
The A.R.C. people also seemed to feel there was not enough student participation.
 
My own view was that i
t was an unusually high-calibre meeting, but then I am one
 
of those who don't much care whether I am l
istening to a Berkeley student or a
 
scholar of comparative l
iterature or a Malinowskian anthropologist so l
ong as
 
they have something interesting to say.  I realize this i
s not a proper presidential
 
attitude and I shall restrain myself in future.  Clearly, we should do our best to
 
have representation f
rom north and south, anthropology and l
iterature and plain old
 
dirt folklorists as well as students.  I am sure it will all shape u
p, as i
t always
 
Y 
does, and if I can be of any conceivable help to you, l
et me know.
 
I also feel I should assure you that whether you wish to be assisted by a
 
program committee i
s totally and entirely up to you; s
ome people like committees
 
and some don't,  please feel quite f
ree to use your own discretion.  Should I
 
happen to hear of ideas that might begin to burgeon around here, I shall f
orward
 
them along to you.
 
I hope you're having something of a vacation and that i
t's a good one.  I will
 
be in touch with you in September.
 
Cordially,

later than it would have; by regular airmail, which

took the first boat out of the coun -,

As forthe job of Progran
, Chairman, of course
 
I accept and will do the best I can. I think %
%our
 
idea of heving Margery Dasch on the committee a very
 
good one. She isnot only enthusiastic, but vary
 
attractive and should be pleasant to work with.
 
I didn'tknow about working so with Geor; es in 69
 
but if I remetaber rightly I worked closely with
 
Alany( Duddes in 64. I hope you will feel free to
 
take whatever initiative is ap-,

that I won't be on the scene until Je',tember. We

Dear Eleanor:
 
Th.
jnk you very i
mtch for your note about Marjorie Dash.  I am also
 
looking forward to secing at first hand what she and her students
 
are doing, and I very much hope they will consent to play a major
 
part in the 1972 C
e
ti mectings.
 
As I see the problem and as I tried, to explain
. to Professor Dash at
 
Fullerton, if she actually wanted to be program chairman
., she used
 
the wrong strategy in offering her campus facilities for the meeting.
 
I myself feel very strongly that the local arrangements chairman and
 
the program chairman should not be the same individu�I, partly
 
because of -the work load involved, but mostly because in such a
 
loo:
 ely knit organization as CPS I think it is abs
 olute1y vital to
 
spread the responsi
.bi
.li
.ties (
and the honors and the chores) among
, as
 
many different individunIs and institutions as po.,,sible.  If there
 
is one thing; that CFS members are .
sensitive to, I
've noticed, it's
 
the mere appearance that any single institution might be considered
 
to dominate the proceedings (viz. S
i
.f; I
,isner's speech at 1
*
'ullerton,
 
when, in addition to being annoyed
. at UCLA, he was also even irritated
 
by Evan's putting himself in his own program) .
 
Since Professor Dash so efficiently contacted her president and got
 
permission to offer th
.e A.R.C. c
ampus for the '
72 meetings w
l�il
.e we
 
were still at Yullerton, it would seem ungraceful for the society -t
o
 
withdraw now.  l
i
ly own notion is that the best thing; to do at this
 
point is to locate a
. new program chairman reasonably near the A.R.0
 
campus and suggest to him (her) that A.R.C. personnel be drawn into the
 
program planking in
, soi
;ie mutually agreeable fashion.  I really don't ,
s
ee
 
why this can't be done, to the satisfaction of a1w
1
. parties; Bob Georges and
 
I
: worked together in just that was a few years ago, and from my point
 
of view, at least, the interaction was most healthy.
 
-2-
Like you, I was very impressed by the
. energy and po re of the ARC
 
students and by what _
little I had t
ime t
o gather about their prograra;
 
and I tried to tell them so as plainly as poss:iblc before we parted.
 
I hope they got the message.  From your perspective in hanta Clara,
 
however, you may see the whole situation differently that I do;
 
perhaps we can get toLether sometime Saturday during the Occidental
 
meetings and talk it over?

I
'd like to urge that 1

in terms of invit—

and I for one would really like to s
ee what her s

I can't see theft any harm could be done by such an experiment, and I thought

D
ear Eleanor:
 
Thank you f
or your l
etter of April 20, 1
971.  I can well understand your
 
reasons for suggesting that Marjorie Dash b
e made program chairman for the 1972
 
meeting of t
he California Folklore Society.  Certainly, she and her students made
 
themselves known and h
eard at the r
ecent meeting; and I concur t
hat the students
 
f
rom American River C
ollege have some good ideas for the program and strong
 
motivations for doing a good j
ob of it.
 
D
espite there facts, however, I a
:
:
: somewhat reluctant to s
ee a relative new-
comer to t
he soci
.etv.(and apparently to folklore a
nd mythology studies a
s well)
 
g
iven full r
esponsibility for such an ambitious and d
ena
.nding undertaking a
s that
 
of program chairman.  To r
ry knowledge, Miss (Nss.?) Dash has n
ever b
efore attended
 
a meeting of t
he C
3
.3, nor has she participated in t
he busines> of t
he Society prior
 
to t
his year.  Since planning a
. program involves much more than having a group of
 
enthusiastic students who a
re willing to help and to provide suggestions for program
 
s
essions, I f
eel that Miss Dash should not b
;
, appointed program
s c
hairman for the.
 
1972 meeting.
 
As a possiUle con
 i
proriise to your request, I suggest s
everal alternatives:  (
1)
 
t
hat Marjorie Dash a
nd t
he students at American River College be a
sked, by the
 
appointed program c
hairman, to plan s
everal sessions and to b
e responsible for
 
(a) recruiting people t
o participate in them, (
b) evaluating and s
electing papers
 
and speakers for those s
essions, and (
c) planning and structuring those sessions
 
for which t
hey are r
esponsible; o
r (
2) that there b
e no cne program chairrian f

Professor Marjorie Dasch#
 
Department of English
 
American River College
 
Sacramento, California
 
Dear Marjorie Da
.schs
 
Apparently there has been some confusion.
 I had gathered from Bar-
bara and Mikey that you would he letting me know what the American
 
River College schedule was for next spring and which week-ends
 
might be most convenient for scheduling the spring
_
, California
. Folk-
lore Society meetings at your campus, as we had arranged to at Ful-
lerton.
 Since I
've heard nothing, it has finally dawned upon me
 
that perhaps you are waiting to hear from me which weekends  I think
 
the Society might prefer.
 So much for the comnunteations gap;  let's
 
ignore it, shall we?
 
I have checked both SFVSC and UCLA spring calendars for 1972.
 The
 
former shows spring vacation as running from March 25 to April 3rd,
 
Faster Sunday being April 2nd.
 The intermin between the winter and
 
spring quarters in the University of
. California system is from March
 
20th to March 30th, which seems improbable, but I have checked it
 
twice.
 ®t appears to i
ne,  then,  that any week-end in April, other
 
than the first, would do quite nicely.
 It has proven, in the past,
 
disastrous to compete with Easter.
 
My own preference would be for the week-end of April 21-23;  I think
 
many students and professors begin to get slightly neurotic about
 
their varying time-pressures,  the closer they get to May.
 April
 
14-16 would be my second choice and April 28-30 my third.
 however,
 
any of the three would be practical, so far as I am aware.
 Can you
 
check your schedule and let me know what suits your campus facilities
 
best?  Once this is agreed upon informally,  I shall write two nice
 
formal letters -- one to you and another to your president -- offi-
cially accepting your kind hospitality, and we can get the show on
 
the road, possibly even in time to get it announced in the fail
 
issue of Western Folklore.
 
By the way,  I have written Roland Dbckison informally enquiring if
 
he would serve as program committee chairman, and he has  (also in-
formally) accepted with pleasure and says he looks forward to working
 
with you.
 He will be back from i
Kexico in Septembers  I am writing
 
him that it doesn't seem necessary to put out a call for papers be-
fore that time.
 He will no doubt ba in touch with you on his return
 
or before about that and other

matters.
 
pleasant visit with you and your
 
forward to the same, at least next
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Loinax Hawes
 
P
.S.
 Once we get this dat business settled.  I
'll be sending along
 
some suggestions I have received from various Society members con-
cerning
; meeting schedules, expense problems, meals and so forth.
 
This is exam week hereabouts, and I haven't had time to dig them
 
out of wherever I put them= but I gather from Barbara that you an(]
 
your people have already come up with some exciting sounding ideas.
 
From the remarkk she made about multi-ethnic foods,  I should start
 
dieting right now....

Dear Sam:
 
I hope you will accept my most abject apologies for writing this l
etter -so
 
late; the press of ending the semester plus a couple of family tragedies
 
combined to put me terribly far behind.  I don't know if you knew Butch's
 
brother, Peter Hawes -
- the one who l
ived in Puerto R
ico -
- but this spring
 
he was s
truck by a horse whose rider l
ost control, jumping a barrier a
t a
 
horse show and falling full on to Peter, with the result he will apparently
 
be paralyzed for l
ife.  He i
s now in the Rusk Institute in New York; I went
 
there in early June and s
pent a couple of weeks doing what I could.  I
mmediately
 
after, my own brother .
John's wife, `
dar7atet, died in Houston.  She had been
 
i
ll for a very l
ong time, but i
t was s
till a tough one, especially s
ince
 
John hasn't recovered a
ll his memory from that devastating heart attack
 
he suffered almost two years ago.
 
Anyway, the purpose of this l
etter was not to spread g
loom but to express
 
my personal and official appreciatkon for the great job you did i
n arranging
 
j
dhe program f
or the California Folklore Society meeting in Dominguiz Hills.
 
I myself though the meeting was outstanding; i
t was a f
ine balance of young
 
ones coming up with s
olid contributions from some of the old-timers.  Many
 
people besides myself a
lso commented favorably on the physical appearance of
 
the program as well as the usefulness of the abstracts.  Anyway, you are my
 
very favorite program chairman, and i
t's probably as well that I
'm s
tepping
 
down as president, or you'd get called on a
ll too often for your own good.
 
So, my l
ove and respects to both you and Leslie.  If :
dick actually does l
ocate
 
a job in the San Diego area, I suspect there will be more comings and goings
 
on my part in your direction; besides, John and N
aomi dote upon the San Diego
 
Zoo, so we'll hope to be seeing you one of these days.
 
Affectionately a
lways,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

sear Alan:
 
I spoke recently with Roland Dickison re ardin6 the plans for the CFS z
ieetings
 
in the sprin", and he responded favorably to a su;
estion I made for
 par:el
 
that had previously been su Lested to me by Barbara ►nPan.  It see.as that while
 
she was in the east , she went to an all-day discussion meeting on careers In an-
thropology, in which all the speakers were people who had had anthropological
 
training which they-
 were now p
 uttin; to u
se in careers other than teaching;
 an �
,hro .
 
This sounded to me like an in:
.
.eresting idea for  '
olklorists, and possibly stimula-
tin1;, not to say reassurin,_
;, to our current crop oi'
L
 yaduate students.  I was
 
thinki.
n
;
_
;, for instance , that we could have social and recreation workers , editors
 
and researchers (Ed Cray conies to mind
. here )
, paramedical people
 anybody who
 
has hai a reasonable a
iao°unt of folklore traininL; and who i
aiyht be willing; to speak
 
briefly on how the discipline has been of use to ihetl in their current pro
.session.
 
The problem is, of coarse, to think up some people to ask.  I
've already sa& ested
 
Ed Cray; Barbara (who visited Jimmy Driftwood this past summer and who is currently
 
doing a similar, though small-scaled,  s
ob o

Dear Bess:
 
Well, I wasted a week trying to get thru to you on the tie
 
line..I say wasted because the operator tells me now my phone isn't
 
tied in..I have to go thru department head..have you met this
 
particular inanity there yet?
 
I like your idea of the Interim Crock as a means of annogncement
 
and call for papers. I think we could do it here for less than $50
 
and I welcome receiving news i
tems such as you mentioned. I could
 
mail you the rough draft before it goes to press and we achieve
 
some coordiatt6n2.I'll try to get the tie line bit straightened
 
out.
 
I talked again to Marjorie McLain about the arrangements,
 
but didn't get anywhere. I was trying to  persuade her to have
 
at least one meeting in OldSacramento ina picturesque art gallery
 
with a cocktail party aboard the Delta King.moored nearby in the
 
Sacramento River...she wasn't very receptive, but we still may
 
work something out. She does have plans for four wagons and s
tudent
 
drivers which should help things along, and probably many people
 
will stay at he Caravan so atleast Friday night will be little pain
 
of traveling. Perhaps we can arrange tours of Old Sacramento for
 
Sunday morning for those who would stay over and include a visit
 
DNQ University over at Davis (which I
've not seen yet, and which
 
may be dead by that time). I
'll talk to Marjorie again tonight;
 
we're trying to  set upa visit to Hector Lee and it's difficult
 
without the t
ie line.
 
Tuesday, Oct 12.. just talked again to Marjorie and now we've
 
worked out an interesting possibility.. after the lunch on Saturday,
 
we can adjourn ( with the help of 4 station wagons plus whatever cars
 
people came in) to the Old Sacramento area and meet in the Art
 
Gallery in the heart of the restoration area, and f
inish off with
 
or cocktails about 4 or 5
-.does that sound all right?
 
then would have the s
chedule about like this

That is all t
entative, subject to your reaction, and Ism doing
 
it from memory, rather than notes, which are home —but basically
 
it involves f
ive sessions of papers, six papers in each s
ession
 
of about 12 minutes with 3 minutes discussion.. if most of the
 
delegates stay at  he Caravan there should be less trouble with
 
transportation —so far we have four members of the program

'll list on a draft copy which I
'll send

Subject:  Interim report on the state of the Society
 
1
.  The 1
172 meetiatg of the California Folklore Society will be held on the
 
caripus of the American River College, 4700 College Oak Drive, Sacramento,
 
at the hind invitation of President Douglas Burris.  The session
•, are currently
 
b
se::ng planned for the ve*k-end of April 2S-29th.  Though this i
s a slightly
 
lat=er date than our meetings usually take place, our A.R.C. hoots report
 
that other scheduled conferences prevent our using their facilities at an
 
earlier time, and I can f
ind no serious conflict i
n any of the academic
 
calendars available to a
re.  Should anyone see i
any major objection to this
 
schedule, I urge you to get in t
ouch with we immediately, as the plans
 
should be firmed up so that an announcaaar
.t can be i
ssued in the October
 
i
ssue of Western Folklore.

.  You will, I a
s
sn sure, be pleased to hear t
hat the Society's rumored bank
 
account i
s indeed a reality, cad that i
t has grown under Hector Lea's stewardship
 
into a nice l
ittle nest egg amour
.tin3 to almost $450.80.  Since Lloy4 Lyman,
 
our new Secretary-T
reasurer, has announced t
hat he has his hands full with our
 
page 2
 
various Press problems, I have taken the unilateral s
tep of appointing Joan
 
Perkal (
Recording Secretary) as a kind of co-Treasurer, an action which I
 
hope will be ratified at our next business meeting -- and a better title
 
thought up.  Until '
C
hen, an account has been opened in the name of the Society,
 
with Mrs. Perkal and myself l
isted as depositors.  Since the Fullerton
 
meeting actually recul
.ted in a small profit, and none of the previous meetings
 
to my knowledge were deficit operations, we may be able to devote some of
 
this money to getting
, the Sourdough Crock back into operation.  I have been
 
consulting on this problem with D.K. Wilgus, Wayland Nand and Ed Cray, and
 
will keep you informed as plans develop.
