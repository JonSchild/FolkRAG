     Background noise:  The Local IWU 63 headquarters can be a bit noisy and this can be heard 
in the background.  It's an industrial building for the most part, so the cooling and heating system 
is a regular problem.   Occasionally, the building even generates a line noise that is impossible to 
keep off the recording.  Sometimes you can also hear people in the office section talking and 
laughing or somebody will walk into the room.

00:01  Introduction:  I’m Bucky Halker and . . . .  
 
  ______ [Rich, just to start, why don’t you tell me when you were born, where you 
born….personal and family background so we have that.]  I’m a lifelong Chicagoan.  I was born 
at Columbus Hospital in Lincoln Park in May of 1952. I grew up on the west side of Chicago in 
the Garfield Park neighborhood.  My family has been in the Chicago area since the Civil War.  
Most of them lived in the southwest side of the city, in Clearing, Illinois, which was incorporated 
into the city in the 20s or 30s.  I still have quite a few family members in the Chicago area.  I 
became an ironworker in 1970 when I graduated high school.  My girlfriend at the time thought 
it was a good idea to get married.  I was looking for a job and I was fortunate enough that an 
uncle of mine was an ironworker and he recommended that I take the test for the apprenticeship.  
I had no idea what ironworkers did.  He said that they buildings and I said I didn’t know 
anything about that.  And he says, “that’s what you go to an apprenticeship for.  They teach 
you.”  I took the test in 1970 and I was fortunate enough to get in.  Its been my career ever since.  
This is my 41st year as an ironworker.   
 
1:37   [In all that time…  Tell me about maybe your first job and what you did and some of the 
stuff after that.  How you ended up where you are now.]  I remember my first job was working at 
the IBM Building.  It was being erected on the corner of State Street and the Chicago River.  It 
was a Mies van der Rohe building.  I was working at the curtain wall gang.  Curtain wall is 
basically the metal skin on the exterior of the building.  We were installing the metal panels and 
frames and later glaziers would come in and put the glass in it and create the exterior wall of the 
building.  On my first day, they took me up in the elevator and the elevator door opened up.  The 
elevator being on the exterior of the building – the man hoist.  It went up about 30 floors.  They 
opened up the doors of the elevator.  There was a plank going from the elevator to a beam.  I was 
18 years old, it was my first day…and, you know.  I kind of froze there for a minute.  Everyone 
was behind me and they were saying, “Come on, kid…let’s go, let’s go.”  And so I reckoned I 
might as well do it and I did it.  It is definitely something that anybody in their right mind 
anyway could just jump in right away.  But you get used to doing that.  Eventually, I actually 
liked working up high.  You always had to be aware of where you were at.  You have to be 
conscious of your surroundings.  But other than that, it is quite thrilling.  On some days, quite 
pleasant and on other days, not too pleasant at all.  [Because of weather…]  Because of weather, 
wind, and everything else.  But if it’s a nice day and its beautiful out, there’s no place you’d 
rather be.  Other times.  January when it’s was windy or snowing or sleeting.  It could be pretty 
miserable.  [Are there any rules that regulate that, like with the wind?  Or do you just play it by 
ear?]  We have…  Ever since I’ve been an ironworker, contractually – in our union contract, 
CBA there is a two-hour show up time.  If you show up on the job and you’re ready to work, 
you’re paid for two hours.  Quite often you go to work and if it’s raining sideways and it’s pretty 
windy, you get your two hours pay and go home.  Quite often in the late fall, early spring and 
quite often in the winter too, you may show up for work five days a week and not work any days.  
You get a check for five twos, for ten hours, just for showing up.   
 
4:13   [After that first job, what’s your…sort of…working occupational history since then?]  I 
started ironworking in 1970 and we were in a little building boom.  So all throughout my 
apprenticeship I stayed employed and I worked basically in the Loop area.  It was one high rise 
project to another.  I worked on Sears Tower for a good part of my apprenticeship.  It seemed 
like right after Sears Tower was completed, as is the nature of the construction industry, we went 
into a bust period.  So we were booming through the early part of the 70s and late 1974-75, there 
was a major bust.  There wasn’t any work in the Chicago area.  By this time, I had became a 
journeyman and I was at the bottom of the out-of-work list.  There were hundreds of guys out of 
work.  My work prospects didn’t look too good.  A couple of friends I had been working with 
said “We’re gonna boom out.”  And I said, “What’s that?”  I had never worked outside of 
Chicago or worked outside of the Loop.  And they said, “We’re going to boom out.  They’re 
building powerhouses down South and there’s some bridges going on.  We’re going to try to go 
to some of these different locals and get some work.”  And I said, “I never did that before.”  So 
by the time you figure it out, you know.  So we boomed out and I spent the next couple of years 
just going from different locals in Southern Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, trying to stay somewhat 
within driving distance of Chicago so I could still see my kid and my family.  For a couple of 
years, we boomed out with a little trailer and traveled around from job site to job site.  We built 
bridges and powerhouses.  We worked in Atlantic City when they were building casinos.  
Worked in Boston when they were boomin’.  A lot of times a big part of my work in life, 
especially in other parts of the country, you have to travel around if you want to keep working. 
 
6:15   [When you go out to a different local’s area, when you were traveling around, did you get 
adjust pretty quickly with guys you didn’t know?  When you were in Chicago, did you know a 
lot of the guys you were working with?]  It is amazing how fast ironworkers assimilate into the 
gang.  You have to know your craft.  Once they understand you know what you’re doing and 
you’re not going to get them hurt.  Once you prove to them that you know what you’re doing and 
you can handle your job…  A lot of times guys that you’re working with, especially these areas 
that are booming, a lot of them are from different locals too and they’re not living in the area, so 
after work they have no place to go but back to their motel room or trailer or whatever they’re 
living in.  So you develop friendships with these people.  You end up having quite a lot of fun.  
You sit around at night and tell stories and you get along really quick.  Everyone gets tied in to 
the boomers’ rumors because they have a brother-in-law that’s working over here or over there.  
They have leaders…and there’s an outage in a powerhouse and they’ll need 100 guys for two 
weeks.  You work 7 12s for two weeks or whatever.  So you get into these boomers 
rumors…who travel around.  It was a good part of my life.  I really enjoyed it.  I haven’t done it 
now for almost 30 years, I don’t do it now.  But for a period of time, I really enjoyed it.   
 
7:50   [When you did that, did you do the curtain stuff mostly?  What other kind of work or 
tasks…I should say…]   No…  Actually, you’ll get the bottom of the barrel work.  The local 
hands, rightfully so, will get the better jobs.  It’s their territory, it’s their local, and they should 
get that.  So they’ll get the better jobs.  The other jobs that are hard to man in boom periods are 
the ones the boomers would get.  So you sometimes get some pretty lousy jobs, but it was all 
work.  But you’re not working, you need a check.  You take whatever they give you.   
 
8:25   [You mentioned your uncle helped you get a job here.  Were there still . . . You started in 
1970.  Were there still a lot of old timers left, from the New Deal era from the 40s and 50s, in 
those days?]  Absolutely.  Quite a few guys that came in before WWII and then they went off 
and were in the service.  They came back after the war so quite a few guys were in during that 
area.  I  actually worked  with one fellow, when I started, was probably in his 70s.  He probably 
should have retired years before that but didn’t.  He was actually in the local in his 20s…even in 
his teens.  We had quite a few…  We actually have one fellow now.  He is the father of our 
apprentice worker here.  He’s 95 or 96 and he’s been for 75 years or so.  He started when he was 
a kid.  So he’s been a member for many many years.  
 
9:30   [Did ethnicity, was that involved in the ironworkers here in Chicago?  Were there a lot of 
Italians or Germans?  I know there were Indians.  Maybe you can talk about the Indian/Native 
American thing…]  Well, in Chicago, there’s three ironworker locals.  Each one of them pretty 
much came out of different ethnic groups.  My particular local…in the architectural ironworkers 
union in Chicago…  We came out of originally the foundries.  After the Chicago fire, it was 
decided that the city should be built fire proof.  A big part of that was getting away from wooden 
stairs, trying to make as much of the building – especially in the commercial district, the main 
part of the city that burnt down. So they were trying to put as many fire proof components into 
the building as possible.  Fire proof component being either masonry or cast iron at that time.  
The architectural ironworkers were the ones that were installing the cast irons.  So quite often 
these same workers would work in the foundry, creating the pieces, making the castings, pouring 
the castings of  stairs and store fronts and interior columns and things like that.  Then they would 
go out into the field and install them.  Around these shops, the workers started organizing small 
unions just for their own protection.  Winslow Brothers Foundry was one of the first big shops 
that we founded.  The Winslow Brothers Foundry did the façade on Louie Sullivan’s Carson-
Pirie-Scott building on corner of State Street and Madison,  that has recently been restored and 
rehabbed and everything.  Winslow Brothers Foundry did the original cast iron store front. That 
was one of the early shops that we organized.   
 
11:22   When word came that Chicago was going to host the World Columbian Exposition in 
1893, word came down about 1890 that we had this competition in 1890, 1891.  All these little 
shop unions decided to band together and they founded the Architectural Ironworkers Union of 
Chicago. That union had 1500 members.  They had so many members that they split it up into 
three separate locals.  They were an independent union, not affiliated with anyone.  They were 
the Architectural Ironworkers Union of Chicago and they had three locals.  One local conducted 
their business in English, one in German, and one in Bohemian.  So you had three separate locals 
under the one umbrella that was not affiliated.  They went on strike of the 8 hour day in 1892.  
And they were crushed.  They lost the strike.  They were crushed.  It was reorganized in 1893 
under a fellow of O.H. Hill.  This time, again we went on strike.  And this was during the 
building of the World Columbian Exposition.  That was ironworkers working on the big Ferris 
wheel, W. Ferris’ observation wheel that he called it.  They were working on the Ferris wheel 
and all the different buildings for the World Columbian Expedition.  And this time, we won 
recognition for a union and we won the 8 hour day.  We won recognition from a consortium of, 
let’s say, of contractors called the Iron League of Chicago.  This is still the same group that we 
negotiate with today.  We’ve had recognition since 1893.  At that time we affiliated with a group 
called the United Metal Workers.  The United Metal Workers would later go on to 1905 to be 
one of the founding organizations in the Industrial Workers of the World.  And Charles O. 
Sherman, the president of United Metal Workers, became the first and only president of the 
IWW, of the Industrial Workers of the World.  Later he would step down. They has a schism in 
the IWW and they never had a president again.  The general secretary was kind of recognized as 
the leader of the group.  We are affiliated with the United Metal Workers for a period of time.  
Right around this time, they started designing buildings with a skeletal framework made out of 
steel.  Before steel was available, cast iron is not suitable to be used as a beam.  Cast iron can 
only be used in compression.  [Because it’s brittle?]  Because it’s brittle and has very little tensile 
strength.  It’s a very strong metal and because its brittle, it has a very high carbon content.  It can 
only be used in the form of an arch or in compression.  It cannot be used horizontally, like for a 
beam.  So it really wasn’t available until steel started being produced in vast quantities like 
Carnegie’s blast furnace and open hearth furnaces and Bessemer furnaces.  Once steel started 
becoming more readily available for architectural use or for structural use and it was used in rails 
primarily.  Once they started being used to roll beams.  They could start to design railroad 
bridges, anything  using steel, we started seeing it being used in a structural framework for 
building.  A Chicago architect by the name of William Le Baron Jenney designed the first 
structural skeletal building on the corner of LaSalle and Adams called the Home Insurance 
Company.  It was a 10 story building.  What this did was, because now the external walls were 
no longer load bearing, they could be a lot thinner, the masonry walls.  And you didn’t have to 
have very thick masonry low bearing columns on the interior of the building.  You could have 
very narrow steel columns or cast columns.  So this opened up a lot of floor space and made the 
building a lot more attractive to developers because they basically had a lot more available 
square footage.  So this was a innovation of the construction industry that went off like wild fire.  
Once this took off, everybody wanted their buildings built from structural framework.  This put a 
great demand for workers with those kinds of skills.  So railroad bridge builders were brought in 
from all over the country because they were using a very similar technology on railroad bridges.  
They were brought in to work on these new skeletal structures.  Across the country this created a 
kind of jurisdictional differences with ironworkers that were already there, working with cast 
iron.  Cast iron stairs, store fronts and columns.   
 
16:12   So this group of structural ironworkers kind of formed their own union in Chicago called 
the Building Construction Men’s Union.  They were in conflict with the Architectural 
Ironworkers Union over jurisdiction.  This group eventually affiliated with six other unions in 
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, New York, what am I missing, Chicago…Boston. One other one. 
They met in Pittsburgh in 1896 and they founded the International Association of Bridge and 
Structural Ironworkers.  The reason why they affiliated was that primarily, their main employer 
was the United States Steel and the American Bridge Company.  No matter what city they 
worked in, they ended up working for the same employer.  They felt that if they were to get any 
kind of recognition or any kind of decent wages or decent working conditions, that they had to 
speak in one voice to United States Steel.  So they formed that association in 1896.  Architectural 
Ironworkers throughout the country, like in New York and Chicago and other places, they 
affiliated with the United Metal Workers.  Eventually, they left the United Metal Workers, these 
locals, in about 1902 and they affiliated with the International Association of Bridge and 
Structural Ironworkers in 1903, for the most part.  Then later in 1914, we changed the name of 
our organization from the International Association of Bridge and Structural Ironworkers to the 
International Association of Bridge, Structural and Metal Ironworkers.  Is that too wordy?  [No.]  
Laughter [I won’t remember it, but you did, so that’s good!] 
 
18:00   [You were starting, because you mentioned Bohemian and all that.  I’m sure that died out 
in 1907 but were there still a lot of Polish guys and Italian guys…?]  Definitely in the trades.  In 
Chicago you pretty much could still see a lot of that in 1970.  A lot of the terrazzo workers that 
were Italians.  They all spoke Italian, so they were very ethnically Italian.  We still had a lot of 
Bohemian and Swedes in our local.  In Local 1 ironworkers, there are a lot of Irish.  There will 
be a lot of Germans in our local.  The building trades are still very strong ethnic groups.   By this 
time, obviously, that’s all…  [Yeah.] 
 
18:55   [How does racial, gender, whatever play out in the union?]  It’s a non-issue now.  Thank 
God we’ve finally come to that point.  When I started in 1970 it was still a major issue.  Civil 
Rights Act was just passed in 1964 and building trades fought compliance for quite a while.  It 
wasn’t just my trade but all the trades fought compliance.  Special programs had to be set up to 
assimilate minorities into the different building trades.  They were basically barred from up to 
that point.  For a few years, there was a little growing pain.  When you get on a job and you work 
with a guy regardless of ethnicity and you’re working together…  When you had your partner 
that you were working with, you know, you work and you talk.  One thing about the building 
trades, you can do your job and do it well.  You can talk about different things.  So whatever 
your subjects are, whether sports or motorcycles or whatever…you can do this while you’re 
doing your job.  You get to know your partner very well.  After some initial growing pains, 
especially with the older guys.  But the younger guys, the minorities assimilated in quite quickly.  
By the late 70s, it wasn’t an issue.  You never heard any derogatory comments or racial slurs.  
Very very rarely by the late 70s.  We were just guys trying doing their job and trying to do the 
same thing and support your family.   
[Do you get a lot of Latino workers coming in to your apprentices program now?] We got a lot 
of Latino workers coming in here so now there’s a Spanish program now.  Especially now.  One 
factor, one aspect of our craft…  We represent fence erectors so all of those miles of rot iron 
fences that Mayor Daley loved….around all the parks and all the businesses.  We put the vast 
majority of that up.  The chain link fence and the guard rails on the expressways, any security 
fence or barbed wire anything like that.  It was our guys that did all that.  And in that one part of 
the craft, there are quite a few Hispanics.  Not for any other reason than that a guy would get a 
job and the boss would say, “Hey, you’re a pretty good worker.  Are there any more like you at 
home?”  And they’d say, “As a matter of fact, there are.”  So they would take one part of the 
craft and quite a few Hispanics are in that end of our business.  And also on the other, all aspects 
of the craft.  We feel . . . we’re kind of proud and think that we’re diverse, ethnically diverse.  
We try to represent Chicago in every way.   
 
20:05   [I know you mentioned this to me before but you have this Native American, Indian in 
your program, in your local…  Could you talk about how that and how it got started?]  That has 
been in effect for about 40 years.  As I recall it was during the building of the Alaskan pipeline.  
The Alaskan pipeline went through Native American land, indigenous people’s land, they 
certainly wanted a piece of the action and rightfully so.  So to give these people from various 
tribes up there and the training that was needed, programs were set up for pipe fitters, 
ironworkers and other people to get them the training they need to work on these jobs.  The 
ironworkers were just one craft that went up and offered this training.  Since that time, the 
ironworkers pretty much grabbed the bull by the horns and taken ownership of training for 
Native Americans.  Ever since then, we’ve had a program with them.  It’s been primarily in the 
Midwest for years, headquartered up in Wisconsin and down in Indiana.  Ever since then, it has 
been with our local here, Local 63 in Chicago.  It is funded through a grant with the Department 
of the Interior of Indian Affairs.  They have a small training staff.  They have two full time 
trainers and one administrative assistant.  What they do is they go to tribes throughout the United 
States and tell them what’s available.  All these different tribes from out west and out south and 
up north…tribes will send in people who think they want to do this and they come for the 
training program.  They are put in hotels.  All their meals are paid for. They attend a 12-week 
training program.  In that 12 weeks, they go through a very intensive program.  They learn about 
safety on the job.  They are exposed at the different aspects of the tying rods, of building 
structural buildings.  Welding, reading blue prints, cutting iron with a torch, burning we call it.  
They are exposed to all these different aspects of the craft.  In 12 weeks, 40 hours a week 
training…  And then they are assimilated into apprenticeship programs throughout the country of 
second year apprentices.  So it’s a very good deal for the locals because they get an apprentice 
that already has a very, very high degree of classroom training and then a hands-on training.  
Then it’s a deal for the contractors who hire them because they get somebody who is highly 
skilled at second year apprentice wages. So it has been a very successful program for forty years.  
For the last several years, and I’m talking 20 years or so, they’ve been having 100% placement, 
of all the candidates that come through.  Right now we’re in an economic bust in the construction 
industry and we’re not able to place them.   But still they certificates of training and when the 
economy does pick up and demand does pick up.  These men and women will be available.   
 
25:25   [I wanted to ask you about whether…  When you first got a job or…  Do guys play jokes 
on the workers when they first…]  Well, yeah, that’s fairly typical.  When a green guy comes on 
the job and you always ask him for the left handed monkey wrench and all that.  Typical old 
stuff.  They always…  There’s always that, ball busting.   A lot of that goes on.  Sometimes a 
little merciless.  A guy takes it a little bit too seriously and they see they’re getting to him.  They 
don’t let up.  We all have a story to tell, you know, about getting started.  My first day on the job, 
the boss told me to go and get a matched set of chokers.  And I was like, “ok”.  I didn’t know 
what a choker was.  I had no idea.  So I asked someone else what a choker was and he said, 
“well, it’s like wire rope with an eye on the end of it .”   So I said where are they and he said 
“they’re over in that box.” So it’s a big tool box, a gang box, they call it.  I open it up and it’s just 
a snarl of all these wire rope chokers and they’re tied into each other and everything.  “And he 
wants a matched set.”   So I’m pulling these things out, pulling out this fairly large choker and 
it’s all kinked up.  And its all stuck underneath all the other ones.  It finally comes out and whips 
back and hits him right in the chops.  I’m trying to hurry back to this guy because he’s kind of in 
a bind and he needs a matched set of chokers.  I finally get it out, with a fat lip and I’m bleedin’ 
on my first day.  And he looks at me and says, “Boy, you’re going to be one hell of an 
ironworker.”   And I took it to heart.  I was 18 and it kind of hurt my feelings and…  And I made 
up my mind that I was going to be a good ironworker.  And I ended up being the apprentice of 
the year by the time I graduated.  Made this my life and since then I’ve worked as a foreman, a 
general foreman, a superintendent, and now I’ve been a business agent at my Local for 16 years.  
 
27:25   [How did you move into that business agent job?  What’s entailed with that?  That’s a 
different than being on the job site.]  Well, like I say, I started in 1970.  I served in a four year 
apprenticeship.  I was apprentice of the year.  By that time, the bottom fell out in the Chicago out 
so I boomed out.  I worked structural, tied rods, and machinery moving, anything I had to do.  
When work picked up back in Chicago, and I came back.  I was a pretty seasoned ironworker.  I 
quickly worked my way into a foreman position, kind of a job of a pusher.  Then a general 
foreman, which means you ran several gangs.  I ended up being superintendent of everyone 
working for a particular company.  I had worked in those positions either as a general foreman or 
a superintendent for almost 25 years.  But in 1986, something was happening in Chicago.  That 
was the 100th anniversary of the Haymarket.  I knew, just being a Chicagoan, I’ve heard the 
words, “Haymarket Riot” but I really didn’t know what it was about.  I was working in a job 
downtown and the police was getting geared up in their riot gear.  Wearing their helmets and all 
that.  Then all these radicals, hippies, freaks, everybody came to Chicago.  But also at the same 
time, so was Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, and all these other people, and Studs 
Terkel, who I really liked, and making speeches and everything.  I had to find out what 
Haymarket was all about.  So one day during lunch I was walking down Wabash and I actually 
went into the Kroch and Brentano Bookstore and there was a little red book there called 
“Haymarket Revisited” by a fellow named William J. Adelman.  So it’s lunch time and I pick up 
the book and I start reading it.  I find out that this is a labor issue.  This is about unions.  So I’m 
reading this book and by the time I come near the end of the book, they’re talking about the 
dedication of the martyrs’ monument in Waldheim Cemetery in 1892.  It says that the speaker’s 
dais was a draped with the crimson banner of the Architectural Ironworkers Union of Chicago, 
Local #2.  I’ve never heard of this group before.  And I go, “what is this??”  I’m local 63 and we 
were founded…  We became Local 63 in 1903 and this is in 1892.  So…I’m like blown away by 
reading what the Haymarket is really about.  And my local was involved in that with the union. 
 
30:02   So I’m looking at my watch and it’s 2 o’clock in the afternoon.  I have half an hour for 
lunch.   So I just pulled a “nooner” in a bookstore.   And I’m the guy loving the chair and I’m the 
superintendent.  So I made up my mind that I’m going to write a letter to the fellow who wrote 
the book to inquire more about this.  So I see in the back in the book that he’s a professor at the 
University of Illinois.  So I called the university…I just want to get his address so I can write him 
a letter.  I called the university and I said, “Do you have a William J. Adelman there?”  And she 
said, “Please hold.”  She put me on hold and the music is playing…   And then a guy picks up 
the phone and says, “Adelman.”   And I’m like, holy cow.  All I wanted was the guy’s address so 
I could write him a letter.  I don’t know what to ask him.  He ends up being the nicest guy in the 
world and I’m talking to him.  He says, “You know, he says, I give tours every year…he 
says…the first Sunday in May.  We do a tour of Haymarket Square and go to the courthouse 
where the trial and execution was.  Then we go out to Waldheim Cemetery.  I told him I would 
love to do that.  And he said, “Well, you’re invited.”  And I thanked him.  I went on the tour with 
him and actually became very good friends with the guy.  It was because of him and that little 
red book that I started studying labor history in 1986, the hundredth anniversary of Haymarket.  
[Yeah, Bill was a great guy.]  He was the best.  We eventually started organizing tours just for 
us.  We’d have our apprentices and Bill would give us a tour of the Haymarket Square and the 
courthouse and we’d go out to Waldheim.  And then we’d all go out for beer and pizza 
afterwards.  Ended up being a good friend right up until he died. 
 
31:43   [Did you ever have to go on strike?]  Yeah…  We’ve gone on strike for contract recently, 
with our fence erectors.  We were on strike for about a week.  That was maybe 4 years ago.  We 
had to take our fence erectors out on strike.  We work under a different contract.  On the building 
side?  The guys on the other contracts work on the buildings.  We haven’t been on strike since 
1968.  But as a business agent, I have been on strike several times over nonunion contractors 
working on a union job.  Let’s say that the job is primarily union, 70% union, something like 
that.  A nonunion contractor will come in and do my phase of the work.  We will go on strike.  
We will picket those jobs were recognition.   [How often do you have those strikes?  They’re 
pretty localized, obviously.]  They were pretty localized.  They’re one job site and in my 16 
years as a business agent, I found pretty much if I can’t get it done in 2-3 days, it’s not going to 
get done.  I’ve had some pickets that have been up for six months.  We picketed a particular 
development, the condominium tower or something like that.   They were picketed for six 
months.  We knew it was going to be a loser, but what we tried to do is put a little economic hurt 
on the developer…hopefully that in the next time he would choose an easier path. [But in 
general…in Chicago, employers have been pretty good at working with the ironworkers’ union.]  
Yeah, Chicago is still pretty much a union town.  I talk to ironworkers all over the country and 
they say how fortunate we are to control as much…I don’t know if control is a good word…but 
to enjoy as much of the market as we do.  But it’s through hard work.  I’m not just saying our 
generation…  I mean, we’re standing up against some pretty tall shoulders.  Guys that did the 
work in the 1900s at the turn of the century.  All through the hard times in the Depression.  We 
are standing on their shoulders, and we’re holding on to what these guys fought for.  Chicago is 
still in good strong union market in the construction industry.   
 
34:17   [You separate from the employers do you ever have conflicts with other unions, building 
trades or jurisdictional disputes?]  Unfortunately, the way the building trades were set up, going 
all the way back to Samuel Gompers’ vision, that everyone would have their particular craft and 
there would be peace in the industry.  But technology is constantly changing and as things evolve 
in the construction industry, new technologies come on almost daily.  There’s a lot of inner craft 
design that has nothing to do with any particular union.  But there’s inner craft design where 
something was someone else’s job yesterday is all of a sudden is unitized into another piece of 
work.  Now who’s job is it to install this?  Quite often, work will be assigned to one craft who 
are reluctant to give it up, and rightfully so because they are looking out for jobs for their 
members.  So jurisdictional arguments almost happen daily in the construction industry in 
Chicago.  We have something set up called the Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional 
Disputes and it is usually the final step with business agents and business managers who cannot 
resolve a jurisdictional dispute.  You would build a case pretty much the same way you would 
build a legal case.  You build a case arguing why you believe this work belongs to your craft.  
And then you have to present it to an arbitrator.  Then the arbitrator has three days to make a 
final decision, as to who is going to be awarded this work, retain the work, or the other craft will 
have to give it up in the end.  Yes, unfortunately, jurisdiction is a daily reality in the construction 
industry. 
 
36:16   [You said you started working in 1970 so you kind of came in the OSHA era.]  Yeah, I 
was pre-OSHA.  [Maybe you could comment a bit about how the changes you’ve seen about 
safety on the job during your time.]  Incredible, Big changes.  When I started, Chicago had one 
safety inspector and his name was Shut ‘em Down Schultz.  Laughter.  Schultz would come out 
and…  I heard rumors that Schultz was taken care of and your job was good.  I don’t know if any 
of that is true.  But Shut ‘em Down Schultz would come on your job and you’d look around and 
if he deemed it unsafe, he would shut the job down.  He was appointed, I think, by the City of 
Chicago.  That was it.  That’s pretty much the extent of safety oversight.  Contractors were more, 
at that time, more or less held in check by their insurance companies.  If your workman’s comp 
rates were too high, you were out of business.  So if there was any safety on the job, it was the 
contractor looking out out more than anybody else.  He wanted to keep his insurance rates in 
check.  We never wore body harnesses like they do today.  We never had any kind of restraint, 
shock-absorbing restraint cables.  We just wore belts and just a rote and a belt to tie it off to.  It 
wouldn’t really do anything for you.  You never fell off.  We wore hard hats, but safety glasses 
weren’t mandatory.  In a lot of places, they weren’t mandatory.  We never wore any respirators 
in all kinds of environments.  I worked a lot of asbestos-rich environments.  No one ever really 
said anything about that.  One of my first jobs as an apprentice was shaking out or distributing 
the asbestos blankets to the welder setting.  The welders, if they were doing overhead welding, or 
if they had to lay down and work overhead.  They would put this asbestos blanket over them.  It 
was my job to shake out these blankets and put the asbestos blankets on the welders.  And then 
shortly after that, this whole asbestos thing blew up.  Asbestos was off the job…but you still 
have that if you work in older buildings.  It took a long, long time for people got really aware of 
asbestos problems.   
 
39:00   [Are the workers more aware of all the safety stuff now, more active, pro-active?]  Oh 
absolutely, right now its not required by law but I’m thinking it will be.  At the very least, 
contractors will demand it.  All apprentices go through OSHA training and we’ve been doing it 
for quite a while.  Apprentices go through OSHA training for years hazmat training with 
hazardous materials.  It’s much safer now. Night and day. Yeah.  Things were wide open. Jobs 
were dangerous.  Construction is dangerous.  You have to be very aware where you were all the 
time.  There were open shafts on jobs…high rise open shafts.  Quite often you’d get a floor 
where there were no safety cables at all, leading down.  Maybe they were never put yet  once you 
were high enough.  You had to be constantly aware where you were and what you were doing. 
 
40:03   [Were you ever injured on the job?]  I’m one of those guys.  I’ve had 18 broken bones in 
my life and I’ve never broken one on the job.  I was on one job, gateway 3, and I just started.  It 
was the day after Easter – the Monday after Easter in 1971.  Over that weekend, they had jumped 
a skip, they call it.  As a building goes, you have to raise the elevators up so they jumped the 
skips on the weekend.  So they raised the elevators up and our shanty was on the 6th floor so 
usually we would walk up to 6th in the morning and change in our clothes and everything and 
then we would get on the man hoist, skip to the top of the building.  We were one of the first 
loads to get on the skip.  As we were getting on, the elevator started creeping down.  The 
operating engineer tried to control it.  He saw that he couldn’t control it so he says  
“guys were going down so bend our knees.”  He closed the doors really quick.   The operating 
engineer was really cool.  This elevator fell six floors, all the way down.  There are springs down 
at the bottom.  You hit the springs.  So we all bent our knees and hit the springs.  Everybody 
made it pretty good.  The elevator bounced up several feet.  By this time, everyone fell over and 
when it came down the second time, everyone was flat on their back.  A lot of guys got hurt.  It 
ended some careers.  I was 19 years old and in good shape.  I played sports in high school.  I 
didn’t get hurt too bad.  I messed up my back a little bit.  To this day, I have back spasms.  I 
didn’t get it as bad as some of the guys.  That’s about the closest I got to getting hurt really bad.  
I got stitches and banged up but not much… Fortunately.  Knock on wood.  [It still seems like a 
high risk job compared to most occupations.]  I tell you, every year we end up…  It’s gotten a lot 
better but a guy will get a career ending injury.  And something will happen to him. My 
particular local,  last year we had two on the job fatalities.  That was the worst year in a long 
time.  Thank God that doesn’t happen all the time.  Last year was exceptional.  Two guys got 
killed on the job and that’s cause for alarm.  I went to the hospital because I heard a guy got hurt.  
By the time I got to the hospital, he had already passed.  His whole family was there.  It was very 
hard.  I’m their union rep…  The wife kept calling me to find out what happened.  Get to the 
bottom went out.   It was a terrible accident. 
 
42:46  [Are there a lot of customs that ironworkers have or aware of?  I know there are topping 
off ceremonies they do and the Harley Davidson on the top of Trump Tower.  That was Local 1.]  
No, no, no.  That was my guys.  Yeah.  These guys took all their bikes up and had been working 
good several years for us.  A lot of guys had some nice looking bikes.  They took them up to the 
top of Trump Tower.  They had the whole city beyond them and the Trump Tower and it was a 
beautiful photo.  They probably shouldn’t have taken their bikes up there.  If the general 
contractor would have found out….   It was a great photograph.  Topping off ceremonies, as far 
as at the Evergreen Tree and the white beam.  That’s our brother local, Local #1, and that’s their 
tradition and big ceremony with them.  But also with us.  When you get near the end of a job, 
you know that your job is going to be over.  When you get to the top floor you start laying off.  
So you’re working with a bunch of guys, especially on a big job and you’re with these guys for 
almost a year, 9 months a year.  You know guys are going to start getting laid off.  You have a 
little celebration.   
 
44:09   [Do guys in your union have special clothing that they wear or build things on their own?  
I noticed when I was walking through the Union Hall, for example,  I saw some stuff from the 
American Indians had cut out of metal and some Indian flags from different nations. Are there 
articles of clothing, things like that that you’ve customized?  Helmets or something like that?]  
Yeah, a lot of guys will wear the MSA hard hat that originally workers in the mills would wear 
these.  They’re made out of fiberglass.  They were better to work with in the mills in a lot of high 
heat because they wouldn’t melt like plastic one and they wouldn’t get too hot like a metal one.  
So the fiberglass hard hat was popular with ironworkers working in mills, primarily with 
American Bridge.  So ironworkers throughout the country started to cut back.  Quite often you’ll 
see iron workers wearing brown hard hats made out of fiberglass material.  Made by a company 
called MSA.  Anybody can buy these now with the other trades.  But primarily you would see 
them in the ironworkers.  Structural ironworkers, the iconic spud wrenches, they wear the belt 
with the spuds. They always used to say that you’d hear an ironworker before you see him 
because as they walk, the spuds would clang together.  So you knew the ironworkers were 
around on a structural job because of the spud wrenches.  Everyone has to wear durable clothing.  
Obviously you can’t wear shorts on the job, things like that.  You have to wear boots.  Heavy 
jeans.  Heavy jackets.  Carhartt jackets that have been worn for many years.  You shouldn’t wear 
clothing that is ragged or too baggy or anything like that.  I know the fashion with a lot of 
younger guys is baggy jeans.  The older guys, especially you’ll see apprentices and you’ll see 
them wearing baggy jeans and we’d tell ‘em, “that’s not wise because you’re going to get hung 
up on something that you might get hung up on and it might take you away.”  So you should 
wear good fitting, durable clothing.  If you’re smart.  You got to get stung a couple of times 
before you get smart. 
 
46:33   [One more thing and then if there’s something else you want to talk about, feel free but…  
A couple of times the issue of drinking has come up and you noticed from the DVD, my 
colleague, Jim Leary, stuck a few drinking stories into that DVD…  You told me about another 
program that actually is anti-drinking program.  Maybe could you make a comment on that.  
People have told a lot of stories about drinking.  That’s true about a lot of blue collar trades.  Its 
not unusual.]  And it certainly was a part of the ironworker culture for many, many years.  Were 
there contributory accidents?  I mean…  I don’t know but let’s say now that’s something we are 
aware of in the industry.  We cannot tolerate it.  The ironworkers initiated a program that’s 
probably close to ten years old called IMPACT.  It’s a jointly managed between labor and 
management.  It covers a lot of aspects of promoting the iron worker industry.  We make sure 
that we have very a collective, highly skilled and viable workforce.  One aspect of IMPACT is 
mandatory drug testing.  So every union hall in the country, we cannot dispatch a man unless he 
has been IMPACT drug tested.  Quite often on construction sites, each general contractor will 
demand that you also test on site.  It has become a very, very big factor in the modern 
construction industry, drug testing.  Especially the union sector, it is something we pride 
ourselves on, we’re a highly productive, skilled sober workforce.  Even though guys might still 
go out and have a beer after work, it’s pretty much gone having a beer at lunch.  That aspect of 
the craft has gone.  If a fellow has too many beers at night and you come to work the next day, 
you probably would be sent home.  And that would be just the alcohol part of it.  As far as any 
other substance abuse, marijuana or whatever.  That’s pretty much gone now.  [I can’t imagine 
getting high and going to work.]   It was there.  In the 70s.  Late 60s, early 70s.  It was certainly 
there.  Not just the ironworkers.  It was there with all the crafts.  I don’t deny it.  There was a 
problem and it had to be addressed.  I think it was successfully addressed.  I go on construction 
sites pretty much every day and I don’t see anything close to any kind of evidence that that’s 
there.  Ironworkers try to be at the forefront with that.  With our IMPACT program.  Our 
International Association and we’re very proud of it.  They use that as a tool and an instrument 
when they go to promote our craft to union contractors, why they want to hire ironworkers.  We 
want to be productive.  We want to be highly skilled.  We want to be reliable.  And contractors 
are, after all, are our partners.  We want a decent wage. We want decent working conditions.  We 
want a safe worksite and the contractors as a quid pro quo they want a productive workforce that 
going to go out there and  keep them in business.  We try to work in partnership with them and 
we understand what they need and they understand what we need.  Hopefully, we try to meet 
there in the middle and give them product that they need and in turn they give us a decent living.  
 
50:37   [One more thing that I thought about because you talked about teaching, obviously you 
have a strong sense of the industry or the labor industry in general.  Are the members, the rank 
and file, do they have a strong sense of tradition?  You’re active in promoting that maybe you 
could talk about that too and why you think it’s maybe important that they do know that.]  I think 
it is important.  In 1996, our international union celebrated their 100th anniversary.  We had a 
convention in Las Vegas and everything.  One of the commemoratives that was given out to the 
delegates of the convention was a history book.  A member of our local union, Ray Robinson, 
worked together with William Adelman, and other people.  They put together a history of the 
ironworkers union for the 100th anniversary, a 100th anniversary history book. The book proved 
to be so successful that Raymond Robinson, he was general vice president, and he was also the 
international director of apprenticeship training for the United States and Canada.  He wanted to 
put together a history course around the book.  He knew I was a history buff and he asked if I’d 
be interested.  Since that time, we started teaching history to apprentice instructors, throughout 
the United States and Canada, since 1997, with the idea being that every apprentice instructor 
will take this history class at a training seminar that we hold once a year.  They would go back 
and teach labor history to their apprentices.  So the international association is actively pursuing 
that, that we teach labor history, not just the history of the ironworkers, but labor history, to our 
apprentices all throughout the United States and Canada.  We’ve been doing that for 15 years 
now. [And the members, the guys and women who are showing up for this, are they enjoying 
it?].  Very much. I always have good classes whenever I teach.  Everybody can’t believe that 
they never heard that before.  I like to use a quote from Les Orear that I’ve heard several times.  
He says, “You know, your entire lives, you’ve learned the history of the Great White Man who 
own and run our country, and now you’re going to learn about the people who actually built it.  
So they enjoy it.  
 
[Anything else you want to talk about? I’m kind of out. We’ve done our hour and I think we’ve 
got a lot of information ]   Well, good we can always do more.  [Thanks a lot Rich.  I really 
appreciate all this.]  Okay, Buck!
