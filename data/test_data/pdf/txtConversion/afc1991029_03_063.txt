Informant/Event:  Drive from Eagle Lake to Fort Kent,  breakfast at
 
Rock's Motel Cafe.

Site:  Eagle Lake,  ME;  Fort Kent, ME;  points between; Rock's Motel
 
and Cafe,  Fort Kent
 
This  fieldnote describes  the  drive  from  Eagle  Lake to  Fort
 
Kent,  ME,  on June 3,  1991  (our first full day in the study area)
 
and that morning's breakfast at Rock's Cafe.
 
Ray  Brassieur  and  I  left  our  house  in  Eagle  Lake  in  the
 
morning and drove into Fort Kent to meet Stephanie Hall and David
 
Taylor for breakfast.
 This was our  first full  day  in the study
 
area,  and I was eager to begin to get a feel for what the land and
 
the people were like.
 It is a twelve mile drive from our house to
 
Fort Kent on  State Highway  11,  and  it  is  a very pleasant drive.
 
The  topography  has  a good  deal  of  relief,  and  the  ascents  and
 
descents  through  the rolling,  wooded hills provide  a variety  of
 
panoramas.
 One can see a fair distance from the tops of some of
 
the hills; to the east both forest and farmland are visible across
 
the Fish River valley, and from the highest point one can see hills
 
to the north which seem as if they must be in New Brunswick.
 
The  corridor through which we  travel  to reach Fort Kent  is
 
well but not densely populated.
 There seem to be at least two or
 
three houses  every quarter mile or  so,  and a couple of  clusters
 
that one might  call  small  villages.
 Some of  the  residences  are
 
combined with businesses--a couple of hairdressers,  two or three
 
small grocery/general stores,  a machine shop,  a mechanic,  several
 
contractors,  a few small craft shops  (one I particularly notice is
 
called  "Aroostook  Creations,"  presumably  after  the  county  it  is
 
in).
 The houses themselves  are an assorted  lot.
 Near the  lake
 
shore,  one sees a number of what I would call cottages and cabins,
 
although the term  in this part of the world seems  to be  "camp."
 
Along the highway, the predominant type is the one and one-half to
 
two-story rectangular frame house,  sided generally with some type
 
of wood  (although some may have vinyl  siding),  and with a gabled
 
roof; quite a few of these have some kind of an addition to them.
 
Mixed in are an assortment of trailers,  ranch style houses,  and a
 
few larger and newer houses of fairly modern style,  with lots of
 
wood and glass.
 
There  are  a number  of  barns  along  our  route,  but  I cannot
 
recall seeing one that appeared to be part of an active farm.
 A
 
good many of them are obviously abandoned,  and several have roofs
 
that are completely collapsed.
 Even the ones which seem as if they
 
might  be  in  use  are  not  in  the  best  of  repair.
 There  is  some
 
cleared land,  but aside from building sites and garden plots not
 
much of it seems to be in use,  and the woodland predominates.
 
My  impressions  so  far  reinforce  what  I had  heard  and  read
 
before  coming  here--that  this  is  an  economically  troubled  area,
 
where agriculture used to be a profitable endeavor but no  longer
 
is,  and where people are struggling and doing what they can to get
 
by.
 Gardens  and cottage  industries  seem to be  the mainstays  of
 
life along Route 11.
 
We arrive at the outskirts of the village of Fort Kent,  and
 
pass through a mixed-use area of homes,  businesses,  and schools.
 
Nothing seems unusual or unexpected.  The houses are nice--fairly
 
large,
 mostly
 two-story
 clapboard,
 well
 kept,
 white
 with
 
contrasting trim.
 There is the occasional splash of color created
 
by  a  bright  blue  or  green  coat  of  paint.
 We  drive  by  the
 
elementary  school  and  the  high  school,  and  then  the  college--
University of Maine-Fort Kent--which  is where our office will be
 
located.
 School  is not in session,  and the small campus  is very
 
quiet.
 We continue on into the downtown area,  where the motel in
 
which Hall and Taylor are staying in is located,  and where we are
 
meeting them  for breakfast.
 The trip down Main  Street does  not
 
contradict other evidence of hard times;  it seems as if there are
 
nearly as many storefronts are empty as there are occupied.
 There
 
are a couple of gas stations,  a car dealership,  what looks like a
 
drug store  ("Laverdiere's"),  two taverns  (one is called "B-J's"),
 
a hotel  [later  information  reveals  that  the  Fort  Kent  Hotel  no
 
longer  operates  as  a hotel,  only  as  a restaurant  and  bar],  an
 
office supply store,  and a few other shops.
 
At the west end of Main Street is Rock's Motel and Cafe, where
 
we are to meet Hall and Taylor.
 They are waiting outside the door
 
of  the motel,  and we head  for  the  cafe  for breakfast.
 It  is  a
 
Monday  morning,  and  the  cafe  is  over  half  full--a  mixture  of
 
middle-aged and  older men.
 I think  Stephanie may have been the
 
only woman in the place who didn't work there.
 There is a lot of
 
conversation,  what  seems  to  be  banter.
 I'm  not  certain,  since
 
French seems to be the language of choice,  and I don't speak it.
 
I am trying to pay particular attention to language,  as Brassieur
 
has  indicated a desire to focus on the circumstances under which
 
French  is  spoken and  in particular the age of the  speakers.
 It
 
seems that the customers here are exclusively speaking French to
 
each other,  while the employees speak both English and French to
 
customers, depending on the customer's preference.
 The employees,
 
who I would estimate range in age from sixteen to fifty,  all speak
 
both  English  and  French,  and  switch  between  the  two  with  great
 
facility.
 At times they even seem to switch in mid-sentence.
 A
 
researcher  interested  in  code-switching  would  find  a wealth  of
 
material here.
 
The cafe offers standard breakfast fare--eggs, bacon, sausage,
 
pancakes--with one intriguing exception.
 The handwritten
 
menu board exhorts one to try their "home-made creton."
 I have no
 
idea what that is, but Brassleur orders some, explaining that it is
 
kind of a pate made with ground meat  (usually pork)  and spices.
 I
 
get the  impression that  it  is  a traditional Acadian food  [later
 
comments by Brassieur indicate that the only place he has ever seen
 
it is in Maine,  and he seems reluctant to call it Acadian].
 
We eat breakfast  (very good blueberry pancakes),  talk a bit
 
about the project,  and  leave.
 Our next  stop  is  the University,
 
where  we  will  meet  Lisa  Ornstein,  another  member  of  the  field
 
research team who is currently directing the Acadian Archive at the
 
University.
 The  major  task  for  this  morning  is  to  locate  our
 
office
 and
 all
 of
 the
 equipment
 (cameras,
 tape
 recorders,
 
computers, etc.) which has been shipped up from Washington, DC, and
 
start to unpack and get organized.

Informant/Event:  Dumont,  Dr.  Richard;  Dubay,  Guy
 
Coworker: Brassieur, Ray; Hall,  Stephanie; Ornstein, Lisa; Taylor,
 
David
 
Site:  Dr.  Dumont's  office  at  the  University;  the  Brass  Lantern
 
Restaurant at the Fort Kent Hotel
 
The research team went to Dr.  Duniont's office at 11:00 A. M.,
 
where we were  to meet  Dr.  Dumont  and  the  vice-president  of  the
 
University,  Myrna Cassel.
 Dr.  Dumont was a cordial and engaging
 
man,  obviously proud of his French heritage and very supportive of
 
the goals of our project.
 He spoke for a while about the history
 
of the University,  relating that it had been founded as a "normal
 
school," a college to train teachers to serve the educational needs
 
of this part of the state.
 Eventually,  it was made a part of the
 
University of Maine system;  this was done with a number of  such
 
schools which were in danger of closing.  The University now offers
 
a number of bachelor's degree programs, and serves a varied student
 
body  which  includes  a high  percentage  of  older  (I  think  "non-
traditional"  is the current term in vogue)  students.
 
About noon we went to the Brass Lantern for lunch.  Guy Dubay,
 
who works with Lisa Ornstein at the Acadian Archive,  joined us; as
 
we were a fairly large group  (seven), we ended up at a long table,
 
where I was seated opposite Dubay.
 I asked him to talk a bit about
 
the history of the area, which he was glad to do.
 One of his first
 
statements  was,  "We're  the  ones  who  ran  back  into  the woods  to
 
avoid  getting  on  the  boat"  (a  reference  to  the  deportations  of
 
1755).
 He also talked about the connections of the study area to
 
Quebec,  which  according to  him are quite  strong;  he claims  that
 
almost every family in the area has some sort of familial tie to
 
Quebec.
 
I next asked him why the border between Maine and Canada did
 
not follow the Saint John River all the way to the sea,  and he had
 
two answers.
 The first involved an anecdote about a drinking bout
 
between Daniel Webster and a man  (whose name I can't recall) who I
 
thought Dubay said was a French official of some sort.
 Since the
 
Webster-Ashburton  Treaty,  which  settled  the  Maine-Canada  border
 
dispute,  was  between  the  United  States  and  England,  either  I
 
misunderstood what he said or there is likely no basis in fact for
 
this  story  (or both).
 His  second reply was that the border was
 
drawn in such a way as to facilitate shipping between the interior
 
of  Canada and  the coastal ports  of New Brunswick,  which at that
 
time  would  have  been  especially  important  in  regard  to  timber.
 
Certainly one of England's goals during this period would have been
 
to  protect  their  access  to  the  virgin  pine  forests  of  North
 
America,  which were so vital to shipbuilding.
 
All  in  all,  a pleasant  and  informative  meeting  and  lunch,
 
after which we returned to our office at the University to continue
 
our organizational efforts.

Date:  6/6/91
 
Informant/Event:  Drive from Fort Kent east on U.S.  Route 1,  south
 
on Route 162 to Sinclair,  talk with Jack Caron,  and return.
 
Coworker:  Brassieur,  Ray;  Ornstein,  Lisa
 
Site:  Fort Kent,  ME;  Frenchville,  ME;  Saint Agatha,  ME;  Sinclair,
 
ME;  and points between.
 
This fieldnote describes a trip from Fort Kent to Sinclair and
 
back on June 6,1991.  The route was as follows:  east on U.S.  Route
 
1 from  Fort  Kent  to  Frenchville,  then  south  on  State Route  162
 
through Saint Agatha to Sinclair.  We returned via the same routes.
 
We left Fort Kent in Brassieur's car in mid-afternoon.
 This
 
was our first trip out of the Fort Kent--Eagle Lake area,  and our
 
intent was to get an idea of the lay of the land and note any sites
 
that might bear  investigation.
 We drove out of  Fort Kent headed
 
east on U.S.  Highway toward Frenchville.
 
Ornstein pointed out a twin barn a short distance east of Fort
 
Kent,  and said this was perhaps  the best known  local  example  of
 
this type of barn.
 It is clearly visible on the south side of the
 
road.
 These twin barns were apparently fairly common in the study
 
area  at one  time,  and  several  examples  are still  standing.
 Its
 
appearance is that of two nearly identical barns with simple gabled
 
roofs,  standing side by side with a low connecting wall.
 I cannot
 
discern whether or not there is a passageway behind the connecting
 
wall.
 None of our group has any information regarding the origin
 
or areal extent of these barns.
 
The hills of New Brunswick,  across the Saint John River,  are
 
clearly visible as we drive along Route 1.
 A number of hedgerows
 
can  be  seen  running  up  the  slopes  perpendicular  to  the  river;
 
Brassieur notes that these might mark the boundaries between land
 
grants,  and calls them arpent lines, referring to the unit of land
 
measurement in use by the French when these grants were made.
 One
 
can  quite  clearly  see  the  long  lot  pattern  reflected  in  these
 
divisions.
 
A few miles  later we pass an abandoned buckwheat mill which
 
stands a few hundred feet to the south of Route 1 in Frenchville.
 
It  is  a long,  fairly  low  building  with  a tall  chimney,  but  is
 
somewhat hidden in the trees and not much detail is visible as we
 
drive past.
 Buckwheat was  once an  important crop  in this  area;
 
buckwheat flour is the main ingredient in what was a staple of the
 
local diet,  a type of pancake called a ploye or plogue,  and most
 
settlements  had  a mill.
 Several  people  have  told  us  about  the
 
Bouchard  family  who  grow  buckwheat  today  and  make  pre-packaged
 
ploye mix,  and we have seen this product in the  local groceries.
 
However,  the  Bouchards  apparently  have  to  send  their  grain  to
 
Canada to be milled,  as there are no currently operating mills in
 
northern Maine.
 
At Frenchville, we turn south on State Route 162.
 There is a
 
gravel parking lot behind some type of storage building in which we
 
notice some potato barrels,  and we stop to examine them.
 This is
 
my  first  look  at  an  actual  potato  barrel,  although  I had  seen
 
pictures of them.
 They are not especially large barrels,  standing
 
nearly three  feet tall.
 I would guess  that  each barrel holds  a
 
hundred pounds  or so of potatoes  [later,  informant Herman Deprey
 
tells me that each barrel holds eleven pecks,  or one hundred sixty
 
five pounds].
 The barrels have gently curving wooden sides  (ash,
 
I think)  and the hoops are made of some sort of wooden strips and
 
nailed into the staves.
 This particular group of empty barrels is
 
not at a farm or crop storage site,  so what they are being used for
 
is anybody's guess.
 None of us can say whether such barrels are
 
used on the farms any longer or not.
 
As we continue south on 162, we pass two more twin barns,  one
 
just north of Saint Agatha and one just south.
 They look much like
 
the  twin  barn  we  had  seen  just  a bit  earlier  on  U.S.  1.
 They
 
appear to be in fairly good condition,  but it is difficult to tell
 
on a quick drive-by whether or not they are in use.
 
A  few  miles  further  south,  Brassieur  spots  a  small  dock
 
extending into Long Lake.
 An interesting feature of this dock is
 
that the end in the water is supported by a pair of wheels.  We had
 
previously notice a dock constructed in the same manner located at
 
a camp  very  near  ours  on  Eagle  Lake  and  had  thought  it  was  an
 
anomaly, but apparently it was not.
 We stopped to examine it,  and
 
I took several photographs while Brassieur and Ornstein examined
 
its  construction  and dimensions.
 The wheels  on this particular
 
dock were iron, and looked like the wheels of an old wagon or cart.
 
The
 platform
 was
 constructed
 of
 wooden
 planks,
 and
 was
 
approximately 20  feet long by 5 feet wide.
 The end out of water
 
simply  rested  on  the  shore.
 As  we were  examining the  dock,  we
 
noticed a man standing outside a house across the road.  We thought
 
perhaps he would have some information about this type of dock,  so
 
we crossed to talk to him.
 His name was Jack Caron, and he was the
 
resident of the house and owner of the dock.
 I was still taking
 
photographs,  but heard some of the conversation between Mr. Caron,
 
Brassieur,  and Ornstein.
 Caron stated that this type of dock is
 
quite  common  on  lakes  in  northern Maine,  and that many examples
 
could be found on Long Lake.
 In response to Brassieur's query, he
 
said that the French term for such docks is "quay."  The purpose of
 
the wheels was to enable the dock to be moved easily,  so that it
 
could  be  withdrawn  from  the  lake  before  the  winter  freeze.
 
Apparently,  if this is not done the dock will be destroyed during
 
the spring thaw, when large pieces of ice are blown around the lake
 
by wind and current.
 A secondary benefit was that the dock could
 
be moved from point to point on the shore; in fact, Mr. Caron noted
 
that he had recently moved his dock off of a point of land just to
 
the north of his house,  which he said was too  accessible to the
 
public.
 
By the time we had  finished talking to Mr.  Caron,  it was nearly
 
dark,  so we returned home.

Informant/ Event:  Brief  conversation with group of  people tearing
 
down Gagnon barn in Eagle Lake
 
Coworker:  none
 
Site:  State Highway 11,  Eagle Lake,  ME
 
I had gone into Eagle Lake to do my laundry.
 It turned out
 
that the laundromat was next to a lot where we had noticed, when we
 
first drove into town, that a barn was in the process of being torn
 
down.  There was a group of people at the barn today, and it looked
 
like  they were  continuing the  process.
 I went  over  to  talk  to
 
them,  and it turned out they did not own the barn,  but the owner,
 
Mrs.  Gagnon,  lived in the house next door.
 Her husband had just
 
died,  and as she had no use for the barn she was allowing them to
 
tear  it  down  in  exchange  for  the  lumber.
 The  man  who  was  in
 
charge,  who  seemed  reluctant  to  tell  me  his  name,
 lived  in
 
Wallagrass,  the town immediately north of Eagle Lake.
 Another of
 
the group as  a woman named Marianne Mills,  whose maiden name was
 
Cyr  and  was  born  in  the  St.  John  River  Valley.
 She  was  quite
 
interested in our project,  and expressed and  interest in talking
 
about foodways.
 I took her phone number--(207)  768-7901--and said
 
we might be calling her.
 
I poked around the barn a bit,  trying to stay out of the way.
 
I know next to nothing about barn construction,  but I saw a couple
 
of things which  indicated to me that this might be a fairly old
 
barn.
 Much of the framework was made from what looked to me like
 
large hewn timbers,  although there was what appeared to be milled
 
lumber as well.
 Also, there are large square-headed nails used in
 
the construction.
 Brassieur may want to  examine  this  barn more
 
closely, and I think it would be worthwhile to talk to Mrs. Gagnon,
 
as according to the people I talked to today she is in her 80s and
 
has lived in the area all her life.

Informant/Event:  Oakes,  Sam,  music party
 
Coworker:  Brassieur,  Ray;  Ornstein,  Lisa
 
Site:  Sam Oakes'  house in Fort Kent,  ME
 
This  fieldnote  describes  a music  party  and  family barbecue
 
held at the house of fiddler Sam Oakes in Fort Kent,  ME.
 
Sam Oakes is a fiddle and steel guitar player in a band called
 
the  Poor,  Poor  Woodsman.
 This  band  is  currently  playing  each
 
Saturday night in the bar/lounge at the Fort Kent Hotel.
 We had
 
first met him by chance on afternoon at Hoagie's,  a local sandwich
 
and ice cream shop.
 Lisa Ornstein had met him before,  and struck
 
up a conversation with him  (in French,  so I don't know what they
 
were talking about).
 Out of this came an invitation to come see
 
the band play,  and also to come to Sam's house on the coming Sunday
 
afternoon when there was to be a family music party.
 This seemed
 
like a good opportunity to hear and possibly record some of a local
 
fiddler's repertory,  so we planned to attend.
 
We arrived at Sam's house on North Perley Brook road in Fort
 
Kent  in  the  mid-afternoon.
 There  were  already  ten  or  fifteen
 
people there,  but the music had apparently not started.
 We set up
 
a Marantz  cassette  recorder  and  two  Sennheiser  microphones  with
 
omni-directional tips in the living room.
 Soon Sam and his brother
 
Merrill,  who played guitar,  sat down and begin to play.
 While I
 
wasn't  sure  quite  what  kind  of  tunes  to  expect,  the  tune  they
 
opened with was a shock--"Ragtime Annie."  I have always thought of
 
this as an old-time tune of British origin,  so  finding it as the
 
lead-off tune played by a fiddler in this heavily French area was
 
surprising.
 [I don't know Sam's family history, other than that he
 
was raised on the Canadian side of the St.  John River valley in a
 
town called Connors.
 Brassieur interviewed him during the course
 
of the party,  and I would presume that this information is in his
 
notes.]
 I listened to see if Sam's version differed from what I
 
would  expect  to  hear  in  Missouri,  and  observed  that  the  tempo
 
seemed  a bit  slower.
 Perhaps  this  is  just  Sam,  or  perhaps  it
 
represents a local style.  Also, the melody seemed to have a slight
 
irregularity  to  it;  I  don't  believe  I would  call  it  heavily
 
syncopated,  but Sam seemed to put the emphasis in different places
 
than I was used to hearing it.
 There is a third part to this tune
 
which is commonly played in Missouri,  but Sam did not play it.  [I
 
have  subsequently heard  several  other  fiddlers  in  the area  play
 
"Ragtime Annie,"  both live and,  in one case  (Alfred Parent)  in a
 
recorded  version.
 My  impressions  of  other  local  versions  are
 
similar to those formed listening to Sam's version; the rhythm and
 
emphasis  are  decidedly  different  than  a Missouri  version.
 The
 
version  played  by  Alfred  Parent  on  Traditional  Music  of  Maine,  
Volume I: Music of the St. John Valley is the only one I have heard
 
which does contain the third part; as in Missouri,  it modulates to
 
the key of C (the rest of the tune is in the key of G)].
 
Sam's repertory was an interesting one.
 It included several
 
old-time  tunes  with  which  I  was
 familiar
 ("Ragtime  Annie,"
 
"Soldier's
 Joy,"
 "Whiskey
 Before
 Breakfast,"
 "Forked
 Deer,"
 
"Clarinet Polka" are a few that I can recall),  a few reel/hornpipe
 
style  tunes  I  did  not  know,
 and  some  Bill  Monroe  bluegrass
 
standards done  as  instrumentals  (
"Uncle Pen,"  "Footprints  in the
 
Snow").
 [Again,  Brassieur  may  have  some  information  about  the
 
origin of Sam's repertory in his notes.]
 
In addition to its significance as a musical event,  the fact
 
that  this  was  a family  gathering  was  important.
 When  we  were
 
invited to Sam's house, the party was described in modest terms, as
 
if  there  would  be  a few  people  coming  over  for  a music  party.
 
Well, there must have been  forty or fifty people there,  including
 
members  of  both  Sam and his wife Maria's  immediate  families,  as
 
well as various cousins,  aunts,  uncles,  and friends.
 There were
 
four  generations  in  attendance;  Maria's  mother  represented  the
 
oldest,  and Maria and Sam's grandchild the youngest.
 If this is a
 
little weekend  family barbecue,  then  a big  family party must be
 
quite  an  affair.
 Several  people  told  me  that  they  have  these
 
gatherings  fairly regularly,  and that the host  family fixes side
 
dishes  and  everyone  brings  their  own  meat  to  barbecue.
 There
 
certainly was an abundance of food,  and although we did not bring
 
any we sure didn't go hungry.

Informant/ Event:  Centre  universitaire  St-Louis-Maillet;  Bérubé,
 
Adrien; Museum of the Societe Historique du Madawaska
 
Coworker:  none
 
Site:  Edmunston,  New Brunswick
 
This fieldnote describes a visit to the Centre universitaire
 
St-Louis-Maillet (CUSLM)  in Edmunston, New Brunswick, where I spoke
 
with Adrien Bérubé and visited the museum of the Societe Historique
 
du Madawaska.
 
Field coordinator Ray Brassieur and I had visited CUSLM on a
 
previous occasion at the invitation of Adrien Bérubé,  a professor
 
of  geography  at  the  Centre.
 We  first  met  Adrien  at  a June  5
 
advisory  meeting  held  at  the  University  of  Maine-Fort  Kent,  at
 
which  time  he  and  his  colleague  at  CUSLM,  Cyrille  Simard  had
 
extended an invitation to visit the Centre.  On our first visit, we
 
discussed the possibility of Adrien providing us with some resource
 
and reference material,  and one of the purposes of my trip today
 
was to pick up that material.
 In addition,  it seemed that there
 
would be a chance to visit the museum of the Societe Historique du
 
Madawaska,  a  Canadian  organization  which  puts  out  a quarterly
 
publication called Le Brayon.
 
I met Adrien at his office at about 6:00 p. m.
 He had a small
 
stack of books set aside that he thought we would be interested in,
 
and  as we  talked he picked  out  a few more.
 Since  all  of  these
 
books were in French,  it was hard for me to decide whether or not
 
they would be of value,  so I said I would take whatever he thought
 
we might want and let Brassieur look them over.
 
One topic I was particularly interested in was the historical
 
geography of transportation routes between the upper St. John River
 
Valley and both Bay Chaleur to the northeast and the St.  Lawrence
 
Valley  to  the  northwest.
 These  were  both  areas  of  French
 
settlement  in  the  17th  and  18th  centuries,
 yet  we  have  not
 
encountered any material concerning connections between these areas
 
and the study area during this period.  Adrien mentioned that there
 
had  at  one  time  been  a chain  of  French  forts  which  stretched
 
between the  St.  John Valley and the  St.  Lawrence,  and said that
 
there was  a restored  fort,  Fort  Ingall,  at  Cabana,  a city  some
 
forty  miles  northwest  of  Edmunston.
 He  also  mentioned  a book
 
titled  La  Grande Riviére by  Jacques  LaPointe,  which  he  thought
 
contained some material about the connection between the St.  John
 
Valley  and  Bay  Chaleur.
 He  also  said  that  he  thought  it  was
 
published in French only.
 
Adrien also  showed me  a couple  of  other  books which he had
 
only one copy of,  so he was unable to lend us a copy,  but I copied
 
the titles,  authors,  and publishers:
 
Antholoqie de Textes Litteraires 1606-1975
  
eds.  Marguerite Maillet
 
Gerard LeBlanc
 
Bernard E
rnont
 
published by Editions d'acadie
 
L'Acadie Perdue
  
Michel Roy
 
published by Editions d'acadie
 
L'Acadie des origines a
 nos-jours
  
Michel Roy
 
published by Editions d'acadie
 
Another  item of  interest mentioned by Adrien was a proposed
 
world-wide conference on Acadia to be held in 1993; he didn't have
 
any  details  but  thought  it  was  probably  going  to  be  held  in
 
southeastern New Brunswick.
 
We left the Centre and went to the museum about 7:00.
 There
 
was  a publication  party  being  held  there  by  Editions  d'acadie.
 
Since they seemed to publish a number of the books that Adrien both
 
loaned and suggested to us,  I was hopeful that I would be able to
 
obtain a catalogue.
 Unfortunately, the publisher's representative
 
who was there did not have any catalogues, so I gave him our office
 
address and asked if he would mail us one.
 
I met  Nicole  Lang,  a professor  of  history  at  CUSLM  whose
 
specialty was  labor history.
 She  said that  she had  collected a
 
good deal of oral labor history and folklore, and that she would be
 
willing  to  share  her  information.
 I think  she  would be  a good
 
resource person for further historical research.
 
Adrien showed me around the museum we looked at the current
 
exhibits.
 The facility itself is very nice,  not large but fairly
 
flexible in design;
 there are a number of movable walls,  so that
 
the size and shape of the exhibit space can be manipulated.
 There
 
is  a central  reception  area/hall,  where there  are  several  small
 
exhibits which appear permanent.  When I visited,  there were three
 
exhibits set up in the rooms to either side of the hall.
 One was
 
an  apparently regular  but  changing  exhibit of  the work of  local
 
artists,  which was widely varied in quality and content.
 Another
 
was  an  exhibit  of  religious  artifacts,  on  loan  from  a  single
 
collector, which included an amazing array of ossements, which are
 
bone  fragments  reputed to  be  from Catholic saints.
 There was  a
 
catalogue of this exhibit,  so I picked up a couple for our files.
 
The third was an exhibit of furniture and other objects on from the
 
collection  of  Don  Cyr  of  Lille,  ME.
 None  of  this  was  Acadian,
 
although  Don  does  have  a  large  collection  of  Acadian  items.
 
Apparently  there  is  going  to  be  an  exhibit  of  his  Acadian
 
collection sometime in the fall.
 
The permanent exhibits were quite interesting,  and had to do
 
with the history of the St.  John Valley.
 One told of the results
 
of an 1861 census of the area,  relating that on the average each
 
family had one or two horses,  two cows,  four pigs,  six sheep,  and
 
varied poultry.
 On the same wall was a section entitled "The Roots
 
of a Complete Society," which said that by 1851 Edmunston had "a
 
farmer,  merchant,  postmaster,  telegraph  operator,
 doctor,
 two
 
blacksmiths,  a day laborer,  a tailor,  and a shoemaker," while the
 
"priest and magistrate were close by."  Another exhibit dealt with
 
the  theme
 "Amerindians,"
 and  claimed  that
 around  1785
 [the
 
purported  year  in  which  the  first  Acadian  settlers  came  to  the
 
upper  St.  John  Valley]  there  was  a settlement  of  approximately
 
three hundred Malecite [my notes taken that evening do not mention
 
the word Malecite in this context, but my best recollection is that
 
the term was used]  just north of the present site of the city of
 
Edmunston,  but that they soon left because of "nomadic lifestyles
 
and the proximity of settlers."
 A third dealt with the migration
 
and settlement of the upper St. John Valley.
 This exhibit is hard
 
to  describe  without  a drawing,  and  I will  attempt  to  include  a
 
rough drawing in the project materials.
 The exhibit has lists of
 
names contained within two large arrows, which converge at a circle
 
in the center of the exhibit.
 The circle is divided horizontally
 
into thirds;  the top third is labeled St-Basile,  the bottom third
 
is  labeled  State  of  Maine,  and  the  middle  third  is  divided  by
 
vertical lines  into representations of the original long-lot land
 
grants with the names of the grantees written on their grant.
 One
 
of the arrows points toward the central circle from the top  left
 
corner,  which  is  labeled  "1787  au  St.  Laurent"  and contains  the
 
following  names:
 Levasseur,
 Beaulieu,
 Chaumet
 [sp?],  Guimond,
 
Michaud,  Ouellet,  Saucier,  Albert,  Gagne,  Soucy,  Dube.
 The other
 
arrow points at the circle from the bottom right corner,  labeled
 
"Ste-Anne  1785,"  and  contains  the  names  Cyr,  Dupery,
 Daigle,
 
Potier,  Ayottes,  Mercure,  Fournier,  Sanfacon,  Thibodeau.
 
An  interesting  element  of  this  last  exhibit  is  that  it
 
addresses in a straightforward manner the fact that the settlers of
 
the  study  area  came  from  both  Acadia  and  Québec.
 It  is  my
 
impression that this is not very openly discussed on the Maine side
 
of the river in the interpretive material on the area's settlement,
 
where much that is written and presented focuses almost exclusively
 
on the story of the Acadians.
 
In fact, one finds few references to Acadia or Acadians on the
 
Canadian side of the upper St.  John Valley.
 The reasons for this
 
are unclear,  but one factor seems to be an association of the term
 
Acadian with a political movement which advocates separatism from
 
federal  Canada.
 There  does  not  seem  to  be  a strong  separatist
 
sentiment  in  this  part  of  New Brunswick,  although  it  apparently
 
does  exist.
 There  is,  however,  a  strong  devotion  to  French
 
language and culture, as evidenced by the struggle, eventually won,
 
to
 statutorily
 establish
 a  bilingual
 (French
 and
 English)
 
educational  system.
 This  has  led  to  separate  systems  in  the
 
province,  with  separate facilities and personnel.
 In Edmunston,
 
the French school has many more students than the English school.
 
Just before leaving,  I met Aline Gagnon.
 She asked me  if I
 
had  heard  about  the  Foire  Brayonne  (which  I  had),  an  annual
 
festival held in Edmunston.
 I asked her about the term Brayonne,
 
which I have seen and heard used in several contexts to describe
 
Canadian residents of the upper St. John Valley.
 Aline repeats an
 
etymology  I  have  heard  from  other  sources,
 which  holds  that
 
travelers  along  the  St.
 John  River  observed  local  residents
 
breaking flax on the shore.  When the travelers would inquire about
 
the  activity,  the  answer  incorporated a form of  the  French word
 
brayer, to break;  also,  the device used was called a bray. 
Thus,
 
those engaged in the activity came to be called Brayonne.
 
Ms. Gagnon also spoke of the idea that there was a particular
 
ethnic blend which made up the group of people called Brayonne, and
 
related this idea to the six stars on the flag of the Republic of
 
Madawaska.
 Adrien Bérubé had spoken of this earlier,  saying that
 
many  people  have  the  story  of  the  six  different  groups  which
 
constitute the Brayonne, but that the six groups are not always the
 
same.
 Adrien's  list of potential contributors  included Acadian,
 
French, Canadian, Quêbecois, Scottish, Irish, English, and American
 
Indian  (or Malecite),  which he claimed to have heard combined in
 
many different ways.
 Ms.  Gagnon's  list of six  included Acadian,
 
Québecois,  Scottish,  Irish,  English,  and  a group  she  called  "au
 
Thoctone,"  which  she  said was  "the premier  nation,"  an apparent
 
reference to the Malecite.
 She also mentioned the presence of the
 
eagle  on  the  flag  of  the  Republic  of  Madawaska,  which  she  said
 
symbolized the American influence.
 
As I was leaving,  I asked if there were any general brochures
 
or other printed  information about the museum,  and was told that
 
they were currently out of their brochures.

Informant/ Event: Acadian Festival Fiddlers' Jamboree; LeBlanc, Leo;
 
Albert,  Victor;  Cormier,  Joe
 
Coworker:  none
 
Site:  Centennial Park,  Madawaska,  ME
 
This  fieldnote describes  an informal afternoon jam session,
 
featuring some of the musicians who were scheduled to play at Les
 
Violons  d'Acadie  that  evening.
 Les  Violons  d'Acadie  was  a
 
performance/dance
 which
 was
 part
 of
 the
 Acadian
 Festival
 
activities.
 
This  jam  session,  which was  held  in  a gazebo  in Centennial
 
Park, was a late addition to the schedule of events for the Acadian
 
Festival.
 As  I understood  it,  the musicians who were to be the
 
focal  point  of  the  session were  fiddlers  Leo  LeBlanc and Victor
 
Albert,  both  originally  from New Brunswick but  now residents  of
 
Massachussets.
 They  would  be  accompanied  by  guitar  player  Joe
 
Cormier  of  Massachusetts.
 Harmonica  player  and  dancer  Arcade
 
Richard,  another transplant  from New Brunswick to Massachusetts,
 
was also going to perform.
 The purpose of the jam session was,  I
 
believe,  to generate some publicity for and interest in an event
 
schduled  for  that  evening,  Les  Violons  d'Acadie,  which  was  to
 
feature  the  same  musicians.
 It was  also  hoped  that  some  local
 
musicians would participate,  and perhaps be encouraged to perform
 
at the evening event as well.
 
The session was scheduled to begin at 2:00 p. m., and I arrived
 
at the park just after 2:00.
 There was a small group of people,
 
perhaps eight or ten,  standing in a fairly large,  elevated gazebo
 
which stood near the center of the park.
 As I got out of my truck,
 
a could hear the sounds of instruments being tuned.
 I walked over
 
to the gazebo and saw that most of the people there were musicians;
 
I counted three fiddles,  one guitar,  one banjo,  and one mandolin.
 
They were all tuning and conversing in French.
 As I returned to my
 
car to get my cameras,  the group started playing a tune that was
 
unfamiliar  to  me.
 It  was  a medium-fast  tune  with  pronounced
 
syncopation,  as  if every other note was a dotted note,  a type of
 
tune  I associated with hornpipes.
 It was  a very windy but warm
 
day,  and I thought there would most likely be too much wind noise
 
to record.
 I got my cameras and returned to the gazebo,  where by
 
now the  group  had  begun  a second  tune,  similar  in  style  to  the
 
first.
 
I listened and took a few photographs,  and when that tune was
 
finished  a young  man  (in  his  30s,  I would  say),  who  had  been
 
playing mandolin, came over and introduced himself as Paul LeBlanc.
 
I had  heard  his  name  mentioned  before  by  both  project  field
 
coordinator  Ray  Brassieur  and Acadian  Festival  personnel,  and  I
 
knew he was  one of the  organizers of  the  jam  session and of  Les
 
Violons d'Acadie.
 I introduced myself,  and expressed my happiness
 
that  someone was  interested  and willing to put  on these musical
 
events.  Paul said he was very interested in the music, and in fact
 
was  learning  to  play  fiddle  himself.
 I asked  him  about  the
 
musicians,  who  were  unknown  to  me,  and  he  told  me  they  were:
 
Victor Albert,  fiddle;  Leo LeBlanc,  fiddle;  a Mr.  Beaulieu,  whose
 
first name may be George but I'm not certain,  fiddle; Joe Cormier,
 
guitar;  and  Archie  Rouleau,  tenor  banjo.
 All  of  the musicians
 
currently reside in Massachusetts except Mr. Beaulieu, who lives in
 
Quebec.
 LeBlanc, Albert,  and Rouleau were all born in eastern New
 
Brunswick,  in the part which would historically have been a part of
 
Acadia.
 They  had  moved  to  Massachusetts  looking  for  work,  and
 
continued  to  play  music.
 [At  this  time,
 I  don't  have  any
 
biographical material on Paul LeBlanc,  other than that he was born
 
in the St.  John Valley,  in Madawaska I think.
 I was planning to
 
have him fill  out a biographical data  form,  but  he  left at  some
 
point during the session;  I didn't notice when.]
 
The music continued as we talked.
 The repertory was mixed,
 
mostly  the  faster  dance  tunes  that  I  would  call  reels  and
 
hornpipes,  with an occasional waltz,  and one tune that I thought
 
was probably a jig.
 The tempo was not unlike that I was used to
 
hearing in Missouri, perhaps a bit slower.
 The style of the tunes
 
was decidedly different,  though--more ornamentation in the form of
 
trills and grace notes, more syncopation, and greater use of drone
 
notes  played  on  open  strings.
 The  first  tune  I heard  which  I
 
recognized was  "Growling Old Man,  Cackling Old Woman,"  a tune  I
 
have heard played,  although not with great frequency,  in Missouri.
 
As I listened to this version,  I realized that the melodic emphasis
 
differed from versions I had heard in Missouri, and I found this to
 
be the case for every subsequent tune with which I was familiar;
 
these  included  "Ragtime  Annie,"
 "Soldier's  Joy,"  "Red  Wing,"
 
"Golden  Slippers,"  and  a  tune  which  sounded  very  much  like
 
"Mississippi  Sawyer."
 Another  feature  of  the  tunes  was  that,
 
unlike the Missouri versions,  there was often an irregular number
 
of measures  in a given part of a tune as well as either extra or
 
dropped beats in certain measures.  All of the players seemed to do
 
this,  Mr.  Beaulieu more than the others.
 
Many of  the tunes  that  I heard,  in  fact most of them,  were
 
ones  with which  I was  unfamiliar.
 At  one  point  I asked Victor
 
Albert about the repertory and the names of some of the tunes,  and
 
he replied that he didn't the names of most of them either, because
 
he learned them from tapes that his brother in New Brunswick would
 
send him.
 These were tapes of radio programs,  and did not include
 
the names of the tunes,  so Mr.  Albert had learned only the tunes
 
and not their  names.
 He went  on to  say that  his  repertory had
 
three main parts--tunes that he had learned in New Brunswick before
 
moving  to  Massachusetts,  tunes  that  he  had  learned  from  other
 
fiddle players in Massachusetts,  and the tunes he had learned from
 
the tapes sent by his brother.
 
The  dynamics  of  the  session  seemed  much  like  other  jam
 
sessions  I have  been  to  in  the  midwestern  and  western  United
 
States.
 The fiddlers would more or less take turns kicking off a
 
tune, usually without announcing a title.
 The fiddler who started
 
the  tune  would  play  it  through  two  or  three  times,  then  other
 
fiddlers would take the lead if they wanted.
 Usually, the fiddler
 
who started the tune would also end it.
 If one of the fiddlers was
 
unfamiliar with the tune,  he would often move away from the group
 
and try to follow along,  apparently in an effort to learn the tune
 
without interrupting the continuity;  sometimes,  if he felt he had
 
it well enough  figured out,  he would rejoin the group and take a
 
turn playing the lead.
 
Joe  Cormier's  style  of  rhythm  guitar  playing  was  very
 
percussive,  utilizing mostly closed chordal positions and lots of
 
damping the strings.
 I asked him about this,  and he said it was
 
not really typical of fiddle accompaniment for this type of music,
 
but that acoustic six-string guitar,  which is what he was playing
 
at this session  (a Martin D-35),  was not his main  instrument--he
 
mostly played steel guitar and electric guitar.
 I asked him about
 
the  variety  of  tunes  played,
 and  he  expressed  amazement  and
 
admiration for the ablility of fiddle players to remember all those
 
different melodies.  Then, he surprised me by saying he wished they
 
were  playing  Cajun  music,  which  gave  him  more  freedom  to  play
 
single-string lead guitar style.
 
As  I talked with Joe  Cormier,  the music  continued with  Leo
 
LeBlanc taking over on rhythm guitar.  His style contrasted sharply
 
with Cormier's using primarily first position chords with lots of
 
open strings and bass runs.
 It had a very lovely,  loping sort of
 
feel and nicely complemented the fiddling style.
 
The crowd of listeners was never very large, perhaps twenty at
 
its  peak,  and  most  people  stayed  for  fifteen  or  twenty  minutes
 
before leaving.
 I would guess that the crowd held fairly steady at
 
about fifteen for most of the session as people came and went.
 
Only one musician other than those originally mentioned joined
 
the session.
 I did not know who he was at the time,  but found out
 
a couple of weeks later that he was Paul-Emile Martin of Edmunston,
 
New Brunswick.
 Thus, there was only one local musician who played
 
at  the  session,  a  fact  which  I found  somewhat  disconcerting.
 
Surely there must be fiddle players in the area,  although we have
 
not encountered a great many.
 [In a later conversation with Lille,
 
ME,  resident Don Cyr,  he expressed the feeling that local players
 
might have felt that they were inadequate to play in the company of
 
the Massachusetts musicians.
 Certainly Paul-Emile Martin, who did
 
play  that  day,  and  Sam  Oakes,  whom  we  have  heard  on  previous
 
occasion,  are very  fine musicians who  could hold  their  own with
 
almost anyone.]
 
My overall impression of the event was that,  as a chance for
 
the  musicians,  most  of  whom  already  knew  each  other,  to  get
 
together  and  play,  it  was  a success.
 However,  as  a community
 
outreach to involve local people,  it fell a bit short.

structures to the north of the barn,  and what appeared to be two
 
occupied houses on the opposite  (west)  side of Beaulieu Rd.
 
After taking a few pictures of the barn from this location,  I
 
decided to  drive  past  it  on the  gravel  road to  the north  for  a
 
closer look.
 I drove slowly past and noticed that there was a door
 
in the west  end of the  first section,  and a brick chimney which
 
passed through the roof near the peak and extended approximately
 
six  feet  above  the  roof.
 A portion  of  the  first  and  second
 
sections  (and  possibly  the  third)  was  buried  in  the  ground;  it
 
appeared as if fill dirt had been piled up around the sides.
 This
 
construction  technique has  been  observed on  every potato  farm  I
 
have visited in the study area, but all the other partially-buried
 
barns I have seen so far have been configured in a T-shape.
 The
 
general term  for these  barns  is potato house,  and their primary
 
purpose is to serve as storage facilities for the potato crop after
 
it  is harvested.
 The dirt  embankments around the barns  seem to
 
serve two purposes,  temperature regulation and  loading platform.
 
The potato houses generally have doors in one end through which the
 
potatoes  can  be unloaded  from vehicles which have  driven up the
 
embankments.
 It should be noted that the term potato house is not
 
reserved  to  describe  only  these  barns;  large  storage  buildings
 
located  on  the  railway  lines,  which  are  used  to  store  the  crop
 
prior to shipment,  are also called potato houses.
 
Rather than stop at this time for a closer examination of this
 
barn,  I decided to continue driving east on the gravel road.
 The
 
road climbed a fairly steep slope to the top of a ridge which ran
 
approximately parallel to Beaulieu Rd.
 From the top of the ridge,
 
one could see back to the Saint John River valley, with a good view
 
of the hills to the north of the river in New Brunswick.
 Much of
 
the sloping land along this gravel road was cultivated,  both with
 
potatoes and with some type of grain.
 Several narrow dirt roads
 
led off in both directions,  usually at the border of a cultivated
 
field.  All of these roads were posted with "No Trespassing" signs.
 
After  stopping  near  the  top  of  the  ridge  and  taking  some
 
photographs,  I drove back down the ridge to the buildings on the
 
east side of Beaulieu Rd.  My plan was to examine them briefly and,
 
if  it seemed warranted,  attempt to locate the property owner and
 
obtain permission to document them more thoroughly.
 I parked just
 
east of the gravel road,  between what appeared to be an abandoned
 
house
 and
 a  multi-bayed
 storage
 shed
 of
 relatively
 recent
 
construction.
 A narrow dirt road led from the area in which I was
 
parked down the side of the slope to a barn which I had not seen
 
from  my  initial  vantage  point  on  Beaulieu  Rd.
 It  was  not  a
 
particularly  large  barn,  with  a lean-to  on  the  back  side  and  a
 
standard gabled roof.
 There were two wide doorways in the front,
 
one near the center and one on the right.
 The roof appeared to sag
 
a bit,  but the structure of the barn seemed reasonably sound.
 The
 
size  (relatively small)  and configuration  (gabled roof,  no  large
 
side bays)  seemed to indicate that this was perhaps an older barn.
 
I decided to  look inside.
 The interior construction of the barn
 
was  very  interesting;  most  of  the  joinery  had  been  done  with
 
mortises  and  tenons  and  pinned  with wooden pegs.
 There  was  no
 
ridgepole,
 but  the  crossbeams  and  rafters  were  supported  by
 
trusses,  a commonly observed technique.
 There were a number of
 
angled braces which had been  led through the vertical supporting
 
posts and pegged.
 The sill was made of very large (estimated 12-14
 
inches wide)  hewn timbers,  and most of the frame of the barn was
 
hewn  logs.
 Hewn  logs  have  been  observed  in  other  barns  in the
 
study area,  but I cannot recall a barn in which they are combined
 
with this type of joinery.
 In fact,  the only other place I could
 
recall  seeing  these  pinned  mortise  and  tenon  joints  was  in  the
 
Maison  Daigle--St-John,  a house  in  Clair,  New  Brunswick.
 This
 
house was,  according to the Clair Historical Society,  originally
 
constructed around 1848.
 While the joinery in the Morin barn is
 
not as complicated or fine as that in the Maison Daigle--St-John,
 
its similarity may indicate that the barn was built around the same
 
time.
 The
 extensive
 use
 of
 hewn
 timbers
 reinforces
 this
 
possibility.
 If this barn does date from the mid-19th century,  it
 
would quite likely be one of the oldest barns  in the study area.
 
Of further significance  is the fact that it is  still  in use;  the
 
current owner has farm equipment stored inside.
 
I decided to return to my vehicle and see  if  I could locate
 
the owner of the property to inquire about the barn,  and to see if
 
I could  spend  some time documenting  it  if  field  coordinator Ray
 
Brassieur  agreed  that  it  would  be  worthwhile.
 The  most  likely
 
source of information seemed to be the houses on the other side of
 
Beaulieu  Rd.
 As  I was  preparing  to  drive  over,
 two  people
 
approached riding an all-terrain vehicle.
 I could see that they
 
were a young man and woman,  late twenties to middle thirties was my
 
best guess.
 I greeted them and asked if this was their property,
 
and the woman replied affirmatively.  Further conversation revealed
 
that  this  was  her  father  FIRSTNANE  Norm 's
 farm.
 The  young
 
woman's  name  was  Maria;  she  currently  resided  in  Connecticut,
 
although she was born and raised on this farm.
 The young man was
 
her husband.
 He introduced himself,  but I am unable to remember
 
his name.
 I told them my name,  gave them one of the Maine Acadian
 
Culture Survey business cards, and told them a little bit about the
 
project.  Maria had some information about the farm; she remembered
 
that the barn I had been looking at had been used as a stock barn,
 
and was pretty sure that it pre-dated her grandfather, who was born
 
in  1902.
 She  indicated  that  she  thought her  father  and mother
 
would be willing to talk to me,  but that her  father wasn't home
 
right then.
 Her parents lived in one of the two houses across the
 
road  (an  older,  fairly  large  white  two-story  house)  while  her
 
brother lived in the other  (a newer white ranch-style house).
 Her
 
father and brother ran the  family  farm,  which  consisted of  400+
 
acres  in potatoes  and grain.
 I asked her what kind of grain it
 
was,  but she only knew the French word for it;  it was a word with
 
which I was unfamiliar.
 I asked her to spell  it,  but she could
 
not,  and indicated that she could still speak French but not write
 
it.
 I asked her about living in Connecticut,  and said I had heard
 
that  a large  number  of  French  people  from  this  area  had  moved
 
there.
 She confirmed my statement, and added that they had to move
 
away from the Saint John valley area to find work.
 She said that
 
she,  along with many others,  would return to Maine if there were
 
jobs.
 I thanked her for talking with me and said I would like to
 
talk with her parents some time.
 Since her father was not home,  I
 
planned to return at a later date.
 
That evening,  I discussed the barn and farm with Brassieur,
 
and he agreed that it sounded interesting.  We decided to return on
 
the  following  day,  June  30,  if we  had  the  time  and  inclination
 
after attending the Acadian Festival parade and closing ceremonies
 
in Madawaska.

This fieldnote describes a drive along State Highway 161 from
 
Fort Kent,  ME,  west to St.  Francis,  ME,  and back to Fort Kent on
 
June 29,  1991.
 
I had finished dinner at a restaurant in Fort Kent at about
 
5:30 p. m., and had some time to kill before a scheduled trip across
 
the Saint John River to Clair, New Brunswick, where I was planning
 
to attend a barn dance at a newly erected barn on the grounds of
 
the historic Maison Daigle--St.  Jean.
 Since I had yet to see any
 
of the Saint John River valley west of Fort Kent,  I decided to go
 
for a drive in that direction.
 
The trip was basically uneventful, and I thought that both the
 
natural and cultural landscape strongly resembled that of the rest
 
of the study area,  until I got to St.  Francis,  some 15 miles west
 
of Fort Kent.
 As I drove through the village,  I passed by a church
 
which stood on the main thoroughfare.
 This at first seemed quite
 
normal,  as  almost  every village here has  its  church on the main
 
road.
 I remember thinking how typical the scene looked,  with the
 
white clapboard church in the center of town,  and then I realized
 
that the "typical"  scene I was using for a reference was not one
 
from the St.  John River valley.
 Rather,  it was a scene from the
 
small towns in Vermont and New Hampshire,  where .
1 had lived for a
 
couple of years.
 Since these were always Protestant churches of
 
some type, usually Congregational, this suddenly became an atypical
 
scene compared to the other villages of the study area,  in which
 
the established church was Catholic.
 I turned around and returned
 
to the church-- the sign in front said:
 
St.  Paul's Congregational Church
 
United Church of Christ
 
First Gathered in 1886
 
There was a cemetary immediately behind the church,  so I took
 
a stroll  through  it  and  copied  down  many  of  the  names  on  the
 
markers:
 Henderson,  MacLean,  Lewis,  Johnson,  Stadig,  Morrison,
 
Mills,  Mullins,
 Connor,
 Kirk,
 Dow,
 O'Leary.
 There  were  two
 
Pelletiers and a Plourde,  but those were the only obviously French
 
names I could find.
 
By this  time  I just had  enough time to get  to  Clair,  N.B.,
 
where  I was  scheduled to  attend and document a barn dance,  so  I
 
left without further exploration of the town.
 I would have liked
 
to look around to see if there was a Catholic church, and to try to
 
determine if there was much of a French presence.
 
[A  later  trip through  St.  Francis,  as well  as  conversation
 
with
 study
 area
 residents,
 revealed
 that
 St.
 Francis
 is
 
predominantly  a  French  Catholic  town,
 and  there  is  indeed  a
 
Catholic church.
 It still seems to me that there is more of a non-
French presence  in  St.  Francis than  in other towns  in the  study
 
area.]

Date:  6/29/91
 
Informant/Event:  Barn dance;  Gagné,  Nicolo
 
Coworker:  Ornstein,  Lisa
 
Site:  Clair,  New Brunswick
 
This  fieldnote describes a trip to Clair,  New Brunswick,  on
 
June 29,1991,  to attend a barn dance,  and a brief  interview with
 
Nicolo Gagné at the site of the dance.
 
I first heard about this barn dance from field research team
 
member Lisa Ornstein,  who said that they had such dances in Clair
 
every so often,  and that they were usually well-attended and quite
 
fun.
 Ornstein was  scheduled to attend an alumni  banquet  at the
 
University of Maine-Fort Kent, and field coordinator Ray Brassieur
 
planned  to  go  to  the  Sirois-Duplessis  family  reunion  dinner  in
 
Madawaska,  so  it was decided that I would attend the barn dance.
 
I planned to audiotape and photograph the event if possible.
 
The dance,  which started at 7:30 p.m.  Eastern Daylight Time
 
(8:30  in New Brunswick,  which is  in the Atlantic Time Zone),  was
 
being held in a newly constructed barn on the site of the historic
 
Maison Daigle-St.  Jean.
 On a previous visit to the site we had
 
seen the barn,  at that time nearly finished,  and Brassieur spoke
 
with one of the carpenters who had built it.
 Although the barn is
 
constructed  of  modern materials,  the  carpenter  said that  it was
 
modelled after a traditional barn type of the area.
 It did indeed
 
resemble barns we have seen here--not  large  (perhaps twenty-five
 
feet  wide  and  forty  feet  long),  it  has  the  same  type  of  roof
 
supporting structure we have seen in almost every barn in the study
 
area, with rafters which are lapped and attached at the peak of the
 
roof and supported by beams and trusses,  but no ridgepole.
 This
 
absence  of  a  ridgepole  seems  to  be  one  of  the  characteristic
 
features  of  construction  in the  study area.
 The  outside  of the
 
barn was sided with two different materials.
 The majority of the
 
siding was done with sawn boards and laths attached vertically, but
 
a portion of the  lower walls was  sided with shakes.
 This was  a
 
feature we had observed in a barn on Roland Perrault's property on
 
Route 11 in Wallagrass, NE.  Apparently the shakes provide superior
 
insulation,  and  were  used  on  the  sections  of  the  barn  in which
 
livestock was kept.
 I'm no carpenter,  but this looked like a very
 
nice piece of work to me.
 
I  arrived  about  forty-five  minutes  before  the  dance  was
 
scheduled to begin.
 There was a group of perhaps fifteen people
 
inside the barn;  some of them were setting up a sound system,  some
 
were unpacking and tuning  instruments,  and some were  in  a small
 
side room preparing for food and drink service.
 A number of small
 
tables were arranged in front of built-in benches which lined the
 
2
 
walls,  and the center of the floor was empty--the dance floor,  I
 
supposed.
 I walked around inside the barn for a few minutes to see
 
what  the  possibilites  were  for  setting  up  a  microphone.
 It
 
appeared  as  if  the  best  location would  be  in  the  loft  opposite
 
where the band was setting up,  as this seemed like the only place
 
where  it would  not  be  in  the way.
 I thought  that  if  I set  up
 
directly beneath the front edge of the loft on one of the benches
 
and tables along the wall,  the cord would easily reach  from the
 
recorder to the microphone, so the only problem would be in getting
 
the mike up in the loft and still have it positioned corrrectly to
 
pick up the music.
 I stood on a bench and found that it was a long
 
stretch,  but it could be done.
 
I then  approached  the  group  of  musicians  to  inquire  about
 
getting permission to tape the event.
 I introduced myself to a man
 
who, while not actively involved with the setting up of instruments
 
and sound equipment, was talking with the people who were.  He said
 
his name was Nicolo Gagné,  and that his wife would be one of the
 
singers that evening.
 He  indicated that these musicians weren't
 
really  a band,  but  that  they  got  together  to  play  in  various
 
combinations at various times.
 He himself played the spoons,  and
 
showed me a nice collection instruments,  some of which were carved
 
from wood  (not by Mr. Gagné---he said he bought them from people in
 
Québec and New Brunswick)  and some of which he had made himself by
 
fastening large kitchen spoons to wooden handles.
 I photographed
 
several of these instruments.
 
I then asked Mr.  Gagné about his personal history.
 He said
 
that he was born in Clair in 1924; his parents were Aiphé  (father)
 
and Delia Gagné,  both  from Clair.
 His mother's maiden name was
 
Albert,  and her  parents  came  from Québec,  while  on his  father's
 
side he claimed his heritage was "half Acadian and half Indian."
 
I asked  him  if  the  Indian  half  was  Micmac  or  Malecite,  and  he
 
replied,  "No,  Iroquois."
 I expressed  surprise  at this,  since  I
 
don't think of an Iroquois presence this far north,  although there
 
are stories  (e. g.  the legend of Malobiannah)  of Mohawk incursions
 
into the St. John River valley.  He didn't elaborate on this, other
 
than to repeat that it was indeed Iroquois.
 
Mr.  Gagné had moved with his family to Portland,  ME,  at the
 
age  of  fifteen,
 as  his  father  migrated  seeking  work  in  the
 
sawmills.  He claimed that a large number of people from Québec and
 
New Brunswick did likewise during this period, many of them moving
 
from Canada to different parts of Maine and back to Canada several
 
times during their lives as they followed work in the mills.
 In
 
1947, Mr. Gagné moved to Michigan, where he worked as a  
 
until 1986,  when he retired and moved back to Clair.
 His current
 
address and phone are:
 
Nicolo Gagné
 
113 Rue Principale
 
Clair,  N.B.
 E06-1BO
 
phone:  (506)  992-3833
 
One of the intriguing topics mentioned by Mr. Gagné during our
 
conversation involved the smuggling of alcohol from Canada to the
 
United States.
 According to Mr.  Gagné,  there was  at one time a
 
large hotel in Clair,  just west of the bridge across the St.  John
 
River  (which  is  where  the  customs  house  is  located).
 Bootleg
 
liquor made in St-Pierre-Miquelon, a French-administrated island in
 
the Atlantic Ocean just south of Newfoundland, would be shipped to
 
this hotel in Clair.
 The hotel had some type of false floor and
 
elevator  system  which  enabled  the  liquor  to  be  hidden  from  the
 
customs agents after it was unloaded.
 Then,  in the night it would
 
be  transported  across  the  river  and  delivered  to  men who  were,
 
according  to  Gagné,  a  part  of  Al  Capone's  operation.
 Other
 
informants have described the smuggling of liquor,  but this is the
 
first I have heard about the hotel and the involvement of Al Capone
 
[In  later  conversation  with  Lise  Pelletier,
 a  friend  of  Lisa
 
Ornstein,  she  relates  that  she has  also heard  this  story].
 Mr.
 
Gagné's  information is consistent with that collected from other
 
informants
 in
 several
 regards;
 the
 location
 of
 the
 liquor
 
production  (St-Pierre-Miquelon),  the  name  of  the  liquor  (
"white
 
rum"),  and the container  in which the liquor is  shipped  (a  large
 
metal can with a picture of a white hand on it).
 Mr.  Gagné was a
 
young boy during the heyday  of this  smuggling  operation,  but he
 
recalls  finding  a number  of  empty  "white  hand"  containers  in  a
 
vacant lot in Clair.
 
Another  interesting topic mentioned by Mr.  Gagne  is  "ship's
 
knees."
 These  are  large  pieces  of  wood which  bend  at  a ninety
 
degree angle on one side and have a smooth curve on the opposite
 
side;  they  are  made  from  pieces  sawn  from  the  root  and  bole
 
sections  of  the  tree,  where  the  natural  curve  of  the  wood  is
 
maintained.
 The most familiar use for these pieces,  according to
 
Brassieur,  is in the attachment of large members to each other in
 
boat  construction--for  example,  connecting  the  framework  of  the
 
hull to the beams which support the deck.
 However,  we have seen
 
these "ship's knees" used in house construction in the study area.
 
The  Fred  Albert  house  in  Madawaska,
 constructed  in  the  mid-
nineteenth century,  has two of them in the attic,  where they are
 
attached with drift pins to both a vertical timber which is part of
 
the  framing and  a joist.
 We have heard of this  technique being
 
used in other buildings in the study area, including houses, barns,
 
and churches.
 Mr.  Gagné asks if I have visited the Maison Daigle-
St-Jean  (a mid-nineteenth century house which is situated next to
 
the barn)  and seen the ship's knees in the attic, which I have.
 He
 
remembers that, when he was a child, his father would sometimes cut
 
a ship's knee if he found just the right tree.
 It had to be some
 
kind  of  hardwood,  and  Gagné  specifically  mentioned  maple  and
 
cherry.
 Since  this  would  have  been  in  the  1920s  or  1930s,  I
 
thought it would havve been very unusual to see such pieces used in
 
house  construction;  indeed,  our  information would  indicate  that
 
this was a mid-to-late nineteenth century technique.
 I asked Mr.
 
Gagné if the ship's knees that his father made were used to build
 
houses,  and he replied that they were not,  as far as he knew.
 His
 
recollection was that they were sold to a local merchant who would
 
transport them to another place, and that they were presumably used
 
by  shipbuilders.
 This  suggests  that  there  is  an  interesting
 
continuity  at  work  here:
 a maritime  construction  technique  is
 
carried  inland  by a maritime people  (the Acadians),  where  it  is
 
applied to house and barn-building;  then,  when they no longer use
 
it to build their own structures,  but the knowledge and materials
 
are still available, they manufacture the product for use by other
 
maritime builders  (who may well have been Acadian).
 
After we had talked for a while, Mr. Gagné walked back with me
 
to where the musicians were setting up.
 It was nearly time for the
 
dance to begin,  and people had started to arrive.
 I wanted to get
 
set up to record if I could,  so with Mr.  Gagné's help I explained
 
briefly what I was doing and asked the musicians  if they had any
 
objections to my recording the event.
 There were none,  so I went
 
to set up one of the Sennheiser microphones in the loft,  using a
 
cardiod tip and angling the mike at about a forty-five degree angle
 
down to point at one of the speakers of the sound system.
 I set up
 
a Marantz cassette recorder to record in mono.
 
The band started off with a lively instrumental with which I
 
was unfamiliar,  but if I were to hang a label on it I would call it
 
a reel.
 I used this  song to set recording levels,  and began to
 
record as the band started their second song, which to my surprise
 
was  "The  Battle  Hymn  of  the  Republic."
 Since  I have  always
 
associated this  hymn with the American Civil War,  hearing  it  in
 
this context raises a few questions.
 Where did they learn it?  Why
 
do  they play  it  at  a dance?
 Is  there  some  political  symbolism
 
(e.g.
 the  "Republic"  could  be  the  Republic  of  Madawaska,
 a
 
geographic  entity  established  in  1873,  which  has  no  official
 
standing as part of the federal system of Canada but does seem to
 
have  symbolic  socio-political  content  for  Canadian  residents  of
 
this part of the St.  John River valley,  which it encompasses)?
 
More information needs to be gathered about this.
 
The band continues with several  instrumentals,  a mixture of
 
reels and a waltz.
 There is no announcement of the names of any
 
tunes, and I am unfamiliar with them.
 The tempo of the reels seems
 
a bit slower than I am used to hearing from Missouri fiddlers,  and
 
the melodies, while not complicated are well ornamented with trills
 
and grace notes.
 Many of the tunes have an uneven number of beats
 
per bar;  the most common form of this  seems to  be a bar with an
 
extra beat near the end of one of the parts.
 In addition,  few of
 
the tunes conform to the "eight-bars and repeat" A-A-B-B formula--
nine or possibly ten bars per part is not uncommon,  and each part
 
is not always repeated.
 The rhythmic pulse of the tune  is well-
maintained in spite of these irregularities in the pattern.
 
After four or five of these instrumentals, the band begins to
 
mix in some songs.
 The first one is sung in French,  and I do not
 
know its title or what it is about.
 The next song,  which follows
 
immediately  and  is  sung  in  English,  is  "Good-Hearted Woman,"  an
 
American country music song popularized by a Willie Nelson/Waylon
 
Jennings collaborative version.
 American country and country-and-
western music  seems to  be very popular on both the American and
 
Canadian sides  of the St.  John River;  we have heard it played on
 
3
 
jukeboxes and by live bands in bars,  and there is quite a bit of it
 
to  be  found  on  both  American  and  Canadian  radio  stations.
 The
 
pattern established by these last few tunes and songs is reapeated
 
throughout the evening--several instrumentals of mixed styles and
 
tempos,  from  reels  to  waltzes  and  an  occasional  jig,  will  be
 
followed by a song or two,  some sung in French and some in English.
 
The songs sung in English are almost all popular country music from
 
the 1950s on,  songs like "Please Release Me" and '
" 
I am not
 
familiar with any of the French songs,  nor do I recognize any of
 
their  melodies,  so  I do  not  believe  they were  popular  American
 
music translated into French.
 I plan to ask the band about this if
 
they ever take a break, which they show no sign of doing even after
 
two hours  of  continuous playing.
 I have noticed  that there  are
 
longer breaks between songs,  sometimes several minutes,  than I am
 
used to at musical events in the United States; perhaps this is the
 
norm,  instead  of  the  more  familiar  (to  me)  pattern  of  shorter
 
breaks between songs and a break of ten or fifteen minutes out of
 
each
 hour
 the
 band
 plays.
 I  do
 recognize
 some
 of
 the
 
instrumentals--"Soldier's  Joy,"  "Ragtime  Annie,"  and  "Red  Wing"
 
stick in my mind,  and I heard one tune that sounded quite similar
 
to "Mississippi Sawyer."  These are tunes one might hear a fiddler
 
play at a dance or music party anywhere in the United States,  and
 
I am reminded of a comment made by John Connors of St. Francis, ME,
 
at a music party at Sam Oakes'  house in Fort Kent,  "A good fiddle
 
tune is like dye; you drop it in the water and it spreads out."
 
The particular versions of these tunes which I am hearing tonight
 
do seem to bear the stamp of the French-Canadian fiddlers  I have
 
heard on previous occasion here in the study area; the melodies may
 
get a bit "crooked," and there may be an irregular number of beats
 
and/or  bars,
 but  keeping  the  rhythm  going
 is
 of  paramount
 
importance.
 
The  crowd has  been growing  steadily  since  the  start  of  the
 
dance.
 After  an hour or  so,  the available  seating  is taken and
 
people are still arriving,  so a couple of large picnic tables are
 
dragged in and placed on the dance floor directly in front of where
 
the band is set up.
 There are some minor complaints about the loss
 
of dancing space,  but there is still a fair amount of room on the
 
dance floor.
 The crowd is quite mixed in age and demeanor.
 There
 
are  people  in  their  20s  and  people  who  might  be  in  their  80s.
 
Everyone wears comfortable and fairly casual clothing.  A number of
 
people  seem  content  to  sith  quietly  and  watch  and  listen,  and
 
perhaps drink a beer or two.
 Others are fairly boisterous, and the
 
air is full of banter  (in French)  interspersed with an occasional
 
whoop or holler.
 No one dances  for the  first  fifteen or twenty
 
minutes,  but  then  a few  couples  begin  to  dance  to  some  of  the
 
reels,  using what looks to me like a polka-type of step.
 A waltz
 
brings eight or ten couples on to the dance floor.
 One senses the
 
momentum  building  as  the  crowd  increases,  and  the  arrival  of  a
 
group of ten or twelve young men and women seems to be the catalyst
 
for  a  series  of  group  dances.
 These  are  quite  frenetic  and
 
unorganized.
 There seems to be some sort of pattern which serves
 
as the basis  for these dances,  but  it  is  followed  in a somewhat
 
disjointed manner,  as one or two of the dancers who have some idea
 
of organizing the others shout directions.
 I participate in one of
 
the dances,  which  begins  with  all  the dancers  joining hands  and
 
moving  counterclockwise  in  a big  circle,  switching  to  clockwise
 
after a minute or two,  and then breaking down into couples, who do
 
a dosey-do in both directions.
 Somehow,  someone manages to gather
 
all the women in the center and the men join hands and dance in a
 
circle around them.
 Next,  back to couples for some more dosey-do,
 
following which all the men get in the center and clap while the
 
women dance  in  a circle.
 One more round of  couples dosey-do  is
 
followed by the re-formation of the all dancers in a large circle,
 
and we  finish  as  we  began.
 Believe me,  the  actual  fact  of  the
 
dance was even  less organized than my description of  it,  but the
 
band kept up a good strong rhythm and everyone enjoyed the dancing.
 
In between the group dances, which were infrequent,  the band would
 
play  a few songs  and  slower  instrumentals,  during which  couples
 
would dance.
 
At  about  9:30  p.m.,  I noticed  Nicolo  Gagné  walking  around
 
during a lull in the music.
 I wanted to find out the names of the
 
musicians,  so  I went  over  to  ask  him.
 He  told  me  that  the
 
musicians were all from Clair,  N.B.
 They were:
 
Pat Albert,  fiddle
 
Roger St.  Onge,  accordian
 
Norman Oakes,  guitar
 
Gerald Lavoie,  guitar and vocal
 
Monique Rossignol,  guitar and vocal
 
Mr.  Gagné played spoons on a number of the tunes.
 He also pointed
 
out again that this was "just a group of amateurs" and not a "real"
 
band.
 
I quit recording after the first ninety-minute cassette was
 
full.
 The crowd was fairly noisy by that time,  and I wasn't sure
 
how much  longer  I wanted  to  stay,  so  I packed up  the  recording
 
gear.
 I did miss  getting  one particularly  interesting piece  of
 
music  on  tape--a  "rockabilly"  medley  of  "Blue  Suede  Shoes"  and
 
"Rock Around the Clock," with a fiddle and accordian break and a
 
"shave-and-a-haircut"  ending.
 Lisa Ornstein had arrived a short
 
while before,  and as we listened to this piece she pointed out the
 
lack of the  flatted  "blue"  notes one would hear  in the original
 
version,
 and  probably  in  most  subsequent  versions  played  by
 
American  musicians.
 The  versions  from  which  these  musicians
 
learned the songs probably contained those flatted notes, but they
 
just didn't seem to be part of their musical vocabulary,  so they
 
substituted notes from the major scale.
 
I stayed at the dance until about 11:30.
 Both the crowd and
 
the band were still going strong as I left.

Site:  Hoagie's Deli in Fort Kent,  ME
 
This fieldnote describes a chance encounter with Sam Oakes and his
 
wife Maria while  I was having  lunch  at Hoagie's,  a deli  and  ice
 
cream shop on Market St.  in Fort Kent.
 
I had ordered a sandwich and was waiting for it to arrive when
 
Sam and Maria came over to my table and sat down.
 Sam is a fiddle
 
player who lives  in Fort Kent;  he plays  in a country band called
 
the Poor,  Poor Woodsman,  and also plays old-time fiddle at house
 
parties
 (usually
 at
 his
 house)
 and
 occasionally
 at
 public
 
functions.
 Our conversation turned to  "Les Violons d'Acadie,"  a
 
performance,  jam session,  and dance which was part of the Acadian
 
Festival.
 The project team had attended and recorded this event,
 
and  Sam was  also  there  and played  a few tunes.
 The  "featured"
 
musicians had come up from Massachusetts, and although the fiddlers
 
(Leo LeBlanc and Victor Albert) were originally from New Brunswick,
 
Sam described their playing as "southern style."
 I asked how this
 
differed from the style he played,  and he replied that the bowing
 
and emphasis were different.
 In fact, he said one of the fiddlers
 
from Massachusetts had remarked that he wished he could play "Jolie
 
Blonde" the way Sam did,  but he couldn't drag his bow properly.
 I
 
asked Sam how he learned to play "Jolie Blonde," and he said he had
 
learned it from a Balfa Brothers recording.
 
We talked a bit about the state of old-time instrumental music
 
in the Saint John Valley today,  and both Sam and Maria were fairly
 
pessimistic  about  its  future.
 They  gave  two  major  reasons  for
 
this; lack of a performance venue,  and lack of incentive  (no jobs)
 
for young people to stay in the area and learn traditional music.
 
As  Sam  put  it,  "Even  if  you  do  try  to  teach  your  son  to  play
 
traditional  music,
 chances  are  he'll  leave  when  he  gets  to
 
seventeen or  eighteen  and  graduates  from  school."
 There was  no
 
mention of the fate of daughters.
 
On the subject of a performance venue, Sam and Maria expressed
 
a hope that  "the government"  could provide such a facility.
 Sam
 
said
 that
 the
 only
 time
 that
 the
 local
 governments
 and
 
organizations contact the traditional musicians is when they want
 
them to play a benefit of some sort.
 
Sam  mentioned  that  there  are  a  few  house  parties,  which
 
usually happen on Saturdays during the day,  which provide one of
 
the  few  settings  in  which  traditional  music  is  played.
 He
 
mentioned the possibility combining some of these parties  into a
 
larger event.
 I encouraged him to pursue that idea.
 
As we were leaving,  Sam told me that Simon St-Pierre had made
 
him a new fiddle.
 Mr.  St-Pierre is a fiddler  (and apparently an
 
instrument maker,  although I had not known that before today)  who
 
lives in Smyrna Mills, a town in southern Aroostook County;  he has
 
been  somewhat of a mentor  for Sam.
 I said that I would love to
 
see, hear, and possibly photograph the instrument, and Sam replied
 
that Simon would be in Fort Kent the following weekend, probably on
 
Friday,  and that we would be welcome to come over.
 I said that I
 
would very much  like to,  and  so would Ray I was  sure,  and Maria
 
said that she would call us with details.
 [I am eager to hear Mr.
 
St-Pierre; Sam is one of the best musicians we have encountered in
 
the  study  area,  and  I would  very much  like to  hear  some  of  his
 
influences].

Informant/ Event:  Native  American  Day,  Grande  Riviére  Festival;
 
Frigon,  Guy
 
Coworker:  Brassieur,  Ray
 
Site:  Acadian Village,  Van Buren,  ME
 
This fieldnote describes an event called Native American Day,
 
which was  part  of  the  Grande  Rivière  Festival.
 The  area  which
 
contains  the  present-day  communities  of  Van  Buren,  ME,  and  St-
Leonard,  N.B.,  was  once  known  as  Grande  Rivière,  and  those  two
 
communities
 combine
 to
 put
 on
 this
 annual
 festival;
 also
 
participating is the town of Ste-Ouenne,  in the Loire River Valley
 
in France,  to which many of the early settlers  of Grande Rivière
 
trace their ancestry.
 
The event was scheduled to begin at 1
:00 p. m.;  I arrived at
 
about  12:30,  hoping  to  get  some  pictures  and  meet  some  of  the
 
participants before the event began.
 When I arrived,  I saw that
 
there was a tipi set up on the grounds,  so I went over to see what
 
was  happening.
 Next  to  the  tipi,  there  was  a group  of  people
 
standing around a drum; they seemed to be discussing plans for the
 
event,  and  I took a few pictures.
 They then began drumming and
 
singing,  apparently  in  rehearsal,  and  I took  a few pictures  of
 
this.
 A short  distance  away,  another  group  was  unloading  what
 
looked like paintings and beadwork items from a station wagon.  One
 
mand in particular seemed to be directing most of the acitivities,
 
and when I got a chance I introduced myself to him.
 His name was
 
Guy Frignon,  and he lived  in Upper Frenchville,  ME.
 He said his
 
Indian  name  was  Big  Heart.
 His  mother  was  a Micmac  from  New
 
Brunswick,  while his father was born in France of a French father
 
and a Cree Indian mother.
 Guy was born in ?? T?,  New Brunswick.
 
I  asked  Guy  what  groups  would  be  represented  at  Native
 
American Day;  he replied that there would be Micmac from the Red
 
Bank Reserve and Burnt Church Reserve,  both in New Brunswick,  some
 
Malecite  (he didn't specify where from),  and hopefully some of the
 
Micmac Band from Presque Isle,  ME.
 
Guy then told me a litle bit more about himself.
 He said that
 
he was  a medicine walker,  but  said to be sure not to call him a
 
medicine man--that term was reserved for people who had died.
 He
 
described a medicine walker as a Micmac spiritual healer,  adding
 
that  he  performed  such
 functions
 as
 sweat
 lodges  and  pipe
 
ceremonies.
 It was almost time for the event to begin,  and a
 
fairly good crowd had gathered--I would estimate nearly 100 people--
so  we  ended  our  conversation  and  Guy  went  to  prepare  for  the
 
ceremonies.
 
Guy  served  as  the  narrator  for  the  ceremonies,  which  began
 
3)
 
with a blessing and purification of the drum and the participants.
 
This was done with a large  braid of what Guy called  sweetgrass,
 
which was  ignited but  smoldered rather than burning.
 The  smoke
 
from the sweetgrass braid was the purifying agent,  and each person
 
in turn was exposed to it.
 A man named Kenny Cloud,  a Micmac from
 
the Red Bank Reserve,  circulated through the crowd with the braid
 
and a feather fan, offering the smoke so that all everyone could be
 
purified.
 Meanwhile,  others  (including  Guy)  began  to  drum  and
 
sing.
 Guy had explained prior to the purification ceremony that
 
the drum represented "the heartbeat of the nation."
 
A  pipe
 cermony
 followed  the  purification
 ritual.
 Guy
 
explained that his pipe,  which would be used  in the cermony,  was
 
made  of  "calonite"  (spelling?),  a "sacred  Indian  redstone,"  and
 
that  no  steel  was  used  in  its  manufacture.
 He  used  the  widely
 
distributed term calumet in describing the pipe,  which had a bowl
 
in the shape of a coiled snake.
 Guy said that this was because he
 
was a member of the Rattlesnake Clan;  to become a member,  he was
 
required to allow himself to be bitten five times by a rattlesnake,
 
and then spend several days alone in a cave without food or water.
 
Many eyes in the crowd got wide at the recitation of this tale, and
 
there were several audible gasps.
 Guy then loaded the pipe with
 
sweetgrass tobacco, while offering four prayers--one to each of the
 
four corners of the earth, each of which corresponded to one of the
 
colors of the human races.
 The proper way to hold the pipe was
 
demonstrated--one hand on the stem and the other under the bowl.
 
The pipe was then lit with the smoldering sweetgrass braid, and Guy
 
was the first to smoke,  followed by the other Micmac.
 Then, Kenny
 
Cloud and another young man began to circulate through the crowd
 
with the pipe,  as Guy described the correct direction in which to
 
pass it.
 He warned that the pipe should go in only one direction
 
(
"what you white people call clockwise"),  so  it should be passed
 
only directly to your  left  or directly behind.
 As  the pipe was
 
being passed,  Guy commented on the circularity of the Indian ideas
 
about  nature  and methods  of  construction,  adding  that  it  seemed
 
like "the white man builds everything in a square."
 
As  the  crowd was  fairly  sizable,  the purification  and pipe
 
cerinonies took a considerable amount of time.
 It was interesting
 
to observe the spectators  as these ceremonies were taking place;
 
restlessness  set  in  rather  quickly,
 and  I  overheard  several
 
comments to the effect that they there should be more activity,  a
 
faster  pacing  of  the  event.
 The  notion  that  the  ceremony  was
 
important in its own right, and that one should wait peacefully for
 
it to conclude,  was not widely entertained.
 
Following the pipe ceremony,  there were several dances.
 The
 
first was a dance to honor the elders,  and several of the oldest
 
members of the crowd were seated directly in front of the drum.
 A
 
step was demonstrated, and the dance was begun by having several of
 
the Micmac form a short line.
 As they passed,  those in the crowd
 
who wished to join the dance could fall  in behind,  joining hands
 
with  the  person  in  front  of  them.
 The  line  proceeded  in  a
 
clockwise circle around the outer perimeter of the spectators,  and
 
then moved to the inner perimeter where it circled the drum several
 
times.
 Guy and three others,  a man and two women,  were drumming
 
and singing to provide the rhythm for the dance.
 When this dance
 
was finished,  four or five of the Micmac performed two more dances,
 
with  the  same  group  drumming  and  singing.
 The  crowd  began  to
 
disperse  during  this  time,
 and  after  these  two  dances  the
 
ceremonies were concluded for the afternoon.
 Guy announced that
 
there were more activities planned for the evening,  and that there
 
would be a bonfire.
 
I talked  with  Guy  a bit more  after  the  ceremonies.
 I was
 
interested in the drum,  and when I asked about it he repeated that
 
it represented "the heartbeat of the nation."  He said that he had
 
made that drum himself,  and that it was a "hollow cedar drum" made
 
with a beef hide.
 He claimed that beef was the most common hide
 
used today,  but that in "the old days" dog hides were often used,
 
and that they made the best drums.
 I asked how he had learned to
 
make  drums,  and  he  replied  that  he  was  taught  by  a man  named
 
Rainbow Watcher who lived in British Columbia.
 
Guy also  related that he had been  charged  by tribal  elders
 
with the mission of educating others about Indian culture,  and it
 
was  to  that  end  that  he  involved  himself  in  presentations  like
 
today's.
 He said that his pipe,  for example,  had been empowered
 
with  the  ability  to protect  itself  against  impure handlers,  and
 
that was the reason he could allow it to be circulated through a
 
crowd.  He indicated that, should he so desire, he "could stay busy
 
twenty-four  hours  a day,"  such  was  the  volume  of  requests  for
 
presentations.
 He said that he also did quite a bit of spiritual
 
work,  with both Indians and whites,  and told of a sweat lodge he
 
had given for a group of men near Augusta.
 He gave me his phone
 
number,  (
207)  543-6281,  and  said  he  would  be  glad  to  talk more
 
about the project and his views of how Native American groups could
 
be involved in the programming.
 
I asked Guy about the headdress that was on display, which was
 
made from feathers dyed white,  red,  and black,  and had the type of
 
long trailer which I associate with Plains Indians. He said that he
 
realized that  it was  a Plains  or Western  style bonnet,  but they
 
used it because that style was so strongly identified in people's
 
minds  as  an  Indian  bonnet.
 He  mentioned  that  he  had  a more
 
traditional style Micmac bonnet,  made from eagle feathers,  at his
 
home.
 
I also got the name and address of Kenny Cloud  (Micmac name
 
Flying Eagle),  who had done paintings and beadwork which were on
 
display and offered for sale.

Site:  Eagle Lake,  ME
 
This  fieldnote  describes  a conversation  with  Ray  Blair,  an
 
independent logger who lives in Eagle Lake,  ME.
 
I was driving into the town of Eagle Lake from our camp when
 
I saw a man working with heavy machinery on a pile of logs stacked
 
in a clearing just off the road.
 Logging has a long history in the
 
study area, but its importance seems to have diminished in the last
 
several decades,  so I was  interested  in talking with someone who
 
was currently involved in the logging business.
 I parked my truck
 
and went over to introduce myself.
 The man's name was Ray Blair,
 
and he lived in Eagle Lake.
 I would estimate that he was about 40
 
years  old.
 He  did  not  own  the  land  he  was  working,  but  had
 
purchased the right to the timber from the owner.
 He said that he
 
would  then  sell  the  most  of  the  logs  to  lumber  mills;  a small
 
amount of his harvest would be sold to small custom woodworkers.
 
I asked how he got into the logging business,  and he replied that
 
he  had  decided  that  he  wanted  to  work  for  himself,
 having
 
previously spent a few years in Connecticut working a factory job.
 
He was born in St.  Froid,  the next town south of Eagle Lake,  and
 
decided to move back to northern Maine.
 He first opened an auto
 
repair business  in Eagle Lake,  which was successful,  but he said
 
that he ended up having to work too much to keep it going.
 He sold
 
his share to his partner,  and entered the logging business.
 
We talked a bit about the logging business.
 He said  it was
 
hard work,  but that he enjoyed being his own boss and that he made
 
a good  living.
 However,  he  also  indicated that  fewer  and fewer
 
people  in the  study area were able to make a living by  logging.
 
The number of mills had been decreasing steadily,  and many of the
 
ones still operating would no longer saw hardwood or pine,  mostly
 
just spruce.
 We saw a load of logs go by on a truck headed north,
 
and I mentioned that it seemed like a lot of logs went across the
 
border  into  Canada.
 Ray  agreed,  and  said he  hated to  see  that
 
happening,  because Americans ended up buying a large quantity of
 
boards back from Canada that were sawn from American lumber.
 
While  talking  about  the  time  he  spent  in  Connecticut,  Ray
 
expressed the  feeling that,  while many people  from the  St.  John
 
Valley had moved to Connecticut looking for work,  not that many of
 
them were really happy there.
 He said he thought that quite a few
 
people seemed to be trapped working for big companies who didn't
 
really care that much about their workers.
 He saw the unhappiness
 
of those people and decided that he wasn't going to be like them,
 
so he moved back to Maine.
 
[We have talked to quite a few informants who have worked in
 
Connecticut;  this movement began in the 1930s,  and is still quite
 
prevalent in the 1990s.  However, a large number of those who go to
 
Connecticut either move back after a few years,  like Ray,  or move
 
back  when  they  retire.
 My  impression  from  talking  to  other
 
informants is that Ray is quite correct in his analysis that people
 
are unhappy in Connecticut and would rather be back home,  but feel
 
they cannot return due to economic conditions.]

Informant/Event:  Tardif,  Danny; Tardif,  Raoul
 
Coworker:  none
 
Site:  Tardif Mill,  Fort Kent,  ME
 
This fielcinote describes a conversation with Danny Tardif and
 
his father Raoul,  at the sawmill owned by Danny in Fort Kent.
 
I first visited the Tardif mill a few days previous,  but on
 
that occasion the only activity was stacking and loading cord wood.
 
Danny told me that starting the following day they would be sawing
 
a load of logs that one of the local  farmers had brought  in,  and
 
that this would take several days of work to complete.
 I wanted to
 
take  pictures  of  the  sawmill  in  action,  so  I asked  if  I could
 
return  in a day  or two  and photograph while we  talked about the
 
mill.
 Danny replied affirmatively,  so I left with plans to return
 
in a day or two.
 
On this day,  I arrived shortly after 1
:00 p. m.
 Danny wasn't
 
there, but a young man who apparently worked at the mill said that
 
he should be back any time.
 I wandered around for a few minutes,
 
looking at some of the equipment  (but since I had never been in a
 
sawmill before I really didn't know much about what I was seeing),
 
and after a short time Danny did arrive.
 
We  began  by  talking  a bit  about  the  history  of  the  mill.
 
There  is  a series  of  names  and  dates  written  in  concrete  just
 
outside the door to the office,  which reads:
 
Corriveau
 Gagnon
 Tardif
 
1948
 1959
 1961
 
The Tardif inscription refers to Danny's father, Raoul Tardif, who
 
bought the mill  in 1961.
 Danny wasn't sure if Mr.  Corriveau had
 
built the mill in 1948, or if it had been built earlier, but he was
 
sure that his father would know.
 He also mentioned that there had
 
been a book written about the mill by a student at the University
 
of Maine-Fort Kent,  although he couldn't recall either the author
 
or the title.
 
Danny told me that his main business was doing custom sawing
 
for people  (mostly farmers)  who cut down trees on their property
 
and brought in the logs to be sawn.
 According to Danny, his is the
 
only  operation  in the  study area to  offer this  service;  all the
 
other mills saw standard size boards  from lumber which they buy.
 
Moreover,  Danny  also  claimed  that  his  was  one  of  the  few mills
 
which  still  saws  hardwood.
 I asked  about  the  cost,  and  Danny
 
replied that he charges by the 1000 board-feet--$77.00 for spruce,
 
and  $97.00  for  pine  or  hardwood  (for  lumber  brought  in  by  the
 
customer).
 He  also  tries  to  keep  on  hand  a certain  amount  of
 
lumber which he has purchased,  so he can sell boards to those who
 
don't have access to their own.
 
Raoul  Tardif  arrived as we were  talking,  and  told me  a bit
 
more  about  the  history  of  the  mill.
 He  said  that  there  had
 
originally been  a mill  a short distance downstream  (on the  Fish
 
River)  from this mill,  but that it had closed down sometime in the
 
early 20th century.  Joseph Corriveau had built the present mill in
 
1948,  although at that time it was smaller than it was today,  and
 
Alphonse Gagnon had purchased it in 1959.
 In 1961,  Raoul,  having
 
returned to the study area from Connecticut (he was born in 1928 in
 
St. Agatha), bought the mill from Mr. Gagnon.  Raoul says that this
 
was quite a step for him to take, since he had never even worked in
 
a mill before;  Raoul did mention that one of his uncles had owned
 
a mill, and that when he was a boy he spent some time there helping
 
out with odd jobs.
 
As they were preparing to start up the mill,  Raoul showed me
 
around the mill.
 The main saw,  a large circular saw which I would
 
estimate to be about three feet in diameter,  was  run by electric
 
power--Raoul had converted  it from hydro-power.
 The unsawn  logs
 
would enter the mill at one end and be guided onto the saw platform
 
by a man using a TOOL?,  although the  larger logs would sometimes
 
require  two  men  to move  them  into  place.
 Once  on  the platform
 
devices with large pointed teeth,  which Raoul called "dogs," were
 
lowered to hold the log in place.
 Raoul would then begin feeding
 
the log through the saw.
 The first step was to square up the log
 
with multiple passes through the saw,  rotating the log before each
 
pass.
 Once the log was square,  it would be sawn into planks,  the
 
width of which would vary according to the size  of the  log.
 As
 
these planks came off the large circular saw,  Danny Tardif would
 
take them over  to  another,  smaller  saw,  which was  calibrated to
 
enable  him  to  saw  the  planks  into  boards  of  different  widths,
 
according to the customer's specifications.  These boards were then
 
loaded  onto  a truck.
 There was  also  a large  planer  in  another
 
room, but I didn't have a chance to see it in operation.  The scrap
 
wood generated  in the squaring off of the logs was either tossed
 
into a scrap pile or,  if there was time,  sawn into smaller pieces.
 
I am uncertain about the use of this scrap; I believe that some of
 
it was simply discarded, and some may have been sold for kindling.
 
The logs they were sawing on the day I was there were old pine
 
logs,  most  of  which were  from  trees  which had  been  felled  some
 
years  ago,  and  the  object  was  to  salvage  as  much  usable  board-
footage as possible.
 Much of the wood had rotted or been infested
 
with bugs,  so the lumber produced was only suitable for a barn or
 
shed,  according to Danny.
 
Much of the equipment at the mill had been purchased by Raoul
 
from other mills which had ceased operation.  He then restored, and
 
in some cases modified,  this equipment for use in his mill.
 Raoul
 
was very proud,  and deservedly so,  of the way he had been able to
 
enlarge and expand the mill's capacity in this way;  his son Danny
 
obviously had  a lot of  admiration  for  his  father's  ability,  and
 
pointed out how the planer which his  father had purchased  for  a
 
comparatively small  sum  (five hundred dollars  is the figure that
 
sticks  in my mind)  and rebuilt would have cost  fifteen thousand
 
dollars if purchased new.
 When I asked about sharpening the saws,
 
Raoul told me that they had to be sharpened every two hours or so,
 
and Danny showed me the device his father had made for the purpose.
 
Danny  said that  his  father had  fabricated  the  sharpener without
 
benefit of a model,  and that he had done it by "figuring out the
 
right  [correct]  angle and the way it had to work."
 
Danny, now 25 years old (in 1991), purchased the mill from his
 
father in 1989.
 He told me that he had wanted to buy the mill for
 
years,  but didn't have the money.
 Finally,  he decided to move to
 
Connecticut and work for a few years to save up for a down payment;
 
I believe he  said  it took him three years to  save the necessary
 
amount of money.
 I got the  feeling  from Danny that he was very
 
satisfied with his  decision to  buy the mill,  and  judging by the
 
amount of wood stacked outside, there seems to be a market for the
 
custom sawing  service he offers.
 As previously mentioned,  Danny
 
believes that he may be one of the only mills  in the  study area
 
which  offer  custom  sawing,  and  he  expressed  concern  that  area
 
farmers  would  be  unable  to  afford  lumber  if  they  didn't  have
 
someone to saw the logs they could cut on their property.
 
In addition to Raoul and Danny,  three other men were working
 
at the mill on the day of my visited.
 One,  a young man from Fort
 
Kent named John Plourde,  was primarily responsible for moving the
 
logs into position on the platform of the main saw.
 Another,  Ben
 
Michaud of  Clair,  New Brunswick,  helped  clear  the  scraps  as  the
 
logs were squared off, and helped Danny move the planks over to the
 
smaller saw.
 The third, whom I didn't meet, took the boards which
 
Danny sawed from the planks and loaded them onto the truck.
 The
 
crew  seemed  very  accustomed  to working together,  and went  about
 
their jobs with a minimum of fuss or conversation.
 
I took a number of photographs, both black-and-white and color
 
slides.
 After  about  an  hour  of  talking  and  photographing,  I
 
thanked everyone for their time and left.

Site:  Fort Kent to Allagash and return
 
This fieldnote describes a drive to Allagash  from Fort Kent
 
via State Highway 161,  returning via the same route.
 
The town of Allagash lies near the western end of that part of
 
the  Saint  John  River  which  lies  on  the  United  States--Canada
 
border.
 It is some thirty miles west of Fort Kent,  and is almost
 
as  far west as  one can  easily travel  by automobile  in the  Saint
 
John Valley.
 The Allagash River,  much  of which  is  a wilderness
 
waterway,  flows  north  to  meet  the  Saint  John  in  the  town  of
 
Allagash.
 
I had  driven  west  from  Fort  Kent  on  Highway  161  on  one
 
previous  occasion,  but  only  as  far  as  the  eastern  edge  of  St.
 
Francis, where I had stopped at the St. Paul Congregational Church.
 
The fact that there was a nineteenth century Congregational Church
 
on  the  main  road  through  town,  and  that  there  were  names  like
 
Henderson,  MacLean,  and  Connor  on  mailboxes  as  well  as  grave
 
markers caused me to wonder if this marked the western edge of the
 
French Catholic culture area.
 On this trip, as I went further west
 
I realized that,  as several people had since told me,  St.  Francis
 
was  indeed  a predominantly  French  Catholic  town.
 In  fact,  the
 
present St.  Francis Catholic Church,  constructed  in  1980,  may be
 
the newest in the study area.
 However,  it still seems that there
 
is a higher proportion of non-French (in this case largely British)
 
population  in  St.  Francis  than  in the towns  farther east  in  the
 
Saint  John  River  Valley.
 There  are  ethnic  minorities  in  other
 
towns  (e.g.  Lebanese  in  Madawaska),  but  they  do  not  seem  as
 
visible; perhaps this is because St. Francis is a smaller town than
 
most further east,  and their minority is thus more apparent.
 At
 
any  rate,  there  is  a certain  geographical  logic  for  a British
 
presence in St.  Francis, as Allagash, the next town to the west,  is
 
said to be predominantly British (English and Scotch-Irish).  While
 
such proximity does not inevitably lead to penetration by an ethnic
 
minority,  it is more often the case that it does.
 
The  economic  base  of  Allagash  has  long  depended  on  two
 
industries--logging and tourism.  This is apparent in the landscape
 
of Allagash today;
