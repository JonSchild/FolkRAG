MM  0:00   
I always do audio backup, you just never know. So I will start us off. Today is January 5, 2019 for the record. And 
my name is Meredith McGriff, behind the camera. And if you would introduce yourself and maybe just say a few 
words about where we are right now, 
 
MS  0:14   
Sure. My name is Mark Skudlarek. I'm a potter here in Cambridge, Wisconsin, I've been established here since 
1988. And it's a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon, and looking forward to having some questions asked. 
 
MM  0:21   
Thank you. Well, thanks for meeting with me today. I always like to start an interview with just giving someone a 
chance to talk about how you got interested in clay. How did this first get sparked for you? 
 
MS  0:30   
Well, yeah, that's always like a question, I'm kind of curious, you know, too when I meet other potters. So, and I 
think there's a couple of different things that happens that you know, that we sort of stumble into it on. None of 
this is like, pre-planned unless you've been raised by a pottery family, and you're expected to go into it. I initially, 
was really involved with art when I was in high school, and loved painting. And I really thought going into 
college, that that's something that I really wanted to do. And I took a painting class, but it's a question of like, 
having the right instructor in the right time, the right place. And those three things didn't necessarily come 
together for me. And so after that first class, I just noticed, every time I went into the painting studio, that the 
ceramic studio was always full, there was a lot of activity. And there was something that was really visceral about 
it, just the whole aspect of drawing clay that, you know, musty nature, you know, it just, it's kind of like, you 
know, living organisms that are in the air, that type of a thing. And no, there was just something that was really 
kind of magical about that room. And so I decided my freshman year, that'd be the spring semester, to take a 
ceramics course. And I just fell in love with the entire process. I grew up on a farm in central Minnesota, so I'm 
very used to working with my hands, and being physically involved with whatever it is I'm doing. And, and there 
was something was really cerebral about painting, you know, but it was a bit solitary, and also a bit one 
dimensional as far as the whole process was concerned. So getting into the ceramic studio, there was a whole 
thing of like, getting my hands back into the dirt, you know, and mud. And so the process, and it was immediate 
as well, you know, you center and open and then pull up the wall, and all of a sudden, you have a pot there in 
front of you. And it wasn't only just making the pot, but then also the process of you know, applying a glaze. And 
then from there, firing. And, so once I went through that cycle a couple of times, I was immediately hooked on it. 
And so from there on, I took all the classes that were involved. Let's see, I got a work study in the studio, I did 
independent study, but most of my college experience was really kind of entrenched in the ceramic studio. So 
that's how I sort of got started in it. And, yeah, so I'm not sure if you want me to go on with the rest of the story or 
if you have other questions? 
 
MM  1:57   
Well, let's, just to have you elaborate. I know you mentioned this earlier already. But could you talk about what 
college that was? And 
 
MS  2:01   
oh, certainly, yes.  
 
MM  2:01   
who your teacher was. 
 
MS  2:03   
Yeah. Yeah. No, it was a St. John's University in central Minnesota. In Collegeville and, and then my instructor 
was a nun, the we had a, like the boys campus, and then the girls campus. And so the ceramic studio was at 
College of St. Benedict, which is about five miles down the road from St. John's, and the nun who was teaching 
there, her name was Sister Dennis Frandrup. And, and she had taught ceramics there for probably about 20, 25 
years. And that was the other thing too, Dennis and I hit it off, you know, she was one of these... She was petite, 
very small, but you know, a firecracker. And she expected you to work, you know, so I think she's sort of coming 
back from a farming background. and, you know, again, just, you know, dedicating myself to, you know, the 
discipline. She admired that. And so we got along pretty well. And then another, nun that was there on campus 
was really inspirational was Sister Johanna Becker, and she taught Asian art history. And so I took a couple 
classes with her. And that really kind of helped solidify the history of clay, you know, not only what I was doing 
as like, you know, using as an art form, but just really the backbone of what it is that you know, all that flesh got 
attached onto. 
 
MM  4:57   
Great. And you mentioned that Joanna Becker was working in Japan, as well, and how has that influenced your 
work? Or what what kind of things did you learn about that specifically? 
 
MS  5:08   
Well, and you know, it was just, you know, I remember the first class, and she had this little sachet that she pulled 
this little piece of broken pottery out of, and, and then she based her, like started her lecture, but she wanted all of 
us to sort of pick this thing up, touch it, feel it, try to get a grasp as to, you know, what it came from. And so once 
it went throughout the entire room, she said, I want you to understand that this is a shard from the Jomon era in 
Japan, and it was made approximately 12 to 14,000 years ago. And that really blew me away, you know, just the 
history. At that point in time, though, I was actually having contact with another individual, you know, who was 
thoughtful enough to gather clay to shape it and fire it. And so from there, she was doing a lot of work on a book 
called Karatsu Ware [Karatsu Ware: A Tradition of Diversity] and so she was spending a considerable amount of 
time in Japan, and working with the 13th century or 13th generation potter, Takashi was his name. And so 
anyway, she, he had a couple of apprentices, one of the apprentices was a Danish potter who lived in France and I 
was about ready to go on a study abroad program. And so with her help, she introduced me to Steen Kepp and so 
when I went to La Borne, France that's who I initially worked with was Steen and so he basically was, he brought 
like a heavy influence, Japanese influence you know, back from Japan and, and so as far as that influence is 
concerned you know that's what really, I started looking at pots differently, wood fired pots in particular, in that 
particular style of work that he was doing, which was called yakishime. But then, through there, and there was an 
introduction into Shoji Hamada and the Leach tradition. And so that's really how it, you know, that whole aspect 
of my early career kind of flourished. 
 
MM  7:11   
Sure. Um, how long were you in France? 
 
MS  7:14   
About two years altogether. In a small village called La Borne. 
 
MM  7:19   
And you were doing pottery that whole time? 
 
MM  7:22   
Yeah, well, I was in La Borne. Well, thing was that I didn't necessarily have like one individual that I was 
apprenticing with. La Borne had a history of making salt ware, salt glazed stoneware, which, and mostly like 
really large vessels. And that traditions sorta dried up during the Industrial Revolution, certainly going into World 
War II. And so La Borne at that point had proximately 50 potters, and they all fired with wood. And so there was 
just always a lot of work that needed to be done in the way of like, preparing wood, helping mix clay. And I 
certainly got a chance to make pots and fire kilns, but a lot of it was like, you know, really getting a chance to you 
know, fire a lot of wood burning kilns. You know, all of them did, everybody fired with wood. And so that was 
just a great opportunity. And... yeah. 
 
MM  8:12   
That's great. So for reference, what years was that? 
 
MS  8:15   
That would have been in 1981 to '83. 
 
MM  8:21   
And I have a note, and I wanted to go back and ask you about this, you mentioned that painting felt solitary? How 
was ceramics different? In your experience at least. 
 
MS  8:30   
It was, you know, solitary in the sense that like, you know, well, you know, you just basically... you know, as far 
as the process was concerned, it's all one dimensional, the way that you just basically sit in front of a canvas, and 
you work through the entire thing, where, with clay, it's just, it's multi dimensional, there's so many different 
aspects to it. Now getting into the whole thing of like, you know, working together with other individuals, you 
know, that's where I think like, you know, firing the big wood burning kiln, you know, there's just a lot of work 
that goes into preparing the wood and then firing the kiln. And I come from a, an apprenticeship tradition, if you 
will, or an assistantship, I would like to call it more so, as opposed to like, a formal apprenticeship. But working 
in tandem with somebody else. And so I've not always had, you know, apprentices but you know, it's certainly a, 
in the past, I'd say 10 years or so, I've had a constant, you know, a number of you know, I should say, like, 
individuals have worked with me. And so, that's valuable, like, you know, as far as like, you know, the sharing the 
workload, you know, on a daily basis, you know. And then all, you... and then obviously, apprentice lives with 
me, too. So, you know, it's, so it's not that terribly solitary. 
 
MM  8:30   
Sure. Absolutely. You don't see that as much in painting. 
 
MS  9:49   
No. 
 
MM  9:51   
Okay. All right. So after France, what was your next step?  
 
MS  9:55   
Yeah, well, after France I had to come back and pay some student loans. And so that's what brought me back to 
the States. I had a bicycle. And so I went to England, and spent probably about six weeks biking through England 
and visiting with some of the potters there. And namely, there are three potters, it was Richard Batterham, and 
Johnny Leach, and the last was Svend Bayer. And so what ended up happening is, when I was in La Borne, 
France, a very good friend of mine, Eric Astoul was building a new kiln. And I really loved the shape of the kiln. 
And that's how I was introduced to Svend, because he had a kiln that was similar. And he studied with Michael 
Cardew. And after his apprenticeship, went to Southeast Asia, did a tour examining different kilns that were from 
like, you know, again, Thailand, Japan and Korea, and came back and built that kiln. And so it was this beautiful 
teardrop shaped kiln. And so I really liked Svend's pots a lot. I went and visited him and asked him if he took on 
apprentices. And he didn't. So he suggested I look up a good friend of his by the name of Todd Piker, in Cornwall 
Bridge, Connecticut. Todd and Svend worked with Michael Cardew at the same time. And so I took a trip up 
there, I was visiting a friend in New York City and went up to Connecticut. Immediately fell in love with location, 
beautiful facility, and asked if I could, you know, work with him. I didn't get an immediate response back from 
him. So I came back, worked on my brother's farm. Over that summer realized I didn't want to do that for the rest 
of my life. And fortunately, got a call from Todd. And so I went up to Connecticut, and then spent the next four 
years there from '83 to '88, working with him. 
 
MM  11:52   
Were you the only apprentice or assistant that he had at that time? 
 
MS  11:56   
He, yeah, there was a couple of different people that left. When I first interviewed with him, there were three 
people working with him. There was Mark Hewitt, Robert Barron, and then a German potter who was there for a 
short period of time, and I'm not sure, even, if he's making pots anymore. But anyway, so they left. And so when I 
came on, it was just basically Todd and myself working. For me, it was really beneficial, because, obviously, I got 
chance to move a lot of clay, you know, during that time and really become proficient as a turner. So it's just Todd 
and myself. 
 
MM  12:34   
What was the arrangement, as far as, what kind of work or living arrangements? 
 
MS  12:38   
Right, right. Living arrangements. Uh, let's see, he had a substantial order for flower pots, there was a place in 
Litchfield, called White Flower Farm and it was mail-order nursery. And so he made a planter that jasmine was 
sold in. And so, so there was some cash flow. And initially, when I came on, it was just a very small amount of 
money that was you know, afforded to me. Use of his truck, and then was room and board was included. And then 
gradually, as a became, you know, proficient at turning that planter, then there was a piece rate that was given to 
me for the planter. But mostly, it was room and board and the opportunity to get some experience, you know, 
turning clay. And then also, he had a fairly good sized wood burning kiln, it was about 600 cubic feet, that Svend 
actually helped build in 1972. And we fired that kiln, I think, one year 18 times. And so he had two other 
individuals that, you know, did everything from moving the wood, to packing the kiln. And so during the summer 
months we fired that kiln every two weeks, and yeah, it was just, you know, to get into that rhythm, it was really, 
you know, beneficial for me, as far as really getting a good strong foundation under my feet. Because I always 
sort of find that potters that to desire fire with wood, that they have like a firm understanding as to, you know, just 
how much work goes into it. But then also, how temperamental it is as well. You know, the risks are really quite 
high if you don't have proper experience. And so during this four years, I got a chance to fire that kiln dozens of 
times. And then the second year that I was there, there was another partner that came on by name of Hoyt 
Barringer. And so there, then, the three of us were working. And then Hoyt's wife as well, you know, but that was 
toward the end of my tenure there. 
 
MM  12:40   
When you were when you were working in France, did you have much opportunity to make your own work, or? 
 
MS  13:22   
Yeah, there was like... No, mostly it was like, you know, for me, it was firing kilns, I had a couple of 
opportunities to, there was a small kiln that a potter allowed me to make work for and have a small exhibition. 
They had a, basically a gallery space that was on a rotation. So anyway, toward the end of my stay, they asked if I 
wanted to show some pots there. And, you know, the pots weren't all that strong, to be honest with you, I think it 
was just really kind of a kind gesture on their part. And to allow me to sort of sell some pots and, you know, get 
some money back in my pocket. But otherwise, no, mostly, I got a chance to spend a couple of months down in 
Corsica turning some production pottery there to help again, you know with, with my pocketbook. And but mostly 
it was like, you know, my experience in La Borne was purely, you know, geared toward firing kilns. And, and 
then just, you know, it's just a beautiful place, well due to the fact that, you know, again, there were 50 potters 
there, so it was very cosmopolitan. And so for me, coming out of Central Minnesota, and, you know--practically 
Lake Wobegon--that I fell into this you know, little village that had people from all throughout the world. And so 
it was just, you know, it was just a wonderful experience to meet people from, you know, different countries and 
cultures. 
 
MM  16:00   
Sure, yeah, that's amazing. So, your, your own style of pots from the time you were an undergraduate student, to 
the time that you were working with Todd, how did your style develop, in the things that you were making? 
 
MS  16:14   
Well, you know, obviously, it's like, it's almost like learning a new language, you know, so, when I was La Borne, 
you know, I, there were potters that, you know, did inspire me, that I really enjoyed, but I think that I was, in a 
hurry to establish my own voice without having the opportunity to really understand language. And so, um, I 
didn't really have any given style, I, it was like picking and choosing, but then I was really struggling with the 
technical aspect of moving clay. Right, and how to make a good pot. And so that's why I sort of felt an 
apprenticeship was the best route for me. So coming into Todd's shop, Todd came from that whole Leach/Cardew 
tradition, and Hamada to a certain degree, but, you know, a stronger influence of, you know, European, and 
English traditions, and certainly some Southeast Asian, Japanese traditions as well, you know. And so, you know, 
there's also kind of a common language too, as far as shape is concerned. So working at Todd, and then also when 
you repeat those shapes over and over, and over, and over and over again, it really started getting burnt in the back 
of your retina, and, you know, so that's where it like, you know, this commonality of, you know, what makes a 
good pot and a shape. And so, you know, let's say my, my throwing style, you know, is really sort of, you know, 
like an English style of turning, but you know, but those shapes are really, like, you know, they're, again, 
universal, regardless of, you know, the tradition that you might be looking at. So, I'm not in the sense like a true 
studio potter. You know, where I go to a studio look at the, my pottery more as a workshop, you know, but, but 
also, it's like, you know, I get a chance to sort of play there as well.  
 
MM  18:08   
Yeah, that's great. So four years with Todd, and then you came here?  
 
MS  18:14   
Yeah.  
 
MM  18:15   
How did you land on this particular place? 
 
MS  18:17   
Well, it ended up that when I came back from France. Again, working on my brother's farm that summer, I had a 
good friend that I met while turning pots at St. John's, and he married and started his own small studio. But was 
struggling, he had two children, second child was a premature baby. And so financially, it was also during a, you 
know, a recession that was taking place at that point in time in the early '80s. And I took a drive down to 
Minneapolis, to Minnesota Clay, to get some clay with him. And while he was you know, picking up his clay I 
was, just like looking at the bulletin board. And I saw a little recipe card and it, handwritten, was like, you know, 
"potters wanted." Or maybe "needed," but anyway. But it was a real pottery, Cambridge, Wisconsin, it was all 
based on piece rate, but potters were averaging $15 an hour and they got full benefits. And I just, for the life of me 
had a hard time believing it. So I mentioned it to Mark. About a week later, we decided to take a drive. I gave Jim 
Rowe a call. He said come on down. And so we took a drive down here, it was July of '83 and came into 
Cambridge and lo and behold, there was this pottery shop that had 8 production potters and they returning out 
major numbers of pots, all crocks, you know, butter churns, really very typical, this, you know, Early American 
colonial stuff, salt glazed to with cobalt decoration on it. And so I got a call from Todd about that same period, he 
wanted me out in Connecticut. So my good friend, Mark Connelly, took a job here in Cambridge. And so anytime 
I was passing through this area, going back home from Minnesota to visit my family, I'd stop and just notice that, 
you know, the pottery was getting bigger. Another pottery, you know, basically sort of like shot off of that one 
called Rockdale... Union Stoneware. And so between those two potteries they employed close to 200 people in 
town. And shipping pots, you know, throughout the United States, but also globally. And so after four years with 
Todd, and that's when I met my wife at the time. So we ended up deciding to come to Cambridge and setting up a 
shop here. 
 
MM  20:48   
That makes sense. 
 
MS  20:49   
And so it did, you know, because typically, potters would move, traditionally, to an area where there was an 
abundance of clay as well as you know, wood. But it seemed to make sense to, for me at the time, to go 
someplace that already had, like an established, you know, a destination, you know, for clay. And you see little 
pockets like Seagrove, North Carolina, is very, you know, it's similar to that area, but, and it had a potting 
community. There were a lot of potters that were here. And, but nobody was doing anything in the way of like, 
you know, studio pottery or an independent potter. And so when I built my kiln in '88, had my first firing in '89, 
you know, nearly sold everything, came out of my first kiln opening sale. And at that point in time, I thought I had 
probably made the right decision. So it's been 30 years, and it's still, I'm amazed.  
 
MM  21:42   
That's fantastic. It's good to have a place I think, where, where people are familiar with pots, and they understand 
the value of it. 
 
MS  21:51   
Yeah, and the process as well.  
 
MM  21:52   
Yeah.  
 
MS  21:54   
And this is a great location, the sense that, you know, we're only 20 miles away from Madison, you know, an hour 
way from Milwaukee and approximately two hours from Chicago. So, you know, you have major urban centers 
that are nearby, too. 
 
MM  22:07   
Yeah, pull people in. This property, then, was not a pottery when...  
 
MS  22:15   
No, no, this was a, it was funny, that the house was owned by somebody that I had just met when we moved to 
Cambridge. And he and his girlfriend were in the process of finding work out in California, and they needed 
somebody to rent the place. And it was derelict. And uninsulated, with broken windows, and, but the price was 
right. So I rented for a year, and then approached him about the possibility of buying it. And once we bought it, 
then essentially gutted the place and, you know, built from the inside out, and then put an addition on, when was 
that? That would have been in '97. Put an addition on when we had our children. 
 
MM  23:02   
That's great. Did you build the studio, custom?  
 
MS  23:05   
Yes, yeah. And so when I first moved here, coming down on apprenticeship, I really didn't have anything. I had a 
pickup truck, quite literally, the clothes on my back, pots, a couple of crocks in the bed, and moved here. And 
then from there with this, you know, silly dream of like starting a pottery. So I got a job at Rockville Union 
Stoneware. And then things started to fall together and, so, the first shop that I had was on rented property. There 
was a school teacher in town, art teacher who had an apple orchard, and it was on the main artery coming in from 
Madison, Highway 12. And I approached him about the possibility of setting up a pottery there. Again, a derelict 
chicken coop, hillside. And so it took me about a year to fix up the, you know, the building and turn it into a 
pottery and build a kiln. And so I was there, rented that for 10 years, and then when my lease came to its end, 
that's when I negotiated with my neighbor, who's a farmer just on the other side of the wood over there, and I 
actually planted that seed with him about five years prior. Growing up on a farm, I understand how precious land 
is to a farmer, even if it's swamp land. But just to let it ruminate for a while, and so he agreed to sell me on an acre 
of land adjacent to this property. And that's when I was in this, like, three year cycle of pounding nails, and, you 
know, re-establishing everything over here. 
 
MM  23:10   
So you were working, you were working for a pottery, and also building your own studio at the same time, or? 
 
MS  24:52   
I was, no, I was, I put up the workshop. And so as soon as the workshop was up, I got a small gas kiln. And once 
the gas kiln was built, then the old kiln was tore down. And then that following year, that would have been in '99, 
that's when I built the new kiln. And so it was about a three year, you know, phase of like, you know, addition on 
the house workshop, and then the kiln. And then during that time, I was making pots, doing some commission 
work with local potter and then firing them in my kiln. And then also making some my own pots as well. And I 
had inventory that was left over from the old location, you know, so it got that in my showroom, and, you know, 
people coming out here, they still had some pots to purchase, but they also got a chance to see the construction on 
the new kiln. And that's, you know, really kind of, like, encouraged them to come on back. You know, they can, 
they sort of see, you know, something of that nature being built, they want to see the completed you know, 
structure. 
 
MM  25:57   
Sure. A little bit of a teaser there. Gonna check my camera just to make sure we're still good on memory and 
everything... 
 
MM  26:17   
So, working here, and building quite a large kiln. How did you settle on the design of that kiln? Was that similar 
to what you'd use before, or? 
 
MS  26:27   
No, the first kiln that I had was a large tube kiln. And it was kind of a hybrid kiln. The kiln that were built in La 
Borne, France, they're vast. The smallest one probably was about 1000 cubic feet, the largest around 2200 cubic 
feet. So, it's like basically the size of the living room. And, and they had the doorway, on the back side of the kiln. 
And so, and I really liked the idea of being able to walk into a kiln without having to sort of like bend over. You 
know, for potters anyway, there are a couple of different things that you really need to protect, and one of which is 
your back. So anyway, the first kiln was a large, teardrop shaped kiln, with a tube off the back end with the door 
in the back end of the kiln so I could just sort of walk into the kiln and pack from the front near the firebox all the 
way to the back. So I had that for 10 years. And I guess it's called a cave kiln. A Japanese would call it an 
anagama. So when I came here, I wanted to build a multi-chamber kiln, and there was a kiln that I really loved in, 
near La Borne and, it's a little village called Boisbelle and Herve Rousseau is the potter there, and it was a three 
chamber kiln that he had, with a fairly good sized, you know firebox and first chamber, but then two small 
climbing chambers off the back end of it. And so anyway, that's a, and I really liked the idea of having three 
separate chambers that yield different results. And with climbing kilns, they're also very efficient. So that's 
essentially how I came up with that designed, you know, from just for the nature of the variety work that would 
come out of the kiln, 
 
MM  28:10   
Yeah. How long does it take you to fill it? 
 
MS  28:13   
If... on a good clip, two months would be a safe, I've filled it in six weeks. And that's about 1000 cubic feet, and a 
lot of is just you know, if you make big pots, big pots take up a considerable amount of space. And so the first, I'd 
say four or five years that I had the kiln, and with every new kiln, there's always, you know, these different 
dynamics or personalities of the kiln that you need to discover as you're firing them, it's like you need to know 
anybody. And you just need to spend time. And so I fired the, you know, the first four or five years were fired 
about every, or four times every year. And that was good... you know, I definitely got a chance to, you know, 
learn about my kiln. But the problem is, it's a long firing, you know, the new kiln, it's a slower flame pattern, you 
know, and so, and a lot more brick. So my old kiln I'd fire in 36 hours, the new kiln I'd fire in five days. And so, 
we take six hour shifts, but that means I need to pull together a crew. And this is all volunteer help. And people 
are more than willing to help out... until it's the middle of summer when it's 90-95 degrees and high humidity. Or 
in winter, when it's like you know, near zero degrees in the middle of night, and you're just candling the kiln, 
where it's still pretty cold out. So gradually, what I did was I started to cut back and now I only fire twice a year. I 
used to fire three times, I'd fire just the first chamber in the summer. But now in the last, I'd say probably about 
four years, been only firing twice a year, but it still gives me a good yield of pots out of each firing. I don't make 
as many big pots anymore, so I can get a lot of smaller things into it. And then, you know, provides again, a good 
inventory for the showroom. 
 
MM  30:09   
Are your crew, are those other potters, are they friends, are they...? 
 
MS  30:12   
Yeah, friends, you know, like, you know, potters, people inquire. Um, but I really try to like have an apprentice 
right now Brendan Kelley. And so he and I are kind of the anchors of the firing. And then I've been very fortunate 
over the past, oh, nearly 10 years, I have a friend from college, who's now retired. But he, you know, is a bit of a 
pyromaniac and so when he came here the first time and saw the kiln, he'd want to come back and fire it. And so 
he and his wife, they drive their motor home down here and they basically stay for about a week, help fire the kiln 
then help unload. So they've been really instrumental. And then from there, I on the fire department, you know, 
for about five years. And a lot of the guys in the fire department, you know, they're, as far as fire is concerned, 
there's this natural curiosity. They do put fires out, but you know, they understand the dynamic of fire. And so 
anyway, they would help me out. But yeah, there's always like a few people are kind of rotating through, 
especially once they've helped out once or twice, it's an easy kiln to fire, that's the beautiful thing, it's not 
necessarily a labor intensive, you know, job, it's a you know, pretty leisurely, you can very easily, you know, read 
a chapter of a book and between stokes. And so anyway, that's what really helps out. So just kind of nice to sort of 
hang out by the firebox. And, you know, either listen to music, or read and just listen to the fire. 
 
MM  30:51   
How often do you stoke? 
 
MS  31:48   
It depends on you know, the different areas. So, early on, it's just like maybe about every half hour, 45 minutes as 
far as the, you know, preheating in the kiln. Once you get up in your top temperature in the front chamber, it's 
probably about every 10 to 15 minutes. And then once we move into the back chambers, that's where it becomes 
just a bit more you know, the pace picks up a little bit, the wood's smaller, smaller openings, so you have more 
surface area so the word converts it's energy little faster. So there you're stoking probably about every five 
minutes or so. But the back chambers take about six hours each. The first chamber's about four days and then 
back chambers, that's the last day the firing. Typically what I do, start pre-heat it on Tuesday. And then from 
there, start bringing it up to temperature and Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday evening will be a top temperature in 
the firebox, I'll hold top temperature for approximately 24 to 36 hours, maybe a little longer. And then getting into 
early Saturday morning. That's when we transition from the first chamber into the second chamber at around 
three, four o'clock in the morning. And then fire that chamber until approximately noon, 11 o'clock, noon, and 
then the back chamber which is a salt chamber. So the first chambers really kind of concentrated with heavy 
accumulation of ash on the pots and really, you know, try to you know, work with the firebox. The second 
chamber is a glaze chamber. So a lot more glazes in that one. The third chamber is a salt chamber and so salt is 
introduced. So once the the second chamber is complete, then what we do is move into third chamber and then 
typically wrap things up at around six o'clock at night. Let the kiln cool for approximately two to three hours, let it 
breathe. And then from there, you know, shut down the dampers, cap the chimney and climb everything shut. And 
then it's about a five day cycle to, or process of cooling the kiln. So Saturday, you know, Wednesday--that's my 
dog--Wednesday, that's when we crack open the kiln and start unpacking. 
 
MM  34:01   
So do you, do you ever fire other folks' work in the kiln, other than your apprentice? 
 
MS  34:07   
I don't. You know, like from time to time maybe a piece or two but no, I don't rent out space or... And I've 
definitely been approached by a few potters and there's some potters I know that I'm good friends with and, you 
know, there are times maybe my production cycle isn't as long as a wish it would be, but it is a big kiln, like I can 
get other people's pots... Now the risk is that I can fire the people's work, but then, you know, there's just again, 
the dynamics of firing with wood, you know, the pot might not turn out as nice as they would expect it to, and 
just... so I just really try to you know, just for the sake of, of the economics here, I tried to really pack the kiln 
with all my, my pots, my work. 
 
MM  34:51   
I know different people engage with wood firing at different levels,  
 
MS  34:54   
Right 
 
MM  34:56   
But that's your main body of work.  
 
MS  34:57   
Right. 
 
MM  34:58   
Makes sense. Does all your wood come from this property? 
 
MS  35:01   
No, I get it from elsewhere. So like it's a combination of different areas. But when I first set up my shop, I was 
buying slab wood from the western part of the state. Probably about say... 50, 60 miles west of Madison, there's 
an area called, there is one town by the name of Muscoda. And I think they probably had about four or five saw 
mills in that area. And so it was very easy to get ahold of slab wood. It's a, it's really kind of a cutthroat business, 
from what I understand and the profit margin isn't all that great, but a lot saw mills, what they started to do is de-
bark the logs before it went into the saw. And mostly the reason being is that bark has a lot of sand and dirt in it, 
and so it dulls the blade, but then what they can do is they can mulch all that and sell it. And then the other thing 
that they're doing is chipping all the slab wood as well, because as a log goes through the mill, what they do is 
they take it off, they square it up, and then from there make planks or boards out of them. But they started 
chipping. And so it got harder and harder to come across slab wood. And then from there, what I was doing is 
getting a lot of like, you know, pine, pine logs and then cutting and splitting that from different areas, a bit more 
labor intensive. Now what I've done is I found a couple of different mills that again are selling slab wood, they're 
smaller mills. And so I've been burning a lot more slab wood. And then from there, I tried to reach out to different 
tree services in the area. And so if they're doing any type of like you know trimming of trees or downing of trees 
and they need get rid of some of their wood, they drop it off here because I do burn pine and, which is nice. I'd 
like to have combination of hard and soft woods one when I fire the kiln because they again, convert their energy 
a little differently. Slab wood what I’ll do is like it's mostly hardwood and so I get a really nice amber bed out of 
that. However, the pine is really nice toward the end of the firing just due to the fact that you really can, you 
know, grow these really nice long flames. And also since it's converting its energy faster, you get a really nice 
blast of heat. I always like to end on a high note, meaning that at top temperature, absolutely top temperature, so 
it's nice having the pine toward the end. 
 
MM  37:15   
That's great. Are those different, different woods and different things... Is that the kind of thing you were learning 
in France or with Todd? Or is that something specific to your kiln? 
 
MS  37:28   
Yes, all of the above.  
 
MM  37:30   
Okay 
 
MS  37:31   
Um, you know, at Todd, it was all soft wood and also slab so he didn't have a whole lot of, and his fire was just 
incredibly fast. It was like, he just brought everything up to temperature to fire those planters and, and a lot of the 
stuff that he had in the kiln, some minor flashing, but mostly it was like glaze ware and so he just wanted it to be a 
heat-making machine. And, and then from there, like in La Borne, working in La Borne then you get into the, you 
know... I was working with Steen Kepp it was a protracted firing, like a 10-day firing. Right, different style 
altogether. So yeah, I got a chance to sort of like, in La Borne firing lot different kilns and just trying to see what 
kind of results I can get. Um, but um, yeah, with the with the whole thing of wood is just mostly it's experience. 
And also the location that you're, you're at. Moving to Wisconsin, I was burning nothing but you know, 
hardwood, and there's times I really would have liked to have, you know, just a little bit of pine toward the end, 
but, you know, I just, what was coming in on the truck was all hardwood at that point in time. So it's mostly just 
you know, the area that you're located, the circumstances leading into, you know, whatever wood sort of ends up 
at your doorstep, and then from there, you know, working with the best that you possibly can. You know, the key 
obviously, is that it has to be dry. The worst things is having some wood that is just not quite dry enough, has 
surface moisture. You get up near top temperature and just as far as getting over that one little hump, you know, 
there you can just sort of spend hours and hours and hours and you know... 
 
MM  39:11   
Yeah, yeah, challenges. Thinking about other materials, this isn't, as far as I know, an area really known for its 
clay. So where do you get your clay? 
 
MS  39:25   
Well, most of my clays come from down south. So Indiana, Tennessee, Georgia, let's see, Missouri. Those are the 
three major areas. So I came up with, at one point I was really interested in the whole aspect of getting... some 
potters call it wild clay, but raw clay, clay that's you know, directly from the pit. And then from there processing 
it. So about 10 years ago, I got a semi load of clay from Indiana, you know, which had been processed. And then 
once I sort of came to the end of that I started buying bag clay again. And, it's just that processing is like, is one 
more step again, and it takes a bit more time. So just for the convenience, I started going back to bag clay and it's 
a blend of clay that I came up with that suits, you know, my, the workability at the wheel, but then also providing 
me you know, like a product that you know I can sell as a functional pot. So, you know, it's sort of, that recipe is 
pretty much the same recipe I've had now for probably about you know, I'd say 15, 16 years. 
 
MM  40:34   
Do you do all stoneware? 
 
MS  40:35   
All stoneware. Yeah, there's a, what I've been doing is a little bit of porcelain. There's a clay called B-Mix that 
comes from Continental. And it's a porcelaineous body. It's not a true porcelain in that sense. But it does have 
some, I don't know the recipe. But it does some beautiful things in a wood burning kiln and especially in certain 
locations in my kiln as well. So I buy probably about 400 pounds that but then the rest of it, my kiln takes 
approximately three times, about 6000 pounds of clay to fill, and then the rest of it's stoneware. 
 
MM  41:13   
So you have someone else makes that for you? 
 
MS  41:14   
Oh, no, I mix it. Yeah, I mix everything here. Yeah, bring the bags. And then from there. What I do is, it's it's 
called a blunging. But so the beautiful thing about clays is why it's so plastic--and especially aged clay--is water. 
And it's getting 100% saturation of the particles. And so mixing in a dome mixer, you don't necessarily get that 
unless the clay sits and ages or sours, after a period of time. I've been blunging now for probably about 12 or 13 
years. And so blunging is a term used for when you take clay to 100% solution. So I have a 55 gallon drum that 
has what looks like a churn that goes into it, and it's hooked up to a motor. And so I put 30 gallons of water into it 
and approximately 275 pounds 300 pounds actually, sort of bumped it up a little bit, of dry mix into it and then it 
churns for probably about, I don't know an hour or so. But then that process, it's mixing and then you get 100% 
saturation. At that point in time I have a sump pump, that I drop into it. And then that pumps clay into these beds, 
essentially it's a, you know, a rectangular, you know, frame that has what's called hardware cloth. Basically, it's 
like you know that steel mesh that's underneath it, put cloth in the side of that, pump the clay in that and then it air 
dries for approximately three weeks. And during that process then it gets stiff enough where I can then cut it, pull 
it out of those beds, and then pass it through my pug mill. Wrap it in plastic and then store it until, you know for 
my next production cycle. I try to stay one cycle ahead with my clay as well as with wood. Sometimes, certainly 
with wood, sometimes it doesn't necessarily work out that way with clay. But you know most of the clay making 
is then done during the summer months, obviously when I can have it air dry out in the sun.  
 
MM  43:18   
Don't want that to freeze, that'd be... 
 
MS  43:20   
No. 
 
MM  43:20   
... a challenge. So I mean, you've tried different things over the years, obviously and changed your process. What 
kind of resources do you have for learning about or researching new processes that you want to try? 
 
MS  43:35   
Well, you know I have a small gas kiln. You know, the big problem that I have with my kiln is that it's a large 
kiln, I only fire twice a year. And so the amount of information that comes out is you know, really at a snail's 
pace. Now I have a small gas kiln that I can sort of develop or test glazes out there. But they're not necessarily the 
same coming out of the wood burning kiln. So you know, any type of like, as far as experimentation, I have a 
tendency of really trying to keep things simple, and, and not try to go off, you know, on a tangent, because in the 
past had sort of gotten burnt to a certain degree. By finding a glaze, you know developing a glaze, and then I'll test 
it, put it on a few pots. And it's foolhardy and when I, I'll take responsibility here, but then I start putting it on a lot 
of pots and, and then that's when you start to, you know, find all the different characteristics and flaws, in the 
glaze and the process becomes, you know, something that, you know, really, you know I'd say it's a liability, 
economic liability at that point in time. So, yeah, the gas kiln, though, I can definitely see in the future, as I get 
older, yeah, the wood kiln's, probably not going to get fired that often, you know, I'd love to see that, but I just 
understand the reality of it, the gas kiln is considerably smaller. So, approximately about 15 cubic feet, as opposed 
to 1000. And I get the turnarounds really quite quick on that one, or I'd build a larger gas kiln for production, that 
kind of a thing. Or, you know, again, just sort of like scaling down the wood burning kiln. But, yeah, so as far as 
like, you know, research and development, it's really kind of limited to a certain degree. 
 
MM  45:37   
Do you do have a group of like potter friends that you bounce ideas off of, or? 
 
MS  45:44   
Yes, certainly. Or there's like, if there's a problem, then you can sort of bring up because there's just a vast amount 
of experience in this area. You know, there's approximately seven, eight potters within the vicinity. And all of 
them, yeah, been making pots for a long time, we have this thing called Clay Collective and so we do a spring 
pottery tour. But I think they sort of came up with, and I'm trying to recall the like, several, several hundred years 
of experience in clay. And... But anyway, so yeah, if there's ever any issues, cuz I think potters in general, they're 
not necessarily really concerned about secrets, you know, there's no such thing as secrets, because a glaze that I 
developed, or at least use, works in a particular way in my kiln and in another kiln, it can be completely different, 
you know, so. And mostly, then I think it's an issue of not necessarily of places, that kind of a thing, but issues of 
like firing, kiln problems with the kiln not firing properly, raw material that you're using. You know, that's where 
it's really helpful to have these people in the area. 
 
MM  46:56   
When did the Clay Collective form? 
 
MS  47:00   
Let's see, I think was approximately eight years ago, when we started get together. I think this coming year is 
going to be our seventh tour, if I'm not mistaken. And, but we've all been in the area for a long time. There, there 
was like a, this is probably about 20 years ago, has it been now? I'm trying to think is probably around like, you 
know, 30 years, so it's like, early '90s, around 27, 28 years, we put together a guild if you want to call it that, but 
there was a pottery festival in Cambridge. And so there was like probably about a dozen of us that got together, 
and what we did was we fired raku pots, and, and then from there sold it during the pottery festival. And that 
allowed us to bring potters in to do workshops. And so do two workshops during the course of the year. When 
that sort of faded, that's when we, and also a lot of potters moved out of the community as, you know, the 
production pottery started to wind down. So the core of us then decided to, you know, put this tour together. And 
it's based off a tour that we started, or at least friend and I started nearly, you know, 20 years ago. And, and that's 
a fall tour that's called Earth, Wood, and Fire. And... it's a wide range of artists, everything from like painters to 
potters to fiber artists. But we, and that's become very successful. And so that's when we decided that, let's go 
ahead and put another tour together, but it'd be like an all-clay tour during the spring of the year. 
 
MM  48:33   
I was wondering, because I actually discovered Clay Collective first when I was doing the research, I have no idea 
how... and so I was wondering what the relationship between those two. So the Earth, Wood, and Fire has been 
around a lot longer. 
 
MS  48:46   
Yeah, good friend of mine, Bill Bailey, he's out in New York right now, but lived in the area, he was a 
woodworker and had just moved, you know, probably about 10-15 miles from here. And, but he wanted to 
encourage people to come to his place. And so the first year, we did it in early December, and actually fired the 
kiln that weekend, so people could see the kiln being fired. And it was based off my mailing list. And so I got 
some traffic here. But it didn't really sort of like filter its way toward Bill. And Bill is one of these individuals, if 
something doesn't work, he's going to make it work. And so anyway, the following year, he decided he needed to 
expand and sort of started reaching out to different artists in the area. And so he single-handedly sort of developed 
a tour. The first four years it was a black and white brochure, and then the fifth year, that's when we went with a 
color brochure and that's when it really took off. So you know, my firings, they basically sort of like, are 
coordinated with those weekends or at least, you know, for, to gear up for that particular weekend and my kiln 
opening sale. And so those particular weekends, they have a good amount of traffic here and I can move a good 
number of pots.  
 
MM  49:58   
That's great. So do you, do you unload the kiln before the tour?  
 
MS  50:04   
Yeah, it's all done before the tour and well before the tour. I've done like kiln openings, you know, as I said I used 
to fire during the summer that I just fired my first chamber. And it was while the pottery festival was going on. So 
as opposed to packing my stuff up and going down to the park, which is just, it's a lot of work, I decided to 
unpack the kiln so people could come and see pots coming out of the kiln. And that worked out fairly well. But, 
you know, for these tours in the spring, in the fall, now what I do is I try to give myself easily like three weeks, 
just because there's approximately anywhere between 1000 and 2000 pots that come out of the kiln. And so there's 
just a lot of housecleaning that needs to be done. So the kiln, as I said, typically it's unpacked on Wednesday, 
starting Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And then from there, there's been a two-day process of cleaning all the 
kiln furniture, and then about a week long process. of then inspecting all the pots, the sorting and cleaning them, 
you know, if there's any rough edges, sanding them down, grinding down the bottoms, if there's any glaze runs 
that type of a thing. And that usually takes about a good week, maybe week and a half. And then from there 
another I'd say three or four days to restock the showroom. And then I try to get myself like a day or two prior to 
the kiln opening just to, sort of like that weekend, sort of catch my breath and then prepare some food. 
 
MM  51:32   
Yeah, that's a lot of work. 
 
MS  51:33   
Yeah. And it's just... I know that there's some potters in the area, like Rick Lamore, what he has done in the past is 
like fire his kiln during that weekend. He does pit fires, and it's really exciting for individuals to, on the tour, to 
actually sort of see a kiln being fired. But at that point, I'm more interested in getting pots out the door. 
 
MM  51:53   
Absolutely. Well and I would imagine that you'd need quite a lot of help to be firing a kiln at the same time as 
doing sales. 
 
MS  51:59   
Yeah. And then, and then the other thing too, is that a kiln really demands, you know, all of your attention. So if 
you have a lot of people coming by and asking questions, you know, then you're, you know, you're really sort of 
like setting yourself up for, you know, jeopardizing the entire load of pots. And so, you know, when I'm firing the 
kiln, I just really try to focus on that, solely that. And then unpacking the kiln too, I'd like to sort of take my time. 
Because as you're pulling parts out of the kiln, each firing is different. Each area of the kiln, you know, provides, 
you know, more information, you know, how glazes react in that area. So I really try to go slow when I'm 
unpacking the kiln and, you know, get a chance to really sort of digest what's going on?  
 
MM  52:00   
Yeah, absolutely. Do you do like photographs or take notes or, or is it just kind of all in your head? 
 
MS  52:52   
What I do is I try to take some notes, especially you know, with the firing, I chart out the firing, and then from 
there, at the end of it, I take notes. Now, this last firing, I think was the 69th. And so after a period of time, you 
know, you basically get into like a routine or rhythm. And then you know, and I do, you know, I shouldn't be, 
yeah, but I do take a lot of mental notes and try to remember, you know, what took place last time... And most of 
what I remember are the mistakes and just try not to repeat them, more than anything else. 
 
MM  53:23   
Absolutely. So, I mean, obviously, you've got an apprentice now. What's his role in the firing or in the unloading?  
 
MS  53:34   
We've worked side by side, and so we do everything together. So, Brendan has been with me now for about a 
year, he had about five years of experience making pots, he's 21. But you really, came in with a strong foundation. 
So like you know the first, you know, production cycle, I really tell individuals, it's not a question of me needing 
the pots, it's more or less an issue of you moving clay through your hands and just, you know, learning how to 
turn the way that I turn. And, and then from there, as you develop, then you know, that the pots are meeting a 
standard, then we'll basically start to keep them. But, and then from there, it's just you know like that comfort 
level. I try to see where they're at, during, you know, during the production cycle. And then from there, try to 
challenge them as well. Not to the point of actually getting frustrated, but to a point where, you know, they're, you 
know, they're just trying something different really testing their skill level. Typically I ask an individual to stay 
with me for two years. The first year is really kind of like a building a, now just a, a relationship with that 
individual, as well as their, again, the whole aspect of comfort, you know, just starting to allow themselves to sort 
of see shapes the way that I see them. And then, you know, pulling handles that I like to pick, you know, like feel, 
and then the second year... it's just I spent a lot of time in the training process of it. The second year, that's when 
all the sudden the production end of it starts to pick up a bit. And so it sort of weighs out that the time that I've 
taken away from me making pots, my time at the wheel, you know, to, you know, letting them sort of run. That's 
great. 
 
MS  55:31   
How's your chip, or your card doing? 
 
MM  55:33   
I think we're good. But I always like to start a new file every once in a while when I can just to make sure we 
don't lose it. So how many different apprentices or assistants have you had over the years? Do you know? 
 
MS  55:50   
It's always been like, yeah, it varies, because some people have stayed with me for a short period of time, it might 
be like three or four months, you know, and it's not necessarily like, you know, the two year thing, just on 
happenstance, but I'd say I had like seven, seven or eight, over the years. When our children were young I took a 
break. And so I worked by myself for probably about a good, I don't know, eight years or so. And then starting 
six, seven years ago, that's when I started taking people on, so since I started taking people back on again, 
Brendan's, the fourth person that's been here. 
 
MM  56:26   
Do you, it's usually just one person at a time usually? 
 
MS  56:28   
Just one person at a time. Yeah, the workshop is, I have a little cabin that I built here. So that's where he stays. I've 
had couples live with me. But mostly, it's just like, you know, one individual. And then the workshop as well, you 
know, I do a pretty good job of managing my production as it goes through the shop. But one other person, if I 
had three people in there it'd get tight quickly. So I just try to keep it with one individual. And, and then also it's 
just the whole aspect of like, I'm not quite sure, if you start making more pots then, you know, then you spend 
more time marketing the pots or trying to figure out how to sell them as well. You know, so I just really kind of 
like the pace I'm at right now.  
 
MM  56:36   
That's great. Just a quick process question I forgot to ask earlier. Do you bisque before you... 
 
MS  57:19   
I've started, yes, I started to do so. Initially, I didn't. It was mostly all raw glazed work, but I've become more 
interested in glazes and slip glazes are beautiful, you get a really nice interface between you know, because they 
have a lot of clay in them. And so, but they don't necessarily have the same depth, as you know, glazes that lack 
that amount of clay. They're more fluid. And there's just, you know, again, there's a richness with you know, 
glazes that don't have a whole lot of clay, you know, ball clay that is. So anyway, recently I've been, you know 
working more with bisquing and then also, you know, bisquing just alleviates some issues that take place in the 
process of raw glazing, especially when you have an apprentice in the shop. Because you have to, when you're, 
when you're raw glazing anyway, you really need to be vigilant as far as like, you know, the drying of the pots, 
and glazing them just at the right time. So bisquing, what it does is it eliminates a lot of that, but then also opens 
up possibilities of other glazes as well. 
 
MM  58:30   
Sure. As far as the kinds of forms that you make, how, how have you decided which forms to make? And what 
are your favorites? And what kinds of things do you do? 
 
MS  58:38   
Well, you know really, everything is, the springboard of all my work is function. And so, you know, and form 
follows function. And so, and then getting back into the traditional side of it, you know, coming from, because, so 
I worked with Todd Piker, right, he was a Cardew apprentice and Cardew was a Leach apprentice, and then, I 
married Michael Cardew's granddaughter, so there's this whole thing of like, you know, shape, you know, being 
the thing. You know, just a pot that has great shape. So anyway, I make a lot of like, you know, bowls, plates, 
mugs, casseroles, platters, storage jars, and garden ware. But, you know, as far as like, you know, the shapes that I 
make all come from a tradition, you know, and I can sort of pinpoint, but even like, you look at certain shapes and 
different eras throughout, you know, art history, you know, I can find a pot that was made in Jomon, Japan, and 
then I can find another pot that was early woodland pottery here in the United States. And you see the same 
shapes being repeated over and over and over again. So that's really kind of like, you know, what I do, and there's, 
you know, there aren't any new shapes out there, really, when it comes right down to it. You can definitely sort of 
explore sculpture and making pots more sculptural, and, you know, spending more time with each individual pot, 
and there are potters that do do that, but I was just, you know, really a big fan of Warren McKenzie. And so, when 
I was at St. John's going back to St. John's, I sort of struggled with, you know, I love turning pots, but what is it 
that I want to do with this, and, and then Warren came and did a workshop. And there were a couple of different 
things that struck me with his workshop, one of which was the ease in which he made pots, you know, and it was 
just something that just so like naturally happened while he's having a conversation. And, and then you know, he 
espoused function, you know, making pots that were affordable and functional. And so, you know, again, coming 
from a farming background, where you're rather practical, and, you know, what it is the endeavor that you do. 
That seemed to fit with me, you know, and so, getting into shapes, I don't, I try to keep, my pots are pretty quiet 
and pretty subtle. I don't like to wag my tail a whole lot, you know, I don't think that should really be the emphasis 
of a pot, that they should just sort of provide you know, like, a function and, and some beauty and, and then from 
there, just be comfortable in one's hand while you're using it. And so those are the big things. 
 
MM  59:12   
That makes a lot of sense. Are these your pieces here, behind you? 
 
MS  1:01:42   
Oh, lot of these are friends of mine. But otherwise, let's see out of this shelf... I made that one. And I made that 
one at Todd's. And then from there, this was my, my father-in-law, Seth Cardew made that one. Good friend of 
mine, Cary Hulin he's out in Holmes County, Ohio. 
 
 
Audio File #2 (afc2018030_05161_sr02.wav) 
 
MS  0:01   
That pot up there, that's Frederick Carpenter, he was a potter in Charleston. And, and made pots, it was during the 
Colonial era, I think, you know, probably late 1700s, something of that nature. So he just made these beautiful 
shaped bottles. And this one is like, you know, it's a nice pot, it's a really nice pot and, but the shape isn't quite the 
same, but I just like these old pots because you know, when they packed the kiln, they're all these little kiln 
accidents that occur, you know, and so there's like a scar from another pot that sort of fell up against it. This is all 
wood ash that settled on the pot, and with Frederick Carpenter what he loved to do, too is dip the bottoms and the 
tops, and this one you can barely see it in a different clay, clay body. Some of them are a little darker, but you can 
sort of see the line there. You know, it'd be dipped in the bottom, and then also the top. He did mostly like cider 
jugs, oil jugs, that kind of thing. Yes, that's Frederick Carpenter. This one is Mark Hewitt  
 
MM  1:05   
I wondered about that.  
 
MS  1:06   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I just really and again, getting the shapes. And so it's just like, you know, the four lugged 
handles, and, you know, very much inspired by Oriental, you know, shapes, Chinese. So, that's my cookie jar. It 
doesn't have cookies in it anymore. And then I'll sort of like too, like, the whole thing he was really into the glass. 
And mostly what traditional potters down North Carolina would do is, you know, lugs would have a tendency of 
cracking from time to time. And so they'd put a little piece of glass in so the glass actually sort of flowed into the 
cracks... But then also became a nice decoration. So that's his, this is a previous apprentice of mine, Jordan 
Taylor, he was actually named after, there was a clay called Jordan clay. You know, back in the 70s. So he was 
actually named after clay. But this is a pot that came the first chamber my kiln while he was here, but again, just a 
really nice heavy accumulation of wood ash on shino glaze. And then the last one, let's see, that's another Mark 
Hewitt... little casserole dish that doesn't get enough use. Little bean pot. That was out of his second firing down 
in North Carolina, I went down there and helped him out with it. 
 
MM  2:32   
Was your wife a potter? 
 
MS  2:33   
Nope, nope, she was a gardener. Did a little bit of, knitting, but it was, yeah, she now works at a flower shop. 
Otherwise, no, she, you know, she grew up in a family of potters, and I think the last thing she wanted to do was 
become a potter. 
 
MM  2:53   
What about your kids? Are they interested in...?  
 
MS  2:55   
No, nope, when they were younger? Absolutely. You know, and they loved building little kilns, always firing the 
kiln, all of that. But I've never really tried to, you know, I allowed them to sort of pick their own path. But, yeah, I 
think that you know like the whole thing of, you know, becoming a potter and being a professional potter. It does, 
you know, just, you know, there are a lot of challenges, you know, there are a lot of challenges financially, 
physically, you know, and so you really have to be in love with it. You know, it's something that you really want 
to do, you know, and especially fired with wood. And I've seen plenty of potters during the 90s, when this whole 
wood firing it was like, you know, a period where people were really interested in wood fire and a lot of wood 
burning kilns were built on campuses throughout the United States, or potters, you know, built wood burning 
kilns that were probably fired, like, you know, a couple of times, and then from there, discovering that, you know, 
was way too much work. So, you know, to sort of choose this as a profession, it's difficult, you really need to 
have, like, you know, the long view, you know, of what it is that you're doing and want to continue to do it. All I 
can hope for is that I still enjoy doing it. And... you know, hope that I will enjoy doing it for the next 20, 30 years, 
however long I can make. Unfortunately, you know, it's, you know, Warren McKenzie, passed away this last 
Monday, and it's really sad. But, you know, he was making pots up until, you know, nearly his last day, sort of, 
and I was there visiting him probably about two years ago, and it was just amazing how... pots that he was making 
even at 92. 
 
MM  4:37   
That's amazing. That's wonderful. So, you sell your work here, obviously, do you sell your work at galleries or 
shows?  
 
MS  4:47   
Not a whole lot. No, I'm, I've been really fortunate, you know, just to sell things here. I did, when I first started, I 
did art fairs. And the thing is art fairs, there's, they've become expensive. Lot of risk involved with it, you're not 
really quite sure from one, you know, weekend to the next what the weather is going to be like, as well as how 
any particular event is promoted, who's going to show up, you have a lot of competition. So anyway, I really tried 
to encourage people to come out here. That said, Brendan, my apprentice, is interested in going to some art fairs 
this coming summer. So anyway, you know, we'll pack up a trailer for him and, and then from there, as far as like, 
you know, again, to get back to the apprenticeship, you don't make a whole lot of money doing it. But, you know, 
he wants to do art fairs, so if he's happy, and then taking commission, you know, off of the sales, so this way, you 
know, he can, you know, continue to afford to stay here, but. And he's making some fantastic pots, you know, just 
coming here, in the short period of time that he's been here. So anyway, most of everything is sold here, a little bit 
of work, that as far as doing commissions stuff, or restaurants or brewpubs, you know, that type of thing, as long 
as there's like a good line that they want. But I don't do, like any kind of one offs. Some of the galleries, I do 
some, you know, gallery stuff, but not a whole lot, and you know, it's just art fairs and galleries, you're basically 
looking at about a 50% commission on your work... and when all said and done. So if I can encourage people to 
come here, you know, where they can sort of see the shop, where pots are made, see the kiln, and it becomes 
much more of a memorable experience. And so in turn, you know, they tell the story. Yeah, they told their friends. 
And so yeah, most everything's set up in the show room. 
 
MM  5:23   
That's great, it's great to be able to develop that. I feel like a lot of people try to, and can't necessarily find a 
community that will support it.  
 
MS  6:58   
Right? Well, that's where I've been really lucky being in Cambridge, just due to the fact that, you know, again, it 
has this kind of, like, you know, I want to call it tradition, but, you know, certainly people have recognized 
Cambridge as a, you know, a location to, you know, seek out potters or clay. And then also being in an area too, 
as I mentioned earlier, you have Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago, they aren't that far away.  
 
MM  7:26   
Yeah, that's really helpful. So, what's next for you? What's the next few years look like? Do you have plans, 
changes? 
 
MS  7:36   
A five year plan? No, uh, you know, I think that, you know, my, my children are grown up, you know, certainly 
traveling is very, went back to La Borne a couple of times in the last four years, that's been really good. But as far 
as any type of major plans, no. No, pretty much doing the same thing that I've always been doing, you know, I can 
definitely see myself as I mentioned, probably sort of easing back a little bit, you know, from firing with wood, 
but mostly it's like, you know, taking care of myself, just trying to stay physically engaged in my work and, and 
not hurting myself in the process. 
 
MM  8:17   
That's a priority. Well, and it's hard work. A lot of potters deal with health issues.  
 
MS  8:21   
Yeah, I know. And that's one of the things see, I've always sort of thought, whether or not, you know, there's, I'm 
sure there's some articles written about it, but how do you sort of take care of yourself and like, you know, 
because I've noticed, I don't necessarily have arthritis, per se, but you know, eventually that's going to crop up. 
But, you know, just simple things, like, you know, just how do you sort of, you know, manage, this thing that you 
need to rely on. So for me, I, I sort of fell in love with riding bicycle, way, way back. And so, you know, during 
the summer months, I do a lot of bike riding, a little bit swimming, winters becomes a little more difficult 
obviously, but, you know, just as far as just, you know, maintaining one's back. And then also, you know, it's 
fortunate to learn how to throw the way that I did, because both Todd and Svend worked with Michael, who was, 
you know, probably in his 70s at the time, and but he always talked about using your stumps. And so it's all like, 
you know, using your knuckles, your palm and not using your fingertips. So, the way that you sort of hold your 
wrist. Yeah I just noticed that, a couple of issues with my wrist, but otherwise in general, my digits been working 
pretty well for me. So there is, as far as the future is concerned, yeah, just basically sort of doing the same. Unless 
something else happens. 
 
MM  8:58   
Well, that's a that's a good point to hit, I think, where you like what you're doing.  
 
MS  9:44   
Right. 
 
MM  9:45   
Yeah. Thinking about you know, methods of throwing, are there a lot of, do you use a lot of tools, or are you 
mostly just using your hands? 
 
MS  9:53   
I, yeah, I have one major tool. So I throw with a stainless steel rib. So it's a you know, a piece of thin stainless, it's 
probably out now maybe about, you know, three and a half inches by you know, inch and a half, two inches, 
something like that with a fairly large hole in it. But it does a really good job moving clay. So and it's a traditional 
English method. Svend worked in this production pottery, earthenware pottery in England for about a year or two. 
So he developed his skills. And so a lot of that throwing style sort of came from him. And, and that's pretty much 
it, you know, just so the rib, the sponge, a wire. And, and then from there, just you know, like, you know, teaching 
Brendan, that style of turning as far as like, you know there's specifically like, about three different steps, and you 
need sort of follow them, perfecting them. 
 
MM  10:52   
As far as the glaze work that you're doing, how are you applying that? 
 
MS  10:56   
The glazes? Well, again, I'm getting back into bisquing, but there's like there's a, I have about two, three slip 
glazes, you know, which can go on green ware. And so slip glazes are they're, they're defined as glazes that have a 
lot of clay in them, you know, just slip. And so as the pot shrinks, and then also is being fired, the glaze and the 
pot, you know, they basically sort of like, yeah, shrink at the same time. So and then the other glazes are, on 
bisqued pots, like a tenmoku, a shino. Let's see. An oribe glaze and have a let's see, it's an ash glazes, but it's kind 
of like synthetic ash glaze, now truly an ash glaze. But otherwise, those all go on my bisque pots. And then I can 
work in different combinations with those. And so if I'm turning pots, like now that I'm doing a little more 
bisquing, I'll build up a good amount of bisque ware. And then I'll spend like two, maybe three days doing nothing 
but glazing. While you're working with like, you know, if you're slipping pots, then that's where you really need 
to sort of maintain, again, that drying cycle and sort of manage it and getting glazes on at the appropriate time. 
 
MM  12:13   
Do you do you mostly dip your glazes? 
 
MS  12:15   
Yes. That, I don't spray, no everything is like, yeah, poured and dipped. 
 
MM  12:23   
Well, I think, that's covered a lot of ground. 
 
MS  12:25   
Yeah, we did. 
 
MM  12:28   
I mean, is there anything that just strikes you about this profession, that you would want to tell another generation 
that we haven't covered? Any advice that you would want to give, or? 
 
MS  12:39   
Hmm, well, I think the greatest advice is that, you know, anytime you touch clay and you put into a kiln, it now is 
going to be something that's really quite permanent. And it's going to last a long, long time. Going back to my 
mom's, my parents house, when I was first starting out, you know, she had a few pots that I made in college, and 
they're just god awful. So I think the big thing is, you know, trying to get as much experience as you possibly can, 
working, you know, especially finding potters that you, whose work you really admire, and they do take on 
assistants. And if they don't take on assistants, then you basically sort of show up and you stick around, and you 
know, ask to cut their grass, you do whatever possible, you know, to basically sort of like you know, win their 
favor. But get as much experience as you possibly can. There's, you know, the 10,000 hour rule... But, you know, 
I worked the pottery shops for probably about seven years, seven or eight years before I really sort of set out on 
my own, and I still had to learn on my own as well. You still sort of like, um, there's always lessons waiting for 
you around every corner. But I think the big thing is just giving yourself some time, you know, so this way you 
can really, you know, establish your skill set, you know, before you start making pots. And so that's the big thing. 
It's almost like, you know, with music, you know, the thing is that, you know, everybody, we know when things 
aren't tuned properly, or somebody isn't playing an instrument well, it's a little different with clay seems, you 
know, we basically have a little leeway. However, for somebody that does make pots, they know, that you don't 
know. 
 
MS  14:40   
So a lot of this is, I think just time, you know, and as I said, you know, a big thrill for me, it's just like, you know, 
after 30 years and making, you know, 10s of thousands of pots that you know, any given morning, people are 
drinking coffee out of a coffee mug that they may have bought 15, 20 years ago, you know, but it's just and then 
from there, you know, pots that have, they have this kind of generational quality to because, you know, a lot of 
my customers, previous customers are getting older. And, you know, so they're purging right now. You know, 
they're getting rid of stuff. And so on occasion, I'll get like a text from a friend who's like at a secondhand shop or 
something like that picking up one of my pots I probably made like 25, 30 years ago, you know, but, and then 
from there, you know, yeah, they stick around for a long, long time, thousands of years, in fact. So, you know, just 
sort of knowing that, you know, somewhere down the road, somebody's going to be using my pots.  
 
MM  15:37   
Yeah.  
 
MS  15:38   
That's, that's the real beauty of this business.  
 
MM  15:41   
That's pretty fantastic. Thanks for meeting with me today. I'd love to take a look at your studio if we have time. 
 
MS  15:48   
Yeah, great. Thank you.
