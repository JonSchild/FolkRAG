Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go-around. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus).

It was a 
snowy morning in the month of May, 
I 
discovered a 
girl falling off a 
roof; 
She lauded on her nose, and busted all her clothes 
Her foot was bigger than a 
horse's hoof. 
Oh, her name it is Matilda Awful Gaul, 
She was decorated with two black eyes; 
She worked in a 
German brewery shoving froth -
41 
lager beer, 
And in a 
tenement she was muzzling flies. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's lovely, cross-eyed Cinder Ella, 
Just as fat as a 
one dollar umbrella; 
You have won my heart, and stole my watch and chain. 
You have swelled my pocketbook for bottles of wine; 
I 
will meet you in the gutter outside the slaughter house, 
About twenty minutes after half-past nine. 
We met her bottling fog upon the river, 
And received an invitation to have a 
dinner; 
Her breath it was so strong it turned ice into hot water, 
And her nose was red from being a 
terrible ginner. 
She lived seven flights upstairs in an alley, 
We took the cars and soon got to the top; 
She collared all my money and stabbed me in the neck, 
And then was going to shoot me with a 
pop. 
(Chorus). 
Wrttten and sung by FERGUSON ct MACK. 
We are the Bowery Brothers, 
Our feelings they are big; 
We do a 
trapeze song and dance, 
And a 
banjo solo jig. 
Sing horizontal ballads, 
You bet it is a 
fact; 
We do the darling essence, 
And the Pompey-Negro Act. 
Cuottus: 
Our Irish business it's immense, 
My brother he's a 
clown; 
We get thirty dollars for the two, 
You bet we own the town; 
Now don't you try to guy us, 
For we have seven mothers, 
We are Steve and Larry Madden, 
Known as the Bowery Brothers. 
We played in Tiffin, Ohio, 
We used to sing " My Gal;" 
We worked for seven seasons 
Along with Happy (Jul. 
Edwin Booth says we are daisys, 
He offered us twenty dollars joint, 
But we are going to open slaughter houses 
Away down at Hunter's Point, 
Written by BARNEY FERGUSON, and sung only by FERGUSON k 'NUM. 
McGilligan's our name, and we are great, fine 
And great, fine men are we; 
We have a 
heart in us that's as big as a 
house 
Our own business we mind, do you see; 
We have friends all around us on every side, 
We are good for whatever we demand: 
For we are the leaders and make no mistake, 
And the bosses of McGilligans' gang. 
Cnonus: 
Then raise the crowd and shout aloud, 
And let your voices ring; 
We'll have you to know we're not too proud, 
To belong to McGilligans' gang. 
Us McGilligans we opened a 
mighty fine place, 
And a 
mighty fine place we had; 
We gave all the gang the free use of the slate, 
Till it took all our time up to add; 
We soon got disgusted at that sort of work, 
And it's quick up the shutters we banged; 
We allow that no sucker can play us for a 
turk, 
We are the leaders of McGilligans' gang. 
Written and sung by FERGUSON & M ACK, with TONY PASTOR'S 
Immense Company. 
We're the 
the Pudding Brothers, Tom and Jerry, 
We throw somersaults on our gums; 
We get four hundred a 
week of P. T. Parnum, 
For walking on our thumbs; 
We jump over seventeen elephants at once, 
Do a 
flip-flop on a 
pie; 
Walk on our teeth, fall on our ear, 
And dance upon our eye. 
Cnottus: 
Jump on our neck, run on our tongue, 
We do all the breakneck tricks; 
They know us by the name we bear, 
It's I3arnum's Comical Micks. 
We juggle cannon balls weighing a 
thousand pounds, 
If you don't believe us, you are a 
liar; 
Leap eight hundred feet, catch a 
spool of thread, 
Surrounded by brimstone and fire; 
We got forty-two cast-iron medals, 
From the King of China and Mayor of France; 
We made them laugh for seven months, 
Sure we thought they'd bust their pants.

BIG FOOT MARY ANN. 
Written by W M. W ELSH expressly for BARNEY FERGUSON, and 
sung only by him with great success. 
I'm in love with a 
pretty girl, 
She's a 
darling to me sure; 
For style I'll bet she can't be beat, 
Sweet Mary Ann McClure. 
Oh. that's the cognomen of her, 
The one I 
love so dear; 
And as we walk along the street, 
The boys yell out: " She's queer." 
CHORUS: 
She has a 
turn-up nose, - 
And on it is a 
dimple; 
Hump-backed, cross-eyed, with warts upon her hands, 
Bow-legged as she goes, 
Lob- sided, and she's simple, 
Oh, isn't she a 
handsome girl, my Big-foot Mary. Ann. 
I 
took her up to see the show 
Last Wednesday afternoon; 
A young man for to sweep the stage 
Stepped out there with a 
broom; 
A 
little boy cried out, " You supe!" 
" 
Oh, Mike, is it soup?" says she; 
"I'm dead with hunger, now look out, 
And order enough for three." (Chorus). 
I 
took her up the other night, 
To get some oyster stew; 
I 
asked her if she'd have some raw, 
When she ordered twenty-two dozen. 
Three dozen more upon half shell, 
I 
heard her loudly bawl, 
And before we left sure divil the bit 
But she eat up shells and all. ( Chorus).

Bung by ED. HARRIGAN, in his side splitt,ng sketch, -"Raffle for a 
Clock." 
OH! I 
am a 
simple, laboring man, 
I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling. sun 
On the ships that come from sea, 
From broad daylight till late at night 
For a 
poor man's family. 
CHORUS. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye ; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh ! the rich ones gilded carriages 
And horses switt and strong, 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he is wrong; 
Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, &e. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South, 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths; 
The white man's children they must starve, 
Shure we ‘01 not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, Ste, 
WHAT I'D DO. 
Written by PAUL ALLEN, and sung with great success by LESTER SZ 
ALLEN, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, New York. 
Candidates running for office tell, 
The voters they will prove true; 
Now if I 
was ruler of America, 
I'll tell you what I 
would do; 
I'd make Dr. Tanner President, 
To cut down expenses to one meal; 
And Grant would be the Treasurer, 
For you know he'd never steal. 
Put John Kelly for Vice-President, 
He'd make millionaires of the Tammany Ring; 
I'd put Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, 
Making shoes up in Sing Sing; 
I'd put Beecher in some female college, 
And let him practice what he'd preach; 
And Ben Butler inspecting the rotten navy, 
Or counting the breakers at Manhattan Beach. 
I'd put Sammy Tilden in the Custom House, 
The robbers out he'd sweep; 
Garfield Superintendent of the Police, 
He'd hire Chinese to work cheap; 
I'd put Dennis Kearney cleaning the streets, 
Hancock and English would be in their joy; 
I'd make Garfield go back upon the Canal, 
And use Arthur for a 
telegraph boy.

When the Purple Lilacs Blossom. 
Composed and sung by:Wu-m.0km A. HUNTLEY. 
When the purple lilacs blossom, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the robin and the bluebird 
Greet us with a 
sweet refrain? 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
CHORUS. 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling. 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
In the soft, 8,:c 
When in Heaven with the angels, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain ? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

I

And for grammar I

And in the Treasury I 
made a. big dent; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron money. 
When Muldoon is your President.

brown stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent; 
Ill make politicians walk on their hands to save their shoes 
When Muldoon is your President.

I'll build a 
railroad across the sea; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent; 
have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll give every bootblack, &c.

BY THE OLD MILL STREAM. 
Sung by Jon N FIELDING. 
You must know that my Uncle is a 
farmer 
Keeps a 
large farm in the West, 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer 
And many's a 
time I 
carressed 
That girl so fair, with nut brown hair, 
Her equal ne'er was seen; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
Cnonns. 
Down toy the old mill stream, 
There many happy hours I've seen ; 
Strolling day by day, we passed the time away, 
Down by the old mill stream. 
Her father was the owner of a 
dairy, 
Her brother worked the plough, 
And while I 
used to roam with little Mary, 
Her mother would milk the cow; 
But her father said, " We should not wed," 
Which I 
thought rather mean, 
As she could not be my wife, she said " She'end her life 
By drowning. in the old mill stream. 
Down by the old mill, &e. 
Now the old man laughed at his daughter, 
Saying, " I 
don't believe a 
word that you say," 
But when he saw her struggling in the water, 
He exclaimed, " Do save her pray?" 
But it was too late, she had met her fate, 
Oh what a 
terrible scene ! 
The old man cried, as the neighbors tried 
To pull her out of the stream. 
Down by the old mill, ..Vc. 
At last they got her out of the water, 
And some of the neighbors said, 
" 
Oh ! Brown you've been the ruin of your daughter, 
For the girl is really dead !" 
He tore his hair gave way to despair, 
Ran away, never more was seen. 
And now I'm told the dairy is sold, 
That stood by the old mill stream. 
Down by the old mill, &c.

*WEDDING OF BIDDY WGRANE. 
As sung by MILES MORRIS. 
I'LL sing you a 
song if you'll listen awhile, 
Of a 
damsel so pretty, so charming, and witty, 
Who liv'd from the City of Dublin a 
mile, 
On the road to Clondalk, in the Emerald Isle; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tipping the blarney, 
But search near and far and you might search in vain, 
From Donaghadee, to the banks of Killarney, 
And not find the equal of Biddy M'Grane. 
A 
fine hearted genuine son of the soil, 
One Larry Molloy, a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Who knew what it was for his living to toil, 
On a 
neat bit of land of his own at Ball byte; 
And Larry for marriage felt no inclination, 
But love is a 
thing that ye cannot explain, 
And enters your heart without hesitation, 
So Larry was smitten with Biddy M'Grane. 
Now Larry was fond of a 
jig the spaipeen, 
He went to the fair and Biddy was there, 
And strolling up to the pretty Colleen, 
Soon led her out for a 
dance on the green; 
The blink ot her eye was near driving him crazy, 
lie axed her consent but she look'd with disdain, 
But when the bold Larry, he trampled the daisy, 
It melted the heart of Biddy M'Grane. 
The day of the wedding the girls and the boys, 
And friends were invited, and highly delighted, 
The Lannigans, the Brannans, the Burkes, and Molloy; 
Vire all in there glory, with fun and with noise; 
Miss Morgan she came along with Dan Brady, 
In a 
new suit WO, bought from old Petticoat Lane, 
And larry M'Guiness arrived with Miss Grady, 
To dance at the wedding of Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting indeed it was mighty fine, 
There•was bacon and cheese, potatoes and pea, 
And lashings of Potheen, in place of the wine, 
Biddy she look'd like a 
goddess divine; 
Attired as she was in her gorgeous apparel, 
In a 
new yellow kirtle of Muslin de laine, 
Ould Barney the fiddler on top of a 
barrel, 
Struck up " Garryowen" for Biddy M'Grane. 
he feasting concluded the (lancing began, 
The Cairns, and the Gilligans, and the 011owlagans, 
All of them leaped to there feet, to a 
man, 
And jigged it as only Irishman can; 
But when bould Jemmy Howlagan leaped on the table, 
I 
suppose 'twas the whiskey that fired his brain 
And roared " Cead mine Faltaigh" long as he was able, 
Good luck and more power to Biddy M'Grane.

Music by E. A.

Oh, here we are together, now, 
Two Irish Immigrants; 
Roger and Hanorah. 
We can do a 
reel or jig, 
Or an Irish song or dance; 
We are right from Connemara. 
When we first came to this country, 
Why we didn't have a 
cent; 
Leaving father and our mother, 
To please you all is our intent. 
Our feelings you all smother. 
Symphony,—Oh, it's many a 
load of turf we dug 
On dear old Erin's Isle, 
And raised a 
decent family 
In true born Irish style.

Now before we, leave you all, 
We hope that you'll excuse; 
Roger and Hanorali 
And when we do return, 
We hope you won't refuse; 
This pair from Connemara. 
Arrah soon we will take the train, 
To the town of Omaha; 
In the mighty far off West, boys, 
And we will bid a 
sad adieu to Erius Isle agra. 
This pair from Connemara. 
Symphony.—So now before we leave ye all, 
And bid every one adieu; 
We will try a 
little dancing, 
In these old Broganic shoes.

THE DONKEY. 
Virc.rds and Tilusic by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
As sung , 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
He fought for his country, he's bee' through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We roue to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade? 
Only for fifty horse-doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a 
donkey, etrJ•

Round, round with nimble feet, 
Glide we to music sweet, ah ! 
Dancing round, &c. 
DON'T YOU TELL MY FATHER,
23 
Sung by J. L. THAYER. 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with darling }la 
I'd have you all to know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That love, yes, sweet love around u 
i 
sheds its g1c.w: 
Don't you wish you were me ? 
She is a 
little dove, 
The only one, I 
love, 
A 
pretty, coaxing, wheedling little thing; 
If to kiss her I 
try, 
"Oh don't," she's sure to cry, 
But afterwards you're sure to hear her sing--
Onortus. 
You may kiss me and caress me, 
'And I 
won't say no, 
I 
won't say no, 
I 
won't say no; 
You may squeeze me if it please yo', 
And I 
won't say no— 
But don't you tell my father! 
We oftimes go courting in a 
quiet country lane, 
To offend her I'd disdain; 
Her love I 
hope -to gain, 
For I 
love her, yes, I 
love her, and I'll never cause her: pain. 
If she'll be true to me. 
She's the apple of my eye, 
I 
love her like pie, 
I've courted her for many a 
weary day; 
I 
asked her to be mine, 
No longer could I 
pine, 
She looked, and laughed, and then to me did say— 
You may kiss me, & c. 
Her father, that's the old man, is very fond of me ; 
We're soon to married be, 
And then there'll be a 
spree! 
If fortune should but favor her with children for her knee. 
How nice to be a 
Pa! 
Thus happy night and day 
The time will pass away ; 
With the little ones I'll play, while round they cling, 
And thus so blithe and gay, 
We'll bask in love's sweet ray, 
Wheia seated 'round the fire she can sing— 
You may kiss me, Jo.. 
DORKINS' NIGHT, 
Written by BOBBY NEwcomn, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic, Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by JOHN PERRY, Washington St., opposite Uostott 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he Caine on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would atha 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi ! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A hiss 1 
yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
IIe's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very aiow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but.the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home I 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home !" 
Down in a 
Uoal Mine. 
I 
AM a 
jovial collier lad, 
As blithe as blithe can be; 
For let the times be good or bad,. 
They are all the same to me; 
Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways; 
For where tho dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground, 
Wher, a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Iigginj dusky diamonds all the season round, 
.0ow 
In a 
coal mine, underneath the ground. 
How little do the great ones care— 
Who sit at home secure— 
What bidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial collier's lives. 
Down in coal mine, ttc. 
Then cheer up, lads,, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can; 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a an 
However fortune turns about, 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
lot what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals? 
Down in coal mine, i&s. 
My hands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein; 
And, like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say— 
"ris not the collier'q heart that's wrang, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, ac. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait 
And watch for my return; 
Yor death, that levels all alike, 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and. damp may stzika, 
And ding his darts at me.

eora mine. doe.

I'm a 
fellow who's fond of pleasure, 
No matter where I

At my hours of pleasure, 
I 
make myself at home; 
011, give to mc the outside sport, 
On the fields I 
love to tarry; 
The boys around the parks, call me 
Pretty Boston Harry, 
CHORUS: 
Oh ta-ta ta, oh, ta-ta ta, 
Wherever I

I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Boston Harry, oh; 
Oh ta-ta, ta, oh ta-ta, ta, 
Wherever I 
may look ; 
I 
always wear the best costume, 
Of any of the boys of the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Josey that's her name; 
In the summer- time, 
On the lawn we play the croquet game; 
Oh, do I 
not admire it; 
My chance I 
would not miss, 
Before my darling parts with me; 
On her lips I 
imprint a 
kiss. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, & c., 
One evening while out strolling, 
Just for a 
short lark; 
111y pet and I 
went wanderi+ig, 
Around in Central Park; 
While gazing at the fountain, 
We met a 
crazy loon, 
Who asked us to take a 
walk with him, 
To visit a 
babboon. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, &c., &c.

A Cnnundrum I Can Hardly 
Understand. 
higinally sung by W ILL H. M ORTON, America's Comique, at the 
Holiday Street Theatre, Baltimore, Aid. 
This world's a 
mighty riddle, very difficult to solve, 
Is a 
maxim that you'll hear on every side, 
It's agame of cards in fine, although money's lost and won, 
While struggling both with poverty and pride, 
For instance there's the poor man that labors for his 
bread, 
When trials and want assail his every hand, 
Where's the money that's been paid to assist him I'm 
afraid 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
This nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But there's fishes in the sea that ain't been caught, 
And the style that we've been ruled, plainly tells us 
we've been fooled, 
Even Congressmen ain't honest as they aught, 
But still many things that in our memory rings, 
Of men whose lip and purposes were grand, 
Why Boss Tweed died in prison, while his partners they 
went free, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
You have heard it doubtless said that a 
fool is easy led, 
It's a 
saying that is sometimes very true, 
But curious to relate how in these United States 
There's a 
class of men known by most of you, 
I 
mean actors that are bad, there are hundreds to be had, 
Yes, a 
thousand waiting if you should command, 
With the salary managers give, how in heave's name 
they live, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand.

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG. 
Written and sung with immense success at Olympic Theatre, Chicago, 
by FRANK LEWIS. Also the Great Hit in New York. 
This world is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, distinction and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in way behind, and you'll very often find 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
I 
will tell you here to- night, things that pass before my sight 
The mistakes of many folks I'll put in song, 
These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
They say, another good man has gone wrong. 
In days that now are past, there is oty:!, whose name will last, 
As a 
warning strong to hundred', in our land; 
He was once the Tammany boss, and New York feels hi,s 
loss 
A true friend to the honest workingman; 
Though he robbed our city sure, still he helped our starving 
poor, 
And comfort brought to many a 
pitiful throng; 
'Tis of poor Tweed now I 
sing, but remember just one thing 
lie was but another good man that's gone wrong. 
Throughout this glorious land, you will often find a 
man 
Who has fallen and weaved in a 
depth of crime; 
lie possesses manly traits, but is working against fate, 
To a 
life of degradation seems resigned;I  
I 
am not out here to preach, but a 
lesson  would teach, 
A 
motto I 
would give you in my song; 
Do not pass him with a 
frown, lift him up when he is dowA 
lie may have been a 
good man that's gone wrong. 
Our preachers now so meek, they took a 
sudden freak, 
By denouncing an actress of great fame; 
From their pulpits now they preach, and their congrega-
tion teach, 
Sarah Bernhardt is a 
woman of bad name; 
In the town of Montreal, the clergymen there all, 
Denounced her in language loud and strong; 
But if they'd look more to home, they would find among 
their own, 
There is many a 
good old preacher that's gone wrong.

Weep as I

Oh ! go to them, tell them for me

Or do they expect me to come? 
No, no, go and tell them for me,

Oh! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Hall 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Ohl I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We 
will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk.

Now I'm not a

biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly. 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it ! " 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk: 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
The— the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl.

Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling,

And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love,

RIDING ON THE RAILWAY. 
Written by D. A. 
KFLI..v. 
Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
While riding on the railway cars the other dak, 
A very funny incident happened by the way; 
A woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
Got on at a 
way station, convenient to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her vail, 
And turning to me, asked Is tins the Morning Mail? 
I 
told her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When suddenly in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loafer! she says to me, Its very well you knows; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady 60. 
Says I, Madam, what I'm guilty of Fin sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose again in haste, 
And says, Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste ? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for tickling of my legs. 
In the railway etc. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her—she was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
Her great big market basket, and then, how very shocking I 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, as I 
now have shown to you.

" 
Ring down the curtain !" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore. 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
'While tears dinim'd each sorrowing eye; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
" 
It's no use. God bless you! Good-

" 
Ring down the curtain !" - Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high !

" 
Ring down the curtain !" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true •, 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew. 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls:

Of pleasant gay cor.imotion,

Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS— 
Rise it, Reilly! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout: Rise it, Reilly!

They'd scorn to lave the flure,

Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel, 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But l'm proud if I'm shabby genteel. 
A 
time was when swells who met me would say, 
Ah I 
Harry, my boy, come and dine," 
But now when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline.

Though poverty daily looks in at my door ;1

She shall have her own, come what will. 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
If you're poor you're a 
gentleman still 
Though poverty, &C. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting; I 
found 
My strength for the moment, was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
Ile cried out, you beggar, don't meddle with me, 
Or you'll very soon get a 
pill. 
I 
said, lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor I'm a 
gentleman still. 
Though poverty, A" 
Written. by FRANK E. 
NICN isH, expressly' tiir M URPHY and M ACK. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, . 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man _that, stole the country. , 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with'old. age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
'Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Macl‹,. 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent---
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever; 
Came tc New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park. 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The 
an that stole the country

We rub our voices wid bay-rum,

Wid such wild sweetness, that you'd love

THE MODERN TRAMP. 
Written and composed by HARRY WrIALING,vocal Comedian and 
Autnor at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
You chaps that's been toiling and slaving all day, 
For a 
moment or two lend an ear ; 
And gaze on a " Tramp" that's jolly hard up, 
And has not worked for many a 
year ; 
All sorts of games in this world I 
have tried, 
To get rich, you will please understand ; 
I've sold soap for pills, and salve to cure corns, 
And I 
once led a 
temperance band. 
Chorus—Then please not to smile, but list to my tale, 
With sorrow I'll pierce your hearts through ; 
Then assist if you can a 
poor tramp out of work; 
And doesn't want any to do. 
I've beat the big drum outside of a 
show, 
I 
next faiked the thimble and pea; 
But for that I 
got nailed, and got three months in jail, 
And of course that didn't suit me; 
I 
next stole a 
child, which I 
hugged in my arms. 
And for charity knocked at each door; 
And to soften their hearts I'd stick pins in the kid, 
Which made the dear baby to roar. 
Chorus. 
I 
soon found it out that game wouldn't pay, 
For the child could eat more than I 
got; 
So I 
turned it up and resolved on a 
plan, 
And blind beggar I 
tried like a 
shot; 
With a 
poodle and string and a 
card on my breast, 
Round every street I 
would jog; 
But because I'd no license a 
policeman came up, 
And quietly walked off with my dog. 
Chorus. 
It's time to he going, I'm getting quite dry, 
And I 
haven't got price of a 
gill; 
So you that have got any " coin" to spare, 
Please bestow it upon Lazy Bill; 
There's an old woman coming I'll see if she'll give 
To a 
cripple that's bad with the cramp; 
A coin for my lodgings, I 
mean for a 
drink, 
For the workhouse just suits this old tramp. 
Chorus. 
THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
entered acording to act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED EA.. 
MOAN, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at 
Washrmr,ton, D. C. 
Composed and sung by EI:RRICIAN & HART, with immanse success, al 
the Theatre Comique, New York. 
We crave your condescension, 
/yid we'll tell you what we know 
marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was 'Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the hand play'd Garryowen or the 
Connemarro pet, 
With the Rub, dub, dub, we marched in the ;mid— 
To the military step— 
With the grcCe 
the red boys, 
To show where we came front; 
Our guns we'd 
With the right shoulder 1,:dfto 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shoulder'd, .to. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sl:cp; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of Whisky, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march In the Mulligan Guard. 
We shoulder'd.

HENRIETTA BAZZEL, of Newport, Ky. 
THERE'S a 
little white cot that is clearer than life, 
Where I 
haste when the day's toil is o'er, 
Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
Oh! the smile of a 
fond loving wife there 
see, 
And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no treasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own. 
CHORUS. 
I've a dear little home, yes a 
home of my own, 
I've a 
nice little home of my own, 
• 
And no king is more proud as he sits on his throne; 
Than am I 
in my dear little home. 
Oh! when ever I 
roam from this little white cot, 
In the hurry and noise of the day, 
My heart gladly turns to that heaven-
like spot, 
And I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
And I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round my neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisome now, 
Par away from my dear little home. 
I've a 
dear little home, 6.7e-
At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet, 
I 
wander again to the door, 
Where the loving ones over and over repeat, 
Their welcoming to me once more, 
As I 
sit by the fire with the children around, 
I 
think of the many that roam; 
No Dlace for a 
shelter, no bed but the ground, 
/to deaf little home like my own. 
I've a

CAN YOU SO SOON FORGET ME? 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT, EN. Sung with great success by HARRY 
KENNEDY, at the SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS, New I_ ork. 
Music to be had at Mrs. P. 
LIEDER'S Music House, 60 Chatham Street, 
who holds the Copyright. 
Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved inc in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet, 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Summer. 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget me? 
IRISH NIGHTINGALE. 
Written by Edwin Talbot. Music by Dick Devlin. 
Sung by Devlin & Tracy with great success in their great 
specialty acts and sketches. 
I 
heard the Nightingale's voice the woodland's tufts 
among, 
Yet sweeter were the tender notes of Miss Kelly's song, 
So soft into the ear they steal, so soft into the soul, 
The deep'ning pain of love they soothe and sorrow's pang 
control. 
CHORUS— 
Singing merrily, soft and cheerily, 
Me.trily, cheerily, soft and merrily, 
Singing cheerily, merrily, cheerily, 
Through the woodlands all day long. [Repeat. 
I 
look upon the pure brook that murmured through the 
glade, 
And mingled in the melody that my Miss Kelly made. 
Yet purer was the residence of Miss Kelly's heart, 
Above the reach of pride and guile above the reach of art. 
Chorus.

In after years when you recall 
The days of pleasure past, 
And think of joyous hours that all 
have flown away too fast: 
If some forgotten air you hear, 
Bring back past scenes to thee, 
And sadly charms thy list'ning ear, 
Keep one kind thought for Inc. 
In fairer scenes ' midst brighter skies, 
Perchance you still may roam; 
Then your fond heart may warmly prtie, 
The dear old friends at home; 
And mid thy pleasures should a 
sigh 
Unheeded fall from thee; 
While the bright tear-drop seals thine eyt, 
Keep one kind thought for me. 
My Dear Old Home Where Roses Grew, 
Written by Edward Talbot for Fayette Welsh and sung by him 
with great success. 
0! how often when at eve I'm sitting, 
Near the hearthstone, where the hemlock burns, 
Cherish'd forms I 
see before me flitting, 
And in fancy's dream my home returns; 
Mem'ry fond delights to linger ever, 
'Round the scenes that childhood knew, 
0! would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
CHORUS. 
0! would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
Oft my aged father comes before me, 
And my mother mourns her absent son, 
Now their parting blessings hover o'er me, 
As the flowers blossom one by one; 
Nothing from my heart those ties can sever, 
Time bath proved all their affection true. 
O! would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
Chorus. 
May kind angels watch around them, 
Health and plenty, banish care and fear, 
All the joys of happy life surround them, 
Bless'd and honor'd be their dwelling here; 
When the weary toil of life is over, 
And we calmly change the old for the new, 
O! may we meet and find another 
Home, as dear as that where roses grew. 
CIIORUS. 
O! may we meet and find another

RED HAIRED KATY SO CONTRARY. 
Parody on " Sandy-Haired Mary in our Area," as sung by 
HARRIGAN Sz HART. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
I 
board at Mrs. Reilly's, 
I 
have a 
big back room; 
There's a 
little Italian fairy, 
That has me gone to ruin. 
Her name is Katy Brady, 
And every night at eight; 
Sweet sounds of music, 
By our Red-Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she is silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red-Haired Katy so contrary. 
See smiles at every Peeler, 
Traveling on the Street; 
The Ash-man in the morning, 
He has such awful feet. 
The Tarrier keeps the Grocery, 
He swears he will her mate; 
And hugs her, yes, the rascal, 
Contrary Red- Haired Kate. 
I'm her chin,. etc. 
The man who carries banners, 
The old Hibernian Clown; 
He hollers in the alley, 
For Katy to come down. 
It makes me nearly looney, 
To see her start a 
gait; 
To smile upon the Tarrier, 
With the Red-Haired Pate. 
I'm her daisy, etc. 
The Junk-man and the Tailor, 
The Beggar for his Bread; 
The Bummer and the Bruiser, 
Have nearly killed me dead. 
A 
crazy Cabinet-maker, 
Has broken me heart complate; 
He elopes with her next Tuesday, 
My darling Red- Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she's silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red- Haired Katy so contrary.

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth ; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen : 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. 
Chorus. 
Parody on Full Moons. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and. sang with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps. 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or sonic alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
It they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make ' cm sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink. 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police fcr to sleep in the Station House. 
Chorus.

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Door. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
&in—" Never take the Horseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & Hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah. it's then then they chase the landlord from the 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
ome one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the door. 
Cheese It, Jimmie, Cheese It, 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung with great snecws 
Pat Rooney. 
AIR—Bogie Man. 
The boys hanging around the public baths, 
How patiently they wait, 
The policeman tries to keep them quiet, 
And pass them in the gate, 
They push and pull to sneak in twice, 
And get another swim, 
But the copper drops and tells them, 
Young fellow that's too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheese it, Jimmy, cheese it, 
Now lay bones for your chance, 
Don't you see the copper will sneak, 
And slug in the pants. 
Then cheese it, Petey, cheese it, 
I 
tell you he will drop, 
Now go and dry your hair now quick, 
Now sherry here is the cop. 
They put seventeen boys in a 
little room, 
About as big as a 
dry goods box, 
You'll hear them say, my clothes is wet, 
I 
wonder where is rocks, 
They put on their shoes upon the dock, 
Buy a 
bolivar if the've got tin, 
Then dry up their hair and watch the police, 
And work the bath again.

Little Nellie O'Brien. 
Written and composed by G. E. Hanson, with A. J. Fisher. 
Music by John E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack, and sung 
by him with great success. 
I 
came to tell you I 
am in love, 
With a 
girl lives on a 
farm, 
She feeds the pigs, does Irish jigs, 
And possesses a 
lovely charm. 
Her teeth are like the snow so white, 
She is the prettiest girl for miles, 
Her hair it hangs, she wears no bangs, 
And her face is covered with smiles. 
CHORUS. 
For she is the maid that I 
adore, 
I 
am sure I'd call her mine, 
For I 
know that I 
would surely die, 
Without little Nellie O'Brien. 
She is as pure and innocent as a 
lamb, 
Her face I 
can't forget, 
She is her mother's only joy, 
And her father's little pet. 
I've proposed and she has accepted, 
Soon I 
will take her hand, 
The twelfth of May is our weduing day, 
Then we'll join the matrimonial band. 
Chorus.

Charlotte Tempi 
e.—To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures,

nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet's lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ahl the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

Price 30 Cents.

ner, " the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the children."

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IKIMPTY METTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
it is a .Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ord.ev 
has been sent us, called HUMPITY DUILPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled, with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at ,home in the hand-
hug of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
