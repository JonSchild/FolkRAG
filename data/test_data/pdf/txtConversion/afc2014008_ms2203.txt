about STEP IT DOJN Songs
 
Enclosed are the corrected and edited songs -  58 in all.
 
I have made suggestions for a uniform style  f presentation. I thin,
 
that this approach gives a maximum of clarity and a maximum of f1ex -
bility. The line above the staff used for clapping may be dropped off
 
with an etc. as soon as the entire rhythmic pattern has been clearly
 
establ
hed
 
Yay I strongly reco iend that the "talking' songs- those
 
W l tfi O U t  ri.
xej pitches be written on a single line instead 01  pttcne_
 
crosses rather than note-heads. I think this is a little sophistica c.
 
for the layman,., as a matter of fact, I
'm not sure anyone really knows
 
what they indicate.
 
1 have, in all cases, placed the word "original" in front of
 
the key designation at the right side of the top staff. I would suggeit
 
that this be dropped entirely. It is confusing and gives information of
 
interest to no one. Very rarely is the original key, the key of the
 
notated piece and it really doesnt make much difference what key the
 
piece was originally in.
 
I have also suggested that the metronome mark be placed next
 
to the ter:po indication or, lacking a tempo indication, above the time
 
signature.
 
The small circled numbers, when they appear, refer to suggested
 
layout lines.

Dear Miss VrCulloughi
 
You will probably pale at receiving such an enormous wodge of stuff
 
from me along with my very first letter, but 1 thought it safer to
 
send you copies of everything I have that concerns editorial or
 
musical content,
 I do hope most of it is no longer germane and you
 
can just throw it away,
 hy own vision of the end of human life
 
does not include either being choked by smog or drowned by the
 
!
nelt t
hp polar icecapsl I think we'll all be slowly drushed to death
 
under mounting tonnages of paper long before anything else can
 
happen to us.
 
Anyway,  letter 41 suggests two problems (marked in the margin)
 
which I still think might be up for grabs, editorially speaking.
 
rettyman apparently thought the way I had handled them was okay,
 
but your feelings may be different.
 Items #2 and #3 reached me
 
the last week of November from Prettyman along with the edited
 
music manuscript.
 I returned the music on December 4th with a
 
separate note of instructions stapled to each page and the two
 
letters to Prettyman (4 and #5) anq a list of the instructions
 
on each item of the music in case anybody tore off the stapled
 
ones  (#6) & K some revisions in the text of the book made necessary
 
by the changes made in the music ( 7).
 The last letter (#8)
 
concerns some editorial revisions, mostly trivial -
-
 matters of
 
consistent spoiling and the like.
 
I hope you won't mind gritting your teeth and plowing through  4
 
quite thoroughly, because the opinions and positions expressed in
 
that letter are the ones I will follow in redoing the music unless
 
1 hear from you to the contrary.
 You may want to consult with
 
someone about them  points 6 and 7 are perhaps the most knotty.
 
The problems raised are amplified in letter  P
5 which 1 sent separately
 
and privately to Ioctyman because I didn't want to hurt the music
 
editor's feelings.
 Anyway,  if you or anyone you COnS ULt  disagree
 
with any of my positions I hope you will lot me know as soon as
 
possible since I expect to he awfully busy with other nroDects
 
by the end of next month.

 1 find I have an extensive and confusing mass of correspondence
 
about the song copyright problem.
 I will be glad to send you xeroxos
 
if you need them, but it seems to me it might be simpler if you simply
 
wrote or phoned Al Brackmann and asked him to send you a list as he has
 
it now of all the songs to be included and his copyright citations for
 
each.
 (oine are under Bessie Jones' name and some under the _
3
'ea I
sland
 
group name along with my brother's as their informal "agent"  some - -
either standards like "London Bridge" or fragments like "aide Charley
 
Ride" seem to me silly to copyright,)  Mr , brackmann,  in my experience,
 
is a tough and efficient businessman and probably can put his hands on
 
a complete list without anyone's having to plow through all the back-

reached at TRO -

 I notice from my files that Josephine

want to speak to her about it.

properly be my headache rather than yours ; this is a drea

and I hope you say it isn't so, but I will take over if required.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I
've been reflecting on the Pizza Pizza Daddy 0 problem, and though
 
I originally thought, as I told J0 Rogers, that it wasn't right because
 
it wasn't represented properly, I
've s
ince changed my mind a little.
 
What s
eems most important is a) a good title, which the present one
 
really isn't; and b)that the children themselves loved Pizza Pizza
 
so much -
-
 that s
een to indicate to me that perhaps we ought to
 
make some changes in the manuscript itself to accommodate it.  We
 
have time to do that.  How do you think Bessie would feel about that?
 
It seems to me that the book is really for the children, ultimately,
 
and their feelings about it should be taken as seriously as hers are.
 
Anyway, it's been disturbing me, and now that I
'm finally on the
 
other s
ide of the fence, I thought I
'd let you know.
 
I s
ent Jo the music, and I very much hope something good will
 
come out of that.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Fran:
 
Here is the music.
 It is the best I can do,  I
'm afraid.
 
There are a few points I
'd like understood between us and the
 
music printers
 
1)  Flaps. I have no firm opinion on the matter
 
of eighth and sixteenth note flags.
 I have them tied together
 
now and it looks all right to met it looked equally all right
 
to me when they were untied,
 Frankly, I still lean a bit toward
 
the untied school of thought, but either way is ok.
 
2)  Verse alignment (must
,  copy). 
In such songs
 
as "Just From the Kitchen". I followed the poetic structure.
 
(I disagree with music editor #2 on this point, and quite strongly.
 
In some of the other songs, the verse structure is metrically
 
irregular and difficult to follow in the music.  The solutions I
 
came to are tentative.
 I have no objection to rearrangement of
 
the latter category of songs as the book designer or music
 
printer may suggest.
 
3)  Stroes or accent marks. 
I put those over
 
the notes so as not to get them in the way of the words.
 I have
 
seen over and under stress marks in standa rd publications,
 
(Duel
.l Sloan and Pearce puts them over; Macmillands puts them
 
under.)  I have no allegiance to either system and will go with
 
your printer's decision.
 
E  Vocal harmony is indicated in the following
 
songs: Green, Green the Crab Apple Tree; East Coast Line; Old
 
Bill the Rolling Pin and Zudio-O,
 I used two systems here:
 
attaching the small note (harmony part) to the melody note stem
 
in some cases, and writing the harmony notes with the stems
 
going up foxxtka and the melody line with the stems going down.
 
Both systems look clear and clean to me and it does not seem
 
inconsistent to me to use both.
 If anybody strongly prefers one
 
system to the other, I should think the printer could simply
 
make the change as it is set into type.
 
5)  Grace notes. I have checked with several people
 
and they all agree with me that a grace note following the major
 
melodic note is understood by most readers as ind t
hating a brief
 
vocal downward slide or a voice break, which is what I mean it
 
to indicate.
 I think Music editor #1 was hipped on the particu-
lar point;  I assume you they are quite kosher.
 
6)  B ster
ns, 
I changed thor
n all to conform with
 
Music Editor #
 l
's preferences and have been told since they
 
look peculiar.
 I cannot see that it makes a particle of differ.
 
once; point them any way you like.
 
)
 
I am now mostly concerned about the many discrepancies I see
 
between the printed lyrics (
in the book text) and the lyrics
 
as printed under the music,
 Most of them are just punctuation
 
discrepancies, but some are actual words and I don't quite
 
know how to handle the whole mess.
 Do you have a sharp-eyed,
 
even-tempered and slightly compulsive young thing around your
 
office you could sot to straightening this out?  I would send
 
detailed ins tructures but I have the horrid suspicion that I
 
do not have an exact copy of the mass as you have it now. When
 
the original t
nsss was stolen from the editor of that other
 
publishing firm,  I provided them a freshly retyped copy; they
 
were supposed to furnish me in return with a complete xerox
 
but for some reason only the music over arrived.
 Therefore,
 
what I have hero may not be orthographically exactly what you
 
have there.
 
I swear if I had even two days to spare at this point,  I
'd
 
fly east and do it myself.  However, sending corrections for
 
what you may not have wrong seems fruitless.
 I am enclosing
 
the Acknowledgement section completely retyped (
I now have to
 
acknowledge some more people, it's all taken so long) and
 
a new page 61 -
-
 the third page of "Juba" in which the dance
 
instructions and lyrics as 5Uf
lR appear.  Could you please
 
substitute these?
 
Then could you got somebody to go over the whole mess and
 
make the wording and punctuation consistent between the lyrics
 
in the text and the lyrics in the music.  When in doubt, use
 
the music as the standard.
 (Feel free, however, to correct
 
punctuation;  I goal awfully doubtful about it.)  I
'm sorry
 
about this, but I really don't think it should take more than
 
an hour or two of someone's time.
 I am enclosing a sheet
 
of corrections that I noticed; anything else, I hope, will
 
be minor anyway.  And I hope all this is unnecessary and that
 
I made those corrections already in the copy you have.
 But
 
in case I didn't

Bess Hawes

.S.
 If there i
s anything else I could do, please don't hesi-
tate to call, write or send a carrier pigeon.
 I really want
 
to get this as right as possible right now .

the line "Step back, Sally" and put in "And" in "And hero
 
comes another one."
 
DANIEL:  The sign (2) should appear after each line of the
 
text (not in the music) to indicate that each line is
 
repeated twice.

Walk, believer, walk, D niei,  (

Walk,  I toll you, walk, Daniel s

 if we got a little money from the.
 
we could conceivably lower the price on the hard-cover.  The productic
 
expenses are already exhorbitant, and little things like having the mu ic

Dear Bess,
 
Jo told me to expect a call from you when you were in
 
Boston  -
 but maybe you didn't go?  Anyway, I had planned on talking
 
to you about a number of things, which I'll now write down.
 
First:  the book is now scheduled to come out in September
 
which is an absolutely for sure final date, the production department
 
assures me.  If we had not had a number of rush books in the spring, we
 
could have made it earlier, or ifwe had had everything ready for the
 
printer in August we could have made it earlier  -
 anyway, I feel bad
 
about it since none of it was your fault, and you've had to wait so long
 
already.  The only loose end left now is the permissions,which we're clearing
 
now and there seems to be no problem about that.
 
Second:  I'm going to see Bessie herself next Thursday; she's
 
conducting some workshops at Brooklyn College and I'm going to take my
 
little boy to one of them and then have lunch with her afterwards  -
 among
 
other things I want to try and coordinate her performances with the book's
 
publication, talk  about records, etc., and try and get her on Sesame Street.
 
But mainly I want to meet her and hear her and I'm quite excited about
 
that.
 
Third:  I want to begin setting up some promotional ideas  - 
mailing pieces to schools, workshops, recreation programs, etc., and I'd
 
love to have any ideas you may have about where to start; who should receive
 
galleys whose quotes about the book would havethe greatest impact; etc.
 
Anyway, any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.
 
I
'll write and tell you about seeing Bessie.
 
Yours,
 
Ira

Dear Bess,
 
Pete Seeger has written a review of your book Ster It Down
  
for SING OUT! volume 20 number 5 (to appear in August.) Unfortunately,
 
he did not have the publishing date or the price; he did list the
 
publisher as Harper & Row, and I have asked them for a copy. Just
 
to guard against the possibility of mistake on their part, could you
 
supply the above information. Also, Pete mentions a film of the
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers, but has no details: e
.g. title, length, price,
 
from whom it is available, how many games are in it etc. Could you
 
give us information on this also?
 
Thank you for your trouble, and we'll be sure to get you a
 
copy as soon as the magazine comes out on the stands.
 
Yours,
 
Robert Fleder, Editor

Dear Fran:
 
Herewith some pictures.  I do not know which will reporduce best, especially
 
considering the problem of reduction in size, so I am sending several made by
 
several photographers under varying conditions.  My own feelings are that the
 
little ones are okay but a bit school-teachery for my taste; that the big
 
heads are possibly too dark (
?) but were taken by my son in law for whom I have
 
a strong sentimental attachment; and that the one with my hair falling down
 
talking to my two daughters i
s my real f
avorite but might raise problems of
 
masking out the girls or else it would have to be reduced too small to be
 
clear.
 
I do wish you would return them when you are through or have decided one way
 
or the other.  I shall haunt you on this point, since I can no l
onger find the
 
ones I Sent Al Prettyman and I would have liked to have them.  Keeping pictures
 
i
s now somewhat an emotional point for me, since I find we have hardly any
 
recent photos of my husband.
 
I hope total chaos has not been the result of my recent visit; you have no idea
 
how many points in those damnable credits I decided not to raise in order to get
 
the book out and how many questions I am going to have to answer from my col-
leagues.  Whet a mess.
 
Concerning publicity, you might warn that nice young man whose name I don't
 
recall at the moment, that my brother is preparing to send him a mammoth l
ist
 
of big wheels in one scene or another who should be approached.  I am also
 
preparing a list of people who might be useful in one way or another on the
 
west coast, and will send those along next week.
 
It was good to meet you and Susan at l
ast; I
'm sorry you couldn't come to the
 
party.  It was nice of you both to give me so much time.
 
Crdial1y,

0016
 
Dear Mr. Lashnits:
 
n
 
P
 
y
 
According to my present inforuation, Bessie J
ones will be on the west coast from
 
May 2nd approximately to May 21st approximately.  (The ppproxir
nates are due to
 
the fact that bookings are still being arranged.)  She will definitely be in the
 
Los Angeles area from May 1
2 through the 15th, and likely as l
ong as May 21st.
 
If you should want to commit her definitely for television appearances. May 12-15
 
would be the safest o
eta, since she will be appearing at a l
ocal f
olk music
 
coffee house, the Ash Grove, during those evenings.  The owner's name, by the way,
 
is Ed Pearl, and he i
s arranging for her other concerts and this west coast tour
 
in general.  You can get further specifics from him, either by writing him at the
 
Ask Grove, 3162 Melrose Boulevard, Los Angeles, California; or by phone (mornings
 
or evenings the best t
ime): 2l3 653*207O.
 
Now as to the book.  Concerning individual review copies I should suggest the fol-
lowing:
 
1
)  Maya Angeloua  If you can l
ocate her address through Celebrity Service,
 
my colleague, Dr. Councill Taylor, who i
s a long-time friend of Miss Angelou's,
 
has volunteered to write her a personal note urging her to do a review or to send
 
in a quotable statement for publicity purposes; however, he has l
ost track of her
 
during her European stint doing this recent movie and does not have her home
 
address in Berkeley any l
onger.  If you could send it to him, he will write her
 
at once; he can be addressed here at SFVSC (
see l
etter-head).  It might be nice,
 
by the way, if you could send him a copy of the book also, as he has advised me
 
extensively on how to approach the black as well as the general professional press,
 
but maybe that i
s my responsibility rather than yours.  (I can't ask him to write
 
a review, since I
've already thanked him in the book for his editorial opinion.)
 
2
) Professor Gene Bluestein, Department of English
 
Fresno State College
 
Fresno, California
 
Professor Bluestein has offered to place a review in the Massachusetts University
 
Review, an important literary publication.
 
3
) Professor Stephen Henderson, Department of English
 
Howard University
 
Washington, D.C.
 
Professor Henderson has his own outlets for reviews among the various publications
 
put out by Howard University - -
 probably the Journal of Nekro
 Education.
 
4
) Mrs. Geneve Fox
 
Childrens Music Center
 
5373 West Pico Boulevard
 
Los Angeles, California  90019
 
The childrens Music Center is  the single biggest distributor of childrens materials
 
on the west coast, both over-the-counter and to the school system.  Mrs. Fox is a
 
personal friend and knows more about the market to which we are appealing than any
 
other single person.  Along with other information, she has sent me xeroxes of 30-40
 
elementary schools across the country asking for material on black childrens' songs
 
and dances.  If you could make use of these, I will send them to you; they should
 
perhaps receive some sort of publicity release.
 
3
 
2
 
5
)  Lerone Bennett, Senior Editor, Ebony Magazine should be sent a review
 
copy personally.  If you let me know that he has been sent one, I will ask my
 
friend Dr. Taylor to write him a note asking him to give i
t personal attention;
 
they are old friends, and Ebony does get around these days.
 
As to reviews in significant professional journals, I think the following folklore
 
j
ournals should be approached; all have good circulation and publish substantial
 
reviews:
 
JOURNAL OF AMERICAN FOLKLORE

Provo, Utah  846°l
 
U
I am president of the California Folklore Society, which puts out Western Folklore,
 
o they'd better give us a good review!)
 
thnomusicologtata and anthropologists can be covered probably by the following:

SOCIETY 
John Leo, Book Review Editor
 
203 West Houston Street
 
New York, N.Y.  10014
 
SOCIETY does not publish a great many reviews, so it might be well to enquire if they
 
are interested before sending a copy; an advertisement might be even more effective,
 
and I have seen Harper & Rowe ads in SOCIETY recently.
 
e black press which prints significant reviews (
in addition to Ebony) includes:

Dear Fran:
 
Thank you for a r
ranging to have the books cent to me so promptly

'?).  In either event, please
 
i
'

 I will be 5e11i1

It is pleasant to have something so personal to give '

five days or so for a stay of a week.
 he seems to me in cur-

crisinc form; I did not get an opportunity -
 it was a flyin;;
 
visit -
 to be sure she had seen a doctor, but she moved easily
 
and her voice was strong.  Joim had developed a strep throit;
 
otherwise the a
-roup seems in good shape.  I hope they are, for
 
they have embarked on a strenuous tour, I
'm afraid.
 
One thing more I need to know from you or Susan or perhaps the
 
publicity gentleman (who has still not told me what if anything
 
he did  itii the mammoth 1i t of suggestions I sent him a month
 
or so ago).  I
'd like to see copies of any reviews recei ed.
 
:
ho looks out for those -
 you, me or somebody partic u
lar?
 -
'

,m
 
I automatically sent copies of any you see, or do I have to
 
request this or what?  I
'm sure this is routinely taken care of
 
in some way or other; I just want to I
aiow how.
.
 
I still can't bring myself to look at the book except over some-
one else's shoulder for a quick glance, so I can neither congratu-
late you nor groan.  I suppose, should there be s second edition
 
at some future point, I wouL  be notified in time to steel myself
 
to go through and make corrections?  I  i
ess it's in some compli-
cated way mixed up with my husband '
s  e.th -
-
 and at the moment
 
I don't think I want to 1iO W  just how -
 but for now it's about
 
all I can do to pick one up and hand it to somebody.

Dear Fran:
 
Thanks for your nice letter and the ad enclosures.  I
'm enclosing, in
 
my turn, a request from Sing Out magazine for permission to include
 
a reprint of a game from Step It Down plus a recorded sample of the tune
 
on the "soun t
hheet'1 (a paper record which they include with each issue
 
and which normally contains only one verse of each song printed).  It
 
seems to me this would amount to some excellent free advertising for
 
the book; I
've written Mr. Norman my own personal approval and suggested'
 
he get in touch with you about permission from Harper and Row.  Jo expect
 
a call.
 
I
've also received some nice letters from personal friends -
 a real rave
 
from klan Dundes, a professor of folklore and anthropology at Berkeley,
 
plus a copy of a review Professor Joan Rayfield wrote for the International
 
Journal of Sociology and Anthropology, which is published at York Univer-
sity, Toronoto, Cnvda, where she teaches.  She says "It may, like the
 
book, take forever to appear, the Journal being as far behind as most,
 
but I did ty best."  Would you like me to send you copies of such items
 
as they come into me?  They might contain usable quotations, though I
 
would want to be sure that you wrote and asked permission to use them.
 
Or am I supposed to do such chores?  Please advise me as to the proper
 
protocol.  It's a trifle embarrassing, especially in the case of personal
 
notes, ouch as the Dundes one, but I suppose one's finer instincts go
 
by the board when confronted by the possibility of cash sales.
 
I think you're quite right about the problem of the book store sales,
 
and w
ill start urgingipeople to go and ask for the book in available
 
book stores.  It is rather steep in price for the average fan, after all;
 
I think that's why they're trying to get it from us wholesale.  I
'm
 
hoping some of my more well-off academic contacts will come thvough;
 
I
've distributed some thirty odd copies myself where they will do the
 
most good, and sold n1most all the rest of those I ordered.
 
I
'll be at the above address for the next while, teaching at Portland
 
State University, and then go to the beach for three weeks of nothing-
in-particular-I-hope.  If you need to get in touch with me after August
 
4th, when I leave my current address and before September 15th, when
 
I start back in teaching at San Fernando Valley State, just write or
 
phone person-to-person at the old Santa Monica address; I have friends
 
staying in the house who will forward mail and who are keeping in close
 
touch with my peregrinations.  I
'm glad you had yourself a trip, and
 
hope your office has settled down a bit.  In odd moments I
'm working on
 
a new manuscript for you; I guess I
'm a glutton for punishment.
 
Best regards,

Dear Bess:
 
I
've just r
eturned t
o the office after what s
eem t
o be
 
endless trips away -
-
 to the West Coast, New Mexico,
 
upstate New York, Washington, Vermont (a week there, s
ince
 
my daughter managed to have a tombstone l
and on her and
 
got a skull fracture), not to mention Europe in May.
 
Anyway, I feel as though I
've hardly been here, and in
 
fact I haven't.  But on my desk this morning was an
 
ad I thought you might l
ike to know about.  Everything
 
we hear about the book so far is good; Bessie has been
 
s
elling 1
0t8 of copies wherever she goes, and she seems
 
t
o have been very a
ctive this summer despite her
 
injuries.
 
I can't remember if I told you t
hat we went down for
 
the Smithsonian festival -
-
 it was off and on, and by
 
the time we got the definite yes, it was too late for
 
the books; they got there several days later.  But it
 
was great to see her, and especially t
o see her looking
 
so well. We've tried several t
imes to get TV things
 
l
ined up when she's passing through, but she inevitably
 
changes plans (that's show business, I guess) and now
 
Tom Lashnits, who's really been pursuing people on
 
this matter, is getting cautious about even calling
 
unless there's pretty strong evidence that she'll
 
really turn up.
 
I hope everything's going well with you, and t
hat
 
you're getting lots of good comments about the book.
 
Yours,
 
Fran McCullough

p
iece but not, of course, with the happy birthday; I guess it all depends
 
on what else I can put in.  In the meantime, could you have some kind pc -  
on at your office return the pieces to me?  I
'll be able to Tet do;:  t
 
some real work on them within the next two weeks, I hope.
 
And speaking of returning things, before they get lost in t
iio
 ao.
 
U4 '
about letting me have the pictures I sent back?  Or are you going to
 
redo the dust cover and include one?  Since I sent Al Prettyman one batch
 
ad you another, photos of me are getting rather slim around our }
10use,
 
my various children are complaining.
 
I hope your waterfall continues to splash and all yoar n

 I
 
you got the message; the secretary said you wouldn't
 
be there for "months."  Anyway, I liked the pieces \

much -

 both a little scholarly, as you well know.  "  
they also have an informal voice that's very good.
 
The only problem I can see is the one we talked abc''
 
earlier -
-
 making it seem like a "real" book, and nt
 
just a bunch of essays from the files.  One thing 0
—
 
would help would be to include a lot of raw material 
- 
Slewfoot Sue was terrific -
-
 so that people could u'
 
it as a sort of source book (
 in the way they do
 
STEP IT DOWN).  Two themes you seem to have to start "l'h
 
are the basic folklore of childhood idea and also tb
 
detective story approach (did you ever see a great
 
book we published called THE HISTORIAN AS DETECTIVE?
 If
 
not, I'll send it).  Thrt seems 1

If you can follo'

Dear Fran:
 
November 24, 1974
 
I thought the enclosed might prove of some interest to you or someone in
 
the publicity department.  These catalogues are prepared in editions of
 
10,000 and mailed all over the country as well as distributed in the local
 
store -
-
 Childrens Music Center, Los Angeles.  A new catalogue of one type
 
or another comes out every year or so; in other words, all material isked
 
is kept up-dated, and the l
ists are made U
I)  strictly on the basis of educa-
tional value, as judged by Geneve Fox who runs the whole show.
 It's rather
 
a feather in one's ca phcreabouts to make it past Geneve's strict scrutiny,
 
and as you will notice, Step It Down
, got mentioned in three this year -
-
Best Records and Books for Elementary Years, Best Records and Books for
 
Early Childhood and Best Records and Books for Exceptional Children.
 I under-
stand it's also l
isted in the catalogue of books on Africa and Afro-America
 
but haven't seen a copy.
 
I thought someone in your firm might l
ike to know about the existence of this
 
highly unusual operation.  Till sometime in January, best regards,

Dear Fran:
 
Just ta quick note for you to send on to your paper-back edition
 
authority.  I have f
inally gotten a bit of positive evidence
 
that S
tep I
t Down i
s indeed being used in educational c
ircles.
 
The f
irst comes from Varbara
, Kirschenblatt-Gimblett, a professor
 
in the Folklore Department at the University of Pennsylvania;
 
S
.I.D. i
s one of f
ive books required for her course in Childrens
 
Folklore.
 
J
 
Just after I had heard about this I received a telephone call from
 
a woman who i
s active in the Orff Schulwerk movement in the United
 
S
tates.  Orff Schuiwerk i
s a method of teaching music developed by
 
the German composer, Carl Orff and widely used both in Europe and in
 
the United S
tates.  This lady called specifically to f
ind out if
 
Step I
t Down were available in paperback as she l
ikes to use i
t in her
 
teacher training courses but f
inds i
t too expensive to require s
tudents
 
to buy.  She i
s planning to ask Bessie to appear at the 1
975 Orff national
 
meetings in Chicago in 1
975, and has invited me to appear at the 1
976
 
meetings to be held in L
os Angeles.
 
These are probably only s
traws in the wind, but I do s
incerely feel
 
that if S
tep I
t Down were available at less cost i
t might well be used
 
in black educational systems which i
s where i
t belongs to be.  My
 
friend, Dr. J
.D. E
lder of the University of Trinidad recently phoned
 
me a
sking f
or ten copies and complaining about the price.
 
Anyway, please pass this a
long where i
t will do the most good.  By the
 
way, I
'm moving f
or the next year to Washington D
.C. to work for the
 
Smithsonian on their g
igantic Festival of American Folk L
ife Peogram
 
f
or 1
976.  Should you need to reach me, I
'll be at the Division of
 
Performing Arts, Smithsonian Institute until September of 1
976.  Since
 
[
'11 be s
o c
lose to New York, I
'll prbbably be in your town from t
ime
 
to t
ime; I
'll r
ing you up one of these days and we'll have lunch.
 
Till then,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
