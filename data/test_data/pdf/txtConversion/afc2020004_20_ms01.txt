Daybreak 
 
 
 
 
abíní hoolzish  
:  
the low-moon horizon turquoise serenes pink-lit 
from the pulp and fray of whorled milkweed  
summer cypress turkey-feathered struts stark pebbled  
through the sheep corral and shade house  
beneath the horse trough star thistle and nine-awned grass 
reflect night storms and rainbow through the morning 
the sun’s rays darling through narrow shoots of cloud, vapor,  
or maybe morning fog  
 
hók’ą́ą́dóó 
 :  
above a passing plane or marsh hawk or maybe a crow 
 
casts its wing on the sweet yellow clover and field weed  
 
on the rubble of rust tin can and car axle and wheel barrow 
 
a basketball backboard crafted from sheet metal and piping 
 
the ground crickets beneath moths telling a story as butterflies  
they flail and flare through two-needle piñon and ryegrass 
 
cottontails squirrel into the culvert under the main road 
 
now wash-like, parched, its flow sands really memory for water 
 
i’íí’ą́ k’ad 
 :  
salsify and velvetweed overtop a broken fence  
its twine, slat, and barbed wire cloaked by dusked sod 
dirt road mud walls, tumbleweed, and maybe sunflowers 
bow-pulled arc by the metal windmill watering faint wind 
the mill echoes awake with each rock thrown 
at its face, back, or the bend of its opened arms  
bįįh níléíjí da’ayą́—clouds drop their shoulders into rain, 
into the coral evening, into the evening’s evening
