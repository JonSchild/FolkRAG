THE FOX
There was an old fox Lived under the rocks His cave was lonely and dark.
One night he come out And prowled habout As hungry as a shark.
He thought he would creep Vhere the fowls were asleep In a barn so snug and warm.
Said he, I must eat And chickens are sweet There's a-plenty on this farm.
He looked all around And heard not a sound And slowly, steadily crept.
Old Tallow the dog Lay like a log And the good old farmer slept.

They all were asleep In the stillness so deep But one old turkey chap.
Who nodded and winked And yawned as he blinked But could not catch a nap.
(And now as he winked And nodded and blinked

He fancied he saw A fox's paw, just underneath his nose; He gave a good spring Did the
fearless old thing As he screamed and doubled out. Then all the fowls Said, Dear me,
Whatever the gobler dreamed about.
It wasn't a dream; With cackle and scream The hens flew round him in fear. I'm in a bad
box, Said Mr. Fox, If the farmer finds me here.)

As he nodded and winked And yawned as he blinked He almost sank in a doze.
He fancied he saw A fox's paw Right underneath his nose.
He quickly spring then On a fine fat hen And thought it was time to run.
When Tallow made now A terrible row And the farmer brought his gun.
The chase they all gave But safe in his care He jumped as he reached the brow.
And Tallow flew around And scratched at the ground And growled his bow-wow, wow.
Here lay the fox In his cave in the rocks So faint and moaned with pain.
'E there made a vow That after that row He'd never steal again.
