The other ni g

I got tangled up on the old doox at, feel flat as  I could be.
 
I had me a little old bottle of rum and I didn't hare any more,
 
'
he cap flew off when I went down and I spilled it on the floor.
 
A rat came out of his hiding place and he smelled that *

He ran ran up and he got a little shot and back to his hole he we
 
Refrain: Back to his hole he went, back to his hole he went
 
He ran right up and he got a little shot and back t

The rat came out of his hiding place, sidled up t
o the rum on the flo
 
l
ie was a little bit shy, but he winked one eye and he got him a littl
 
bit more.
 
He didn't go  back to his hole that time, but he stayed by the puddle
 
of gin,
 
He said, Doggone my popeyed soul, I'm gonna get drunk again.
 
He washed his face with his front paws and on his hind legs eat,
 
hith a twisted smile and a h&lf-closed eye, said, where's that dog-
gone cat.
 
And he didn't go back t
o his hole, he said doggone my soul
 
I'm only a rat but a doggone cat can't run me back to my hole.
 
His little old eyes begin t
o shine as he lapped up more and more
 
And it made me glad that I had stumbled and spilled it on the floor
 
But then the puddle of rum was gone nd I didn't have nay more gin,
 
Th  little old rat was a-haging a time when the old tor
n cat came in.
 
Well the cat made a pass and the rat made a dash, his boldness faded
 
thin
 
The cat jumped over and the rat got sober, ran back to his hole again
 
Ran back to his hole again, ran back to his hole again,

Early in the morning in the chilly light of dawn
 
YT alarm c
lock wakes me up, and I put my work clothes on
 
E7
 A
 
And I go strolling through the orchard down to the cutting shed
 
And you c
an bet your doggone life that I
'd rather be in bed, a
sleep
 
E7

I
Td 
 
Y7 worries would be over thenj I
'd never have to work again.
 
The men with pails and ladders go quickly through the trees
 
Their voices singing as they work float along the summer breeze
 
But then the sun keeps getting hotter, the morning's work is slowed,
 
Just when we think wet.11 t
ake a rest, they bring in a
iother load, they do 2 
They bring i
nother load.
 
If every apricot I see would turn into a dime for me
 
The smell of fruit a
-drying draws bumblebees and flies
 
The sulphur fumes may kill the germs .,
 but they darn near blind our eyes
 
But not sD we c
an 1t see the foreman as he goes passing through
 
We holler, Foreman, punch our cards and that's all we want from you, oh yes.
 
That's a
ll we want from you,
 
The noontime whistle t
ells us itts time to stop and eat
 
We rest beneath a shady tree s gee, it's good to rest our feet
 
And munch on beans a
id cold tortillas and sometimes bread and cheese
 
And if wetre hungry for dessert., we Just pick it off the trees .,
 big treat .,
 
We pick it off the trees.

George Chester's office air conditioner would no longer go
 
C
 F
 C
 
As pools of sweat rou sed off his brow, he had one reverie
 
G7
 
He saw himself with his wife and kids in his cottage by the sea
 
He paid for his car in the parking lot, which gave the poor man chills
 
The attendant laughed and walked away, thumbing a roll of bills,
 
He started the engine with trembling hands at the end of a long hard day
 
And placing himself in the hands of God he drove to the long freeway.
 
The traffic stretched far as the eye could see as bumper to bumper they sped
 
They drove at supernatural speeds which filled his heart with dread.
 
Sometimes they stopped for an hour or more & a thousand horns would blow
 
George Chester's eyes rolled back in his head & his poor mind started to go.
 
He came at last to the turnpike gate and he laid his money down
 
He took the first turn to the right and he followed the curve around.
 
He took each turn of the cloverleaf, he followed every sign,
 
And when he came back to the same tollgate, he gave them another dime.
 
His hands drew tight on the steering wheel, his lips and throat were dry,
 
He swore by all that he held dear he'd make it through or die,
 
He took the first turn to the right, the cloverleaf to go through.
 
He was quite sure of his success till the tollgate hove in view.
 
And now they say when the moon is full and the cloverleaf is still
 
The sound of the engine can be heard laboring up the hill.
 
A dime drops in the toll machine in the cool of a ss summer's night
 
And eternally that poor car takes the first turn to the right.

D J' T OU'AND YEARS AGO
 
I was born a hundred thousand years ago
 
There's nothing in the history I don't know
 
I saw Peter, Paul, and Moses
 
Playing ring around the roses
 
And Ill shoot the guy that say's it irit so
 
I saw Caeser when he crossed the Rubicon
 
It's a fact I built the raft he crossed it on
 
I saw Hannibal at home
 
And Nero burning Rome
 
I even saw the bull of Babylon
 
I saw Eve and Adam driven from the door
 
I
'm the guy that picked the fig leafs that they wore
 
When the apple they were eating
 
I was around the corner peeking
 
I can prove that I'm the guy that ata the core
 
I saw Washington afloot a cake of ice
 
I saw Grant and Billy Sherman shakin' dice
 
I saw Roosevelts big laugh
 
That split his face in Half
 
And Pershing set the trap for Gerr
ian mice
 
I saw Absolorn a hangin' by the hair
 
When they built the Wall of China I was there
 
I saved King Solomons life
 
And he offered me a wife
 
I said "now you're talkin' business; have a chair"
 
The Queen of Sheba fell in love with me
 
We were married in Milwaukle secretly
 
In Washington I shooker
 
Just to join with General Hooker
 
Chasing '
skeeters out of lazy Tennesee
 
I was present at the battle of the Nile
 
Were the bullets flying there, well I shotld smile
 
I saw David with his sling
 
Put Goliath on the wing
 
He was doing +O seconds to the mile
 
In the Moulin Rouge one evening I was sitting
 
Sipping coctails with the Empress Josephine
 
When along the great white way
 
Napoleon chanced to stray
 
And I shot him in the belly with a bean
 
Now you may believe that what I say is not true
 
But what difference can that really make to you?
 
I'm just shooting you this line
 
just
  to pass away the time
 
And now I going to quit because I
'm through

JESSE JAii S as sung by  L

i-da Hi d1e
 
Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man
 
He robbed the Danville train
 
And a dirty little coward shot Mister Howard
 
That laid J
esse James in his grave.
 
It was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward,
 
I
 wonder how he feels,
 
For he ate Jesse's bread and he slept in J
esse's bed
 
But he laid old J
esse in the grave.
 
Poor J
esse had a wife to mourn for his wife,
 
Three children that were brave,
 
But the dirty little coward that shot I
.
Tister Howard
 
Has laid Jesse James in his grave.
 
It x was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Galatian Bank
 
They carried the money from the town
 
It was at that very place they had a little chase
 
For they shot old Captain Sheets to the ground.
 
They went to the crossing not very far from there
 
There, they did the same,
 
With the agent on his knees he delivered up the keys
 
To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse J
ames.
 
It was on a Wednesday night, and not a star was in sight
 
They robbed the Glendale train
 
The people they did say for many miles away
 
It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.
 
It was on a Saturday night and Jesse was at home
 
Just talking with his family brave,
 
Robert Ford c
ame along like a thdef in the night
 
And he laid Jesse James in the grave.
 
The people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
 
And wondered how he came to die,
 
It was one of his own gang, called little Robert Ford,
 
Who shot Jesse James on the sly.
 
This song was made by Milly S. Slade
 
As soon as the news did arrive,
 
Who said, there's no man with the law in his hand
 
Could take old J
esse James while alive.

One day in Deoer*ber 1911 never forget
 
A
 
A char-ming young creature I happily met
 
E7
 A
 
Her eyes shone like diamonds, she was dressed up to kill
 
Si
te 4 was slipping and tripping down Citadel Hill
 
Singing fol de rol doodle-um, fol c  rol doodle-ur
n
 
A
 P 
E7
 A
 
Fol de rol doodle-um, liddy-i. day
 
Says I, my fair creature, please do r
ue excuse,
 
To take my arm, she did not refuse.
 
With her arm in mind, I sure felt a thrill
 
And we made it all right down Citadel Hill, singing, etc0
 
So early next morning to church we did go
 
Which made people talk, as you may well know,
 
Said the priest 9 "Will you wed"
 sais I. "That we will",
 
nd so we were buckled on Citadel Hill, singing, eta.
 
So now we are married and of children have three
 
But me and the missus can never agree
 
She call-ad one Bridget, another one Bill
 
But I call the eldest one, "Citadel Hill", singing, etc.
