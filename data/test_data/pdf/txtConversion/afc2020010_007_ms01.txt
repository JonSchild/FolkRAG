Transcript of Interview with Charles Taylor, September 10, 2020 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:02): 
Hey, I'm going to shut this door. All right. Okay. I'm Ethan Sharp. I'm here with Charles Taylor. It's 
September 10th, 2020. We're here in Lexington, Kentucky, at the Living Arts and Science Center. And to 
get us started, Charles, why don't you start telling us a little bit about your background, where you were 
born, where you grew up, and your personal story? Yeah, you're good. 
Charles (00:40): 
Our family is originally from the Boston area. And we, we had a pretty nice life. Suburbia. Nice. And then 
I got started working at a discotheque, back in the seventies, and we had this, you know, nobody knew 
what cocaine was going to do, but we just knew it was a quick answer to an all-night party. So people, 
they jumped on it, you know, and when, there was an old expression, when the club closes at two, we still 
go on, you know. But it didn't take long for tens of thousands of people, I'm sure, probably tens of millions, 
maybe even, for that matter, who one day woke up and had the talons of that cocaine buried deep in our 
neck. The thing wouldn't let go. So like I said, I was raised in a town, actually Framingham, and we, I had 
a full-time job also, working for a major corporation, AT&T Capital Corporation. 
Charles (01:51): 
I was the department supervisor, and our, our, our group really performed. So, after about four or five 
years, I don't know. It was actually longer than that, because I started working part-time at the disco, and 
finally came to the point where it was like, I could see something was going wrong, and I could see it in 
my friends as well. So I decided to ask if I could transfer. Back in those days, people really didn't have, 
really an appreciation for addiction the way they do now. It was like, you know, you must be a bad person 
if you did that kind of thing, you know. So we, you know, I asked if I could transfer to our Tampa, Florida, 
office. And they said, absolutely. So I went down to Tampa around 1990 and started out as a supervisor 
in a customer service department down there as well. 
Charles (02:49): 
And the first couple of years were great. You know, my thought was, you know, I'll run away from the 
cocaine. And so the first couple of years, like I said, I get down there, and I got, I had a staff of four women 
and myself, and we decided to have weekly cookouts. It's always sunny in Florida, so I didn't have to worry 
about planning it. And we did. We, we just, we just had this great fellowship thing we started down there. 
And my assistant supervisor, she must have snapped a picture of me one day over the grill. I did the 
cooking, and my staff, they were like the hostesses, you know. We just put on that show thing, you know. 
It was really fun. It was fun. And then about two years into that, my boss actually asked me if I could get 
him some cocaine. I hadn't the faintest idea that he did that. So I hesitated, but I said, no, I'm good. I can 
handle this. So I did. They picked me up at night and took him to his place, and I got it for him. And he got 
enough for me. I said, no, no, no. You know, but they kept on, kept on. You know, it's like the good me 
and the bad me are at war. And so I finally said, all right, what the heck? And gave in. And for the next 
year and a half, my life plummeted. We had a cookout one time. And she, my assistant supervisor, she 
was mad. She was mad. She walked up to me. She was coming in, "I got to show you something." So I walk 
over there and she had a picture of me. She slammed it down on the table. She goes, "What happened to 
that guy?" 
2 
 
Charles (04:37): 
And you know, it's funny when you're going through something like that. It's every day. You don't see it 
in a mirror. You don't notice it as much. But that day when I went home, I looked in the mirror. And I 
mean, I had lost so much weight, and it scared me. And I mean, I broke down and cried like a baby for a 
long time. So within the next six months or so, I transferred back to Framingham. Again, trying to leave. 
And then we, I was back there on my feet again, but then the old crew was still up there. And it didn't take 
long to find them or for them to find me, whichever the case was, you know. And so I asked to transfer to 
our Atlanta office, and they said, yeah. So I went down there for about six years, and man, my life just fell, 
it just fell apart. So I ended up moving back. Well, actually, I got a phone call one day from one of my 
uncles who had been talking to my mom, and she could, she knew I was in trouble. So she was talking to 
one of my uncles. And one day, I'm sitting at my desk, and I get this phone call. And it's like, my middle 
name is William, so my family calls me Bill. And I could recognize my uncle's voice like nobody else's, and 
he's like, "Billy, what are you doing to yourself?" And I'm like, oh. He goes, "Your mama told me you're in 
trouble. You need to come to Kentucky." "What am I going to do in Kentucky?" "Cause you got family up 
here, boy." As soon as we hung up--I said, "Oh, let me think about that"--so I hung up the phone. First call 
I made to mom. She was living in New Jersey at the time with one of my sisters. 
Charles (06:15): 
I'm not sure which sister, but I called my mom and told her, "Uncle just called me and told me I needed 
to come to Kentucky." She goes, "If you go, I'll go." That did it. That sealed it. And so, you know, I hadn't 
seen my mom face to face in a long time. So I'm like, okay. So I made the move in 1999 and found her a 
place a year later. And we became best friends. But as, things still followed me, you know, and once I got 
everything settled, I thought it was doing well. I met some new people in my neighborhood, you know, 
and next thing I know, I'm back into it again. I get arrested in 2005. And I laugh at this, not ha ha laugh, 
but I think to myself, all the years and money I spent on dope, I got arrested for $10, $10. I walked into a 
sting for $10 and ended up going to jail for 33 days, I think it was, before I was before the judge. And all 
the guys were in there laughing at me, you know, in the jail and everything. And it dawned it on me, it just 
came over my spirit: this could be the best thing that ever happened to me. So I looked at, I approached 
it that way. And finally got into drug court, and was in drug court for three years. First year and a half, 
man, I was in jail eight times. You know, the neighborhood's there. I remember growing up, as a kid, my 
favorite, one of my favorite cartoons was the Flintstones. And Fred had a good devil, a good angel and a 
bad devil, right, always talking to him. And that's how I, you know, in my groups, man, I love my 
metaphors. So I graduated in 2008, and then started to rebuild my life. Moved into a new neighborhood, 
and things just started piling up and piling up and piling up. And I've never been willing to ask for help 
easily, you know. So one day things just were so bad, and the drug man walked right by my, my porch, I 
had seen him a hundred times before this, you know. Never paid attention until this one day. I just said, 
hey man, come on. You know, it started me back down there for another six months or so. And I finally 
came to myself, what am I doing? And I wrote my first story. It's called "Getting High, Why?" 
Ethan (08:47): 
After those six months? 
Charles (08:50): 
Yeah. That was in June, 2010. Haven't looked back since. So now, you know, it doesn't even, it doesn't 
even come into my mind anymore. You know what I mean? There's no trigger that I'll run into in the street, 
like, ahh, you know. Nothing like that, anymore. And I know a lot of NA, AA, we kind of, my ministry kind 
3 
 
of bumps with them. And I respect whatever, you know, there's no one shoe fits everything. But I 
personally am a man of God, you know, and I'm a spiritual man. And I just believe, because I prayed about 
it so many times, that I was delivered from this. So I, after about six, seven years, you know, kept saying 
to myself, why am I calling myself this? You know, I go to meetings, you know, AA, and they get up there. 
"Hey, I'm so-and-so, and I'm an addict, and I've been clean for 25 years." I'm like, that just doesn't make 
sense to me. You know what I mean? You either are or you aren't, you know. And I told him, you know, I 
tell my kids in my groups all the time, "Don't think you could, you're going to be able to whip this bad boy 
in a year or two. You're going have to walk this for a while, until you come up with almost any kind of 
obstacle and have defeated it." And so I consider myself to be free. You know, that's how I, that's how I 
call myself, I'm free. 
Ethan (10:27): 
In all those years that you were, in the nineties that you were struggling, did you reach out to recovery 
groups? 
Charles (10:36): 
No, no. In all those years, I was, I mean, I was making great money. Everybody knew it, you know, and I 
was everybody's buddy. 
Ethan (10:45): 
So it wasn't until drug court when you got into NA, AA? 
Charles (10:50): 
No, actually, I think one time, I'm glad you reminded me of that, when I was in Atlanta, my boss had a, we 
had a really long talk, and I went into rehab for like 28 days. But that's no time. That's no time. So I came 
back out. It didn't take long for me to get back into it. That's why I said, "I got to get out of here. " So that's 
how, that's my background, and that whole trip took me 27 years. And I just have a grateful spirit today, 
and I have for years. So I, I walk in that. And because of that, that's what got me started in recovery, for 
others, helping others. I was, I think it was June 2000, that winter of June, 2010, after I finished writing 
my first story, I talked to the director of drug court. She and I were always good friends. And I said to her, 
and I had written about 10 stories by now. I mean, once I started writing, I couldn't put my pen down, all 
short stories, a lot of metaphors, and a lot of in general stuff. So my idea is whenever I introduce myself 
and start to read one of my stories, I just tell them to make themselves comfortable and see if they see 
themselves in the story. You know, I don't want everybody to read, Charles Taylor, Charles Taylor, Charles 
Taylor. That's not what it's about, you know. And usually, at first, I've worked, I've worked, well, I've 
volunteered all these years at the Fayette County detention center here, Jessamine County detention 
center--let's see, drug court for nine and a half years. Like I was telling Lori that I read, I've been reading 
to kids at the William Wells Brown school for over a year before the pandemic and at the Chrysalis House. 
And that just, that just gives me a lot of joy. It really, really does, you know. And the thing for me is, I don't 
go to meetings like I used to, but when I'm doing my groups, cause I always say to my kids, you know, "I 
hope you get as much from me as I get from you." And I mean that, you know, so when we're done, I 
mean, it just invigorates me, to see them in an orange jumpsuit, or you know, heads hanging down or 
whatever. I said, "One stupid move, Charles, and you could be right back there again." So that kind of 
helps me in that regards, you know, keeps me focused and keeps me on track. So that's my approach. 
That's the approach of my ministry.

Ethan (13:33): 
And when you volunteer in the jails or drug court, what do you, do you tell stories, or what kind of work 
do you do? 
Charles (13:42): 
Yeah, I'm a storyteller. And in fact, I think I've written 67 short stories, and I've got 12 books published. So 
we've been working. 
Ethan (13:52): 
So they call in a group, and you would [inaudible]. 
Charles (13:58): 
So I'm I, what I did, what I did was back in June, 2000, excuse me, December-ish, around 2010, I called 
Danielle. I said, "Danielle, I got this crazy idea." 
Ethan (14:10): 
That's with drug court? 
Charles (14:10): 
I'm sorry. Yes. And she goes, "What is that, Charles?" I said, "I've been writing all these stories, and I can't 
stop writing them. What do you think if we could put a group together where I can come in and tell some 
of these stories." She goes, "I love it." So that's how we started, there. But I had two mentors when I was 
going through drug court, and they were also into recovery. And so they invited me to be part of their 
ministry as well. But I gotta tell you, I always, I always love telling the story, when you go into a jail, you 
know, and you're sitting across from some thug, they're giving you that look, you know. You're gonna tell 
them, "Hi, guys, I'm going to read you a story today." "What am I? In third grade?" You know. I say, "Give 
it a chance. Just give it a chance." And then once we break the ice, man, it's like, you know, I've heard 
some nice things after that. You know, like I said, they're short stories. So, you know, you can pick it up 
and read it in 10 minutes, but there's always, there's a message in every one of them. And they can 
hopefully see themselves in that. And so, if they ever have a weak moment, they can go pick up that book 
or pick up that story and reread that story. 
Ethan (15:16): 
You leave them behind for them? 
Charles (15:16): 
I have. Yes, yes, I have. And so my ministry is about telling, telling our story, you know, and while I'm telling 
it, I want you to put yourself in the place. And so the story is really about each of you individually, you 
know. And it, it works. So I've been doing it for, well, since 2010. So it's almost 10 years. 10 years. 
Ethan (15:51): 
Maybe you can tell us a little bit about what it's like to write a story. You know, what's that process like 
for you? And do you, I know you have the illustrations, do you do those? 
Charles (16:04): 
5 
 
That's my sisters. Both of my sisters, Clarice and Yvonne. I don't know. My pastor asked me that a lot too. 
He goes, "Do you actually see yourself in these stories?" I said, "Yes, I do pastor." It's a, it's a, to me, it's a 
gift that's been given to me, a blessing that's been bestowed upon me. And like, I'll just sit outside, and 
something will just come to my mind. And, well, here's how I kind of got started. One of my mentors, in 
drug court, we used to have to do these homework questions. Everybody's like, oh, man. They have to go 
home and come with one or two word answers. I'd be writing a whole page. You know, "Charles!" One of 
my mentors goes, "You should write stories." I said, "That's a thought." So he kind of gave me that nudge 
in that direction. Dr. [inaudible]. Is that okay? 
Ethan (16:58): 
Yeah. Absolutely. 
Charles (17:00): 
Okay. And on the back of all of my books, about the author, my autobiography, one of the last sentences 
is, on the page, "I'm not smart enough to do this on my own. I'm just God's pen." It comes with my spirit, 
and I pick up a pen and I just start writing. And I love it, man. I don't like to read. "You don't like to read?" 
No, I don't like it, but I love to write. And I publish, I purposely publish and format my books for people 
who don't like to read too. When I was doing my stuff for those 27 years, I wasn't reading anything. 
Nobody's reading anything. We're just chasing that dragon. And I also have a larger font, and I have a 
couple of children's stories also, that I've written and published. And I want grandma and granddad to be 
able to read that story to the kid with ease, not to [inaudible] look at these little, teeny words on a page. 
So I've had a lot of thought behind this. And I've, you know, I refer to my ministry as a gumbo, because 
like I said, I'm not smart enough to do this on my own. And I have really, I have really good people who 
have crossed paths and joined me, you know, in this, in this, in this fight. And I've got a producer. I got an 
editor. I got a whatever, you know, the different, everything I seem to need, you know, when I need it. 
My illustrators. My researcher. 
Charles (18:33): 
And it's, it's, I always, I told my mom before she passed, I said, "Mom, I am going to do whatever I can to 
bring our family closer." And that's when I reached out to my sisters, and we published our first book 
called E.B. Meets the Lamb. And it's an Easter story for kids. I got, I got, I brought, in fact, I took the liberty 
of bringing a copy of one of my books to show you. But we got, we got busy. I wrote the story, and I asked, 
you know, my sisters to put us something in each place, you know, and they knocked it out the park. And 
we've done a few other books as well. So that, that's, that's what drives me. That's what motivates me to, 
to write. My ministry is about finding it. I don't really care about your war stories. I don't really want to 
hear about all this, you know, ba-ba-ba-ba. And the other thing too is, society so long, like I said earlier, if 
you have an addiction, to anyone, whatever the addiction is, that's what my ministry is about also. Any 
addiction, and I use metaphors, and I say, "Anytime, you're riding the horse, you're good. If that horse 
starts riding you, you're in trouble." So while, before the thing takes us off 500 yards down the path, why 
don't we try to figure out what caused it? So my ministry is about going behind the curtain. Well, one of 
my other books we wrote, and so, you know, finding it, behind the curtain of addiction. And that's, that's 
my, that's my drive. You know, even with the kids, no matter what it is, you know. We talk about stories 
about bullying and, you know, being laughed at, or being left behind and all those kinds of things that kids 
go through in elementary school, you know, getting picked on and all that. So I, you know, my thing is I 
don't really focus on the effect, but all my, 99% of my focus is on the cause. If we can fix the cause, there 
won't be an effect, you know. So I try to get to folks before they have to go 10 years into the stuff, you 
know. And if so, if we can help them upfront early, and I got, one of my other things I always use in my 
6 
 
groups too is, if I see smoke over there in that corner, I'm doing something about that smoke. I ain't going 
to sit here and chat with y'all and watch it burn down. I'm going to get a hose and pull it out, you know. 
And that's, that's how I feel about that. If there's, if there's something wrong, let's go find it. And let's see 
about fixing it. I'm not, I don't claim to have all the answers to anything, but I believe that if we start down 
it, maybe that'll open a door for somebody else to come along, like a 400 meter relay. Maybe my job is to 
run the first hundred yards with you, and then pass the baton on to the next person who can take it to 
the next, to the next, to the next. 
Ethan (21:34): 
And when you, when you read, when you're reading with kids, you have, can you tell us about the stories 
that you read with them? 
Charles (21:42): 
All my, all my stories are about suffering. Pain. Abuse. And they're all things I know about. So I try to bring 
those kinds of things to kids before they are put in a situation like I was. Hmmm. Sorry. 
Ethan (22:02): 
That's okay. 
Ethan (22:09): 
So I try to, again, I try to be that buffer for, and I call all of my people my kids. I'm 68 years old, you know? 
So y'all are all my kids, you know what I mean? Even in third grade, all the way up to the whatever, you 
know, and that's just how I view it. I try to make our groups a family thing. So we look out for each other. 
We care for each other. We help each other. And so when I read to my kids, I've got cards---two of my 
published books are E.B. Meets the Lamb and the other one is the Adventure of Bobby the Butterfly. And 
that one is a story that starts off, and in fact, I have t-shirts made up that I wear, and I think the quote is, 
"We may not have a good beginning in life; however, it is possible to have a great finish." I made a poster 
for my kids at the Chrysalis House, and I leave that in there with them. And every time I go, in every group, 
I say, "Read that for me." See, I want to get that in them, man, because a lot of them, you know, they're 
in poverty or close to poverty, you know, they live in the neighborhood where there is no hope, you know. 
So I want to put that in them. Just like with anything, it's like, if I can say, "Ethan, lend me $50." If you 
don't have $50, you can't lend it to me. How about love? How about joy? How about hope? So those, 
that's what my ministry is about, planting those seeds in people, you know, so that hopefully they'll take 
root one day. And they can, I always end my stories with the three words, never give up, and that's, that's 
my message. 
Ethan (23:52): 
So when you read you, you also tell about your, your life a little bit? 
Charles (23:58): 
Not with the kids, not with the little kids. When I'm with the adults, like in jails or drug courts, we're, 
everything's live, you know, because those guys, some of those guys, I mean, I'm always amazed how 
many guys, once you say you had that experience, it makes it a lot easier for somebody to say, "Yeah, me 
too. Yeah, me too. Me too." I'm always amazed how many men have been sexually abused. And in that, 
in one of my books called pain, I talk about that. Three of my four stories are about sexual abuse. And one 
of the key questions I ask is, who are you going to tell? When it happened to me, if I told my dad, my dad 
7 
 
would have loaded up his shotgun and killed that guy. My mom, if I told her, it would have broke her 
heart. So I kept that for 30 years. I didn't tell anybody. Now it doesn't just go away. So it's churning in 
there for 30 years. But with the kids, I'm sorry. 
Ethan (25:00): 
And when you're ministering in jails, that really connects with some people? 
Charles (25:06): 
Yeah. Like I said, I'm surprised how many guys also say, "Yeah, me too, man. Me too." Yeah, so I'm grateful 
for that. You know, and that's how I look at my life, my past. I don't want to get stuck in the rear-view 
mirror, I believe in looking out the windshield, you know, but I do look in the rear-view mirror from time 
to time, because I want to see who is behind me, who's coming up on me, you know, but I don't stay 
focused there. So I use my experiences, like I said, and others that I have known and run across over the 
years too. And I mean, I base my stories around a theme, and then I just try to make it flowery and colorful 
and meaningful. So that's, that's, that's kinda my process in writing my story. I know that you asked me a 
while back. I got lost a little. 
Ethan (25:55): 
I was going to ask you a little bit more about drug court. You mentioned you made some good connections 
with your mentors in drug court. Is there anything else you can tell us about drug court, and how that 
might have helped you along the way? 
Charles (26:13): 
Absolutely. Again, like I said, when I'm doing my groups, they are one bad move or decision away from 
me, from making that same bad mistake. And one of my kids one time, and this is the second best 
compliment I ever got in my life, I was coming and driving them home after group one night. I said, "Baby 
brother"--he called me his big brother--I said, "Baby brother, I hope you guys got as much from me as I 
got from you." He said, "Big bro, you are audio and video." And I said, man. I just thought that was the 
coolest. And so my thing is showing up. It can happen to you too. Look at me. Don't just listen to my 
mouth. But you got to do the work. You got to work, but if you do it, you have a possibility one day to be 
sitting in a big chair. I used to call him [inaudible]. I got the big chair. "Several of you one day will probably 
be in this big chair," you know. So I do, I just try to give them hope, you know. And yeah, this pandemic's 
kind of slowed all that down. But I miss it, man. I really, really miss it, you know. 
Ethan (27:25): 
When you went through the program yourself, was there someone like you that, that inspired you? 
Charles (27:34): 
My mentors were there as my mentors. They were trying to like build a framework, but there wasn't, back 
in those days. They were people who lead the class, lead the group, you know, that kind of thing. It was 
mostly, like I said, around an already structured, proven AA or NA way. 
Ethan (27:59): 
And now there's a lot more contributors, a lot more resources, right? 
8 
 
Charles (28:05): 
Yeah. And that, that, that makes me really happy. And I just want to be one of the ingredients in the 
gumbo, man. You know, I had people I could talk to, you know, things like that, but nobody, we didn't 
have groups like that, you know. And I'm not, again, not judging or comparing or anything like that, but I 
just thought that, you know it just came up in my spirit if we reach out to people in this way. Because 
there is no one way, or one shoe fits all, that kind of thing, but if this piece can help, can join those pieces-
-and that's why my ministry is called a different kind of storybook, you know, it's the journey, a different 
kind of story book, because it's not, I would say, I don't write Sci-Fi, fiction, fairytales. I write stories about 
us. So pretty much, my, my goal was to just get out of drug court. And after a year and a half, I remember 
one morning, waking up in the bunk, my eighth time in jail. I said, "Lord, I can't do this anymore. My stuff 
ain't working," you know. And I said, "I need your help." I mean that, man. After that, that next year, I 
mean, I was rolling. My judge, at the time, she used to call me to, she had [inaudible]. She really, she really 
used to pump me up, you know. And when I was messing up, she would give me that look over the top of 
her glasses, so disappointed in me, you know. Plus, I was probably the oldest person in the group, you 
know, and she was older also. So I knew, I think she's kind of rooting for me. You know, so when I let her 
down, man, she gave me the look, you know, but when I did well, man, she was, she was my biggest 
advocate, you know. And so, yeah, just little stuff like that, you know, little pieces together. 
Ethan (29:59): 
Is she still there? 
Charles (29:59): 
No, she left a few years ago, and off, retired. 
Ethan (30:08): 
And you, was it at that time you got involved in church or had you always been involved? 
Charles (30:11): 
We were raised in church, and as kids sang in the choir and all that, you know. So I, I always knew, I always 
knew I had a spirituality in me. But my faith tells me that one day, the good Lord just shows up, you know, 
he just shows up. And so he never left me. You know, I was going to say earlier too, I'm glad you mentioned 
that, because again, I don't really have regrets. I choose not to have regrets. I choose that. Instead, I look 
at them as experiences and opportunities. Because of what I went through, I'm able to do what I'm doing 
today. I mean, this with all humility, effectively. Cause I sit down with my group and I say, "Guys, I'm one 
of y'all. I'm just further down the road. If you want to catch me, come on," you know, that kind of thing, 
you know. But real quick, going back to the kids, I've got, you know, one of my stories, like I said, is Bobby 
the Butterfly, and he meets this, his friend, Amanda, the oak tree. I'm an equal opportunity guy. And so 
he meets, and they form this little relationship and everything. And so I've got pictures of acorns, 
butterflies, trees on these big laminated cards, and I pass them out to the kids so they can see them, you 
know. And I'll ask him, "What card do you got?" "I got a butterfly." "What card do you got?" "I got an 
acorn." And I'll read them the story. So they have, you know, they're already involved, you know. I gotta 
tell you, man, I leave there just like, you know. One of my deacons at church, I always mess with the kids 
at church too, when we have little outings and stuff, I'm always there. And he goes, "You can always find 
Brother Taylor over with the kids. He's just a big kid himself." You know, I take that as a compliment. I 
wear that badge.

Ethan (32:08): 
So you also do the storytelling at church? 
Charles (32:11): 
Yes. Yes. 
Ethan (32:14): 
So you probably got more involved in church as things went along, right? 
Charles (32:18): 
Yes. Yes. I, like I said, I, I just believe that I was delivered from that by God. And I wanted to do, I always 
say, I want to try and pay him back somehow, but there's never any way I'm going to do that. But in the 
back of my mind, I want to live like that. You know, I always want to be pleasing. 
Ethan (32:48): 
Honor that? 
Charles (32:48): 
Yes. 
Ethan (32:48): 
Let's, maybe we can transition now to talk about how you got involved with this peer support training and 
what that was all about. 
Charles (32:58): 
I was volunteering for nine and a half years all over the place. People would constantly say, you should 
get paid. I went to drug court and asked them about it one time. They said, "No, you got to have a degree." 
I said, "In what?" "Almost anything." So I said, "You can get a degree in culinary and come in here." And 
she, "As long as you have a degree." So that kind of rubbed me wrong, but I didn't give up. It wasn't for 
the money, but I'm doing this anyway. So I quickly got ahold of that, and I said, well, that's not why I'm 
doing this anyway. But it's, you know, after I went up to speak to see a lady one day in this recovery house 
and walking by there and I walked in and introduced myself and had my cards and everything and told her 
a little bit about me and asked them what they do and all. And her first question was, "Are you certified?" 
"Certified?" I've never heard of being certified. She goes, "Yeah, we can't hire you unless you're certified." 
So, oh, wow. Okay. She goes, "But I can give you the name of a place that can get you certified." So she 
looked up her calendar or whatever, and gave me the name, address, and phone number of a place called 
New Vista, here in Lexington. So they were, they had a class coming up, and I think it was in like 10 days. 
And so I was scrambling, and there was like a $300 fee. But, I forget what their figure was, they could offer 
me a scholarship. Cut it in half. So I'm not rich. So I filled out the thing for the scholarship and got it in on 
time and got an email saying that I was granted the scholarship. So, like I was telling Lori now, I don't 
believe in coincidence, man. I just don't. I really don't. I believe things are set in place for us. And 
sometimes they're rough, but you know, that's when we grow. We don't grow when everything is easy. 
You know, I got scars from a long time. I don't regret them. 
Ethan (35:14): 
10 
 
And it was just one week, right? 
Charles (35:16): 
Yeah, and I hadn't been in school in 50 years. And I don't like to read, and I'm like, oh, Lord. So I called up 
the lady in the administrative office, and I told her, I said, "I'm 68 years old. I haven't been in school in 50 
years" She said, "Don't worry, honey. You're going to do fine." I said, "Are you sure?" She said, "You'll do 
fine." The book was this big. And I'm like, oh, Lord. And it had graphs, charts, quotes. And I'm like, but I 
just sat on my balcony. I got like 37 houseplants on my balcony. That's my sanctuary. And I sat on the 
balcony one night. I said, "Lord, I am going to need your help." And I made a promise to God and myself 
that I'm going to, every night, I'm going to read my homework. And then the second night, I'm going to 
reread one and two, you know, that kind of thing. Cause I, comprehend, whoa, you know, over three days. 
But I just, I was just determined. I saw this as a golden opportunity, and I was going to do everything in 
my power to do my part, and end up graduating after that. And then I was told I got a 94. For an older 
guy, you know. 
Ethan (36:34): 
You probably did better than most everyone. 
Charles (36:37): 
And the thing that helped me also is a lot of the things that were in those, that manual I'd already been 
doing, you know. So that was, again, all this wasn't, I don't believe in coincidence, you know. All these 
pieces of the puzzle, he just saved them and they're fitting in, you know, when it's time. So that's what 
got me certified. So now I have that on my card, and it, you know, hopefully will give me a little bit more 
oomph, you know, when I'm talking to other groups in the future, after this pandemic is open, I mean, 
over rather. When things open up, I'm going to be hitting the streets. You know, I really am. I'm going to 
get back into it as much as I can. 
Ethan (37:17): 
And so you didn't go back to that person and say, hey, or not yet? 
Charles (37:20): 
I called them, and I've called four times ,and they never called me, never called me back. So I was 
disappointed in that too. But you know, again, I was talking to my sister, you know. She might've just been 
the first person in the 400 meter. You know, passed it on to Vista, New Vista rather, and they got me 
certified. Second half, the down the stretch is coming. 
Ethan (37:43): 
I'm sure there'll be other, other opportunities. 
Charles (37:46): 
I believe that I really do. I believe that. So I'm just getting prepared. I like to be on time, well, I like to be 
early, and I have all my things ready to go. So when that door opens, boom, we don't have to look around 
for stuff. We're ready to March. 
Ethan (38:05): 
11 
 
And so how do you see that sort of changing your sort, of what your ministry is? I mean, maybe it doesn't 
really, because you said you were already doing a lot of that anyway. 
Charles (38:17): 
For the most part, and again, with all humility, I was doing most of those things. There were things I didn't 
know, of course. And I took the workbook home and highlighted all those things, you know. So I have a 
reference manual, so to speak, but I think the way I'm, my ministry goes, has gone, and is going to continue 
to go, on a real personal, family hope. "I can do that too. I can be that too." You know what I mean? That's 
what, that's what I believe my calling is. That's my piece of the puzzle. But I'm always willing to learn new 
things. I believe anytime you learn something new, it's a great day. 
Ethan (39:03): 
Was there anything with the training that really stood out to you? That was something new, maybe? 
Charles (39:09): 
There were, I mean, a lot of statistics that I didn't know about, but as far as the flow and how to do a 
group and everything, no, not really. I mean, I'm not saying by any chance, by any means, that I'm perfect, 
or I got this down, by any means. I just know that the way we've been doing it, and it's been, it's been a 
growing process for me over those nine and a half years, you know, and I'm just, you know, it's like, I'm 
willing to accept new stuff. You know, if, if, if you have a talent, you have a talent and a gift, you know, 
I'm not gonna be jealous of those gifts. I'm going to invite you to be part of the gumbo, you know, that's, 
and that's what I think makes, has made us last so long is because in fact, my brand new book is called the 
Green People and it's about jealousy, envy, hate, and fear. And so I try to, I try to do topics that everybody 
can kind of relate to. My other book that also is just coming out is called Breaking Point. And we all have 
one. Sometime we don't know where it is until we're eyeball to eyeball with it. How are you gonna react? 
You know, so those are my two new books on that, but I've got, like I said, there'll be 10, 11, and 12, you 
know. I've been blessed to have a publisher come into my life. Wow. A producer, we've probably got... 
Ethan (40:38): 
Before you published them yourself, right? 
Charles (40:40): 
Well, I'm self publishing still, but they, they helped me with, you know, with my idea sometimes, or the 
printing, putting a book together, things like that. And then I've got a producer in Tennessee. We've got 
probably a dozen videos that we've made. And they're up on my Facebook, I mean, my YouTube page. 
And so, I want to, I want to cover as many areas and include as many people as I can. You know, if you 
don't want to read a book, you just want to hear a story, go to my YouTube, click, click on the story, sit 
back, get a bowl of popcorn. 
Ethan (41:18): 
I need to look up your YouTube. 
Charles (41:22): 
I'm going to give you my card. Thank you for that. And we're working on eight new ones right now, as a 
matter of fact. So we're going to have a collection of those. That's my card. And so that's, that's, that's 
12 
 
what we're going to do, you know. We're, when this pandemic passes, we're going to be back out there 
again. I have no doubt. I have no doubt. This isn't all just to be doing something. There's a purpose behind 
this. 
Ethan (41:50): 
And how do you sort of see, this is kind of, kind of looking ahead, you know, how do you see sort of 
people's understanding of addiction and recovery changing? Cause you've mentioned before, I thought 
that was a good point, that when you got started using, people didn't really have an understanding of it. 
How do you, how, how has that changed, and how do you see it changing? 
Charles (42:15): 
My hope is that people are going to want to look more at the cause. I mean, excuse me, yeah, the cause. 
And I think if we continue going in that direction, we're going to get people earlier. We're going to be able 
to help people or inject something besides that crazy thinking. I mean, I know when I was out there, all I 
could think of was when is it time to go home, on Friday at five, they would sit on my porch, the drug 
dealers, you know, waiting for me, kind of thing. You know what I mean? I was consumed with that. And 
I mean, that's just how that thing is. So if we can, if we can offer and inject some hope, some promise I 
tell my group all the time, "I'm not here to try to convert you or preach to you or anything like that." 
Because in the jail situation, I've learned real quick, we had Muslims, we had Jews, we had atheists, we 
had Christians. We, you know, so you have a mixed bag of people in that group, you know, and I want to 
reach every one of them. I don't care you know, that's my purpose. So I try, that's why I try to make my 
things as general as possible. But at the same time, I believe in the Lord, and I want people to say, you 
know, "What's he got?" And if I can draw them, then I'm going to tell them yeah. But I'm not going to go 
in there and dump it on the table. So that's been my approach too. 
Ethan (43:48): 
I remember back in the training, there was some discussion about, you know, how do you discuss your 
higher power as a peer support specialist? I don't know if you recall that. Did you, was that a concern that 
you had? 
Charles (44:10): 
No, because I, like I said, I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing, working, not work but 
volunteering in the jails for nine years, eight years. So I've already met that. And like I said earlier, I don't 
mind learning new stuff. You know, I don't, I don't mind making mistakes, to be honest with you, Ethan, 
as long as I learned from them, you know. I look back and say, wow, I, you know, I'm not there anymore. 
You know, that's like, that's a satisfying feeling for me. It gives me a lot of gratitude. In fact, that's the next 
story we're going to make a video on. It's one of my stories I just wrote about two months ago. But it's 
sincere. I mean, I have that gratitude. So I don't, like I said, I know in NA, AA, and that's the thing that just 
made me crazy. Cause you can pick anything in here you want, you could pick the chair to be a higher 
power. I guess I understood it, but I wasn't believing it. So I had a conflict with that there, too. So, again, I 
don't, I let people know I believe in God, and he's in here, you know. In my books, on my pages, I mention 
the Lord. I have no problem with that at all. But I don't come in here saying this is what you gotta have to 
do to get duh-duh-duh-duh. You know, again, I want him to say, "Why is he so hopeful? Why is he so joyful 
right now?" So then, no, "Sit down," if you asked me. 
Ethan (45:40): 
13 
 
Let me ask you this question that we had here, so what do you kind of see the role of peer support 
specialist being? 
Charles (45:49): 
I think based on the class, everybody in that class had struggled at one time or another. I know some 
people who run groups who have never had an addiction. They run groups. They kind of get mad at me. 
They have in the past, because you know, I'll just say, who better knows you? You know, like I said earlier, 
"I'm one of you all. I'm just further down the road." So I know what it feels like at 1:30 in the morning for 
that thing, just to be crawling all over you. I know what it feels to be kneeling down in front of the toilet. 
I know what it feels like to be laying in bed, you know, just crazy, that feeling. I know that feeling. So you 
have, there's nothing that you can say that I haven't seen or heard, or somebody in here hasn't, you know. 
So I always say, "If you got something wrong, something eating your lunch right now, leave it here at the 
desk. Leave it here at the table before you go home. Don't keep carrying this stuff around with you. Bring 
it to the table. Let's talk about it." You know, that's, that's what I think a peer support specialist will be 
able to do versus somebody who's never been there. You know. I'm grateful for the folks that have been 
there to help get things rolling, but it's just like anything, I mean, you, you could keep adding to and 
building to it. And I think the peer support specialist is the next, the next level. I really do. I think we can 
really go in there and relate to these people without any kind of judgment at all. You know, or expectations 
even, you know. I know some people, just like, like I said, I love metaphors. This process is like 
weightlifting. You don't go into the gym and try to lift 500 pounds if you've never lifted weights before. 
And who cares if you can only lift 25. Lift 25, and then do that for a couple of weeks, and then jump up to 
40 and then to 60 or whatever, you know. It's just incremental. It's a process. I love it. I love the process 
of everything, man. I love watching things grow. I got 37 houseplants. I've had them for years. So I love 
the process, you know. And I don't know, I just, I call my ministry, the journey for a reason, because I love 
the journey. I love the journey, to just all of a sudden have, you know, wake up one morning and 
everything's fine, that to me is no fun. 
Charles (48:15): 
If got to stumble and get back up again, it strengthens me, you know. It, it brings other people into my 
life, you know, that maybe want to help me get back up on my feet. You know, those kinds of things. I 
mean, that's, that's what my ministry is all about, man, hope and showing it, not just talking it, you know. 
One of my favorite things I always say to my, you know, my pastor and I always talk about, I say, "I don't 
really pay attention to what comes out of your mouth. What I pay attention to is your hands and your 
feet." So if you are working it, I mean, anybody can quote the Bible, memorize scriptures, memorize all 
these details and stuff around, about everything, but are you doing it? Are you doing it? Then, they'll listen 
to you. They'll have more respect for you. You know, I'm not impressed with somebody sitting out here, 
ya-ya-ya-ya, running off with this spiel of stuff. 
Ethan (49:12): 
So, so you see opportunities, more opportunities for peer support specialists? 
Charles (49:16): 
Yes, I hope so. I'm going to be an advocate for them. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. 
Ethan (49:21): 
14 
 
Not just opportunities for work, but opportunities to keep moving up and having more of a role in 
treatment. 
Charles (49:28): 
I think once we get established as peer support and our value is established, I think that the house will 
continue to build, you know. And our value and our worth we'll be able to help even in, maybe in 
administration, for that matter, or something like that, or when they're interviewing somebody, there'll 
be able to relate to that person across the desk from them, you know, from experience. So yeah, I could, 
I hope and pray that it does, but I'm glad that it's getting started. I really am glad it's getting started. 
Ethan (50:01): 
One of the things that impressed me was the number of people that were in the training. 
Charles (50:06): 
42. 
Ethan (50:08): 
I know. And they have them several times a year. 
Charles (50:13): 
Yeah. That's encouraging. You know, that's encouraging. 
Ethan (50:26): 
I just wanted to mention that. I think we answered most of these questions indirectly. 
Charles (50:31): 
I like to talk. 
Ethan (50:37): 
Maybe we could just end, this will be my final question, but if there's something else that you want to 
add, maybe we could, you've kind of talked about this a little bit, but how have you, you know, if you can 
kind of think about over the past few years, how your idea of what recovery is like, how that idea of 
recovery has changed or evolved for you? 
Charles (51:01): 
When I was going through my storm and toward the end, recovery was, put them in a 30 day rehab, 90 
day rehab, throw them in jail. I used to say that in drug court, as a matter of fact, "Isn't there any way we 
can reach people before they get arrested. Why do people have to get arrested before they get drug 
court?" I mean, it's like, whoa. You know, so I'm hoping to be able to do something where we can get to 
them before they get arrested. There is struggle. I'm, look, we're not doctors, don't claim to be, but if we 
could start something that helps people before they get a record, you know. We want to tell them about 
hope and opportunities, and you got a felony record now. I mean that, that logic doesn't, you know, it just 
doesn't work with me. So I believe and I'm hoping that as it progresses, that there'll be a way in which we 
can reach out to people. You know, that you can, you can see or invite people, you know, to come into a 
place. I try to reach them before, you know, and again, going back to that cause and effect thing, if we can 
15 
 
help them while they're in their cause or while they're in their effect, but help them find a cause, so maybe 
they can make some life changes, you know, before they have to sit in a jail cell or prison cell. 
Ethan (52:34): 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe I'll just ask you one more thing. You know, you said you struggled with cocaine 
use, but that kind of change, you know, the, you know, the drug that people are really struggling with, the 
main drug in the past eight years. Do you, are you able to relate to folks maybe who are dealing with 
opioids, or do you see that there's a difference there? 
Charles (53:05): 
The last few years or drug court, I saw more of those clients. I didn't have experience in those particular 
drugs. But like I said, my ministry is about addiction, any addiction. And I don't believe people wake up 
one day to say, "You know what? I think I'm just going to ruin the rest of my life." Something's wrong. 
Something's wrong. So if we can help them figure out what's wrong and fix that, that smoke in the corner. 
Put it out, you know. Then it really doesn't matter what the addiction is. There might be a medical thing 
that needs to be a part of it, and partner with that, because, to help them come off of it kind of thing. But 
it's here. It starts here, and we want to go here. And we also want to go here. You know, our head and 
our hearts. 
Ethan (54:00): 
Well, is there anything else that you would like to add that we didn't cover? 
Charles (54:11): 
Did I miss anything? 
Ethan (54:11): 
I appreciate your time. 
Ethan (54:13): 
Oh, Ethan, I appreciate you for the invitation. Thank you.
