[Layli Long Soldier reads “Resolution 2”] 
 
Layli Long Soldier:  This piece, “Resolution 2,” was written as part of a series of poems 
responding to the national apology to Native Americans. It was a congressional resolution 
signed by President Obama in December 2009 and this particular piece, along with seven other 
“Resolutions” I’ve written, uses the text from that document. So all of the words within this 
piece are found also in “Resolution 2” of that national apology.
