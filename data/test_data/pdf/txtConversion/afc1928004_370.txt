FASHIONABLE BEATS, 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
Copyright, 1877, by A. J. Fisuku., OS Nassau Street, New York. 
Now, look out, boys, I'm coming, with 
Another rhyming treat, 
'Tis all about these Grand Moguls 
Called fashionable beats. 
They're such a 
lot of amiables, 
With such a 
gorgeous strut, 
'Twould be a 
pity to take them down, 
So I'll just show them up. 
Cheeky snoozers, sidewalk cruisors, 
Twirling their sticks—'nough to make a 
dog sick 
Dyed mustachios, waxed mustachios, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
You'll find them on big hotel steps, 
With toothpicks in their teeth, 
After eating cheese and crackers at 
The free-lunch bar beneath. 
And while talking dollars. dog, and horse, 
Just like some moneyed swell, 
They'll boast of how they dined and wined, 
At such and sueh hotel 
Dashy, flashy, anything but easily, 
Talking stock shares like some great millionaires. 
Garret lodgers, creditor dodgers, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
They sneer at honest workingmen, 
While they all labor shirk 
They live and sponge on others, but, 
Themselves, they never work. 
They loll around on corners, and 
At ladies boldly stare, 
But never pay their tailors for 
The flashy clothes they wear. 
CitoRt.s. 
Windy, gassy, -
cheeky, brassy, 
Putting on dash, without one cent of cash 
Free-lunch eaters, wash-women cheaters, 
That's the style of our fashionable teats. 
INCREASE OF CRIME. [Parody.] 
Composed by JERRY COHAN. 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
Copyright 1877, by A. J. FisnEn, 98 Nassau Street, New York. 
I 
have recently been indulging in profound meditations, 
And the result of my reflections it is difficult to express. 
I 
have pondered on unreasonable individual contemplations 
Regarding our nation's tendency to multiply misdemeanors; 
Uncle Samuel ejaculates ' tis extremely enigmatical 
And decidedly beyond my utmost comprehension, 
I 
would forfeit a 
diminutive consideration to derive information, 
Why progress of criminal license should demoralize our tel 
firma 
Together with peaceful inclinations, we have an unlimited 
amount of bullion; 
Our saving institutions require no pecuniary replenishing. 
We could purchase entire, the elements, accordinL, to informants, 
And still there's an increase of crime. 
Uncle Samuel there is truth in your singular conclusions, 
The tempter is infinitely difficult to successfully overcome; 
Behold the laboring portion of our female community, 
Exacting their utmost endeavors to sustain existence; 
Can you express astonishment at the occasional degradation. 
When penurious proprietors unfeelingly proffer 
Insufficient means to allay a 
destitute condition: 
In poverty a 
female would expire without lucrative assistance. 
Preserve our female manipulator of needles, most Omnipotent, 
Her sensibilities are refined and correspondingly sensitive 
As vain female cosmopolitans of gigantic arrogance 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at alli1Q,

THE PULL-BACK DRESS. 
Written expressly for JAMES I RoomE, by BEY 
I'll sing to you a 
song about 
The fashions now-a- days. 
The people all are dressing in 
Such very curious ways; 
The 
einis. especially. who have lost 
All common sense. I 
guess, 
The way they sling themselves around 
Each one in a 
pull- back dress. 
CuoRt-s. 
They wear the pull-back dress, 
The late style pull- back dress. 
They pull them back, and pin them fast 
To make their skirts look less; 
Oh! that's the pull- hack dress. 
The famous pull- back dross. 
Paine Fashion must have been on it drunk 
'When she invented the pull- back dress. 
Iopt;E:. 
You'll meet a 
gay and dashing girl. 
While walking down the street. 
All pinned back in her crinoline. 
The style she thinks so sweet. 
Bu if she was to tell the truth. 
She surely would confess. 
She's afraid to sit, for fear she'll bust 
The pueker-string of her dress. 
They wear. etc. 
While out to- day. I 
met a 
t
-
rirl 
Dressed in the latest style. 
A 
little mishap that she met, 
Provoked from me a 
smile; 
She stepped upon an orange- peel, 
It caused an awful mess. 
Her heels flew up, her lead eame down. 
That settled that pull- back dress.

THE BLUE-BOTTLED FLY. 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by J. 
D. 
ROOME. 
I'm going to sing of the bore of my life. 
TIe's worse than a 
mother-in-law of a 
wife. 
lie comes every morning, when I 
am in bed, 
And rambles all over my body and head: 
He buzzes and sing- all the songs of the day. 
Crawls up my proboscis in innocent play. 
He hums in my ear till I'm ready to die, 
And drives me most crazy, this blue-bottled fly. 
He tackles my eyebrow, and waltzes al ,out, 
He tickles my ribs till I'm ready to shout. 
He lights on my lip, and commences to eat: 
Tie plays Caledonian games on my feet. 
He sits on my forehead. sings birdie, good- by. 
I 
make a 
smash at him and blacken my eye. 
I 
never can catch him, it's no use to try, 
He bites like a 
buzzard, this blue- bottled fly. 
I 
grab up the sheet and I 
cover my head. 
He crawls on the carpet, and bites through the bed, 
He jumps on my bugle. and there he will stick. 
While I 
put on my pants and go hunt for a 
brick, 
And when I 
get ready to lather and shave. 
He leaps on the razor and once more I 
rave. 
I 
snatch quickly for him to kill him or die, 
I 
cut off three fingers. but I 
don't get the fly. 
PLUNK, PLUNK, PLUNK. 
Written expressly for JAMES D. I-ZoomE, by BEN DODGE. 
I'll sing you a 
song, it's not very long, 
Of a 
charmer whose sweet name was Sally. 
She lived with her mother, her sister, and brother, 
In a 
tenement house up an alley ; 
But she gave me the shake for a 
fellow named Jake, 
In a 
manner that wasn't so slow. 
And she'd listen each night, in the greatest delight, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Nip up de dooden day. 
That was the music which stole her away. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk. plunk. 
Now. I 
hadn't a 
show, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
I 
spent all me cash in cutting a 
dash. 
To try and win my charmer's hand, 
But I 
found mighty soon, that I 
was a 
loon. 
And no show in the game did I 
stand' 
I 
played a 
fools part, for she'd given Ler heart 
To the fellow who beat inc. you know. 
I 
had to take water, for I 
found he had caught her, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
Plunk, plunk, etc. 
At last they were wed, and I've heard it said, 
They lead a 
most miserable life. 
They're wretched and poor. and she's sorry I'm sure 
That ever she became his wife; 
For their bread and butter, they stand in the gutter, 
And giving a 
sort of 
now ; 
The jaw- bone she tickles. and picks up the nickels, 
on the old banjo.

YOUTH WITHOUT REPROOF. 
Words by Jonx M. TURNER. 
Sung by J. 
P. 
BOOME. 
Good evening folks, I 
have just dropped in 
To play for you, and to swing niv chin; 
If I 
don't suit, just mit ‘• Police!" 
And bind rue over to keep the peace, 
Or lay Inc up on the mantel piece. 
My song relates to a 
youth named Slade, 
And biting pies was this youn , man's trade; 
He could bite any pie that he ever yet saw. 
Whether baked in the oven or served up raw, 
Fricasied pie from the hardware store. 
CHORUS. 
For he was a 
youth without reproof, 
lie'd gobble a 
pie with a 
Mansard roof. 
A pie- us 111:111 was this youth named Slade. 
With a 
specialty act in the pie- biting trade. 
Pies one foot thick were nothing to bin— 
He'd open his jaws and in they'd skini ; 
Canned tripe pie just suited his taste. 
And a 
Washington pie he ne'er would waste, 
For he would stow it away ni haste. 
But baker's pies he did most despise. 
Because he said they were stuffed with flies. 
lfis principal act was to stand on his eye, 
And catch in his mouth a 
home- uncle 
For this young man was terrible fly. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
This mournful tale T 
must now conclude; 
If I 
stay longer you'll think me rude. 
But before I 
go I 
must here relate, 
That biter of pies' deplorable :ate, 
Which happened precisely as I 
state. 
He made a 
match, to his friends surprise, 
To bite through ninety plates and pies; 
But those big pies were stuffed with sand, 
And they gave him a 
walk in the promised land ; 
So he's got a 
date you will understand. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
BIG-FOOT SAL, 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by J. L. 
FREE:NY, expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME. Banjoist. 
The gal that I 
will sing about, 
Is very fond of me 
Around the waist she's very stout, 
And stands about ten foot three. 
Her foot is a 
tremendous size— 
She wears number twenty-two; 
Her ears are like an elephant's. 
And she walks like a 
kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
Oh: big- foot Sal, she's the gal. 
That's known by every one; 
She can waltz on her ear, and drink lager beer, 
And she weighs about five ton. 
She can sing. and play the old banjo. 
At that she can't be beat 
And dance the light fantastic toe. 
With her tremendous feet. 
Tier mouth resembles a 
railroad tunnel: 
She presents a 
terrible sight : 
Her hand would cover an acre of ground: 
Like a 
bull dog . he can fight, 
oh, big- foot Sal, etc. 
She. went to a 
ball the other night. 
Arid what do you think she done ? 
To raise a 
muss, iie put out the light. 
Then took to her heels and run. 
The gals did scream. the men did shout. 
To catch that crazy gal: 
But there wasn't a 
man with pluck enough, 
To tackle big- foot 
Oh, big- font Sal, etc.

UNFORTUNATE CUSS. 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
I'm an unfortunate cuss as ever you did see: 
I 
loved a 
gal, her name it was Sal, but she didn't love me; 
For she had another fellow, and he was a 
regular beat, 
lie was chief engineer of a 
peanut stand, and he sold them on 
the street. 
But if ever I 
catch that fellow, there's one thing I 
can tell, 
I'll make him look blue. that's what I'll do, and he'll wish 
was in—well, 
Jerusalem, or some other place, or that he had never been born, 
For I'll knock out his eye with a 
cranberry pie. and give him a 
bust in the horn.

She's fat, ragged, saucy, and tall, and she wears a 
big water. 
fall; 
She's a 
healthy dead beat, arid me she did cheat. but I'll get 
square for all. 
I 
bought her a 
new set of teeth, and I 
gave her a 
camel's-hair 
shawl ; 
She looks very neat, all but her big feet, and them she'll never 
make small. 
For she goes out every night, walking with this feller. 
Ice-cream and pig's feet, every night he will treat, down in a 
lager-beer cellar. 
But I'm bound to be revenged, for to me he's done plenty ; 
I'll go and get tight, and I'll kick up a 
light, on his eye I'll put 
a 
big shanty. 
make her give back them teeth. and everything that I 
bought her. 
She tries to be Zfly. and she's old enough to chew hay, and be-
, sides she's a 
fisherman's daughter. 
She ought to go peddling fish, and live on pump water; 
She wont have any teeth to chew up her bash, and I 
don't 
think that she ought to. 
So;when she meets this pea-nut peddler, she can tell him what 
I've done; 
If he comes around here. I'll bite off his ear, and then 
have 
lots of fun. 
So I 
think the best thing she can do. is to s'art for Salt Lake 
ci ty 
give her a 
dollar a 
week, arid all she can eat, if she will kil?. 
herself just out of pity.

BOLIVAR BILL. 
Written by JIM MASS. 
Sung by J. D. 
ROOME. 
Bolivar Bill was a 
pea-nut man, 
And he had a 
lovely daughter, 
With eyes that looked like oyster-shells, 
And nose as fiat as a 
quarter; 
She was graceful as a 
cord of wood, 
Her feet was full of bunions, 
Her mouth was as wide as the Erie canal, 
And her breath was as sweet as onions. 
Gno.—And she'd say oh, my! fie, for shame! 
Do you carry a 
pop, sir? 
Go, take a 
drop, sir. 
Oh, my! fie, for shame! 
Jimmie, I 
think you're too fresh. 
She dressed up in the latest style, 
She looked just like a 
clothes-rack, 
With a 
horse's tail for a 
water-fall, 
And a 
dish-rag for a 
pin-back, 
With government shoes, about nineteen, 
With a 
brick-bat for a 
locket, 
And a 
big tin pan for a 
diamond pin, 
And a 
ham- bone in her pocket. 
eno.—And he'd say, Tat, tar! tat, tar! my baby dear, 
111 meet you in the park 
If you treat to lager beer; 
Now, don't you think yourself, 
That you are a 
little queer, 
And, I 
think, the best thing you can do, 
Is slide off on your ear. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And tried his heart to slaughter, 
His hair was red, his teeth were loose, 
And he peddled chalk and water, 
He used to drive a 
stump- tail mule, 
With eyes that folks call gugle, 
And when he went to see his girl, 
He whistled Yankee Doodle. 
Crto.—For he was " the belle of the ball," yes, 
He wouldn't have it at all, yes, 
He sheried he shook her, 
Oh! he had a 
terrible gall.

As I 
go down the street 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet ; 
I 
asked my cousin Sally once, 
Why it was they smiled so sweet? 
She says, you are a 
perfect dunce, 
They are laughing at your feet. 
CHORUS. 
I blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control. 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh ! Sally Bless my Soul. 
Of all the talents I 
possess, 
These feet they are my pride ; 
They are good sized, and cost me less 
To walk with, than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go; 
But Sally filled me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
blushed, &c. 
No'', I've resolved to search this town 
For smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by; 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in thq style ; 
And when I 
meet my 
-love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile. 
CHORUS. 
Then joy will take the place of grief, 
My anguish I'll control, 
And sing, ' till I 
get out of breath, 
Oh ! Sally Bless my Soul. 
As sung by the Monarchs, DRIXIIINTY & CUMMINGS. 
Oh dear ! I 
feel so happy, 
That I 
could fly away ; 
But a 
yellow gal has told me 
For her dear sake to stay ; 
She's pretty and she's handsome ; 
In love with her I 
fell, 
And my pretty charmer's cognomen 
Is Flora Anna Bell! 
CHORUS. 
For of all the girls that e'er wore curls— 
And some cut quite a 
swell— 
She has pierced more hearts than Cupid's darts, 
Has Flora Anna Bell. 
The first time that I 
met her, 
'Twas at a 
Alatine6, 
She tossed her curls so bewitchingly 
And whispered, follow me! 
I 
thought her only joking, 
But how my heart did swell 
As arm in arm I 
wandered on, 
With Flora Anna Bell. 
For of all the girls, & c. 
The happy time is coming 
When we will married be ; 
The darkies all shall have a 
ball, 
And they will envy me ; 
Until the morning we will dance, 
All sorrow to dispel ; 
Then let us hope I'll soon be wed 
With Flora Anna Bell.

We'd often met before, but never did we speak, 
But we became like friends of old, and all within a

We're a

THE subject of my song is not so very new, 
'Tis of a 
handsome yellow gal I 
love so fond and true, 
Her eyes are black as night so black they're almost blue, 
And her foot is just the size to fit a 
number seven shoe,

turtle dove. 
And her name is Araminta Susan Brown, 
She dresses like a 
belle and she loves this darkey well, 
She's the nobbiest gal that promenades the town. 
I 
pay for all her clothes and she has ' eta made in style, 
She never drinks a 
drop, hut often takes a 
little smile, 
She dances like a 
sylph, and looks so gay and neat, 
As she shakes a 
jig to pieces, with her number seven feet. 
For she's, iC:c. 
I 
asked the other day if she would marry me, 
She said she couldn't tell me then, but if I'd wait she'd see, 
I 
pressed my suit so eagerly, she didn't know what to do, 
But she said she'd have me 
if I'd take her number seven shoe,

ALABAMA JOE, 
Performed by BILLY CHASE, of McKee & Rogers' Combinatiou,. 
OH, I 
once did love a 
yellow gal, 
And I 
thought that she loved me; 
She had coal- black eyes, her name was ' Liza, 
And none could sing like she. 
I 
courted her for seven years, 
But found it was no go, 
For she ran off with another nig, 
Called Alabama Joe, 
CHORUS. 
But in spite of that I 
often think about her, 
My heart is sad since she has gone away; 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I 
don't believe, 
I'm a 
happy fig and bound for to be gay. 
One night I 
took her to a 
ball, 
And danced with all night, 
I 
paid her all attention, 
And done everything that's right, 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite, &c. 
The last I 
heard of Lize, 
And her tar heel colored moke, 
She was doing washing, 
Her darling Joe was broke. 
So he has gone to blacking boots, 
To try to get along, 
She often wished she'd married me, 
For now she knows she's wrong. 
But in spite. ,Sio.

And while in her window slyly peeping, 
I 
saw something that did my heart opal, 
Her teeth and one eye laid upon the table, 
her pretty curls hung on a 
wooden peg, 
So I 
laughed as hard and loud as I 
was abut, 
To see her taking oh a 
wooden leg. 
Bally) Solo by E. D. GooDING. 
GOOD people all, you see I'm here to meet you once again: 
And I 
will try and please you all, my object I'll explain, 
To tell you of the slang remarks you'll hear where'er you 
be. 
But the one that you will bear the most is, " You can't 
play that on me." 
CHORES. 
Oh, yes, you bet—these words you'll get, 
Where friends have met where'er you be, 
And oft you may hear some one say— 
My boy you can't play that on me. 
The other night I 
took a 
stroll and dropped in a 
saloon, 
I 
met some friends, we had a 
bowl, and didn't leave there 
We drank our beer and sm oked 
ci gars 
and 
chatted 
merrily, 
soon, 
And tried to stand the bar boy off. 
He says, 
You can't 
play that on me." 
Oh, yes, you bet, &-e. 
'Twas at a 
party sonic time since—I 
met a 
charming maid, 
At least I 
thought her charming then, but I 
missed it, I'm 
afraid, 
I 
took her to the supper room, so happy then were we, 
I 
asked her could I 
see her home, she says, " You can't 
play that on me." 
Oh, yes, you bet, &c. 
The day was set, at last arrived, and I 
did call her wife, 
Oh, horror! such an awful sell, yboune'er saw in your life, 
When we retired and she disrobed, oh that such a thing 
could be, 
She took out her teeth—unscrewed her leg, says I. " You 
can't play that on Inc.'' 
LAST CHORES. 
So my pants I 
took—with rage I 
shook, 
One final look—and I 
did flee, 
For I 
had one dose and I'll watch close, 
That they don't play such g-a-m-s 
on me. 
1'U tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well; 
And its o. a 
diAmal history, 
That now T.'m going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday, 
lie peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday 
Rut Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouche 
On the banks of Gowalms canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clain-chowder, and clam- pie, 
And send her lots of long-necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry: 
Till the neighbors gals, through jeal.f.usy, 
Made up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan. 
When Squinty Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney- top, 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop: 
It tiasoed up with a 
fearful roar 
And blowed him so tar on hg-h, 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful hii-to-rv.

I'LL sing of a 
darkey that used to live here 
lie was a 
melodious sweet-scented coon, 
His hair it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
lie was brigadier-chief in a 
barber saloon. 
Every morning to see h'int a 
handling the razor, 
Folks they'd gather in crowds round the door, 
They alrd exclaim when he slapped on the lather, 
Such a ; weet-scented barber they'd ne'er seen before. 
There was a 
sweet-scented damsel named Sally Magundi 
Provost-Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by, 
.And she'd pass by the shop as she went to the mark'' 
And in at the burlier she'd throw a 
sheep's eye. 
And the barber he'd wait until she'd return, 
And then to the door be quickly would run, 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip in her basket, 
Then drink to her health in a 
pint of Bay Rum. 
A 
little Dutch butcher his name was Hans Schmid. 
He heard of the barber so jealous he grew, 
lie loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
Thm straight for this sweet-scented barber he flew: 
The battle commenced—the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent at each other did rush, 
But the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
For he blew out his brains with a 
lathering brush.

That's the cheese. 
In the war between Prussia and France—ober dar, 
King William made Louis Nap. dance—also swear, 
They didn't fight about Sweitzer cheese, 
Nor yet was it lager beer, 
But they quarrelles1 about the Rhine,

will take, if you please.

And Brig then tried to stop it, 
But they all pitched in and walloped poor Brig. 
Bully for them.

And the colored folks next I

OCTOROON-, 
Is sung by JOHNNY W ILD, 
AS I 
was roving down the street, 
The other afternoon, 
While crossing of a 
walk I 
met 
A 
Pretty Octoroon. 
She glanced at me so slyly, 
As abe was passing by, 
I 
never shall forget that 
Darling rougish little eye. (Break.,`) 
I 
turned around to look at her, 
And others did the same, 
She was so much attraction, 
That they wern't much to blame. 
She was dressed in height of fashion, 
high-heeled boots and musharoon, 
She looked so gay my heart went with 
This pretty Octoroon. 
The other day as I 
walked in 
To an ice-cream saloon, 
I 
got an introduction to 
This pretty Octoroon. 
We chatted there quite sociably 
Pntil it got quite -late; 
She took ply arm, we walked along, 
Until we reached the gate. (Break.) 
She asked if I'd call on 
Of course I 
did consent, 
She pressed lier parting lips to mine., 
And in the house she went. 
I 
never shall forget that kiss, 
At least not very soon, 
She kissed so sweet I 
taste it yot, 
Pat Iwetty Octoroon. 
The other day I 
called on her, 
A 
little while to stay, 
I 
found her pa and ma were home, 
I 
wished them far away. 
her 
said, '• Who are you, sir?" 
And he grabbed me by the Goat, 
Said 1, •‘ I 
am head steward on 
A Coney Island boat, - (Break.) 
lie ordered me to leave the house, 
Which I 
did without delay, 
The gal she said she'd meet ma,

To meet me here to-day, 
Ah I

For she could not stay away.

No she couldn't, she couldn't, 
She couldn't stay away from hero;

'Twas a

For everything looked gay, 
And when I 
received this little note 
I 
couldn't stay away,

Chorus.—Tbirrah 
As Sung by W M, M AJOR. 
Come all you lads of learning and rambling boys, bews.
re, 
Whenever you go a 
hunting bring your dogs gun and snare, 
For those lofty hills and valleys we have at our command. 
Not thinking of the last farewell going to Van Dieman's 
land. 
There were three men from Galway town, Martin, Luke, 
and James, 
They were three loyal comrades their countrymen they 
formed, 
And it's there they were transported by the keepers of thc 
strand, 
And for seven long years transported, going to Van Die-
man's laud. 
We had a 
true-love on board the ship, Jane. Murphy Wail 
her name; 
And there she was transported for carrying on the game; 
The captain fell in love with her, and married her out of 
hand; 
0, she gave us the best of treatment, going to Van Die-
man's land. 
This land in port we went to, was on a 
foreign shore. 
The negroes they surrounded us, about five hundred score; 
They yoked us like horses and sold us out of hand, 
They yoked us to a 
trace, bravely, to plow on Van Die-
man's laud. 
The houses they built for us, we 
made of mud and clay, 
The beds we had to lie upon, was made of rotten bay, 
0, rotten hay for beds, my boys. and slumber if you can ; 
Sure, they gave us the worst of treatment, all in Van Die-
man's land. 
One night, as I 
lay down to sleep, I 
had a 
pleasant dream, 
I 
drearn'd that I 
was in old Ireland, down by a 
purling 
stream ; 
1 
dream'd I 
was in old Ireland, my true-love at my com-
mand; 
But when I 
awoke my heart was broke, all in Van Die-
man's land.

A Medley ; Song and Dance. 
Written by J. J. MC 
DERMOTT, for T M. IIENGLER. 
Awake, my love, Awake! the Moon is shining, 
The little Stars are peeping from above ; 
Caine, wander with me where the roses twining, 
Send forth their sweet perfume for thee, my love. 
We'll stroll amid the rosebuds while they are sleeping, 
To the spot where we've passed many happy hours, 
I'll tell you, love, the secrets I 
am keeping. 
While cupid leads us through his rosy bowers. 
Cuoitts. 
Awake ! Awake! Awake ! 
'Neath your window, little Sunshine, 
I'm waiting for my pride ; 
For T 
am happy little Sunshine 
When you linger by my side. 
(Dance.) 
Oh ! We'll be like two turtle doves, 
Two turtle doves, 
Two turtle doves. 
And fond and true will be our loves, 
No matter come what may, 
And all will be a 
bright sunshine. 
A 
bright sunshine, 
A 
bright sunshine. 
And joy will reig-
,n when she is mine. 
For us, both night and day. (Dance, Polka time.) 
My beautiful Sunshine, the jewel of my heart, 
From her, my own darling. I 
never will part ; 
She's fairest and brightest, I 
love her so well, 
My darling is sweeter than flowers in the dell; 
My sweet little Sunshine, the light of her eyes, 
Far purer and brighter ne'er shown from the skies, 
Will cast its bright rays o'er the pathway of life, 
And e'er guide my footsteps through sorrow and strife. 
[ 
Cheeks so plump and rosy, 
She's my little posey, 
Pretty little, charming little, darling Sunshine ; 
With her charms enriching, 
She is so bewitching, 
Happy day will be the day that I 
can call her mine. 
[Dance—Schottische. 
She promised she would meet me 
At the little garden gate, 
Where she often comes to greet me, 
At about the hour of eight; 
To whisper that sweet story 
She has whispered o'er and o'er ; 
She often said she loved me, 
Yes, a 
thousand times or more. (Dance—Polka. 
Sweet little Sunshine, 
Dear little Sunshine, 
She is all in life to me ; 
I'm in clover, 
Love all over, 
Don't you wish that you was me ? 
She's like a 
butterfly, 
She's like a 
butterfly, 
Pretty, cunning, and so shy ; 
And her Pa says, 
And her Ma says, 
We may marry, bye and bye. 
[Dance—Tra-la-la.

over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one'of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harleqnin, in his tesselated suit .•  the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Bull
