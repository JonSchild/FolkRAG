Sall Juan--suggested exhibit materials for Festival of American Folklife
 
I
. Prehistoric:
 
A
. Pictures of archaeological sites such as Mesa Verde and Aztec ruins
 
should be shown, alongwith more r
ecent
, and nearby sites such as
 
Bandelier and Puye, t
o demonstrate:
 
1
. the northernorigin of the Tewa peoples, and of the Rio Grande
 
Pueblo people generally
 
2
. the tremendous cultural continuity which obtains among the Pueblo
 
people (
of which San Juan, in t
his instance, i
s a representative)
 
over a t
housand years and more
 
B
. Some of these pictures should be aerial photographs, and t
hey should
 
include at least one of San Juan in the last decade, and another of
 
Yunge owinge, if possible.  This will accent the architectural style
 
of the Pueblos, and,again, demonstrate the continuity of tradition.
 
C
. The best source for t
his t
ype of photography would be t
he National Park
 
Service.
 If one explains carefully t
hgir purpose (
i.e. that millions of
 
people may see the photos and-the credits)  t
hey may be made available
 
more quickly and at less cost. Other sources would be t
he Ben Wittick
 
Collection at the Museum of New Mexico, and the Photo Archives of the
 
Smithsonian in Washington
 
D. Some prehistoric instruments, art work, or other demonstration of
 
pre-Coronado Pueblo life might also be desirable
 
II. Historic:
 
A
. The emphasis here should be on how t
he Pueblo people saw t
he Spaniards,
 
rather than the other way around, which i
s how historians do i
t.  There
 
is good evidence of how t
he Pueblo people regarded and reacted t
o t
he
 
Spaniards, even if most of it i
s not historical and not in archives.
 
Among these records are those i
n pictograph and petroglyph form, those
 
presented in dances, and those presented in oral t
raditions of the initial
 
encounter between Indian and Spaniard.
 
B
. Another  very useful exhibit, which should be t
he very first one the
 
visitors see, i
s one locating San Juan in an ecological sense, with
 
reference to the mountains, rivers, aboriginal trails, and the location
 
of other Pueblos know 4L the t
ime of Coronado's invasion.  What this
 
map-exhibit will serve'to accomplish in a historical sense i
s:
 
1
. to make the viewer/visitor understand just why  it was t
hat every
 
major Spanish exploration  t
o the time of colonization stopped at
 
Yunge, and then later in present-day San Juan.  The village site is
 
at the confluence of two great rivers which open up into a great
 
valley for the f
irst t
ime, many trails cross here, and San Juan,
 
thereby, is a natural c
enter for commerce and trade.
 
2
. to make the visitor understand why the first European capitol was
 
built at Yunge, why it made perfect sense for Onate to locate his
 
colony t
here.
 
3
. to show why San Juan was, has been, and is important as a spokesman
 
Pueblo for all of the Pueblos.
 
III. Contemporary
 
A
. At least the historic t
hemes arising from San Juan's locations and historic
 
position should continue here:
 
1
. San Juan has continued to be a center for commerce, industry, trade,
 
church activities, education, and politics, all until recent t
imes,
 
although i
t ceased t
o be one or anot her  t
hing at different t
imes in
 
the last few decades.  This t
heme ties it all together, because it has
 
echoes far into prehistory.
 
B
. With this background, and againsL t
his backdrop, the particular political
 
economic, artistic, and ceremonial - traditions represented can.best be
 
understood.  The present is actually a splendid extension of the past,and
 
only those exhibits and presentations which demonstrate this somehow should
 
be emphasized.
