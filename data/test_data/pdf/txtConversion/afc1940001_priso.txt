The Prisoner's song (with answer)Fly 'way to my native land, sweet dove,Fly 'way to my native
land,And bear these lines to my lady loveWhich I've traced with a feeble hand.She murmurs much at
my long delay;Some rumor of death she has heard,Or she thinks perhaps I have falsely strayed.Then
fly to my bower, sweet bird.I shall miss thy visit at dawn, sweet dove,I shall miss thy visit at eve,But
bring me a line from the one I love,And then I shall cease to grieve.No friend to my lattice a solace
brings,Except when thy voice is heard,When you beat the bars with your snow white wings.Then
fly to my bower, sweet bird.Answer:Fly back o'er the billowy main, sweet dove,With thy bower so
constant and true,And tell him with tears, I wet each lineOf the message he sent by you.A feather I'll
pluck from thy snow white wing,Some down from thy panting breast,And he'll wonder who robbed
his friend I know.Then fly to my door and rest. 6E A1 THE PRISONER'S SONG (WITH ANSWER) Fly

of death she has heard. For Or she thinks perhaps I have vauntly? falsely strayed.Then fly to my
bower, sweet bird.I shall miss thy visit at dawn, sweet dove,I shall miss thy visit at eve , But bring
me a line from the one I love , And then I shall cease to grieve.No friend [ to my lattice?] a soul they
swing [solace?] brings ? , Except when thy voice is heard , When you beat the bars with your snow
white wings.Then fly to my bower, sweet bird.And the answer in this song.Fly back o'er the billowy
main, sweet dove , With thy bower so constant and true.And tell him with tears, I  read(?)  wet each
lineOf the message he sent by you.A feather I'll pluck from thy snow white wing , Some down from
thy panting breast , And he'll wonder who robbed his friend I know . Then fly to my door and rest.
