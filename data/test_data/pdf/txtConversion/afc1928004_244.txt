TO TffE 'PUBLIC. 
. 
With a 
keen sense of my indebtedness to 
the generous public, which has sustained 
me through a 
long professional career, I 
present this volume of my songs. 
In doing 
so I 
desire to add a 
few words of explana-
tion. 
It needs no statement of mine, un-
fortunately, to inform s 
you that there are 
unprincipled persons who do not hesitate to 
appropriate a 
tittle which I 
have earned by 
many years devoted study of the wants of 
the lovers of elevated and rational amuse-
ment. 
"He who steals my purse steals trash, 
'Tis something, nothing, ' twas mine, ' tis his, 
Been slave to thousands, but he that fil:thes from me 
My good name, robs me of that which not enriches 
urn, but makes me poor indeed."— Othello, Act 3, Scene 3. 
Song books have been issued bearing my 
name, as if published with my sanction and, 
• 
• 
• 
• 
endorsement. 
The contents of these books 
saved my friends from being victims of the 
deception, but there are many others whom 
I 
fear have suffered as well as I 
by this 
infringement on my rights. 
This book, Tony (Pastor's (bud 
get of Fun 
Songster, published from my own private 
_MSS., and which have cost me thousands 
of dollars, is the first and onlii twenty.five 
cent collection of my songs that I 
have eves 
authorized. 
Trusting that I 
may enjoy a 
continuanot 
of your favor,' remain, 
Yours truly, 
TONY l'ASTOU?.

TONY PASTOR. 
A 
nrooitiputCA.t. sketch of Tony Pastor would almost seem 
an absurdity. 
Tony Pastor is "one of the people with the 
people." 
Born in New York, he claims America, America 
whole and entire, from Maine to Mexico, as his birthplace, 
almost born in the profession, he has been for nearly twenty 
years before the public in the character of Amusement-Maker. 
For years, "Tony Pastor, THE Clown" was a 
household word, 
now Tony Pastor, Tits Comic Vocalist," has taken its place. 
Tony Pastor's songs are sung in every household, by every 
fireside from St Lawrence to the Gulf. 
He counts his patrons 
by millions. 
At his Opera House in New York the popularity of his 
songs are frequently attested by the audience joining in the 
chorus when he sings. 
A 
chorus of eight hundred voices is 
not infrequent. 
Tony Pastor has sung within the past ten years more orig-
inal songs than all the other singers in the world combined. 
His songs are sung in the parlors of the rich and in the cab-
ins of the poor. 
For the past ten years he has been proprietor of Tony Pas-
tor's Opera House, 201 Bowery, New York, and during that 
time has presented to the public every performer of note in 
the amusement world. 
Having the entire profession to choose from, he has been en-
abled to combine in his traveling company a 
greater amount 
of talent than has hitherto been embodied in one organization; 
hence his present company, selected for his fourth annual 
tour. 
Tony Pastor is in person the very personification of good 
humor, his jolly round laughing face is a 
picture of mirth, his 
voice is remarkably clear and rich 
He acts his songs with an 
unction that is irresistible hence he is always en rapport with 
his audience. 
Tony Pastor can truly claim to be "America's representa-
tive vocalist." 
The only authorized edition of Tony Pastor's song book, 
containing a 
full collection of al-I 
of his songs, can be had 
trith the troupe, or trill be sent by mail postpaid on reeept p_f 
25 cents, by the publisher, .

2 Now I 
went out the other night 
Upon a 
bit of spree, you know, 
A 
Policeman did soon request 
That I 
with him should quickly go. 
I 
swore a 
thousand times that I'd 
Be darned if I 
would stir a 
bit; 
But when his big club he showed to me, 
I 
calmly said—" that settles it."—Cno. 
3 I 
called the other night to see 
A 
sweet dear little girl of mine; 
Her Pa no sooner saw me than 
He made for me a 
straight bee-line. 
He fetched me such a 
fearful kick, 
I 
felt as if a 
locomotive had me hit, 
And on my way down in the street I 
cried, 
In fearful tones--" that settles 
THE GIRL WITH THE LATEST STYLE. 
AB 
sung by Difss Krrry BROOKE, of TONT PASTOR'S Great Troupe. 
I'M a 
damsel you'll please understand, 
Who likes to keep pace with the fashion, 
Tho' I 
don't quite go in for the grand, 
I 
confess that for dress I've a 
passion, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am able, 
To show it off too all the while, 
I 
get all the modes by the cable, 
So what do you think of my style. 
CHORUS. 
Fm the girl with the latest style, 
The girl with the latest style, 
In the street or the park observers remark, 
The girl with the latest style. 
I've a 
rare swarm of base imitators, 
Who try all my fancies to foil, 
You must know now that I 
was the first, 
To introduce this kind of style, 
I 
saw it while walking the beach, sirs, 
At Long Branch where the girls flirt and smile, 
So I 
thought a 
good lesson I'd teach them, 
The way to get up a 
new style. 
I'm the girl, &c. 
Bright fashions, green some say I 
look, 
Others think me a 
regular grey, 
A 
regular woman's rights girl one said I 
was, 
Which of course a 
girl's feelings annoy. 
Now I'm neither the one or the other, 
I'm a 
native of Jersey, don't smile, 
But it gives you a 
nobby appearance, 
When dressed in the latest style. 
I'm the girl, ELC. 
It has such an effect upon the men, sirs, 
At me how the fellows do stare, 
They imitate me all thay can, sirs, 
As some new kind of style I 
do wear, 
I've been asked to be wed by a 
charmer, 
I'm afraid that he must wait awhile, 
For to lead all the fashions I'd rather, 
And dress in the best swellish style. 
I'm the girl, &c. 
r 
THAT'S THE MAN FOR ME, BOYS, 
As Sung by Toxr PASTOR. 
IN these days of fraud and corruption, 
An honest man's rare to be seen, 
In fact they are rather considered, 
As not being sharp or keen. 
Yet give me the man that can never 
Forget that upright he must be, 
And who sticks to his principles ever, 
Yes that is the man for me. 
CHORUS. 
That's the man for me, boys, 
That's the man for me. 
Honest and square, and always fair, 
Yes, that's the man for me. (
Repeat.) 
The gay politician quite seldom, 
If ever, thinks office is more 
Than means of acquiring a 
living, 
That don't need much hard work for. 
Yet sometimes there's one who remembers, 
That profits not all there may be, 
And believes in respect and honor, 
And that's the man for me. 
That's the man, etc. 
And then the girls, sweet charming creatures, 
Don't always act just as they might, 
But snarl and snap, sometimes quite spiteful— 
Indeed then they're not, a 
sweet sight. 
But some of them, bless their sweet faces, 
Wear always a 
smile sweet to see, 
And then, indeed, may I 
exclaim, 
Oh that is the girl for me. 
That's the girl for me, boys, 
That's the girl for me. 
Eyes so bright, a 
picture quite, 
Oh that's the girl for me.

UP A 
TREE, 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
YOU see before you one who's been, 
In life through many a 
changing scene ; 
And yet withal a 
little green, 
Of course I 
know it now. 
Altho' I've been unfortunate, 
You will allow me to relate, 
That once I 
owned a 
large estate, 
'Twas then friends used to bow. 
" 
Dear Jack, old boy," they then would say, 
I'm proud of such a 
meeting ; 
How do you do ? where have you been ? 
Your looking well I 
see ; 
But now they've grown so very shy, 
They can't afford a 
greeting— 
In vulgar phraseology, 
Because Pm up a 
tree. 
I 
once could give good dinners, 
Ah, ' twas then the hungry sinners, 
Would haunt my table daily, 
Praise my judgment, jokes and wine, 
Join in con-vi-vi-ality, 
Accept my hospi-tal-i-ty, 
Until through prodiga-li-ty, 
My fortune did decline. 
And so did they, for one by one, 
( 
They left me in my glory; 
A 
friend I 
stood in need of 
But not one could I 
Bee— 
fily money gone and so had they--
Well ' tis the same old story, 
So while you have it keep it, 
Or you'll soon be up a 
tree. 
I 
once could drive my four-In-hand, 
Had money too at my command, 
Could do the grand—you understand— 
flow foolish I 
have been. 
I 
stand here to exemplify, 
Sweet uses of adversity; 
To prove my friends in poverty— 
Acquaintances, I 
mean. 
Better times may come again, 
A 
lesson ' twill have taught me. 
Preserve me from my friends, 
For the future it shall be: 
I've paid for my experience tho'. 
You see to what its brought me— 
I'm a 
sadder yet a 
wiser man, 
Although I'm up a 
tree. 
Am: _
Merry and Wise.. 
.its ming by Toicr PAsTort. 
I 
LOVE to be merry, I 
don't like to be sad.. 
Through life I've been jolly when fun could be had, 
No use of my crying, 'Us all but a 
dream, 
1 
for one want to float—sail on with the stream.. 
CHORUS. 
Be good and jolly, jolly and good, 
Fal lal la, fal lal la, 
Be good and jolly, jolly and good, 
Fal lal lal, la la. 
(Ilepeat..) 
I 
love the young girls they are dear unto me, 
To be timid and bashful I 
never can be, 
I 
was born to be jolly the pet of the girls, 
I 
know I 
am merry, would like to be wise, 
Be good and jolly, &c. 
I 
love the hard worker who lives by his toil, 
I 
hate and despise those, their hands will not soil, 
I 
love the poor boot-black I 
meet on the street, 
When I 
think, ' neath his rags a 
true heart may beat. 
Be good and jolly, &c. 
I 
love the flu laddies who when danger is nigh. 
Gives his lift to the flame and bravely does die, 
I 
love the bold soldier who scorns for to yield, 
The flag that he fights for on the tented field. 
Be good and jolly, ktc. 
I 
love the poor sailor, when alone on the main, 
Perhaps never to see his dear country again, 
I 
laugh at all trouble, I 
frown at all care, 
I'm good and rm 
jolly, and never despair, 
Be good and jolly, &c. 
IF you'll list to my ditty, 
I'll sing to you a 
song 
About the follies of the times, 
And tell you right from wrong; 
'Tis wrong to see the poor man starve, 
Who will not labor shirk! 
'Tis wrong to see that great man, Green, 
Deprive him of his work. 
It was an evil hour 
We placed that man in power, 
He robs but the poor when the wolf's at 
the door, 
But his pride we soon will lower. 
They say we've got a 
panic, 
That all the rich are broke, 
They want to get rid of their debts, 
As did our friend Jay Cooke. 
And then they all can start again, 
'Tis thus the world does go: 
The poor man suffers for it all, 
And sinks beneath the blow; 
But a 
happier day will dawn, 
We'll hail the coming morn, 
When Cooke & Co. to the bottom shall go, 
Ao..1 wish they'd never been born, 
It was an evil hour, etc. 
14 
The flag the boys have fought for, 
And gained their honest scars, 
'Tis folded when it high should wave, 
Our glorious Stripes and Stars; 
'Tis folded when it high should wave 
In every tyrant's face; 
That flag was formed to help and save, 
It's people from disgrace ; 
Then why should a 
power like Spain, 
Insult us again and again; 
Grant may think it a 
joke, but the people have 
spoke, 
And they'll wipe out the foul, foul stain. 
It was an evil hour, etc. 
A 
noble ship she called away, 
In freedom's cause was manned— 
). hundred throbbing hearts on board, 
They formed a 
gallant band, 
Her destiny was Cuba, 
That bright and sunny isle, 
Which shall belong to Uncle Sam, 
But wait a 
little while. 
The " Virginius 
cause was just, 
May the swords of her captors rust; 
Brave Ryan's name shall live in fame, 
When his slayers are turned to dust. 
It was an evil hour, etc.

BOWERY GIRLS AND BOWERY BOYS, 
AIR ;
--Upper and Lower -
lin- 
fitausancl. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J 
Fiennit, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'M going to sing you a 
song that is new 
The subject I 
hope will be pleasing to you, 
New York is the place for frolic and fun, 
And the jolliest people that's under the sun; 
The boys they are famous for helping a 
friend, 
The girls good humor with duty do blend, 
But there's none in this city of bustle and noise, 
Like the Bowery Girls and the Bowery Boys. 
'there's the girls every morning, to see them's a 
treat, 
As off to their work they do trip it so neat, 
If you tip one the wink, she at you will gaze, 
Or perhaps with a 
smile set your heart in a 
blaze, 
With a 
neat little hat and a 
large waterfall; 
They'll trip it each evening at shin-dig or ball, 
Rigged out neat and plain with no gay fal de rats, 
For they've lots of good sense have the Bowery gals. 
And then for the boys they are merry and free, 
And always are ready for frolic or spree; 
They all when you meet them good humored appear, 
Their bourbon they like, but they'll drink lager beer; 
And though they aint given to boasting or brag, 
They always stand ready to light for our flag, 
When the fiend of rebellion kicked up a 
noise, 
Our first volunteers were the Bowery boys. 
There's Cuba's brave patriots struggling again, 
To rescue their land from the minions of Spain; 
While our Washington rulers no effort do make, 
To aid or assist their fetters to break. 
But oh l 
if our Government said but the word, 
The heart of the nation would quickly be stirred; 
To give Cuba the freedom Columbia enjoys, 
Quite an army we'd raise of the Bowery boys.

Hurrah for the coon who never feels queer 
When he goes upon the sea; 
Hurrah for the party, with a

But who never a

Hurrah for the henpecked husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the jolly old maid 
Who doesn't wish she'd been married. 
CHORUS. 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old maid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little nearer, 
Then that's the old maid for me. 
4. 
Hurrah for the man who never kicked 
A 
poor unlucky wight when he's down; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart 
Who hasn't got a 
cheerful crown. 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what he wins; 
And hurrah for the honest working man 
Who's the father of a 
half dozen twins. 
Gamins. 
For he is the man for me, my boys, 
He's the man for me, 
The friend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So he is the man for me. 
5. 
Hurrah for the wife who has always a 
smile, 
And who's not always wanting a 
new bonnet; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it. 
Hurrah, hurrah for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less; 
And hurrah for the man who lends a

TOPICS OF THE TIMES. 
A IR: 
Wealthy Man's Son. 
As sung by TONY PeriTort. 
ONCE more I'm before you with my little ditty, 
To tell of the scenes that are pressing each day, 
The strangest events in the country and city, 
I 
put in my song as they come in my way, 
They taxed the poor newsboys in Baxter street lately, 
Because they gave a 
show all the hungry to feed, 
In billiards a 
big run was made by young Daly, 
I 
think from the Frenchman he'll soon take the lead. 
The Boston base-ball club will soon cross the ocean, 
To beat the John Bulls it will be their delight, 
But they'd better mind and watch well every motion, 
Or they'll cheat us as they did in the Farnboro' fight, 
Well the sons of the shamrock are urging their freedom, 
Home rule is their watchword, they'll soon it obtain, 
Then the land of brave Emmet, of Burke and O'Connell, 
Will raise in its glory the green flag again. 
Married men when outside big airs they do try on, 
And yet they're like lambs when at home with their wife, 
'Tis but when away they're as brave as a 
lion, 
They know that with her they've the worst of the strife, 
Each lady has started a 
plan to enslave them, 
To bring them all into subjection they'll try, 
A 
few blocks from here they've commenced for to slave 
them. 
Where no doubt some young men here have been on the 
sly. 
The good praying women they soon will invade us, 
Though I 
think ' twould be better if they'd stay at home, 
To comfort their husbands and nurse the young babies 
And leave the saloons in the city alone. 
They'd better in Washington commence their singing, 
Harry Hill and the boys they can get when they want, ' 
My wife shall join the band, when the news they do bring 
in, 
A 
teetotaller's made out of General Grant.

THE MUSEUM IN THE PARK. 
Ant,; 
Pat's Curiosity Shop. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A./. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
IN the Central Park you may see ' em, 
The wonders I'll describe to you, 
For New York's got the finest museum, 
If you search the wide world thro' and thro'. 
There's the nose of the cavalry horse, 
Which a 
Dutch soldier took great delight in, 
And theltail of the Kilkenny cat, 
The only part that was saved from his fighting. 
CHORUS. 
Then a 
fig 
for each foreign museum! 
If you want just to enjoy a 
lark, 
Why! the greatest of wonders you'll see ' em, 
In the building that stands in the Park. 
There's the memory of Dowling, the Judge, 
The snout of the great Count Johannes, 
The sword of brave Sarsfield, who fought 
'Nea,th the fold of old Ireland's green banners. 
There's the cent that old Vanderbilt gave, 
The first in his life to a 
beggar, 
There's a 
drop from a 
new made perfume, 
More powerful in scent than a 
nagur, 
Then a 
fig, &c. 
so,lL 
There's a 
conductor that never could cheat. 
A 
driver that refused his whack, 
A 
waiter girl, not on the beat, 
And a 
poet with a 
coat on his back, 
There's a 
model of Nelse Seymour's Leg, 
A 
garter from Barnum's fat lady, 
A 
German could not drink a 
keg, 
And a 
wife that did not wish a 
baby. 
Then a 
fig, &e. 
There's a 
laboring man got his pay, 
From Green, when his day's work was over, 
And a 
sneak would not shoulder a 
gun, 
And the freedom of Cuba recover. 
There's the bill, Johnny Bull's got to pay, 
In spite of his.boasting and clamor, 
There's the licking we'll give him some day, 
In return for his great Alabama. 
Then a 
fig, &c. 
There's a 
girl that does not want a 
beau, 
A 
policeman that refused a 
drink, 
Or if a 
dollar he got on the sly, 
At the meanest of crime wouldn't wink, 
• 
Here's a 
swell wouldn't wax his moustache, 
A 
politician who wasted to work, 
And a 
son of sweet Erin's green isle, 
Who wouldn.t die for good Father Tom Burke. 
Then a 
fig, &c.

ENOCH, 
Sung by TONY PAST011. 
I 
ONCE did love a 
nice young girl, 
A 
beauty I 
declare; 
I 
really thought that she was 
The fairest of the fair; 
She lived at home with her papa, 
Old Enoch was his name; 
She said her father made a 
vow, 
She should never change her name, 
euonus. 
I 
knocked at the knocker, 
Just as Enoch went to sup; 
Enoch he knocked me down, 
Enoch he picked me up, 
Oh! Enoch he knocked me over; 
Enoch knocked me sober; 
Oh ! I 
should like to knock Enoch, 
As Enoch he knocked me. 
He left me standing in the street, 
And looking rather queer; 
I 
never thought he'd serve me so, 
When I 
went to see my dear -; 
But waiting there until 'twas dark, 
Sarah she did come out; 
And seeing me in such a 
state, 
Asked me what 'twas all about; 
Sroklar—I politely informed her that a few minutes 
before— 
I 
knocked, etc. 
She ran away with me that night, 
And next day we were married; 
And ever since that happy time, 
It does to me occur, 
That if old Enoch I 
should meet, 
I 
wonder what he'd say, 
To find his daughter married, 
Since the night she ran away. 
For I 
knocked, etc.

MRS, JONES' MUSICAL PARTY, 
Comic Medley. Sung by Tort:. PASTOR. 
MRS. JONES gave a 
musical party, 
And friends she invited them all, 
There was old Mr. Bonner so hearty, 
And young Mr. Jenkins so tall, 
And singing young ladies they came by the dozen, 
With half a 
dozen copies tied up in a 
roll, 
Handsome Miss Johnson her brother and cousin, 
And Blinker who prates of his musical soul; 
And very queer songs they were singing, 
If I 
can remember a 
few, 
As they are in my ears ringing, 
I'll try and repeat them for you, 
After a 
deal of persuasion, 
Miss Johnson consented to sing, 
I 
piece of her vocalization, 
Which doubtless she thought quite the thing, 
• 
IShe simpered and whimpered in such a 
queer manner, 
And up to the instrument came with a 
swing, 
And thumping five minutes upon the piano, 
For symphony, this is the song that she did sing, 
Oh, would I 
were a 
bird, 
Now was not that absurd? 
To hear a 
lady singing, she would like to be a 
bird, 
How very strange to see her perched upon a 
tree, 
And screwing up her mouth to whistle some new In, 
23 
Could she get any rest, locked up in a 
nest, 
And feeding on canary seed and chickweed of the best, 
So I 
thought it so absurd, to wish she was bird, 
But that was not the only very funny song I 
heard. 
A 
tall, sentimental young lady, 
Was pressed very hard for a 
song, 
Young did I 
say, on the shady side 
Of two score, perhaps I 
am wrong, 
She twisted her mouth in a 
curious fashion, 
Her hands on the instrument came with a 
bang, 
Went over the keys in a 
style she thought dashing, 
And this was the style of the song that she sang. 
Oh, if I 
had some one to love me. 
I 
thought it would be a 
hard ease, 
If she ever found some one to love her 
She made such a 
funny grimace, 
She wanted some one to share trouble, 
Their care to the winds she would fling, 
And change her from single to double, 
So she continued to sing, 
Oh, if I 
had some one to love me, I 
thought tho' It may 
be too bad, 
'Twould put an end to her singing, 
We'd be satisfied if she had. 
. 
Of their singing and shouting quite tired, 
I 
was, when a 
gentleman criea, 
In a 
song that is always admired, 
When ever to sing it I've tried, 
P,1 1' 
24 
It certainly was not a 
drawing-room ditty, 
I'll try and remember a 
verse if I 
can, 
He claimed our indulgence as well as our pity, 
And clearing his throat " ahem I" in this style he be-
" 
gan. 
When Johnny comes marching home again, 
Hurrah, hurrah, 
We'll give him a 
hearty welcome then, 
Hurrah, hurrah, 
The girls will sing and the boys will shout, 
And the neighbors say they'll all turn out, 
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching 
home, 
And we'll all, feel gay when Johnny comes marching 
home. 
They shouted 'till they were hoarse, 
Hurrah, hurrah, 
Discordant voices loud and coarse, 
Hurrah, hurrah, 
Unobserved I 
skipped away, 
Well satisfied with my lay, 
Though I 
cannot say, that I 
felt gay, 'till I 
was safe at 
home 
Though I 
cannot say, that I 
felt gay, 'till I 
was safe at 
home.

0, Squeeze Me, Joe. 
In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little beau, 
With whom I 
walked and sometimes talked, his christian name 
[was Joe; 
I 
knew that he was fond of me, though he never told me so, 
But when my hand in his was pressed, I 
said 0 
squeeze me Joe. 
CHORUS. 
0, Squeeze me, Joe, 0, Squeeze me, Joe, 
It makes me feel so jolly you know; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
He kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
So he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me, 
He did and slipp' d 
from off the horse, and caught me you must 
[know; 
Then placed his arm around my waist, when I 
cried, don't 
CHO.— [squeeze me Joe. 
Be popp'd the question there and then, he did upon my life, 
And said my little darling, will you really be my wife ; 
I 
gave a 
sigh, then said, 0 
my, I 
really can't say no, 
I'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me 
CII0.— [Joe 
I 
married him then, and now am happy as can be, 
For the little farm, and all its charms of course belong to me, 
And when he says, I'm going away, to town for a 
day or so, 
I 'wet do less than give a 
kiss, and say, 0, squeeze me, Joe.

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THEY talk about their foreign girls, 
How beautiful they are, 
And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care ; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every day; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed. I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find— 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teazing pleasing girls; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when its winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is ; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
27 
SPOKEN.—It's the nic,est thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says (very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind-- port or sherry ?" 
She says, " Champagne." Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in your pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pic-nics you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
How happy one must be! 
SPOKEN.—At a 
pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, If he 
has a 
pretty girl with him. 
How nice, it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands! How nice 
it is to get into a 
swing with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You get on your knees, and tell her you will 
love her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
all over your knees; and all that comes from making 
love to— 
Beautiful girls, etc.

THE INQUISITIVE POSTMAN. 
As sung by Toxy PASTOR. 
NOW you seem surprised to see me, 
Walking on the stage, sirs, 
But if you'll listen I 
will state, 
What brings me down this way, sirs. 
I 
came this way to make my last delivery, 
Of course you can not doubt it, 
So if you listen to ray song, 
I 
will tell you all about it. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
read the contents of the letters I 
receive, 
Of my situation make the most man, 
I 
make good news of what I 
learn, 
I 
am a 
peeping inquisitive postman. 
I've a 
letter here from a 
gentleman, 
Who ought to have known better, 
Who had has the impudence, 
To write his chambermaid a 
letter. 
He calls her all the ducks and dears, 
And finishes off with kisses, 
I 
shall get a 
quarter for that, 
Or I'll go and tell her misses. 
For I 
read, S:c. 
I've one from a 
policeman here, 
After some cook he's itching, 
lie says be sure and expect me dear, 
At ten down in the kitchen ; 
Be sure and have me something good, 
And about it do not prattle, 
And you'll know when it is me, 
As outside I'll spring my rattle. 
For I 
read, d:c. 
I 
have one here from a 
nice young girl, 
Who wants to see her lover, 
She hopes her pa's and her dear mama's 
Devotion won't discover, 
I've another here from a 
damsel, 
Who swears five ways of life, sir. 
And one from a 
prominent Alderman, 
To meet his neighbor's wife, sir. 
For I 
read, 8.:c.

CARRIE, 
As Sung by TONT PASTOR. 
I'VE just returned from the Opera, 
Where music and beauty are found, 
Fair girls are arrayed in such splendor, 
And the elite of the West-end abound. 
Just grant me your polite attention, 
I'll relate of a 
charmer so fair, 
She's a 
gem of the very first water, 
Is my Carrie with the golden hair. 
SPOKEN—Oh how delightful to see those charming creatures. 
pose and impose upon our weak hearts. 
Oh ecstasy! delight I 
for 
CHORUS. 
The ballet was really entrancing, 
The beautiful girls were all there, 
My Carrie was belle of the dancing, 
The girl with the golden hair. 
To dilate upon this beautiful creature, 
Is a 
task not so easily done— 
She's a 
Venus in every feature, 
And her dancing is really A 
1 ; 
She can hop, skip, and do the little caper 
On her toes, and leap into the air-
31 
The other ballet girls can only ape her, 
Yes, my Carrie with the golden hair. 
SPOKEN—'Tis really marvellous to see her graceful move-
ments. 
One, two, three, four (
imitates), really exquisite, for 
The ballet was really entrancing, etc. 
In bouquets I 
spend all my " ready,'/ 
To throw at my dar.ing's little feet; 
She's invited to a " tea-fight " already, 
And a 
muffin struggle at a 
school treat; 
I'm sure to be cut off with a 
shilling, 
By the gov'nor who's as cross as any bear; 
But to live on cold mutton I'm willing, 
In a 
cottage with my Carrie so fair. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there's the old adage " love in a 
cottage," 
and tho' the gov'nor does not smile upon our 
union, 
no 
doubt we shall be able to invite you all to our wedding break-
fast, with the proviso that you bring your own tea and sugar. 
My Carrie is prepared to accept numerous wedding presents 
from your liberal hands. 
For 
The ballet was really entrancing, etc.

Mistress Murphy she fell in a

And right down on the ilure she did squat again,

And in passing it struck J. Mc Swattigan. 
Then the windy fell out of the sash, 
And they pull'd out the legs of the cot again, 
The ceiling fell on them " ker-smash" 
Which av course stopped the ball of Mc Swattigan.

EXTRA RECALL VERSE. 
I'll sing you another short verse, 
Tho' I

And I

Do you doubt me! ask Johnny Mc Swattigan! 
I 
would have had something quite new 
If I'd thought my song would be brought out again, 
But— here's a 
fresh welcome to you 
Who have patronized Johnny Mc Swattigan. 
dc-b!, 
I'd have said something good if I'd thought again, 
Fol-de-lol, de-lol, de-lay, 
So—" Good bye" from Johnny Mc Swattigan. 
THE SHOP GIRL, 
Written for TONY P.isron by T. 
F. 
POOLE, 
Entered according to Act of Conregs, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FISHER, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
SOME may love the ballet, 
To see the dancers gay, 
Some for burlesque rally, 
To behold the ladies play, 
To one its greater pleasure, 
To join the busy throng, 
And see the pretty shop girls, 
As from work they trip along. 
CHORUS. 
On Broadway a 
rover, 
I 
view the merry throng, 
When their work is over, 
As they gaily trip along. 
To me it is a 
pleasure, 
To watch each pretty belle, 
And place my heart's affections, 
On the girl I 
love so well. 
First a 
group a-chatting, 
All as happy as a 
lark, 
Telling of their sparking, 
Each evening after dark. 
Eyes with laughter beaming, 
As they fondly tell, 
How fly the happy moments, 
With the boys they love so well. 
SPOKEN.--/initation of shop girl: 
Oh, my! how can you 
talk, Freddy is all very well, very nice. 
But George, my 
George, dear George, oh, he is such a 
darling. 
He takes 
me everywhere. 
He took me to the cabinet-makers' ball, 
at Military Hall, last week. And oh, I 
declare, I 
did have 
such a 
time; I 
danced seventeen sets, and when we went 
to supper, he paid me such attention. 
He made the waiter 
bring us a 
whole turkey, all to ourselves, and when we 
finished that, he ordered fried oysters and stewed snipe. 
Every girl in the room are real jealous, they were dying 
with envy at me and my George.—So 
On Broadway, &c. 
Next an ancient maiden 
Is giving sage advice, 
To her young companion, 
A 
damsel fair and nice, 
She says " beware of young men, 
For once in love I 
fell, 
But cruelly I 
was deceived, 
By the lad I 
loved so well." 
SPOKEN.—Imitating old maid: Yes, Dolly. 
You must 
beware. Hem! I 
speak from experience! I 
was twenty-nine 
last May—She's fifty, if she's a 
day old—and, oh ! but fOr 
the cruel deceiver who won my tender affections, I 
might 
to have been so happy. 
He slighted me and married Julia 
McCarty, she had red hair. 
The creature was only an arti-
ficial flower maker, while I—I 
was a forewoman of a 
patent bustle factory. 
But I've had my revenge. 
They've 
got eleven children. 
They live in a 
tenement house in 
Mulberry street and they do say she drinks—And so, 
On Broadway, &c. 
Dressed in every fashion, 
Fair as diamonds or pearls, 
On they come a 
dashing, 
Do the happy working girls. 
One I 
know will greet me, 
And then to her I'll tell, 
She's won my heart's affections,

TONY PASTOR'S VERSION OF BEAUTIFUL 
SNOW, 
As sung by Tosr PASTOR. 
I 
WILL sing of the snow, the beautiful snow, 
For the frost they oft write about it, 
But when hungers at the door of th:3 sick and the poor, 
Why of course they could well do without it 
Every story you hear, has two diarcnt sides, 
And so it will be with my singing, 
There is good news and bad, from the same source to de had, 
When a 
bell, births and deaths both are ringing. 
Oh, my !
oh, dear every thing has two sides as my song it 
will show, 
there is both life and death in the beautiful mow. 
Now ' tis pleasant to ride, with your girl by your side. 
In a 
sleigh in the depth of the winter, 
And to steal a 
sweet kiss, from the young bashful miss, 
If you have gottpluck enough but to venture; 
For a 
kiss like it stole, is more sweeter by far, 
Than a 
thousand obtained in fair weather, 
You must try k 
some day, on your lips it will stay, 
And will bring :your fond lierts close together. 
Oh, my! o, dear! there's nothing 30 nice as a 
sleighing to go, 
With the on: that you love through the beautiful snow. 
But we'll change now the theme, of our late pleasant dream, 
For if poverty stands at the door 
And with hardship we strive, to keep our dear ones alive, 
From the wolf on the bare kitchen floor. 
It is then that we hate, our sad mournful fate, 
As the wintry wind o'er them does blow, 
And with anguish we cry, as they by inches die, 
Chill'd and cold, 'midst the beautiful snow. 
Oh, my! oh, dear! when the bleak winds of winter, bring noth-
ing but woe, 
I 
hate! yes, I 
hate all the beautiful snow. 
But in true manhood trust, to your brother be just, 
And thro' life we will pass well together, 
If for help he does cry, pass him not coldly by, 
And his winter you'll change to fair weather, 
And then when you ride, with your girl by your side, 
You will find the stole kiss will be sweeter, , 
For a 
good deed well done, many a 
pure heart has won, 
As you'll find when again you will meet her. 
Oh, my! oh, dear! your verdict will then be when homeward 
you go, 
There's more pleasure than pain in the beautiful snow.

ETCETERA. 
As sung by TONT PASTOR-
THE sun was bright I 
walked alone, 
Along the Brighton pier. 
Saw many a 
pretty parasol, 
And many a 
pretty dear. 
But one was fairer than the rest, 
Such golden hair had she, 
And as I 
passed the second time, 
She looked and smiled at me. 
CHORUS. 
Et—cet—er—a, 
Et—cet—er—a, 
Et—eet—er—a, 
Et-cet-er-a. 
Et-cet-er-a. 
Et-cet-er-a, 
I 
spoke to her, she was not vexed, 
I 
lingered by her side. 
I 
said, have you a 
father, miss? 
Or worse, are you a 
bride ? 
Beneath her dress a 
natty boot, 
Forth peeping I 
could see, 
With such a 
dainty foot I 
thought, 
What must her ankles be ? 
And—ahem! 
Et—cet—er—a. 
She stood and leaned against the rails, 
The naughty wind it blew, 
• 
• 
39 
And allowed her pretty ankles, but 
Of course she never knew. 
She heeded not, why should she care, 
No harm was meant to be, 
And then I 
thought she little knew, 
Her ankles I 
could see. 
Et—cet--- er—a. 
We chatted until the moon rose high. 
Above the wide sea foam; 
And then I 
offered her my arm, 
And saw her to her home. 
For many months I 
courted her, 
Our love was sweet to see; 
And every day at five o'clock, 
I'd call and take my tea. 
Et—cet—er—a. 
I 
need not say she is my wife, 
For one fine afternoon. 
I 
married her and rushod abroad, 
To spend the honeymoon. 
She is the one I 
dearly prize, 
All other gifts above. 
Days and weeks and months go by. 
And still we dearly love. 
Et—cet—er--a.

OH 1 
NIGODEMTTS. 
My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodemus, 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea; 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be. 
Cnortus. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus Nicodemus! don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
clay, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian coat. 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPoxim.) And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus 
You know you are my only pet., 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas. 
Think of this well: Nicodemus! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
So she said, Icc. 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh, Nicodemus 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away there's no back door 
• 
41 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain he will say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay; 
So she said, &c. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking to me; said Nicodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoiTis out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh, Nicodemus, &c.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ) 
Or, Where's Rosanna Gone? 
As sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
0 
ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or clown amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole it it, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
C
HORUS. 
I 
shaTI never kiss my love again behind the kitchen 
I 
shall never eiqueedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore. 
Oh I 
where's Rosanna gone.' 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, dm. 
• 
48 
ER an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his tams:, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, Joe. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
I 
should never see my love, ie. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
'To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my gray cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten *er Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, ti.c.

MRS, MURPHY'S SLEIGHING PARTY, 
AIR : Dame purden. 
Assung by Toxy PASTOR. 
Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A, J. 
FrsnEn, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
MRS. MURPHY kept a 
grocery store, upon the boulevard, 
And one night for myself and friends, a 
great feast she 
prepared, 
I 
never shall forget that time, it was a 
wintry night. 
When we engaged that four-horse sleigh, and started with 
delight. 
SPOIEN.—Yest we all arranged to have a 
jolly time. 
Mrs. Murphy supplied the hash, and we found the whisky. 
Sc I 
went among my acquaintances to make up the party. 
And a 
finer lot of boys and girls never started on a 
trip to-
gether, such hugging and loving as there was in that sleigh, 
I 
can scarcely describe. These are the names of the crowd. 
CHORUS. 
There was Sam and Mick, and Pat and Dick, and Bill, with 
the carroty hair, 
There was Sue and Sal, and Bridget and Nell and Lucy, so 
pretty and fair, 
First Sam kissed Sal, then Dick kissed Nell, 
And Bill with the carroty hair, kissed Lucy so pretty and 
fair, 
But I 
with Kitty, the charming girl, of hugging I 
took my 
share. 
We started in the greatest glee, a 
merry laughing party, 
We kissed and joked, and joked and kissed, and sung with 
voices loud, 
Till just beyond the Central Park, we overboard did go, 
Our drunken driver for a 
lark, he pitched us in the snow. 
• 
45 
SPOICEN.—And of all the screeching that ever you heard, 
our gals beat it by chalks. 
It seem'd as if by mutual con-
sent, all the men folks went into the snow-drift, and the 
gals after them. 
Sally Cassidy made a 
tenstrike with her 
bustle on Sam Jones' nose, while Sue Snyder stuck fast in 
the bank wrong side up, doing the manual exercise with 
her garters. 
Mickey Kelly and Lucy Jones got tied to-
gether in a 
sailor's slip knot. it took us ten minutes to un-
ravel them. 
As for me, I 
struck Sally Smith so hard with 
my corporosity, I 
drove her down into the drift like a 
spite 
and we thought for some time, she'd have to lay there 
till spring and get thawed out, 
But at last we got fixed all 
right again for another start, and off we went, both 
Sam and Nick, &c. 
To Mrs. Murphy's house we got, and straightway all went 
in, 
We eat her hash and fish-balls up, we drank her beer and 
gm, 
In fact a 
jollier crowd, was never seen before, 
Than we, when starting to go home, from Mrs. Murphy's 
door. 
SPORES.—Yes, you can bet your stamps there wasn't a 
gal 
or fellow belonging to that party, but was fifty above proof. 
We got " spilled out of the sleigh two-by-two. 
Sam fell 
into Florence's water trough; while Sue spent the night in a 
frog pond, singing Home Sweet Home. Dick was found 
in the middle of Harlem Lane, trying to strangle himself 
with Bridget Delany's pompadour. 
Nick got entanrrled 
in Lucy's hoop-skirts, and as for myself and Kitty, we shall 
never forget the time, when we went sleighing 
With Sam and Nick, &c.

OUR CENTENNIA.L. 
; Crime. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE years now will soon be one hundred, 
Since the people united combined, 
Since Jetlerson framed independence, 
Which John Hancock so boldly lie signed ; 
Each patriot he fought for Ills homestead, 
And well Ile his liberty 
So 
describe The Ivor:: novi completed, 
And so well by our Izthers begun. 
We have crossed the great plains to the west, sirs, 
Our Republic has stood a 
hard test, sirs, 
But in all things we have got the best, sirs, 
As well I 
will prove in my song. 
We fight the wild Indians with quakers, 
Give them rum when they ask us for bread, 
The police beat the honest hard workers, • 
For expressing the wrongs they have had, 
We take the back pay from the members, 
But allow them more mileage instead, 
We allow twenty wives in Salt Lake, sirs, 
Though two sure would drive a 
man mad, 
But the years now will soon be one hundred, 
Since we from John Bull first were sundered, 
When King George he went crazy and blundered, 
And Columbia her freedom did gain. 
• 
• 
We made great mistakes in our time, sirs, 
As every young nation will do, 
But if we, like our fathers combine, sirs, 
The Stars and the Stripes will pull through, 
We have got the great wealth of this world, sirs, 
Our share too of muscle and brain, 
Why should' we our our old banner close furl, sirs, 
And 3how the white feather to Spain. 
I 
think if we all had our wish, sirs, 
The cabinet spooneys we'd dish, sirs. 
And Cook to perfection that Fish, sirs, 
Who apology made in our name. 
The years now will soon be one hundred, 
And what unto us is now left, 
The people they state every day, sirs, 
From every small comfort bereft, 
We've a 
navy whose ships will not sail, sirs, 
We've an army that Congress won't pay, 
We have bankers, oh, no! 1 
am wrong sirs, 
For our bankers they all run away. 
But in spite of the politicians that rule us, 
Let no nation beside try to fool us, 
Once angry, the world couldn't cool us, 
Nor tread on the tail of our coat.

GRANT'S INAUGUItATION BALL. 
AS 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A CURIOUS story I 
am now going to tell you, 
If but for a 
moment you'll listen to me, 
A 
bull- dog was presented to Hiram ITlyssis, 
So of course we determined to all have a 
spree. 
A 
dance was given by Grant, the great smoker, 
At which Parson Brownlow the figures did call, 
While mysel Edwin Booth and Barnum's What is It, 
Did form the first set at the President's ball. 
They all took a 
cocktail, when each dance was over, 
Till getting excited they quick came to blows, 
Oakes Ames called Beecher an old corner loafer, 
Charles Sumner he pulled Anna Dickinson's nose, 
Henry Wilson he kissed the black cook in the kitchen, 
Lydia Thompson accused him of stealing her shawl, 
Fred Douglas when drinking he swallowed the bottle. 
And was pump'd out by Carl Shurz at the President's ball. 
Ben Butler was caught with a 
spoon in his pocket, 
He tried for to palm it on Father Tom Burke, 
Colfax stole the back hair of Miss Tennie 
Captain Jack tried to find how the old thing did work, 
Mrs. Woodhull got fiod_ting with big Ned O'Baldwin, 
Judge Poland's committee they blackmailed them all, 
Old Pomeroy was seized with tile eppipizootics, 
And tried to bribe all the folks at the President's ball. 
Dr. Newman, the parson, proposed to play cribbage, 
To cheat Senator Caldwell, he put up a 
job, 
George Francis Train got knock'd down in the scrimmage, 
With a 
hit from the crib-board, called one for his nob, 
General Grant by this time was " tight" under the table, 
Andy Johnson he flattened his nose ' 2;ainst the wall. 
John B. Gough upon temperance he read them a 
lecture. 
And then :2
-ot drunk himself at the President's ball. 
When daylight approached they lay close together, 
The guests and the waiters were all in a 
heap. 
General Sherman was hooked on to Miss Josie Mansfield, 
With Fronde, the historian taking a 
peep. 
They made such a 
rumpus they woke Mrs. Grant up, 
She called in the militia to clear out them all, 
Brigham Young eat so much that he busted his boiler, 
And that put an end to the President's ball.

NEVER GO 134.g ON THE POOR, 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. 3. 
FISHER, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
IN this wide world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er; 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That in life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man when he has earned his pay, 
On the pipes, by the sweat of his brow; 
Should wait like a 
beggar on Green day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go. 
If a 
man is in trouble remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door; 
Assist him in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never " go back on the poor." 
From the great sea of waters a 
death cry it came, 
As dash'd on the iron bound shore; 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sunk 'neath the tempest's wild roar; 
The captain's asleep, and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short; 
While the lost ones they dreamt of a 
1
-right Western borne, 
Which in fancy they often had sought. 
Can it be such neglect shall oy us be forgot. 
Or that money shall triumph once more; 
A 
good willing hand, a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
For those who " go back en the poor." 
54 
When the divers went down ' neath the vessel to search, 
For the victims that lay far below; 
'Tis " only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view; 
As if " only a 
steerage!" could shut out a 
soul, 
Which misfortune had claimed as its own. 
And dollars and cents be the standard of worth, 
And the " pa.ss" to all good that is known. 
But the White Star must change its pure emblem 
aloft, 
For blood red, afloat and ashore; 
Till the steamship Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor, 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be; 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the workhouse that they might be free; 
But now big Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother has driven away: 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these men who will work under pay. 
And the bootblack or newsboy that toils morn and 
night, 
To keep hunger and want from his door, 
Have been pushed to the wall by these big organ 
men, 
But we'll never go back on the poor.

IF you take up a

A 
TRIP TO CAPE MAY, 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
ONCE took a 
trip to the famous Cape May, 
To have a 
swim in the briny sea. 
And to find could t 
mate be got for me, 
That I 
might be settled in life. 
I 
met with a 
young girl stopping there, 
Her eyes were dark, her complexion fair, 
And with such a 
nice beautiful crop of hair, 
That I 
wished she could be my wife. 
CHORUS. 
She played tink-a-tink on an old guitar. 
Tra in ml, in in, tra la ml, In in, 
I 
asked her with me for a 
stroll to go, 
And my love I 
would tell to her, 
She was an Italian from the land, 
Where Julius Cmsar, once held command, 
And that now supplies every peanut stand, 
A 
foreigner dark was she. 
She told me her pedigree to believe, 
They were lords and dukes before Adam and Eve, 
Did ever the breath of their live receive, 
And that dearly she loved me. 
She played tink-a-tink, &c. 
58 
In liquid tones sweet as beautiful pearls, 
She told of liar co:nnies arn3ng the girls, 
And shook in my face her jet black curls, 
The world seemed to me bright. 
I 
said I'd give her my manly heart, 
That the end of life should alone us part, 
She struck me so hard with young Cupid's dart, 
I 
thought I'd elope that night. 
She played tink-a-tink, 
When home in New York I 
went out to shop, 
To hear a 
street band I 
did make a 
stop, 
She was grinding thus, with a 
monkey on top, 
The dream of my life was over. 
She saw me start, she heaved a 
sigh, 
She knew her chance was gone up sky high, 
And the nasty monkey he winked his eye, 
I 
think he'd been there before. 
No more I'll be caught with an old guitar. 
Tra la lal, la la, tra la lal la, 
From her sight I 
always keep me afar, 
She shall never make claim to me.

THE CITY CHARTER, 
Ain: King of the Cannibal Islands. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FISHER, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
WHAT a 
funny tale I've got to tell 
A 
tale I 
think will please you well, 
'Tis about that late political sell, 
They call the City Charter, 
In it they tax the people all, 
Men and women, great and small; 
Dogs and babies, short and tall, 
No matter how they bark or bawl. 
You are taxed for what you eat and drink, 
You are also taxed for what you think, 
And you'll have to pay if you ever wink— 
'Tis the law of the City Charter. 
A 
baby on its mammy's knee, 
A 
cobbler having his Monday's spree, 
The man who his sweetheart goes to see— 
Are taxed in the City Charter. 
If you dye your hair you've got to pay, 
You must wash your face but once a 
day; 
And wear a 
dress till it drops away. 
If you find a 
dollar you must let it lay, 
60 
But kiss a 
lady you think nice, 
The Albany men being made of ice, 
Will make you pay for the luxury twice— 
'Tis marked down in the Charter. 
You are not allowed to change your clothes, 
You've got to pay if you blow your nose, 
It's a 
dollar for wearing nails on your toes— 
All in the City Charter. 
They tax you for soap, they charge you for dirt) 
'Tis a 
quarter for having a 
tail to your shirt, 
And if the ladies wear a 
bustle or skirt, 
They'll have to settle or cut them short. 
In fact it does exceed belief, 
You must swallow your food without using your teeth 
And every fat man must take in a 
reef— 
Or they'll go for him in the Charter. 
You must pay for your fat, they charge you for lean, 
For too much sense, or for being green; 
Such clauses never before were seen— 
As they've got in the City Charter. 
You'd have to pay if you loudly spoke, 
They charge you extra for being broke, 
And if you at a 
nice girl look, 
Such privileges are from you took: 
'Tis a 
fine to go upon the " tare," 
Or use a 
false switch with your hair; 
But charge what they like, r11 at them swear— 
When they put in force—the Charter.

THE SONG OF THE FLAGS. 
As sung by ToNT PASTOR, at the Opera House. 
And by JENNIE HUGHES, at the Metropolitan Theatre. 
THERE'S a 
nation of brave people held in bond against their 
will. 
But to them will come a 
day of liberty, 
When to the world they can proclaim their little Emerald 
Isle, 
As added to the nations of the free,. 
Our sympathies are with them for Americans believe, 
That the laws of God and man, have been profaned, 
When the governed have to suffer and are held in cruel bonds, 
By laws against their interest maintained. 
(Irish Yag.) 
Then here's the flag of Irelan.1, a 
flag of liberty, 
All friends of Erin now do drink a 
ruby toast to thee. 
There's a 
nation of brave people from the storied river Rhine, 
Whose emigrants are welcome to our land, 
They are law-abiding citizens, the very last in war, 
And in peace the first to give a 
friendly hand, 
Of Europe's civilization they are the greatest nation, 
I 
hope a 
Republic they'll soon be, 
For they're people that we love, and will like to see them free. 
As those in this great land of liberty. 
(German Rag.) 
Then here's the flag of Germany, floating proudly free, 
May ".Die Wacht am Rhein," be one day sung, in the Halls of 
Liberty. 
L_ 
62 
Thrre's a 
band of noble patriots by Spanish tyrants ruled, 
Who are fighting to gain their liberty, soon with victory they'll 
be crowned, 
For they've many honest friends in America, the home of the 
free, 
Our flag has been insulted, and we'll show these Spanish dons, 
That the time has now arrived we're not afraid, 
The Virginius and her crew we'll speedily avenge, 
And to poor suffering Cuba lend our aid, 
(Cuban sag.) 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, so very dear you are, 
May soon in freedom proudly float, the flag of a 
single star. 
There's a 
country of brave people, 
Who stand head upon the list, 
Of any throughout this mighty world, 
She's a 
refuge for the oppressed, 
From every other land, 
And for freedom her banner is unfurled, 
Our centennial anniversary, we shortly hope to write, 
Upon the immortal scroll of fame, 
In memory of the blessings bequeathed by Washington, 
Then forever revered be his name. 
(American 
Then here's the flag of America, the flag of Washington, 
The greatest flag throughout the world, that e'er the sun shown 
on.

It's funny wnen you Feel that Way, 
I 
sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt when first i 
relf in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's gime. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
Cnoacrs. 
I 
felt as tho' Pa tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him If I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned ow 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away 
Don 
to hear those wedding bells, it, s 
funny when you fee 
that way.

feel as though &c.

THE G. P. 0. 
Sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
IN St: Martins le Grand as you all well know, 
Is the building that's known as the G. P. 0. 
Where billet-doux, Valentines, and Tailor's bills -too 
Before they ever reach us must pass through; 
A 
party was employed there whose sorrowful tale, 
Would touch a 
heart of flint, through a 
donple coat of mail, 
His surname it was Johnson, his other name was Joe, 
And he was a 
letter setter in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. O. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
Now Joe became spooney on a 
good-looking lass, 
Whose father was a 
dealer in crockery and glass, 
He often thought of marriage, though his screw was low, 
(He received " one pound per week" at the G. P. 0!) 
But her parent was ambitious, and neatly drop'd 
With horror when poor Joe, " the awful question" pop'd, 
What! think I'll give my Che-ild to one so low, 
I 
mean her for a 
Big Gun in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
You're but a 
letter sorter with the common name of Joe.' 
'rrom that cruel old Coger, poor Joe then rushed, 
Et plans sent to smithereens, his hopes all crushed, 
At his " official duties" no longer was he gay, 
He was " going to the dogs " the fellows would say; 
• 
He was always making blunders, always doing wrong, 
The letters meant for Manchester, he sent to Boulogne, 
What should have gone to Charing Cross, turned up at Jericho. 
So they had to kick him out of the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. Q. the G. P. O. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
No more a 
letter sorter was the young man Joe. 
The girl who'd been the cause of his sorrows and his ills, 
Was poisoned with a 
box of Kamptalicon Pills, 
Her father became bankrupt, and wild with his losses, 
Sent a 
sixpence to " the Claimant," then took to backing 
horses; 
My melancholy story is drawing to a 
close, 
Joe meditated suicide to finish up his woes, 
• 
He went and paid his Income Tax, and then did go, 
And cut his elbow with a 
post card near the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P, 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And that was the finale of the young man Joe.

But the best of loves must part, then an end comes to your

If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
you'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head.

Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have

Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a

to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins.

TONY'S TELEGRAMS,. 
As sting by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
Puna, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I 
AM going to tell a 
curious yarn, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches, that have come across the sea; 
And I'm certain I 
will do my best to nlake this audience laugh; 
When they hear the 
funny messages, sent through my 
telegraph; 
Here's the latest by the cable, which to Europe now is Mid. 
The King of Spain has eleared out, and quick tracks for home 
has made, 
The Flag of Freedom's; spreading, and our battle will be won, 
In spite of king or Kaiser, Chamepot, or Needle Gun. 
They want " Home Rule" in Ireland, which I 
hope they'll soon 
obtain; 
So that the flag of Se:Afield may in triumph ware again. 
Mae Treasury has been robbed again—old Pomeroy's in the 
shade; 
The Italians on the peanut stands have made a 
furious raid; 
The grizzly bear has had a 
fit—Sumner's now a 
Tammany 
man. 
We are all going straight to glory, now the waiter girls are 
gone. 
Harriet Beecher Stowe and Byron's ghost their troubles have 
smoothed o'er, 
The Committeeol 70"s frightened Belzebub as the devil is no 
more.

Our Congressmen are honest, they won't take ihnt they can-
not reach, 
Tennie Claflin to the darkies now her funny drill does teach; 
John Bull has got the " Jim Jams" a 
complaint he's often had 
before, 
Because we get the Alabama claims although we should have 
more. 
Harry Stanley has found Livingstdne, Tony Hartman's won a 
prize— 
Through " 
burstin" the Revere House, eating forty Oyster pies 
The Christian Assouiation has just received a 
shock, 
For old Bill Tovee's jcsined them since he left " Around the 
Clock." 
There will be fighting soon In India— then the people's chance 
will be 
To help the Bear of Russia and set cold Ireland free. 
Up in a 
Baloon went Colfax, for the people he has fleeced, 
Have sent him to his turnip farm, among the saints down East; 
But now I 
think its time to stop, yet eaeh and every day 
III sing my latest telegrams as they flash across the sea -
,-
I'll change them for you often, so I 
hope you'll not refuse 
To often give my place a 
call, ansil hear the latest news.

THE BELLE OF THE BALL." 
The Music of this Song is published by White & GoBand, 23 Tremont 
street, Boston, Maas. Price 36 cents. 
TO a 
ball I 
vone night was invided, 
And being so fond of de dance, 
At de brosbect I 
felt gwide delighted, 
Und eagerly gumped at de chance, 
Dere vos ladies dressed ub so stylish, 
Und as I 
had on a 
vite vest, 
I 
vas indroduced to a 
lady, 
Whom I 
thought outrivaled the rest. 
SPosEN :— Yes, and my friendt introduced me in dis sdyle: 
" 
Mr. Shortie Unkelstein, allow me to introduce you to Miss 
Anne Conder." I 
said: " Habby to meet me, madame," and 
jnst as my friend vas leaving us tog,edder, he said to me: 
You've got de belle of de ball, Shortie, 
You've got de belle of de ball, Shortie, 
You've got de belle of de ball, Shortie, ) 
You've got de belle of de ball. 
De envy of all de fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy like grace, 
But yust in de midst of de lanciers,, 
De lady turned plack in de face, 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she hollered, 
Den took hold tie tails of my coat, 
Do top teeth of dLs elegant lady, 
Had subbed down her beautiful droat. 
• 
Sow—Vell, I 
vosn't mad because she had a 
false dooth 
or two. 
Ho! not I 
indeed. 
Besides, yust den anoder tone 
of my friends came ub und said— 
You've got de belle, Jr.c. 
She retired and von she recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next took her hand, 
Ven a 
look in her eyes I 
discovered, 
Vich somehow I 
could not understand; 
Her eyes vere as straight:as a 
needle, 
-Wen I 
gazed at dem fondly before, 
But now von eye looked ub at (le ceiling, 
Und de oder looked down on de floor. 
Srorsx—Yes, dot's a

How is your belle of de ball, Sharlie? 
Oh wasn't she bald at de ball, Shortie?

00D-EVENING. 
I 
HAD been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state 
As I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very plmsant evening, 
On fancy beats my steps were led— 
As o,nward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A 
lovely figure I 
saw ahead. 
Walked past and said: " Good evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once: 
" 
Good-evening, Miss, good evening," 
At length she turned her head this way— 
And you can judge of my dismay— 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day— 
And of course I 
said " Good-evening." 
My disappointment made me queer, 
I 
stepped into an ale-house near. 
Addressed the bar-maid thus: " My dear, 
A 
glass of ale—good-evening." 
With sparkling eyes she an ale soon served— 
What is it makes me so unnerved? 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor: F'''' 
Good-evening. 
* 
• 
SPOKEN—How do you do, sir? I 
am always happy to see 
my tailor, especially when I 
don't owe him anything. 
Good1 
evening, sir, good-evening ! 
His presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door, then heard her say, 
" 
Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir, then good-evening," 
" 
Pray, pardon, Miss, I 
beg at you. 
I 
quite forgot." (and that was true.) 
The taflor says: " You often do; 
Good-evening, Snooze, good- evening." 
I 
Mt a 
blush come o'er my face, 
At such a 
crowd and such disgrace— 
They shouted as I 
left the place, 
"Good-evening, Snooze, good evenitog." 
Policeman Jones, outside the door, 
Inereased my misery more and more. 
He says, " I've watched your little game befow, 
Get out of my beat—good everling,.? 
I 
left his beat, it did not suit, 
To argue with the stupid brute, 
Cr hear him make me that salute: 
" 
Good-evening, Snooze, good-evening.' 
Into a 
lane I 
made a 
dive, 
A 
fresh street reached more dead than live, 
And there again met Miss Fifty-five, 
Who simpered out, " Good-evening, Johialy, 
goodlevening." 
tz: 
t. 
hired a 
hack myself to save, 
And handsome to him did behave— 
Two fares for one I 
did him give, 
On that unlucky evening. 
When I 
found out what I 
had done, 
I 
turned and found the cab had gone— 
But I'll not forget the driver's tone, 
As he remarked, " Good-evening, sir 
good-evening t" 
But strange things happen for the best: 
If you're amused I'll waive the rest— 
Like the hackman you'll enjoy the jest 
At my expense this evening; 
But luckily be's left me here, 
This place where I 
have naught to fear; 
So with kind regards to all friends here 
I 
beg to say, " Good-evening."

I 
WISH ILLATIMA WAS HERE. 
Sung with immense applause by Aux. DANIA. 
A TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now, papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here!" 
CHORUS. 
" I 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
"I wish mamma," &c. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then. 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
''Oh! live, my darling dear!" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
"I know mamma is here!" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," &c.

croaraann. Boston, Nts.s• 
rvE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam, it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand. 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our laud. 
Fm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, , 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
'It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night  
and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
1 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resIst, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist 
4 
I'S 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
inough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend her/ 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the pollee on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinnin& 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Tour pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himIthey say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prism. 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Jost think while your thinking your wine, sir 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir. 
And scatter your hoardings of gokl. 
A. little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
Aa1 you'llayor more wonder at one..

A " swell" his lot is hard indeed, 
You little know his woes, 
The hardships of the life he leads, 
As his rounds he daily goes; 
To dress he has three times a 
day, 
And never twice the same, 
His tailor's bill's no joke to pay, 
For they charge for Bond Street fame. 
SPOKEN:—I'm rather extravagant to be sure, but one muet pay par-
ticular attention to one's harness, or give up all pretensions to swelldoui— 
Cso:—You see in me a 
swell, &c. 
3. 
At Balls too I'm in great demand, 
I'm wanted everywhere, 
Like me—none other understand 
The Valse—the girls declare; 
And the old ones they all ask the name, 
Of that accomplished swell, 
They think with such a 
man of fame, 
Their daughters might do well. 
SPOKEN:—But I 
can't afford to marry you know, because I 
should 
make the dear girls who live within the hope of expectation quite Jealous 
If I 
should do so—I 
prefer single blessedness— 
Cno:—You see in me a 
swell, &c.

After all this work he needs repose, 
The swell's work's not yet done, 
Forced to Evan's rooms he goes, 
Has " devilled kidneys" one. 
And when he's heard a 
glee or song, 
He feels he's almost dead, 
So calls a 
cab to come along, 
And take him home to bed. 
spox:—For, poor fellow, he's the same routine to go thro the next 
day, and it's really no joke— 
CI10:—But I 
like to be swell, 
It's deuced hard work I 
can tell 
Yet has to be done by every one 
Who vrishes to be a 
swell.

THE OLD KITCHEN FLOOR. 
Stng by ED. BURTON. 
FAR back in my musings my thoughts have been cast, 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed; 
I 
loved all its rooms, the pantry and hall, 
But that blest old kitchen was dear‘er than all. 
Its chairs and its table, none brighter could be, 
For all its surroundings were sacred to me; 
To the nail in the ceiling, the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved every crack in that old kitchen floor, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old kitchen floor, the old kitchen floor, 
How dear to my heart is the old kitchen floor. 
I 
remember the fire-place, with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stood by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving, can 
Puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes; 
And then, too, St. Nitholas slyly and still 
Came down every Christrnn-9 our stockings to fill; 
But the 
arest memories I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor 
ail, the okl, 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
Her foot-a,teps were busy, her heart always lght, 
St 
For it seemed to me then that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to wear; 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new every night though we heard them before 
From her lips at the wheel on the old kitchen floor. 
Oh, the old, &c, 
To night these old visions come back at their will 
But the wheel and its music forever are still; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie moldering to clay; 
The hearth-stone, so sacred, is just as '
twos then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, • 
That when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
Oh, the oldo!co 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of their mother who long ago died; 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
r..'o have them tell often as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor, 
Oh, • the

I 
Want to Go Home to Mamma-
ONCE had a 
sweetheart, tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green; 
But when you have seen her you'll say she's as nice 
A 
young lady as ever was seen. 
And then she's so funny, she's just like a 
child, 
She loved me, but much better far 
She loved her dear parents, for always she said: 
"I want to go home to Mamma." 
CHORUS. 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
It's naughty, I 
say, to keep me away. 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
When first I 
beheld her, I 
thought what a 
dear t 
With joy, oh ! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began to boo and to coo, 
Why she sniveled out like a 
child. 
I 
thought she was ill, I 
couldn't make her out, 
When she jumped up and said, "oh,' ta-ta t" 
I 
said, " Pray don't you go," when she simpered out, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, Ice. 
Well, with lots of persuasion and eon/Ping and fuss, 
The woLst lob rye had in my life: 
86 
87 
I 
contrived to persuade her i 
loved her so much, 
That she said she would be my wife. 
We drove to the church, when oh! what a 
scene. 
She would have the door left ajar; 
When the clergyman said, " Will you wed?" she shrieked outs 
°Not I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
wadn ttoo go home, am. 
At last we were married; oh, my, what ajob 
To the continent then off we went, 
And I 
am happy to say she her nervousness lost 
When the honeymoon ' cosy we'd spent. 
And now she's so different to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day; 
Her marriage she says she will miter regret, 
And no more do I 
hear her say: 
I 
want to home, &a:

NEW YORK SOCIETY. 
Ata.—Londan Society. 
As sung by JOHNNY ALARM 
THINK rye travelled everywhere, and seen what's to be seen 
Wherever I 
may roam I 
make myself at home, 
I've flirted down to Long Branch to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rockaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it in its calm, I've seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all. 
CHORUS. 
Baden Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy; 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals New York society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'et, 
Will to the sea run down, .,where in a 
bathing gown, 
It dabbles in the water or perhaps upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town, 
And thongh it may be nice to drink the nasty utters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa, 
di.nd meet the sort of men you'd cut. at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by far. 
Baden Baden Spa, 
Society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris ever gay, in London every day, 
In Mount St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly dogs, 
At every place I 
think that I 
may say, 
Put there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
Which makes me like it more than all the rest, 
To the opera we go, and that will plainly show, 
Society in New York is the best.

The Increase of Thirst. 
I'VE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now I'm obliged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar: "You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I 
have got you could hold, sir; 
You c,ould drink a 
whole barrel, I'm told, sir— 
Can you wonder the reason you're dry ? 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord, 
I 
ought to have scrip laid away_ 
A 
great plenty to go on a 
bust, sir, 
And drink cocktails all night and all day: 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger— 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry? 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin-sling, sir, , 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry? 
'Tis true what you say, Mr, Landlord. 
Good liquor is hard to resist; 
Just look at that poor, drunken rounder— 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed. 
Can you wonder at his weak constitution, 
When he drinks every Ome that he's asked? 
• 
• 
• 
89 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last? 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend he'! 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her, 
Can you wonder they're hungry and dry! 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder 
When there's so many like me on the beat. 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night--
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight; 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too proud to drink rum; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one! 
Go visit the places that I 
take in; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though Ms heart may be made of pure gold 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under: 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
Oh I 
why will you let me go dry

AFTER THE OPERA'S OVER. 
Alter the Opera's over, 
Gas tries to outshine the stars, 
When half the world sleep contented, 
'We'll champagne and smoke fine cigars; 
For life without pleasure is cold, 
And I 
shouldn't live very long, 
But how we survive in the Avenue, 
I'm delighted to tell in my song. 
SPOKEN—With a 
tootle turn turn accompaniment 
(rein the fair hands of a 
lady we sing— 
After the Opera's over, 
After the Opera's done, 
We gems of the very first water, 
With the ladies we tootle turn tune. 
I 
keep my own box at the Opera, 
I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and lands in the country, 
So much money I 
cannot tell. 
Then why should I 
let myself down, 
And neither spend money or lend, 
For money well spent brings joys, 
Yes money was made to spend. 
After the Opera, et* 
UPOR the plate 
After the Opera's over, 
Fifth Avenue could tell many tales, 
And as I 
am one of its people, 
It wouldn't be fair to drive nailes. 
Suffice me to say that at night, 
We, " Upper Ten," never feel glum, 
We dance, sing and play till morn, 
With the ladies we tootle turn turn. 
After the Opera, ete. 
After your business take pleasure, 
But business, by Jove, I've none. 
A 
fellow to find out his troubles, 
Why hang it, I 
don't see the fun. 
To you that have money to spend, 
Just take a 
lesson by me, 
Live in the Squares of Fifth Avenue, 
Ind the pleasures of life you'll see.

THE BUGABOO. 
As sung by *Imlay ItkaanTorox. 
Music published by E. H. Hard. 
A 
ing, 258 Bowery. 
• 
COME all you tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of 
the Bugaboo. 
(*Repeat 
The day witen first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal; 
She was large and stoat and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never shall, 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so bhie,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead, for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
(*Repeat, 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plow the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the Cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
[*Repeat.

We sailed three years when 3 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark 
blue sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—be 
set fire to the Bugaboo. 
(*Repeat. 
When the ;aptsin found what he had done, he Loud for help 
did shout, 
He called up through the chimney top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out: 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the tad; 
they could'nt save the Bugaboo.

When fifteen thousand miles front land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it could'nt burn

While a

BRIGADIER BRAN1GAN. 
As sung by Mickey Mullen, the great patten Vocalist. 
• 
When I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me; 
r 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
lagan. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
• 
• 
SPOSIEX:—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about .six 
feet five, andlas fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's 
walk—people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to 
come into my mothers sheebin shop every morning for a 
nog_ 
gin of whisky, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in 
4nd the battles he was'n't in; about the Generals he killed 
Ind the Generals that killed him, until he had me as full of 
military ardor as an egg is full of meat. 
One morning he 
said to me," Paddy," said he, "will you take a_shillings farth ?" 
Said I, I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute. " Oh," said 
he, " you don't understand me, the Queen wants men." Well, 
said I, I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the 
Queen. " No, no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you 
/list?" I 
don't mind If I 
do, said I. 
So I 
donned the regi-
mentals and off I 
started to his 
CnoRtrs.

goon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing

But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, your'e put-
ting your foot in it ; 
Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Ca-
lagan; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in my eye, to go marching with Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOICEN :—We were all drawn, up in rasp and file—or rank 
and file as the Brigadier called it. 
One fine morning I 
walked 
over to him as polite as yob. please. Good morning, your ho-
nor, said I, would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater 
this morning ? " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the 
road we started to a 
sheebin shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. 
I 
was pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug 
out of my hand. " Hould on, Paddy; me boy," said he, "dis-
cipline among the men. The privates are never allowed to 
drink, while the officers are around." He put the mug to his 
mouth and divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in !" he 
cried. Arrah, we'll not fall out, said I. " Stand at ase 1" How 
can I 
when there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot. 
" 
Forward, march !" I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, 
he drew his sword and hit me with theflat of it across as hip, 
which made me limp of to his 
Rub a

Soon into battle we went, where the bullets were shooting and 
flying sure; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and neley another lay 
dying sure;

me, I 
was thinking of Judy 
made free, faith it finished 
SPoxrs:—Yes, there we stood, Murphy ezi. one side, I 
on 
the other and the Brigadier in the middle, when aJong came a 
bombshell, taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah!" 
cried Murphy. raising his hand, " We're free at last!" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand I've 
lost me hand!" Efould your gab, you black-guard, said I, 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
— Thtibout It. 
I 
went over to where he was lying. 
Are you kilt, said 
he didn't condescend to speak to me. If yen have any request 
to make, said I, if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you. 
"Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but 
murdered, and 
spachless. and if you have any regards for me, you'll be afther 
going over the field and looking for my head, place it on my 
6houlders, and see me buried dacently." 
I'll do tint same 
/laid I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last 
t 
came to it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whisky. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. I 
brought it over to him. There's your head, said 
L. " No, Paddy, that's not my head," Yes it is, said I, " No, 
it's not," said he, Well, head, or no head, said I,Divil another 
head you'll get from me 
So I 
threw his head in his face and 
I 
ran off singing

THE SPADE.. 
As originally sung by GRIFF BOWDEN. 
• 
GIVE me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighbor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORLTS.—Give me the spade, .1-c. 
Give me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak cf its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, &c. 
• 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold, 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, &c.

WHISKEY YOU'RE THE DIVIL, 
Composed and sung by the great JERRY BARRIN'GTO:Z.

NOW brave boys, we're on for marching 
Off to Portugal and Spain; 
Drums are beating, colors flying, 
Divil a

Love, farewell. 
CHORUS. 
With my real royal al da dah, with my real royal al da dab, 
My real royal addy oh, there's whiskey in the jar, 
Oh whiskey you're the divil, you've led me astray; 
Over hills and over mountains, and out of the way. 
You're stronger, sweeter, decenter, and spunkyer than tea 
Oh whiskey, you're my darling, drunk or sober. 
Say's the mother do not wrong me, 
Do not take my daughter from me, 
Por if you do, I 
will torment you, 
And after death, my ghost will haunt you. 
Love, farewell, 
With my real,&c. 
Now the drums are beating boldly, 
Men are dying, hot and coldly; 
Give every man his flask of powder, 
And his firelock on his shoulder, 
Love, farewell. 
With my real. &c.

THE DUBLIN DANCING MASTER. 
Sung by Master BARNEY. 
IN Dublin city once there lived, 
A 
craythur gay an' hearty, oh! 
A 
dancin' master he by thrade, 
His name was Teddy M'Carthy, oh! 
He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Dancin' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle! hands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh, 
In an' out and round about 
The Dublin Dancin' masther, oh I 
F3e0REN.—Mr. M' Carthy, allow me to inthroduce to yer notice, 
Mr. Cornelius Fitzpelthers Fitzfoozie O'Shaughnessy, a 
new pu-
pil. 
Ocli, how do you do, sir, you're a 
pupill've had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you, sir, you could not put 
yourself in better hands for the practice of your feet. 
This is 
something of your style of dancin' I 
presume sir? ( Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
Ah, sir, I'm afeard you'll nivir make a 
dancer; your 
'egs are not fellows; however, I'll see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies. 
Patsey Whelan, Mickey Flynn, 
And a 
boy called Kit McAsthor. 
Kern to learn a 
Highland fling 
From the Dublin dancin' masthcr. 
Down the middle, &e., 
101 
SPoSEN.—Wilkim p,•!Mlemin, to my academy. 
Allow me to 
inthroduce yes to your partners. Ahem! Misther Flynn—Miss 
Biddy Sawdust; Mister Kit McAsthor—Miss Julia Toothpic; 
a 
Mr. Patsey Whelan—Miss Honoria Wheelbarrow. Now, leedies 
and gintlemin, plase to teek yer placps for a 
Scotch reel. (Dance. 
Highland fling.) 
• 
• 
Thus Teddy got the boys and girls, 
Proficient in their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches, 
Mazourkas, reels and lancers, 
No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could go it faster, 
And none could dance an Irish jig, 
Like the Dublin dancin' masther. 
Down the middle, Jce. 
SPOKEN.— Now leedies and gintlemin, teek your places for the 
next dance; you see how fine you're gettin on. 
Our family 
were always celebrated fortheir dancin' propinsities; my young-
est son, although not as old as his eldest brother, could dance a 
jig before he was able to walk; and now for the next dance. 
(Dances Irish Jig.) 
End with Chorus.—Down the middle.

I'M A 
DAD, DAD, DAD. 
Sung with great success by Eddie Norwood. 
rD been married nearly twenty years and ne'er a 
chick nor 
child 
Had crowned my joy, folks made remarks that often made me 
wild, 
Aye what they've said and how they've looked, oft drove me 
to despair, 
But something happened the other day that made the neigh-
bors stare. 
CHORUS. 
My wife, my darling joy, she's got a 
little boy, 
I 
feel so very proud I 
could go mad, mad, mad. 
The neighbors say its clever and its better late than never, 
I 
feel so very glad now I'm a 
dad, dad, dad. 
When I 
call upon my married friends each one I 
surely 
found, 
Had lots of little images a 
playing all around, 
And every time I 
chance to meet my old chum Peter Gray, 
He'd say why Brown you've not yet one and I've got seven 
teen. 
My wife, &c. 
To behold the little stranger there's been quite an anxious 
crowd, 
They say now I'm a 
father and should really feel quite proud, 
•

And so I 
do, and oft with joy, I 
feel as though I'd burst, 
When I 
hear them compliment me on the beauties of our first. 
My wife, &e. 
Egad, I'm excited, every now and then I 
feels 
As though I 
scarce know whether I'm on my head or on my 
heels; 
Of course we'll give a 
party soon, aye a 
jolly grand affair, 
In honor of the birth of this my infant son and heir. 
SPos.Ex.— It's really a 
wonderful child, though rather late, 
and I 
can't do anything but run up and down the stairs sing-
ing—

PARODY ON " FATHER COME HOME." 
Written by E. D. GOODING. 
Oh Father, dear Father, pedestrianize with me to our domicile, 
The clock in the belfry of the neighboring court-house has just 
pealed out the hoar of one. 
You emphatically promised, my aged parent, to return at once 
from the flash factory, 
As soon as you had earned the regular sustenance required to 
sustain the family gang assembled here. 
The fire disappeared just after you did, and kerosene oil is all 
played; 
And the old dame has been anxious since she dished up the 
codfish balls. 
And that little snoozer Benjamin has been squealing for more 
paregoric, 
And there's no one to render any assistance but my royal nibs. 
CHORUS. 
Come home, sherry your nibs, oh daddy, oh head of the family. 
Exercise your pedal extremities towards the attic for which we 
pay the rent. 
Oh, author of my being continue your meandering with me to 
the place of our present residence, 
For that mammoth time-piece with the aid of bell metal has 
just belched out two, 
The shanty is colder than any skating rink, and fat Benjamin 
has got the jim-jams. 
And he has expressed a 
desire to behold his aged parent as 
soon as convenient. 
I'm sure he's got the delirium triangles, and mother says he's 
going to peg out, 
And that before the bright Aurora again gilds the eastern horizon. 
And this is the verbal communication she wished me to convey 
to the author of her misfortunes. 
Oh daddy, turn your back on the door, and greet my mother 
with your detestable presence. 
CHORUS. 
Proceed thitherward, come to your roost, please pan., 
dear papy. 
On my beaded knees I 
implore kind Providence:to aid you to 
reach your domicile. 
Oh Father. you old snoozer, can't you leave this lot of bummers 
and come with me to our tenement. 
That monitor that calls the eight hour men to their labor in 
the morning has just sung out three. 
The house is as lonesome as a 
Quaker meeting, the hours as 
long as the Presidential message, 
For the old woman with tears running down her cheeks ( since 
she eat the onions) and your humble servant. 
Yes we are in complete solitude, and that Benjamin has handed 
in his cheeks, 
And gone with that gang of little Ariel flutterers with wings on 
their shoulder 
And this was the last remark escaped his lips ere he fell over-
board, 
I 
want to kiss the old man and smell his breath once more be-
fore I'm folded in the embrace of Morpheus. 
11-,1in"iapIprNi 
110 
CHORUS. 
Come home, join your disconsolate family, oh Father, dear 
Father, 
They've tumbled to your racket and nobody will throw a 
ball 
in you, so you'd better come home. 
LAST CHORUS, 
Hear the dulcet silver toned warblings of your precious kid, 
As they float on the breeze, and echo anSwers from the other 
side of the alley way. 
Oh who can resist the plaintive and touching poetical effusions 
I've fiu.ng at you, 
Old snoozer, old roustabout, if you don't go, 1'11 call the cop 
and make him put a 
head on. you.

ANY TINWARE TO MEND. 
Composed and Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Ant.—Down Among the Coals. 
GOOD people all give ear to me, I'll tell you who I 
am, 
And if you listen to my song I'll amuse ye if I 
can, 
I 
am a 
traveling tinker, as you can plainly see, 
Perhaps there's some one here that has a 
job for me. 
CHORUS. 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
I'm the boy can mend your pans, your pots, your kitties and 
your cans; 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
They call me roving Irish Jack the tinker. 
They told me when I 
left the old dart, it's some time now, ot 
course, 
A 
rolling stone where e'er it goes it seldom gathers moss. 
But I 
am he that's not too fast, I 
never go too soon, 
For I 
below, to Butler's club, and keep one eye on silver spoons. 
Any tinware to mend, &c. 
And if a 
pretty girl I 
meet, why the question then I 
pop, 
She is sure to bring her pots and pans the holes for me to stop. 
And if the mistress does . come down to find out what's the , 
bother, 
never fail to use on her some of the same soft solder.

I 
Am Glad to See You, Boy, 
THERE is a 
kindly greeting, we always love to hear, 
'Tis when our old friends wish us, ' Merry Christmas" once a 
year: 
But there is another greeting, I 
hear perhaps every day, 
'Tis when some old friend takes my hand, and proudly seems to 
say: 
Crtonus. 
I'm glad to see you, boy; I'm glad to see you, boy, 
I 
feel so gay, when people say, I'm glad to see you, boy, 
Perhaps too we are courting, and some blue-eyed maiden fair 
Has won our heart, how gladly then to see her we repair; 
The door is quickly opened, and there stands our little dear, 
Who greets us with a 
winning smile, and whispers in our ear; 
I'm glad to see you, boy, &c. 
The broker and the tax-eollector seldom brings us joy, 
We do not often greet them with, I'm glad to see you, boy; 
But as they one and all are here, surrounding me to-day, 
Believe me, that I 
feel quite proud whenever I 
hear you say: 
I'm glad to see you, boy, &c.

THOMAS'S MACHINE. 
YOU all have heard of sewing machines, and all no doubt 
have seen, 
There's Wheeler & Wilson's, Wilcox and Singer's machines, 
But although I 
mention all these names, its none of these I 
mean 
The one I 
call attention to is Thomas's machine. 
My wife begged me to buy her one, of course what could I 
do, 
I 
loved her, and I 
bought her one, but oh ! that act I 
rue, 
For ever since we've had such rows, and such disgraceful 
scenes, 
And all through buying one of Mr. Thomas's machines. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, if my agony you'd seen, 
You'd be sorry you invented that wonderful maohine, 
For my peace and my happiness has never been seen, 
Since ray Mary Jane began to work on a 
Thomas's ma-
chine. 
No sooner had I 
a 
thought, than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that dreadful whirring din; 
I 
gently reprimanded her, and told her, my Mary Jane, 
If I 
had that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing earn my 
bread, 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head: 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
'When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that machine. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c. 
"14, 
114 
At first I 
swore a 
little swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig, 
But it never had the least effect, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd do a 
flounce or tuck, and then she'd do a 
seam. 
A 
feeling—the reverse of love, almost akin to hate— 
At last came over me, and I 
said, my love we'll separate 
I'll take my books and papers to a 
spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Thomas's machine, 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &a. 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly, that made me go away, 
So mind you all take warning, now, by what you've heard 
and seen, 
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas's machine. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c.

GOOD-BYE-I'LL SEE YOU LATER. 
sung with great success, by TONY PAsroa. 
TO what I 
hear about the town 
I 
give my close attention; 
The sayings that I 
hear about, 
To you I 
often mention. 
How great the rage for by-words now, 
It couldn't be greater, 
But the latest one that's come out is, 
Good-bye--I'll see you later, 
Each little boy upon the street, 
Of men an imitator, 
Will holler to a 
boy he'll meet, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later. 
The other evening out I 
walked, 
My leisure time beguiling, 
When into a 
saloon I 
dropped, 
And found the boys a " smiling." 
"Come, Tony, j'in us, have a 
drink!" 
Cried one wild dissipator. 
Says I, " You'll just excuse me now, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later," 
They held me fast. 
I 
had to drink 
Till my spirits grew elator.f 
And very soon I 
staggered out, 
With " Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
A 
pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A 
glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we were bound, 
I 
thought, of course, she knew me. 
She drank so much, it really seemed 
'Twould soon intoxicate her; 
a 
11.7 
116 
Thinks I 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gets much later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon, 
A- winking at the waiter, 
Saying, " Here's a 
flat!" Says I, " Enough, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
They called on me to pay the bill, 
Which I'd no inclination, 
A 
policeman, then they soon 
To take me to the station; 
He called me, saying, "Come along, 
My swindling operator, 
And soon I'll have you in a 
cell, 
Then, good-bye—I'll see you later." 
But I 
tripped him up, and off I 
went 
As swift as any skater, 
And to the peeler hollered out, 
" 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
ought in 
I 
wandered home, and there my wife 
Commenced a 
curtain lecture, 
Says she, a 
nice hour you've come home, 
And what a 
looking picture. 
Of course I 
didn't have the heart 
To scold or irritate her, 
So says I, "Old woman, go to sleep, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
So now I'll finish up my song, 
To you I've to cater, 
And if I've gained your kind applause, 
Good•bye—I'll see you later.

Can live in luxurious rest, 
Take advice from the great Horace Greeley,

Go west, young man, go west." 
When your pocket-book locus like a

And your boarding house bill is unpaid, 
When in dread of that old washerwoman 
To get out of doors you're afraid. 
When the soles ot your shoes are transparent, 
And you long for a

About that time the advice should e

"To go west, young man, go west."

fairy, 
Shall tell you " to drop on yourself" 
And give you the shake and then marry 
A 
chap who should " be laid on the shelf," 
When you " tumble to" faro and keno, 
When policy you give a 
rest, 
Just say, " You'll be up in a 
minute," 
Then hand in your checks, and " Go West." 
I 
have heaxd, &c.

THE STAR OF BROADWAY. 
La revised and sung by HARRY Seusiutas, the London Comte. 
I 
AM one of those curious, jovial, young bricks, 
That don't care a 
jot whatever's my lot, 
I 
can toss off a 
glass, though I'm not a 
sot, 
Or a 
slave to that beverage quite, 
In society there appearance I 
keep, 
And don't indulge to much in wine, 
But at night boys, I 
roam while others do sleep, 
For in Broadway why this star does shine. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, ha, ha, 
Of Broadway, ha, ha, of Broadway, ha, ha, 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, ha, ha, 
And shine most at night my dear boys, hurrah. 
I 
drive to the race, with my four in hand, 
Like the best in the land, I 
cut it grand, 
Right down the road till I 
reach the grand stand. 
Where my place is already marked out, 
I 
draw forth my pencil, pocketbook follows suit, 
And to make a 
short book I 
begin, 
'With black legs, my boys, I 
never bet, 
But stand an honest chance for to win. 
For I 
am, &a. 
My time all I 
can the ladies annoy, 
To their perfect joy, I 
make them my toy, 
When I've naught else to do I'm sure for to find, 
A 
little mischief to do I 
declare, 
I 
can crack a 
good joke or smoke a 
segar, 
Or at billiards for a 
five, I 
will play, 
There's none can equal this Broadway star, 
So for me why you must clear the way. 
For I 
am, &a

WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE. 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
NEW by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys .n 
the street loudly roar, 
Oil, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before I 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said: I'd return it next day; 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away. 
Why didn't you say so before! 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy with joy; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
I'd sooner of girls have a 
score; 
Says I [ with a 
leer] its too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before I

MERCENARY JANE, 
or Roast Pork, Boiled Pork, 
I 
WAS at a 
first-class eating nouse, not far from Maiden 
Lane, 
I 
used to dine and gaze upon the charming waitress, Jane, 
Such eyes, such teeth, such rosy cheeks, I'd never seen 
before, 
I 
never noticed what I'd eat, until I 
paid the score. 
SPOKEN. —
And when I 
asked her what I 
owed, she'd say, 
in a 
most bewitching manner, well, let me see, what did you 
have ? there was— 
CHORUS. 
Roast pork, boiled pork, pickled eels, and treacle tart, 
Suet pudding, sheeps head, a 
glass of sherry wine, 
Steak pie, pig's feet, saveloys, and bullock's heart, 
Together with the waiter makes a 
dollar forty-nine. 
I 
gazed on her, I 
squeezed her hand, the pressure was re-
turned, 
Oh joy, to think the flame of love within her bosom burned 
I 
used to go there every day, to gaze upon my dear, 
She'd steal a 
wicked glance at me, and whisper in my ear— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, itc. 
I 
met her out at night and used to take her to the play, 
She ruined my digestion ere she named the happy day, 
I 
said, oh Jane, my pretty Jane, my pet, my turtle dove, 
Come dwell with me by rippling streams, and learn to live 
on love. 
SPOKEN.—Live on love, she said, oh not for Jane, she 
prefers something more substantial, such as— 
Roast .1/Marl' 
boiled pork, &e. 
121 
PERHAPS SHE'S ON THE RAILWAY, 
BEHOLD in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by 
woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go; 
At firet she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
A.nd taken all my furniture, wherever can she be? 
Cnonus. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so f 
air,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sea; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chaD each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon sr 
from far across the sea, 
I 
have not seen her for a 
wc, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash, 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope sh:.1.1 fall out with a 
crash; 
If on the roaz.-I 
to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may got 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
THERE'S a 
sweet little spot, away down by Cape Marl 
Sure, It's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear; 
Where the white praties blossom like illigant flovxera, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly above the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland, - 
In his hat, good Bt. Patrick used always to wear; 
The Shamrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedecked by the Shamrock of Okl Ireland. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of Shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two twins, on the bogs and the 
With a 
drop in my eye, that with joy rr.y heart fills; 
And We blessed the dear sod from a 
far distant b:ran:5, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY. 
Music of this song ean,be obtained of E. II. Ilanonia, 288 Bowery. 
AS Pat Roach and the missus from Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see; 
But says Pat as he entered there's no one, 
" 
Pay here," cried a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
" 
Pay here," cries a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
But says she " Paddy darling, alanna, 
He is here like a 
rat in a 
hole, 
Pay here, how much is it ? a 
shilling; 
A 
shilling apiece, that won't do, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two. 
Pat grumbled but paid and got seated, 
The band was beginning to play, 
He jigg'd on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say, 
"Tis yer selves that can do it, me bouchale, 
125 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all my mind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind; 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind. 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor, 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
"To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee," 
She shrieked as site saw him approach, 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me ?" 
Shouts a 
voice, " yis, me darlin, Pat Roach." 
Then up on the seat, jumped brave Paddy. 
Says he, " now you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be, tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one:— 
" 
Sit down there in front!" " what you spal peen,* 
Is it me you thus dar to addriss, 
De ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distress? 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside. 
And as 
at gasped for breath he discovered, 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore, 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
He'd come up to Dublin no more. 
SHY, SHY, DREADFULLY SHY. 
HAD I 
been a 
monk or a 
hermit that dwelt 
In a 
cave where the world could not see, 
I 
then might be quiet, collected and cool, 
But fate has not will'd it to be; 
I'm thrown on the world with its troubles and 
To avoid them I 
every day try, 
I'm nervous, fidgety, very reserved, 
In fact, I'm most awfully shy, 
I 
can't look a 
girl in the face, but I 
blush, 
For f 
feel most awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
can't pass a 
stay shop, because I'm so shy. 
Some people go to the theatre each night, 
To see actresses dress'd annme ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
Unless the footlights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view. 
To see them is stretch'd ev'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but ' tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very well, 
But I 
feel most wretchedly shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy f. 
I 
would if I 
could, but I 
can't; I'm so shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
.Nothing! and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said " yes" 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think or the future, tears came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Yes, to think of the future, tears came to my eyes, 
or I 
felt so uncommonly shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
When I 
put on the ring I

SUSAN, SUSAN, PITY MY CONFUSION. 
IT'S well to be in love with one, 
But if there should be two, 
Both sighing for your heart and hand 
What can a 
poor girl do ? 
I've one who always bothers me, 
No matter where I 
be, 
And whenever he gets a 
chance, 
Why then he says to me; 
CHORUS. 
Susan, Susan, pity my confasiqp; 
Won't you, won't you, won't you marrir 
Susan, Susan, if you still refuse one, 
I 
shall, I 
shall, I 
shall D. I. E. 
As soon as number two is gone, 
Then in comes number one; 
"My own dear girl (says he to me) 
Now tell me what I've done— 
That to my suit you will say no! 
It's cruel, upon my word; 
Now, dear Sue, say, that you'll have me, 
And give up that chap absurd." 
Susan, tee. 
Of course I 
cannot wed them both, 
But between you and Sue, 
I 
don't much care for either one, 
So I'll give up the two; 
And somewhere else I'll find a 
beam, 
Who'll have a 
different way 
Of winning little Susan's heart, 
Than saying all the day— 
Susan, ex.

That's Where You Makg the Mistake. 
SOME folks think they're awfully clever, 
That all other folks are but fools, 
Some people will often endeavor 
To make other people their tools; 
Some people will boast of their knowledge, 
And fancy they're well wide awake, 
That none are so deep or so cute as themselves. 
That's where they make the mistake. 
CHORUS. 
There's just as good fish in the sea, bear in mind, 
As those we have managed to take; 
So don't be too proud, and don't crow too loud, 
For that's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine you'll meet with a 
bobby, 
When'er there's a 
row in the street; 
Don't imagine you'll find a 
fishmonger 
Declare that his fish aro not sweet; 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could climb up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—well, what some folks call a 
cake. 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dressed as a " swell," 
A. book with a 
cover that's olden and won. 
,He..s often a 
good tale to cell. 
• 
135 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
•Tis'a wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the famly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But, talking of marriage reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake; 
They fancied Louise and her cash were for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your nallk is not " doctored," 
Yor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake; 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy its jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you make the mistake.

WAITING FOR A 
BROADWAY STAGE, 
AS up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye; 
Her little short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all the rage; 
She was looking up and down, with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh I 
CHORUS. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age; 
I 
met her on the corner; it was there that first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like'a beam, 
Just played round her face, and, with such ease and grace. 
Why, like an angel she did seem. 
But I 
kept getting like one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage; 
How I 
wished I'd never have seen that handsome little queezi 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh 
She was just, etc. 
But as the ice was broken, my hat of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, she required, soon came by; 
When she said in tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll meet 
As up the steps her little form did fly.. 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me 'twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, ohl 
She was just,

A 
gtarry Night for a 
Ramble. 
I 
LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green, 
I 
like a 
little boating 
To pull against the stream, 
But of all the games that I 
love best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
CHORUS. 
A starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flow'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble, 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans,

And others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night.

If Ever I 
Cease to Love. 
BY GEORGE LEYBOURNE. 
TN a 
house, in a 
square, in a 
quadrant, 
In a 
street, in a 
lane, in a 
road, 
Turn to the left on the right hand, 
You see there my true love's abode. 
I 
go there a 
courting and cooing, 
To my love like a 
dove, 
And swearing on my bended knee, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May sheep's heads grow on apple trees, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
CnoRtra 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May the moon be turn'd into green cheese, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
She can sing, she can play the piano, 
She can jump, she can dance, she can run, 
In fact she's a 
modern Taglioni 
And Sims Reeves rolled into one. 
And who would not love such a 
beauty 
Like an angel dropped from above, 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May little dogs wag their tails in front, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
•

139 
For all the money that's in the bank, 
For the title of a 
lord or a 
duke, 
I 
wouldn't exchange the girl I 
love, 
There's bliss in every look. 
To see her dance the polka, 
I 
could faint with radiant love, 
May the Monument a 
hornpipe dance 
If ever. I 
cease to love. 
May we never have to pay the Income Tax, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May we all turn into cats and dogs, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May all the seas turn into ink, 
May negroes all turn white, 
May the Queen in Buckingham Palace live, 
May we drink too much wino to-night. 
May cows lay eggs, my fowls yield milk, 
May the elephant turn a 
dove, 
May Bobbies refuse tc eat cold meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stuffed with sausage meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, • 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May each old maid be blessed with twine, 
If ever I 
cease to love.

COMIC VERSION , (Mollie Darling.) 
Sung by Tour PASTOR. 
WHEN I 
met you, Mollie darling, 
I 
believe ' twas after tea, 
You had on your " Dolly Varden,” 
And you completely dazzled me, 
When I 
asked you if you loved me, 
You gave my little hand a 
squoze, 
Take my greenbacks, Mollie darling, 
But don't turn up at me your nose. 
CHORUS. 
Mollie dearest, fairest, sweetest, 
Look, darling, tell me that, 
Won't you love me, Mollie darling, 
Don't despise me because I'm fat. 
When we're married, Mollie darling, 
And you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing around the house, 
When ' tis evening, Mollie darling, 
You'll put them in their little bed, 
And if they annoy you, Mollie, 
Gently put on them a 
head.

IN THE BOWERY, 
Tour PASTOR'S Great Sensational Song. 
AIR—" Piccadilly." 
[This song has been called for nightly for months in succession. hav-
ing been sung by Mr. l'Asron in his own inimitable style, and been 
received with thunders of applause. 
SOME say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind; 
On Broadway and Fifth Avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
SPOICEN.—Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, 
your Fifth Avenue swells, your exquisitely-dressed creatures, 
with their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do 
they know about enjoyment? They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for fear of disarranging their toilets: and then what 
would Mrs. Grundy say? " Charles Frederick Augustus is get-
ting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina Emelia is positively shock-
ing I" 
But here in the Bowery people enjoy themselves just 
when they feel like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
CHORUS. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
That's where I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
14-.3 
142 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned; 
Men who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, there is no place in the Bowery for those well-
dressed corner statues to try to look like millionaire's sons, while 
their mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to support 
them in idleness. 
A fellow has no business on the east 
side of town unless he wants to work and earn his own living. 
What fortune is there more honorable than that of a 
working 
man. 
There was Washington, he was a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
printer. 
Warren a 
doctor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lin-
coln a 
rail-splitter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you want to see 
men who make our country great, who add to her wealth, de-
velop her resources, maintain her strength and prosperity, you 
will always find them— 
In the Bowery, &c. 
The other day a 
well-dressed fop, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl, 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A 
young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, he laid the cowardly rascal cat. " Now," he 
says, ":git up and git, and if I 
ever catch you insulting a 
female 
again I'll add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you." 
The dandy quiatl,y sneaked away: . 
the young lady turned to he 
6 
preserver, with tears in her eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how 
can I 
ever thank you for the kindness which you have shown 
. 
me in protecting me from the insults of that ruffian and I 
hope 
sir, we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ? 
Certainly, 
young lady, I'm always found— 
In the Bowery, Ice. 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'er-spread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys. 
Sroxrx—When the call came for soldiers in the hour of dan-
ger, the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly 
did they do their duty, 
Who does not remember that ineident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a 
terrific 
fire and changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of glerious 
victory. 
This was noticed by General McClellan, who ex-
claimed; " What regiment is this?" " New York Volunteers," 
was the answer. " Where do they hail from?" Why, of °aurae 
From the Bowery, &c.

LARDY DARDY DO. 
! 
dear friends, how d'ye do? hope I 
see you all well, 
If you're game now, my dodge I'll just explain, 
And I 
think you'll agree, when once you've hard what it is, 
That it's simply no loss—hut all gain; 
Don't you see, short of tin and all that sort of thing, 
Very awkward for one it is true, 
But I 
find that the needful is quite amply supplied, 
By what I 
call my Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, dear friends, it's the lardy dardy do—very 
prevalent just now—and allow me to call your attention to the 
fact, that 
CHORUS. 
I'm the lardy dardy swell, 
And I 
don't mind tellingott, 
That the only income I 
possess, 
Is my lardy dardy do. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy now for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be had, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, never asking the price, 
For such meanness ' twould truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardy dardy is no coin of the realm, 
Tho' I 
find it always seems with me to go. 
SPOREN.—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be 
'iondered at, for you see— 
I'm the lardy, itc. 
145 
With our fair sex my Lardy dardy do is the go, 
And it seems the sweet darlings to impress, 
I've already' the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been " yes !" . 
But the worldly Papas, and their cautious Mammas, 
When their daughter's affections I 
woo, 
Always say, when I 
tell them upon what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—Which is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
still the dear girls would gladly share my fate, although 
I'm the lardy, &e.

PUT BY FOR A 
RAINY DAY. 
OFTTIMES the world may laugh and jeer at what Pr; going to 
to say, 
'That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy day; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, Ids hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and likelme, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire: 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, &c. 
' 
Waste not, want not," my motto is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe: "Touch nothing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
t 
147 
I'm hale, I'm Jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my Mends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found was my pocket, after 
all; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin I 
say 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
"A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when you're 
poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the door; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is—put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c.

DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA, 
As sung by John Nolan, the pleasing tenor. 
OH! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time: 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
Is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
.Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, itc. 
Oh I 
the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossonas 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is fall of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, 4te.

ON BOARD OF THE KANGAROO, 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
ONCE I 
was a 
waterman, and liv'd at home in ease; 
Now I 
am a 
mariner, and plough the angry seas. 
I 
thought I'd like seafaring life, so bid my love " adoo," 
And shipp'd as cook and steward, boys, on board o' the Kan-
garoo. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never thought she would be false, or ever prove untrue, • 
When we Baird away from Milford Bay on board o' the Kan-
garoo. 
My love she was no foolish girl, her age it was two score; 
My love she was not a " spnister," she'd been married twice 
before; 
And they could not say it was her wealth that stole my heart 
away, 
She was starcher at a 
laundress's for eighteen-pence a 
day. 
I 
never thought, &c. 
" 
Oh, think of me! oh, think of me!" she mournfully did say, 
" 
When you are in a 
furrin' land, carousin' far away; 
And take this lucky thrup'ny bit, 'twill make you bear in mind 
The loving, faithful, trusting heart, you leave in tears behind.'

say good-bye. 
" 
I 
shan't be gone so very long, only months a 
few, 
And when I 
does come back again, in course I'll marry you," 
I 
never thought, &c. 
Our vessel it was homeward bound from many a 
furrin' shore, 
And many a 
furrin' present unto my love I 
bore. 
There was tortoises from Teneriffe, and toys from Timbuctoo; 
A Chinese rat, and Bengal cat, and a 
Bombay cockatoo. 
I 
never thought, & c. 
Paid off, I 
sought her dwelling in the suburbs of the town, 
A 
hancient dame upon a 
line was hanging out a 
gown, 
"Where is my love?" " She's married, sir, about six months 
ago, 
To a 
smart young man that drives a 
van for Chaplin, Horne, Ss 
Co." 
I 
never thought, & e.

Farewell to dreams of married life, to soap, to suds, and blue, 
Gleufield starch, and Harper Twelve-trees' washing powder too; 
I'll seek some far and distant clime, I

And on some Chinese Hotting-tot I'll throw myself away.

There's mistake in a 
gainsaying, 
In love affairs some funny tricks, 
Ladies always will be pNying. 
The girl I 
loved she was div'ne, 
Her patience tired, I 
had to route it, 
When I 
resolved to make her wine 
She said, you must be quick about it. 
CHORUS. 
So gentlemen take my advice, 
Or lovers sharp will make sou route it, 
Pop the question in a 
trice, 
Don't delay, be quick about. it. 
The first time I 
beheld Miss Prout, 
With her beauty I 
was smitten, 
She could waltz, and polka too, 
Active, lively as a 
kitten. 
One night whilst waltzing to her said 
In a

She was at her own disposal. 
I 
then asked her consent,

So gentlemen, dm

As blithe as blithe can be; 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They are all the same to me; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways; 
For where the dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground. 
How little do the great ones care— 
Who sit at home secure— 
What hidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial collier's lives. 
Down in coal mine, &o. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can; 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man;

However fortune turns about, 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals ? 
• 
Down in coal mine, ez,c. 
My hands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein; 
And, like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and. plain; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say— 
'.is not the collier' heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, tte. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait 
And watch for my return; 
For death, that levels all alike, 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and damp may strike, 
And fling his darts at me. 
Down in a

That's the place to pick and choose,

And gay young swells with none at all, 
Upon that Grand Parade.

OLD GRIMES' CELLAR DOOR. 
HOW oft we talk of childhood joys, 
Or tricks we used to play, 
While playing hookey from the school,' 
All the livelong day. 
And oh I 
my eyes how I 
have longed, 
For those bright days of yore, 
When Sally Brown and I 
slid down 
Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I 
would give all my greenbacks, 
For those bright days of yore, 
When Sally Brown and I 
slid down 
Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
Some boys would stealing apples go, 
While others used to stray; 
Down on the docks where sugar casks, 
In rows together lay; 
But Sal and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us of yore; 
And side by side together slide 
Down Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
! 
I 
would, dm. 
But alas a 
change came o'er the scene, 
When poor old Grimesy died; 
His son removed the cellar door, 
On which we used to slide. _ 
Our mothers they were glad of it, 
For our pantaloons we tore; 
They had to be half-soled and heeled, 
From sliding on the door. 
Oh! I 
would, Jr.c. 
One day the old man fell asleep, 
Upon his cellar door; 
The boys all came to take a 
peep, 
And hear him loudly snore; 
They tickled his nose with feather and straw 
And laughed till their sides were sore, 
The old man awoke with a 
loud haw! haw 
And slid down on his own cellar door. 
Oh! I 
would, Ice.

Funny Old Gal,

But they may all laugh and chaff at my pate, 
I'm a 
funny old gal from old Ca'lina State.

Then all of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing and don't be too late, 
For this funny old gal from South Celina State. 
T'other, day, while walking in the street, 
Some naughty little boy say, " how's your poor feet!" 
I 
hit him with my cane and then we had a 
tussle, 
And I 
found all the sawdust coming out of my bustle. 
Then all of you sing, etc. 
Oh I 
I've been married many a

Of husbands I

I

But none of them ever done much for me.

DOVITN IN A DIVING DELL. 
As sting by Gus Wrntersts in his Parlor Entertainnsents,, 
Once I 
was a 
sailor bold, 
Some tales to you I'll tell 
Of all the wonders I 
have seen, 
When in a 
diving bell. 
While on the ocean, messmates, 
For many challenged me, 
I'd not the pluck to go and see 
The mermaids. in the sea. 
cSORI78. 
Down in a 
diving bell, at the bottom of the set, 
That's a 
pretty place, the fishy sights to see; 
Down in a 
diving bell, at the bottom of the sea, 
like little mermaids, pretty little mermaids, all came ceertiag 
me, 
Whan I 
was only half way down, 
Mermaids came to me, 
They sang and danced to welcome me, 
Far down in the sea; 
They came in hundreds to shake hands, 
So many turned me pale; 
For a 
very funny thing that all mermaids 
Should shake hands with their tail. \

DOWN IN A DIVING BELL.—Concluded., 
When I 
reached the bottom, there I 
saw 
A 
thing to make me laugh ; 
They'd made a 
clothes line out of the 
Atlantic Telegraph; 
And old mermaids disclosed to me, 
With salt tears in each eye, 
Although 'twas under water, 
'Twas very bad weather to dry. 
Down in a 
diving, etc. 
I 
caught a 
pretty mermaid, 
To kiss her was my wish, 
But like an eel she slipped away, 
For you can't hold on to fish. 
Her mother brought her bauk again, 
And whispered unto me 
That if I 
liked down there I 
might 
Get married in the sea. 
Down in a 
diving, etc. 
We married were, at a 
funny church, 
That was built of oyster shells, 
The parson wore a 
bathing dress, 
A 
cod-fish rung the bells. 
I'm married now and happy, 
You girls are in the shade, 
You can't compare to mine so fair, 
Although she's a 
mermaid.

CASTLES IN THE ALB,. 
This world is but a 
bubble, there's nothing here but woe, 
Hardship, toil and trouble, no matter where we go; 
Do what we will, go where we may, we're never free fedge 
care; 
For, at the best, this world is but a 
castle in the air. 
We are tossed upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
Where some get cast upon the rocks, and never get afloat ; 
But still we'll do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us and our castles in the air 
There's a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen most 
dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native bard, 
Shakespeare; 
When first his plays came on the stage, they made the whole 
world stare, 
And yet they were composed while building castles in the air. 
If you take the words of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find each saying is so wise, each sentiment so true— 
They make you feel, while reading them, as if you had been 
there; 
Yet, the immortal Shakespeare built his castles in the air I 
The Irish had their poet, too; they loved him well, I'm sure; 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
le6 
CASTLES IN THE AIR.—Conoluded. 
Of the troubles of this world, we know he had his share, 
But Moore was always happy, building castles in the air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many a 
patient heart still cherishes his songs; 
Ile bade the Irish heart rejoice, and never more despair, 
And for Ireland in the future built bright castles in the air 
And yet them is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And through each true Scottish heart 'twill make the blood te 
thrill; 
His name was Robert Burns: yet he, too, had his care, 
When but a 
simple shepherd, building castles in the air. 
His home, a 
lowly ploughman's cot, where strife was neTer 
seen; 
For happy and contented lived Robert with his Jean; 
Down by the banks o' bonny Doon, near the town o' Ayr, 
Nature's poet, Bobby Burns, built castles in the air I 
And yet there is another name Americans adore, 
A 
statesman in the time of peace, a 
lion when in war; 
With the storm on Bunker Hill, or on the Delaware, 
His genius made his soldiers build bright castles in the air. 
And, in his country's darkest hour, he bravely lead the van, 
And strived to make America the best of any land; 
Tho' he was not a 
poet born—he planned with skill endear.,

That you love none else but me? 
For I

You are all the world to me. 
Ohl tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
CHORUS. 
fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up, darling, tell me this: 
Do you love me, Mollie darling ? 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Through the mystic veil of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light; 
Oh! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, Jr.4

must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Though the parting gives me pain) 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling,

SPEAK OUT LIKE A 
MAN, 
lung with the greatest success by JENsuz 
NGEL. 
THOUGH you gentlemen are smiling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin, 
Fair lady, as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting, 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense, 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a 
pretence. 
/f to wring your ears we threatex 
We, of course, mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, dize. 
Now you gentlemen attention, 
If you'd happy be for life, 
Don't live in single wretchedness, 
But quickly take a 
wife. 
There's a 
funny man sitting there, , 
Like one upon the shelf, 
a To set you an example, 
I'll make love to him myself. 
Then don't be shy, &c.

Sung by JENNIE RIIGIEES. 
OH ! a 
jolly old Cockle am I, 
And a 
merry life I 
lead. 
Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea-weed, 
Under the green sea- weed. 
Under the briny wave,

Over the'slimy sand, 
Where the silver waters lave 
The shell on the pebbly strand, 
On I 
whirl, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously, 
On through the waters joyously. 
Oh I

jolly old Cockle am I, 
And a 
glorious life I 
lead, 
Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea-weed, 
On I 
whirl a

On thro' the waters joyously. 
A 
respectable black is my garb, 
Turn'd up with a 
white cravat 
And pilgrims long as they tell in song,

Have borrow'd my shape for a 
hat, 
Have borrow'd my shape for a 
hat. 
Whirl, and wind, and wriggle. 
Where ocean spirits roam, 
The Fisherman's net will only get 
The Cockle away from his home, 
On I 
whirl, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously. 
On thro' the waters joyously. 
Oh, a

And a 
glorious life I

Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea-weed, 
On I

cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
'Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining 'how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Everting Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher Bc 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitata to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentiemen readers.

he was heretofore entirely ignorant. No book like it has ever betoro 
been written; and, although some prudish persons may deem the 
" 
mysteries of sparking" too occult and dark a 
subject to be shown up 
in the fall glare of day, yet, after perusing this work, they will unani-
mously say " Well done,' to the dating author. 
No man should think of Courting, much less Marrying, until he has 
carefully studied every line of this remarkable work. No one who has 
studied this book and follows its directions will ever be cursed by wed-
ding a 
false, dissolute, shiftless, ill-tempered, ugly woman.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HIINPTY DIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It 18 a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by an 
the Professors of Magic. 
•••••••/•••••••••••W•~040.1. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgio order 
has been sent us, called ' Iluarin7 DUMMY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
White presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his te,sselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in_tlie hand.4
