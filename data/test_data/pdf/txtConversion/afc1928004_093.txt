GUS WILLIAMS' 
"LOVE AKONG BIG NOSES" 
SONGSTER. 
Containing a 
Choice Selection of all the new 
Comic, Serio-Comic, Local, Eccentric, Original 
and Characteristic Songs, 
As Sung, with Immense _Applause, by the Inimitable Comic-
Character-Vocalist and Mimic, 
GUS WILITANS Tab GREAT AMERICAN STAR COMIQTJE. 
The subject of this sketch, M R. GUS W ILT.IAMS, was born July 19th, 
1845, in the City of New-York, of Irish parentage, and first made his 
debut May, 15th, 1856, at Sandy Point, Long Island, with 'Holland's Dra-
matic Troupe, under the name of " Master Sandhrook, the Child Won-
der," traveled West and South, with the above named troupe for three 
years, and then joined Crook's Combination, and remained: with them 
until July 1861, and then joined Ashton's Dramatic and Variety Com-
pany, left them at Huntsville, Alabama, in 1865, and joined Mrs. 
Post's Combination, at Pulaski, Tennessee; since then im has been 
traveling through the country with Fred. Rouses' Combination, IIazeFs 
Variety Troupe, & c., & c., and finally made his appearance as a 
conic 
character vocalist, and mimic, November 9th. 1868, at Tony Pastor's 
Opera House, New York City, under the name of" Gus Williams ;" since 
then he has sung in most all the different Variety Theatres through-
out the United States, receiving everywhere the highest enconit.rre 
of the Press and and Public, and to-day stands A, 1., as a 
Comic Char-
acter Vocalist and Mimic; his songs are fresh, sprightly and pungent, 
without being coarse or indelicate, and his adaption of voice, facial ex-
pression and style to the various phases of the characters assumed by 
him, is both striking and natural. 
Mr. Williams is the author of most 
of the songs that he sings, among which may be found the following 
popular sorgs of the day; namely: " Keiser, don't You vant to bny a 
Dorg 1" " Up in that Back Room," " Jersey Sam," etc., etc. 
Young in 
years and professional experience, his remarkable ability, with a 
strict 
attention to business, will secure him an enviable fame, and he may 
truly be styled— The Great American Star Comique. 
J. P. 
,Every Song in this Book is Sung by Gus Williams.

THE NEW VELOCIPEDE SONG. 
As Sung in SINBAD by Miss LYDIA Tuomrsox. 
Some like to ride the Iron horse, 
And sonic within a 
hack; 
And other fellows dearly love, 
A 
pacing horse to back. 
And then again some like to call, 
The foamin12; wave their steed; 
But give me that two forty nag, 
The new velocipede. 
CHORUS. 
It never runs away, and it don't take much to feed 
It's thoroughly reliable, the new velocipede; 
Upon the way you work your legs and feet, depends its speed, 
And that's about the total of the new velocipede I 
There's one thing I 
must tell to you, 
If you'd not make a 
fluke, 
If a 
pretty trirl is on the roal, 
Be careful how you look I 
It's all the worse if it should be, 
An avenue up town. 
For suddenly your two-wheerd horse, 
Is likely to lie down! [ It never runs, &c. 
ACT ON THE SQUARE, BOYS. 
By ALFRED LEE. 
Author of " Champagne Charlie." 
[The mutsie of this piece, arranaed for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt' s 
Half Dime Series of Choice Music. 
For sale 
by It. M. De Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price five cents.] 
Through being fond of acting right, 
Straightforward, just and fair 
I 
try to make my troubles ligh 
And little do I 
care; 
As happy as a 
king I 
live 
On just what I 
can spare, 
And from experience I 
give 
This hint, act on the square 
CHORUS. 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square; 
Upright and fair, boys, act on the square; 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square, 
Upright and fair, boys, act on the square. 
Now in the street a 
thing so bad, 
Which often is the case, 
A 
swellish, foolish looking lad 
Some modest girl will chase; 
Then, square you round, and let him see 
If he annoyance dare, 
You'll give him striking proof to show 
Now to act on the square. 
Act on the square, boys, ctc. 
When out one night with noisy swells, 
Th' Haymarket kept alive, 
One Sergeant X with oyster shells 
To pelt they did contrive ; 
They nearly got into disgrace, 
But squaring served them there, 
And brightly shone the Bobby's face, 
Who liked to see things square. 
• 
Act on the square, boys, &O. 
I 
never liked a 
round game, nay, 
Round tables can't a-bear; 
And in a 
circus I 
can't stay, 
So I 
live in a 
square ; 
Now brothers all, and masons too, 
Of goo.i lets do our share, 
And when a 
chance presents itself 
We must act on the square. 
Act on the square, boys, drc.

you see that I'm the ladies' pet, 
To please is my delight; 
No butter-fly you ever met 
Is half so gay a 
sight! 
kidded and curled just to a 
hair, 
I 
take the " Springs" by storm; 
And all the pretty creatures stare 
On this " distingue” form. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the Sarato ,ra beau, 
I 
would have you all to know, 
And I'm quitethe fashion ; 
I 
fascinate the girls, 
Adore the lovely curls— 
I'm the boy to bet your cash on. ' 
I've traveled somewhat in my time, 
And lived a 
stylish life, 
I 
think it must be quite sublime 
To win a 
lovely wife; 
Brunettes and Blondes, I've charmed them all— 
Dear eyes, both black and blue !• 
I 
love the short, I 
love the tall— 
So what's a 
chap to do ? 
I'm the Saratoga, &c. 
" 
Mammas" they trot their daughters out. 
They think I've got the tin; 
The little dears they smile and pout 
The handsome " catch" to win; 
Single and gay I 
mean to be, 
In shining boots and. " tile," 
No marriage " bonds" will do for me, 
" 
Five twenties are my style! 
I'm the Saratoga, &c. 
I 
drive the fastest nags in town, 
A 
splendid tandem team; 
And as for " dimes" I'm up and clown— 
You see my style's the " cream 1" 
Dancing and fun are in my way, 
The tailor is my friend; 
Dame Fortune may be sad or gay, 
I'll 1ocket all she'll send!

BEAR IT LIKE A MAN. 
Words and music by HARRY CLI,TON• 
I 
gaily sing from day to day, 
A careless man am I. 
As long as I 
can pay my way, 
Misfortune 1 
defy. 
And then with spirits ever gay, 
I 
do the best I 
can, 
When trouble comes upon my way, 
To bear it like a 
man. 
CHORUS. 
I 
gaily sing from day to day, 
And do the best I 
can, 
When trouble conies upon my way, 
To bear it like a 
man. 
We're told that since the world began, 
(That's many years ago,) 
If money did not " make the man" 
It " made the mare to go." 
Of comforts I 
have quite enough, 
Although my wealth is small, 
I 
know that I 
am better off, 
Than folks with none at all. 
If fortune on a 
friend cloth shine, 
I 
love him none the less, 
I 
ii 
ever grieve, I 
never pine, 
For wealth I 
don't possess 
A happy home, a 
loving wife, 
Of worldy goods a 
store, 
Contented with my lot in life, 
A king can be no more. 
I 
gaily sing, &c. 
I 
gaily sing, &c. 
And one thino. too, I 
bold it good, 
Wherever I 
may be, 
" 
To do ro others as I 
would, 
That they should do to me:" 
This world would ne,'er be dark and drear, 
If each would try the plan, 
Of giving when they had to spare, 
To help their fellow nian.

DE TURTLE DOVES OF ROCKAVAY.

song, it vill not dake me long, 
Und of you viii but listen to mine lay. 
'Tis not apout Long Pranch, or apout Captain Jinks, 
But apout a 
gal I 
met at Rockavay; 
'Tis (lore I 
sornedimes go, und alvays see mine beau, 
Sweet Katerina, yah, 
dat is her name, 
She calls me her dear, und she can tdrink lager beer, 
In such a 
way dat I 
must say she's game. 
ClIORITS. 
Und dat she loves her Johnny Lantern's lager, 
Is somedings vat I 
often heard her say, 
Und yen we do valk outer, de beoples bawls and shout'rs, 
Dere goes de Turtle Doves of Rockaway. 
She's got a 
splendid mout for eading sauerkrout, 
Und hash a 
nose yust like a 
veader vane, 
She ploes it at de nort-east boint, vich chucks it out of joint, 
But den yer know she fixes it again; 
She dresses up in style, for her fader owns a 
pile, 
He own a 
cow, und a 
calf, I 
may say, 
Some folks dun like her much, pecause she was so Dutch, 
But she can lick any gal at Rockavay. 
Und chit she loves, dac 
Ve will pe marret soon, und we'll have a

For I

I've pought her a

pig ship,

THE DIAMOND TAKE THE HEART. 
Am:—" Wearing of the Green." 
Kind friends I 
come to sing a 
song of what I 
do not know, 
Unless it is of what you've seen in the news some days ago; 
If there's some that have not seen it, and studied well its part, 
1 
now tell them its title is—" The diamond takes the heart." 
You'll find it so in every place, whether you're good or bad, 
No matter if you're homely, if you but own a 
nag ; 
And have plenty of money, why strangers will take your part, 
And say you're a 
good fellow, for the diamond takes the heart. 
 ath 
You may be a 
noted vagabond, and have just knocked off the link, 
In a 
minute you're an honest man, if you but show the chink; 
And if a 
courting you should go, and cupid sends his dart, 
Though bad you be, if you've money, you're sure to win her heart: 
Mind I 
do not say in every case, that this is sure to pass; 
But nine-tenths I 
know will have you for your money in a 
mass. 
She'll not have you if you've on poor clothes, no matter if you're 
smart, 
Put a 
good rig on, she'll die for you—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now when a 
man gets about forty, young girls will laugh at him 
And say he's an old fogy, and but a 
played out limb. 
They'll make all sorts of fun of him, and if he should propose, 
We may expect to hear the young girl say, " old man go wipe 
your nose." 
If his mouth does stretch from ear to ear, or if a 
byword be his 
name; 
Or if he has no principle, or is broken down and lame; 
Or if he's forced to wear a 
wig, or on his nose there'd be a 
wart: 
Yet if he's rich, why she'll have him—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now I 
think I've proven in my song, all what I've .said is true: 
-Yet still 
hope and pray, it may never happen to you. 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat, 
You'll find an honest heart beneath, and staunch as a 
life-boat. 
Then if you are a 
young girl, love him because he's poor ; 
He may be rich one of these days, then can you wish for more 2 
Or if a 
young man you may be, then take her, do not start, 
Altho' she's poor, let it ne'er be said, that the diamond took tha 
heart.

DER COBBLER'S DAUGHTER. 
-In Baxter street, not long ago, 
Dere lived a 
cobbler's daughter; 
But now he don't live there some, 
Cos she's moved mit anoder quarter; 
Her father soled boots and also shoes, 
And put heels on them all for a 
quarter. 
Dem loafer fellows all used ti; spark 
On dat little cobbler's daughter, 
CHORUS. 
But I 
lofed her and she alvays vas 
So loving and so shmilling, 
But they caught her picking pockets 
On a 
Broadway stage, 
And sent her to Blackwell's Island. 
I 
took dat gal out for a 
ride 
In a 
stage we went up B;oatway; 
She sat down by a 
lady's side, 
Dat lady soon got uneasy; 
In a-liddle vhile, 
She turned around to my gal, 
And caught her hands vere she oughtenter, 
She schreamed right out, 
"Mv pocket-book's gone, 
it's stolen mit that cobbler,s daughter." 
But I 
lofed her, &c. 
Der police came and arrested dat gal; 
Six months she got for her pocket-picking. 
Shudge Dowling said I 
vas her pal, 
Dat I 
deserved a 
licking. 
In a 
Black Maria they escorted her, 
To der Island across der vater, 
Dey set her making shoes mit very sharp toes, 
Dat innocent cobbler's daughter. 
But I 
lofed her, &c. 
Now yen my lore she does come down, 
I'll tcld you vot I'll do, 
I'll make a 
big party mit my house, 
And invite efery one of you. 
You can dance der whole night long, 
Go home mit your gals in der morning, 
Und drink our lager after twelve at night 
Der exercise ve'll be scheming. 
But I 
lofed her, &c.

FASHIONABLE FRED. 
Of me you may have read, I'm Fashionable Fred, 
And no matter where I 
chance to show my face, 
I'm looked oh as the cheese, and all the girls I 
plea, 
I'm a 
model swell of elegance and grace. 
Wire in and go a-bead, then 'or Fashionable Fred ! 
Pit-pat's the way, and sh,.Fi, about the word; 
Give me sufficient cash, th• 
see me cut a 
dash, 
For, whatever's slow 
my idea's absurd. 
CVGIMS. 
Yes, I'm just about the -.31.t for Broadway, 
To keep the proper pace, I know the plan, 
Wire in and go a-head, then, for Fashionable Fred 
I'm Fashionable Fred, the ladies' man. 
My life, from first to last, has beer jolly, gay and fast, 
In fact, to find a 
faster, you'd be teased. 
In everything Um quick, the Yankees call it " slick," 
I'm something like a 
flash of lightning greased. 
Yet, in any running ground, I'm game, you may be bound, 
To give a 
flash of lightning ten yards start, 
I'd run for twenty pounds, and, ere we'd been twice round, 
I'd pass it like a 
bullet or a 
dart. 
For I'm just about, &c. 
This is the age for dash, and all must come out flash; 
If in this world they try to make their way. 
If you wear a 
seedy dress, you'll find to your distress, 
All your friends will quickly turn their heads away. 
Though I'm not worth a 
groat, I 
wear a 
decent coat, 
And rattle on, and keep on going a-head; 
And all the world you see, will fraternize x•.ith me, 
And soon pall in with Fashionable Fred. 
• 
For, I'm just about, (h. 
Though in the Park I 
walk, and with the ladies talk, 
My tailors' bills I 
always like to run; 
I 
canter in the Aventb-, and when to balls I 
go: 
I 
gallop with the charming girls, like fun. 
With the times I 
keep a 
pace, and with them run a 
race, 
Still of them I 
am always found a-head; 
Pm ready for a 
lark, no matter light or dark, 
Up to any game is Fashionable Fred. 
For, I'm just about, &a.

FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. 
I've wandered through the village, Tom, and was singing 
merrily, 
When I 
was arrested and brought to the jail that oft sheltered 
you and me; 
But none were there to bail me out, at least they told me so, 
For I 
wasn't acquainted with the judge, like fifteen years ago. 
The boys are at the same old game of stealing coffee and tea: 
They stole a 
ham the other night, you've done it oft with me; 
They're gambling still for money, Tom, at that ,baby game, 
keno, 
That dear old game we loved so well some fifteen years ago. 
And the old jail is alteercl some, 'tis larger now than then, 
The cells they are much wider, Tom, to accommodate gentlemen.. 
But the bell is there that rang out when to the Island we 
must go, 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom, as Isms fifteen years ago. 
The river is running just as still, the willows on its sitae 
Fell over on a 
man, dear Tom, and yesterday he died; 
The grapevine, too, is ruined Tom, where we had fun, 
In hanging up poor Kaiser's dog some fifteen years ago.

What does little birdie say, 
In her nest at peep of day ? 
Let me fly, says little birdie, 
Mother! let me fly away. 
Birdie, rest a 
little longer, 
Till the little wings tire stronger, are stronger, 
kS.o she rests a 
little longer, 
Then she flew away. 
What does little baby say, 
In her bed at break of day? 
Baby says, like little birdie, 
Let me rise and fly away. 
Baby sleep a 
little longer, 
Till the little limbs are stronger;, 
If she sleeps a 
little longer, 
Baby too shall fly away. 
THE GRECIAN BEND. 
Kind friends I 
am here to sing to you a 
ditty, 
And if you will but to me your ear lend. 
I'll speak about the fashions in the city, 
The last of which is called The Grecian Bend; 
The ladies are the persons who have got it, 
And lately it seems to be all the rage, 
They bend over, for that seems to be the great hit, 
But to me it looks as if it were old age. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, 
How foolishly the money they do spend, 
I'll bet my all I 
never will get married 
As long as the women have the Grecian Bend. 
The other day I 
thought of getting married 
To a 
darling little creature over the way; 
One afternoon at her door I 
tarried, 
To the key-hole I 
chanced to put my eye; 
Her wax nose she laid near the shutter, 
Her false teeth she was trying to mend, 
She'd a 
glass eye, but that I 
did'nt care for, 
But I 
left her when I 
saw the Grecian Bend. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, dm. 
When shall our stylish folks get common reason, 
I 
really think the leaders must be mad, 
For waterfalls and long trails were a 
blessing 
To this which is the worst that could be had: 
they'd only introduce it in the army, 
What a 
comfort to the soldiers they would send, 
ror they could carry crackers there when it was stormy. 
Oh, I 
wish that old Nick had the Grecian Bend. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, &c.

liOW ARE YOU OFF FOR STAMPS P 
New by-words now are all the go, 
From ev'rybudy's mouth they now; 
You'll hear tueui in the house, or out, 
They're even in the baby's mouth ; 
You'll hear them spoke by old and young, 
in fact they're told by every tongue. 
But the latest one that's out they say, 
Is " How are you off for stamps to days" 
If you go out walking in the street, 
Some friend of yours you're sure to meet, 
Hell shako your hand and at you wink, 
He'll say, " 01(1 Friend, let's take a 
dri 
You can't refuse a 
glass of beer, 
With a 
friend A
.ou've not seen for a 
y 
You drink, and next you hear him say, 
"How are you off for stamps to-day 1' 
The ladies all have heard it too, 
They never let anything pass that's new; 
And once the word is in their ninth, 
No power can stop its coining out ; 
shy all around with a 
smiling face, 
And put on their queenly grace ; 
" 
What a 
pleasant day tor a 
ride," they'll say 
"How are you off for stamps, to-day ff' 
Now, if perchance you've got a 
wife, 
And one you love as dear as life, 
Every week you buy a 
bonnet new, 
And 'perhaps a 
new silk dress or two ; 
To please her now, you thank you've tried, 
But ti1l she's never satisfied. 
"I want a 
new Grecian Bend," 
say, 
"How are you off for stamps to-day?" 
If into church you chance to stroll, 
The parson's praying for your soul; 
lie vows if you don't do just so, 
You'll never go up, but down below. 
Of heathens in Africa he'll speak, 
And how much money he sent last week 
As the plate goes round, you'll hear him sa 
"How are you off for stamps to-day?" 
But now, kind friends, I'll say good night; 
I 
hope my song has hit you right. 
To please you all I've done my best, 
Now 
let the subject rest; 
But one more word before I 
go, 
And this I'll have you all to know, 
I'm broke, and all I 
have to say 
Is, " How aro are y07! Of 1.r stamps to-day;"

THE HURDY GURDY LAD. 
I 
don't feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take their word. 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be glad; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her mammy, 
And she couldn't think of parting with her dear old darling dad. 
moats. 
Yes, she said 'twould break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said 'twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hurdy Gurdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her revere, 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, be used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play; 
He:d play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to the dirty half-grown man, 
He said he was an orphan, that caus'd me him to pity. 
But never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with Fan. 
And as for her, she said, & c. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father ' bacon, and I 
found her mother rum. 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
When I 
think how she served me, it my peace of mind destroys, 
Now of Old Mother Cummings I'd often beard tell of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run off with the biggest of her boys. 
For she said, & c. 
Now when her father teld me that Fan had cut her stick, 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
alway thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and ringing 
And often in my wanderings, I 
fancy I 
shall meet 
This hurdy-gurdy grinder, and Fanny doing the singing, 
Giving a 
morning concert to some children in the street.

I W ISH I WAS •A FISH. 
OR, SWEET FOLLY PRIMROSE.

Niue six cents, 
Sweet Polly Primrose was a 
girl 
Of nineteen summers old, 
I 
loved sweet Polly better far, 
Than all the world untold. 
And she was very loud of me; 
But now I 
wail and weep, 
Far the girl I 
love's at present 
At the bottom of the deep. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great long tail, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great big tail, 
A tiny little tittle bat, a 
winkle or a 
whale, 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea. Oh I 
my I 
Sweet Polly,was on board a 
ship, 
And bound for Union Square; 
When the vessel sighted " Tammany," 
It began to pitch and rear ; 
Iy love was gazing over 
At the water rolling by, 
When, somehow, she tumbled overboard, 
And never said good-bye. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, 
The Captain and his gallant crew 
Jumped overboard to save 
11Iy darling Polly, but in vain— 
she'd sunk beneath the wave— 
And when they told me of her fate, 
l'd tear my hair and weep, 
And requested I 
might be allowed 
To plunge into the deep. 
SO 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, 6u3. 
I 
bad a 
dream last night that I 
Was down below the wave, 
And there I 
saw my Polly 
in a 
gorgeous coral cave; 
She'd changed into a 
mermaid, 
And she'd such a 
splendid tail, 
She was doing double shuffles, 
in conjunction with a 
whale. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, &c. 
While she's a 
sportive mermaid, 
I'm so wretched here above: 
So I 
think I'll take a 
plunge and be 
A merman with my love; 
But the precise locality, 
I 
don't exactly know, 
Where I 
may find my Polly 
So perhaps I'd best not go. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, ice.

IT'S BETTER TO LAUGH THAN TO CRY.

It is wise when you enter the battle of life 
To be armed for the fight from the first, 
And although you may hope for the best of the strife, 
You should always prepare for the worst; 
Don't dream of despairing or giving things up, 
If fortune is fickle or shy. 
For you'll find, whether bitter or sweet be the cup, 
It is better to laugh than to cry. 
CHURL'S. 
So never give way to the cares of the day, 
Better luck may come, by-and-bye, 
And to-morrow may brhrg quite a 
different thing, 
So it's better tp laugh than to cry. 
In the journey through life. '
twould be folly to grieve, 
If we now and then happen to find 
That ambition and friendship will often deceive, 
And that Cupid is frequently blind; 
If a 
friend should be false, or a 
hope should betray, 
-4 
'
We may find better luck by-and-bye, 
And if love—like a 
cheat—should have led us astray. 
It is better to laugh than to cry. 
So never, dm 
There's a 
charm about laughter to lengthen our lives, 
And a 
poison in sighing and care, 
For wherever we look 'tis good humor that thrives, 
And fretting that leads to despair. 
Of all the wise things that are taught us at school, 
There is nothing on which to rely, 
With so firm a 
belief as that excellent rule, 
it is better to laugh than to cry. 
So never, (to. 
There is quite as much pleasure as pain, after all, 
In this bright little world of our own, 
And the pleasure will readily come to our call, 
If the right way to call it is known; 
Should trouble pursue, or calamity press, 
Is it wiser to smile or to sigh ? 
In the moment of pain or the day of distress 
It is better to laugh than to cry. 
So never, &c.

IT IS NOT 
THE MILES WE TRAVEL, BUT 
THE PACE THAT KILLS. 
As we jog along the Road of Life we pass a 
load 
Of discontented mortals who have gone too fast ; 
Forfeiting their health, 
In the modern race for wealth, 
Until completely beaten they break down at last; 
But others slow and sure, 
The journey can t'ndure, 
Altho' the road is rugged with its dales and hills, 
They ought to bear in mind, 
In life they'll always find, 
It's not the miles they travel but he pace that kills. 
CHORUS. 
Remember what I 
say, if yuu wish to pay your way, 
And not be troubled day and night with duns and bills, 
Don't travel on too fast, 
Or you may break dowin at last, 
For it's not the miles we travel but the pace that kills. 
I'll tell you in my song bow it is I 
get a'ong, 
So easily and merrily on life's highway; 
For riches 1 
ne'er fret, 
And I 
don't run into debt, 
So I 
never find it difficult my bills to pay, 
I 
never rail at fate, 
I 
envy not the great, 
Employment keeps me healthy, and good temper keeps 
me gay, 
I 
know that labor's sweet, 
So I 
earn before I 
eat, 
And that's the way to travel, boys, on life's highway. 
Remember what, &c. 
If fortune won't be kind at first, why never mind, 
Keep boldly trudging on, but not too fast, 
Take both good and bad 
As it comes, and don't be sad. 
- 
If you only persevere you'll reach the goal at last, 
And if your fare is coarse, 
Think it might have been much worse, 
So travel on contented and don't despise 
The man thit's slow and steady, 
Always watching— always ready, 
Is the man to win the race for wealth, and gain the 
prize. 
Remember what, &e. 
FOUND IT WAS ONLY A DREAM. 
While sitting one night by my bright fireside, 
I 
fell fast asleep in my chair, 
And visions of many strange sights met my view, 
While resting so cosily there ; 
The order of things seemed entirely reversed, 
I 
wondered what'er it could mean, 
But when I 
awoke, all the mystery was cleared, 
When I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
CHORUS. 
I 
thought it was rather too good to be true, 
So unlikely a 
fact it did seem; 
But I 
learnt my mistake, for when I 
did wake, 
I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
I 
thought I 
was reading the paper ono day, 
And perused it entirely through, 
But no railway accident there could I 
see, 
No account of one came to my view; 
The fact was so startling, I 
read through again, 
But no accident there could I 
see, 
My wonder, however, was suddenly stayed, 
When I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
thought it was, ezo: 
Next I 
thought that I 
ordered a 
hack from:a stand, 
Somewhere most important to go, 
But instead of the hack only crawling along, 
It went at a 
pace, far from slow; 
When I 
stopped, and the hackman but asked his right fare, 
Such an unusual act did it seem, 
Ipaid him, ho thanked me, thought I, here's a 
change, 
But I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
I 
thought it was, &a. 
Then next a 
policeman I 
saw on his beat, 
It was cold, and was pouring with rain; 
A 
bar-keeper came out of a 
liquor saloon, 
And asked him if he'd have a 
drain ? 
But judge my surprise, when he sternly refused, 
Snell an action before I'd ne'er seen, 
It startled me so I 
awoke in a 
fright, 
And I 
found it had all been a 
dream. 
I 
thought it was, 6442.

My name is Jim, the carman's lad, a 
jolly chap am I, 
I 
always am contented, be the weather wet or dry. 
I 
snap my fingers at the snow, and whistle at the rain, 
I've braved the storm for many a 
day, and can do so again. 
CHORUS. 
Crack, crack, goes my whip, I 
whistle and I 
sing, 
I 
sit upon my wagon, I'm as happy as a 
king, 
My horses always willing, as for me, I'm never sad, 
None can lead a 
jollier life, than Jim, the carman's lad. 
My father was a 
carrier, many years ere I 
was born, 
Ile use to rise at daybreak, and go his rounds each morn, 
And then he'd take me with him, especially in the spring, 
I'd love to sit upon the cart, and hear my father sing. 
Crack, crack, etc. 
I 
never think of politics, or any thing so great, 
I 
hate to hear their highbred talk, about the church and state, 
I 
act aright to man and man, and that's what makes me glad, 
You'll find there beats an honest heart, in Jim, the carman's lad. 
Crack, crack, etc, ' 
And then the girls all smile on me, as I 
go driving past, 
My horse is such a 
beauty, and he jogs along so last, 
"We've traveled many weary miles, and happy days we've had, 
For none can treat a 
horse more kind, than Jim, the carman s 
lad 
Crack, crack, etc. 
I 
think I 
will conclude my song, 'tis time I 
was away, 
My horses will get weary, if I 
much longer stay, 
To see your smiling faces, it makes my heart feel glad, 
So drivers, treat your horses kind, like Jim, the carman's lad. 
Crack, crack, etc.

My love she is a 
fairy queen, 
About her face no paint is seen, 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall; 
Iler ankle too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit- a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee, upon her lip 
I'd stay all day and sip and sip.—Oh.

She never flirts she's no coquette, 
She never scolds, nor does she fret; 
She's some on style, and full of fun, 
I'll bet my pile she's Number One. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite, 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say ; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose, 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile.—Oh. 
She never flirts, tic. 
To see my love next day I 
went, 
To pop the question was my intent, 
Alas ! poor 111C, I 
felt quite sore, 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Aer mother screamed, and I 
did squall, 
She'd took her trunks and her waterfall„ 
I 
seized my hat, to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with the circus man.-01a.

OLD SARAH WALKER. 
Kind friends, I'm glad to see you all, 
I 
suppose you don't know me, 
But who I 
am I'll very quickly mention, 
And before I 
go away I 
mean to have my say, 
That is if you will give me your attention. 
You've no need to be told that I 
am growing old, 
And at this timo of life I 
am no talker, 
But listen unto me, and you will plainly see 
The opinions of old Sarah Walker. 
How many of our poor, who beg from door to door, 
Are wanting clothing, food and even shelter. 
And if without a 
bed, they should sleep beneath a 
shed, 
They're hurried off to prison helter skelter. 
There's no denying that the, convicts do get fat, 
They prefer a 
jail or workhouse, and they ought to; 
While they treat the poor so had, and the criminals so well, 
We shan't be wanting for thieves, says Sarah Walker. 
Of keland. I 
must say, we've found out in our day, 
That there's not a 
nation truer, or yet bolder, 
For their hearts are warm, I'll prove, and the girls, oh, can't 
they love. 
And she's brought forth many a 
statesman and a 
soldier. 
There's one that's long been gone, I 
mean Emmet, Ireland's son, 
Who to a 
proud nation proved a 
baulker. 
Long may old Ireland be the emerald of the sea, 
And prosperity be her's, says Sarah Walker.

T111. PRIVATE STILL. 
An Exciseman once in Brooklyn at the time that I 
was there, 
He fancied that a 
private still was being worked somewhere; 
He met me out one morning, he fancied that I 
knew, 
But I 
didn't—never mind that---says he, Pat, how do you do ? 
Pal de ral, &c. 
says I, I'm very well, your honour, but allow me for to say, 
I dont know you at all, by jove I 
but, says be, perhaps 
you may; 
I 
want to find something out, assist me if you will, 
Here's fifty dollars if you can tell PIA where's a 
private stilL 
Pal de ral, & e. 
Give me the fifty dollars, says I, upon my soul I 
can, 
I'll keep my word, the devil a 
lie, as I'm an Irishman; 
The fifty dollars he then put down, I 
pocketed the fee, 
Says I, now button up your coat and straightway follow me. 
Pal de ral, &c. 
I 
took him walking up the street, and talking all the while, 
He little thought I'd got to take him a 
thund'ring many miles; 
Says he, how much farther, Pat? for I 
am getting very tired, 
Said I, then let us have a 
car, and a 
jaunting car he hired. 
Pal de ral, &c. 
As soon as we got in the car, said he, now tell me, Pat, 
Where is this blessed private still ?—don't take me for a 
flit, 
A 
flat, your honour, no, says I, but hear me if you will 
And I 
at once will tell you, sir, where there's a 
private still. 
Pal de ral, &e. 
THE PRIVATE STILL. [CoNTINunD.] 
Go on at once, says he, said I, all right—now mark well, 
I 
have a 
brother that is close by here, in the barracks he does 
dwell, 
I 
assure you he's a 
soldier, though he went against his will; 
The devil take your brother, says he, where s 
the private still ? 
Pal de ral, &c. 
Hold your wist! says I, old chap, and I 
will plainly show, 
That in the army, why, of course, promotion is very slow; 
Said the Inspector, yes, rm sure it is, they're only meant 
to kill, 
But never mind your brother, tell me where's the private still. 
Fal tie ral, &c. 
Said I, I'm coining to it—the barracks close at hand, 
And if you look straight through the gates, you'll see and hear 
the band; 
And when the band's done playing, you'll see the soldier's 
drill— 
The blazes take the soldiers! tell me where's the private still ? 
Pal do ral, &c. 
Half a 
minute more, says I, I'll point him out to you— 
Faith, there he is, says I, old chap, standing 'twixt them two. 
Who the blazes do you mean ? said be; I 
said, my brother 
Bill, 
Well, says. 
he; well, says I, they won't make him a 
corporal, 
so he's a 
private still! 
Pal de ral, &c. 
The Inspector stamped and—and said he'd have his money 
back; 
But I 
jumped in the car myself, and off was in a 
crack. 
And the people as he walks along, tho' much against his will, 
Shout after him—Inspector, have you found the private still ?

PADDY BURKE. 
A French gentltman from Limerick, one Paddy Burke by name, 
Took passage for America, to come all the way by stame 
And as Pat had never seen a 
ship, he was very much to blame, 
So Ins troubles you'll take as a 
warning: 
When going by the hatchway Pat cried out What is that? 
If it's cocks and hens you've got on board, begoles! I'll live on 
fat. 
Just then the Boatswain cried, Lay to! I'll want enough, says 
Pat, 
And I'll swallow all your eggs in the morning. 
cnonus• 
Paddy was the boy that looked out for number one, 
Paddy was the boy when the ateing it begun, 
For his mother was a 
Murphy, and he was his mother's son, 
And he ate till he'd bust in the morning. 
When they started on the ocean, poor Pat felt rather sick; 
Like a 
drunken man he staggered, and he rolled around the deck, 
And he wished himself in Limerick, Old Ireland—avick, 
And the pigs and potatoes he d 
be scorning, 
When getting in the Captains way, who shouted, heave ahead 
)111 be jabers—and my stomach, too, says Pat, now nearly dead, 
stop the ship and let me out, or there ii be murder on your head, 
Its an inquest you'll be holding in the morning. 
Paddy is the boy, &e. 
Poor Pat a 
little better got, as they went on their way, 
Till one dark night a 
storm arose, and raging was the sea, 
And he wished he'd never started, to see America, 
But stayed home at Ireland, where he was born in: 
The vessel sprung a 
leak, she let water in below, 
G') fetch the doctor quick, says Pat, its a 
shame to leave her so, 
For I 
had the same complaint myself, ere from Ireland I 
did go, 
And I 
thought I'd be dead before morning. 
Paddy is the boy, & c. 
When they signted Old Columbia's shore, Pat cried, God bless 
the soil, 
It is the land where dacint men can live beyond their toil, 
And not be taxed and ground to death to increase the Saxon's spoil. 
Let freemen take this as a 
Warning- , 
It is the land where Erin s 
harp is free from British tread, 
Where every noble Fenian can go forth with warlike tread, 
And raise the noble banner, the Green above the Red, 
And freedom on•Uld Ireland will be dawning. 
Paddy is the boy, dm,

PRETTY LITTLE FLORA. 
[The music of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt's Sixpenny Series of Choice 
For sale by 
It M. Be Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price six cents.) 
I'll sing of pretty little Flora, the gem behind the bar, 
At a 
place near Harlem, you will find my guiding star, 
She is the sweetest treasure, all around near and far, 
And to speak the truth, I 
adore her! 
Swells flock like little flies around a 
treacle pot, 
And want to steal my fair one, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
They talk and drink, just to look large, and fancy they'r A 1, 
But they have not half a 
chance with little Flora. 
CHORUS. 
List'ning to the music up in Central Park, 
All among the crowd I 
met her; 
Flora was her name, my heart is in a 
flame, 
And I 
never, never, never can forget her I 
How I 
love little Flora, and for hours I 
would stand, 
The proudest of the proud, and the grandest of the grand, 
And soon I'll place the gold ring upon her tiny hand, 
Yet I 
keep my eye on all who stand before her; 
When swells they pass a 
joke, she says, ' Sir, don't be rude,' 
And putting on a 
frown, declares they very much intrude, 
Then, turning round, she looks at me, as much as just to say, 
Oh I 
George, you have the heart of little Flora 
List'ning to the music, &c. 
I 
could eat pretty Flora my love is so sincere, 
She wants no Bloom of Youth, her skin it is so`fair, 
Iler eyes are full of fire, she's a 
splendid head of hair, 
And in a 
brooch she carries me before her; 
We've named the happy day, so I'm right for life, 
If all is true as she says, she'll prove a 
charming wife, 
So am I 
not a 
lucky man, my rivals to defeat, 
And marry my own charming little Flora ?

THE ROLLICKING RAMS. 
Button up your waistcoat, button up your shoes, 
Have another liquor and throw away the blues, 
Be like me and good for a 
spree, 
Prom now till the day is dawning, 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
The only boys to make a 
noise, 
From now till the day is dawning. 
We scorn 3uch drinks as lemonade, Soda, seltzer, beer. 
The liquors of our clubTd tell to you, 
But I 
can't, for there's ladies here. 
Come along, come along, come along, 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a

Come and be a

Out all night till broad daylight, 
And never go home till morning! 
When once you're a 
member of the rollicking rams; 
All things real, we have no shams, 
Except Champagne, good Champagne, 
We drink till the day is dawning; 
In all the pockets of the rollicking rams, 
Each one puts a 
bottle of Cham. 
And on some doorstep sit and drink, 
Till daylight in the morning. 
With a 
pocket full of money the Police make right, 
To what we do they're blind, 
Such as pulling down bells and breaking lamps, 
For which we should be fined, 
Come along, come along, come along.

With us our landladies pick a 
bone, 
And get kicked out of house and home, 
'Without a 
moment's warning; 
But we don't care we're single men, 
Not hampered with a 
wife. 
So now my friends if you like the style,

STANDING ON THE PLATFORM. 
Going down to Long Branch, one fine day, 
I 
chanced to miss the train; 
I 
turned my head around, and there I 
saw, 
A 
sight which turned my brain. 
For there I 
saw a 
charming girl, 
The prettiest I'd ever seen: 
Her voice was sweet, her dress was neat, 
She was a 
fairy queen. 
Spoken.—Yes, she was the prettiest creature that I'd ever met 
a 
in the whole course of my existence, and I 
considered myself very 
lucky that I 
happened to be— 
cnoRus. 
Standing on the platform, waiting for the train, 
I 
met this darling girl, who winked at me so plain: 
Bright blue eyes 80 sparkling, teeth were pearly white, - 
She was just the pink of fashion, and just the girl you'd like. 
• 
Pray, sir, can you tell me how long the train will be, 
Said I, " I'll ask the guard," 
"I thank you for your kindness, sir T" said she 
And looked at me so hard; 
We waited but a 
little while, 
For the train it soon was there, 
And then into one of the cars, 
I 
handed this lady fair. 
Spoken.—I 
was sorry to part with her, but she had to go one 
way, I 
had to go the other, and of course, I 
couldn't detain her 
all day, a— 
Standing on the platform, die. 
She kissed her hand to me, and said, " Dear sir, 
Farewell, till next we meet." 
And oh! the look she gave me as the train went off, 
I 
assure you was a 
treat; 
Yet oh ! some day, I 
hope to meet, 
This charming creature 
And when I 
do, I'll tell you all, 
About this love of mine. 
Spolcen.—Yes, she said that she would meet me again, but 
that it would not be—

TEDDY MeGLYNN 
FROM TUE TOWN OF DUBLIN. 
Words and M usic by 11. M ILLARD. 
I 
left me ould mother wid one little brother, 
And came to this country when scarcely a 
boy: 
And though I 
am Irish, and lived on the Parish, 
I'm first-cousin-german to Patrick Malloy, 
I 
came in short breeches that often lacked stitches, 
Had nails in me :Aloes fit for horses to wear; 
Me mother'd not know me, but if you would show me, 
I'd quick know me mother and Dublin of yore. 
CHORUS 
I'm Teddy McGlynn from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door. 
I've worked, and I've waited, me brains I've berated; 
I've been to the schools, and to Lanigan's Ball; 
Me father was uncle to Kathleen Mavourneen; 
So I'm proud of me kindred, me mother, and alL 
But now I'm a 
lawyer, and feel like a 
warrior; 
I'll dance you the Lancers or jig, if you call. 
I've kept me shillelah, and own Prn most crazy 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, dze. 
And soon I'll be goin' the truth to be knowin',1 
And judge for meself of ould Ireland's woes; 
If green I 
am wearing, the Shamrock is sharing 
The love in me heart for me country's repose. 
For light is now dawning, and Liberty's morning 
Will shed its warm ray on ould Ireland's shore; 
Then Katy I'll marry, and no longer tarry 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
Then Mister McGlynn, when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole ; 
O'Brien and McNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim McDoul 
In the finest society, famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball ; 
I'll soon he an Alderman, like Jimmy Flanagan, 
Who lives on Fifth Avenue, as good as them all. , 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, 
THOROUGHBRED. 
Beau Brummel was a 
dandy, 
And lord Chesterfield a 
fool; 
In fact there's nought to copy 
From the swell of the old school: 
But we, as their successors, 
Are bound to go ahead, 
And show you what it is to be 
A modern thoroughbred. 
CHORUS. 
And I'm the Don of the lot, 
Though we've all of us got 
The knack to be constantly jolly. 
We 
fight, love and play, 
Turn night into day, 
And drive away dull melancholy. 
We 
flirt with Prima Donnas, 
The Faro banks we break, 
And at horse races we are there, 
And always win the stakes; 
In Central Park we show ourselves, 
As fashion's brightest cards, 
And as for singing, we're A. 1, 
You can't discard our bards. 
I'm the Don, &c. 
If luck should go against us, 
And little leave to spend, 
Pawnbrokers they are willing,,0 
Their money for to lend; 
We always take it easy, 
When we're inclined to wed, 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Just suits a 
thoroughbred. 
And I'm the Don, (tc. 
UP IN THAT BACK Boo: 
Ant :—" Up in a 
Balloon." 
One day I 
was married, the truth I 
will state, 
When you've heard my sad tale you will pity my fate;. 
My wife makes me work both morning and night, 
And she swears that I 
never do anything right. 
The first night we were married, it's the truth I 
am sure, 
My wife went to bed and I 
lay on the floor; 
And since I've been married I 
must do what I 
can, 
o 
pity the fate of a 
poor married man. 
CHORUS. 
Whose—up in that back room, boys, 
Up in that back room, 
All among the bugs and fleas, 
Pity my sad doom. 
Up In that back room, boys, 
Up in that back room, 
I 
wish I'd neer got married, 
To be up in that back room. 
Every morning at five, to please her desire, 
She makes me get up and set light to the fire, 
Six months I've been married, it's the truth I 
declare, 
But the joys of my wedleick I 
have not yet shared. 
Before we were married, it's true on my word, 
She looked like an angel and sung like a 
bird; 
But now like a 
lion she will fly very soon, 
If I 
speak she will quick knock me down with a 
broom. 
Up in that back room, &c. 
This afternoon, now listen to me, 
She'd the cheek to bring me a 
big soldier to tea; 
I 
said, Mrs. Brown, you know it's not right, 
She said, hold your tongue, Henry, I'll do what I

Price five cents.) 
A charming young Creature, named Nancy Barr, 
Nancy Barr—lived with her Ma. 
Of fair ones, oh! she was the fairest by far, 
A charmer bewitching and smart; 
No dickey bird singing up in the sky, 
In the sky—was more happy than I, 
But to happiness I 
have said good-bye, 
For in pieces she's broken my heart I 
CHORUS. 
Does any one know where my Nancy's gone, 
Nancy's gone, Nancy's gone, 
Does anyone know where my Nancy's gone, 
Where, oh I 
where is my Nancy? 
At a 
ball I 
first met her one night by chance, 
Quito by chance—couldn't she dance, 
While others would clumsily shuffle and prance, 
Her waltzing was something divine; 
I 
felt I 
was madly in love at first sight, 
Love at first sight, (lumps of delight,) 
When I 
took her to supper, and did the polite, 
Or helped. her to ices and. wine. 
But— 
Does any one know, dte. 
When she spoke, oh I 
my head spun round like a 
top, 
My heart went wop--and flippo.py-Sop I [1] 
WHERE IS NY NANCY P—[coNcLuDED.) 
So the terrible question I 
ventured to " pop," 
She blushed, and then softly said " Yes." 
I 
measured her finger and bought the ring, 
Bought the ring, ('twas just the thing;) 
All the next week did nothing but dance and sing, 
My joys there are few who could guess. 
But—Does anyone know, ao. 
The day it was fixed, I 
felt so gay, 
Oh, so gay, in my bridal array, 
As I 
went to the church little boys cried " Hooray," 
I 
felt quite inflated with pride; 
We were to be married at Madison Square, 
Madison Square, carriage and pair. 
When I 
got to the church she wasn't there! 
Oh, where is my Nancy, my bride. 
Does anyone know, &o. 
They say she eloped with a 
Sailor Boy Blue, 
A 
Sailor Boy Blue, oh I 
a 
regular do, 
I 
thought her so pretty, so good and. so true, 
I 
felt really out of my mind! 
) 
I've searched for her everywhere, but in vain, 
All in vain, I 
feel all over pain, 
When I 
think I 
may never look on her again, 
But I'll wander till Nancy I 
find. 
CHORUS. 
So—Does anyone know where ray Nancy is gone. 
Nancy's gone, Nancy's gone, 
Can't somebody tell me where Nancy's gone, 
Where, ah I 
oh, where is my Nancy

THE GOAT. • 
As Sung by Gus Wtemims. 
Now my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
lie had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, be had a 
quecr curious way, 
lied go out every morning, and stop out all day ; 
When he'd come home at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
Mil my father gets up for to open the door. 
(Inc dny we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate; 
And without saying a 
word, share the ould dirty gommagh, 
lie dray his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Sa
me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis mam," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat gave a ;jump, , 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorm ! such a 
murthering thump 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate ; 
lie spied me father's coat hanging, be gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," - and drily his head in the wall. 
Some time after they went to look for the goat, 
They searched all around, ' till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only the sthump of his tail, and it still bucking

On a

Passing on a 
quiet street, 
heard I 
voices all the way, 
ChildreWs voices clear and sweet: 
By the church's open door; 
Wistfully I 
lingered long, 
While my heart so sad and. 
sore, 
Joined the children's holy song:

Many a 
night and many a 
day 
heard that melody again; 
And through years to come Iknow 
I 
shall hear it evermore 
And 1 
heard it soft and low 
By the eltureh's open door.

Of all that is grand, the pride of the ; and 
We are so endearing, the world all us fearing,

If you list to what I 
say, 
I 
will show you the way, 
To be healthy, wealthy and wise; 
it's all nonsense and wrong. 
When meu say they can't get on, 
A man can never thrive till he tries. 
I 
have heard some people say, 
They never had a 
lucky day, 
But they have let that day go by: 
If you put off till to-
morrow 
You'll find then to your sorrow, 
That you've left it too late to try. 
CI1ORUS. 
Then on, boys, on, the course is always clear,' 
And never stay to give way to sorrow; 
Tho' everything to-day may look so dark and drear, 
Yet brighter days may come again tomorrow. 
Why should we sigh or fret 
If good times have not come yet, 
Our struggle may not have been in vain; 
Though all seems overcast, 
The sun will shine at last ; 
Without a 
turning, very long's the lane. 
So never waste the day, 
For Time and tide for no man stay, 
And never think of troubles that are gone; 
Be both happy and content, 
Let your time be all well t- pent, 
And be up with the lark in the morn. 
Then on, boys, on, (te. 
If your time has been misspent 
There is time yet to repent, 
Why your days in vain regretting spend? 
But pu., hard in your boat,
