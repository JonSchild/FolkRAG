Frank Blade Interview Log 
0:00:04.7 Debbie Fant interviews Frank Blade on October 28, 2013, at his house in Seattle, WA. 
0:00:27.7 Fant asks biographical questions. He disavows the name "Francis," says he doesn't 
respond to the name anymore.  
0:01:53.8 Frank has lived in Seattle since 1981. He grew up in Philadelphia, moved to Seattle 
with his wife. Dina Blade. Two part adventure: Left Philadelphia in 1979 in a VW Van. Sold 
everything they had except what fit into the van, and drove around the country for five months. 
Got married in Las Vegas, ended up in Albuquerque for a bit. Then went back to Philadelphia, 
about May 1980. They left again in early May, 1981, drove across the country and went to the 
Northwest because they'd bypassed the region in their first trip across the country. Decided to 
come to Pacific Northwest, arrived in Vancouver, B.C. in the middle of a rainstorm in late May. 
Got to Seattle in early June of 1981. Went back to B.C. where Dina had a job, but officially 
moved to Seattle in May, 1983.   
About thirty years in Seattle now. At the time, his work experience had been mostly in 
construction. He went to college and decided he didn't want to attend a graduate program in 
anthropology, which was his major. Because the arts pay so little, any anthro gig would have 
had him digging in the dirt for someone else. He'd always been handy, fixing things and building 
things, so he ended up in construction, first as a paperhanger.  
0:05:52.7 Right after college he was in Europe, where he got a job with the American PX, and he 
did everything from wallpaper hanging to painting, small construction stuff. The American PX is 
all over--wherever American troops are. But that job was in Heidelberg, outside at a big Army 
base there. When he returned he got a job as a paper hanger. That led to another job as a 
laborer/carpenter on construction/remodeling. He'd been doing that for quite a while.  
0:06:52.6 He and his wife, Dina, got to Seattle and he did small jobs. In 1985 he got a job with a 
local advertising firm that someone else on the fringe of the local music community had told 
him needed workers. It was exhibit and display work. Frank did that for three years. He tried to 
change, then eventually came back to it. At some point he was introduced to the stagehands 
local in Seattle. He's been working through them ever since. That was in 1991.  
0:08:05.5 Stagehands local is the International Alliance of Stage and Theatrical Employees, 
IATSE, Local 15. He's a stage technician. They have contracts with almost all of the theatres in 
Seattle. The purview is Bellingham, WA down to Olympia, WA. Covers a large area. Depends on 
whether you want to drive that far. Frank doesn't generally take jobs in Tacoma or Olympia. He 
does take jobs in Bellingham occasionally, but there's only one theatre up there.  
0:09:19.7 You join the union as a permit worker. You don't become a member for quite a while. 
The process of becoming a member involves first, taking an apprentice class, a large number of 
classes in electric, sound, a lot that stage techs cover in terms of job classifications within any

theatre environment. Or convention environment, they also do conventions. You join as a 
permit worker but you may not get into the apprentice class for quite a while. It was at least 
four years before he was invited to be in the apprentice class.  When you get into the 
apprentice class, you apply to be a member of the union. Then you become a member of IATSE 
Local 15.  
0:10:58.8 As a permit worker, you have all the privileges, you just can't vote at the 
meetings.0:11:23.3 You don't need to have all the skills at first--not everyone is a skilled builder 
or electrician. Theatre work involves a lot of classifications or jobs at the theatre. There's 
lighting, sound, props, building, carpenter (different from builder), riggers, truck loaders, forklift 
drivers. All skills that you can most often learn by just doing. Frank had come up from a 
background in carpentry, so he could already be a builder. Had the skills to go to any local 
theatres that had scene departments where they built scenery for the stage or a show. You 
read the plans, you build whatever it is, 20' high flats. It's different from house building, but it's 
the same kinds of things apply.  
0:12:54.1 There's also "carpenter." You assemble things that have already been built. Different 
from cutting pieces of wood to the size he wants, assembling and gluing, tacking them together. 
As a carpenter, things come in for a show off the truck, and there are parts that have already 
been built somewhere else. You put them together, physically attach with a nut and bolt or 
screws or cam lock or something.  
0:13:49.8 A builder is skilled, a carpenter is not. A lot of what they do is take things off a truck--
a touring show comes into the Key Arena or Paramount. Loaders unload boxes from truck, you 
take them from the truck into the theatre or Arena, open the boxes, and all of the pieces are in 
the boxes. You put those pieces together. You're not physically cutting wood up or splicing 
cables or building microphones. In a sense, you're a glorified box pusher. There are some 
people who only push boxes on the job. A huge number of people disassembling something and 
putting it back in the boxes, then someone else comes along and pushes the completed box to 
the truck. 
 0:15:29.8 There are skills involved with most of what he does. Frank is a builder, he knows how 
to weld, he's a forklift driver, he can do rigging, he has experience in sound and lights. He's 
done props. Those are all things that happen in the process of putting on a show or building a 
show. Frank runs A/V (audio/visual) for convention work, a lot of that. In the past they used 
carousel projectors a lot, now not. Everybody brings their computers, and you have to know 
how to get the signal from the computer to the projector and have the right aspect ratio on the 
image that you want to project, the right projector, the right color.  
0:16:57.9 Frank took an exam this morning to get a certification as a technical specialist that 
will get him more work in the A/V Dept. That test covered a wide range of the audio/visual 
profession across the board, everything from the companies that are A/V companies that get 
proposals to install an entire A/V system in their building to live sound to anything else.  
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:17:49.9 The way Local 15 interacts with that, it usually does live sound or A/V. The stuff will 
come in on the trucks, all packaged up, take it out and assemble it and make sure all the parts 
and pieces work. The presenters come in and do their spiel with the PowerPoint that runs off 
their computer, they're talking into the microphone, and that works.  All of those things are 
part of his job.  
0:18:48.6 Frank works "on the bounce." The local is a referral hall, which means there's a list of 
people who are available for work, about 700 names. About 400-500 of those people are 
members, the rest are permit workers. From that list, when a job comes in, here's an example 
of what happens: Frank just did a job at the Paramount on Saturday. A tour comes in, tells the 
venue how many people they need to take the show from the trucks to the stage, put it up, run 
it, put it back together, put it back in trucks before they go away. In that case, they needed 4 
truck loaders.  
It was a large show, so they needed "grips," carpenter, electrics, sound, props could all be 
"grips." They needed 6 riggers, 4 up and 2 down.  Someone goes up to the top and pulls the 
motors up to the top of the house, others stay at the bottom. The motors are for trusses. The 
Paramount is a theatre, so it has a fly system. But they weren't going to use the fly system 
except for borders and legs, the curtains across the top (borders) and the curtains that framed 
the sides of the stage (legs). Everything else went up. The show was set for an arena, which is 
usually a venue from 2,000 to 8,000 people. Larger coliseum-type shows, might be up to 
20,000. The Paramount Theatre holds 2500, and its' a smaller size stage area. They had a lot of 
stuff they couldn't use because they didn't have the space.  
Frank went in at 9AM on Saturday, and the crews came in at different times. At 8:00 the crews, 
riggers and some grips and some truck loaders came in. There were 30-40 motors that needed 
to be hung. Someone laid out the stage that showed where the motors needed to go and began 
hanging them, so when Frank arrived at 9AM, most of the motors were already up in the air. A 
small percentage of the lights were on the stage. They kept bringing in more stuff--more truss, 
a lot of lights, a big video wall. Sound and stage (risers, whatnot). A crew came in at 10AM also. 
By that time, about 24 grips on the show. Four guys went to lighting, eight guys worked on 
video. Opened video boxes to start assembling video.  
By 2:00 PM, after 5 hours for Frank, they were pretty close to being done. There was a show 
that night, so had to have everything up and running, and they were testing lights by the time 
Frank left. The road guy who ran the lights was testing, sound was in, video was up. The last of 
the risers were going in, and the band equipment was going in. BY 3 PM they were done for a 
show at 7:00 PM.  More tests, run sound, then the talent comes in and they do the show. Frank 
got called back at 10:00 PM, final song of show was 10:15 PM.  
As soon as final song was over, he was on the stage taking apart the show. That was a one-night 
show.  
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:26:15.0 Not everything is long periods of stuff, most is very short. They have a four-hour call, 
or minimum. You get dispatched to a call. That whole process started when the tour people 
contacted the venue and said they needed XX people, 32 grips, 4 truck loaders, 6-8 riggers, and 
this is the schedule. And the house has its own people who have a "house job." There's a 
master carpenter and his assistant, a master electrician and his assistant, a fly man, a prop guy, 
a sound guy and his assistant. They're at the venue for every show.  
 
0:27:37.5 That show was Sarah Brightman. Frank's role was as a grip, so he did a lot of the 
lighting. The call he did before that at the Paramount was a week-long show of The Wizard of 
Oz, which had been touring. He was a carpenter. The show arrived on Tuesday, and they 
worked all day Tuesday, 12-13 hours of actual work. Came in the next morning, finished it up, 
were ready by 6:00 PM.  Got an hour break, first show was on Wednesday evening at 7:30.  
 
The show call was an hour before half, which means there's always a half-hour call before 
curtain. That puts it at 7:00.  So they get there an hour before, so he arrived at 6:00 PM. On that 
call he was on the run of the show, so they did 8 shows in 5 days:  One on Wednesday, two on 
Thursday, one on Friday, two each on Saturday and Sunday. 0:29:52.0 Frank was a carpenter on 
stage left. Most of the theaters like the Paramount don't have a lot of room in the wings. So 
when things come off, they set up chain motors. If the stuff is in the way, it gets hooked to the 
chain motors and is flown up and out of the way. Had to bring things in, assemble it, put the 
flats into the automation tracks, so on cue the automation would run the scenery out on the 
stage on the track.  
 
0:30:52.3 That's the new way of doing it. In the past, those things would be pushed out on a log 
stick, or you wouldn't see the stagehands behind it as they walked out on stage, pushing it, 
hiding behind the scenery. These days there's a lot of stuff with automation.  
 
0:31:24.5 His role was on the left side, and lots of times they weren't doing anything. But then 
there'd be a flurry of activity. First thing, scene is house in Kansas, so house goes out. They're 
setting up for the next scene, Munchkinland, and all of those things have to come out of the air 
and get ready to go out. Bushes were downstage and needed to get onstage. The yellow brick 
road had to come out of the air and get assembled and ready to go out, so when the tornado 
happens, the back part of the stage curtain comes in or no lights upstage so you can't see 
what's happening. Everything is happening down by the curtain, so the stagehands get the 
automation stuff that comes off. Flurry of activity. He did that for eight shows. After the last 
show on Sunday, at 9:30 PM they started the "out," or taking down the show and packing it up. 
Frank had come in originally at 11:30 AM and he got out at 7:00 AM on that one.   
 
0:33:14.8 Contracts are set to compensate for the fact that they don't work a 40-hour week job. 
Anytime you're on a call and go over 8 hours, you're in overtime. Past midnight, double-time. 
On a show call like The Wizard of Oz, he was a little confused when he got his paycheck because 
he doesn't do too many calls. So calls have a particular rate:  3-1/2 hours at a rate that's more 
than a grip carpenter, about $5/hour more. At some point he went in to constant overtime. So 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

by the time the "out" rolled around and went past midnight, he was in triple-time, something 
like $110/hour.  
 
0:35:00.3 These days, it's not as easy to maintain energy as when he was younger. He's always 
said that this is a great job for someone who's young and single, because there are a lot of odd 
hours. Frank doesn't have a house job, so he works "on the bounce." As the jobs come in, and 
the calls go out, he takes his pick of the ones he wants and bounces around from job to job. He 
has the skills to get some of the better jobs, the better-paying jobs. Rate is whatever the 
contract stipulates as the base rate. They have contracts with a lot of the theatres in town. 
Some of the contracts are still in the $15-$22 range, high-end would be riggers. Grip would be 
$15. Most contracts put him in the $22-$27/hour as a grip and up to $45/hour as a rigger.  
 
Rigger is the skill that not everybody has. Not everyone is comfortable working heights. A lot of 
time a truck loader is a skill, used to be more of a skill because you would physically go into the 
truck and play a giant game of tetra (phone rings, tape stops)  
 
0:37:19.1 Used to say that truck loading was the IATSE retirement plan because truck loaders 
can make a lot of money. It's a funny skill:  You have to be strong enough, moving boxes and 
sometimes lifting them up high. These days, though, not so much a skill. That's changing. 
Audio/Visual work, the certification test he took that morning, will get him $41/hour. If you're 
only going to take a couple of jobs a week, and you can make $40/hour, it's good.  
 
0:38:32.7 Frank tries to take the better-paying jobs. Takes rigging jobs for the City of Seattle. He 
takes truck-loading calls and forklift driver calls because he doesn't want to be a grip all the 
time. It's hard on your body.  
 
0:39:06.5 As he gets older, he's almost 62, he doesn't want to be picking up boxes and slinging 
them around and carrying scenery all over the place.  
 
0:39:43.3 He does have a 401K plan that he's put money into over the years.  
 
0:40:00.3 There is an industrial design firm called Teague that he used to work for, from the 
East Coast. At one point they were setting up a new facility in Everett, WA, and needed 
workers. They contacted IATSE 15 and asked for people to come and help set up their shop and 
do basic building in the facility they'd rented, close to the Boeing field in Everett. He was up 
there off and on setting up the building for about a year-and-a-half. He built displays. They had 
a contract with Boeing, had for 60 years, to design plane interiors. The facility in Everett was to 
showcase and experiment with different design ideas that engineers and designers for Boeing 
wanted to test. If there were an idea for a new overhead luggage compartment, they'd build it 
at Teague and Boeing would test it.  
 
After a while Frank was in lighting and did a lot of low-voltage lighting. The trend now is to 
move from fluorescent lighting in the interior of airplanes to LED lighting, change the color

slightly or dramatically. He worked in that for about 7 years, and that was a good job. He was 
still in the Local at that time and paying dues on his hours to keep his position on the List.  
 
0:42:58.3 When you get into the local, they have a list seniority system. The calls come off of 
that list. You're placed on the F List, and these days your name would be somewhere 700 
names down. When a call comes in from Paramount, say, and they need 4 riggers and 32 grips 
coming in at these times, and 8 riggers at this time, and for the out that evening we're going to 
add in a few people more. By Local 15's bylaws, the dispatch system starts at the top and calls 
down. Some of the people at the top are already on jobs. It goes down the list. It doesn't matter 
if you're a member or not, but sometimes it does work to your advantage if you have a City 
card, registered with the City of Seattle as a temporary stage hand.  
 
Frank's number is about 100 of the 700 names on the list. The calls come down, and you 
generally know beforehand what might be coming up during the week. That week (week of the 
interview), there were only 2-3 days of work, a job on Wednesday at the Paramount, an "in-
and-out," and on Sunday with the Opera, where they'll load out Daughter of the Regiment, with 
another callback on Monday. There were 3 things offered for Sunday, along with something 
offered for Friday that he didn't take because there was something he wanted to take in about 
a week that the Friday call would have interfered with. Once you take the call, you can't get off 
it. Being number 100 on the list, on the A List, he gets enough to make a living as a stagehand.  
 
When he fills out his income tax, it's somewhere around $50,000 gross as a stagehand. Not too 
bad, considering he works about 3/4 time. But his work is cyclical and sporadic. He can work a 
14-straight-day call, where he works every day for 14 days, maybe 12 hours a day, or he could 
work one four-hour call in the entire week.  
 
0:47:25.9 You get used to the work and the hours. Frank didn't take some calls when his 
daughter was young because he wanted to be around more. There was a job onstage at The 
Rep (Seattle Repertory Theatre) that he could have applied for. But a stage carpenter, you're 
there for shows. When are the shows? In the evenings and on the weekends. When you go into 
tech, you're working 10 out of 12 hours a day. You don't see your family for a week, then you 
go into the show and you're sleeping. But you get breaks, they feed you, and a lot of times he's 
doing four-to-five-hour calls.  
 
Other times he's working overnight to load in a big show at the Key Arena--a lot of one-day 
shows you'll go in at 8:00 in the morning, and he likes to do rigging or grip calls for that. He'll be 
there minimally four to five hours. Then he'll go away and come back at 10:30, 11:00 PM and be 
there until 3:00 AM.  You catch up on your sleep sometime else.  
 
0:49:33.3 Frank worked for the Seattle Opera, one of the Local's contracts, as a builder. There's 
a scene shop in Renton, where the stage sets are built. When he first took a build call in 1994, it 
was for Der Rosenkavalier.  He ended up working there for three years straight, ten-hour days. 
Weekends off. Generally the calls are for short seasons. They were building the Ring Cycle, four 
operas. Actually, five operas in that whole time. First was Tristan and Isolde, a huge set, a boat, 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

that took up the entire stage. Like looking at the Queen Mary. Then they went right into the 
RIng Cycle. Frank learned how to weld while working for the Opera.   
 
0:51:15.1 Doesn't have a nickname that he knows of. There are only 3-4 Franks in the Local.  
 
0:51:36.0 There are politics involved in the union, but he tries to stay away from them. The 
Local has meetings where they vote on the change of a bylaw, or a problem that's come up. 
This isn't his first time in a union--he's had three experiences. In college he was doing music, 
and during the summers a friend and Frank would play music for farm laborers and tried to 
organize the farm laborers. He also worked at a bakery in the summer. He was in the Baker's 
Local, and at one point they went on strike. It was funny. At the time, the bakery he worked for 
wasn't a huge bakery, it was an industrial bakery. The bakers wanted $1.00 an hour more. They 
were on strike, out on the line, for about three weeks. Frank thinks the bakers got a raw deal, 
the union local settled for 50 cents an hour. He thinks they got sold out. Definitely politics 
involved with any group of people.  
 
0:53:57.5 IATSE has not gone on strike that Frank has known about. The grocery workers were 
just almost on strike, and there's information going round. If they go on strike, Frank doesn't 
cross the line. He doesn't see Cirque de Soleil shows because they're not union and don't hire 
local people when they come to town.  
 
0:54:52.2 There were some times when he's gotten worn out working for the union. After 
you've done something for a while, you know there's a better way to do it. Scenery tends to be 
heavy, so no reason to overbuild it. So when a show comes in that's overbuilt, and twice as 
heavy as it needs to be, it's crazy. You get frustrated sometimes. If you spend any time in any 
one business you see things that work for you and seem logical.  
 
0:56:16.9 For example, Kanye West just played the Key Arena. They went in at 5:00 AM, when 
the show call started. Frank was a rigger for the show. That was a weekend that they had three 
things come in to the Key Arena, one right after another. There was a show on Friday, just an in-
and-out for Frank as a truck loader. Friday was fine, went in at 8:00 AM and got out by 11:00 
AM. Came back that night and worked until 1:30 AM. Then he came back four hours later at 
5:00 AM as a rigger and worked until 10:00 AM. Got a few hours’ sleep, went to see his 
daughter perform that evening. Returned to the Key Arena at 11:00 PM and the show was 
running late. They sent him away, he came back at 12:30 AM and he worked until 5:30 AM.  Got 
a little bit of sleep, was back at 9:00 AM, which was Pink. Three separate shows. He worked as a 
rigger again, out of there in four hours for the load. 
 
The problem in that whole series was Kanye West because it was the first show on its tour. 
They didn't imagine how hard it would be to put the show all together plus an in-and-out. The 
show that was supposed to happen in Vancouver, B.C., on Sunday was cancelled because their 
last truck didn't leave Key Arena until 8:30 AM on Sunday morning. For their part as riggers, 
they got all the motors up and first part of the rig was in the air. Most of the hard stuff came 
after Frank left. The staging looked like a mountain that they were putting together for the first 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

time. The show carpenters were trying to figure out how the "mountain" went together. Then 
they had a video wall mounted under the truss that was on a big pivot, somewhere between a 
40-60 foot circle, had to be assembled. The doors were supposed to open at 6:00 PM and didn't 
open until 8:30 PM. The show, which was supposed to start at 8:00 PM, didn't begin until 9 or 
10 PM. When they came to take it apart, it was really difficult. The carpenters were beating big 
parts of the set to get it apart. It wasn't "tour friendly." You can't do one-day shows and do 
another show the next night unless you can get your show set up in a certain amount of time 
and tech it and get it out with enough time to drive to the next venue to do it all over.  
 
1:01:27.1 Frank doesn't think that the IATSE folks got any flack for that problem, because it was 
the first show. If it had been the end of the tour, and they had those problems, he guesses 
somebody would take the flack for it. But what they needed to do was start cutting things:  the 
video wall and the mountain both were too much. They should have been doing light and 
sound testing by 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM at the latest, and they weren't even doing that until 6:00 
PM. You learn what works and what doesn't. 
 
1:02:36.6 Sometimes shows come through, and IATSE sets up the show so they can practice 
putting the whole thing together. Teching the show in Seattle, dismantling and putting the 
show in the truck and sending it to another venue like Portland. Then it comes back and you set 
it all up again and do the show in Seattle. You just get frustrated on shows like Kanye West 
because someone's big idea didn't work--had to cancel half the tour because they couldn't 
make their stops.  
 
1:03:57.2 You can get really big shows in, U2, for instance, was doing "leapfrogging." They had 
two complete sets of the stage. They would come and start one in Seattle while they were 
taking down the last show and getting it to the next venue. So all together, U2 had about 200 
trucks. Something like 40-60 trucks contained the stage, big pieces. That was at Qwest Field. 
Frank didn't work the in-and-out, he took the show call because it was a contract he didn't like. 
Grips were getting $15 an hour, and he can't pay his bills for $15 an hour. But they needed a lot 
of people for the concert, so he took a call for the actual show, which was $19, and it was only 
four hours. He went in to the show and then left when it was over. But there were a lot of 
trucks.  
 
1:06:08.4 Number of trucks depends on economics. 2007-2008 was a depression that hit the 
show business world a couple of years later because shows had been booked a year or two 
years out. What happened was, you'd get a show that was three trucks, and then they'd pack 
those three trucks into two. Instead of things easily coming off the truck, now you had trucks 
packed to the gills. The companies would trim down the show as another alternative so you 
don't have to carry as much stuff because of gas, truck rates, etc. The big lavish productions, 
you don't see them so much right now. You see smaller productions. The Broadway shows 
aren't touring or they're smaller productions. They're skimping, taking out parts of the show 
they don't need and putting the rest into two trucks. Frank has seen a scaling-down of shows: 
fewer shows, smaller shows. But it looks like that trend is now changing back a bit.  
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

1:08:25.5 The fewer, smaller shows resulted in fewer IATSE local jobs when the shows came to 
town. You don't need 30 people anymore, you need 8 extra hands all around, a couple of truck 
loaders, some riggers, and the house crew runs the show. So no chance of runs. You can make 
money on runs.  
 
1:09:06.0 Frank hasn't had time to get bored on a run. There are periods of down time. He's 
done operas where you set up for the top of the show, maybe one or two small things that 
move off, the curtain comes down and ends Act One to begin Act Two. There's a flurry of 
activity that lasts maybe five minutes, all the stuff onstage has to come off. Everything waiting 
in the wings has to go on. Prop guys run out to put things where they need to go. Music starts 
up again, curtain goes up, next act. Whew! Then you go back to the lounge room and back to 
reading your book and wait for the next big change that comes along.  
 
People think about the "magic of theatre." They say, "What do you do?" and Frank says, "I'm a 
stagehand." "Oh, you work in the THEATRE!" People have this idea of the theatre that's way 
different. The magic of theatre is a lot of pushing and pulling, a lot of grunt work.  
 
1:11:10.6 Unless Frank is on a show, where he wears "show blacks," black clothing so you fade 
into the scenery, he wears regular work clothes that you don't mind getting dirty. He has lots of 
T shirts, you get them on traveling shows at the end of the show or sometimes beforehand, so 
they’re a demarcation system for what department you're in. For example, Pink came in and 
gave T shirts out at the beginning. All the red shirts were video guys, all the green shirts were 
carpenters.  All the yellow shirts were pushers. Frank has a lot of black shirts, a popular color for 
stagehands. A lot of his clothing is black.  
 
1:12:40.8 Over the years Fran has collected many kinds of toolkits. He has a toolkit for 
paperhanging, one for carpentry, one for being an electrician. His basic stagehand kit is one 
tool, a crescent wrench that has an extra ring on it that helps with lighting. Stage lights have 
three screws: one tightens the lamp to the bar, one tightens the clamp to the fixture, and one is 
a screw on the side so you can turn the light back and forth. He keeps that tool in his backpack 
and carries it all the time. He has another toolkit he uses if he's going to be a carpenter:  A 
carpentry tool bag with a hammer loop. Most of the time, if you're working as a carpenter, you 
don't need a hammer. He thinks that’s ironic. Their toolkit specifies a hammer, screwdrivers, 
and a set of wrenches. Another tool bag he has contains three open-end box-end wrenches, 
7/16”, half inch, and 9/16”; a ratchet with a bunch of sockets running from 7/16” to ¾”; a 
screwdriver; a hex tool. It weighs about seven pounds at the most. Not very big, fits on his belt.  
 
1:15:27.9 As a rigger, he has a suitcase that he can wheel behind him that has a rope, a bunch 
of slings and strappage, different pulleys, a full-body harness--full-arrest harness. That's pretty 
much it except for a pair of gloves. If he's going to be a builder, it's a whole different set of tools 
that includes hammers, marking tools, wrenches, pliers. If he works at the Opera Shop he also 
takes his welding gear, and he has a set of leathers and helmet and gloves so he doesn't get 
burned.

1:16:37.4 Frank has purchased most of his own equipment over the years.  
 
1:16:56.4 Frank doesn't like it when people don't have their tools when they're supposed to. 
(Phone rings, tape stopped)  
 
1:17:30.9 Nothing has fallen down when Frank's been on a job. A friend of his got hurt when 
they were building trees, through something that Frank did, though it wasn't on purpose. Part 
of what they do--they have to be safe and pay attention. A lot of people don't pay attention. 
Sometimes he hasn't paid attention and gotten hurt. A lot of people do that, and they're 
walking wounded. They have to go to work because the way the health care system works in 
the Local, Frank gets health care through Group Health Cooperative. If he works a certain 
number of hours in a month, 145 hours of that pays for him to have health care. Any extra 
hours go into an hour bank, so he can get paid ahead for a bit. The problem comes when you're 
actually injured and can't work. Then you can't work and your health care runs out, you're on 
COBRA. It's not cheap. For Frank to pay for COBRA for himself, his wife, and his daughter, it's an 
extra $700 easy. When you’re not working, you don’t have money AND you don't have health 
care. You're stuck. There's not any free health care out there that he knows about. There's 
minimal stuff, and you still have to pay, and you have to have an income to be able to pay for it. 
So people have to work and are working while they're hurt.  
 
1:20:47.1 Frank has been hurt on the job. Sometimes his back flares up and he can't work. It put 
him down for three weeks one time. He's had a number of close calls, been hurt on the job. Not 
paying attention is mostly what it comes down to.  
 
1:21:30.6 Frank thinks his most valuable skill is that he pays attention. People aren't aware of 
their surroundings, even walking down the street. For example, if you're female and walking 
down the street late at night, and you're walking in a bad neighborhood and do certain things, 
you'll almost invariably get attacked because you look like a victim. "Situational awareness" is 
the term to describe that. So if you're walking in a bad section of town, male or female, and not 
paying attention to what's going on around you, you can walk into a situation and get hurt.  
 
Same is true with any job that's physical. If you're on stage and there are 20 people within 10 
feet of you moving big pieces of stuff around, and you're not paying attention to that group of 
guys picking up something that, if it's dropped, could land on you, you can get hurt. There are 
things that come in from above. Stage directions:  If you standing onstage looking at the 
audience, you're looking downstage. “Up” is behind you. So if something coming in from above 
comes in, people are yelling "Pipe coming in, midstage." If you don't look up, you can get hit 
right in the head by a pipe coming in.  It's situational awareness in the workplace that will keep 
you from getting hurt. If you continually walk on the cords and cables on stage, and someone 
pulls a cable, it'll go right out from under your feet and you'll be on your back. (Phone rings)  
 
1:24:23.7 If somebody drops something--we all think we're not going to drop anything. But if 
you're at the theatre, besides having a stage it has a fly system. A bunch of pipes going up and 
down that are counter-weighted. Above there's a grid overhead where you can access the fly

system. A bunch of lines go overhead or underfoot, a couple of ways of doing that. You go up 
there to do some work, to pull motors up, and if you have something in your pocket, or you 
drop a pin from a shackle, that's coming down pretty quick. Frank was at the Mount Baker 
Theatre, knelt down between some running lines and as he was going down, he had a knife in 
his pocket. The clip of the knife hangs over the side of the pocket to keep it on. A wire came up, 
grabbed the clip, pulled the knife out of his pocket, and the only way he knew it was out was 
that it hit a pipe and he heard it on the way down. The grid in that theatre is 58 feet high, and 
the knife was on the floor before Frank could say, "HEADS!" The more you pay attention to 
things, the better it is for you and everyone around you. You don't get hurt. If he gets hurt and 
loses his livelihood, what will he do? 
 
 1:27:05.3 For most of the jobs in the theatre, except for building, Frank's criteria for excellence 
is pretty much that he did it in a timely fashion. Or the road guy says, "Hey, it was great having 
you on the call." Because how many times do you do a job in a lifetime before you know how to 
do it? If he has to set up staging, there's nothing magical about it. Step by step. He doesn't stop 
in the middle and forget what's going on. He tries to think what the next couple of steps are as 
he's working.  
 
1:28:31.0 Frank defines himself as a stagehand, but he's also a musician. He's often thinks of 
music as the thing you do to keep yourself sane. If we just did work every day, he could do that 
and come home and watch TV. But other times he likes to play music, which he's been doing for 
40 years. Music is a collaboration for Frank. He gets to play with other people and the music is a 
collaboration, moves back and forth among the musicians. Or getting the rhythm right. Frank 
plays about eight different instruments. He generally plays old-time and contra dance tunes, 
sings occasionally. Plays instrumental music, mostly for dancing. The instruments he plays are 
guitar, fiddle, mandolin, bass, banjo, tenor banjo, dulcimer, occasional piano and a flute.  
 
1:31:19.0 Frank thinks that we all need to think about what we do in different terms. Work is 
there for a reason, we're not all farmers or hunter-gatherers anymore. We have to do 
something to make the machinery move that puts the food from over there to over here. Frank 
has to work. At this point in his life he likes it because he can pick and choose, he's familiar with 
it. He likes variation--if he had to be in an office every day, he'd go crazy. He'd not that kind of a 
person. At one point he was training to be an architect, and he realized early on that it would 
be fluorescent lights and drafting, and he decided he didn't need that. Everybody's life has 
some value, so you're not necessarily going to find it in work. The things he does have an 
element of art in them--building sets, making something work in an aesthetically pleasing way. 
It's not a pile of junk anymore, it has a purpose.  And I built that, and it functions well, and it 
looks good.
