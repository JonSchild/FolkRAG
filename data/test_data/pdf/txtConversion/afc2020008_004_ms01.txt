Matthew Basiago interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 24, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement 
Company Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for 
clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Excellent. So, today is Monday, May 24th, 2021. This is an interview for the 
occupational history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, 
funder by the Archie Green fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement 
workers in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in 
the United States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection 
at the Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Matt Basiago at the 
Lehigh Cement Company Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me 
your permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Matt Basiago:     That is correct.  
 
VP: 
Excellent. So, could you tell me your full name, the year of your birth, and where you 
were born?  
 
MB: 
Yes. My name is Matthew Basiago. I was born ----1986, in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And where is that in relation to the Valley?  
 
MB: 
It's outside of Redding. So, in that area. 
 
VP: 
Is that an hour's worth of driving? 
 
MB: 
About hour, an hour and a half.  
 
VP: 
And you grew up in the area?  
 
MB: 
Yes, I grew up in the Lehigh Valley. Correct.  
 
VP: 
When did you first learn about the industry, the cement industry?  
 
MB: 
It's kind of been around. You know, I've seen it around my whole life. I had no inkling 
of what actually went into the production of cement until I started working here. But I was 
always aware that it was a integral part of the Lehigh Valley’s history along with steel.  
 
VP: 
Did you learn about it at school?  
 
[00:01:34] 
 
MB: 
Yeah, when I was in school, they did tours of the Atlas Museum, which is in 
Northampton, Pennsylvania. I went to Northampton High School and that was a big part of it. 
They would bring you through the old foundries there and there was like an old mine they 
would take you through. And, you know, you saw some of the old mills, the kilns, tall, 
dilapidated that they would take you through. But it was one of the older cement plants.  
 
VP: 
So, how did you first think about working in the industry?  
 
[00:02:01] 
 
MB: 
Well, approximately at this point, seven years ago, I started in heavy industry at a 
local place called Molted Acoustical Products, which is a automotive and architectural 
fiberglass fabrication plant. And I started there. Previously, I had worked in banking for 
almost a decade, but I was looking for a change of pace, banking being a very cutthroat 
industry with sales and everything of this nature. I worked for Wells Fargo for most of the 
time and I just wanted a change of scenery. So, I had a friend who worked in heavy industry 
and he got me started in a quality position. I ended up really liking it because obviously I 
started in quality, which is more of a mental thing coming from banking. It had the same 
skillset, you know, it was very mathematical. And you needed to be able to think and use 
Excel documents and things like this. So, I really enjoyed the heavy industry part of it, 
because it was more of like a hands-on. So, I was offered an opportunity very shortly with my 
tenure there to work as a production manufacturer and we worked a lot with robots and things 
like that. So, it was very cool. And you got dirty as well as how to use your mind. So, that 
that was kind of the start of my love, of being in heavy industry. And from there, that 
company saw some downsizing and reduction of pay rates and things of this nature. I was just 
starting a family and I had a new son who was a year old at the time and the wage decrease 
was unacceptable in my opinion. So, I started looking elsewhere and this location was hiring. 
So, you know, I put my name in the hat to be a what did we call process control supervisor, 
which is essentially the plant manager during the off shift. You are in charge of the entire 
facility and I got accepted. And from there I went through a program that we have called 
Some Tech, which is a online program where they would just go through all the curriculum 
from the whole process flow. So, starting from quarry all the way to the finished product and 
did the online courses while I was also working here and came up to speed pretty quick. And 
within a year I was promoted to the shipping manager. So right now I run the shipping 
department and yeah, it's just been, you know, a roller coaster of a ride. And obviously I went 
from just knowing, like that cement was an integral part to knowing how it's actually made. 
And it's a really interesting process. And I do enjoy being dirty as well as using my mind. So 
it's a cool balance. 
 
VP: 
So, what was the interview process like?  
 
MB: 
Yeah, well, I came in here and they're like, so what do you know about them? And I 
said nothing beyond what I Googled. Sure. And you know that I did have at that point about 
five years of supervisory experience and I was the production superintendent by the time I 
left the other place. So, I was involved with the engineering, the research and development, 
the maintenance and the production aspect of things being the supervisor. So, you know, the 
old saying when you go to school as a widget, as a widget, right? So, if you know how the 
process of manufacturing something is. So, I had a lot of strengths in that area, even though I 
didn't actually know the cement process. But that's why they offered me that that curriculum 
to go through and just kind of adapted to it. And, like I said, a widget as a widget, as long as 
you understand how something comes from a raw material through the finished project. 
Yeah, process, you understand pretty much anything about it. You know, you just need to 
know the different chemistry involved.  
 
VP: 
So, what was the most surprising thing for you to learn about the cement industry? 
 
[00:05:44] 
 
MB: 
Is that essentially we're like a volcano is how I like to describe it, because we take, 
you know, rock from the earth, which, you know, is obviously, you know, made through a 
volcanic process for the basic part and then it's just compressed and everything. So, what we 
do is we take that rock, we brush it back, that we put it through the kiln, which if you ever got 
the opportunity to look inside of a kiln, it legitimately look looks like the inside of a volcano, 
just molten material that we add limestone and then we add sulfur. And, you know, there's 
other additives that we add to make a different rock, which we call clinker. And then you 
grind that and then it's essentially your cement, but it's the volcanic process. It's very 
interesting. And I thought that was really cool. I take videos for my kids. They love it. Yeah, 
yeah, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Do they know a lot about cement? 
 
MB: 
Unfortunately. Right.  
 
VP: 
Are they going to work in the industry?  
 
MB: 
Oh, I'm not certain. You know, my son is two and I have a baby a month old, so 
maybe, you know, so.  
 
VP: 
And what did you do in your first job?  
 
MB: 
You may mean the Molted Acoustical Products or for here.  
 
VP: 
Here. 
 
[00:06:49] 
 
MB: 
OK, so for here process control supervisor, essentially you're in charge of the 
production. Right? So, during a day shift on a daily, you will be in charge of the raw process. 
You would be in charge, which is the grinding of the raw stone and the mixing of, like I say, 
the gypsum, which has the sulfur and things like this sand, iron ore at different mixture levels 
based on what the quality analysis is. So, you would be in charge of overseeing that. We'd be 
in charge of overseeing the function of the payroll processing line, which is the creator 
through the kiln, and then the actual finished mill process, which is the grinding to the 
finished product of cement. So pretty much that. And then, like I say, one, during the off 
shifts or the weekend, you would be in charge of the quarry as well, the shipping functions. 
And, you know, the just the entire plant, you would essentially be the plant manager. So, 
yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, how many hours did you work?  
 
MB: 
Well, when I started, I was the relief. So, a relief at this particular plant would be 
filling in for people's vacations or whatever, right? So, 60 hours or more wouldn't be 
uncommon, you know. And I thought, oh yeah. Oh yeah.  
 
VP: 
And it was a full-time job? 
 
MB: 
Oh yeah.  
 
VP: 
Is it a contract position or?  
 
MB: 
Um, well, for the salary positions, at least from supervisory, there's no contract that's 
signed. Maybe the managers or something like that, I'm not certain. But you know, as far as 
the supervisory position, though, there wouldn't be no contract.  
 
VP: 
So, it was a salary.  
 
MB: 
Oh, yeah, it was it was a salary job.  
 
VP: 
Yes. And so what did your schedule look like for that particular job?  
 
MB: 
It fluctuates. So, when I was in the relief, I was filling the vacations, like I said. But 
the standard PCS, as we call it, the process control supervisor PCS would work 24 hours, one 
week, which would be Wednesday, Thursday, and then the following week 60, so you would 
get your 84 hours for one pay period.  
 
VP: 
Oh wow. So why, why is the kind of distribution of hours?  
 
MB: 
Because it's a 24/7 coverage, right? Because we are constantly running. So, you would 
have guys rotating there would be in like a two-man crew essentially. So, there's four PCSs 
and they would be together you know, two day rotation would be two day shift and then to 
night shift and that would be a team. And then the other team would work Monday, Tuesday, 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'm sorry, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and on Thursday. And then 
they would switch to the following week. You go from day, you're five days then to your two 
days, then to your five nights and then your two nights. So, in that constant rotation. 
 
VP: 
How did you manage to sleep?  
 
[00:09:22] 
 
MB: 
Uh, it's difficult, but you have to find a way to do it. And, you know, when I was the 
relief, there would be what we call 24 hour turnaround, right? So, I would come from a night 
shift, have a day off and come back for the day shift or vice versa, you know, and that's 
difficult, you know, to get your body adjusted to. But it's part of the industry. Everybody is 
pretty much on swing shifts, more or less most of the positions that are unionized, the hourly 
employees do rotate like that. As far as salary, the PCs is really the only one who does that. 
But that's because they provide the coverage during the office, right? So.  
 
VP: 
So, were you working in the control room or walking around the plant?  
 
MB: 
Primarily walking around the plant. But, you know, the control room. Was a big part 
of everything they would communicate with you, you know what I mean? And they would 
tell you what was critical at the time. And then it was your responsibility to take the action if 
there was something critical, right? And then if there's nothing critical, it's all about 
preventative maintenance. So, you're looking for, you know, a big part of the job will be 
inspection, right? You would need to know what to look for, what could be a possible 
malfunction that could lead to a downtime incident, you know, so you would want to stay 
ahead of that. And I would constantly be just walking up and down many flights of stairs and 
walking around the dark crevices, the plant where somebody else might not go, hopefully 
spotting something that we could get ahead of, that might be a problem later.  
 
VP:  
So, it’s a physically difficult job, too. 
 
[00:10:46] 
 
MB: 
It is very physically demanding. And but like I said, this was something that was 
appealing to me. You know, I think that I'm pretty mentally acute and I do like that aspect of 
the job as well, I don't want to give that up, but I didn't want to like in banking, I was 
primarily at the desk. And that was one of the things that appealed to me is you got to get 
around, work with your hands, get dirty, you know?  
 
VP: 
What were some of the tools that you used to measure or predict failures?  
 
[00:41:04] 
 
MB: 
So, we would use a flare gun a lot, which is like a temperature gun. So, it's a thermal 
imaging, infrared temperature gun. So, you're looking for on bearings or, you know, just for 
overheating so you could get ahead of it if something's not being greased or lubricated 
correctly. There's very large bearings for a lot of this equipment, it's very large scale. Pretty 
simple, a lot of it, but it's just on such a large scale that it makes it difficult to prepare. For the 
kiln, you would be constantly watching this. We do have a thermal imaging system that is 
constantly being monitored inside of the central location. But you would also want to be 
watching for what we call a hot spot, which would be something where there's lots of 
refractory inside the kiln to protect the shell. So, if something were to fall out, we get what's 
called coating during the process where it will just build up material. And this is good, but to 
a degree, sometimes it will get large and, like, jut out. So, this if this happens, the material 
goes by, flows by and rips it out. So, if coating falls out, that's where you're watching because 
if coating falls out is about 50 percent chance that it's going to rip the refractory with it. So, if 
you're scaling down the refractory at a certain point, then you're getting the heat directly on 
the kill and this is bad. And then we get a glowing area, which means it's an immediate 
shutdown. You're going to warp the iron and it's not good. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, are there particular machines or parts that beak down most commonly that you 
have to work with?  
 
MB: 
Sure. So, you know, another thing that we would have to use, obviously, our 
computer, if we have a lot of great automation involved in our process. So, we're detecting 
things in real time through automation. So, a lot of the times the biggest failures that I would 
see would be in what we call a dust collection units, which, you know, is obviously for the 
environment, but it's also to help with the airflow through the process. So, if these get 
clogged now, you're getting less airflow through the process. And with the kiln in particular, 
we have a main blower that feeds the kiln right now. This draft goes through the cooler and 
then goes all the way back to the raw mill process. So, we're heating the raw mill process 
with the heat from the kiln, but then there's returns and then cools in the cooler. So, it's 
something of that process gets messed up. We have two main dust collectors on either side. 
There's actually two on the raw metal side and then one on the kiln sign that is creating this 
draft. So, you're constantly watching this dust collectors. And a lot of the times you have to 
go out on the field, monitor with your eyes, but as well as the computer to try and preempt 
the actual emissions problem. Once you see emissions, you know you have a problem. But if 
you can get ahead of it and watch the trends, you know, you take the computer out there, 
watch there and watch it in real time, and then you can kind of discern where the failure is 
going to be.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned, you watch with your eyes.  
 
MB: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
What do you mean by that?  
 
[00:14:08] 
 
MB: 
So, if you if you see, like in the instance of emissions, you would physically see puffs 
of, like, dust in the air, you know what I mean? And then we go to what's called smoke 
school. We've become certified for this is a 10 percent opacity, this is that 50 percent opacity. 
And anything above 10 percent is an automatic failure. So, you're watching these dust 
collectors. They have fans that go through an exhaust port then and this is where you're 
watching. You know, of course, you use your eyes on any piece of equipment in your ears as 
well. You know, you're listening constantly. Something doesn't sound right. You're watching 
something. If you're watching a parent jumps, you know, is constantly monitoring. So, you 
use your senses a lot out there. It’s probably your best tool while you're out there. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, you have to be very alert.  
 
MB: 
Oh, yes.  
 
VP: 
So, are you able to understand the test, for example, to be able to say and this is kind 
of coming to the top and … 
 
MB: 
Oh yeah, yeah. That's where they take you to a small school a couple of times a year. 
You get certified in the beginning. If you can't discern the differences, then you can't be 
certified to do this testing, right? 
 
VP: 
So, what's involved in this school?  
 
MB: 
They bring a device that's creating smoke, right? And it's essentially the same kind of 
exhaust port that would be on a dust collector unit, but they are testing you at different levels 
and you're monitoring and the key that they would teach you is like if it's a gray smoke or a 
white smoke that you're putting it against like a blue sky or a building so that you can 
constantly see it. You can't put it against a cloud or something of a similar color, you 
wouldn't be able to discern what the opacity level is.  
 
VP: 
That’s amazing, what a skillset!  
 
MB: 
It's different. Right.  
 
VP: 
Requires a lot of intuition.  
 
MB: 
Yeah, exactly. It very intuitive. 
 
VP: 
So, would you say that cement workers have to have a particular set of personal 
qualities in addition to professional skills? 
 
[00:16:00] 
 
MB: 
Yeah, I would say they call it “cement tough.” You have to have a lot of integrity, you 
know, you got to call it like you see it. You have to be trustworthy because it's a multimillion 
dollar operation and your calls have to be correct in you know, you actually have to have like 
a lot of fortitude, too, because like you say, these hours are very difficult. It's a very dirty 
environment. And you have to probably be pretty strong, too, because cement, when it sets on 
something, you know, you get rain on it and it makes cement. So, it's very hard for so to be 
able to maneuver. And he was like a wrench or anything of this nature, like an actual tool. 
You have to be physically strong, I think, to do this sort of work.  
 
VP: 
So, do you have to lift things a lot? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, a little bit here and there. With the supervisory, it's in the contract that 
management isn't supposed to do a hourly job, you know, but, you know, you do offer a hand 
here and there. The guys appreciate that. And you just don't go above and beyond in the same 
way that they might have to, because then you're taking somebody else's work and it's kind of 
a union thing.  
 
VP: 
Yeah. So, tell me more about a sort of what was the most challenging thing to learn 
when you shifted industries and began working at the plant?  
 
[00:17:24] 
 
MB: 
Well, I was familiar with process flow, but the whole plant encompasses about, I'd 
say, almost three miles worth of property. So, and it's one process flow with many pieces of 
equipment. So, learning how everything fed the next thing was difficult, I would say.  
 
VP: 
So, can you describe. So, this was your first job. Could you describe your second job? 
And when did you make that shift? After how many years of working in the firs position?   
 
MB: 
It was about nine months that I was working in this first position and then I went into 
that position. I've been there for about at this point six months, going on six months. And it's 
a little more computer related, it’s a lot of reporting. I'm in charge of the cement inventories. 
So, managing how much we have of each type of cement and coordinating the sales with the 
customers, things of this nature, you know.  
 
VP: 
How many different types of cement is there?  
 
[00:18:29] 
 
MB: 
So, we have masonry cement, which is a type one clinker that we would add [unclear] 
train additive to as well as limestone. So, that's what we call pennsy stone, which is the high 
limestone. And this makes it more malleable for a mason to work with in the set time would 
be a lot longer. So, it gives them, or a mason, the time to maneuver it. And then we would 
have one a, which is a type one, clinker with just the air and train, not the pennsy stone 
enrichment, which again, it adds some malleableness to it. And I've learned from working in 
this industry that it's mostly used for like cast statues, things of this nature, so that the air in it 
helps it settle better into the cast. So, you're making like a cast actually. Next time, if you see 
a cast concrete statue or someone's statue, you look at this, you'll see little bubbles in it. And 
this is the air and trained chemical that is in there to help it flow better into to the cast. And 
then we would have a type three, which is essentially a type one, high finesse with increased 
gypsum added in the finishing process. And this would increase the set time. So, when you're 
talking about like a high fineness, we call it 325 or [unclear], which is actually how many 
particulates of cement are in a given area. And then you add the water and this is the more 
fine it is, the quicker it absorbs the water, right? So, it has more area to encompass and it just 
happens faster. So, as we increase that time on the type one product that we would have what 
we call block, which is just the type one with the pennsy stone added, which again is it does 
take a little bit longer to set up, but it's actually our environmentally friendly one because 
we're using less clinker, which means less killing time. So, it's about a 10 percent additive of 
the pennsy stone. And this is, like I say, the environmentally friendly and we're seeing a lot of 
customers switch over. So, that's all for the type one clinker. Then, we have a type two 
clinker, which is an increase set time. It's a little bit darker because it's also on the kilim for a 
little bit longer. It burns a little bit harder to get that increase that time and usually state DOT 
[Department of Transportation] uses this thing for the other types of projects and we see a lot 
more state customers with the type two. State uses for type one as well. But type two is 
mostly the state, the state customers.  
 
VP: 
So, do you go and travel to see where your cement is used? 
 
MB: 
No, our company informs us when it's on a pretty big or cool project, though.  
 
VP: 
What's your favorite?  
 
[00:21:00] 
 
MB: 
Um, well, not from this plant in general, but we make over in Europe, it's like 
photoelactic cement, right? So, what this cement does, I don't know what the additives that 
they add to it are, but it actually like pulls smog or, like, pollutants out of the air. So, it's like 
an eco-friendly cement that also has like a breathability and it pulls, you know, pollution out 
of the air. I think that's a pretty cool thing.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like there's more conversation about kind of the environment?  
 
[00:21:31] 
 
MB: 
Oh, yeah. I've noticed that even since, like, the year and a half that I've worked here, 
they drive it more to towards being environmentally friendly. We use alternative fuels at this 
site, which would be recycled rubber and some other, you know, garbage juices and things 
like this that have a very high factor for how long they can burn. So, and it does increase our 
gas storage, I would say, like, it decreases the uses of gas so it increases our ability to be 
environmentally friendly by reducing our carbon footprint and essentially is the best way to 
put it. So, we are taking something that is just waste and, you know, rotting away. In one 
way, this is good for the environment. And the other way, you know, it is reducing the 
amount of natural gases or which is primarily what we feed our kiln with. And we don't use 
any coal at this point either. So, you know, good things for the environment.  
 
VP: 
And so now do you work on your own or do you work as part of a team?  
 
MB: 
I would say that every everything in here is very team based. However, as far as my 
department, I'm the sole salaried person. So, like, I am in charge of my team of like 20 guys.  
 
VP: 
So you're managing 20 guys? 
 
MB: 
Roughly. 
 
VP: 
Wow! What do they do?  
 
[00:22:52] 
 
MB: 
Um, so my crew would be responsible for loading the bulk trucks, the bulk silos, we 
also load rail. Which, one railcar is about four trucks. And, you know, this obviously is good 
for the environment as well. You know, you load up railcars, it's less trucks on the road, less 
pollutants in that fashion. We do package cement, which, you know, that's probably one of 
the biggest moneymakers because, you know, it's in a smaller package, it’s for a smaller 
industry. If a place doesn't have a silo, it's probably not the most eco-friendly version of it, 
but, you know, it's definitely a profitable division as well. And we have what's called tapping, 
which over at plant three, which is across town here. It's one of the older facilities. We have a 
bunch of storage silos where we grind them from the mills into and then there's a bunch of 
tunnels underneath that connect to another set of silos. And then these pipes are, you know, 
we take an air slide with a grizzly in it. When the grizzly basically feeds from the silo, it's an 
automated like set of bearings that open up a chute over the slide. And then there's somebody 
there manning this, operating that, watching the screw as the cement comes out of the silo, 
enters through a pneumatic air slide, which pushes it to another screw, it shoots across 
another pneumatic air slide. It probably covers about three quarters of a mile worth of push. 
And that's how he got cement transferred over from that area.  
 
VP: 
So, that's amazing. Do you also, like, make sure that it's maintained and that it’s 
moving fast?  
 
MB: 
Yeah, yeah. You know, that's the guy's primary job to make sure that everything's 
functioning properly. And then we do what are called PMs, you know, constantly making 
sure that the equipment is operating as intended.  
 
VP: 
And the team you work with, they are hourly workers?  
 
MB: 
Yeah. You know, all my workers are hourly.  
 
VP: 
How long do people typically stay in that position?  
 
MB: 
Um, I have some newer guys that just started within the last year. I have some guys 
that have been in the position for twenty years.  
 
VP: 
Is it challenging, because it’s another skillset, to supervise.  
 
MB: 
Yeah. I mean, every everything in the cement plant is very particular about which 
skill set you need to require. Like we have a mill right, you have to be very mechanically 
inclined, diagnostically strong and there's some welding that's involved with that. And then 
you have the electricians which deal with the PLCs. You have to understand logic and then 
you have to understand, obviously, how to work safely with 480 volt electric, you know, so 
that's just two other jobs, you know. But I work with those teams to make sure that my 
equipment works, right? And then, you know, there's the shipping aspects which the loaders 
have to be state certified as weight masters to understand how to read the scales and things 
like that. And then all of our scales have to be certified by the state, which is my 
responsibility. And then, you know, the packing guys. And this is a fully automated piece of 
equipment that, you know, the conveyor belts and everything from the packing all the way to 
the finished. We call it parallelization where it actually gets put on the pilots when the bags 
are done. That's probably, I would say almost half a mile worth of conveyors and everything. 
And, you know, they need to know how to look for failures on that and I need to know how 
to look for failures on that and then how to fix it.  
 
VP: 
How do you look for failures on the conveyor belts?  
 
MB: 
Again, with the eyes and the ears, you know? Yeah, you just got to know what to look 
for. And if something is malfunctioning, you know, the proper diagnostic process, at least as 
I've learned and being involved in heavy industry is if something fails at point B, you're 
looking at point A to see why, you know, and then working your way.  
 
VP: 
So, lots of people talk about the seniority system in the cement plant in the industry 
and so that there's a kind of grooming process.  
 
MB: 
Sure.  
 
VP: 
And you just kind of jumped in at the top. Has that been challenging with working 
with and focusing on so many more years in the industry?  
 
MB: 
I feel like that's challenging anywhere you go, right? But I feel if you have a proper 
skill set, you should be rewarded for that, you know, and I feel like there will always be 
somebody standing in your way. To use a phrase, I guess this is going to go on record, like, if 
you're not doing something right, then people won't hit on you, you know?  
 
VP: 
Do you feel more pressure to be at the top of your game?  
 
MB: 
Uh, I feel like that's in my personality type, that I constantly am trying to strive and 
excel to be better, right? I think that goes with the integrity. I don't want to associate with my 
name something that is poor workman, you know. 
 
VP: 
Do you ever have arguments with folks who have worked in the industry for years and 
they try to pull the seniority card?  
 
MB: 
No, I think that falls on me, you know, to try and make my point understood and to 
find a way to make my point be understood and why I'm saying what I'm saying is important, 
you know.  
 
VP: 
So, I feel like there are probably some conflicts within the teams that you have to 
resolve. There's a kind of psychology aspect to your job.  
 
MB: 
Yeah, absolutely. And I feel like any sort of leadership is psychology. And, you know, 
de-escalation is a great skill set that you should have as a leader. I feel like, you know. 
 
VP: 
What do the arguments have been around?  
 
[00:28:25] 
 
MB: 
You know, there's a lot of hours, a lot of the time. And, you know, I think people get 
worn out. And I think keeping people from getting burnt out is a critical piece to even 
deescalate before you get to the points of the arguments, you know, and then again, trying to 
take like a firm position on why you think that your position or if somebody disagrees with 
somebody else, why that position might be right and helping everybody understand it clearly. 
Why that is the correct position. I feel like it's probably the best tactic that I use, you know?  
 
VP: 
And what does the company specifically do to make sure that workers don't get 
burned out?  
 
MB: 
I feel like the company does stand out in ways where like if we're doing long hours, 
though, they'll get lunch for the guys, you know, small things to show the appreciation, you 
know, I mean, sure, they're being compensated well, but, you know, they're being 
compensated for and then there's going above and beyond and acknowledging that that's 
happening. And, you know, I also do the same and, you know, reward the guys and, you 
know, work with them when they have family things going on to try and make it happen so 
that we can continue the operation we need, but not to burn out the guys. I feel like listening 
to your employees is absolutely critical and understanding where they're coming from, that 
they have personal lives, you know, that sort of thing.  
 
VP: 
So, what does your typical day look like now? Um, can you walk me through, like, 
what you do in the morning?  
 
[00:29:53] 
 
MB: 
Yeah, sure. I come at like 5:00/5:30 in the morning and I would have to analyze a 
whole bunch of statistics about what we made overnight, what some of the failures might be, 
what we need to line up for the next day or the current day worth of production and a lot of 
reporting first thing in the morning so that everybody gets communicated what our inventory 
levels look like, where we’re low, where we need to get to, what we need to do to move 
ahead. And then, you know, I would make sure after that point, that's why I come before the 
guys start, most of my guys start around 6:00. So, then I get those reports that up and then, 
you know, I talk to my guys, see what they're head space is at, that everybody's OK. First of 
all, you know, go over some safety and then we'll start the day. I'll walk through, make sure 
that the Packer palletizing line is in proper operation, see what we're kind of forecasting for 
the day for shipments. And then, you know, my plant is the whole plant because I'm in charge 
of shipping. We ship out of all plants. So, I have to bounce around, see what sort of 
malfunctions could be possible anywhere else. Then usually I have another meeting at some 
point during the day. There's a morning meeting at 6:30/7:00 and then constantly processing 
data throughout the day, trying to fit in between, you know, the actual investigations and 
inspections that I have to do, all the paperwork that I do, get it all set up, do it like a midday 
report about where we're at to make sure that we're going into the night properly. And then 
we have another meeting. And like I say, in between all of this, just constantly going out, 
communicating with my guys, what's going on? What do we need to make things work 
properly? The sort of thing? Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, a little less walking around the plant. 
 
MB: 
A little less walking around these days that, uh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Do you miss that?  
 
MB: 
A little bit. But, you know, I feel like it's a plus because for my personality, I'm kind 
of a bit of a perfectionist. So, working with a group of four other guys in charge of the same 
group of guys, I feel like there's a lot of opinions and things that are going back and forth, 
whereas now I'm one hundred percent responsible for all of it. And the sacrifice of being out 
on the plant for that ability is a little bit better, in my opinion, because I think, you know, like 
I said before, I do like to push to do the best and stand out. So, it gives me more of an 
opportunity to do that.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is the most challenging part of your job now?  
 
[00:32:22] 
 
MB: 
Ugh, inventory management in a way where sometimes something I can't do or 
something that I can do can't fix it, you know what I mean? So, we have, like, other things 
that feed the finished product. So, something else is failing before my, like, my realm of what 
I can do to fix something is that is a little frustrating where it's like, you know, now I've got to 
explain to customers why something is missing or we're not going to be able to ship 
something. But it's not something that I can directly fix that's kind of frustrating. 
 
VP: 
What kinds of customers do you work with?  
 
MB: 
I do get to work with the sales and logistics teams and the customer service team, and 
they do get to help mitigate that a bit. But we deal with anywhere from, like I say, like DOTs 
to large manufacturers, like we just acquired a new customer Taco Block, which they do like 
Jersey barriers, sidewalks, big, big casting of concrete. And, you know, the there is a 
difference between concrete and cement, which I'm sure you're aware of, but, you know, our 
cement supplies their line. So, Teco Blocks and [unclear] and that's a big thing that I noticed 
that we that we make things like that. There's some customers that do like sewage and water 
drainage and you wouldn't even think of it. But they cast these things and then they just 
excavate and drop these things fully complete, fully assembled. And, you know, and then, of 
course, we deal with masons or people who pour concrete, we have a lot of customers in New 
York that are working on sidewalk skyscrapers, you know, anything, you know, anywhere, 
anywhere in the buildings to underneath, you know. Like, we don't do it here but in 
Evansville, they make what's called oil well cement, which this cement actually would, and I 
never knew this, but when you're like drilling for oil or natural gas, fracking, what they do is 
they put a pipe in and then they pour cement down inside this pipe and then they cast it. Now, 
the oil well takes a long time to set up, but it sets up enough and then they pull the pipe out 
and then they put another pipe through the cement that is now partially formed. It's amazing 
process. And you would never think so this way, that if there's a leak or something, it is 
protected by the cement and the cement is designed to harden on the outside a little bit 
quicker so that it keeps its shape and then they can put the other pipe inside of it. And then 
when it's fully set, if something fails, it's designed to leach out any anything that fails before 
it hits like groundwater.  
 
VP: 
It's everywhere.  
 
MB: 
It's truly everywhere. I think it's like the number two or three commodity in the world. 
I think I think it's the second after water, right? Yeah, it's pretty intense.  
 
VP: 
So, your customers are mostly within the region, right?  
 
MB: 
Oh, yeah. We deal with like the northeast region for this locality. I'm pretty sure that 
the cement industry overall is regionalized, right? So I mean, you could import or whatever, 
but the primary production is just for the region.  
 
VP: 
And so, have you become friends with your coworkers? Do you hang out after work?  
 
[00:35:49] 
 
MB: 
Not yet, I think I'm still a little too you know, I don't know. And I've always been of 
the mindset to take off your work hat when you go home and to take off your home hat when 
you come into work, right? You need to keep them separated because that's how you stay 
sane, you know.  
 
VP: 
Do you think that's like a newer perspective?  
 
MB: 
No, I've had that perspective since I started.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, like the workers, they seem to, you know, as brothers and siblings working and 
fathers and grandfathers. So, they kind of hang out.  
 
MB: 
Yeah, no, that's a I think in the industry I've noticed a lot. This is I don't want to say 
like it's nepotism, but it's like the best word to describe it where there's a lot of father and son 
teams working here. You bring in your brother, you bring in your brother-in-law, you know, 
or your really close friend. You know, there's a there's definitely a lot of that within this 
industry.  
 
VP: 
Has that made it a little bit more challenging for you to enter? Or get additional 
support or supervision or training?  
 
MB: 
You know, I think that, you know, I just have to validate my position. Like I said 
before, you know, the more information you can bring that's correct, then it's irrefutable. It 
doesn't matter, you know, what your relationships are with people and I think that I've 
garnered respect from that perspective.  
 
VP: 
Do you think the industry is changing a little bit? Maybe there's more kind of 
newcomers?  
 
[00:37:17] 
 
MB: 
Oh, yeah, yeah. I've seen, you know, just in the year and a half I've been here that we 
have lost just losing two guys that we lost. We lost probably cumulative 90 years-worth of 
experience, you know, and nowadays I think that with younger guys, I think they're coming 
in and, you know, maybe I'm an example of it, you know, I switched industries. I went from 
banking to heavy industry. And, you know, I'm 35. So that's you know, I've worked two 
industries. You know, one was almost a decade, the other one's three quarters of a decade. 
Who knows if I'll change the industry. I like this industry and I'd like to stay in it. But, you 
know, when opportunities arise, I think that my generation, maybe a little bit older and 
definitely younger, are constantly evolving and looking for new opportunities, whereas I 
think that the old adage was you grew up in an area, you work for that job and you stay at that 
job until you retire.  
 
VP: 
Do you think because you have different industries and bring something new to the 
cement industry?  
 
[00:38:15] 
 
MB: 
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's a completely different perspective. And, you know, I 
think that that's valuable to them as an industry, as a whole, because there's an old way of 
doing things and it might not necessarily be the right way. And, you know, different 
perspectives, different eyes on things. If you're constantly doing the same thing and 
constantly have the same perspective, you might miss something, you know, because things 
do constantly evolve. And if you get stuck in an old way of doing something and then the 
industry evolves by itself, you might be inclined to stick with your old ways and bringing a 
fresh mind definitely helps to adapt to that.  
 
VP: 
Can you think of an example where you, you know, the industry that came up with a 
sort of a different perspective on something in particular in the cement industry?  
 
[00:39:04] 
 
MB: 
Um, well, you know, a lot of the people who are more tenured here, they're not as 
familiar with the automation, right? So, you know, when I was in banking, this is a very 
heavily computer based and then I went to an industry where it was very heavily computer 
based and automated based – I'm working with robots. So, this translated in a way that I 
understood computers, that I could understand computers, the computers and the robots 
enough to be able to decipher the automation. So now coming to this industry, there's a lot of 
moves for heavy automation and a lot of these parts. And that that that brought me on a level 
that I think a lot of guys who have been here for 30 or 40 years, who never dealt with it 
before, that maybe I was above them and in that way.  
 
VP: 
That’s awesome. And, the future.  
 
MB: 
Right, exactly, exactly.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much. Is there something that I haven't asked or something you 
would like to say before we close out?  
 
[00:40:08] 
 
MB: 
No, just that maybe, you know, I think that cement remains an integral part to the 
future of development of humanity because they're definitely open minded to the green 
movement, you know, and I think that it's a very green product. And, you know, when we 
excavate and mine, I don't know if you've heard of, like, quarry restoration projects where 
they actually, like, add water and they will then stock it with fish and leave it to become, like, 
a natural lake. So, you know, they're constantly even though they're taking from the earth and 
returning to the earth. And I think the push to the green movement is a great example of that 
to where they're constantly trying to regenerate and replenish as they extract from the earth. 
 
VP: 
Is Lehigh working on that? 
 
MB: Oh, yeah, we have quarries on site where you could see that it's completely restored to a 
lake. Yeah. So, you know, I think it's pretty nifty.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much.
