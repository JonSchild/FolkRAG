MY LOVE SHE IS A COOK. 
I 
wonder where my Susie is 
She said she would meet me here; 
It's been a 
half an hour or more, 
And still she don't appear. 
There's something must the matter be, 
Or she ‘vould not stay away ; 
I 
have not seen her loving face, 
A week ago to day. 
CHORUS. 
o 
my love she is a 
cook, 
She has such winning ways; 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0 
yes, I 
love my Susie dear, 
Although she's but a 
cook; 
For she has such winning ways, 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0, Jimmy, you'll exense me, 
For I 
could not come last night; 
My sister's cat was very sick, 
And the dog had got the gripes. 
But don't forget to- morrow, 
About the hour of half-past two; 
And IT be in the kitchen, love, 
Awaiting there for you. 
CHORUS. 
My Susie she is handsome, 
She is upon my word ; 
She dances like a 
fairy, 
And sings just like a 
bird. 
My Susie says she loves tne, 
And I 
know she loves me too; 
And if she would prove false to me, 
It would break my heart in two.

It's really very singular, 
I 
cannot make it out, 
I've many beaux, yet none propose, 
What are they all about; 
They say I 
have a 
handsome face, 
And purely Grecian nose, 
Yet seeing this, it's quite amiss, 
That none of them propose. 
There's Doctor Gray he calls each day, 
To dinner and to doze, 
I 
u.Ake his tea, he smiles on me, 
And yet he don't propose. 
Cnoaus.—Oh, it's really very singular, 
I 
cannot make it out, 
I've many beaux, yet none propose, 
What are they all about? 
They say I 
have a 
handsome face, 
And purely Grecian nose, 
Yet seeing this, it's quite amiss, 
That none of them propose. 
And Simkins he's a 
bashful man, 
He's very thin and tall; 
At dinner he is by my side, 
My shadow at each ball. 
He pays me great attention, 
Without the slightest doubt; 
Yet marriage does not mention, 
What are they all about ? 
He sends me scented billetdeux, 
In poetry and prose; 
He smiles and sighs, looks very wise, 
And yet he don't propose. 
Oh it's really, dm. 
There's Colonel Jones, a 
handsome man, 
Declares I.waltz divine, 
And when I'm out at ball or rout, 
ev'ry one outshine. 
Says my lips excel the cherry, 
My cheeks would shame the ruse; 
Say- I 
ie accomplished very, 
I 
ill he don't propose. 
Papa h . thinks it very hard, 
That out of all the beaux, 
Who come to dine and drink his wine, 
That none of them propose. 
Oh it's really, &c.

Now I

Edged with fringe of golden brown.

Brought sweet messages from God; 
Two pale 11ps with kisses press'd, 
There we left her to her rest; 
And the dews of ev'ning weep, 
Where we laid her down to sleep. 
Over there, just over there, 
List the angers morning pray'r; 
Lispings low thro' fancy creep, - 
Now I

THE DARING SLACK ,WIR.E. 
-good evening, my friends, I'll- have you- to, know, 
I went to a 
cincus, a 
short time ago. 
While in my box gazing all about, 
Some fellow by my si-de like a 
bear shouted out. 
Spoken.—Yes, when I 
saw the fair creature so high up ir) 
the air, I 
could not,helpin the midst of my excitement shout.

CHORUS: 
Look where she goes,. 
My own Sophia. 
Swinging, by Jove, 
On the daring slack wire. 
Turn him out, turn him out, turn him out, if you please. 
When two talt policemen poor Jerry did seize, 
They hug him, they tug him, they pull him about, 
But still from his box he continued to shout, 
Look where she goes, dm. 
The shouting and bawling or poor old Jeremiah, 
Caused Sophia to start as she stood on the wire ; 
Her little foot slipped, and as downward she fell, 
And these were the words that poor Jerry did yell. 
Look where she falls, 
My own Sophia, 
Falling, by Jove, 
From off the slack wire. 
Sophia broke her fan, and as she was descending; 
Showers of bouquets at her feet came rending. 
They kicked out poor Jerry, for he was defeated, 
And this was the chorus the company repeated) 
Look where he goes 
Poor Jeremiah, 
Kicked out, by Jove,

New York. Price 40 Coutsej 
Out in this told world, out in the street, 
Asking a 
penny of each one I 
meet, 
ShoeleSs I 
wander about, thro' the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
No one to help me, no one to love, 
No one to pity me, none to caress— 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam; 
A child of misfortune, I'm driven from home. 
CHORUS. 
No one to help me, no one to bless, 
No one to pity me, none to caress; 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
-Nursed by my poverty, driven from hotels. 
'The flowers that bloomed, that I 
loved to see, 
Seem bowing their heads as if pitying me; 
The music that mingles with voices of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and poor— 
And I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock -at the door; 
Turn a 
deaf ear, there's no one will come 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from home. 
No one to help me, &c. 
Oh! where shall I 
go, or what can I 
do 
I've tio one to tell me what course to pursue: 
I'm weary and footsore, I'm hungry arid weak, 
I 
know not what shelter to night I 
may seek. 
The Friend of all friends, who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me; 
I'll wander about, till His messenger conies 
To lead me to father and mother at home, 
No one to help me, dr,e,

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
Oftitnes the world may laugh, and jeer at what Fm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in ease of a 
rainy 
day; 
Tor if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, 'tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CfrOltriS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down Nvith strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, dr,c. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
wonld teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe: " Toucl»mthing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best, policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, /cc. 
A pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not now how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, dm 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like myfriends to call, 
Though the hest of friends I've ever found, was my pocket, 
after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin, 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, tEc. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when 
you're poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the 
door; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say. 
Look out for number one, that is— put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, ko. 
1.1 
THERE'S NONE LIKE A MOTHER, IF EVER SO 
POOR.. 
You tell me that you love me, I 
fain would believe, 
And '
will make me your bride and never deceive: 
You offer to me your heart and your hand, 
And make me the mistress of houses and land. 
I 
am but a 
poor girl, the truth I 
will tell, 
My mother's a 
widow, in Yen cottage cloth dwell, 
She who nursed me iii sickness, with little in store, 
Now I'll never desert her because she is poor. 
You have promised me servants and carriages so gay, 
And perhaps to deceive me, and lead me astray, 
For some men they will flatter to destroy a 
girl's name, 
And SOOTI she's reduced to a 
sad life of shame; 
And then she's insulted by each passer-by, 
Her life is a 
burden, slie could lay down and die, 
While here em I 
contented, by oar own cottage door. 
There's none like a 
mother if ever so poor. 
My dear father's words still ring in my ea, 
When dying he bid me my Maker to fear, 
And be kind to my mother, from her never part, 
If I 
were to leave her, it would break her heart. 
Still if we were to marry I 
should lead a 
sad life, 
When your friends, that are rich, knew you'd got a 
poor wife, 
Your parents might slight me, it has been so before, 
I'll not leave my mother, altho' she is poor. 
But if I 
were your equal, with wealth to command 
I'd willingly give you my heart and my hand, 
And sooth every sorrow, dispel every care, 
For there's truth in your face—I 
believe you're sincere 
If 3.-our parents would bleSs us, and give their consent. 
We would all live together in peace and content, 
Then my poor aged mother should sorrow no more, 
Vor their's none liken mother, be she rich or poor.

A VIRGIN, ONLY 19 YEARS OLD. [CoNcLuDED.] 
IIer fingers were taper'd, her neck like the swan, 
Her nose was a 
turn-up, and her voice not too strong; 
In three weeks we were married, and the wedding bells told 
That I'd married a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years oldl 
The wedding-party broke up, and we retired to rest, 
But my hair stood right up when my bride she undress'd; 
For a 
cartload of padding my young bride did unfold, 
A 
thing rather peculiar, very peculiar, for 19 years old I 
First, she took off her right foot, about a 
foot wide, 
Then she unscrewed her left ear and laid it aside, 
Then she pull'd out her right eye, on the carpet it roll'd; 
Thinks I, here's a 
virgin—what a 
virgin, only 19 years old I 
Next she unscrewed her right leg as far as the knee, 
Then pull'd off her fingers, I 
counted just three; 
Then on her left shoulder a 
large lump I 
did behold, 
So I 
said, there's a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years old l 
When she wiped off her eyebrows I 
thought I 
should faint, 
And scraped from her thin cheeks a 
eartload of paint; 
When she pull'd off her black wig then her bald pate soon told 
That she was an old virgin, an old virgin, more than 19 years oxa I 
When she pull'd out her false teeth, I 
jumped up in terror, 
For her nose and her chin very near stuck together, 
From the chamber I 
stepp'd it, never more to behold 
This virgin not niueteen,--no, not nineteen, but 99 years old I 
Now, young men, take warning, e'er to church you go, 
Be sure your wife's perfect from the top to the toe, 
Or you'll pay for your folly, and like me be sold 
By some patch'd-up old virgin, cruel old virgin,'bout 99 years old

CLING TO THOSE WHO CLING TO YOU, 
There are many friends of summer, 
Who are kind while flowers bloom, 
But when winter chills the blossoms, 
They depart with the perfume ; 
On the broad highway of action, 
Friends of worth are far and few, 
So when one has proved his friendship, 
Cling to him who clings to you. 
CHORUS. 
On the broad highway of nation, 
Friends of worth are far and few, 
So when one has proved his friendship. 
Cling to him who clings to you. 
Do not harshly judge your neighbor, 
Do not deem his life untrue, 
If he makes no great pretensions 
Deeds are great though words are few; 
Those who stand amid the tempest, 
Firm as when the skies are blue, 
Will be friends while life endureth, 
Cling to those who cling to you. 
On the broad, dze. 
When you see a 
worthy brother, 
Buffeting the stormy main, 
Lend a 
Iftlping hand fraternal, 
Till be reach the shore again ; 
Dun% desert the old and tried friend, 
When misfortune comes in view, 
Per he then needs friendship, comfort, 
Cling to those who cling to you. 
On the broad, Arc. 
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS YOURSELF.

The fairest girl in all the world, 
Has oft been praised in song, 
But all who say they've seen the one, 
I 
tell yJu must be wrong; 
The girl I 
love outshines tie rest, 
A perfect darling elf, 
I'd like to tell you where she lives, 
But you know how it is yourself. 
CHORUS. 
Lnever can, I 
never will, 
My charmer's name reveal, 
For only those who love like me, 
Can tell just how I 
feel; 
I 
love her for her charms alone, 
And not for gain or wealth, 
Tho' both would suit me just as well, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
(Dance.) 
The first time that ACC ever met, 
Was at Delmonico's, 
She thought that I 
had lots of cash, 
She judged me by my clothes. 
The waiter brought me in a 
bill, 
That wasted all my wealth: 
I 
paid it thou(rh it sent me broke, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
I 
never can, &to. 
I 
called one day to see my love, 
And quickly rang the bell, 
My charmer she came to the door 
When on my knees I 
fell. 
A lengthy tale of love I 
told, 
Quite free from thoughts of sett, 
Of course I 
won her on the spot, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
I 
never can, ct.c.

When she was called to heaven away? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray; 
I

She whispered softly: " Keep my child—" 
And then they told me she was dead !

Now, ere I

Within my heavenly Father's care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep,

To keep my soul in paths of right— 
Oh! let me thank him for his love, 
Ere I

In her " litte bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
And a

Close beside her mother's lonely tomb 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed' away, 
Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day. 
CHORUS. 
Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow. 
Far too lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is free from mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strokes again her darling's head, 
And, amid angelic music, 
Lays her in her little bed. 
Little birdie, dre.

Reunited ne'er to part, 
In the angel home above us, 
Let this cheer our mournful heart.

IT'S NAUGHTY, BUT IT'S NICE.—[0oNetuDn. 
Last night I 
called at Westbourne Grove, 
And asked if she would go 
A 
walk, and we would talk of love; 
At first she answered, " No 1" 
Then consented, and we walked and talked— 
I 
thought it paradise,— 
But she said 'twas wrong; I 
answered,— 
Well, it's naughty, but it's nice.—Cuo. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
Her form I 
gently pressed; 
And then she laid her lovely face 
T.Tpon,my manly chest. 
I 
kiss'd her two times on the cheek, 
I 
would have kissed her thrice, 
But I 
whispered, Ain't it naughty ! 
She said, Yes, but it's so nice.—Cno. 
To-day she asked if she might wed, 
IIer ma exclaimed, My dear! 
You must not think of marrying Fred 
For many and many a 
year: 
It's wicked, miss, your pa and ma 
And home to sacrifice. 
To get married—well, I 
know, said she, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Ciro.— If you think marriage wicked, ma, 
You're guilty of that vice; 
You perhaps may call it naughty, 
But you also know it's nice. 
Tier parents have consented, and 
In two years she -will be 
.Mv wife; so Dow you know my tale: 
I 
hope you will give to me 
The same applause, that from you all 
So often 1 
entice; 
It's naughty p'rhaps to ask it, 
But to get it is so niec.—Cuo.

in a 
graceful pose reclineth, a

Se enchanting was the picture, 1 
could not pass it by, 
But I 
stood as if a 
statue, for beauty charms the eye ; 
Then I 
saw that she was reading, to while away the time, 
And my anxious gaze unheeding, beneath the woodbine vine.

stood like one bewilder'd. what course could I

With her loveliness enraptured, I 
knew not what to do, 
As a

While in eestacy I 
grasp'd it, fair maid, your fan I've found,

carmine, 
And the sweetly said she'd meet me, beneath the woodbine

But I

The appointed time for meeting, was Sunday night at eight, 
Arid what happened on that evening, to you I 
will relate; 
Now her Pa and Ma were absent, ate

she was left alone, 
As her parents gave their consent that she might stay at 
home ; 
So she played the grand piano, I 
sang and danced in time, 
And we sat on the veranda, beneath the woodbine vine. 
But I 
love her so, 'Sze. 
There we met, we loved, we parted, my heart with joy cloth

For to me she breathed a 
secret, with darling don't you tell, 
But I 
soon became acquainted with her Papa and Ma, 
She's in ev'ry vision painted, my love, my euiding star. 
Now my story's almost ended. I've married Caroline, 
And we live where once we flirted, beneath the woodbine vine

And read what they've to say 
About this forward youth they call,

how much they'd like to know, 
Of how— with such a 
little coin— 
I 
make so fine a 
show. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the " Young man of the day,"

As good am I, as those gone by,

THE GIRL - OP- THE PERIOD.—[CoNcLunrn.) 
We pride ourselves on fine chignon, 
And charming style of hat; 
Which those strange men may smile upon, 
But we don't care much for that: 
We make " /a

Are first in fashion's field; 
And, 'spite the men, we'll so remain, 
And sooner die than yield.

Our style attracts attention as 
We promenade the Park; 
Men tremble when they meet us

His words with great delight. 
lIe told us. 0 
such glorious things. 
Did pious Brother Flinn ; 
That we thought no place could ever equal 
New Jerusalani, 
Cruel Jane, &. 
He told us how each happy Saint, 
ad lots of happy wives; 
I 
thought they'd tight, but, oh, dear no! 
They led such happy lives. 
They liv'd on turtle. duck and green peas, 
Fricassed fruit and " Chain ;" 
For tho Saints they liv'd like fighting cocks, 
In this New Jerusakun. 
My wife was always at me, 
To become a 
Mormon Saint; 
Said I, .• Don't take me for a 
fool, 
Jemima, 'cause I 
ain t.' 
Alas! one night I 
utiss'd her, 
And was told that Brother Flam, 
Bad taken my Jemima off 
To New Jerusalam. 
Cruel Jane, &c. 
Cruel Jane, &c. 
She's gone to be a 
Saintress, 
With that blessed -Mennonite; 
And if he's got another wile, 
There's sure to be a

I 
hope she'll get the worst of it, 
And as f

ROLLIN HOWARD'S FAMOUS GRECIAN BEND. 
A sweeping trail with ribbon catch, 
A hat that you can't see; 
With handsome ornaments to match, 
And lots of finery. 
Attired with kids and parasol ; 
A fair one to me send; 
And I 
will show you, 'pen my soul, 
The fatuous Grecian Bend. 
Cnonus—The Grecian Bend, the Grecian Bend, 
The famous Grecian Bend ! 
And I

The other eve, some lady friend, 
That had become a " Greek.;" 
Said unto me, in accents wild, 
If thieves should -ever seek 
To take front me what I 
possess, 
I'd not with them contend ; 
But boldly cry, ta-:o all I 
have, 
But spare my " Grecian Bend."

"But boldly cry take all I

But spare toy Grecian Bend." 
'Miss Dinah Snow," of sable hue, 
In festive style arrayed; 
Came bit ring down the avenue, 
The Grecian she displayed. 
Accosting her in sportive mood, 
She thus to me appeals ;

Her dress was in a

Looped up so gay and neat, 
And as she went across the way,

•ALL _AMONG THE HAY.--[CoscLumw.) 
She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admied; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
All among the bay. 
CHORES.—All among the hay, cto. 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then 
all right;" 
She said " to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astound, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
" 
Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the hay." 
ClIORUS.—All among the hay, &e. 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be, 
I 
would not be " sold ;" 
Bouncing came a 
rival raw, 
But I 
made him " pay," 
Thrash'd him like a 
load of straw, 
All among the hay. 
CHORUS.—All among the hay, cte. 
Still I 
press'd, and she " gave in," 
Owning she was wrong;

Woman with his tongue; 
Soon the bells will peal their notes 
On our wedding day; 
Then I'll sow my wildest " oats"

I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT, BUT 
THEY DO. 
Words by Lecas P. 
Music by IINKBY 
As I 
look round about, my head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see the world so greatly changed since I 
was but a 
girl; 
Old notions out of date they're all made over new— 
And yet, l'm sure, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do 
CHORUS. 
Oh! times are changed about, and everything is new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do; 
Yes, times are changed about, and everything is new— 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do. 
Men used to live upon what honestly they made, 
But now they rather seem to live upon their debts unpaid; 
In style they swell about their creditors in view— 
It puzzles me, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh I 
times are changed, &c. 
Once on a 
time young men were steady and upright, 
In "sporting" now they spend their time, and in it take 
delight; 
Thu drive about fast teams, on governor's money, too— 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh 1 
times are changed, &c. 
Young ladies now are not like those I 
used to know, 
When I 
was young we waited till sought after by a 
beau; 
But now things are reversed, they're going all askew— 
The girls propose 1 
I 
don't know how they do it, but they do.

AS GOOD AS GOLD. 
By J. IL IfiumaN. 
Though fond of jollity sometimes,' 
I 
like a 
quiet life, 
And love a 
cosy ev'ning pass'd, 
At home with my old. wife; 
She brought me neither house nor land. 
Her wealth could soon be told, 
But she's a 
fortune in herself, 
And that's as good as gold. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she's as good as gold, she is, 
She's just as good as gold, 
And I 
can see she's fond of me, 
For she's as good as gold. 
She does not wear the finest robes, 
Nor dres4 in silk at tire, 
But then if she looks fair to me, 
What more can I 
desire, 
Our house is not the grandest, but, 
As it keeps out the cold, 
It pleases me and pleases her, 
And she's as good as gold. 
Yes, she's, &a. 
When matters go a 
little wrong, 
And fortune seems to frown, 
If one's a 
wife as good as gold, 
One can't be long east down; 
For when I 
reach my home at night, 
She does not fret or scold, 
But always greets me with a 
smile, 
And that's as good as gold. 
For she's, &e. 
Contented folks are happier, 
Than those who've greatest wealth, 
For gull does not buy happiness, 
Nor can it purchase health ; 
My wife and I 
will be content, 
When we have grown old, 
To be as happy then as now, 
And that's as good as gold.

For she's, clzo.

THE GAL THAT TOOK NY EYE. 
Song and Dance, written by JERRY COHAN, for BILLY Asncnorr. 
As I 
was walking down the street the other afternoon, 
Pulled on my kids, lit my sheroot, in front of a 
saloon, 
When a 
vision floated past my sight which caused the dust to 
fly, 
'Twas the prettest girl I 
ever saw, the gal that took my eye. 
CHORUS. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare [Dance. 
I 
feel so queer, when I 
am near, 
The gal that took my eye. 
I 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame; 
I 
quickly waved my handkerchief, of course she done the same. 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side: " Your pardon, Miss, said I. 
If I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but then you took my eye." 
Chorus and Dance. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, when we stood at her door; 
She said she'd no olljection, but her parents they were poor. 
But I 
dont mind such trifles for to win her I 
shall try, 
And if I 
do I'll show to you the gal what took my eye. 
She was so fair, &c. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
Her father is an artist, that is, in the white wash line. 
Her mother keeps an oyster stand, her fruit is very fine ; 
The gal is in a 
restaurant, nice dougimuts she does fry, 
And every night when we walk out them doughnuts take my 
eye. 
She was so fair, ctc. 
ALTER YOUR HAIR, GIRLS; 
OR, ACT ON THE SQUIRE. 
What lots of change there is about, 
There's plenty every day, 
Except the ready change in cash, 
For all to pay their way. 
Now lad ies' hair, I 
do declare, 
Makes me think as I 
stray. 
Thab they have not got all their change 
About them in this way. 
CHORUS 
Act on the square, girls! act on the square 
Ceignons throw away I 
wear your own hair! 
Alter your hair, girls ! alter your hair I 
Ringlets, or plain, girls—act on the square / 
The Lair wAs worn in days now gone, 
In ringlets, curls or plaits ; 
The next it hung down ladies' backs, 
Like cocoa- fibre mats. 
Now, like hedgehogs roll'd up on heads, 
It h,oks, I 
do declare, 
And all young urchins shout 
And say, " I'll have your hair I" 
Act on the square, girls, &a 
Could our old grandmothers revive, 
And walk about, I 
vow, 
They'd go in fits of fright, to see 
The style of head-dress now. 
Let people smile about the style, 
Of dresses thlt you wear, 
Tho' wags may teitze, wear what you please, 
But do wear your own hair. 
Act on the square, girls, ctc. 
To build huge rolls upon thin polls, 
Some, of their own whose short, 
'Twould make their own stand up to know 
Where all the false is bought. 
From unions, jails, and workhouses, 
It comes, so girls, beware 
Or you'll get stramse things in your beads, 
So, do alter your hair. 
Act on the square, girls, tbs.

WILL SHE LET NE KISS HER 
I' 
When sitting by my darling's side, 
She promised soon to be my bride; 
With smiles that nearly set me 
In ectacies they were so sweet, 
My heart began to pant and beat, 
I 
whispered will she let me kiss her ? 
Will she let me, will she let me kiss her ? 
quick encircled with my arm, 
Her waist ( now sure I 
meant no harm 
To her who oft did pet me,) 
She tried to get herself away, 
She smiled and frowned yet looked so gay, 
That I 
nonplussed for what to say, 
Just murmured will she let me kiss her ? 
Will she let me, will she let me ks her ? 
”sro. 4 P 
I 
gazed within her love-lit eye, 
Whose drooping lashes made me sigh, 
" 
Can eyes so pure forget me?" 
0, no, they never can, for they, 
In every glance do EMMA to say, 
"For thee I 
live, for thee I 
pray r 
Then surely she will let me kiss her I 
Surely let me, yes, she'll let me kiss her I 
Enraptured at my own request, 
She dropped her head upon my breast; 
And made such thoughts beset me, 
That I 
bewildered, plunged in bliss, 
Sighed " Surely there is Heaven in this," 
And here I 
stole a 
long sweet Liss, 
And found edag ! She'd let me kiss her / 
Yes she let me, truly, foLdly kiss her

FOLLOW DIE IF YOU DARE, 
saw her first at Brown's great race„ 
Held at the skating rink, 
And as I 
met her face to face, 
She gave me such a 
wink; 
I 
really felt a 
sudden pang, 
Right through my heart of heartsi 
As thoii7h l 
had been shot kerbang, 
With one of Cupid's darts. 
CETOILV& 
The glance I 
gave, she did receive, 
With the most bewitching air, 
Then turned about, and took French leave,

met her next at Russel's store,. 
She knew me at a 
glance, 
And as she- winked at me before, 
I 
said now is my chince; 
To catch this charming fair haired 
And take her out to dine, 
To vow I 
love her flaunting mils, 
And ask hcr to, be mine. 
But when I 
touched her on the sleeve, 
She smiled with a 
charming air, 
And suddenly turned, and took French leave:. 
With a " Follow me if you. dare.' 
The glance- I 
gave, & c... 
I 
caught her walking Tremont street„ 
My glance she quickly met, 
I 
turned- about in an odd way, 
An interview to get;

INO.LOW ME IF YOU DARE. [CONCLUDElij 
But she -kept on, though once or twice, 
She turned and smiled at me, 
Who really thought it very nice, 
To fellow her home to tea; 
My anxious heart she could relieve, 
If for me she had a 
care, 
But a 
smile was all, and a 
French leave, 
With a " Follow me, if you dare." 
The glance I 
gave, 8zo 
She reached her home, and -at the door, 
She turned and winked at me, 
What I 
supposed meant something moro, 
So I 
followed her in to see; 
'Her husband met me in the hall, 
He saw my little game, 
For suddenly I 
felt a 
fall, 
Which sent me home quite lame. 
Look out for her, she will deceive, 
This girl with the golden hair; 
She flirts awhile, then takes French leave, 
With a " Follow me, if you dare," 
The glance I 
gave,&0" 
The moral of my song is this, 
To it lei all take heed, 
When you are searching after bliss, 
And flirt just what you need. 
Be sure the charming girl you seek, 
Whose curls you so admire, 
Does not with all her smiles so meek, 
With a 
husband thus conspire. 
For this is now the style, believe, 
Of the girls with the golden hair; 
They lure you on, they take French leave, 
With a " Follow me, if you dare."

She's the pride of this great city, and she's got the sweetest

I 
met her on the Avenue, one sunny afternoon,. 
And in passing, by she gave a

You ought to see the people stare, they didn't know what tei

To see me promenading with this pretty little pink.

My place the fellows envied, the girls were jealous too;

They couldn't win from me my love, sweet Jennie Jerusha Jane..

" 
That little church around the corner," 
Ilow dear to me the spot! 
And Om' far o'er the earth I 
wander, 
It ne'er can be forgot, 
'Twas there in childhood's days I 
listened 
To the songs I 
loved 80 well ; 
And there I 
learned of God and heaven, 
Where holy angels ever dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The sun may shine, the cb ,nds may darken, 
No gloom this life can cast ; 
That little church around the corner, 
Will take me home at last. 
Alas! the days that were so sunny, 
have slowly passed away; 
And clouds have gathered o'er my pathway, 
Old friends no longer stay. 
Yet still I 
hear the sweet birds singing, 
'Round above the old church door; 
And holy hymns glad thoughts are bringing, 
To cheer my heart forever more 
•••• 
The sun may, &c. 
I 
care not how the world may darken, 
Or earthly friends prove cold ; 
I 
know there is a 
future for me, 
, Within my Father's fold. 
And when my soul shall leave its casket, 
Free from all life's sun or storm; 
That little church around the corner, 
Shall welcome home my mortal form. 
The sun may, .5c,c. 
OR, THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN. 
I'M NUMBER ONE, 
I 
know I'm not a 
handsome man, 
My eyes they are not grand, 
My waist it is not slender, 
And five feet eight I 
stand. 
I've fourteen thousand pounds a 
year, 
My weight is fourteen stone, 
And now I'm worth my weight in gold, 
I 
will be number one. 
CHORUS. 
So it's no matter where I 
go, 
The Park or in Broadway, 
I'll let the public know, 
That I 
am number one. 
I 
sometimes go behind the scenes, 
I'm well known to the stars, 
I 
love to lounge at fancy fairs, 
And patronize bazaars. 
I 
never, never criticise, 
Or condescend to pun, 
I 
leave all that to diners out, 
I 
must be number one. 
So ifs, &c. 
Except kid gloves I 
never bet, 
At " play," rtn never seen, 
Cabmen treat me with respect, 
And why 2— I'm never mean I 
I 
never condescend to " chaff," 
Altho' I'm fond of fun, 
And slang is quite unknown to me, 
Because I'm number one. 
So it's, &O. 
I 
once was but the younger born, 
Alone at play or ball, 
Five hundred pounds a 
year my lot, 
Avoided then by all. 
Yes, some would glance disdainfully, 
Others coldly shun. 
I 
scorn them now, and let them see 
That I 
am number one.

_A turn for married life,

So my advice is simply this, 
To " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, (ke.

BE KIND TO THE LOV'D ONES AT HOME. 
By I. B. WoermuleY. 
Be kind to thy father, for when th ii wert young, 
Who lov'd thee so fondly as he ? 
He cauelit the first accents that fell from thy tongue 
And joined in thy innocent glee. 
Be hind to thy father, for now he is old 
II is locks intermingled with gray; 
ills footsteps are feeble, once fearless and bold. 
Thy father is passing awkty. 
Be kind to thy mother—for lo I 
on her brew 
May traces of sorrow be seen; 
Oh I 
well may'st thou cherish and comfort her now, 
For loving and kind bath she been. 
Remember thy mother, for thee will she pray, 
As long as God giveth her breath ; 
With accents of kindness then cheer her lone way, 
E'en to the dark valley of death. 
Be Mild to thy brother—his heart will have dearth, 
If the smile of thy joy be withdrawn ; 
The flowers of feeling will fade at their birth, 
If the dew of affection be gone, 
Be kind to thy brother, wherever you are, 
The love of a 
brother shall be 
An ornament purer and richer by far 
Than pearls from the depth of the sea. 
Be kind to thy sister—not many may known 
The depth of true sisterly love; 
The wealth of the ocean lies fathoms below 
The surface that sparkles above. 
Be kind to thy father, once fearless and bold, 
Be kind to thy mother SO VP(Ir 
Be kind to ihy brother, nor show thy heart cold. 
Be kind to thy sister so dear.

am dreaming, 
And the honor I 
shall get, 
With a

And a

And a

Yes, I

We will march away to morrow, 
At the breaking of the day,

And the trmnpets will be sounding, 
And the merry cymbals play. 
Yet, before I 
say good bye, 
And a 
last sad parting take, 
As a 
proof of your love, 
Wear this gift for my sake; 
Then, cheer up, my own Lizette, 
Let not grief your beauty stain, 
Soon you'll see the recruit again, 
Soon you'll see the recruit again. 
Shame I

While there's fame in store for me, 
While there's fame in store for me, 
Think when home I

When to church you're fondly led, 
Like some lady smartly drest, 
And a 
hero you shall wed, 
With a

But with welcome will salute,

The pretty little infant there, who's playing with a

You see that pensive piebald child, that interesting pet, 
Takes first prize at the show, and takes whatever he can get. 
The baby show, &c. 
That olive branch, of six months old, although he cannot speak, 
Can read and write, and understands his Latin and his Greek; 
The next child, only ten days old, has grown so very stout, 
lie takes his mother in his arms and carries her about. 
The baby show, &e. 
The next one is a 
knowing child, he must be, for he states, 
" 
That though his mother whacks and loves, his doctor whacks an 
ates; " 
The way he bit his aged nurse brought tears into her eyes, 
lie says, " That as lie is a 
twin he's sure ewin a 
prize." 
The baby show, AL e. 
That boy there is a 
little girl, just two foot high of age, 
She's took to drinking, and with her the bottle's all the rage ; 
That other child does nothing else but suck his little thumbs, 
Just put your finger in his mouth, you'll bless his little gums. 
The baby show, dr.e. 
It's feeding time; step in to see the pretty little dears, 
But if your nerves are weak at all, you'd better stop your ears ; 
Then, when we think you've seen enough, we give a 
hint to go, 
And pinch the children till they cry, which clears the baby show.

THE BLIND GIRL. 
By 
I. 
N. 
METCALF. 
They say this world is beautiful, 
More fair than thoughts of love; 
And nightly comes an angel hand, 
That writes in gold above ; 
But eh 1 'tis viewless all to me, 
As the softly breathing wind, 
I 
cannot see those beauteous scenes 
For I 
am blind, I'm blind. 
I 
never saw the bird that sings 
So sweetly to mine ear, 
Nor snowy shroud that winter weaves, 
Around the dying year; 
All nature is a 
sealed book, 
Whose clasp I 
cannot find, 
'Twas never meant for me to read, 
For I 
am blind, I'm blind. 
But alt I 
they tell me far away, 
In bright eternity, 
There is a 
land o'erspread with flowers, 
Which every eye can see; 
Where skies are ever soft and blue, 
And silver streamlets wind ; 
Oh I 
when I 
reach that holy shore 
I 
shall no more be blind.

was dreaming, 
When I 
went up in a

Along with Betsy Bangle, 
To take tea with The Man in the Moon. 
The Girl of the Period was there, 
With the Young Man of the Day; 
Saying Don't you wish that you was me, 
For I'm going to be married to-day. 
CELORTI.S.—For these are the comic songs, 
As sung at the present time; 
I've put them together so clever, my Boys, 
And sing them all in rhyme. 
The Great Men said, Turn him out, 
But Don't you run away ; 
With the Pride of Baker's Row, 
And be found All among the hay. 
Said the Reek etty Swell to the Polisher's Daughter, 
Courting was the worst of fun ; 
And went strolling in the Burlington, 
To be thought the Swell A. 1. [For these are. &c. 
I 
never go East of Temple Bar, 
Except Down Petticoat Lane, 
To see the Shokeloney swell, 
For she sighs for him in vain.

We'll go to Rosherville; 
With my own Sweet Susan Jane, 
And the Man that can't keep still. [ For these areAct 
Up in the Monument, I

THE DEAREST SPOT. 
By Wino 
IITON. 
The dearest spot of earth io me, 
Is home, sweet home; 
The fairy land I've longed to see, 
Is home, sweet home. 
There how charm'd the sense of hearing, 
There where hearts are so endearing, 
All the world is not so cheering, 
As home, sweet home. 
I've taught my heart the way to prize 
My home, sweet home ; 
I've learned to look with lover's eyes 
On home, sweet home. 
There, where vows are truly plighted, 
There, where hearts are so united, 
All the world besides I've slighted, 
For home, sweet home. 
WHERE ARE THE FRIENDS OF NY YOUTH? 
By GEORGE BARKER. 
Where are the friends of my youth, 
Say where are those cherishd ones gone, 
And why have they dropp'd with the leaf, 
Ali, why have they left me to mourn ; 
Their voices still sound in mine ear, 
Their features I 
see in my dreams, 
And the world is a 
wilderness (freer, 
As a 
wide spreading desert it seems. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, where are the friends of my youth, 
Ah, where are the cherished ones gone, 
And why have they dropp'd as the leaf, 
Ah why have they left me to mourn. 
Say, can I 
ever again, 
Such ties can I 
ever renew, 
Or feel those warm pulses again, 
Which beat for the dear ones I 
knew; 
The world as a 
winter is cold, 
Etch charm seems to vanish away 
v 
heart is now blighted and old, 
It shares in all nature's decay, 
Ah where, cte. 
CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
First introauced and sung in America by W. F. S. LAwLoa. 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing here but troubles, hardship, toil and woo; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the 'best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some got wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat ; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may tlury be proudof him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
When first his plays came on the stage, lie made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find his sayings are so wise, each sentiment so true ; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as ifyou had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles iuthe Air. 
Ent yet there is another name, to Scot chmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world to him bad been, a 
world full or care ; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny noon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm snre. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he had his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wil' cherish yet his songs ; 
Ile made the Irish heart rejoice, lie bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air. 
THE FASCINATING SWELL. 
Oh, here I 
am again, my boys, 
Just take a 
look at me; 
A nobbv, fascinating swell, 
So jolty ?
Old SO free. 
The pet of all the girls am I," 
As any one can tell; 
Indeed they've all gone crazy o'er 
This fascinating swell. 
For they can't resist my figure, boys, 
It's the style that suits so well; 
The girls are going crazy o'er 
This fascinating swell. 
If on Broadway I 
chance to go, 
To take a 
little walk; 
The ladies all stare at me so, 
And then commence to talk. 
They smile and say, " Oh, ain't he sweetr 
And then each charming belie. 
Will heave a 
sigh as they pass by 
This fascinating swell. 
For they can't resist, &e.. 
At all the balls and parties, 
I 
am always to be found; 
For where the girls do congregate, 
You'll find me, I'll be bound. 
And there I 
trill the light fantastic, 
With some charming- belle ; 
Who talks sweet loving nonsense to 
This fascinating swell. 
For they can't resist, it& 
But soon a 
married man I'll be, 
For Cother day as 
Was walking out, I 
chanced to see 
A pretty girl go by. 
She winked at one. I 
winked at her, 
Then straight in love she fell ; 
With Charles Augustus Fitz de Gray, 
The fascinating swell. 
For they can't resist, /
