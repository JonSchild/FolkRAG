Jill Breit interview with Dave Vincent, Burke, NY 
Field Notes 
Interview with Dave Vincent, Burke, New York 
Interviewer: Jill Breit 
Date: March 20, 2013 
Burke is located a few miles from Malone, New York, in Franklin County.  The county fair described by 
Laura Ingalls Wilder in her book Farmer Boy took place in Malone.  The Wilder Farm is located in Burke, 
and now operated as a museum.  This is the milieu in which the Vincent Family has farmed for 
generations.  Their operation on the Vincent Rd. is a designated “Dairy of Distinction.” 
When I arrived at the Vincent Farm, I initially stepped into the cow barn, which smelled  of fresh bedding 
straw.  Dave was over at the building on the farm originally built for processing potatoes grown on the 
farm.  This is where the interview took place.  It was very cold in there: we talked bundled in our coats 
with our hands in our pockets.  In the early part of the interview, you can hear Dave scratching at the 
fabric of his Carhartt jacket while he speaks (Carhartt produces heavy-duty work clothes). 
An interesting aspect of this farm is that it produces crops for Amish farms.  Dave describes the family’s 
diversification of production over the decades, including growing potatoes, a major crop in the Malone 
region in the 20th century.  Dairy has always been part of the farm and accounts for the majority of the 
farm’s income today. 
Dave is quite sad about the move away from farming in his region, and in his family.  He would like to 
find someone to bring on to the farm who might continue to work it when Dave retires, but he is not 
certain this will happen.
