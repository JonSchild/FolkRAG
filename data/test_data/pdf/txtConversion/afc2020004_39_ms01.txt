Shapeshifters Banned, Censored, or Otherwise Shit-Listed, aka Chosen Family Poem 
 
The one whose maʻi was stolen as she slept. 
The one who sold everything to live as bite marks. 
The one named Mai, Mai, E ʻAi. 
The one raising his scalp like foil from a pan of meat. You know how many pigs I’ve killed, he 
asks. And when he says kill he means it affectionately. Not I killed pigs to feed my blood but I 
slept with pigs, my arms hooked around them. When you love what you kill.  
The one who thinks he knows who stole the maʻi. 
The one with ʻōʻō feathers instead of hair. The years it took to catch each bird and adorn her head 
in yellow. 
The one swallowing a kukui tree for the rest of her life. 
The one who became the rest of her life. 
The one still searching for the maʻi. 
The one meant to be a locked door but fell in love with the crank of keys. I’d rather hear that sound and 
die, she said. Now all the doors in Kahului stay open. 
The one made of open until her drunk mother chased her with a knife screaming you filthy, you filthy, 
your filthy fucking broad. She is the cure to everything that hurts but will never let anyone touch 
her again. 
The one growing into long, solid sticks to poke at women who, after kissing another woman for 
the first time, do not speak for days. In the grove in Hāʻōʻū, they plant their tongues. 
The one who slept with the maʻi first. 
The one who slept with the maʻi last. 
The one currently sleeping with the maʻi because  
maʻi was never stolen. 
The one all-remembering, coughing up coconuts as she laughs. Sometimes they call her 
grove. Sometimes, Hāʻōʻū.
