Became family friends and getting involved with racing 
Dad went to working on Jody’s crew, and he started out helping PJ Allen, by 
turning wrenches and washing race cars 
Discussion of long-time families / heritage of folks involved with racing in the 
area, like PJ Allen, Jody Herriven, BJ Bowman: all same corners and same 
families 
 
[3:21]   
Description of Helping with Weekly Maintenance at Age 10 
At 10, helping with simple maintenance like scraping the mud, washing the race 
cars, etc.

Discussion of difference between maintaining a race car and street car 
 
[4:22]   
Learning Maintenance and Racing Culture 
Learned mostly from PJ Allen, Jody Herriven, BJ Bowman  
More recently learning a lot of the technical stuff he traces to being teammates 
and friends with Jesse Cotriss who also races modifieds, and them going back 12-
14 years  
Teammates with Jesse in the sense of working out of the same shop, and pitching 
in to help out 
 
[5:30]   
Early Career Racing – and Working at Slack in Middleport 
PJ Allen stopped racing around 2004-05, and around then got into one of Nick 
Herriven’s go karts one night and got hooked from there 
Started with racing a go kart, and Jody Herriven happened to be part owner of 
Performance Manufacturing (who make Slack Racing Chassis) in Middleport, 
one of the main manufacturers of racing go karts in the USA 
Working at Slack for 14 years as a machinist, and description of how everything 
there is made from ground up 
Ran go karts only for a year, year and a half sometime around 2005-2006  
 
[8:18]   
Importance of Maintenance and Time in the Shop 
Discussion of how a race isn’t won at the track, but at the shop 
The time investment and research needed to be successful 
Importance of recognizing that the driver is just one part of a team and a crew, 
and it’s all about the crew and team as a whole (not just the driver you see on 
Friday night) 
Importance of preventative maintenance 
 
[9:35]   
Moving from Karts to 4 Cylinder Cars to Mod Lites to Sportsman 
Going from karts to 4 cylinder cars on a whim 
Enjoying the fab work side of it, including making the roll cage 
Ran it for a few years, but ‘it wasn’t fast enough’ 
Moving into mod lites for six years, running mostly in Canada, but also going 
down to race in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, etc. 
Then moved into the Sportsman class 
Revisiting what a 4 banger is – the 4 cylinder, and when he ran them being into 
the enduro races 
 
[12:05]   
Description of the Hang Over / New Years Race at Ransomville 
Discussion of the Hangover Race, an annual race that took place on January 1st 
Memory of his six cylinder car not starting, and ending up racing with the eight 
cylinders: getting tagged and rolling it 
Hangover Race a lot of fun when ground was frozen and used to freeze, but now 
because of weather and ground not freezing just can’t do it anymore 
Land of Legends near Syracuse still does) with the weather changes (getting 
warmer/ground not freezing in mid-winter), it just becomes a ‘slop fest’ and 
really damages the tracks  
 
 
 
[13:25]  
4 Cylinders and Racing 
Description of the four cylinders and how it’s different from the solid chassis of 
the sportsman, and how that impacts the roll cages and feel of the car 
As street cars, four cylinders fold up in an accident which saves you, but isn’t 
ideal for racing conditions as folding doesn’t help: so the need for not only roll 
but also how to support the outside car/chassis from the inside: e.g. divisional 
door bars, bars going to the back.  
 
[15:30]   
Memory from Racing 4 Cylinder and Overview of 4 Cylinder 
Memorable night racing at Lancaster in the 4 cylinder, getting spun out coming 
out of turn 2 and getting T-Boned 
Getting hit so hard that it moved the cage and the seat, and crimped the wiring 
Having to chain it to a truck to pull the chassis off to get to the wiring harness 
(and fixing it) 
But able to go out later in the night and won the second race  
Fuel cell underneath the car at the time 
Taking pretty much everything (especially flammable) out of them: carpet, even 
the dash foam / covers is often cut out 
 
[17:50]   
Mod Lite Class Description and Differences to 4 cylinder 
Discussion of the Mod Lite class, which is kind of like a shrunken down 
modified or sportsman 
Lower weight, short wheel base, and narrow cars that run Suzuki ‘Crotch 
Rocket’ motor (motorcycle motor) 
Mod lites as a ‘real fidgety’, on edge of your seat type of car, because of the 
power to weight ratio 
Going with Jesse over to Merritville and seeing the sportsman class 
Size of the Mod Lite also impacting maintenance, as it is easier to work with as a 
small crew 
Difference between driving a four cylinder and a mod lite and up, four cylinder 
being a ‘full throttle and then car catches up’ 
 
[21:25]   
Racing Skill with Mod Lite  
Mod lites and up requiring ‘finesee’ and not just going full throttle because of 
how powerful and reactive the cars are 
As a driver, need to ‘connect your head, to your hand, to your feet – and 
compensate for all of those things happening at the same time, and then still feel 
what car is doing’  
 
[22:05]   
Community and Racing 
Family feeling of racing and teams, and it being a competitive sport: keep friends 
and competition separate if you can 
Sharing story about racing over in Canada (Merritville?), and being able to turn 
to others for help or people to talk  
Despite competition, racing is very tight knit: if someone needs something you 
go and help them 
 
[23:25]   
Discussion of Tour Racing and Traveling Series 
How traveling and participating in traveling series has helped improve his 
racing, being able to go around and see/experience different tracks and track 
conditions.  
 
[24:30]   
Discussion of Crew during Mod Lites Career 
Description of the crew starting with the mod lites, and traveling around: lot of 
wins, good finishes, and being competitive 
Considers himself fortunate to be able to go out and do that in the mod lites 
 
[25:55]   
Moving on from the Mod Lites & Traveling to Sportsman at Ransomville 
Deciding to do more stuff on the house / around the house, and scaling back 
from running double/triple header weekends, and Ransomville being like a 
second home to him factoring into the discussion 
Talking about challenge of balancing life with racing double/triple headers 
Now with focusing more on single weekly race night, and then still have 
Saturday and Sunday to do stuff with family and friends and on the house 
 
[28:20]   
Current Crew on the Sportsman and Sportsman Schedule 
Description / naming of his current crew that works with him on the Sportsman 
crew 
It taking a full crew, and not just being him  
Decisions made as a team and full crew 
Schedule being just as demanding even with weekly races, and being happy / 
content with the choice he’s made now to race once weekly now rather than the 
double/triple headers used to do 
Having a weekend after racing to take care of other things (before going back to 
full-time job during the week)  
 
[29:45]   
Description of the Sportsman 
Discussion of the difference between a Sportsman and the Modified 
Jesse running in Modifieds while he runs in Sportsman, able to provide some 
advice to one another 
 
[30:50]   
Crew Difference between 4 Cylinder, Mod Lite, and Sportsman  
Difference between the four cylinder, Mod Lites, and Sportsman in terms of the 
crew size and crew teams needed  
Making decision to move classes only if everyone was comfortable, as schedule 
and work isn’t just about him but whole team taking the time and being free to 
take it 
Everything about the same in terms of maintenance, just the scale (e.g. tires, 
going from a little round go kart tire to a full sized modified tire) of work is 
larger  
Importance of attention to detail, even just washing it learning what to look for. 
 
[33:15]   
Time Investment of Race Car Maintenance 
Keeping a car and maintaining it and keeping it ready for racing, is like a full-
time job 
Can easily put in about 40 hours a week, to get it ready for racing one night that 
week 
Everyone also working and having lives outside of racing, so time commitment 
is a group decision and making sure to surround self with people who can 
dedicate time to it too  
 
[34:30]   
Chassis & Tire Manufacturers 
Different chassis manufacturers, but top of the line he sees is Bicknell (Bicknell 
Racing Products), based in Canada but also an American store in the Falls 
Dealing with ‘racers’ when you go there: that the folks who work there most of 
them race also, and aren’t just selling parts to sell them but are passionate about 
racing 
Chassis and bodies having to exist within the rules, so no huge differences 
between them  
Ransomville running Hoosiers (meaning, you have to run Hoosier tires at 
Ransomville) 
Importance of tire selection as being your ‘end game 
Discussion of tire wear, maintenance, and compounds 
 
[39:15]   
Tire Stagger 
In depth description and walkthrough of stagger and how it works with circle 
track racing: shorter distance on bottom, farther on top 
Discussion of how stagger is adjusted 
Tire stagger being a ‘tires are fighting each other’ reaction 
Dirt racers winning not like drag racers only on the straightaway, but winning in 
the corners, so tire stagger and size differences are important 
Smaller difference between the front tire sizes than the rear tire sizes when 
factoring in / creating stagger. 
 
 
 
 
[41:40]   
Track Conditions and Racing Dirt 
Description of Ransomville’s track conditions, and how that factors into tire 
selection, in contrast with Brockville in Canada 
Smooth versus Abrasive Tracks 
Planning and Accommodating tires to short term and long term track conditions  
 
[44:25]

Monday’s goal is having car taken apart, reviewed and putting it back together 
If not back together or if something needs to be fixed, can plan out rest of week 
around work schedule on when can get the parts 
Wednesday Night as Tech Night 
Importance of having a clear head & being fully prepared when leaving for the 
track on Friday 
Saturday washing and cleaning, which can take up to five hours 
 
[48:50]   
Race Day Routine 
Arrival at Ransomville 
Specific customs like not eating lunch, and going to look at track and it ‘talking 
to him’ about how the night is going to go, and seeing the track conditions 
Having everything all set out and organized so can go out and race with clear 
mind 
When finished, usually change back into work / pit cloths and going over to help 
Jesse’s crew as modifieds run after sportsman 
 
[52:05]   
Racing Gear 
Description of the different parts of the racing gear/outfit: racing shoes, racing 
suit, fire retardant undergarments, ‘head sock’, helmet, tear offs, etc. (Clear 
shield vs. tinted ones) 
Memory of racing mod lites and during a heat race at Merritville (also a dirt 
track), a rock flew right through the 1” x 1” window mesh (very, very rare) and 
hit the tearoffs & visor/shield right between his eyes and broke two of the four 
pins 
 
[54:30]   
Maintenance (continued) 
Other than just the car to maintain, there’s also maintaining the racing gear, the 
truck, the trailer, etc. 
Re-emphasis that racing is really dependent on a team 
Racing being more than just ‘him hopping into a car’ on Friday 
 
[55:55]   
Race Preparation: Research & Studying 
The role of research and studying to racing 
Studying the races after they happened, watching videos of the past race in that 
week 
Learning about changes that happen throughout the night that affect how he 
performs (e.g. track conditions) 
Watching the 4 cylinders, as they’re usually the first ones out there: being able to 
see if the track is wide, does it have bite, is it dusting up, etc.  
Even though 4 cylinders race at a slower pace it is important to watch and get a 
sense of what’s being done to the track and staying focused 
 
[57:55]   
The ‘Cushion’ 
Description of the ‘cushion’, and the change in track conditions 
Cushion as the berm and bit of dirt that gets pushed up higher and higher 
Track prep crews sometimes managing and scraping off the cushion 
How cushion can influence whether deciding to go under or at the top, and gear 
selection going into / out of corner 
 
[59:55]   
Driver Styles & Challenges during a Race 
Description of his driving style 
Importance of understanding your own driver style and also other drivers, and 
being able to anticipate where you might be able to get some room, or who you 
might be able to get some room in on: who races clean, who is going to try and 
come across your nose 
One of the biggest challenges during a race, is how close the cars are to one 
another: you have to be on your ‘A’ game always, and always be concentrated 
 
[1:03:20]  
Finding the Joy in Racing 
Discussion of importance to enjoying racing: that when it starts to feel like a job 
(and not just having the time commitment of a job), he feels racing is done 
Acknowledging that there are frustrating and challenging times and nothing is 
easy, but those are meant to be overcome 
‘It shouldn’t be a challenge to enjoy racing’, and if it does then it means it is 
becoming more of a work commitment than something to enjoy 
 
[1:04:35]  
Crew Specialties, Camaraderie, and Racing within Your Means 
Description of working alongside crew and everyone having own specialties 
Having to race on a budget, and finding success through maintenance or making 
something work, rather than having endless funds to keep trying new things 
 
[1:08:55]

world is – if you want to learn, someone will teach you  
Importance of having passion in the racing world  
For those who have never experienced racing, encourage to go see what goes into 
it and what goes behind it – that it is hard to not get excited when you see a race in 
person
