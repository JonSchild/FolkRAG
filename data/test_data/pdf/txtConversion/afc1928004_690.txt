You've heard son s 
in praise of high wit, 
And about our land so green; 
But in that isle there dwells a 
gem 
The purest ever seen. 
Her eyes seem like two diamonds rare, 
In words I 
cannot tell 
How much I 
love this colleen dear. 
My dark-eyed Emerald Belle. 
Cnonus. 
For she is fairer than the lilies, 
That grow about the dell; 
Where dwells the sunbeam of my heart, 
My dark-eyed Emerald Belle. 
'Tis many years since last we met, 
But still my heart beats warm, 
With love for this sweet Irish girl, 
While her memories my brain does swarm. 
And whene'er my thoughts turn to her home, 
In the quaint and shady dell, 
A 
vision fair I 
sometimes see, 
Of in

Won't it fill my heart with rapture,

'Twas on an esplanade we met, 
Played croquet on the lawn; 
She captivated all our set, 
She's graceful as a 
fawn. 
She told me that she loved me then, 
'Twas in a 
cozy room, 
And said that she would wed me 
When the spring flowers are in bloom.

She's a

And her kiss, (Sym.) I

For she loves me, oh I 
so dearly now, 
Her presence scares all gloom, 
Since I 
know she'll keep her promised vow, 
When the spring flowers are in bloom. 
Her pretty form and gentle style, 
And prepossessing grace, 
So free is she from worldly guile, 
So handsome is her face. 
My heart is so enraptured now, 
For other thoughts now roam, 
Since I 
know she'll keep her promised vow, 
When the spring flowers are in bloom.

Oh ! the land that I 
leave, is the fairest on earth, 
Which to wit, love, and joy has for ages gave birth, 
Where for time after time, genius springs from the soil, 
Iltking other lands rich with the fruits of its toil. 
Aud I 
go from that land, 'cause I 
cannot endure, 
The slights and the insults that are heaped on the poor; 
From my own beloved dwelling they force me to roam, 
So now I'm a 
wanderer see ing a 
home. 
When I,saw my fond mother laid cold at my feet, 
Where the bailiffs had dragged her right out in the street. 
'Tis no wonder with anguish my heart turned to stone, 
As I 
found them all dead and I 
starving alone, 
My sister had virtue and ever recoiled 
From the villain who her fair name would despoil, 
And she died in the ditch ' thout a 
tear, sigh or moan, 
Which leaves me a 
wanderer seeking a 
home, 
Poor Ireland I 
love you, although you have nursed, 
Some traitors who keep you continually cursed; 
What if murder and pillaee continues its sway, 
Can we blame you, dear Erin, at this present day. 
No ! no ! send your sons to America's soil, 
There is plenty for all and good wages for toil, 
It is now what is called the big world's greatest dome, 
Where no man's a 
wanderer seeking a 
home; 
Give Him a 
Penny to Spend.

Some folks go for motto's in song rhyme and prose, 
That may harp on the wrongs of the poor; 
Yet they know empty words never better their woes, 
Nor can scare the dread wolf from the door. 
It's all very well to give pity to one who's in need, 
But your pity won't mend, 
While sympathy's plenty their life may be gone, 
For the want of a 
penny to spend. 
Crionns. 
Let charity's blessing come in at your door, 
Idle words won't dire poverty mend; 
Keep clap traps and bosh far away from the poor, 
And just give them a 
penny to spend. 
A 
penny in need is a 
proverb indeed, 
That will work it but done in,true mind. 
For often a 
penny has proved a 
good seed, 
To a 
poor wretch fast falling behind. 
Sympathise with the poor is a 
very good thmight, 
And with brotherly love it will blend; 
But with money, not words, should the feeble be sought, 
And just give them a 
penny to spend. 
Chorus. 
'Tis the poor whom the poor ever look to in need, 
Is not poverty gentle and kind, 
Aye the rich never give, but continually bleed, 
The poor wretch who is dragging behind, 
Ah ! give me the man who has got but one dime. 
And divides with some poorer friend, 
Such poverty is never a 
shame or a 
sin, 
He has given his penny to spend.

Don't you see her there, au ! just see her stare, 
She sets my heart in such a 
flutter; 
You could not erase from that pretty face, 
A 
smile s,) 
loving and serene. 
She has flowing hair, and of eyes a 
pair, 
Would make you reel and stutter 
She's a 
form of grace with a 
pretty face, 
That rivals every fairy queen.

Oh 
darling Mabel Merle, pretty as can be, 
How you do charm me, richest of all pearls,

And with j,)y I

You've captured me completely, 
You amaze me, you craze me, 
You're more an angel than a

You tease me, you please me, oh ! 
darling Mabel Merle. 
When I 
met her first, how my heart did burst, 
With love for this darling creature, 
It was in a 
vale where the flowers pale, 
Grow, bloom and reign supreme. 
And we often met ere the sun had set, 
With tales of love in every feature, 
We would whisper sweet it was joy complete, 
And happiness unforseen.

Softly, Willie, mother's dying, 
In the room where we were born, 
For her darling boy she's calling, 
Thro' the night to early dawn, 
Even brother in her sleeping, 
Free from sickness care and pain, 
For her Willie she is grieving, 
Shall I 
see my boy again. 
Softly tread, speak low, dear brother, 
You're her life, her hope, ner joy; 
Oh ! the look of love from mother, 
When she sees her bonny boy. 
Softly, Willie, mother's dying, 
She has asked for none but thee; 
Daughter, time is swiftly flying,

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsurv,-, 
there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Beautiful songs unsung, &ct 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death,

Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you. 
But forget you I

When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Our Sack's Come Home To-Day. 
Su g 
by C. F. Sta•:ley. 
Our Jack's come home from sea to-day, 
And brown and bionzed is he, 
For many a 
year he's been away, 
From his home his love and me. 
Yet his heart is true as it was of yore, 
his spirits light and gay. 
You little kow the joy we felt, 
When he came home to-day. 
You little know the joy we felt. 
When became home to day. 
CHORUS. 
Our Jack's come home to-day, 
Orr Jack's come home to-day; 
The good ship Jane's in , ort again, 
Our Jack's come home to-doy. 
Our Jack's come home from sea to-day. 
To make his Nell his bride; 
With loving faith she ne'er despaired, 
Though hope with us died. 
Yet her eyes grew dim, her cheek grew pale, 
She slowly pined away, 
nut the lovely bloom's on her face again 
Her Jack's come home to-day. 
But the lovely bloom's ( n 
her face again, 
Her Jack's come home to-day.

A Knot of Blue and Gray. 
Sung with great success by John W. Gibbons. 
You ask me why upon my breast unchanged from 
day to day, 
Ranked side by side in this b 
oad band, I 
wear the 
blue and gray; 
I 
had two brother's long ago- two brothe s 
blithe 
and gay, 
One wore a 
suit f 
Northerp blue, and one a uit 
Southern gray. 
One heard the roll-call of the South, 
And linked his fate with Lee, 
The other bore the Stars and Stripes, 
With Sherman to the sea. 
CHORUS. 
And that is why upon my breast 
Unchanged from day La day, 
Linked side by side in this broad band, 
I 
wear a not of blue and gray. 
Each fought for what he deemed was right, 
And fell wtth sword in hand; 
One sleeps ainid Virginia's hills, 
And one by Geoigm's str nd. 
But the same sun shines on both their graves, 
Amid valleys and o'er hills, 
And in the darkest ef the hours, 
My brothers do live still.

THE BRIDGE, 
As Sting by JOHNNY RoscH. 
I 
STOOD on the bridge at midnight, 
As the clocks were striking the hour: 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Behind the dark church-tower. 
And, like the waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That filled my eyes with- tears— 
How often, oh! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky I 
How often, oh! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stow., on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed ot, that wave and sky! 
How often, Oh! how often, 
I 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
Would bear me away on its bosom, 
O'er the ocean wild and wide! 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care: 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear— 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It ls buried in the see: 
Oh ! You Little Darling, I 
Love You. 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me; 
Yet, whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the oceact, 
Comes the thought of other years: 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has pa.ssionit, 
As long as life has woes. 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear 
As the symbol of love in Heaven 
Andlitg wavering image here.

One day while walking down the street, 
A damsel I 
by chance did meet, 
With airs so blythe and free. 
Her eyes were of the deepest blue, 
Her hair a 
chestnut brown; 
She look'd and smiled and winked her eye. 
And then to her I 
said;—Ah 
Oh I 
you little darling, I 
love you! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! you little darling, are you true 
If you really love me as you ought to do, 
There's nothing in this wor d 
Can cut our love in two. 
(Dance.) 
I 
asked her if along with me, 
She'd like to take a 
stroll? 
And if agreeable to her, 
We'd do Delmonico's. 
She said she'd go along with me, 
And tossed her pretty head, 
And then, as if by impulse. 
She turned to me and said:—Ah I 
Oh you little darling, 1

I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of ' 49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
Tie could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and died, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him In* 
glue, 
gnzioty is the etahle Davy's gone,

The spell is past, the dream is o'er, 
And tho' we meet we love no more; 
One heart is crushed to droop and die, 
And for relief must heav'nward fly. 
The once bright smile has faded, gone, 
And given way to looks forlorn. 
Despite her grandeur's wicked flame, 
She stoops to blush beneath her shame. 
CHORUS. 
We never speak as we pass by, 
Altho' a 
tear bedims her eye, 
I 
know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I 
sought her side, 
And she became my virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace so fair and bright, 
One sunny day, no gloomy night, 
No life on earth more pure than ours, 
In that dear home 'midst field and flowers. 
Until the tempter cfbrne to Nell;

What a

On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
We pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear.

To you I

And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a

With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I

And making love to some one at the first sight,

Only a 
Shamrock. 
Dedicated to Miss, NI. May Frai ids by Thomas Harper. 
Scenes of de ir Erin arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of Ireland's happy days, 
When as a 
nation she stood first upon the earth 
But alas! all now is changed in the land of my birth. 
Yet I 
hold an emblem as pure and bright as gold, 
And you will say that it is true when my story I 
have 
told, 
flow I 
guard this treasure when my heart is sad and 
sore, 
This small shamrock I 
plucked from Erin's shore. 
Cnor.cs. 
Only a 
shamrock from that little isle so green, 
Emblem of truth and love its beauty can be seen, 
Some misconstrue it, while others it adore, 
This shamrock I 
plucked from Erin's shore. 
Sad memory bringing its troubles to my brow, 
Whcn I 
think of Erin and the way she's treated now, 
By a 
tyrant's band she's dragged down in the mire, 
Is not that enough to rouse our patriotic fire ? 
I 
have still left to me my love for Irish soil, 
They cannot make me forget that dear sweet little isle, 
And while life does remain I'll cherish evermore, 
This small shamrock I 
plucked from Erin's shore.

As sung by John O'Neal w!th great success. 
If you have got a 
five dollar note to cash, and want 
to catch a 
lovely mash, 
I'll tell you what t do; 
You must buy a 
bran new silk high hat, a 
pair of 
patent leather boots, 
And a 
necktie that's too- too, 
You must wear a 
flowing ulster, and say that you're 
from Munster, 
And walk off eating quick, 
In your pocket carry a 
billy, in your buttonhole a 
lily, 
And they'll call you the te.sth42tic Mick. 
CHORUS. 
And the neighbors all will say, as you are walking 
down the alleyway, 
" 
If that style suits all the families in the rear, I 
am 
sure that style suits me, 
Then what a 
very, very, very stylish young man 
Uhis stylish young Mick must be." 
Be eloquent in praise for the very good old days, 
In the time of Bryan Born, 
Mid convince them if you can that your sister Mary Ann, 
Wore a 
small size number nine shoe. 
You must tell them she is crazy on the shamrock 
and the daisy, 
No matter what they think, 
You must have a 
terrible gall when you're asked to 
take a 
ball,

And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old . house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, &e. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale.

And play in the moonlight so pale.

You've sheltered me many a

And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I

Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I

That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me,

'Up With the Green Flag and the 
Red White and Blue. 
By Geo. Carr for Gee. Fairfield atd ;Miss Sadie Irwin. 
Performed by them in their Sketch " America and Ireland United." 
All hail to the flags now so closely united, 
Emblems of nations ever noble and true; 
Soon shall the wrongs of old Ireland be righted, 
'Neath the green flag of Er;•-• 
and the red white 
and blue. 
Hail to the strrs and stripes that gave Johnny Bull 
the gripes, 
Proud emblems of freedom, of valor so true, 
Soon shall the tyrant feel both Irish and Yankee steel, 
Then up with the green flag and the•red white 
and blue. 
For valor, hard fighting, for freedom and glory, 
What colors can equal them now held to your view, 
On Clontarfs bloody field has the green told its story, 
While we all know the record of the red white 
and blue, 
Lafayett and Washington, proved what this 
flag had done, 
It raised up a 
nation from a 
brave little crew. 
The green flag was then on hand to help free 
this noble land, 
That now shelters Ireland with her red white and blue.

The Finest Police in the World: 
As sung by Gus WrirIAAis. The American Star Comique. 
The music to be had of E. H. HARDING, 220 Bowery, opposite Prince 
St., price 10 cents. 
We're the finest police in the world, 
In a 
gay dress of blue, they enfold us, 
We arrest all offenders of law, 
And the people are proud to behold us ; 
We walk the streets all the long dark night, 
And we take good care to be far from a 
fight; 
Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world. 
CHORUS. 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world, 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world! 
We're the finest police in the world, 
And our praises are sung in the papers; 
When we find a 
disorderly man, 
V ,ry soon he is cur'd of his capers ; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps, no law is defied ; 
The rogues all fear us on every side. 
We re the finest police in the world.

spoke to her

A very 'popular Motto Song. 
Words by JorixEmil. Music by Jon A. Guncn. 
Sung with great success by Miss KATE MoNvnosz at Novelty Theatre 
New York City. 
There's many a 
song with many a 
motto, 
Each containing good advice; 
Obey their teachings, too, we ought to, 
Tho' great temptations us entice; 
To sing a 
new song I'll endeavor, 
And one I 
hope will please a 
few; 
Make all the friends you can, but never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
Then listen to the motto that I 
give you, 
You'll find a 
good one it will prove, and true; 
Make all the friends you can, 
Always lend a 
helping hand. 
But don't give up the old friend for the new. 
You may be poor in life's beginning. 
A man you meet just like yourself; 
His friendship you succeed in winning, 
He helps you on the road to wealth; 
And when you've won it, do not sever 
The ties that bind him still to you; 
lie helped you in your need, so never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
To those who may, perhaps, be married, 
A word or two I 
have to say; 
By fairer faces be not carried, 
Completely off and led a- tray; 
In this, the :tae of quick divorces, 
Men love their wives a 
year or two; 
Then wander into other courses, 
Give up the old wife for the new.

Despair in her will eye, a

Appeared on the clift of a

Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets,

Loud rang her harp in wild tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more.

Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more.

BEAUTY, CHERRY NORM. 
BY 
JEAN E. FOT:r.ESTAL. 
To Mn. T. M. ITENGI,172.. 
Sweetly beaming, softly streaming— 
Blue eyes, golden hair ; 
Pearly teeth with whiteness gleaming. 
Fairest of the fair ; 
Brightly gliding, lightly gliding 
Through the mazy dance ; 
Half exposi. and half hiding, 
Charms that all entrance. 
Cnaaus. 
Merry, laughing Cherry Norine, 
Sweetest darling Cherry Norine ; 
Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming, 
My heart's enchained with love. 
Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a 
sprite ; 
Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips ; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips. 
Merry, laughing, &c. 
What the measure? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss ; 
Oh I 
the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic Liss ! 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all ono's days. 
Merry, hughing, &c. 
Many Can Help One. 
Fever Doubt Me, Little Darling. 
Sung with great success by H ARRY RICHMONIA. 
some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to- night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any 
Remember that many can always help one', 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year 
The next one be wretched and poor ; 
He's s!ruggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
(Cho I 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your Vndness he's sure to return.

THE OLD LOG CABIN ON THE HILL.

Oh I

was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh ! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home.

I'LL sing you a 
song of the world and its ways, 
And the many strange people we meet, 
From the rich man who rolls in Ins millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving n 
retell in the street; 
Now a 
man though he's poor and in tatters and rags, 
We should never affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, remember my friend, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There the rich man with thousands to spare if no chooses 
But he haughtily holds up his head, 
And thinks he's above the mechanic who toils, 
And is honestly earning his bread: 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take along. 
To the world Alp above when he dies, 
For death levels all and conclusively shows, 
That six feet of earth makes alt men of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tatterel and torn, 
That covers a 
brave m.inly heart, 
But because he's not dressed like his neighbor in silks, 
Society keeps them apart: 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls them both to the grave, 
And six feet of earth makes both men of one size. 
When e'er you see a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle the world and its frowns, 
Let's help him along, and perchance he'll succeed, 
Don't crush him and still push him down, 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given; 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We're all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of me size%

STAND BY THE POOR. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
JUST listen a 
moment I'll sing you a 
song, 
And in it some truths I'll relate, 
Just to show you how easily credit reflects 
From the poor man as well as the great. 
Working day after day through the slow, weary hours, 
With hearts often troubled and sore, 
Could it not be kindness to give him a 
lift? 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Cnom:s. 
Whenever you're anxious to do a 
good deed, 
And one that will always endure, 
Just help out your suffering neighbor in need, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
How often that poor man, with intellect grand, 
Must take a 
back seat every day; 
While some gawkish fellow is lord of the land— 
His cash ' tis that makes the display. 
Some world-weary wretch, out seeking for alms, 
Is drove, with a 
curse, from the door; 
I 
think this is both impolite and unkind— 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, eta. 
How many unfortunate beings to- night 
Without food or shelter they go, 
Are living on what we may drop from our hand; 
Let's give them a 
kiss, not a 
blow. 
Tis only our deeds that will live when we die, 
So kindness is better, I'm sure; 
And if you believe me, between you and L 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
The wealth of our nation is earned by the hand 
That is hardened by vigor and toil; 
There in the background they're forced to stand 
Who ought to be lords of the soil. 
Let them stand back to back in the contest of life, 
Till their hardships are fewer and fewer, 
Still struggling on in the midst of the strife,

To see my home so fair;

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, aht the cruel spoiler came—"

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in, 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewuat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under , 
. standing. 
Many professl.onal Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters ir ?eiattaa to them from all parts 01' the U. S.

Courting Catrd.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
t ) meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too ditil% 
der ; -v 
too fearful of' a 
repulse to venture upon asking the momentous 
questi on. 
The 'lady is rest rained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would EOCin to he an unladyline encourage-
nient. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existencs, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
haopiness of matrimony. Tele pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions anti answers, will cover every 
pease of courtship. The senainents conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the Caine as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their atiect ions, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of the- e 
Cards its aiot restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening 
parties . ,
