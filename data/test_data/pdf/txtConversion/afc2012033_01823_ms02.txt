JB: Today is Friday February 15, 2013. I am at the home of John D. Peck in Great Bend to interview him 
for the Archie Green Project about dairy farms in the North Country.   John, I know your family has very 
long history here. Could you start by telling me the story of the Pecks? 
JP: The story for the family starts in Connecticut with the families coming over from England in the 
1650s and establishing a life style there. They were very prominent members of the New Haven 
community. My family branched out from there after the Revolutionary War. My ancestor Joseph Peck 
who moved to the town of Champion in 1803 was in the Revolutionary War and fought at the battle of 
Lexington and Concord. He was a part of the governors royal guard is what I believe it was called, I 
would have to look that up. He was attached to Benedict Arnold’s  division actually. That I didn’t know 
until fairly recently, but he served out his term there and was honorably discharged. In 1802 his family 
started to make the trek here to New York. It was him and couple of his sons. As the family story goes, 
they came over through Vermont, New Hampshire and down to settle here. Then the following spring 
the rest of his family came over. They originally settled over, I would have to look it up on the map, but I 
believe it was Great Lot Four in the town of Champion of the Macomb Purchase. The settled and started 
their family there. I believe they had 8 children and the eldest son, John Peck, is the one who took over 
the original homestead, but as far as the homestead that we operate here, his brother Joseph Jr. settled 
on this one in 1825. So that is where the story here at this farm begins. Joseph Jr was also in the battle 
at Sackets Harbor during the war of 1812. So there is a very long history of civic activity and dedication 
to the founding of the country in my family. So here on this farm they settled it in 1825 and started out 
with a log cabin and then they built the limestone house which you see today, 2 years later in 1827. If 
you noticed just down the road there is another stone house on this farm, and that is a large full two-
story house. The stone house on this farm is only a story and half. The full two-story stone house was 
built by Reverend William Penick. He is actually a distant relation of ours. The Pecks and Penicks 
intermarried in the late 1880s or so. That house is also under the ownership of my family now. My 
grandfather purchased that farm from Ed Koehler (sp.) in the 1950s I believe, or maybe a little bit later 
than that.  
(0:03:40) 
JB: So how many farms are now operated by Pecks in this Great Bend area?

JP: It is one farm. Grandpa John C Peck came into the business in 1943 after him and my grandmother 
got married and he came to live here in the house with his grandmother. He essentially took over the 
business from her. His grandfather Ernest Peck had several children, as most farm families did, but none 
of his families had an interest in taking over the farm at all, they did other things. Even my great-
grandfather Harry, who was John C’s father --I will try to help you not get confused with all of this-- he 
actually went to Clarkson and became a Chemical Engineer and did various different businesses and 
ventures through that, so he was very successful otherwise. But, they always came to the farm and 
spent time with Uncle Ern or Grandpa Ern, as Ernest was known. So Grandpa had a very kindred heart to 
the farm here. He actually went to Wanakena and studied as a Forester, but then still came here to the 
farm and took over operations.  
(0:05:10) 
JB: Are you the one in the current generation committed to farming, or do you have siblings who are 
also farming? 
JP: My brother Brian, he lives on a house on the farm. He helps out in emergencies, but he has a very 
intensive occupation otherwise. So, yeah, I guess I am the main one responsible for trying to keep the 
ship afloat. 
JB: Has every generation of your family had at least one dairy farmer in it? 
JP: Yes. I am actually the 8th generation here in Jefferson County. I will take that back though, with my 
grandfather it did skip a generation. So my grandfather’s father’s generation, there was nobody in that 
generation who was a farmer. 
(0:06:05) 
JB: What years would that have been? 
JP: Can you pause for a second; it would help me a lot more if I had paperwork in front of me. 
JB: So we paused so you could get some family records, what are we looking at here? 
JP: I have a copy of the discharge paper from when Joseph was in the military and it says that he was an 
Artillery Artificer [laughter] for 4 years and this discharge paper was signed by George Washington 
himself. The person who was entrusted to this at my last knowledge, he name is John E Kern, and he is a 
descendant of a wing of the Peck Family that stayed on the original homestead, but then  also through 
the generations he started up a grocery business in Watertown. His name was John T Peck and Gilles 
Peck, I believe they were brothers. It was through that line that that document was passed down. Jon 
Kern, he actually lives down in Delaware, in Willington. I had the privilege to get to meet him in 2003 
when we had a bicentennial celebration here at the farm, and that was an absolutely wonderful day. We 
did that as a means to celebrate our community and our history and our family’s involvement in the 
area. It was a free event; we had a lot of different things that were donated to us from companies and 
businesses that we deal with. We had a lot of good promotion from the Watertown Times on it and a

couple radio programs that we went on. So John caught wind of it through the news paper, and that is 
when he came and I got to meet him. That was very exciting because there was a time for quite a 
number of years where we didn’t know where that document actually was. We had an idea it was with 
some distant relative somewhere down in the southern part of the country, but we weren’t exactly sure. 
To actually get to meet him and know that the document is still safe somewhere was very exciting. He 
said that he keeps it in a security deposit box in a bank down there and he has had it checked out 
several items by different curators and the one thing that is very interesting is that he has been told that 
that is the best document still in existence of a discharge paper and one of the best copies of 
Washington’s signature that many people have seen. 
(0:09:02) 
JB: Very interesting. What years would that generation had been that skipped farming? 
JP: The fourth generation, actually the fifth. 
JB: I will say for the record that you are flipping through a notebook that has your family genealogy 
written in it from the research you have been doing. 
JP: I did it very intensively in 2003 leading up to when we did the bicentennial. We had a nice big family 
tree chart out and there were some people that came that were distant relatives from the Rochester, 
Buffalo area, and they helped fill in some of the blanks here and there. Likewise, John Kern also filled in 
some of the blanks, too. It was a great day and we learned a lot and had a lot of fun with that. 
(0:10:10) 
JB: Has your family done any other farming besides dairy? 
JP: It has always been primarily dairy. I can’t attest to what it was in the 1840s or so, but it always 
seemed to be that that was the primary thing. The farm itself would have been roughly half the size of 
what it is now. There was a small sugar bush that was also done out in the maple wood lot we have here 
on the farm. I assume that Ernest probably did that more intensively when he was younger. During the 
Great Depression, my grandfather told me that he allowed some people from Watertown to come and 
tap the trees to make syrup to try to make some money, and there is still some remnants from the old 
sugar bush out in the woods. We have one of the boiling pans in the barn here with a lot of wooden sap 
buckets, too. 
(0:11:10) 
JB: What was the last time your family sugared in that sugar bush? 
JP : It would have been before the depression. The larger sugar pan that was used out there, Grandpa 
donated to the Stone Mills Historial Society. 
JB: In LaFargeville?

JP: Yes. 
(0:11:35) 
JB: How many acres do you have here now? 
JP: It is 349 total acres right now and of that, I believe 290 of it are tillable acres. So the majority of it is 
tillable acres, and we have roughly 20 acres of woodlots and the rest is out buildings and stone fence 
rows. If you just take a look around you can see all the boulders we have lined up. I guess it’s a little hard 
to see in the snow banks right now, but during the 1960s and into the 70s, Grandpa spent 10 years with 
a man in his bulldozer going through all of the fields on the farm because we do rotational cropping and 
so every year you would be plowing up different fields. It took 10 years to go through all of the fields on 
the farm to get the boulders out and it was a means to make the farm more productive. If you have to 
spend so much time going around boulders, then it’s a waste of time of fuel and energy and lost crop 
fertility, too. It’s a massive undertaking and great blessing that he did that. 
(0:13:00) 
JB: So you still though have the stone fences all around? 
JP: Just look at the tree line and you can see where the snow is piled up, that is where the stones are 
piled up. There are some spots that Dad will tell you are settling down some, so the boulders are sinking 
down into the ground it seems. Even with all that time spent getting the rocks out of the way then, we 
still need to spend probably 3 weeks picking stones out every spring. 
JB: So that’s just part of your calendar? 
JP: There is no way of getting around it unless you want to make a whole lot of machinery repairs every 
year. 
(0:13:40) 
JB: How many members of the family work with you on the farm? 
JP: Just Dad and I. I do have 2 other hired hands and a cousin of theirs that fills in time to time when he 
is not working otherwise. 
JB: Are the two hired hands full time, y ear round?  
JP: Yes. 
JB: Are they from a local family? 
JP: Yes, they are actually brothers. 
JB: Has that family been with your family over generations? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

JP: No, they have just been attached to me. For a long time on the farm, we talked about this on the 
phone, you had groups of kids that lived locally and they would spend their summers going from farm to 
farm putting hay away. I have met some people that still live in Great Bend that told me about that 
when I’ve met them; that they used to go around, whether it was Hadly’s or Thomas’s and us and Flit 
Cross, and they would make a little circuit around to the different farms town and just help put hay 
away all summer. You don’t have many, if any, farm that do dry hay as much as we do anymore. And 
even we’ve kind of gone away from that a little bit, or at least tried to some, to try to gain some better 
nutrient value through more modern feeding practices, but we are still pretty dry hay intensive, so I do 
require a good deal of labor during the summer months to get it put away.  
(0:15:40) 
JB: You mentioned to me on the phone that in 2006, it was the first year you had a work crew that had 
not experience working on a farm prior to coming to you. So tell me about that, that is interesting. 
JP: Those local men that I was talking about, some of them had their own farms that they worked on, 
some of them were just friends of others who did live on farms, so that was primarily the work force. So 
your kids going to school would tell their friends, “Hey, you want to make some money?” And they 
would come here and would work with your family, and they would bring their friends if you  needed 
more help, and you would just kind of have a perpetual work force over the years. That was the same 
way when I was young. My brother had his friends working here. We are not that far apart in age, so we 
had similar friends and cousins coming to help out, too. I had my friends and they had their friends and 
some of the kids that were younger than I came here to work, also, and some of their friends. Then 
when I went off to college, when I got out of high school in 2001, we still had some of those 
connections, but then in 2006 we ran into an unusual happenstance. All of those that I had known were 
no gone and busy doing their own things. So I had to find a way to find a whole new generation of 
workforce essentially. That was the first time in my lifetime , probably very much on the history of the 
farm, that we had a workforce on the farm that had never worked on another farm before, had never 
even been on another farm before. 
(0:17:40) 
JB: Was this workforce area high school students? 
JP: Yep. One had just graduated from high school. The first kid that came here that I had the contact 
with was through somebody that I knew that used to work here on the farm. He said, “Hey I know this 
kid that lives next door, he’s a pretty scrappy little guy, and he works hard and is willing to work.”I was 
like, “OK.”  So he came here, brought his cousin, brought a couple other friends, and that was kind of the 
start of it. So from that, they worked here through the summer. We had one regular hired hand here 
that was an old family friend that was working with us at the time. He left in the fall of 2006,s o during 
the winter of 2006 and 2007 it was just Dad and I doing all the milking and chores. So that was a 
certainly interesting learning curve for me, just coming out of college and being used to people who 
know how to work, I guess is a gentle way of putting it. When you work on a farm you certainly have a 
different attitude and perspective on work and your work ethic and motivation. Bringing in those who 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

have not had that experience or who have not had to work or work at home or had to contribute, you 
got to break them in essentially. 
(0:19:22) 
JB: Are they willing to be broken in? Have you had success with that? 
JP: I try. I put forth as much effort as I can because I realize the importance of having people having 
some sort of connection through farming and agriculture, that I am willing to train anybody. Anybody 
that is willing to work and comes here to work, I will give them the opportunity. That is a very big goal 
and drive of mine is that I will give anybody and opportunity. I know a lot of other farms, that if 
somebody hasn’t had the experience or they don’t know them, or they are not interested in trying to 
work with somebody and train them to get them to do something. Especially if they can just go find an 
immigrant, or an illegal immigrant . . .  
JB: Migrant worker. 
JP: That’s the work I was looking for. I have to be politically correct on that. They have their own means 
of doing it where you get one family that comes in and they bring in their friends and their cousins and 
whatever. In the same sense, they have the ability to have a continuing work force as their force 
revolves around. You know, they work here for 3 or 4 years, and then they will go back to their own 
country, and then another group will come that they are friends with. It’s not much different, but I 
prefer and try as much as possible to maintain a local work force. We’ve never had migrants here ever 
before. 
(0:21:05) 
JB: In addition to your 2 hired men, your dad, and your occasional brother help, how many of these high 
school kids do you hire? 
JP: One of them, Sean, he has been out of high school since 2006. He worked here for the summer and 
then came back in the following spring and worked through that spring and summer, and then came on 
full time as a milker in 2007 in the fall. He did a little bit towards the end of the summer and then I asked 
him to come one and stay with us, and he has been with us since. 2007 was another turning point also in 
March of that year Dad got very very sick and ended up being taken down to Blue Cross Hospital in 
Syracuse, diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer, and was essentially in a hospital bed from March 
until August. He was only home I think for a total of 2 weeks or so during that entire time. All of a 
sudden I am thrown into the manager’s position learning a whole lot of stuff that I have never done 
before. There is still a few things that Dad hasn’t let me do yet. It is sometimes easier for the one who 
knows how to do something, to just go out and do it, but that year was certainly a trying time for the 
entire family and my wife and I as we got thrown into the managerial position. I can be frank and honest 
with you, I had not intentions of taking over the farm when I was growing up and working here. I have a 
realization of what is all entailed in it, and how hard it is, and you don’t make enough money to make 
ends meet, but you still just keep plugging along for God knows what reason. Even if you enjoy it, it’s the 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

heritage, it’s the hardest thing to try to give up, but it’s just hard to keep on going along with it. But I got 
married in 2005, couldn’t find another job otherwise, so I just helped out here to keep things going 
along, and then I get thrown into this, so, ultimately it must have been the Lord’s will for me to be here 
and do this, or otherwise I still wouldn’t be here. 
(0:23:46) 
JB: What did you study in college? 
JP: I actually majored in Politics and minored in Business Economics. I went to JCC for a year and a half 
and commuted to SUNY Potsdam for 2 years and got my Bachelors in less than  4 years. 
JB: The business degree probably does help as you are taking over the farm, right? 
JP: Yea, I should have done a dual major in Business Economics and Politics. Politics was personal 
enjoyment and the Business end of it has been more profitable. 
(0:24:12) 
JB: How many head of cows do you have at the farm? 
JP: 103 total animals and 60 milkers in the barn right now. We are actually milking 49 cows right now. So 
there is quite a few young stock and only 2 Angus outside right now. I raise my own beef for my own 
consumption, also. 
JB: But not to sell? 
JP: Haven’t thus far, no. 
(0:24:46) 
JB: In terms of the income from the farm, it’s from the milk? 
JP: We do sell some straw to a local dealer in Carthage, so that is one side income. I do sell some 
firewood also when I get time to cut and split it. I used to sell it more regularly when I was just on the 
Town Board. Now that I got married and have children and I am on the County Board of Legislators, time 
just erodes aw ay a lot faster than it ever used to. 
(0:25:26) 
JB: Why don’t you take me through the calendar year on the farm? Let’s start in January and why don’t 
you walk me through the 12 months of the year. 
JP: What happens on the farm or what happens with life? 
JB: For now let’s focus on the farm activity. 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

JP: Through January there is not a whole lot going on. Basically plowing snow whenever you get bad 
snow storms you have to be able to deal with that and make sure you can still get out and spread your 
manure, load the manure, and mix your grain. It is very routine; it is all about feeding the cows, taking 
care of the manure, and milking the cows, that is essentially all the happens during January. 
JB: Do you milk twice a day? 
JP: Yes. 
(0:26:14) 
JB: So you have a morning milking and an evening milking? 
JP: Yes. 
JB: So that happens year round.  
JP: Like I said, I try to work on some firewood , too, and get that cut and split. 
JB: That is out of your 20 acre wood lot? 
JP: It is mainly out of the fence rows. I try to grab the low hanging fruit.  The unfortunate thing is I have 
Dutch Elm disease, is that I have tons of dead Elm trees in my fence rows. So there is always a need to 
go out and get them before they fall into my hay field, and then that just makes a problem trying to get 
hay harvested. I try to get them before they fall down. There is also a large pile of maple tree stumps, or 
maple tree trunks down at my father’s house. The country came through a couple of years ago, actually 
pushing on 4 years ago now, and cut down the old trees that were in front of the houses down, and 
those trees they  have been here since the family settle here. They are that old, they were getting pretty 
rotten on the inside. Some of them were eyeing death, so I am grateful that they did come through and 
take them down. It’s better to have them taken down safely than to have them fall down in the road or 
towards houses or something. 
(0:27:46) 
JB: Would February become more of the same thing? 
JP: Yup. February is pretty much the same other than doing taxes. That becomes one of the big things is 
wrapping up the books and going to your tax accountant and getting that all filed away. Then at the end 
of the month there is this New York State Farm Show, and we make a point to try to go down to that. I 
always taken anybody and everybody who wants to go that works for me, so they can have a chance to 
see what some of the other equipment are and the new technology; the latest and greatest things that 
we can’t afford, but what is out there. 
JB: To keep people excited? 
JP: Yeah, and just to see the difference of thing. The dairy industry is milking cows, but there are a lot of 
different ways to milk cows, especially with the advent of robotics to the industry. I don’t know how it 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
8
practically works, it can only milk one cow at a time, where we are milking 6 cows at a time, but it’s a 
new trend in the industry. 
(0:29:00) 
JB: So do you even take some of the high school kids that work for you in the summer? 
JP: I have. It always falls during President’s Week, so they are out of school anyways. 
JB: so you really are serious about nurturing and mentoring that next generation. 
JP: Yes, very much so. It is not as important for me as instilling confidence in the work force and 
education them, but it is also a means of educating them as to what agriculture is, because as of so 
much of American society, 2 to 3 generations separated from an agricultural knowledge, and now we 
are seeing it as what is being proposed as legislation and what is being said on media and these animal 
welfare groups and environmental groups, they are just constantly insulting the agricultural industry, 
and they can do it easily because of a society that just doesn’t understand agriculture anymore. 
(0:30:07) 
JB: I understand what you are saying. So what happens in March? 
JP: In March we are getting geared up to hopefully start going out and start getting stuff ready for 
picking rocks and getting ready for planting. It all depends on what the weather brings. If it’s like a 
couple of years ago when we had a very early spring, or last year when we had no winter at all, it gives 
us a little bit of a head start to get machinery ready and all equipped and get lawns cleaned up from 
winter debris and go around the fence rows and clean up all the blow down. Just those little bit of 
routine things to try to get stuff out of your way before you start rumbling around with your equipment. 
The other thing to is that I didn’t do it last year, but I did it a few years before that, and I am going to do 
it again this year, but my pastures, I have gotten into a different practice of frost seeding. That is just me 
going around with a 4 wheeler and a little tow behind spreader, spreading out some outside clover. 
Cornell Cooperative Extension got me into doing this because I was looking for a way to help improve 
my pastures for the cows. This is an easy and cheap way to do so. You just go around and watch for the 
temperatures. When you are getting up into the 40 degree days, you are still getting a little bit of 
freezing at night, it has that frost action in the ground. So I go out and spread the clover out, and when 
the ground is warm it has puckered up a little bit, and it has these open spaces in the field and is kind of 
getting old, it is not ready to be plowed over again, and it is just pasture field. So I take advantage of 
those little bare spots, and throw this clover out there. The frost action draws the seed down into the 
ground, so as long as it doesn’t go back into zero degree weather, then I have a good pasture growing up 
by spring and it will last me to 2 to 3 years. 
JB: That is very interesting; I have never heard that before. That would be around this time coming into 
March, right? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

JP: Yes, probably middle to late March, you just have to watch what the weather might be and not do it 
too soon. The other thing is, putting in a seed order and getting that squared away. I like making sure 
out planning intentions are planned and laid out. We do fall plowing, so the fields that we are going to 
plant we already know ahead of time, so it’s just a matter of picking out what seeds are going to get 
planted and what varieties and what mixes. 
(0:33:00) 
JB: That is in terms of producing feed for the cows? 
JP: Right. When you plow down your fields you have to plant it with something, so we still mix our own 
feed and that is a combination of oats and barley along with corn and minerals ???????? that we buy 
from local feed dealers. So when we buy seed in the spring time, we are buying barley and oats and 
alfalfa and timothy and lately we have used fescue. The grass seeds we mix together ourselves and we 
plant that a long with the oat and barley mixture as a cover crop. So when we combine off the oats and 
barley in the fall, that grass seed will grow up and be our hayfield for the following years.  
(0:33:53) 
JB: You said you do crop rotation, so you have X number of fields and you keep a schedule of this year 
this one is one production and this one is not and you keep track of that over the years? 
JP: Right. 
(0:34:06) 
JB: How much do you order in terms of seed? 
JP: It depends on the acreage that we are doing. Usually we are running anywhere between, well I guess 
one year we only did a 32 acre field. They yield tremendously, it was a terrific field. Some fields 
definitely do better than others, and a lot of it has to do with how much rock is in it. Usually we are 
planting between 50 to 65 acres a year. 
(0:34:36) 
JB: To somebody who is a gardener, that is a lot of ground to cover. 
JP: Yes, yes it is. We have a 12 foot grain drill that we use, it is an old International Harvester one and it 
has 2 hoppers in it, one for the grass seed, one for the oats and barley. It will take you, for a 16 acre lot 
field this year, it will probably take 6 hours to plant that, roughly. 
(0:35:16) 
JB: What happened after planting season? 
JP: From March until April, we are working on getting the seed ordered and working on cleaning up yard 
and so forth. April comes around and most of the equipment should be serviced ready to go out into the 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

field. So then we are starting to pick rocks and get them plucked out and put into the fence rows, and 
also building fences to get the cows ready to go out to pasture. Especially this year, I am very very tight 
on hay supply because of the droughty conditions from last year. So I am crossing my fingers that I will 
have enough hay to feed them until there is enough pasture for them to go outside. 
(0:36:04) 
JB: Have you ever had to buy outside hay? 
JP: I have never had to buy outside hay. WE have always been able to produce enough. Last year was 
just a very unusual year; we just became very short on two fronts. Since the fall of 2007, we’ve been 
doing some wrapped round bales; second cutting alfalfa hay gets wrapped up in a plastic roll, and I have 
been using that in the winter time as a supplemental feed. In a typical winter in January what I wasn’t 
doing this year, was we would feed out one second cutting round bale per day for 6 days a week in the 
morning, after the morning milking. That gives them a lot of extra energy and lot of extra nutrients and 
helps them produce more milk. Because of the droughty conditions last year, we did have quite a bit of 
second cutting round bales, but the pastures were not able to keep going into the fall, just because of 
the lack of moisture, so we had to supplement feeding them that second cutting round bales I had 
outside the fall, from about August until they came back in the rest of the winter to the end of 
November. So as a result, I did not have that extra feed coming into the winter, and production has been 
sluggish compared to the last several years, but there is just not choice. I am not going to go out and buy 
feed when I have other expenses to deal with, so we will just bite the bullet and hope spring comes 
early. 
(0:38:00) 
JB: As you started to say, that is why you want to make sure your fences are repaired and ready to go so 
you can turn the cows out as soon as possible.  
JP: Ummhmm. So the other practice that I changed in 2007, well a lot of practices changed in 2007 when 
Dad was out of the picture. So in 2007 the other thing I learned about through Cornell Cooperative 
Extension was about pasture rotations and pasture paddocks with cows. Typically a cow will need about, 
they will roughly eat about 2 acres per cow. If you have 60 cows you can cram them down to a 5 acre 
plot and do pasture intensive grazing. By that you can get them to eat more efficiently and eat better, 
and make a better use of a larger field if you are rotating them around. That also gives that plot, if you 
have enough plots to give them about 8 days rest, you turn t hem back in them again, it allows the grass 
to grow back up enough for them to graze from. You want to have at least 3 to 4 inches of good grass 
height before you turn them out to begin with. It’s enough to give them a good mouth full, and it’s 
enough for the grass to be able to survive multiple chewing and be able to come back up again. So that 
has been a really good knew practice that has helped save on pasturing. It takes a lot of time to go out 
and string up temporary fence, but if it becomes that I have a couple fields that are going to be pastures 
for a couple years, I can just leave up the rods and roll up the wire at the end of the season, that makes 
it a lot quicker than to put it back up the next year.

(0:40:06) 
JB: When you put your cows out to pastures, do you separate the milkers from the ones that are not yet 
milking, or from your beef cows? 
JP: The cows that are in the barn for milking purposes they go out together. The pregnant heifers that 
haven’t had a calf yet, that are not milking, they are in with the Angus, and they have their own specific 
fields that they are kept into. So the milking herd is kept separate from the heifer herd. There are 2 
reasons for that, just because of logistic reasons because I do not have enough stalls from them, but also 
there is a health reason to it. The Johnes Disease can be a very devastating thing, and one of the ways to 
prevent against that is keeping heifers separate from adult cattle because Johnes is passed through the 
adult manure. I don’t have any problem with that fortunately, but there are farms in the area that do. 
(0:41:14) 
JB: So once the cows are out in the pasture, everything has been seeded, you don’t water anything do 
you? 
JP: No, there is not irrigation. 
JB: Then what is happening on the farm? 
JP: So we are talking about the end of April, the beginning of May. Hopefully everything is planted by the 
beginning of May. Then we are moving into getting stuff ready for doing haying. Last year plantings, the 
first cutting off of that will sometimes go into round bales. I try to take some fields off of some of the 
first cutting into round bales, so I am able to have it for feed in the fall. Usually we take that off from the 
ones that were created last year, because new growth makes really good second cutting later in the 
summer. Then the other fields planted in the fields pervious are always good for dry hay. We try to 
knock of 100, 200 round bales off the bat and then spend the next 2 months trying to but in anywhere 
from 10 to 15,000 small square balls of dry hay. If we got a good crew, and everything works right and 
doesn’t break down, we can put in a 1,000 bales in a day, easily.  
(0:43:00) 
JB: How many people are typically working with you then? 
JP: Dad would be out baling hay, I would be out with an automatic bale wagon picking the bales up, 
bringing them to the farm, and dumping them off. Usually we have 2 guys on the ground to put it on the 
elevator, and 3, sometimes 4 depending on the need up in the hay loaf to stack and weigh. 
(0:43:20) 
JB: Some farms have moved away from the small square bales entirely, what is you feeling about that? 
JP: Probably if I had a different means of feeding, I probably would, too. There is still a need for the dry 
hay within the feed ration because you need that roughage for the animal. Even those that feed all corn 
silage or haylage, they still need to mix in a little bit of straw, because you need that roughage in the gut, 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
12
in the intestinal track to essentially scratch the gut a little bit to help then nutrients get absorbed and 
help the bacteria action within the animal. Would I ever go away from dry hay completely? No, but if I 
could at least do round bales some more and had a better means of being able to feed that out more 
efficiently than I would probably do more because the difference in production is really tremendous. 
You’re talking about a difference from anywhere of 5 to 10 pounds of milk per cow per day in 
production. It would certainly be a good change. There is a little bit of a logistic issue with that, but it is a 
lot of a cost issue, too. 
(0:44:40) 
JB: You talked earlier about selling straw, which is a byproduct of feeding your cows oats and barley? 
JP: Yes, but it is also what I use for bedding, too. I use that for bedding the cows during the winter and 
calves and heifers during the summer months. I have my own need for the bedding material because I 
don’t have to buy it then. I don’t have to buy shavings or sand or anything that other farmers use. 
(0:45:10) 
JB: You are more self-sufficient than a lot of farmers are today? 
JP: Essentially, the one handicap that I have is that I don’t plant corn and that has just cut the legs out 
from underneath me in the last 5 years in the way that the price of corn has gone. I don’t have the extra 
acres to be able to do it, I don’t have the equipment to be able to do it. 
(0:45:36) 
JB: Do you lease extra fields? 
JP: We operate just on the fields that we own here. 
JB: Is that typical or not typical? 
JP: For my size of farm, that would be typical, but for larger farms, or those that have the equipment to 
grow corn will lease extra fields so they can either produce more corn for their own  consumption, or 
produce enough to sell to make some extra revenue. The larger that you go, definitely you have great 
change from what it used to be. As far as whether you are leasing or buying depends on the operation. 
For a lot of years, a lot of farms where just leasing. I would say in the last 5 years land values and 
available tillable land has gotten very competitive. In Lewis County it is terrible how competitive it is, 
and that is really driven by 3 or 4 large farms, farms that are milking 3000 cows or more. 
JB: Do those tend to be more over Lewis County way, and not so much in Jefferson County? 
JP: there are a few in Jefferson County also, there are in South Jefferson primarily, down in that area. 
The need for land has become so that they have pushed out into the north region of Jefferson County 
even. If there is an acre of available land that they can get to where they don’t have to clear off anything 
thing they will try to get it one way or another. That’s why I said there has been a little bit of a change in 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
13
the way that has happened where leases used to be more common, but as land owners have realized 
the value, they  have increased leases, so some of these farms have just out right bought the property 
before a lease value has gone up too much. 
(0:47:44) 
JB: Would you be able to give me a then and now comparison of what you would pay to expect extra 
acreage?  
JP: Probably when I was a kid you would be talking about $30 to $50 for an acre, right now, at least in 
my township, I think it is still decent at least at $90 to $125 an acre. When you start going into the more 
fertile soils down in South Jefferson, you could be paying over $500 an acre. The other unfortunate flip 
side of that is on the taxing end of things and how the state determines what your ag land values are. 
Taxes are just are ridiculous thing, $16,000 a year out the door in property taxes ever year. 
JB: That is what your farm pays in taxes? 
JP: Yeah. 
(0:48:46) 
JB: So you understand the temptation for people to get sell their land off to developers. 
JP: Yes, it is a very easy temptation facing corn at $300 per ton and $16,000 tax bill every year, roughly 
$8000 in January when you very little money to deal with after coming off of harvest in the fall, and milk 
prices are usually pretty depressed during January and February months. You have to try to come up 
with that money. In the middle of harvest time when you have school taxes coming around it’s awful 
pinch points in the beginning and fall of the year. I need a drink now. 
(0:49:43) 
JB: What happens as you go into the fall? 
JP: The other thing I will mention too, is we do plant our own garden in the spring time, too, a lot of 
vegetables and a lot of potatoes. 
JB: Because they are good keepers? 
JP: Because they are good keepers and we’ve always done that as a family thing. I enjoy having our won 
home-grown potatoes. 
JB: What else do you plant in the vegetable garden? 
JP: Sweet corn, onions, a lot of tomatoes for canning and making salsa and pizza sauce with, we did a lot 
of cucumber a couple of years ago, so much to the point that we didn’t plant any cucumbers last year 
because we still have a lot of pickles left. Lettuce, we did broccoli last year and that turned out really 
well, and a lot of peppers, we do lots of peppers, too. 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
14
(0:50:45) 
JB: Was that always part of family life when you were growing up? 
JP: Yep, we always had a garden. It’s not particularly enough to last you through the winter, but you 
really do enjoy the fresh vegetables. Yes, it w as always something enjoyable to do. 
(0:51:06) 
JB: We haven’t talked about your wife yet, but you mentioned how your wife is the one that mostly 
takes care of the vegetable garden. 
JP: She tries to. She tries to keep up with the weeding of it to help it do better. I usually take care of 
some of the other plants like the tomatoes, peas, that is the one thing we do a lot of also, a lot of peas. 
WE are coming into June and July and things are proceeding as normal with haying season, which 
hopefully we would have all the first cutting in the barn filled by the beginning of July and just rotating 
cows around in the pastures. By the end of July I am starting to look at put up some other fences in 
some fields that have grown back up again, that you would typically call second cutting fields. Some of 
those will go into pasture, but majority of it will go into making round bales to feed out during the 
winter. That will occupy us for most of July, a little bit of August, and then it starts becoming a time 
crunch and competing factions between trying to cut hay and trying to harvest oats and barley. I usually 
want to harvest the hay instead of harvesting the oats and barley, but . . . 
JB: So if you have to make a pick, that one seems slightly more important? 
JP: Yeah, that is my opinion, but that is not Dad’s opinion. So it is just a give and take on what stuff gets 
done from week to week. 
(0:52:52) 
JB: How long does haying season continue? 
JP: It depends on how much moisture you are getting and how well the re-growth is coming. If we can 
get a third cutting, that would happen in mid to late September, and that is usually the latest you want 
to go because you don’t want to push it into October too much because then you start getting into a 
frost. You want to be able to give the alfalfa enough time to re-grow itself and be able to still store 
energy in its roots before frost hits. If you have a nice field of alfalfa that is growing up pretty good and 
you get a frost, go out and cut it because if you get a killing frost it will be dead anyways, you might as 
well go out and get it to feed your animals. 
(0:53:46) 
JB: You were talking about earlier how you don’t grow corn and it would be a big deal for you to grow 
corn. Is it just a matter if wait and see if the corn prices come down? Are there other adjustments you 
can make? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
15
JP: The primary adjustment I did in the middle of the summer was I cut back on how much I was 
rationing to the cows, and it actually seemed to be a good thing, cutting back the usage, and I didn’t see 
too much of a dip in production thankfully, but I did see some improvements in animal health actually 
with giving them a little bit less corn. I cut it back on the ones that were further out in their lactations, 
but the ones that were new milkers, fresh cows, I kept it pretty heavy in their ration because they need 
the extra energy, the extra protein that is available in it to get them through their peak milk period. 
(0:54:44) 
JB: Once you get to October, November, December, is that just going back into your winter routine? 
JP: Not quite yet, you are actually pretty busy in those months. If planting went well in the spring time, 
then you would be all done with harvesting oats and barley before the beginning of September. If you 
have a wet field or a wet spring, you might still be harvesting in October, it all depends on what the year 
brings you. When you are coming into the end of September to the end of October, the thing that I am 
primarily looking at is what fields are going to get plowed up for next spring and I will go out and start 
cutting down the fence rows. One thing that I’ve been working very intensely on in the last several years 
is trying to keep the brush back. The one thing that large operations do is that they have such large 
massive equipment that they are just going around in circles all day, they could care less what is out 
there in the fence rows. With that kind of an attitude though you start to lose acreage year by year with 
the encroachment of box elders and honey suckle and thorn apples and all this nasty stupid brush that is 
just absolute nuisance. You start to lose half an acre a year at a time if you don’t keep that brush back to 
its maximum perimeter in its field. It is very common. When you are trying to work at harvesting and 
manage a thousand acres plus, for one of these large operations, they don’t take the time to cut the tree 
out of the way that I do. I need that little bit of acreage. It might cost them half an hour to cut that out 
of the way, but in their mind, it cost them half a day because they need to get that field in, they need to 
get it done, to get on to the next 500 acres. 
(0:57:06) 
JB: So it’s a difference of scale? 
JP: It’s a difference of scale and a difference of mind. 
JB: Do you heat your house entirely with wood? 
JP: I wish I did. That fuel oil during the winter months is also a pretty big hindrance. I have been looking 
into getting and outdoor wood boiler, but it’s trying to balance the money with that. My brother does 
have a wood boiler with his house that he uses. He house was built with that boiler on the inside of it, so 
he uses it for his house. If I’m cutting wood and he doesn’t have enough cut up yet, then I will give him 
what I am working on. He’s family and it is just that mentality of taking care of each other. If he’s been 
busy and hasn’t had the opportunity to do so, I will go dump a couple loads there at his house. He can 
stack it and deal with it; I at least gave it to him. The other thing with all the brush that we cut down, it 
takes time to dispose of that, too. Some of it I can stuff into the fence row or into the rock walls, but by 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
16
in large I have to haul it out to a brush pile in the woods. That is the biggest irritation for me. I’ve been 
wanting to get a wood chipper for many years now and try to make it a little easier to dispose of. 
(0:58:42) 
JB: Do you ever burn off fields or brush piles? 
JP: No. So as we are progressing around with brushing fields back and we are still rotating the cows 
around and starting to feed round bales out by the time you are getting into October, typically either at 
both milkings or maybe just one, it just depends how the pastures have held up and how much they are 
consuming. We are also starting to plow the fields, too. Hopefully, we will be having all the fields plowed 
over by mid-November and then things are really starting to slow down a little bit. 
(0:59:36) 
JB: Do you feel like you get to take time off for the holiday at the end of the year? 
JP: Yes and no. Thanksgiving we try to do too much. Either the cows are in before Thanksgiving or they 
are in right after Thanksgiving, it is right around that time frame. Then when we are getting into 
December, once the cows come in then it’s time to start quipping the hair off the cows because they 
have accumulated quite a coat while they are going in and outside and the cool weather is coming. You 
want to have the hair off them. It helps them with their breathing, it helps them with their cleanliness, 
and their attitude some, too. It usually takes me a couple of month to get through all 60 of the cows. 
This year I got through it a little bit faster than usual, I tried something a little different. Instead of doing 
one entire cow, I did everybody’s thighs, legs, utters and bellies. I just went around, got everybody, and 
as time aloud I went through and cut off the rest of it. There was good reason for it too. We were having 
federal milk inspection last fall, and that is one of the things they have a grievance over with is if your 
animals are too dirty. Since they came in a little bit earlier than usual, I figured that maybe this is a way 
to get them clipped up real quick and a little bit cleaner so they wouldn’t have such a gripe about it. It 
worked, we passed with a 97, so that is the highest we have ever gotten on a federal milk inspection. 
JB: You are fair skinned and blue-eyed, and you spend a lot of time working outside in the fields, is that 
ever a problem for you? 
JP: My ears are the only thing that I have trouble with and Dad actually had trouble with that too when 
he was younger. He had liquid nitrogen put on them to take care of that. I wear a wide brimmed hat 
during the summer time when I am out on the tractors and so forth. 
JB: I could imagine that could be a hazard of the occupation, sun burn. 
JP: It can be, that is why you get a farmer’s tan. You were t-shirts like this and you have a very noticeable 
difference between your shoulders and your forearms, but I try to be careful, I don’t have my shirt off 
for too long, I don’t usually get burned. I don’t get burned as easily as I used to anymore. 
(1:02:31) 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
17
JB: Is there anything about the calendar year that you haven’t mentioned yet? What about the breeding 
of the animals? 
JP: Whenever they need to be. That happens year round. You’ve always had the traditional thought of 
the spring flush of milk when cows are going out to pasture and you’ve got lots of cows calving in the 
spring time, that’s the way it kind of used to be, so much has changed in the dairy industry that it is not 
the case anymore. the processors in your milk cooperatives with try to say that is the case and they will 
give you a little bit more money during the spring months, but will really hammer down on you the rest 
of the year, so it is just in my mind a traditional marketing gimmick now, more than reality. Because a lot 
of these large farms are just milking thousands of cows constantly, your supplies are virtually pretty flat; 
they might go up during summer months. You don’t have large farms doing pasturing, so you always 
have these constant animal feeding operations, they are just constantly feeding animals. There is not 
going to be much variation in milk production unless they have a bad batch of feed that they are trying 
to feed their cows. The rational for spring flush in the milk industry isn’t there anymore. I being on 
pasture do see a noticeable difference once they are going out on to the pasture. As far as back to the 
reproduction end of it, I do have heifers and cows coming in the spring time, but I try to make sure that I 
have at least 5 cows freshening every month, especially when I am coming into the fall months. I have 
noticed that if you have them calving into the fall months you are able to better capitalize on when the 
milk price is either still on the peak or just on the shoulder peak because summer months are sometimes 
pretty good, but in the last several years, it is sometimes pretty bad. If you have a fair amount of milk 
being produced by fresh cows coming into October through December, you can usually capitalize on 
when that milk price is still pretty strong for the holiday season, as long as I can get them bred during 
the winter months. That seems to be the most challenging time, is when they are just standing around in 
their stalls and I sometimes have to use shot synchronization to bring them around into heat. So they 
will get bred and typically be calving in the next fall. I don’t know what else I can add on to that except it 
is trying to constantly manage and keep track of them and making sure you are getting positive 
pregnancies. It is very important to keep them on schedule. I do not breed them at 60 days. I do not try 
to hold them down to a certain protocol. Large farms would typically have to it would seem because of 
the logistics for it. They are dealing with 100s if not 1000s of cows. For them it just keeps it easier for 
them to control it as much as they can. I try to let them be more natural. It saves me money if I’m not 
sticking shots in them all the time, too. I wait for them to come into heat naturally and breed them off of 
that. I know my animals, I know that there are some that are problem breeders, and that do need a little 
bit more are and attention given to them. There are different techniques and it comes a matter of your 
husbandry practices and your own personal farm practices. 
(0:00:00) 
JB: Could you reflect on then and now and the changes that happened over time? 
JP: I can give you a pretty run down of how the farm has changed over time was that when Ernest was 
operating the farm he had a barn that was out behind the current barn. I think he maybe had enough 
stalls between 20 and 40 cows. He had a horse barn and operated with 2 horses, and maybe he had 1 
tractor. At that time you are milking by hand and milking with milk pails. So you would be milking the 
cow, pouring it into the pails, and putting it into the milk house, which was separate from the dairy barn 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
18
and trying to keep it cool in there. One fun artifact we have on the farm is a little milking stool, and what 
I was, was that you sat down on it and operated it by foot pedals and it created a vacuum to be able to 
milk the cow with. It’s from the turn of the century, 1880s to 1900s. They do have one on display at the 
farm show down there, and I found it up here at the house. It looks to be in pretty good condition, it 
might be missing the seat. Other than that, the unit is still there along with the milking shells for the 
inflations to go onto the cow. It’s a pretty neat artifact, rather valuable the guy told me, too. That is one 
of those first innovations of the turn of the century and trying to milk the cows more easily and make it 
a little less back breaking of a job. How much he used it, I don’t know.  
The next thing is when Grandpa came along and took over the farm from his Grandparents, Ernest and 
Mini Peck. In 1957 he built the new dairy barn, which is what stands now. It’s a 60 stall barn with 4 pens. 
The 2 pens that I converted in 2006 and 2007, one pen, that used to be called the bull pen; I converted it 
into a pen that I could store heifers into. Naturally it was called a bull pen because they did breeding 
with bulls back then. It wasn’t until the late 50s and into the 60s where you started having artificial 
insemination and artificial breeding. That is one thing that I did not mention to you before, we are all 
artificial, I do not use a bull at all for breeding any of my animals. You get better diversity that way; it’s a 
lot safer for the animal and the farmer. I’ve had farmer friends, just one down the road actually, 2 in the 
last 4 years I will say, have been injured pretty severely by bulls that they used for breeding their 
animals. 
JB: Where these bulls that they brought in or residents on their own farm? 
JP: They were bulls that were brought in. Usually they will have a bull for a period of time, and the guy 
that they deal with will take it out and bring another one it. The one poor guy, all that he was doing was 
trying to get the bull loaded onto the truck. He was in a little bit of a precarious position because he 
wasn’t wanting to get onto the truck and all the bull did was kind of throw his head up. Vern’s a little bit 
of a light guy, so he went for a ride. He didn’t come down particularly hard, but he came down right on 
his hip and broke his hip. So he was out of working condition for a few months. 
(0:05:04) 
JB: That is a real set back as you described. 
JP: You don’t have time to be sick. There is not sick days, there is not vacation days. You are pretty here 
and committed to keep on doing what you got to do. Even with hired hands that are capable of doing it, 
they don’t know everything. Even mine, I don’t have them medicate the cows and do treatments. They 
don’t handle any of the reproduction or any of that stuff, that is all my responsibility as the farm 
manage.  
Going back to the changes that Grandpa made, he built the new barn, with that he would be able to 
store a lot more hay in the hay mouth, milk more cows, and he had a better place to store calves in, too 
because there were 3 pens for holding heifer calves in. The other fun thing I will mention to you is, when 
he bought the farm from his grandparents, the first things that went were the 2 horses and the John 
Deere tractor. He hated horses, he absolutely hated horses and the John Deere tractor was just 
annoying because the noise that John Deere’s make, he just hated. That is why we are an International 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
19
Harvester family. I can imagine the reason he didn’t like horses is when he wanted to get something 
done, they kind of had a will of their own. He was very much determined and a strong willed man, so I 
can just imagine the horses did not have a good day if they didn’t do what he wanted them to do.  
The other advances he did, he had pulsation milking system with milk cans. So you would be going 
around and around from cow to cow with a milk pail on the pulsator to be able to milk them out. You 
would still have to dump them out in your flat top tank in the milk house for cooling it. Then in the 
1960s he installed the pipeline milking system in the barn, which is still the same system that we have 
out there now. I would very much like to update that just because parts are getting to be rather 
obsolete, and just because the new technologies would help the cow’s milk out faster and save time. 
That is one of my big hindrances in my size and capacity is trying to take advantage of some of these 
new technologies. It is costly on upfront, and I would hope that I could make a return, but still, my size it 
is a little bit difficult. I am doing the best I can with what I have, but I would definitely like to upgrade 
that because it takes me and hour and a half to two hours to milk between 49 to 55 cows. Actually this 
last month I took 2 hired hands and we went down to visit Doug Shelmadine’s farm, he’s a friend of 
mine, and is a very large rather modern farm. 
JB: Where is that? 
JP: Bellville. 
JB: How many milkers does he have there? 
JP: He is milking over 700 cows. They will milk 100 cows an hour, quite a difference. He has a double 12 
milking parlor, so he is milking 24 cows at a time, I think that is what he has. All I have is 6, so it is a very 
big difference, and they always ask me questions, and I encourage them to ask questions, and I will 
answer anything the best I can, but I thought it would be fun to take them out on a field trip. It is one 
thing I was always told through some of the Cooperative Extension workshops, if you get a chance, go 
out and visit farms during your winter months when it’s a little slower to see how things are done 
somewhere else. Not anyone of us has cornered the market on knowledge of farming and has it going 
right and smoothly. We all try to find out the best ways to run our operations, but there are always 
things that you can learn from somebody else. 
(0:10:10) 
JB: As far as the work on the farm, was the expectation as a kid, that the whole family work on the farm? 
JP: Yeah. 
JB: That is Mom, Dad and all the kids? 
JP: Yup. 
JB: Who did what? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
20
JP: It varied. Certainly when we were younger Mom and Dad did all the milking. Dad did the majority of 
the machinery work. Grandpa was still doing machinery work at that time. It wasn’t until the late 90s 
when he went blind in one eye and his health started to deteriorate some and he wasn’t able to go out 
on the tractor and do work anymore. 
(0:11:06) 
JB: How old was he then. 
JP: He was in his 70s. 2000 is when he passed away and he was 77. He had been a lifelong smoker up 
until 85’ or so and had a massive heart attack and then he quite cold turkey. By then the damage hard 
already been done. I would have to say it was probably rather heart breaking for him when he had to be 
forced to be grounded. 
JB: He truly loved to work on the farm? 
JP: He did. He had a great love and passion for it. 
JB: He never thought, “ I can’t wait until I am 65 and can retire.”? 
JP: He took time. He was not always, always here. When I was really young, him and Grandma would go 
away to Florida and see friends or relatives down there. They went to a trip to Alaska once in 1989. He 
liked to work, but he like to play, too. The one that really ran the farm was Grandma. Grandpa took care 
of the field work, and was businessman of things, but Grandma was the one who loved the animals and 
the cows, and did the majority of the milking. 
(0:12:38) 
JB: That is interesting. Was that typical, or did anyone think that that was unusual? 
JP: I would say that that was pretty typical. They always say that women make better milkers. You know, 
milkmaids, and they seem to have a better understanding of female animals.  Grandpa enjoyed doing 
the field work, and it was pretty rough work. One interesting story that grandma used to tell was when 
Dad was a baby after he was born, she would often leave him here at the house with a bottle and head 
back out to the field to help Grandpa with bailing hay and picking up the hay. The furthest back field is a 
mile away from the road here. Yeah, try to do that now a days. 
JB: They would take your kids away, but he did just fine. 
JP: He did just fine. It was a necessity. What are you going to do?  You have to get your work done. You 
have to get your crops harvested; you just do what you have to do. The way things have changed like 
that, people survived, people grew up and the lived. It’s hard to understand how things changed that 
way. 
(0:14:00) 
JB: During your grandparents generation, did anyone work off the farm to bring income home? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
21
JP: Grandpa was involved in a lot of other things to try to make extra money. Grandma made the 
clothing for the kids in the house for one thing. Grandpa, when he got a bailer, he would go around to 
neighboring farms and bail hay for them to make some extra income to pay the bailer off. It was just 
means of taking what you already have to try to make some extra money to pay it off and keep building 
equity from there. As far as having an regular job off the farm, no. 
(0:14:50) 
JB: What about your parent’s generation? 
JP: Mom would do election inspection. She has done that since the late 70s. She is still an election 
inspector now.  
JB: You are such a political family. 
JP: No doubt. My dad and grandfather were both on the school board for the Carthage Central School 
District. I had 2 ancestors that were in the state assembly, one was town supervisor. I have had others 
that were on school board, highway superintendant, so there has been various different activities and 
positions held by family members of the last 200 years. 
(0:15:35) 
JB: Does this reflect some sort of belief that your family has? 
JP: It just comes naturally, a natural inclination to serve their community and be involved. We have 
always been a rather outspoken group of people, it’s either put up or shut up, is the plain and simple 
fact of it. 
(0:16:10) 
JB: Do you and or your wife do any work off the farm to produce income for the household? 
JP: Essentially my position on the County Board of Legislatures, this year I will hopefully get re-elected, 
because it is only a 2 year term. The income that I receive off of that takes care of my household, plain 
and simple, and the unfortunate reality of it is, it’s a position I get paid for less than $13,000 in year for, 
but if I didn’t have that, I would have no savings left after the last child that was just born. Even after 
insurance, the expenses that go along with that would have completely emptied out whatever I have 
left. So, yeah, I am dependent on an income outside of the farm income. Even if I did not have the 2 
employees and that money that I would have saved from just those 2 employees, not including those 
that work in the summer time and spring time, outside of those 2, after just doing a tax return, if I took 
that money from those 2 employees and you throw it into what my net operating loss was from last 
year,  I would be at a zero, but I can’t operate without them either. 
(0:17:47) 
JB: So when you say that your job as a legislator literally takes care of your household, is there ever a 
point at which you feel you are drawing some income from the farm? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
22
JP: That is kind of what I was hoping to do, was to be able to through this, I love the job and I love the 
community service, and being involved in politics, and kind of the hope of being involved in that and 
having an occupation secondarily to the farm that I would be able to sustain my family outside of the 
farm realm, thereby trying to continue the farm in operation, but also to be able to utilize whatever I 
can from the farm that I might have left over in addition if there is something left over from my outside 
occupation to help invest into the farm, to make the changes that I want to make. 
(0:18:53) 
JB: Do you think it is possible to make a dairy farm profitable these days without going huge? What are 
the factors that would make this better? 
JP: A large farmer is not profitable, he just has bigger debt. You talk about economies of scale and they 
always harp on you, “Look at your margins, you are trying to make money on the margins.” How are you 
suppose to make money on a margin that is razor thin to begin with and so dependent on variables that 
are absolutely out of your control? Number one, weather, number two the milk pricing itself and its 
calculation and how that is figured reflects absolutely nothing that I have ever learned concerning 
supply and demand. It’s more about collusion and monopolies and the back door politics between your 
milk cooperatives. They are supposed to be in the interest of their farmer members and the milk 
processors that manufacture it to do what they will. To say that anybody could be profitable no matter 
what size you are. If a farm was profitable, then why are they still getting bigger? The only explanation 
for that truly is, is that they have no choice but to get bigger and to keep on expanding and to keep on 
adding on to that cash flow because their lenders are telling them to do so for one thing, and just 
because they feel that they may have no choice. 
(0:20:35) 
JB: It is an alarming thing to me. We are dependent on you to eat, if people cannot make a reasonable 
living doing it, what is the answer? 
JP: It’s a very complex answer and to try to get people on board with it is even harder.I made a lot of 
statements aboard a legislators meeting last fall concerning this Greek yogurt business. Governor says 
he has a Greek yogurt conference, this is such a wonderful thing, we are adding Greek yogurt plants into 
New York State, we are going to create more jobs and help out our local farmers. Wrong. You are adding 
manufacturing jobs, fine, but as far as a way milk is priced, it is broken up into 4 categories, 4 classes. 
Class 1, which is fluid milk, which is the most profitable.  The next one is usually class 3, which is cheese, 
cheddar cheese. Then you have class 2 which is yogurt and butter. Then you have class 4 which is dry 
whey, non-fat milk, and the odds and ends. So you have 1 and 3, which are the most profitable. Then 
you have this 2, which is where Greek yogurt falls under. It is barely above class 4, which 2 and 4 pretty 
closely mirror each other, and they are not the highest value products. They never over top Class 1 and 
3, and yet you have milk being diverted out of 1 and 3 and being thrown into Greek yogurt plants and 
it’s like, “Oh my God, this is going to be such a windfall for farmers.” It is not reflected in the price, not at 
all. So it’s a farce and a fallacy that Greek yogurt plants are going to make that big of an impact on any 
dairy farmer. All plants know what the floor price is from the federal milk marketing order, and they kind

of tailor premiums to farmers to give them a little better price from there. They give massive volume 
premiums to farmers that will produce over a million pounds of milk per month. They could care less 
about my size. It’s a harsh environment. 
(0:23:20) 
JB: Do you think that the problem is just on the income side or is it also that expensive have risen so 
much compared to your grandparents generation? For example, when you talked about the taxes 
earlier, have they grown disproportionately from what your grandparents paid for taxes? Or fuel? 
JP: It’s the taxes, it’s the fuels, it’s electricity, it’s fertilizer. Seed is starting to get affected now because 
of the change in demand of seed. You actually used to be able to get large quantities of seed for a less 
price. Oats used to be in 64 pound bags and they have been backed down into 48 pound bags now. It’s 
not much different than what you see in the grocery store for a jar of peanut butter that used to be 8 
ounces that is now 6, but it is still the same price. Or a half gallon of ice cream is now less than a half 
gallon, but still the same price. 
(0:24:30) 
JB: Here is the youngest family member. What is your baby’s name? 
JP: Silas. 
JB: There is Silas with Mom. Some years ago I interviewed a farm family in Jefferson County for a project 
that we were doing. I remember them telling me this story that their grandparents had had this farm 
stand in the summer where they would sell hand knit things that grandma made like mittens and baked 
bread, and that money they would use to take a trip to Florida in the winter. The younger generation 
would stay home and take care of the farm. The idea that you could sell bread and mittens and make 
enough money to go to Florida for the winter seemed impossible to me, but I wonder if that is actually 
possible. 
JP: I would say look at the Amish and what they do. It is a little bit different perspective on things, even 
from there. They are going to be making bread to feed their family anyways, so why not make some 
extra to sell. That is just really going back to the traditional homespun roots of agriculture that if you 
make extra, then you sell it. That is something that has been encourage a little bit with some of the 
small farm projects that Cornell University and the Extension has done in trying to get people to 
understand where their food comes from. So you see a few more of these things popping up here and 
there, but when I am spending so much time just trying to operate the farm as it is, trying to cultivate 
another side business like that, it is not out of the realm of possibility, but it is just one more thing that I 
am trying to tackle. When I am intensely involved with politics aside from farming that does take up a lot 
of time. My wife does make some crafts and my aunt who lives in Canadauygua attends a very large 
craft show out there and takes some things that my Grandma makes and my sister-in-law makes and 
Maria makes. 
(0:27:00) 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033

JB: What kind of things? 
JP: Grandma does towels and pillow cases on her sewing machine, it’s a computerized sewing machine 
that has designs on it, she monograms things. I don’t recall what my sister-in-law makes. She makes 
cards and soaps. Maria has picked up crocheting and making some different things and quilting. 
JB: Is that  Canadauygua show a big show with a lot of traffic? 
MP: I actually haven’t sent anything yet, I am starting to make stuff now, to be able to sell in the fall, 
because I really  haven’t had time to make anything yet.  
JB: Well I promised Maria that when the kids woke up we’d let it rest for today. 
JP: Well, this is the quiet one.  
(0:28:15) 
JB: Well, if you want to we can stop right here and pick up another day with some other topics. 
JP: One of the other advancements of technology that I did. This is a fun story that I can let you know 
about, too, that Grandpa did. In the late 70s, early 80s you had the advent of bulk milk tanks coming into 
the area. At the time he was shipping milk to a plant in Philidelphia, NY or Evans Mills. During that time, 
you had the advent of bulk milk tanks coming into existence, which is very commonly used everywhere, 
and the board of directors for that milk co-op said, “They will never catch on, it’s just a fad.” So as a 
result of that Grand pa installed a bulk tank and went to a different co-op. That co-op went by the way-
side, but that was another advancement in technology that was taken advantage of. I guarantee the 
price of that bulk tank back then was a lot cheaper than one now. Just out of curiosity I asked the dealer 
we work with how much one would cost, and he said  new one that size would be over $40,000 dollars. I 
take care of the one that I have. 
(0:30:00) 
JB: It seems like it would be almost impossible to start a farm from scratch now? 
JP: It would be. The amount of capital involved, not even just in land, but in equipment necessary and 
then in the cattle, you would be running into a million dollars in debt very easily. 
(0:30:22) 
JB: What do you think about the scene of younger people that are coming to start small farm, mostly 
diverse crops, CSAs and things like that and that whole model? 
JP: I think it is a good advent to try to be able to keep use of these smaller acre houses and small farm 
plots. The advent of subdividing farms, you might still end up with a 10 acre parcel where the farm used 
to be, so you have this block of land that is not very good for conventional farming, but somebody like 
that, if they can make use of it, and make a little hobby farm out of that, that is terrific. As trying to 
make it a long term sustainable model, I’m not sure if you can. It is a very niche market I would say, but

one that is growing in popularity. It is certainly one that I would encourage, too. Anyway you can get 
people to recognize where your food comes from and how hard it is to grow your food is a very 
important thing. That all goes back to 2 or 3 generations removal of where your food comes from. 
Anything that you can do, to encourage people to understand that this is tough work, but there are 
people that love to do it. If you could just get the people in Washington to understand that your policies 
are bankrupting agriculture in the country to change things a little bit. For generations we have been the 
country that has had the lowest food prices in the entire world. We feed the entire world quite literally, 
but a lot of that is being jeopardized in urban development and a lot of good land is being taken away 
and the housing and urban sprawl, and you always have to be mindful of how you use your land, too. 
Some of the tilling practices that are used now are actually in some ways destroying soil habits. These 
large farms are just going through and doing no-till plowing and seeding. We use mold board plow and 
till the sod over, we turn it over. You are breaking down the vegetation, you are getting down into the 
soil, and loosening it up, and making a lot better seed bed than just constantly running over it with your 
heavy tillage equipment and just scratching the surface of the soil. Eventually you are just going to run 
out of good top soil and destroy your subsoil’s by compaction if you are not turning it over. There are 
some threats out there by the way common practices are done. I am not going to blame my fellow 
farmer for doing so, because they are doing so because they are trying to make money. It is all about 
trying to survive, and you are trying to survive in a very very hard environment where you have people 
who don’t understand what you do, why you have your cows in the barn all winter, or they don’t 
understand why don’t your cows go out to pasture, why do you have them in a concrete barn for their 
entire lives, shame on you that they don’t touch grass. That is just the way the model had changed in 
farming, both in terms of the coops demanding milk in the northeast, but you can’t get any processor for 
giving you an extra dime for producing it. Even Great Lake’s Cheese in Adams, did this great expansion in 
the last several year, but the local coops were not given any extra premium, in fact, we had to pay into 
Dairylee, to help them haul milk from western New York and Auburn up to Great Lake’s Cheese to meet 
their demand. You could have just as easily given me another 20 cents and maybe I would have added 
on another 100 cows, and try to fill you supply here closer without the trucking cost, but instead you will 
penalize me for being too close to you and you expand and Dairylee makes a  bad deal to supply you 
with as much milk as you need, so they have to pay for the hauling. There is a lot of different situations 
and behind the scene things that are not easy remedies to really tackle it. 
(0:35:37) 
JB: Do you feel like your role as a legislator over time will have any effect on this? 
JP: That was my whole hope and purpose for getting involved in politics in the first place. I didn’t feel 
like I could take over the farm and operate it, going back to what I said before that I had no intention 
and no reason and wan to take over the farm because I knew how hard it was and how difficult it is to 
make a living. Just the lack of understanding on the policy level in the country, I wanted to someday to 
get there to make a difference. What better place than to start it locally, so I ran for the town board for 
the town of Champion when I was 18 and won and served on there for 10 years. 
(0:36:30) 
Dairy Farm Workers in New York's North Country, afc2012033
26
JB: I remember reading about you. 
JP: So I spent 10 years on the town board and then just got elected to the County Board of Legislatures 
and raising hob there, but also kind of trying to beat the drum, not only for my industry in agriculture, 
but just being watchful and mindful, too.  It is just a simple matter of asking questions in government 
and watching over things. There is no reason why you just have to blindly accept and pass and believe 
what is put before you. 
(0:37:22) 
JB: What does your dad think about all of this? Does he really want you to carry the farm forward? 
JP: It is. My grandfather really wanted me to, also. One of the last poignant things I remember him 
telling me, a year or 2 before he died, he wanted me to take over. That is a very personal thing, and I 
had reservations and resistance as to wanting to do so, as I suppose any young man has resistance to 
doing what someone is suggesting he do outside of what they want to do. Dad takes care of the financial 
books and the records, he is accustomed to doing it, and it is not that I don’t know of anything of what Is 
going on, but it is helpful that he takes care of that end of the business for now. It is just heart breaking 
to him to see how much things cost and how hard it is, and you wonder how on earth you are going to 
get by from month to month sometimes. One of the things I have done otherwise, too, is do some more 
of the vet medicine; some of the things that Dad would have had a vet come and do to take care of a 
cow after they freshened. The biggest thing is being able to give calcium or drugs intravenously. A 
couple of vets really helped me out in learning how to do that and I can do it pretty well and proficient 
now. It helps them because they spend a lot of time doing large farm calls and they are very respectful 
to the smaller farms, too. We are important clients to them, also, but it helps save them time. If they 
have to just come up here to treat one cow, it is kind of taking them away from where they are doing 
their work, because they are coming from Lowellville, which is a half hour drive or more. That saved us a 
great deal of money that I can do that, it is also better for the cow that I can do that and get a rapid 
response essentially get over whatever it is that they are dealing with. That has helped saved some 
money and that is really is the lynch pin for Dad wanting to try to just keep things going. He would really 
be crushed and heartbroken if he had to see the cows go, likewise with Grandma, too. 
(0:40:28) 
JB: Are those the ones I met when I stopped at the wrong house? 
JP: That’s them, that’s the old folks home. 
JB: I would like to talk to them if they are willing on another visit. 
JP: I’m sure that they would be. 
JB: How old is your dad? 
JP: Dad is 65, mom is 69 and Grandma is 85. She grew up on  a farm also, just outside of Great Bend 
here. She has never been off a farm before. That is her life.
