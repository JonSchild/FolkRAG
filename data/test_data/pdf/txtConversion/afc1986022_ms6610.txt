my work that I did you know. I told her I had - notebook full of work so she told me just
keep it in order this time you know and if she gave me another F next time -- so every

INF He wouldn't have had to really do nothing. Maybe a fight, see if he can fight or
smething.like thatyou know, push him around. You know, get hollered at, see if he has
any heart. That's what most people call it. If you don't have no heart you can't walk
with us 'cause really when we were in elementary school we was supposed to be the
toughest boys there. In order to hang with us you had to be just as rough and you had to
do everything we did or you know, couldn't tell on what we did. Couldn't tell her we did
that.
FW Ever see any of those guys now?
IMF Two of them.
FW Still have the same sort of friendship as you had then?
INF We not -- we don't hang together. We still friends and you know we see each other
now and then. One of them is, you know, he ah singer now, you know, sing with a group
and the other one he's working and in the evening at school. I mean he's working during
the day and going to school at night, you know. And that's I'm usually with him sometime
you know, most the time I'm with him. And the other two, they tell me one of them went

time they say.
