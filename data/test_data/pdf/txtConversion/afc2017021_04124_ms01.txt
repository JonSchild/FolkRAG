Introduction. Lang Wightman. Interviewed September 9, 2017, at Archival Products, 
Des Moines, IA. Interviewed by Jeanne Drewes, librarian.

History: Wightman grew up at Rockefeller’s Estate [Kykuit, Tarrytown, New York]. He 
first came in contact with the library binding industry while at Illinois College. He left 
college after two years and spent six years in military service. He returned to Illinois 
College, was hired at Hertzberg-New Method for a summer job, and worked there for 
two summers.  He describes how schools rebound old textbooks and how he melted lead 
for the linotype machines.  
 
 
 
00:02:50 
Career: Wightman worked at Hertzberg-New Method for two summers, then he was 
offered a full time job at the company by Fritz James after he graduated.  He went 
through their library binding apprenticeship program for six months.  He worked in 
rebinding paperback books for schools so that they would last longer.  After a change of 
owners, Fritz left and got Wightman a connection to start a bindery similar to Hertzberg-
New Method at Perfection Form (now Perfection Learning), which supplied to high 
schools.  He was hired with two years of experience and started this bindery from scratch 
and trained new people.  He was there for 6 years, during which he kept in contact with 
Fritz.  In 1982 he received a job at Library Binding Service as Vice President of 
Production.  It was a small company at the time, just supplying to library binders, and 
Fritz needed help building it to what is today.  
   
 
 
00:09:38 
Career Change: Wightman discusses transitioning from Perfection Form to LBS.  He 
had no problems with the new people since he knew Fritz and how he worked.  
Wightman felt that it was nice to go from binding itself to supplying to bookbinders.  The 
culture of LBS was what built up the company since they focused on the people in the 
company, the customers, and the vendors.  Fritz told them to treat everyone like a 
customer, which led to success and respect when dealing with people.  
  
 
 
00:12:01 
Building and Plant: LBS was originally housed in old wooden building built in 1920s  
for book binding.  It “had character” with leaky roofs and wooden posts.  As LBS grew,  
they needed more space.  So they built a 28,000 square foot facility in a different part of  
town.  The building was divided into three sections, and two were leased off for the next  
ten years, until LBS gained ownership of the whole building.  
 
 
 
00:13:40 
Career: As Vice President of Production Wightman oversaw the printing children’s 
books on buckram for several library binders.  He had forty employees working on 
various types of products.  Endpapers were roll fed into a state of the art machine for the 
time that had eighteen configurations based on how book bound.  LBS was the only 
business producing endpapers.  Printing covers was difficult and not a financial success, 
so they eventually stopped printing covers.   
 
 
 
00:18:51 
Growth of Business: After ceasing production of book covers, LBS continued producing 
endpapers and their cover materials grew in number.  In the late 1980s, LBS was buying 
buckram from Holliston Mills and they were sharing customers.  LBS outsold Holliston, 
and LBS doubled in size once Holliston stopped selling cover materials.  This allowed 
LBS to expand to new customers.  LBS developed Corporate Image (CI), which made 
ring binders with the equipment they had from cover equipment.  This also brought in 
new types of customers.  They tried to use a single color press but had to upgrade to a 
two color press to keep up with competitors.  In 2000 they moved to a new building and 
put in a six color press, which changed a lot of products.  Corporate Image later added 
pocket folders to ring binders.  LBS used existing employees through these changes, but 
brought in outside sources to help improve facilities and help train employees with new 
technologies.   
 
 
 
00:29:07 
Technology: LBS realized it was cost effective to produce promotional materials to 
showcase samples made with their machines.  LBS and Corporate Image would cross 
over to create these items.  They hired a packaging designer, but no other graphic 
designers.  CI began a packaging service for any item, but this industry was tough 
because every product presented was different, so they simplified this business to have 
repeatable designs.  Archival Products was introduced to help libraries with preservation 
and LBS already had the materials to produce preservation items.  Each department 
sometimes had an overlap of customers.  The expanded types of cover materials 
incorporated various needs.  Businesses were changing fast and LBS had to keep up with 
new technology.  They connected with book manufacturers and realized they had the 
technology to produce the specific materials that these customers desired.  LBS hired a 
salesman to sell to book manufacturers, which put them into competition with Holliston 
again.  When Wightman first joined LBS they produced very few materials. Over time 
technology grew and LBS did not have the materials for the new machines, but they 
needed to find new materials that they could use.  Therefore, they developed brand new 
materials to be used with new machinery, and they could then sell these to library 
binders.  Fritz James helped a committee develop a new guide for how to library bind 
books for longevity and LBS used this when making materials.  They tested their 
materials with technology from labs at Iowa State University.   
 
 
 
00:49:04 
Associations:  Wightman earlier mentioned being a member of LBI and BMI.  He was a 
member of several printing associations that he and LBS joined for education about the 
industry for Corporate Image.  They joined ALA for both education and customer 
connections with both library binders and book manufacturers.  He still belongs to ALA 
and BMI.  
 
 
 
00:50:40 
Mentors: Fritz James had the largest influence.  He taught Wightman to look to the 
future and plan ahead.  Werner Rebsamen was another influence.  He was a Swiss book 
binder who taught at RIT.  Wightman took his classes when he was at Perfection Form 
because he had only been a book binder for 2 years.  They became close, kept in contact, 
and Rebsamen was a consultant and friend to Wightman.  Another mentor was Jack 
Bendror, an equipment supplier.  He took Wightman to the DRUPA printing/binding 
equipment show in Germany early in his career, which Wightman has returned to most 
years since then. 
 
 
 
00:55:55 
Greatest Accomplishment: Wightman considers helping the company become what it is 
today, going from a struggling company to a respected name, an important 
accomplishment.  
 
 
  
00:56:56 
Coworkers:  Wightman believes everyone at LBS made it successful.  He retired two 
years ago and he misses customers and employees the most.  He liked to see the 
employees grow and develop their skills.  They would then become successful and 
important to the company.  Many of the employees came in just looking for an intro level 
job and then grew into various positions. 
 
 
 
00:59:42 
Changes to Industry:  With growth of technology, binding on demand grew.  
Historically, if someone wanted to print a book, that person had to make enough copies 
to sell for profit.  Now, the cost has gone down to allow a company to produce smaller 
amounts.  This has also saved money on storage of extra copies. 
 
 
 
01:03:50 
Future: Wightman believes that the book binding industry has bright future and will 
have for foreseeable future.  He thinks the electronic portion of the industry is not as 
popular as people thought it would be.  In all he believes that the book is not going away 
and has a long future.
