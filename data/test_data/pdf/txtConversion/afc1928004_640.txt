YOU WILL ALL BE WANTED. 
Patriotic Irish Song. 
Words by JOHN FIELDING. Sung by CRONIN & SULLIVAN with great 
success. 
The music of this song is copyrighted, 1882, by 
B. 
W . 
HITCHCOCK, 166 Nassau Street. 
Price, 40 cents 
by mail. 
Published by permission. 
Now listen to me, one and all, 
You boys of Erin's Isle; 
The tyrant's hand is laid once more 
Upon your native soil. 
The time has come, go to the front, 
And save your native land; 
She cries for help, so all unite 
And lend a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
You'll all be wanted, 
You'll all be wanted, 
Be in time, fall in line; 
Lose not a 
day, for you'll be wanted, 
Yes, you'll all be wanted. 
Ireland's up in arms! 
Away! away! 
You'll way! 
The Irish race is living yet, 
Young, vigorous and strong; 
Irish hearts are true as when 
O'Donnell battled wrong. 
Oh! pause not in your onward march, 
And, oh! remember this: 
'Twas weakness in the past that left 
Your country as it is. 
England's rules are as cruel yet, 
As in the days ago; 
Now 
is the time, declare yourselves, 
And give her blow for blow. 
Remember, men, that words are weak, 
As foam of angry sea; 
The bayonet, sword, and musket ball 
Make pathways for the free.

PADDY CLIFFORD'S GOAT. 
Parody on " Paddy Duffey's Cart," Written and Composed by EDWIN 
TALBOT. 
Dedicated to W ILLLIAM GEOGHEGAN. Esq., cor. 
Grand and Cannon Sts., New York. 
On many Summer's evenings, to pass the time away, 
Outside of Paddy Clifford's door, so merry and so gay, 
He kept down near the Hook Dock, on the street de 
Madison, 
The crowd would meet and there would treat, and then 
begin the fun. 
There was Mickey Brady, a 
boy from Donnegal, 
La Fayette and Crookey, who never worked at all, 
Big Bab Quinn, the copper, and a 
tough they all called 
bloat, 
Trowing bricks and playing tricks on Paddy Clifford's 
goat. 
The Dew Drop inn was nobby, the boys they knew it well 
Shellou he had a 
big brown dog, and how that dog could 
yell: 
He'd bark at Paddy Clifford and one day tore his coat, 
And his wife, Judy, chased poor old Jeff for biting her 
old goat. 
Little Neddy Clifford, Paddy's only son, 
He was a 
friend of Hiney Myers, and rated number one, 
Chink Chatham was a 
boxer and won many a 
prize, 
Fought the goat that tore his coat and swallowed Fox's 
pies.

PADDY CLIFFORD'S GOAT.—CONTINUED. 
This gang they were all dandies and some State's prison 
got, 
And gome are still alive and well and a 
doing I 
know not 
what. 
There was Big Jack Ryan, the Blower and Big Toni , 
Owens, the Horse, 
A plagueing Paddy Clifford's goat because they was the 
boss; 
There was Great Big Clover and Stumpy Butsy Coyle, 
Hanging up the Dutchman, drinking all his oil. 
Never dreamed of working, Pat Toole his name he wrote, 
And said he'd take the photograph of Paddy Clifford's 
goat. 
Oh, I 
hope you'll all remember those happy times we had, 
And how the boys would fly around when Hussey would 
get mad; 
He'd scare a squad of fine police and of whiskey drink 
galore, 
lie left New York and all his work to see his emerald 
shore. 
There was Paddy McGee, the tailor, a 
man out of his 
mind, 
Sally Sinders you all know, a 
brave man of his kind, 
And a 
man they called Olvany who used to play by note, 
For a 
gang they called the Etna Club and Paddy Clifford's 
goat. 
Composed by GEORGE BLAKE, for CRONIN 
SULLIVAN, 
and sung with great success. 
Air.—Day I 
Played Base Ball. 
1 
went to the Elks' ball the other night, 
Bolavar Bill was there ; 
He filled me up with rum and gum, 
I 
was drunk shure, I 
will swear. 
I 
asked a 
dame to dance with me, 
Says she ould man you're too soon, I 
see, 
No baboon will dance with me, 
At the Elks' P. B. 0. Ball. 
CHORUS. 
You are too funny, says Mr. Can, 
You remind me of my terrier black and tan; 
And they wanted me to join the temperance band, 
On the night of the Elks' Annual Ball. 
I 
tried to do a 
dance alone, 
When I 
got struck with a 
brick; 
The floor manager roarcd out, no buck dancing here, 
You redneaded flannel mouth mick. 
I 
said, gentlemen I 
want to go out, 
When the gang in a 
chorus of rage did shout, 
O'Brien does your mother know you're out, 
At the Elks' P. 0. B. Annual Ball. 
They laid me down upon the floor, 
And sprinkled my body with wax; 
And said I 
was a 
curiosity, 
And twenty-five cents they would tax. 
They said it flew in on a 
barrel of gin, 
When a 
lady stuck in me a 
big shawl pin, 
And said she would ride the horse in the ring. 
At the Elks' 0. B. P. Annual Ball. 
ONLY A 
FACE AT THE WINDOW. 
ks sung by W . 
H HAMILTON, the Premier Baritone, at the SAN FRAN 
CISCO M INSTRELS 
Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a face, nothing more; 
Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a smile as I 
passed; 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee; 
Yet there's naught that this wide world contain-
Half so dear as this woman to me.

THE CANDIDATE.

SULLIVAN, of CRONIN S
.7 SULLIVAN. 
0 
"Father, who travels the road so late?" 
"Hush, my child; 'tis the candidate." 
Fit example of human woes— 
Early he comes and late he goes; 
He greets the women with courtly grace, 
He kisses the baby's dirty face, 
He calls to the fence the farmer at work, 
He bores the merchant, he bores the clerk, 
The blacksmith, while his anvil rings, 
He greets, and this is the song he sings: 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ah it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
" 
Husband, who is that man at the gate?" 
"hush, my love; ' tis the candidate." 
"Husband, why can't he work like you! 
Has he nothing at home to do?" 
My dear, whenever a 
man is down, 
No cash at home, no money in town, 
Too stupid to preach, too proud to beg, 
Too timid to rob, and too lazy to dig, 
Then over his horse his legs he thugs, 
And to the dear people this song he sings: 
THE CANDIDATE—CoNmuED. 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is youl- wife, and how are you? 
Ah I 
it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
Brothers, who labor early and late, 
Ask these things of the candidate: 
What's his record? How does he stand 
At home? No matter about his hand, 
Be it hard or soft, so it be not prone 
To close over money not his own. 
Has he in view no thieving plan? 
Is he honest and capable?—he is our man. 
Cheer such a 
one till the welkin rings, 
Join in the chorus when thus he sings: 
"Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
.Ahl it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman."

MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST, 
BY 
JOHN LOCKE. 
Recited by Mr. J. F. SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, at HARRY 
MINERS'S THEATRE, N. 
Y., and throughout the country. 
anam an Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sireland! 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another flight, 
There's so much joy in returning— 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornin'; 
Oh, Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged, 
A 
million of waves come trooping.. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloomed it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love-light first illumed it. 
r, 
I. 
XIORNING ON THE IRISH COAST—CONTINUED. 
And doesn't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up against the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's bells, 
Alt, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en. so, 'twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ope 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Alit oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave. 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
All danger and doubtings seornin', 
.I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore-line shows— 
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze, 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old songs, old friends again, 
The vale and cot I 
was born in! 
Oh, Ireland, up from my heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the top of the mornin'.

INSANITY. 
Written by JAMES S. 
KELLY, and performed by KELLY 8: o'BRiEs. 
with great success. 
While running down the street one afternoon, 
For to catch a 
butterfly, 
I 
jammed my head into a 
big spittoon, 
Oh, how is that for high. 
Kaiser don't you want to buy a 
dog, 
Or a 
sixteen carat pin. 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
With a 
bunion on her shin. 
Cuonus. 
Oh, my, you can't catch me, 
(Break.) 
I 
feel just as happy as Jack Aberle; 
They call me a 
big bag of hay. 
Six times I 
lost my peck, 
Good evening white folks one and all, 
I've a 
gum bile on my neck. 
Olt, here I 
am a 
champion gay, 
Singing, dancing all the day, 
A 
regular Hanky Panky cove, 
•I'm all dressed up in my Sunday clothes. 
I 
carry a 
razor in my sock, 
They say my face would stop it clock, 
work out here a 
blasting rock, 
Oh, how is that for low. 
put on style with my stand-up collar, 
When I 
sing I 
never holler, 
ion can bet your bottom dollar 
I 
never miss a 
meal. 
When I 
hear the music playing 
I 
rattle off my heel and toe, 
Urn Erastus Henry Johnson, 
And I've got tar upou my heel.

WHEN SOME ONE PULLS THE STRING. 
As sung with great success, by BILLY MooaE, 
guess you wonder who I 
am, 
And from whence and when I 
came; 
You will find I'm not Italian, 
Or a 
Chinese from Spain. 
I'm called a 
monkey jumping jack, 
They say of Ireland I 
am king; 
Let him alone, and he'll come home 
When some one pulls the string. 
CHORUS: 
I'm a 
cigar sign they'll shout at me, 
I'm a 
naughty, nasty thing; 
Let him alone, and he'll come home 
When some one pulls the string. 
I'm matched against Owney Geoghegan, 
A chance you don't get often 
To dance a 
jig for an eight-day pig 
Or a 
silver-plated coffin. 
Were to meet next Sunday in Hoboken, 
And his statutes he will bring; 
And I'll be there if I 
lose my hair. 
And some one pulls the string. 
(Repe-at). 
(Chorus).

BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and Music by JOHN IVALsn. 
The greatest Irish patriotic 
singer in America. 
:o: 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Cuonus: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion. 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sons they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; 
Our. hearts ever warm to welcome a- stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger. 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it, 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
By 21.1Arr. .McAmcv. 
Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
The noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border. 
Arrah ! But the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly (Tressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she could'nt resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St, Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure, but the streets are a -gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky ! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey ! 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Divil a 
bit do they care for that, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator: 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
• 
Of " St. Patrick's day in the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant parts:, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
'rhe tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you a 
wack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning !"

MICHAEL BRADY'S SHIRT. 
Composed and sung by GEo. W . 
CALLATIAN, the Ventriloquist. 
My name is Michael Brady, and I 
am not ashamed to own, 
1 
am honest and I 
am dacent if I 
am only left alone; 
But the gang that hangs around me they are a 
terrible clan, 
And when I 
moved around them I 
was like a 
crazy man. 
They roar and bawl the whole night long, with convers,
)-
tion strong, 
I 
haven't slept for forty nights in the house where I 
belorg 
Now the first one to kick up a 
row was Chateau Jane McG, e 
If my wife don't go up and fight with her, she'll come and 
tight with me. 
She stole a 
shirt from our back yard, and gave it to her 
son Dan. 
I 
took it from his back in a 
ball-room, by the owner I 
am 
the man. 
1 
made a 
holy show of him, I 
ran him down like dirt, 
And he near goes mad when the boys all cry: " Who stole 
Mike Brady's shirt?" 
Their rooms is to let in the parlor, Italians just moved in, 
With fourteen harps and fiddlers, all dacent Working min. 
What Mary McGaskin did last night, I 
swear it was a 
sin, 
She trun her durty dish-water on the mackirony min. 
Such holy murder you never heard, since the day that you 
was born, 
Was among them darned Italians in the house where I 
belong. 
Now there's my daughter Johanna, she sings ilianne 
store, 
She goes to balls and picnics with a 
huzzy of a 
girl next 
door. 
McFarling's boy he stole a 
goat and he put it in our wood-
shed, 
if he ever does the like agin. I'll brake his father's head. 
1 
am glad I 
am going to leave them to let them bawl and 
shout, 
I'll take down the stove to-morrow and be Heavins I'll 
move out.

McGILLIGANS' GANG.

Written by BARNEY ForaorsnN, and sung only by FERGUSON & N AM 
McGilligan's our name, and we are great, fine 
And great, fine men are we; 
We have a 
heart in us that's as big as a 
houst 
Our own business we mind, do you see; 
We have friends all around us on every side, 
We are good for whatever we demand; 
For we are the leaders and make no mistake, 
And the bosses of McGilligans' gang. 
ClIORUS: 
Then raise the crowd and shout aloud, 
And let your voices ring; 
We'll have you to know we're not too proud, 
To belong to McGilligans' gang. 
Us McGilligans we opened a 
mighty fine place, 
And a 
mighty fine place we had; 
We gave all the gang the free use of the slate, 
Till it took all our time up to add; 
We soon got disgusted at that sort of work, 
And it's quick up the shutters we banged; 
We allow that no sucker can play us for a 
turk, 
We are the leaders of McGilligans'

"Measure Yoincrants by Your Means?' 
Sung by H ARRY BECKWITH-. 
I 
once heard a 
proverb, worth ' graving in gold, 
'Twas spoken in years that arc past, 
And he too is gone who made it his own, 
But while there's a 
world it will last. 
The saying was pithy, its meaning was this: 
Which ever way Providence leans, 
If what fortune grants won't come up to your wants, 
You must bring down your wants ti your means. 
CHORUS. 
So think of my song as you journey along, 
Thro' life and its changeable scenes, 
If your wants prove too high for your means to supply, 
Why bring down your wants to your means. 
How often we see the gay man of the world, 
With money and plenty to spare, 
Did he use it aright, but he puts it to flight, 
And appears as tho' short of his share, 
Then he pays twenty shillings to borrow a 
pound, 
Till his folly no longer he screens, 
Thus he parts with his wealth, loses station and health, 
Thro' his wants overrunning his means. 
So think of my song, &c. 
The roughhanded ploughman, up early and late, 
Whose days with hard toil are beset, 
If he's scanty of clothes, it is nothing he owes, 
So he's richer than him who's in debt. 
For if homely his fare, he is happy withal, 
Tho' it's little from learning he gleans, 
And he never needs run from a 
bailiff or dun, 
For he measures his wants by his means. 
So think of my song, &c. 
Then ye who have little, and ye who have much, 
Enjoy what you've got in content; 
Nor squander your store and your health getting more; 
Live right, and you'll never repent. 
This world is a 
garden with pleasure well filled 
Tho' sorrow sometimes intervenes, 
But troubles will fly, as the clouds drifting by, 
if you " measure our wants by your means." 
•So think of my song, &c. 
MAHONEY'S FENIAN CAT. 
Written, composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the 
Ventriloquist. 
On our back fence at twelve at night 
A big buck cat, striped black and white, 
Meanders out to look for fight— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat. 
With an eye gouged out and ears chawed off, 
With a 
half-mast tail and the whooping cough; 
Strange ratters thought they'd something soft 
On Mali oney's four-act cat. 
No cat or dog had pluck or gaul 
To give McGuire's pup a 
fall, 
So down he went to open the ball 
With Maloney's Thomas dog. 
Out from McGuire's alley gate 
He straightway did perambulate, 
Intending to make sausage meat 
Of Mahoney's brindle cat. ' 
They met upon McGuire's shed, 
With hair on end and eyeballs red, 
With yells and howls twould raise the dead— 
The slaughter it began. 
In half the time ye'd say begob 
The air was full of Meauire's dog; 
While up and down McGuire's fence, 
The picture of pure innocence, 
Mahoney's cat sas-shayed. 
Then from the roof a 
brick was fired, 
I'd take me oath it was -McGuire; 
It struck the cat between the eyes, 
A.nd down he went, but he didn't rise. 
There's a 
statue where this hero lies— 
Mahoney's Fenian eat.

Many Can Help One. 
Sung with great success by H ARRY RICHMOND. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true ; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any 
Remember that many can always help one. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress ; 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by. 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the 
year  
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support. 
So give it to them who most treed, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
(Cho 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kinlness he's sure to return.

MY DAUGHTER BRIDGET. 
(Cho.? 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written by JAMES BRADLEY. 
Oh, I'm a 
young married man 
And I 
have a 
darling daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to, 
She said she fancied the stage 
And I 
gave her my final request, 
And now she's a 
great ballet dancer 
And she ranks along wid the rest. 
Crionus. 
On the bills she is Madame MeShorty, 
But the right name is Bridget McCarty, 
She comes home at night and also matinees, 
With large baskets of flowers and also boquets, 
She is my darling daughter 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To go around on her toes and wear spangled clothes, 
Such a 
darling young girl is my Bridget. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All toil and woe it does smother, 
Wash day she always will have 
A 
kick with her poor ould mother, 
She's got a 
young clerk in a 
bank, 
Who sees her right home to the door, 
And pays a 
large gang in the gallery 
To give her a 
hand and encore. 
((lho.us). 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
I 
took my old woman along. 
To a 
sitt, in the front I 
did take her, 
Bridget came out on the stage, 
My son Dannie was up in the tier, 
lie cried out " Go in, sister Bridget," 
And they threw him right out on his ear. 
(Chorus).

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what storks she'd tell to both you and I, 
Rut now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness Kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, ev.t.

O'HALLERA.N, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
A 
new a 
original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, 
in his new and original sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is O'Halleran, and fro a 
Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro. 
The blacliguards they see rue, arrah from me they'll 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'd run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS.

For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street, 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter whereer I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'Halleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman. 
For as I 
promenade, & c. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if J 
don't soon be mayor; 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, ra do everything I 
can, 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman.

OH1 WHAT A 
NOSE. 
:0:— 
As sung by BILLY M OORE. 
---- :0:  
Oh, in love I 
fell with a 
handsome gal, 
It was down at a 
fancy ball, 
She'd a 
boxing glove at the back of her head 
She wore for a 
waterfall. 
She was dressed in the height of fashion, 
And she said her name was Rose, 
I 
never shall forget her for 
She had such a 
wonderful nose. 
CHoRus: 
Oh, its didn't she have a 
nose, such a 
nose, 
Well, its not so very funny, I 
suppose, 
But when she would go out the children all would 
shout 
Jimney jumping geesewax what a 
nose. 
Oh, I 
took her to a 
restaurant, 
And set her down to supper; 
She fainted over the table, 
And she allowed her African nasal propensity to 
penetrate the butter, 
They used cold slaw to fetch her too, 
It was just a 
moment later 
When the limburger cheese it made her sneeze, 
And she choked to death with a 
lator.

198th Street. 
As sung by ENNIS and BONIFACE, the Funny Irish Comedians. 
You heard the song of the Boulevard, 
For to go there you must have a 
card, 
Where a 
poor man has to work so hard, 
From daylight in the morning. 
We once for a 
man did vote, 
He gave us a 
bit of a 
note, 
And on the back of it was wrote: 
" 
198th street." 
CHORUS. 
With your shovels and picks and clubs and sticks, 
And stones and bricks, and all such tricks 
We are good for nix, and we are heartily sick 
Of r9Sth street. 
They put two shovels in our hand, 
Told us to go dig up the land; 
But says we to ourselves, 
We see ye hanged to work upon ye railway 
Sure then they cut down our pay 
To a 
dollar and sixty cents a 
day ; 
But we see them to the devil 
Up in ig8th street. 
With your shovels, &c. 
At night when we lay down to sleep, 
The Yankee bugs does over us creep, 
And divil a 
wink they leave us sleep 
Till daylight in the morning. 
In the morning when we rise, 
We rub our sleepy eyes; 
And where do you think we flys, 
But to 196th street. 
With your shovels, &c.

Nit 
On the Road. 
Written by CHARLES F. 
JEROME. 
I 
tell you it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop right here, 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, ail the " man-
ager " I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got no 
money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get so 
funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board bill's up to-day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip away ; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only got one 
collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I 
owe him jut 
one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch a 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to- night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him dead to 
rights; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to do, 
And tell them not to yvash up until they get their money, too. 
And tell that " serio-comic queen" she'd better write for dates, 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her rival— 
" 
Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not be afraid, 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade. 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and stop this 
" 
beat," 
For he may think, as others do, that actors never eat ; 
And I 
know that I 
eat regular—that is, when I'm at home, 
And when I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will roam.

NEVER GIVE WAY. TO SORROW, 
Wrirke-,. h .TOIIN WALsn, and sung with great stikwsi 
al! over the world. 
htatty It man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong ; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with you be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn ; 
Luck some day may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. ( Chorus)

Never Venture, Never Win. 
;Itrig by H ARRY BECKWITH. 
Written by Jos. P. SKELLY. 
There's a 
maxim to remember 
If in life you would succeed; 
It is very plain and simple, 
It will serve you as a 
creed: 
If your courage should desert you. 
And you feel your hopes grow dim, 
Bear in mind this little motto: 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
CHORUS. 
On, on, on, and never be afraid, boys; 
On, on, on, with courage as your aid, boys; 
Try for the best, keep a 
cheerful heart within, 
Bear in mind this little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
When our fathers fought for freedom— 
And that boon was long denied— 
They beheld their foes retreating, 
And with death were satisfied ; 
They were true, and never weakened 
In the battle's wildest din, 
For they knew that little motto: 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
On, on, on, & c., 
When the lover sues for kisses, 
And the sweetheart is unkind, 
Don't depend upon her answer 
If she seems the least inclined; 
She may say that you are naughty, 
And that kissing is a 
sin; 
But you know she never means it— 
If you venture you will win. 
On, on, on, &c.,

Never Encourage Such Men. 
Neat Irish Song and Dance. 
Written and composed by G110. CARRY, and sung by CAREY and HANILIN 
with great success. 
Not long ago we came across the sea, 
And came out here to sing and dance for ye, 
Shure I 
thought it would break my heart 
When my from friends I 
had to part, 
And sail across the ocean far away. 
When we started it was in the glorious spring, 
Shure I 
thought it was a 
very curious thing, 
For to see the water splash and the ship and ( lash, 
I 
thought I 
never would see home again. ( Dance.) 
There is a 
girl of mine upon the other side, 
When I 
go back I'll make her my dear bride 
'Tis then I'll jump with glee, - 
And at night we'll have a 
spree, 
And we'll sing and dance until we do get tired. 
If the first one should happen for to be a 
boy 
'Tis then I'll sing and dance with joy 
For as shure as dogs are dogs, 
I'll make him put on the clogs, 
And we'll do a 
double act both him and I. 
(Dance.) 
Words and musk by AL. W . 
FILSON, and sung by him in all the 
principal theatres with marked success. 
I 
would like the attention of the ladies all, 
And when I 
am through you will see. 
If the boys do not like it I 
don't care a 
cent, 
But ladies with me you'll agree, 
Should a 
man accost you while meandering the street, 
Don't laugh or giggle for shame ; 
Don't notice such men, but pass on your way, 
If you don't you will be much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For a 
man will invariably pass a 
remark 
On a 
lady passing him on the walk; 
Now just move along, no encouragement give, 
Then about you they never can talk. 
Go into a 
ball room, be happy and gay 
With a 
handsome young man by your side, 
There he tells you he loves you, and at some future day 
He would be happy to make you his bride. 
But if he should pinch you or hug you a 
bit, 
Give him to understand there and then, 
And just tell him plainly he had better behave, 
As you never encourage such men. 
For a 
man will, &c. 
Now 
if you have a 
sweetheart, and by chance he gets broke, 
He will not hesitate to tell you, 
Then he will say to you, " Darling, 
Will you be so good as to lend me a 
dollar or two ?" 
If you lend him a 
cent now to- day, just see 
If to-morrow he will not want ten. 
So hold fast to your money, and don't be a 
fool, 
For you can spend it on all just such men. 
For a. man will, &c.

A 
privilege it is to be born in this land 
Of the noble, the proud and the free, 
Where each man will offer his heart and his hand, 
To drive out such cruel tyranny. 
Such as was practiced by English rule, 
In the days of oppression gone by; 
But like solid men to the front they did come, 
Determined to conquer or die. 
CHORUS. 
Then good people here just take my advice, 
No matter whatever you lag; 
If you should have the honor 'to adopt this land. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
If you take this advice you will surely find 
A 
blessing you'll find in the end; 
And you will be loved by the good and the kind, 
If to your duty you do well attend. 
But be not like the men who would gain themselves 
wealth, 
And to crime they will let themselves drag: 
But be honest and upright, and above, all you do, 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
Then good people, etc. 
It was under that flag that Benjamin Franlain was born, 
A 
statesman both noble and true. 
Though poor at the first, yet himself he did raise, 
To be proud of the red, white and blue. 
It was under that flag that George Washington was bore, 
The father of this country, 
And with many others he nobly fought, 
To make it the land of the free. 
Then good people, eta.

I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I 
often think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm longing to see; 
There's a sighing in my heart which keeps 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
Cllonus: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
how happy then I 
will be; 
When I'm welcomed back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the green; 
now oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A wander no longer I'll be; 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me.

TEETOOTAL IN THE MORNING. 
Written, composed and sung by HARRY W HALING, at TONY PASTOR'S 
e 
THEATRE, New York. 
I'm one of those awful jolly dogs 
Who love to lounge all day, 
And come what will, or what folks preach, 
I'm sure to have my way. 
Some say that I've more brass than brains, 
Some truth in that may be ; 
I'm known throughout the country as 
The swell who loves a 
spree. 
CHORUS: 
Then come if you're coming, boys, out with me, 
Come if you're coming for a 
jolly good spree ; 
Then come if you're coming, to-night we'll merry be, 
We'll all be teetotal in the morning. 
Teetotal is my motto when 
My temperance friends I 
meet, 
To hear them praise me for being good 
It is a 
jolly treat ; 
But should they see me when I'm tight, 
And wish to give me warning, 
I 
say " Friend Joe, I'll promise you 
To be teetotal in the morning." ( Chorus). 
With lots of coin, why sit at home 
And mope both night and day; 
The song says, life is but a 
span— 
Be happy while ye may. 
A brimming glass, a 
pretty lass, 
Is what I 
love to see ; 
A jolly lark, boys, after dark 
Is just the thing for me. 
Who's going to have a 
night with me, 
For I 
intend some fun, 
I'll stand for all both rich and poor, 
No man I'll ever shun. 
You can always share whate'er I've got; 
A penny or a 
pound, 
The money, so the proverb says, 
Is round and must go round. 
(Chorus).

Where the water lillies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me darling Annie. 
When the whippoorwill cloth call, 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kisis me darling Annie. 
CHORUS. 
.When the flowers fall asleep 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie. 
Hearken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie. 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Press:ag such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie. 
When the flowers fall asleep, &c. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whispering softly " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie.

Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
List'ning to the vows I 
take, 
From you darlin

Where the watermelons grow, 
The wind in the key of Coloth blow; 
Where the rippling waters ramble, 
O'er the mossy jack-stones; 
Meet me with thy glossy smile, 
Blushes fan thy granite brow; 
Sylph-like glide thy cow-hide footsteps, 
Oh, ho, ho, hallo me Hannah.

When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the night-mare trots the deep. 
Come back home in your bare feet. 
Beloved, fair one, me Annie. 
When thy young heart's pure and free, 
Beats, dead beats, alone for me; 
Musha Mickey, Mikey, oh, ho, ho, ho, 
Thin be jabers, Annie; 
Ach du hist verrtickt mein kind, 
Pigeon-toed are thy footsteps; 
Hear the hydrant how it fizzles, 
Down by the Tan Yard, me Annie.

Rush back home and let us eat,

Your Pocket Book is Your Best Friend. 
Words and music written for HARRY BECKWITH by ARTHUR W. 
FRENCH. iv-
?
IF 
As you pass day by day thro' life's crowded highway 
You will find it is hard to succeed ; 
There'll be many a 
time, as the hillside you climb, 
When you'll wish for a 
friend in your need. 
For this troublesome life it is only a 
strife 
As to who shall rise up or descend; 
If a 
man is not blind he will very soon find 
That his pocketbook is his best friend. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, a 
friend in our need is a 
true friend indeed, 
Upon this you may truly depend; 
And to give, or to lend, or to beg, borrow, spend, 
A 
man's pocketbook is his best friend. 
There are friends you deem true they will linger near you 
In the smiles of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day they will vanish away 
Like the fading of sweet summer flowers. 
As you wander alone, quite forgotten, unknown, 
And misfortunes upon you descend, 
in that sorrowful day you'll be quite apt to say— 
Yes, my pocketbook was their best friend. 
Yes, a 
friend in our, & c. 
You may be very poor, so you cannot secure 
What you need for the loved ones at home; 
For their wants to provide to beg you decide, 
As you out in the dreary street wan. 
Thdre some old friend you meet and your story repeat, 
Not a 
dollar he'll give you or lend ; 
And you say with a 
sigh, as he passes you by, 
Yes, his pocketbook is his best friend. 
Yes, a 
friend in our, ez.c.

YOU MAY KISS AND CARESS ME. 
As sung by LEsTER & W ILLIANS.

'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a 
lean banana core, 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I 
asked her for her hand . 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
Cnonus: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no; 
Buy me a 
Tom and Jerry, a 
keg of beer or so, 
'Int don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la in lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss Inc you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say: 
i.JHOltUS: 
You may kiss roe and caress me and I'll never say nix, 
Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll strike you with a

You may chew my alabaster ear, I'll never make a

Oh I 
have loved often, and I 
have loved many, 
But theres none in this wide world like sweet little 
Terry; 
His eyes are as bright as the stars in the sky, 
And my heart it is thumping whenever he's nigh; 
If there was an island way over the sea, 
And only room on it for Terry and me; 
Oh, I'd live there alone from December till June, 
Along with my darling, sweet Terry McGoon. 
CHORUS: 
Terry! Terry! Terry McGoon, 
Hoist up your window and look at the moon; 
Oh I'd knock any man to the middle of June, 
That dared to make love to you, Terry McGoon. 
It was only last Sunday, says Terry to me, 
Just make up your mind, girl, and married we'll be; 
But ray mother she told me, and here's what she said, 
Don't ever get married, but live an old maid; 
But my mother's advice I 
put out of my head, 
I 
won't be an old maid; I 
wish they were dead! 
Oh! he promised to meet me by the light of the moon, 
For he is my darling, sweet Terry MeGoon.

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP.

All! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
Tne lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate gram 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow.

LITTLE NELLY RAY. 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a

With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown hair;

Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all.

Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a

And being on my holidays, to spend them there I

And while a

roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, & e.

sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to.be my bride, 
Nilly Ray, &c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy tve 
shall be. 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the 1

BOB SLAM'S REMARKS, 
Sung, with great success, by Bob Slavin. 
There are a 
great many sayings I've heard in my time, 
And half I 
believe to be lies, 
While the rich man is feasting on peanuts each day, 
The poor man is starving on pies. 
It's a 
shame in the land the Italians call free, 
We can't get money our eyebrows to dye, 
The poor working girl wears her gall out for a 
million a 
week, 
And takes weekly baths in six cent rock and rye. 
CHORUS— 
Then remember my sayings, when you are insane, 
Counting the dimes by the penny, 
Remember you have a 
moustache of your own, 
While the poor working girl hasn't any. 
My name is Hart the walker, 
I 
used to wear two-cent paper collars, 
But since I 
made 565 miles, 
I 
am worth fourteen thousand dollars. 
I 
don't mix up with colored trash, 
I 
make a 
living by my legs, 
I 
eat Charlotte Russe and stewed ice cream, 
Custard pie and scrambled eggs.

CUMBERLAND'S CREW, 
Sung with great success by Devlin -(
F.: Tracy. 
Oh ! shipmates, come, gather and loin in my ditty, 
I 
t's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saving: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crevi 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er;

CUMBERLAND'S CREW.—Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them. 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid-ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through; 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

Never prove false to a

In love and in friendship be true; 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
He may be dishonest—a 
knave— 
In other's opinion—but then 
To you he is generous and kind, 
And one of the noblest of men.

All righteous and good in his ways ? 
Lives there a 
woman on earth, 
That she can be named but in praise ? 
Never speak ill of a

To gossipers keep closed your ear ; 
An excellent rule, in the main, 
Is to credit one-tenth what you hear.

Stand by a 
man in distress, 
When you know he is really in need ; 
Altho' by misfortune he falls, 
There's honor for you in the deed ; 
That one may deceive you 'tis true, 
Then his, and not yours, the disgrace; 
Because we find one man untrue, 
Should we wrong and distrust a 
whole race f

Censure a 
man for his faults, 
Give him honor where honor is due; 
But never prove false to a

So long as he's faithful to you. 
But should you prove false to a

And think he's ungrateful to you,

Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground ; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
for there's a 
bloody law agin, the wearin' o' the green ? 
1 
met with Napper Tandy and he tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for " Wearin' o' 
the Green !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear, is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sous will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still, tho' under foot 'tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
• not show ; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen ; 
But 'till that day, please God, I'll stick to ‘• Wearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and. sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
Mist we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
Ind where thank God, we'll live and die, still 
Weariu'

We're a 
dandy pair, and the people stare 
Alike, the rich and poor; 
So gay, so gay the moments fly away, 
Our voices ring as we laugh and sing, 
While on our wedding tour. 
We have wandered to the sea, 
Where the waves are wild and free; 
We have stood on mountains high, 
Gazing at the summer sky, 
Far away in Spain and France; 
We have watched the latest dance, 
And in Erin's lovely land, 
Oft we met r. friendly hand. 
Sure, oh sure Ote, 
Now we're going to settle down, 
In some corner of the town, 
There we hope our friends will call, 
Welcome is the word to all; 
We will have a 
drop to spare, 
And besides a 
vacant chair; 
Friendly words for every one, 
Song and dance and boundless bin. 
Sure, O.10-itirc:4t,„

The Wedding Day. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written, composed and sung by J. E. M URPHY, of Idt12211T 4% Mem 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. Harding, 229 Bowf `y, dixtd sea t 
to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 36 cents 
When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
AU the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boqueta, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride, ( Chorus.)

THE WILD IRISH BOY, 
saw; by MILES Monsis. at Fox's American Theatre, Philad'a, Pa. 
FAREWELL to the dear land I 
have left far behind, 
Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
yes, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the noys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they will come here, 
To a 
land flied with plenty and a 
land I 
love dear, 
I 
know they will bless me and it will give -me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, the- will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
There's the land of my kindred, I 
ne'er can forget, 
They may be a 
time coming when it may be happy yet, 
I 
wish to God it were now, for ' twould give me great joy, 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
Yes, to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
1-1 11 11 PTY DU MPTY 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by ceii 
the Professors of Magic. 
Ph.PINPIOW1•0\11M044 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orde; 
has been sent us, called HIPAIPTY Dumpry,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
It is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap• 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of H arl
equi
n, 
:n his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at ,home in the hand-
ing of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin. ,
