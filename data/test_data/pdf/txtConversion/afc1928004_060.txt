SONGSTER. 
WHAT AM I DOING / 
As sung by Jonwsy W ILD with great applause, at TONY PASTOWS 
Opera House, 201 Bowery, New -York. 
Ain—" Wait Till You Get It." 
THE RusRians of late being inclined for a 
trade, 
To America the first offer they made 
Of a 
vast tract of land in the Northern clime, 
Which Seward accepted and settled in time. 
CHORUS. 
What am I 
doing, 
What am I 
doing, 
What am I 
doing, 
Look at me now. 
John Bull . saw the bargain, and felt rather sore 
That he wasn't offered the purchase before ; 
Says he, now the Yankees the world with control, 
And they'll hang out. their banners upon the North Pole. 
10 
DIS AM WHAT I DID. 
CHORUS. 
I'll bet you we'll do it, 
I'll bet you we'll do it, 
I'll bet you we'll do it, 
You bet that we will. 
The monarchs of Europe don't make such a 
din, 
The Union is open, we'll let them come in; 
We have room for them all, young, old, short and tall, 
Yankee Doodle is the boy that will father them all. 
CHORUS. 
He's ready to do it, 
He's ready to do it, 
He's ready to do it, 
I'll bet you he is. 
DIS AM WHAT I 
DID. 
Song and Dance, sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
W HTTE folks. your att-ntion 
I 
ask a 
while of you ; 
I 
feel so loose and careless, 
That I 
don't know what to do; 
I 
felt so 
ond this morning, 
Down the stairs I 
slid; 
When they asked me what the matter was, 
Why dis is what I 
did. 
When I 
first come to this city, 
The folks they dressed so neat, 
All in the height of fashion, 
From their head down to their feet; 
MY OLD WIFE AND I. 
I 
went into an auction store,. 
And for dese shoes did bid, 
When dey tole me to lay down de cash, 
Why dis am what I 
did. 
I 
went den to get married 
To my Sue so slim and tall; 
My massa s 
clothes just fitted me 
Like paper on the wall ; 
When the preacher man he says to me, 
Which nal are you going to wed, 
And in answer to the preacher man, 
Why dis am what I 
did.

MY OLD Win. AND I. 
As sung by the limEnNTAN Boys at TONY PASTOR'S Opera House, 
201 Bowery, New York. 
' 
SUCH a 
jolly old couple as here you see 
There is not in this whole world wide; 
For forty years together, my buys, 
We've travelled side by side; 
A pattern to the neighbors round 
44' 
My good old wife has been; 
And such a 
jolly old fellow as mine 
Has never yet been seen. 
CHORus. 
Round goes the world 
Trouble I 
defy, 
Jonninn along together, my boys, 
My dear old wife and I. 
We've seen some wonders in our time, 
And wi,nessed many a 
change, 
12 
DATtEEY'S DREAM. 
Our customs, too, since we were young, 
Are daily proving strange; 
But there's a 
thing shall never change, 
As you may plainly see, 
The love I 
bear for my e 
d 
wife, 
And my old wife for me. 
Round goes the, etc. 
Now, younc, folks, just take my advice, 
As this world you go through, 
Always do unto others 
As you would have them do to you; 
To care and sorrow don't give way, 
Bid trouble pass you by, 
And then you'll be like my old man, 
And my old wife and I. 
Round goes the, etc. 
DARKEY'S DREAM. • 
As sung by JOHNNY -WILD. 
1r you will listen now to me, 
I'll tell von what's my policy ;

You'll catch 'cm sure on 7 
first. 
But I 
didn't, etc. 
SONG- AND DANCE. 
So then I 
thought I 
could win, 
But Ben Wood said, just try again; 
And as my pile was not so big, 
1 
paid five cents and bought a 
gig. 
But I 
didn't, etc. 
The more I 
dreamed, the more I 
dropped, 
They cleaned me out before I 
stopped; 
I 
played the saddle and the horse, 
And now I'm played out with my boss. 
But I 
didn't, etc. 
To policy I've given the shake, 
The more you put the less you take; 
To Blackwell's Island, free from care, 
That horse and gig will land you there. 
But I 
d,dn't, etc.

But Nancy Fat and Susie Brown and Annie Marie Jane, 
The Ham Fat man he's smothered to death with dancing

When the ball was out they all came down the street, 
And for a

The Ham Fat man and Susie Brown they both got in a 
row, 
How Susie Brown did get out, I 
cannot tell you how. 
.(Chorus and dance same as before.) 
I'M SEVENTY-FIVE. 
As 
sung by JOFINNY W ILD, at TRIMBLE'S, Pittsburg, Pa. 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
The youngest old than that's alive; 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
And to be jolly I 
contrive; 
I'm never sad but I'm always gay, 
All care and sorrow I 
drives away, 
I 
cracks my joke and I 
likes my smoke, 
And I 
takes my toddy three times a 
day. 
Then higglety jigglety, ain't I 
free, 
I 
laugh and sing and dance with glee; 
So now good people look at me. 
I'm a 
jolly old fellow, as yOu may see. 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
The merriest old man that's alive; 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
Away all trouble and care 1

HI CUM GO. 
15 
Yes, over fifty years ago, 
At New Orleans I 
fought the foe, 
Then went to the polls in my soger coat, 
And for General Jackson I 
cast my vote.. 
Then hipperty hopperty, I've my joys, 
To laugh and sing and make a 
noise; 
And with the girls I 
often toys, 
I'm a 
gay old fellow and one of the boys: 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
The happiest old man that's alive ; 
I'M Seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
And still to please my friends I 
strive; 
On Sunday I 
think it's very queer 
To'cleprive an old fellow like me of his beer, 
But them Excise Commissions I 
fool all right. 
SPOKEN.— Ha, ha, ha! I'll tell you what I 
do, I 
fills my 
bottle on Saturday night. 
Then widdle waddle, what fun I

So now, young people, look wide awake, 
From this merry old fellow example take.

THE PEANUT GIRL OF NORILE. 
, 
AN 
sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
Tnrs song is of a 
pretty girl, 
In Mobile she did dwell, 
Her father kept a 
peanut stand, 
• And melons for to sell; 
And when her dad for melons he went,, 
He'd leave the stand in charge 
Of this pretty little charming girl, 
With eyes so very large. 
Her hair was black as jet could be, 
And curled around so nice, 
Her pretty neck so like a 
swan, 
Would any one entice, 
OCTOROON . 
21 
And swarms of young noblemen 
Would flock around each day, 
To flirt with this young damsel, 
That sold peanuts near the bay; 
One day the father went to dine, 
Just at the usual hour, 
lie told his daughter not to mind 
Those young men any more, 
For if you do you'll surely rue 
Their cunning winning ways, 
And trust them with my melons more, 
Such work it never pays. 
So when her father' went away, 
' 
And left her there alone, 
Her beaux around the corner came 
Soon as they saw -him gone ; 
They played, kissed, and courted her, 
With loving hearts so sweet, .• 
And pretty soon they cleared the stand 
Of all the old man's fruit. 
OCTOROON. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
As I 
was roving down the street, 
The other afternoon, 
While crossing of a 
walk I 
met 
A 
pretty Octoroon. 
She glanced at me so slyly, 
As she was passing by, 
1 
never shall forget that 
Darling roguish , little eye. (Break.) -
I 
turned around to look at her, 
And ethers did the same, 
22 
OCTOROON. 
She was so much attraction, 
That they weren't much to blame. 
She was dressed in height of fashion, 
High heeled boots and musharoon, 
She looked so gay my heart went with 
This pretty Octoroon. 
The other day as I 
walked in 
To an ice-cream saloon, 
I 
(
rot an introduction to 
got 
pretty Octoroon. 
We chatted there quite sociably, 
Until it got quite late ; • 
She took my arm, we walked along, 
Until we reached the gate. (Break.) 
She asked if I'd call on her, 
Of course I 
did consent, 
She pressed her parting lips to mine, 
And in the house she went. 
I 
never shall forget that kiss, 
At least not very soon; 
She kissed so sweet I 
taste it yet, 
bat pretty Octoroon. 
The other day I 
called on her, 
A 
little while to stay, 
I 
found.her pa and ma were . home, 
I 
wished them far away. 
Her pa said, " who are you, sir 1" 
And he grabbed me by the coat, 
Said I, " I 
am head steward on 
A 
Coney Island boat." (Break.) 
He ordered me to leave the house, 
Which I 
did without delay, " 
The gal she said she'd meet me, 
Where we met the other day. 
So white folks, please excuse me, 
For leaving you so soon,

Such a

Everybody's getting it and none seem to complain,

There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invitation, 
I 
went and got my purtty's on with the greatest exulta-

W ELL, boys, for divarsion, we've all met together, 
I'll tell you how from Waterford lather I 
came ; 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, . 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the same. 
I 
lifted a 
song as I 
tripped it along ; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy. 
And as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
roe the price of a 
drink, I 
was mortally dry. 
But we are the boys for full, wit and sentiment, 
Drinking and dancing and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment, 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled, 
" 
Good mornite," says he: 
Says I, '' if you. please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring me some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese 3 
For times they are queer, and provisions are dear, 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content."

bite, 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I

But we are the, etc. 
My bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose, so I 
bade ' em good- night; 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the 
light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed- post, 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended; 
Thinks I, ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost! 
But we are the, etc. 
The row, it commences, near out of my senses,

WAITING FOR A BROADWAY STAGE. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
AS 
up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye -; 
Her iittle short skirts in pc) nts hung down, 
For that style's all the rage ; 
She was looking up and down, with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh 
cuortus. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage ; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age; 
1 
met her on the corner ; it was there that first I 
saw 
her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
Just 1.1ayed round her face, and, with such ease and 
grace. 
Why, like an angel she did seem. 
But I 
kept getting like one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage ; 
How I 
wished I'd never have seen that handsome little

But as the ice was broken, my hat, of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, she required, soon came by; 
When she said in tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll 
meet, 
As up the steps her little form did fly. 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me ' twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that lit tie girl I. met,

song I'm going to sin. you, 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking; 
And she threw such a 
glance at me. 
She was pretty and sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a, flower garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh, my! she looked so sweet and dressed so neat, 
With her tilting hoops and pi etty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me. 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda. 
42 
MY LOVE NELL. 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won 
her, 
And married we shou'd be. 
So I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear 
Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh, my, etc. 
Oh, you should have seen her on her wedding day, 
She was handsome as a 
Venus, 
When the parson made us one, alt then the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So I've bowfin a 
little place out of town, 
If you go by. step in and see. 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
'Oh, my, etc.

About my love and me.

As the heart of a

But sorry I'm to say my love is gone away

For if I

I

And " Come up, Neddy

Whilst he was out a-crying g

THE BIG SUNFLOWER. 
As sung by XOLINICY W ILD, at TRIMBLE'S Varieties, Pittsburg, Pa. 
THERE is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen; 
My heart beats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed in green ; 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So loving and so shy; 
And the folks all stop and look around, 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sunflower, 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the trees—zees. 
46 
SHE WAS HANDSOME AS A ROSE . 
As days past on, and we became 
Like friends of olden times, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And ask her to be mine; 
But the answer I 
received next day— 
How could she treat me so! 
Instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered, no. 
And I 
feel just as happy, etc. 
I 
went next day, dressed in my best, 
This young girl for to see ; 
To ask her if she would explain 
Why she had shaken me ; 
She said she really felt quite sad 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said " wont you be mine'? " 
Of course she answered " yes." 
And I 
feel just as happy, etc. 
SHE WAS HANDSOME AS A 
ROSE; OR SHE WAS SUCH 
A CHARMER. 
Song and Dance, sung by JOHNNY 
I'LL sing to you a 
song, 
And try to please you all ; 
It's about a 
yellow charmer 
I 
met at a 
fancy ball ; 
She was handsome as a 
rose, 
Her eyes were black as sloes, 
And when upon her I 
did gaze, 
She stole my heart away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she was such a 
charmer, 
I 
had her for a 
partner; 
FLYING TRAPEZE. 
47 
She was handsome as a 
rose, 
her eyes were black as sloe; 
And when upon her I 
did gaze, 
She stole my, heart away. 
Now I 
will her describe, 
As I 
met her at the ball; 
She'd a 
boxing glove upon her head, 
Meant for a 
waterfall ; 
Her waist \yds tall and slender, 
Her feet like a 
giraffe, 
And when she took a 
promenade, 
She made the darkeys laugh. 
Oh, she was such a 
charmer, etc. 
I 
took her to her home, 
And lingered at the door; 
Oh! there I 
felt so happy, as 
I'd never felt before! 
I 
asked her mine to be, 
She only gave a 
smile, 
But her eyes they pierced me thro' and thro', 
I 
know she'll yet be mine. 
Oh, she was such a 
charmer, etc. 
PLYING TRAPEZE. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ONCE I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn, 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens. 
The girl that I 
loved she was handsome, 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please, 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well, 
Like that man upon the trapeze 
FLYLNC+ TRAPEZE. 
CHORUS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A daring young man on the flying trapeze; 
His movements were graceful, all girls he could, please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was Signor Bona Slang, 
Tall, big and handsome, as well made as Chang; 
Where'er he appeared, the hall loudly rang 
With ovations from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below, 
And one night he smiled on mY love '•  
She winked back at him, and shouted " Bravo" 
As he hung by his nose up above. 
He'd fly through, etc. 
Her father and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride .; 
Her father he sighed and her mother she cried, 
To See her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail; she went there every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her—how he ran me down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. 
He'd. fly through, etc. 
Some months after this I 
went to a 
hall— 
Was greatly surprised to see on the wall 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him! . 
He taught her gymnastics, and dressed her in tights, 
To help him to live at his ease; 
And made her assume a 
masculine name, 
And now she goes on the trapeze. 
DARBY M 'GITIE.E. 
49 
CHORUS. 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease— 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying trapeze; 
She does all the work while he takes his ease, 
And that's what's become of my love. 
DARBY MTITTIRR. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME say ' twas in England I 
first saW the light, 
And others in Scotland would have my first night; 
But, as writers on heroes are often astray, 
I 
think for myself 
have something to say. 
Oh ! the night I 
was born, sure. I 
very well know, 
i 
4 
When the clergyman tumbled in, covered with snow; 
He laid hold of myself, and sat down by the fire, 
And made a 
good boy of young Darby AFCruire. 
CHORUS. 
Then, hurrah for Ould Ireland, the land of my birth! 
'Tis there you'll get plenty of pleasure and mirth, 
Where the beautiful girls are sure to admire 
Such rollicksome fellows as Darby M'Guire! 
From christ'nings to weddings what heavenly bliss, 
As I 
stand by the bride and obtain the first kiss, 
While the creature looks sly as if nothing occurred, 
And the husband looks daggers, but daren't say a 
word; 
Och ! then, for the carving of praties and pigs ! 
The piper begins for to " rattle the jigs," 
The girls they jump up, and begin to perspire 
At the pleasure of dancing with Darby AUGuire! 
Then hurrah, etc. 
For twenty miles round, at a 
market or fair, 
I'm sure to be found, if I 
don't be elsewhere; 
30 
PAT M'CANN AND SWEETHEART. 
I'm just on the spot when a 
row is begun, 
knd l'm smashing away, for the sake of the fun. 
'TN then that you'll see the blackthorns all fly, 
Milla murther! you'd think ' Was a 
show'r from the sky ! 
And who wins the battle 7 
I 
never inquire, 
They're all " blood relations" to Darby M'Guire. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
But, speaking of rows, I 
don't wish to offend, 
For I'm always the boy to assist a 
poor friend ; 
Though first in the field, and not last in the row, 
I 
can mind number one, and look after the plough. 
Some paint ragged Pat with a 
villainous face, 
But I 
hope none of that in my own you can trace; 
To see every man happy is all I 
desire, • 
Contented and jovial, like Darby M'Guire. 
Then hurrah, etc.

It's the truth now, what I 
say, 
The boys that you may meet, 
They're sure to shout, when you walk out, 
Iii! Governor, how's your poor old feet'? 
So now I've had my say, 
I'll just begin to toddle, 
About sixty years ago • 
I 
could run instead of waddle. 
But Fm glad to see you here, 
Whenever I've the chance; 
So now I'll bid you all good-bye, 
And off at once I'll dance. 
CIIOHTJS. 
No wonder you may laugh, 
When I 
say off I'll dance ; 
There was a 
time when r 
could, 
But now the rheumatics won't give me a 
chance. 
NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
I'VE seen a 
bit of gavety throughout my short career, 
I 
once was foolish with my tin, but I 
have paid most dear. 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go, 
I'm up to almost everything—you can't get over Joe.

NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
53 
CHOR US . 
Oh, dear no, not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph, 
Oh, no, no, not for Joe—not for Joseph, oh dear, no. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gayly down Broadway, but ere I 
went away 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh yes, said he, I 
think I 
will, then let it be champagne. 
SPOKEN.—No you don't, my dear fellow, you don't 
get champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh, dear, no, etc. 
Some time ago a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine, 
He said, she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots 
of tin, 
A widow only forty-two, go in, my boy, and win. 
SPOKEN.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow 
only forty-two 
well, the money is very good, but then 
the widow— 
Oh, dear, no, etc. 
Of late in town there was a 
fuss about the " Japs" so 
grand, 
And also of the Russians who visited our land 
And then the country companies we greet with hearty 
cheers, 
We hope they have been well received by the New York 
volunteers. 
SPOKEN.—What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die 
for your country. 
What can be more glorious than a 
bul-
let in your eye1 
What can be more painful than a 
bul-
let in your eye'? 
Nothing I 
should think. 
Oh, dear, no, etc.

R. 
And now perhaps I've sung my song, you might be in 
the cue, 
To show your kind acknowledgment, but that with me 
won't do ; 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to 
know; 
So if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe. 
Oh, dear, no, etc. 
JOHNNY SCHMOKER. 
As sung with immense success by JonNsty W ILD. 
IN 
this song, an old German musician tells his friend, 
Johnny Schmoker, about the instruments upon which he 
can play, and desc:ibes them by motions while he sings. 
When performed by a chorus, especially of men, the 
movements being in exact time, and all together, an effect 
is produced which has not been equalled by anything of 
the kind ever produced in this country. 
Observe that 
the motions are made only when the words describing the 
instruments are sung, as for example, at " Rub a 
dub 
a 
dub," the roll of the drum is irni:ated, beginning ( as 
in the case of all the instruments) with the fh•st, and end-
ing exactly with the last word 
at'• Pil y 
wiLy wink," 
the hands are placed as if playing the fil?, 
and the 
fingers only move 
at" Tic knock knock," the right 
hand strikes three times under the left, as if playing, the 
triangle ; at " Born born born," the hand is moved for-
ward and back, as if playing the trombone ; and so on 
the last, which is imitated by crooking both arms and 
striking with them against the sides ; as if playing the 
bag- pipe. 
Observe that the singing at some of the in-
struments is loud, and others soft ; also, that the phrase 
where each instrument is 
first mentioned, is repeated, 
and that the first movement, which is sung when each in-
strument is introduced, is, to save room, printed but once.

PULLING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM. 
AS sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
IN 
the world I've gained my knowledge, 
And for it I 
ve had to pay, 
Though I 
never went to college, 
Yet I've heard that poets say 
PULLING HARD AGAINS T THE STREAM. 
57 
" 
Life is like a 
mighty river, 
Rolling on from day to day, 
-Men are vessels launched upon it, 
Sometimes wrecked and cast away." 
CHORUS . 
So then do your best for one another, 
Making life a 
pleasant dream ; 
Help a 
worn and weary brother, 
Pulling hard against the stream. 
Many a 
bright good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow, 
Then assist him if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too, though more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, etc. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those whose luckless labor 
Never get fair winds at all ; 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide, 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the stream. 
So then, etc. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
140, this keep you in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to-morro‘v, 
If you try and persevere. 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast,

DEAR FATHER, COME DOWN, ETC. 
Longest lanes must have a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. 
So then, etc. 
DEAR FATHER, COME DOWN WITH THE STAMPS. 
As sung by JOHNNY W
ILD. 
On, father, dear father come down with the stamps, 
My dressmaker's bill is unpaid ; 
She said she would send it right home from the shop, 
As soon as the flounces were made. 
Come down, come down, come down, 
Please father, dear father, come down! 
CHO lt IIS . 
Oh, hear the sweet voice of thy child, 
Who cries in her room all alone; 
Oh! who could resist her most pitiful tears 7 
So, father, with stamps quick come down! 
My new dress from Stewart's is down in the hall, 
The boy will not leave without pay; 
I've nothing to sport with—can t 
go to the ball, 
So please send the shop boy away. 
Come down, come down, come down, 
Please father, dear father, come down! 
Oh, hear the sweet voice, etc. 
Oh father, dear father, come down with the stamps, 
My curls are not fit to be seen; 
The hairdresser said he would not do them up 
Unless I 
could pay him fifteen. 
Come down, come down, come down, 
Please father, for Braiteau come down. 
Oh, hear the sweet voice, etc. 
LINDA'S GONE TO BALTIMORE.

I 
don't know what to do. 
I. take the banjo on my knee, 
But cannot bear to play, 
For music only makes me sad, 
When Linda's gobe away, 
When Linda's gone away. 
Oh, my heart am very lonely 
All the night and day, 
For every thing seems sad and drear, 
When Linda's gone away. 
I 
think of all the olden times 
We've had when she was here, 
I 
did not know ' till she was gone, 
That she was half so dear. 
The flowers are blooming all around, 
And all but me 
e 
gay, 
For all the time I 
think or dream 
Of Linda far away. 
Oh, my heart am very lonely, etc.

ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS, 
ETC. 
Though many years have pass'd and gone 
Since we were in our prime, 
I 
loved her more as on we roam'd 
Adown the Vale of Time! 
How very much she thinks of me, 
I 
should not dare to say; 
But oh, it always breaks my heart 
When Linda's gone away. 
Oh, my heart am very lonely, etc. 
ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS AS YOU'D WISH TO BE 
DONE BY. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY W ILO. 
WE 
meet with many curious folks, 
As thro' the world we roam, 
Some who are full of fun and jokes, 
While others pine and moan ; 
I 
care not whether grave or gay, 
One thing we all should try, 
That is, " to do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
CHQRITE. 
Then bear good 
ill to all men, 
It's easy if you'll but try, 
And always " do to others, as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
Perhaps in business you've been wronged 
By some " defaulting rogue," 
For by such scamps the world is thronged, 
They long have been in vogue; 
Don't seek revenge on such a 
wretch, 
But to forgive him try, 
SIMPLE SIMON. 
And. thus you " do to others, as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear good will, etc. 
If you are rich, and some old friend 
Is " down at heel" and poor, 
Well, IA 
the bar of nature bend, 
And " open wide your door" 
To welcome him as you are wont 
"in better days gone by," 
And thus you do to him, poor man, 
As " you'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear good will, etc. 
I 
think of what I've said or sung, 
In this my song to-night, 
That I 
have proved to every one 
The glorious might of right. 
So let us all make this resolve, 
And keep it till we die, 
That is, " to do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear good will, etc.

SIMPLE SIMON. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
On ; they call me Simple Simon, tho' my name is Simon 
Snip; 
I 
saved a 
little money, so I 
took a 
little trip; 
Go where I 
will, do what I 
may, it always is the same, 
For without an introduction, people seem to . know my 
name; 
For they say Simon ( that is what they say to me„ 
And judging from your smiles around, what a 
Simon I 
must be ; 
62 
SIMPLE SIMON. 
Oh my name it seems familiar, and they say it with a 
grin, 
And they treat me like a 
Simon, for they always take me 
in. 
Oh I 
thought that I 
could fancy a 
lady in Broadway, 
I 
don't think it was Nancy, tho' she tried to do the gay; 
We went into the country, where she made the driver 
tight, 
When she took away my money, and the driver wished to 
fight; 
And he said, " Simon," and came squaring up to me, 
"Come on," said he, " if you're a 
man, what a 
Simon 
should be ! " • 
lie was big enough to eat me, I 
qlid not wish to stay 
For to fatten such a 
cannibal, so Simon ran away. 
I 
went to Niblo's Garden to see the White Fawn. 
When I 
quickly found that from my fob my watch was 
bein ,, drawn ; 
I 
called police! 
they turned me out for making such a 
noise; 
I 
fancy I 
still bear the shout of all the little boys, 
Saying Simon, and all did so—at me; 
For any one to lose a 
watch, it is such a 
jolly spree; 
There's nothing half so funny as a 
watch and chain to 
lose, 
Misfortune to a 
little man is sure for to amuse. 
I 
looked in vain, for I 
could not find the author of the 
crime, 
I 
found that looking for my watch was only losing time ; 
I 
said, now my poor tick will stop; now my old ticker's 
gone, 
When I 
felt a 
hand upon me drop, and a bobby said, 
" 
move on," 
" 
Simon, come move along," said be, " a 
robbery upon my 
beat 
I 
am sure there could not be ; 
TILE CHARMING CHEESEMONGER. 
63 
You simple looking Simon now march, I 
say, 
On every beat that. I'm upon, all thieves must run away." 
I 
called on Mr. — and begged he'd let me sing, 
When he said, " all, Simple Simon, I 
shall do no such 
thing ; " 
He thought my application a 
simple bit of chaff, 
But I 
gained the situation because I 
made him laugh ; 
And he said, " Simon," these words he said to me, 
" 
If you can only make them laugh, that is all I 
want to 
see ; " 
This is your servant, Simon, the gratitude I 
feel, 
Words can't express his sentiments, so listen to his heels. 
THE CHARMING =EU:MONGER. 
As sung by JOHNNY "W ILD. 
A IR—" The Flying Trapeze." 
SOME distance from here, but I 
must not tell where, 
There lives a 
young fellow so handsome and fair; 
A 
cheesernonger's shop-man he is, I 
declare, 
And civil as civil can be. 
He always attracts such attention, 
As loudly he cries, " Buy, buy, buy," 
But what his name is I %yin not mention, 
Because I've a 
good reason why. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he is so obliging, he strives hard to please, 
While serving the butter, effgs, bacon, and cheese ; 
When taking the money my hand he will squeeze, 
lie's such a 
delightful young man. 
How we got acquainted just happened this way, 
I 
by the shop- window by chance passed one day;

TIIE CHARMING CHEESEMONGER. 
He came out all smiling, and said, " Now, miss, pray, 
Allow me to wait upon you." 
The largest of eggs he selected, 
The butter was mild as could be, 
And when in one parcel collected, 
Ile sent them home kindly for me. 
Oh, he is so obliging, etc. 
His soft winning ways acted just like a 
spell, 
For since I 
saw him, tho' why I 
can't tell, 
No other provisions I 
like half so well 
As those which I 
get at his shop ; 
He cuts me the very best bacon, 
So streaky, so mild and so lean, 
And to him a 
fancy I've taken, 
He's always so neat and so clean. 
Oh, he is so obliging, etc. 
He's always attentive when weighing the cheese, 
Whate'er he selects for me ne'er fails to please, 
And as our acquaintance increased by degrees, 
In marriage ' tis likely to end. 
Such soft loving words he does utter, 
Me by such endearing words call, 
And when he. has weighed me the butter, 
He puts it in pats nice and small. 
Oh, he is so obliging, etc. 
'Twas only last week, when I 
in there did drop, 
No one being near, he the question did pop, 
He said for himself he would take a 
large shop, 
The moment 1 
gave my consent; 
He afterwards tried mild persuasion, 
Such sweet winning terms he did. use, 
And what I 
said on that occasion 
I 
know not, but didn't refuse. 
Oh, he is so obliging, etc. 
WAIT TILL I'M A MAN. 
WAIT '
TILL I'M A MAN. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY -WILD. 
I'M but a 
little boy just now, 
Not very old you know, 
But as the rolling years go by, 
I 
guess I'm bound to grow; 
I 
hope I 
sing and swing to please, 
I 
do the best I 
can, 
But some day I'll do something more, 
just wait till I'm a 
man. 
CHORUS. 
Wait till I'm a 
man, 
Wait till I'm a 
man, 
I'll show the world what I 
can do, 
Just wait till I'm a 
man. 
Though grown-up folks look down on me 
And pat me on the head, 
Some day I'll be as tall as they 
And patronize instead. 
My father's good as fathers go, 
Sometimes a 
rataplaa 
He'll sound, when on a 
swinging rope, 
just wait Winn a 
man. 
'Wait till, etc. 
They send me to a 
lady's school, 
It is a 
shame of shames, 
And the rude boys call me Polly Ann, 
And such wicked names. 
My school- mistress says I'm a 
dunce, 
So does my sweet heart Fan, 
But never mind, I'll serve 'ern out, 
Just wait till Pm a 
man.

Wait till, etc.

COME ALONG, BOYS. 
The ladies all are good to me, 
And many a 
pretty miss 
Is kind enough to cuddle me, 
And volunteer a 
kiss ; 
Of course I 
like it very well, 
But I'll have a 
different plan, 
I'll kiss the ladies in my turn, 
Wait till I'm a 
man. 
Wait till, etc. 
Some day I'll seek a 
fortune, and 
Like Crusoe in a 
boat, 
I'll keep a 
black man Friday, 
With a 
white macaw and goat ; 
I'll dress in skins, and dig a 
cave, 
For use a 
spade I 
can, 
I'll shoot the blacks, won't it be fun? 
Wait till I'm a 
man. 
Wait till, etc. 
COME ALONG, BOYS! LETS MANX A 
NOISE. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
YOU'VE heard about the " languid swell," 
A 
fellow always quiet, 
I'm not like him, as you can tell, 
For I 
like noise and riot ; 
I 
don't believe in quietude, 
'Tis not one of my joys ; 
So, ladies pray don't think me rude, 
When I 
say I 
love a 
noise. 
CHORUS . 
Slap ! dash ! let's make a 
noise ! 
Come along, boys! let's make a 
noise ! 
Slap! dash ! let's make a 
noise, 
For I'm the noisy swell. 
COME ALONG, BOYS . 
67 
Yes, when I 
was a 
little child, 
I 
was considered " knowing," 
And all proclaim'd me " awful wild," 
Before I'd half done growing; 
To quiet me, it was no use 
To give me sweets and toys, 
So in despair they let me lose 
To indulge in every noise. 
Slap! dash! etc. 
They said, as up in years I 
grew, 
My spirit would grow milder, 
But, to confess the truth to you, 
I 
think I've grown much wilder; 
I've started a 
fast " jolly school," 
It's members are " nice boys," 
They're all like me, not one a 
fool, 
Tho' we're all at a 
noise. 
Slap! dash! etc. 
We go to op'ras, routs, and balls, 
Find lots of fun before us, 
For our delight is music halls, 
Where we join in each chorus. 
Indulging in the fragrant weed, 
Each one himself enjoys, 
The merry band I 
always lead 
When we want an extra noise. 
Slap! dash! etc. 
So come and join our motley throng, 
You'll be delighted very, 
For we're a 
school that ne'er do wrong, 
Although we're always merry; 
Tho' fond of jokes, we do no harm, 
We're merely " jolly boys," 
Who now and then cause some alarm 
When we're kicking up a 
noise. 
Slap! dash! etc.

WAS A FLY. 
WISH I WAS A FLY. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
I 
W ISH I 
was a 
fly, up in the air so free, 
A-buzzing constantly, how happy should I 
be, 
To grocers would I 
fly, and also sweet stuff shops, 
And pass a 
life of bliss amongst the lolypops; 
But in those honeyed moments, too sweet indeed to last, 
I 
might fall in a 'lasses pot, and there stick very fast. 
CHORUS. 
Still I 
wish I 
were a 
fly, up in the air so free, 
A-buzzing constantly, how happy I 
should be. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fly a-buzzing in the sun, 
In August or July, annoying every one; 
To buzz about their ears, wherever they might go, 
And settle on the noses, too, of many folks I 
know. 
But in those happy hours I 
might, oh! dreadful fate, 
Get caught by anglers, and end my life as fishing bait. 
Still I 
wish, etc. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fly, in splendid state I'd dine, 
Off game and currant pie, washed down down by sparkling 
wine; 
Some brandy neat I'd sup, and nothing have to pay, 
And being drunk as any fly, I'd try to fly away. 
Alas I 
perhaps, when thinking how very well I 
thrive, 
Some horrid penny fly-paper would catch me all alive. 
Still I 
wish, etc. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fly, about the streets I'd roam, 
In windows would 1 
pry, when old folks are from home. 
I'd learn what's going on, and everything I'd see, 
I'd give a 
little knowing wink, with none to notice me. 
Whilst laughing to myself, behind my back would steal 
Some horrid spider who would quickly make of me a 
meal. 
Still I 
wish, etc. 
MY GIRL SARAH. 
MY GIRL SARAH. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
HERE I 
am, my friends, again, 
Come to sing you another strain, 
I 
hope you will not think me vain, 
If I 
sing in praise of Sarah; 
Sarah's handsome, Sarah's kind, 
She's the girl to speak her mind, 
There's not another girl you'll find, 
To equal my girl Sarah. 
Give me the girl that likes a 
spree, 
Full of frolic, fun, and glee, 
She's the sort of girl for me, 
And just such a 
girl is Sarah. 
You've often beard of her before, 
Many, many a 
time, but lor 
Just see her now, she'll make you roar, 
Such a 
funny style has Sarah. 
There's no green in Sarah's eye, 
All the time to me she'll cry, 
" 
Keep up your courage, don't say die, 
And don't forget your Sarah." 
Give me the girl, etc. 
Sarah's dad's a 
sailor bold, 
lie's possess'd too, of lots of gold, 
And says, as he's now getting old, 
He will leave it all to Sarah. 
Oh ! then won't we do the grand, 
'Mongst the nobles in the land. 
For I 
shall be a 
Marquis, and 
They'll make a 
Duke of Sarah.

We're all nervous, at our house, at home. 
There's myself and my mother, my sister and brother, 
If left all alone, are all frightened at each other.

And our tabby cat, too, is frightened at a 
mouse. 
And we're all nervous, shake, shake, trembling, 
We're all nervous at our house, at home. 
We all at dinner shake, shake, at carving ; 
And as for snuffing, we oft snuff out the light. 
Last night every one did to snuff the candle try, 
But my wife couldn't do it, nor my sister, nor could I. 
Come, give me the snuffers, said mother with a 
flout, 
I'll show you how to do it, and she snuffed the candle out. 
For she's so nervous, etc. 
My nervous wife can't work at her needle, 
And my shaking hand spills half my cup of tea ;.

We are so nervous we're frightened at each noise ; 
We have got a
