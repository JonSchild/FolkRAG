HARRY -HILL'S OPENING ADDRESS. 
Delivered at his NEw VA.RD.TY THEATER. COI% Houston and Crosby 
Streets, N. Y., on the occasion of the unveiling of his colossal 
American Eagle, the largest carved emblem of the " Bird 
of Freedom" in the world. Height, 14 ft.; width across 
wings, 13 1-2 It.; weight, 830 lbs.; original cost, $2,300, 
on Thursday afternoon, October 14, 1880, at 3 
P. M. 
Kind friends and dear old patrons, once more we gather 
round 
The social board of friendship for another merry round. 
Bring forth the foaming tankard, fill high the flowing bowl, 
We'll drink success to our new friends, and a 
hearty health to 
the old. 
Begone, dull care I 
Fill up once morel Nor heed old Father 
Time. 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and the days of auld 
hang syne? 
Here's a 
health to every flag that floats upon the land or sea, 
And to all that they float over, whoever they may be. 
Though England is my birthplace, America's my home, 
And the land I 
love to live in, dear to me now as my own. 
I 
love her Starry Banner, emblem of her noble cause, 
With my life 1 ,would protect it, with my will enforce her 
laws. 
I 
love my dear adopted land, because I 
would be free! 
For a 
life of independence is the life that suited me. 
That's why I 
crossed old ocean, when but a 
boy in years, 
Because I 
longed for freedom, to be a " man among my 
peers." 
And I 
felt that in this country, the " accident of birth" 
Was no bar to progression to the man of honest worth. 
There were no dukes or nobles, a 
privileged race to run, 
But all were free and equal under Heaven's glorious suit. 
That's why I 
raise this eagle (shining like a 
golden ray), 
Emblem of our nation's freedom, on this, my Opening Day. 
And this brave bird of freedom is dear to me and you, . 
And he's a 
daring fighter, and always proved " true blue." 
For his rights he'll bravely battle, fighting with a 
pluck and 
vim, - - 
And ne'er showed the white feather mid the roar of battle's 
HARRY HILL'S OPENING ADDRESS. 
.(Concluded.) 
Then hurrah for " Yiinkee Doodle!" Now let the eagle 
scream! 
Three cheers for Hail Columbia! 'neath the Starry Banner's 
gleam. 
Nine cheers for " Brother Jonathan," and the land that gave 
hint birth; 
I'm a " Yankee" now by nature, though a " Johnny Bull" by 
birth. 
Here's a 
health to every nation on the face of this old earth, 
And a 
welcome, now, to all their sons, no matter where their 
birth. 
The right hand of good fellowship to all I 
now extend, 
To all my dear old patrons, and to every new-made friend. 
Eat, drink, now, and be merry! Now what more can I 
say? 
Do justice to my motto, then, on this, my Opening Day. 
Of good health and prosperity may you always have your fill, 
Is the health I'll drink to all of you, yours truly, HARRY HILL. 
A. PSYCHOMETRICAL DELINEATION OF THE CHARACTER OF 
HARRY HILL. 
In an " AcroStic," by Jtm CAMPBELL. 
"Hale fellow well met," wherever you find him, 
As true to his friends as he's fearless to foes, 
Respected by all, for the strong ties that bind him 
Round the hearts of his comrades wherever he goes. 
" 
Young as a 
boy" in the sports of life's pleasures, 
"Hale as the Oak," that no tempest can bend, 
In " physical beauty," one of nature's great treasures; 
Light-larted and merry on joys that attend,

drop curtain, painted by one of the finest 
scenic artists of New York City.

BOSTON ITARRV. 
Written, coirmised and sung hy J. IT. CoNnoit, of CrNtint.g. Corium 
Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm a 
fellow who's fond of pleasufeg 
No matter where I 
roam, 
At my hours of leisure 
I 
make myself at home; 
Oh, give to me the outside speritt 
On the fields I 
love to tarry; 
The boys around the parks call mil 
Pretty Boston Harry. 
CHORIM 
Oh, ta-ta, ta, oh, ta-fa, fa, 
Wherever I 
may go; 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Boston Harry, oh; 
Oh, ta-ta, ta, oh, ta-ta, ta, 
'Wherever I 
may lark; 
I 
always wear the best costume, 
Of any of the boys in the park.. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Josie, that's her name; 
In the summer time, 
On the lawn we play the croquet game; 
Oh, do I 
not admire it, 
My chance I 
would not miss,. 
Before my darling parts with me, 
On her lips I 
imprint a 
hiss. 
Oh, 61-ta, ta, ete, 
One evening, while out strolling, 
Just for a 
short lark; 
My pet and I 
went wandering 
Around in Central Park; 
While gazing at the fountain. 
We met a 
crazy loon, 
Who asked us to take a 
walk with him, 
To visit a 
baboon. 
Oh, ta-ta, ta, etc. 
GILHOOLEY, YOUR COAT IS HALF-MAST. 
Written and sung by JAMES o'Nm... 
You've heard of O'Brien from Hailem, 
And the man with the high-water pants, 
But to me, sure, they can't hold a 
candle, 
And for " mashing " they stand a poor chance. 
I 
wear the best clothes that's imported 
From Paris, across the blue say, 
By all the fine girls I 
am courted, 
Pm too handsome to live they all say. :7 
CHORUS: 
For the girls they all call me a 
daisy, 
And they say I 
am too sweet to last; 
They tell me to get out a 
patent, 
" 
Gilhooley, your coat is half-mast." .) 
One night, sure, I 
went to a 
raffle, 
Dressed up in my best Sunday clothes, 
When I 
entered they all commenced laughing 
Get on to that face, " Holy Mose." 
They say that my coat was a " Seymour," 
And that I 
was living too fast; 
They said that I 
looked like a 
mummy, 
A well-preserved thing of the past. 
For the girls, etc. 
You will find me at balls and at parties, 
I 
lead every march and the dance, 
Sure I 
can play croquet and billiards, 
I 
beat Sexton and Vignaux in France. 
I 
own my own yachts and fast horses, 
I 
am neither too slow nor too fast, 
:But whenever I 
pass they aii hailOo 
" 
your coat is half-mast." 
SPoKEN.—Now I 
like fun as yell as the next inan 
but when a 
fellow collies up and sticks a 
circus bill 
on my back, and takes me for a brick fence, it's 
going too far. As I 
was singing to myself, in the park, 
looking at the animals, says a 
fellow to me, " Say, 
lend us your mouth till I 
tight the crocodile?" 
I 
went in a 
saloon to get a 
glass of lager, and the froth 
of the beer was on me mouth when the gang outside 
halloos " Hydrophobia! look out for the terrier." 
For the girls, etc._ 
a 
GEN. GRANT'S TRIP AROUND THE WORLD. 
As sung by JAMES O'NEtt., with great success. 
I 
am an Irishman, and do the best I 
can, 
For to elevate the Irish, one and all; 
I 
own a 
large estate, and my influence is great, 
I 
am the boss of all free lunch at Tammany Hall. 
When I 
go out in the street, they tell me go and eat, 
And advise me to go awl have my whiskers curled; 
But I 
turned around and said, cheese it, don't you 
give it away, 
I 
am General Grant, I'm touring around the world. 
CHORUS: 
AVitli a 
cigar stuck up in my teeth. 
And a 
mustard plaster stuck on my feet, 
I 
am the darling, I 
am the daisy of them all; 
They give me a dig in the ribs--
And they say, get on to Iris nibs, 
There's Patsey Grant, that's been around the world. 
I've been to Portuguese, I've been to Turkey and 
Greece, 
That is the greasest place I 
ever saw; 
I've been to Spain and France, and a 
Dutchman stole 
my pants, 
And I 
hit him with a 
brick-bat on the jaw. 
In lreland I 
got froze, in Russia I 
lost may nose, 
In Italy I 
got drunk and singed an earl; 
From Cork I 
did escape, for my clothes were out of 
shape, 
For l'm Patsey Grant, that's been around the 
world. 
With a 
cigar, etc. 
I 
struck Chicago shore, and went into a 
liquor store, 
And got away with an elegant five cent buss; 
They gave me a 
big reception, and took up a 
big col-
And gave me a 
pair of Dan O'Leary's shoes. 
I spoke for twenty-four hours, and drank three 
hundred whiskey sours, 
To the Palmer House in a 
carriage I 
was whirled; 
They rushed in at the doors, and they riped away the 
floor, 
To see the bloke that tramped around the world. 
With a 
cigar, etc.

SULLIVAN '6 BOOT. 
Sung by JAMES 
Bure, I've just come away from the doctor's, 
Some pills and some doses we had; 
I've had leeches placed over my peepers, 
And the pain of them near drove me mad; 
It was only last night, at the wedding, 
That I 
was invited, of course, 
Through a 
row I 
got full of ba.,1 whisky, 
And one or two teeth I 
have lost. 
CHORUS: 
I 
was sated snug up in the corner, 
With Sullivan's wife on my knee; 
raith, I 
knew her before she was married, 
And together we had many a 
spree; 
I 
tickled her, just out of friendship, 
She winked at me back, on the sly, 
Soon I 
found myself under the table, 
With Sullivan's boot in my eye. 
After dinner, they poured out the whisky, 
The drink which poor Paddy enjoys; 
Myself and poor Biddy got frisky, 
We started the girls and the boys. 
We danced away like the divil, 
Till Sullivan rushed in at the door, 
With a 
welt he knocked me in the corner, 
And pulled Biddy out on the floor. 
I 
was sated, eta.

Oh, beautiful Major Gilfeather! 
The ladies remark with a 
sigh; 
Oh, gracious! oh, my! did you ever 
Observe such a 
beautiful eye? 
The choicest of choice conversation, 
I 
give to the ladies, oh, dear! 
In hotel, in parlor, in station, 
Oh, this is the language I 
hear: 
Cnonus. 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather? 
I'm a 
little bit under the weather! 
It's smilingly, then I'd endeavor 
To borrow a 
five, do you see? 
Oh, take it, and keep it forever, 
My friendship for you 'cannot sever, 
For you are so royally clever! 
Oh, meaning the Major, that's met 
To dinners I'm often invited, 
It's out of my style to decline; 
With rapture and joy I'm delighted, 
And often pre.strated with wine; 
The ladies they say l'm bewitching, 
In fact, l'm a 
meal Belvidere! 
In ball-room, in parlor, or kitchen, 
Oh, this is the language I 
hear; 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather, ete. 
The tailors and barbers all know me, 
They're envious of my great success, 
They say, come and pay what you owe me, 
I 
give them my name and address; 
I 
leave them to mingle with fashion, 
Their voices grate hard on my ear; 
When hungry and needing a 
ration, 
Oh, this is the language I 
hear: 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather, eta.

THE LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Music published, and Copyright, PZ9, by J. Cuenca & Co. Words 
by W M. CARLETON. 
Music by J. K. EMMET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the thamrock so greerd. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there. 
And liked the soil so well, 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
011! the shamrock, etck 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh the shamrock, eta.

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS. 
written by JAMES CAMPBELL, and delivered by O'NEIL and Comtoz, 
with shouts of laughter and applause. 
Mrs. Maloney had a 
cat, and a 
female cat was she, 
her voice it was a 
soprano, and she sung in the key 
of G. 
Oh, it was my delight, of a 
starry night, when coin-
ing home from a 
ball, 
To hear her singing " We met by chance," on the 
top of Maloney's wall. 
I 
know she went up as high as " G," and sometimes 
I 
think she went higher, 
And the way she dwelt on the very last note, you'd 
think she was hollering fire! 
I 
really think she could say the word fire! but still 
1'11 not swear to that, 
For I 
wouldn't like to make a 
liar of Mrs. Maloney's 
cat. 
Now, old Mrs. McFadden, she had a 
Tom, (a cat I 
mean by that name), 
And she called Mrs. Maloney's cat, in the other 
yard, a 
most disrespectful name. 
Maloney's cat cried out " You're another!" then Mc-
Fadden's loudly did bawl, 
"You sucker, send out your big brother, or come 
yourself over the wall. 
I'll wrestle you, collar and elbow, I'll throw you 
as quick as a 
rat!" 
" 
Arrah, don't be getting your back up!" says Mrs. 
Maloney's cat. 
Now, Jerry McGill had a 
bull dog, and Jerly, he lived 
in the rear, 
And the bull dog was lean, lank, and hungry, and 
divil a 
cat did he fear; 
Now, Jerry, he called his dog " Boney," says he 
" 
Now, 1'11 bet a 
new hat, 
if I 
leave off his chain and his muzzle, he'll make 
sausage-meat out of them cats." 
One night, (it was dark and dreary, and the divil 
star in the sky), 
Boney had off his chain and his muzzle, and he laid 
for the cats on the sly.

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS . —CONTINUED. 
Now, the cats, they met in the hallway, and they 
wrestled clean out to the yard, 
The first hold was " collar and elbow," and their 
breathing was terrible hard; 
Then they both tried " Greco Roman," but you 
couldn't tell who got first fall, 
And Boney wag acting as referee in the shade of 
the garden wall. 
They howled, and they spit, and they fluttered, and 
the blood from their noses ran, 
Says Boney " I'll take a 
new hoult, I'll wrestle them 
catch, catch, can." 
Then, like lightning he sprang in amongst them, 
In his jaws he had one by the back, 
Such a 
yell was ne'er heard in that quarter, 
As came from Maloney's poor eat. 
McFadden's cat fought like a 
tiger, 
But Boney's strength didn't him fail 
With a 
twist of his jaws, like a 
general 
He bit off McFadden's cat's tail. 
Oh, the howling, and yelling, and growling of the 
dog and the cats filled the air, 
And the windows all round in the barracks flew open 
every where. 
Heads with night-caps of old men and old women and 
children, poked out in the dark, 
Theythought that the house was on fire, or the divil 
was out on a 
lark; 
They tried to look out in the darkness where the 
noise came from down by the wall, 
And thinking some one was being murdered, they 
loud for the police did bawl. 
Then they came out in droves and Iii dozens, 
The children, old women and men, 
With candles, with lamps, and with matche3, 
But ah! what a 
sight met them then— 
McFadden, and Mrs. Maloney, 
They sorrowfully shook their night-caps, 
To see McGill's bull dog, old Bcney, 
Holding a 
wake over the two defunct cats. 
IS 
THE TIPPERARY' CHRISTENING. 
Sung by JAMES O'Neil. with great success, at Tony Pastor's. , 
It was down in that place, Tipperary, 
Where they're so airy, and so contrary, 
Where they kick up the devil's figarie, 
When they christened the beautiful boy. 
In comes the piper, sot thinking, 
And a-winking, and a-blinking, 
And a 
noggin of punch he was drinking, 
And wishing the parents great joy. 
-When home from the church they came, 
Father Tom and old Mikey Branagan, 
And scores of as pretty boys and girls, 
As ever you'd wish for to see; 
When in through the door, 
Hogan, the tinker, Lather and Lanagan, 
Kicked up a 
row, and wanted to know 
1
.V;sr they wasn't asked to the spree. 
Then the boy set up such a-bawling, 
And such a-squalling, and caterwauling, 
Oh, that was the day of great joy. 
Then the piper set up such a-moaning, 
And such a-droning, and such a-croning, 
In the corner his comether was turning, 
When they christened sweet Dennis, the boy.  
The aristocracy came to to the Party, 
There was McCarty, light and hearty, 
With Florence Beidelia Fogarty, 
Who said that was French for a 
name; 
Dionysius Alphonso Mulrooney, 
Oh, so spooney, and so looney, 
With the charming Evangeline Mooney, 
Of society she was the cream.

THE TIPPERARY CHRISTENING. 
(Concluded.) 
Cornelius Horatio Flaherty, 
Sir AdolphuS Grace, and Dr. O'Rafferty, 
Eva McLaughlin and Cora Muldoon, 
And Brigadier-tkaieral Burke; 
They were dancing the polka-mazurka, 
'Twits a 
worker, not a 
shirker, 
And a 
voice of Vienna, la Turker, 
And the polka-redowa divine; 
After dancing, they went in to lunching, 
Oh, such lunching, and such crunching, 
They were busy as bees at a 
lunching, 
With their coffee, tea, whisky, and wine. 
They had all kinds of tea, they had Shooshong, 
They had :Ningnook, and Drinkdook, 
With Oolong, and Boolong, and Toolong, 
• And teas that were made in Japan; 
They had sweetmeats, imported from Java,. 
And from Youver, and from Mouver, 
In the four-masted steamer, Mar-navel-, 
That sails from beyond Hindostan. 
Cold ice:cream, and cream that was hot, 
Romeo punch, snowball and sparrowgrass,. 
Patty D. Foy, whatever that means, 
Made out of goose-liver and grease; 
Red-headed duck, salmon and peas, 
Bandy-legged frogs, proranon ostriches, 
Bottled noix, woodcock and snipe, 
And everything that would please. 
After dinner, of course, there was speaking, 
And hand-shaking, and leave-taking, 
In the corners, old mothers match-making, 
And other such innocent sins; 
Then they bid a 
good-by to each other, 
To each mother, and each brother; 
When the last rose, I 
thought I 
would motile% 
When they wished the next would be twins

Don- t

Yes, I'm a

What of it? 
Folks say we ain't

But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't'

Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash 
and clothes, 
That was afom I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, arid a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie--Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen, 
Beaux? Why she had a dozen—had 'em from near 
and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, fione of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she dAn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young 
gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say,

soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away 
More than a month after we heard from the pod

He'd gone away and left her without a

Fill'd with a

THE HUNGRY BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written by JAyES McAvoy for O'NEIL 8.: CONROY, Vocalists 
Comedians and Sketch Artists. 
In a 
Broadway store, across the street, 
Where all the hungry boarders eat, 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To make short work of their soup and hash, 
At nine o'clock they slip out of bed, 
And fly down stairs to be fed; 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat— 
Pass no remarks about the meat— 
Just keep mum and close your mouth, 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
The cooks they sleep on the second floor, 
With a 
padlock hitched on every door, 
So the hungry boarders can't get in. 
Where was Moses when they doused the glisnf 
- 
They make them sleep up in the attic, 
And all night long they raise a 
racket; 
They gave the chambermaid the run, 
And chased her out with a 
Gaffing gun. 
Nobody knows, etc. 
A 
week ago a 
boarder skipped, 
Faith, out of the window he fired his grip; 
He lowered his trunk down with a 
rope, 
And then for a 
freight train he did slope; 
Next morning when they called the roll, 
The landlord blessed his darling soul; 
His daughter, she squealed out, ' Oh laws! 
He' k 
given us the finger for three weeks board." 
NobQdy knows, etc.

TALMAGE'S VISIT TO ENGLAND. 
Written by JIM CAMPBELL. and sung by FAT= Itusa. 
Ara.—" I'm going down to Washington. to fight for .Abrahanste 
Daughter." 
Come, all you sinners, great and small, and listen to 
my ditty, 
I'll sing to you of " Brother Talmage" leaving this 
great city. 
[Symphony.] 
He went across the briny sea to convert those Eng-
lish sinners, 
To eat plum pudding and fat roast beef at Johnny 
Buffs big dinners. 
Oh, I 
went down to see him off, the day that he went 
sailing, 
He looked like the captain of a clamsoup-boat, a-
going out a- whaling. 
[Symphony.] 
Says he " Good-bye, now, Jim, old boy, don't drink 
too much cold water, 
I'll show the ' Dark Side of New York,' to Johnny 
Bull for a ' corker.' " 
He spouted like a big sperm whale to the sailors, 
while crossing the ocean, 
And when he arrived in London town he set it in 
commotion. 
[Symphony.] 
When he opened his mouth and began to yell with 
a " forty horse-power" praying, 
He drowned the noise of the big church-bell, and the 
donkeys all stopped braying. 
(Concluded.) 
Oh, he twisted his legs around his neck, and he yelled 
like a 
wild hyena, 
Says he " the country's full of sin, and, you bet, I'm 
bound to clean her." 
[Symphony. ] 
He rolled up his eyes like a 
dying calf, screwed his 
mout h 
up like a 
button, 
And he says, "You bet, I 
ain't no slouch though I 
eat green peas and mutton." 
He stood in the pulpit on his head, throw'd a 
flip-
flap over the organ, 
And he played-a 
tune with his two big toes would 
astonish " Johnny Morgan ;" 
[Symphony.] 
He roared like a lion broke loose from his cage, at 
the sinners there before him, 
And he done a " break-neck " song and dance, and 
the deacons all encored him. 
Oh, when he comes back to New York town, to see 
him we'll be " b'ilin'," 
We'll take him a trip in a 
Government ship way 
down to Coney Island. 
[Symphony.] 
We'll let him preach to the clams on the beach, and 
met the fish in motion, 
And we'll take him up in the " big balloon," and 
drop him into the ocean.

But the cuckoo's song is so sad and still.

There is a 
great sensation, about a 
word you hear 
nowadays, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's about going to the 
Matinees; 
.
1 
You can hear them say to each other, when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the 
mat this aft?" 
Cnottus. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aft?" "Not this aft, 
some other aff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aft?" " Not, this aff;" 
" 
Then good-aft." 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aft?" " Not this aft, 
some other aft," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aft?" " Not this aft;" 
Then good-aff." 
By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broad-
way, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at 
me and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going 
to the mat this aft'?" 
"Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things 
out to day; 
She'll say, " Don't waist your breath talking, we've 
heard the best and last— 
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the 
mat this aft?'" 
Are you going to the mat, etc.

MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOTTREY THORN. 
Sung with great success by TONY PAsTon. 
The music of this song is Published by E. H. HARDING.Z.V Bowser 
New York. Price 10 cents, 
I 
moon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Inc. costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
80me heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shove— 
Cnoaus. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your mat 
She little thought when you came out you d 
ro so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! forshame, Yahl yah1 yah1 Ohl yahl 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the ran, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call 
a bob. 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun. 
TOT Polly said her pretty ayes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, et• 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least be frfa, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We eat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
• chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shoutad this— 
Oh, very well, eta 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
Ify Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
for when we parted at her door, or rather lust inside, 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and hr 
little brother cried— 
litroasx.—Oh 1 
oh I

Oh, very well, eta,

Or the little bird up in a

But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Arc trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants.

And to pay a

And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants.

We hired a

Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance

When we went out a-sleighing." 
Said Mary Ann, my girl, to me, 
" 
Dear Pat, let's have a 
little spree; 
Let's take a 
trip on the briny sea, 
Way down to Coney Island." 
With a 
couple of ten's the bills to pay, 
We started out the very next day, 
And took the steamer down the bay, 
Laughing and singing all the way. 
She wanted to see the big balloon 
And eat ice cream front silver spoons, 
And be waited on by stylish coons, 
Way down at Coney Island.

Colors flying, bright and gay, 
I 
tell you, we spent a 
jolly day, 
When we went to Coney Island. 
As soon as we landed on shore, you know 
Why up to Cable's we did go, 
And the way she ordered wasn't slow, 
Not much for Coney Island. 
Now, first she ordered oysters, fried, 
Ice cream, and charlottes, then she tried, 
Then clams, both roasted, raw and fried, 
With lager down her throat did slide, 
With lobster-salad she then did fill, 
And a 
couple of bottles of wine did swill, 
Then says, " Dear Fat, now pay the bill," 
Way down at Coney Island.

We gazed out on " the murmuring 
And then she murmured thus to me, 
" 
Come, Birdie, fly away with me," 
Then flapped her arms like wings, you see. 
And then she hove a

And wiped a 
teardrop from her eye, 
And squeezed my hand all on the sly, 
That day at Coney island.

A-coming back 'twas rather tough, 
The sea was rolling awful rough,

At first she ho ve a

And then the clams and cream did fly, 
I 
got a

And then my girl began to cry,

THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR. 
Written by JOHN W ALSH, and sung at HARIti IfILL's Theater. 
What curious people we weet 
As thr,ilIgh thy worm we 
go , 
Some are full of deceit, 
While others honesty show; 
Some on mischief are bent, 
If you far from it will roam, 
And others like to interfere 
With business that's not their own. 
Some will swear that. white is black, 
And green is un color at all; 
And others seem to take delight 
Iii watching another Mall fall; 
But when inquisitive people 
Wish to limo. anything from me; 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. 
CHORUS.

Where the stormy winds do blow; 
And as the sailor has been to sea,

A comic:II sketch of his bed, 
And his forty wives also; 
With sixty babes in the front, 
His breeches you'll see hanging there; 
Now there's a 
chance for young girls, 
Who would like the breeches to wear. 
Just fancy having forty wives, 
To please and amuse every one; 
They tell me Brigham did it,

And says that Smikes should be compelled 
To keep a

It causes a

THE MILL WILL NEVER GRIND. 
As sung by Jorrcmr GIBBONS. 
I 
dreamt last night of home and friends and when I 
was a 
boy, 
I 
saw the dear old scenes as in the days of yore; 
I 
heard my mother's voice in its absent soft and mild, 
bt sounded sweeter than it did before. 
I 
walked with father by the mill, as often I 
had done, 
We watched the wheel that turned so very fast; 
He laid his hand upon my breast and softly said: 
" 
My son, 
The mill \ 
Oil never grind with the water that has 
past." 
CHORUS. 
The dear old scenes I 
can't forget wherever I 
may go, 
Within my memory seem to last; 
And as I 
wander on through life, a something whis-
pers low, 
The mill will 'Lever grind with the water that has 
past. 
My parents dead, and I 
grew up to lead a reckless 
life. 
Not careing what I 
done or where I 
went; 
I 
grew to be a 
drunkard, avoid of c-are or strife, 
And on the road to ruin I 
was bent. 
My money spent, I 
sat mae dOWII to think o'er what 
I'd done, 
The tears ran down my cheeks so thick and fast; 
And as I 
sat I 
thought I 
heard my father say: • My 
son, 
The mill will never grind with t1).,3 water that lial.

GIBBONS, the Premier Motft 
Vocalist and Character Artist. 
I 
will sing you a song of the -world and its ways, 
And the many strange people we meet; 
From the rich millionaire with his thousands , 
wealth, 
To the struggling wretch on the street. 
A man may be poor, in tatters and rags, 
We know that we out not surmise, 
But think of the adage, remember, kind friends, 
That six feet of earth make all men of one size. 
There is the rich millionaire with plenty to spare, 
But with conceit he holds up his head; 
And thinks he is above the mechanic who toils 
And is honestly earning his bread, 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take away 
To the world up above when he dies; 
For death levels all and conclusively shows 
That six feet of earth make all men of one size. 
If ever you meet a 
poor fellow who tries 
To bath) this world and its frown, 
Just lend him a 
hand, perhaps he'll succeed, 
Don't crush him because he is down. 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given 
Is remembered with joy in the sky; 
We all are but human, we all have to die,

As 
sung by Miss LULU MORTIMItIt., 
MANKIND drift along through this broad sea of Ceeru, 
With some ' tis foul weather, with others ' tis lair, 
Some help one another to reach the bright shore, 
While others sit silent desparing the more. 
I've a 
few words to say if you'll list to my song, 
Your attention I 
ask, I 
will not keep you long, 
My subject for song is a 
new one I'm sure, 
For 
sing about men that were true to the coma: 
Let me first sing of one whom all Ireland love, 
AVIto gave up his life his devotion to prove , 
He died for his country, he cared not for fame, 
And each sons of Erin rejoice at his name ; 
I 
mean not the brave Dan O'Connell of old, 
I 
mean not the brave Dan O'Connall the bolc.'; 
Nor Ireland's sweet poet, the warm-hearted Itl.x,re, 
But brave Robert Emmett was true to thz core. 
And now let me sing of America's friend, 
Who gave up his life for liberty's end; 
Hand in hand with our Washington, noble hero, 
He fought ' neath cur banner, the red, white and blue ; 
From his own sunny France, from his kindred and hutnt 
Across the broad ocean he feared not to roam, 
Let the battle field, echo the old days of yore, 
flat dear Lafayette he was true to the core. 
Another name dear to us all hear tonight, 
Who loved his own comrades, who tried to do right; 
When the fierce storms of war was overwhelming orr laad. 
To his country he offered his heart and his band ; 
Though some misconstrue him and others complain, 
They never can tarnish his honor or fame, 
Yet the red battle fields on Virginia's shore, 
Prove that Abraham Lincoln was true to the c''. 
Let me sing now of one whom the whole world aetoras„ 
Whose name is revealed upon all foreign shores; 
America's hero, Columbia's star, 
A statesman in peace, but a 
lion in war, 
From the red battle- fields of Lundy's Lane, 
From Princeton, from Germantown arises again, 
The echo of voices to sing evermore, 
That Washington always was true to the core.

Recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. at TONY 
success. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the li%elong day, 
llow the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away. 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered ; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast-
The iill*rill never grind with the water that is past 
Take the °lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true ; 
Golden :ears are fleeting by ; youth is passing, too ; 
Learn to make the most of life lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away ; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last-
The mill will never grind with the water that is put. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and. will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams, upon the way, 
All that though canst call thine own lies in thy— to-day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by ; 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without 
sigh': 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single. word 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, unhearr' 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
on! love thy God and le ttow-man, thyself consider last ; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past ; 
Awl when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And :Heaven in all its glory shines, ' midst the pure, the good, 
the true— 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and ':-ftst— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is 1241.:1..

YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND TO ME.

bark of life was tossing down the triublcd 
stream of time, 
When first I saw your smiling face, when 1
,,mth 
was in its prime; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my soerwld 
heart was free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been 
a 
friend to me. 
Chorus. 
I'll ne'er forget where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be, 
If ever I 
had a 
friend, 
You've been a 
friend to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly 
loved me, too. 
I 
would lmve had a 
broken heart, had it not been 
for you; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but 
glad I 
could not be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend 
to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled 
the 019nds of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary 
path of life; 
I 
now look back upon the past, along life's stornq

I 
smile to think 'mid all life's scenes, you've beei

As originally sung by GRIFF BOWDEN% 
GIVE me the spade and the man who can use it; 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have ; 
If there's more than YOU want you can give to your 
neighbor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and brave. 
Give me the spade, etc. 
Give me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the sword that won our best battles, 
Created our commerce, extended our trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the spade, boys, the 
spade. 
Give me the...spade, etc. 
Give me the spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without it., 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were 
yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid, 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then hurrah for our true friend, the spade, boys, the 
spade. 
Give me the spade, etc.

DON'T CALL IN THE MORNING. 
Written, composed and sung by E. C. Dernma. 
music published by E. H. HARDING, M Bowery, New York. 
Twas at an evening party where I 
first met Milly Green, 
And thought she was the sweetest girl that I 
had ever seen; 
sougbt an introduction which I 
happily did obtain, 
And in nearly all the dances 1 
her little hand did gain. 
And when the time for breaking up the party did arrive, 
To see this little damsel home somehow I 
did contrive; 
But ere we parted at the door I 
boldly asked if I 
Might call and see her sometime when she gave me this reply. 
CHORTJa. 
Don't come in the morning, for that will be too soon, 
And never call to sea inc in the afternoon; 
Don't come in the evening and never call at night, 
But call at any other time and then you'll be all right. 
So strange an answer really I 
could not make out at all, 
Unless it was a 
gentle hint tiia I 
must never call; 
And yet I 
did not think she could treat me so unkind, 
For somehow she to favor me appeared to be inclined. 
So once again I 
asked her, but the answer was the same: 
And at that very moment to the door the Fel' va lit came. 
Good-night, she said and vanished, did this darling little dear. 
And kept me standing with an answer ringing in my ear: 
Don't come in the morning, etc. 
I 
strolled along and wandered what the dickens could she mean 
As all night long 
dreamt about that darling little queen ; 
Bur more her answer came to me, which seemed to be absurd: 
But in the morning when I 
woke a 
happy thought occurred. 
She said if I 
would call at any time I 
should be all right, 
Except the morning, afternoon, the evening or at night; 
Any time that I 
could call was neither late nor soon; 
Of course you all have guessed by now she never more will 
say: 
Don't come in the morning, etc.

Each animal and bird can hear the voice of love, 
From the roaring lion to the turtle dove,

One day I 
met a 
lady in the Central Park, 
She said that she was fond of birds, and liked a 
lark, 
So I 
sat myself beside her 'neath the rustling trees, 
And took her little hand in mine and gave it a 
squeeze. 
How d'ye do, eta 
Says she I 
think my appetite is very good, 
A 
pleasant meal I'd relish, sir, indeed I 
should; 
I'm good at ordering suppers, and I'll save your pelf, 
So if you do not mind, Ell order it myself.

The way she ate I 
thought that she herself \mild hurt, 
The soup, the fish, the entrees, joints and the dessert; 
She truly said that appetite's a 
splendid sauce, 
And she ordered in a 
different wine with every course 
Curacoa, wst, wst! She could lower, wst, wst! 
She started on the wine list, with a

She ordered everything with such El, charming grace,

OH, MIDI TEL J THEM TO STOP.' 
As sung by Coot BURGESS. 
No doubt you Lave heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl there 
To pass a 
dub hour away. 
We went in you must know azkd saw Barnum's Great 
Show, 
Van Amburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were roaadabouts, swings and all kind oi 
things, 
Forget the da) I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, when we got to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I 
said: 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; buil 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
*tit: . 
CHOWCIS. 
Oh, Fredi tell them to stop t 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said stop the swing: 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
'Twas then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Frod1 eta. 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
SPOKEN.—Mark

I DON'T LIKE A OUR AT BIT HEELS. 
Words and Music by FRED. BOULARD. 
Music sent postpaid on receipt of to cents, by the Poptelre 
Publishing Co., 32 Beekman Street, New York. 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
I 
like honest pluck in this warfare- of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet '
tis better to know you're prepar'd for the vtorst 
Than tremble like children with tear. 
CHORUS. 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Nard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
Aud destroy every venomous part ; 
Vet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
man etc. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself. 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A pod open field for the race, 
And 
you have cause of complaint ' gainst man, 
Gs 'ell him right straight to his face. 
I 
do like a

THE NEVER EMPTY CRADLE—TWINS IS BORN. 
(Concluded.) 
Hang the blessed cradle, nearly every night, 
Just as I 
get into my first snore; 
Twinses with the quinses wake me in a 
fright. 
Keep me up till half-past three or four. 
Mother sleeps in comfort, says she knows that dad, 
Sees her little chicks don't come to hurt. 
But, poor me! the father, I 
get cold and mad, 
In my cradle costume— that's a 
shirt. 
Crionus. 
Never empty cradle, baby's in galore, 
Bachelors against it I 
would warn 
If you wed your angel you'll find it a 
bore, 
When you rock the cradle in the morn. 
Who would be a 
father when he knows the price, 
Sees how soon the punishment begins? 
Half a 
dozen times I've been a 
father twice— 
Half a 
dozen pair of healthptwins. 
All my pieces spent and all my peace is gone, 
All my friends now look on me with scorn, 
Say there is no reason in such goings on, 
Worn out is the cradle—twins are born. 
CHORrs. 
Twins are in the cradle, both are in a 
roar, 
Aroarer early morning to adorn, 
They make pretty angels, . never sure before 
Were such little cusse ever born. 
$ 
THE NEVER EMPTY CRADLE—TWINS IS BORN. 
Sung with enthusiastre applause nightly by the ever popular 
HAPPY CAL W 
AGNER. 
Never empty cradle, though you're in my care, 
With your precious burden to be fed; 
You're a 
precious nuisance and you make me swear, 
Keeping me out of my snow-white bed. 
With her pimpled cheeks and Scare!' Gampey eyes 
Nursey pursey came one v.-intcr 11101.11; 
Goading me to madness with the " sweet surprise ;" 
Crowded was the cradle— twins were born. 
CHORUS. 
1.1wins are in the cradle, making twenty-four, 
Sons and daughters making me forlorn, 
ill go to the " angel" and have two penn'orth more 
Crowded is the cradle—twins are born. 
In her shady bed-room nurse is always found 
All night long the fat old humbug sleeps, 
9r she's round the corner standing glasse's round, 
Drinking till she girl and water weeps; 
While the little twins:es squalling more and more, 
Swell until they burst their little bed; 
And one little angel wallops on the floor, 
Tumbles from the cradle on lils head. 
Twins are in the cradle making twenty-four, 
In my side they are a 
dreadful thorn, 
They don't sing of angels, I 
am blessed sure, 
Crowded Is the cradle—twins are born.

A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS. 
Sung by DAN NASH. 
As we pass along life, how many we see, 
And many there are to be found 
Who are never contented where'er they may be, 
And so constantly come to the ground. 
They always are changing for this and for that, 
Though for reasons they're quite at a 
loss. 
It brings to our mind the saying so pat, 
A 
rolling stone gathers no moss. 
CHORUS. 
So always stick firmly to what you've in view, 
Don't be dazzled by glitter and gloss, 
Remember the maxim, so old yet so true, 
A 
rolling stone gathers no moss. 
Some people there are, they go hi for trade, 
And scarcely stay at it a 
week, 
For they quickly will say a 
mistake they have made, 
And for something quite different seek. 
Awl then, when at last, they make a 
fresh start, 
It's just the same thing as before, 
A year hardly goes, they again fro.,11 it part, 
So these people they live and die poor. 
So with lo've, a 
young man falls into its snare, 
And tries to obtain a 
young wife, 
But of constancy true he does not take care, 
So single remain all his life. 
Alany ladies we know the same pathway will trace, 
How seldom we find one that's staid, 
She's quickly attracted by every fresh face, 
She lives and she dies an old maid. 
Now there is a something to learn from my son& 
And for all there's a 
little advice. 
You must all persevere if you want to make way 
On the troublesome highway of life. 
Keep pu!Thing on firmly, though slow it may be, 
And on this you may safely depend, 
Though trials may arise you soon will be free, 
And success will be yours in the end.
