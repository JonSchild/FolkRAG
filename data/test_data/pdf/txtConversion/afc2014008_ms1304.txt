August 19, 1987
 
Dear John
 and Caroline If this can reach her -
-
I was so happy to hear from John, not to mention rohn Kneubold and Dotsie.
 
And now it has taken me months and months not only to bat the ball bat
.1'
but
 
even to focus on the fact that i
t has arrived on my side of the net.  Well,
 
so it goes -
-
 a panel meeting here and. a national council meeting there,
 
a dab of bronchitis and a touch of out-of-town company and a two week Smith-
sonian Folklife Festival on the Mall, and what do you know? âtFiere goes the
 
ball game and the summer.  My Lord, i
t's been hot around here.  My late
 
husband once remarked that getting off a plane in Washington in July was like
 
walking into a bowl of luke warm cream-i-tomato soup.  I
t's thick, that's
 
what i
t is.  You don t exactly walk down the street, you kind of s
lice your
 
way
' through the warm wet air, and when you finally get indoors, you turn up
 
the air conditioner so high your poor old lungs can't think of anything better
 
to do than let their year-long assembly of microbes and viruses l
oose.  Every-
body, F know has been sick this summer.
 
Well, enough griping.  F expect i
t gets a mi
warm in Samoa too, but I keep
 
remembering a stirring of the a
,ir that made i
t so much nicer.  Perhaps that
 
was because F came in
 winter, or was i
t the summertime when I was there?
 
It rained a lot anyway
'  and whatever i
t did, F seemed to like i
t.
 
F a
m sending along a
 few things.  F always send things; I think i
t's the grand-
mother in me or something.  The badly printed xerox from the U.S. g
id Claims
 
Court is part of an nno mois document presented me by a very nice fellow who
 
i
s on
. the Polk
. Arts
' panel r,
,Richard f
fart -
-
 who has been bull-dogging this
 
case for the Zuni tribe for close to twenty years.  They finally won i
t! -
-
nd even
, more than winning i
t, they got a s
tatement written into the record
 
by
' the federal judge that Zuni' legend and mythology [
telling about their FZwkis1
 
prehistoric migrati-ansT have what the court called "evidentiary probity" in
 
settling land claIms.  This may be a first for folklore, I don't know, but
 
I thought you and the Samoan folks would like to know about i
t.  I just copied
 
off a particular bit, but p wcould,get more if you want.
 
Then. Fm enct
hosing a copy
' of a paper I wrote about childrens playground games.
 
You may
' have seen it already
', but it appeared in a rather obscure book of
 
collected essays edited by a couple of education types, and hardly anybody
 
e
lse has,  F
t s got a couple of things in it that you might find useful.  I
 
loved thinking about you two reading your papers to each other on your beautiful
 
deserted island.  Gosh, how
' romantic,,,
 
I keep wondering If F really
' could do anything about Samoan childrens stuff.
 
There axe several things that keep coming back to me.  One is Brownie Tu l
l",
 
telling me firmly' that there were no XRII secular Samoan songs left, only
 
hymns (
which
. I
' di
'dn t believe then and don't believe now).  Another was listening
 
to the expert singing F heard in the rooting section at the girls cricket match
 
we watched for a
, few-minutes one afternoon
 seemingly totally spontaneous,
 
casually
' and beautifully, performed.  Another is thinking about the extraordinary
 
group
 :
symchrony, F heard in the music and saw in the dancing -
-
 a refine-
Jent of inter-personal seris f
tIvity' that is higher than anything I have seen here
 
On the mainland and just has to have been built into the handling 1k and the
 
learned beli yior of Snoaii
 
an
.
.ts
' rtgltt up through early childhood.
 (
When
 
the new edition
. combs out, F$11 send you '
a copy of Step I
t Down in which my
 
co-author, a B
lack lady nam ed Bessie Jones, describes some of this process
 
in the socialization of the rural Black child in the USA.)
 
The last thing F keep coming back to is that the Samoan poet-in-schools
 
program had the children writing poems in English; we began talking in a
 
couple of classes about how i
t would be to write poems in Samoan and what
 
you could say better in Samoan and what you could say better in English,
 
but I would stake anything r have handy on the fact that Samoan children have
 
already written poetry of distinction, probably in the form of standard game
 
rhymes and local chants.
 [
By' the way, the Arts Review has just come out with
 
the two Samoan poems.  F hope you like the way they were handled.)
 
Maybe, F think to myself, when my confidence is high and the world i
s my
 
oyster ,
 I could help bring to pass a hi-lingual or flat-out Samoan mono-lingual
 
publication of Samoan chuldrens' poetry with e
legant i
llustrations and all
 
manner of high-tech top-banana- fluff-stuff s that would help the Samoan
 
bi lingual educational program.  One thing F have really learned during the
 
past few years is h
m,w nseless i
t is to try to get people to learn to read in their
 
own
, language unless there I
s, something more interesting to read when they finally
 
learn how, than dtctionÃ£zties
- or translations of the Bible.
 
Bumping back to earth, on the other hand, it's quite c
,lear that doing any of the
 
things I should like to do would require at least some asic familiarity with
 
the Samoan language s And although I
'm totally willing to try to learn i
t, i
t's
 
equally clear that F find difficulty these days in calling up on demand the name
 
of the person I
'm talking to -
-
 in English yeti  There is a heck of a lot I
 
remember, but often not just when I want to.  F would have to find a Samoan
 
speaker who would be interested in collaborating on this slightly off-base
 
project. .or projects...
 
Anyway, I love  thinking about it and rolling i
t about in my mind.  And alongside
 
my day-dreaming F keep remiering what a great time r had last spring with some of
 
the great people on your great I
sland,  Give them and i
t and you and anything
 
that stands still for treatment my everlasting regards.

 Co
 to  school meant great sact i
f ic e s
 
for me: living several hundreds of miles away from home from age twelvc,
 
with years between visits; working many hours each day on the school
 
farm and in the kitchens to pay for my tuition; and studying at night
 
by the light of a small hurricane lamp.
 I found life in a Crittsh
 
parochial school, with its severe discipline, continual Christian in
 
doctrination, and disregard for Melanesian cultures to be very difficult.
 
On the other hand,  the  student population was cross-cultural and
 
multilingual (
there are 80 different languages in the Soiotrons), and  It
 
fed my desire for greater exposure to the outside world.

raveling and in-depth interviewing gave me a broad knowledge of local
 
needs and ideas throughout the country, and spurred my interest in decol-
oping culturally relevant, educational programming aimed at rural areas.
 
At the same time, I found that I had achieved national popu1
.ar ty:  ren-
agers liked my pop music programs, expatriates my classical
, music  pro-
grams, and older SoiDmon Islanders my cultural programs.  This popularity
 
formed the base for a political movement in my home district of Kwara'aa,
 
which for over the past five years has put pressure on me to run for
 
Parliament.
 I am not tempted to run for public office because I do t
oot
 
f
eet that po'i i
t ics is my calling.  But I feel that my popularity with
 
ioral people indicates that the programming I designed did fit their needs,

and this has given me confidence in the course
 
am i

ug.
 
As part of training towards promotion,  I was sent to the East-i sr

Honolulu)  in 1
974 for training in ethnomusicology, even

I was not interested in that topic.

 But through associating with scho]ar, and profess hun! s f

un
 
many different countries, I became recommitted to Outatning a university
 
education, feeling the need for a broader base of knowledge to do r
eâ¢
 
t
nirch in my own society on development issues and culture.
 
When I returned to the Solomons in August 1975, I found myself pr,)-
to an administrative level poslr t
on that prevented me fro- a p pl y in g
 
the new ideas I had gained at the

l
y experience with Solomons Radio is reflected in the following ap-
praisal of the work that I and the rest of the staff did.  I find more
 
to criticize than to praise.
 First, in regard to training, important

 P
er  xaaplo, such
 
programs rarely included the kind of explanatory background needed by
 
r
ural villagers to understand what was being presented.  Often the quality
 
of announcing was poor, also reflecting the need for more professional
 
training.

Secondly, staffing, including s

created many problems for us.
 There was a strong hierarchical gap between

merit, and promotion decisions were  ode by expatriatts, expatriate salaries
 
greatly exceeded local salaries, and expatriates were given special con-
siderations that locals did not receive (
such as superior housing,  indi-
vidual offices, and studio visiting rights for family and friends) .
 This
 
gap in power and rights created frustration among the local staff and led
 
some to become disinterested in improving their work.  Related to this
 
was the lank of control of programming and other projects by the more
 
creative, responsible profess t

family or small village in a rural area could do to improve its garden
 
productivity, stop ridge erosion, protect its water supply from pollution,
 
or start a small fishpond.
 Ironically, when unscheduled national  govern-
ment messages from one official to another had to be broadcast, programs
 
on local issues or of local music would be humped rather than, say, a
 
pop music show.  Finally, there was a lack of in-depth political analy-
sis in our programming;  this was especially needed by rural people who
 
were unfamiliar with Western-style democracy and remote freT.  thr  (enter
 
of political power.
 
Fourth, the  s
ty! ,?
  of pro oritat i
on i
n hro ucecis often  r
eflected tho
 
elitism of t
le  otaff.
 :or example, Pijin broadcasts aimed at rural areas
 
were often 3;rinklecl with cooplicated English terms and phrases that th
 
uneducated could not decode, but which were intended to show off the
 
announcer's status as an educated person.
 Similarly, the style of f
le
5
 
reading was copied from the BBC and ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission)
 
stYle, rather than being adapted to local speaking modes.
 In particular,
 
the announcer's rapid pace was poorly adapted to slower l
.
oc:ii speech-
making style and the variable broadcast reception in r
emote areas.
 
Fifth, not enough time was devoted by staff to research, perhaps
 
because the administration did not encourage it.  Most of the staff did
 
not want to trav l  i
nto r
ural  :
1r c o ,  on research and reporting missions
 
because they saw rural areas as p
r I
o
iitive (
even though all of t

staff came from a village background themselves) .

 Yet one
 
of the great national facts is that a gap is developing between the

Currently my favorite author is the English novelist Jane Austen,
 
and my  favorite book is Sense and Sensibility --although this may change
 
as _

Selected Programs
  
The following is a list of programs for which I was
 
responsible on a daily basis both in production and
 
collection of material,  as a Senior Announcer and Producer.
 
It is a selective rather than exhaustive list.
 
-
 News and Views from Malaita Province
  
A 15-minute
 program on events such as the opening
 
of a new school or an important feast to commemorate
 
a significant cultural occasion.
 The stories were
 
sent to me by individuals in the Province  (e.g.  school
 
teachers or Provincial Assembly officials);  or I
 
might interview Provincial officials,  leaders,  or
 
businessmen;  or when I made field trips,  material
 
and recordings were collected for this program.
 The
 
interviews and narration were usually conducted in
 
Solomon Islands Pijin.
 
-
 News and Views from the Central Province
  
This program,  with the same format as above,  covered
 
Guadalcanal,  the Florida Islands,  the Russell Is-
lands,  Rennell Island,  and Bellona Island.
 
-
 Women's Magazine
  
Similar in format and content to the above two pro-
grams,  this program reported on the concerns and
 
goals of women's organizations throughout the islands.
 
Narration and interviews were conducted in Pijin,  and
 
interspersed with short pieces of music from local
 
string bands.
 
-
 The program idea and design were mine.
 
-
 Calling Youths
  
The aim of this program was to bring the sociological,
 
educational,  religious,  and cultural concerns of youth
 
to the attention of government,  church,  and traditional
 
leaders.
 A 15-minute weekly news broadcast about the
 
kinds of projects youth throughout the island were
 
involved in,  and their needs.
 
-
 Calling Small Ships
  
A major means of communication in the Solomons is by
 
boat.
 This program recognized the indispensability
 
of boats by providing an avenue through which sailors
 
could express their feelings about their career and
 
life experiences at sea.
 Sailors also used it as a
 
rapid means of communicating with their relatives and
 
friends living in the villages.
 The interviews were
 
Gegeo
 5
 
conducted in Pijin,  and interspersed with music
 
chosen by the interviewee.
 
-
 The program idea and design were mine.
 
-
 World of the Pacific
  
Usually narrated in Pijin and sometimes in English,
 
this program brought Solomon Islanders news and
 
stories from the Pacific region,  from Malaysia to
 
New Zealand.
 The program emphasized development
 
in the Third World part of the Pacific,  and drew on
 
the resources of PEACESAT in Honolulu,  the Australian
 
Broadcasting Commission, the New Zealand Broadcasting
 
Corporation,  The Fiji Times, the Papua New Guinea
  
Post Courier, and our correspondents at the Asian
 
Broadcasting Union office in Kuala Lumpur.
 
-
 Questions and Answers
 
A one-hour program in w
h ich questions sent to SIBS
 
by listeners were answered by myself and a co-host.
 
Subjects ranged from inclusion of traditional chiefs
 
in the Solomons National Parliament to the American
 
Watergate scandal.
 
-
 Round the Town
  
Similar to the two "news and views" programs  (above),
 
this program focused on news and events in the capi-
tal city Honiara,  for the benefit of people living
 
out in the villages.
 Topics ranged from such cul-
tural
 matters as an interview with a tourist buying
 
artifacts from a carver to political events and issues.
 
-
 Hospital Requests
  
A weekly hour-long program comprised of music and
 
interviews.
 Hospital patients were interviewed about
 
their condition,  and allowed to convey short messages
 
to their relatives at home,  as well as request a
 
favorite record to be played.
 
-
 Review of the Week
  
A 15-minute program featuring the news highlights of
 
the week,  for the benefit of listeners who may have
 
missed their first broadcast.
 
-
 Solomon Islands Custom Music
 
A one-hour weekly program whose aim was to help pre-
vent the disappearance of local traditional musics.
 
Locally recorded songs and music were played, with
 
narration about their meaning and background,  and the
 
musical instruments involved.
 The program was seen
 
as an attempt to educate young Solomon Islanders about
 
the significance of traditional music.
 
Gegeo
 6
 
-
 Folk Music from Other Lands
  
One of our foremost goals on SIBS was to meet the
 
listening needs of our racially and ethnically di-
verse listeners in the Islands.
 This program helped
 
to meet this goal,  as well as to encourage Islanders
 
to recognize their own traditional musics as valuable
 
and as part of a world tradition of folk music.
 
-
 Songs of Praise
 
The great majority of Solomon Islanders are members
 
of a Christian church.
 This program played recorded
 
hymns sung by different choirs from all over the
 
Islands,  sung either in English or in a local dialect.
 
The source of the music and the dialect involved was
 
announced in Pijin.
 
-
 World of Classics
  
This program of Western classical music catered to
 
a more educated,  usually older,  and largely Western
 
audience,  and explanations of the music were made in
 
English.
 Two-hour weekly broadcast.
 
-
 Sunday Mid-day Record Requests
 
Listeners deluged every Announcer with requests for
 
songs to be played for special occasions or to
 
express feelings for friends and relatives.
 This
 
program was set aside for such requests,  and was
 
broadcast in Pijin or English.
 
-
 Selections from the Operas
 
A commercial-free half hour of music from operas.
 
As most listeners were Europeans,  explanations about
 
the selections played and announcements were given
 
in English.
 
-
 The program idea and design were by a colleague and
 
myself.
 
-
 Country and Western Music
  
Newly released Country and Western music albums from
 
the United States,  Australia,  and England were fea-
tured, with narration in English or Pijin.
 
-
 Top of the Pops
 
Recently released hit songs were featured on this
 
program,  sent by the British Broadcasting Corporation
 
Transcription Services in London.
 I alternated
 
announcing t
h e program in English  and Pijin.
 
-
 What's On
  
Broadcast weekly on Fridays at 6:30 p. m.,  this program
 
informed Honiara residents on the activities taking
 
Gegeo
 7
 
place over the weekend,  suuh  as dances and games.
 
-
 David and the Local Artists
 
This special program was broadcast once a year on
 
Christmas Eve.
 I interviewed the Solomon Islands'
 
most talented and sought-after singers and guitarists
 
on a wide range of topics,  from how they got
 
started in music to what they planned to do in the
 
future.
 Each interview was preceded by a piece of
 
music from the artist's work.
 Sometimes live and
 
sometimes recorded.
 The intent was to inspire
 
and encourage prospective young Solomon Islands
 
artists.
 
-
 The program idea and design were mine.

ur August 19th letter arrived just as classes had begun
 
am ,  and I set it aside to respond to as soon as I could
 
nd the proper pocket of time.  This is the first such
 
oper pocket--more than a month later!  It's been a busy
 
riod.  First of all,  I always have to adjust to being back
 
work;  until I get used to the pace again the start up of
 
teaching always exhausts me.  And,  of course,  other things
 
don't slack off  just because I'm back at work.  Your standard
 
variety of autumn deadlines to meet--grants and proposals
 
and protests,  submissions and a reading to give.  Also in
 
there were two trips to Western Samoa to arrange and then
 
complete the adoption of an infant girl  (two months old last
 
Thursday)
 
I had activated again my search for a baby to adopt.  When
 
the word came through from a friend in t
Jpolu of a baby girl
 
available,  I wavered,  knowing that if I was going to raise a
 
child primarily on my own I preferred a boy.  Then my mother-
in-law insisted she wanted the girl,  and a sort of
 
Polynesian deal was cut, whereby she would officially adopt
 
the child and we would share the duties and joys of raising
 
her.  She is a beautiful,  thus far quiet and docile forest
 
child;  one hundred percent Samoan,  from one of the more
 
removed villages.  My mother-in-law gave her the traditional
 
family name Barbara  (Palepa in Samoan)  and I gave her the
 
name Frsaga  (pronounced Fee-sa a,  a gentle refreashing
 
breeze).  She is being cared foI  in Mom's house now, where
 
there are plenty of babysitters.  I
'll have trouble getting
 
her away to stay with me for the next few months.  (My
 
father-in-law died a little over a year ago;  FTsaga has
 
already brought a glorious change to Mom's life.)  I antici-
pate that over the years,  as they both grow older,  I'll be
 
having her with me more and more  (ending up fifteen or so
 
years from now,  when Mom will be nudging 80, with just what
 
I wanted to avoid--a teenage girl on my hands).  (I hope this
 
doesn't sound sexist.  I
've had experience helping to raise
 
other peoples'  children,  and I just seem to do better with
 
boys than with girls.)  The search for my boy continues.
 
And,  of course,  there was the decision about the FAC
 
position.  In a way it was easy;  in other ways it was
 
difficult.  It was easy in that I am eager to do it,  dying
 
to.  It was difficult in that all such changes of position
 
for a 'palagi here are rife with complexities and
 
uncertainties,  and I was comfortable at the College.
 
Probably too comfortable.  I don't know yet what you think
 
about  it.  Believe me,  T
'll do the best  job that can
 e done.
 
Thanks for your  last set of enclosures.  I sent a copy of the
 
Zuni decision  (along with a copy of your letter)  off to
 
Caroline, who shared it with her Hawaiian land rights
 
activist friends up there.  I enjoyed your article about
 
children's playground games,  which I had not seen before.
 
I think you should definitely follow through on your  idea
 
about coming here and doing something with Samoan children's
 
stuff.  Early childhood sociability training--and performance
 
--is such a given here,  no one thinks twice about it.  All
 
children are encouraged and expected to perform chorically
 
(whereas individual virtuosity is discouraged).  Thinking of
 
you,  I stopped the other morning in Leone on my way to work
 
to watch a preschool class  (all inidentical,  crisp,  clean
 
white shirt and blue lavalava uniforms)  perform their
 
alphabet--in chorus--as the woman teacher beat the time with
 
a stick on the mat.  Reedy thin young voices confidently
 
finding their harmonic slots.
 
I know nothing about their playground games and verses.  John
 
Kneubuhl,  though,  remembered nonsense rhymes from his youth
 
and wondered about them when I asked.  As you know better
 
than anyone,  these things are devalued by almost everyone
 
who has passed beyond them to  'higher'  folk material.  I find
 
the same thing true of animal stories in Polynesia.  I
'll bet
 
there's a gold mine there.
 
Finding you a proper Samoan-speaking cohort is no problem.  I
 
already have two good possibilities in mind,  both women
 
perfect for the game.  The bi-lingual educational situation
 
here is in its all too perennial funk of confusion.  It's not
 
your powers of linguistic memory that are needed,  but your
 
field-trained ear and decades of experience.  You and your
 
work would be  je wels  to us.
 
I hope I haven't overpiLched  it.
 
About four hours ago we had an absolute ragged shocker of a
 
ten-second earthquake--somewhere in the Richter 6s is my
 
guess,  probably epicentered out in the Tonga Trench.  Right
 
now an intense squall is passing through,  one of those
 
deafening ones,  during which--if anyone else was here--it
 
would be impossible to be heard.  The tympani of the tin roof
 
and the  jungle lashing.  The rainy/hot/hurricane season has
 
begun  (also the season when I can watch from my veranda the
 
mpback whales pass).
 
This is the most infuriating and
 
ard nq place T've ever been,  but  know you're always more

This term appears in Pratt's lexicon, defined as "one kind of song,
 
sung by three or four persons" (
P4).

and no text of such a genre has been found.
 Except for the information
 
about performing-forces, and the alphabetical position of the word, one
 
might speculate that the term gati is a misprint for tagi--or even fati,
 
"melody."

The nominal use of the term lape is known only from the present cen-

 Pratt records the use
 
nly
 "to sit and wish bad luck to the opposite

 It is pos-
the use of the word as a noun ; for cricket long

(
On the other hand, whether cricket was popular before representatives of
 
the British Empire took political control over Samoa has not been ascer-
tained.)
 Several texts called l

Songs performed to accompany juggling-games are classed together by
 
contemporary SÃ¤moans under the heading paio.  This term ordinarily means
 
"puzzle, riddle" (M.palo).
 Moyle fails to cite the term, but does note
 
the practice of singing while juggling

In general,  this is a good description of the palo ; however, not all
 
verses in palo-texts rhyme, and lines are not necessarily equal in
 
length.
 The texts are performed by the juggler herself, with heavy
 
accentuation of stressed moras, which usually total two or four to a
 
line.
 
Many of the contemporary ralo contain numerical references, as in
 
the following example.
 
Fern stands in the woods
 
My collection's one.
 
Fern stands in the woods
 
My collection's two.
 
Fern stands in the woods
 
My collection's three.
 
And so on, to ten.
 Another such text exhibits this pattern : "Sandcrab-.
 
leg, honeyeater-leg:/  My collection's one," and so on, as in the text
 
above.
 Other texts do not maintain a count
 they are almost always
 
gibberish, when analyzed literally;  and they make as little sense in
 
Samoan as in English
 
The cockle, the mollusc,
 
Hold a council of white parties.
 
Smallish, shortish,

Those rows will be pierced.
 
Mollusc, curs tacean,
 
Which shows us the war-party.
 
It will be stormy.
 
Give your face to burst.
 
Cock your leg up.
 
One amateur, who heard recordings of several such texts (at MoyM.9a-9c),
 
observes : "Three girl's [
sic] juggling chants, performed by an adult
 
woman, appear to be more like '
speech'  than '
song'" (
ZemR.476).
 He fails
 
to indicate the criteria by which he makes this distinction.
 
The palo are analogous to rhymes sung in Tonga to accompany the same
 
kind of activity, as E
. E
. V. Collocott notes
 
A favorite game of Tongan girls (
hiko), consists in
 
juggling oranges.
 The girls become remarkably expert, and it
 
is no uncommon thing to see five or six oranges kept in the
 
air.
 The players sit in a little ring, and as one breaks
 
down she passes the oranges to her neighbor.
 The games are
 
scored by means of these rhymes, and doubtless others, which
 
are almost as unintelligible to the Tongan as the e
eny 3 deeny,
 
diny, do of English children is to them.
 Interesting words,
 
however, are preserved  [
ColTa.100].
 
As in the case of songs used to accompany other children's games, these
 
examples show a wide variety in wording, when texts of different children

Material well suited for the study of Samoan musical change comes
 
from the sports and amusements of the young.
 Much Samoan play was--and
 
is--accompanied by song.
 Descriptions of thirty games were published more
 
than fifty years ago, by P
. E
. Heider, a missionary (HeiPSk).
 These
 
s are listed in figure IX-4, which also makes an inventory of the
 
ociated with them.
 (Heider cites one song twice,  in the accounts
 
16 and 22.)
 Of the songs, eleven survive in the repertories of
 
of the present day ; eight have become extinct,  in the sense that
 
not ordinarily performed by young persons. 6 The surviving items
 
by large numbers of people, but are conceived in various forms,
 
d mainly at the time of mental formulation.
 
re IX-5 gives a selection of songs drawn primarily from the sur-
es ; it consists of ten songs in Heider's collection, plus five
 
own to have been in existence before the twentieth century.
 For
 
another sample, consisting of songs that have become extinct, is
 
also available. 7 From the vicissitudes undergone by these pieces, rates
 
of change can be discovered, by procedures that permit two kinds of com-
parison
 study of the variability of change within samples, and study of
 
the variability of change between them.
 
The easiest way to measure the change in the sampled songs might be
 
to tabulate the phonetic units in their earliest and latest forms, and to
 
compute a rate from the difference.
 For example, when the generation of
 
1875 sang "Tolotolo uga," the text of the song had 62 moras ; the last
 
known version,  sung by the generations of 1957 through 1966, had 49.
 The
 
difference is 1
3 moras ; the span is 91 years.
 The total number of moras
 
was reduced by 0
.14 per year, which amounts to a loss of 14 moras (
or 23%)
 
6Versions of the extinct items were obtained in the years 1971 to 1974,
 
but only from adults ; no children who knew the songs were encountered.
 
71t is first listed in figure IX-11.
 In it, two of the songs (
3 and
 
1
1) are given in Heider's accounts ; another (
12)  is not found in his
 
i
ccount of game 7
, although oldtimers interviewed in the 1970's said it
 
had been a feature of that game.
 Of the remainder, three (5, 9
, and 1
3)
 
are printed at SieS-XVII.188 (
13 is also printed at K-II.319) ; the rest
 
are well attested to, by persons who remember a childhood before the twen-
tieth century.

Dear John Enright,
 
I write in a neurotic panic, thinking that surely my new-found friends in Samoa
 
will never be able to understand how it has taken me six weeks to write and
 
thank them for their courtesy and kindness.
 I will not bore you with the day-
to-day matters I have dealt with since I saw you last -
-
 including not only a
 
visit to Guam (
unexpectedly interesting) and Saipan (
a bit sadder) and back
 
home, a Folk Arts panel meeting (
three incredibly complicated days) and then
 
having to give testimony before a House of Representatives committee charged
 
with keeping an eye on the NEA  -
 a lesson in how difficult it is to keep the
 
democratic process fresh, shining and clear no matter h o w  decent and hard-uorhing
 
everyone tries to be.
 
I am writing Tile about t
i
ie application for a Samoan folk arts coordinator
 
which just arrived and will enclose a copy of my letter for your information.
 
I think the application is in excellent shape except for some standard
 
confusions about where to put which budget item and a future plan which I
've
 
written Tile about.  I
've also talked with Roinalvn and Bernie about their
 
visit; they report they had a wonderful time and t
i at
 t
ley esnecially 00 0ye'l
 
visiting with you and John Kneubuhi.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the technology assessment (what a marvellous mystical
 
bureaucratic phrase!) booklet.  Bear in mind that it represents just the f
irst
 
swipe taken at the problem a long time back; there is a later attempt that
 
focusses on the Pacific but it's not publicly available as yet.  I just enclose
 
this so that you can see how it's done, or at least one way it's done.  I
'm
 
also enclosing a copy of my daughter and son-in-law's book about their year's
 
field effort in Nepal.  This is just for your and Caroline's personal en1ov e'.
 
I thought there might have been a chance your paths might  avc crossed ;L
 
Berkeley, and in any event it's, as they say, a good read
 
I did get to visit a bit with Caroline in Hawaii; unfortunately for me it  as
 
t
he day after the all night flight from Samoa and I was terribly soggy-brained.
 
T
he and Don Rubenstein took me out to a nice lunch and Ikept nodding off and
 
inding up with my chin in the kung pao chicken; I hope we will meet again
 
ome day when I
'm a bit livelier.

Dear Tile,
 
The lovely presents the Chairman and I received in Samoa continue to come in,
 
each box rekindling memories of the wonderful visit we had to your beautiful
 
island.  In my turn I am enclosing a book I promised -
-
 a catalogue of
 
Pennsylvania quilts, beautifully illustrated, I think -
-
 and full of some of
 
the old designs that I expect must have reached Samoa with the missionaries.
 
I don't know if quilts are exactly your personal thing, but I was very impressed
 
with the Samoan quilts I saw.  They are absolutely gorgeous and quite distinctive
:
 
and I think somebody could do at least a beautiful photographic project stressing
 
the especial characteristic aesthetic they show.  In the meantime, I hope this
 
book proves to be a nice addition to your Arts Council library and that you will
 
accept it with my compliments.
 
On to other business, now.  I was personally very p
leased to receive t
he appli-
cation for a folk arts coordinator position for Samoa.  The application itself
 
seems well thought out and appropriately written up.  Our grants officer, Rose
 
Morgan, has gone in with her calculator and refigured the budget; I enclose a
 
xerox of the changes she has made for your interest and information. * She tells
 
me that she will need a breakdown of the "salaries, wages and fringe" in kind l
ine,
 
detailing which staff, how much salary and how much fringe.  She also figured
 
the total project cost to be $49,916 which leaves your match only rartinl, but
 
that is allowable in the case of Samoa, as you know.
 
There is one thing though I think you should add to t
his arplication, and t
hat
 
is an outline of a plan as to how you will try to get the position funded out
 
of your own budget eventually.  As you know, Polk Arts funds the salaries for
 
these positions for three years only, sometimes under special circumstances
 
extending our funding to a fourth year but never (
so far) after that.  We will.
 
I hasten to remind you, continue forever to fund projects that the Coordinator
 
might want to do -
-
 it's just the salary we will not support beyond the 3-4
 
-ear limit.  I think if you and your Council could draw up and agree to a plan
 
hat would year by year assume a bit more of the position support, you would
 
ot only put a stronger case before the Folk Arts panel but you would begin
 
allying your own local energies.  Bear in mind that, i
f push comes to shove,

might be able to develop Samoan-based funding for the position.  You don't

Dear Bess,
 
Received your  lerrer  ruddy and stopped J
Jy Jonn and Uocsie'
 
to drop off your letters to them.  It is so good to hear fro.
 
you that I feel bad about not having dropped you a line
 
before this,  even though your original missive and gifts
 
never reached me.
 (One thought there is that if the book.
 
and letters ended up traveling any way other than first
 
class they would be coming surface---slow boat--mail, whic
 
can take an unconsciousably long time.  I'll be working aL
 
the Arts Council and the college tomorrow and I will do o
 
quiet search to see if your earlier mailings were mislaio.
 
In any event,  hold off sending seconds until I am sure t
r e
 
firsts have disappeared.)
 
You sound suitably busy.  Until about a I
 1iL
 
school ended,  I was on a similar fast track here.  Jonn and
 
got our local writers group,  Le Si'uleo o Samoa (The Echo
 
of Samoa),  started up and off to a running start;  I tou
 
Polynesian Folklore class on a very successful five-da l 
fieldtrip to Savai'i, Western Samoa.; and I completed a
 
partial draft of a longish article on "Birds in Polyne.  -  
Oral Narratuve"  to present to our Samoan/Pacific Studi:
 
faculty seminar  (plus teaching my usual five cours
 
trying to steer my various committees in seemimgly
 
appropriate directions).
 
On our graduation day Caroliri
 
eturned from Honolulu on a five-week break from her worc e
 
'
ast West Center,  and we have spent the past two weeks
 
ntimately debriefing each other and catching up on regic
 
j
ossip.  She was very pleased with your meeting in Honolu L
 
md didn't seem to notice your chin slipping into the ku

Dear Bess -
-
 I just came across a letter from you in response to a Dec. 30th
 
one from me.  Has it been that long?  Probably.  This was not one of my bette
 
years.  NO big disaster, I hasten to say, perhaps just tramsition to 67,
 
boredom with too much, absence of needed moneys, harrassment from inner
 
furies that we could do so badly in this country given our resources and
 
potentiality.
 There are a few old lefties up here who seem endlessly
 
hopeful and childishly certain .
... but I am not along them, I fear.
 I
 
continue to do my bit -
-
 fighting to keep Pilgrim nuclear plant closed,
 
protesting our heinous Central American role, etc .
... but there is a foot-
dragging quality to my labors along those lines despite my falsely cheery
 
approach.
 
China was fascinating -
-
 and exhausting
 I hope that your Hawaii jaunt
 
with Corey and Mike was fun, restorative, and a delight.
 I hope, too,
 
that somehow one day we can take a trip.
 I have quit my Council on Aging
 
job (
too many ugly doings up at Town Hall resulting in an awful atmosphere
 
and too much association with nothing but bad news)  -
-
 and so I will be
 
freer.  Not richer, unless I can beef up the B&B in October-November -
-
but sufficiently so I hope to loll on a Caribbean island and float indolently
 
about in those beautiful waters.
 If you are still interested, let me
 
know .
... January through April were killer mo Ã§bs, up here this year and I
 
fully intend to be away as much as possible .
f1
f year.
 
Have been reading JEWEL IN THE CROWN and for reasons I
'll not bore you (
or
 
me) with, I was again struck by the Indian system -
-
 or perhaps more by the
 
attitude, approach.
 I refer to the old (not terribly old) father deciding
 
that he has done his duty -
-
 he has worked, married, helped raise a large
 
family and now it is his turn.  He ignores their protests, divides his
 
estate among them, sees to the care of his wife, dons his loincloth and
 
sets fo Atindvearn goody points for the hereaft er . The last part doesn't
 
eaactly appeal, but I do admire the mtnd set of having done one's duty and
 
being done with it now.  Ah well
  
I hope you are well.
 
turn the job over to
 
you'll let me know.
 
in Mexico with Dodo,
 
that you can outlast That Man In The White House and
 
someone desirable .
... and then what?  Perhaps one day,
 
Ev is again in Europe.  Vicky just back from two weeks
 
though her soap opera continues.
 
Last glance at your letter.
 I think I dr't like English islands, but since
 
I have only been to Cuba, what do I know ( Your choice!
 If
