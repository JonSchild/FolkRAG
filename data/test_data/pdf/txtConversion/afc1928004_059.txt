SONGSTER. 
The Flying Trapeze. 
Once I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Lett in this wide world to fret and to mourn. 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens. 
The ( rill that I 
loved, she was handsome 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please ; 
Bat I 
could not please her one gnat ter so well 
Like the man upon the Trapeze. 
C1101MS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A 
darinir young man on the flying Trapeze : 
His movements were graceful: all girls he could 
please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was: Signor Bona Slang; 
Till, bicr and handsome, as well as Clump.; - 
Wiiere'er he appeared the hall loudly rang, 
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below ; 
And, one night he smiled on my love. 
She winked back at him, and she shouted : Bravo ! 
As he hung by his nose up above. 
He'd fly, &c. 
St. James and St, Giles. 
One of the gifted Douglas Jerrold's best works.

Berry's Flying Trapeze 
Her father and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride : 
Her father he sighed and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail : she went there, every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her: how he ratline 
down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. 
He'd fly, &c. 
One night, I, as usual, went to her dear home, 
Found there her mother and father alone ; 
I 
asked for my love; and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away! 
She'd packed up her box and eloped, in the night, 
With him, with the greatest of ease: 
From two stories high, he had lowered her down, 
To the ground, on his flying Trapeze! 
He'd fly, &c. 
Some mouths after this, I 
went to a 
Hall, 
Was greatly surprised to see on the wall, 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him ! 
He taught her gymnastics, and dressed her in 
tights: 
To help him to live at his ease. 
And made her assume a 
masculine name! 
And now she goes on the Trapeze 
She floats through the air with the greatest of 
ease, 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying Trapeze. 
She does all the work, while he takes his ease, 
And that's what's become of my love!

When This Old Hat Was New. 
Before this hat was made, 
King George was on his throne, 
Our fathers all were rebels then, 
And fought for Washington. 
The Tories cheered for old King George 
The Revolution through, 
And bragged about their loyalty 
Ere this old hat was new. 
'When this old hat was new, 
The sons of that base crowd 
Revived the cry of" Loyalty," 
And bellowed it aloud; 
The Government our fathers made 
For them would never do, 
And they have torn its bulwarks down 
Since this old hat was new. 
When this old hat was new, 
There was no public debt, 
No greenbacks took the place of gold; 
No millionaire had yet 
His pile in seven-thirties spent, 
On which no tax was due ; 
But each man fairly paid his tax 
When this old hat was new. 
When this old hat was new, 
This land was in its prime ; 
Miscegenation was untaught, 
In all this happy clime. 
And white folks then were thought 
Good as Sambo,Cuff, or Sue, 
But things have sadly changed about 
Since this old hat was new. 
When this old bat was new, 
The poor white man was free, 
Duval Denounced; Or, the Haunted Mansion. 
Fi. ,.ree, fiery, startling incidents form the ground- work of this book.

And every year a 
bran new boy 
Could dandle on his knee. 
Dr now, for every eild he has, 
He is taxed till all is blue ; 
But things I 
tell you were not so 
When this old hat was new. 
When this old hat was new, 
G.)1.1 dollars did abound, 
And not a 
stamp in all the land, 
Could anywhere be found. 
But now yon dare not kiss your wife 
Unless yon stamp her, too 
But thne-s I 
tell you were not so 
When this old hat was new.

The other day I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time 
away. 
And chatted gaily down the street, but 'ere I 
went 
away 
I 
kindly asked this heavy swell to take a 
parting 
drain. 
Oh: yes he said. 
I 
think, I 
will, then let it be 
champagne. 
SPOKEN.—The idea of a 
man used to drinking 
five cent drinks, to call for Champagne. Says I 
my 
dear fellow, no you don't. You don't get champagne 
out of Joseph. 
Oh! dear, no, &c. 
Some time ago a 
friend of mine he asked me out to 
dine, 
And there introduced me to one be called divine; 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had lots 
of tin 
A widow only fifty-two, my boy go in and win 
SPOKEN — The idea. Would'nt I 
look nice going 
up Broadway a 
fifty-two year old on my arm. 
Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
fifry-two. 
Well the money's well enough. 
But 
the widow's not for Joe. 
Not for Jo, & c, 
And now perhaps I've sung my song, you might be 
in the cue 
To show your kind acknowledgements, but that 
with me won't do. 
As for to-
night, I've done my best, and that you 
ought to know, 
So if von want a

Sweet Isabella.

I 
love sweet Isabella: 
She loves another fellow, 
I 
often used to tell her, 
And stamp my umbrella, 
If with another I 
caught how, 
I'd from this world transport her, 
Her life should be much shortar, 
Than the sun on a 
rainy day. 
I 
longed for her my wife to be, 
Through going to Paris it wasn't to he: 
For when she sat on a 
Frenchman's knee, 
It wasn't the cheese for me. Oh! no!

Then with my umbrella,

And knocked him down the cellar, 
Because she loved this fellow, 
And she would not belong to me. 
By Marcus's Paris excursion, 
To spend a 
week diversion, 
I 
now make the assertion, 
I 
took Miss Isabella. 
She wanted no persuasion ; 
But got up for the occasion, 
We took/ourselves from London-Bridge, 
The Exhibition to see: 
Scarce had we arrived in France, 
Things went wrong, I 
saw at a

And didn't care " that" for me.

til he sold his dog. 
But that dog day has not yet 
arrived. 
When I 
last saw him I 
handed nim a 
paper on which the amount had been written. 
When he exclaimed : " That's a 
pretty B.11 Berry. 
It aint worth a Straw Berry, and a 
Black Berry. 
for I 
tell you I 
aint no Goose Berry.

the Elder Berry, would never Cram'd Berry, such

CONUNDRUMS . 
Why are young ladies on the point of joining in 
the holy bands of Wedlock the smartest travelers 
in the world ? 
Answer. The day before marriage they are in 
the Cape of Good Hope. 
The day of marriage 
they are in the United States. 
The day after mar. 
riage they are in the holy Lands. 
And the night 
after they are in the Moon. 
Why is a 
man happy that has the Itch ? 
Because he knows the pleasure of having a 
good 
Scratch. 
Why is a man happy that fears thunder and 
lightning. 
R-Tanse he keeps dear of prize 
fights and 
Political meetings.

It would set you all on fire.

She had a 
nose, a 
reddish nose, 
It turned up like a 
fish hook point, 
And every time she'd blow or sneeze, 
She'd throw it out of joint. 
She was, &c. 
She was so fond of skating, 
I 
took her on the ice, 
Says I, my love, my turtle dove, 
oh, is't this ere nice. 
She gave a 
grunt, but what she said, 
I 
could not make it out, 
For every word came from her mouth, 
Froze into sour krout. 
In loving her so madly, 
I 
came to grief and woe, 
The more I 
tried to charm her heart, 
The more it was no go— 
I 
made all kind of love to her, 
But her heart I 
could not touch, 
She'd only blow her reddish nose, 
She was so thundering Dutch. 
She was, &e. 
Now every thing was lovely, 
And the happy time drew near, 
When I 
was going to marry with, 
Sweet Catherine dear. 
I 
tried to teach her English, 
I 
tried it very much, 
But she got disgusted, and then • 
She busted, and died in a 
fit of Dutch. 
She was, &c. 
But now I 
am a 
Dutchman,

But Of Course it is No Business Of Mine. 
Some people says, I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it 
In getting the latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so 
And no harm there is I 
opine, 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close 
For of course its no bustness of mine. 
Now for instance at Mrs. Montgomery's, 
Every afternoon just about three, 
When her husband is out at his business 
A 
gent with mustache comes to tea. 
He stays till half-past eight o'clock, 
For her husband is not home till nine. 
Now I 
want to know what he does, 
But of course its no business of mine. 
At number two lives Miss Baxter, 
A 
tine handsome dashing young girl, 
Who for the last twelve months or so, 
Has been flirting with Mr. Fitzfurl.

may say I 
think it is time, 
If she is not married she ought to be, 
But of course its no business of mine.

And of course whenever she saw me, 
She stopp'd and began a 
long talk, 
About her dear little nephew, 
Who she said was between eight and nine, 
Now I 
want to know what he does there, 
But of course its no business of mine. 
At Mrs. Goty.,aigns's, round the corner 
Last evening I 
heard such a 
din, 
And found that she'd not paid her rent, 
So the brokers, they'd quickly put in. 
I 
don't know what she does with her money. 
Tho' her nose always redly does shine, 
I 
think she spends it on brandy, 
But of course its no business of mine. 
A 
friend of mine yesterday told me, 
Last Sunday he'd had such a 
lark, 
He met Mrs.—well never mind who— 
Taking a 
walk in the Park. 
He offer'd the lady his arm, 
And took her to Richmond to dine 
I 
wont tell you when they came back, 
For of course its no business of mine. 
Its time I 
now thought of retiring, 
And hope I've not kept you too long, 
The only thing that I 
now wish is, 
That I've pleased one and all with my song. 
If I 
haven't, of course I 
can't help it, 
I'll do better perhaps some other time. 
If I 
don't my advice to you is— 
But of course its no business of mine. 
Encore Verse. 
I 
don't know I'm sure what you wish for, 
I'm almost at a 
loss for to tell 
But just give some people an inch, 
And their certain to wish for an ell. 
I 
really think I've done enough, 
For you know that this makes the fifth time, 
If I 
could help it you'd only get three, 
But of course its no business of mine,

But she took the shine out of them all, 
Upon her heel and toe.

Oh how she would prance, 
Through the fairy dance, 
How lovely she did look : 
Her heel and toe aside step, so, 
She danced in the Black Crook.

Her hair is dark, her eyes are black, 
Her hands are small and white, 
Her bust is lar(re, her feet are small, 
And her waterfall's, all right, 
Her teeth are like a

Her cheeks are bloom of youth, 
Her breath is nio•lit blooming cereus, 
And what I 
say is truth. 
Oh, how she, &c.

To dancing has been driven, 
To think that she upon them bcYlt, 
Makes an honest living.

You see before you a 
poor young miss, 
Who mourns both night and day, 
For, the loss of a 
fellow that called me his, 
But he's lately gone away. 
He vowed he loved me faithfully, 
And said we never should part, 
He's gone away a 
month to-day, 
Oh, my poor bleeding heart, heart, heart.

mourn for the loss of the man I

And I

And I 
am left behind him. 
Ana if he should not soon appear, 
I 
will upon my life, 
Offer myself to any one here, 
That'll take me as their wife. 
I'll mend your clothes and darn your hose, 
You see I'm gentle, quiet, 
Only give me a 
trial and I'll dress in style, 
And spend your cash all right, right, right.

mourn, &c. 
Now there's a 
gent I 
do declare, 
lie's looking at me now, 
I 
mean the one with the curly hair, 
To him I 
make a 
bow. 
I 
hope when you go away from here, 
You'll not forget me quite, 
But I'm keeping you to long, dear, 
Allow me to say good night, nip- ht, night.

Berry s 
Flying Trapeze 
A Visit to Barnum's. 
When I 
came to this city a 
short time ago, 
The first thing I 
did was to go to the show, 
The elephant I 
heard of so determined to see him, 
I 
straightway bent my steps towards Barnum's 
Muse urn. 
The first thing I 
saw on ascending the stairs 
Was the old coat of Job full of tatters and tears, 
And the next thing I 
saw, which made my eyes 
glare, 
Was the scalp of a 
man that never had any hair. 
There was also a 
check on the bank of a 
river, 
A 
roar from the sea, from love's arrows a 
quiver, 
A 
couple of spokes from Grant's wheel into line. 
And a 
quilt from the bed of the ocean so fine. 
The heaves from a 
horse, a 
spark from loves flame, 
A 
limb from a 
tree that from Limerick came, 
A 
bark of a 
dog and a 
squeak from a 
pig, 
And a 
couple of steps from a 
neat Irish jig. 
A 
shock from a 
cannon, a 
quake from the earth, 
A 
point of a 
question full of laughter and mirth, 
A bushel of dirt from the pathway of life, 
A man that was married and never had a 
wife. 
The tail of a 
comet, a 
shot from the stars, 
A 
moan from the wind, the sword worn by Mars, 
A 
sigh from the willow on the banks of the Doon, 
And the whiskers and beard of the man in the 
moon. 
A 
blast that was blown from the trumpet of fame, 
A 
limp from a 
soldier whom battle made lame, 
A 
roll from the billows, a 
blush from the morn, 
An old pair of trousers that never was worn. 
A 
streak of good fortune, a 
crack of a 
joke, 
A hug of a 
bear and a 
pitcher of smoke, 
A 
frog with a 
beard of Methuselah's goat, 
And a 
piece of the collar of Greeley's white coat.

An

A

Who wished my hand to claim. 
But from my feet I

At I

Although he liked me very well, 
Red better loved champagne.

Kicking up a

And always ready tor a

One moment still he couldn't rest, 
he .c 
pass whole nights and days, 
In drinking Madame Cliquot's best, 
And smoking Henry Clays. 
Ther when to bed he'd homeward go, 
With wild disordered brain, 
He'd lay it to his studies, tho' 
I 
know it was to champagne.

W:tli hocks of golden hair, 
And when I 
offered her my hand, 
She solemnly did declare : 
Thai I

And she'd fondle me quite free, 
An

But Sarah I 
could not see, 
I 
suppose they went to another hall, 
How she did suffer for me. 
Soda water Sallie, &c. 
Now there was our butcherman, 
And Sarah liked his meat, 
Sometimes when she'd go to his stand, 
he'd out and treat, 
He'd say, my dear, what will you have, 
When seated they would be, 
In some Ice Cream Saloon, 
And how Sarah suffered for tile. 
Soda Water Sallie, &c. 
Now we are both happy, 
For married since we got, 
A boy that calls me papa, 
And two girls they are our lot, 
I

For Sarah complains to time, 
And it often grieves my heart to think, 
How that poor girl suffers for me.

What a 
wonderful age ' tis we live in, 
What occasion for wonder and awe, 
fittr that the world's going crazy, 
In spite of all reason and law. 
The country is full of contention, 
Speculation the wildest ever Feen; 
We've the ends of the earth, tied together, 
And perform all our duties by steam.

Good people look out for your senses, 
Each day some new wonder will bring, 
And stand by our trinle-hued banner, 
For we've got the whole world on a 
string. 
The north and south raised a 
question, 
Which neither could see in that light, 
Whether white man's as good as a 
nigger, 
Or nicre-er as good as a 
white, 
The matter was settled by fighting, 
For years they terribly fought, 
The result was that white man or nigger, 
Was only a 
difference in thought,

By hearts true as steel, they are led, 
They will follow their emerald banner, 
As in triumph it waves o'er the red,

From this world he had taken flight, 
So they drank his health with all their might. 
They danced and reeled about, Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made 'em feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary.

And where the whiskey, quick wint round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary.

Thought it high time that he should wake. 
Wid fear, says he, I'll make 'em qnake; 
So he gave the coffin a

Farewell to the old stage, 
I've trodden so oft, 
Depicting all passions, 
The fierce and the soft. 
These gray hairs, these long years, 
Admonish me hence, 
And my sighs and my tears, 
Show my grief is intense.' 
Farewell to the green-room, 
Where we actors did meet, 
With its wall all maroon, 
And its fixings so neat. 
At rehearsal and night, 
How blithe were we there, 
Surrounded by bright eyes, 
And forms that were fair.

For our seperate characters, 
Ambitiously played.

And whose manners were grace.

With Minnie Clyde for my keeper. 
In the festive throng, she sings a 
sweet song, 
With the lowly, alike she is meek, 
Her eyes are like the windows of her soul, 
Through which Minnie's heart would speak. 
Oh, Minnie Clyde, Lc. 
Oh, blest are the hearts that live in the cot, 
That stands at the foot of the hill, 
Oh, s,‘ eet are the songs that echo in the glen, 
By the murmur of the moss covered mill. 
The birds all chant their notes to Minnie, 
The angels above have caressed her, 
But you have the angels, and you have the birds, 
And I'll have Kitty Clyde's sister.

Once loved a 
darling fairy, 
In the shape of a 
bluo-oyed, fair haired girl 
Whose Either kept a 
dairy. 
Not far from the middle of the old Kent Road, 
How well I 
knew it rather, 
She lived with her daddy, a 
cross old buffer, 
And my loved one's name was Martha. 
SPOKEN.—Sweet Martha.

Alt, I 
once was as happy as a 
young cock robin 
Or the pretty little fishes in the water, 
Those days are gone, for now I 
mourn, 
For Martha the milkman's daughter. 
Sery'd the milk hap-orth and penn-orths, 
From the bottom of a 
block tin pail, 
The only cow her father kept 
Was the one with an iron tail. 
And that was kept in the little back-yard, 
Up against the white'd wall, 
It always yielded plenty of--
I 
mustn't tell you all. 
Ah. I

When the old boy used to walk his chalks,

But I'd strong objeclions to her father.

Then I 
used to wander near the house, 
In hopes my love to see, 
She'd take a

In hopes that she'd see me.

Which made my blood turn cold,

An old codger with heaps of gold.

When at last they did discover, 
A 
note to say she'd gone away, 
To die for her true lover. 
Ah I 
one-, &c. 
SPOKEN.—And that was me. 
Next morning in the pure bright Thames, 
Her lovely form was found, 
With all her clothes in such a

Her darling self she drown'd. 
From the horrible effects of sugar of leaci, 
Her daddy died that night, 
And the verdict the coroners inquest found 
Was, it served the old fool right.

SHE LIVED IN

Oh, pity me pray, and hear what t 
have to say, 
For my bosom has been set on fire, 
By one I 
consider'd as true as the day, 
But now she is faithless Maria. 
And when I 
recount all my troubles and woes, 
And miseries which to you 1'11 now disclose, 
You'll say in this world, you would hardly sup-
pose, 
There was such a 
false maid as Maria. 
CHORUS. 
may be to blame, but I 
love her the same, 
Though my feelings she's tried to injure. 
She's as false as she's fair, and she's twelve pounds 
a year, 
And she lives in the land of Green Ginger. 
I'm a 
journeyman baker, and first went to Hull, 
One Saturday night in September, 
And Maria no cook and her elegant look, 
I 
shall ever have cause to remember. 
Each day on my round I 
would go with my bread, 
Contented till love nearly turned my poor head, 
You see bow I 
blush, and my face will grow red, 
When I 
mention the name of Maria.

I 
would take her and never forsake her. 
But a 
policeman came on the Green Ginger beat, 
And as they are always looking for something 
to eat. 
No matter if pudding that's stale or cold meat, 
Of course he made love to Maria. 
I 
may be, &c. 
At last when I 
asked her to settle the day, 
She said with a 
smile of derision, 
She rather would marry her officer bold, 
\Vho belonged to the borouult division. 
What deceive your young baker that loves you so 
true. 
She only said rubbish, and answered pooh, pooh. 
My heart went down, like a 
lump of stale dough, 
As I 
took a 
last look at Maria. 
I 
may be, &c. 
I 
could weep. I 
could cry, I 
shall pine, I 
shall die. 
E.tch day I 
grow thinner and thinner, 
I 
grieve at my meals whether dinner or tea, 
And I 
fret at my breakfast and dinner. 
You see at a 
glance how I'm wasting away,

hear the folks say,

And gave the cake such longing looks, 
That I

paid, 
Tho' she ate every one, 
I 
thought this was the sort of maid, 
To suit a

A 
pint of port she drank or more, 
Then said her head swam round, 
We scarcely got outside the door, 
When she fell on the ground. 
She pulled me down, with her I 
fell, 
Folks roared to see the fun, 
Boys cried aloud here's drunken Sal, 
Whacking the farmer's son. 
Of her ashamed away I 
ran, 
As though to save my life, 
I 
then knocked down a 
poor old man, 
Also a

Her husband cried, mind what yer do. 
Now j

adventures crimson almoat 
every page. 
No. 2. Prairie Pete; or, The 
Trapper's Avenger. Of all the tales of'

page of this thrilling book is full of in-
cident. 
The characters are natural,

The hot sun of Sonora fills their veins 
and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begin to 
oompare with it. 
No. G. Six-Shooter Jim. This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a

and the sanguinary. It is a 
truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rifle, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
No. 7. The Wrecker's Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the i 
run-hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea-

the ruffians that surround her—ruffians 
more cruel than the awfsl waves that 
dash on the wreck-strewn shore by 
which she area.

dark caverns that honey-comb the storm 
lashed shores of Cornwall witness terri-
ble crimes in their recesses. Smugglers,

perpetrate terrible and unholy crimes.

tug. 
Ito. 11. Sam Sutton, the Scalp 
Taker. In this boek figure many of

No. 15. Leathershini or, The 
Prairie Guide. This well-hnown Scout
