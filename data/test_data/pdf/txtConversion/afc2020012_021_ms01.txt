AG:  Hi.  Thank you so much for participating in the Library of Congress Interviews.  Can I ask 
you to introduce yourself? 
 
RG:  Hello.  I’m Racquell Garrett.  I’m a registered nurse, and I’ve been a nurse for 21 years. 
 
AG:  Can I ask you a little bit about your family and educational background? 
 
RG:  I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.  My parents were -- my dad was a 
welder, and my mom was a social worker.  I have one older sister so I’m the youngest.  I went to 
-- I’m trying to see -- guess when talking about education, predominantly religious institutions.  I 
went to schooling from seventh grade all the way through college so high school was -- I went to 
all girl Catholic high school, and for college I went to a Methodist University.  A lot of my 
college experience or educational experience has been in religious institutions.  For my 
Bachelor’s Degree I went to Dillard University which is a historically black college and 
university in New Orleans, Louisiana which is also where my mom attended and an aunt, both 
graduated from Dillard University.  It’s actually the oldest nursing program in the State of 
Louisiana.  For graduate school, I went to Pennsylvania State University, and University Park or 
State College Pennsylvania, and I received my Doctorate in 2015 from Loyola University in 
New Orleans. 
 
AG:  Oh that’s terrific.  Just to back up for a second.  Could I ask you, when you were in school 
as a young person were there any subjects that you were particularly drawn too? 
 
RG:  So math and science were my favorite subjects.  Not that I had the best grades in math and 
science, but I’ve always been an inquisitive person, more of a hands on person and like to solve 
things so the sciences, you know, it has lab, and you get to go play with things, and then math 
you can solve problems.  Not that I was necessarily an A student in math, but I typically got 
good grades in science, but math was kind of my struggle, and for me a struggle is a B. Then I 
was in honors classes in high school so we had like physics, and trigonometry our senior year in 
high school so we just had more advanced maths, but it was still, I guess fun, which was weird to 
some people to me.  But my circle of friends were kinda all the same.  Like one of my best 
friends is a physicist so we kinda like difficult things.  But when I went to college, you know, 
because of the strong math and science I had, I was able to test out of lots of maths and sciences 
in college so it was helpful. 
 
AG:  Where there extracurricular or social activities that you enjoyed when you were growing 
up? 
 
RG:  So my extracurricular activities varied, and was not consistent I’ll be honest.  I was on track 
for a little bit, was in choir, but I don’t know how to sing, but in the State of Louisiana to 
graduate with honors you have to have certain extracurricular activities so choir was one I did.  I 
did band for one year.  But mostly the extracurricular activity I stuck with was video.  Actually

in high school my graduating class was the first class to have a senior video when we graduated, 
and I kinda still do a lot with videos now even though that’s not my area of profession. 
 
AG:  That’s so cool.  So you’re like a videographer on the side. 
 
RG:  Yes.  So the sorority that I’m in now, they always joke with me “you always like to do 
videos”, and it’s just -- I like to watch stuff. 
 
AG:  I wonder, do you remember visiting a doctor or a health care provider when you were 
growing up? 
 
RG:  Yes.  When I was growing up we always went to the doctor regularly so I still remember 
the buildings, and locations where my doctor’s offices were.  It just so happened to be down the 
street from my grandmother so we literally could walk to it.  The building is not there anymore, 
but I remember where it is.  So yeah, we regularly attended the doctor. 
 
AG:  Do you have any memories of those experiences as being good or bad or [00:05:00] 
neutral? 
 
RG:  Nothing negative.  Just fearful of the dentist just because everybody’s fearful of the dentist, 
but always remembering you would get a sucker or something at the end when you were 
younger, and I probably remember the playrooms more so than the actual going to see the doctor. 
 
[05:20] AG:  Absolutely.  I wonder, do you remember when you decided to become a nurse? 
 
RG:  So actually it’s funny because all through high school I said I was going to be a doctor, and 
a lawyer, and I in particularly wanted to live on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans which is 
kinda where the big houses were, and things like that, and I used to tell all my family and friends, 
and everybody’s gonna move in a house together.  We’re all gonna stay in the same house, and 
my aunt used to always say “alright, yeah.  We’ll see in a couple of years what you say or 
whatever”.  In probably my junior year in high school or senior year I decided to be a nurse, and 
to this day when people say -- especially since I went on to get my doctorate, “well why didn’t 
you just become a doctor?”  And this is not to insult anybody, but this is just how I feel, and I tell 
them I became a nurse because doctors cure, and nurses care, and there’s a difference.  So that’s 
just my belief, and my observation a lot of times.  You know, nurses are there more.  Not that 
doctors are not important.  Everybody’s important to the healthcare system, but nurses just spend 
more time caring. 
 
AG:  (Inaudible 0:06:32.0).  That’s a great point, and I was just talking with someone yesterday 
about the fact that nurses are the most trusted profession year after year because of that caring 
component of the job.  Absolutely.  So can you tell me, I know you said you attended nursing 
school in -- wait, you got your PhD from Loyola, your Master’s from Penn State, and where was 
your first nursing program?  Was that at Dillard?

RG:  Dillard in (inaudible 0:07:00.1). 
 
AG:  Okay. 
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to get credentialed?  I assume that led to 
your RN right? 
 
RG:  Right. 
 
AG:  Was it a BS RN? 
 
RG:  Right. 
 
AG:  Can you talk a little bit about how that process went, what those early classes were like? 
 
RG:  It was rough.  Freshman year to me was easy I would say.  Even though I had a heavy 
course load because the way nursing program -- if you wanted to finish in four years, you had to 
take a lot of courses plus go to summer school so my first year as a freshman, I took 21 hours.  
Some of them were not heavy courses.  I think what helped me again is my high school 
education.  We kinda ended up being in honors classes in high school.  I tested out of almost all 
my final exams because the way they set up it was kind of if you had a certain GPA or grade in 
the class they just told you don’t worry about it.  So that was helpful.  It was a busy course load 
so it was a lot.  Now once I got to sophomore year, that’s when you move into the nursing 
specific courses, and one of the things I personally know I’ve always struggled with is test 
taking.  I can have the knowledge.  If you ask me a question, I can answer the question, but to do 
it in a test form, I used to get anxiety about it so I struggled actually in my first course to the 
point that they always almost wanted me to drop, and I wouldn’t so it wasn’t a matter of me 
needing to study more, it was a matter of me learning how to take tests in nursing, and I tell -- 
now anytime I hear somebody who wants to go to nursing school, I tell them they have to change 
their frame of reference of how they take tests because in a multiple choice question on a nursing 
course every answer is right.  So they may say “hey, a patient comes in with x, y, and z what 
would you do?”  Well you would do all of those things.  It’s really about what’s the priority, and 
that wasn’t something that was always stressed to me until I got to one instructor who kind of 
said “hey.  We’re gonna do all this.  We’re gonna call the doctor.  We’re gonna give this 
medicine.  We’re gonna check vitals”, but it’s always what is the priority to do first, and so once 
I learned that concept, I started to do better so I’m intentional when I hear of people who are 
going to nursing school or we have new grads or residents or something come into our hospital I 
even go over that with them as well.  That when you take the tests, all the questions -- all the 
answers are right.  It’s usually one maybe you wouldn’t do, but for the most part it’s something 
you would -- three of the four you would definitely do.  So that was probably my biggest 
struggle, but the positive for my university is because it was a smaller university, smaller classes

[00:10:00] the teachers knew you.  They would come to you if they saw you struggling in classes 
or certain GPA, and the goal was for you to finish in four years.  It’s actually something that’s on 
the campus now even though it’s a different President from when I was there, they have banners 
throughout the campus that says “finish in four”.  So the goal is not for people to lag around and 
get comfortable, and hang out ‘cause sometimes college is fun.  The goal is, you need to finish in 
four years, and go about your business.  The nursing program though is rigorous like I’m sure 
you’ve heard with a lot of nurses, and I don’t care which program you go to they’re difficult, but 
it’s difficult for a reason ‘cause you’re caring for people, and their life so it shouldn’t be easy, 
and they do want to make sure you know.  One of the things I will say is when I left, I probably 
felt I wasn’t prepared, and I hear that from a lot of nursing students.  They never feel prepared, 
and I tell them now just from being on the other side you’ll never feel prepared, and you’ll learn 
most of what you need to know in practice, and the biggest thing is really if you don’t know 
something to say something, and not pretend like you know ‘cause you’re embarrassed because, 
you know, you pretending could mean somebody’s life. 
 
AG:  Did you go directly from the BS to working as a nurse or did you go to the Master’s 
Program next? 
 
RG:  I went directly to Penn -- 
 
AG:  -- to the Master’s? 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:11:39.4). 
 
AG:  Wow. 
 
RG:  So I finished in May 2000 from Dillard and started Penn State in August of 2000 which is 
not traditional in nursing.  Typically you need experience to get a Master’s Degree, but there was 
a linkage program with Dillard University and Penn State so one of the faculty at Penn State 
graduated from Dillard, and wrote a grant to have students from Dillard attend Penn State, and it 
just so happened I was in the first (inaudible 0:12:08.2) that did that program, and eventually it 
spread to other programs not just nursing that Dillard and Penn State had a linkage.  I’m not sure 
if it’s -- well I do know they still do it, but it’s not the same as when I went, but they still have 
that little linkage program.  So it’s not traditional for people to go straight from Bachelor’s, 
especially back then.  It was kinda like “well you don’t have any experience”.  So while I was at 
Penn State I did work to gain some experience during the summer, but then Penn State told me to 
stop because they wanted us to finish the program.  So I did get some experience out there as a 
nurse so that was helpful. 
 
[12:52] AG:  Do you remember your first position as a nurse? 
 
RG: I do.  So it would be in Pennsylvania.  It was in Lewistown, Pennsylvania which is a small 
town, and for me coming from New Orleans driving in the mountains was an adjustment for me,

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
and I worked night shift, and that being super -- I mean, I didn’t have to deal with snow because 
I started in the summer, and kinda quit before they had a major snow incident or anything, but 
my first position -- and I tell people this a lot.  My first job was actually on an oncology unit with 
cancer patients, and I say fortunately, and unfortunately it helped me deal with death and dying 
because you have people suffering, and in some instances because I worked nights sometimes 
family members were not there.  So you were the last person they may have held a hand with or 
you may have found them, but I think I probably, on that unit, did more like post mortem care 
than ever.  And it was cancer/palliative unit, and I had to deal with a lot of -- not a lot, but I think 
the first patient -- well he was, my first patient that passed was actually a ward of the state so he 
actually had no family so that was, you know, being the first patient I ever had to pass, and then 
dealing with that it was to me overwhelming.  So it was, I guess, good and bad.  It kinda helped 
me deal with death and dying because we talk about it, and I tell people this all the time.  I never 
want to be a hospice or palliative nurse, that’s not my calling because I got into nursing to -- and 
you’re still caring, but you want to -- when you see somebody you just want to do whatever you 
can do, and it’s an adjustment to say “that’s not what they want”, but that’s their right.  So you 
really have to -- I tell people that all the time.  [00:15:00] If you’re a mental health nurse or a 
palliative care nurse that’s a true calling. 
 
AG:  That’s a great point.  How did you cope with that?  Your first job and so much intensity.  
You know, that’s such an intense unit for the first experience. 
 
RG:  It was, and I guess initially I just wanted a job to get some experience so I didn’t care where 
they put me, but it helped in a lot of areas that even now I’m still using. Some things that some 
nurses were not used to, I was already used to because I had worked there, and it was an Infusion 
Center, but it was helpful because they had other nurses and staff around who were used things, 
and I think it helps in the sense that most of the patients I did deal with died peacefully.  There 
were some -- they weren’t my patients, but you heard the stories of some things, and I don’t want 
to get too graphic, but you know, things rupturing and people kind of bleed out.  So those things 
are -- if I had observed that in the beginning, I probably would have been like “I can’t do this”.  
But I’ve never worked oncology again either. 
 
AG:  You got in, and you got out. 
 
RG:  Right.  But it was a good experience. 
 
AG:  Mm-hmm.  And at the time you were also pursuing your Master’s. 
 
RG:  Right. 
 
AG:  Was that a specialization through the Master’s or what degree does that lead to? 
 
RG:  So my Master’s Degree was actually as a clinical nurse specialist in public health and 
community health so my goal kinda was, at that time, open my own clinic that would be a 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
2020012 
 
 
 
Nursing America's Veterans 
8 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
community clinic so that’s why I did that track.  Now I’ve changed since then, but initially -- and 
that’s kind of why they don’t really encourage nurses to go straight from undergrad to your 
Master’s because as you get experience, you change what you want to do.  Even from college, 
what I thought I was going to be doing I’ve never done.  So, you know, that’s kind of why they -- 
and I remember -- and they still say it today.  Instructors will tell you nurses always need to do 
one year of med/surg experience before you do anything else.  And part of that is because with 
med/surg you get a variety of different things so then you get to see “hey, do I want to specialize 
in this or go to this”, but health care changes so much.  So no oncology wasn’t a specialty.  It just 
so happened to be where they picked me. 
 
AG:  After the Master’s, did you go and work in like a med/surg unit?  Was that the next step for 
you? 
 
RG:  Yeah.  So when I finished my Master’s, I graduated in May and in May I moved back to 
New Orleans, and applied for jobs at a couple of hospitals.  It was not the VA that I started.  I 
started in a private institution with a goal of becoming an ICU nurse, and then some things 
happened there with staffing, and I was not happy, and kinda felt my license was in jeopardy 
with the patient load and expectations.  I think something happened one day where a code was 
called, and the toilet was also overrunning, and it was like they were about to shock a patient, but 
you’re standing in water.  I was like literally at -- I didn’t go in the room, and literally after that I 
wrote a letter of resignation to the manager that day telling them I was taking two weeks.  Prior 
to that, I had already started looking for something else, but that was kinda almost like the straw 
as they say that broke the camel’s back, and it was actually nurse who worked at that facility 
who retired from the VA who told me “you need to go to the VA”.  She was like “you’d be better 
suited there, and you probably would be happier.  It’s a lot of things you can do in the VA.  You 
can move around”.  She had retired, and she’s the person who encouraged me to go the VA. 
 
[19:09] AG:  What made the VA appealing or what did she think would make it a good match 
for you? 
 
RG:  For her, she felt, as most people say initially it’s the benefits.  Government benefits was the 
main thing, and I think for me that was it, and then I knew some other people who graduated 
from Dillard who went there.  Several of our instructors worked at the VA, most of them in 
mental health even though that wasn’t an area I was going into, but a lot of them talked about the 
ability to move up and do different things.  In nursing in general no matter where you go, bedside 
nursing is not the only nursing so there’s so many opportunities in nursing, but they felt at the 
VA you could move around more sometimes than what you could at other [00:20:00] facilities.  
They felt -- that was her thing, and then her thing too is you could retire in a certain amount of 
time.  If you get in the VA young and still go work somewhere else which is what she did so she 
was able -- I mean, she wasn’t young, young, but her thing was you can retire at a certain -- by 
you get to this age, and work five years somewhere else, and get another retirement which a lot 
of people do.

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
AG:  Right.  That makes a lot of sense.  Do you remember the first role that you had with the 
VA? 
 
RG:  Yes.  I was a floor nurse on a medicine unit, nights of course.  I prefer nights when I was 
working the floor, but it was a medicine unit, small medicine unit, and actually one of the nurses 
who graduated two years behind me at Dillard was my preceptor on the unit.  It was nice.  It was 
a small unit.  The VA building itself was a little old and outdated so I kinda felt how some 
people felt about the VA in that sense.  But yeah, it was a medicine floor, patients of different 
ages.  They didn’t stay very long so it was kind of a, I call it a regular medicine unit. 
 
AG:  Like a typical unit in an acute care facility. 
 
RG:  Right.  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Can you define or explain what a preceptor is? 
 
RG:  A preceptor is when you get hired to a new job, they’re the ones who kind of get you up to 
speed so you can work by yourself.  Typically, depending on a nurse’s experience, you can be in 
what we call orientation with a preceptor so it’s really your orientation to the floor.  You would 
work with them.  Usually like the first week or so you may just shadow them, and eventually 
they add patients until you’re up to a full load, make sure you know how to manage the systems, 
you can admit a patient, discharge a patient.  You know how to get in contact with the doctors.  
You know how to prep patients for different procedures.  You know how to do certain 
procedures, nursing procedures and protocols kinda making sure you know the policies and 
things like that.  Typically, well now in nursing it can be up to 12 weeks.  They usually say they 
want 12 weeks and longer for a new grad, but with experience it can be anywhere from 3 to 12 
weeks.  Back then that’s what it was. 
 
AG:  How long did you stay in that role on the medical unit? 
 
RG:  In the role or in orientation? 
 
AG:  In the role.  Like your (inaudible 0:22:38.7). 
 
RG:  So I was there -- I started the VA in 2003, February  2003, and was there until Hurricane 
Katrina.  I was still a VA employee, but when of the big benefits to me of the VA, and why I’ve 
stayed so long is when they have natural disasters you don’t lose your job.  All they did was they 
identified and, again, this was before social media and all that kind of stuff.  You didn’t have 
that.  Everybody didn’t even have a cell phone then, but they had to put on the news -- so when 
you evacuated for Hurricane Katrina, they had on the news almost all across Louisiana if you 
work for the VA call this number.  So everybody had to call in, say where you were, and they 
kinda of -- if you were at a local, you know, close to another VA then you went to work there 
until you found another job.  The benefit too was if people -- I know one of my co-workers

evacuated to Tennessee so no matter where we were, when we applied for jobs within the VA 
system we got first preference because at that time the VA was destroyed.  They didn’t know 
when it was coming back or whatever so they took some people back.  I tried to get back to New 
Orleans, and I just didn’t make the cut.   So when we had to apply for different jobs, we got first 
dibs as long as we qualified.  We still had to qualify, but we kinda got first dibs at our jobs. 
 
AG:  Wow.  What role do you have now? 
 
RG:  Right now? 
 
AG:  Still with the VA, but in a different position right? 
 
RG:  Yeah.  So currently I’m in Houston, Texas -- 
 
AG:  -- mm-hmm. 
 
RG:  -- at the Houston VA which is the largest VA in the VA system, and I am the lead clinical 
instructor for simulation.  So what we do, I don’t know if you’re familiar with simulation, but 
simulation is -- we kind of use mannequins and different technology to train staff.  We have 
mannequins that can speak.  You can listen to lung sounds, heart sounds.  The physicians can do 
different procedures on the mannequin, and the goal is as we tell people, this is where you make 
mistakes.  We can restart the mannequin.  We can’t restart a human life so if it’s something you 
don’t know, this is the place to say “I don’t know”, come practice.  Kind of a [00:25:00] skills 
lab as well so if nurses need help starting IVs or physicians need help putting in different types 
of lines, and things like that then they can come -- or intubating, they can come in there and 
practice, and get the skills.  So I kinda coordinate.  I don’t necessarily teach the physicians, but 
we kinda coordinate the schedules for physicians and residents, and then we manage the nurses.  
Dieticians also come in to do training more so with interviewing patients, and being comfortable 
with that, asking the questions, getting in the flow.  We see a variety.  It’s an inter-professional 
education resource. 
 
AG:  Do you offer classes yourself? 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:25:46.6) teach classes, and I actually work nights so because we have staff, 
and people always say “well whose getting training at night?” and I’m like people do work at the 
hospital at night, and by me being a night nurse, and I’m happy for the vision my director had 
because her thing was the staff that worked nights should not have to stay over extra hours to get 
the same training that people in the day shift.  ‘Cause a lot of times we do -- and I say this all the 
time when I sit in meetings, like we do a lot of policies and procedures, and when we do it we 
think about Monday through Friday 7:30 to 4:00 or 8:00 to 5:00.  So when I’m ever in a meeting 
I know they think I’m trying to disrupt things, but I’m always from a perspective that I was a 
night nurse, and they would say “well we can have this department do this”, and I’m like “but 
that department isn’t working on Saturday at 7:00 pm so whose gonna do that then?”  I always

think in health care you can’t just worry about Monday through Friday 8:00 to 5:00.  The ER is 
open 24 hours.  Nurses, doctors are there 24 hours, respiratory therapists.  Health care is 24/7 so 
we have to think about managing things 24/7 as well. 
 
AG:  So what’s an example of -- are these courses that the participants enroll in and take multiple 
sessions or is it more like a one day or weekend long workshop? 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:27:11.5).  We try not to make it too long because people lose -- so what we 
have been doing, and we’re thinking about doing some different things, but just in general across 
the VA you can have both.  We do do new employee orientation so all nursing staff come 
through us.  That is longer because we may spend eight hours with them one day, and four hours 
another week, and review all the skills so they can get hands on, get comfortable because even 
though they may have 20 years of experience equipment changes from facility to facility so in 
those instances we may spend more time with them, but when it comes to regular trainings 
outside of orientation we try to stick to one hour.  The reason is one they’re on duty so we don’t 
want to remove them from their unit too long or their work area unless it’s something that’s 
mandated by our hospital director in which he sometimes has said “I want all the staff trained on 
x, y and z”.  We will make sure they get the time either, you know, vacation time.  They’ll give 
authorized time where they don’t have to use their own time, but typically we do that again 
because they’re in their area, and what we do is it may be like a 10-15 minute simulation just to 
get to the crux of what we’re trying to teach or cover.  ‘Cause most of this is stuff they know.  
We just try to use it as refreshers.  A lot of times we work with our Patient Safety Department so 
if they see trends in something, we’ll have a meeting, and they’ll say “hey, we need to do some 
training on this.  We’re seeing a lot of this on the rise” or if they have more needle sticks or 
something they’ll say “hey, the residents, the physicians are sticking themselves more or less” -- 
and we may not change a training, but we’ll add something to it to say “hey, how are y’all gonna 
address this?” or if this happens, and in simulation a lot of learning doesn’t happen in the 
simulation.  It’s in the discussion that happens after it, and we call that debriefing.  When you 
kinda review, you know, as learners do something, we’ll say “well what was your thought 
process that made you do that?”  One thing is -- and we have a Union at the VA, and one thing 
we did negotiate with the Union is that our area is not punitive.  So managers cannot send people 
there for us to tell them they’re not competent.  Now we will do assessments of somebody to say 
“hey, they need work in this area.  This is their weakness, etc.”, but they cannot then use that for 
a reason to terminate an employee.  So our goal is to make sure our area is a safe learning space, 
and that if people have questions we don’t even communicate [00:30:00] with managers of how 
their staff perform unless it’s something that’s dangerous to a patient.  Probably twice, I’ve been 
doing this -- I just realized almost ten years.  I opened this center in 2013.  Probably since then 
we’ve only had to communicate three times about a specific employee. It is helpful to even when 
they come in the system so as we’re seeing people in orientation, again, there have been some -- 
and some of them -- let me just say this, some people in health care don’t believe in simulation.  
Like they feel it doesn’t add value, but I’ve told them every new employee we’ve seen in 
orientation who we say will be a problem has been a problem.  There have been some managers 
who have been able to back us, and say “hey, yeah Racquell.  They told us about this employee,

and we terminated that employee in three weeks”.  It was another one, you know, who did some 
questionable stuff, and they were like “yeah.  He ended up being a problem.  He filed lawsuits”.  
You know some things we can pick up on with people.  When people ask certain questions all 
the time it’s like when you’re in orientation asking certain questions, it’s like are you really here 
to work or are you trying to figure out how you’re gonna be disruptive. 
 
AG:  That’s so interesting.  So you get the first kind of interaction -- 
 
RG:  -- right.  Right -- 
 
AG:  -- with the new staff. 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:31:33.1) we have what we call a new employee report card.  So when they 
come through orientation we’ll kind of give them some feedback, and say “hey, this is” -- and 
the reason we do that is to guide their orientation, but we’ll say “hey, this person needs more 
help in this skill, you know, you can send them back to us whenever, you know, during the 
orientation or in your orientation they may need more hands on with this”.  They get the concept, 
but they just may need more hands on so we use it for that.  Again, not to be punitive, but to kind 
of make the orientation more specific. 
 
[32:11] AG:  Mm-hmm.  How would you describe your typical work week?  I know you said 
you work evenings.  Is it overnight or what is the schedule like for you? 
 
RG:  My particular department we are able to work all shifts.  We work Monday through Friday 
so we don’t work Saturdays and Sundays, but a typical week for me it varies so I guess I don’t 
have a typical week.  It all depends on the training.  Now typically every Friday we will have 
orientation so Friday’s we know we’re gonna be doing orientation, and we have some set days 
like when residents will come in for a couple of hours, and lead some trainings, some 
simulations.  But a typical, I guess on average, it's mostly us designing new trainings, meeting 
with different areas or departments to align trainings that they want and set up trainings to 
facilitate whatever need they have in their area and then implementing.  So mostly meetings, 
developing trainings, preparing for the next training.  Right now we’re designing some virtual 
simulations so kinda with the goggles, and we’re working with a company to set that up so that’s 
been a lot of that going on.  We work with new -- we have a residency program for nurses, and 
we meet with them every Monday to do different simulations as well. 
 
AG:  Do you like going to work? 
 
RG:  I do.  I have a lot of friends that work in Corporate America, and one thing I can say is I’ve 
been at positions in the VA where I hated going to work, and I always tell people when I’ve 
hated going to work it’s never been about the patient.  It’s never been about the job.  It’s always 
been about co-workers or leadership or the lack of leadership, and so I don’t leave the VA.  I just 
moved somewhere else to another position.  Again that’s, to me, the benefit of the VA.  There’s 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
2020012 
 
 
 
Nursing America's Veterans 
13 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
lots of things you can do within the VA system, and I mean in any health care system there’s a 
lot you can do, but I can say in my current position I don’t dislike going to work.  Like I don’t 
wake up and like “hey, I just don’t want to go to work today”.  I do think there are times, and I’m 
sure everybody feels this, there are times where you’re just ready for something different and 
something new.  For me, it’s more so because I don’t like to get stuck in anything.  I always like 
to learn different things so I say that to say it’s not that I dislike my job, I just think there are 
some times where I’m like “what’s gonna be my next thing to do”. 
 
AG:  What do you think the [00:35:00] most difficult part of being a nurse at the VA is? 
 
RG:  Hmm.  I don’t -- okay.  I guess -- I don’t know if I would get in trouble for this, but I guess 
the most difficult thing would be you work for the government, and I say that in the sense that a 
lot of policies and procedures are actually not guided by the people at the facility.  You get these 
things that come down from Congress that says “hey all VA’s need to do that”.  As soon as we 
hear it, we’re like that’s not feasible.  We don’t have the staff to do that, and then you hire people 
to track this data, but we don’t need people to track data.  We need people to do the work.  So I 
guess for me -- and that’s not nursing per specific, but I think any profession probably in the VA 
probably feels that can be a little frustrating.  There’s this thing in nursing called magnate status 
which a lot of hospitals try to obtain magnate status, and our facility is one.  One of the things I 
do agree with the magnate perspective is that the worker’s need to have input.  So one of their 
big things is the bedside nurse should be involved in policy making and procedure, and I feel that 
that’s not how the VA system works.  I say this -- I’m not gonna say that.  Yeah, I’ll just leave it. 
 
AG:  Understood.  That makes sense though.  There’s that tension between the expertise of the 
nurses, and -- 
 
RG: -- I wouldn’t say its tension.  I just think not always intentional to ask the people who have 
to do the work. 
 
AG:  Right.  
 
RG:  And we should be more intentional.  If you’re gonna ask a bedside nurse or a physician or a 
social worker to do x, y, and z maybe we should ask them what’s the best way to get that done.  
If this is the end goal as somebody whose gonna have to assist, what do you feel is the best way 
to get there? 
 
AG:  I see.  That makes a great deal of sense. 
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Then what would you say is the most rewarding part of being a nurse at the VA?

RG:  I know this is gonna seem, what they call that?  A cookie cutter answer, but I do feel there 
is a plus with working with the veterans.  You get to see people of all different ages, all different 
experiences.  Recently I’ve been working, giving vaccines for Coronavirus, and just to hear the 
stories they have of their days in the military, and how they used to give vaccines.   So they sit 
down and be like “why y’all just don’t use the gun?  When the used to just shoot us all up”, and 
I’m like “you have got to be” -- everybody comes in here, and I say “I’m gonna have to look up 
what this gun looks that y’all were shot up with”, and most of them are Vietnam Veterans, and 
I’m really like “we’re not gonna use that.  I’m sure sanitation has changed since then so we’re 
not gonna use that”.  They all come with the same story about how they got vaccines, and so 
when you give them the shot, “oh that’s it?  That’s nothing compared to the 20 shots they used to 
give us in the military”.  So just hearing the stories is nice.  I think just in general being a nurse, 
caring for people is what’s beneficial.  Even I don’t work bedside anymore, I know I’m helping 
the veteran by training the people who would care for them at bedside. 
 
[38:51] AG:  (Inaudible 0:38:51.4).  Can I ask you a little bit about how your role has changed 
because of the COVID pandemic?  It sounds like you took on some additional responsibilities 
during this time. 
 
RG:  My role has stayed the same.  I guess the demand for education changed.  At the beginning 
of the pandemic, we were hustling to get some people who had not been at the bedside in years 
ready to go back to the bedside.  We were doing a lot of training for maybe case managers who 
are nurses, but have been case managers for 20 years so they haven’t started an IV in years.  
They haven’t used the IV pump in years so we did a lot of massive training in the beginning to 
get them ready in case, you know, when the numbers were on the rise. 
 
AG:  So that was in anticipation of like an influx of patients? 
 
RG:  The surge, anticipating the surge. 
 
AG:  Was that like February 2020? 
 
RG:  March. 
 
AG:  March 2020. 
 
RG:  Near the end of March, beginning of April we did a lot of mass training [00:40:00], getting 
people up to date, hands on experience with different things like that.  Once the pandemic kinda 
took full throttle, our numbers at our VA never -- I mean they went high, but not to the point that 
people were in hallways or anything like that.  Even at the medical center, their numbers -- they 
were almost up to capacity, and people would say “well why is the VA’s numbers”, and I’d say 
“well you have to remember we only see veterans”.  These other facilities can see everybody.  
Now if the local leadership, State and City said “hey, we need the VA’s help” they could 
definitely request and, you know, the Secretary or the President would have to approve our

Nursing America's Veterans

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
facility assisting which I think they would have if that came to it.  We never saw the massive 
numbers at our facility like some other.  At some smaller facilities they did, but because our 
facility is one of the largest facilities in the VA, we didn’t have a lot.  The numbers weren’t like 
everybody else in the news, I guess I should say that.  As that moved around because of social 
distancing, and what we do requires a lot of hands on, we kinda saw a decline in classes.  We 
were primarily just doing new employees because they were trying to get new people in to help 
with the pandemic, and then we were training the screeners as well who were screening people in 
the entrances so that’s kinda how it changed a little bit. 
 
AG:  Do you administer the vaccines like through a volunteer position? 
 
RG:  I do both.  I volunteer and overtime.  The weekends because they’re trying to get a lot of 
people is overtime, and then the weekday if they have a lot of scheduled appointments then we 
help. 
 
AG:  How many months have you been administering vaccines? 
 
RG:  Oh just the past month probably. 
 
AG:  Just for a month or so. 
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Do you do that typically every weekend now? 
 
RG:  Not every weekend, uh-uh.  It’s available if I wanted to do every weekend. 
 
AG:  I see. 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:42:17.5) trying to get the numbers high. 
 
AG:  The numbers of vaccinated veterans, they want to get that up.  I see.  That makes sense.  Do 
you feel like the pandemic impacted the VA system specifically either because of the patient 
population or because it’s a federal facility?  Did you see any affects in the VA that you’re 
working at? 
 
RG:  I can’t say I did.  I mean, of course, the number of people in the building, appointments 
change, but I think that has been everybody.  I don’t think it’s VA specific.  I can’t say I’ve 
noticed anything.  Maybe one thing, and I don’t think it’s VA specific.  I noticed a lot of people 
retired at the start of the pandemic. 
 
AG:  Health care workers retired from their positions.

Nursing America's Veterans

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
RG:  I think it would have been some people who probably would have stayed a couple of years.  
We always say at the VA people are gonna die at the VA before they retire ‘cause there’s this 
myth in the VA that people die within one year of retirement, and I’ve seen it happen so I see 
why people say that, but I also say a lot of times that happens to people who don’t take vacation.  
Like, you have to rest.  I don’t care what job you’re in, you have to take time for yourself.  So I 
don’t think it’s a VA thing, but if you never take a vacation or just rest, your body doesn’t 
understand rest when you finally retire.  That happened to my mom.  She had a stroke within six 
months after retiring, and I say you always running, running, running, and a stroke can happen 
when you’re stressed, but if your body has normalized stress it doesn’t understand rest either.  
That’s my opinion.  That’s not research, but. 
 
AG:  Absolutely.  Oh I’m sorry about your mom’s passing. 
 
RG:  Oh no.  She didn’t pass.  She just had a stroke. 
 
AG:  Oh, she had a stroke.  
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Oh thank God.  I almost had a stroke listening. 
 
RG: Oh no. 
 
AG:  Same thing with my parents.  I’m very nervous about them when they finally retire. 
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG:  Like that adjustment.  Oh boy.  Well, I wonder.  Are there any -- going back to the 
pandemic for just a moment.  Are there any lessons that you’re taking from the whole COVID-
19 pandemic, and your experiences? 
 
RG:  I think the biggest lesson is probably not nursing specific, but probably my biggest lesson 
would be don’t take for granted the opportunity to meet with people.  There’s a couple of my 
friends, we’re like “well we were supposed to do lunch”.  We have been putting off lunch, and 
putting off, and the pandemic [00:45:00] hit.  You couldn’t get lunch, and everybody’s thinking 
“oh this’ll just be a couple of weeks”, and now here we’re up to a year just about with the 
pandemic, and you haven’t -- you know, even some people are lax, some people are still cautious 
and don’t want to go out and about, and you respect that.  So like some people you haven’t seen 
in a year.  Even my parents.  Right at the start of the pandemic last year, I was there for my 
birthday, and that was the last time I’ve seen my parents, and you know my mom every once in a 
while would say “well, when you coming?”  I’m like “well, it’s a pandemic”, and I say “and I 
work at a hospital”.  She’d say “yeah, you stay there”.  So, you know, just taking for granted 
gatherings with people, and not taking people for granted I guess.  I have lost maybe one person 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
2020012 
 
 
 
Nursing America's Veterans 
17 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
close to me, not a family member, but one of my best friend’s dad who’s also my tax preparer.  
He passed, and that was at the beginning of everything last year (inaudible 0:46:01.0) -- 
 
AG:  -- oh no.  I’m sorry. 
 
RG:  -- stuff like that is -- you never take that, I guess, for granted people are gonna be here, but 
even in a pandemic, I never thought I would lose somebody close to me or anything, and just 
fussing at my dad like “stay at home”.  I used to tell my dad “I can technically from here get 
groceries delivered to y’all.  Y’all don’t have to leave the house”.  Even stuff like that, but he 
won’t listen, but I think that’s probably -- I think even from a nursing perspective being able to 
have contact with patients like physical contact. As a nurse, you know, in nursing school you’re 
taught the importance of physical contact.  Holding somebody’s hand when they’re dying or 
something like that, and there’s so much -- even with the social distance you can’t, you know, 
with gloves and things like, but even when you’re just in a hallway sometimes you would touch a 
patient or whatever, and with the social distance it’s like they really don’t encourage of course 
any of that. 
 
AG:  Absolutely. 
 
RG:  And the impact that could potentially have on patients as well. 
 
AG:  Right.  Psychologically their wellbeing, their -- 
 
RG:  -- and family members.  I think that’s been the big thing even when I talk to people who say 
-- especially in the beginning when people saying it was a hoax, and all of that.  You know, a lot 
of nurses would say “I wish y’all could come in”, and that’s part of the issue is people can’t see 
it.  You can’t believe sometimes what you can’t see.  While I would support people with some 
things, I’m like probably if I wasn’t in health care, I might be like “oh this is a hoax”.  Maybe I 
would.  I don’t know.  But being here, seeing the numbers, seeing the precautions we have to do 
the changes to the system.  You start seeing the dots on the floor, and for the veterans I think for 
some of them, and I’ve had a veteran tell me this, the process to get in the VA, and it’s not the 
VA ‘cause it’s every facility, every hospital, but when you go to a facility they have come in the 
door saying “I feel like I’m enlisting again”.  ‘Cause they have to get in a line, and you have to 
check with this person, and check with -- they kinda feel like they’re coming into -- and I had 
one of my friends who’s a veteran, and she told me she’s not coming back until the pandemic is 
over.   
 
AG:  Wow.  Yeah.  I’m sure that’s difficult to manage.  You know, I realized earlier I meant to 
ask more about your doctorate. 
 
RG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
2020012 
 
 
 
Nursing America's Veterans 
18 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
[48:45] AG:  And then we moved on.  I know we’re going backward in time now, but when did 
you get your doctorate?  That was in New Orleans correct?  At Loyola? 
 
RG:  It was in New Orleans, but I lived in Houston so it was an on-line program.  I did have to 
go to New Orleans a couple of times (inaudible 0:48:59.8) defend, but it was -- I finished 
officially in 2015. 
 
AG:  Is the doctorate in nursing? 
 
RG:  It’s not a PhD.  So in nursing we have a Doctorate of Nursing Practice so it’s called a DNP, 
and my specialty or area was Executive Leadership. 
 
AG:  Oh terrific.  Did you end up changing jobs as a result of the doctorate or might you in the 
future or was it just enhancing you’re (inaudible 0:49:29.6)? 
 
RG: So I changed jobs during my program which the school actually highly discouraged.  To 
quote one of my professors at the time, she said “the reason we discourage it is because the devil 
you know is better than the one you don’t”.  Of course when you change jobs, and you get a job 
everybody’s nice, and everything seems to be hunky dory, and then when you get somewhere it’s 
a mess.  I didn’t have that experience.  It was helpful because the person I was working with 
worked in a department [00:50:00], but when I started I was working nights.  It was fine because 
with the online program we didn’t have to log in certain days or times so that was okay.  Well in 
the beginning, but when I got to a later class we did have to log in at certain times.  So it wasn’t 
bad, and the transition wasn’t that bad.  It was more busy I guess or hectic for me I guess with 
the change because I went to a new position, and I had to learn this position plus all the reading, 
research with the doctorate. 
 
AG:  Did you write a dissertation for the doctorate as well? 
 
RG:  Yes. 
 
AG:  What was the topic?  What was that about? 
 
RG:  It was on, because I do have a passion for orientation, it was actually about implementing a 
unit based phase orientation program for new graduates.  One of the things I saw in nursing, and 
even from my own experience, one of the things you hear in nursing, I don’t know if you’ve 
heard it already, is that nurses eat their young.  You can probably Google it or something, and 
find some stuff, but it’s always been a saying that nurses eat their young.  What that means is 
sometimes as experienced nurses when new nurses come in, we just throw ‘em to the wolves, 
and kinda let them (inaudible 0:51:26.4), and then criticize them for not knowing something 
when it’s your job as the experienced person to orient and precept them.  What I did is designed 
a phased unit based orientation.  I kinda talked to you about the 12 weeks so during the literature 
we identified that the suggested time frame is a 12 week orientation.  What I did was design for 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
2020012 
 
 
 
Nursing America's Veterans 
19 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
each week this is what this person should be doing to have more structure to the orientation, and 
have goals for every week of the orientation which included meeting with the manager, educator 
and preceptor to design or see how they’re progressing during orientation.  It did allow for 
flexibility so if you felt it needed to be longer or it could be shorter, but the chief nurse at the 
time really wanted us to stick with 12 weeks for orientation so that’s what that was about.  
Implementing that. 
 
[52:40] AG:  Oh terrific.  That’s so interesting.  We’re just about wrapping up, but I wonder if I 
could ask you a couple like reflecting back on your career questions, that kind of thing?  I guess 
the one I’m so curious about is having worked in the private sector and for the VA, how do you 
compare them or what’s different about them or better and worse? 
 
RG:  It’s night and day.  It’s funny because I usually can spot somebody who’s never worked 
outside the VA, and it’s usually when they come with certain questions or they feel this is how 
things should be done, and I’m like “you’ve never worked anywhere else have you?”  They’ll be 
like “no.  How do you know?”  I said “because if you’ve worked private sector, you would know 
this is not the only way to do things”.  Actually when we have people who come into orientation 
I always tell them the VA is a very different place, and I said I’m not saying it’s good or bad.  
It’s just different.  So when people come in, if they worked private sector 20 years or 10 years, 
and they come into the VA it’s very different.  I always tell people “don’t up and quit.  You have 
to give yourself one year, one full year to adjust”.  I say “you need to read policies for yourself.  
You need to understand things are different here”.  One of the big things is we have a Union 
whereas private sector, a lot of places don’t have Unions so a lot of times people feel that when 
somebody does something they should be fired on the spot.  That’s not how it works in the VA 
system.  I tell people all the time “you’re gonna get frustrated ‘cause you feel this person should 
be fired”.  I mean it doesn’t mean they killed somebody, but you just feel this is not the way we 
should operate, and I said “they probably agree with you, but there’s still a process to how things 
work”.  To me, that would be the biggest thing is accountability.  It’s not consistent.  So because 
of the way processes work at the VA, a leader has to be consistent in how they reprimand or 
write up people ‘cause if you’re not consistent the Union will say “well you didn’t follow the 
process”.  Then you have to start the process all over, and then when a new leader comes it’s a 
new process.  Texas is an “at will” state.  You can be fired at will in the private sector, but the 
VA is federal so it’s different rules.  [00:55:00] The other thing that’s a big -- and I will say this 
is a hindrance, and I probably will get in trouble, but its facts.  The biggest thing is when we 
need something it literally, it literally, and I tell people this all the time, literally takes a act of 
Congress because Congress approves our budge.  There are some things we can do, but if we 
need more space like we need at our facility it literally takes a act of Congress ‘cause Congress 
has to act.  If we need budget money -- and the VA doesn’t necessarily suffer budgetary I think, 
it’s how the money is allotted sometimes, and if it’s on a certain line item you can’t move it to 
this area.  I think that’s a issue, and most people who work in the VA don’t know that.  I actually 
was in the Leadership Development Program at the VA, and that’s one of the good things about 
the VA.  They have lots of Leadership Development for whatever level.  If you have a high 
school diploma, there’s a leadership program for you.  You want to move up, there’s a leadership

program.  I was in, it’s called LDI, the Leadership Development Institute, and it’s for people who 
want to move into leadership.  It was there then when we had some of the meetings with 
leadership that I learned some stuff.  Now when people come frustrated, I’m like “are you aware 
this is how this works?”  You can’t really be mad at your leadership when they don’t make that 
decision.  Sometimes we can get mad at the medical center director, but he doesn’t have the 
power to do anything.  Congress needs to do stuff.  So I’ll tell people sometimes “right your 
Congressman” ‘cause literally that’s what you need to do. 
 
AG:  Right.  Exactly.  How have you seen the VA change over the course of your time there, if 
you have? 
 
RG:  I haven’t seen it change much.  Well let me say this.  I guess it has changed.  I’ve seen, and 
I guess I’m coming from different VA’s ‘cause I’ve worked in two different VA’s -- maybe it 
hasn’t changed that much.  Well maybe it has.  I guess the change would be more you’re seeing 
more patients so you see the expansion of services.  It doesn’t directly impact me necessarily, but 
it impacts the veteran.  I know currently at the VA I work in there’s more clinics that have 
opened up so they don’t -- ‘cause Houston is a huge area, and in some instances people were 
traveling 100 miles to come to the VA for appointments so expanding services beyond primary 
care closer to where the veterans live.  I know this year they just opened another -- we call them 
CBOC, but it’s Community Based Outpatient Clinics so that’s where they can go get their 
primary care appointments.  They’ve expanded services in those areas for lab draw, some x-ray, 
mental health services so I think that’s a benefit, and a change that helps the veterans.  I know for 
our area, we’re up to 11 I think CBOC, and probably could do five more.  I personally told our 
director we need another hospital. 
 
AG:  Yeah it’s such a big area. 
 
RG:  (Inaudible 0:58:27.6) and justify it. 
 
AG:  Mm-hmm. 
 
RG:  Because we service a lot of veterans, and I tell people all the time we don’t even have every 
veteran enrolled who could be.  Some of them chose not to come because the distance that it 
would take for them.  Some people don’t want to sit in traffic, and Houston traffic is really bad 
so I get that.   
 
[58:55] AG:  Are there any services that you think could be provided or improved for veterans? 
 
RG:  Just because of the nature -- I’m not going to say I think it could be improved because I 
don’t receive the services to be able to really say that there needs to be improvement.  I would 
say, and I know they’re working on it, but it’s also based on demand.  I think eventually we will 
provide more obstetric services as you start seeing more women so I -- and that’s another way I 
have seen the VA expand as far as women services.  They now have their own clinic.  They can

provide, (inaudible 00:59:40.3) at our facility, mammograms there so we don’t have to outsource 
that.  They still outsource it if we can’t get people in enough time so I do think those services are 
expanding, and they should.  But also I think women veterans have to feel comfortable coming to 
the VA so that’s one of the things [1:00:00] the VA did do, that our area did assist with is doing 
national -- well I mean, not national, hospital wide sexual harassment training, and educating 
staff about how women veterans feel when they come to the VA because military has been, for 
men, some things and comments that are made makes some female veterans feel unsafe.  
Especially if they feel (inaudible 1:00:34.0) we call it sexual assault in the military.  They have 
traumas associated with that so just coming in the building can be a trigger for them, and we’ve 
been taught to observe woman who stand in a corner ‘cause they don’t want to sit next to a man 
or something to make them feel more comfortable, bring them back or sit them somewhere, but 
just making it more comfortable.  Now we have a women’s health clinic where they can enter 
from the outside.  If they chose to come in the building they can, but they have two ways.  So 
doing designs and things like that to be more intentional, and there’s a women’s health 
committee that specifically addresses women’s health issues. We have a LGBTQ committee as 
well. 
 
AG:  Well that’s excellent.  This is the last question.  What do you see as your role in providing 
patient care or advocacy, that kind of thing? 
 
RG:  So one of the things I would like to do, I don’t mind what I’m doing now, education, but if 
I wanted to do something else for me it would be more of implementing programs that impact 
the outcomes.  That’s kind of -- even in my DNP that’s kind of the purpose of a DNP that’s 
different from a PhD in Nursing so, of course you know PhD’s do research, and one of the things 
in health care is there’s always a delay of the research to hitting the bedside.  So that’s supposed 
to be the role of the DNP is to get the research and implement changes that this research says.  
So PhD’s will do the research, but we need people who are gonna implement those changes in 
the health care system.  So that’s kinda what I would like to do, get more involved with 
implementing new programs to impact the outcomes that improve patient care. 
 
AG:  Absolutely.  That’s excellent.  Is there anything you’d like to add before we conclude? 
 
RG:  No.  I think this has been good, but I’m excited they’re doing this and -- 
 
AG:  -- yeah -- 
 
RG:  -- hope it’s successful. 
 
AG:  Me too.  Thank you so much for your time.  This is wonderful.
