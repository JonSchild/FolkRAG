appropriateness of a group,  t
he quality of a group, consideration of t
he k
ind
 
of performance offered by a group, or any of t
he other critical  considerations
 
one would ordinarily review before contracting for a performance.  To be sure.
 
African-American gospel groups -- I mean `gospel'  to refer to African-American
 
religious and sacred, h
istoric, modern, and contemporary musics --  are
 
available everywhere, and because of t
he s
incerity (or professionalism) of
 
such groups, audiences are rarely d
isappointed.  And t
he `
traditionality" of
 
such groups i
s rarely a consideration for most sponsors and promoters.
 I
t i
s 
i
s a consideration for NEA/Folk Arts, and because d
istinctions are made by
 
African-American church groups and other African-American performers of
 
African-American religious and sacred music a
lso. we can presume t
he
 
d
istinctions are valuable for African-Americans as well.
 
I
n short.  I sure do w
ish we could somehow assist promoters and
 
sponsors i
n understanding and d
istinguishing forms of African-American gospel,
 
and providing some sort of articulated performance environment for performers
 
(
if only i
n brief and concise program notes) so t
hat t
he casual  audience
 
member has a sense of a much larger h
istoric context and continuum for t
he
 
witnessed performance. And I t
hink t
hat a
lso means encouraging performers to
 
efficiently i
ntegrate "
teachino"  i
nto t
he performance where t
he sponsor fails
 
to do so, or to augment t
he sponsor's knowledge.
 I a
lso w
ish we could
 
encourage promoters and sponsors to explore other forms of African-American
 
peformance, where t
he  i
nterest  i
n t
he Culture  i
s genuine and t
he performing
 
venue more secular t
han religious.
 
So t
his i
s a
ll  to say t
hat my sense of what I should look for as an
 
NEA/FAP auditor  i
s sharpening.
 
The Audit:
  
I
n spite of t
he enthusiastic support of Roby Cogswell,
 
t
he Tennessee
 
Arts Commission's D
i rec
tor  of Fo
lk  Arts,
 and  h
is  reassurances,  I was deeply
 
t
roubled by Doug Seroff's enormously cautious and guarded response to my
 
t
elephone  i
ntroduction p
laced several weeks prior to t
he audit.
 I had
 
encountered s
imilar responses from non -African-American promoters of Chicago
 
b
luesmen during my Smithsonian FAF staff days, and I d
id not relish a repeat
 
of t
he harsh and draining association with arrogant white promoters of
 
African-American music.
 
The f
lip s
ide of t
he coin (a half-hearted apology for t
he c
liche)
 
offered another, competing realization.
 I could not deny t
hat Anolo promoters
 
of African-American music and musicians were frequently deeply carino
_ and
 
h
ighly knowledgeable about t
he form of t
he music and t
he b
iooraphies of t
he
 
musicians,  i
f  i
nsufferably overbearing a
t t
imes.
 Seroff's written work was
 
marvelous, deathless, dynamic, careful, sensitive, and knowino.
 .
.When I
 
f
inally met Doug Seroff,  I was relieved to l
earn t
hat he  i
s genuinely shy,
 
very warm, and well  respected and loved by t
he musicians w
ith whom he seemed
 
to enjoy working.
 
The conceptualization and organization of Nashville's Gospel Arts Day
 
reflected Seroff's selflessness, h
is solid knowledge of African-American
 
relgious music, and h
is deep caring for Nashville's substantial contribution
 
to h
istoric and modern B
lack sacred music. A t
heme event,  t
he 1988 Gospel Arts
 
Day celebrated and honored t
he long and i
nfluential  career of t
he Fairfield
 
Four, organized i
n t
he Sunday school  of Nashville's Fairfield Baptist Church

Folk Arts Program
 
DC Cor =ission on the Arts
 
Washington, DC
 
May 15-16, 1990
 
Evaluator: Howard L
. Sacks
 
Introduction 
My visit was designed to provide NEA with a clear picture of the organization
 
and program initiatives of the DC folk arts program.
 Toward that end I met
 
extensively with progran coordinator Michael Licht;  talked with DCA deputy
 
director Pamela Holt and staff member Jann Diener; had a conference -call
 
meeting with Susan Levitas, who administers the apprenticeship program; and
 
observed Michael's meeting with members of the Gospel Artists Coalition at a
 
rehearsal of the Southern Gospel Singers.
 I was unable to meet DCA director
 
Barbara Nicholson, who was called out of town on a family emergency.
 
Context
  
The folk arts program at the DC cormisS.ion on the Arts (
DCA) serves the
 
District of Columbia in a manner formally analogous to state folk arts programs
 
nationwide, but the program reflects the unique nature of the urb
.Rn environment
 
i
t serves.  The District of Columbia e
ricornpasses sixty square miles and is hone
 
to 600,000 people.
 This urban core l
ies at the center of a metropolitan area
 
of 4
,000,000 residents, many of whom commute daily to work from neighboring
 
Virginia and Maryland.
 An additional 2
,000,000 tourists arrive annually to
 
visit the Federal City.
 These three populations coexist in relative isolation
 
from one another--their neighborhoods are spatially segregated,  they are served
 
by different businesses and agencies, and each distinct government has its own
 
tax base.  The divisions of the city, moreover, are drawn sharply along racial
 
and class .
l
ines.
 
The folk arts program i
s shaped by the de nsity of the local population.
 
Because the area .
i
s compact,  i
t is possible for Mike to have more intensive
 
contact
. with the f
ield than do state folklorists whose purview embraces a large
 
geographic region.
 As Mike puts i
t,  '
'The f
ield is here."  Mike's proximity to
 
his constituents also enhances his accountability to them.
 A local phone call
 
i
s all that i
s required for someone to lodge a complaint, present a problem, or
 
suggest an i
dea to Mike; and because so many local residents know him,  they are
 
not inhibited from doing so.
 The effect of density is evident throughout the
 
DCA.  Mike's responsibilities on the day of my visit included f
inal
 
organization of a gallery show by applicarits to the visual arts program;
 
because artists are c
lose at hand, panelists can view actual works of art
 
instead of relying on s
lides!
 
The political boundaries of the c

with District of Columbia residents,  the majority of whom are African-
Americans.
 Other groups working in the city with vital folk arts--such as
 
recently arrived Asians--are excluded from prcxlram .

The population DC folk arts does serve is largely removed from the

programs are directed primarily toward tourists and the class of professionals
 
who ;
Murk but do r
iot l
ive in the city.  Folk arts included in the programming of
 
these institutions are typically imported from the outside, a situation Mike
 
refers to as the "hanetown disadvantage.
 For example, the Kennedy Center
 
chose to include a California gospel group in one recent program, ignoring the
 
eighty such groups i
n Washington.  The American Folklife Center, Smithsonian's
 
Folklife Program, NCTA, NEA, and local university folklore programs are
 
similarly outward looking,  Their efforts may occasionally include local
 
artists, but the activities are inorganically related to the local folk
 
conrruiities and therefore irrelevant to them.  Mike's program has a unique
 
ccr =itment to and relationship with the local folk.
 
Philosophy 
DCA has a strong commitment to serving the culturally diverse population of the
 
District.  Upon analyzing i
ts applicant pool and grant recipients in the early
 
1
980s, DCA concluded that i
ts programs were not effectively reaching artists of
 
color, and it initiated a grassroots community effort in the District.  The
 
bureaucratic structure of DCA and i
ts professional staff--used to serving
 
established professional arts organizations--were i
ll equipped to work
 
effectively with more t
raditionally organized communities.  Mike was hired, in
 
effect, to serve as a l
iaison between DCA and local communities--as he puts it,
 
"
I'm the cultural diversity g
',y
,'
 
In his term at DCA, Mike has pointed out problems of cultural parochialism
 
to the staff, contributing to a growing sensitivity to issues of cultural
 
diversity throughout DCA.  Mike's status as the lone white male among a staff
 
of
. Africari-American women seem
.-
, to have been a source of some tension early on,
 
but I gather that these problems have g
iven way to mutual trust,
 I
t may be
 
ironic that a white male f
inds himself i
n the position of prcmoting cultural
 
diversity i
n a staff in which women of color predominate, but the situation
 
seems ultimately to have worked out well for everyone.  Generally, the DCA
 
staff seem to be supportive of Mike's initiatives in this regard.
 
Frcm the beginning DCA has been committed to mainstreaming the folk arts
 
through i
ts general programs, rather than segregating them in a separate panel
 
process.  Much of M
ike's efforts have been devoted to helping folk artists
 
compete auccessfu.l.ly in a panel process designed primarily for the f
ine arts.
 
Mike identifies grassroots organizations that might apply for funds
 
(
individuals cannot apply directly to DCA) ,
 helps them gain 501C(3) status, and
 
works with them to develop competitive applications.  Mike prepares staff to
 
deal with prospective applicants and provides outside evaluators when panels
 
lack the expertise to review folk art applications.  Mike's technical
 
assistance continues after a successful panel review; meeting with the Gospel
 
Artists Coalition, Mike spent considerable t
ime explaining what forms had to be
 
f
illed out in order for the group to receive the funds granted to them.
 
In the opinion of Mike and the other staff I met at DCA, mainstreaming is
 
beginning to pay off.  Many folk arts applicants receive grants, particularly
 
those with whom Mike works directly.  Panel members are slowly becoming
 
familiar with f
olk artists and their art forms and are increasingly willing to
 
seek the advice o
f outside experts in arts with which they are unfamiliar.
 
Indccd,  the written guidelines encourage panelists to request outside expertise
 
in advance of meetirigs f
or any application the feel i
ll equipped to evaluate.
 
In Mike's view .
i
t will t
ake another two years for mainstreaming to be truly
 
effective, and Pamela Holt expressed the hope that as panelists become more
 
familiar with local f
olk arts they will need to rely less on outsiders.
 But

unlike other arts councils which have rejected separate folk arts programs
 
(
Pennsylvania comes to mind), DCA seems t
o have a sincere commitment to making
 
the process work.
 
Although the projects resulting from these efforts do receive some
 
attention in the _
Washington Post and other media which serve the Federal City,
 
DCA gauges the success of these projects primarily by the impact they have
 
within the neighborhoods themselves.  M
.
ike i
s particularly interested in
 
enhancing the process through which oxrmrunities sustain their own arts.  DCA
 
supports Mike's emphasis on process over product and does not push the folk
 
arts program to develop h
igh-visibility projects (
in Mike's words,  "dog and
 
pony shows") to enhance the institution's public profile.
 
Projects 
All of Mike's efforts are rooted in intensive f
ieldwork within the local
 
co
rrminity.  The density and small s
ize of the D
istrict certainly facilitate his
 
efforts, but the centrality of f
ieldwork i
s also a function of Mike's approach
 
to his work.  Through f
ieldwork M
ike accoirrplishes "needs and resource
 
assessment"--locating artists and grassroots organizations which support the
 
arts a
nd identifying t
he needs and i
nterests of the local communities.  Given
 
the difficulties many f
olk arts coordinators express about getting out of the
 
office and into the f
ield, Mike's efforts in this regard are notable.  Over
 
t
ime t
ie has persuaded DCA of the importance of f
ieldwork, and they seem willing
 
to allow him considerable latitude in the t
ime t
ie spends in the office.  He now
 
has a beeper to enable the DCA staff to contact him when he i
s out of the
 
office.  But Mike's f
ieldwork also demands a great deal of after-hours labor,
 
particularly since most of the people he serves work during the day.
 
The projects Mike works on are largely community initiated.  As people
 
beccme familiar with Mike and what he does, they tell him things they would
 
l
ike to do.  A gospel organization wants to put on a series of gospel music
 
programs in housing projects, a popular go-go band wants to run a series of
 
workshops to help corm
=ity youths start bands in their own neighborhoods, a
 
quilt group wants to make quilts for the homeless (
one panelist initially
 
responded t
o this i
dea by exclaiming,  "
But they'll get the quilts all
 
dirty!").  These projects cone "
from the bottom up" and thus reflect the
 
contemporary urban f
olk experience more directly than many projects we see at
 
NEA which belie an antiquarian approach to folk arts.
 
Gospel Project.  Gospel music groups are active--both in and out of church
 
--throughout the c
ity's African-American neighborhoods, but cormanit.ies have
 
been largely u
riaware of the great number of groups throughout the city.
 
Through extensive f
ieldwork Mike i
dentified over forty groups and then produced
 
fans for use in churches which i
ncluded the names of all of the groups and
 
information on his program at DCA.
 The fans stimulated community members to
 
tell Mike about other groups, and the f
ollowing year a second fan was produced
 
with eighty groups.
 U
ltimately Mike produced a gospel directory with
 
interpretive material on the t
radition.  By calling attention to the strength
 
of this tradition in general, Mike raised community pride about the art form.
 
By l
isting all the groups, rather than selecting a f
ew for special performance,
 
Mike avoided creating intergroup animosity.  The directory has served as a
 
resource, as well,  for people interested in h
iring gospel artists.
 
Go-Go Project.  Go-go i
s a vernacular once music unique to Washington,
 
D
.C., a nonstop youth party music punctuated by  rapping and ongoing dialogue
 
between the dance f
loor and the band.  The music emerged at dance parties in
 
various rorununity centers, and i
t has recently gained national attention in the
 
4
 
pop music world.  For DC young people, go-go is an important vehicle for
 
artistic expression and a major opportunity for social exchange•

the go-go f
lier also includes the names of the many bands in the District.
 
Apprenticeships.
 In the course of f
ieldwork Mike has 
ei
idd
e
en
rt
tif
fied a number
 
of master artists who want to teach their art to yon e
 
with others in
 
of the
 
community.
 In some cases , these
 artists
 are  already
 working
 
their locale;  in other instances, M
ike has :
i
dentified potential apprentices.
 
Unlike most apprenticesht
ip programs which involve an application and panel
 
review, the apprenticeships supported by DC folk arts are initiated and
 
negotiated by Mike.
 The approach protects the process from problemscI have
 by
 
witnessed in other programs--artists who are pressured  into apprenti ces
hips
 
a
ipprentices with whom they do not wish to work, and artists who select  
nap pro priate apprentices simply to get mone
y from
 the  program.
 
Susan Levitas,
 
wham Mike contracted to oversee the administrative aspects of the  -
 
says that Mike "shows creativity in  defining
 appropriate
 
apprenticeships , 
 
a pp renticeships," pai ning people who show some organ
ic relationship to each
 
other instead of randomly connecting people simply on the basis of shared
 
ethnicity.
 Apprenticeships thus serve as an additional tool which Mike uses to
 
suuport the folk arts when appropriate.
 I
t is unlike other state programs
 
which seek out applicants for periodic grants on a regular basis.
 
Mike i
s supported in his selection and development of apprenticeships by
 
expert consultants.
 Mike's decision to use local experts over professional
 
academics whenever possible is guided by his general desire to recognize and
 
empower people who play a -
significant role in the artistic life of  the  
community.
 In addition to evaluatin
g the  appropriateness
 of  a pa  
l
 
pairing,  these consultants meet witrl the participants at the outset to help
 
define apprenticeship objectives and develop a working relationship between
 
master and student.
 At the end of the apprenticeship, the consultant meets
 
again to conduct a taped interview with the paxticipants for evaluation and
 
documentation purposes.

As  the  host ag 
ency
 
meeting of the National Association of State Arts Agencies, DCA wanted to

 of  
in troduce conference participants to Washington
  
the museums of the Federal City.
 Mike organized a tour of f
ive stops in
 
various District localities, each featuring ethnic food, music, and dance.
 The
 
tour was "
the talk of the conference" and provided the establishments with
 
A 
5
 
positive media attention and subsequent business as conference participants
 
returned to these spots with f
riends who had not gone on the tour.
 
Problems and Prospects
 
Mike's emphasis on f
ieldwork is the driving force behing the program, but it
 
also presents considerable difficulties.
 To date, the vast majority of
 
f
iledwork has been conducted personally by Mike, providing him with intimate
 
f
amiliarity of the locale.
 But i
t i
s i
mpossible for Mike to conduct thorough
 
f
iledwvrk throughout all of the D
istrict's communities single-handed.  His
 
efforts to hire f
ieldworkers on a contract basis have met with l
ittle success.
 
The difficulties arise in part due to the apparent lack of emphasis on
 
f
ieldwork in graduate and undergraduate folklore programs in the area; as a
 
result, students have l
ittle training for or interest in the opportunities Mike
 
has to offer.
 
Mike's f
ieldwork and folk art projects must compete with other
 
responsibilities demanded of Mike at DCA.  Mike has served as coordinator of
 
the festivals program and the special constituencies program, both of which
 
deal with arts and organizations l
argely unrelated to the folk arts.  He also
 
coordinates the applicant show, in which visual artists and craftspersons
 
display their art In advance of the panel meeting.  These duties take t
ime away
 
from Mike's folk arts activities.  But in an agency committed to mainstreaming
 
f
olk arts,  these other duties a
lso "mainstream" Mike throughout the
 
i
nstitution,
 I suspect that these other responsibilities help integrate and
 
l
egitimate Mike generally at DCA, avoiding h
is own segregation as the guy who
 
deals with folk art.
 
Mike can employ assistants on a contract basis, as he has done with Susan
 
Levitas and others in the past.  But because these assistants are on the DCA
 
payroll, they are often pulled off the work for which they were hired to work
 
on other projects.  Mike has f
ound a solution to this problem by havirig
 
assistants work outside the office, making them less susceptible to cooptation
 
by other DCA staff.
 
Mike's projects are hampered, too, by bureaucratic and technical problems
 
at DCA.  As a funding agency, DCA i
s not organized to initiate projects on its
 
own.
 I
t is d
ifficult for Mike to procure outside f
lui
ds or spend them on
 
projects; as a result he has contracted the National Council for the
 
Traditional Arts (
NCTA) to act as h
is f
iscal agent.  He is also trying to
 
establish a "Friends of DC Folk Arts" group which will be free to raise outside
 
f
unds f
or projects not directly funded by DCA.  Whatever the successes of
 
mainstreaming, Mike i
s still f
earful of the perception t
hat his projects are
 
taking money away frcun the f
ine arts."  Mike needs a desktop computer to
 
compile his extensive f
ieldwork materials,  including the photographic materials
 
being collected f
or t
he Secret City projc
�(-
_t.
 
Mike has a number of projects in mind for the immediate future, some of
 
which are already underway.
 The Secret C
ity project, funded by NEA, appears to
 
be on hold.
 In part this i
s due to problems with outside contractors, but i
t
 
also reflects Mike's assessment that the District's b
icentennial celebration--
with which the exhibits were to coincide--has i
tself faltered.  Also on hold is
 
a project dealing with vernacular neighborhood names.  Official maps fail to
 
acknowledge the existence of many of the c
ity's distinct neighborhoods, but
 
community people use a nwnber of vernacular names to define the cultural
 
l
andscape.  Mike has collected material on these names in anticipation of
 
developing a distinctive L
7iltural map---one which excludes the Federal City
 
u
 
6
 
locations that predominate in other maps of the District.  The project now
 
awaits design of the map and an appropriate funding source for i
ts production.
 
An ethnic music directory, similar to that completed for gospel groups,  is
 
slated for completion this f
all.  Much of the work for this project has been
 
subcontracted to outside individuals.  Currently in the planning stage is a
 
year-long series of three-minute radio spots on different aspects of folk
 
culture in the District,  for airplay on the local all-news station and NPR
 
affiliate.
 
Conclusion 
Reflecting on his work and public sector folklore in general, Mike views the
 
District as a laboratory for new approachc, to the support of folk arts.  He is
 
critical of the formulaic, project-oriented, top-dawn approach which in his
 
view characterizes much of the work in our f
ield.  State folk arts programs
 
increasingly rely on a stock of projects--festivals, apprenticeship panels,
 
artists in the schools programs, radio series--that are applied in state after
 
state, with l
ittle consideration of the unique needs of the communities being
 
served.  Mike's approach i
n the D
istrict raises an important question for us to
 
ponder:  Are state f
olk arts programs, designed originally to be in the f
ield
 
and thus closer to folk communities, as re
sponsive to the groups they serve as
 
we would l
ike to think they are?
 
To some degree the DC folk arts program i
s invisible to NEA Folk Arts
 
because it expects certain kinds of projects to emanate from the states.  A
 
federal folk arts network that generally ignores local arts does not see the
 
posters for the go-go hot l
ine throughout the c
ity,  is unaware that the fans
 
l
isting the many gospel groups in the c
ity remain for weekly use in area
 
churches, and does not read the interpretive materials developed by Mike for
 
groups to use .
in community presentations.  Much of his labor---the grassroots
 
technical assistance he gives to community groups, the many referrals he makes
 
to connect artists with presenters--has no visible product which can be easily
 
evaluated by an outside agency.
 
From my brief visit in DC, I am impressed that Mike's program does work in
 
the District.  He seems to be intimately familiar with the folk arts in his
 
region and with the community context in which the arts function.
 If the warm
 
reception we received at our visit to the Southern Gospel Quartet rehearsal is
 
any indication, Mike has succeeded in integrating himself and his program into
 
the local community.  They benefit from his expertise and consider him a
 
partner who suppor t; t
heir efforts.  Mike i
s very careful not to impose his own
 
ideas on the groups with which he works.
 In talking to the members of the
 
Gospel Artists Coalition,  for example, Mike was careful to explain the
 
rationale behind his suggestions, after which he actively solicited their own
 
opinions.  Likewise, in preparing interpretive material on a musical group or
 
genre for publication, Mike calls the relevant parties and reads the copy for
 
their suggestions and approval.
 
Less clear is that such a grassroots approach could work elsewhere. Mike's
 
successes owe much to the density and s
ize of h
is territory; the intimacy he
 
has achieved with his constituents would be hard to replicate in most states.
 
The approach relies as well on Mike's dedication to work.  Mike i
s available
 
day and night--he told one member of the Gospel Artists Coalition to call him
 
at hone any t
ime before midnight.  Local artists and organizations have Mike's
 
beeper number in addition to DCA staff.
 Few of us would willingly be so
 
accessible.
 
of

Although laudable, Mike's devotion to f
ieldwork and grassroots community
 
dynamics also has i
ts drawbacks.  Because Mike i
s more interested in the
 
f
ieldwork process than the product,  I suspect he devotes less energy to the
 
completion of products than i
s sometimes required.  More generally, the DC folk
 
arts program i
s highly dependent on Mike's own personal initiatives and
 
contacts,  When he l
eaves the past,  there will be .
l
ittle that is
 
institutionally in p
lace to perpetuate the office.  But Mike's work to date
 
certainly justifies continued NEA support, both for its local accomplishments
 
and larger implications for public sector efforts nationwide.

�DOwiiENT FOR THE ANTS SITE- REPORT -
The Georgia S
ea Island Festival, August 15-1Z, 1986
 
Assessing the Georgia Sea Island Festival forces an evaluator to poise
 
folkloric d.t
flnitiors and presentational adequacy against community support
 
and social significance.  Cn one hand, the event can be criticized for a lack
 
of artistic consistency and a near-total absence of interpretation.  On the
 
other, it must be praised for the e
nthusiastic involvement of regional blacks
 
and the strong sense of commitment and pride evinced by this audience.  Blacks
 
in attendance view the Georgia gatherins as their festival, marking it as an
 
event whose importance crosses sectional boundaries t
o e
ncompass the entire
 
African-American community.  For this reason alone, the festival stands well
 
apart from other celebrations of traditional black culture.  And this reason
 
alone justifies efforts t
o insure the festival's continued survival.
 
My first impressions were not nearly so generous.  Upon arriving at the
 
festival site--a small, waterside park partially occupied by a miniature golf
 
course--I was struck by the apparently haphazard layout of demonstration canopies
 
and the spartan resources provided to exhibitors.  Bare tables, folding chairs
 
and signs identifying only artist and skill offered little testimony to ten
 
years of programming experience.  The stage activity seemed only to confirm
 
this p
icture of presentational indifference.  Artists moved on and off stage
 
with no regard for the printed scheduler some performed for ten minutes, others
 
held forth for forty-five (
though the proarram allotted each half-an-hour'
 
some received brief biowraphical introductions, others e
arned only vague re-
marks about the "bygone days."  Both logistically and interpretatively, the
 
event  appeared to be yet another well-meaning but amateurishly-produced local
 
estival.  Eight years of Endowment funding were nowhere in evidence.
 
Yet as the afternoon wore on, I began to sense a certain spirit that somehow
 
sa. S
ea Island Festival -  4
 
set this festival apart from its conventional counternarts.  Mack artists
 
nerformed with an ease and naturalness rare in festival settings, dissolving
 
the distance between them and their audience as they cajoled and invited
 
onlookers t
o join in the performance.  Audience members, in turn, treated
 
artists with a familiarity born of shared experience--singing, clapping, dancing
 
and calling out encouragement t
o those on stage.  The resultant rapport ex-
tended far beyond the co-performative norms that traditionally enliven African-
American artistry.  For this exchange grew out of a palpable sense of community
 
and j
oint purpose, a deep-seated spirit of celebration.  Black audience members
 
clearly viewed this as an event created by blacks and for blacks.  The atmo-
sphere smacked more of family reunion than of festival.
 
This is not to suggest that audience and artists were exclusively African-
American, for many whites both attended and performed.  Yet blacks clearly
 
held center stage.  Most white festival-goers appeared to be tourists vaca-
t
ioning in the region and catching a few hours of entertainment; others were
 
local residents or elderly folks bussed in from nearby homes.  In contrast,
 
many African-Americans journeyed to St. Simons Island specifically for the
 
festival.  Busloads of blacks arrived from Savannah, Atlanta and even Beaufort,
 
S
.C., with many making the trip on an annual basis.  At least one fellow I
 
met travels to the festival every year from New York City:  Lending even more
 
significance to these figures is the fact that none of these junkets are
 
solicited or arranged by festival organizers.  Indeed, e
ach bus's arrival came
 
as a welcome surprise to director Frankie Quimby, who eagerly dispatched
 
aides to determine from whence it came.  Though organized promotion was minimal,
 
African-American festival-goers trekked from far and wide as if attending a
 
yearly homecoming.
 
The observations in this report arise from two days
' attendance at the
 
sa. Sea Island Festival - 3
 V
SI
 
aeorgia festival, and from conversations w
ith Frankie Quimby, a number of
 
festival n
articipants and dozens of audience members.  Among that company,
 
festival-goers proved to be the event's most eloquent spokespeople.  After
 
Ms.  ;
uimbv announced my identity from the stage, I was virtually deluged with
 
fervid statements of support and earnest inquiries about ways of keeping the
 
festival afloat.  Audience members clearly rid not want the tenth festival
 
to be the last.
 
Artistic Rerresentation & Project Rationale
  
Every year, the Georgia Sea Island Festival is chided by Endowment
 
evaluators for qualitative inconsistency.  And every year slight changes are
 
made in the performer roster.  Yet the critiques continue, recurring with a
 
consistency that suggests a problem deeper than mere programming.  I suspect
 
that the real issues are ones of purpose and project rationale.  Is the festi-
val's intent to "preserve" folk culture through its presentation, as indicated
 
in the proposal narrative?  Is it t
o display the artistic traditions and life-
gays of "bygone days," as recurrently suggested from the stage?  Or is it to
 
celebrate vernacular expressions which evince a clear debt to the past, as
 
implied from the programming.  For folklorists, these ends appear quite distinct
 
and different.  Yet for the organizers of the Georgia festival, they seem
 
to blend together quite neatly.  Herein lies the trouble.
 
The confusion of purpose is particularly apparent in the musical realm,
 
where re-created, revived and current vernacular forms stand side-by-side on
 
stage.  Perhaps a brief description of Saturday afternoon's programming will
 
best illustrate this point.  Following presentations by a bluesman, four gospel
 
ensembles and a young storyteller, Doug and Frankie Quimby mounted the platform
 
to rerform an old sacred piece (
first sung in gullah and then "translated" into
 
standard English), a few worksongs (
clearly artifacts of a memory culture in
 
,a. Sea Island Festival v 4
�
 
which neither of the quimbys narticinated) and a children's game.  This brief
 
glimpse into the past led into a performance by the Washboard Band, a black
 
"lounge" ensemble who played swing and pop standards in a rather lackluster,
 
jazz-influenced style.  Drawing its name (and hence a claim to "traditionality"?)
 
from its inclusion of a rubboard,  this group normally performs at bars and
 
wedding receptions.  The only segue from the quimby's much older style was a
 
brief remark introducing the Washboard Band as a "jazz" ensemble.
 
Atlanta storyteller Cynthia Watts next took the stage, reciting a highly-
 
expurgated and equally disjointed version of "The Signifying Monkey."  She in
 
turn introduced the Sensational Tones, an excellent gospel quartet whose full-
bodied sound and dynamic style captured the essence of contemporary black sacred
 
expression.
 For a moment, it seemed as if the festival were back on its declared
 
track.  Then came Jeff Little, a young white pianist who pounded out familiar
 
rhythm-and-blues tunes and rockabilly classics.  Little, who hails from North
 
Carolina but now makes his living performing for resort audiences on Jeckyll
 
Island, was introduced only as one who plays tunes from "way back" (
i.e., the
 
1950s).  The age of his repertoire apparently sufficed to justify inclusion
 
in this celebration of coastal traditions.
 
What then are the standards for selection?  The festival's next ensemble,
 
the Country Gentlemen, only raised this question anew.
 Essentially a country-
western counterpart to the Washboard Band,  this all-guitar group performed
 
country and bluegrass standards in the leaden manner so common at Moose lodge
 
dances and rural beer joints.  Aside from the fancy picking of one elderly
 
guitarist,  the band rarely rose above musical mediocrity.  As purveyors of
 
vernacular expression,  they were perfectly appropriate; as exemplars of
 
artistic excellence, they were entirely out of place.

choices curious and at times ill-advised.  3ut audience members seemed to dis-
agree.  Blacks all around me openly admired Little's adroit p
iano playing, with
 
many
 
e
nthusiastically joining in his choruses to "Blueberry Hill."  When the
 
lead for the Country Gentlemen whipped out a fast fingerpicked verse of "Old
 
Joe Clark," an elderly black gentleman seemed to speak for the crowds as he
 
launched into a shuffle step in front of the stage.  And dozens of women re-
sponded when the Washboard Band's crooner offered some slyly sexual innuendoes.
 
Festival-goers clearly enjoyed the proceedings, and freely let that enjoyment
 
be known.  Director Frankie Quimby--herself a performer and one closely attuned
 
t
o audience feedback--responds to that response in choosing participants.  The
 
St. Simons audience, and her own experiences on the festival circuit, form the
 
basis for her selection rationale.
 
But Ms. Quimby is not a folklorist= nor  can she afford to emFioy a folk-
lorist on her staff.  So she keeps on producing festivals, and they continue
 
being criticized by scholars.  The solution to this futiley-circular equation
 
lies not in summarily terminating support, but rather in effecting some sort
 
of rapproachment, in bringing together festival planners and folklorists to
 
reach a common understanding and develop a mutually-satisfactory methodology.
 
This process need not remove any creative control from Ms. Juimby's hands.
 
It would, however, clear channels of communication and perhaps pave the way
 
for more consciously consistent programming.
 
in 1
986 , the Endowment moved towards this end by earmarking a portion of
 
the grant for fieldwork and specifying that funds be used for Local artists.
 
Festival organizers apparently heeded only the latter half of these stipulations # 
deleting all of 1985's out-of-state participants--North Carolina's blues con-
tingent of Hinton, Holeman and Holloway, Tennessee's old-time Frazier Moss
 
String Band and med-show revivalist Doc McConnell, New York storyteller Terry

Tlair and even South Carolina's R
ed Top Choir--from this year's event.  Also
 
withdrawn was a local country-and-western g
roup, who seem t
o have been replaced
 
by the aforementioned Country Gentlemen.  The only other new performers were
 
the Washboard Band and the Friendly Stars, a rather unexceptional gospel quartet.
 
The remaining ten acts all returned from last year's festival.
 
The same p
attern of repetition appeared even more clearly in the folk-
life demonstrations, where virtually every participant (
except perhaps one of
 
the three barbecue cooks) w
as a festival veteran.  As with musicians, some
 
exhibitors critiqued in last year's site report--particularly an arrowhead
 
maker and t
ie-dier--did not return.  Yet other equally questionable  artists
 
did reappear, including a team of young blacksmiths, a self-taught spinner,
 
and a crab-trap maker who learned her skill less than five years ago so that
 
she in turn could teach it to h
andicapped individuals at her place of employment.
 
(
She herself has never even used such a trap, though there are certainly scores
 
of fisherpeople along the Georgia coast who work them daily.)  At issue is not
 
the integrity of these artists; nor is it their appropriateness to the festival
 
(
for if the event's purpose is to celebrate historical lifeways, then their
 
presence is perfectly justifiable).  Rather, at issue is the wisdom of placing
 
these demonstrators alongside other, more clearly traditional artists without
 
any attempt to distinguish between the two groups.  In essence, the matter once
 
again reduces to questions of consistency and underlying purpose.
 
To meet its promise of presenting a broad and balanced spectrum of regional
 
artistry, the festival clearly needs to conduct more fieldwork.  I suspect that
 
perennially tight budgets have prohibited such efforts in the past, forcing
 
staff t
o redirect Endowment funds t
o honoraria, travel and production expenses.
 
That was certainly the case this year.  Yet the inevitable result has been reliance
 
on a select and unchanging coterie of artists who fail t
o accurately reflect
 
,
�a. 3ea island Festival
 
the diversity of traditional expression on the Georgia coast.
 
This imbalance is evident in every presentational realm.  African-American
 
music e
asily fares the best, with presentations by s
ix sacred e
nsembles (who
 
cover a commendably w
ide breadth of religious expression), a lone bluesman, the
 
Quimbys, and the dashboard Band.  Though the blues musician claims acquaintance
 
with other secular artists--including an e
lderly black banjo player and a host
 
of buckdancers--none have ever been c
ontacted by festival staff.  This pattern
 
of fieldwork demurral is even more evident among white musicians, where repre-
sentation is at best spare and spotty. That ubiquitous symbol of white string
 
music--the fiddle--is nowhere in evidence; nor is any h
int of balladry, old-
time music, early country or dancing.  Though Ms. Quimby recognizes the weak-
nesses of this -
-
ampling (
noting that its inclusion arises from her own commit-
ment to multi-racial programming), she hasn't yet been able to rectify it
 
through fieldwork.
 
The folklife demonstrations could equally bear expansion.  Though a wide
 
range of artistry is already apparent--with traditional exhibitors including
 
a soapmaker, quilter, coiled-basked maker, crochet artist, net knitter, "folk"
 
sculptor and a range of cooks (who really cook for concession sales rather
 
than demonstration purposes)--much more could be done to focus attention on
 
the region's uniquely coastal folkways.  Last year, Endowment evaluator John
 
Burrison suggested mooring a shrimp boat to the p
ier; I would further recommend
 
including other water-based demonstrations, ranging perhaps from fish fileting
 
to gig making to shellfish shucking.  Every festival c
an present a crocheter
 
and s
oapmaker; few can boast an e
el-pot creator.  Herein lies the p
otential of
 
fieldwork.
 
One of the more commendable features of festival programming was its
 
flexibility.  As mentioned earlier, staffpeople paid little heed to the printed
 
schedule.  While this certainly added a measure of confusion and perhaps
 
sa. Sea Island Festival -

shortchanged certain artists, it also allowed organizers to be more responsive
 
to audience tastes.  At the same t
ime, it permitted walk-on performances,
 
opening a space for a blues harmonica player who came up from the audience
 
and allowing time for an impromptu, on-stags "hambone" contest.  Few festival-
goers seemed disturbed by this disregard for the published timetable= indeed,
 
most w
ith whom I spoke affirmed that they bought the program book not for its
 
schedule but rather to support the event.  "
Besides," one p
icnicking audience
 
member told me, "we're all going to be here all day anyway.  We won't miss
 
anything."  Judging from the stability of the crowd, h
is words held true for
 
many*
 
Interpretive Efforts
  
One of the key problems facing the Georgia Sea Island Festival is the
 
near-total lack of folkloric interpretation.  Performers mounted the stage to
 
brief introductions by Frankie quimby, who imparted a few biographical details
 
and attempted to place each tradition in the context of the pest.  When addres-
sing black sacred expression, Ms. Quimby's remarks were fairly detailed,
 
linking the featured form with its religious counterparts and situating it with-
in the historical flow.  For the blues, "jazz," and white musics, however,
 
her comments referred only to their undefined "
old-time" character.  The sole
 
spoken thread weaving all the forms together was their alleged historicity.
 
The folklife demonstrations suffered even more from a lack of interpretive
 
mediation.  Removed from their natural contexts and situated in t
he spartan
 
surroundings of sideless c
anopies, exhibitors were expected to explain process
 
while verbally reconstituting their workaday surround.  A few suceeded, drawing
 
in onlookers by dint of ebullient personalities.  The majority, however, merely
 
sat and worked, offering information only in direct response to audience questions.

, 
Most festival-goers , in turn , paused only momentarily , perhaps forwarding a
 
single query before re-commencing their silent circuit of the tents.  The
 
demonstrations ' Lotential for enlightenment thus gave way to mere diversion
 
as onlookers w
alked while waiting for the music to begin anew.
 
Explanatory signboards , context-suggestive demonstration settings, and
 
perhaps interpretive aides assigned to each tent would transform the festival's
 
material culture component , giving it the power to both captivate and educate
 
onlookers.  Equally useful would be brief program guide essays setting the
 
featured traditions in their artistic occupational contexts and perhaps giving
 
brief biographical sketches of the participants.
 
Currently, the program book is of little value.  Peppered with misstatements
 
and rife with misspellings and typographical errors, this work is recycled--
errors and all--every year with only minor emendations.  Even the year-to-year
 
schedules are virtually identical , with new names simply fitted into the slots
 
vacated by non-returning artists : The guide offers brief sketches of three
 
p
articipants (two of which are allotted no more than four sentences), memorials
 
to songsters Bessie Jones and Mable Hillery, and short essays on Ossawba Island,
 
black and white traditional song, and cotton and rice culture in coastal Georgia.
 
Little attempt is made to relate there materials to the actual festival, resulting
 
in a program that is essentially superfluous . Yet with relevant essays, bio-
graphical portraits of p
articipants and a sharp editing job, this book could
 
serve as both useful guide and valuable pedagogical took . Again, the problem
 
boils down to lack of funds and shortage of expertise.
 
Festival Outreach
 
Last year's proposal blithely suggested that 55,000 people would benefit
 
from the festival . Though vastly inflated, this figure raises some interesting
 
questions about publicity efforts and audience growth.  I estimate that two to
 
ja. Sea Island Festival -
 ;
5

three thousand persons actually attended the two-day festival.  Audiences were
 
larger than last year, and they clearly began to tax the event's resources,
 
filling all available seating and--more importantly on a h
ot midsummer after-
noon--occupying every square i
nch of shade.  Yet festival "regulars" predict
 
that their numbers will continue to swell, growing each year "
as the word
 
gets out."  What makes this exransion so intriguing is that this "word" apparent-
ly relies almost entirely on oral circulation.
 
When I arrived on St. Simons Island, I stopped at a convenience store to
 
ask directions to the festival s
ite.  The white proprietor claimed no knowledge
 
of the event, though a black child who overheard my request quickly profferred
 
the information, adding that he and his p
arents would be attending later that
 
afternoon.  As I drove towards the waterfront, I s
aw no s
igns or notices an-
nouncing the festival.  Indeed, until I actually caught sight of the canopies,
 
I wasn't sure I had located the festival grounds.
 
Normally I would dismiss this experience as i
nconsequential.  Yet at the
 
festival I heard several s
imilar accounts, including one from an out-of-state
 
visitor who had called the local Chamber of Commerce two weeks earlier and been
 
told that they had no idea of the festival dates!  Somewhere along the line,
 
publicity efforts seem to have been sidetracked.  Yed audiences continue to
 
grow, testifying anew to the festival's remarkable drawing power among
 
regional blacks.
 
Conclusions 
Despite its manifold shortcomings, the Georgia Sea Island Festival re-
mains an event fraught w
ith folkloric, s
ocietal and symbolic s
ignificance.
 
Unlike most of its counterparts, this festival issues from the very community
 
it seeks to celebrate, building upon shared experience and common heritage
 
to create an e
difice of spirit and pride.  Blacks rightly claim it as their
 
$
�
7 
ja. Sea Island Festival`s
 
own; they back this affirmation with a sense of fierce commitment and deep
 
loyalty.
 S
t
ith such p
ower at its heart, the festival should be assured a long
 
future.
 
`
!et community spirit doesn't always translate i
nto dollars.  The Endowment
 
has provided the event's principal support for e
ight years.  Though matcned by
 
small contributions from local governmental agencies, in-kind donations and
 
concession revenues, federal moneys have long comprised the festival's core
 
operating budget.  Unfortunately, this protracted subsidy seems to have dis-
couraged exploration of other funding sources, yielding a dependence which
 
now threatens to prove fatal.  W
ithout 1
4
idowment support, the festival must
 
either quickly court a new set of backers or radically curtail its programming.
 
It would be all too easy t
o blame the festival's predicament on unwise
 
planning or unconcern on the p
art of program organizers.  Yet such blanket
 
condemnations ignore the peculiar c
ircumstances which govern this e
vent's
 
very existence.  In the first place, the festival is not hosted by an estab-
lished organization which can offer staff and stability.  Rather, it is produced
 
by a loose group of committed individuals who come together every year for this
 
express purpose.  Organizing and inspiring this assemblage is Frankie Quimby,
 
who spends much of the year traveling the folk festival circuit w
ith her
 
husband Doug.  The vicissitudes of public performance simply do not allow Ms.
 
quimby to devote all her time to this event; as one person on a small salary,
 
she c
an only do so much.
 
In the second place, none of the festival staff are trained in folklore
 
or h
ave broad experience in fundraising.  The ways of grant-writing are
 
wondrously strange even t
o those who claim initiation; t
o outsiders, the world
 
of corporate endowment and government funding is oft a realm unknown.  Such,
 
I suspect, is the case on St. Simons Island.  Festival organizers have relied
 
1
 
Ga. Sea Island Festival - 3
� o 
on the Endowment because it was tried and true.  Yet no one at the to
 dowment
 
or elsewhere actively moved t
o stem that dependence by helping local s
taff search
 
for other support.  And now, as festival planners face an inevitable funding
 
cutoff, they still lack expertise i
n grantsmanship.
 
No event of this significance should fall victim t
o a simple lack of
 
financial savvy or p
olitical connection.  There's too large an investment of
 
time, sweat and spirit to waste, too much p
otential to lose.  Yet how the En-
dowment can help is another question.  S
imple re-funding is not the answer.
 
Perhaps s
ome form of technical and s
cholarly assistance is.
 
As it stands, the Georgia Sea Island Festival has three principal needst
 
a)  Developmental expertise - In relying on the Endowment, festival
 
p
lanners have bypassed such regional agencies as the Georgia Council
 
for the ,
Arts and the S
outhern Arts Federation.  Nor have they ap-
proached any of the large corporations based along the Georgia coast,
 
p
articularly the sprawling pulp and paper concerns.  I suspect that part
 
of the problem h
as been simply not knowing whom to contact and how to
 
lobby/apply for funds.  Someone w
ith this expertise could provide in-
valuable assistance to festival organizers by helping to reformulate
 
funding strategies and enlist new patrons.  If the festival is to sur-
vive, this must be its first priority.
 
b
)  F
ield Research - Though built around a core of traditional performers,
 
the festival annually presents many artists who contribute little to
 
the avowed goal  of "acquainting the c
oastal Georgia community with the
 
rich folklore which exists in its midst."  Many featured artists are
 
e
ntirely out of p
lace: others betray a mediocrity which brings little
 
h
onor to their tradition.  Meanwhile, .
many avenues of regional expression
 
remain unexplored.  Directed field research in the area would almost
 
a. Sea Island Festival - �
l
'
 I
 
certainly identify other artists upon whom the festival could draw to
 
achieve a more balanced and artistically consistent portrayal of coastal
 
folklif e
.
 
c)  Interpretive Assistance - the lack of adequate interpretation radically
 
attenuates the festival 's educational potential, making it an event where
 
entertainment is little tempered with enlightenment.
 Yet instruction and
 
diversion need not stand so far apart; together they can deepen under-
standing and facilitate communication.  More context-conscious demonstra-
tion areas , some explanatory signboards , fuller stage introductions, and
 
an expanded program guide would all help festival-goers more fully appre-
ciate and experience traditional culture on the Georgia coast.
 
The festival needs money to accomplish these ends.  Fundraising and refinancing
 
can be accomplished with the aid of consultants (perhaps supplied by regional
 
arts agencies ) or a part-time staffperson . Fieldwork and interpretive mediation
 
would best be conducted by a folklorist familiar with regional traditions.  All
 
will be for naught , however, if the festival is unable to replace the programming
 
core heretofore supplied by the Endowment.  And that's the final dilemna.
 
As the festival came to a close on Sunday afternoon,  participating preacher
 
Rev. Henry Blake called me to his side to discuss the event's future.  As I
 
explained the imminent funding shortage, he silently gazed over the massed
 
audience. Finally he turned, breaking into a smile.
 "Don't worry," he said.
 
"We'll be back.  Even if they can't pay me--if I have to hitchhike--I'll be
 
back.  And so will they."  I hope that he's right, and that some mechanism can
 
be found for keeping the festival solvent.
 I know that I
, for one,  will be
 
here with him.

-
featuring instruction on various instruments, dance, singing, and storytelling.
 
The instructors are, with only a very f
ew exceptions, knowledgeable revivalists
 
having varying degrees of direct u
,xitoct with the t
raditions they present.
 
Many of the instructors are well kno
6ai to those in the folk music scene and are
 
part of the draw of the festival--Mike Seeger, Oscar Brand, John McCutcheon,
 
Jody Stecher, Walt Michael, Brad Leftwich,
 (The enclosed pniyram includes
 
biograpt-L
ies on all the r
iRrticipants).  A brief description of same of the
 
workshops I attended will give a sense of their character:
 
Beginning fretted dulcimer, with Sally Rogers.  Some 40 participants, most
 
with dulcimers.  Sally was teaching them a tune, p
laying a line and then having
 
then play the l
ine in unison.  As she played, she sang out the appropriate
 
fret, "5, 5
, 3
, 3
, 1
, 3
, 1
, 0
."  Most seemed to get the hang of it.
 
Intermediate Celtic mandolin, with Mick Moloney.  Fifteen students, nearly
 
all with instruments in hand and sheet music provided by Mick in their laps.
 
Mick had ,
just f
inished working on a reel and was discussing aspects of style.
 
He noted that the primary goal of the workshop was not to teach tunes, as tunes
 
were readily available.  He noted O
'Neill's book, about which some of the
 
participants knew.  Mick discussed e
lements of style and aesthetic, including
 
when to use various kinds of ornamentation, and answered a question about the
 
use of ornamentation when playing in g
roups.  He discussed the relation between
 
playing mandolin and tenor banjo, and then went on to a j
ig.
 
Four-part harmony s
inging, with V
Nblt Michael and Canpany.  About 60 people
 
l
istened to Walt discuss harmony intervals, using standard music theory
 
terminology.  After i
t!t
-
,ponding to some questions, Walt taught the group "Angel
 
Band," with one member of the gro g singing each part alone.  Then artists and
 
audience sarrj the song together.  The sound was quite pretty, although the
 
harmonies were not traditional by any means.
 
Advanced Pete S
teele t
unes on 5-string banjo, with Reed Martin,  About 1
5
 
students with banjos e
ro ded into a small roan.  Reed talked about s
tylistic
 
techniques and haw certain o
ld hanjo p
layers would play particular tunes.
 
Students requested particular tunes, which Reed then played.  About f
ive
 
minutes before the scheduled end of the workshop, Reed commented, "My goodness,
 
time sure goes s
lowly when you don't have any more tablature to give out."
 
Introductory Vera Cruz Harp, with Conjunto Hueyapan.  Twenty-five in this
 
workshop, none with harps.  The group p
layed a t
une, after which the harp
 
player gave a brief and informative introduction to jarocho music.  Each

o wmented "Better to make a
 
mistake than not to try,"
 
French and Italian Dunces, with Marie-Odile Chantran and Marc Perrone.
 
About 50 people danced in a large, echoing hall to a caller and trio of
 
musicians on f
iddle, accordion, and p
iano.  The music was loud enough but I
 
couldn't hear the f
iddle.  Music, da ncers, and caller were cuigietent and were
 
enjoyed by anther 40 people s
itting in chairs a vend the perimeter.
 
There are some characteristics cuunun to all of these workshops.  All were well
 
attended, particularly those run by the better-known musicians.  The teachers
 
were uniformly good in their pedagogy.  The students were indeed active
 
participants, both in their p
laying/singing/dancing and in their questions.
 
The overwhelming emphasis of the workshops was on text over context.
 In other
 
words, apart from a few i
ntroductory cowmen

i
ts.  The concerts were a secondary phenomenon at the festival.  Clark
 
told me that the Saturday evening concert was introduced recently, in part as a
 
source of revenue for the overall event.
 E
laine suggested that they added a
 
small daytime concert area this year to introduce people to the different music
 
they might encounter at the festival.
 
All of the concerts were well atterxled and c
learly enjoyed by the audiences.
 
Performances were a mixed bag of musical styles, almost exclusively revivalist
 
or popular forms. All of the performers were good musicians and experienced
 
stage performers who p
resented their art with polish.  However, the concerts
 
included no interpretation by host or artist.
 I
t was all simply "
good music"
 
with an implied folk character.  A few examples will convey a sense of the
 
concerts:
 
Afternoon outdoor concert, with Sam Hinton.  The afternoon concert, a
 
continuous series of half-hour performances, was held under a f
ly tent that
 
provided shade and seating for approximately J
50 people.  Hinton is a 70-year-
old folk singer in the 1
960s revival style, accompanying himself on guitar.  f
ie
 
played a humorous topical song,  "What i
f the Russians Don't Cane."  He followed
 
this song with an unacccnpanied ballad and had everyone singing along on the
 
chorus.

Evening concert.  A packed house of approximately 750 people heard a
 
variety of featured performers, each of whcxn played 3a-minute sets.  Apparently
 
in F
'�st
 years there had been carp1aints that the concert was too long, and i
t
 
was cut dawn accordingly.  The hall was a large, rather echoing multipurpose
 
w ail with portable chairs.  Sound reinforcement was generally c
lear, well
 
mixed, and adequate at the concert and at a
ll of the other events.  After some
 
problems in getting the house l
ights off, the concert proceeded smoothly.
 
The host, w
tio owns a local music store, provided brief and generally
 
uninformative i
ntroductiofis.  John McCutcheon was l
auded as someane who "cZU1
 
play the traditional music in t
1ye t
raditional style and still be innovative."
 
John '
 s performance Included a h
um o
 r us sang about m
iddle-class divorce and an
 
original song generally against war and for universal huTan
-ity.  There was a
 
sing-along as well.  M
ick Moloney's group was described as a gr
oup of artists,
 
each of whom i
s the master of the instrument p
layed.  The ensemble played the
 
usual variety of instrumental t
i
t
:-
,11eys and traditional and contemporary songs.
 
Their performance was after
w
a
rds described by the host as "
a b
litz of I
rish
 
music," which was f
ollowed by "another excellent ensemble," Walt Michael and
 
group.  Their set included an original p
iece for hammered dulcimer, l
inked in
 
medley to some j
a77ed-up southern f
iddle tunes.  They also performed a
 
romanticized original song about farm l
ife.
 
Crafts.  There were dozens of craftspeople in booths, with busy activity at
 
n
s.r-t of them throughout the day.
 Instrument makers/sellers were predominant,
 
with dulcimers obviously i
n a
txu,dance.  But there waq every imaginable acoustic
 
instrument for sale: harps, psalteries, bagpipes, bones, spoons, in addition to
 
the more c
crmlon f
iddle, banjo, and guitar.  There was great variety among the
 
other crafts, which included sandpainting, c
loisonne jewelry, magical kingdom
 
stuffed dolls, Hmong PL  
Y
 au, rubber stamps, shaman t
iles, dragon sculptures,
 
hand-woven c
lothing and rugs.
 
The crafts have grown with the rest of the festival.  E

general, the quality of the crafts i

igh, but the only traditional
 
craftsperson at the event was the Hmong needleworker.  The only craftsperson I
 
observed working on h
is craft was an e
lderly bonsai maker, pruning shears in
 
hand.

The Philosophy
 
I gained insight into the philosophy which animated the event from the program
 
book and from my conversations with the WeissmarLs, who are the m o
ving force
 
behind the California T
r aditional Music Society.  The Weissnnans' idea of
 
t
radition begins with an i re of r
ich ethnic diversity: "Traditional American
 
folk music reflects i
ts international ethnic roots as a tangible expieb-cion of
 
our 'melting pot' traditions."  The image of the melting pot does not, of
 
course, suggest the continuation of diversity but rather its elimination
 
through acculturation.
 "However, these tradition[s )
 .
.. are being lost, crowded
 
off the modern performing stage 
 by more (uu 
n
e
 r
 c
 i
 al , can
 t
 empo
 rary music."  The
 
festival, as all of their other events, i
s designed to u
-
-c6at this perceived
 
assault on tradition.  Central to their approach is active participation
 
through which these art for m can be trarxsmitted.
 
This idea of tradition is naive in many ways.  Folk arts have existed at the
 
interface with popular arts in America for nearly two centuries.  While folk
 
arts have undoubtedly changed in this relationship, they remain as a vital part
 
of the cultural landscape.  Some forms have disappeared as continuous l
iving
 
traditions, but others are experiencing a renaissance within their respective
 
communities.  When the Weissma n speak of the dying of tradition, they actually
 
are lamenting the passing of the folk boom of the 1
960s.  At that time C
lark
 
Weissman was in Boston, a major locus of the folk music revival, and E
laine
 
likewise cut her folk teeth on the Fast-coast festivals of that period.  This
 
root experience also accounts for the e
r
rphasis on participation as a
 
cornerstone of tradition.
 I
t is true that traditional artists and their
 
audience are l
ikely to be coparticipents in an event and in a l
arger
 
community.  But participation per se does not a traditional art make, although
 
this dimension of experience was emphasized heavily during the 1
960s.
 
The lack of a c
lear definition of tradition i
s evident in the wide array of
 
arts presented and in the infrastructure of the festival itself.  Although
 
there are a few guiding criteria for including artists--they must be good
 
artists and excellent teachers--the r
ing approach insures that there will be as
 
many visions of t
radition as there are r
ing l
eaders.  Thus, Clark's r
ing
 
analogy i
s quite apt in evoking a c
ircus-like spectacle with a variety of
 
attractions that have l
ittle internal cohesion.  This structure also absolves
 
the We
 i
 ssmans from u
 l
 t
 in-a t
e 2  pons i
 b
 i
 l
 i
 ty for f
 ram
 i
 ng a unified event that
 
does in some way reflect ethnic d
iversity.  For example, E
laine told me of an
 
audience member at the evening concert who accused her of being a racist
 
because no black artists were represented at the event.  Elaine responded by
 
asking the individual i
f she knew any good black artists.  The individual did
 
not, to which E
laine replied,  "Well, what can I do?  B
lack artists are hard to
 
f
ind."  Thus while there i
s a strongly l
iberal democratic spirit which runs
 
through all of this, the l
imits of the festival and i
ts organization are
 
defined by the ccrmmmunity which gets to participate.
 
The people at this festival--artists, staff, and audience--are overwhelmingly
 
white and middle c
lass.  They are, more s
r)(,c
ifically, the graying baby k
xocmers
 
and their children.  The core of the audience, C
lark told me, are "
folk
 
ren
dlists," people who "
grew up with this music" in the 1
9GOs and lost touch

with it when other forrs eclipsed i
t in the i
"edia.  These people support this
 
festival with their attendance, their t
irele---
- staff work, and their unbounded
 
en
 thus i
 asm for workshops and cake
 r
 t
 s
 . The We i
 ssmw-t
s are archetypes in this
 
regard.  In my presence more than one individual came up to Elaine Weissman,
 
embraced her, and said "
I l
ive for this festival" or words to that effect.
 
What really defines and animates this f
estival is not a c
lear oonceptualization
 
of tradition but a quest for ccermini ty . Th
re population served by this f
 es t
 i
 va
 1
 
is highly mobile demographically and socially, more l
ikely to be divorced, less
 
likely to be t
ied to family or oarrmuiity traditions.
 (
When I asked Clark why
 
he came from the F- ,;
t coast to California, he replied a job opport unity and "
to
 
get away fran my mother.")  Indeed, the Sumner Solstice Festival is successful
 
in creating a threc day event which i
s for these people an experience of
 
c
cnmunity.  The Weissma n frequently referred to the artists and craftspeople
 
as a "
family" who cane togther each year for the festival.  But no comment was
 
more telling than Clark's f
inal words to me —"What we create is a weekend total
 
cul t
une .
 "
 
In the l
imited world in which the Weissma n deal--a world of folk festivals and
 
enthusiasts, but a world free of contact with tradition bearers or with
 
scholars of t
raditional culture —the issues of tradition and revival,
 
interpretation and p
rr5entation are irrelevant.  Everything in the California
 
Traditional Music Society contributes to a self-reinforcing, closed system,
 
The Weissmans truly do not understand why NEA Folk Arts and regional
 
folklorists ar
en't interested in what they do, and there i
s no reason why they
 
should,  These issues follow from experiences they have never had and are
 
discussed in a forum of professionals with w
hom they have no ongoing writact.
 
E
laine repeatedly insisted to me that she wanted feedback, but such feedback
 
requires a major act of translation.
 
The Weissma n and the people who surround them are putting on popular and very
 
well-organized events.  At l
east some of than are very knowledgeable about
 
particular traditions.  But they are oblivious to the concerns of NEA and the
 
needs of the indigenous t
raditional cournunities.  Clark suggested to me that
 
there aren't the "ghettos" anymore that nurtured these arts, and thus they must
 
be transmitted in another way.  The d
iverse t
raditional groups that do exist
 
are largely unrepresented and uninterested in what the Weissma n do, which the
 
Weissmans attribute t
o the attitudes of those groups and not to their own
 
approach.
 
NEA and the California Traditional Music Society
 
Under i
ts current guidelines, NEA Folk Arts will not fund this festival.  To
 
put i
t b
luntly, i
t i
s not the program's goal to help the m
iddle c
lass f
ind a
 
sense of roots by the selective appropriation of b
its of o
ther groups'
 
culture.  One m
ight propose supporting the infusion of this event with truly
 
traditional arts to expose the audience to the diversity that does exist.  But
 
i
t takes more than having traditional artists present to convey something of
 
t
radition, a lesson we have learned at Augusta.  The organization and approach
 
of this event would have to change so dram=itically that the festival would lose
 
S

i
ts character and support . There I
s no reason to expect or require such a
 
trans

 i
on .
 
One suggestion would be to provide some opportunities for the Weissmans to
 
experience tradition at c
loser range.  This would certainly help with the act
 
of translation.  I
f they were to attend the National or Smithsonian Festivals
 
they might begin to get a sense of what NEA i
s talking about.  Working as
 
staff would be even better, a
lthough I
'm not sure how these folks would take to
 
being "grunts" at same
 thing like the National.
 
There i
s l
ittle NEA can do with this g
roup as far as inreach i
s concerned, but
 
there may be s
eine real possibilities in the area of outreach.  The recent
 
conference on t
ouring pointed to a new direction for NEA's support of folk
 
arts.  R-L
ile not abandoning i
nreach efforts, we explored the passibility of
 
extending the audience for some t
radition bearers beyond their indigerxnas
 
corm unities.  The most exciting aspect of that meeting was the possibility of
 
caning together with mainstream presenters, a g
roup which up to now has had
 
l
ittle relevance for folk arts presentation.
 
In my conversations with E
laine Weissman I was struck by the similarity of her
 
c
,
 
i
v
i
R
:
�
ii
ts to those fran the mainstream presenters at the conference.  Both
 
expressed a profound openness to the sorts of things NEA Folk Arts was doing,
 
even though those of us involved in folk arts found that incredible in l
ight of
 
past experience.  Both said quite candidly that they could not identify good
 
traditional arts and did not know where to f
ind them.  Both expressed the need
 
for better information and for creating a network of presenters and producers
 
to bridge the gap in information.  This i
s exactly what E
laine has in mind with
 
her netvurk of folk people, and she has already been in (
.v,itact with presenters
 
l
ike Phyllis Brzozowska i
n Dayton, Margo B
levin in Augusta, and folks in
 
Seattle, Chicago, and E
1 Paso.
 
If these ideas sound p
lausible from Jacob's P
illow, why not f
rom the California
 
Traditional Music Society?  Both are run by honest, successful, strong willed,
 
and energetic people.  Perhaps Folk Arts i
s more willing to embrace mainstream
 
presenters i

 OVERVIEW
 
Increasingly the Hopi people are forgetting that our
 
lessons and codes for living are based on the land and the
 
seasons that devolve through the year.
 Most Hopis are
 
forgetting these codes because most Hopi people no longer
 
cultivate fields,  orchards and gardens;  nor do most Hopi
 
tend livestock.
 Increasingly the Hopi people are turning
 
towards employment where little or no rainfall is insignif-
icant.
 
In the past the Hopi were mindful of how much rain fell
 
after the Niman dance,  the kind of rain that fell after the
 
Snake dance and the type of snow  (
dry or wet)  that fell dur-
ing the winter;  based on this information the Hopi planted
 
their fields to ensure a harvest.
 This careful monitoring
 
of moisture and wind determined the measure of the farmer's
 
skill as well as the livestockman for he too was acutely
 
sensitive to the conditions of his range for breeding, wean-
ing the young and maintaining the health of his stock.
 
Such an exacting attention to the weather provided a
 
culture whose leaders felt it obligatory to know how to make=
 
rain;  a prerequisite of office.
 Moreover,  there were felt
 
to be certain elements of the person or a combination of subs
 
jects and objects that caused the wind to blow,  a precursor
 
of evil because the wind can dry a full winter's moisture,
 
stunting growth,  creating a perilous and often inconsequen
 
tial edge for plant survival.
 So knowing when to plant to
 
insure the plant roots survival in adverse conditions until`
 
the advent of summer rains was a combination of skill,  intui-
tion,  prayer and the practical observation of the weather.

Increasingly we spend our lives indoors indifferent
 
to the weather that storms through and heedless about the
 
soil's moisture content.
 Increasingly we drift away from
 
our agragarian roots,  live aimless,  existential lives and
 
in most cases perform ceremonies like actors on a stage;
 
but our  lives are not superfluous..
 
On Third Mesa there is a flourishing art from whose
 
artistry is dependent on the best conditions of both sun
 
and rain,  and the women who follow this craft are duly
 
aware of the seasons that create maximum conditions for
 
Sivapi.
 These weavers follow the progress of the plant
 
Sivapi  through the year and pick the stems at their prime
 
for  integration  into the baskets of their design.
 In the
 
late fall and winter they fire the bushes preparing the
 
way for  fresh stems.
 In the early Spring they watch the
 
amount and type of snow that falls and clings to the bush,
 
;
.
 dripping down the - trunk-to the base of the plant where they
 
are absorbed by the roots.
 They watch the warmth brought
 
in by Powamu and respect the spiritual retreat which Sivapi
 
and all plants go into between Powamu and the Niman dance
 
in July.
 After Niman when the rains fall and the stems are
 
.
;
 at their prime they harvest these stems,  picking them at
 
different steps of maturation for different types of plaques,
 
baskets and the application to various techniques.
 The
 
weavers dye them and cure them in the late summer  for use
 
throughout the year.
 It is the condition of the plant temp-
ered by ideal weather conditions which make it possible for
 
the artist to fashion the dyed stems into new designs,  old
 
desians,  radical designs and often exquisite designs.
 So,
 
this is to say we have a segment of our population who have
 
a practical interest i
n observing the weather,  utilizing
 
aspects of the seasons to their advantage,  for  these baskets
 
which finally materialize from the painstaking '
Labors are
 
the basis of many household subsistences.

In Lhese hard time of receding federal programs and
 
aid to reservation people,  the Hopi turn once more to the
 
land the women gathering plants are showing us how to per-
severe by looking once more to weather and determining their
 
lives based on wind and snow drifts and the pace of summer
 
rainfalls.

II.
 OBJECTIVES
 
Our objectives as outlined in our  initial proposal
 
included subject material relevant to our current celebra-
tion of the Hopi  tricentennial and the dissemination of
 
subsequent material.
 In our pre-production stage we dis-
cussed several Hopi arts which would be most amenable to
 
this goal with possible completion within a year.
 Several
 
Possibilities were submitted and dismissed because of the
 
time element,  including our current subject.
 However we
 
returned to this current subject because it best reflected
 
Hopi values in this our tricentennial year.
 
Our selection was based on several considerations:
 
1
)  the availability of the art;  2
)  Artist's personal know-
ledge of the  involved traditional materials and its appli-
cation during specific seasons;  3
)  Artist's knowledge of
 
which plaques are appropriate for the occasions of weddings,
 
initiations,  and commercial transactions;  4
)  and the Artist's
 
personal involvement and dedication to her craft as art.
 
The last consideration was very important for us because in
 
each individual artist's working towards standards of
 
excellence,  new designs were created,  primarily the result
 
of hours of experience culminating in the resolution of
 
technical difficulties inherent in the properties of the
 
plant;  not surprisingly our choices of Artists fell on older
 
members of Hatevilla involved in village affairs.
 They in
 
turn recommended younger women from whom they had learned new
 
designs and who had encouraged them to experiment,  however we
 
had to stop the merry-go-round of modesty which eventually
 
resulted by settling to work with the original choices.
 
Presumptuous it may be to consider the plaques as art
 
but we have no other  term for a utensil which is never used
 
but hangs on the wall as an aesthetic preference, moreover
 
not a personal preference buy a choice based on an enormous
 
body of criticism related to what makes a Hotevilla plaque
 
good.
 This traditionally recognized craft is our quintes-

Other stated goals such as dissemination and evaluation
 
have occurred at the local level,  on the occasions when the
 
artist's involved in the film wished to view the tape.
 The
 
evaluation of the film's content proceded at those times as
 
well as during the times when we showed them footage during
 
lunch breaks at weaving socials.
 Other viewings were conducted
 
with members of the school staff involved in the bilingual
 
program,  administrators,  teachers and visitors to the school
 
interested in our project.
 Eventu ally we foresee the com-
pleted tape as part of our curriculum,  an integral part of
 
the children's social total evaluation of himself in his
 
environment.
 
Fiscally the funds were managed by the HBCS Business
 
Office directing funds towards various agencies and organi-
zations involved in the production and post-production
 
stages.
 Among the significant ones were Audio-Video Recorders
 
of Arizona, during the production stages and the Bay Area
 
Video Coalition facilities during post-production.
 In retro-
spect the production went along smoothly, with minor equipment
 
breakdowns and technical difficulties.
 
In summation the objectives and goals of our program
 
were willfully and successfully met by determined coordina-
tion and the helpful cooperation of all village people
 
involved.
 It is hoped that this film portrays all the positive
 
elements of our people and reveals our people at their best
 
in utilizing our  land as it was prepared for us.
 It is hoped
 
that this film portrays Hopi people adapting to diverse,
 
adverse conditions and surviving with dignity,  and most of
 
all it is hoped that the children will see how much our land
 
is still responsible for us,  a constant in our lives from
 
which our parents receive the inspirations to create.

introduction 
The following statement is an evaluation of the Kansas State Historical
 
Society and Folk Arts Program's project, "
Images of Strawberry Hill: Works by
 
Marijana Grisnik."  The project includes a traveling exhibit of paintings and a
 
volume (
hereafter refered to as "the text") of five essays and forty-nine plate
 
reproductions of Grisnik's art.  I viewed the exhibit on November 12, 1985, on
 
display in Ottawa, Kansas, in a gallery at the Ottawa Municpal Auditorium. At
 
that time I had opportunity to talk at length with Jennie Chinn, Project
 
Director for the Kansas Folk Arts Program. I also was able to speak with Debbie
 
N-- [
have forgotten her last name], the Director of the Ottawa Community Arts
 
Council. Finally, I have been able to read the essays of the text and see the
 
galleys of the final publication.
 
The Exhibit
 
The "
Images of Strawberry Hill" exhibit includes thirty-seven paintings
 
completed between 1
973 and 1982. According to Jennie Chinn and based on the
 
content of the essays in the text, the displayed works are representative of
 
Grisnik's dominant styles, forms, and contents.  The total of works in the
 
exhibit represents between one-third and one-quarter of the art that she has
 
produced between 1964, when she began painting in oil, and 1985.
 
The Ottawa gallery and exhibit design allowed free access to all of the
 
paintings without either crowding the pictures or placing them either too high
 
or low on the wall and free-standing panels used for display.  The entire
 
viewing context was rather typical of most small town community arts
 
organization in the midwest; that is, the gallery space is open and
 
well-utilized, but without the benefit of the equipment and freedom of space
 
that characterizes urban exhibit areas.  The Ottawa gallery is in the basement
 
of the Municipal Auditorium, thus there is no natural l
ighting.  The use of
 
ample track and spot lighting, however, was sufficient to present the bright and
 
cheery style of Grisnik's works.
 
All of the paintings are oils on canvas.  They are uniformally framed in
 
heavy oak and protected from viewer misuse by protective glass and sturdy
 
framing materials.  This exhibit should be able to travel throughout the Midwest
 
with no damage or other curatorial problems.
 
The gallery arrangement of the paintings was in part based on a plan
 
proposed by the artist to create, if you will, an "
image" of the "
Images of
 
Strawberry Hill."  Although space and gallery design restrictions prevented full
 
compliance with this plan, a visitor still could recognize a patterning to the
 
display.  Upon entering the exhibit, one encountered a few scenes of the "Old
 
Country" based on Grisnik's return visits to Yugoslavia and, according to the
 
March and Lockwood essay, a somewhat romanticized folk notion of peasant life as
 
depicted by the so-called "naive" Yugoslavian artists.  From these scenes, one
 
moves to Grisnik's portrayals of the life, people, and events of her family and
 
the Croatian commuunity in the Strawberry Hill section of Kansas City, Kansas.
 
- 1 -
 
The artist indicated that the bulk of these pictures could be divided by the
 
seasons and that what she is painting is a "seasonal portrait" of her
 
community.  Although the paintings are not grouped altogether in this manner, I
 
do not feel there is a great loss in the viwer's understanding.  Certainbly one
 
recognizes the different seasons portrayed in each of the paintings; moreover, I
 
detect that the "
seasons" of Strawberry Hill are more than climatic, but include
 
the people (
from American-born children to the old immigrants) and l
ife of the
 
community (
from the building of the church to the destruction due to the
 
building of Inerstate 70).
 
The exhibit text includes most of Grisnik's paintings, thereby saving me
 
the trouble of describing them here.  In summary, the majority reflect memories
 
from Marijana's childhood and the period of around 1935-1955. Major categories
 
of community life represented include childbirth and childhood (
e.g. "Visiting
 
the Newborn" and "Sledding on Swiner's Dump"), women's domestic and occupational
 
activities (
 "Plucking Chickens" and "Washday") ,
 coitununity social life (
 "Croatian
 
Wedding" and "Musical Heritage of Strawberry Hill"), food preparation (
"Making
 
Kobasica" and "Making Wine"), and religious institutions and celebrations (
"St.
 
John's Orphanage" and "Good Friday"). Thirty-seven paintings do not cover the
 
entire range of a co
iiununity.  Yet they do present a collective portrait of the
 
major themes that the artist wishes to communicate about her experiences growing
 
up in the community.
 
Each painting is accompanied by a l
abel and caption in which the most
 
important feature is an excerpt from Marijana's discussion of that scene.  These
 
texts complement the visual scenes by providing a portion of the artist's own
 
conceptions or a glimpse of the events or people depicted in the paintings.  In
 
some cases the label texts are descriptive of the visual depictions; sometimes
 
they provide insights into the personalities of the people represented;
 
othertimes they provide a historical context for understanding the construction
 
of a particular building or the presence of one activity or another.  As one
 
important feature of Grisnik's art is that the visual scenes are static
 
representations of community experiences and, in some cases, specific
 
occurrences, the accompanying text or story is integral to the viewer's
 
understanding of the paintings.  I found that the texts, as helpful as they
 
were, could easily have been lengthened without either overshadowing the
 
paintings or taxing the viewer's patience.  In some instances, the caption texts
 
are summaries or exce
.Lpts from longer stories whose entire presentation would
 
have added to the display.  Although the museum curators who guide the length of
 
caption texts typically cringe at such meta-reflections, additions of this sort
 
are appropriate in the Grisnik exhibit (
and indeed are valued when reading the
 
essay text along with viewing the exhibit).
 
In short, the project staff has prepared an excellent and representative
 
exhibit of an important artist.  Foraml art gallery contexts do not appear to
 
detract from the vitality of the paintings, and the exhibit should do well at
 
each of the sites around Kansas and in later travel around the Midwest. It is
 
not difficult, also, to see the hand of the artist in the conception and
 
organization of the exhibit.  It seems that Jennie Chinn has made special
 
efforts to involve Marijana Grisnik not just as the featured artist, but in
 
consultation in preparation of the exhibit design, l
abels and captions, and
 
essay texts.  While this plan may have resulted in some delays in completing
 
- 2 -
 
some project components, it certainly has had a positive influence on the
 
exhibit and provided the comfort of knowing the artists is herself following
 
along on the "performance" of her art.
 
The Text
 
This evaluation is written without the advantage of having seen the
 
published text.  Having read all of the essays, though, and seen the galley
 
proofs, I can say that the text will be highly appropriate and useful for both
 
folklorists and the general public.  The final product will be about ninety-five
 
pages in length, with half of the 4
9 illustrations in color.  It includes a
 
variety of Grisnik's paintings not represented in the exhibit and should have a
 
large audience independent of the traveling display (
although it would have been
 
best, of course, if publication problems had not prevented it from being
 
available for the early portions of the Kansas site schedule).
 
Perhaps the most useful aspect of the text is that it is not simply a
 
catalog of the exhibit.  The volume includes five essays:
 
Carl R
, Magnuson, "Marijana: A Biography"
 
Linda Funk Place, "
Strawberry Hill: Tradition in a Modern World"
 
Jennie A. Chinn, "
From Memory to Canvas: The Work of a Visionary"
 
Howard E
. Wooden, "The Art of Marijana"
 
Yvonne R
. Lockwood and Richard March, "Old World, New World:
 
Croatian-Americans on Strawberry Hill"
 
With the exception of the Wooden article, all of the essays are well
 
written and contribute to a full understanding of Marijana Grisnik the person,
 
the artist, and the member of the Strawberry Hill Croatian community.
 
Magnunson's essay traces the Grisnik family's emigration to America, Marijana's
 
life, and the important cultural, social, and personal influences in her life
 
history.  Two nice emphases in his article are the use of biographical evidence
 
in demonstration of the forces that would later shape the content of some of
 
Grisnik's art and the focus on how her artistic performances reflect a
 
retrospective undertaking following a move off of Strawberry Hill. This tack
 
places her art, and the recognition of her work by the co
mmmunity, squarely
 
within wider movements of ethnic revival and revitalization.
 
Place's essay builds on the biographical piece in her concentration on the
 
traditions of Strawberry Hill in general, particularly the dynamic quality of
 
ethnic traditions and the groups in which they persevere.  Place discusses the
 
continuity of traditions transplanted from Old World agricultural rythms into
 
Kansas City urban existence.  She correctly notes that while traditions do
 
survive across generations and contexts there are important differences in
 
attitudes towards continuity and the place of those traditions in everyday
 
life.  If Strawberry Hill culture is, in part, now a more conscious and
 
deliberated process, it is at least this heightened awareness that will promote
 
- 3 -
 
some sort of ethnic continuity.  Change generally produces consciousness of
 
loss; Marijana Grisnik is an active leader in a movement that is selectively
 
choosing aspects of its own past as a blueprint for the future.
 
The first two essays provide the biographical and historical contexts for
 
understanding and learning from Marijana Grisnik's art.  The third and fourth
 
sections, by Chinn and Wooden, are more concerned with her as an artist and the
 
possible academic and aesthetic trends that she represents.  Jennie Chinn's
 
emphasis is twofold: the consideration of Grisnik as an individual artist with
 
her own vision and as a community "
storyteller" whose canvases potray the shared
 
culture of Strawberry Hill. After tracing some of the arguments between
 
folklorists and art historians over definitions of "
folk art," Chinn is careful
 
to stress that Grisnik is not a folk artist, but that "
the values and attitudes
 
expressed are traditional."  There is a nice tension here: the artist as an
 
individual and the individual as a member of a community and society.  The
 
question of "
folk" or "not folk" is addressed below.
 
Howard Wooden is also not willing to describe Grisnik as a "
folk artist,"
 
preferring instead the awful term of "nonacademic." His contribution focuses on
 
the artist's formal style and her stylistic relationships to other well-known
 
"nonacademic" artistic trends.  Frankly, there are a number of problems with
 
this essay.  It contradicts what is written in other essays and, I suspect, is
 
simply true.  For example, he writes "And although [
Grisnik's] paintings are
 
widely accepted by her people, her aesthetic serves no community function
 
whatever beyond merely documenting community mores and everyday customs."  And
 
"
in no sense can her aesthetic be said to stem from her community."
 
Wooden is Director of the Wichita Art Museum. Part of the problem with his
 
essay may stem from his perspective of art critic whose concern is with the "New
 
Criticism" of content analysis l
argely divorced from biographical or community
 
consideration.  Further, his writing seems directed, r
aore than any other essay,
 
to an academic audience.  For example,
 
Interior space in Marijana's paintings is organized in the form
 
of an open and rather shallow receding cube, frontally planned.
 
Spatial distortions furnish a strongly decorative dimension to
 
these works, but in what is to be regarded as the back face of
 
cubic space, a central motif is introudced which generally is
 
symmetically balanced by coresponding but not identical lateral
 
elements.
 
My suspicion is that folklorists and art historians will be the major
 
audience of the Chinn and Wooden essays because they contain more abstract
 
concepts and peer-oriented discussion.
 
The final essay by Lockwood and March is concerned with the influence of
 
Yugoslavian "naive" artist painting on Marijana Grisnik's own work.  They
 
discuss traditional peasant art in Coratia, including the influence of religious
 
motifs, and then move on to secular painting of the 1
930-1980 period that has
 
been actively favored by political sanction, particularly the cultural policies
 
of the early Croatian Peasant Party. Lockwood and March note Marijana Grisnik's
 
- 4 -
 
awareness and interest in Croatian "naive" art.  Yet they appropriately stress
 
that while Old World art may be an influence on her awareness of artistic
 
relationships with other painters, Grisnik's style reflects the concerns,
 
attitudes, and experiences of the New World. With the other
 
folklorist-contributors, Lockwood and March note the artist's role as cultural
 
broker and storyteller and as a community-recognized source of Strawberry Hill
 
culture and history.

" Art, "
 " Artist
 
A noticeable trend throughout this project from the brief NEA Folk Arts
 
panel comments to the text essays is concern over whether or not this is "folk"
 
art and whether or not Marijana Grisnik is a "
folk" artist.  Everyone concerned
 
with the exhibit and text takes great pains to explain why she is not a folk
 
artist.  Yet there is no agreement as to what "kind" of artist she is.  Jennie
 
Chinn calls her a "visionary" artist; Howard Wooden names her a "nonacademic"
 
and "naive" artist; Lockwood and March settle on the term "nonelite" art.  This
 
disagreement is often discouraging to the reader of the essays.  While the
 
dialogue may have some useful intellectual functions, it brings us l
ittle closer
 
to either understanding or appreciating Grisnik's art or recognizing her
 
wonderful talent.
 
I do not intend to add my own new descriptive category nor confirm any of
 
the titles mentioned in the essays.  I do feel the discussion is in part "naive"
 
in not recognizing a few important issues.  "Folk," "nonacademic," "naive," and
 
other terms are simply idealistic poles of academic continuums.  While there are
 
perhaps a few indivduals who fit squarely at either end, most artists l
ikely
 
fall somewhere between any two extremes.  There are very few pure "
folk" artists
 
in the Midwest, particularly in the visual arts.  According to most folkloristic
 
definitions of folk art and the folk process, though, it does seem that
 
Grisnik's work falls closer to "
folk" than any other title of cultural process.
 
(
Personally I would reject many of the terms used-- "Nonacademic" and "nonelite"
 
tell us what the art supposedly is not, but not what it is; "naive" refers to
 
stylistic tendencies of arbitrary construct and has poor connotations for
 
perceptions of the artist herself.)
 
I believe it is entirely appropriate that NEA Folk Arts funds were given in
 
support of this project.  But I say this without making any judgments as to
 
support of other so-called "visionary" or "untrained" visual artists.  All
 
artists are "
individual" artists.  Only case-by-case considerations of these
 
artists, their works, and the artist's position within the community will reveal
 
a level of appropriateness for Folk Arts funding.  There are great differences
 
between any two of the artists generally lumped together in this category.
 
My belief in this project stems not from the fact that painting is a folk
 
visual art among Strawberry Hill Croatians (
which it does not seem to be), but
 
from the documentation showing that Marijana Grisnik is definitly a major
 
performer of the folk aesthetic of her ethnic group and community.  When
 
considering the so-called "visionary" artists, I find it helpful to separate, at
 
least for analytical purposes, questions of art from questions of aesthetics.
 
- 5 -
 
Art concerns questions of style, form, and technique; aesthetics connotes
 
emphasis on content, performance, and communication.  In matters of aesthetics,
 
Marijana Grisnik expresses, manipulates, and performs within the established
 
emotional and percpetional bounds of her identified community.  This sense of
 
community distinguishes her work from other Missouri "visionary" artists
 
(
including Missourians Robert Smith of Columbia and Jesse Howard of Fulton) who
 
work in both physical and mental isolation from any sense of a shared experience
 
or aesthetic.  In other words, if Grisnik is not a folk artist, there is
 
certainly a folk group and pattern of folk aesthetics evident in both her work
 
and the response to it.  The acceptance of her paintings by the coitununity (
and
 
not just the art critic or collector) as appropriate, and even "beautiful,"
 
community history and documentation is the primary sign of her ability to
 
perform within established, shared aesthetic systems.
 
While Marijana Grisnik is not a "folk" artist in the strict sense of the
 
term, she is a recognized performer and active carrier of her community's folk
 
history.  Lockwood and March note in their essay that "Marijana is a daughter of
 
the Croatian community, and her paintings are a product of the traditions and
 
heritage of her group."  I cannot say I agree that "paintings are a product" of
 
traditions, yet in this case it certainly seems that her work depicts a
 
community's perceptions of its past experiences and ethnic heritage.  While
 
outsider's can quibble over dashes of romanticism in work or the formal elements
 
of accuracy and reliability in her art, the Croatian community in Kansas City
 
acknowledges and shares her portrait of the group's history.  It is that shared
 
knowledge, of course, that contributes to the group's attitudes towards their
 
cultural heritage and provides a blueprint for planning their ethnic future.
 
Jennie Chinn and other project participants stress that Grisnik is a
 
storyteller whose performance medium is the canvas.  Some of the paintings
 
relate to specific community or individual experiences that might be verbally
 
related in story form.  Yet, in a general sense, the bulk appear to comprise a
 
visual parallel to what Barabara Allen and Lynwood Montell call "orally
 
communicated history."  The paintings communicate a set of specific people,
 
scenes, buildings, and so on, but a "bottom line" in many of her canvases is a
 
set of community relationships and associations.
 
Finally, other important functions may be served by support of this project
 
and this artist.  Marijana Grisnik appears to occupy a role in her community
 
similar to what anthropologists call "cultural brokers"; that is, the people in
 
a group who at times of change are instrumental in providing the resolution
 
between conflicting cultural models.  Grisnik definitly expresses a fondness for
 
her ethnic culture and cultural pluralism.  In supporting her work it could very
 
well be that that other traditional arts in this and other communities will
 
experience a vicarious recognition.
 
Other ethnic groups in Kansas City (
Kansas and Missouri) will profit from
 
exposure to Marijana Grisnik's art.  Many have experienced similar physical and
 
cultural disruptions and are likely at that emotional stage of impending
 
"
cultural loss" where some reconciliation will have to be made.  I feel that
 
most communities are beyond the "denial of importance" stage that typically
 
follows cultural disruption.  In looking for possible and plausible avenues for
 
retaining some sense of their ethnic heritage, Marijana Grisnik's work provides

 OVERVIEW
 
Increasingly the Hopi people are forgetting that our
 
lessons and codes for living are based on the land and the
 
seasons that devolve through the year.
 Most Hopis are
 
forgetting these codes because most Hopi people no longer
 
cultivate fields,  orchards and gardens;  nor do most Hopi
 
tend livestock.
 Increasingly the Hopi people are turning
 
towards employment where little or no rainfall is insignif-
icant.
 
In the past the Hopi were mindful of how much rain fell
 
after the Niman dance,  the kind of rain that fell after the
 
Snake dance and the type of snow  (
dry or wet)  that fell dur-
ing the winter;  based on this information the Hopi planted
 
their  fields to ensure a harvest.
 This careful monitoring
 
of moisture and wind determined the measure of the farmer's
 
skill as well as the livestockman for he too was acutely
 
sensitive to the conditions of his range for breeding,  wean-
 
ing the young and maintaining the health of his stock.
 
Such an exacting attention to the weather provided a
 
culture whose leaders felt it obligatory to know how to make
 
rain;  a prerequisite of office.
 Moreover,  there were felt
 
to be certain elements of the person or a combination of sub
 
jects and objects that caused the wind to blow,  a precursc
 
of evil because the wind can dry a full winter's moisture,
 
stunting growth,  creating a perilous and often inconsequen-,
:
 
tial edge for plant survival.
 So knowing when to plant to
 
insure the plant roots survival in adverse conditions until
 
the advent of summer rains was a combination of skill,  intui-
tion,  prayer and the practical observation of the weather.
 
Increasingly we spend our lives indoors indifferent
 
to the
 
soil's
 
weather that storms through and heedless about the
 
moisture content.
 Increasingly we drift away from
 
our agra
ian roots,  live aimless,  existential lives and
 
in most cases perform ceremonies like actors on a stage;
 
but our.lives are not superfluous.
 
On Third Mesa
. there is a flourishing art fAghn whose
 
artistry is dependent on the best conditions of both sun
 
and rain,  and the women who follow this craft are duly
 
aware of the seasons that create maximum conditions for
 
Sivapi.
 These weavers follow the progress of the plant
 
Sivapi through the year and pick the stems at their prime
 
for  integration into the baskets of their design.
 In the
 
late fall and winter they fire the bushes preparing the
 
way for  fresh stems.
 In the early Spring they watch the
 
amount and type of snow that falls and clings to the bush,
 
dripping down the trunk to the base of the plant where they
 
are absorbed by the roots.
 They watch the warmth brought
 
in by Powamu and respect the spiritual retreat which Sivapi
 
and all plants go into between Powamu and the Niman dance
 
in July.
 After Niman when the rains fall and the stems are
 
at their prime they harvest these stems,  picking them at
 
different steps of maturation for different types of plaques,
 
baskets and the application to various techniques.
 The
 
weavers dye them and cure them in the late summer for use
 
throughout the year.
 It is the condition of the plant temp-
ered by ideal weather conditions which make it possible for
 
the artist to fashion the dyed stems into new designs,  old
 
designs,  radical. designs and often exquisite designs.
 So,
 
this is to say we have a segment of our population who have
 
a practical interest in observing the weather,  utilizing
 
aspects of the seasons to their advantage,  for these baskets
 
which finally materialize from the painstaking '
Labors are
 
the

_)asis of many household subsistences.

In these hard time of receding federal programs and
 
aid to reservation people,  the Hopi  turn once more to the
 
:
.
_aping plants are showing us row to Per-
severe by looking once more to weather and determining their
 
lives based on wind and snow drifts and the pace of summer
 
rainfalls.

 OBJECTIVES
 
Oui  objectives as outlined in our initial proposal
 
included subject material relevant to our current celebra-
tion of the Hopi tricentennial and the dissemination of
 
subsequent material.
 In our pre-production stage we dis-
cussed several
. Hopi arts which would be most amenable to
 
this goal with possible completion within a year.
 Several
 
Possibilities were submitted and dismissed because of the
 
time element,  including our current subject..  However we
 
returned to this current subject because it best reflected,
 
Hopi values in this our tricentennial year.
 
Our selection was based on several considerations:
 
1
)  the availability of the art;  2
)  Artist's personal know-
ledge of the involved traditional materials and its appli-
cation during specific seasons;  3
)  Artist's knowledge of
 
which plaques are appropriate for the occasions of weddings,
 
initiations,  and commercial transactions;  4
)  and the Artist's
 
personal involvement and dedication to her craft as art.
 
The last consideration was very important for us because in
 
each individual artist's working towards standards of
 
excellence,  new designs were created,  primarily the result
 
of hours of experience culminating in the resolution of
 
technical difficulties inherent in the properties of the
 
plantf, Not surprisingly our choices of Artists fell on older
 
members of Hotevilla involved in village affairs.
 They in
 
turn recommended younger women from whom they had learned new
 
designs and who had encouraged them to experiment,  however we
 
had' tu stop the merry-go-round of modesty which eventually
 
resulted by settling to work with the original choices.
 
Presumptuous it may be to consider the plaques as art
 
but we have no other  term for a utensil which is never used
 
but hangs on the wall as an aesthetic preference, moreover
 
not a personal preference but a choice based on an enormous
 
A
 
body of criticism related to what makes a Hotevilla plaque
 
good.
 This traditionally recognized craft is our quintes-
senti«1 contribution and celebration of our lives in this
 
our tricentennial year.
 
'Other stated goals such as dissemination and evaluation -
have occurred at the local level,  on the occasions when the
 
artist's involved in the film wished to view the tape.
 The
 
evaluation of the film's content proceded at those times as
 
well as during the times when we showed them footage during
 
lunch breaks at weaving socials.
 Other viewings were conducted
,
'
, ,,
 
with members of the school staff involved in the bilingual
 
program,  administrators,  teachers and visitors to the school
 
interested in our project.
 Eventually we foresee the com-
pleted tape as part of our curriculum,  an integral part of
 
the children's social total evaluation of himself in his
 
environment.
 
Fiscally the funds were managed by the HBCS Business
 
Office directing funds towards various agencies and organi-
zations involved in the production and post-production
 
stages.
 Among the _
significant ones were Audio-Video Recorders
 
of Arizona,  during the production stages and the Bay Area
 
Video Coalition facilities during post-production.
 In retro-
spect the production went along smoothly,  with minor equipment
 
breakdowns and technical difficulties.
 
In summation the objectives and goals of our program
 
were willfully and successfully met by determined coordina-
tion and the helpful cooperation of all village people
 
involved.
 It is hoped that this film portrays all the positive
 
elements of our people and reveals our people at their best
 
in utilizing our land as it was prepared for us.
 It is hoped
 
that this film portrays Hopi people adapting to diverse,
 
adverse conditions and surviving with dignity,  and most of
 
all it is hoped that the children will see how much our land
 
is still responsible for us,  a constant in our lives from
 
which our parents receive the inspirations to create.
