A 
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
In Irish delineations, Ed. Murray and Alice floss are 
'without any superiors, their acting and singing being in-
imitablY perfect and free from anything approaching 
coarsen eS or vulgarity. 
Miss Ross has a 
remarkably sweet 
'voice, and the duets given by her and the inimitable Ed:, 
form one of the most pleasing features of the entertain-
ment.—Blade, Lincoln, Neb., Nov. 23, 1874. 
Ed. Murray and Alice Ross. in their impersonations and 
delineations of Irish character, are simply immense. NO 
better comedians ever greeted a 
Lincoln audience, and the 
appreciation of the acting and singing of these excellent 
artists, was shown by repeated encores and vociferous ap-
plause. 
One of their specialties, which was received with 
marked favor, was " Old and Young," written for them by 
Billy Welch, of Welch and Rice.—Blade, Lincoln, Neb. 
Nov. 21, 1874. 
The Hibernians were greeted, last evening, with another 
large audience, who were immensely delighted, especially 
-with the very artistic performance of Miss Alice Ross, who 
was greeted with storms of apphuRe every time she ap• 
peered, while Ed. Murray as the Guide, was the attraction 
of the evening.—ammontvealth, Topeka, Kansas, Nov. 21, 
1874. 
Mr. Ed. Murray and Alice Ross were the principal at-
tractions, and sustained their respective parts well.—Jour.• 
nal, Sioux. co, Iowa, Dec. 1, 1874. 
Between the scenes, Ed. Murray and Miss Alice Ross 
gave some nice sketches of Irish character, dancing and 
singing, their genuine Irish brogue and witty sayings 
eliciting much applause from the audience. —.7?eyublican, 
Cedar Rapids, 1 
wi, Dx. 12: 1874. 
Ed. Murray in his comic Irish character, and Miss Alice 
Ross, Irish character actress and vocalist, admirably suc-
ceeded in throwing the audience into convulsions of laugh-
ter over their qu L:nt songs and eonaicalities.—Jdurnal, Sioux 
City, Iowa, Nev. 29, 1874. 
Mr. Ed. Murray and Miss Alice Ross, fairly carried the 
house by storm, and it was only after repeated encores 
that the audience were satisfied. 
Ed. Murray's sweet Irish 
melodies and humorous anecdotes, and dashing Irish jigs, 
carried the natives of Erin back to the home of their birth 
and scenes of their youth. 
Miss Alice Ross was, as she 
always is, sweet and charming.—Transeript, Oakizn1, Cll., 
Sep!. 11. 
Miss Alice Ross, vocalist and actress, and Ed. Murray, 
Irish commedian and vocalist who were engaged in the 
East expressly for this house, made their first appearance 
and created quite a 
sensation by their capital acting and 
singing in the musical sketch entitled • Barney's Court-
ship." 
Miss Alice Ross has a 
good stage presence and is 
a 
good sistger and sprightly actress ; Mr. Murray in Irish 
characters does not have much la assume, as he is .eviclent-
ly a 
son of the old sod. 
He makes a 
good rolicking stage 
Irishman, and 
gi.13d with an excollo.at voice. 
Both were 
recalled at the end of their act.—atronL.

One of the most interesting features of the entertain-
ment is -" 
Old and Young," by Ed. Murray and Alice floss. 
They have been repeatedly encored each evening, and D.re 
deservedly great favorites.—Sun, Prov. B. I. 
Alice Ross and Ed Murray, who made their Metropoli-
tan debut, are Irish duetists of a 
high order of merit. 
They have good voices, an excellent brogue, and sing well. 
Their performances gave much satisfaction, and the nu-
merous recalls to which they were compelled to respond, 
attested that they had secured the favor of the audience.— 
New York Clipper. 
Ed. Murray and Miss Alice Ross concluded a 
highly 
su
- 
ccessful three week's engagement, this evening. 
Their 
specialty is Irish songs, dances, etc. 
Mr.Murra.y is gifted 
with a 
fine voice, a 
brogue that cannot be counterfeited, 
and makes up for his pieces in the very best taste and 
manner. 
He has a 
keen appreciation of the rollicking hu-
mor of the natives of the Emerald Isle, is quick to see a 
point and take advantage of it, and perfectly competent to 
provoke a 
smile on the face of the veriest cynic in the 
world. His sketches are " Old and Young," and " Bar-
ney's Courtship," 
In these he is assisted by Miss Ross, a 
young lady of beautiful stage presence, a 
charming songs-
tress, and an actress of no ordinary ability. 
This couple 
introduce several novel changes in their acts, and in the 
very nature of things, must prove strong cards wherever 
they go.—St. E911iS JoUrnal. 
Miss Ross' and Murray's Irish portraitures are charm-
ing.— Chron;c?e, Pit.dnirg. 
Ed. Murray and Alice Ross, in their Irish Sketches, won 
hearty applause, their singing, acting and dancing, all be-
Eng.good.—/zader, PittzLirg.

We just got here from Ireland— 
We are looking now to get some work to do. 
To the Irish folks you've always lent a 
hand, 
In America, the land of brave and true. 
We left Oald Ireland sad, oppressed. 
Down-trodden, 'neath the English tyrant's heel; 
Will she ever be like dear Columbia, blessed! 
And like her, will she e'er that freedom feel? 
We've just come here from Ireland--You and I, 
To America, God 11.:ss her evermore! 
And may Old Ireland ever prove a 
friend, 
To this land we're on, dear Old Columbia's Shore. 
Together we left Ireland— ( 
Mick and I. 
( 
Kate and I. 
That Emerald Isle, the birth-place of the brave! 
We left poor Irish people suffering, sore; 
Whin for this land we cross'd the Ocean wave; 
And now we love your Land so well, 
To leave it e'er again, our hearts would mourn; 
Oh! but still we love our dear old native sod, 
Old Ireland, that's the place where we're born. 
And now, we're going away to look for work— 
Sh! but may be some one here will lend a 
hand— 
Get us a 
place and you will have the thanks 
Of this Irish pair from dear, from dear Old Paddrel 
land!

CHARACTER SONG. 
Written and Sung by Amcn Ross MURRAY. 
Once more I 
am back to my childhood's bright home, 
That I 
left here just ten years ago ; 
Oh! little I 
thought that I 
thus would roam, 
Back here in my rags, filled with woe; 
I 
am tired and weary, and ready to fall, 
From my journey across the wild moor; 
I 
am cold and hungry, unable to call, 
And afraid to knock at the door. 
CHORES. 
I'm afraid to knock at the door— 
I'm afraid to knock at the door— 
To meet Father and Mother, 
Sister and Brother--
I'm afraid to knock at the door. 
I 
will knock at the door, 
And if asked to come in, 
I'll take courage and try to be bold; 
I 
never could stand this piercing wind, 
I'd perish out here in the cold ; 
I 
dread to meet them, though I 
know they'll be glad 
To welcome the wanderer home; 
I 
know they'll forgive me, 
For I've made them feel sad, 
But never again will I 
roam. 
I'm afraid, &a.

Where heat from a

TERRENCE MULDOON. 
By Coif T. Mum, 
For ED. MIIBBAL 
In the county Tipperary there lived, long ago, 
A. Widow whose husband was dead, 
And whose son, I 
am told, when scarce a 
year old, 
Sang songs and drank whiskey in bed. 
And as he grew big he could dance ye a 
jig, 
On a 
table, a 
chair, or a 
spoon; 
And the ladies would sigh for a 
glance of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
14 
CHORUS. 
Be could read, he could write— 
He could dance, he could fight I 
He could sing or could whistle a 
tune, 
And the ladies would sigh, for a 
glance of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
Young Terrence was purty as purty could be, 
And his features—so every one said— 
Was gentle and mild as a 
two year old Child, 
While his hair was a 
beautiful red; 
And as for his hand, by my soul it was grand, 
And his nose it turned up to the Moon; 
Sure, the boys in the street, all envied the feet, 
Of the beautiful Terrence Muldoon. 
He could read, &a 
Young Terrence's eyes were as blue as the skies, 
And his voice was as sweet as a 
fife ; 
But his passion to stale often sent him to jail, 
And at last put an end to his life. 
For one night in his sleep he was caught stealing sheep, 
And the jury agreed very soon— 
A 
rope, do you see, 'round the limb of a 
tree, 
Soon ended poor Terrence Muldoon. 
He could read, 4S50. 
BAOKTROM THE MASQUERADE. 15 
Written and Sung by Alson Murmur. 
You see that I 
have returned, 
From'the Grand Masquerade; 
And oh! such jolly times I've had, 
In the dance and promenade; 
And such a 
nice young man I 
had, 
But his name I 
do not know; 
Now I 
feel so very bad, 
For he might have been my beau. 
[Chorus. 
His hair was black and curly, 
His eyes were clear and bright; 
His dress so well became him, 
For he played a 
gallant Knight ; . 
The sweetest words he whispered, too, 
As we walked to and fro; 
But now I 
feel so dreadful bad, 
I'm afraid I've lost my beau. 
But he promised he would meet me, 
At some other Masquerade; 
Then I'll be sure to learn his name, 
When on the Grand Parade. 
But he promised he would meet me, 
At some other Masquerade ; 
Then I'll be sure to learn his name; 
When on the Grand Parade.

NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU! 
Is Sung by ALICE MURRAY, in their Sketch Terry's Return. 
Sweetly, the stars up above us are draaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn ; 
Sad is the moon, though in radiance beaming, 
She is dreaming, alone and forlorn ; 
Roses and lilies, so gentle and loving,

So, when afar you are thoughtlessly roving,.

Dream of me, darling, for one moment, 
While Norah, your Nerah, is dreaming of you. 
Tho' you forget me, when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own; 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming. 
That I

Come to my heart, like a 
bird that is weary,

Linger not long, for the days they are dreary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I

Dream of me, darling, for one moment only,

WARMING LUCY. 
As Sung by HARRY BRAILL1L 
There was once a 
silly loverer 
-A sweetheart did discoverer, 
•As gentle as a 
doverer, 
A 
girl so smart and fair. 
Her skin's like alabasterer, 
Her father, he's a 
masterer, 
He's what they call a 
plasterer, 
And lives not far from here. 
CHORUS. 
And her name was little Lucy, 
Sweet as apple juicy, 
Always looked so sprucy; 
With him she's play'd the eneey, 
galls him stupid gcqsq, 
Says it is no esey; 
He's so fond of Lucy, 
But she's not fond of he. 
Whe first he told his love, sirer, 
She gave him such a 
shove, gipic, 
And said I 
am above, sirer, 
A 
sort of man like you. 
But it was not amiss, sirer, 
For he gave her a 
kiss, sirer; 
Oh! joy. he thought it bliss, sirer, 
As silly lovers do. 
And her name was, tr.o. 
It's eight years, come to-morrower, 
Since he's been dying for herer; 
She's caused to him much sorrower, 
S' 3 
wouldn'' leave her pa. 
Although he is 
sufferer, 
He gets more tough and tougherer, 
He's a 
grumbling, fat old bufferer, 
As most old fathers are.

IT'S ONLY A 
MATTER OF TIME, 
IIILDERBRANT 
Words and Music by CLAUDE -DEHANErr. 
Sung by the 
EROHANS, in London, Australia and America. 
It's only a 
matter of time when parted friends shall meet 
Their own from a 
distant clime, each loving heart to greet. 
When fond affection,— Nature's gift, in innocence will 
shine, 
And all the glory of the past seems but an age of time. 
When childhood struggles on to age, and then becomes a 
man, 
How plain the precepts in life's page, to do the best we can. 
The path is straight, so guard it well, if glory you would 
find; 
But when you reach it, then you'll say, it only wanted time. 
If we but knew what time would bring, what sorrow and 
what joy, 
How fervently we all would cling to every little toy ; 
And only wish that childhood's days would end where it 
began, 
And never long to see the rays of glory in the man. 
But thus it is, our lives are fraught with energy and pride, 
Our destiny is never bought, but rashes at full tide ; 
If it be misery and shame, or glory for a 
day, 
By some they'll call it fame, but soon ' twill pass away. 
Yes, all of earth that we have won, we'll surely leave behind 
And those who think they've just begun, those treasures 
ne'er will find. 
For each must answer well his part, and straighten out 
his line, 
And then the book tliftt r3atls the heart, will leave it all to 
- 
time..

Here I

I 
just came over from Ireland,

I

fair haired maiden, 
And thisIs what she said—

I'll meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet;

was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My wife she made me a

Of a

And when at night he'd holler for his Paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down. 
And this is what she'd sing— .

OH! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
Filling the sky and the earth below; 
Over the house-tops. over the streets, 
Over the heads of the people you meet, 
Dancing, flirting, skimming along. 
Beautiful snow, it can do nothing wrong, 
Flying to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek; 
Clinging to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
Beautiful snow from heaven above. 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love. 
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go, 
Whirling about in their maddening fun, 
It plays in its glee w.th every one— 
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by. 
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye, 
And the dogs with a 
bark and a 
bound, 
Snap at the crystals that eddy around; 
The town is alive and its heart in aglow, 
To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow. 
How wildly the crowd goes swaying along, 
Hailing each other with humor and song; "4 
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by, 
Bright for a 
moment, then lost to the eye ! 
Ringing, swinging, dashing they go. 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow— 
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 
As to make one reuTet to see it lie, 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet, 
Till it blends w.th the filth in the horrible street. 
Once I. was as pure as the sno 
bat I 
fell; 
Fell like the snow, flakes from heaven to hell, 
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street, 
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat, 
Pleading, cursing, dreading to die. 
SeniPg my soul oNhoeyer );itonid bey, 
Dealing in shame' for i'thorsel of bieacl, 
Hating the living and fearing the dead, 
Merciful God ['- have I 
fallen so low? 
And yet I 
was once like the beautiful snow t 
Once I 
was as fair as the beautiful snow, 
With an eye like a 
crystal a 
heart like its glow; 
Once I 
was loved for my innocent grace— 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face. 
Father, mother, sister, all. 
God and myself I 
have lost by my fall, 
Tb I 
veriest wretch that goes shivering 1,)y, 
Will make a 
wide sweep lest I 
wander too nigh; 
For all that is on or above me I 
know, 
There's nothing as pure as the beautiful snow. 
How strange it should be. that this beautiful snow, 
Should fall on a 
sinner with nowhere to go ; 
How strange should it he' when night comes again. 
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain: 
Fainting, freezing, dying alone. 
Too weak for prayer, too weak for a 
-loan, 
To be heard in the streets of the t. azy town; 
Gone mad in the joy of the snow ..... 0:rdown; 
To be and to die in my terrible woe, 
With a 
bed and a 
shroud of the beautiful show. 
Helpless and foul as the trampled snoN, ' 
Sinner, despair not ; Christ stoopeth low 
To rescue the soul that is lost in its sin, 
And raise it to life and enjoyment again, 
Groaning. bleeding, dying for thee 
The Crucified thing on the accursed tree, 
His accents ot mercy fell soft on thine ear— 
ls there mercy for me? will lie heed my prayer? 
Oh God! in the stream that for 2:nne,rs ( lid flow, 
Wash me, awl I 
shall be whiter than the beautiful snow,.

DID you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
He kept a 
bar-room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Dtank his whisky his beer and rum. 
rye counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand off the flare wid a 
broom, 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers, and ric,,,ers, 
Who wOrked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelrnen, pipemen, and drivers, 
Who worked on the big Boulevard. 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Wid a 
fiddler to play up a 
tune, 
.29 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they wint, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for 10 days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
He sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
Be took spunk and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore, 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stomaeh, 
He sank to rise up no more,

We shout hurrah, 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a

And though I'm not a

On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat, 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fads, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat,

The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a

The tricks his friends did play,

He was great and grand, and took cornmand 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
Be won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away! 
He was mat, 3; 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
33ut ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was gnat, b 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He ran,t have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just t.o think of it—. 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, && 
Ile treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man. 
But now he's gone away ! 
He was great, tkee 
The girls went crazy when he winkpd, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
Bat now they're left alone, poor things; 
hey weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all?

MY name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a

And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just prarious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name. 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
hiulcahey or Malone. 
rm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated.

But you'll never see me loafin' round

Roger O'Malley, Ace. 
I'm as decent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of laming in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, ft.. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, ant' wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me.

0, ladies and Rantlemen listen to me, 
.nd whin you have heard me I'm sure you'll signs 
That I'm much abused. though I 
can't tell why, 
And to tell you my troubles Pm going to try. 
On the corner beyond there's a 
gang of young roues,. 
They insult decent people, and call themselves toughs. 
Ana ivery day at me their slang they do toss, 
And they say I 
resimble the lost Charley Boss. 
They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out " Gilhooley, your collar is loose ;" 
At Mulligan's wake sure they filled me with snuff, 
And tonld me to go out and get meself stuffed. 
!Sure, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a 
job, 
To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
But to understand thim I'm greatly at loss, 
Whin they say, " Pipe him off—there goes you* 
Charlie Ross !" 
'Twas only last night, sure, they gave me a 
call, 
Tc deliver a 
lecture at Hibernia Hall 
I 
put on a 
biled shirt and hastc:7.'d there quick, 
But the blackguards did serve me the diva's own trick. 
Whin I 
wint in they put a 
big bag on my head, 
And rolled nal around 'till I 
thought I 
was dead; 
Then they threw me down stairs with a 
terrible tee. 
And tould the police they had found Charley Boss.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
r, 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement -of:facts t,Thiffiditdi Of thlejournal, 
while teaching natuial 'frphilosophy 
ndchehigtry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need' of a 
text.. 
boot of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirenients as thelbOie wok. It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publialiers, gives it his most ea-nest recommen,lation, 
and wishes it in the hands 'of all who arastill in'the tOk gieut 
the units of work, calculation of the power of inachity, 
resistilnce to motion, strain on material, etc.-21ficauldeterer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work, is well known , as. an extensive 
w7iter who has mad e some valuable a'dditiOns to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on PractiCalnie-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most - 
of the via•ks on mechanics treat the subject in a,manner 
which isnot available to young men Commencing as appren-
tices in'shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, 'however, use this work to great advnntage; , 
it is .not only suitable for h 
text-book, but also as sii work 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young Men will tnitk'e therm-
selves so familiar, with its contents as to 'be '
Wale to refer 
readily to any portion of, the book. 
The author has, adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of Work from other units, 
which ds not without value, and might be° atlinintageouSly 
intrOduced into more ambitious Works.
