Early one morning I went out to plow (Yodel) I went out to plow With an old blind ox and an
old blind cow (Yodel) an old blind cow.
Ol' daddy, the devil, he came to my plow (Yodel) he came to my plow Says one your family
I'm after right now (Yodel) I'm after right now.
Oh, leave my oldest son to plow (Yodel) my son to plow It's the wife of yours I'm after right
now (Yodel) I'm after right now.
He slung her over acrost his back (Yodel) acrost his back Her old long legs went wiggledy-
wack (Yodel) went wiggeldy-wack.
He carried her on and sat down to rest (Yodel) and sat down to rest She up with her foot
and kicked him her best (Yodel) and kicked him her best.
He carried her 'bout half of the road (Yodel) 'bout half of the road And says, Old woman
you're a heavy load (Yodel) you're a heavy load.
He carried her on to the devil's den (Yodel) to the devil's den There was her prisoner tied
up with a chain (Yodel) tied up with a chain.
The nine little devils peeped over the wall (Yodel) peeped over the wall Says, Take her
back daddy she'll murder us all (Yodel) she'll murder us all.
