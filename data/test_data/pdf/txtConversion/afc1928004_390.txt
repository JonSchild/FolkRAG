I'VE wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so cad, 
Dejected and forlorn ; 
Ico master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home again. 
cilollts-
Oh, the .good old days are pass'd and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home again_ 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do ; 
Old master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray ; 
Oh, let me see that good old home 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc, 
When I 
was free I 
left that land 
-Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was -bowed with care ; 
I 
left that home no friends to find. 
My heart was fill'd with pain ; 
Oh, take me to that good old home. 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc.

DON'T YOU DO IT. 
Sung by W. E. 
LYLE. 
rik, give to you some good advice, 
All in a 
friendly way, 
Concerning things that oft occur— 
That happen every day. 
When hard times stare you in the face, 
And pocket-books are thin, 
Don't say there's no use trying, 
If you do you'll never win. 
CHORUS. 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
For you know it never pays ; 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Wait for better days. 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Never give yourself away ; 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Mind what I 
say. 
Don't fret because your clothes are old, 
But keep your heart all right ; 
Don't swear because you cannot sport 
A 
diamond pin to-night. 
Don't make love to a 
strange young girl, 
And say she charms your life, 
But first be careful that 
She ain't somebody's wife. 
Don't you do it, etc. 
Don't laugh at other people's faults, 
But first look at your own ; 
When friends are few because you're down, 
Just go it all alone. 
And when good luck comes on once more, 
I 
hope you wont wait long, 
And while you spend your greenbacks, 
Don't forget this little song. 
Don't you do it, etc.

IF I ONLY KNEW HER NAME. 
The Mus.bc of this song is published by OLIVER DITSON 
CO., Boston, 
Mass. 
'TWAS up in Central Park, one lovely summer's day, 
My heart was like a 
lark, the sky was bright awl gay ; 
I 
lingered by the lake that sparkled in the sun, 
And, oh, the pretty birds did make sweet music, everyone. 
But soon I 
saw two eyes that fondly glanced at me, 
They seemed to wander from the skies, they looked ' so 
lovingly. 
A 
gentle form drew near; she smiled—was I 
to blame ? 
Oh wouldn't life be dear, if I 
only knew her name ? 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only knew her name, if I 
only knew her name; 
Eyes looked sweetest love, to eyes that looked the same 
Then twilight softly fell, oh Cupid was to blame I 
Oh I'd give the world, if I 
only knew her name. 
We saw the swans go by, like little silver ships ; 
I 
heard the sweetest sigh, from luscious, rosy lips ; 
The stars come out at last, and yet I 
could not go. 
How quickly then the moments passed, the heart alone 
can know. 
But soon beside the gate we softly bid adieu, 
For oh the hours were growing late, and birds were 
dreaming too; 
I 
wonder when we'll meet; my heart is still the same ; 
Oh life were angel sweet, if I 
only knew her name. 
If I 
only knew her name, etc.

I'M TOO MUCH THE GENT.- CONCLCDED. 
2 I 
love to flirt with Ballet Girls, 
And peep behind the scenes; 
But champagne suppers never stand, 
They're quite beyond my means. 
Of course 
known upon the Turf; 
And once I 
made a 
book; 
But then the Cads looked after me, 
They thought fd took my hook. 
SPOKEN:—Nothing of the kind, I 
assure you; you know I 
only 
wanted to see a 
friend on the other side of the course while 
the race was being run. 
But some fellahs said I 
was a 
welsher. I 
replied-
CHo. — I'm too much the Gent, &c. 
3 
Some fellahs say I 
always sponge, 
I 
never pay my share; 
But they, you know, are horrid Cads, 
They are, by Jove, I 
swear. 
At times I've been quite out of cash 
When we from home stroll out, 
But I'm too much the Gentleman 
To put these up the spout. 
SrOKEN:—Yes ! 
when _I 
asked a 
fellah to lend me a " soy," he 
said, " You owe me a 
lot now, why don't you put something 
up the spout; old fellah, pawn your watch." "My dear sir," 
I 
replied-
Cito.-I'm too much the Gent, &c. 
4 
A 
blushing maid of forty-two 
I 
once met at a 
ball; 
She'd greyish eyes and corkscrew curls, 
In stature rather tall. 
My good old Dad said, " Fred my boy," 
Conic settle down in life; 
This lady fair with ringlets rare, 
Will make a 
charming wife. 
SPOKEN : -"It's 'not good enough, guenor, a 
leetle too old; she 
has dropped the handkerchief a 
dozen times for nw to pick 
up. 
Now if she had been about eighteen and a 
large for-
tune looming in the distance, I 
should be most happy. 
But 
when they have reached the mature age of forty-two, corlc. 
screws and no money, why-
Ciro:- I'm too much the Gent, &e. 
(

Sung by AL. PAGE., 
Not many years ago, 
When I 
use to rake and hoe 
On the Louisiana bottom, all the day ; 
But since I've been set free, 
Not much pleasure do I 
see ; 
But at last those good old days have passed away. 
But I 
am getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away. 
My good old massa beckons me to come. 
If you hear those voices ringing 
I'm waiting for you now, so I 
must go leave my good old 
southern home. 
All my friends have gone up there, 
With the angels bright and fair ; 
My good old massa beckons me to come 
From the heaven bright and fair, 
With angels dwelling there, 
I 
must go and leave my good old southern rei.tme, 
When I 
was but 
little boy, 
To dance and sing it was my joy ; 
You could always find me gamboling on the 
But I'm getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away, 
And say farewell to the happy days I've seen , 
But I 
know I 
soon must go, 
For the Bible tells me so— 
Pm waiting for my summons now to come ; 
For de angels dwell up (Tar, and look so bright and fair, 
I 
must go and leave my good old southern home. 
All my friends, etc.

BEHOLD in me a 
dashing belle, 
The leader of the style ; 
The cut of this girl's dress, no doubt, 
Will cause you all.

There's one thing I 
would have you know, 
'Bout fashion which yon see 
If the style now- a-days you would assume,

All tied back—all tied back— 
All tied back, just like me ; 
If the style now- a-days you would assume, 
Get tied back, just like.me. 
The Grecian bend has now passed by, 
Likewise the Broadway crawl, 
Of all the styles I 
ever saw, 
I 
like this best of all. 
0, ladies, liiten no' , I 
pray, 
Take pattern after me, 
If the style now- a-days you would assume, 
Get tied back, just like me. 
All tied back, etc. 
WHISPERLNG IN THE TWILIGHT. 
Sung by S. JONES. 
W HISPERING softly in the twilight, 
In the days so long ago; 
One bright face with golden ringlets, 
One gentle voice so sweet and low; 
Shall we never, never meet again, 
Darling, tell—dost thou know ? 
CHORUS. 
Whispering softly in the twilight, 
In the days so long ago ; 
Face so fair, with golden ringlets, 
In the twilight, whispering low. 
Ling'ring, waiting in the twilight, 
Darling little face so fair; 
In my dreams once more I 
see thee, 
As though I 
still were lingering there, 
And I 
know that thou art waiting, 
Somewhere on the mystic shore. 
Whispering softly, etc. 
ANGELS MEET ON THE CROSS-ROADS. 
Sung with great applause by BILLY KERSANDS. 
I'VE lived for months, and lived for years— 
Can't get use to my weeping tears— 
Loss my way on road in sin— 
Then wake angels and pass me in, oh ! 
cnonus. 
Oh angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Oh angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Don't charge sinners any toll. 
What kind shoes is those them angels wear 
That they walk up yonder, up in the air ? 
Stand by the gate till I 
hear angels knock, 
Then I'll drop all my niekles in missionary box. 
Oh angels meet me, etc. 
Angel, I 
ain't got to wait, 
Standing now at the golden gate. 
When I 
get on that other shore, 
I'll walk right in and shut the door. 
Oh! 
Oh angels, meet me, etc. 
'NEATH THE MAPLE BY THE MILL. 
Sung by H. G. 
LITTLE. 
W HERE the moon is softly beaming 
O'er the cabin and the wildwood, 
And the birds have gone to rest among the trees ; 
Where the sturdy woodman's stroke 
Has ceased to echo through the forest, 
And the milkmaid's songs come floating on the breeze. 
When the old church bell is chiming 
The soft hour of evening prayer, 
I 
shall look for your light footsteps down the hill; 
I 
shall be impatient, Nellie, 
Till I 
hear your steps beside me, 
And we're sitting 'neath the maple by the mill. 
I'm sitting by a 
little mound, 
Beneath the maple shadow, 
Where it's leafy branches o'er me gently wave ; 
There beside me sleeps the treasure, 
While the sweetest autumn flowers, 
Are all blooming in sweet fragrance o'er her grP -
vre. 
When the wintry winds are sighing, 
Among the leafless forest trees, 
And the flowers'. lying withered cold and still, 
I 
shall bid farewell to earth, 
Could I 
sleep beside my darling, 
In the grave '
neath the maple by the mill. 
Sung by W. E. 
LYLE. 
SOME lovers are so bashful, 
They never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why, 
But when my charmer's pa is near, 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, clear; not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa. 
Not before pa, not before pa ; 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, love, but not before pa 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
W e sat upon the lover's seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze. 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which ca ,ned a 
dreadful sigh, 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day—" 
These words were her reply--
Not before pa, dear, etc. 
DANCING THE GLIDE. 
Sung with immense applause by W. E. 
LYLE. 
Or all the many dances, 
That everywhere I've tried, 
There's none that suits my style so well 
As the dancing of the Glide. 
I've tried the hop-waltz and the plain, 
But of all the styles I 
pride 
Myself when music swells the air 
To dancing of the Glide. 
CUOI1US. 
Dancing to the Glide, 
The fascinating Glide ; 
Of all the styles, I 
like the best, 
'Tis dancing to the Glide. 
Dancing to the Glide, 
The fascinating Glide ; 
Of all the styles, I 
like the best, 
'Tis dancing to the Glide. 
There's some that think the Polka, 
Or Schottisch is the best ; 
But for good style and elegance, 
The Glide beats all the rest. 
So let the world take it's own choice, 
I 
by my taste abide ; 
For naught can suit my style so well 
As dancing of the Glide. 
Dancing to the Glide, etc.

LONG ago, long ago, how the pulses will start, 
When a 
glimpse of the past meets our gaze, 
And bright as a 
sunbeam steals o'er the heart, 
The remembrance of earlier days. 
How the mind loves to linger o'er childhood's young hours, 
When the moments with pleasure were rife, 
And we flourished, young blossoms, in joy's golden 
bowers, 
In the beautiful spring time of life, long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Long ago, long ago, let us cherish the hours long ago. 
There's a 
joy that all other enjoyments is worth, 
In recalling the hours long ago. 
Long ago, long ago, tho' the years have rolled by, 
There are moments we cannot forget; 
They have passed from the sight as a 
star from the sky 
But their brightness illumines us yet. 
As the sun when at evening he sinks in the West 
Floods the heavens with a 
crimsoning glow, 
So remains of past sunshine in memory'll rest, 
From the days that have gone long ago, long ago. 
Long ago, long ago, etc.

DON'T be sighing, little darling, 
Better days will come again, 
Dry your tear-drops, lovely roses 
Soon forget the passing rain. 
We have seen the summer weather, 
We have loved when life was fair, 
So we'll fondly cling together, 
Though our hearts are full of care. 
CHORUS. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Sunshine follows after rain ; 
Though the shadows now are falling, 
Better days will come again. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Come and sit beside me now, 
Though your tresses once were golden, 
Time has silvered o'er your brow. 
Days of sorrow wandered near us, 
But our love is still as pure, 
While adown the hill we journey. 
Ever more it shall endure. 
Don't be sighing, etc. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Brighter skies will shine above, 
Life is gladness, hope is round us, 
While our hearts are full of love. 
Oh, your smiles can make it summer, 
Though the wintry days may blight, 
We will fondly cling together, 
As we've done in days so bright. 
Don't be sighing, etc.

Her father is the driver of 
A 
four-wheel hansom cab; 
Tier lovely eyes are black and blue, 
Tier lovely hair is drab: 
She has an only brother, awl 
Another one as well; 
She says she loves her mother, but 
She'll kiss and never tell. — Cho. 
She used to have a

Who's always with her now,

They do so like a

'Twos when we rode out for a

And when the winter-time comes round, 
We all go making hay. — Cho.

If he don't leave this town.

Till I

What lovely teeth, as white as chalk, 
Pray tell me what's her name ; 
I'd pawn my coat and hat for her, 
Or turn into It tree, 
If Pretty little Polly was 
A-biossoming on me. 
Sweet Polly Blossom, eta, 
Last night I

And take her by surprise, 
When tlitre Augustus Jeeins I

And kicked him from the room : 
She fainted in my arms, and cried, 
For you alone I'd bloom.

I 
MET HER IN THE PARK. 
Sung by W . 
E. 
LYLE. 
The Music of this song is published by PERRY, Boston. 
I 
MET her in the park one day, 
While strolling on the Mall ; 
Her sunny face it cross'd my way, 
The fairest one of all ; 
I 
caught the glance of laughing eyes, 
That shyly met my own, 
And just a 
look of sweet surprise 
When I 
myself made known ; 
Through pleasant paths we strayed along, 
So happy after that, 
While birds sang sweet songs 
To all our merry chat ; 
How swift the moments passed away 
I 
never cared to mark, 
Since this was life's far brightest day 
While walking in the park. 
CHORUS. 
I met her in the park, 
Mid music, birds, and flowers, 
My heart was joyous as a 
lark 
In all those happy hours ; 
Each hour was IAN.; to me, 
Their flight I 
dare not mark ; 
For life seemed sweet as sweet could be, 
While walking in the park. 
We strayed beneath the leafy trees, 
-With no one very near, 
I 
whisper'd tales I 
thought would please 
So gently in her ear ; 
I 
asked her, with a 
sweet caress, 
If she my own would be ; 
She murmured to me softly " Yes," 
And sweetly smiled on me ; 
I 
told her we would meet again 
Quite often after this, 
And for a 
token then 
I 
gave one little kiss ; 
The stars were in the summer sky, 
The day was growing dark ; 
And so we softly said good-bye, 
And parted in the park. 
I 
met her in the park, etc.

And vow'd 'twas me they were after, 
I 
trembled, I

It was with inward laughter I 
Some came who well might please, 
And others with much money-, 
But to see them on their knees, 
To my mind was quite too funny! 
Oh, amet I

LOVE to hear sweet music, 
At morning, noon cr night ;

The people all do listen, 
And stop to hear them play 
Their sweet airs from opera, 
As they march on Broadway. 
They play so grand and beautiful, 
Attention they command ; 
They can't be beat, when on the street, 
This military band.

And cornets in their band, 
They swell the air with music sweet, 
This military band.

LITTLE BESSIE. 
Sung with great applause by SAM JONES. 
On, say have you seen little Bessie, 
Little Bessie, darling Bessie ? 
Oh, say, have you seen little Bessie, 
With eyes like the stars in the night ? 
Her cheeks are like roses in summer, 
Her ringlets are sinning like gold ; 
We call her our fairy, our darling, 
The sweet little pet of the fold. 
Oh ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, say, have you seen little Bessie, 
Who loves mid the wild flowers to roam ?

Little Bessie, darling Bessie, 
So gentle and mild is our Bessie 
That nothing but love- words we say; 
We 
list to her fairy-like music 
She sings by night and by day ; 
Oh, what would the world be without her, 
If Bessie was taken away ? Oh! 
Oh, say, have you seen, etc. 
Then sing while you may, little Bessie, 
Little Bessie, darling Bessie,

Thy young heart so happy with love;

Dare's no-
kody left about the place to talk to old Pomp now. 
Massa 
Tone, and raissis too. 
Even my dog has left me. 
Well, well, 
I'm only waiting for de summons to come along for poor old 
Pomp. Many and many a 
year I've trabbled on de road, and 
I'm footsore and weary now. 
[Enter HENRY.] 
HENRY.—Why, as I 
live, it's old Pomp! Pomp, don't you 
know me? 
POliP.—Yes—no. Why—why, it's Massa Henry!

see your old eyes are good for some-
thing yet. 
POMP.—Well, well, war did ye conic from ? 
HE..N.am—Oh, I've been traveling up and down the world 
for the last seven or eight years. 
But how is everything on 
the old plantation ? 
POMP — All gone to ruin. 
Everybody ' cept me gone dead. 
HRNRY.—Cheer up, old friend. 
Why, you used to be as 
lively as a 
cricket. 
No song was as gay as yours on the old 
plantation. 
Where's the old banjo? 
POMP.—Hangs up on the wall; I 
haven't the heart to pick 
on de strings any more. 
IlEntv.—Come, Uncle Pomp, sing us a 
song. 
Maybe 'twill

Sung by Wri.mn E.

I'Ts a 
note from dear Augustus, ' tis replete with love for me, 
He invites me out next Sunday, oh, what pleasure it will be 
To Central Park he intends to go, to ramble around and observe 
the show, 
That day I'm sure, many joys will bring, just listen, and his 
words I'll sing. 
I'll meet you in the Park next Sunday, 
Oh, don't forget, my pretty little pet; 
I'll meet you in the Park next Sunday,

must obey, 
No one e'er could refuse him, let mamma say what she may ; 
Sometimes she says I'm a 
wilful child, and wonders why I 
should be so wild, 
But girls in love only have one voice, whose language is their 
only choice. 
I'll meet. you in the Park, etc. 
At the lake side and Casino we will mia.zle w.ith the crowd, 
And the grass will feel our footsteps, if such freedom be allowed; 
And gaining pleasure where'er we go, sweet words of love we'll 
whisper low. 
Augustus dear, I'll meet you there, oh wont we be a 
happy pair. 
I'll meet you in the Park, etc.

PRETTY LITTLE JESSIE. 
Written and Composed by Wu. H. DELEHANTT. 
OR! have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the summer of her smile would set you crazy, 
With hair and eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd tremble with delight, 
And deem it all an honor— 
Her sweet face blushing bright; 
Oh! you should see my pretty little Jessie, 
Her beauty-shames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
CHORUS. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancing, 
Oh! may the joy of life forever bless th.., 
Lovely queen of every rose. 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop in the rosebud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes; 
Oh! who would dare to crush her, 
A sweet and tender flower, 
And who would dare to hush her, 
While singing in her bower ; 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song; 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd sit there all day long. 
My heart, etc. 
I 
sometimes think that I 
am going crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white- cap daisy 
Its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is their friend. 
This evening she and I 
were in the garden— 
When I 
my suit did press ; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She blushingly answered yes. 
My heart, etc.

OUR 011.A111.1)-FATSEALS' DAT& 
A. song for to please all my kind friends before me: 
I've been thinking, of late, a 
new subject to raise, 
And one I've got and I 
know it will please you: 
I 
am going to sing of our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, men were judged but by merit, 
And those who were sound, got their measure of praise; 
But, now-a 
days, folks judge of men by their money— 
That wasn't the case in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers days they had no patent leathers, 
Garot-choking collars, or no peg tops pants ; 
Young men didn't go it with two- forty horses, 
Or visit young ladies, at night at their aunt's,. 
The boys didn't then congregate on the corners 
To see the gals crossing, on wet slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't want a 
policeman to help them-
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand-fathers' days, billiard-markers ne'er sported 
Mustache on their lips, or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did six penny barbers drive out in light wagons, 
Nor did fish- ball waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cotton, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cock-tads at Taylor's: 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days married men they were steady; 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out, late, walking home with their cousins; 
They always retired in good time to their wives; 
They had no Champagne-suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying to go it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintance— 
They had no waiter girls in our grandfathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, when a 
man ran for office, 
He did it alone for the national good, 
And not for the dollars and cents lie might pocket 
That is something that. now- a- days, ain't understood. 
The Government., then, was for wisdom selected, 
Rebellion hadn't set. the Ciamtry a- blaze; 
But the people have sworn that our Flag shall float over 
ThsUidnn that wa in ourgraud-fitthers' days l

BRIGHT tresses of golden hair twining 
O'er cheeks that are crimson and white. 
With blue eyes so roguishly shining, 
Like stars of the sweet summer night , 
The dimpled white fingers are strayini,' 
To gently be clasped in our own, 
While loving hearts ever are saying, 
Another sweet face in our home. 
CHORUS. 
Another sweet face in the cradle, 
One more in our sunny household, 
Whose coming we joyfully welcome— 
Another sweet face in the fold. 
From heaven a 
radiant blessing, 
Our little one to us was sent ; 
For kissing and tender caressing, 
A 
jewel from Paradise sent; 
We call her our dear little fairy, 
None better 'neath heaven's blue dome; 
Oh ! long in our fold may she tarry, 
This sweet little blossom of home. 
Another sweet face, eta. 
Yes, she is the daintiest lassie 
Of all that we cherish and love; 
With laughter so gleeful and merry, 
And voice like the coo of a 
dove ; 
May life be a 
dreamland of pleasure 
Wherever her footsteps shall roam; 
Our last and our best little treasure, 
This sweet little one of our home. 
Another sweet face. eta.

I 
HAVE a 
darling whom I 
adore! 
When he is near I'm sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart; 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day vh en I'll be his bride ; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again, and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain ; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me, and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care; 
sever refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful, and scream out, " Oh, my !" 
Kisses are plenty, and kisses are sweet; 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat ; 
If with your loved one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " Kiss me again !" 
Kiss me again, etc.

Music by W. A. HUNTLEY. 
The Music of this song is published by C. H . 
DITSON & Co., 711 Broodo

Price 30 cents. 
COME sing to me, Addie, again, 
While your head gently rests on my breast, 
Come sing to me, Addie, again, 
While your hand in mine softly is press'd; 
I 
love the sweet songs that you sing, 
For angel thourYhts to me they bring, 
And, Acidic, the birds on the wing 
Could never such melody ring. 
CHORUS. 
Sing to me, Addie, again, 
Come sing to me, darling one, do, 
The songs that I 
only admire 
Are those that are rendered by you. 
Come sing to me, Addle, the song 
That you sang when we met by the wood; 
The time has not, Addle, been long 
Since the eve that it sounded so good; 
I 
think it commenced with a 
kiss 
Bestowed upon some little miss, 
While standing beside an abyss, 
Reflecting, no doubt, upon bliss. 
Come sing, etc. 
Come sing to me, Addle, now do, 
The sweet song that you sang to me then 
Remember, dear Addie, that you 
Often sang it to me in the glen; 
Not even the best singing bird 
Compared with the song I 
then heard, 
While each thrilling note and each word 
My whole constitution then stirred. 
Come sing, etc. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
On, I'm very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky, 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words she whispers, 
And her eyes are sparkling blue; 
But what she says you may be sure 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh, we wander while the shaeows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes they are my light; 
Of all the joys, it beats them all, 
This flirting, in the twilight. 
CIIO RUS • 
Oh, my heart kept going pit-a-pat, (
Break.) 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was at; (
Break.) 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But her beaming eyes they are my light; 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
Now I 
called her pet and dearest, 
And I 
could not tell you half, 
And said she was the nearest, 
Then she laughed a 
little laugh: 
My arm I 
kindly offered, 
Then I 
offered her my hand, 
And said she'd make her darling on 
The happiest in the land. 
There was a 
darkness in the pleasant air, 
But her beaming eyes they are my light; 
I 
kissed her ere she was aware, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
Oh, my heart, etc. 
Now I 
never can forget her, 
Nor her dear enticing way, 
Near the place where I 
have met her 
I 
wander every day. 
My heart is in her keeping, 
She has stolen that, I 
know ; 
But she really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau 
So we wander in the darkness yet, 
But her charming eyes they are my light; 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
Oh, my heart, eta.

lady. 
Bow the lady should reply. How a 
gentleman is to tell he loves. 
What the 
lady should write in reply. How a 
gentleman should write to a 
lady, under 
all and any circumstance. What the lady's replies should be. 
Shows how 
widowers as well as bachelors should woo widows, whether young or middle-
aged.

plainly and fully explained.
