TAKE THIS LIVER TO MY MOTHE H. 
A PARODY ON " TAKE THIS LETTER TO MY MOTHER." 
Composed by JOHNNY ROACH. 
TAKE this liver to my mother, 
She's been waiting long for me, 
If she scolds me when you see her, 
Tell her I've gone on a 
spree ; 
Tell her that the butcher asked me 
To play a 
game of forty-fives, 
And we had a 
drop of whiskey, 
He said it 
as the best old rye. 
CHORUS. 
Take this liver to my mother, 
She's been waiting long for me, 
If she scolds inc when you see her, 
Tell I've gone on a 
spree. 
Take this liver to my mother, 
Tell her that I 
lost the fat, 
And if she thinks that it's not healthy, 
Tell her to give it to the cat. 
Long we played and each played hearty, 
For to win the game we strove, 
And all the time there laid the liver 
Upon a 
chair beside the stove. 
Take this liver, etc. 
Take this liver to my mother, 
Say I'll not come home to-night, 
Tell her while at cards we were playing, 
The butcher and I, we had a 
fight ; 
Say I 
bit off his nose and finger, 
And now the cops are after me, 
And if ever I 
get out of this serape, 
I'll never more go on a 
spree. 
Take this liver, etc. 
BEECHER'S BREAD AND WATER PLAN. 
Song dedicated to the working men of our country, by T. C. 
Alit.—" What the Old Coeli..
,Tarrow Said." 
I 
SAT me down to rest and read the other day, 
And judge of my amazement and surprise, 
In glancing at the news, I 
was stricken with dismay, 
When a 
paragraph appeared before my eyes, 
In which the moral preacher, the sanctimonious Beecher, 
Avows that each and every workingman 
Art only fit to die, because they will not try 
To live upon the bread and water plan. 
I 
hung my head with shame, a 
tear unbidden came, 
Great God ! I 
cried, is this American, 
Must we toil with hand and brain, in sunshine and in rain 
To be fed upon the bread and water plan ? 
Net many years ago, in our broad and fruitful land, 
Such sentiments as Beecher's would not pass ; 
But look around you now, and you'll find on every hand 
A 
purse-proud and aristocratic class. 
Go up to Central Park, some evening just at dark, 
The stockholder sits behind his blooded span, 
let we must not stop to think, or a 
glass of beer to drink, 
But be fed upon the bread and water plan. 
Why don't they hang a 
bone upon a 
telephone ? 
Since feeding now by ‘• culture" they've began, 
With a 
smell three times a 
day, I'm sure we'd feel 0. K., 
And it's cheaper than the bread and water plan. 
Now Henry Ward declares, education's thrown away, 
If bread will not sustains us in this life ; 
In short, he'd have us live on three meals of it a 
day, 
And on it feed six children and a 
wife, 
And soon ' twill come to pass, they'll feed us on blue glass, 
Since science is a 
never- failing cure, 
And true inwardness and gush, ragged edge and Ply-
mouth slush, 
Will satisfy our wants and keep us pure ; 
Hallelujah ! let us pray, give praise each night and day, 
The time has come when every workman 
May bid farewell to care, and live on sumptuous fare, 
With Brother Beecher's bread and water plan. 
DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACK COK1ZOY. 
Dm 
you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County 3layo. 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith., indeed, 'twas an elegant sight; 
But the boys, -one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night 
CHORT:S, 
Ah, -but Duffy sold horrible liquor; 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
roor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in dm es and by dozens, 
And got into a 
terrible fight 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, 
They -stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible -
plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since he gave the grand opening night. 
Ali, but Duffy, etc.

As sung by COTTON and BIRDUE-. 
IN 
the papers have you read, 
Have you noticed what they said, 
That no Irish people need apply 
To earn their daily bread 
'Twill plainly show to you 
The course you should pursue ; 
And in honesty I'll show you 
What you really ought to do, 
CHORUS. 
On this you may rely ; 
You will find out by-and-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny rarer 
Are welcome to apply. 
NO IRISH NEED APPLY. 
ri 0 IRISH NEED APPLY.— Concluded. 
f.Yeto VerSiOn.) 
That cruel, cold, unpleasing•one— 
No Irish need apply! 
On the plains of Waterloo, 
Where the bullets like hailstones flew, 
'There was the Duke of Wellington, 
Bad luck to him! what did he do.? 
He beat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the Irish won their part. 
>CHORUS. 
Faugh-a-ballah! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll diel 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-and-by. <Repeat) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
just note the Irish girl, 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
As she's skipping to the welt 
Where you can get.a bite .or sttp 
With blossoms blooming on her cheelm 
Wherever there you go; 
Like roses in the dell; 
So don't treat them with disdain, 
She is so bright and fair, 
But show each man the same ! 
With her jet-black eyes and hair-- 
let all apply, that be the cry, 
Show me your English lady, 
And welcome when they come! 
Who a 
brighter name can bear !. 
CHORUS. 
CHORUS.. 
Then rise them as you should— 
For ' tis fit we all do good, 
Never let me hear that cry,. 
And never crush an Irishman, 
As I 
heard. in days gone by 
But rise him as you should

REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR 
OWN. 
Sang by GEORGE IluNTEn, with immense applause. 
Is your path through life each day you will meet upon 
the way 
Fellow-mortals upon whom this world cloth frown,. 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or, by circumstances crushed and stricken down, 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble 
aims; 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save from a 
dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them 
with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone. 
You know not what's in store for the loved ones 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your own. 
The shop-girls on the street with as much respect should 
meet 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny 
hand; 
They, too, have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls. 
Their family is as dear to them as any here. 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn, and old;

REMEMBER YOU RAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR 
OWN .__Concluded. 
Dejected and forlorn, yet 'still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and 
gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word with soothing tone. 
iou know not what's in store for those whom 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor whom perhaps grim want 
may lure 
To steal the bread their starving children crave. 
Be not the one to blame—you, yourself, would do the 
same. 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once, 
like you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who, no doubt, through care and strife, or some sorrow of 
their life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall; 
And the poor outcasts forlorn, don't pass them by with 
scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone. 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and 
shame; 
Remember you have children of your own.

JOHNNY MORGAN. 
Sung by tLter; CoNno 
I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you woukl say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all Played (Efferent instruments ; 
The music was the same. 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name; 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ; 
The father beat the drum; 
The sisters played the tambourine; 
The brother went porn, porn, porn, porn. 
All alone on an old trombone.. 
The music was. so sweet 
They often got a 
penny to go 
Into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny 
Was the smartest of them all, 
And around the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant-girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
Johnny Morgan, etc. 
Now, one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she'd never heard 
Such music played before. 
It pleased her so that you must know 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John to stand outside the house 
And play to her all day. 
Johnny 'Morgan, etc. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so 
That when the time arrived to leave 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon. 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY. 
Revised and Sung by JOLINNT Rolm with great success. 
Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are firli or fowl it makes no difference to I, 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm ,God knows how far away.) 
There's politicians now- a-days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madam Morris, fron, L'orsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows. 
Good gracious that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
In Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
The thought I 
was a 
little flat— perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
r-' -rner on the atv, 
MeMAHON GRENADIERS. 
Sung with great succes by JACK CONROY and GEORGE HUNTER. 
THE flags are flying gayly; 
The marshal's in command; 
The streets with people now are lined, 
The turn-out will be grand. 
From windows high they're shouting, 
" 
Oh, what a 
glorious day 
To see the McMahon Grenadiers 
March out in grand array !" 
RFFRAIN AND CHORUS. 
As through the street we march we break each lady's 
heart. 
Our style is of the best when we appear. 
Our fame for solid Irishmen and love for Ireland 
Will nevermore be tarnished by the McMahon Genadiers. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we are a-marching ; yes, a-marching ; yes, a-marching. 
The ladies—yes, the darling little dears— 
With open hands they shout aloud 
For the McINIalion Grenadiers. 
Our colonel's name is McMahon, 
Our captain is O'Hale. 
If they should call on us to fight 
You bet we never will fail. 
We are not one of the home-guards, 
Who never fight, but run ; 
But soldiers to the front 
You'll find the McMahons, 
As through the, etc. 
We are the ladies' favorites 
When we go on parade, 
With stars and stripes and gieen flag flying; 
The colors that never fade. 
In future, should they call on us to fight 
For our homes so dear, 
We'll be the first men on the field, 
The McMahon Grenadiers. 
As through the, etc.

Copyright, 1877, by FREDERICK BLUME. 
I 
TOOK my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare; 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh ! Emma, whoa ! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
I 
ask'd them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream ! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, and this was their reply— 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he look'd at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugh'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commenc'd to cry— 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies, 
Oh ! Emma, etc.

But as she'd nine, I 
begged to decline, 
Her making the tenth of me— 
Very kind, but not for me 
Spoken.—Beside, why shiver my jibboom and capsize my binnacle, 
hadn't I 
already one— 
Cho.-- Whose heart was true, die. 
One day from the sweet Chunkumehoos, 
I 
took to my heels and off I 
ran, 
Contrived to reach dear London's shore, 
Rushed off to find my Mary Anne; 
I 
soon beheld the one I 
lov'd, 
Also her children three! 
And her husband! oh lor'! showed me the door, 
Said, " There was no room for me,"— 
He " regretted " he'd no room for me. 
ipoken.---Why, why was I 
not served up at a 
Chunkumcboo breakfast ? 
sooner than to find mystilf deceived by the on who said— 
Cho.—Her heart was true, die.

THE FIVE CENT SHAVE. 
Written, composed and sung by TOM CANNON. 
On I 
PITI going to tell to you of the troubles I 
went through 
In a 
barber's shop that isn't very far away. 
My beard it being strong, I 
thought ' mould not be wrong, 
To go and have it trimmed a 
bit the other day ; 
And being short of cash, it struck me like a 
flash, 
That five cents was enough to pay in these hard times. 
So I 
went into a 
place, as I 
thought it no disffrace, 
To practice strict economy and save my dimes, 
SPOKEN.— Yes, I 
went into one of these barber's shops, where 
they give you a 
shave for five cents and throw in a 
chronic). 
WeIll the fellow put me into a 
chair and took down a 
small 
bottle off the shelf and was going to put it to my nose. What's 
that'? says I. 
Chloroform, says he. 
I 
didn't come here to have 
my teeth pulled out, says I. 
Oh, well, says he, if you can 
stand it I 
can. 
Go ahead, says I. 
CHORUS. 
So he lathered me, he slathered me, lie bruised me and abused 
me, 
He tore me, and nearly drove me to my grave. 
He tickled me, he pickled me, he scratched me and he patched 
me, 
And I'd rather have the measles than his five cent shave. 
I 
stood it for awhile, I 
tried in vain to smile, 
He talked about the weather as he scratched away ; 
He took me by the hair and held me in the chair, 
I 
thought my days were numbered and began to pray ; 
At length I 
gave a 
roar, says I, I 
want no more. 
Here ! you can have my pocket- book, but spare my life, 
Take all that I 
possess, and finish my distress, 
I 
cannot stand the torture of sour slaughter- house knife. 
SPOKEN.— You ought to see the way he went about it. 
The 
first thing I 
knew he had his knee upon my chest and was 
sawing away like a 
day's work. 
And then he called out to the 
fellow that cleans the spittoon ; here, Emanuel, come and put 
some grease on this razor, I'm stuck. 
Well, between the two 
they finally got it out, and I 
looked in the glass, and by the 
bokey my face was all marked out in town lots. 
What's this 
you have on my face ? I 
says. 
Oh ! well, he says, we expect 
our customers to come back, and that's a 
diagram of the route. 
Well, says I, you may call this a 
clean shave, but I 
call it a 
clean skin and a 
barefaced one at that, and I'll never go there 
again, because, 
So he lathered me, etc.

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung with immense success by HARRY KERNELL. 
OH, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I 
have a 
son that's got me crazy; 
He is out every night singing comic songs 
He learns at some free and easy ; 
He wanted his mother to put on the gloves with him, 
He broke his little brother's leg with a 
poker ; 
He has an old pack of cards he carries in his pocket, 
And he wants me to play Sanco Pedro and the Joker; 
He kicked his sister Honora in the forehead last week, 
He bate the eldest boy of cross-eyed McCarty ; 
He goes prancing around to the Sunday eve balls, 
And he has a 
girl on the stage at the Varieties. 
He pawned my Sunday clothes last week 
To go and lay a 
wager; 
He brought me down town in the middle of the night 
To fight with a 
big black nager. 
There's his cousin Mike is a 
fine young man, 
With the nicest kind of manners; 
Night after night they go walking around, 
And they call it carrying the banners; 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony ; 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now 
And Bernard's in California. 
He tied a 
tin can on our dog's tail 
When we went to church last Sunday; 
He got stiff broiling tight, stayed out all night, 
And was up before the Court House on Monday ; 
He is got the house all turned inside out, 
He has gone to the bad entirely ; 
Some fine day I 
fear he will be hung, 
Lord help you, Bernard Reilly ; 
He says he is taking lessons from Professor John Dwyer; 
He wants pie and sponge cake for his supper, 
He comes home every night full of gin, 
And he throws the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

THE WINNING HAND. 
Words and Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
Sung with great success by GEORGE HUNTON, at Gir.L's, 15 West Homo-

IN 
life I'm certain to succeed, 
Tho' tricks I 
do disdain ; 
I 
know just how to do things brown, 
No matter what's the game. 
In business or society, 
Good hick I 
can command; 
I 
show them all that I 
am right, 
For I 
hold the winning hand. 
CHORUS. 
I hold the winning hand, boys, 
The fates I 
can command; 
In love or strife, and all thro' life, 
I 
hold the winning hand. 
I 
sail'd upon the stormy seas, 
And heard the billows roar ; 
The ship was sinking down with me, 
So I 
thought I'd swim ashore. 
One man began to shout and pray, 
He could not reach the land .; 
"Farewell," said I, " my Christian friend, 
I 
hold the whining hand !" 
I 
hold the, etc. 
I 
heard those saintly gentlemen 
In Ilarnum's Music Hall, 
With all their might, and sense of right, 
For sinners they did call 
I 
heard them singing " Hold the Fort " 
And " Come and Join the Band !" 
Bat I 
belong to Plymbuth Church, 
And I 
hold the winning hand ! 
I 
hold the, etc. 
I 
fell in love, of course you know 
All mankind is the same ; 
My sweetheart was a 
charming girl, 
McGuinness was her name. 
I 
thought she was the fairest flow'r 
That bloomed in all the land. 
Like Cupid's dart, she pierced my heart, 
For she held the winning hand.

But soon there came another chap, 
Who wears much finer clothes; 
He introduced himself to her

S ‘, KrA. Poteen, you deceiver, 
I 
love you just as well, 
Since the day when first I 
met you, 
You threw o'er me a

You're winning, you're enticing, 
As soft as Asia's silk; 
I 
love you, oh, my darling, 
As the baby loves its milk. 
CHORUS. 
Then drink to your neighbors, 
Drink to your friends, 
The dew from the mountain stream; 
If you once took a

Ton my soul you'd never stop, 
A-drinking of the sweet Poteen. 
Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
Yon've enslaved me like a

When brought within my gaze. 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd praise you, oh, my darling, 
To your friends or to your foes.

THE TRUE SONS OF ERIN. 
Sung by JACK CON ROY and GEORGE HUNTER. 
D ON'T be alarmed at seeing us here, 
We are gents of the very first water ; 
Our appearance will show we are noblemen too ; 
And sons of a 
nobleman's daughter ; 
Our mother, God bless her, she doted on us, 
For all her pleasures we made ; 
We are commanders now in the army, 
In the ranks of the Irish Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah ! hurrah for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers who are never afraid ; 
They are true to the core and dare- devil daring. 
The true noble sons of the Irish Brigade. 
We marched to the front with nine hundred strong, 
In a 
line thro' the dead and dying, 
We marched gayly on with the fife and the drum ; 
While the green flag above us was flying, 
Yes, high in the air it proudly did wave, 
Seemingly not afraid, 
For it knew that protection was near, 
From the boys in the Irish Brigade. 
Hurrah I 
hurrah, etc. 
The Irish brigade is both strong and brave, 
For fighting the best in the land, 
And if you're in trouble the true sons of Erin 
Will willingly extend a 
hand ; 
Yes, they will give as long as they live 
One-half of which they possess 
To the needy and poor who come to their door 
With a 
cry for help in distress. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc.

Sung in EDWARD IIArstroAN's great play of " Old Lavender." 
OH, many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule ; 
My classmates, scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there, 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar; 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence 
Are qualities quite fine. 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime ; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days.

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
ONE day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When avoice I 
heard above, saying, Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my 
eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A 
big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said : 
" ' Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse 
each year, 
The laboring men now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert ; 
And our politicians all for their living shout and bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty 
girl !" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said.

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID.— 
Concluded. 
" 
To the demagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
say. 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called 
Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the rich to give the poor ! 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn 
fire ; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were 
dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire de-
plore." 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the election long since gone, none knows which man 
has won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please ; 
Let returning boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all ; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the 
poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall !" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head ; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the 
night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

OH 
I 
one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Going round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work— 
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty calls I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic- when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the 
tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it !" 
And he thought ' twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
IRA I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
" 
You can't go behind me," says I, " now mind me, 
If ye stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all." 
Then the gang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
show'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal ; 
Bight and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for moucy- they began to bawl. 
Spoxnx.—Well, they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name 
is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and more-
over—" 
I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
THE GOAT. 
As Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Now my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait ; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
lie had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
que:r curious way, 
lied go out every morning, and stop out all day ; 
When he'd come home at night, like a 
hull he would roar, 
'Till my father gets up for to open the dour. 
One dny we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate ; 
And without saving a 
word, shore the ould dirty gommagh, 
lie druv his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," 
main," says I, 
"Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now Hwy." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh germ! such a 
murthering„ t
.k

Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at mho divil's own rate : 
lie spied me father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head iu the wall. 
Some time after they went to look for the goat, 
They searched all around. ' till they came to the coat, 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only the sthump of his tail, and it still bucking

THE LESS I SAY OF IT, 
THE BETTER. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Am.—" It's wonderful how we do it, but we do." 
NEW songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've got, I 
think is just the cheese, too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying, by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you may read it in a 
letter ; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking ; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking ; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up town we find that he has net her ; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feelin-i rrIther queer, 
As to where I'm going for to raise some money ; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
I've got a 
darling \rife, 
And she can't live very lowg on love and honey; 
But there's one thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by- and-bye— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better.

MY MARY ANN. 
Sung to great applause by JOHN CONROY. 
OH, I 
have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allanna," 
With a 
voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney," 
She frightens the people all off from the street. 
enoncs. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary ; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she ' tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary—is my Mary Ann, 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre ball, 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla Hall, 
And when she got there, she went straight for the grub ; 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She called for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters ; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
13ut her mouth when it opened her breath was so strong 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
You'll find her at all of the blow-outs and parties, 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all ; 
And when she is at it she goes it so hearty 
That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McNally's one night at a 
party, 
And to make things look lively, she whipped off her 
shoes. 
Her feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all the people clean out of the room. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc.

IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
IN 
the battle of life, if you would win in the strife, 
Should you fail at the start, try again ; 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip, never give up the ship, 
Sunshine always comes after rain. 
Whatever you do, strive to push your way through, 
And keep this sound maxim in mind, 
Fortune favors the -brave, she'll yet come to your aid— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
CHORUS. 
So, if for a 
fortune or fame you may strive, 
Or a 
wife suited just to your mind, 
Go in with a 
will, your time will come still— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Our conductors are fond of milk punches, they say ; 
But the bell punches, they made them sick, 
For the spotters discovered their secret machines, 
They rang under their arms with a 
click. 
Now, the secret is out, and their pickings they miss ; 
Knocking down's almost ceased on our lines ; 
But some Yankee will invent an improvement on this— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
CHORUS. 
Directors are sharp, but conductors are fly, 
They have got these things down pretty fine ; 
They will soon punch this bell punch, and send it 
sky high! 
It is only a 
question of time. 
My friend Jones has been married five years now or so, 
He's the father of five—so they say— 
But what's strange to relate and curious to know, 
I 
have not one, though I 
pray. 
But my mother-in-law says, now don't you despair, 
Fight it out, my boy, on that same line ! 
Dame Nature will be good to you, never fear— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
give this advice as it was given to me, 
If your family affairs are like mine, 
If your house has no heir, why never despair— 
It is only a 
question of time.

I'VE been (irk:king of late, I've been drinking--
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now I'm obliged to go dry I 
Cries the man at the bar: " You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I

You could drink a

Can you wonder the reason you're dry 'I" 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord,

And drink cocktails all night and all day 
But you are like a

You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a

For the rich man you'll make a

While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry 
'Tis true what you say, Mr Landlord,

THE INCREASE OF THIRST.—Continued. 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last. 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend her! 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her— 
Can you wander they're hungry and .dry ? 
Can you wonder Pm dry, can you wonder, 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat! 
There's a 
rounder in the ,corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight ; 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sit . 
That I'm not too proud to drink rum ; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one I 
Go visit the places that I 
take in ; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake hint, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold! 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under ; 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
Oh why will you let me go dry ?

PARODY ON TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
Wribien and Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I wandered by the village, Tom— 
sot beneath the tree ; 
And gazed upon that dear old jail, 
That oft sheltered you and me. 
But none was there to bail me out. 
At least they told me so; 
was not acquainted with the judge, 
Like twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered some, dear Tom, 
Its larger now than then; 
Its cells ore twice as wide, dear Tote, 
To accommodate more men. 
The bell is there that used to ring-, 
When to work we bad to go ; 
The music's just as sweet, dear To 
As twenty years ago. 
'The boss are at the same old game. 
Of hooking on the sly ; 
They stole a 
ham the other night, 
'Twas oft done by you and I. 
They're gambling, too, for money, Tom, 
At seven-up, you know; 
That good old game we loved so well 
Just twenty years ago. 
Down by the spring, close to the elm, 
You know poor William Way.; 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, 
1 
saw him 3-estcTday. 
Some wretch has kicked his stuffing out, 
lie's dying, sure but slow ; 
Just as the one you wolloped so, 
Died twenty years ago. 
Mv lids have long been dry, dear Tom, 
But tears came to my eves.; 
When I 
think upon that good old hairr.1 
And those dear old mutton pies.

But, Tom, I

GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK. 
Words and Music by HENRY C. 
W ORK. 
The Music of this song is published by C. M . 
CADY, 107 Duane St., New 
York. Price 35 cents. 
Mr grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor ; 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, 
And was always his treasure and pride ; 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again-
-When the old man died. 
enontrs. 
Ninety years, without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), 
His life-seconds numbering ( tick, tick, tick, tick), 
It stopp'd short—never to go again-
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendu!um swing to and fro, 
Many hours had he spent while a 
boy ; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
My pc thfather said that of those he could hire, 
Not a 
servant so faithful he found ; 
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire— 
At the close of each week to be wound. 
It was kept in its place—not a 
frown upon its face, 
And its hands never hung by its side ; 
But it stoppil short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
It rang an alarm in the dead of the night— 
An alarm that for years had been dumb ; 
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flig14— 
That his hour of departure had come. 
Still the clock kept the time, with a 
soft and muffled chime, 
As we silently stood by his side ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc.

I'LL never forget the day, my boys, 
We went out on parade, 
Dressed up in uniform so gay, 
Two soldiers for a 
day, 
With the green flag flying o'er our heads, 
The color that never fades; 
When we went up to the National Park, 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade.

We march away so neat, 
With new shoes upon our feet; 
Of the Hoolahan Musketeers we're not afraid; 
And we look so neat and grand, 
With our muskets in our hand, 
While marching in the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
The shooting commenced in the National Park, 
In the afternoon at four; 
Tim Hoolahan won a 
barrel of coal, 
And Murphy a 
barrel of flour. 
Jim Casey won a 
new black hat, 
Dressed out with a 
white cockade, 
To turn out on St. Patrick's Day, 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
We march, etc. 
And when we got home at night, my boys, 
We dressed up for the ball; 
We invited all the regiments, 
The Mulligan Guards and all; 
And during intermission, 
When we drank our lemonade, 
We gave an exhibition drill 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
We march, etc.

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great succe".1. 
Tim world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade ; 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss ; 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
My idea for improvement is this : 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
['hey are willing to toil, let us give them the chance, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too; 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue ; 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done : 
MILD RAGS M eKENNA. 
A PARODY. ON " WHOA., EMMA!" 
Written and sung by Jacti: CONROY., 
I TOOK a 
sail one day 
Down to Far Rockaway, 
And the gang on the boat 
They all did know me well. 
I 
commenced to drink and treat 
Till I 
hardly could hold ray feet; 
But listen and my sorrows I 
will tell : 
SPOKEN.—After the gang got me pretty full, they took 
the hat off of my head and commenced to crown it—as 
they call it. 
But I 
began to think they were taking the 
rim off of it. 
I 
picked it up, and left them, and went to 
the rear part of the boat, where they were playing a 
Yankee game of cards called " Three-card Monte." I 
asked for a hand, and they said only one man held it ; 
but they said to me, " You look like a 
sporL 
Now there 
is the Jack, the King and the Ten. 
Now," he went on, 
"I'll bet you can't pick the Jack out of the three cards." 
Well, he tossed them about, and he turned his back to 
spit out ; with that a 
man marked the card and showed it 
to me. " I'll bet you ten dollars I'll pick out the card." 
" 
Well," says he, " I'll bet you." I 
put down my ten dol-
lars, and I 
grabbed hold of the marked card. I 
declare 
to my goodness, he was sold to the devil, and turned the 
card into an eight. 
I 
walked away feeling bad. 
With 
that the gang opened on me, and shouted : 
CHORUS.-011, Old Rags McKenna; 
Oh, Old Rags McKenna ; 
You will have to gather 
To raise another tenner. 
(Repeat.) 
We at the beach did land, 
I 
walked up to a 
stand, 
And said, let me have a 
big glass of ale. 
" 
Oh, ale we do not sell." 
Lager will do as well ; 
It's stuff that gaugers gather in a 
pail. 
SPOKEN.—There was a 
party of Germans eating at the 
stand. I 
put down twenty-five cents, the man says, " Ten 
cents more," " I 
eat nothing." He says " You drink all 
the same." " No, I'm d---d 
if I 
did ; that is Crosby street 
beer you are selling me." Well, I 
gave him the ten cents, 
and walked away. 
With that the Germans shouted: 
Oh, 011 Rags McKenna, etc. 
W HY DIDN '' YOT.T SAY SO YiEFOREe

Lams 
New by-words you know now-a-daye, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before 1. 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong otse; 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't /ay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before t 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to Tend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rob his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did spy; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before I 
My wife yesterday sat crying sway, 
Because oar first-born was a

Copyright, 1877, by Wm. A. POND & Co. 
GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
Where he told his tales of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake ; 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night—like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm- chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With his silv'ry snow-white hair ; 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, We all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild ; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child ; 
Then grandpa whispered, " Baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate ; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc.

THE PULLING MACHINE. 
Written by PETE CANNON, and sung by JACK CONROY. 
To bother you long is not my intention, 
I'll bid you good-night and be leaving you soon; 
But first let me tell you about an invention 
I 
recently saw in a 
liquor saloon. 
I 
have met with some things that puzzled me greatly, 
And twenty-four years in this country I've been, 
But, believe me, I 
never was caught so completely 
As they caught me one night with a 
pulling machine. 
CHORUS. 
The villain that first studied out the invention, 
Whoever he is, must be terrible mear. 
I'd give fifty dollars for his apprehension, 
And I'd put him to death on his pulling machine. 
" 
See how much you can pull," says a 
man who stood 
near me. 
" 
I'll bet you the drinks I 
can pull more than you." 
Then the crowd all around him began for to cheer me, 
So I 
just took hold, to see what I 
could do. 
The bar-tender sent electricity through me. 
Such dancing and leaping there never was seen. 
My hair stood on end, and I 
swore I 
would murder 
The man who invented the pulling machine. 
The villain that, etc. 
The shock that it gave inc it near drove me crazy, 
It went through my system like needles and pins ; 
They say that my dancing was graceful and easy, 
But some of them got a 
good kick in the shins. 
When the torture was over they called me a 
gilly, 
And they told me that I 
must be terrible green ; 
That I 
ought to know better than be such a 
sucker 
For to dance all my steps on a 
pulling machine. 
SPOKEN.—Says one fellow, " It's only a 
patent for circu-
lating the blood well." 
Says I, " I 
want all the blood I 
have now." 
Says he, " Did you never read where Dr. 
Franklin caught the lightning in a 
bottle ?" " I 
did," 
says I; " but if I 
had the fellow that made that machine 
he'd catch blazes quicker than lightning. 
In fact," says 
I, " I 
think it's a 
shocking machine, and— 
" 
The villain that," etc. 
THE NATIONAL GUARD. 
Sung with great success by CONROY and H UNTER. 
OH, bright and gay is the National Guard ! with colors 
flying free, 
We dash along and grandly parade ; here's none so 
proud as we. 
Our guns we hold in the prettiest line, to catch the peo-
ple's eye, 
With our beads upright and eyes so bright when we go 
marching by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp ! right about we go ! 
The stars and stripes above, so gallantly they flow. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, down Broadway. 
The ladies wave their little hands to see our grand array. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time! march, in our uniform so bright. 
The drums and trumpets play, and fill us with delight 
When we meet to march or fight. 
We take the lead—we do, indeed—the American National 
Guard. 
Oh, still on hand is the National Guard to meet the nation's 
foe, 
And bright and clear their record so fair, which all the 
people know. 
We heed the call of the national voice, and ready lads 
we are. 
At the word of command, with heart and hand, we rally 
near and far. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp ! gleams our banner high ; 
Your heart will beat with pride to see us passing by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, gay lads we, 
To right about and in and out, parading bold and free. 
Mark time, etc. 
Then here's success to the National Guard, and may it 
lead the van, 
And always heed the national call—be ready every man. 
Oh, may it ever its powder keep dry to strike a 
gallant blow, 
While the people love those stars above bright waving to 
and fro. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp ! in the van we lead, 
The people come from far to see each man and steed. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, light and gay. 
We're always ready, rank and file, to meet and march 
away. 
Mark time, etc.

But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
SPOKEN. — This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals 
out : 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
found an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls ; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book ?" 
SPOKEN. — In regard to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, and an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject, 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly over-
look ? 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that 
down on the book. 
SPOKEN. — From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been 
seen ; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can 
look. 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Com-
plaint Book ?"

The music of this song is published by 'Vic PUN'), 547 Broadway, New 
York. 
I'm the father of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly, 
They are their mother's joy ; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop ; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe ; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man die, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say 
don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop.

PAT DELANEY. 
PARODY ON ELLLEEN ALLANNA. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY EL.ACH. 
ME 
name is Pat Delaney, I 
came across the sea, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house way up in Avenue C; 
A family they live next to me, they kick up a 
terrible 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore ; 
First the eldest by and then his youngest brother, 
They all join in the chorus with their sister and their mo-
ther; 
When I 
get home at night, my boys, I 
hear this terrible 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Augus Astore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it is too bad, 
Climbing a 
forty-foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, my boys, I 
hear this terri-
ble roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore. 
Early in the morning before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
eat a 
mouthful, before I 
drink a 
sup, 
I 
hear them in the hallway and then they commence to 
roar 
About their Eilleen Allanna and their Aligns Astore ; 
If I'd influence in the ward in which I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge and have him push this case 
quite strong, 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore. 
Working hard all day, etc. 
CHESTERFIELD M cFLYNN . 
Written by H ARRY BENNETT. 
ALTHOUGH I 
have no money, 
I'm just as sweet as honey ; 
I 
travel on my shape, because 
I'm neither stout nor thin ; 
The girls all say I'm pretty, 
And also wise and witty; 
There's not a 
masher in this town 
Like Chesterfield McFlynn. 
CHORUS. 
By-bye, Charlie, you're a 
pet of mine 
I'll meet you in the clock 
When the lane strikes nine ; 
I'll strike you with a 
gum drop, 
You giddy little lass ; 
I'll sick you with my spitz dog, 
And I'll stab you with blue glass. 
At every evening party 
You'll find me there so hearty, 
I 
never step upon the floor 
Till dancing does begin; 
I 
dance in latest fashion, 
My appearance it is dashing; 
They can't resist the figure of 
Charles Chesterfield McFlynn. 
By- bye, Charlie, etc.

POLITICAL SITUATION. 
Great Big Steamer." 
You have heard the song of the Boulevard 
To go there you must get a 
card, 
And how the poor man works so hard 
From morning until evening ; 
I 
once for a 
man did vote, 
And he gave me a 
bit of a 
note, 
By himself it was surely wrote, 
For to get me a 
situation. 
CHORUS. 
For to use shovels and picks 
On stones and bricks and clubs and sticks, 
And all such tricks they're good for nix, 
And I 
am heartily sick of political situations. 
They gave me a 
shovel in my hand, 
They told me to dig up the land ; 
Says I 
to myself, I'll see you be hanged, 
To work up on the railway; 
This is what I 
did say, 
To work ten hours a 
day 
I 
tell you it does not pay 
lip in a 
Hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc. 
At night I 
lay me down to sleep, 
The Yankee bugs around me creep, 
The divil a 
wink they'd let me sleep 
Till daylight in the morning ; 
Next morning when I 
arose, 
And quickly I'd slip on my clothes, 
And just think where I 
had to go 
Up to One Hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc. 
In Eighteen Hundred and Forty-five, 
When Daniel O'Connell was alive, 
At such a 
job I'd never drive 
To keep myself from starving, 
And now, although I'm old and poor, 
There is one thing that is sure, 
I 
don't want any sinecure 
Up in One Hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc.

SAILING ON THE LAKE. 
Wards by GOSDIAN K. 
HYDE. 
Music by Din, Bnemor. 
th. Music of this song is publiebed by Wm. A . 
POND & CO, 517 Broadway. 
New York City. 
Brice 40 cents. 
Olin day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
lie asked me then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
CHORUS. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (
Repstat 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall; 
We sat and listened to the band 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not lose ; 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see. 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
54 
OF COURSE IT'S NO BUSINESS OF MINE. 
Written and sung by Mu= 
EVE, the successful English Comic. 
SOME people they say that I'm curious, and tell me I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, in getting the latest 
of news. 
Well, I 
certainly own that I 
do so, and therein is no harm, 
I 
opine, 
Whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, for of course it's no business 
of mine. 
(
Repeat.) 
For instance, at Mrs. Montgomery's, a 
gent with a 
big 
black mustache, 
Calls there most every evening, and for Mrs. Montgomery 
does ask. 
He stays till half-past eight o'clock ; Montgomery gets 
home about nine. 
Now I'd like to know what he does there, but of course it's 
no business of mine. 
(Repeat.) 
Now, I 
met young Miss Smith ' tother ev'ning, she was 
taking a 
nice country walk, 
And as soon as she spied me she did commence for to have 
a 
long talk, 
All about her dear little nephew who, she says, is between 
eight and nine. 
Some say that it isn't her nephew, but of course it's no 
business of mine. 
(
Repeat.) 
At Mrs. Fitzgibbons, the baker's, the people are raising a 
din, 
They say that she won't pay her rent, so the sheriff and 
auctioneer's in. 
I 
can't tell what she does with her money, though her nose 
like a 
lighthouse does shine. 
Some say that she spends it for whiskey, but of course it's 
no business of mine. 
(Repeat.) 
Perhaps the song you have just heard you do not think 
is worthy of praise, • 
On the safe side my friends I 
have erred, for a 
laugh I 
have but tkied to raise. 
If you're pleased I 
will sing you another if you call on me 
sonic other time, 
If not pleased, my advice to you is, of course it's no busi-
ness of mine. 
(Repeat.)

SEE THAT MY SOUP'S KEPI! 
CLEAN. 
A 
PARODY ON " SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEL'T GREEN.' 
As originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
W HEN board at your house I 
take, darling, 
As long as my hoard I 
do pay, 
If Bridget is left there cooking the soup, 
For my sake drive her away. 
I 
mind not a 
small tooth comb to find, 
Tears in it she's shed I've seen ; 
But stop that small drop that comes from her nose 
See that my soup's kept clean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my thanks will go to you, darling, 
When boarding no more I'll be seen, 
This one wish, Mrs. Murphy, do grant me, 
See that my soup's kept clean. 
I 
know you can cook a 
nice turkey, 
And sweet is the stuffing to taste, 
But I 
don't like to fish up a 
big cockroach, 
It's such a 
high flavored baste ; 
The rag which you scrub off the kitchen floor, 
To use on the dishes it is mean. 
This one wish you'll grant me, my darling, 
See that my plates are kept clean. 
Oh, my thanks, etc. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
And in the cold grave I 
do lie, 
See the mourners have plenty of whiskey to drink, 
Give the boys lots of old rye ; 
I 
mean when your hash has cooked my goose, 
Get it now thro' your thick skull, 
At my head when the candles are burning, 
See that the gang's kept full. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
sleep the sleep that knows no waking, 
Keep this now in your thick skull, 
At my head when the candles are burning, 
See that the gang's kept full. 
54; 
BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK CONROY, 
every evening, at GILL'S, 13 West Houston street. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty ; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along ; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier ; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc.

Copyright, 1877, by FREDERICK BLUME. 
LAST week my wife said: " Arthur dear, 
I 
should so like a 
change, 
It's rather dull for me at home, 
Now couldn't you arrange, 
To meet me after business hours, 
And then you know we might, 
Just have a 
little dinner, dear, 
And go somewhere at night ?" 
SPOKF.N.—Why, certainly, my popsey wopsey, we will. 
So, meeting with my old friend Brown, he being a 
very 
jolly fellow, advised me to take her to see Pink Dominoes, 
'twill make you roar! It did, with rage 1 
for ever since 
he has done nothing but sing— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, you've settled me for life, 
And why did I 
not see you first before I 
took my wife ? 
She says she's found. me out, and in my face she throws 
All the naughty things they do in Pink Dominoes 
He thought he look'd a 
guilty wretch, 
While everybody roar'd, 
He chew'd his programme into pulp, 
He felt so very bored; 
His wife she sat like all the rest, 
Laughing at the fun, 
Says she, " How could you bring me here, 
To show me how ' tis done ?" 
SPOKEN. — So, that's the way you deceive your poor wife, 
is it ? sending false telegrams, and false letters, like that 
wicked fellow in the play ! and ever since he has been 
singing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc. 
Now should that author cross my path, 
I'll make him use his pen, 
To write a 
big apology, 
To all the married men ; 
And as for Brown, the horrid wretch, 
The cause of all my woes, 
I 
will be sure to pay him out, 
And give him awful blows ! 
SPOKEN.—No, I 
won't, I'll buy two orchestra tickets, 
and send them to his wife, then perhaps he will have oc-
casion to sing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc.

LET'S sing a 
song as we march along 
For the land where the grass grows green, 
Our Em'rald Isle, where lassies smile 
Like a 
bright May morn sunbeam. 
For fighting, or for pleasure, 
We are the ladies' joy, 
For fun beyond all measure, 
Call the bold Hibernian boys. 
CHORUS. 
We're sons of Erin's Isle, free- hearted all the while, 
Happy Irish lads are we who never fear no noise, 
Loyally we stand for dear old Ireland, 
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hurrah ! for the bold Hibernian boys. 
You may search this wide world all around, 
From France to Hindostan, 
Where'er you roam, it's a 
truth well known, 
You'll find an Irishman. 
Quick witted, always ready 
To welcome you with joy, 
It's Jack, Dan, Mike or Teddy, 
Each bold Hibernian boy. 
We're son; etc. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer for Erin dear, 
The home of Thomas Moore, 
O'Connell, and brave Emmet, and 
Such heroes by the score. 
Our country's persecutions 
Old time can not alloy, 
Justice the resolution, 
Of each bold Hibernian boy. 
We're sons, etc.

LAST 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be ; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh ! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears, 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
night I 
was out rather late— 
CHORUS. 
The ' Club" had a 
meeting, to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let rif6 alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.—SO 
I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to assure 
her once more, as a 
positive fact, that— 
The " Club" had, etc.

I 
HAVE a 
darling whom I 
adore I 
When he is near I'm sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart; 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride ; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again, and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me, and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful, and scream out, 
Oh, my 1" 
Kisses are plenty, and kisses are sweet ; 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your loved one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " Kiss me again !"
