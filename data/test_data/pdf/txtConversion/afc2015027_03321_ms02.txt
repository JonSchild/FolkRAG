Christine Lewis interviews Doreen McGill Nash 
Christine Lewis: 
Ready? 
Male: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Hi. My name is Christine Lewis, and I am ... We're here doing the Archie Green 
Grant archiving of the voices for the Brooklyn, together with the Brooklyn Art 
Council, for the Library of Congress.  
What is your name? 
Doreen Nash: 
Doreen McGill Nash.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is your current occupation? 
Doreen Nash: 
I'm a licensed [00:00:30] family daycare provider.  
Christine Lewis: 
All right. What borough neighborhood do you live in? 
Doreen Nash: 
I live in Chelsea, Manhattan.  
Christine Lewis: 
Where are you originally from? 
Doreen Nash: 
I'm from born here in Brooklyn. 
Christine Lewis: 
What part of Brooklyn? 
Doreen Nash: 
I'm Brownsville East New York. I was born in Brookdale Hospital. Then it was 
called Bethel Hospital.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. That's in my neighborhood. I live I Brownsville. 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh, East 98th Street.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 95th [inaudible 00:00:52]. Yeah. I think the board of East New York and 
Brownsville. Yeah? Yep. [00:01:00] How you manage to become a daycare 
provider? Licensed provider [inaudible 00:01:06]? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh, long story short, I had studied in college travel and tourism. I wanted to do 
that. Long story short, 911 hit, and it was no more traveling for a while.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Your field would have been in tourism. 
Doreen Nash: 
I would have. I love travel. I've traveled to Malaysia, Africa, the Caribbean.

Christine Lewis: 
What? [00:01:30] No wonder you wear them African get-ups so nice. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. I try.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. You do it. You do it. You do it.  
Doreen Nash: 
I traveled to Ghana.  
Christine Lewis: 
How long have you been doing this work? 
Doreen Nash: 
Eight years. I've been telling people six, but I've actually been doing this for 
eight years.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's a long time. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
It is. 
Doreen Nash: 
Very difficult to get it going in the beginning. I would get up in the morning and 
go to schools and I had business cards written up, and just run, run, run. You 
have to ... To get it up and running is not easy, [00:02:00] but once you get it up 
and running, it's pretty good.  
Christine Lewis: 
Walk me through a typical daily routine. What are your day to day 
responsibility? Walk me through that.  
Doreen Nash: 
Okay. First I start- 
Christine Lewis: 
As a daycare provider. 
Doreen Nash: 
Start at 7:00 in the morning. They drop them off. I have to do ... I'm required to 
do what's called the daily health check, which means I have to look at every 
child and make sure there are no bruises and stuff like that on them, the 
parents are not abusing them, or anything is going [00:02:30] on in the home. I 
have to do it very indiscreetly. I have to look each child over. How you doing? 
Just look them over. Indiscreetly, to make sure there's no abuse.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's funny that you should mention that, because it segues. I remember doing an 
early childhood course at NYU, and it was one of the things we spoke about. 
When you go to the job, record what you see on the child. I've never forgotten 
it. I don't do it, but it's mandatory, because listen, that child could have 
[00:03:00] fallen down yesterday, broken his hands, and it's mend ... It's not 
good, but it seems like it's mended, only to carry that child to the doctor and 
realize that child's hand has been broken the week before.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right. 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
They could easily say it's with you.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right. Exactly. 
Christine Lewis: 
Answer that question. 
Doreen Nash: 
Exactly. Here's the thing with that. If a child ever comes to you sleeping, you 
wake that child up.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yes, because that child could be ... Have been abused or shaken or 
something [00:03:30] and be in an unconscious state.  
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting.  
Doreen Nash: 
When that child come to you, by law you have to wake them up and make sure 
that they're in well physical form when they were brought to you. There was 
nothing going on. 
Christine Lewis: 
Jeez. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Imagine ... 
Doreen Nash: 
Never, ever take a sleeping child. Never.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Never.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Every day learn something. I would assume that you want the child to sleep.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. And you do. 
Christine Lewis: 
Because you know that child is going to get up and not go back, especially if it's 
a cranky child, and not go back for a while. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Doreen Nash: 
[00:04:00] Yeah, and you do want that child to sleep, but technically, sometimes 
we deal with a lot of single mothers, and they have a boyfriend, and maybe the 
boyfriend ... We just don't know, because people not going to tell you, 
especially when you have children ... I have a lot of children that come from a 
shelter, and there's extenuating circumstances that I don't know about, because 
they don't tell me things, because in their mind, I'm going to run and call HRA 
and tell them, "You know she has a boyfriend? You know this?" Which I don't 
get involved. They tell me what they want [00:04:30] me to know. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
But if she's afraid or if she's trying to work it out with the boyfriend, or the 
child's father. We just don't know what's ... You have to wake that child up. 
[inaudible 00:04:38] Even if that child is a little cranky, whatever, by law, you 
have to wake that child up. It's in your own best interest to wake that child up. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see, because that could backfire as well, because that child could ... Let's 
assume that child come to you with an ailment or an abuse situation.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
That you don't by law, you don't wake that [00:05:00] child up, they could 
almost say that it's you.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let's assume, because you didn't check that child, that parents could come back, 
pick up her child, or his child, and say, perhaps it's you that abuse the child. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Doreen Nash: 
And they do.  
Christine Lewis: 
And they do.  
Doreen Nash: 
They do that, because they have to- 
Christine Lewis: 
To take it off themselves.  
Doreen Nash: 
See, but the person that does that is the person that also is not going to tell you 
they have an active ACS case, which means they're already on them and 
threatening [00:05:30] to take their child, and they've already been reported. 
Somebody, because even if security people, if they live in a shelter or if they 
have a relative, or let's say a custody case. I had a custody case. The father 
wanted the child, and he was always calling and saying that she was doing this 
Domestic Workers United

and that. They had a nasty breakup. She left him and went to the shelter 
system. That happens a lot.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
He could say, "Oh, she's ... Somebody's doing something," and nobody's doing 
anything, but they don't know that, so you always have to protect yourself. The 
only people only gonna tell [00:06:00] you what they want you to know. They're 
not going to tell you, and you just have the know that and operate knowing 
that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Nice to learn ... Every day you learn something, you see? In the school of 
learning, every day you learn. I'm grateful for what you just shared. 
Doreen Nash: 
Okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
What skills ... Is there a skill that you need to be to be ... You need to have or 
know to be a childcare provider? 
Doreen Nash: 
You have to like to cook.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yeah. You have to feed them. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. You have to feed them. 
Christine Lewis: 
We want to see them babies eat right.  
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yeah. You have to [00:06:30] like to cook. You have to be clean. You have to 
go and get toys. You have to stay up on recalls, like if a stroller or a crib, like 
they're always changing the rules. If a stroller or a crib or something like that 
has become dangerous, you have to know that, or a toy that has missing pieces, 
you have to study all of that. 
 
It's interesting that you asked that, because I had a parent last week, she gave 
the child a grape. I said, "Are you kidding me?" She could choke to death. You 
never [00:07:00] give a child a grape. A toddler or an infant child a grape. 
Christine Lewis: 
I'm surprised that the parent don't know that.  
Doreen Nash: 
No. They don't. They just don't always know stuff like that, but we ... Also, it's a 
good thing to go online, talk to other parents and find our, get into the groups, 
the Yahoo groups and stuff, and find out. That's how I found out.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
Wow. On the heels of that question, is there some specialty [00:07:30] or 
expertise that you have that you bring to the table? 
Doreen Nash: 
I have to say yes, because I was- 
Christine Lewis: 
What is that? 
Doreen Nash: 
Working ... A long time ago I joined a group called the Downtown Welfare 
Advocate center. It was started by Anita Hoffman, Andy Hoffman's wife. I don't 
know if you might be a little too young to know him. He's not a yuppie. He was 
one of the people that were in the hippie movement. 
Christine Lewis: 
I heard the name.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. Abby Hoffman. I learned a lot about welfare rights, and fair hearings. They 
were just [00:08:00] starting [inaudible 00:07:59]. That has come in very handy 
when people have difficulties with the system.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're able to help them. Is that what you're saying? 
Doreen Nash: 
Some of them. Some of them are just too far gone. They don't really want the 
assistance. But some of them are able to pull them aside and say, "Pst, do this 
now. Tell them that."  
Christine Lewis: 
Tell them that. Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
So they don't get totally screwed by the system. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh.  
Doreen Nash: 
The way it's set up now, you could very easily be messed over if you're on public 
assistance. There's certain things they have a right to know [00:08:30] that they 
just don't tell them. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's a specialty that you bring. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. That's nice to know though. Would you say that you're an advocate? 
Would you say? Is it safe to say? 
Doreen Nash: 
More so.  
Christine Lewis: 
Right. In terms of the arena of welfare rights.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
Knowing what ... Nice though.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yes, because you have to ... It's a horrible system. Not right at all. You can't get 
on your feet if you don't have the information.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. [00:09:00] Tell me. When caring for a child, what are some of the ways ... 
As we spoke about sleep. What are some of the ways you help them to fall 
asleep? 
Doreen Nash: 
Rocking. I have a rocking chair. Sing to them. My kids love Michael Jackson, but I 
try to focus on the lullaby channel on MTV.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
My kids, oh yeah. They love Michael Jackson. 
Christine Lewis: 
How old are these kids? 
Doreen Nash: 
I have from ... Right now I have two ... A five month old, a seven month old, 20 
month old, the five year old has been with me since he was three months old.  
Christine Lewis: 
Why do they know about [00:09:30] Michael Jackson? That's funny.  
Doreen Nash: 
The love Michael Jackson. They love him. 
Christine Lewis: 
The beat. They single out the beat.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They just like the way, even with like, "You are not alone." They love that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh. And they fall asleep to that? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They fall asleep to that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Aw. It's funny because the kid I care for, I like to sing, "Do your ear hang low, do 
they wobble to and fro?" I have a dog, right? It's a song I sing to my dog. "Do 
your ear hang low, do they wobble to and fro? Could you tie them in a knot? 
Could you tie them in a bow? Could you throw [00:10:00] them over your 
shoulder, like a continental soldier? Do your ears hang low?" Little man will fall 
asleep with that.  
 
Or, the next one is, "Bye baby bunting. Daddy's gone a hunting, to fetch a bit of 
rabbit skin, to put his baby bunting in." And he would look at me, and his steely 
blue eyes will go off to sleep. 
Doreen Nash: 
Wow. 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Every morning I go there and I hold that baby. Whatever I'm singing, not if he's 
sleepy, he may not be, but he falls asleep.  
Doreen Nash: 
Wow. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's interesting. Yeah.  
Doreen Nash: 
They love Michael [00:10:30] Jackson. 
Christine Lewis: 
Every time I sing those three songs.  
Doreen Nash: 
I don't know why.  
Christine Lewis: 
And the wheels on the bus. Yeah. But they fall asleep to Michael Jackson? 
Doreen Nash: 
They fall asleep. Oh yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
They love Michael Jackson. That man is magical. They love him.  
Christine Lewis: 
They weren't in a world when he was around. Could you imagine? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. No, they weren't. That's the funny thing. But he has some really nice, 
soothing, slow songs. That's the nice thing about him. He has a lot of nice, 
soothing- 
Christine Lewis: 
And they fall asleep. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They fall asleep listening to him. 
Christine Lewis: 
So you see? There goes the show. They're not even the lullabies [00:11:00] 
work. You understand me? For years we've been singing those lullabies.  
Doreen Nash: 
Wow. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. That's cute. What are some of the ways you get the children to eat? 
Doreen Nash: 
I play super power games with them. Zoom. I got these little forks that have 
airplanes and stuff attached to them.  
Christine Lewis: 
Fun. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. There's a company called Construction something or other. I found some, 
and yeah, I get these little fancy forks and stuff. I play powers, [00:11:30] zoom. 
Airplane, feeding and stuff. That works for me.  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
[inaudible 00:11:34] little boy too. When he puts his mouth like this, and he do, 
and he go like ... Or he doesn't want to eat. I go ... I take the spoon, I go, "Up, 
up, up, up, ooooooup!" 
Doreen Nash: 
Tell them to have their vegetables. Tell them they give them super powers, and 
that works.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
They like to hear about super powers.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Yeah. Kids like the make believe. That's [00:12:00] nice. What are some of 
the ways you get a child to stop crying or fussing? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh boy. That's- 
Christine Lewis: 
Sometimes they could carry on.  
Doreen Nash: 
You just have to talk them through it. You have to find out what the reason ... 
The older children you can talk them through. The younger ones, it may be 
anything. Teething. I have one child, she goes to Hudson Guild during the day, 
like a preschool, and she's always agitated. Always agitated. I have to really 
work a lot to just talk her through the problems. [00:12:30] I know it comes 
from like sometimes when they're like three, four years old, they're not really 
ready for the socialization process. You have to just understand that she's 
probably having toys pulled away from her. I don't know how they resolve 
differences that come up with the children, but she seems to really be anxious a 
lot. Just have to observe them, and just find ways to talk them through 
whatever is bothering them.  
Christine Lewis: 
Have you ever used any homeopathic remedies or folk remedies [00:13:00] to 
help cure a child who is sick? You know, something that you had from ... We 
come from a, as Caribbean, we come from that generation where we used to go 
outside and pick a bush, or to soothe a kid that was the medicine. It's easy to 
always carry the child to the doctor and they give you antibiotic, will fix the ear 
infection, will fix the teething. Is there any local things that you use? Perhaps 
the mother might come with something and say, "We're giving this child," and 
something you might know from where [00:13:30] you grew up, from whence 
you came with your mother, that you might give to the child to soothe the 
child? 
Doreen Nash: 
I use coconut oil a lot with situations, and also use reflexology a lot, because I 
find that when they're teething, you rub their feet in certain points and rub their 
head a lot, and that makes it better.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. Right. Because I know for us with baby and teething, we would use the 
pumpkin stem. I was telling them the story about the [bead 00:13:57], the 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
9
bother and the bead. That [00:14:00] was new to me. The bead? Remember? I 
think I told you the story of the bead, right? And they still had a bead, like what 
you're wearing there is a burnished kind of a bead, and the bead releases 
energy. I was like, "What?" 
Doreen Nash: 
Wow.  
Christine Lewis: 
What? For teething. A necklace. That was new to me. But I know we would put 
the pumpkin stem and soothe the baby's gum, because it itches.  
Doreen Nash: 
I'll have to try that. Oh yeah. Oh, they suffer like crazy with that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Then also, I think I repeat the story of [00:14:30] the person who bathed the 
baby who had the itch, the eczema, in Epsom salt.  
Doreen Nash: 
Eczema. 
Christine Lewis: 
Baking soda, and it cooled the baby. The parents were almost surprised.  
Doreen Nash: 
I use aloe vera for everything like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
I use aloe vera for any skin- 
Christine Lewis: 
The natural aloe vera? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. The natural, the plant.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Doreen Nash: 
I use that for all of that. 
Christine Lewis: 
On the kids? 
Doreen Nash: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)- 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. It soothes? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. It does good. It does wonders with it. Right away. It works right away. I 
use Shea butter a lot for skin, [00:15:00] and olive oil I use a lot.  
Christine Lewis: 
Is there any special skill you might have toward, in your case, and we're talking 
about domestic work, which brings me ... Let me rephrase this question. 
Because I know that you come through Domestic Workers United, and I'll come 
back to those questions later on, what is the segue, or how different is your 
work from that of a domestic worker? We're all in the service industry. We're all 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
10
in the caring industry. [00:15:30] How close is it? What is the difference, if there 
is a difference, between a domestic worker and a childcare provider in that you 
do? 
Doreen Nash: 
All the difference I see is that ... I don't know what training they get to become 
nannies, but I have to go through state ... I have to have 30 hours every two 
years, which I usually have more than that. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Doreen Nash: 
Because there's several ways to get training. You can get training online, or you 
can go outside to courses, or they have video conferencing that you can go to a 
classroom setting, [00:16:00] and then they'll give you a test, but they stay up 
like how to deal with children with trauma, how ... I just had a course on infant 
brain development, showing you all about how the infant ... Ways to help them 
be smarter and not ... Also use baby learn to read flash cards, all of that.  
 
I'm not familiar with the nanny training, but I now our training is extensive. Also, 
inspected. They come out and they see what you're doing. You're not allowed to 
let them watch television all day. You have to have ... If the television [00:16:30] 
is on, that has to be something that they're learning. Have to prove that what is 
one is ... What is he watching that for? Is it ABC's, 123's? Colors, numbers? You 
have to have a reason. They don't want children just sitting in front of television 
all day.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see. The reason I ask what is the difference between the domestic work and 
the childcare provider that you do in the home, in that you're still giving care 
though. For yours, as you [00:17:00] outlined, it's kind of [academic 00:17:02] in 
terms of the learning, the structure of learning. 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
About early childhood development, right? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
For the baby. But you're doing the same work of putting Pamper on a baby, 
bathing the baby, caring for the baby. It's just that line, that little gray line, that 
says ... It has to be certified by the city, right? 
Doreen Nash: 
By the state, and also they have, they can have duties like they get a chance to 
go out of the [00:17:30] country and it's a state and stuff with their parents, and 
that's a perk that I wish I had, because I love to travel. Sometimes I meet them 
in the playground, "Oh, we're going away next week." 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, you mean the nannies? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
11
Doreen Nash: 
The nannies go. Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see what you- 
Doreen Nash: 
They get to travel. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see what you're saying. Right. Okay. There's a slight difference.  
Doreen Nash: 
There's a lot different.  
Christine Lewis: 
But you do the same caring. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, we do the same. We even compare notes sometimes in the playgrounds, 
what they do and what I do. You give them water? No, because the mother 
didn't tell [00:18:00] me to give them water. We have the same ... I never give a 
child water without parent, because it could kill them if they're not old enough. 
To have water. 
Christine Lewis: 
You see now, thanks for telling me this, because I didn't know this. I thought 
when a baby is born at a young age you give them water.  
Doreen Nash: 
No. 
Christine Lewis: 
But I've learned, I've recognized that it's not until after six months.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
I was a little paranoid, because the baby wasn't getting ... To me, I felt like the 
baby wasn't getting enough breast milk. The mother wasn't giving the baby 
formula. Do I give the baby a little bit [00:18:30] of water? To sustain the baby. 
But then I read something about this water thing, but for me, I thought people 
were giving children water, because water is sustenance for life.  
Doreen Nash: 
If they eat baby food, that's prepared with water, and the milk also, the regular 
milk, I only had one ... My first baby was breastfed. Now that was a funny 
situation. He was breastfed. The very first baby I started with was a girl that, I 
watched her grow up. I had no idea that I was going to be taking care of her 
child. I saw her pregnant going up to visit [00:19:00] a relative, but long story 
short, her child was breastfed. She couldn't get any bottle that he would take, 
that she tried to find a nipple that was better.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
What she had to do, I had to feed him up until he went to sleep, and then when 
she got home from school she would breastfeed, and he would not drink any 
milk during the day.  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Doreen Nash: 
That was really ... I had no idea that babies could even do that, go all day 
without milk. That was the only was she could survive. Honey also. They can't 
[00:19:30] have honey. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Doreen Nash: 
Until a year old. It's something in it that could kill them.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. I know about the honey. Which brings me, is there any special skill that 
you might have taught your parents? Those parents that you work, bring their 
kids to you? 
Doreen Nash: 
I try to share with them anything that I have learned. Like you say, homeopathic 
stuff and stuff like that. I try to share with them anything. They seem to need 
more help in areas of jobs, housing, and that's [00:20:00] what I love more than 
anything in the world, is finding jobs for people. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. I know that. 
Doreen Nash: 
I try to help them out in that area, the ones that need it. Basically they're on 
their own with that, but if I can clue somebody in and they're really struggling, I 
try to help them, if I can. It's not always possible.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is the best part of your job though? Give an example. 
Doreen Nash: 
I help a lot of people. It's a lot of people that don't have strong families.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
I'm able to really make a difference in their life. 
Christine Lewis: 
How so? Give an example. [00:20:30] Give me something concrete, sustaining. 
Doreen Nash: 
Okay. I had a woman that was ... It's the same one ... He's been with me since he 
was three months old. She had a real bad custody situation. He was trying to 
take the son from her. She was almost close to a nervous breakdown, really. I 
was able to just be there for her, be that shoulder for her, because she was 
really ... She's a former foster child, and she always wanted a child. The 
marriage breakup was nasty, but [00:21:00] he wanted his son. That was it. He 
tried to really try to take her son, but he wasn't able to, but it was really hard 
watching her crying all the time and calling me.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is that thing that you tell her that made her feel ... Because we always 
want to-

Doreen Nash: 
Tell the truth. When you get in front of the judge, tell the truth. Just tell the 
truth. Don't ... Look at the judge. If you have to jot notes down, dates, times, 
instances, what you spent, [00:21:30] how you managed to hang on to him, 
even though you didn't have secure housing. Look at the judge and tell the 
truth. That's always worked for me. That's what she did.  
 
As a matter of fact, it was so deep, a social worker even told her, "When you go 
to court next week, they're going to take the child. I'm not supposed to tell you 
that, but they're going to take him. That's why they told you to bring him." She 
went around a whole week thinking that she was getting ready to lose her son. 
It was mind-blowing.  
Christine Lewis: 
I would think that's [00:22:00] difficult.  
Doreen Nash: 
Girl 20 years old. She was 20 years old. 
Christine Lewis: 
Foster child.  
Doreen Nash: 
The mother? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Doreen Nash: 
And then coming from a foster system. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. Coming from a foster system, having a child and dealing with the system, 
and sometimes who we are shouldn't define us, but by the courts alone 
sometimes, depending on who the lawyers are, it's already a stigma, because 
you're foster child, and what could you do? You're 20 years old with this child. 
All these things you have against you. Good for you, though. 
Doreen Nash: 
She made [00:22:30] it through. I don't know what she told that judge, but the 
judge said, "I don't see no reason to take him." Since then, they were able to 
work out a reasonable visitation. They get along nicely now.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
I was really happy for her, because she really had me going, worrying about 
that. It was so ugly.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is the worst part of your job? 
Doreen Nash: 
Here's the thing now. When people get angry at you, I just had to discharge 
someone because she was always coming late. Another one, she had [00:23:00] 
a very problematic childhood, which I understand and I really tried to assist, but 
if somebody is coming all the time five, six hours late, seven hours late, I can't 
deal with that. It's not fair to me. It's not fair to my family. It's no good for the

child. People don't come on time. Then some of them, they got the nerve to 
want to call a false ACS complaint on you, because- 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
On you? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
You are the childcare provider. 
Doreen Nash: 
She hit my child.  
Christine Lewis: 
Because they want- 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, because they want [00:23:30] payback, because they don't want to go to 
another babysitter, because they're used to you, and the child is used to it 
there. I take my kids out daily, even if we only go to an indoor spot. Even if it's 
raining, I try. They really like it there. When they want to jam me up, then call in 
a false complaint on me, on with the 800 number.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
That's the downside of it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Only for telling her don't bring the child late. 
Doreen Nash: 
I can't deal with this. You can't come back. After a certain number of times. 
Then you have to give them warnings.  
Christine Lewis: 
What [00:24:00] is late for you? When your childcare begins? 
Doreen Nash: 
An hour late. I start at seven. I try to end at six.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
I think that's fair. That's enough time for anybody.  
Christine Lewis: 
She's coming beyond six.  
Doreen Nash: 
Are you kidding? Oh, that's the ... I had a woman abandon a baby on me.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
Oh. 
Doreen Nash: 
I had to make the call if I wanted to ... I'm supposed to right away call the police. 
They come and take that child. I didn't want to do that, but I did after three 
days, I called the child's [00:24:30] grandmother down in Ohio, and she said, 
"No, please. Don't put my grandson away. I'll get somebody to come and get 
him." She did. She got somebody to come. I don't know how she got in touch 
with her. She had her phone off and everything, but she called around, she got 
somebody to come and get the little boy. Then the mother had the nerve to call 
me back and ask me, "Could you take him as a foster child?" I said, "No."  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, she didn't want this child? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. No, she can't take care of him. See, here's the thing. She had a job 
[00:25:00] working in an aids clinic from four to twelve, but she was living in a 
shelter. She went and switched her overnight, twelve to eight. I said, "Let me 
tell you something. Don't do that. You're making a bad mistake. Do not ... Stay 
with the four to twelve. Do not do no overnight shift. They got cameras in there. 
They gonna see you sleeping. They're going to fire you." That's exactly what 
happened. I knew it. I told her. Then she wanted to leave the child on me, and 
the funny thing, she was the one, she was [00:25:30] always mad at me because 
she felt like I didn't ... I wasn't affectionate enough towards her child, like I were 
the other children in my ... But he just came to me. It takes time to bond with 
children. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course.  
Doreen Nash: 
Can't just be hugging. That would be phony.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Doreen Nash: 
It takes time to really get close to them.  
Christine Lewis: 
Although I dote on children. I have a dog, and it's the same way I feel about the 
dog. I don't know if this is a parallel, but the way I like my dog is the way I like 
children. I'm always kissing my dog, and I'm always kissing the children. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, but you didn't have that in one day, right? 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:26:00] I look at a baby and I melt. I'm like a big baby. I looked at ... All the 
kids I've worked with, I looked at them and I just melt. Because they're 
innocent. You're right. The baby ... Clearly this baby is coming from a place of a 
little lack of love, because the mother is busy trying to hustle, whatever that 
means. This baby, you are the caregiver. You're right.  
Doreen Nash: 
No, but see, it's different when you got one baby. You got four kids in there, and 
then one [00:26:30] comes in brand new, you don't really know him. You 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
16
already know those other two. Have a history with those other children. I don't 
really know this ... I'm not going to be all over him like I am the children ... It 
takes time. She was always mad because she felt like, "Oh, you ... I don't know 
why you ... You don't do my son," because I know, I seen this child be born. I 
know this child already. Then she going to turn around, leave him on me. 
Christine Lewis: 
She left him for three days? 
Doreen Nash: 
She wasn't coming back.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you. [00:27:00] Let me go further. Have you ever followed up with 
this baby? Where is the baby? 
Doreen Nash: 
He's in Ohio with his grandmother.  
Christine Lewis: 
Not with his mother? 
Doreen Nash: 
No, no, no, no. She couldn't take care of him. 
Christine Lewis: 
She abandoned him? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. She couldn't take care of him, so the mother took him to Ohio, and he's 
there now.  
Christine Lewis: 
It breaks my heart though. Childcare.  
Doreen Nash: 
I've seen [bad 00:27:16] things.  
Christine Lewis: 
The complexities of childcare. 
Doreen Nash: 
Unbelievable.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. It breaks my heart.  
Doreen Nash: 
Unbelievable what we go up against.  
Christine Lewis: 
I say this to say we're not respected in an industry.  
Doreen Nash: 
No. Not at all.  
Christine Lewis: 
We're not [00:27:30] ... That's right. We're not respected in an industry, but yet 
we're as mothers, and I say mothers, we are up to give care to these children as 
our own, even [inaudible 00:27:40] from our own. Those of us who have little 
children. My daughter is grown, but the way we dote on these children who 
aren't ours, it's amazing. It's really amazing. Here we're giving this kind of love, 
we're extending, and we're not being paid for it though.

Doreen Nash: 
No. 
Christine Lewis: 
We're not being compensated for it. 
Doreen Nash: 
What I don't understand is this. I get [00:28:00] $30 dollars a day per child. In 
Albany, they get $100 and something dollars a day. I don't understand that.  
Christine Lewis: 
In Albany? 
Doreen Nash: 
The same job. By locale. It goes by locale. If you live in Albany- 
Christine Lewis: 
The capital? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. You do the same work that I do, the exact same work, they get more 
money. That's what I don't understand.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. You get $30 dollars a day. 
Doreen Nash: 
$30 dollars a day per child.  
Christine Lewis: 
For one child? 
Doreen Nash: 
Unless I have a private child, that's not [00:28:30] associated with HRA or ACS in 
any system, but HRA and ACS pay $30 dollars a day per child, which is nothing. 
Christine Lewis: 
You're not getting any other pay on that $30 dollars a day? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. No.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
They've been trying to raise it, like union lobbying and stuff, but it hasn't been 
working, but in Albany they get $100 dollars a day. I don't understand that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Are you with a union? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. UFT. With the UFT.  
Christine Lewis: 
Federation of teachers? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Christine Lewis: 
[00:29:00] Interesting. There's a new dynamic right here right now. Wow. $30 
dollars a day. 
Doreen Nash: 
$30 dollars a day.  
Christine Lewis: 
You can't really live? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. You have to have four or five children. To get my student loans and stuff 
paid up and all my expenses that I had when I wasn't working, before I was 
doing well with it, I had to really have like five, six kids a day, just to get my life 
back, so that I could be debt-free. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Again, let me segue into this question. Then a domestic worker [00:29:30] 
makes a little more money than you? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They make more money. Yeah. They make more money, but I wanted to 
be at home. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
Because I didn't want any restraints on leaving, like if the mother, if she ... 
Sometimes they have difficulties with their ... Some situations ... A lot of the 
women, they're happy, they're treated well, and the salaries are good, they get 
car fare, lunch money, and stuff. But I didn't want to take a chance on ... 
Sometime when you're a little older, and they want somebody really young who 
they can dictate [00:30:00] to. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see what you're saying. 
Doreen Nash: 
This works out better for me. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. It's a trade off. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
I get it. The comfort of your home. You've been in the comfort, as opposed to a 
parent being over you, and really dictating. You can move at your own pace. I 
see. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right. I can set the pace of the way things go. 
Christine Lewis: 
All right. What is your relationship with the parents who come to you? The 
parents? 
Doreen Nash: 
Very good.  
Christine Lewis: 
Very good. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Doreen Nash: 
Very good. [00:30:30] Oh yeah. One of them took me on vacation to Camelback 
Lodge.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's nice.  
Doreen Nash: 
One of them just made me a dress from the Gambia, which I love. Her mother 
made it for me. Another one bought me a laptop. They give me extra money 
and stuff. Oh yeah. It's very good.  
Christine Lewis: 
Right. But would you say that ... I don't know if this might sound a little 
redundant. Is HRA your employers as well?  
Doreen Nash: 
ACS. Agency for ... All HRA does is they can accept, like there's a form that they 
have to fill out proving [00:31:00] that they need daycare, because they don't 
give it to everybody. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. ACS is your employer? 
Doreen Nash: 
ACS. 
Christine Lewis: 
Is your boss? 
Doreen Nash: 
Agency for children ... No. Not really the boss. The state licenses me, but my 
paycheck that I get from the HRA children is paid from ACS.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Male: 
What is ACS? 
Doreen Nash: 
Agency for ... What is it? 
Christine Lewis: 
Child service? 
Doreen Nash: 
ACS. Agency for children's services. In New York, they call it ACS. Other states, 
they have a different name for it. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. Wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
[00:31:30] Mine is ACS.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see. Those are the same people who comes in if there's an abuse situation? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. Well, yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, man.  
Doreen Nash: 
ACS. Yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
20
Christine Lewis: 
I think it's- 
Doreen Nash: 
It's a different area of ACS.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see, because we always have this ongoing joke.  
Doreen Nash: 
Investigative- 
Christine Lewis: 
Be careful how you treat the child, because ACS will come in.  
Doreen Nash: 
No, but they going to come in anyway if they get mad at you and they lie on 
you, they going to come in anyway. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh my word. 
Doreen Nash: 
But they're used to bogus complaints. But the thing is, [00:32:00] you gotta have 
to ... You have to prove, and now they stay in your life longer than they do, 
because they have a very bad reputation for not recognizing when abuse takes 
place.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Yeah. I've understood that. Even on the ACS, some abuse has gone 
undetected. 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
All right. What are the relationships with some of the children you have cared 
for that are pretty much memorable? In a [00:32:30] good way or bad way. 
What is it that stays with you from the kids that you care for? You know there's 
always something in memory, whether it's good or bad. Explain. Tell me. 
Doreen Nash: 
Being able to make a difference in their life, because by the time they're two, 
I'm working with ABC's, 123's, phonics, flash cards, all kinds of ... I even have 
then on YouTube, doing YouTube. There's a lot of good educational stuff, so I 
have them on YouTube because what I heard now is that they're leaving them 
back in the kindergarten if they don't [00:33:00] know ... And it bothers me 
when I see children, like I have a child now and just got over after school, four 
years old, she don't know how to read, write, colors, numbers, nothing. All they 
do is baby her.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
When that, when she goes to school next year, she's going to have a problem, 
because teachers are under a lot of pressure, and they resent those children 
that just haven't been ... There's so many resources, ABC Mouse, all these 
resources that people still sitting around not preparing their children for school. 
What happens is, those teachers are just not ... I think I would be the [00:33:30] 
same way if I was a teacher.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
21
Christine Lewis: 
I'll tell you something. What I think about that though, having a background in 
early headstart too myself, I think that in America there's a pressure for children 
to compete at such a young age, because even though I had a headstart, my 
daughter didn't go to school until she was about five. Well, four. I really didn't 
care for her to go to school so young either, because I really wanted her to be 
home.  
 
Then I sent her out to school after a while. [00:34:00] She went to school in the 
states at five, at five-and-a-half. She went to Headstart I think. But I couldn't see 
the need to push, for children to compete for schools at four and five. They're 
already competing already, three, four, five mothers are still trying to get their 
children in preschool. Could you imagine? It has become so [classy 00:34:21] 
though.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. It's real bad.  
Christine Lewis: 
It is real bad.  
Doreen Nash: 
Real bad.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. When you talk about this little four or five, this four year old who's going 
to have [00:34:30] a hard time, what will you say to that parent though? Do you 
talk, have a conversation with that parent? 
Doreen Nash: 
Well, she just started with me, so I don't really want to play the heavy, but 
eventually I'm going to have a conversation with her about what you're doing 
right now, you should devote more time, because with my granddaughter even, 
she was like your daughter. We didn't want her in school. Headstart, none of 
that stuff. But what we did- 
Christine Lewis: 
You taught her.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, we taught her, but listen to this, how we motivated her. There was two 
people in my building, [00:35:00] they can't read, so they can't go no place, 
because they can't read how to get back. 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. There's two of them. One is from Pakistan, the other one I'm not sure 
which country she's from, but she can't read at all. I said, "You see that? That 
could be you. You'd better learn this." 
Christine Lewis: 
How old is she? How old is your grandchild? 
Doreen Nash: 
She's 24 now, but this is when she was three and four. She didn't want to be like 
that, so she learned to read. Just watching Learn to Read. I don't think that's on 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
22
anymore. She learned [00:35:30] the vowels and the letters and what they 
meant, just form Learn to Read. It used to come on PBS.  
Christine Lewis: 
Could I tell you? I'm an [inaudible 00:35:36] literacy teacher, and that's a very 
important point that you bring, that the people who read couldn't come back. 
Couldn't go out. Wouldn't know how to come back. It's important that every 
sign, and New York is filled with signs, that we have to have our children read 
them, because it's really important. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
I think it's how much percent of the world population can't read and write, 
[00:36:00] but they could figure money. You know why they could figure 
money? By feeling. An illiterate person know that if you give them ... If they give 
you $20 dollars, and you got to take five, they're going to get back five dollars, 
five ... Three five dollars, which is $15 dollars. They know it by [inaudible 
00:36:18], by feeling and touching. It's interesting that you bring that- 
Doreen Nash: 
We also use the [slavery 00:36:22] incentive, that we couldn't read, and that's 
why the people that could learn how to read, they did better, even [00:36:30] in 
slavery, than the people in slavery that couldn't read. We took her to the African 
film festival so she could see there's a lot of films. There was this slave that he 
sold himself back on the plantation so he could teach the slaves how to read, 
because he got to read. That was really motivating for her.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, that's nice. 
Doreen Nash: 
Watching that film. I wish I could think of ... I'll get the name of it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Doreen Nash: 
There's a film about that. That was really ... She was so proud of him making 
that kind of sacrifice, just to be able to slip in at night [00:37:00] and teach the 
slaves how to read. With all of that ... I can't do all of that with my kids 
[inaudible 00:37:06] just don't have enough time and I don't have a car to take 
them out and around.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see what you're saying. 
Doreen Nash: 
There's a lot of ways you can motivate them. What's going to happen if you 
don't learn how to read. It's not going to be good. And do math, and science. 
And they have to write.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Is there anything memorable with any of the kids? I know you were 
outlining a bad situation about the mother.

Doreen Nash: 
He's still with me. You've seen him [00:37:30] on Facebook. He's still with me. 
Xavier [Mutusin 00:37:32]. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. What is memorable about him? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh, well, so many things. I was teasing him yesterday. When he was a baby, he 
would not lay down. You'd lay him down, he would jump right back up on his 
skinny little legs.   
Christine Lewis: 
He wouldn't sleep? 
Doreen Nash: 
He would not sleep. The thing with him, he don't like to be in a room by himself 
at all, even to this day. To lay him down, I have to have him in the room with me 
and just talk him through. He does not like to be in a room by [00:38:00] 
himself.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do you feel like the amount of hours you work and your holiday schedules have 
been respected? You kind of answered that, because you said this woman who 
would come late. That's our whole disrespect. But do you feel like it's violated, 
or people pretty much adhere to your rules? 
Doreen Nash: 
They pretty much adhere. I got one or two that they almost like family 
members, so I don't really consider them to be just chronic- 
Christine Lewis: 
They don't advantage [00:38:30] your time. Because come on, you're daycare 
provider from seven to six. After time, you want to go out.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
You have a life too. Apart from daycare.  
Doreen Nash: 
Especially in the summer.  
Christine Lewis: 
What happens if that ... How are you able to [inaudible 00:38:41]? 
Doreen Nash: 
Sometimes if I tell them, "You'd better be back here by 6:00." They'll do it. But if 
I just, I'm not on point with my own personal calendar and stuff ... If I don't tell 
them, that's my fault, but if I tell them, "You'd better be back here today, 
because I have to go uptown to a [00:39:00] video conferencing," or something 
like that, they'll do it. But if I don't tell them, then ... But if I'm really strict with 
them, they'll adhere to it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Right. How about holidays? 
Doreen Nash: 
No. I don't work no holidays.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, you don't work on holidays? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Doreen Nash: 
Hm-mmm. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, you established that.  
Doreen Nash: 
One that I used to do it for, because she works in a restaurant, and that's ... 
They don't get days off like that. I had somebody wanted me to babysit today, 
that same one that just came that she was not really ... No, no, no. I am not 
taking that child to Brooklyn with me. 
Christine Lewis: 
You want your holidays.  
Doreen Nash: 
I have a course to go to, and then I have [00:39:30] a meeting, and I'm not 
taking her with me, but sometimes I waver, but it's not ... I try not to work 
holidays and weekends.  
Christine Lewis: 
I know this question may not apply, may apply. Would you say that you or any 
worker that you know has been exploited due to immigration status? Do you 
have any ... Or do you have any employers who come to you, who are from any 
foreign lands, and have to deal with immigration issues? 
Doreen Nash: 
It doesn't seem to be as bad as it used to be, because I have had people from 
Africa. I got [00:40:00] one that she's from the Gambia. They don't seem to be 
stressing her. I've had several of them, several women from Africa. They don't 
seem to bother them. I haven't had anybody from Jamaica or any of the 
Caribbean places, but I have had women from Africa, and they don't seem to be 
afraid or anything like when I was a little girl, I remember and they used to run 
under the bed when they say, "Immigration." I don't think that's the same. No, 
they did. They would run under the bed, because they was so sacred, [00:40:30] 
but now- 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. Because I grew up on Saint John’s Place, between Schenectady and 
[inaudible 00:40:35]. I knew about ... Yeah. I saw, and I heard stories, and I went 
in people's houses, and I know what happened. Yeah, they used to be very 
afraid. I haven't had any experiences like that myself, no. 
Christine Lewis: 
Immigration. Run under the bed. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, they would run under the bed. I'm telling you. I [00:41:00] seen this.  
Christine Lewis: 
Chris, is that on tape? Oh. That's ... Yeah. It's interesting that you say that 
though, because I think in 1986, '85, '84, a domestic worker was undocumented, 
there was laws to protect that domestic worker. In the States. It's interesting 
that it's shifted, but there were laws ... Until ... I think there was a new 
immigration act that came [00:41:30] in. I think ... I don't know if it's under 
Reagan, but I think 1984, '86. You're going to come here with a visa and work 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

anytime, and go back home as usual, and come back and work. Yeah. It's 
interesting that you talk about- 
Doreen Nash: 
Won't they make you leave? Because I had a friend- 
Christine Lewis: 
The laws were not strict as it is now. 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh. Okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
People were coming and going. People were coming. Yeah, come on. Caribbean 
people were leaving Trinidad to go on ... As a matter of fact, there were jobs for 
strawberry workers in Canada. A lot of people ... A lot of domestic workers 
[00:42:00] ... I remember this as plain as day. In the tabloids, used to have, do 
you want to work for family in United States? 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
A lot of people came and got the papers through working for families.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right. It was a legitimate thing to do. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Doreen Nash: 
It was completely legitimate. 
Christine Lewis: 
And they got their papers here. People were coming every time. People left 
Trinidad to come to work in the states for diplomats, for various families. I used 
to read it, and I was like wow.  
Doreen Nash: 
In the south, too. That's how my grandmother came here from North Carolina.  
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. They came up- 
Doreen Nash: 
They came ... [00:42:30] They got some kind of way they got in touch with her, 
and she got in touch with them, and they had a contract that she would come 
and live with the woman and clean the house and stuff.  
Christine Lewis: 
But it's funny how you talk about- 
Doreen Nash: 
Then eventually she got a factory job, my grandmother.  
Christine Lewis: 
You talk about immigration.  
Doreen Nash: 
I know about that.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's a big boo-boo, right? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
26
Doreen Nash: 
No, I know about that. Uh-uh. Know about that. Definitely. 
Christine Lewis: 
They run under the bed. Do you have anything from your cultural nuances or 
cultural or heritage that you share with the [00:43:00] family, whether it's food 
or folk tale or way of life that you share with your kids? And their parents? 
Doreen Nash: 
Not especially, because there's so many different situations with the racial 
makeup and stuff of my kids.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
I don't really ... I notice one thing though. They like to watch Roots. I had that 
on. Like to watch that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Before you talk about Roots, what's the makeup, the ethnic makeup of the kids 
who come to you? 
Doreen Nash: 
My other baby, I have [00:43:30] one now ... Okay. She's straight up American. 
The other one is straight up American. The other one ... The older girl is ... She's 
... Oh, God. What is this? The mother is from the Gambia and the father is 
Mexican. What they call that? Blexican? What they call that? Blexican? No. 
There's a word for it. Blexican. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I know.  
Doreen Nash: 
She told me. 
Christine Lewis: 
You're right.  
Doreen Nash: 
Then Xavier is ... Let me see. He's part black, Hispanic, and the father's from 
Trinidad.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. I [00:44:00] don't know how you call that one.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. I don't know what you call that. I guess African Caribbean.  
Christine Lewis: 
But they like Roots? 
Doreen Nash: 
African Caribbean. Oh yeah, the like Roots. The music on this one is good 
though. The music- 
Christine Lewis: 
I haven't seen it. 
Doreen Nash: 
This one, the music is good. They work the more spiritual stuff in it from Africa. 
They work ... This one is good. 
Christine Lewis: 
You allow them to see it too? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
27
Doreen Nash: 
I was going back ... They want to see that again, but I was just going back and 
forth to try to see, because I love [inaudible 00:44:25] so I was trying to see her 
role in it [00:44:30] and what ... Like [chicken 00:44:30] George.  
Christine Lewis: 
They were looking. 
Doreen Nash: 
They liked that music, man. That music is better than the first one. They loved 
that music, man. I wasn't going to watch it with the, but I said, "Let me just see." 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Doreen Nash: 
Because it looked like they did a very good job choosing, and I love Forrest 
Whitaker. I love him.  
Christine Lewis: 
I hear you talk about cooking. What is the foods that you cook that they like? 
That's from your culture.  
Doreen Nash: 
Casaba, okra, tofu. I don't like [00:45:00] to give them a lot of red meats, so I 
give them the vegetarian meats.  
Christine Lewis: 
The soy. The chunks.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. The soy chunks. And pasta. They love pasta.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, but it's funny you talk about the okra. The okra and the casaba. Those are 
real cultural roots. Food from Mexico. The yucca. The casaba for the Trinidadian 
kids, casaba is a root crop food. The okra is a real southern staple, African 
staple. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. They eat it? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They eat it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Get out of here. 
Doreen Nash: 
They don't know the difference in [00:45:30] the regular meat or the vegetarian 
meat. But the mentors don't want them having beef, and I never [inaudible 
00:45:36] pork. But I give them macaroni and cheese and stuff like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's funny because kids are a little skeptical when it comes to green stuff, like 
okra. You talk about okra. Even the casaba could be [inaudible 00:45:49], but 
they enjoy the casaba? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, they like casaba.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
28
Christine Lewis: 
Is there a way that you cook it? 
Doreen Nash: 
I steam it, and I put carrots with it, sweet vegetables with it. I steam mine.  
Christine Lewis: 
And the [00:46:00] okra, how you do the okra? 
Doreen Nash: 
Okra, I put I tomato sauce, because if they see it, they won't eat it, but if you 
mix it- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's my point. 
Doreen Nash: 
With other vegetables, they will eat it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yes. Green sweet peas.  
Christine Lewis: 
They're non-discriminating when they ... Right.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They don't like okra by itself, but if you put corn and lima beans, the big 
butter beans. You have to hide it in. You have to hide it.  
Christine Lewis: 
You have to ... Right. That's how I do it with the kids too. Things like broccoli, I 
salt it in a Chinese style rice, [00:46:30] and they eat it- 
Doreen Nash: 
Mine like broccoli. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, but children could be discriminating when it comes to certain food. 
Doreen Nash: 
They don't like green stuff eventually. 
Christine Lewis: 
They don't like green stuff. It's kind of bitter. Let's be real. Green stuff could be 
... Even for you- 
Doreen Nash: 
It can be.  
Christine Lewis: 
If I don't spice up my greens, I won't eat greens, because it could be so bitter. 
But we want those are the chlorophyll. 
Doreen Nash: 
Spinach is important too though. Spinach is important. 
Christine Lewis: 
You had to get it in the kids' diet.  
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. You have to hide it in with the- 
Christine Lewis: 
It's iron, right? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
29
Doreen Nash: 
Potatoes or something. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. You have to ... Yes.  
Doreen Nash: 
Sweet potato. They love sweet potato, but you hide it in. You have [00:47:00] to 
hide it.  
Christine Lewis: 
Again, I reestablish the fact that you start work from six and you end at seven, 
and you end at six. How balancing ... How do you balance your life? And family? 
And your work life? More so, having ... Let me tell you something. Early 
childcare, raising children, is not easy. 
Doreen Nash: 
No, it's not.  
Christine Lewis: 
Doing it for a number of years, I know it's not easy. The older you get, it 
becomes harder. You have a life. Especially if you're an active person. How 
[00:47:30] do you balance that? Especially after having kids from six in the 
morning to ... Seven in the morning to six in the evening. You don't want to see 
a next child. You want to be by yourself and in your own thought. How do you 
balance that? How do you do that? 
Doreen Nash: 
I try to keep events going. I'm on Facebook, so I'm in a lot of groups. I try to 
keep ... I try to make enough money so that I can cab it both ways. There and 
home. If it's in Manhattan, or even Brooklyn, I can cab it, and as long as I don't 
have to go [00:48:00] up and down them train steps, I'm fine. But it's have my 
clothing ready when they leave, things start at seven and eight. I usually go out. 
In the summer and spring, fall, it's easy to go out. 
Christine Lewis: 
I know you came today. I know you came today, the public works play. I was 
wondering how you did that. How does the last child leave? For you to come up 
there to that? 
Doreen Nash: 
She picked him up at six. Then I just was washing up and stuff. I had my clothes 
laid out. I just got out the house.  
Christine Lewis: 
I [00:48:30] see. Are you a member of other organizations or groups? 
Doreen Nash: 
Other than BWU? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Doreen Nash: 
Let me think. What am I a member of? Well, childcare groups, like NAE. There's 
various childcare groups that I have membership in. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. How you call it? NE what? 
Doreen Nash: 
[NAEFC 00:48:51]. National association for family daycare.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
30
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Doreen Nash: 
There's various ... There's a lot of different groups, childcare [00:49:00] 
consortium, different groups like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
When you're doing your daycare work, do you feel part of a larger group or 
community? 
Doreen Nash: 
I do.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's the who? Who? 
Doreen Nash: 
That's the nannies in the neighborhood, the mothers, and stuff in the 
neighborhood.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see. Right. Again, coming to domestic workers united meeting, right? 
Doreen Nash: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)- definitely. That's the best part.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's nice to hear you say that though. 
Doreen Nash: 
That's the best part. It can be very [00:49:30] alienating doing this.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Doreen Nash: 
Even the other daycare providers, sometimes they don't really want to bond. 
They feel like you want their kids. Even like the neighboring organizations like 
that, the other preschools up ... I don't want your kids.  
Christine Lewis: 
Everybody to themselves.  
Doreen Nash: 
Everybody feel like they ... I don't want your kids.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see what you're saying.  
Doreen Nash: 
I try to share with them information. Some of them go outside and pay money 
for courses that you can get for free.  
Christine Lewis: 
I hear you. 
Doreen Nash: 
They don't read the papers. You have to read all of those papers.  
Christine Lewis: 
Of course.  
Doreen Nash: 
That you sit down and read those. They're pushing to [00:50:00] the side 
information that they could ... That's going to benefit them. I try to share the 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
31
information with them. They act like, oh, I'm so new, because she might talk to 
one of my .. I don't need your kids. I really don't. 
Christine Lewis: 
They're very [covetous 00:50:10]. 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. They're very competitive.  
Christine Lewis: 
The [inaudible 00:50:13]. Tell me, when and why did you become a part of 
domestic workers united, and how did you hear about it? Considering that you 
are licensed and you are part of the UFT, united federation of teachers. I'm 
curious what made you become a part [00:50:30] of domestic workers united. 
I'm really curious. 
Doreen Nash: 
I came to a march, an immigration march, as a matter of fact, with DWU, but 
nobody said nothing to me, so I didn't say nothing to nobody, but then I met a 
woman in the playground on 22nd and 10th. She approached me. She said, "Do 
you know about Domestic Workers United?" I said, "Sure." She said, "Would you 
want to come to a meeting?" I said, "Oh yeah, I'll go." 
Christine Lewis: 
All right.  
Doreen Nash: 
That's all. I went to the meeting because I wasn't doing nothing. It gets 
alienating. Like I said, just let me try this and see what happens. I just [00:51:00] 
been there ever since.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. What you like about ... What make you keep coming back? 
Doreen Nash: 
It is nice. Everybody is nice. I know when I was living in Brooklyn, there seemed 
to be some resentment. I was a little bit hesitant, because it seems to be some 
resentment with Caribbean women and American women. That they feel like 
that I know that they used to have this thing Americans all they do is they just 
waste they damn money. I used to hear [00:51:30] them say that a lot when I 
was a child. They seemed to feel like they were a lot different. But, here what 
saved me, and my best friend that I had in this world was from Saint Croix. That 
woman, she did me so good, better than anybody in my family ever treated me, 
so I never could buy into that. I know people are, people, my CPA, she's from 
Barbados. She has helped me a tremendous lot. I never could completely buy 
into that.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're right. They were only stereotypes [00:52:00] about the Americans.  
Doreen Nash: 
Competition. There's a lot of ... I never did completely understand it, except that 
I knew that ... Oh, I'm sorry. A lot of the situations that they grew up under were 
different, even though the American lifestyle is a lot of hardship also. 
Christine Lewis: 
The lies that were told though, the stereotype lies that were told- 
Domestic Workers United

Male: 
Let me just fix this really quick. 
Doreen Nash: 
Sorry. I just- 
Male: 
No, no, no. It's okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
I don't know why I started pulling on that.  
Male: 
It's okay. Because it's annoying.  
Christine Lewis: 
You get to ... She got into the conversation.  
Male: 
Great.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. I know [00:52:30] there's a lot of stereotype about, right, the Americans 
are lazy. The African Americans are lazy. The Caribbeans people will come in to 
take their jobs. They don't want to work. That breed a lot ... I understand that 
that bred a lot of tension between Caribbean and American, or American and 
the rest of the world, because they felt like the Americans weren't doing the 
jobs, so the outsiders, the Mexicans, the Trinidadians, the Caribbean folks, the 
Latin Americans, were coming in. They used to refer to us as ... The [00:53:00] 
Americans would refer to us as the sons of ... Could I say this on the TV? 
Male: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
The sons of bitches, SOB. When they call, they have an SOB, they say you're son 
of a bitch who come to take their job. But all that is stereotype and nonsense. 
I'm just curious that you came back to- 
Doreen Nash: 
I was a little bit hesitant, because even my own daughter told me, "Why are you 
going over there with them? Don't try too hard with them, because they'll ..." 
I'm like, sometimes, when I feel afraid, I have a tendency to try a little bit too 
hard. My daughter's like, "Don't try too hard with them, because you know, they 
don't like you," [00:53:30] and this and that.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's not true.  
Doreen Nash: 
I'm going anyway. I'm not going to listen to that, because it's not true. 
Christine Lewis: 
We've been fed that though. It's not true. 
Doreen Nash: 
I know.  
Christine Lewis: 
We've been fed that about each other. 
Doreen Nash: 
That's just the way it's antagonism.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
33
Christine Lewis: 
Of course.  
Doreen Nash: 
I don't completely understand it.  
Christine Lewis: 
To divide a people though. It's to divide us though.  
Doreen Nash: 
Right. 
Christine Lewis: 
And we're doing the same job though. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's a form of division. 
Doreen Nash: 
That's what I told her. I said, "I'm doing the same thing they doing. I meet them 
in the playground. Some of them are nice, and some of them when they notice 
that I don't talk the way they talk, then they clam up." But [00:54:00] that is just 
life.  
Christine Lewis: 
Human nature.  
Doreen Nash: 
I've been to Jamaica, so I understand some of it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you, and I know this mightn't apply to you, but what it meant to you 
when you hear that the domestic workers bill of rights was passed? What did 
that mean to you? 
Doreen Nash: 
It should have been. It should have been passed, because it's legitimate work, 
and it should have been passed, so I was happy about it. 
Christine Lewis: 
What would you like to see happen in the future with the bill of rights? What 
would you like to see happen? 
Doreen Nash: 
I would like to see more benefits added to [00:54:30] it. Holiday. You don't get 
paid for holidays. And the exploitation needs to stop. I met a woman in Central 
Park, and she was telling me how, even when the people that she worked for, 
on their days off, they want her to come in. They don't want to take care of their 
own child. These are doctors and neurosurgeons and stuff. They just take 
advantage of people. The woman got her own children. I think there should be 
things on the book that you should be able to fight back against people 
exploiting you like that, and [00:55:00] without that you have to worry about 
losing your job. Somebody, they should be more advocacy. This woman got five 
kids. They want her to come in just because ... I'm not saying that every parent 
is like that, but I've heard of enough situations. There's nothing but exploitation. 
They just take advantage of people. 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Could I tell you this? A friend sends me a job. This week. She said to me, this is 
what, it's on my phone somewhere. She said, "A woman is looking for 
somebody to work for her, and the person must [00:55:30] be 45 and under." I 
find that was a little discriminatory. 45 years and under. You understand? Come 
on. What does 45 look like. There are 50 something year old woman who look 
younger than 45. 
Doreen Nash: 
My daughter ... But even still, I can see, they want somebody that can run up 
and down the park with their children.  
Christine Lewis: 
But do they need to say that though? 
Doreen Nash: 
No, but they get away with it though. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. I have it in my phone to be able to show somebody, because somebody 
had asked me, "Do you know people who discriminate?" And I want to keep 
[00:56:00] it in my phone to show to this person, but I give it to somebody, and 
the person I give it to is more than 45 years old. I say, the person needs her job, 
I say, "Try the woman. Call the woman and see if the woman ... See what will 
happen." 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah, but you know, employment agencies do the same thing.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
They got it down to what color they want the person to be that they send. 
Christine Lewis: 
Height, size and everything. 
Doreen Nash: 
Height, size, what the employer ... You can't ... You're really not gonna ... 
Because they doing it in the real life, they doing it. They telling them what they 
don't want to [00:56:30] see, they don't want braids, some of them. They don't 
want this and they don't want that. It's just ... You can't really ... Even like, say 
like, if you work at a job, a regular job, they're not supposed to be able to say 
something bad about you if the new employee calls for a reference. How we 
know that's happening? How can you prove that they really doing that? They're 
only supposed to be able to discuss your work performance, and your salary. 
But how we know that they doing that? You can put [00:57:00] laws on the 
books, but how do you make sure that they are being followed through? That's 
what I don't understand.  
Christine Lewis: 
That's why we go back to file for bill of rights.  
Doreen Nash: 
How do you know they doing that? You don't really know that they're doing 
that.  
Christine Lewis: 
You can't gauge. You can't gauge.  
Domestic Workers United

Doreen Nash: 
We don't know what two people are saying to one another on the phone about 
you. She came in late and I didn't like her because she was a troublemaker, or 
she was getting everybody agitated, or telling everybody stuff when they ... She 
didn't follow. You just don't know what conversations are [inaudible 00:57:26]. 
Christine Lewis: 
From your perspective, why [00:57:30] is domestic workers united important for 
domestic workers? 
Doreen Nash: 
Because we have to unite. It's legitimate work. Anything that gets paid, people 
get paid to do, is legitimate work. It's going to always be around. I think there's 
going to be more. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. You know what I say when people say, talk about the degradation of the job 
and the inferiority of it? Do you know? That we grapple with? I like to say that 
God created the universe. He created it in seven days, right? Every day he 
[00:58:00] looked at the firmament he created, he called it good. It has to be 
good work. 
Doreen Nash: 
Right. It is good. 
Christine Lewis: 
It is good work. Giving care to somebody's child, daily, the job you do, that job 
that make other people work that they could play and [inaudible 00:58:11] good 
job. It is important, as you say, it's really important. 
Doreen Nash: 
I don't fault nobody. If somebody had the money and they can pay for 
somebody to take care of their child, I don't really resent them for that. 
Everybody didn't get the same blessings from God. [00:58:30] But if somebody's 
life is so that they can pay for somebody to take care of their child and clean 
their house- 
Christine Lewis: 
Why not? 
Doreen Nash: 
I don't resent them for that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Doreen Nash: 
That's just the hand that they was dealt.  
Christine Lewis: 
Are you ... I think you answered this in parts, in some of the areas of the 
question I asked, because you said you think we could go for more. I'll still ask it 
anyway. Are you happy with the bill's impact? 
Doreen Nash: 
I think there should be more in it. I really do. I don't think there's enough in it, 
there's enough protections, and people don't ... I think there should be more 
accountability, more advocacy, [00:59:00] and there should be more in it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Right. You outlined it before. What would you want a legislator to know?  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
36
Doreen Nash: 
Pay domestic workers more attention. Give them more attention and protect 
them more. There's rich people want to run up and down, let them be more 
accountable and be more responsible towards the people that work for them. 
You've got even celebrities that they're derogate their workers and I read about 
it. [00:59:30] It's just horrible. Slap their workers and they don't pay their 
workers and they threaten to send them back. I think they should be more 
accountable to domestic workers, because every day I hear horror stories. 
Internationally. It's an international business. There should be more laws on it. I 
don't care how much money somebody got. They shouldn't be able to just 
harass somebody and pay somebody under what they should be paying them, 
and got them doing extra work, because they don't talk English good. They 
shouldn't be doing that. I think that [01:00:00] the government should be 
involved with making sure they get more protections.  
Christine Lewis: 
What skills ... What areas of education or skills are you looking to gain at this 
time of your life? 
Doreen Nash: 
Oh boy. Probably how to get paid to travel. Ways to get paid to travel. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's education? The travel, where you want to travel to? 
Doreen Nash: 
All over.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Doreen Nash: 
I like beautiful beaches, so anyplace that has a beautiful beach and [01:00:30] ... 
I know there's a lot of international things too happening, and some countries 
that I don't want to see, that I read about, that I don't want to see, but just to be 
able to get away a little bit more. Maybe do some travel writing. Stuff like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Nice. What skills ... Coming to DWU, what have you learned? What type of 
training? What skills do you think ... Coming to DWU, what do you think you 
have learned? Is there any skills that they have given you? 
Doreen Nash: 
I have to have CPR [01:01:00] and all of that stuff anyway, so I know how to dig 
for that, just online and UFT makes it available on the other childcare 
consortium. Stuff like that. There's a lot of them. I'm mandated, I have to have a 
certain skills every two years.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Doreen Nash: 
I have information about things like that anyway.  
Christine Lewis: 
I'll rephrase that question. Coming to DWU, what do you think that you get from 
DWU?

Doreen Nash: 
I don't feel as alienated as I did. And I get to go out to the theater and I 
[01:01:30] keep trying and get in a play, but that hasn't worked out yet.  
Christine Lewis: 
I now, right? 
Doreen Nash: 
I love theater. I always loved theater.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me bring it into question here. What role does ... As you talk about theater, 
what role does the cultural component to DWU, or how is it an asset to the 
movement? The cultural part, as you talk about the theater. What other areas 
[01:02:00] of DWU? 
Doreen Nash: 
I'm writing now. I'm writing and performing now. I performed at the Penn World 
Center Festival. Everybody that I invited was so proud that they never knew I 
had it in me to really write and get up and speak like that. That was a good thing 
too. The writing. And the theater component. I'm going to get in a play one day, 
but it's just hard for me. It's hard for me, because I don't like to play the heavy 
with people. You better get in here by 6:15. That is hard for me. 
Christine Lewis: 
You have [01:02:30] to allow a leeway, because you know something? You tell a 
parent six, they might come 6:30. You might bend. You might want to go out. 
6:15, you're right. It's kind of like a given and take. It's kind of like ... You want to 
be a little bit lenient too, but you're right, you don't want to tell them ... It's a 
discretion thing, however. If your child at that daycare from seven in the 
morning to six, come on now. You want to go, but you don't want to ... 
Doreen Nash: 
But I got some of them that they just started [01:03:00] working and, "Oh, can 
you stay late?" They can't say no, because they don't want to get fired.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. You understand. 
Doreen Nash: 
One girl, she's been a home health aide. Now she's a medical assistant. It's very 
demanding. They don't seem to be too organized where she's working. She just 
can't ... She's scared to leave, because she just got herself an apartment. You 
don't want to get fired. It's a lot of situations like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Even with a domestic worker too. It's a give and take. 
Doreen Nash: 
You don't want to get fired.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. I could see that happening, because a domestic worker, you know why they 
want to go home. [01:03:30] You kind of bend.  
Doreen Nash: 
You're kind of scared to go home.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're being flexible. Flexibility is what keeps you in the job too.

Doreen Nash: 
there you go. That's what I was telling my daughter.  
Christine Lewis: 
If I ask for tomorrow, because somebody else will come up and say, "Well, I'll do 
it. I'll do it." You might be out of the door. 
Doreen Nash: 
You have to be a little bit ... You can't be- 
Christine Lewis: 
Flexible.  
Doreen Nash: 
Too rigid. Until somebody keep coming two, three, four, five hours late. Then 
I'm pissed.  
Christine Lewis: 
Of course.  
Doreen Nash: 
Then I'm just- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's disrespectful now. 
Doreen Nash: 
I'm just ready to kill somebody then. They keep doing it. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's disrespectful. 
Doreen Nash: 
That's what happens. You take people, [01:04:00] okay, identify, people have 
bad hardships in their childhood and all that. I understand that, so I try to, but 
you can't ... Uh-uh. Some people are just ... They're just not responsible.  
Christine Lewis: 
Doreen, I'm talking to you, but you bring- 
Doreen Nash: 
They're not responsible in regard, they just don't want to ... They want to take 
opportunities that they shouldn't take. You don't have to go on that date. You 
tell them you'll see them next weekend. You don't have to try to pick up on that 
date right then. And your child ... I'm sorry. You don't have to do that. People 
just keep taking liberties [01:04:30] and stuff that they shouldn't take, no. I only 
had to kick three people out in eight years. I'm glad.  
Christine Lewis: 
Doreen, we have come to the end of our interview, which I ... You made me 
laugh. You still take me back to the immigration story about the immigrants 
hiding under the bed.  
Doreen Nash: 
Brooklyn. You know all of that.  
Christine Lewis: 
I used to hear those stories.  
Doreen Nash: 
Oh yeah. I witnessed them.  
Christine Lewis: 
Hiding under the bed.

Doreen Nash: 
I seen it. Oh yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
It's funny. I'll ask you, is there any last word you want to leave for the listeners 
who might [01:05:00] tune in to listen to the voice of a domestic worker/ 
daycare provider? Is there any last word that you want to leave us with? 
Doreen Nash: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
The listener. Anything you have to say. 
Doreen Nash: 
Pay attention. Don't ever look down on nobody, because you don't know where 
you're going to end up in life. You just don't know where you're going to end up. 
I seen people, one day they was up in the sky, the next day they groveling. You 
just don't know where you're going to end up. Don't ever think [01:05:30] that, 
okay, this is my dream job. I might not have to ... I would never have to do that. 
Because you can't say that. You just can't say ... Have respect for everybody, the 
work that they do. Be interested in everybody. Listen to everybody. Try to learn 
from everybody. Be open to other people's experiences, because don't ever 
think that you're set in a job, a regular job, and because you just don't know 
what you're going have to do. You couldn't have told me that I was going to be 
doing this, but now I'm glad, because I get to help other people, but always be 
open-minded. Be [01:06:00] fair and be open-minded in life.  
Christine Lewis: 
Thank you. 
Doreen Nash: 
yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Thank you. 
Male: 
thank you. Great job.  
Christine Lewis: 
Thanks Doreen. Thank you. Yes. That was ... Yeah.  
Male: 
That was really ... That was really- 
Christine Lewis: 
Mind-boggling, right? 
Male: 
Yeah. And also
