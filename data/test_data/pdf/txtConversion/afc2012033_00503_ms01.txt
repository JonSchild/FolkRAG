HH: So this is January 30, 2013, I’m Hannah Harvester from Traditional Arts in Upstate New York. And 
would you say your full name for the recorder? 
TS: Tom Schultz. 
HH: And we’re here in your home in West Martinsburg, in the town of Lowville. 
TS: Yes. Well actually, it’s in the town of Martinsburg. My mail address is Lowville, but this is 
Martinsburg. Named after a famous 1812 general, General Martin. 
HH: Now could you start out by just giving a little bit of your personal history, where you were born, any 
education or other jobs you did, things like that. 
TS: Well, I was raised in New Hampshire. At a very young age, about 10 years old, my dad gave me a 
Guernsey calf. I just begged and begged for this calf. And up the street a ways there was a man, Mr. 
Dole, and he had three Guernseys. But he used to peddle milk retail in glass bottles. He’d sell all the 
milk. So I got acquainted with him. That’s how I got started. And my calf grew up and she calved. So then 
we had Vicky and Roxy, and I kept them there with Mr. Dole, and that’s how I got started into dairy 
farming. You see my dad was a field representative; he was in charge of the National. He was a field man 
for the American Guernsey Cattle Club and his territory was New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and 
New York. I don’t— I’m not sure whether he was in charge of the whole country but anyhow this was his 
territory. He was gone half of the time, so Mr. Dole was like a surrogate father. Mr. Dole had four 
daughters and I was the son he never had. And that’s how I got started in dairy farming. I wanted to do 
it since I was in second grade. Fact I wrote a little story, this plumber noticed I was doing something 
other than what I was supposed to be doing, and she asked me what I was doing and she said, “May I 
read it?” Oh, she was really impressed and as a reward she made me read it in front of the other— it 
was just a given that I’d go to University of New Hampshire (UNH) and we called it Dairy Husbandry 
then. And that’s what I did. And I graduated on a Saturday and I joined up, left for Paris on Marine boot 
camp on Tuesday. So I was in the Marine Corps for three years. I spent most of my time in Hawaii 
(laughs). In the 105 Howitzer outfit. We were a brigade, it was a small lightning division. They could fly 
us out of Hickam ‘cause we didn’t have tanks, just artillery and infantry. We could go anywhere in the 
world.

(0:04:15)  
HH: Now when was this?  
TS: It was from ’54-’57. Korea had ended. So my Battery CO wanted me to re-up and I just said, “Sir, I’ve 
always wanted to be a dairy farmer.” And he said, “Well, I wish you the best, son.” But otherwise I 
would have stayed in. I liked ‘em. I really liked the Marine Corps. I’m still active in the Marine Corps 
League. 
(0:04:45)  
HH: So what was it about dairy farming that attracted you so much? 
TS: Well, I don’t really know.  I don’t know why, how I happened to want this calf, and I begged and 
begged and my dad for my tenth birthday. My grandfather—maybe it was partly genetics—he was, my 
Grandpa and Grandma Kennedy, they farmed in Bloom County, Iowa, 320 acres and they were grain and 
livestock farmers. But I was the only grandchild that had anything to do with farming. We had seven 
boys and none of them were interested. I never knew grandpa, he died before I was born. I don’t know; 
it was a good choice. 
(0:05:53)  
HH: This Mr. Dole was a next door neighbor? 
TS: Well he lived about—he was about the third place up. Later on he expanded and he had seven 
purebred Guernseys and he delivered milk retail in bottles. As a little side bar, you’re familiar with the 
play Our Town? Well the locale was Peterborough, did you know that? 
HH: No, not off the top of my head, no. 
TS: Well the locale was Peterborough. And the colonists, as we called it, they’d come down from the— 
there was the Edward McDonald Colony for Aspiring Artists. He was a composer. 
(talk of the colony) 
TS: And Mr. Dole was the inspiration for the milkman. 
HH: Really? 
TS: Yeah, it was his inspiration for the milkman. But they used to walk down to the village and about that 
time Mr. Dole would be delivering milk. Oh— Howie Newsome was the milkman in the play. And 
Peterborough also has a summer stock theater, Peterborough Players. And they run this play over and 
over, naturally. And one time Mr. Dole took the part of Howie Newsome! 
HH: Wow! 
3 
 
TS: He didn’t need any practice. And his daughter Dottie donated the milk bottles and—they had metal 
carriers back then.  
HH: I’ve seen them because my grandpa did deliver milk. 
(talk of the Dole girls—outstanding family, smart) 
(0:10:17)  
HH: So can you, just so I have a point of reference, what year were you born? 
TS: ’32. 
HH: Okay.  
TS: So we got kind of sidetracked here, but I remember Dottie said, “Our parents didn’t push us.”  It was 
just expected that we would excel.  Mrs. Dole was really smart—Mr. Dole was too—she taught school. 
(0:10:49)  
HH: Mr. Dole, now he was the milkman. That was his primary occupation or did he have other jobs? 
TS: He was janitor of a central school and janitor of the church. There wouldn’t be enough income from 
just seven cows. 
HH: That’s what I was wondering. 
TS: We used to put all the hay in loose. 
(0:11:10)  
HH: So you helped on the farm with the cows. 
TS: Oh yeah, I helped him, yup. Put in the hay loose, cut it with a 5-foot sickle bar mower, used to put it 
in loose. And we spread the manure by hand, load onto a wagon by hand, spread it by hand. See the 
New Hampshire and Vermont barns were built so that there’s a full cellar. They were about 200 years 
ahead of their time as far as manure storage. Now they’ve got elaborate structures for manure storage, 
but they had a big full-sized cellar and the manure went there in the winter. We never went outdoors in 
the winter. In the spring we’d fill up the wagon and we spread it by hand because we didn’t have a 
spreader ‘cause that takes two horses and we only had one, Charlie. I don’t know how I—it was a good 
choice. Then went I got out of the Marine Corps, then I went to grad school at K State. Applied for 
Extension. Well there was another fella in the same office. He was working on his PhD and he was from 
New York State Extension. And he said, “Well why don’t you apply to be a county extension agent?” I 
said, “Okay.” So I did. And I was assigned to Delaware County. We had about 600 active dairy farms, 
now I don’t think—they’ve got maybe three. And that’s how I happened to meet my wife. I made a stop 
at this Jersey farm and she happened to be home from Syracuse. She was a smart lady. Going to 
Syracuse on academic scholarships. When we decided to get married she told her advisor that she was 
4 
 
gonna drop out. But she’d been accepted to Forestry College, which is male dominated. But she had the 
grades. Her great uncle kind of encouraged her to pursue this particular line, ‘cause he was head of the 
department at Wisconsin. He said they had a good department at Syracuse, well the head happened to 
be my colleague. We were classmates. So she applied and was accepted. When we decided to get 
married, he just shook his head says, “Young lady, that’s a waste of a fine mind.” She said later it wasn’t, 
because our four boys are all real smart. And while at Syracuse—are you familiar with the name Ernie 
Davis? 
HH: No. 
TS: He was a famous football player for Syracuse. 
HH: No, I’m not too good on football players. 
TS: Ernie Davis, The Elmira Express. There’s a movie about him.  
(talk of Ernie Davis— nice guy, died young) 
TS: I get off— 
(0:15:30)  
HH: Well that’s all right, it’s interesting for me. Tell me how you came to this farm? To Lewis County? 
TS: Well, okay. I was an extension agent for 11 years. 
HH: In Delaware County. 
TS: In Delaware County. And one year we had a dairy tour, two busloads of dairy farmers came up to 
Lewis and Jefferson Counties. We had bought a 30 cow farm, but it hadn’t shipped milk in several years, 
but we wanted to live out in the country. We bought this dairy farm, beautiful setting, beautiful house, 
nice barn. So I raised heifers and boarded some heifers. Then I later put up a freestyle heifer barn. I had 
boarded and owned like 68 heifers. 
HH: And this is still in Delaware County? 
TS: Yes. My wife vowed she would never marry a dairy farmer. Well she didn’t. But she could see the 
handwriting on the wall. ‘Cause we’d go over to her father’s and I’d help him do Saturday chores. And 
when we got back from this dairy tour I said, “You know, Lewis County is where I’d really like to be.” And 
these were her exact words. She said, “Well, you’re no spring chicken. If you’re gonna farm it, if we’re 
gonna farm it, we better get busy at it.” And so we were able to sell our farm and buy this farm up here. 
That took—we had four sons, 3-8. I had a good job with Extension, all the benefits, retirement, health 
insurance, vacation. And to go sail out on uncharted waters. There’s a big difference between a pay 
check and a milk check. That took so much guts and courage on Peggy’s part [chokes up], ‘cause she 
knew this was what I wanted to do. She said, “Let’s go for it,” so we bought the farm. And from day one 
she pitched right in. She used to help milk and she loved tractor work. She was good at it, too. You know 
5 
 
we never had a major breakdown. We never had a major—she said, “You know if I break something up, 
you know who’s gonna pay for it, you and me.” If it hadn’t of been—if Peggy, Mike, Joe, Jim and Tim 
hadn’t of pitched in—it was a family farm. If it hadn’t of been for them, I wouldn’t have lasted a year. 
(0:18:55)  
HH: So when was this that you bought the farm? 
TS: ’73 we came up here. That took so much—she could have justifiably said, “Look, let’s just play it 
safe.” There are so many uncertainties in dairy farming. Like I say, there’s a big, big, big difference 
between a milk check and a check from Cornell. I think of all the things that might have gone wrong, as it 
ended up, she really enjoyed being a farmer’s wife. She was very active in farm organizations. She was 
director and secretary and office manager of Farm Bureau for like 25 years.  Our home was—back then 
the counties were more concentrated. Now I think they have a regional office. But each county had its 
own office and she was in hosting club, she was show clerk of the hosting show. They gave us that 
trophy, that clock there. The clerk runs the show, not the judge. All the entries would come into her and 
she’d have to sort them out, because we’d print a booklet. And the clerk runs the show, not the judge. 
All he does is places the animals. And she was active on the school board two terms. She said, “That’s 
enough,” and let someone else— in fact the lady I worked for, she took over from Peggy on the school 
board. One time I think there were five farm wives on the school board. One was the President.  
(0:21:14)  
HH: Did she grow up in a farm background? 
TS: Yeah. Her dad had a 30-cow Jersey herd. She had village friends and she had farm friends. After she 
got up here, she pitched right in. She used to help milk. That was the only barn chore. Myself and our 
sons we did all the other barn chores. She was a good tractor— 
(0:22:00)  
HH: Now you mean she did the maintenance on the tractor or she was driving them? 
TS: No, no. [laughs] That was one rule. It better have fuel and the fluid levels better be—the hydraulic, 
the crank case, the transmission fluids, radiator, power steering—they better be full because I don’t 
know what a grease gun looks like and I don’t intend to—When she got on something, it was expected 
to be ready to go. She was in WIFE. Women Involved in Farm Economics. It’s national. In fact one year 
she was the president of the New York chapter. She used to go over to the conventions all over the 
country. I guess it was in September, maybe. And in 2009, the New York chapter hosted the National 
convention and they dedicated the meeting to Peggy. 
HH: Wow. 
TS: That was the year she died, in 2009. And she was on the Extension program committee. She really 
enjoyed the farm organization activities. Like I say, back then all the memberships came to the county. 
6 
 
She handled all the membership monies. Now it’s regionalized. I’m out of it now, so I don’t—and she put 
out a newsletter, a Farm Bureau newsletter. And she wrote a newspaper column. She really—she was 
the straw that stirred the drink. [laughs] When we moved up here, we brought—I had purchased 12 
short yearlings, purebreds in ’72, fall. And then at the county calf sale, Mike, Joe and I purchased four 
more. So we had 16 purebreds. And they were the foundation of our registered herd. 
(0:24:53) 
HH: It’s sounds to me that for you—tell me if I’m wrong— that the calves and the cows and the animals 
themselves that were one of the biggest attractions for you for farming. 
TS: Oh yes, yup. We had purebreds and we showed. But it was a family— Now the boys tell me, “You 
know dad, we’re glad.” They used to whine and complain ‘cause they all had their chores. But Peggy and 
I decided they were going to learn how to work and how to take responsibility. And Peggy says, “I’m 
always glad we raised sons on a farm.” And they tell me now, “Dad, we had a good— at the time we 
used to whine and complain occasionally.” They had a good time. They had the whole farm to— they 
had a go cart and bicycles. They fished. And they were involved with the cattle too. All of them except 
Mike used to show. Jim used to show. He raised a beefer one year. But they learned how to work and 
they learned how to take responsibility. Because when you’re dealing with animals, it’s 24/7. And they 
depend on you for all of their needs. These are two valuable lessons. Plus the fact that work isn’t 
something to try and get out of. There’s a certain amount of work— it’s noble. It’s worthwhile. Not to 
mention the fact that it’s necessary for survival. These are some of the things I learned from Mr. Dole. 
Some of these values. He was a hard worker and we enjoyed our work. Sure it was hard work and we 
enjoyed it. We learned these values and passed them onto the boys. Dottie is cognizant of this and it 
pleases her.  
(talk of Dole family) 
(0:28:11)  
HH: So your four boys. So Joe is the son who has taken on the farm. And that’s the same farm that you 
and Peggy— 
TS: Yes, oh yes.  He worked six years, he went to— all four went to college. And all four graduated from 
college. He went to Cornell and he worked six years for Oswego County AFCS. He was the office 
manager. AFCS. It’s a government, federal program. One Sunday he and Sue were having dinner and he 
said, “You know what dad, I’d like to work with cattle rather than people.”  And we were getting 
about— all the sons had all left— we were thinking about time for us to maybe—so it worked out nice, 
Joe took over the farm and it was good for myself. Now I have kind of, I have someplace to go. I have a 
great big garden, big lawn. I go up and help Joe. One of the things, as an extension agent— I would 
observe how the good dairy operators, how they would operate. I mean you could—you watch these 
things. You notice the good operators, what they do, and what they don’t do. Sometimes that’s as 
important. And one of the things I noticed was the good operators were always putting back into the 
farm. Because every farm someday is going to be for sale. And when that day arrives, you better have 
7 
 
something to sell.  You can’t live off the depreciation. So when Joe took over, Peggy and I were quite 
proud of the fact that he had a turnkey— [phone goes off, talk about a message] Some of the 
equipment was new or fairly new, all of it was in good shape, excellent shape. And of course we had 
really a good herd of cattle. Good producers. And the barn—well the barn is old. Was built in 1912, but 
it’s all been re-renovated, the insides, all comfort stalls. Course the first things I did well before I even 
moved, I ordered a pipeline milker. ‘Cause Peggy says, “I’m not lifting buckets.” She used to help with 
the milking. Pipeline milker, put mats— do you know what mats are? 
HH: Yes. 
TS: All the beds had mats. Grates, the gutters had grates. I welded them myself. And the pipeline. Of 
course we had two silos, unloaders. That’s the other thing, we went to haylage as opposed to hay. I 
noticed a lot of the good operators were going to haylage, so we put up another silo for haylage. I had to 
put the first silo up that fall. ‘Cause the other ones were wood, 14 by 40 maybe. Cause the wood’s— so I 
put up a concrete stave, 20 by 50. Then next spring we put up a haylage silo. I noticed the good 
operators went to haylage. And it worked out good. She did the chopping and I unloaded the wagons. 
Like I say, she was a good operator. We didn’t break any speed records, but we got it done. And so when 
Joe took over, it was a turnkey. He didn’t have to do this and do that. Now he’s expanded. But see when 
we were farming it there— I made a whole bunch of notes. When we were farming there were 17— 
there’s quite a community of Amish now. What we’re doing is English. So there was 17 English 
producers on the Number 3 Road between Lowville and Copenhagen. Now there are four. And the rest 
are Amish. They will buy up a farm and maybe split it up into two or maybe three farms. They’re great 
people, and good people. Hard workers, but when we were here, all our neighbors, all the land was 
being used. One piece became available. And I remember my banker telling me— he was right adjacent 
to us. In fact it came to within 50 feet. It was right close to us. He said, “You buy that, whatever it takes. 
I’ll back you. Cause it’ll never be for sale again.” And he was right. So we bought that. But all the land 
was tied up. Now after, since Joe has taken over, three operators have died, some have retired. So 
boom, all this land— so Joe rented some. Then he bought some. And that’s right adjacent to us. And he 
still rents some. They’re all his land. But now it’s being, every acre is being used, but mostly by the 
Demkos and Marks Farm. You know the Marks farm? 
HH: I know of it. That’s the really big one, right? 
TS: I think they’re milking 3,500. 
HH: Yeah, I thought it was somewhere around 3,000. 
TS: But all the rest of the land is the Amish and the Demkos’. All the land is being farmed now, but it’s all 
being farmed by different operators.  
(0:36:00) 
HH: When you bought the farm, how many acres were you cropping? 
8 
 
TS: 105. And that really wasn’t quite enough. We bought it in ’75, we bought this adjacent 15 acres. 
‘Cause my next door neighbor decided to retire from farming. He tried to sell the whole farm, but it 
wasn’t moving. So five of us neighbors got together and we made Russell an offer. For all this land.  We 
said, “You can keep the house and your barn.” He had a good-paying job. He said, “Gee, that suits me 
fine.” And so we split us all his farm among five of us. 
(0:36:46)  
HH: What was the—you were talking about how your wife was active in all these organizations. But 
what was the community of farmers like. Was there a lot of cooperation— 
TS: Oh yes, yeah, yes.  
HH: Was there any sharing of equipment? Or helping one another? 
TS: No, not so much that. It was occasionally. But it wasn’t a routine thing, like in my grandfather’s time. 
Back then, his three brothers farmed it. And they used to get together and do a lot. Once in a while we’d 
trade back and forth. You know, help fill a silo. But it wasn’t a routine thing. We all got along, but each 
one wanted to march to their own drummer. We all had our own equipment. 
HH: Your own way of doing things. 
TS: But volunteerism was quite strong. 
HH: You mean in the community in general. 
TS: Yeah. Yes. This is pretty typical of America. Volunteerism. Rural and urban both. And the boys, they 
have followed along the same footprints.  
(0:38:38)  
HH: So how many cows were you milking? 
TS: 36. (laughs) not 100. 
HH: That was the biggest your herd ever got? 
TS: Yeah. 
HH: Wow. 
TS: I think Joe, I think they’re milking 50 now. They can milk 60. He’s got the land for 60. But I think he’s 
milking about 50. And he’s in, they’re making curd cheese.  
HH: I heard about that. 
TS: They make Fridays now. But I go and help do his morning, mid-morning chores. So he doesn’t have 
to come out of the cheese room. That cheese room is immaculate. I mean you could do brain surgery in 
9 
 
there. So if he came in the barn, he had to go back and take another shower. So I go up and help him out 
there.  36 was— some of our income was merchandising cattle.  
HH: Okay. 
TS: Because back then, there was a good export market. Exporting cattle to foreign countries. And these 
foreign buyers like New York State Holsteins. They’ve been very successful with previous purchases. 
They knew they were good honest cattle. They knew we were sending good stock, not the culls. So New 
York was a good— they liked New York State Holsteins. And they would come in, the state Office 
Holstein Association contact all its members and say you know, have you got something. Because these 
animals have to meet specs— specifications for their bloodlines and so forth. So they’d get together a 
shipment and they’d truck them to Newburgh. To the Airforce base there. And that’s where they would 
quarantine them for 30 days and test them. Then they would fly them out. These were all flown out. 
They didn’t ship cattle by boat. That’s a nightmare, shipping cattle. First of all, how do you load cattle? 
How do you load them into a hull? You’ve got to sling ‘em. You’ve got to care for them, oh golly, on the 
trip. Now they fly them. They make maybe one or two stops. But they’ll be to their destination within 24 
hours. It’s expensive now, but they bore that expense. These foreign buyers are paying competitive 
prices. They were competitive with domestic sales. Plus we weren’t having to pay a sales commission. 
And we weren’t having to fit ‘em and feed ‘em. At the sales you know, you’ve got to fit ‘em and take 
care of at the sales. They’d come to the farm, they’d hop on a trailer and they would rendezvous out the 
throughway. They pay these great big double-decker tractor trailers and they would take them on over 
to Newburgh.  
(0:42:44) 
HH: Was there a high demand for export cattle the whole time you were in farming? 
TS: Yeah, pretty much. But then it kind of—I don’t know the economy. I don’t understand exchange 
rates. I don’t hear anything—well I’ve been out of it for 18 years, but Joe doesn’t mention anything 
about. What some of the export businesses conducted, the foreign buyers will come over with a can of 
liquid nitrogen and buy 50 or 100 embryos. Frozen embryos. And that’s— they’ll come on a plane and 
take the return flight back home with these 50 or 100 or maybe 23000 frozen embryos in a liquid 
nitrogen tank. And then these would be placed in donor cows. And that’s where— 
HH: Wow. I had no idea! [both laugh] 
TS: Well, we did some ET work. You know what ET— embryo transplant. I’m sorry for using 
abbreviations. 
HH: No, that’s okay. 
TS: Embryo transplant. 
(0:44:15)  
10 
 
HH: Now your herd was a registered herd? The whole time? 
TS: Oh yes. 
HH: Okay. 
TS: Gradually we sold— the cattle that were there were— they were grade cattle, but they were— it 
was a real good herd. But they were grades. But they got old, you know needed to be culled, they would 
go to the beef pen. And as ours freshened to take their places, eventually the whole herd was purebred. 
No, the original cows were good. I’ve got records. Some of them stayed in the herd 5,6,7 years.  
(0:45:07)  
HH: So your herd stayed the same size pretty much while you were in farming. Were there any major 
changes on your farm, during your time in farming that you underwent, in terms of equipment or ways 
of doing things? 
TS: Yes. One of the changes is in housing.  Are you familiar with curtains?  
HH: Yes. 
TS: When that idea came out I thought that has got to be the— because I used to get a barn just as tight 
as I could, then rely on a great big huge fan, vent-o-matic fan that was on thermostat. And that’s what 
controlled the atmosphere. But now Joe has put in curtains. Well, they work nice. ‘Cause he can raise 
and lower them. That’s what Demkos do, Marks do too. They’re all controlled atmosphere. I thought 
that was— Joe put it in and it worked beautifully. And the air is nice in there, plus Mike is, the first son, 
he’s an engineer and he figured, Joe saves about $25 a month just on electric ‘cause that fan’s not 
running. So that was a big— of course, machinery. Well I guess— oh, I remember the days when they 
were filling silo, they would use false endgate wagon. Do you remember that? And it would take maybe 
three guys, it was a false endgate that would push the silage back. And there was a trough blower. And 
they would use potato hooks to feed it into this trough. Then you’d have—you’d take six or eight guys. 
When there’d be one man up in the silo with a big pipe, he has a rope tied to a pipe. And he’d walk 
round and round and round to distribute it. And now it’s all done by— the endloaders convert to a 
distributor. And two people— you got one person chopping with a wagon. You got the other person 
with another wagon that’s emptying. And it’s just— I’d have one wagon empty, and my wife just 
finished up with another load. Of course grates—on the gutters. That way their tails aren’t in the 
manure, they’re not stepping in there. Course now they’ve got some of your corn planters are plateless. 
Are you familiar with that? 
HH: No. 
TS: Well the traditional planters got plates. They spin around in the bottom of the hopper. And there’s 
little holes in each plate, and they drop down through a little feed chute as you go along— and the chute 
makes a little trough. And now they’re plateless planters—there’s little fingers in there. The big 
advantage is you can use ungraded seed. Which is cheaper. You can use little teeny. See now we have to 
11 
 
use the same size seed for a given plate, maybe medium flats, maybe medium rounds, small rounds. 
We’ve got about 20 or 30 sets of plates up there for our four row planter. I like a plate planter. You get 
good population, it’s nice and even. So Joe doesn’t plan on— some of those planters you’re looking at— 
I don’t know— 16,20,30 thousand bucks.  
(0:50:08)  
HH: I think you said that your wife was doing— was she doing all the planting and all the tractor work? 
TS: She never did any planting. She liked the plow. She didn’t do all of it. She did do a lot of it. She did all 
the chopping. She did all the hay bining. But she never spread manure or planting or picking stone.  
(0:50:48)  
HH: I wanted to ask, with the fields that you have are there any particularities of that land that make it a 
particular challenge? 
TS: No, it’s just all nice. Not bringing any stones. Most of it’s well-drained. It’s flat. See, Delaware County 
is hilly. 
HH: So that’s part of what made you want to come to Lewis County, is the land. 
TS: Yes. And it’s so stony down there. If we picked stones as fine as we do up here, our whole farm 
would be a great big cavity.  We pick stone as we plant. We have a bucket on the planter tractor. My 
little grandson, he’s got a four wheeler with a little wagon and he’ll pick stone ahead of me. And that’s 
it. But down there where we came from, it was a solid day’s project, for three or four people. No, I like 
the land up here. It’s flat. I just like the land. And some of the land down there would take 4, maybe 6 
tons of lime. Up here we’re talking 1, 1 1/2 . Some of the land down there was not really well-drained 
either. Not wet, but— this is why I came to Lewis County. Because we visited two farms and I could see. 
Plus the big milk plant was here. Plus all the services are right—veterinarian, feed dealers, machine 
dealers, technicians, milk production testers. They’re all right localized. That was a big selling point. If 
you’ve got a lot of dairies, you’ve got a lot of services. One of the things about— as far as nutrition— it’s 
a whole new ballgame. When I was farming it, we were concerned with crude protein, digestible 
protein, dry matter intake and TDN, and that’s it. Now there’s talking bypassed nitrogen, there’s a feed 
dealership that has a nutritionist— soluble this and insoluble that.  
(0:54:26)  
HH: Did you have a nutritionist coming to your farm? 
TS: Well the feed dealer was my nutritionist, Rick Bush.  
HH: Were you growing most of your feed yourself? 
TS: Oh no. All the grain was purchased.  
HH: So it was haylage— 
12 
 
TS: Haylage and corn. We put up a little hay. It’s getting time; maybe I better go down and check my 
wood furnace. 
HH: Okay. 
TS: We’ve always burned wood. 
HH: I’ll just pause this. 
Start of Track 2 
[Tom began discussing his sons and their accomplishments before Hannah began recording again.] 
TS: I said, “Get good grades. You can transfer anywhere.” So you see, Mike went to— he was in farm 
mechanics. He worked for Case dealer for 11 years. And you could see that he kind of reached the top— 
it was a family. They owned two dealerships. And he could see that he’d kind of reached the top. There 
was kind of a ceiling. So he went to the University of Binghamton in Mechanical Engineering. His wife, 
she had her 4 year degree, so she could help earn money while he went to college. Went to the Charles 
Watson School of Engineering. You know who Charles is? 
HH: No. 
TS: He’s the IBM founder. 
HH: Okay. 
TS: Getting back to learning values, Jim’s the third, he went to Syracuse. A chemical engineer in paper 
making. There was this company in West Virginia that he really wanted to be hired by. Because they 
were specialty paper. They still are. There’s a lot of chemistry involved. So he interviewed down there. 
‘Course his resume showed he was in 4H and FFA, been raised on a farm, Holstein Club. And the 
personnel person said, “You know we rarely see someone with this resume. When we do, we hire them. 
We know they’re good workers.” And that was— 
(0:02:40)  
HH: When did your work day begin and end? 
TS: About 5:30. And we’d be done by about 7 at night. Yeah, that’s about right.  
HH: You did two milkings? 
TS: Yes. We never went to three milkings. One of the changes I’ve noticed in just the past few years is in 
corn varieties. At one time you had to be really careful about picking corn varieties. You want to get the 
early maturing ones— and they’re rated as to standability. Is a wind storm gonna come over— I 
remember one year we planted this one variety, the whole field went down. My wife had to chop it one 
way. The chopper would pick them up, the gathering chain would gather them. But you couldn’t go 
down—ordinarily you go up one row and down another. So that was a thing you had to look out for. And 
13 
 
northern corn blight. We had to watch out for that. Those things had been bred out, standability is a 
given or else— I notice like Joe’s. We used to have to wait until we had a frost to get the moisture down. 
Cause you don’t want to put corn in with it too juicy. Used to test it. It wants to be like 35% dry matter. I 
notice now with Joe, I mean sometimes we’re done chopping before we have a frost. The corn doesn’t 
look frosted, it still looks green, but you take the dry matter and it’s where you want it, you know 35, 
38% dry. And it doesn’t look it. Well we’re done chopping long before we have a frost. So the varieties 
are just—are you familiar with the Roundup Ready corn? 
HH: No. 
TS: Well, that’s something new. Do you know what Roundup is? It’s herbicide that kills everything. 
Everything that’s green. And Monsanto developed a corn that is resistant to Roundup. So the weeds can 
be as high as your corn, and you go in and spray and it’ll kill the weeds. The only problem with that is, I 
think the corn will shelter the weeds so you don’t get good coverage. That’s the other thing, I got the 
spray license. You’ve got to be licensed to spray. You know that? 
HH: I should hope that you would need to be. 
TS: So now, I go in and spray, just when the plants—sometimes I spray before the plants are up. But it’s 
a lot easier to row the rows if they’re up just maybe like that [motions]. 
HH: Uhuh. About a little under an inch. 
Ts: Yeah, about two leaves. And I spray. Joe, he’s says, “I’m never gonna go to the—,” the Roundup 
ready corn is more expensive too. 
(0:07:08)  
HH: What do you spray? 
TS: Pardon me? 
HH: What do you spray? 
TS: Herbicides. That’s the other thing, when we first started you’d spray an herbicide for a certain weed. 
Now the herbicides come in what’s called cocktails, they’re made with maybe three ingredients under 
one brand name. They’ll contain maybe three different herbicides and they’ll take out three different 
kinds of weeds. That’s something that’s brand new. Before we just used to use an herbicide for 
quackgrass, well it would take out broadleafs. But now they take out just about everything.  
(0:08:10)  
HH: When you were studying, you studied Dairy Husbandry it was called. Did you learn all about crops 
and soil? 
TS: No. 
14 
 
HH: So how did you learn about what you needed to know? 
TS: Well they had training schools at Cornell. No, I didn’t get into— I was strictly dairy husbandry and 
animal husbandry. All my electives were animal— we had a really dedicated and enthusiastic animal 
husbandry professor. Very knowledgeable. I took his swine, beef, horses and sheep husbandry. Sy 
Terrell. He developed an outstanding—you know Morgan horses? 
HH: Yes, they’re the big— 
TS: You can ride ‘em, drive ‘em and they make good work horses. Anyhow, he developed an outstanding 
Morgan horse herd there. So I took— and he was just an enthusiastic, knowledgeable. He would give 
[laughs]— he never gave any quizzes. Never gave any tests. He’d have a final. The final would be one 
question. What did you learn about the management and feeding and care of, say sheep. And we— you 
know what a blue book is? 
HH: Yeah, I do. 
TS: So now he says, “You can fill out half a blue book. You can fill out two blue books, or three. Let me 
forewarn you. I’m an old country boy and I can separate the chaff from the wheat. So don’t try and snow 
me.” And your grade would be riding on that one question.  
(0:10:38)  
HH: What was your—I hope this doesn’t sound funny—what was your relationship to your animals like 
on the farm? 
TS: Oh, I guess dedicated. I mean, we’re their guardians. And they are our livelihood. But you know, you 
just become attached to ‘em. And you get very upset when something happens to one. I don’t think it’s 
anything you learn. We’re their caregivers. They depend on us for everything. And one of the hardest 
things we ever had to do, we had this nice fancy three year old. She was headed for big time. I went out 
one morning after milking and I looked down— and you know in an instant— I looked down, but I knew 
she was, they’ve got that certain look about them when they are dead. And she’d had an aneurysm. The 
meat man said when he opened her up the whole thoracic cavity was full of blood. She’d had an 
aneurysm. Animals get them just like people. She was headed for big time. We’d done ET work with her. 
I remembered my wife cried, she cried several nights about Cathy dying. Well then, to make matters 
worse, the meat man’s cable wasn’t working and I had to drag her out with a tractor. I just wanted to 
call him and say, “There she is, get her out.” But no. One of the hard facts of life is, every animal that’s 
born on that farm, goes out the barn door one way or another. Hopefully some will end up going out to 
other herds. You know you sell them to other breeders. Well, then some you have to cull for some 
reason— poor udders or low production or something. And others you drag out. Yeah I don’t think I 
could handle it today. That’s the way it is, the hard facts of farm life. But you just get attached to them. 
Well you’re working with them 24/7 and they all have different personalities. Some are nicer to get 
along with than others. I remember one time, she was a purebred. She was a good purebred, good 
producer. Do you know anything about classification? 
15 
 
HH: Not really, no. 
TS: Well, she was 84 points. And 85—90 is very good. She was due in a month. For some reason, and this 
happens, certain cows will take a certain dislike to certain women. For no reason. I mean, Peggy 
wouldn’t hurt a flea. And Peggy could milk her, she’d never kick. Unhook her. As soon as she was free on 
the barn floor, she’d stand and just shake her head, threatening like. I said, “Well, just stay away from 
her.” So one day I had to go to town and Peggy say, “Okay well I’ll turn ‘em out.” And I said, “No, that’s 
okay.” Well she went ahead anyhow. Turns out this Randy—that was her barn name—she was a 
purebred inaudible. This Randy kind of hung back, went out the lane. She Peggy had the shovel and was 
shooing her along. All the sudden, she just charged at her. And Peg I guess hit her once with the shovel 
and then dropped the shovel but the cow ran her down. And just kept—their head is so powerful. 
They’ve got a big muscle in the neck that’s about that thick [motions]. You don’t have to have horns—
she just kept punching her and punching her. And Peggy was crawling and scrambling. And she got 
underneath the electric fence, thank goodness. And of course Randy backed off, ‘cause she knew it was 
electric. Well Peggy was covered in manure and dirt, bruised, she was black and blue. So I came home 
and there she was laying on the lawn. I wasn’t paying much attention, I said, “Gee, that all you have to 
do is lay around?” Wooo [laughing] Boy, she was under YOUR cow. So I went and called up Richard P. 
Bush, our trucker, and I said I have a cow for you for the beef pen. I said, “I want you to get her out of 
here. The sooner the better. I want to ship her in the beef pen.” Here she was a good plus, on her way 
out, due in a month. Next time may not be—if she ever caught her out in the open. She was just lucky to 
get out underneath. Well talking about fencing, in ’88— you familiar with the North Country Research 
Project out of Miner Institute? 
HH: No. 
TS: A professor from Cornell, a professor Lucy was in charge of it. And he asked would we be interested 
in doing a research project. A five year—for intensive pasture management. Are you familiar with that? 
HH: A little. 
TS: You have little small paddocks. We had acre paddocks. We had 20 of them. This was in ’88. It was a 
field research project. We had technicians come down, they took all kinds of data and assessed the 
herbage and the whole nine yards. Well, we done it for five years. And Joe’s kept it up. And that’s been a 
money maker. 
HH: You were paid to participate in it? 
TS: No, this is a money maker from what we saved on feed. No, we weren’t paid. It was strictly 
voluntary. But the money you save on grain and the fact that the pastures would— if you just turn them 
out in pastures— about the middle of July, or maybe sooner, they just get ratty. But here they have a 
fresh paddock every day. Joe’s got 35 of them now. Every day they get new herbage. And this grass is 
tall, it’s extremely nutritious. Native grasses. They’re tested year in, year out. 20% crude. And that is 
good. Sure, it’s only 25% dry matter, but they eat 100—125 pounds of it. When they are in the barn, I 
would feed— of course we were on official test. You get the grain weights. I would feed— about 25% of 
16 
 
the milk check would go for purchased feed. And when I relied on the paddocks, I dropped that down to 
19. Joe has made some— he’s made some good money by savings. Especially now with the feed costs. 
We kept that up with Professor Lucy. He was an extension specialist, PhD. He was a farmer’s extension 
man. He talked our language. That was worthwhile. Joe’s kept it right up. It’s going on 20, 25 years now. 
It’s saved him a lot of money. Probably, I mean you get bigger herds, it gets awful clumsy. Because 
you’re gonna have cows walking, half, three quarters of an hour to get out to that furthest paddock. But 
with 50 cows— 40, 50 or maybe even 60 is— plus the farm really should be set up geographically for 
paddocks. Ours was ideal. And today, they have— back then we use metal cap wire— today they’ve got 
plastic poly-wire. It’s really light. It’s plastic strands, but in among the strands it’s aluminum fibers. And 
that’s what carries the juice. But it’s easy to put up and it’s light. I bet I made 3 or 400 temporary posts 
for electric. They have little holders you can adjust up and down. Just one strand too. Maybe the 
perimeters, Joe has the perimeters cap wired. It’s galvanized. But the dividers are all this poly-wire. 
Start of Track 3 
(0:00:00) 
TS: There’s been a lot of technology changes. I mean now everything, you know computers. Joe has a 
computer. The DHI supervisor come along, you know to test milk for official records. This is all—they 
punch in all the figures. Before it was all hand written. You familiar with herd type classification? 
HH: No. 
TS: Well this is the Holstein program. And they body score animals, you know feet, leg, udders, general 
appearance, body capacity. And they give them score for each component or part of the body. And then 
they come up with an overall score. Like Randy’s was 84. Which is—she was on her way up. But then she 
ended up in one of the McDonald’s. But anyhow, the herd classifier comes, before he used to write all 
this. Now he has a little something, and he just punches in figures and goes out and prints it out. It’s all a 
lot of computerized. That’s beyond me, I don’t even know how to turn one on. I’ve got the computer, 
the printer, the scanner the whole nine yards. Peggy knew all about that and she has an email address. 
But I don’t know the first thing about it. Now, out West, have you heard of GPS? 
HH: Hmh. 
TS: Joe says, around here I don’t see it. Out there you’re farming a thousand acres or more. Now John 
Deere’s working on something to have another tractor. You don’t do away with the driver. The GPS just 
steers. Now John Deere is coming out with a second tractor that doesn’t have a driver that is controlled 
by the first tractor. ‘Cause you’ve got to have another tractor but you don’t have to have another man.  
HH: The fields in this part of the country may not ever be big enough or flat enough. 
TS: You don’t have big enough fields really. I mean around here 200 acre field is a pretty good sized field. 
(0:03:27)  
17 
 
HH: What was the most challenging thing about being a dairy farmer? 
TS: Most challenging thing.  
HH: Or some of the more challenging things. You don’t need to choose one. 
TS: Well, I guess my wife is the bookkeeper. Maybe juggling financial figures, I never. We were on 
Cornell’s farm management business summary. We filled in their—. She did all the bookkeeping. I guess 
maybe trying to do the right things at the right time. And plus you’re working around Mother Nature. I 
mean she has the last say, really. But I guess one of the biggest challenges is being able to raise enough 
roughage, so you don’t have to start buying— you start buying hay, this reduces your profits. That’s the 
other thing about the pasture management. I guess how I got started, like I said the pasture start to get 
kind of ratty. So we’d make haylage, which is something I picked up when I was an extension agent. I 
noticed all these good operators, all of them went to haylage. You know what haylage is? 
HH: I do. 
TS: Okay. And we’d fill the silo. Start feeding haylage and we always had corn silage left over. And I’m 
thinking we’re harvesting it, blowing it up in the silo, why not let the cows do this? They’ve been grazing 
for what, 5,000 years. And that’s why I got interested in this pasture management. Because they’re out 
there doing the harvesting, they’re doing the storing, they’re spreading their own manure. They’re out 
there from May to the first of November. And so they’re doing their own harvesting. You’re saving a lot 
of tractor and machine time. And that’s what made sense to me. Let them do all this. They been doing it 
for 5,000 years. Every hour you put on a tractor or machine, it’s costing you money. Our tractors go 
through five gallons an hour of diesel fuel.  
HH: Wow. 
TS: And Mike tells me, his wife’s in-laws farm it out in the Dakotas. They’ve got two or three thousand 
acres. Mike was out there helping, great big 350,000 , 3000 horse power tractors. Dual lease, 4 wheel 
drive. Those will go through 20 gallons an hour of fuel. 24 foot disk. So it all— any time you’ve got 
machinery running or tractors running it’s costing you money. So let the cows do it. 
(0:07:57)  
HH: It seems like the general trend has been towards fewer and larger farms. What kept you from 
growing that way? You didn’t increase you herd size. 
TS: ‘Cause there’s no land available. See when Joe took over, this land— like I say three neighbors died, 
two others retired. Couple barns burned and boom all this land—. So he added on. He can milk sixty, we 
only milked 36. I think they’re milking 50 right now. But that was— you’ve got to have at least 2 ½ or 3 
tillable acres per cow. That’s a rough rule of thumb. And we just didn’t have it. When you went up there 
it was 105 acres. Then I bought this 15 from my neighbor to give us 120. For 36 cows, that was just 
about in the ballpark. 
18 
 
(0:09:20)  
HH: I’ve heard about what they call the dairy crisis of the 1980’s. Did you have an experience of that? 
Did that affect you? 
TS: I forget now. Oh golly. There was a time— you know I don’t— 
HH: Well, I imagine it didn’t affect every town and every county similarly. 
TS: No, I don’t remember really what even happened back then.  
(0:10:00)  
HH: Was there a time when you noticed your neighbors start to go out of farming? Was it that they were 
retiring out of it and then their land was being bought? Or were— did you see people really lose their 
farms? 
TS: Oh no. Well some of them died. And a couple of them were just getting along in years. You know 
they’d been at it for 30,40 years and they decided it was time to retire. No I didn’t see anyone losin’ the 
farm. They went out on their own. On their own terms.  Just like Peggy and I, we sold on our— if Joe 
hadn’t bought it, someone else would have.  I’m glad they bought it, and they’re doing a good job too.  
(0:11:30)  
HH: We’ve been talking for a while and I don’t want to overtax you. I asked you about the most 
challenging, what has been the most enjoyable part of farming for you? 
TS: Oh, I guess raising a family on the farm is probably—. And to see the cows do well. See them do well 
and show them at the County Fair. See them do well when they’re classified. Well just seeing things run 
smooth is a satisfaction. You know ‘cause it doesn’t just happen you know.  
(0:12:37)  
HH: You get a real feeling of accomplishment. 
TS: Yes, plus doing what you really like doing. I feel very blessed. I was able to do exactly what I wanted 
to do, thanks to Peggy, Mike Jim, Joe and Tim. If it hadn’t been for them it never would have 
happened— I liked Extension, but it was always in the back of my mind. My social friends were farmers, 
my best man was a farmer. He’s retired now, dairy farmer. You know when you’re operating, using nice 
machinery. We had, well Joe has— in ’70 I bought a brand new Ford 5000. And it’s still up there. How 
old is it now? Now it’s had about three engine jobs, ‘cause you know you get so many hours and you 
have to rebuild the engine. But if you take care of them— see, years has nothing to do with tractors and 
machinery. You know cars, that’s everything: years. But tractors and machinery, it’s the number of hours 
you put on and how well they’re taken care of. And that Ford tractor, like I say, it’s gone, every 5 or 
6,000 hours you’ve got to rebuild the engine. 
(0:14:52)  
19 
 
HH: Were you doing your own machinery work or did you have a mechanic? 
TS: I did what I could. I did all the maintenance, of course. But we never had any serious breakdowns. 
HH: You did a good job with the maintenance then. 
TS: Well, I think maintenance is— a cartridge of grease saves a lot of money. Plus being careful. Peggy 
says, “If I smash something up, you and I are going to be paying for it.” One of the things that came as 
far as machinery is, we used to have haybines. It’s a cutter bine and it crimps it. Now they’ve got a disc 
bine. And the cutter bars, a haybine has a cutter bar, it goes back and forth. They can get plugged up. 
What do you do when you get to the last windrow? You’ve got two windrows, and then you’ve got a 
standing grass. So the cutter bar wants to pick up what’s already been cut. And also cut what’s not been 
cut. And this can be a hassle. I used to replace the cutter bar every spring after a while ‘cause Peggy 
would say, “There’s some knives that are loose, I can hear them.” That’s one reason she never wanted a 
cab tractor. We could have had a cab tractor. No, she says, “I want to hear what’s going on. I can tell 
when something’s going wrong.” Well anyways, there were some knives loose and you’d have to tighten 
them up. But then they’d get egg shaped and it’s— So every spring I’d yank out the old cutter bar, slap in 
a new one for $78 and it’d work like a charm, you know. Now they’ve got disc bines. There’s I think 6 or 
eight big round discs. They’re bathed in hydraulic fluid. And they spin at 1000 RPM’s. And on each disc 
there’s 6 or eight little tiny knives that are on swivels that swing free. So you’ve got this kind of thing 
[motions]. And you can go in a mowed-down hay, lodged hay and it’s got shields. You can either lay it 
out flat or bring it in for a windrow if it’s being chopped. That’s a big— now they have disc bines. We 
had a brand new haybine, but disc bines—. You know like when you’re mowing you’re going round and 
round, after about the third pass, you can’t make square— it’s hard to make square corners. So you’re 
going to leave a little tuft on the corners. With a discbine you just go round and round and you don’t 
worry about that. At the end of the field when you’re all done, what you do is you just come down and 
make two passes on diagonals, two passes this way, and you pick up all these little corners. ‘Cause the 
disc bines, they don’t care about—they’ll pick up anything. Like I say, they’re spinning 1000 RPM’s. 
They’re bathed in hydraulic fluid so you want to make sure you fluid levels are—, there’s a reservoir, you 
want to make sure they’re up. Because those are pricy things and they burn out. 
(0:19:44)  
HH: So you mentioned that you were doing part-time work caring for the calves, are you still doing that? 
TS: No, I had to give that up. My back and legs and arms were starting to bother. Well and Jean, she 
says, “I got a hip that’s bothering me.” Says we’re gonna have to do something different. But after I told 
her I fairly was gonna have to give it up. And I took a week off. See then it cleared right up. I said, “I think 
I better quit while I’m ahead.” ‘Cause at my age see, some of these things might not be reversible. I 
mean if you was 40 years old, that might be one thing. She says, “I know where you’re coming from, I’ve 
got a hip that’s bothering me. We’re gonna have to figure out something different for these calves.” And 
that when they put this— can you imagine what an investment that would be? Man, but it’ll pay for us. 
I’m sure they’ve got that figured out.  
20 
 
(0:21:00)  
HH: Well, you’re doing a little bit of work for Joe. 
TS: Oh yeah, during cropping time. Because now is a slow time. Now is a slow time. But I buy a load of 
logs and cut them up. I have a wood splitter, chainsaw. And if they want to go away, I go up and Sue’s 
father comes down and helps do chores. And I go up and help where I can.  
(0:22:00)  
HH: Well, I had just one more question, if that’s all right. When you were in farming, what did you see 
the role of your farm in the community? How did you see the role of your farm in the community? 
TS: Well, in a community that has a lot of dairy farms, well the dairy farmer is actually the economic 
machine that keeps things going. Because that milk check gets spent right here in Lewis County. I mean, 
you’re supporting machine dealers, feed dealers, veterinarians, the DHI testers, paying taxes. Your farm 
is assessed and you got land taxes. Well dairy is— well, they got AMF and Kraft, well if it wasn’t for dairy 
farmers, there wouldn’t be Kraft. They have AMF, they have a few mills. But I think dairying, that’s 
probably the machine that drives the economy. That whole milk check is spent right here, providing a lot 
of jobs for people. Plus, it’s good for the bankers; it’s good for their business. 
(0:23:57)  
HH: Was there anything else that I didn’t ask about that you want to say? 
TS: I think I’ve covered just about—. I made a few notes here. Well, it’s been a— in genetics there’s been 
quite a— you’re familiar with AI, right? Artificial breeding. At one time I remember they had a good sire 
that was siring a nice kind of cows and good production and all. You’d stay with him, you’d use him four 
or five years. Now, good bull comes out and bam, they’re starting to sample his sons and his grandsons. 
It’s like a treadmill! And it just seems like, if you have a good bull, stick with him. But no, they’re just all 
the time trying to—, I suppose it’s like a genetic ladder, they’re trying to, well I’m sure they know what 
they’re doing. I guess it’s progress. I guess I’m just old-fashioned. 
HH: It seems a little too fast for you.  
TS: Yeah, I remember using good bulls, but now they’re just getting some of these bulls and grandsons 
and— Well, of course the AI business is highly competitive and if you’re not moving ahead, you’re 
moving back, I guess that’s their philosophy. You’ve got to move ahead fast cause the other outfit is 
moving ahead fast too. And if you don’t, you’re gonna end up at the tail end. 
HH: You used artificial insemination for your herd? 
TS: Oh yes. I used to do some of it myself. I went to a school, so I used to do some myself. I used to do 
quite a bit myself. I had a semen tank. You know what a semen tank is? 
HH: Well, I don’t know what it looks like.

TS: Well, it’s a big canister that’s filled with liquid nitrogen. And it comes in straws, they’re in a holder 
and the holders are held in there. And you’re drawing them out. There’s a procedure of thawing them 
and so forth. That’s the way you put the embryos, frozen embryos. 
HH: And you had to watch for when the cows were in heat? 
TS: Right, yup. You can pick that up fast. Well the other, we got on a program of Herd Health Checks. The 
vet would come every fourth Wednesday as preventative medicine. Instead of putting out brush fires, 
it’s preventative medicine. Joe’s still on that program. I remember when it first came out, the vets 
thought well gee, the dairymen are gonna think we’re trying to push something on to them. 
(0:28:23)  
HH: Are you talking about vitamins and things like that? 
TS: Well, mostly this is reproductive, it’s other things too. Just taking care of general herd health. You 
know when I was at Demkos, Dr. Ostrom would be there every second Tuesday. He spent most of the 
day on that farm, all herd health checks. You know this is something well-knowing people with good 
intentions; they refer to these factory farms and that. Oh golly, these cows at Demkos, well all dairy 
cows, eat better and have much better livelihoods than thousands of humans in this very country. I 
mean some people don’t see a doctor. These cows are seeing them every— and their diets, Joe has 
nutritionists. And Demkos and Marks’ have— it’s all computers. And these cows get just what they need, 
not too much, not too little. Fat cows are a no-no. Skinny ones are a no. They’re just right. Their 
environment is controlled and they sleep on sand— it’s like sea sand, the beds. Well at Joe’s they are 
mats. They’re a lot different than cement. The cows, every whim is catered to. And they talk about, “Oh 
geez, factory farms, these poor animals.” Like I say, these cows get treated better than thousands upon 
thousands of people here in this very country. There are people in this country that don’t have much for 
housing. There are people in this country that are hungry. Don’t see doctors very often. Cows, their 
every whim is being catered to. And there’s thousands of people that can’t say that. Not all my whims 
are catered to. I don’t have a nice house, and I’m hungry. I should go to a doctor. They can go to a 
doctor and they’ll be taken care of. No one is going to refuse them care.  
HH: Right. I hear your point. 
TS: But some of them should see a doctor more often. They just don’t realize that they’re not going to 
be turned away. But they’re not going to be turned away. They’re going to be treated, taken care of. The 
bills will be paid through most often Medicaid or Medicare. Cause many of them don’t have health 
insurance as such. But they have Medicaid and Medicare. I guess there’s other supplemental health 
programs, aren’t there? But no one’s gonna be not treated. 
HH: This Demko’s where you were working, how large are they? 
TS: I think they milk a thousand now.  
HH: And the Marks is the much larger—

TS: Oh god, I’ve heard different figures, 3,500, 4,000. I don’t know. But those cows are cleaned for pete’s 
sake. You know? Like I say, animals’ rights people are well-intentioned, they just don’t know. They ought 
to work on one of these farms. And they’re very cognizant of animal care too. I know Demko’s has got a 
sign up there, cruelty to animals you can do jail time. And it’s the truth too. You get caught being cruel 
to animals; you can end up in the slammer.  
HH: I think I’m all set for now. I don’t think I have any more questions for now. Do you have anything 
else? 
TS: No, I think I’ve covered just about everything.  
HH: Okay, I’ll turn off this recorder then.
