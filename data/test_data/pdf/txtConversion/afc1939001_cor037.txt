Huntsville, Texas, 5/12/1939.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Please send to me at Merryville, La. (You may have to use Parcel Post) 25 Twelve inch
records. Before we leave here we will ship you 75 field records. In nearly every instance
Miss Terrill is including Typed copies of the words contained on each record; also the
slang of the song and the singers. This will be a big saving for the Library. Writing down
the words from the record playing is a long, tedious job. 2 Please get Mr. Henderson or
Dudley to send me the titles of the songs we recorded at Livingston, Ala. The names
of singers are Richard Amerson, Rich Brown, Enoch Brown, Vera Hall, Blind Jesse,
Henry Reed, the Travis family, Tom Bell. The records came in two different places in the
catalogue.
Also the song titles given by Mrs. G. A. Griffin, Newberry, Fla. (Alton Morris' old Georgia
Cracker woman). I wish to avoid 3 needless duplication at both these places.
We have had some delay in having the machine tuned up. Last night, however, the
records I made were again up to a high standard. You are getting day and night and
Sunday work from two people instead of one and in the section richest in folk tunes. We
will give an audition to a select group of your intimates after we are rested a bit from our
trip.

I have not heard finally from you on the Gamut matter, though I've already made filled half
dozen records (Gamut's discs) taking waivers in each case.
Again I thank you for promptly making the way easy for us. Alan has written me frequently
of what a fine job you are doing and I understand why.
Always sincerely, John A. Lomax
