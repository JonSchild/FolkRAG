ICIRIC & DREW. 
It is with, pleasure ,we state that Messrs. Kirk and Drew, 
though young performers, stand at the head of their profession. 
These young men started in the world as mere boys. 
Mr. K. 
was born in the neat little city of Oswego, N. Y., in the year 
of 1855; . 
at an early age he ran away from home and joined a 
travelling circus. He was apprenticed; after serving four years, 
he, ran away and went -in the minstrel business. 
Having a 
good voice and a 
natural gift for dancing, he began to rise very 
rapidly. 
Playing alone for a 
short time, he met Mr. Drew, 
who was born in the city of Philadelphia, Penn., in the year of 
1855, making them both the same age. 
Going to England 
with his father, he ( Frank Drew) played there six years—three 
years with the Christy Minstrels, at Piccadilly. 
He also ap-
prenticed himself, to a 
party by the name of Sullivan. 
After 
playing with them for awhile, he ran away and came to this 
country. 
After going through a 
great many hardships, he 
reached his native land, where he has not only done well, but, 
lite Mr. Kirk, he is an ornament to his profession. 
The secret 
of thcir great , success is due solely to themselves. 
They are 
free from all vulgarity, and do nothing to offend the most fas-
tidious.,

And look- at us so shy, 
Because we dance and do a

And throw our legs so high. 
But when we get done our little ditty, 
We'll go back to de grand old Mississippi. 
Now, white folks, we can no longer stay, 
Or from home they'll think that we have run away; 
But when we get done our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to de grand old Mississippi, 
When de passeirrers, etc.

PALLET OF STRAW, 
Words by EDWARD W ISE. 
Air—" Vot:t tk 
JIi1t to Mt. Poor-House." 
I'm sitting alone in a 
garret, 
While the sleet and the snow's falling down, 
Yet God knows I 
am hungry and dying, 
And Pm aiting for Jessie to come ; 
I 
sent her out early this morning, 
To bring me some pennies or bread; 
But I 
think when my little one comes, 
She'll find that her mother is dead. 
CHORUS. 
I'm cold, and I'm hungry and helpless, 
And my loved one I'll never see more; 
For I'm dying alone in a 
garret, 
On a 
thin little Pallet of Straw. 
Would to God that my child had a 
father, 
Or some one to watch o'er her with care; 
Or some kind-hearted friend to protect her, 
Then . I'd die with out sorrow or fear;. 
Should the storm keep my child from returning 
To her mother, so helpless and sore; 
Who is sitting alone in her garret, 
On a 
thin little naltet P 
CHORUS. 
I'm cold, and I'm hungry and helpless, 
And my loved one I'll never:see more; 
For I'm dying alone in a 
garret, 
On a

When I 
parted with Jessie this morning, 
She kissed me good by, and she said: 
" 
I 
soon shall return, dearest mamma, 
Whether I 
get pennies or bread ;" 
But the night's coming on ,and Pin weaker, 
And I 
think I'll see .Issie no more; 
For when she comes back she will find me 
Lying dead on my pallet of straw. 
CHORUS. 
She's parted from cold and from hunger, 
And her loved one she'll never see more; 
For she's lying dead up in a

This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see :— 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray mag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Teter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along. 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in the pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice. 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big•hall=frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his face. 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally in de garden, lifting peas, 
Come and -kiss me, if you please.

GO GET PERMISSION OF MA. 
As sung by TONT PASTOR, 
Air—" I 
fancy I've seen you before," 
I 
ONCE had a 
sweetheart, a 
charming young girl, 
A 
beautiful young village queen, 
A 
rustic young beauty with hair all in curl, 
And only just turned seventeen, 
When I 
told her I 
loved her, her head she hung down, 
And her cheeks colored up like the rose, 
So I 
thought I 
would try and just steal a 
sly kiss 
From the spot where her victuals all goes. 
SPOICEN.—And I 
did try, but she stopped me and said: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before you attempt to do any autla thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
While talking one night of what pleasure love brings, 
'Twas one pleasant evening in May, 
No dickey bird sailing through air on his wings 
E'er felt half so happy or gay, 
I 
asked my fair charmer if she would be mine, 
And begged she would then name the day 
When we should be married and settled for life, 
Inst listen to what she did say : 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before we attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
21 
her ma did consent, and in one month from this 
Maria and I 
will he one ; 
To my suit the old lady with pleasure said yes, 
Her consent it was easily won; 
" 
But you must agree, said her mother to me, 
To what I 
am now about to say 
When married you calmly submit and agree 
To let us have all our own way." 
SPOKEN.--This quite stunned me for the moment ; bvt re-
covering myself, I 
cooly replied : 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
A 
little advice to you girls I'll now give, 
-So listen to what I 
shall say : 
When sweethearts want to marry, and with you to live. 
Don't say, " I 
must have my own way," 
if you do, as sure as I 
am singing to-night, 
Old maids I 
inn certain you'll die, 
For a 
man's but a 
fool, if he does'nt tell you, 
Or rather unto you reply : 
CHORUS. 
Yon must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go cret permission of ma,

PAGE. 
Music by VINCENT DANTES. 
I've been dining and wining to-day you can see, 
In a 
manner remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
sbree I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
Mustn'n go home, 'tis no use. 
Oh I 
do feel so gay, so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a 
juvenile way, 
For I 
do feel so awfully.loose. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do feel so awfnlly loose, so loose, 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
Of course you can see I'm out on a 
spree, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose, 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
And feeling decidedly loose, 
I 
was laughing and chaffing with ladies so gay, 
The excitement must plead my excuse, 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
And my heart went pit-pat like the deuce ! 
For I 
give you my word this would not have occuired 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, dr,c. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I

kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that! on my life! I've been courting my wife,

did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, tte. 
Now what she said and.I said. may easily be guessed 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the beat 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
fuad 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
For to- night I 
am out on the loose. 
I 
do feel, Sco.

Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
Aly wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears ., 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, lon. 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
I've, only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
it kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, 4c.c. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile,

ALWAYS TOO LATE, 
Written and composed by BONNIE RUNNELS, and dedicated to

I 
am the most unlucky man that ever you did see, 
No matter what I 
do there's always something troubles me; 
The girls they have gone back on me, it always is my fate, 
The cause of all mishaps, boys, to you I 
will relate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm always too late, yes, always too late, 
I'm never on hand, boys, oh, sad is my fate; 
Always too late, always too late, 
I'm never on time, but always too late. 
I 
went to see my gal last night about the hour of nine, 
When I 
went to the house I 
thought I 
was just in time; 
I 
went inside, and there I 
saw my little Kate 
Reclining in some fellow's arms, yon see I 
was too late. 
I'm always, etc 
But now I've married that young gal, I 
am a 
happy man, 
I 
always try to treat my wife the very best I 
can; 
Bnt something happened t'other night which I 
thought 
first-rate— 
My wife she had a 
little boy., and christened him too late ! 
I'm always, etc.

What? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is saddened and weary, 
See the tears how they course down his "heeks 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
Ah me! on that old doorstep yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lily with prattle so sweet r

DON'T WAKE THE BABY. 
As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
'Tis caused by proud delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : " Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms?" She placed her finger on her lips and said, " h—s—h— 
CHORUS. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild! 
As soon as e'er the news spread 'round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said " what a 
darling child!" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man. 
SPOKEN.—"W hy," said they, "Hr. Snooks, Mr. Snooks, you 
ought to be a 
very happy man;" " I 
am, / am!" I 
replied, and 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
Don't make a 
noise, Zte.

But to-day that bliss is mine, 
:And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
I'll crack a

health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy,

And worthy of a

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
THE LILLY OF KERRY, 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
Ant.— Castles in the Air. 
While thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the lire. began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave 
me pain; 
Oh ! may I 
never see them in reality again ; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman. hunger stared them in the face 
The mother and their children gather'd round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to ex_pire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread, 
Though honest, he is forced to steal and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led ; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill- fed ; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat. 
He said, " I 
ant an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat; 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran 
down his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good grace; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him 
through— 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin, dastardly and cold! 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm 
told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all. 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolling kept the 
ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace, in this dissolving view.

List gentle lark, joyous spirit of Spring; 
Thou with the sweet voice and cloud-cleaving wing, 
Shake from thy plumage the tears of the night, 
Haste where the splendors of morning invite; 
Soar where the sinless and beautiful stray, 
Tell them my Norah's as lovely as they. 
CHORUS. 
She's the " Lilly of Kerry !" 
The fairest e'er seen 
In Erin the seagirt, 
In Erin the green. 
Greet, in thy rapture, yon rose•scented dell, 
Deep in whose shadow my Norah doth dwell; 
Norah, as pure as the pearls on the thorn, 
Bright as the golden hair'd goddess of morn; - 
She, from whose fairy-like fingers, the flow'rs 
Fall on the meadows in odorous show'rs. 
She's the:Lilly, &L 
E'en the bright shamrocks that bloom round thy bed, 
Tremble with joy at my Norah's soft tread. 
Mild as the moonbeam that falls on the stream, 
When at love's vespers, the glow -worm doth gleam, 
Free from all guile, and unconscious of wrong, 
Simple and:sweet as thy silvery song. 
She's the Lilly, lec,

Tommy Make Room for Your Uncle.

Words and Music by T. S. 
LONSDALE. Sung by BIG Paws. 
Fred Jones, hatter, of Leicester Square, 
Presents himself to you— 
And you may guess, when he is dress'd, 
Of girls he knows a 
few. 
A 
Widow fell in love with him, 
While riding in a 
train; 
She had a 
blessed boy with her, 
Who caus'd us both much pain. 
SPOICEN.—Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me 
a 
great deal of pain and sorrow, and the Widow, his 
Mother, introduced me as 'his Uncle? Fred Jones was 
never an Uncle before, and never will be again, not if he 
knows it! And the whole of the journey the Mother said 
to the boy— 
• 
CHORUS. 
Tommy make room for your Uncle, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy make room for your Uncle, 
I 
want him to sit here ; 
You know Mamma has got a 
bun, 
And that she'll give to you; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your Uncle, do 
do. 
When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
"Just like a 
swell from town." 
The widow loved Romantic Scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when my arm went round her waist', 
The boy began to cry; 
Brox—He declared I 
was hurting his Mamma, and 
would insist on sitting between us; only fancy making 
love to a 
girl with a 
boy in the way; but she said to him 
in a 
voice so sweet— 
Tommy make room, &c. 
The mother told her loving Son, 
To watch the passing train; 
But, no, he said, my Uncle Fred 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young elf ? 
SPQR:EX.—Yes, it would never do to make love before the 
boy. and the Widow said—" got before the boy, Fred--
not before the boy.' 
Just then we went under a 
tunnel, 
aDd she said— 
Tommy make room, &c. 
In a 
snug retreat at Rosherville. 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas ? 
She sighed, and said, " You wicked man, 
But how about the child?" 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I 
the agony piled! 
SPOIEMZ.—I 
said, my lovely of all lovely beings, let us 
fly to some foreign clime, where I 
will protect you and 
your boy. 
She answered and said, " How about my little 
pie shop in the Bowery ?" Oh! Bloomsbury! Do you keep 
a 
pie shop ?—

Don't think by my dress that rye come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel; 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud, though I'm shabby-genteel. 
A 
time was, when nobs who met me would say, 
"Ha, Harry, dear boy, come and dine." 
But now, when they meet me, they look t'otber way; 
My company now they decline. 
CHORUS. 
Though poverty daily looks in at my door, 
I 
am hungry, Fm footsore and ill, 
I 
can look the whole world in the face and say, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. 
Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand; 
I 
found very soon I 
should smash; 
My friends advised me to fiy from the land, 
And seize upon all my loose cash; 
ut my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my 
till, 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentlema2 still. 
Thouzh poverty, &c. 
One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, • 
I 
picked up a 
purse a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation tu keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
" 
If you're poor, you're a 
gentleman stilL" 
Though poverty, &c. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insultimz; I 
found 
My strength for the moment was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out " you begger, don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill," 
Bat I 
said, " lay a 
nand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor, Fm a 
gentleman still."

Don't Forget the Old Folks at Home, 
Words and Music by J. F. Sur.paras. 
For the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind; 
We hope they will not be offended— 
'Tis said, with intentions most kind; 
We know as they spring up from childhood. 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom, if ever, a 
thought give 
To the old folks so lonely at home. 
Caotrs. 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home; 
Remember the old folks at home; 
They nursed you with care— 
Your hardships did bear; 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home. 
They protected and nursed, aye, and cared fol 
You. when so fragile and weak; 
They watched with affection your first smile, 
And taught you to lisp and to speak: 
And now they in turn have grown helpless, 
Old age cruel traces have shown; 
Is it right to refuse them assistance, 
And leave them forgotten, alone I 
Don't forget, ..te.

Severed from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band.

Music by Brriur 
I'm Clothes Pin George, dat plays de bones, 
And makes de banjo ring; 
De gals all say I'm too sweet to live, 
When I 
begin to sing. 
I 
fell in love with a 
yaller gal, 
A 
Meerchaum colored belle; 
She was niper coon in the fish-ball room 
Of a 
Coffee and Cake Hotel! 
I 
met her first, at a 
fancy ball, 
In South Fifth Avenue; 
When I 
got there my charmer fair, 
Was wonying down a 
stew ; 
She had four jolates of codfish balls, 
For which I 
said I'd pay; 
Said she, " Get out, you black and tan, 
You'll give the snap away." 
I 
asked her if she'd fly with me, 
To some secluded spot? 
She said it wasn't fly time, 
And Flic guessed she'd rather not. 
We agreed to wait 'till the summer time, 
When the beans and peas were ripe. 
But she choked to death with a 
Russian towel 
She ate for a 
piece of tripe. 
'BACK FROM THE MASQUERADE."  
Written and Sung by ALICE MURRAY. 
You see that I 
have returned, 
From the Grand Masquerade; 
And oh! such jolly tin;tes I've had, 
In the dance and promenade; 
And such a 
nice young man I 
had, 
But his name I 
do not know; 
Now I 
feel so very bad, 
For he might have been my bean. 
[Chorus. 
His hair was black and curly, 
His eyes were clear and bright; 
His dress so well becarne him, 
For he played a 
gallant Knight; 
The sweetest words he whispered, too, 
As we walked to and fro; 
But now I 
feel so dreadful bad, 
I'm afraid I've lost my beau. 
But he promised he wonld meet me, 
At some other Masquerade; 
Then I'll be sure to learn his name, 
When on the Grand Parade. 
But he promised he would meet me, 
At some, 
other Masquerade : 
Then I'll be sure to learn his name 
When on the Grand Parade.

APPLES AND PEARS. 
Sung with great success, by W ILD & BRADL, of Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
I'm a 
widow with a 
large family, 
My husband was killed in the war; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling agra; 
From the Goverment I 
receive a 
small pension, 
Which all my family does share; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears! 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
po.or woman do; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash tub. 
The reason I'll tell now to you; 
I'm troubled bad with the Rheumaticks, 
And to put up with, many's the cares,1 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry— 
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy! 
Faith, he is a 
good Democrat! 
But they all do object to the children; 
To marry me, not one of them cares; 
So I'll let them all go to the divil, 
And stick to my apples and pears!

They Borrow, But Never Return. 
Copyrighted 18,76, and Music Pub. E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
As Sung by the For SISTERS. 
As we pass, day by day, thro' life's busy highway, 
There are many strange people we see ; 
And the worst, I 
conclude, are the ones who intrude 
On our charity, be it so free. 
For they seem to depend upon what we will lend, 
Not a 
dollar they honestly earn ; 
Yet they prosper and thrive, and the way survive 
Is, to borrow and never return ! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they borrow but never return, 
So of course it is easy to learn, 
There are some folks that live, not to spend or to give, 
But to borrow and never return! 
If you lay up in store a 
few dollars or more, 
Upon this you can truly depend, 
They will sure find it out, and they'll chase you about, 
Till they force you sour money to lend. 
If you doubtingly say, 
I'm afraid you won't pay," 
Such ideas of course they will spurn ; 
And you'll find out some day, I 
am right when I 
say, 
That they borrow, but never return! 
Yes, they borrow, &c. 
In the fashion they dress, and their manners express 
They have plenty to eat and to wear; 
But they'd be in the shade if their bills were all paid, 
And the poor-house would have them in care. 
'Tis no wonder they smile when they pass you in style— 
It is better to beg than to earn; 
While it's true, as a 
rule, they will deem you a 
fool, 
When they borrow, to never return! 
Yes, they borrow, SEe,

The Old Home Ain't What it Used to B. 
By C. A. W HITE. 
OH, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear thellorkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the fields I've worked when I 
thought 'twas bat, 
But night bro'E its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roan! 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, ite. 
31 ow the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were burn, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left the cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to ay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better land, 
aew old cabin home. good-bye.

Waiting, My Darling, for Theo, 
Sung by M ISS ADA W RAY. 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, lova, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day: 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll' not break your word, lore, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Has shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lilies, 
THE LITTLE ONES AT HO/kilt 
As sung with great success by GEO. W.

I 
am think in 
now of home among my native hills, 
And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills, 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Ah! now their forms I 
seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices tinning in merry ch:ldish glee, 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
caoncs.= 
The little ones at home, the little ones at home, 
long to see the little ones at home, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
LAST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee, 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee; 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at borne, ett. 
May cmardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep, 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those I 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
.Never, never more from thee to roam, 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee 
Proclaim the lovou.s Welcome welcome home.

And drinks his beer with right good cheer, no matter what they

foam; 
A 
few of these are sure to please and send him rolling home!

Sometimes its two, sometimes its three, and often after four;

He says ‘• it's business" all the time, that sends him rolling 
home! 
When Brown comes, & c.

The N. Y. Evening Mai/ writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fianna's, 98 Nas-

Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
,where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. •?. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat littls 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 9S 
Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus oprrandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years. and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi_ 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous. 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in tho 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
