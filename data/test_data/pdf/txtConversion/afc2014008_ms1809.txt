t
ill adventurous and energetic enough t

besides myself had ever seen t

new much about t

he d
istinctive t

i

except w

 t
heatr

ternoon,
 
I
 don't t
h
ink anyone had much o
f an i
dea what would happen.
 
A
 f
ew points had been s
ettled. The Sea I
s
landers wanted t
o c
oncentrate on t
heir
 
r
eligious r
epertoire; t
hough t
hey k
new a
 var
iety o
f secular songs and dances, t
heir
 
r
e
ligious mater
ial was t
he philosophical and emotional core o
f a
l
l t
heir p
resentations.
 
F
rom t
he f
i

ide, Dr. Carpenter had decided not t
o a
ttempt a

"
realistic" background, but t
o s
tage t

hese were t
he only points t
hat had r

been settled i

We worked a
