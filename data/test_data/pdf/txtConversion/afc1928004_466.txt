(Chorus.) 
Devil of a 
Fix. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND expressly for JOHN REILLY. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
Let me like a 
junkman die ; 
Throw them Rochelle salts in the ashbox, 
And buy me a 
gooseberry pie. 
It's seven miles from here to Australia, 
Where we eat the encore soup ; 
We lived on a 
square meal every twenty-four hours 
For we were doing the ends with a 
can-can troupe. 
Tell my aunt Bridget, when you see her, 
That little Buttercup is sick, 
She was rehearsing the twenty-fourth act of Hamlet, 
And got stabbed in the duel scene with a 
brick. 
Why wasn't I 
born rich instead of good-looking ? 
So like a 
prince I 
could ride all day, 
But I 
must work on a 
farm now for a 
living, 
Shoveling tomatoes and sawing hay. 
If I 
only knew the road to heaven, 
I'd give the man a 
dollar at the beautiful gates, 
I'd buy a 
balloon to-morrow and go there, 
For I 
know there'll be no looking for dates. 
Whisper softly, Annie darling, 
Died when she was ninety-two, 
Only blooming into womanhood, 
And just learning how to smoke and chew. 
I 
am tired of living a 
single life, 
So I 
thought I'd take a 
bride, 
We were married just seven minutes and a 
half, 
When I 
found out that she was snide. 
Live and learn to love one another, 
Never cause any one to shed a 
tear, 
For the barber must have been paralyzed 
When he shaved off my father's ear. 
I 
have always loved the ocean breeze 
Since first I 
went to school, 
For the captain of the Ninetieth regiment 
Has stood on the waves and fought a 
duel. 
Farewell all ye little children 
Of nobility and rank, 
To-morrow evening don't fail to be here, 
And we'll present you with an animal's tank. 
Funny Old Mick. 
Written by JAMES RICHNONS. JOHN REILLY'S great success.

this song. 
Here I 
am, a 
funny old Mick, 
My face would make a 
mad dog sick, 
• I 
can do a 
reel, a 
jig, or song and dance, 
And so can my sisters, and my cousins and my aunts. 
CHORUS. 
Then all of you shout for the funny old Mick. 
All of you shout for the funny old Mick, 
All of you shout, and don't holler " Rats" 
For the funny old Mick from Harlem Flats. 
I 
traveled with Dr. Talmage's circus, playing the 
clown, 
I 
entered in a 
walking match with thirty-seven jays, 
It took twenty of us three months to walk six days. 
(Chorus.) 
The shamrock Home. 
Dedicated to JOHN RAYNOR, the rising Irish Coinique, by BEN Comm. 
Sung by JNO. REILLY. 
In Erin's Isle—the shamrock's home, 
A 
darling fond and true, 
A 
lilly fair, with golden hair, 
And cheeks of the brightest hue. 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, 
Murmurred, " Katie, think of me," 
Grasped her father's hand and left 
To cross the stormy sea. 
Katie, darling, think of me as always by your side, 
And never fear, my colleen dear, 
I'll return for you, my bride. 
CTIORUS. 
Katie, mine, when the winter wind is snarling, 
The love of my colleen will cheer me always, 
Think of our parting sorrow and starting, 
I'll remember you, too, in the long summer days. 
I 
often think of the happy days, 
When Kate and I 
did roam, 
By the old mill that's running still, 
Where the waters dance and foam, 
It was there I 
met her in the evening, 
Throwing pebbles at the tide, 
Homeward bound, what happy moments, 
She was by my side , 
I 
am thinking of her all day, 
Long My Cushla Gm Machree, 
And dreaming of her lovely face, 
It fills my heart with glee. 
Never Take it Back.

I 
suppose that you've all heard of me, 
1 
am known all over town, 
I 
am Michael John O'Rafferty, 
And my name is heard all round, 
I've a 
watch that's worth a 
dollar notes 
And a 
crazy horse g,nd hack, 
I'm heir to Dan O'Connell's hat, 
And I'll never take it back. 
Cnouus. 
I 
never was an alderman, 
Though I 
have friends by the score. 
I 
am a 
man of great high standing, 
And of learning I 
have galore, 
I 
hold a 
high position, I 
Superintend the horse car track, 
I 
am an Italian ambassador in disguise, 
And I'll never take it back. 
I 
stand solid, too, with all the boys, 
My goodnature can't be beat, 
When I 
meet them in a 
barroom, 
No one else but me will treat. 
I've been to Saratoga 3prings, 
New York and 3allymazack, 
I've traveled as a 
sand bag with Jon Mace, 
And I'll never toake it back.

Bernard McGee. 
Written by BEN Commis. 
Sung by JOHN REILLY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 24, Vesey street,. N. Y. 
I 
am Bernard McGee; you've heard of me; 
-I 
have just come over the ocean. 
To see the sights of this free land, 
In my head I've took the notion.. 
I 
never care for politics, but all the people say, 
I'll be Senator Bernard McGee on next election day. 
Cnonus. 
Then I 
am Senator McGee; the world is proud of me, 
My talent is wonderful ; I 
am a 
beauty, as you see; 
The band will proudly play,as I 
march so grand and gay 
To take my 
seat in Washington on next election day. 
My friends, they are quite numerous, 
Of wealth they've got a 
pile, 
I 
ride around in my barouche, 
And wondrous is my style, 
I 
will regulate the 17th of March; 
Give the workingmen their pay, 
When McGee goes in for Seaator, 
On next election day. 
(Chorus.)

Parody on Little Widow Dunn. 
Written by BONNIE RUNNELLS, and sung by the friend of the working man, 
H ON. JOHN REILLY, who stands without fear whenever he does appear. 
I've got a 
crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head; 
She never minds me in anything I 
say. 
She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
4 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'Leary's belt, 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, &c. 
Written by JA3rEs RICHMOND kr Joni Warns-Ey. 
Oh, I've got a 
wife her name is Christine, 
She is a 
hundred and nineteen, her nose it is green, 
She can crawl through a 
gas pipe, 
She's getting so lean, 
She can waltz on her eyebrows all night, 
If I 
tell her to wash my porous plaster, 
Its then she will kick, slug me with a 
brick, 
Make me go to the butchers for tick, 
I'll bet you seven dollars Johnny Dwyer she can lick, 
For her breath is as strong as an ox. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, if I 
knew the man that learned her to box, 
I'd give him the small pox or Chastine Cox, 
I'd hit him with a 
brick or a 
dozen of rocks, 
For learning my wife how to spar. 
The other evening I 
came home with a 
new pair of pants, 
She stabbed me with a 
lance, 
Then I 
fell in a 
trance, 
Then she picked all my pockets when she got the chance 
And danced a 
Dutch reel on my neck, 
She picked me up like a 
baby and threw me into bed, 
Put a 
bandage on my head, 
1 
thought I 
was dead, 
Next morning when I 
got up I 
was blue, white and red, 
And my nose was all over my face. 
(Chorus.) 
Written, composed and sung by W M. J. 
SCANLON, in SCANLON & CRONIN'S 
famous sketch, entitled " Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That taugut her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha! 
Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of his legs. 
( 
Chorus.) 
Delia on the Trapeze. 
IRISH SONG. 
Written by Wm. J. Scanlon. 
I 
have a 
charmer, she's my .alarmer, 
Oh, what a 
pleasure to have such a 
treasure, 
1 
call her baby, she calls me Cleary, 
We pass all our time in a 
most pleasant way. 
When we're out for a 
walk the young men do say 
As we pass them by in the street, 
Look at Lynch and his mash, don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet. 
CHORUS. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees, 
She is a 
daisy, sets them all crazy, 
They laugh and they shout 'till you'd think they 
would burst. 
,Repeat.)

success in their character sketch, ' Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, an Irish man, 
As you can plainly see, 
I 
have to work from morn till night 
To support my family. 
I 
left my dear old native land, 
Oh, yes, that dear ould sod, 
And its here I 
am in America, 
Carrying the hod. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, its mortar and bricks 
I 
have to carry from morn till night, oh, 
No sooner than I 
3m to the top, 
Than then I'm down below. 
My friends they know both near and far, 
No matter where I 
trod, 
That there's not a 
man in this whole wide world 
Can bate me carrying the hod. 
At night when I 
am through my work, 
Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a 
smile, 
My children do also, 
it's take a 
chair and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn out 
From carrying the hod.

Only a 
Sweet Little Letter. 
Published by permission of COLLINS St BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better 
Than the treasure of jewels and gold. 
Many days my poor heart has been sighing 
For this mark of affection to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
CHORUS. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
Whose glad coming I've waited to see, 
Yes, a 
dear little, sweet little letter, 
Just a 
sweet little letter for me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind words, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of thoughts linger near me, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion; 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
J'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c.

The Raffle for the Stove 
Written, composed and sung with great success by J. E. 
M URPHY, of 
M URPHY k 
M ACK, at the London Variety Theatre, N. Y., in the 
laughable sketch, entitled " Murphy's Dream," for 100 
consecutive nights. 
Music published and copyright 1879, by E. 
H. Harding, 229 Bowery, and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife, 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
* 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
botte, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

Nancy Mooney. 
Written and sung by " H ENRY CARNEY" with great success. 
Ochone, weirasthrue! sure my heart's nearly breaking: 
Farewell of my senses I'm sure I 
am taking; 
Thro' thinking of Nancy, asleep or awaking, 
I'm just like a 
long fishing rod. 
My bosom with anger and sorrow does throb, 
Aich breath that I 
take islurnecl into a 
sob ; 
I'm as wake as a 
drink of could water, by gob, 
I 
wish I 
was under the sod. 
CHORUS: 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, of me you've made a 
looney, 
You know since we were childther on you I've been spooney; 
If you don't dhrop gallavantin' with that blackguard, Mickey 
Rooney, 
I'll dhrown myself, and thin my ghost will haunt you night 
and day. 
Ochone, weirasthrue! black-eyed Nancy Machree, 
I 
know you're too good for a 
fellow like me; 
But as sure d s 
the birds love the leaves on the tree 
I 
love you far dearer than life. 
If you'll only become Mrs. Mulligan soon 
I'll sing like a 
bird in the sweet month of June, 
And I'll hop on one leg from Drumlish to the moon 
The day that I 
make you my wife. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, & c. 
Altho' I 
am delicate, lonely, and wake, 
I'll smash every skull in the land for your sake, 
I'll pitch the ould castle right into the lake, 
I'll ride Prince O'Donoughtte's horse. 
I'll swear by all colors—black, yaller, or red,— 
That I'll smash like a 
turnip Mick Rooney's big head; 
You have broke my poor heart—och, I 
wish I 
was dead, 
Then you might shed a 
tear o'er my corse. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney & e.

It's her I'm going for to see ; 
I'm going to take her to a 
dance to-night, 
And it's happy we will be, 
She's not very stout, she's not very thin, 
But I 
want you all to understand, 
To sing a 
song or dance a 
jig 
She can beat all the girls in the land. 
CHORUS. • 
She can sing, (Aym.)

Now this is the way she goes—

My Katie dear, my little Katie dear, 
We're going to be married soon; 
I

And as proud as the richest gossoon. 
And when we settle down in —

All the people in the town we'll invite.

We'll not go home till broad daylight.

We will sing, (Sym.) 
We will dance, (Sym.) 
We'll have a 
good time, now remember, sure, 
And when old Murphy squeezes the pipes, 
It's then we'll welt the floor.

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE 
As originally sung by W ILL H. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
toston, Mass. 
i
Some boast of wealth and rich es, but 
gi
ve 
me 
the hardy 
hand, 
Give me the honest workingman , 
th e 
prid e of 
every 
land; 
The man that earns his livi ng by 
the 
sweat 
of 
labor'
s 
brow, 
) 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
$ 
t 
plough. 
1 I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
i
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
I 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
I 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor wits our bond of strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the mother:and, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
' 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Conic from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of France, 
For ' tis our greatestjoy to give each workingman a 
chance. 
GILFILLEN'S GOAT. 
Sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN with great success. 
Air—" Mulcahey's Gone Away." 
Come listen to me one an' all, 
To what I'm goin' to say, 
It's all about a 
neighbor o' mine, 
Who lives across the way; 
He's the owner of a 
big coal cart, 
An' he likewise drives the same, 
An' he got a 
great big billy goat, 
Who's very much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For whin he'd jump, he'd hit you a 
thump, 
Unless. 
you'd quickly slope 
Oh, the terror of the neighborhood— 
Is Gilfillen's big buck goat I 
I'll tell you of the damages, 
That he's done all around, 
He wint into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I 
tell you there was a 
row, 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, eta. 
Now it was here this afthernoon, 
He came into my yard, 
While I 
was plantin' flowers, 
And he sthruck me michty hard; 
As sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though 'tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of the many poor families who had nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, ' Give bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot, gave his office for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at their ease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
Stood Governor Wade Hampton giving bread to the poet 
As sung by R. HUNTING. 
Give my boxing gloves to brother, mamma, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under—in my little bed ; 
Irthe job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath in Florida water, for I 
see the gates ajar; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric, there is nothing about me mean; 
Give the sexton a 
half a 
dollar to see that my grave is kept 
green. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't need it more, 
On my gums it raised a 
blister, they are awful sore ; 
Give away my ragged, 
jacket, mamma, don't you cry, 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, how is that for high ? 
Hit me with a 
big tomato, stab me with a 
pie, 
Let me bite my little sister in the sweet by and by ; 
Smother me up with water melons, give me a 
little sugar and 
-gin; 
Fill my stomach up with gum drops, then wipe off my little 
chin. 
Throw me in a 
bed of apple dumplings, I 
Put a 
porus plaster on my stomach, then 
vest ; 
Mamma, I 
want to be an angel, mamma, 
I'm getting hungry, I 
could eat a 
bale of 
want to go out West; 
pull down my little 
what'd you say? 
hay.

TRIMBLE. 
Performed in his 
"Mystic Changes." 
Good evening to you all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dress in this fashion, 
Pray don't think me rude; 
I'm leader of the style, 
That's plain enough to see, 
So if you want the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
All pinned back I 
all pinned back! 
It's the style, you see; 
All pinned back I 
all pinned back! 
That's the style for me. 
Some people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a 
pinned-back, 
But that is foolish talk; 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you ag_ 3, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
All pinned back, etc. 
AN ORIGINAL AND BEAUTIFUL BALLAD, 
Words by Thos. Daly. Music by Willis Clark. Air by Morton Emerson. 
Notes by Wm. Daly. 
'Neath the gleaming of the wildwood by the starlight, 
Where the purpling of the daylights gentle fall, 
Lived a 
loving, laughing darling, charming maidlet, 
Diving deeply in the denseless of the doll. 
CHORUS. 
Standing by the gatelet, 
Where the merry maiden waitlt. 
I 
tell you it was greatlet, 
Such 
charming happy fatelet, 
Where the hilltops were floating in the bro-•zes, 
Dodging hailstones from the gay simoon, 
Picking sponges in the dewlight of the moo

'Neath the darling, charming, oNjibhoon. 
Cnottus. 
Oh, such a 
happy lotlet, 
Standing by the cotlet,

Understand. 
Yriginally sung by Winn H. M ORTON, America's Comique, at the 
Holiday Street Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
This world's a 
mighty riddle, very difficult to solve, 
Is a 
maxim that you'll hear on every side, 
It's a 
game of cards in fine, although money's lost and won, 
While struggling both with poverty and pride, 
For instance there's the poor man that labors for his 
bread, 
When trials and want assail his every hand, 
Where's the money that's been paid to assist him I'm 
afraid 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
This nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But there's fishes in the sea that ain't been caught, 
And the style that we've been ruled, plainly tells us 
we've been fooled, 
Even Congressmen ain't honest as they aught, 
But still many things that in our memory rings, 
Of men whose lip and purposes were grand, 
Why Boss Tweed died in prison, while his partners they 
went free, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
-You have heard it doubtless said that a 
fool is easy led, 
it's a 
saying that is sometimes very true, 
But curious to relate how in these United States 
There's a 
class of men known by most of you, 
I 
mean actors that are bad, there are hundreds to be had, 
Yes, a 
thousand waiting if you should command, 
With the salary managers give, how in heavem's name 
they live, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
Written and composed by G. W. HUNT. 
Sung by LYDIA M OMPSON. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And, sometimes, I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright; 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they, their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But, first, as a 
caution I 
say. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say, 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you arel 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man, as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me, he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanni's they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time, whene'er it comes round, 
Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Ohl and would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marria,ge a mansion. and carriage, 
Of course, I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, etc, 
I 
Havn't an Equal. 
Written by CHAS. DOCKSTADER for SHEEHAN and JoNEs. 
Oh some facts I 
am now going to tell ye's, 
And of course I'll enlighten your minds, 
Whin you've heard all me discourse this evening, 
Faith I 
hope you's won't turn away blind. 
I'm a 
great politician and statesman likewise; 
I 
could greatest improvements invent. 
Then form strong resolutions widout desolutions, 
And make me your next President, 
CHORUS. 
I 
am courted be young girls and ladies, 
They're in love wid me style and me grace, 
Ah, me figure and form are intrancing; 
Don't you think I've an ilegant face ? 
Well, I'm Irish, and I 
knows you's don't think it, 
For of course ye's all thought I 
was Frinch; 
I've the greatest respect for officials, 
From a 
policeman till the judge on his binch. 
I've a 
friend in the city in business— 
He does carry a 
sign for a 
store— 
He's a 
man of high standing and laming, 
And his equal you never see more, 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
cart and a 
proud Irish donkey, 
And I 
often goes out for a 
drive. 
Shure I 
has the whole neighborhood crazy 
In the part of the town I 
reside. 
Isaac and Moses. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung by HOWARD and THOMPSON 
nightly at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
We keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that come to us, 
He wanted to buy a 
coat ; 
So help my Jimmy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
CHORUS. 
Isaac and Moses sells old clotheses, 
Down in Baxter street ; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say: 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two. 
He made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store ; 
We pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
He brought in all his gang. 
T.;aac and Moses. 4o. 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CIIORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

Johnny McGrath. 
Composed, written and sung by M. J. ENNIS, the popul

and Comic Vocalist. 
Come all you tender-hearted, a 
story I 
will tell, 
It's about a 
true-born Irishman who on Dutch hill did dwell, 
He had an only daughter, and her name was Mary Ann, 
She'd lovers all by the score, to come at her command. 
CHORUS. 
Shinah, Shinah, Coka, anis a 
gal a 
fennah, hun, 
Hum, ah hum, argue a 
wallowah and me rummer vickah. 
Now Mary Ann loved a 
nice young man, and his name was 
Johnny McGrath, 
He had a 
city sinecure, a 
driving a 
big ash cart, 
He gathered up stuff in the Nineteenth Ward, and he loved 
his Mary Ann, 
He was second 
cousin 
to 
Harry Genet, 
the runaway 
Assemblyman. 
Now Mary Ann's father was wealthy, and own'd a 
big jackass. 
He was a 
noble boxer, and he wouldn't stand much sass; 
He said that Mary Ann must marry, there was no disputing 
that, 
To Billy Gillholly, who used to make soap fat. 
When Johnny McGrath had heard the news, the truth I 
will 
have you to know, 
He went and hired a 
big canal boat, and up East River did go; 
The boat it sank, and they were drowned in the bottom of 
the sea, 
On account of Billy Gillholly and her father's cruelty. 
When Mary Ann's father heard the news, he was very much 
in dread, 
He went and swallowed an ash barrel, and shot himself with 
a 
pig's head, 
And Billy Gillholly got blind drunk, as you can plainly hear; 
He slipped and fell, on Fourth avenue, and broke his ear. 
Come all you cruel parents, warning take, I 
pray, 
Don't force your daughters for to wed, or they'll surely run 
away 
Like Mary Ann and Johnny McGrath, that loved each other 
so dear, 
So I 
think I'll tumble to miself and drink a 
schooner of beer.

As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth Ward, 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' I 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Cle:r 
the way." 
Oh I for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCloskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk, & c. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked theiplatfonn down, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
I'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day.

Good evening to ye's, one and all,

The subject of me song is one 
To you I'll now make mention. 
It's about a

Although it comes but once.a year, 
That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The drums will beat and the bands will play, 
As down the street we march away, 
That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
If you meet me on that day, 
You must not get offended, 
For what I

It never is intended.

CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track •, 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & e.

The Lackawanna Spooners. 
THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP. 
Jriginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden ; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, &c.,

Ali I 
well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
( 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She topped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
'The lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, &a.

THE LABORING MAN FOR ME. 
Written expressly for, and sung by the Munnocus. 
Don't talk to me of kings and earls, 
Wearing crowns and coronets, 
The men who snub our boys and girls, 
But never pay their debts; 
But give me those who work and strive, 
To gain success at last, 
The man who labors hard to thrive, 
And never lives too fast. 
CHORE'S. 
Then cheer him on 
cheer him on! 
The laboring man for me, 
Cheer him on! cheer him on I 
The man of honesty ; 
Cheer him on! help him on! 
The free- born man of toil, 
The laboring man for me, boys, 
The honor to our soil. 
Give him a 
place among the great, 
With those whose names are stainless, 
he'd be a 
blessing to the State, 
How he'd bounce the brainless! 
Their hands are rough their hearts are pure, 
They're down on tyranny, 
The man I'd like, though he be poor, 
The laboring man for me. 
Then cheer him on, etc. 
THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Oh ! Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
for there's a 
bloody law agin, the wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with :Sapper Tandy and he tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for • Wearin' o' 
the Greeu !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed ; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still, tho' under foot ' tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
not show ; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen ; 
But 'till that day, please God, I'll stick to ' Wearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part ; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say. 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day ; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
And where, thank God, we'll live and die, still " Wearin' 
o' the Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.]

The Lads Who Live in Ireland. 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned 0' Alanney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney, 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know; 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other Oa.. bby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show; 
Oh 1 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Psaties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Ppaties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've nun ety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name hasia-Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
a 
rautin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, &c. 
May Hem en still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my 
living breath, and heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry 1 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show, 
Ohl those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he: 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country. 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go.; 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it wili plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, &Q.

Written by FRANK TURNER for JOI1N REILLY. 
Good evening, my friends, you're all looking well, 
I 
came here to see you and my troubles to tell ; 
Whin I 
go along the street the boys at me stare, 
And they all holler out, " John, they want you for Mayor!' 
The other day, walking down Baxter street, 
One fellow said I 
looked like a 
beat, 
I 
ran for the blackguard and pulled down his hair, • 
And he shouted out " John, they want you for Mayor!" 
Their shouting at me I 
now understand, 
It's because they want my education and land. 
They'll never get nothing from me, I 
do swear, 
Unless they all say " John, we want you for Mayor!"

As sung by TIERNEY & CRoNrx 
Above all the pretty sights to see 
In the Park, some afternoon ; 
When all the pretty girls are out, 
Like roses in full bloom. 
• 'Twas at the Park I 
lost my heart,

Next evening, as I 
passed her house, 
I 
called, my love to see; 
We wandered on, side by side— 
'Twas hours of bliss to me; 
We spoke about the sweet music, 
As the moments passed away. 
Oh I 
how I 
felt, I'll ne'er forget, 
When the Band began to play.

HOW I

To hear the rustling corn, 
And watch the silken tassels waving:,

From birds in the woodland gloom,

have now is,

Fairest of all floxers, 
Their odor is perfume. 
But the wish of all I

To live where the roses bloom. 
I 
love to smell the gentle lilac, 
And the honeysuckles climbing on the wall, 
With the brightly colored morning glories twining, 
In their beauty on the wall. 
I 
gathered lilies from the brookside, 
And daisies by the silvery moon, 
But the wish of all I 
have now is, 
To live where the roses bloom.

PAT AND THE WIDOW. 
IRISH SONG. 
fl Ballinaha wanst there dwelt a 
fair widdy, 
Renown'd thro' the country for beauty and wit, 
Tho' coorted by many she cared not for any, 
For Pat wid a 
love-shaft her bosom had hit. 
Oh the glance of her eye sure it bother'd the county, 
' 
Twas bright as the dew on the fresh morning gras89 
And her smile so inviting, set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass, 
And her smile so inviting set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass. 
But Pat was unhappily given to dhrinking, 
And widow O'Grady objected to this, 
For Pat when in whisky was apt to get frisky, 
And folks said he often made off wid a 
kiss. 
Be that as it may, sure the widow spoke plainly, 
And tould him this drinking he'd have to give o'er, 
For she never would marry him while she had to carry him 
Drunk and insensible home to his door, 
No, she would never marry him while she had to carry him. 
Drunk and insensible home to his door. 
3o what did he do but lie made her a 
promise. 
On Irish ground never to taste spirits more, 
But a 
week after that, and the widow saw Pat, 
And he drunk in a 
boat and asleep on his oar, 
PADDY'S DREAM. 
As sung with great success by GARNELLA BROTHERS. 
JOHN BULL he was an Englishman, 
Who went on tramp one day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
For to carry him a 
long way; 
He traveled along for many a 
mile, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Until he met an Irishman 
By the name of Pat Magee. 
Good morning, Pat, says Johnny Bull, 
Where are you going to? 
Oh, faith, I 
do not know, says Pat, 
Pm looking for a 
job to do. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Paddy? 
Says Johnny Bull to Pat. 
Sure it's the only thing I'm wanting, 
For I 
havn't got nary a 
rap. 
They had not travelled very far, 
When a 
Scotchman, like them, out of work, 
And by his look and appearance, 
As hungry as a 
Turk. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty? 
Says bold Paddy Magee. 
I 
canna do that, says the Scotchman, 
For I 
han'tia got nary a 
bubee. 
Ch, I 
have got a 
three-pence, 
What shall we do with that? 
Buy three-pence worth of whiskey, 
'Twill cheer us up, says Pat, 
Oh dinna do that, says Scotty, 
I'll tell you what we'll do, 
Buy three-pence worth of oat meal. 
I'll make some nice bergue. 
Oh no, we'll buy a 
loaf of bread, 
The Englishman did say, 
And in yonder hay-stack 
We'll sleep our hunger away. 
Well get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning, 
Who dreams the greatest dream. 
Now, the Englishman, by the morning, 
Ten million men had been 
For years a 
digging a 
turnip out, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip out, 
By working night and day, 
It took four million horses 
This turnip to 'aul away. 
Now the Scotchman, by the morning 
Forty million men had been 
For years a 
making a 
boiler, 
The largest ever seen. 
What was it for ? says John Bull, 
Was it make of copper or tin ? 
'Twas made of copper, says Scotty, 
To boil your turnip in. 
SPOKEN. --Now comes Pat's dream. 
Oh, sure, I've been dreaming, 
And dramed a 
pleasant dream. 
I 
dramed I 
was in a 
hay-stack, 
All by a 
purling stream. 
And you and Scotty were there too, 
You were, upon my oath, 
By the powers, I 
dreamed I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and ate the loaf.

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed by JOITSNY ROACH. 
COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
Yor you have to light both day and night 'gainst John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight both day and night, all for that sham, 
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town, 
And ' nigh a 
ballagh, clear the track !" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrocli 
grows 
Then hurrah, Sze.

domposed ti-R1 sung with great success by HARRY OSBORNE. 
I 
am Pat O'Neil, an Irishman, 
Just from the county Clare,— 
As smart vs any ever walked 
To country dance or fair, 
But poverty the poor man's lot, 
Drove me across the sea, 
To find a 
home in this fair land 
Of sweet America. 
CHORUS. 
Many h 
noble minded man 
For refuge flew to thee ; 
Your ports are always open, 
Ever ready is your hand, 
To welcome here both great and small 
From dear old Ireland. 
When I 
was home I 
often heard 
Of a 
country tar away, 
Where the rich and poor they both enjoy 
The same bright light or day ; 
Then my heart says rat don't work no more 
For nobles without pay, 
But go and gain your liberty 
In sweet America. 
Many a 
noble, etc. 
I'll not forget the noble flag, 
That guards our liberty,— 
Inviting those who are opposed, 
To come across the sea; 
Hoping that the day may come 
When Ireland will be free,— 
I'll 'nave you all to give three cheers 
For sweet America.

JOHN REILLY'S BUCK GOAT, 
Written by D. A. KI'LLY. 
Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
Copyright secured. 
Of John Reilly's Buck Goat I 
will tell, 
And the troubles which he did cause. 
It would take a 
whole volumn to tell 
The way in which he transgressed the laws. 
He was the terror of the whole neighborhood, 
sPivil a 
one would come near him at all. 
A 
policeman, who swore fight him he would, 
lie ate up coat-tails and all. 
CHORUS. 
Bad luck to that Goat— 
The dirty old bloat 
He ate Reilly's pants, 
And swallowed his coat; 
He ate forty candles, 
And twenty pump-handles, 
And ready for more 
Was John Reilly's Buck Goat. 
The people all rose up one night, 
Swore the Goat they would kill upon sight. 
Next day, in a 
body, after taking their toddy, 
They went for the Buck Goat to fight. 
The Goat met them as they came down the street, 
lie let fly with both his hind feet. 
When the battle was over the Goat was in clover, 
For he was the king of the street. 
CHORUS. 
The Goat felt so proud 
Of bating the crowd, 
He ate a 
shoemaker, 
By the name of Pat Dowd; 
He ate the leather, the lasts, 
And the twenty-four pails, 
And finished with a 
keg 
Of ten- penny nails. 
Then up stepped brave Michael MeNalley, 
Who cornered the Goat in an alley. 
They fought for four hours, and then, by the powers, 
Divil a 
thing was there left of McNally. 
It was then that I 
threw off my coat, 
And swore I 
would murder the Goat, 
Who took a 
look at my hat, and split up the back, 
And that was the end of the Goat. 
CHORUS. 
So you see this old hat 
Laid Reilly's Goat flat. 
He'll never come back; 
I'll answer for that. 
So you may all of you hoot it— 
Or else try to boot it, 
But I 
never will boot it, 
My darling old hat I 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT Room, 
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
He had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
He married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
but rocks; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken to a coal yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings.

You may talk about your grand parades or anything so gay, 
hut we're raising a 
company for next St. Patrick's Day. 
With the colors of old Ireland we'll make the people glad, 
'Twill be the finest show, my boy, that New York ever had. 
CHORUS. 
With regalias looking bright and umbrellas in hand, 
We'll march down to Hibernia Hall, and there we'll make a 
stand; 
With the shamrock in our hats, and biled shirts looking fine, 
With an Irish band in front of us, we then will fall in line. 
We do honor to St. Patrick, ould Ireland's greatest saint, 
l'e gob, whin we turn out, me boys, we make the ladies faint. 
With all the Father Matthew clubs to fall with us in line, 
And noble band of Plibernians, I 
tell you ' twill be fine. 
With regalias looking bright, 8.r.c. 
We'll have the 69th with us,whose show would break your heart, 
We'll march the city through and through when once we make 
a 
start. 
And arm in arm together the best of friends we'll be, 
From the laborers on the pipes above to the mayor of our city. 
With regalias looking bright, &c. 
So now, brave boys, we must be off, we can no longer stay, 
And if we think we've pleased you we'll call another day. 
Your kind applause we hope you'll grant, to do our best 
we've tried, 
So don't forget us Irish boys that stand here side by side.

I wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp et Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured " Shamrock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green. 
CHORUS. 
My blessings on those emblems 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
Because that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those, etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair; 
Green threads of father's jacket, 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
My father kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea, 
And bade Inc wear those emblems, 
"For mother dear and me." 
My blessings on those, etc.

On the 13th of Octember, 
In the middle of July, 
The morning it was raining 
And the afternoon was dry, 
I 
spied a 
lovely damsel 
Sitting under an old oak tree, 
And I 
didn't say nothing to her, 
And she said the same to me, 
She was a 
lovely creature, 
Which plain was to be seen, 
Her brow and chin were far apart, 
And her nose stuck out between. 
Her teeth were neither black nor white, 
And she had a 
swivel eye, 
And a 
lovelier mouth was never seen 
For ham or chicken pie. 
Oh, I 
wish I 
was the President 
Of this great country, 
I 
would spend the Summer at Long Branch, 
In a

I

I'd smoke the best cigars, 
And whin I'd go to Washington 
I'd ride in special cars.

The N. Y. Evening Mail writer 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 9SITas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the-bad habit of 
flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any furthernecessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initia4 the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat ?fillet 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Price 25 Cents.

American Fortune-Telling C't:rds.—This is the iold-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades--and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
mad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case

sotirlii,g Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 0. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by _Alemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyedin the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi• 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of conrtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
