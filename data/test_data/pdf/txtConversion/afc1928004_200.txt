BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

ANDY McKEE. 
Was born in Little Rock, May 11th, 1844. 
His parents moved 
North to Newport., Ky., opposite Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1852, 
which has been the stamping ground of Andy ever since. 
Ile 
has danced all of the cellar doors bare long ago. 
His father, 
Captain James McKee, one of the oldest Ohio, Mississippi and 
Arkansas river pilots up to his death, also owner and builder 
of several steam boats. 
The old gentleman thinking it best to 
learn Andy a 
trade, tocik hint on the river with him to learn him 
the trade of piloting. 
But it was soon very evident such was 
not his calling, for while he was at the wheel, his feet kept up 
to the time of Gay and Festive Boy—then a 
very popular song. 
After trying the life of a 
soldier for two or three years until 
1865, he entered the minstrel profession, and chose it for a 
livelihood. 
He at once knew it was his calling, his first en-
gagement was Cairo, becoming a 
favorite at once at Canter-
bury, under the management of George Shields, 
he led the 
manager to believe he was an old performer in order to obtain 
the situation, but making a 
confident of the stage manager,Mr. 
Hen. Mason. 
Saying, Hen. this is my first appearance, Mason 
closed his bad eye, 
saying, keep it up you are a success. 
Taking other engagements in variety shows in Memphis, St, 
Louis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, &c., until he joined Skiff and 
Goylard's Minstrels, for whom he proved a 
card, traveling nine 
months with them. 
Afterwards making his first appearance in 
4 
the East with Hoolev's Minstrels, at Newburg, N. Y., traveling 
as Song and Dance man,opening in Brooklyn,N.Y., and was im-
mediately stamped as the most original eccentric dancer on the 
American stage of which style of dancing he is the original; he 
has many copies but no rivals. 
Ills ' text opening was at the 
IIoward Atheneum, Boston, where he itst found to his own in-
terest that he deserved a 
big salary, failing to get the salary 
he asked, he accepted an enga,gement to travel with Sam Sharp-
ley's Minstrels,down East and through the British Provinces un-
til the opening of the Adelphi Theatre Comique, Boston, and 
remained five months as the standing favorite as Song and 
Dance man for a 
big salary, under the management of John 
Stetson. 
This next engagement was with Manning's Minstrels, Chi-
cago. 
After Manning's partner, Mr. Billy Emerson, drew out, 
the question was what will we do for a 
song and dance man. 
Andy McKee was engaged, and this was his greatest success 
when all expected a 
failure. 
He might well be proud of the 
hit he made at the old Dearborn. 
IIis next engagement was 
Simmon's and Slocum's Minstrels, Globe Theatre, N. Y., Tony 
Pastor's, and many other engagements until his return to Chi-
cago, where he remained till the burning of that city when he 
gave up single business and took Steve Rogers for a 
partner. 
Their first production was Rzbeeca Jane, and such a 
success 
that it was copied by other people. 
These gentlemen, McKee 
and Rogers, stand without a 
rival, and they are at the very 
head of their profession. 
They produce more new acts and 
original dances than any double in their line ; Harrigan and 
Hart also deserve credit. 
McKee and Rogers are at present 
traveling with a 
company of their own and they are received 
with rounds of applause nightly. 
STEVE ROGERS. 
vata born in Elmira, N. Y., Dec. 11, 1853. 
Entering the bust-
ne.ss at the age of twelve as clog dancer known as Master Steve 
Itogers. 
Traveling with Tilston's Variety Show -very much

against the wishes of his parents by a 
great deal of persuasion 
and fur a 
trial they allowed him to accept an engagement with 
the 50 Engineer Pontoon Minstrels, afterwards called Wag-
nar, Wright & Deco's Minstrels ; his next engagement was 
such a 
success with Davis' Theatre Comique Company that he 
was sought after by New York managers, for he was talked of 
as the most graceful clog dancer for a 
boy ever seen. 
He was 
engaged by Charley White, 172 Broadway, where he made his 
bow to a 
New York audience, and was a 
big succa, and was 
spoken of as the finest clog dancer and the nicest behaved boy, 
in the profession, and he bears that name yet. 
IIis New York 
engagements were Kelly and Leon's, and Hooley's Minstrels, 
Brooklyn. After playing a 
long and successful engagement there 
lie accepted engagements South in variety shows. His next en-
gagement traveling was with Larue's Carnival Minstrels. 
Re-
maining nine months, tilling numerous engagements of all 
kinds, he finally joined Manning's Minstrels, at that time trav-
eling. 
Ile opened with the party at New Albany, Indiana, in 
a 
triple clog dance, with M. Kanane and Eddie Manning, and 
in the fall went, to Chicago, his first appearance there, and 
it wasn't long until every one knew of little Steve Rogers. 
lie 
remained there up to the time of the Chicago fire, where McKee 
and Rogers concluded to take away the name of Andy and 
Steve, and let it be McKee and Rogers as it is now, and he is 
now the youngest manager in the profession. 
He is honorable 
in all his dealings, and treats all as he would have them treat 
him, 
Ile is loved by his profession, and respected by all that 
know him 
We must forget our (once) little Steve Rogers, and 
remember he is fast approaching manhood, and with his part-
ner to make a 
PAIR they are unapproachable. 
McKee and Rogers are the oric,inals of the following acts : 
Rebecca Jane, Mischief, Lucinda, Octoroon, and Black Aris-
tocrats.

In Southern Africa.

are bloods, 
At least the people say, 
And more than that the ladies' pet and joy,

ERASTUS HUNKY DORY, 
By -NED STRAIGIIT, for ANDY MCKEE., 
OH my name it is Erastus Flunky Dory. 
I'm a 
pet among the ladies' so they say, 
I'm fond of fun and full of modern glory, 
You can bet I 
am the gayest of the gay, 
Oh there is one to whom I'm paying my addresses, 
She's sweeter than a 
sweet potato vine. 
She wears such bright and golden curlity , tresses. 
So I'm longing for the day when she'll be mine. 
Crronus. 
She's sweet, [Break], so neat [ Break], 
She's sweeter than sweet potato vine, 
She wears such bright and golden tresses, 
I'm longing for the day when she'll be mine. 
Cue evening- while with her promenadin, 
The twinkling stars had just began to peep, 
The glorious light of day was lastly fadinp-. 
All nature calm and hushed as in a 
sleep ; 
She took a 
seat beside a 
bunch of roses, 
I 
placed myself directly at her feet, 
While she admired the violets and posies, 
I 
whispered in her ear that he was sweet. 
SNOW FLAKE.

OH two reckless careless Nigs are we, 
And of dancing never tire, 
When massa's in his bed asleep, 
We're like two coons on wire, 
But should he chance to catch us here, 
He'd lick us sure's you're born, 
And that won't suit George and Erastus Snow Flake. 
Oh now the day is breaking, 
We must cut our sticks and go, 
To our daily labor in the field, 
The cotton for to hoe, 
So now we'll bid you all good bye, 
And hop3 that you are pleased, 
With George and Erastus StIOW Flake. 
DRUM MAJOR.

They envy us I 
wager now, 
Wouldn'tithey all like to be, 
This Grenadier Drum Major. 
CHORUS. 
While marching through the Park, 
Marching through the Park, 
We hear the drums go rum turn turn, 
While marching through the Park. 
As we go marching by there's many a 
pretty face, 
That always has a 
smile for us and our gold lace, 
At the girls we wink, which makes them think, 
In talk we would engage her, 
But bless their hearts we love them all, 
That's a 
Grenadier Drum Major. 
While marching, & c.. 
DARK-EYED EMILIE DER 
Written by ANDY MCKEE; dedicated to BESSIE SHANNON. 
'TWAS at the Howard in Boston, 
One autumn evening there, 
T 
caught a 
glance ' twits full of smiles, 
From Emilie Dee so fair. 
.7;he was dressed all up in fashion, 
And oh, so fair to see, 
thd my heart was captivated by 
That dark-eyed Emilie Dee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! it you only knew her 
You could sympathize wh h 
me. 
For my heart is almost breaking for this 
Dark-eyed Emilie Dee. 
Soon we became acquainted, 
Learned to love like birds in spring, 
Should you pass her house by day or night, 
This song you'll hear her sing 
But now if I 
were with her, 
flow happy would I 
be, 
I'd be content at listening 
To the voice of Emilie Dee. 
LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula,, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my jewel, ray heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh! its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though she says on her life she'll ne'er be my wife, 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
Ohl beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still, 
lity witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morning. 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the pell of a 
charmer; 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled; 
What care I 
for life if she'd by my wife, 
Vy own little darling Patchoula.

A 
STORY I 
vill tell you my heart is beating so, 
For love is such a 
funny thing, 
But that you all must know, 
The object of affection that stole my heart away, 
Is a 
charming, darling little girl I 
think you all will say. 
CHORUS. 
Oh when the hells are ringing, oh liow happy I 
shall be, 
For then we shall be married, and she will belong to me, 
She's the neatest and the sweetest and the prettiest girl 
I 
know. 
Her gloves are number sixes, her shoes are number three, 
Her dress i;; in the latest style and fits her to a 
T, 
And when Nve're promenading:. we take up all the way, 
And w‘uen she hangs upon my arm, 
You hear the people say. 
Oh when the bells, &c. 
But now I've got to leave you, I 
know she's on the street, 
I 
told her when we pirted last, 
The day that we should meet, ' 
So if you doubt my story. 
And think she won't be mine, 
The wedding bells the sequel tells, 
The first day that its fair. 
Oh when tlif; bells, IN.

A GAY young man your gazing on 
Which you can't help but say, sir,

With a 
mutton singer gay, sir, 
She's fair, she's neat, she's beautiful, 
And she's as graceful as a 
mule, 
She came from College with McCool, 
This dashing mutton singer. 
ller feet are flat, one ear's bit off, 
She's a 
captivating dame, sir, 
She's crazy and gone oft to preach 
Along with Francis Train, sir, 
She's handsome as you may suppose, 
You% knov: her by her broken nose, 
It sounds like thunder when it's blow'd, 
Oh ! where's my mutton singer. 
A 
fiat boat ride's her chief delight, 
While with another fellow 
Her coach and four is a 
mule and cart, 
Or a 
bursted umbrella, 
She colognes her hair with monkey grease. 
Until we're married 
have no peace, 
Won't some one kil. that homely beast, 
This euphonious muttor singer.

DARLING IRENE, 
Composed by JAKE TANENBAUM. 
WHEN I'm far away from our fond village home, 
In countries way over the sea, 
Remember me darling, and do not forget, 
Irene to write often to me: 
You'll tell me how baby is getting along, 
And how he's growing the while, 
For then I 
can't dandle the duck on my knee, 
Cr look at his cunning sweet smile. 
CHORUS. 
Write to me often, Irene darling, do, 
When I'm far away over the sea. 
For rifle thinking, Irene dear, of you, 
So Irene do write often to me. 
When snow's of bleak winter has mantled the earth, 
And everything's dreary and sad, 
You'll write to me, Irene, I 
hope dearest one, 
Epistles to make my heart glad, 
You'll tell me baby has cut his wee teeth, 
And when he commences to walk, 
And Irene, remember, to write me the day, 
You first hear the dear chimp talk. 
Wh en birds i

And lillies bloom fresh in ti R3vale, 
Forget me not. Irene, but think of the ,. 1111), 
On which your dear husband does sail, 
It may be long years ere my steps I 
retrace, 
To you and our fond village home, 
But write to me often Irene darling do, 
No matter where ere I 
may roam.

PITY the homeless, pi ly the poor, 
By the fierce lire th ,til fo:ced to your door, 
List to their pleading, list to their cry, 
Pass them not heedlessly by. 
Roused 1%.orn their slumber. peaceful and sweet, 
Hastening in ten' r 
into the street, 
Leaving behind them treasures most dear, 
Flying in anguish and fear. 
(Repeat .11r.st four lines.) 
See how the fire king leaps in his joy, 
As his dread minions haste to destroy, 
See how the home once pon.:::::11 and fair, 
Wrapped in the names melt ii air,

Shelterless, foodless, wearily roam,

THE subject of my song is not so very new, 
'Tis, of a 
handsome yellow gal I 
love so fond and truo, 
Her eyes are black as night so black they're ahno ,1 
And her foot is just the size to fit a 
number seven sbt.e 
CHORUS. 
For she's as gentle as a 
turtle dove. 
And her name is Araminta Susan Brown, 
She dresses like a 
belle and she loves this darkey well. 
She's the nobbiest gal that promenades the town. 
I 
pay for all her clothes and she has ' em made in style, 
She never drinks a 
drop, but often takes a 
little smile, 
She dances like a 
sylph, and looks so gay and neat, 
As she shakes a 
jig to pieces, with her number seven feet. 
For she's, & c. 
I 
asked the other day if she would marry me, 
She said she eolith-Ct tell me then, but if I'd wait she'd see, 
I 
pressed my suit so eagerly, she didn't know what to do, 
But she said she'd have me 
if I'd take her number seven shoe, 
For she's, dx.

MY DEAR LITTLE HOME. 
By Harry Percy of Concross & Dixey's Minstrels, sung by 
H ENRIETTA BAZZEL, of Newport, Ky. 
THERE'S a 
little white cot that is dearer than life, 
Where I 
haste when the day's toil is o'er, 
Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
Oh ! the smile of a 
fond loving wife there 
see, 
And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no treasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own. 
CifoRus. 
I've a 
dear little home, yes a 
home of my own, 
I've a 
nice little home of my own, 
And no king is more proud as he sits on his throne; 
Than am I 
in my dear little home. 
Oh ! when ever I 
roam from this little white cot, 
In the hurry and noise of the day, 
My heart gladly turns to that heaven-like spot, 
And I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
And I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round my neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisome now, 
Far away from my dear little home. 
I've a 
dear little home, &-c! 
At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet, 
I 
wander again to the door, 
Where the loving ones over and over repeat, 
Their welcoming to me once more, 
As I 
sit by the fire with the children around, 
I 
think of the many that roam; 
No place for a 
shelter, no bed but the ground, 
No dear little home like my own. 
I've a 
dear little home, &c.

LONE and weary through the streets we wander, 
For we have no place to lay our heads, 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
For both our parents now are dead; 
Poor mother died when we were both young, 
Yet father made for us a 
home, 
But now he's killed by falling timbers, 
And we are left here all alone. 
CHORUS, Repeat first four lines. 
Who will pity us and who will give us shelter, 
Through this sad and lonely night, 
Little brother now is cold and hungry, 
And the tears roll down his cheeks so white, 
Oh ! if our mother now was left us, 
Then she would care for us to-night, 
But all ! 
the angels they have borne her, 
Unto a 
home where all is bright. 
Lone and weary, &c.

ERIN FAR AWAY, 
Sung by EDDIE PowElls the Irish nightingale at Kerns & Powers 
Opera Hou,ie, corner of Pi-ince & Crosby streets. 
He never sings 
this only when he wishes 10 keep his audience all night. 
THE morn looked down from an azure sky, 
When the deadly fight was o'er, 
On the battle field were the brave laid low, 
Whom this life could claim no more, 
And its pale light cast on the damp cold earth, 
Where a 
wounded soldier lay, 
O'er whose form cl.ept the breath of death, 
As his life tide flowed away. 
In this verse he gets very much excited and falls against the bar. 
A 
comrade passing heard his moans, 
And soon the sufferer found, 
And gently raised his aching head, 
From ofl the crimsoned ground, 
Sweet words of hope and thoughts of home, 
Ile whispered in his ear, 
And spoke he of the victory, 
Which they had won so dear. 
This verse is great graft for the boys. 
The dying soldier raised his head, 
And gently brushed aside, 
The raven locks that his heart's blood, 
To crimson red had dyed, 
And faintly, slowly, comrade said, 
Not long on earth's my stay, 
No more we'll roam in my childhood's home, 
In Erin far away. 
Is where he calls in Police ( to drink.) 
But a 
lock of hair I 
pray you bear, 
To my mother o'er the sea, 
That when upon it she may look, 
She will kindly think of me. 
And tell her though mid India's sands, 
My mouldering dust may lay, 
My heart is still with Erin, 
Loved Erin far away. 
Here is where the gang shed tears (for a 
ball.) 
Tell my sister though long years have passed, 
Since I 
saw her smiling face. 
That her form is present to my mind, 
Each feature I 
can trace, 
And at this my last, and dying hour, 
My wandering thoughts now stray, 
To the grassy glade where oft we played, 
In Erin far away. 
Eddie becomes weak and calls for assistance—Gus. 
Tell my brothers that I 
nobly fell, 
And as our father died, 
With my bayonet charging on the foe, 
And my sabre by my side, 
It nerved my heart to conquer, 
And the sepoy foe to slay. 
As visions bright crept o'er my sight, 
Qf Erin far Away,

fell the friends with whom in childhood I 
played, 
Around the old oak tree, 
That my last breath blessed them dying, 
In a 
ciim3 far o'er the sea, 
And tell them that I 
bled and fought, 
On this eventful day, 
For Britain's honor, Britain's Queen, 
And Erin far away. 
Iris audience discovered asleep in all directions round the floor. 
No more he said his eyes grew dim, 
Ere the next sun had shed 
her glowing beams upon the earth, 
The vital spark had fled: 
A 
grave was made in which he was laid, 
Ere closed the waning day, 
Far from each haunt he loved so well. 
In Erin far away. 
Slow fire— red music.

COME O'ER THE MOONLIT SEA, 
COME o'er the moonlit sea love, 
The waves are brightly glowing, 
The wind has sunk to his evening rest, 
And the tide is gently flowing, 
My barque is in the bay, love, 
And it only waits for thee, 
When its silken sails shall throw, love, 
Dark shadows on the sea. 
[Repeat first four lines.] 
All is still save the echo songs, 
Of Italia's dark-eyed daughters, 
Or the distant sound of the boatman's oar, 
As it clips in the sparkling waters, 
Though bright the morn may beam love, 
Upon the smiling sea, 
Dearer far than the morn, 
Is the moonlit waves to me. 
Will you come, &c.

MY NATIVE LAND. 
MT native land, green Erin's Isle, 
I 
still remember thee, 
Though in this land where freedom smiles, 
Thou still art dear to me, 
Where'er I 
roam, where'er I 
go, 
I 
never can forget 
My childhood's happy home, 
I 
love thee fondly yet. 
And cruel fate would have it so, 
That parted we must be, 
For back to thee I 
cannot go 
To live in slavery, 
But oh I 
love my childhood's home, 
Ah! who indeed would not, 
Fe- 3r fl thee I 
ne'er return,

PIRATE'S SERENADE. 
MY boat's by the tower and my barques in the bay, 
Both must begone e'er the dawn of the day, 
The moon's in her shroud but to guide thee afar, 
On the deck of the Daring's a 
love-lighted star. 
Cnorms. 
Wake lady, wake, I 
am waiting for thee , 
This night and forever, my bride thou shalt be. 
Forgive my rough mood unaccustomed to see, 
I 
woo not perhaps as the land lovers do, 
For my voice has been tuned to the note of the gun, 
That startles the deep when the corn! ,at's begun. 
And heavy and hard is the grasp of that hand, 
Whose glove has been ever the guard of the band, 
But think not of these and this moment be mine, 
Aud the proudest shall lower his plume unto thine. 
Wake lady, & c. 
One hundred shall serve thee, the best of the brave, 
And the chief of a 
thousand shall kneel as thy slave, 
Thou shalt reign queen and thy empire shall last, 
Till the red flag by inches is torn from the mast, 
Now fast to the lattice those silken cords twine, 
They are meet for such fect and such fingers as thine, 
The signal, my mates, hurra for the sea, 
This night and forever my brif.lo thou shall he. 
Wake lady, &c.

LITTLE BARBER SHOP. 
Written by NEIL ROGEES.F 
PM the happiest little dark you've ever seen, 
The reason fll explaim, it's about a 
little gal, 
Whose name is Sal, she's modest and not vain, 
I 
saw she was good looking at a 
glance, 
And tllouvlit that I 
would drop, 
When I 
saw this little spright, 
With heart so gay and light, 
Come * ripping by my little barber shop. 
CHORUS. 
Oh didn't she look sweet, [SimPHA 
This little gal dressed so neat. [ Sy:mm.] 
I'm happy as they make them ever since, 
Busy with my razor and strop, 
The time pass away, thinking of the day 
She came tripping by my little barber shop, 
I 
used to watch for her each afternoon, 
About the hour of two, 
And just as sure as day she'd pass that way, 
And at the window I'd peep through, 
Then from alittle twinkle of her eye, my heart would feel a 
shoe 
I 
couldn't help but stare, 
At this damsel neat and fair, 
While passing by my little barbershop. 
Oh I &C. 
The other day on her I 
made a 
call, 
I 
took her out to ride, when I 
whispered in her ear, 
And said to her my dear, will you become my bride, 
She answered with a 
smile upon her face, 
When the question I 
did pop, 
So without the least (lelay, 
We got married right away. 
Now she's mistress of my little barber shop. 
Oh ! didn't, ctc.

And while in her window st,ly peeping, 
I

To see her taking oil a

And I 
thought that she loved me ; 
She had coal- black eyes, her name was 'Lize,

But found it was no go, 
For she ran off with another nig,

often think about her, 
Iry heart is sad since she has gone away; 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I

One night I 
took her to a

And danced with all night, 
paid her all attention, 
And done everything that's right, 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left Inc standing like a

And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite, &e.

And her tar heel colored moke,

OCTOROON, 
AS I 
was roving down the street, 
The other afternoon, 
While crossing of a 
walk I 
met 
A pretty Octoroon. 
She glanced at me so slyly, 
As iie was passing by, 
I 
never shall forget that 
Darling rougish little eye. (Break.) 
I 
turned around to look at her, 
And others did the same, 
She was so much attraction, 
That they wern't much to blame. 
She was diwged in height of fashion, 
high-heeled boots and musharoon, 
She looked so gay my heart went with 
This pretty Octoroon. 
The other day as I 
walked in 
To an ice-cream saloon, 
I 
got an introduction to 
This pretty Octoroon. 
We chatted there quite sociably

DANCING 
SONG 
ON THE BRAIN 
AND DANCE. 
OF all the nigs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a 
nig as me you never see to set the boards a-ringing; 
I 
go to balls and parties too, in moonlight snow or rain, 
I've got so fond of dancing that I've got dancing on the brain. 
CaoRue. 
You twist your heel and shake your toe, 
Now this is how you do it, (.1fun:c.) 
Everybody's gett:n ; it and none seem to complain, 
I 
reckon it's mighty pleas.ant to have dancing on the brain. 
There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invitation, 
I 
went and got my purtty's on with the greatest exultation; 
I 
was not dancing long, when I 
found it mighty plain, 
That all the gals was after me for dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, &c.. 
Such a 
happy nig I 
do declare was never yet created, 
To dance and sing is my delight, and yet I'm celebrated; 
And how I 
got this dancing fit I 
never can explain, 
But I'll carve my way to glory, oh, with dancing on the brain. 
Yon twist your, &e.

THE YALLER GAL THAT WINKED AT ME, 
34 
WAITING FOR A 
BROADWAY STAGE, 
AS up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
Anil she had such a 
roguish eye; 
Ile!. little short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all the rage; 
She was looking up and down, with a 
pretty little frown, 
%Vatting, for a 
Broadway stage, oh ! 
Ctronus. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
swept sixteen was just her age; 
met her on the cornet.; 
it was there that first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
Sho saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
.last played round her face, and, with such ease and grace, 
Why, like an angel she did seem. 
Bet I 
kept getting like one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage; 
!low I 
wished I'd never have seen that handsome little queen 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh ! 
She was just, 
c. 
Bet a; the ice was broken, my hat of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, she required, soon came by; 
I'Men she said hi tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll meet 
As up the steps her little form did fly. 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me ' twas art age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh! 
She was just, &e. 
As sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
YOUR attention I 
ask for awhile, 
To a 
song I'm t. nng to site; you,

flower garden on

With her tilting hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty 11e yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me. 
As she zikipped across the gutter, iny heart went in a 
flutter 
For the puler gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda. 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and tor life that I 
fiat" won her, 
And married we should be. 
So I'd dress up, arid I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see fly' (1-111' 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me.

And I

You'll be welcomed 1,y a

Now I 
will her describe, 
As I 
met her at the ball; 
She'd it boxing glove upon her head, 
Meant for a

Her waist w,v, tall and slender, 
Her feet like a

And when she took a 
promenade, 
She made the darkeys 
Oh, she was such a

And lingered at the door; 
Oh ! there I 
felt so happy, as 
I'd never felt before! 
I 
asked her mine to be, 
She only gave a 
smile, 
But her eyes they pierced me thro' and throt, 
I

To those who have never perused the sad story of CHARLOTTE 
Tientrme, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, aud glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity it. afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
-written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunat• 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultleso, and her mind. 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane aka kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah 1

This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a

eraxnple that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the
