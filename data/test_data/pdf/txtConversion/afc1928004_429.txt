The Day I 
Played Base Ball. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY 
My name it is O'Hallober, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguards ' tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out, in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out in " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed thorn all, 
iput up me hands to catch a " fly, ' 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball 
I 
thought to San Francisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all, 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said ould man you made a 
fowl, 
An they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish toy, i 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked mc for me photograph 
To bang upon the wall,' 
They said that I 
had won the game 
Though my head was broke and my shoill, 
lame, 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played bl se ball.

I 
LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY Hucams.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me„ 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all al,,ne; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be of good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
Now, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she said? 
And the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters. sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never fear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll live, yes, although we be poor.

KILDARE. 
Words by HARRY OSBORNE. 
Music by CHAS. THATCHER. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE 
and FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
HURRAH for dear old Ireland! 
That diamond in the sea. 
We drowned our sorrow, dance and sing, 
Sure we're always full of glee. 
We've heard of other countries, 
Of climes so rich and rare, 
But there cannot be a 
happier home 
Than sweet sunny Kildare. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see the Sun-burst rising 
On thy green hills, Kildare. 
The little sprig of Shamrock, 
It proves but one in three, 
Springing from dear Erin's soil, 
That plant of liberty. 
St. Patrick, he revered it, 
So let this be our prayer, 
That the emblem of our country 
May wave triumphant in the air. 
Crwaus. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see again the emerald hills 
Of our native home, Kildare,

THE EMBLEMS OF IRELAND. 
As sung by W ILL H . 
MoirroN, America's Comique, at the Academy of 
Music, Chicago, Ill. 
I wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast, 
The harp entwined with shamrock 
Is the emblem I 
love best, 
They're symbols of old Erin, 
The place that gave me birth, 
The sacred spot of Erin 
IS 
the dearest spot on earth. 
Cflonus. 
The harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
The harp and the shamrock for me, 
When ' ere my voice I 
raise I'll always sing in praise 
Of the harp and shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks 
I 
think of St. Patrick's day, 
And if I 
hear its tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
My spirit overcomes me, 
And on Erin sweet I 
call, 
Just touch the harp of Erin, 
And I'll sing Tara's Hall. 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an emblem great and grand, 
With the wolf dog resting calmly 
Near the round towers of our land, 
Their relics dear to Irishmen, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
Good men are always firm and true 
To emblems of their own. 
(Chorus). 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE and FANNY W ENTWORTH With great 
success. 
AIR.— Slavery Days. 
FATHER. 
DEAR isle of fame and beauty, thy shores have long been trod 
With savage tyrants' footsteps! 
Oh, 'tis sad! 
Thy faithful sons, dear Erin, are banished from thy sod, 
Their homes destroyed, they are dispossessed of all 
We leave the dear old cottage that once we called our own; 
The cursed intruders' minds are satisfied! 
They have caused the young to exile and the old to be forlorn 
On the roadside here we lay our heads to die! 
[Daughter discovers old man at work.] 
DAUGHTER. 
Oh, father, dearest father, you are growing old, I 
see, 
You cannot do that work there all alone, 
And when I 
marry Teddy, oh, father, he will be 
A 
great help on the farm and in our home. 
His heart is stout and bold, the cares of life will not wear 
A. haggard look upon my darling Ted. 
Can I 
be his wife now, father? for to me he is so fair; 
Your refusal, father dear, I 
almost dread! 
FATHER. 
Oh, Norah, with a 
blessing I 
hope the sunshine's rays 
May ever shine upon you and your Ted; 
I 
hope you'll thrive and prosper like the blooming flowers in 
May; 
You'll remember this, my blessing, when I'm dead. 
Go tell the news to Teddy, that your father gave consent, 
And tell him that he is free to name the day; 
But let him seek another land, for he cannot earn the rent I 
Sure, he'll find a 
home in dear America. 
FAREWELL, ALANNA.

Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore, 
Think of me sometimes, should we meet no more, 
And when at night at your bedside you.

Don't forget him who's beyond the blue Sea, 
Farewell, Oh, how that word pierces my heart, 
Must I 
then leave you—must I 
depart, 
Never to see you, to speak to you more, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore I

With sorrow, acushla, my cup's flowing o'er, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore. 
Farewell, alanna I

To friends and to kindred and scenes loved of yore, 
Oft when in silence and sadness I 
mourn, 
To Erin and you shall my spirit return, 
Still in your heart darling let me reside, 
E'en though in far distant lands I 
abide, 
Still remain true to the vows pledged of yore, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore.

WE 
are two Irish emigrants 
Just from across the sea: 
In the steamship " Adriatic," 
Of the White Star line, Ca! e 
we. 
At the Battery Park we landed, 
Bag and baggage here we are— 
Dan Haley and his wife Buddeen— 
From the town of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. • 
We're honest, though poor, 
Bard toil we'll endure; 
Be the pay e'er so little, we are 
Eager for work, and from It ne'er shirk, 
The Haleys from Mullingar. 
We were forced to leave our neat little home, 
It was poverty drove us away! 
They ,deprived us of our piece of land 
When the rent we could not pay! 
They took our pig and praties, 
And our cow sold at the fair I 
Which grieved and almost broke the hearts 
Of the Haleys from Mullingar. 
We're honest, though poor, etc. 
To seek a 
living we find it's hard 
In this free and distant land, 
Without a 
friend or relative 
To lend a 
helping hand. 
The old woman can wash and iron in style, 
While I 
can handle a 
spade or crow- bar; 
So if you hear of a 
job just ple,ase to inform 
The Haleys from Mullingar. 
We're honest, theiigh poor, etc.

By PAT ROONEY. 
Men of learning and high toned people, 
Come draw ye near, and I'll tell you all— 
I 
was brought up well, and educated 
And graduated, from Old Donegal; 
I 
came out here to make a 
living, 
And I 
have made a 
good one, at that; 
But go where I 
natty, you hear them all say, 
That I 
am Mike McNally, the Sound Democrat. 
Big politicans and office-seekers— 
By every one I 
am adored; 
It is my intention, and their invention, 
To make me Governor of the 6th Ward ! 
I 
am well acquainted throughout the City, 
From the Battery to the Harlem Flat— 
But go where I 
may, you hear them say: 
That is Mike McNally, the Sound Democrat!

A. LITTLE way just out of town 
My aunty lives, you know; 
She has a 
thrifty little farm 
Where sometimes I 
do go. 
The house is large, the orchard fine, 
Where splendid fruit does grow, 
And I 
love tc roam amongst the trees 
With my naughty Cousin Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Naughty Cousin Joe, 
Naughty Cousin Joseph! 
Oh, go way! Don't tease me so, 
You naughty Cousin Joe. 
[Repeat. 
I'll ne'er forget on one fine day, 
When I 
was all alone, 
I 
thought I'd like to climb a 
tree 
To see how it was done. 
I 
managed somehow to get up, 
But when I 
reached the bough 
The ladder slipped, and I 
was left 
In a 
pretty plight, I 
vow! 
SPOREN.—And then I 
commenced to scream for— 
Naughty Cousin Joe, etc. 
How Joe did laugh to see me then, 
And how I 
blushed, I 
know, 
For what a 
fool I 
must have looked 
As Joe stood there below! 
However, he soon got me down, 
And no more I'll climb a 
tree; 
And many a 
day I'll recollect 
The kiss that Joe gave me.

I 
took my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did Sta-
te, 
And one and all around her did ekclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilerarna; 
Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked theta what they meant, 
When some one at me sent , 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
"Oh! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their i•eply: 
Oh 1 
Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police l" 
And when he came he looked at tie so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh I 
Emma, eta.. 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man can't you see 
The joke!" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He Said " don't be put out," 
it's a 
saying's got about; 
And then their voices seern'd to rend the skies! 
Oh 1

I 
knew a 
handsome gentleman, 
His name is Sergeant Bluff, 
As member of the National Guards, 
A

I

When marching down Broadway, 
As I 
was out a

One pleasant Summer's day 
As he cried to his men. 
CHORUS. 
Steady there on the left 
By the right flank march, 
March on, march on, march oa,

I

His name is Sergeant Bluff, 
A member of the National Guards, 
A

His dark eyes are as sparkling as 
The dew drops on the trees, 
And when lie wears his soldier's clothes 
The ladies he (loth please, 
As down Broadway they gaily marched, 
Flags and banners flying 
He touched his cap and gaily smiled 
While to the column crying. 
I 
saw his bow so full of Nrace, 
The glance of his bright eye, 
It sent the blood into my face, 
Although I 
knew not why; 
But one short month has scarcely fled, 
And I'm to be his bride, 
ne'er forget that happy day, 
When to his men he cried.

BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
Written by Bonin/ NEWCOMB expressly for W ILL H . 
M ORTON, America's 
Comique. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on my way, 
To my eager footsteps soh the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid, 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she waz. rich, 
Ilow her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
One3 again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed, 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
had been there before us and taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold 
Stole our silver daises and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, Winter was our thief, 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in the fall, 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold.

The Music, Copyrighted and Published by F. W. HELMICK, Of 
No. 50 West 4th Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, can be 
obtained at any Music Store. Price, 40 cents. 
On I 
fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so lair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my.happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Ohl you'll forget-me not!" 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not!" 
(Dance.) 
We met—I 
really don't know where--
But still 'tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " ves I" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage-by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not! 
Chorus and Dance.) 
ERIN'S EMERALD SHORE. 
Words and Music by ROBERT MeRAY, 
I'm lavin' you to-day, 
I'm goin' across the say, 
'Mong strangers in a 
distant land to roam, 
It makes me sad at heart, 
From you my love to part, 
And say good-bye to childhood's happy home, 
Though now in tears we mourn., 
Some day I 
will return 
To meet you and to leave you never more, 
Happy days we yet shall see 
Acushla gramachree, 
Together on ould Erin's emerald StIOre. 
CHORUS. 
Then good-bye, Mollie dear, 
For me have not a

All things for you I'd dare, colleen asthore, 
Look forward to the day, 
It is not so far away, 
When we'll meet upon ould Erin's emerald shore. 
In the land I'm goin' to 
I'll often think of you, 
And the walks we had together by the stream, 
When we whispered words of love, 
An' the little stars above 
For our sake all the brighter seemed to beam, 
Those walks we'll have again 
In the dear old shady lane, 
An' those whispered vows again we'll-whisper o'er, 
An' a 
cabin I 
will buy, 
Where forever you and I 
Will dwell upon ould Erin's emerald shore. 
CHORUS.—Then good-bye, Mollie . dear, -etc..

Oh there is a

He was nabbed by a

His people are nobby, 
On the avenue they swell, 
He's a

On the Isle de Blackwell.

There's Scotty, our keeper, 
We all know his snoot, 
He collars the old togs

Striped like a

Then it's good-bye, farewell, 
We're regular boarders

The 13oarding-llouse Party at Mrs. 
McGee's. 
Written expressly for P. H. CARMODY, and sung by him with success. 
Through respect to her boarders ould Mrs. McGee 
Suggested to have a 
grand party or spree. 
It was hailed with delight, and St. Patrick's night 
Was proposed and accepted to have the soiree. 
With arrangements perfected, the committee selected, 
Floor-manager fell to Sylvester McCann, 
And Archibald Cusick, the Mozart of Music, 
Who plays on the boarding-house organ so grand. 
CHORUS. 
There was cobblers and tailors, kalsominers and grainers, 
Mechanics and tradesmen of no mean degree; 
There was grapers and trampers and pure red-eye samplers, 
At the boarding-house party of Mrs. McGee. 
Mr. J. R. O'Grady, the artistic grainer, 
Was asked for a 
song of the rale Irish Stock; 
He 'd 
in red-eye been dinging, so in humor for singing, 
Requested a 
cane, and he d 
sing them the "Crock." 
You talk of canaries and birds of the prairie, 
His melodious strains they would envy the thrush. 
In antics and prantics he's quite elegantic; 
He's wasting his time with a 
paint pot and brush. 
CHORUS.—There was cobblers, etc. 
The next to respond was a 
tall son of Erin, 
Who recited a 
poem from Boliver Flood. 
Ills name it is Barry,—he the pitcher does carry,— 
And is president, pro-tern, of the " Bursting-Up Club." 
He fought like a 
hero at the battle of "Chronic," 
And escaped all its dangers without wound or scar.. 
He's a 
sound elocutionist—brave elocutionist— 
Hanging up drinks at a 
liquor man's bar.

Words and music by W. J. GROGAN. 
Originally performed by GROGAN AND FARRELL. 
Ort, just condescend to listen 
While our musings we express, 
And tell the trials and troubles 
Of us poor men in distress. 
You see depicted on our face 
The hard life that we live! 
We go out at night requesting aid 
Of those so good to give. 
CHOR US. 
We are not much inclined to work, 
Though we at it long did tarry 
Until dissipation made us quit, 
Then " The Banner we did carry." 
We often with hunger are ailing, 
And our frame with the cold we shrug, 
So don't treat with scorn the poor and forlorn, 
The men of the Hard-up Club. 
To carry the banner it's a 
terrible life, 
Oh, it's feelingly we speak; 
Its broke many a 
constitution down, 
And left a 
strong man weak. 
Our ranks are filling rapidly 
With men of all nations and trades; 
When financially embarrassed 
They fly to us for aid. 
CHORUS. 
We're very often at a 
loss 
To know where we'll repose; 
When we've no money for a 
doss, 
In some tenement we doze. 
Then the police kick and beat us . 
Until our back with pain we rub! 
That's the greeting in the morning 
For the men of the Hard-up Club. 
Some call us " Sons of Chronic!" 
They this title on us confer, 
And say we'd make good lawyers, 
We've such practice at the bar! 
We have often drink's temptation— 
Tried quite hard to resist, 
And often forced, for want of food, 
On spirits to exist! 
CHORUS. 
Each man has got his failing, 
But our failing we regret; 
Through degradation and dissipation 
We're sinking step by step! 
So, young men, in time take warning, 
And our advice don't snub, 
Or some future day, to your dismay, 
You'll be enrolled in the Hard-up Club!

On, 1 was reared in White Chapel, 
A 'prentice I 
was bound; 
No livlier kid was ever known 
Her majesty's country round. 
I 
cut the master short one day 
And started off alone, 
And went to swiping handkerchiefs 
Not many miles from home. 
They shipped me far away 
To a 
penal colony 
Across the deep blue water 
To the isle of Australia. 
I 
took leg bail one day, 
I 
could no longer st ay ; 
I 
slipped the gaol with a 
pleasant gale, 
And sailed from Botany Bay. 
I 
know a 
littlt barmaid, 
All at the Royal Arms; 
She is sweet on this.pre covey 
And his aggravating charms. 
Her parents call her Dolly, 
I 
call her Doll for short; 
I 
gives hef silken kerchief, 
And that's how her I 
caught. 
They shipped me, etc. 
I 
did a 
bit in Newgate, 
Likewise at old Bridewell; 
Like Claude Duval and his jolly pal, 
Carved my nanie all in the cell. 
On the old treadmill it's all up bill, 
It goes against the grain 
Of Sammy Slap, the clevereSt chap 
From Costermonger Lane.

'TWAS one fine summer's morning, when flowers they were a

And meadows were adorning, and small birds sweetly singing, 
oh, 
I 
met my love near Banbridge Town, my .charming, blooming 
Sally, oh! 
And she is the beauty of County Down, and the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
With admiration I 
did gaze upon this blooming maiden, oh; 
Sure, 4.dam never was more struck when he first saw Eve in 
Eden, oh. 
Her skin was like the lily white that blooms in yonder valley, 
oh, 
And I 
think I 
am blessed when I 
am nigh wit t 
the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
Her yellow hair in ringlets fair, her shoes were Spanish leath-
er, oh; 
Her bonnet with blue ribbons strung, and her scarlet scarf and 
feather, oh. 
Like a 
Venus bright she did appear, did my charming, bloom-
ing Sally, oh; 
She is the girl that I 
love dear, and the Flower of Macheralliea, 
oh. 
An Irish lad although I 
be, has neither wealth nor treasure, oh, 
But still I 
love my dearest dear, I 
love her beyond measure, oh. 
If I 
had all the wealth that is possessed by the great Taeher-
rayle, oh, 
I 
would give it to her that 
love best; she's the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
I 
hope the time will surely come when we'll join hands togeth-

It's then I'll take my darling home, in spite of wind and weath-

And let them all say as they will, and let them all scold and

For it's I 
shall take my darling home, the Flower of Macheral-

And I 
will let you know 
Why I'm saluted by the boys, 
Wherever I 
may go. 
I 
live in eighteen carat style, 
I

trotting mare, 
Smoke Flor-de-Grasshopper cigars, 
And scent my curly hair. 
SPOKEN.—And wherever I 
go, Broadway or any other place, 
you'll near everybody say there goes: 
CHORUS. 
Charley Flynn! Charley Flynn! 
Wears the latest style of collars; 
Charley Flynn! Charley Flynn

And when I'm out to walk, 
My shirt's as white as chalk;

For there comes Charley Flynn I" ' 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on Zephyr stew,

pivot on a

And lance the dancers, too, 
And oftentimes I

Of course on politics; 
And sometimes, when I 
say too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks.

SPOKEN.—I 
will never make another speech as long as I 
live.

THE DONKEY. 
Words and Music by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
AS 
sung with 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
He fought for his country, he's been through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade 
Only for fifty horse-doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc.

MY MARY ANN. 
Words and Music by Tim ROGERS. As sung by him with great 
success, at Harrigan & Hart's, Theatre Comique. 
I'VE got a 
sweet- heart, she looks like a 
queen, 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen, 
She sings " Eilleen Allanna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney" 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy, 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperary, 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy, 
She's never contrary, my own Mary Ann. 
I 
took lovely Mary one night to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to Walhalla I 
Ian ; 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them all, 
But get her to dance, faith I 
Louldn't at all. 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you waltz the next quadrille ? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoe, 
And in two minute's time she had the ball to herself. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, some man sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
He shouted out fire, and she flew straight along. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought she was gone; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for supper, 
She sat down to the table, and done it up brown, 
The fruit that she eat was onions and garlic; 
The perfume from her breath would knock a 
man down. 
You should see Mary, etc.

And she borrowed my gold watch and chain,

Everybody's fast and furious, 
Nothing's like it use to was, 
Seems to me it's mighty curious 
What some folks about me does, 
Whiskey rings and politicians 
Uncle Sam didn't once allow, 
Beat your neighbor and your brothe, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken.—Then they put all their money in a 
savings 
bank and the cashier runs away with it, the bank bursts 
and everything is— 
CHORUS. 
High cum blink cum, skiddy rink cum, 
NiX CUM arous, bow, wow, wow, 
When you get a 
good thing keep it, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Stylish beaux all on the corners, 
At the girls they like to smile, 
Dyed moustache and paper collars, 
Curly hair as slick as " ile," 
Where they get the stamps to back it 
Nobody can tell you how, 
Diamond pins as big as hen's eggs, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken. — Then they meet their girl and have a prome-
nade and go and hear Beecher, and everything is  
Costs a 
heap to dress the ladies, 
Savings banks and coupon bonds, 
High heel boots and chicken feathers, 
Black and tans and pretty blondes, 
Little chaamers all day walking, 
Won't do housework any how, 
Velocipedes to help them toddle, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken. — Then they come racing along the street (
de-
scriptton of race on banjo). 
Now they flew. 
Now they're 
flying. 
Now they ain't, 
Now it's a

There's a 
little Irish lady 
has won from me my heart, 
She's as fair as fair can be, 
An' she's lately came from Ireland, 
Across from the ould dart, 
She's promised she'd wed me, 
Her eyes are blue as heaven's hue, 
She's got the sweetest name, 
0, I 
call her little Rosy, 
Ould Erin's pretty posy, 
She's handsome but not vain. 
Cuouus. 
She's so fair none compare, 
With my little Rosy, 
No, there's not another one 
half so fair to me, 
Pretty pearl, my fresh girl, 
Love and truth combined, 
Won't it be a 
happy day 
When I 
call her mine. 
If you saw this little daisy, 
She'd surely set you crazy, 
You'd say none were so fair 
With her blush of maiden sweetness, 
She's elegance an' neatness, 
A 
jewel rich and rare, 
When all is done and we are one, 
With joy my heart will beat, 
An' a 
home I'll have so cosey, 
With little Irish Rosey, 
The sweetest of the sweet.

The Wedding of Peter Gihnartin. 
Written and composed by W. J. OROGEN. 
A 
knight of the hod, by name Peter Gilmartin, 
Being sick, sore and tired of a single man's life, he 
courted. 
He proposed, she accepted, to be his lawful wife. 
Great preparation for this celebration 
Was begun and completed without much delay. 
They sent invitations to friends and relations 
Requesting their presence on their wedding- day. 
CHORUS. 
There was cow- drills and lanciers for the young turkey 
dancers 
Through the break-downs the old folks were darting; 
They tatthered the floor till their ould feet was sore, 
At the wedding of Peter Gilmartin. 
This select celebration would honor a 
nation 
For grandeur and style there was none could compete. 
In Tammamy Hall there was ne'er such a 
ball 
To equal this wedding in Mulberry street. 
Miss Theodore Lawlor gave her elegant parlors, 
hired McGutnness, the flute, to dishearten, 
While ould Paddy Murray had the fiddle to worry, 
At thewedding of Peter Gilmartin. 
Cuo-nus.—There was cowdrills, etc. 
The supper was grand and beyond competition, 
And served in good style by Mrs. O'Shute ; 
She was passing the oysters to ould Hughey Hardy, 
But lie begged to be excused as he did n't like fruit. 
There was various liquors, both railroad and velvet, 
Which Pat Duff was kept busy carting. 
There was wine for the ladies, root-beer for the daisies, 
At the wedding of Peter Gilmartin. 
CHORUS.—There was cowdrills, etc.

THE IRISH INVITATION. 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS. 
Goon-E\ r;NING, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
call, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning, 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed in 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen, 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen, 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHORUS. 
We will dance (
sym.), and we will sing (sym.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation, 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, we will have a 
keg of ale, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me? 
Then I 
will drive away all care and aggravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have some fun, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
We will dance (sym.), etc.

When we go on parade.

Oh may their colors never fade

To flotht for our homes so dear ; 
We'll he the first men on the field_ 
The _MiteMalion Grenadiers. 
Yes, it marching., etc 
As through the streets we march, 
We break the ladies' hearts ; 
Utr style is of the best 
When we appear ; 
Our fame for solid Irishmen, 
And the love for Ireland 
Will never more be tarnished 
I3v the MacIlahon Grenadiers. 
Yes, a 
marching, etc. 
Sung with the most flattering success by the " Artist Comique," 
HARRY MONTAGUE. 
SOME people you'll find always railing at fate, 
Declaring with many a 
sigh, 
That luck is against them, they cannot get on, 
And so it is useless to try. 
They're hopeful enough, and feel sure of success 
When they find things look all bright and fair, 
But the first little trouble that comes in the way 
They're sure to give up in despair. 
SPOKEN.—Despair! 
Don't have such a 
word in your diction-
ary. 
Make up your minds, as I 
do, to 
CHORUS. 
Go in and win ; yes, go in and win ; 
And don't give it up mind, when once you begin. 
Trouble may meet you, 
And try to defeat you, 
But don't let it beat you; no, go in and win. 
Now plenty you'll find always talking about 
The wonderful things they will do, 
And if talking would do it, there isn't a 
doubt 
That they would astonish afew; 
They're always intending to d something great, 
But not quite sure how to begin, 
And while they are thinking how its to be done, 
Another will go in and win. 
SP0KES.—Yes, there's no use standing still and looking on 
these hard times. 
You must keep up courage, and 
Go in and win, etc. 
I've oft seen a 
fellow in love with a 
girl, 
And would like to make her his wife, 
But he tells you he hardly dare think about that, 
For she's rather above him in life. 
Now if you love the girl, and you think Slie loves you, 
Her station don't matter a 
pin, 
Just make up your mind that you'll have her, my boy, 
And you've only to go in and win. 
SPOKEN.—Faint heart you know never won fair lady, so do 
as I 
have done, 
Go in and win, etc. 
Whatever you start in now make up your mind 
That you'll not be left in the rear. 
Be certain you must keep well up to the fore 
If the prizes of life you would share. 
Fortune, you know, only favors the brave, 
So if with a 
stout heart you begin 
There's no fear I'm sure, but that you'll pull through, 
You've only to go in and win. 
SPOKEN.—That's good advice gratis, and I 
hope you'll follow 
it, and 
Go in and win, eta.

Pm the father of a

Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the beat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
'There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a

They talk about the •Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop. 
You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they zit there in a

They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer; 
Then their conversation 
For a

They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good night, 
And go home from our front stoop.

And made him count the raisins, 
And stamp down all the dough;

To make him look respeetable,

tained from his sole publishers, MESSRS. SPEAR SL

Tins world of ours goes round and round, 
The same thing over again ; 
The sun comes up, and the sun goes down, 
The sajne sun over again; 
And under that sun there is nothing new. 
'Tis said, and so I've found it true, 
This life of ours, ' tween me and you, 
Is the same thing over again. 
'Tis the same thing over again, 
The same thing over again; 
As the world goes round it will surely be found 
The same thing over again. 
Our parents they once were children, you know, 
'Tis the same thing over again; 
What they did once, we do now, 
The same thing over again. 
They loved when shy Cupid his arrow would shoot, 
And of that love we are surely the fruit; 
Now often the old ones we follow suit 
At the same thing over again. 
'Tis the same thing, etc. 
To he all alone with your darling is bliss, 
"Tis the same thing over again; 
When nobody's looking, you steal a 
sly kiss, 
From the same place over again. 
In billing and cooing the time flies away; 
You've said all you know, the same day after day, 
You say, " What shall we do now?" she s.yly will say, 
The same thing over again 1" 
'Tis the same thing, etc. 
We join in a 
glass with some jovial ' brick," 
The same thing over again; 
Our language in time gets remarkably " thick," 
Too much " Same thing over again!" 
How we open the door is not easily smid. 
If wed, we creep into the bed- room in dread, 
And we hear the remark, as we slide into bed, 
"Ah, the same thing over again!" 
'Tis the same thing, etc.

love, and Parasol Flirtations • the correct interpretation of all Eligne1s,

Bead what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mai/ writer-
°A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. roman's, 98 Nas-
sau street called the ' Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the at-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We haee lately seen 
neat litg• 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing :twenty-five cents, called the 
'`Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fiume, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modua operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do net hesitate tO recast-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers." 
alegantly bound in cloth, gilt 
Price 25 Cents.

in Flirtations not contained in the " Lillie Flirt."

knives and forks, napkins, etc., and so arranged as to completely elude 
detection on the part of gossips, scandal mongers. etc. .Price 15 Ceuta. 
Art and Anecdotes of Ventriloquism.--Ventrilo-
quism is an art depending entirely on practice. Any person having 
aequired the correct principles as given by the author of this work— 
Prof. Z. D. Davies whose fame is equally great in Europe and America--
ean become proficient by application. 
It is an art which affords so 
much entertainment in the way of harmless jokes, that all who have 
leisure should not neglect cultivating it

apoleon's Oraculum.—A Verbatim Copy of the Lon-
don edition (originally published at the price of $5.00), which professes

abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in ihe translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. 
The questions being more numerous, and the 
the answers more diversified than any edition ever before published

any mutilated copy can possibly be.

' 
adapted to all conditions of life; and persons of both sexes, whatever 
their situation or capacity, may with confidence refer to its pages to 
derive information, and for the purpose of regulating their future con-

Court : ng. Curds.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
ki meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Wetly young ladies are visiterrby gentlemen who a.ro either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
r 
epulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This Pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of crdistions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conv.:yed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  .
