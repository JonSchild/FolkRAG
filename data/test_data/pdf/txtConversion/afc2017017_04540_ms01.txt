[00:00:29] KS: I'm just going to ask you some things about your job and what you do. Today is 
Monday, February 5th, 2018, and this is Kim Stryker. I'm sitting here with Mizuho Nita who 
works here at the AHS AREC and we're in Stephens City Virginia and the time is just a little 
after 2:00. Tell me a little bit about how did you come to work here? You said you were from 
Japan originally? What brought you to Virginia or to this job? 
 
 
 
[00:01:11] MN: To this job I started off in Japan but my college had a really good exchange 
program at the University in US. And when I did my undergrad in US. 
 
 
 
[00:01:26] KS: Where were you in undergrad?

MN: I want to Southern Illinois university. But my background was not in Horticulture. It was in 
Geography. So I went back, after graduation I went back to Japan. I work a couple years and I 
decided to come back for Master's. So I did Southern Illinois again for the Master's. But the thing 
didn't work out and then I actually decide to change university and went to Ohio State. My focus 
in Geography was more about natural resources, not map-making, but more about how the 
people use natural resources. But when I start taking courses at Ohio State, most of the courses 
I'd already taken when I was in geography. So I was 3 years there and it was not really what I 
wanted. So back at Ohio State University there is a program for undergraduate and graduate 
students to screen what you want and what department can offer. So that where I found Plant 
Pathology, the whole discipline for disease management for plants, including grapes of course. 
So after I [came] to a department I was working in a small group which is in my case, going to 
be strawberries.

[00:02:54] KS: You first specialized in strawberries? 
 
 
 
#phomopsis #disease #grapedisease #wheat #fungicide #fungus 
 
 
 
MN: For my master's. And then I was working a [unintelligible] disease called phomopsis. And 
then I the same single type of fungi phomopsis can also affect grapes too. So for my PhD I just 
start work on the Phomopsis in grapes. That's how I got in. And then after my PhD, I went to 
Penn State and also Kansas State for my postdoc. Where I worked on wheat. And then they tried 
to make a motor to predict when the disease happens so people can spray fungicide hopefully 
before the outbreak. That was my focus on that. [00:03:49] More than with wheat, grapes quite 
different. Especially I think about extinction education. When I working on my actual job I was 
also working for grapes, in a very small group. And this person offered in me in '08, and then I 
applied finally I got here. 
 
 
 
KS: You just started here. 
 
 
 
MN: In '09. 
 
 
 
[00:04:13] KS: Oh in '09. Ok. So you wanted to work in some kind of plant pathology and 
something where you actually were dealing with the people who were using it. 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. From the get-go my focus is try to transfer information from scientific society to 
actual users. Which is what education is all about. But surprisingly the whole discipline is kind 
of, not dissipating, but getting weaker. [laughs.] Everything changes, I guess. I'm still try to focus 
on that aspect and be a very important system for the whole...not just for global but for us as 
researchers too.

[00:05:02] KS: I guess things have changed a lot just because we were such a dominant 
agricultural country like so many people, that was their Number One, that's what they did, they 
were farmers. Up until maybe the 50s even and then a precipitous drop-off when less and less 
people are growing more and more food. 
 
 
 
MN: Part of it because of back in 50s and so on, they were also small growers. And the food 
grows so many different things, but now, only a handful of growers. making a lot of the same 
kind of crops. At the same time, the focus of that would be different now. Grape is a little 
different, but for wheat for example, they really have to focus on the bigger growers. The have 
hundreds of acres. And that’s their clientele. But the difference in grape, especially in Virginia, is 
most of the growers here is less than 5 acres. 
 
 
 
#familybusiness #wine #winemaking #viticulture #fieldwork 
 
 
 
[00:06:06] KS: More of that kind of old model of farming, where it's a small family operation. I 
didn't think of it that way, but that's true. And so that was really interesting for you to be able to 
translate the science for the everyday use of people in these fields. So you said you went to 
grapes because they had a related group of disease to strawberries which you'd been studying. 
Do you have any particular affinity for grapes, or wine, or wine-making? Was it of interest to 
you? 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah. So the whole viticulture is pretty intriguing because it's the most operated or one of 
the production systems where we spend more time than any other crop. So from the actual 
planting to the day of creation, we have a lot of people involved. And also from the time spent in 
the field. A good contract would be wheat production and process grape. Wheat grow they grow 
into Spring or Wintertime, they sow the seed, and then they might fertilize here and there, but 
after that just wait and harvest. 
 
[00:07:24] 
 
 
 
KS: Oh really, ok.

MN: And of course disease come in and that's why talking about disease is important, because 
we have to spray hundreds grapes in one shot. And for that kind of big operation we have to 
spend lots of money just for the chemicals and the spraying. So for that kind of operation we 
really have to have a good reason to spray. But that does tell the [farmer] how little they actually 
spend in the field, and compared with wheat, grapes people are in the field all the time, 
protecting the shoot, pruning, and then also trying to make the best chemicals we can think of, 
and then of course, spraying for the diseases that come in, and then fertilizing and then harvest 
comes, and even after harvest. So they have a lot of manpower and people. 
 
 
 
KS: A lot of touching the plants. [00:08:15] 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah exactly. I'm not even touching wine-making. Lots of involvement. But I think it's very 
intriguing for me. 
 
 
 
#fruit #fruittrees #orchards 
 
 
 
KS: Yeah, I guess I didn't really think of it that way maybe because my experiences with tree 
fruit which also has a lot of hands-on contact, but yeah, that's quite different from the growing 
experiences of a lot of other farmers. In a way it seems sort of like their gluttons for punishment 
too these types of farmers. Because you have to really baby those plants and be with them all the 
time, checking them, doing something. 
 
[00:08:52] 
 
 
 
#oregon #california #westcoast #virginia #wheat #corn 
 
 
 
MN: And then, of course, it will be different based on where you are too. Maybe in Oregon, 
California, where the summer is dryer than we are, disease issue is much less than what we have. 
So for them I wouldn't say, I appreciate it would be less intensive than what we do. Of course 
they spend more time than wheat-growers or corn-growers, but intensity of it would be different. 
 
[00:09:20]

KS: That's really interesting. Because I hadn't thought about it in terms of ...nobody around here 
really grows very much wheat at all, corn some… 
 
 
 
MN: Oregon too. But the acreage is much smaller. 
 
 
 
KS: Much smaller. Even every time the price goes up for corn, then everybody wants to plant 
corn, and then it goes back down again. So your interest is more in the process of viticulture. 
 
[00:09:49] 
 
 
 
#pathogen #plantpathogen #environment 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah. Process of viticulture, as well as my specialty is about managing disease. So my 
focus has been, my master's I tried to understand how the pathogen behaves, so that we can 
actually target our management in the best way possible. Meaning that try to minimize the time 
involved as well as try to minimize the money that's involved and also try to minimize the 
environmental impact that might happen after treatment. In order to do that, I been working 
mostly in my master's and PhD and also in my postdoc all try to basically create a mathematical 
or computer model so that we can actually mimic how they behave. So that we can actually 
simulate what's going on. But right now my current research emphasis was kind of back to basics 
and try to understand some of the pathogens because some of the pathogen I'm working on right 
now is very known that they are causing disease but there are not many people working on it in 
biology whatsoever. So we are in kind of going back to square one, back to the drawing board to 
try to understand how they, for example, make spores, or whether where they're making spores, 
what kind of conditions they require for propagation. 
 
 
 
KS: So getting to know them on a more personal level. [They laugh.] 
[00:11:28] 
 
 
MN: Then, hopefully we can find a weak link. Their lifecycle that we can attack them within.

KS: So is most of your time spent in a lab on computers, or what do you tend to do? 
[00:11:40] 
 
 
MN: I am kind of getting away from my modelling time. So I would say most of the time, 
probably writing grant and then trying to write a paper, but in terms of research, most of the time 
I'm actually teaching students. Not in the classroom, but I have two graduate students who work 
with my project. And then supervising and then how they do their work is most of my work at 
this point. But in terms of split between lab and the field, my lab is more toward fieldwork than 
lab. Of course we have a quite fairly big component of the lab, but our lab being in this research 
station is that we have a land that's actually attached to this facility that we can use for 
experiment. Then it kinda, many of the science fields, they, nowadays they focus too much on 
the genes and the proteins and all of this stuff. But not many people actually in the field and 
testing out. I think one of my goal is to actually test out in the field and see how it goes.

KS: I mean it's great. And since this is the area where the people are affected, you have some 
many wineries within very close distance to you so it's nice to be able to work here. Had you 
spent any time in Virginia before you came to this position? [00:13:14] 
 
 
 
MN: No. 
 
 
 
KS: And so do you live close by? [00:13:18]

KS: So what is it like to have come here, I mean you've hopped around, you've seen a good 
amount of different places in America through your time here. What did you, when did you 
graduate from undergraduate degree? 
 
[00:13:40] 
 
 
 
#ohiostate #kansasstate #pennstate #wheat 
 
 
 
MN: Undergraduate was 1995, I think. Or 4. And then I work in Japan for couple years, and then 
came back in 98 for my masters. And then I skipped one year basically, and I went to Ohio State 
in 99, and then in my I did my Master's started in 99 too. I did some coursework started. And 
then graduate from Ohio State in 2005, and then when to Penn State from 06/07 and then Kansas 
State in 07/08. [00:14:30] Penn State is not far from here, it's about 2 and a half hour from here, 
it's not that far. But Kansas is quite… 
 
 
 
KS: And very different. And wheat. [00:14:45] 
 
 
 
MN: And Penn State, work was on wheat too. 
 
 
 
KS: Oh really? I know people talking about trying to, more as an experiment, trying to grow 
some wheats in Virginia again. [00:14:59] 
 
 
 
MN: Fairly good production, too. But like I said, relatively speaking, the acre is much lower than 
the typical wheat-growing area.

KS: Coming to Virginia, what is it about Virginia? As you mentioned before, because the 
climate is more humid, and things like that than the primary growing areas, which are the west 
coast. What are some of the unique challenges that you find in Virginia for your work in 
particular?[00:15:30] 
 
 
 
MN: Basically, moisture. Is a challenge. The pathogens we are dealing with is very similar to the 
mold that grow in your bathroom or the mold that grow on the strawberry and fruit. Actually the 
gray mold on the strawberries is actually the same pathogen as the gray mold on the grapes. So 
they have similarity too. So the summertime rain that we often experience is a challenge. 
Because that will drive some of the major diseases as early as a day. That's where I come in and 
try to find out the best way to manage that. So since I'm working on a chemical, I talk about 
chemical quite a bit. But at the same time one of the reasons why I came here was we have a 
good viticulture program. By Tony Wolf. [00:16:29] And then having a viticulturist on the board 
is great because I get viticulture practice, which is basically how you grow. It's really important 
in terms of disease management too. Because disease prefer moist, humid and dark environment 
most of the time. So if you can avoid that by having a proper canopy. Then your risk is much 
lower. 
 
 
 
KS: So Tony was talking about that a bit, about how you in Virginia in particular you have more 
to deal with canopy management because the weather that we have spurs a lot the greenery to 
grow. [He agrees.] Where, if it was somewhere dryer, you would have less leaf cover and then 
under those leaves you get things that affect the fruit development. Too much moisture, too 
much shade. And not good air flow. 
 
[00:17:27] 
 
 
 
MN: Having a good air flow is a key component. 
 
 
 
KS: Are there peculiar things here, you said that the gray mold from strawberries is the same. Do 
we have anything really peculiar that you see here in Virginia that maybe doesn't show up in 
other places?

#disease #plantdisease #plantpathology #canopy #trunk 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah, so, we do have our own issues. For example, Tony might have mentioned the 
grapevine yellows? It's a type of plasma it's very similar to mycoplasma that cause the lung 
infection for humans. It's a really similar to bacteria, but they don't have a coating outside of it. 
 
 
 
KS: And that's called grapevine yellows? Like the color? [00:18:15] 
 
 
 
#grape #insects 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah. So it does discourage the grape leads to yellows and the stunted growth. And it is 
transmitted by insects. Then the combination of insect and this particular protoplasm has to be 
unique because they have to know each other. [He laughs.] They have the same kind of issues in 
France. But it looks like the research is showing that they are a bit different from each other. But 
it's a little more unique in this particular occasion. And then it's not just in here, but also other 
thing that is more common in here is a disease called crown gall. Which is basically gall formed 
on the base of the... 
 
[00:19:04] 
 
 
 
KS: [Checks spelling.] Crown gall. And that develops on the canopy? 
 
 
 
#weather #virginia #temperature 
 
 
 
MN: No, on the trunk of the vine. And then the disease, we are still doing research on it, but my 
understanding is this particular bacteria cannot penetrate itself in the grape by itself. So it does 
need room to go in. And then in this area, the temperature fluctuations in the winter and the 
springtime can cause the grape trunk to be split open. It could be superficial, it could be really 
Winery Workers in Virginia

bad, depending on the year and what kind of conditions we got. But nonetheless that the room 
caused by this temperature fluctuation is the reason why this disease…

#chemicals #pesticides #fungicides #antibiotics #cost #antibioticresistance #vectors 
#grapevineyellows #insects #bugs #mycoplasma 
 
 
 
KS: They can get in when a crack forms and cause trouble. And these are all thing that can be 
treated with chemical pesticides, or fungicides? 
 
 
 
MN: Yes and no. Technically, we can probably inject antibiotics into the grapes. Technically, but 
normally we won't do it because it might be expensive. Because we have to inject every single 
one of them. [They laugh.] And then also, as with humans, we have an issue of resistance. And 
we do not want to use antibiotics for this kind of purpose. So chemically yes it can be done, but 
it's not practical or feasible. So Grapevine yellows, not me, but Tony's group is working on to try 
to identify the vectors So hopefully we can manage the vectors at least will be minimized for the 
grapevine yellows. 
 
[00:20:48] 
 
 
 
KS: Can you define vectors? 
 
 
 
MN: Vector is basically insect that can transmit the in this case mycoplasma. 
 
 
 
#zikavirus #zika #mosquito #vector 
 
 
 
KS: So it's too cumbersome, expensive and troublesome to do the antibiotic, but if you can 
intercept it before by catching the insects that carry it. Well that makes sense. Sort of like when 
they spray for, what did we have in the south recently, the mosquitoes that were causing pregnant 
women to have… Zika.

#Japan #virginiatech #gradstudents #research #pitt #universityofpittsburgh #fieldwork 
 
 
 
MN: In case of crown gall, what we are working on is so-called bio [unintelligible] which is 
basically, in this particular case, a very similar organism, it's actually in the same species but for 
some reason it lacks the ability to cause disease. But if we apply at the same time this particular 
strain can make the bad one behave ok. So it basically reduces the number of gall formation, and 
also gall will be reduced. This is a joint project release in Japan where they found this particular 
strain. 
 
[00:22:13] 
 
 
 
KS: Oh OK. So that's interesting, you get to continue to have a connection with the research 
community back in Japan as well. So your students that you are working with, the grad students, 
they are from? Virginia Tech? Or are they from different programs? 
 
 
 
MN: One of them from Virginia Tech and the other one is from the University of Pittsburgh. But 
his family is actually growing in Virginia.

KS: Oh, so he has a family reason for getting interested in it. That's good. We were talking about 
that you spend a lot more time in the field. So do you ever find, just out of curiosity, because you 
are Japanese, and you are in communities with rural Virginia, when you go out to visit the farms, 
are they why are you here? Where did you come from? [He laughs.] 
 
[00:23:11] 
 
 
 
MN: That's a very good question. It doesn't happen very often. Especially the people who are 
growing grapes in this area, they came from really wide background. Majority of them still have 
their daytime job, their main job. And then, it's not very common to see generations of grape- 
growers in this particular region, so most of them are new to it, and they are more open to so 
many different things. Well most of the people who make lots of money tend to start a winery 
and then own the business too, here they're doctors, and lawyers. They prefer to see the facts and 
then they are not really… 
 
 
 
KS: They're more impressed by your knowledge and background [00:24:06] 
 
 
 
MN: What we're doing. They don't care too much about my nationality, my skin color. 
 
 
 
#viticulture #virginia #extensionprograms #virginiatech #winemakers 
 
 
 
[00:24:12] 
 
 
 
KS: Because that can be probably be an issue in some parts, in some communities, in rural 
communities. Do you think in some ways it's easier or more beneficial because of the type of 
people that are in viticulture in Virginia that they are accomplished in other aspects of their 
lives? Well-educated but they respond well to what the extension programs tell them? 
 
[00:24:45] 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

MN: It's probably part of it. I won’t say that the main reason, I think it's at least a part of it And I 
think it's a little more easier for them because they know how to run a business, and they know 
how to get information. That's really important. For them, they know that our extension service 
can provide the dedication they need, so they really appreciate. And they know the value of it.

#organic #organicfarming #organicfarmers #chemicals #pesticides #herbicides #fungicides 
 
 
 
KS: I know in some agricultural communities, it can be a fight…organic farmers don't tend to get 
along well with extension agents, because they consider them to be too with the chemical 
companies. 
 
 
 
#moisture #aeration #paperbag #disease #light #sunlight #anthocyanin #red #redwine 
#pigmentation #whitewine #whitegrapes #sugar #flavor 
 
 
MN: That could happen, too, but luckily organic growers are truly patient, I guess. Both what we 
do and then they understand what I can do, too. So we actually have a joint project right now, 
with organic growers who ask me to fix a few things and then it's truly non-chemical way of 
taking on this disease. We basically have a food bag, a paper bag covered on the fruit, and then 
as I mentioned if they don't get moisture, they don't get disease growing. If the bag aerates that 
can technically this reduce the disease risk quite a bit. But there are other potential issues for if 
you block the solar radiation on the red fruit cultivars, anthocyanin production, pigmentation will 
be much lower, so it may not be the best way to do it with red fruit. But the white it seems to be 
working. But of course we are just testing disease-management part of it, but we're not testing 
wine-making part of it. But still, it's a good start. 
 
[00:26:50] 
 
 
 
KS: There are issues with color, with sugar concentrations. 
 
 
 
MN: Even microbiological interaction because they are not being outside. So that might actually 
affect the flavor of it. So that's something we don't know. [00:27:13]

#Virginia #organic 
 
 
 
KS: And it's nice to hear that there's organic growers who are willing to put in the time and 
energy and money to see if it will work. Everything that I've heard from people I've talked to so 
far is they're like, you can't do organic in Virginia, or at least it's very expensive in general. 
[00:27:30] 
 
 
 
MN: I think it's partially true. It's really difficult. I was talking about how much time you have to 
spend in the field. We probably have to double or triple the time we have to spend in the field. 
And you have to take the risk. That's not going to happen with everybody. So I really admire and 
respect our organic growers because they are the ones actually putting lots of time and then 
trying so many different things. Without their input, I cannot really work with them. So it's 
important. [00:28:06] 
 
 
 
KS: The acres that they have here, you have how much under vines? 
 
 
 
#tonywolf #virginiatech #weedmanagement #diseasemanagement #conventionalfarming 
#organicfarming #certifiedorganic 
 
 
 
MN: Total 3 acres. And then Tony probably has half of it. So mine's about an acre, or a little bit 
more than acre. And then I have 4 sections. 1 section is organic section. Which is not truly 
organic--Tony calls "pseudo-organic" [KS laughs] and I agree with him. Simply because, with 
organic production, they have two issues: one is disease-management, and that's my specialty, 
and other one is weed management. That is very difficult. And I'm not a specialist in weed 
management, so I decide to use chemical for that. So that's why it's not truly organic. And then 
also I have to compare with conventional approach as well, so even though that field is set up for 
organic production, I have to have a treatment with conventional chemical. So it's not certified 
organic, but the aim of it is to try to… 
 
 
 
KS: Get a similar situation going. [00:29:18] So the conventional method is sort of like 
your...what do you call it in science, when you sample your reference point?

#spray #spraying #copper #sulfur #environment #pesticides 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. As a positive control. So we put a program that's supposed to work. Also having 
that particular field make me having flexibility of testing the same… Another thing I should 
mention here is that the organic production doesn't mean you don't spray. They do actually spray 
quite a bit. What the spray is basically copper and sulfur. Which is not really good for the 
environment, either. Nowadays we are lucky, we have a lot of new copper formulations that they 
can use, but unfortunately, some of those produce [syntypically ] which means they cannot really 
be used for organic production. Even though the actual material is organic, but the [?] they 
produce prohibits them to be using…disqualified for production.

MN: The program, especially in this environment, I'm pretty sure it would be different in 
Oregon, Washington, California, but under our environmental conditions you really have to 
spray quite a bit for organic production. Or you could select the cultivars that are not susceptible 
to disease. And that we promote as well. But the problem is that if you go to the winery and you 
couldn't find a Chardonnay when are all Cabernet Sauvignon, some people are not really 
interested in beyond that. Having a hybrid cultivar on the bottle may or may not be very good for 
the marketing point of view. 
 
[00:31:11] 
 
 
 
KS: We talked about that a little bit too, how site location is important, but if you're also in the 
middle of nowhere, and no one can get to you, because everybody tends to sell their product 
right on site, you might have to pick a less good site so that you have better foot traffic.

MN: Exactly and then also you have to pick the cultivar that doesn't fit in this area, that sells 
well. The Chardonnay is a very prime example for that. 
 
 
 
KS: Chardonnay seems to be the most popular but doesn't grow super great. 
 
 
 
MN: It is winter-hardy, meaning it doesn't crack open in the wintertime, it's really good [????] 
But at the same time we tend to [?????] earlier so they have a higher risk of late frost issues. 
Also, in terms of disease, it can get everything you can think of. That's where I was going. I have 
an organic plot, and other field is for my disease testing plot, and that consists of Chardonnay 
and also Cabernet Sauvignon. 
 
[00:32:26] 
 
 
 
KS: They're not going anywhere. Everyone's gonna keep growing them no matter what.

MN: At the same they can get diseases quite a bit. Powdery mildew, downy mildew, Botrytus, 
Gray Mold, and then Phomopsis I was talking about, and then also black rot. 
 
 
 
KS: Black rot is the one everyone is terrified of, right? Is that the biggest, baddest one? 
[00:32:46] 
 
 
 
MN: Yes and no. So if you're doing organic production then that one is the biggest and baddest. 
Simply because the copper doesn't do much against black rot. But if you're doing conventional, 
we have a series of good products against black rot. So for conventional growers, it's not a major 
issue. I will say for convention people, the powdery and downy mildew. Depends on where you 
are, what kind of cultivars you have growing.

[00:33:16] 
 
 
 
KS: OK. And then I know for, what is the one they call, is it rust?

KS: There's another thing called, oh, Fire Blight? 
 
 
 
#bacteria #vector #bees #insects #pollen 
 
 
 
MN: Oh, yeah, right, fire blight is on apples and pears. It is caused by bacteria. And then it the 
vector in this case is the bees and then other insects that visit the flowers, and they… 
 
[00:33:58] 
 
 
 
KS: Put it in the pollen. [MN agrees.] So but you don't find crossover into problems with grapes?

MN: There are some crossovers. For example, Bitter rot, in apples, is caused by the same group 
of organism that cause ripe rot in grapes. [00:34:14] So that could be a potential issue. And we 
see some evidence of it because ripe rot hasn't hit from the start of industry. I can find the 
documentation from 1880 something, they are talking about ripe rot. But it was not big issue 
until now. Last 10 years or so. I think one of the reasons is because changes in the climate 
getting warmer in the winter. Hotter in the summer, and then this particular pathogen likes hot 
weather. So they tend to thrive more in the warmer temperature, and getting more popular even 
in this area. usually only southern parts or Virginia and North Carolina is an issue, but now … 
 
 
 
KS: It's moving up. And that's ripe rot [MN agrees.] So when the grape is full is when it causes 
the damage? [00:35:05] 
 
 
 
MN: We are doing research on it. But it looks like an actual infection happens much earlier. So 
they can infect [vines] but it doesn’t cause symptoms till fruit is ripe. It make it really difficult to 
manage. 
 
[00:35:21] 
 
 
 
KS: You think everything’s fine, and when you go to get your grapes, something's bad. What 
actually happens to the grape with ripe rot? 
 
 
 
#whitegrapes #redgrapes #flavor 
 
 
 
MN: In this case, it mainly causes rot. And then with white cultivars it will show as a brown 
discoloration, and then the discoloration increase as time goes by, and they actually make them 
like a raisin, so the skin is still intact, but very soft and gooey. And then unfortunately this 
particular pathogen either produces some chemical by itself or it interacts with the grapes and 
make it changes the flavor of the wine as well. It's one the few pathogens that actually can 
change the flavor of the wine. 
 
[00:36:06]

#harvest #vineyard #middleburg #virginia #flavor #graymold #riperot 
 
 
 
KS: Well, I was harvesting this fall at one of the vineyards in Middleburg, Virginia, and every 
once in a while, I'd come up on a grape that looks like a raisin and he says, fine, just throw it in, 
it'll make it, it has more flavor, so I guess in those cases, a little bit of a benefit. 
 
[00:36:34] 
 
 
 
MN: It depends on what kind of pathogen went into it. So if you have a little bit of a gray mold 
issue, if it's not widespread, and a little bit over here and there, it probably doesn't cause much 
issues. Some people prefer it because they say it actually concentrate the flavor. And in the case 
of ripe rot, it depends on who you talk to. To me, when the ripe rot is there, the wine will lose its 
freshness. It tastes good, looks red, and then looks like a wine, but it doesn't have the same 
flavor. But some people kinda like that way. So it’s really debatable, but still. I think our industry 
at this stage is looking for something we can actually produce and preferred by so many different 
people. And the will not want to have extra factors…

Do you drink Virginia wine? 
 
 
MN: Yeah, I do actually quite a bit. [MN laughs.] And each time I go to the winery, I try to pick 
to a bottle or two. One of the reasons is that I really want to know the fruit of the product and 
then the flavor influence but unless I know what it tastes like and how they produce it, and then

what kind of effort they put into, it's very difficult for me to come up with a spray plan but if I 
don't know what happens afterward, to me, it doesn't make much sense. 
 
[00:38:06] 
 
 
 
KS: It kind of gives you the fuller picture. 
 
 
 
#chambourcin #yield #grapeyield #disease #hybrid #virginia #virginiawine #redwine 
 
 
 
MN: And then that will of course also help me understand what kind of grapes are preferred by 
winemakers and customers, too. One example is the cultivar for Chambourcin, which is a hybrid 
cultivar. It doesn't get much diseases and then it crops a lot, it does yield a lot of grapes. 
 
[00:38:30] 
 
 
 
KS: [KS checks spelling.] So this one is a good yield? 
 
 
 
MN: Good yield, and disease-resistant in most cases. Before I came to Virginia, I never 
recommended to anybody, even though I knew it. Because the wine was OK. It was never good. 
But now it looks like it's not about grapes but winemaking technique, so nowadays people 
actually seek out a how to make a good wine out of it. I start seeing really good Chambourcin 
wine here in especially in Virginia, actually, because to some extent they have to rely on this 
kind of hybrid because traditional French cultivars, they cannot expect to have the same level of 
yield year after year. Sometimes due to disease, sometimes due to winter [die off]. So you have 
to have some cultivar that's a staple for this reason. 
 
[00:39:37] 
 
 
 
KS: And so maybe build a blend off of that. 
 
 
 
MN: They do that. And they also use a varietal in some cases.

KS: I remember hearing early on from someone about a friend of mine that is a Sommelier, and 
they were talking about Virginia Wine and how they had bought European rootstock here and 
then it would fail. Like Thomas Jefferson and all these people would try, and it just didn't do 
well with it. And then it was actually because of maybe some of the work in Virginia that they 
were able to help in Europe when they got a disease, and they were able to bring American 
rootstock ver there that didn't succumb to the same... 
 
 
 
#phylloxera #insect #treelouse #root #americangrapes 
 
 
 
MN: The issue is [?] also Europe now--we export it. But it's an insect. It's a tree-louse called 
phylloxera. And that actually goes into the root, and if the root is susceptible to that at feeding it 
eventually dies. But American grapes are more resistant to the feeding from the phylloxera. 
[00:40:56] 
 
 
 
[They check spelling.] 
 
 
 
[00:41:28]

then…

MN: My appointment is 50 percent research, and 50 percent extension. So extension is basically 
education for growers and other stakeholders. So I do spend quite a bit of time extension. In my 
case, yes, I do face-to-face meetings. We have a growers' meeting where we're talking about 
areas of the VVA--Virginia Vineyards Association--meeting, which happens twice a year, and 
then I do my presentation down there as well. Also, the Virginia Cooperative Extension has a 
program each year that consists of a meeting in a vineyard, where the growers get together and 
then we exchange information. And also we have in the springtime or in the wintertime me and 
Tremain Hatch coordinate called IPM workshop, which is Integrated Pest Management 
workshop, where we invite viticulturists like Tony Wolf or entomologists and myself and 
Tremain Hatch and also sometimes we invite people from [Name of Org. VECA?] for the worker 
protection standard and other things involved in the wine, grape production.

MN: And then what we cover is basically how to plan for a season. So each person will go 
around and talk about hot topics like new pests coming in, or research updates or seasonal 
updates. Then typically we have it about four hours long. The first 2 hours are just lecturing. The 
other 2 hours are basically going through the season with everybody in the room. So we have a 
think break and then we go fill in the template based on how the grapes grow, and then what kind 
of disease will happen in particular time of the season, and then how you deal with that diseases. 
 
[00:44:31] 
 
 
 
KS: So you go around with the growers and talk about, in their specific instance, like… 
 
 
 
#flowers #trunks #rain #rainfall #chemical #chemicalfungicide #fungicide #resistance #pathogen 
#plantpathogen 
 
 
 
MN: No we try to come up with a template for everybody. But of course I told them for each 
table you can come up with your own. But we just try to come up with a kind of random sample 
of other people's plan, and then try to critique what's going on. So there are two things we have 
to deal with. So one is disease doesn't happen randomly. So we have to know when it happens. 
That can be depending on the growth stage of the grapes. Some diseases prefer flowers, some 
disease prefer other types of tissues. Of course temperature and how much rain we got is 
important. Also, at any given time, we probably have to deal with more than one disease. SO we 
have to plan for that. And then even if we use chemical, a conventional chemical, we cannot use 
the same material again and again. Because the problem is we may develop the fungicide 
resistance because we used the same we call "mode of action" or the same chemical pathway to 
attack the pathogen again and again, then they can figure out how to overcome that. So we have 
to make sure we don't use the same mode of action so many times in a season.

Winery Workers in Virginia

"those blankety-blanks! Why are they pulling that, because that's the only thing that works." Big 
picture. 
 
 
 
#toxicity #chemicals 
 
 
 
MN: Big picture. Oftentimes that kind of thing happens. Sometimes they may find toxicity. 
Could be human toxicity or could be environmental toxicity. Or even grapes. Some chemicals, it 
really depends on the crop, and what kind of chemical [?] they have. Sometimes they might stick 
too well, and it might end up in the wine. And then of course in a chemical company, and then 
also we are cooperating too. So we do a series of research before their introduction to the market. 
But sometimes we find things afterward. 
 
[00:46:57] 
 
 
 
KS: Other things in practice come out. 
 
 
 
#gene #genes #genetics 
 
 
 
MN: That is probably the main reason they came to prove certain products. Or some of the older 
chemicals they tend to be more effective. But at the same time, they can be more toxic. So 
sometimes they have to take it out due to health concerns. But at the same time, as I mentioned, 
the newer product is actually much safer. And we use much less in quantity. The older material 
we have to, per acre, we have to spray per pound. Nowadays, new product, we spray by ounce. 
So that's a big difference, how effective they are. But at the same time, these newer designed 
chemicals are targeting specific genes or specific function of the organism. 
 
[00:47:57] 
 
 
 
KS: It's not just trying to wipe it out. 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. That's why it's so safe. But at the same time, because it's so narrow in terms of how 
it works, the pathogen can overcome it more easily. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
24
 
 
KS: So maybe it's targeting how it reproduces, or something like that. There was some pest- 
control thing they were talking out, where basically it was something that would disrupt the 
reproductive process. 
 
 
#fungicide #pathogen #cellwalls #spores #sporegermination 
 
 
 
MN: In the fungicide we are dealing with, oftentimes we are targeting for example how their cell 
wall is [?]. So they block certain pathways to make cell walls really good. So once that is in 
place, then they cannot produce good cell walls. Sometimes they inhibit…the spore 
germination... Spore has to germinate and get infection. Sometimes they interfere with 
mechanisms how they grow. 
 
[00:49:05] 
 
 
 
KS: So it just never gets to the point. Which is quite different from the old way of doing things. 
 
 
 
MN: Old way, some of them have same property, but they have more ways of attacking it. That's 
why it works so well. But at the same time, the same kind of attacking mode might work on us or 
other organisms too. 
 
 
KS: We look crazy or have an extra arm or something. Yeah we don't want that. So you do 50% 
research, 50% extension, and then do you also have family here? 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah I do. I have family here. 
 
 
 
KS: And your children are grown? They go to school around here? [MN agrees.] Any interest in 
following their father's footsteps maybe one day?

KS: She's not switching bugs in the garden!? [They laugh.] So you have that role as well. You 
said you go out to vineyards, and you like to see the work and to taste it. What else is it about 
Virginia wine that's different or unusual or unique. 
 
 
 
MN: Different in terms of I believe...I'm going back to my original statement of how much time 
they spend. It's definitely not a mass-production type of operation. Some growers do, but even 
for them, they have to spend way more resources to produce a bottle of wine compared with 
other places. That's why many of the Virginia wines start from 15-20 dollars. We cannot simply 
sell by $3.99. 
 
[00:50:54] 
 
 
 
KS: No. There's not an efficiency of scale going on. [They laugh.] More vines would just mean 
more work. 
 
 
 
#climate #environment #sommelier #drinkingwine #varieties #winevarieties #vineyard 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. So that's at least one of the characteristics. Of course, they have to fight for the 
environment to produce good wine. Then they I think local growers they do study and then spend 
lots of time trying to understand what's going on. And I think makes our industry really strong. 
In terms of wine… I like wine, but I'm not a sommelier or anything like that. I think even though 
our industry has been evolving for the last 20 years or so, I think we are still trying to find the 
best Virginia wine here. They can produce nice wine, no doubt, but...In Virginia having an ocean 
to the mountain, it's more likely very difficult for anybody to find one style. That's probably not 
going to happen. Each vineyard, or each location, is probably going to have some trend or 
signature some type of wine, or variety that they can grow very well.

KS: It's not going to be like, there's too much variation between vineyards to have it be like, "oh 
it's a Sonoma wine," or it's a Pacific Coast wine, or something like that where you can 
supposedly taste the sea breeze or something in the wine. 
 
 
MN: I think the other advantage, too, is people can taste so many different styles of wine in a 
very small geographical region.

#makers #growers #sharingknowledge #community 
 
 
 
KS: I think it is. One of the things that keeps coming up in my interviews particularly with wine- 
makers and growers, that they like it because it's sort of the Wild West of wine. It's a lot of 
innovation. There's a lot of trial and error, and people are very good about sharing with each 
other, this worked for me, maybe it will work for you. 
 
 
 
MN: I agree too. One other thing I noticed right away, especially good growers, they are not 
afraid of sharing their information. That makes a lot of things easy. Because in this area, 
especially... you will make a mistake, no matter how smart you are. Having somebody show you 
an example, especially a seasoned grower who has been in Virginia for 15-20 years, willing to 
share their mistakes with grapes.

he grows his grapes and how he makes his wine. I wish I could be like him, but I know how 
difficult it is. 
 
 
 
KS: I kept hearing his name when I talked to people, and I thought, who is this guy, I have to go 
talk to him, and I did. I sat and interviewed with him. But because so many people give him 
props for helping them for mentoring for just being someone to bounce ideas off of. So I think 
that's been really interesting. i think it was part of what I'm getting at, is what makes Virginia 
quite unique. In the old country, in Europe, people are very proprietary about "don't try to make 
wine next to me, don't steal my whatever." What about in Japan? Do you know of people trying 
to make wine in Japan?

#matsumotojapan #matsumoto #tablegrapes #climate #weather #rainfall #temperature 
 
 
 
MN: I'm from Japan, I was not in the Japanese school system after high school. So I didn't have a 
really good tie to Japanese researchers until 4 or 5 years ago. I get to meet a few people in 
meetings and then we started getting cooperation going. Then I just had a symposium in japan a 
couple weeks ago. Because environment in Japan, especially in the mountain area of Japan 
where the grapes are grown, is very similar to environment condition in here in Virginia. So I 
made a slide where we have the precipitation temperature fluctuation monthly one side in 
Matsumoto, Japan, which was the place where the symposium was, and then when you look at 
Virginia here, it almost lined up. Only difference was we get a little bit warmer faster than they 
do. We are about two weeks ahead of their schedule in terms of growth. But the precipitation 
around here is about 970-80 mm around here. But that particular city in Japan was about 1,000 
mm per year. So it's only a 20 mm difference. And the temperature highs and lows are almost 
identical.

Winery Workers in Virginia

MN: Yeah, so, what we are trying to collaborate on is the Japanese wine industry is right now is 
relying on table grapes. Because table grapes are really profitable in Japan. It's really different 
situation, so a box of a nice table grapes can sell for 10-100 dollars. So they can make lots of 
money just doing table grapes. But wine you cannot sell for 100 dollars. The profit margin is 
much less. But at the same time, they never tried Pinot and Chardonnay, or Merlot, which is not 
really suitable in their environment either. So that's where we try to collaborate. For them, try to 
establish what they can grow, [?] is very important. And also they try to understand what kind of 
disease they have. They know what's going on, but at the same time they don't know exactly 
what kind of disease they’re living with in the wine. So that's we try to find out.

funny what you said about table grapes being so expensive. I noticed the same thing when I was 
working with pick-your-own orchards and the white peaches, especially Korean customers, they 
were so crazy for white peaches, and then I started to research, in Korea, they sell, each piece is 
like this big, and they sell them for so much money. So when the people from Korea come, and 
they see all these trees, they were [KS laughs.] It's such a different perspective on it. All the 
farmers said, we're not rich, trust me. It's a different thing. Is there anything that you see going 
forward with your work, what you would like to see doing, with your work? What does the 
future hold?

#temperaturefluctuation #vine 
 
 
 
MN: Of course we are dealing with emerging diseases all the time. Because mostly for the 
pathology, not because we have new pests coming in, but because environment changes. Ripe rot 
is a prime example. Back in the early part of the previous century, it was there, but it was never a 
big issue. But now it's a bigger issue than before because of the warmer temperatures. And then 
the same goes for a couple different late season crop issues that I'll probably focus on a little bit 
more. And then the crown gall I was talking about, one of the other things that I want to focus on 
more, simply because ...Again, it's environmentally driven. So we have more years with warmer 
winters. If it's warm, and it keeps warm, that's fine. But the problem is, the fluctuation of 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

temperature. And that actually promotes the cracking or the damage on the vine. I think that's 
why we saw more crown gall in the last couple years.

trees, and it was really bad for the nectarines and peaches and plums as well. Which we don't 
have a ton of plums around here. 
 
 
MN: That's one of the reasons why we cannot grow more nice apricots because we have that 
fluctuation. 
 
 
 
KS: So they had the trunks were all cracking. 
 
 
 
MN: Yeah, it could, because. When they basically come up for winter. So their…the liquid gets

#sap #freeze #cracks #vascularsystem #trunkdisease #fungus #tonywolf #viticulture

than liquid water, and it cracks. Cracks the vascular system. So it's not really good. But I think I 
have a feeling that that associated with that kind of condition will be more of a condition in the 
future. Not only crown gall, but other vascular or trunk disease can be caused by fungal species. 
It could be a potential issue for us. In terms of where the actual work goes, me and Tony have

been talking about it. I think that we should have more cooperation between viticulture and the 
plant pathology.

MN: Because we know the principles, but it's time for us to get together and actually get some 
data together that we are talking quite a lot about. Same goes with entomology, too. I mention 
the vectors, but I'm not a bug person. So I can do basic research, and basic meaning the very 
simple research. But we need more help from a collaborator. How to make sense of what's going 
on. In terms of extension, I intentionally spend more time on the web. I have 4 or 5 different 
websites. Some of them are based on a project. One, we have a trunk disease specific project 
page. And then, also, my blog, I put similar information to those. And then also we have website 
for more generic purposes. And then also extension the Facebook and twitter and that stuff going 
on too. [01:02:17] 
 
 
 
KS: Just updates on new things that are coming out, or problems that we're seeing or something 
like that? [MN agrees.] So just keeping up with all of that. 
 
 
 
MN: And then, try to find what the best means of dissemination is is always a challenge. 
 
 
 
KS: And it keeps changing too with all the different technologies and social media and stuff. 
What people used to use, and now they use something totally different. 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. 
 
 
 
KS: New people coming up don't use the same thing that the older people use.

#twitter #facebook #tweet #blogs #copyright #copyrightlaw 
 
 
 
MN: I was going to Facebook, but then I realized that in my case, grape growers are ok with 
blogs. But they come and especially nowadays blogs have the function to tweet and send an 
email too. That helps. But when I talk to my colleagues, it depends on the copyright rules. Some 
people have to use twitter. That is the way to go. They will not take anything but twitter. They 
focus on that. So they depend on their clientele.

#folklore #international 
 
 
 
MN: It definitely does seem true, I know, people may have an account but they never look at it 
for different mediums for different things. For me, in my community, for folklorists, twitter is 
really important. Mostly for the international community. Where FB is for in the US, but if I 
want to reach other folklorists in other countries, I had to be on twitter. It's interesting. It's 
supposed to make everything easier, but it complicates everything. Anything you wanted to add 
for maybe what people don't understand about the work? 
 
 
 
#canopy #site #variety #chemicals #disease #viticulture 
 
 
 
MN: Well, I think I covered what typically people don't understand. Our research is mainly 
trying to understand biology of what's going on. And then of course you know I also mentioned 
about chemicals simply because that's one of the approaches we use but it's not the only 
approach, and I oftentimes mention to our grape growers that you have to select a good variety 
for this site. And then do your job, your homework to get a good canopy. It's only then that the 
chemical actually works. And we do have good data on that too. If you spray into the canopy, 
where the canopy might if not done properly, no matter how much you spray, it doesn't matter. 
Because environmental condition is so great, and then the spray cover is not going to be so good, 
so the diseases happen anyway. So as I mentioned its foundation is actually the viticulture and 
how to grow it. And then our work with is the icing on the whole cake. Without the icing, we 
cannot produce any cake.

KS: So it's all, as the term, Integrated Pest Management, it really is that idea, it's not just you're 
going to buy something off the shelf, and you're going to be able to fix everything. It's got to be a 
more holistic. 
 
 
#frenchgrapes #frenchcultivars #climate #virginia 
 
 
 
MN: Holistic is the only way we can go especially in this area. Because the environmental 
conditions are so challenging for growing grapes. Especially for wine grapes. Especially if you 
want to grow French cultivars that sells very well. 
 
[01:05:52] 
 
 
 
KS: So is everyone crazy for getting into wine? 
 
 
 
#tonywolf #workshop 
 
 
 
MN: Yes. I don't know if Tony mentioned to you, but we also have a beginner's workshop at 
least twice a year. We don't want to hide what's going on. We tell them from the get-go how 
much it will take to do it, and how much environment you have to make, and then how long does 
it take for you to actually get money. And then, end of the day I come in and talk about all the 
diseases you could have. Even with that, some people, still want to do it! [They laugh.] They 
come in knowing what's going on. So I really appreciate what they can do. 
 
[01:06:35] 
 
 
 
KS: So even though you try to scare them off, they still decide they're going to do it There's a lot 
of things like that. We have stubborn people here too, in Virginia.

MN: Sometimes Virginia the people who can actually come up with solutions. If they're not 
trying... 
 
 
 
KS: This is not the place to be a lazy grape-grower. 
 
 
 
MN: Exactly. You really have to work hard to get harvest. 
[01:07:06] 
 
 
#farming #trees #vines #orchards #vineyards #dairyfarm #wheatfarms 
 
 
 
KS: I think it's that’s one of the things I never thought about when you look at the different types 
of farming. A lot of people say I want to go into farming. But it really makes a big difference 
what type you go into. Trees and vines take a lot of work. Dairy takes a lot of work. Wheat, 
maybe not as much. 
 
 
 
#kansas #grapes #tonywolf 
 
 
 
MN: Also depends on where you are, too. That's really important, too. For example, in Kansas, 
extension system research group has established so much data about how to grow wheat. So if 
you follow what they're saying, chances are, you're not going to fail. But here, in grape 
production, no matter I spend time and resources and how much time Tony and everybody 
spends, we're still in really changing environment. 
 
[01:08:01] 
 
 
 
KS: And in relatively early years. People have been growing wheat in Kansas for hundreds of 
years. But grapes here only really since the 70s.

MN: The majority of them started in the late 90s, early 90s. Only 25 years. That is quite different 
from California too. Because California they have their knowledge and know-how. Which really 
caters to their environments and their clientele. That cannot translate into our system. 
 
[01:08:37] 
 
 
 
KS: So you couldn’t pluck somebody from California and plop them down here. And they 
wouldn’t know what to do. 
 
 
 
MN: And the same goes for Europe too. Because their environment is quite different, and their 
diseases are different too. For example, the black rot I was talking about is not a big issue in 
Europe. Simply because we haven’t' exported here. They have a little bit of incidents, but not 
major. But here black rot is the one that can be a big issue as well. 
 
[01:09:03] 
 
 
 
KS: How much do you have communication with, say, your equivalent in a European country, 
say. Do you ever have exchange? 
 
 
 
MN: Yes, we do. Sometimes they come to get some research done. Also, if I have a question, I 
can shoot them an email. But it's not as often as I do the same thing with our collaborators or 
people who are in the same shoes that I am in the universities in the US. We have even more 
tighter connection than the people in Europe. 
 
[01:09:39] 
 
 
 
KS: But you don't have the need to talk to your European counterparts ?

MN: Often the issue is quite different. So I don't have the need to reach out to them. Like ripe rot 
is a good example. There are a couple different researchers in Europe have studied work on 
them, so it would be easier for me to ask them what's going on than people in the US It really 
depends on [?] 
 
 
 
KS: Do they have international organizations that get wine-growers together? 
 
 
 
MN: Good question for Tony. They have the American association it's really strong. I know for a 
fact, people in Japan they go to that meeting. But there's a wealth of information for them. 
Especially if they're having international [?] For plant pathology, yes we do. This year in Boston 
is a meeting for international congress for plant pathologists. That's includes everybody whose 
working with plant pathologies, not only for grapes. We do have international society.

#mold #strawberries #grapes #phomposis 
 
 
 
KS: Like as you said at the beginning, the similarity between the mold on strawberries and 
grapes, so there’s' probably where you can learn from somebody's having a problem on one 
plant, and it applies to what you do. 
 
 
MN: In my case, phomopsis it's different species. But at least in that particular case, their habit 
of growing on the media is very similar. So I don't have to worry about that. So we can learn 
from other people quite a bit. 
 
[01:11:23] 
 
 
 
KS: Would you ever try to grow grapes? 
 
 
 
MN: No. It can happen here, but that's enough grape growing for me.

KS: Do you do all the maintenance yourself? 
 
 
 
#maintenance #fieldwork #field #labor #statesupport #funding #workers 
 
 
 
MN: Until last year, I didn't have anybody to help me out in terms of help from the state. So I 
had to come up with my own grant to hire somebody to work in the field. Of course I start them 
myself. But beyond that. And also I just have to be there to know what's going on. I try to get as 
involved as possible. But now in the last couple years we did have support from the state to get 
some maintenance work in the field. I didn't have to worry about everything. 
 
 
 
KS: Because that can be almost a full time job. Just that. You're not one of these people who's 
going to have a full career, PhD, and then decide to open a vineyard. 
 
 
 
MN: Probably not me. That's why I admire and also they impress me. Knowing the difficulty and 
challenges, that's great, but it's not going to be me. I think I like more of the research part than 
the wine and wine making. If I'm really good at winemaking, I might be different. I'm more 
intrigued by the biology...than the actual winemaking and selling wine. I'm not even touching it, 
that's beyond me. [They laugh.] 
 
[01:13:19] 
 
 
 
KS: That's one of the thing I've been the most surprised impressed by is that people have had full 
careers, very accomplished, and then they decide, "I'm going to do winemaking now to relax or 
as my retirement." Wow, that's a big job. Is there anything you want to add? 
 
[01:13:41] 
 
 
 
MN: That's about it, I think. 
 
 
 
KS: You said you came here 2009?

#revenue 
 
 
 
MN: Yes. Going back to the previous conversation when we were eating lunch. I think Tony 
covered it, I'm pretty sure, but the state of Virginia has been supportive in terms of research as 
well as the growers’ society. Going back to your first question, I think that's one of the unique 
features of the whole thing. That's why Virginia is quite different from Maryland, even, or North 
Carolina. The support not only from the government, but also grower groups is so supportive of 
what we do. That impressed me most in terms of our working conditions. Especially compared 
with people in Japan, for example. Nowadays we understand what's going, and they try to form 
similar structure, and that's very hard. Before that it's a very individual-based. So some big 
company might have enough money to do their own thing, but not to fit into the whole society. 
 
[01:15:01] 
 
 
 
KS: I think that is. It took a while for Virginia to come to the realization of how. I knew there 
were a lot of changes with the alcohol, but then once they liberalized that, then you saw this big 
boom, and now you know you see tourism, economic development behind it where they're 
creating jobs in places they probably thought they had no chance of new revenues coming in so 
it's been really remarkable. Thank you so much I really appreciate it. 
 
 
 
MN: Thank you.
