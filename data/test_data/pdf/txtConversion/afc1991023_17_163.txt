(Passing through his garden, he names the plants that were 
there. 
Talks to his grandchildren.) 
We 
like to grow sunflowers 
for the birds. 
Especially like cardinals, titmice, mocking 
birds. 
We have a feeder in back of the house. 
This 
is our 
nature trail. 
The trees are labelled. 
(animal) 
This season fouled me up. 
First it was too wet to work, 
then 
it was too hot and dry. 
Here is some bottle gentian, or 
closed gentian. 
It never really opens up. 
My wife's niece 
brought it down from Pennsylvania. 
More acorns than usual. 
"There's nothing spectacular in here. 
It's just as 
it 
is, more 
or less." 
Here's a wild tall blueberry. 
The birds usually get 
the berries. 
The kids like this place. 
"If we didn't go through 
the nature trail they'd have a fit." 
Here's the pitch pine --
fairly heavy bark. 
But they use a lot of 
it for lumber. 
You 
used to, 
if you had a piece of 
land with timber on 
it, you used 
it for lumber for building your house or stable. 
You didn't buy 
anything. 
You cut it and took 
it to the sawmill. 
-- Here's a 
nice piece of 
lichen on the tree roots. -- 
My father had to haul 
wood for his house at the turn of the century. 
Here's a yew. 
It 
was planted by birds carrying the seed. 
If 
it comes up here, 
it 
stays. 
Here's a grape fern that popped up. 
Holly.

False holly. 
These spruce trees here were part of the

nursery. 
We just let them go. 
We weren't interested in getting 
rich -- just let things come as they will. 
Some people can't do 
anything except make money. 
We did well, but didn't knock 
ourselves silly about it. 
(He sees where his brother—in—law from 
Ohio has cut and neatly stacked a dead tree and comments how nice 
that is.) 
Here's a scarlet oak. 
I've tagged this lady's slipper 
so 
it doesn't get knocked down. 
This moss is always alongside 
lichens. 
Can't remember the name. 
A lot of this underbrush is 
huckleberry. 
A lot of these come on a long stem and hang 
in 
droops. 
They don't taste like a regular blueberry. 
We eat them 
raw. 
White pine, sassafras. 
We've never used the sassafras 
roots for anything. 
I just like to smell 
it. 
Here's a chestnut 
oak. 
It never grows very well. 
occupations, (foodways) 
In the winter we cut out the dead trees and cripples for 
firewood because wood is all 
we heat our house with. 
We have one 
stove 
in the cellar that we use all 
the time, and use the one 
upstairs when it's real cold. 
Here's a rhododendron that someone 
planted in a tree stump. 
10 
Here's another rhododendron -- rhododendron maxim. 
These 
were cripples from the nursery that we planted here. 
"There's 
nothing special here. 
We just like 
it. 
. . . It's just nature, 
and that's what we 
like." 
Here's where a douglas fir came up 
where a pine tree died. 
I always say nature takes care of 
things. 
Here's where a lot of sassafras came up. 
It must be a 
good place for them. 
In fact we have so many of them that some 
of them have been burnt up for firewood. 
I don't like the leaves 
on the path. 
I use a mist blower to blow the leaves off the 
path. 
We need more cleaning up in here. 
We pick up small wood 
for kindling wood. 
My wife and I gather it, 
and the kids help 
some of the time. (yardscapes) 
(He picks up a cone branch that squirrels have cut off the tree.) 
Here you can see how the squirrels rob the pine cones of their 
seeds. 
(Interviewer asks 
if he has ever done cone popping.) 
Only for myself once 
in a while. 
Up in the pine 
barrens the people they call pineys do a lot of that. 
Here are 
some mushrooms called Indian pipes. 
(Mr. Liepe holds the mike 
while Elaine takes some pictures of the mushrooms.) 
15 
Indian pipes are not a fungus. 
They'll only be here for a 
day or so. 
They're hard to find because they don't last very 
long. 
The natives know about Indian pipes -- "Did you see any 
Indian pipes today?" 
Something to talk about. 
They like to grow 
where they're not too crowded in. 
insider/ outsider 
We 
like to 
look up and down these trails. 
(Mr. Liepe holds 
the mike again while Elaine shoots some pictures of the view down 
the trails.) 
There's where the sassafras has grown over the 
trail and made an arbor. 
There's a dead pine we've got to do 
something with and try not to wreck the place. 
I like this bower 
effect. 
There's a swamp maple, and a highbush blueberry.

(He tells the story of Miss White and blueberry culture.) 
Now we have all kinds of varieties that Miss White never saw. 
Here we have some azaleas planted. 
Cripples from the nursery. 
There's a pile of yew stalks and brush that needs to be cleared 
out. 
Here's some spotted wintergreen (pipscisila Csp?]). 
It's 
called spotted wintergreen because it's an evergreen. 
(Again he 
holds the mike and Elaine takes a picture after he clears some of 
the leaves from around the plant.)

Here's where a couple of trees were hit by 
lightening. 
Here 
we have black pine and white pine that was part of the nursery, 
and the birch came up by itself.

(After World War II, Leo and Hazel started into the florist 
supply business and sent out some catalogs to people from a list 
obtained from a former employer who had gone out of the 
business.) 
Hazel (paraphrased): 
We contacted John Cox of 
Philadelphia -- one of the largest wholesalers in the Delaware 
Valley -- and we told him who we were, and he bought a few things 
from us 
in 
1946. 
Then he gave us an order the next year, and has 
been with us ever since. 
(plant), gathering, marketing, occupations 
I'd 
like my son to help us, but he's like his father --
alcoholic. 
Maybe it's good he has a job where he knows he has to 
be sober (boat building). 
I always used to try to wait on 
customers before Leo got home because you never knew what he was 
going to do or say. 
Leo hasn't had a drink for five years. 
In 
the first year that he stopped drinking, I went out to dinner 
more in that one year than I did 
in the whole thirty years 
before. 
I wish my son would just make up his mind to stop 
it. 
His wife doesn't help him because she drinks while she waits. 
I 
used to go 
to the bar and wait all 
day and drink tea. 
I think 
it's hereditary -- it runs in the family. 
Some family members 
are completely lost -- we don't know where they are. 
But you 
can't worry about them -- they know where we live. 
I worry about 
my two granddaughters. 
I hope there's enough of my side of the 
family in them that they'll go straight. 
I have two grandsons --
one seventeen and one nineteen -- and the one nineteen is going 
to be just like my son.

They don't try to help themselves. 
I was brought up that if 
you don't have, you go without. 
We never bought anything on 
time. 
And I think we were happier. 
We didn't have any radio for 
a long time. 
We always had a pig, chickens, sweet and white 
potatoes, broccoli, carrots -- we canned them. 
Not freezing like 
now. 
Would you believe that this year I have only canned 
fourteen quarts of peaches, and that's all? 
I made a little 
jelly out of pink plums that I bought at the Acme, too, but last 
year I did 75 quarts of peaches. 
Leo likes them with his cereal. 
I made relishes galore. 
I made zucchini bread. 
I've always 
canned since I've been thirteen. 
I learned from my aunt next 
door. 
We made applesauce and corn -- they were two very hard 
things to keep. 
You either did it hot pack or cold pack -- there 
was no pressure cooker then. 
And no freezer. 
(foodways) 
Later, my aunt asked me, "Why do you put your applesauce in 
the freezer?" 
Well, she didn't realize how simple it 
is. 
You 
just put your apples through the grinder and cook them, and put a 
little sugar in, stir it up and put it 
in the freezer. 
But when 
you canned it, when you put the sugar in, 
it had to be boiling 
hot, and put it right in the jars to make it keep because you 
lost a lot. 
She didn't understand that. 
I'm going to make some 
applesauce and some chunky apples -- I have a basket of apples 
there now. 
Leo likes Winesap, but a friend that we buy dried 
material from [we don't collect everything ourselves] has a tree 
of golden transparents that we 
like.

My family had a big barn that we used to store things in --
I still own the house. 
My father fixed the back window with a 
hinge so 
it would open, and we had a little round oil 
stove that 
you put up there to keep you warm, and he would shoot a deer from 
the window. 
It helped to feed us during the Depression. 
Deer 
hunters would come to our house and my father would show them 
where to go to 
hunt, and the deer meat was divided up. 
My 
husband hasn't hunted in years. 
He used to be a driver -- where 
you go and yell and scare the deer out -- but he never went much 
for that. 
He never believed in shooting animals unless you were 
hungry. 
hunting 
When we moved here, I was always afraid our child would run 
out into the street, and I wanted a fence to be built, but Leo 
said, 
"I was fenced in for too many months." 
(He was a prisoner 
of war in Germany.) 
He's never allowed a fence, and he doesn't 
like the dog to be tied -- everything has to be able to run free. 
He doesn't allow cats to be kept in the house -- He says, "Leave 
'em out. 
If 
it's their time to die, they'll die." 
Now we're 
members of a prisoner of war club, and they have meetings every 
month. 
Every third month it's a dinner meeting. 
We met a fellow 
we hadn't seen since 1943. 
He died a year after we met him at 
the club. 
I wrote his wife a nice note and told how we had come 
home from Texas with him on the train. 
If 
it had been me, I 
would have had to answer, but she didn't. 
There are three 
Thatcher--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
chapters of the club -- one 
in Pennsylvania and two 
in New 
Jersey. 
They started a state chapter in the spring. 
Every month 
you get a booklet giving the names and locations of different 
people, and it's nice to find out where people we knew in the 
service are. 
Leo doesn't write to people -- I have to do the 
writing. 
(She talks to her granddaughter for a moment about 
running barefoot.) 
That's my oldest granddaughter -- she lives 
with us during the summer. 
She lives 
in May's Landing and has a 
step—father. 
voluntary organizations, social networks, armed 
forces 
We wouldn't be 
in business today if 
it hadn't been for me 
keeping things together. 
There was a point when I thought I'd 
just take my two kids and go back home. 
But I stuck it out. 
I'm 
not sorry, but it was hard with kids and customers and him 
drinking. 
He used to collect laurel and huckleberry and 
different things, back when you could just go 
into the woods and 
help yourself. 
Now a lot of the places where we used to collect 
stuff 
is all 
homes. 
We used to sell a lot more cattails because 
he could do all 
the collecting and work himself. 
But now, for 
instance, we buy a bag of pine cones -- it used to be you bought 
500 pine cones, and they were in a bag. 
Now we buy the bag, and 
we're lucky if there are 400 cones 
in there. 
We used to go up to 
Chatsworth and pick them up from the collectors, and a lot of 
them were old -- as Leo would say, "old enough to vote." 
They're 
no good to us except to start the fire with. 
We'd tell 
the man 
(collector) about it, and he'd point at his wife and say, "Oh, 
she picked them."

At one time Leo held two jobs (one was at Lenox), and I'd 
hold the fort down here. 
We needed extra money because my 
daughter had left her husband, and we had the two kids here. 
I'd 
go to Chatsworth to buy the cones with my friend. 
You'd step in 
the door and there was no floor! 
It was just dirt. 
I don't know 
what the rest of the house looked like, I only knocked on the 
door. 
Leo used to say that I was afraid of those people. 
I 
wasn't afraid, but I didn't want to go 
in anywhere I didn't know 
where I was going. 
We don't go there anymore. 
We buy from one 
man there who buys from all 
the people who bring them in to him. 
Leo likes to buy extra now so that next July we'll have some to 
sell. 
We just open them up then and they're ready. 
They're 
easier to open then than when they're real green. 
He's got the 
oven going today because he's anticipating 
orders to come. 
Do you want to walk over to the plastic house? (This 
structure is shaped like a long quonset but and 
is a framework 
covered with flexible plastic -- translucent white.) 
In there, 
they are opened up by the sun. 
They turn a sort of pinkish—brown 
-- it's really pretty. aesthetics 
(She comments while walking to 
the plastic building that her son could have come and helped haul 
grapevines or cut sea grass this morning, but there was no sign 
of him.) 
My grandson nineteen could've helped too, but . . . . 
They know where you are when they need a dollar.

(Gene asks how he decides which cones to put in the oven and 
which ones to put in the plastic shed.) 
Leo: 
I'm going to run 
these through the oven, too, when the others are done. 
Hazel: 
Some of these aren't going to open 
in here. 
This room really 
gets hot. 
Your glasses steam up. 
We have some pepper grass 
hanging here to bleach, and the bunches will have to be turned 
inside out so the inside shafts will bleach. 
We have some that 
is hanging 
in a dark shed so 
it won't bleach -- they want it both 
ways. 
It comes the same time as strawberries. 
Leo: 
It got it's 
name from when it's green, 
if you chew the seeds, they're hot. 
Hazel: 
There's sea grass 
in the hampers. 
That's about the last 
thing we collect. 
Leo: 
I packed up a basket of closed cones to 
get them out of here -- and look -- they've opened. 
If you keep 
picking up 
in here, these should all open up 
in the end. 
There's 
sixty thousand cones over there now, and there must be about 
forty thousand here. 
Those over there could mold if I don't keep 
them covered. 
Hazel: 
I've walked across salt hay to get sea 
grass. 
I told my grandson that when he was little, they would 
sickle the high grass down for me because I was afraid to go 
through.

I told my grandson, "I took your potty, your toys, 
lunch, 
water, milk, and I took you and crossed that plank and cut that 
sea grass. 
And now you're nineteen years old but you can't cut 
any sea grass for me." 
He said it 
itched his arms. 
I said, 
"Well, wear a long—sleeved shirt. 
What do you think I did?" 
I was born here and Leo wasn't, but he's more a piney than I 
am. 
He'd fit right in Chatsworth with those people. 
Leo: 
I've 
had them come up to me 
in a bar and say, "Hello, Richardson!" 
I 
said, "You've got the wrong guy." 
This piney Richardson, you put 
us together, we'd look like brothers. 
(Siren in background.) 
Hazel: 
I always heard people called pineys because they 
lived up 
in the Chatsworth area. 
But now they call themselves 
pineys down at Lower Bank, and they have stickers that say "Piney 
Power," and t—shirts, and all kinds of things. 
(Sotto voce:)My 
daughter—in—law over there is piney. 
Her mother's brought up 
that way, and some of the things she does -- funny little things 
-- and I said, well, dammit, she's a piney. 
These are all 
bags of cones that need to be opened. 
They'll 
be put on the table and sorted over -- all 
the leaves and loose 
dry needles and things need to be sorted out or they'll burn our 
oven down. 
(Elaine asks 
if 
the fire has gone out in the cone—popping 
oven because the smoke has stopped.) 
Leo: 
You wanna go 
in and 
reduce? 
(He opens 
it and lets Elaine and Gene look in.

emphasizes the heat, while Hazel notices how good it smells.) 
(Elaine asks Hazel 
if she makes baskets and things, or Leo does 
it all.) 
I don't have much skin on my hands from scarlet fever, 
so I can't handle those things. 
I decorate a few baskets at 
Christmas and sell them through my daughter who works at the 
courthouse in May's Landing. 
Word gets around. 
And I took one 
in 
to Sears, and the girls liked it and asked about it again this 
year. 
I'm going to flower—arranging school, and the first class 
was on how to make a bow. 
Well, I still can't do 
it right. 
Leo 
does the bows on grave blankets, but that's different. 
We 
started out making grave blankets for just the family. 
Now we 
just sell the flat grave blanket to a florist in G—Egg Harbor 
City; 05GT. 
They put their own decorations on it. 
It's a block 
of wood about two by four (feet. 
Probably more like three feet 
long by a foot high) and we set sphagnum moss on 
it and wrap wire 
around it. 
Then all 
the greens from here are put into 
it. 
Then 
you put all the decorations on 
it that you want, because once you 
set it out on the ground, the moss freezes and you can't get 
anything else into it unless you take it 
in by the stove. 
It's a 
spray. 
We make them in different shapes, and we learned how to 
make one to set up against a tombstone from a man who used to buy 
from us. 
We decorate either with all 
red or all white -- plastic 
poinsettias. 
Mostly for family.

(Leo 
is making a bird's nest basket -- he named them because 
that's what they look like. 
He winds grape vines around and 
around, adding new ones as he goes, until 
it looks like a little 
bird's nest. 
He explains that part of the vine lives and part of 
it dies, and the living part is the best for making the baskets 
because it 
is flexible.) 
There --you add a handle, put in some 
fill 
and add your silk flowers. 
I get $2.50 for it and they get 
$35.00. 
They like these little (curly) pieces left on.

it climbs.) 
That is 
the toughest piece of material I've run into. 
When they get a

All 
these vines

You can tell a dead vine --
it would snap. 
And they're brown. 
The live ones are reddish. 
The vines grow 20 feet a year.

Leo and Elaine return to the plastic

Tape off temporarily. 
While walking 
back, Leo points out foxtail millet.) 
We hang the foxtail millet 
upside down and dry 
it and bleach him out -- take all 
the green 
out of him. 
There's a bayberry bush, but you won't see any 
berries on 
it -- the birds get them. 
I've dug thousands of them. 
I used to supply bayberry bushes for New York City for the

I had some here which I got from a

There's a lot of 
bittersweet behind the shed -- we planted a few plants and 
it 
went wild. 
You use 
it at Thanksgiving. 
It has little pods with

It doesn't last, though.

think it's a fast buck. 
You've seen the process -- that stuff 
was cut in June. 
You have to sort it out, weigh out every 
package -- sell the good stuff, or take 
it out and burn it. 
I 
wouldn't sell 
you anything I wouldn't buy myself. 
There's work 
involved. 
You take them with you and they say, 
"I wouldn't do 
this for a living." 
My son only wants to build boats. 
And he 
knows the woods -- he'd be a good woodsman -- but he doesn't want 
to be bothered with 
it. 
I stay in contact with other woodsmen by 
going and buying off them. 
They're in different places -- even 
in Pennsylvania. 
We found each other through the thing with 
three letters -- b—a—r. 
I've never seen one of them that didn't 
drink. 
I quit. 
I was the biggest rummy around. 
I saw Doug (Elliot) 
in some magazine. 
He was down 
in North 
Carolina. 
Some damn thing he was digging and eating instead of 
using vegetables. 
I know of some of them in the woods, but they 
can stay there. 
I still 
like my potatoes and ham. 
I've dug and

shipped out Indian sweet potatoes. 
They're about 8" 
in diameter 
and they go deep into the ground. 
Sometimes you can never find 
the bottom of them. 
I haven't tried to eat them. 
I've never 
seen anything so big. 
They're called man of the earth. 
I think 
they're nearly extinct around here now.

Did she tell

I said, "Yeah, three times." 
"Three different times? 
What happened?" 
I said, "The first one 
died of eating poison mushrooms. 
And the second one -- what the 
hell -- I told him some tale. 
She got 
in to the doctor later --
he said, "That husband of yours been married three times?" 
She 
said, "That damn liar'II almost say anything." 
I forget just how 
-- I just read that joke. 
Two wives died of eating poison 
mushrooms. 
And the second wife, he asked him, "Did she eat 
poison mushrooms too?" 
He said, "No, I killed her. 
She wouldn't 
eat them." 
But I betcha I met five Italian women 
right after 
that big rain we had -- they were looking for stumpies right 
away. 
The dry season must have wiped the spore out because they 
weren't having much luck.

The Poles come down here to pick the Pollack mushrooms. 
I 
picked them and turned them over and they're full of bugs and 
worms on the other side. 
They have an orange—colored top on 
them. 
We call them pine mushrooms. 
The other ones grow around 
the oak stumps. 
I've eaten poke and stuff 
in the woods other 
people don't eat, but I don't tell them because as sure as I did 
they'd sue me. 
Hazel: 
have you ever eaten lamb's quarters? 
or 
cinnamon fern fiddler heads? 
Leo: 
That's when the fern starts 
shooting up. 
You eat the fiddler heads of the bracken fern, not 
the cinnamon fern. 
Boy, I could make a living down on Mannheim 
Avenue eating cinnamon fern. 
Hazel: 
The brown thrush eats the 
berries of the poke weed. 
Leo: 
It's not the berries of the poke 
that's poisonous -- it's the plant. 
You eat the poke shoots 
before they get too big -- then they're too strong.

We find colonies of red wing blackbirds down 
in the cattails 
where they've made their nests. 
We leave them. 
I have a 
mockingbird lives here. 
He keeps other birds away from that red 
juniper -- that's his eating. 
(Hazel holds up a bird's nest she 
found, and Leo says that he found a nest while cutting sea grass 
not too long ago that had two eggs 
in 
it. 
Should have taken 
it 
because obviously the eggs were infertile or they would have 
hatched earlier in the year.) 
You can sell hornet's nests to 
florists quick. 
We cut around red wing blackbird's nests. 
We 
don't need the cattails that bad, and they're not that scarce. 
I 
took that red wing blackbird's nest because it was incomplete.

(Dog, Radar,

Eileen and 
Elaine are looking at a topo map, 
locating places.) 
Here's 
Nigger Island Road. 
He (Joseph Mapes, the black man for whom the 
road 
is named) owned a lot of 
land 
in that area. 
He married a 
white woman in Philadelphia and they came here to escape 
disapproval. 
It was around the turn of the century. 
A man named 
Gilbert Irons owned the 
land when I was a kid. 
Here's Weber's Corners -- they lived on the corner. 
They 
used to have a lot of outbuildings -- now they're all 
torn down. 
Church Road is on the map -- it's also known as Old Church Road 
and Meetinghouse Road. 
naming, cognitive maps 
I was going to take you for a walk in this area we call 
the 
Nursery. 
It used to be a nursery -- now my brother leases 
it 
from the old nursery owner, Mr. Boreaux, to plant corn. 
(Dog

I've never called Lower Bank Bridge Pacemaker Bridge -- the kid

Other place names mentioned (see labelled topo map and 
place name forms for locations): 
Seaf Weeks Road, 
Maxwell 
Street, Charles Avenue, Cavileer Lane (Eileen's ancestral home. 
She points out homes of her mother, grandmother, and the location 
Thatcher--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 12 
of a place that was an 
inn. Dog noises.) 
The old church on 
Church Road is only used a couple of times a year -- Christmas 
and funerals. 
Other names: 
DeBow Lane. 
Seaf Weeks Road and 
others are kept open mainly for the fire service. 
Lover's Lane 
comes into 563 at Green Bank. 
When I was a kid, we'd go to up by 
Harrisville to park. 
Now they probably go down to this place by 
the river called the Landing. 
(Dog talk.) 
(celebration)

The Blueberries, or the Blueberry Bogs, 
is an area 
where there are a bunch of old packing houses. 
I don't know why 
we call them bogs. 
They're not bogs. 
They're not used for 
raising blueberries anymore. 
Someone was going to make a 
campground out of 
it but didn't. 
Here's my father's cranberry 
bog -- Fox and Cavileer. 
My son—in—law works for Rutgers, 
further north. 
Hog Islands, 
in the middle of the river -- my 
grandfather owned Little Hog Island for years -- trapped muskrats 
there. 
Bell Lane, Henderson Avenue. 
Charlie Bell used to 
live 
here. 
The road used to out all the way through to Wading River 
years ago. 
Turtle Creek Road. 
There's a creek called Turtle 
Creek there, and it does have snappers. 
My parents knew how to 
cook snapper, but I've never cooked one. 
I like 
it. 
I could 
never see Warren (her husband) trapping a snapper. 
Some roads we 
know just by their route numbers, 
like 542. 
But I don't know the 
Route number of the road I live on -- I think it's 653, but I'm 
not positive. 
We call 
it North River Road. 
place names 
15 
We made up some of these names when we had the fire 
company maps made. 
The whole road was River Road, but we made 
this part North River Road, and the part down by the river East 
River Road. 
They had a River Road 
in Green Bank, but we named 
them East River Drive and West River Drive. 
I've heard this 
section of 542 called Johnson Road (from 563 to Bulltown), but 
it's only called that by the people who live there. 
Here's Lance 
Run Road. 
The road on the map labelled as Lower Bank Road we 
call The Two—Mile Stretch. 
The one over by Green Bank 
is called 
the River Swamp Road. 
It floods and gets frosty -- people go off 
it all the time. 
The road that The Two—Mile Stretch connects 
with I call Weekstown Road. 
Parks Landing Road is a neat road 
because it's so 
long -- it goes all 
the way into Port Republic, 
and there are only about three houses on 
it. 
(More dog noises.) 
20 
This gridded area is Egg Harbor City. 
It was supposed 
to be on the river, but it didn't work out, so they made it on 
the railroad. 
(Dog growls while Sue tries to take pictures.) 
I like to walk in the Nursery because it's different every 
season. 
There's something different in there all 
the time --
especially where there are things he's left in there like 
dogwoods, wisteria and rhododendrons. 
I also love to walk to the 
river, and I like to walk 
in my own woods here. 
We have eight 
acres. 
There's a creek called Kate's Pewter Creek. 
I don't know 
Thatcher--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 13 
why it's called that. 
There's a reservoir and a man has some 
cranberries along there, too. 
25 
If I'm right around here, 
I'll 
go off the trails, but 
not anywhere else. 
My grandfather got lost in this swamp once 
for three days. 
My grandfather swears he lost a cow in 
quicksand, but I've never seen 
it. 
There aren't any trail 
markings made by gunning clubs, because most of the clubs hunt 
(tape runs out, but her statement was:) 
in other areas. 
This 
area is only hunted by 
local men.

I told her she should 
have waited until spring. 
There were black—eyed susans, 
butterfly weed, Queen Anne's lace, coriophus (sp?), cedars and 
pines. 
I collect grapevine across the street. 
The grapes are 
called chicken grapes and they're good for wine and jelly, but 
not for eating. 
Fox grapes are a little bigger. 
We weren't

Two holes

Philadelphia bush, or mock orange. 
We call 
it mock 
orange. 
Spirea, roses, dogwood, pussy willow, more mock orange, 
wild rose like they make hedges out of -- the birds love it, 
so I 
keep 
it. 
My dad built this bird feeder for me for Christmas 
once. 
I like cardinals and blue jays for their color, but I also 
like the little titmouse and snowbirds. 
My cousin, when she was 
eleven, helped us paint the house (she's 29 now, and she painted 
"LOVE" on the chimney. 
Flowering crab, cherry (will probably 
have to take 
it out because it's too close to the house -- 
it was 
probably planted by birds dropping the seed). 
Old Christmas tree 
against house for birds to live and eat in. 
I hate to cut trees. 
I hang peanut butter and oatmeal and rinds 
in there. 
Roses. 
Honeysuckle overruns everything, though. 
This rose came from my 
grandma, who got it from a woman who told her she had to have it 
if she was to 
live here. 
It's a single rose. 
Flowering plum --
just ornamentals out here 
in front. 
If you don't take care of 
them, fruit trees attract yellow jackets and stuff. 
I like the 
flowers, but I don't have to be bothered with the fruit.

Butterfly bush -- that's my name for it. 
Pink spiky 
blossom. 
Cherry -- they're beautiful 
in the fall. 
Philadelphia

When we moved here, there was nothing but grass 
around the house. 
I've planted everything else. 
Mock orange 
again. 
That telephone pole ( from untaped conversation) has the 
same number -- 7334 -- as our first house in Philadelphia did. 
I 
found that out when we had the electricity turned on. 
(Eileen's 
mother drives by.) 
We own a large part of 
land next to the house 
lot, 
too. 
My mother—in—law parks her car there so she doesn't 
have to back 
it out.

Chinese elm, 
lilacs, white and purple. 
Martin house built by my father -- I 
like the birds, and he 
likes to build things like that. 
I keep 
my pony over in that area. 
That cross over by the woods marks 
one of my horses' grave. 
Pile of wood from tree struck by 
lightning. 
Helium tank -- don't know what to do with it. 
Warren 
and my dad and I designed and built this barn where the pony is. 
(There are lots of cats -- Cecil, Jason and Tigger -- 
in the 
barn). 
The chickens are there, too -- we're going to build a 
fence so they can be outside.

Ralph: 
This 
is only my third trip to 
this area this year. 
Not very often. 
Mostly I come here to 
chase out people cutting my trees. 
All I need is one or two 
trees a year. 
I don't want others to cut them. 
There's oak, 
pine and birch. 
Sometimes they just cut trees and leave them. 
(Sue Samuelson puts the thumb of her glove over the microphone to 
act as a windscreen.) 
Ralph: 
I made one guy I caught stack all 
the wood right by my house. 
wood poaching 
I like to walk 
in the woods when the weather is nice. 
We 
used to stand still and look for deer. 
When we were kids there 
were packs of wild dogs. 
We took off then. 
I've heard of 
fox hunting, but I don't think there's much of that here. 
The 
wild dogs that chased us weren't hounds. 
I have a hound. 
(animal) 
To discover this standing wall here 
in Amatol when we were 
kids was like an archaeologist discovering Ninevah or Babylon. 
(More jokes about the glove windscreen: 
Ralph says he's going to 
complain to the President. 
We move a little to the east to some 
more foundations.) 
Speculation about what some of the ruins 
were. 
Comments about an unusual fungus.

Continued speculation about different shapes of 
structures in the ruins. 
Mostly small talk while Carl shoots 
pictures. 
Ralph: 
Once I went camping back in the Pine Barrens 
in February. 
That was 
in college. 
I was a Cub Scout when I was 
a kid, but they didn't have Boy Scouts here then. 
(Ralph looks 
down into a small opening to see 
if there are any animals --
there aren't.) 
(More glove levity.) history, recreation

Some small burnt—out areas are probably due to parties 
that people have had 
in the woods. 
And the loggers (people who 
cut wood here) pile up all the small twigs and stuff and burn 
them. I know some of them -- they do different things during the 
year, and logging 
is one of them. 
Sometimes they come 
in with a 
map that somebody gives them for permission to cut, but then they 
don't pay any attention to the real boundaries.

Sue reads the historical marker: 
"AMATOL: 
Shell—loading 
plant during World War I. 
Operations began in July, 1918."

(In the car. 
Ralph has us drive past a radar tower. 
He mentions a black neighborhood of Elwood south across the 
tracks.) 
Mention of the fire company that burned. 
(Bad noise.) 
Mention of a farm market now turned into a car repair and sales 
place. 
The stand was owned at one time by a family member. 
Others along the way were also owned by relatives. 
(We leave 
Carl 
off to photograph the road signs for Emma's Market while we 
go 
in 
to watch the making of grave blankets.)

Can the constellation of activities in the Pinelands

We need to be able to articulate arguments for protection of 
specific phenomena.
