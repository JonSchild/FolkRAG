START OF RECORDING 
 
[Cedar Sigo reads "What did you learn here? (Old Man House, Suquamish)"] 
 
Cedar Sigo:  This poem began after visiting the site of Old Man House, the main winter long 
house for the Suquamish people. We gathered there for two thousand years (at least) until it 
was burned down by the U.S. government in 1870. My tribe has commemorated the site with a 
small waterfront park. My sister Lydia lives just down the street.  
 
Prior to writing this poem I remembered Joy Harjo asking herself, "What did you learn here?" 
while visiting her homelands in the Southeast. I wanted to ask and answer the same question 
and see if the answer might take shape as poetry.  I wanted to appreciate our artifacts beyond 
the lighted museum case and to show that their beauty stems from the ways in which they 
were put to use day after day.  
 
The rooms of the poem become more and more historically specific as I get into ancient 
strategies for breeding the (now extinct) woolly dogs. Then the poem shifts further up the coast 
of Washington (almost in the manner of a drone) providing aerial footage of the Makah 
reservation along with strands of their Pompei-like history.
