Good afternoon and thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this historic project, the
Archie Green Folklife Occupations Project of the Library of Congress.
EG
Thank you.
CH
How are you today?
EG
I’m doing well.
CH
Wonderful. Would you please state your complete name and year of birth?
EG
Sure. My complete name is Ernest James Grant and I was born in 1958.
CH
Where were you born and raised?
EG
I was born in Asheville, North Carolina but was raised in a small town about 10 miles east of
Nashville called Swannanoa. It's spelled S-W-A-N-N-A-N-O-A [laughs]. It's a very small
rural-- At the time I grew up, it was mostly-- There's a lot of manufacturing plants that were
there, so everybody usually either graduated from high school and just worked in the mill, but
it was a very close-knit community.
CH
Your family dynamic, your mom, your dad and--
EG
Well, my father died when I was five. He worked for Hertz Rental Car. His thing was he was
actually, you know how people drive cars and drop ‘em off at some place, so he'd be the
person who’d be responsible for giving them back to the original rental place. My mom
worked 43 years at the post office. She was a custodian. Just, like I said, it was a very small
community so everybody knew who you were [chuckles], whose kids you were and, you
know, just, that's pretty much it. I'm the youngest of seven kids. I have four brothers and two
sisters. Two sisters are in L.A. and my-- I have one brother who's a minister. Actually, he’s a
presiding elder in the denomination I was brought up in, which is the AME Zion Church. One
brother that lives in Tennessee, and then two brothers, you know, well, my oldest brother still
lives in, you know, Swannanoa, and I have another brother that lives in Asheville.
CH
Ever been married?
EG
No.
afc2021009_005
CH
Children?
EG
No, no children. Not married.
CH
Not married. What state do you live in?
EG
North Carolina. Chapel Hill.
CH
Okay. Who or what encouraged or inspired you to become a nurse?
EG
Oh, long story [chuckles] but I'll make it brief for you.
CH
You can make it long!
EG
My original intent when I was in high school and thinking about, you know, a career and
etcetera, my original intent was that I wanted to be an anesthesiologist and drive a lime green
with a red interior 1968 Mercury Cougar. If you're familiar with that car, the coolest thing
about that car was it had the hideaway lights in the front grille, and I thought that was the
greatest thing. But, being the youngest of seven kids and being raised by a single parent, even
though I had the grades, you know, my high school guidance counselor suggested that, you
know, you could probably make it through undergrad but then you’d need, you know, getting
scholarships or whatever, or, you know, being able to get into medical school. So, he
suggested, you know, "How about going into nursing and you can become a nurse
anesthetist? If you still wanted to go to med school, you could work your way through med
school as a nurse anesthetist." I said, "Yeah, okay. Fine." Then he said, "Well, you might not
like nursing so, you know, the local--" Well, then it was called a technical institute, but now it
will be a community college. "They have a one-year nursing program that you may be
interested in doing, and you can always transition into the two-year program if you wanted to
do that," and I said, "Okay, we'll give that a shot." So, I started out in the LPN program.
Probably about three months into that, I forgot all about going to med school ‘cause I realized
that nursing was my calling. As soon as I graduated from LPN school, I wanted to-- I knew
then the scope of practice for the LPN at that time, we're talking-- I graduated high school in
'76, so we're talking in '77. I knew that I wanted to be able to do more for the people that I
cared for, and the only way to do that was to be an RN and, in particular, to have a bachelor's
degree. So, soon as I graduated from LPN school, I started taking part-time courses towards a
baccalaureate degree and, you know, subsequently just, you know, continued from there. So, I
guess you could say medicine lost me [chuckles] and nursing found me and, you know, it's
been, you know, I haven't looked back since.
CH
Where did you go to obtain your Bachelor's in Nursing?
afc2021009_005
EG
My bachelor's degree came from North Carolina Central University here in Durham, and both
my master's and PhD are from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
CH
What was your concentration for your master's and your doctorate?
EG
Both were geriatrics and critical care. I sort of did a dual concentration, but at the time, I was
working at the Burn Center, here at the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center. Always had a
special interest in my heart for geriatrics and plus, realizing that I would be getting older
[laughs], I needed to know all that I needed to know about geriatrics so that's what I did. And,
you know, really, you know, have enjoyed, you know, getting both those concentrations.
CH
You mentioned working in the Burn Center. Can you share with us your experience working
in the Burn Center?
EG 06:07
Sure, absolutely. Well, I started working when I moved here to the area to go to school to
complete my bachelor's degree. Again, keep in mind I was an LPN and I had a little more
advanced training than the LPN that would have come right out of school because I'd worked
in critical care at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. So, I was taking
care of post open-heart patients, patients who were on the balloon pump and everything else
because of, you know, having additional classes and certification in doing that. So, when I
moved to this area, there wasn't a job for me in critical care because, you know, RNs in the
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area are a dime a dozen because of, you know, you have Duke,
you have UNC, you have the community colleges that were turning out probably on average
between the three areas, you probably were getting about maybe 1,000 new RNs graduating
every year.
CH
Wow!
EG
So, you know, obviously a lot of them didn't stick around but, you know, a lot of them did,
and so the only two places that still used LPNs was the Burn Center was one. The other was a
little small sort of step down unit that was oncology for Durham Regional in Durham. The
thought of working for, you know, with cancer patients didn't quite appeal to me, but there
was another reason that I chose the Burn Center was the name. The official name of the Burn
Center is the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center. The Jaycees are a service organization like
the Lions Club or the Rotary Club. I was a member of the Jaycees in the Black Mountains, in
Swannanoa, and had actually done several fundraisers to support the Burn Center, you know,
because that was one of our charities. So, I figured, well, what better place to work than a
place that you’ve raised funds for and, you know, very familiar with, and I figured, yeah,
wouldn't be there that long anyway, you know. Just work there 'til I finish my baccalaureate
degree and then move back up to the mountains. Well, lo and behold, again, about six months
into working there, I realized that burn nursing was my calling. So, soon as I finished my
baccalaureate degree, I decided to stick around. I remember talking to the nurse manager at
the time, asking her, you know, "I’m about ready to graduate in about three months or so. Do
afc2021009_005
you think there's a position for me here?" Oh my gosh. She jumped up and down, gave me a
big hug and said, "You know, I was hoping that you would ask that!" She says, "I was afraid
to ask you about that, but yes. Yes, you've got a place here, you know, no matter what." So, it
was great. So, it was just an easy transition to, you know, transition from the role of LPN to
RN and be able to really, in my opinion, make a difference in the lives of the patients that I
cared for. My unit was unique in that we took from pediatrics through geriatrics, so, in the 36
and a half years that I was there, the youngest patient I had was a week old and the oldest was
104. So, and as I would continue to grow in that position, I would tell-- and working with
students and, you know, in the educator role and etcetera, I would always tell students,
"Everything you learn in nursing school we get to use in this environment because it's, you
know, it's family dynamics. It's, you know, psych, mental health. It's, you know, pediatrics.
It's geriatrics. It's the other comorbidities. It's even the OB-GYN.” We had a couple of
pregnant, you know, burn patients who, you know, got burned while they were pregnant or
whatever, you know. So, it was just really fascinating and always a challenge. That's one
thing that I liked. The other thing I enjoyed doing at the end of every day was to ask myself,
"Did you make a difference today?" Nine times out of 10, I could probably count in the 36
years, probably on one hand, the number of times that I felt that I did not make a difference in
someone's life that day, either-- not only either a patient or family member, or even my
colleagues. So, it was a job that was just full of rewards.
CH
It sounds so wonderful. So wonderful, so inspiring. You said you were there for 36 years?
EG
Yes.
CH
Did you have different positions throughout the 36 years?
EG
Yes, I started out-- Well, technically only two positions [laughs]. I started out as a staff nurse
and did that for about a year and a half, two years. Then, the position for the-- At the time, the
way the Burn Center was set up, we had a in-house educator and then we had an outreach
educator. The outreach person, their job was to go out and do training for, you know,
paramedics, local emergency rooms and etcetera about how to prepare the patient to get them
transferred to us so that, you know, with the idea being that the sooner you started fluids and
the right amount of fluids and, you know, and how to do that, the idea was that the patient
would be more stable by the time they got to us and etcetera, and just emphasizing, you
know, keeping them warm, getting the IV started, putting in the, you know, the Foleys and,
you know, things like that and, you know, here's our emergency, you know, transfer number
and, you know, that type thing. So, that position came open and I applied for it and got it and
grew it from-- They were probably at the time was doing maybe 30 presentations a year, but
when I retired, we were doing about 200 presentations a year, in addition to-- The other thing
I did was to add a research component onto it, you know, because I came from the position
of, the best way to treat a burn was to prevent it from happening in the first place. So, we
started doing several things like implementing a prevention program, going into the school
system, talking to young boys and girls about, you know, stop, dropping and rolling, you
know, don't touch, you know, hot things or don't play with matches, or make sure that you
have a working smoke alarm. Partnered a lot with the fire service and also several national
organizations, such as the National Fire Protection Association, which helped to write
afc2021009_005
standards and things for fire and, you know, like, smoke. Well, technically, they are a code
and standard-making organization, so anything you touch, there's a code or a standard with it.
They oversaw that, which I thought was really great. So, we had a very good prevention
program that specifically addressed prevention at all different ages, you know, from
pediatrics to geriatrics, all different-- multilingual, and then also got a few pieces of
legislation passed here within the state, such as it's mandatory now that any hot water heater
that is sold in the state of North Carolina, the temperature has to be set at 120 degrees with a
label on it telling the purchaser that if you decide to increase it, you know, there's the risk for
scald injuries and etcetera, because one of the things that we would see is that sometimes
manufacturers would set the hot water temperature 140, 150 degrees and at that temperature,
it takes less than about three seconds to produce a third degree or full thickness burn,
particularly in the older and younger adults because of how thin their skin would be. So, the
average person, you know, like, we run hot water all the time. You think, "Oh, you know, the
water’s just that hot," but what we would see is a lot of older adults who would-- maybe
they're taking a shower. In the older homes they have the dual knobs, so maybe they
accidentally turned off the cold water. The hot water would still come out and scald them, or
young kids who would turn on the hot water, you know, when they were in the bathtub if the
parents left ‘em. So, at 120 degrees, it takes about three minutes or so for that to happen. So,
you know, real proud of that, and then also made it mandatory that smoke alarms be installed
in all rental property and that it's up to the owner to ensure that, you know, the batteries are
replaced every year and etcetera. So, you know, branching it out into things like that, but that
in addition to just ensuring that, you know, the patients are, you know, properly, you know,
packaged before they're, you know, they're transferred to us made a huge difference. And,
you know, of course, a couple of other things, you know, working with the military, you
know. When we had both Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Iran-Iraq War and etcetera, you know,
burns was the second or third leading cause of trauma that they, you know-- When they
would hit the IEDs, their vehicles would get exploded. The passengers inside would get
knocked unconscious, so as the vehicle's burning, they would burn, so we had to do, you
know, crash courses in emergency burn care for military personnel as well. So, went all over
the country and actually to a couple of foreign countries to, you know, to treat, you know, to
give education about how to take care of, you know, and manage burns as well. So, it was a
very interesting job. Well, as I said, I went from staff nurse to what we wound up doing. As
the program grew, I became the director of the outreach program with some folks working
underneath me. But, one of the jobs that I really wanted and didn't get [laughs] was I wanted
to become, you know, a nurse manager for the Burn Center but was told, "Well, you're--"
First of all, it was, "You weren't qualified," but then-- but I had a master's, which met the
requirement, but what they really wanted, you know, would be told stuff like, "Well, you're
doing such a great job with, you know, with outreach, etcetera," you know, which was true. I
mean, I didn't have to worry about 24-hour accountability, you know, with staff and things of
that sort, but, you know, but I did want to get that little bit of executive leadership, you know,
under my belt, but I got it in other ways. So, yeah, I'm proud of what I was doing.
CH
What other positions have you held in nursing?
EG
That is it, other than, you know, like I said, with the educator position within the Burn Center,
but also just, you know, adjunct faculty at both UNC and UNC Greensboro School of
Nursing. So, you know, that's, you know, that was it.
afc2021009_005
CH
What trends do you see in nurse education today, and the direction of nursing as far as
education?
EG 17:32
Oh wow. Well, definitely I see it evolving more to where we're embracing more innovation
and technology. I, you know, definitely after the pandemic, we're realizing that the old model
of nursing is not working, you know. Some people were saying, “Well, we should go back to
team nursing and etcetera.” That may work with the shortage that we have right now, but it
isn't going to, you know-- We need to be able to embrace more technology that allow nurses
to be much more independent as they're, you know, providing care for their patients.
Definitely telehealth and telemedicine, you know, put us on that trajectory, but I still think
that more-- You know, right now we're at a place where, because of the electronic medical
record, you know, if we're not checking boxes then that means it's not done, so that's a ding
against us, which means we're spending more time checking boxes instead of being there to
provide care for the patient and/or their family or other things that we can do to improve
healthcare. So, we've got to figure out some way that, you know, the checking of the boxes is
not as important. Yes, I realize it's important, but it shouldn't be, you know, so important that
this is what the facility used and this is how we generate revenue is because you did check
that box. You're not gonna generate revenue because you were able to sit there and hold that
patient's hand while they were scared or going through a very scary procedure, which is what
I think we need to be able to do. The other thing I see and I've been trying to advocate for as
we're experiencing a workforce shortage right now is that nursing needs to be brought out
from under room and board. We need to be able to bill for what we bring to the table and not
be treated as a commodity. I blame that on nursing as a profession when, you know, during
the old days when we were still considered the handmaiden for the physician and to not
have-- You know, when you're told, "We don't have enough staff," you know, or whatever,
well, we'd suck it up and, you know, and then the next shift comes on and they call for
assistance and told, "We don't have enough staff, but what's the matter with you? The first
shift did their shift before you, you know, sucked it up and, you know, they made things do,”
you know. We're setting ourselves up for failure and we're setting, you know-- we're not
being able to provide the care that needs to be done. What happens as a result of that is when
there's a sentinel event, you know, then it's, you know, "Well, why didn't you press a little bit
harder?" or, "Why didn't you ask for a safe harbor?" or something like that, but then you're
made to-- you get those little subtle threats: "Well, you know, we may have to write you up
for this," or, you know, that type thing. So, because of that fear, I think we are finding our
own by saying, you know, saying stuff like, "Well, this is not a safe assignment,” or, “This is
not a safe environment," or using certain code words that is now getting the ear of the
administrators to realize that, "Okay, we need to put things in place to where there's enough
staff." I'm not necessarily keen on specific staff-nurse ratios, but we definitely need to have,
you know, something in place that there is enough staff to satisfy the needs of the unit. Not
only that, not just warm bodies, but experienced warm bodies, because you can have a new
nurse that’s six months fresh out of nursing school and in a lot of situations they're still
counted as, "Oh, yeah. Well, you're a nurse now," and it's like, no. You got to think of the
experience of the unit and the experience of that nurse and what may, you know, what may
constitute, you know, having enough, sufficient staff as opposed to just a warm body to, you
know, to do menial tasks.
CH
There is a shortage of nurse educators as well. What do you think would correct that?
afc2021009_005
EG 22:03
Oh, well, increase the salaries [laughs] for one thing, which is what we've been doing with
ANA. We've been advocating for Congress to put more monies into Title VIII funding that
specifically address nurse faculty shortage in training, you know. If the average age of a nurse
at the bedside is 50, in the mid-50s, you can imagine what it is for the faculty. So, we've got
to have funds for faculty development, you know, where they should not be punished, you
know, by choosing to become an educator, you know. It's really weird because the people
you're training are gonna make much more money than you are, probably on average about
15 to 20 thousand dollars more a year, but yet you gave them all this knowledge, you know. It
needs to be recognized or needs to be rewarded that, “Hey, you are, you know, worth your
weight in gold and we need to support you,” and not only with just the baccalaureate degree,
but to go ahead and get the master's and doctorate as well. Also, you know, with the
simulation labs and things like that, ‘cause you need facilities, you know, modernize a lot of
schools of nursing as well. There are some that are still very antiquated and etcetera. They
haven't, you know, embraced technology and such, and they need to if they're gonna survive.
As a result of that, that too is what's going to entice people to want to become educators is the
fact that, you know, they can embrace innovation and technology and really apply theory into
practice, so to speak, and help the crop of students that they are teaching make that easy
transition and not, you know, not feel so out there, so to speak, I guess.
CH
I heard you mention ANA, which stands for American Nurses Association. What is your
position with them?
EG
Well, I'm president of the American Nurses Association. Proud to say that I am the first male
to be elected president in the now 126th year of the history of the organization. That speaks
volume, but it also speaks volume that I'm also just the third African American or a person of
color to serve as president, which means that there's sort of a problem there, you know, for it
to be-- At the time that I was elected, ANA was in its 122 nd year, so it's weird that it would
take 122 years to break the glass ceiling, you know, in a obviously female-dominated, white
female-dominated profession, but we're making strides to try to correct that now as we
address a lot of issues concerning racism within the profession, but also within the ANA itself
for its past history of racism and discrimination, you know. We're on the path to issuing a
reconciliation statement. Hopefully, that'll be-- Well, it will be voted on in June at our
membership assembly, and that will really go very, very far for an organization like ANA
which represents, you know, the nation's 4.3 million registered nurses. For them to apologize
for their past behavior is very significant. The downside is, you know, they're doing it while
they have a, you know, person of color as president but, you know, to me, it needs to be done.
It doesn't matter, you know, about the skin color of the individual, but what we're planning is
that myself and our chief executive officer will both issue a, you know, a reconciliation
statement of apology, but within that, there will be some things that we’ll list that ANA will
do moving forward to ensure that this never happens again and be held accountable for that
and encourage nurses from all ethnicities to hold us accountable as we move forward. So, I'm
really looking forward to that.
CH
I know there is a project now within ANA to help to address racism in nursing. Can you?
afc2021009_005
EG 26:56
Yeah, it's called the Commission to Address Racism in Nursing, although ANA is one of the
co-leads, you know, and I want to specifically stress that, because when the ANA board
wanted to put this together, I knew that we would have difficulty bringing other minority
nursing organizations in if we just said this was an ANA-only project, because I can see them
saying, "Well, why should we help you?" you know, type thing. So, what I did was when
forming the Commission, as I was recruiting, we have the National Black Nurses
Association, who was one of the co-leads, we have the National Association of Ethnic and
Minority Nurses and then we have the Hispanic Nurses Association. So, the four of us are
serving as co-leads, but we all agreed that we would not move the agenda forward unless all
of us agreed at the, you know, the same time, which is great. Then, we brought in all the other
minority nursing organizations as well, which I'm proud to say that Chi Eta Phi is at the table
as well. There are a total of 36 nursing organizations that make up the Commission, but we
can't, you know, but to move forward, we have to leave it to, you know, the four co-leads.
We're making some great strides as we are doing that. We have done surveys. We've done
listening sessions, you know, really to get the idea. So, the whole idea is to recognize that,
yes, this is a problem. This is how we're gonna move forward with addressing this problem.
Hopefully, it will be as a model for other healthcare organizations to look at as well, but this
is addressing racism within the nursing profession itself. So, we are hoping to have our
documents put out on May 7th. Significant for May 7th is that is Mary Mahoney's birthday.
That is also during National Nurses Month. This is not just a one-year project; this is an
ongoing project. The whole idea is that we will address racism on four fronts from education,
because we feel that, you know, this is a taught behavior. It's, you know, you don't go into
nursing-- It's just like a newborn baby. They're not born prejudiced, and you don't go into
nursing being prejudiced, but it's what you're sort of taught or seen and read in textbooks, and
by that I mean if a textbook says, "Oh, this group of ethnic people, this is the way they
tolerate pain," or "they have a higher pain level," or "this is," you know, just making
stereotypes, but you learn that. Then, when you're in clinical practice, you begin to believe
that as well. So, like when a person of color, say, who has sickle cell and they're in a crisis
and they're saying they're in pain, but you go, "Well, wait a minute. My textbook says you
should be tolerating a lot of pain, so I think, you know, and the fact that you're not grimacing
or doubling over, like what we see in, you know, other populations or Caucasian friends, then
I'm not gonna believe that you're in pain," you know, but they don't realize that, “Well, I've
had sickle cell for so long that, you know, I, you know, there's different ways that I express
that I, you know, I'm having pain." So, education is one area. The other area is clinical
practice, because, again, what you learn, you take into clinical practice, and now you have the
influence of your colleagues as well. So, when a Black man comes into the emergency room
with a rule out MI and a white man comes in at the same time, the white man’s gonna get a
full workup, probably be admitted, probably go get a stent. The Black man is gonna be sent
home, told to take Tylenol, and he's gonna come back four hours later in full arrest, you
know. So, and because some of our colleagues may think, “Oh, well, he's from this zip code,”
or, “He's a frequent flyer into the emergency room,” we don't pay that much attention, and so
we've got to stop perpetuating that in the clinical practice. So, we will set examples like that.
Then research, you know. We don't have enough research on, you know, as far as involving
minorities, you know, the way we should within nursing. So, you know, emphasizing it from
that perspective and getting nurses of color to do a lot more research as well. Then advocacy,
also, when we are looking at, you know, from a perspective of either scholarships or grants or
even just promotion, you know. Like, one of the things that I've told nurse administrators you
need to do is, you know, select, you know, maybe six or 12 minority nurses that you're gonna
mentor, you know, because you want to be thinking about secession planning, but you also
afc2021009_005
want to get those individuals into leadership positions and, you know, take them under your
wings, and, you know, invite them to your board meetings, you know. Have them sitting on
the side, but then after the board meeting, talk about what happened. Ask them, “How would
you address this particular issue?” or something like that, or send them out for leadership
courses and etcetera, because when they see that you're making this investment into them,
you're gonna have loyalty there, as opposed to if they don't see that you're doing things to
encourage their leadership abilities and etcetera, they're gonna go somewhere else where, you
know, they will get it, you know, and when it's time for leadership positions to open up,
you've groomed people who know your organization very well and etcetera., just simply slide
right into those roles. But, if you just sit there and, you know, not do anything, then that's
going to create quite a conundrum, or it sends a huge message to that individual that, you
know, “We don't want you except to just do manual labor, you know, to take care of, you
know, take care of the patients, instead of being groomed for leadership positions.” So, it
really says a lot.
CH
What is the expectation from this project, as far as in the clinical practice, of having more
inclusion and to really address and to face that racism exists, that we have this problem?
EG
So in education, what we're hoping is that it will change the way textbooks are written and
also change the NCLEX exam, because the way the NCLEX exam is done now too is they
will give you certain scenarios and they may say, you know, “Knowing that so and so is a
person of color, you know, da da da da da,” like I was saying, “We know that this is the way
they experience pain,” or, you know, etcetera. So, it will erase all that. You want to see the
person for who they are, not just because they fit into this peg hole or, you know, because,
you know, different people, you know, even myself and my brothers, you know, you can say
you’re raised the same but we view things differently, you know, and you really can't think
that you are designing care or, you know, for me, based on my experience or what you may
hear from my brother. You got to ask me, you know, what it is that you want to do, as
opposed to, you know, just thinking, “Well, I know he's from the mountains of North
Carolina,” and, you know, making these assumptions. So, you’ve gotta be inclusive, you
know, with that. In the clinical area, what we're pushing is allyship. In other words, we've got
to get our white nurse colleagues to call out, you know, racism when they see it and to, you
know, say, “No, we're not gonna do this. We're gonna stop this now,” or, “Why are you
treating this person differently from, you know, from this person when they both are, you
know, deserve the same level of care?” you know. So, you've got to first of all, get people to
recognize their own biases, be they conscious or unconscious. Once they begin to recognize
that, then begin to say, “We need to change,” you know, because they do begin to see and
experience that, yes, we do treat people differently. It's not just, you know, it's not just Black
people. It's people of color all across the whole spectrum. That's the other thing we've tried to
get them to understand, that when we talk about racism, usually what pops into people's mind
all the time is it's a Black and white thing, but it's not. It's a Black and Hispanic thing. It’s a
Black, Hispanic, and maybe Asian thing, or it’s a Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native
American thing, or all ethnicities, you know. This past week, I was giving a talk in Portland,
Oregon and talking about the Commission on Racism and this lady, she's from Iran, she got
up to the mic at the question and answer period and she says, you know, “I'm so happy you're
doing this work, because I'm tired of being an ‘other’”. I said, “What do you mean by
‘other’?” She says, “Well, when you look at forms that says, ‘What is your race or ethnicity?’
or whatever, you don't see Iranian-American there and I have to check ‘other’ because I'm not
afc2021009_005
white. I'm not, you know, I'm not listed as, you know, I'm not Black. I'm not Hispanic. I'm not
Native American. So, I'm an ‘other’ and, you know, so I see this work as giving me a
personality or, you know, a presence.” So, it's the same way in that we need to be able to get
nursing to embrace people for their otherness and, you know, not just automatically assume,
“Oh, you're a Black male,” you know. When people see me, think, “You're a six-foot-six
Black male, so chances are you've got hypertension, you've got diabetes, you got, you know,
all this,” and they know nothing about me, you know, but yet, they're gonna quickly make
those assumptions and, you know, and nine times out of 10, they're gonna be wrong. So, that's
how that's going to be, you know, the whole thing that we'll be addressing this is to get our
white colleagues to be allies with us and to call it out when they see it. If it's called out
enough, you know, we'll begin to see that it will stop. Also, changing the work environment
as well, you know. If an employer says, “We have a zero tolerance policy towards, you know,
racism and things like this,” then you gotta let nurses know that you're backing that, you
know. Like, if I am taking care of a patient but I’m called the N word, or a patient will, you
know, we've all had them sort of work around by saying, “Is there somebody else that could,
you know, could do this?” or whatever, then, you know, I need to know that my employer is
going to back me when I say, “No, there isn't,” or, “I am your nurse today, and if you have a
problem with that, let's, you know, let's deal with it.” But, you know, but to, you know, really
perpetuate racism in that manner, what that says to me as a nurse is that, “Okay. You don't
care about me as much as you care about this, you know, this person who is, you know, that
I'm caring for or assigned to care for, but you want me-- you're making money because of the
care that I'm giving and what I bring to the table. You're not recognizing the work that I'm
bringing to the table.” Yeah, we can have that discussion about why this person may not want
a person of color to provide care for them, but I think you should also send the message to
them that, you know, in this institution we don't discriminate, you know, and, you know, and
that way, I know that you have my back.
CH
What has been your experience as a male nurse, and have you had any challenges or
experienced stereotyping because you're a male nurse?
EG 39:43
Oh, yeah [chuckles]. Well, I think probably my very first experience, and it's something that I
always tell men who are in nursing, is, of course, I grew up and went into nursing when there
was still the use of the word “orderly,” you know, the male nursing assistant who would do
jobs that the female nurses did not want to do, you know, like, shave a male patient or give a
male patient a bath or put a Foley in a male patient and etcetera. So, some of the best advice I
got when I was a student and also when I graduated, both from my LPN program and from
the RN program, was, “Don't let yourself be used as an orderly,” you know, and I would--
One of the ways that I quickly put an end to that would be to, you know, like if some of my
female colleagues would say, “Can you help us lift this patient into the chair?” You know, of
course, nowadays, we have to use, you know, lift equipment, but back then, it would take
three or four of us who would, you know, do a drop lift of a patient or use a blanket or
something like that to, you know, to help lift them from the bed to the chair or to stand and
pivot and put them there, you know, but sometimes I would say to them, you know, “Well, I
don't mind helping you, but tell me, what would you do if I wasn't here today? How would
you get this person into a chair?” or, “How would you put a Foley in that patient?” or, you
know, things of that sort. So, you know, and I would say, you know, “Didn't we take the same
licensure exam?” and they’d say, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, you know how to do
this just as well as I do, right?” After a while, they’d get the, you know, they’d get the
afc2021009_005
message that, you know. And again, I don't mind helping as, you know, as part of the team
work, but I shouldn't be assigned this patient just because he's a male or he's a heavy male or
he's a male of color, you know, that you don't want to, you know, to care for, you know, so I
would quickly do that and, you know, that brought an end to that. Course, a couple of other
stereotypes is that, of course, they, you know, they want to call you “doctor” and I’d quickly
correct them and say, “I'm better than a doctor. I’m a nurse,” you know. And one would say,
you know, “Well, how soon before you go to med school?” or something like that, and then
you'd have to really, you know, educate them or whatever. Then, of course, there's always the,
you know, the question about your sexual orientation, you know, and I would say, you know,
“My sexual orientation has absolutely nothing to do with the care that I'm here to provide for
you. So, whether I’m straight, you know, gay, bi or, you know, whatever, you know, the
whole list may go, I see you for who you are. You should see me for who I am, because that
has absolutely nothing to do with the care that, you know, that I'm going to, you know, to give
to you.” So, you know, and I always generally tell people that I, you know, leave my personal
life to me because it has nothing to do with the care that I'm going to provide, you know, and,
you know, that pretty well will do it most of the time, but-- You know, just setting, you know,
setting the record straight for people and letting them know, you know, what their limits are
as far as, you know, what they can ask, can't ask or, you know, or say, you know, and what
you will tolerate and, you know, and doing it in a professional manner, not, you know, not to
belittle them or whatever else, but there's lots of ways that you can just simply say, “Well, I'm
glad that you're interested in what you think may be my sexuality, but tell me, how does that
affect how, you know, the care that I'm going to provide for you today?” For a lot of us, like,
and that’s it.
CH
No answer for that.
EG
Yeah, no answer for that, and it shouldn't be. It shouldn’t, you know-- Even our code of
conduct for nurses, you know, we're taught to respect the person regardless of all the
identifiers that you can think of, you know: age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, you
know. The list goes on and on and on. Any identifier, you know, we're expected to provide
care for that person no matter what. The way I would expect the, you know, the patient that
I’m caring for and/or their family members as well to care for is the same thing, is to respect
me for what I am able to bring to the table to provide care for your loved one, you know. So,
it shouldn't matter that, you know, what I do outside of, you know, outside of the work
environment, because that's my business. It's not yours, and it shouldn't influence how I'm
going to provide care for you or your family member today.
CH
Do you feel that it's easier for male nurses to get positions in management and
administration?
EG 44:51
Yeah, absolutely. Actually, you know, I read an article and after I thought about it I agreed
with it, you know, but it took me a while. But what I see is, if it wasn't for men moving into
managerial positions or leadership positions within the profession, nurses would not be
making as good of a living, you know, monetary-wise, as we do now. It's a shame that it's,
you know, it takes that or, you know, whatever, but I think men are-- We're more apt to take
chances by-- What's the old saying? I had this conversation with somebody last week and the
afc2021009_005
words that I used was, if you're not qualified, then you fake it ‘til you make it, you know, type
thing, because a lot of women would sit back and say, you know. They'd look at the job
description and they'll say, “Well, I don't have this. I don't have that so, you know, I'm not
going to apply for it,” but a man will look at it and go, “Hmm, that's an interesting job. Yeah,
I think I will apply for it.” And, you know, and it all depends on how well they may
interview, you know. They could always say to someone, “Well, I don't have this, but I, you
know, I have this,” or, “I promise if I get the position, I'm going to, you know, work on, you
know, getting that degree,” or whatever that you think that, you know, that is needed for this
particular position, as opposed to, as I said, a female who may not be as adventuresome and
may just think, “Well, I'm going to wait ‘til I feel more qualified or whatever and do that.”
But, I think historically, if you look from a male nurse who just graduated nursing school,
probably within a year and a half to two years, they're moving up on the ladder, either from a
staff nurse to maybe a charge nurse to maybe an assistant nurse manager, or they're moving
into something that's going to make them a little bit more visible within the organization. It
may not necessarily be a leadership position at first, but it may be that they're doing
something, or maybe I'm moving from a staff nurse to maybe working in the emergency
room, or maybe working in the aeromedical division, you know. I want to be a flight nurse or
something like that, you know. So, they're gonna quickly do that, whereas a female who
maybe wants to be a flight nurse as well is probably gonna go, “Well, I think I need to get a
good five years’ experience in the ED and, you know, do all that.” So, they're not gonna be-- I
don't want to say, risk takers, but a man's probably gonna see that more as a challenge, and
chances are he's gonna want to go towards that challenge.
CH
Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated.
EG
Yes.
CH
What chapter and region are you in?
EG 47:47
I am in Pi chapter and we are in the Southeast region. Interesting story about how I got
involved into Chi Eta Phi from a couple of perspectives. One, I had mentioned that I started
my nursing career out as a LPN. Part of how I became an LPN was that I got a Chi Eta Phi
scholarship from the chapter in Asheville, North Carolina to help pay my tuition for that. So,
I guess you could say that if it wasn't for Chi Eta Phi, I wouldn't be in the position that I'm in
today. So, a little known fact, but yes, I did. I got a $500 scholarship to, you know, for that.
Then, when I got into the Pi chapter, where was I? Oh, I had the opportunity-- I flew to
Atlanta, Georgia for a meeting that Coretta Scott King was there and so was the Supreme.
What was her name? [laughs] I forget. But anyway, she had mentioned to me about, you
know, Chi Eta Phi and I said, “Yeah, you know, I've been trying to get into Chi Eta Phi
locally but I don't know of anyone who was, you know, who was a member.” She said, “Don't
worry. I'll take care of that.” Next thing I knew, probably about a week later, I get a phone
call from the Basileus of Pi chapter and she says, “I hear you are trying to-- you're interested
in Chi Eta Phi,” and I said, “Yes, I am.” She goes, “Well, it just so happens we will be having
a, you know, intake, you know, interest in whatever else and, you know, please, you know,
consider.” So, she gave me that information and etcetera and I did and you had just
mentioned that you had spoken to Frater Riley. So, he and I actually were in the same class
afc2021009_005
and went through and have been active ever since. So, I know one of the things I've enjoyed
about my time in Chi Eta Phi, not only the fellowship that you have, you know. I wish I could
do more, but being in this national position, you know, I have very little available time, but
one project that we have that I thoroughly enjoy, we've adopted a elementary school in
Durham and they go in and help the kids. Well, one, we do fundraisers, you know, so we'll,
you know, provide funding for them so that the school can have money if a child needs
notebook paper, or, you know, things like that. We provide, you know, some clothing, you
know, like, if we find out that there's a kid that needs a coat, or, you know, something like
that, but for the most part, we'll go in and help with reading and, you know, maybe if a child
needs to, you know, have some extra time to, you know, catch up on their reading skills or
their writing skills, you know, helping with that, you know. But the thing is is that you're
planting that seed, because that kid realizes, “Hey, that's a nurse.” Not only that but, “That's a
nurse of color,” or, “That's a male nurse of color,” you know. So, they may consider, you
know, nursing as a career as they see that, you know, you're able to build those relationships.
So, little things like that. And of course, well, prior to COVID, we used to do, you know,
community health fairs as well, or participate in the community health fair that would be held
in Durham. So, you get to, you know, talk to people about their medications or the
importance of, you know, doing cancer screening and, you know, stuff like that. So, it's been
a real joy to, you know, to be a member of the Pi chapter and Chi Eta Phi itself.
CH
Have you held any offices or have you been in any--
EG
Yes, yeah. Actually, I am chair of the Bylaws Committee, you know, and actually that’s--
CH
Is it on the local level?
EG
Yeah, on the local level, you know, but I've been asked to serve on other committees. Again,
because of my work with ANA, it just doesn't, you know, doesn't permit that. I'm pretty sure,
[chuckles] ‘cause I know Frater Riley is probably-- well, I know, he's tired of, you know, he's
held the Basileus position for a number of years now and I’m sure that probably when I finish
my term as ANA president, they're probably going to come knocking and saying, “Okay, it's
time for you to, you know, consider running for Basileus or one of the other--"
CH
And the Basileus is the…?
EG
Is the President. Yeah, chapter president.
CH
Any offices on the regional or national?
EG
No, I haven't been able to do that, again because of my, you know-- My position with ANA,
it is-- Well, as we talked about, it's a full-time paid position which involves a lot of travel and
it also means that my schedule could change at any moment and, you know, or travel could
afc2021009_005
change at any moment. Plus my, you know, when you assume this position, it is with the
assumption that you're not going to, you know, have any other positions that may run counter
to that, and so you have to keep yourself freed up at all times.
CH
Do you feel Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in service for humanity?
EG 53:49
Oh, absolutely. Well, the example that I just gave, you know, not only as we do that within
that school that we have adopted, but then also, you know, like, at Christmastime and
Thanksgiving or whatever, we adopt, you know, some families and provide, you know, gifts
and things like that for them, hosting the-- or, participating in the health screenings and stuff
like that, that makes a huge difference, you know. Being seen out in the community, you
know, of course, obviously, North Carolina Central is pretty much our home nursing, you
know, program so, you know, being involved with those students that are in that as well, it
does make a difference. And, of course, we participated in, like, when there's the vaccination
clinics, you know, we participated in those as well. So, again, getting the word out and doing
programs for-- even within our own individual churches and, you know, or faith
communities. Getting them to see that, again, you're a nurse, you're a member of Chi Eta Phi
and, you know, maybe getting them to, you know, the church to have, like, a Safety Sabbath
or a Healthy Sabbath, you know. Participating in, you know, helping to organize that makes a
difference as well.
CH
How has COVID-19 impacted the nursing profession?
EG
Oh, God, in so many ways [chuckles]. Well, one, let's talk about the negative stuff first and
then we'll talk about the positive things. The negative is that, obviously, it challenged us in so
many different ways because we literally had to spin on a dime to, you know, when the
country shut down, to talk about, “Okay, what are the resources that we need to provide care
for these patients?” Not only do we need the PPEs but we need the education in how do you,
you know, how do you don the masks, gloves, you know, gowns, things of this sort, but then
also, how do you care for a COVID-19 patient, because at the time, in the early days, we
didn't know fully how the virus was transmitted and things of this sort, so lots of educational
needs that were put there. Nurses, you know, answering the call that we always do, you know,
we've always been there for our communities, but this time the community really put in a
huge call to, you know, “Come help us.” So, nurses frequently worked overtime, you know,
and just to endure this battle of seeing death in such high numbers as well. I mean, yeah,
we're used to seeing death, but we're not used to seeing, you know, 10, 12, you know, people
die a shift. And, you know, you don't get the opportunity to process what you just saw,
because you got to hurry up and get that patient out of the bed because there's three patients
waiting in the ER to, you know, to occupy that bed, and etcetera. And just, you know, being
able to rally to that cause is one thing. Obviously, a lot of mental and physical health fatigue.
I'm still worried about our nurse colleagues because we're resilient but we're also in denial,
you know. There's a number of nurses who just, you know, they're like, “Well, don't worry
about my mental health,” or whatever, or the stigma that's associated with seeking mental
health and behavioral healthcare. We've got to put it in a form to where there should not be a
stigma associated with the fact that you need help or you need mental health, and it shouldn't
be a mark against your licensure or your insurance that, you know, that this has happened, but
afc2021009_005
it is, or it’s perceived by a lot of nurses that way. But I am very, very proud of nurses who
were on the front line, you know, day in and day out and still are, you know, taking care of
COVID patients. I guess the good thing that COVID did was, one, it did shine the light. The
public has a better understanding of who we are as nurses and what we do. Even though,
well, now for the 20 consecutive years in a row, we've always been viewed as the most
trusted profession, but I think now if you ask, you know, a colleague-- Previously, if you
asked them, you know, “What it is that your neighbor who's a nurse does?” they would
probably say, “Well, I don't know, but they work at the local hospital or they do this,” but
now they can say, “Oh, I know what they do,” because of, you know, the exposure that they
have. We're not just in acute care facilities, that we are in public health, that we are in
long-term care, that, you know, we are members of the community, and what happens in the
community not only affects us but it also affects, you know, the other people within our
community. So, we have that different view. I think it has also allowed nursing to find its
voice, as we are speaking up now and demanding, you know, higher pay, you know,
demanding that we feel valued. And by that, you know, the days of the pizza party, the donut,
the coffee or whatever, that's out the window, you know. Getting administration or people in
the C-suite to actually listen to you and to hear you say, “This is what I value,” you know.
That means, obviously for different nurses it’s gonna be different things, but that means not
only higher pay but it also means, you know, having a safe work environment. It means not
feeling bullied or not being, you know, harassed by patients or patients’ family members or
being hit and you not doing anything about it. That you need to be able to, you know, to do
that. Working out, you know, if some benefit package of, you know, student loan forgiveness
or whatever or some other things or, you know, not making me feel pressured into coming in
and working yet another day, you know. This is day number six without a day off, you know.
Not making me feel guilty because I need my own mental health time, you know. Those are
some, you know, some things that I'm hearing from nurses. There's a lot more as well but,
you know, and not having a large patient assignment, you know. Having an assignment that's
manageable, that, you know, that I can feel that I'm making a difference, as opposed to
working short-staffed. That just isn't the thing you want to do.
CH
What advice would you give to males considering becoming a nurse?
EG 1:01:13
My advice would be to go for it, you know. I've been a nurse now, what-- well, since ’77, so
it's about 45 years. I have never ever regretted choosing nursing as a profession. I would
advise them to do it and to, you know, go as far as you can, you know. Not only get your
either associate or bachelor's degree, but master’s and doctorate. If you want to go on to
become an advanced practice nurse, then, you know, do that. Ensure that you have a mentor
both inside and out of nursing, you know. It doesn't have to be another male that's in nursing,
but I would definitely-- By having a mentor, you're gonna have within nursing, you have
somebody who's walked in your shoes and could, you know, so when you're talking about,
you know, this happened today or that happened today or whatever, you're able to, you know,
you got somebody who can identify and can give you some piece of advice. It's good also to
have somebody outside of nursing so that you can use them as a sounding board also, that can
perhaps provide you some wisdom about, “Well, have you thought about it from this
perspective or that?” you know, from the outside looking in, because a lot of times being on
the inside and having a mentor or someone that's in there, we're seeing the same picture and
we need to be able to look from the outside to look in and see what other perspectives, you
know, other people may see which may cause you to think a little bit differently. That would
afc2021009_005
be the advice that I would give them is to, you know, go for it and, you know, and soak it up.
Then, once they've completed nursing school, realize too, they need to pay it forward, you
know. That you have a responsibility to reach back and help those who are, you know, who
are coming behind you and make the path a little bit easier for them
CH
That’s wonderful, wonderful, wonderful advice. Finally, what are your thoughts on our
beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated, and words of wisdom towards service for
humanity?
EG
I think my final thoughts would be, Chi Eta Phi needs to be more visible. We need to make a
very true concerted effort to, you know, to get our message out there and to recruit more, you
know, more people within the organization, you know. I don't know how to go about doing
that other than, you know, just each chapter just maybe setting a goal: We're going to, you
know, increase our, you know, our chapter numbers by 10 or 15 or 20 for this year and then
the same for next year, you know, to see that growth, you know. But, I mean, our voice is
there but, you know, we could be just as strong as National Black Nurses Association or even
as strong as ANA, you know. Like, one of the things that I had told Martha Dawson with
NBNA when, you know, we were making the overtures about forming the Commission and
etcetera, you know, I made it clear, you know, “We're not wanting to, you know, to poach
your members, because the majority of your members, they’re our members anyway, you
know. We see that, you know, but what are some of the things that we can collaborate on and
maybe with Chi Eta Phi as well within NBNA, because I know a lot of my local chapter
members are members of NBNA as well.” So, we need to get those other members within
NBNA who are not Chi Eta Phi members, you know, to join. I don't know if that's maybe
offering a one-time, you know, special, you know, membership special rate or whatever, you
know, because, I mean, if you're like me, I'm a member of about seven nursing organizations,
so the money does, yeah, it does become very costly. So, maybe that's, you know, that's
something to think about. As far as what the service to humanity portion, yeah, I think as we
get more and more exposure, you know, and we need to toot our own horn about what we do,
you know, in the form of service to humanity and not just keep it to ourselves or pat ourselves
on the back but, you know, get that publicity out there as well. When you're doing an event or
something like that, yeah, we may get the local, you know, newspaper, you know, but then
call up the local TV station or, you know, or some of the other social media things. We need
to have a presence on social media that meets today's challenges and needs. I think that's one
thing too. In order to get young people, who typically are not joiners, but in order to get, you
know, the young people to join now, we gotta use innovation and technology that they use
today that would make them want to become joiners. Otherwise, I don't know what the
average age is of our members, you know, across the country, but I'm sure it's probably, like,
what the average age of, you know, for nurses within ANA. We're a good thing, but we got to
let the secret out instead of keeping it amongst ourselves. We gotta let that secret out and
maybe even, you know, open it up to, you know, to other nurses. I know that our reputation is
that, you know, it is a sorority, you know, for Black nurses but, you know, I don't know. I've
seen some chapters where they may have white members. They may have, you know, but the
message that's being sent, though, is that because of our historical, you know, presence, that,
you know, there is a wall, and maybe we need to let people know that, “No, there is not a
