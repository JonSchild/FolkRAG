THE 
VELOCIPEDE BELLE 
SONGSTER. 
The Velocipede Belle. 
Oh, I'm so fond of riding, 
I 
can never, never stop ! 
When Velocipedes are gliding 
What care I 
for ball and hop ? 
Such amusements as the round-dance, 
Are very dull indeed, 
Compared to the swift motion 
Of the gay Velocipede! 
Citonus—Oh, Pm that fond of whirling 
Through the Park with lightning speed, 
Dashing, flashing, flying, whirling 
On my gay Velocipede. 
In the lancers I 
am perfect, 
The mazurka is my forte, 
As a 
partner in the German 
My hand is always sought; 
But I've given up -dancing lately, 
It is very stale, indeal ; 
The girls are wild with envy 
Of my gay Velocipctle. 
(CnoRts.) 
Oh, I 
can't express the pleasure 
Of a 
race around " the mall," 
With a 
dozen of my lovers, 
For I'm sure to heat them all; 
I've an offer every day now, 
But offers I 
don't heed, 
I've no time to think of froussecats-
With my gay -Velocipede 1 (Cnartts.) 
But I 
think I'll make an offer, 
When my beaux are all around: 
lie shall love me who can catch me 
Flying o'er three miles of ground t 
And the true test of my /over 
Shall a 
trial be of speed 
shallhare me who can win me 
On my gay Velocipede! 
It is Not So ! 
(Cnonrs.) 
'Tis said that absence day by day 
Makes love grow cold and colder yet, 
Until the feeling fades away, 
Nor leaves at last one fond regret. 
I 
can not tell,. when friends may part, 
What change the tickle few may know ; 
For me I 
can say from my heart, 
It is not so I It is not so I 
What though some few may faithless prove, 
It is. a 
blessed thing to know, 
With all that's worthy of our love, 
It is not so t , It is not so !

My Bosom Friend. 
AS SUNG BY WILLIAM H . 
LINGARD. 
Copied by permission of Wm. A . 
POND at Co., Music Publishers, 
547 Broadway, New York, owners- of the copyright. 
I 
had a 
bosom friend, whose name, 
Like mine, was Tommy Brown; 
We both at once loved Sarah Jones, 
The finest girl in town. 
But slyly I 
the question popped, 
Saying, " Tommy Brown wilt wed 
The license if my friend would get 
She'd be married to me, she said. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, on the twenty-fifth of May, 
Oh, dear, I 
felt so gay, 
Oh, my heart is palpitating 
While the kindness I'm relating, 
Of Tommy Brown, my bosom friend. 
Now I 
thought that t'other Tommy Brown 
Would be, without a 
doubt, 
Annoyed, because with Sarah Jones, 
I'd slyly cut him out. 
But no, he said he'd be best man, 
And firmly my hand shook, 
And to make the little arrangements 
For my wedding undertook. 
Ile got the license for me, 
And bespoke the coaches, too, 
The wedding-breakfast ordered, 
And invited all I 
knew ; 
And as my business kept me from 
My Sarah, late at eve, 
(Cliones.) 
15rfa, 
7zIe kindly shopping with her went— 
Such friendship, who'd believe. (Clio.) 
When the morning came I 
could not rest, 
I 
feared to be too late, 
By eleven I'd to be at church, 
But was up and dressed by eight. 
A coach my friend Tom went to fetch, 
But eleven came and passed, 
Still Tom did not return, therefore 
I 
ran to church at last. 
(CHORUS.) 
I, warm and dusty, reached the church, 
And looked for Sarah, when, lo 
The parson said she married was, 
At least one hour ago. 
I 
ran from church to Sarah's house, 
But found she'd just left town, 
Having with the license married 
My namesake, Tommy Brown. (Clio.) 
What's in a 
namo ? I've somewhere read, 
Well, this much let me say, 
I 
know that for my name •
Of Brown 
I'd many Browns to pay. 
So, young men, when engaged to wed, 
Upon yourselves depend, 
Nor leave your little arrangements 
To any bosom friend. 
CHORUS. 
Or on the twenty-fifth of May, 
You'll dearly have to pay, 
For if you timidly fiddle faddle, 
Your loving bride will skedaddle 
With some obliging bosom friend.

The Bashful Young Gentleman, 
They say I 
shall get over it 
But no, I 
never can! 
You've no conception what it 15 
To be a 
bashful man ;-
I—I, oh dear I 
quite forget 
What I 
was going to say— 
But—would the ladies be so good 
As look another way ? 
I'd give—I 
don't know what I'd not, 
If it were not the case, 
But it's a 
fact, I 
can not look 
A lady in the face. 
I'd rather face, I 
would indeed,. 
I 
know I 
am a 
fool, 
I'd rather face a 
crocodile, 
Than meet a 
ladies' school, 
At parties, when, like other men, 
I'm asked if I 
won't dance, 
I 
blush, and fidget with my gloves,. 
And wish myself in France ; 
And while I'm standing stammering,. 
And hanging down my head, 
Some sandy-whiskered coxcomb lead
The lady out instead. 
I 
did just touch a 
lady's hand, 
Last night, in a 
quadrille, 
Oh ! goodness, how my heart did beat 
It's palpitating still. 
While my young brother, fresh from school— 
To show you how I'm teased— 
Said, " Frank, why what a 
muff you are 
Girls like their fingers squeezed." 
ROW afl I 
to get married ? 
I 
shall never have a 
wife, 
I 
could never make an offer, 
I'm convinced, to save my life. 
There's the " quizzing" by the sisters, 
And the " questions 
by mamma ; 
And the" pumping" that one goes through 
In the study, by papa: 
Thun, there's that horrid honeymoon, 
The journey with a 
bride, 
And grinning post-boys looking back, 
And no one else inside. 
Oh my I 
the very thought of it 
Quite takes away my breath ; 
I'm certain ; at the wedding, 
I

Gentle Morn. 
Stay, gentle morn, awhile, 
Thy odors let me breathe 
ileaven seems above to smile, 
'Tis Paradise beneath. 
Flowers, freshly gemmed with dew, 
In tears entreat thy stay, 
And birds of every hue 
Sing, Why so soon away ? 
Then, gentle morn, awhile) etc, 
Thy rose- hues, lovely morn, 
Yet linger on the lake ; 
Then why, as soon as born, 
Wilt thou the world forsake? 
Then, gentle morn, awhile, etc.

Oh ! I'Ve been so sad for a 
very long time, 
I 
thong,ht I'd lost that girl of mine, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been twinning, 
oh, yes, throw-

To her ' twas a

But she's coming out in the mornimg. 
cnonts. 
Oh I 
shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home 
When Sally comes home, when Sally comes home I 
Shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home 
For she's coming out in the morning 
Now Sally she is a 
young feminine fair, 
She was to me beyond compare, 
I 
much admired her carroty hair, 
For she scorns the use of a 
chignon,' 
Her father sold baked taters in a 
tin can, 
ITer brother he was a 
fat six-foot pliceman, 
Her mother worked hard at the tub, pail and pan, 
And gained every one's good opinion. (Clio) 
Now Sally she was her mamma's fondest pet, 
But, unluckily, one day sle ant 
A friend of hers, called " light-fingered Bet," 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
They walked in it large draper's shop one fine day 
To buy some smart ribbons and flowers so gay, 
When Sally was seen walking quickly away 
With twenty-four yards of white sheeting. (Clio.) 
The shopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called a 
bobby then standing by, 
Though Sarah she for mercy did cry, 
Ile soon walked her off to the station. 
They took her before the Judge on that day, 
A most shocking had case it was, he did say, 
So, for six long months he sent Sally away, 
To Le boarded and lodged by the nation. (
Cup.) 
But courage and strength I'll endeavor to show, 
And set aside all signs of woe, 
From gaol to church we quickly will go, 
When they let her go out in the morning. 
And when charming Salty becomes my dear wife, 
We'll soon put an end to all trouble and strife, 
And, happily leading a 
good honest life, 
We'll set an example and warning. (Cilo.) 
Do ye Mind the Auld Past Years ? 
Do ye mind time fluid past years, 
When we baith were young thegither, 
When we shard our smiles an' tears, 
Loosome hopes and scaursome fears, 
As we pluckt the purple heather 
Frae the mountain side ?

you were but a 
callant, Ben, 
An' I 
was just a 
lassie then, 
An' thoeht to be your bride. 
Sure the simmer was main licht, - 
An' the early fib w'rs were rarer, 
An' the stars they shone main bricht 
When the gloaming turn'd to nicht, 
An' WC With were young an' fairer, 
An' went side by side. (Cllonus.)

I'm a

Oh, pray don't! or I

If anybody looks at me. 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake! 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing! 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet 
Make me ninny- ninny-ninny—nervous, 
And I 
never walk the street 
Without saying, " Heaven preserve us!" 
How they stare! I 
declare 
I 
at once get red as any peony, 
Look so meek, that they speak, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
If I 
only had a 
friend, 
Like a 
bibby-bibby-bibby----brother, 
Telling me my faults to mend, 
And this silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man 
Who believes in love that is platonical, 
I 
might get courage yet : 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing.

The Velocipede Beau. 
Am— The Plying Trapeze. 
Once I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn, 
Betrayed by a 
girl in her ' teens 
The girl that I 
loved she was handsome, 
I 
tried my true love for to plead, 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well 
As that man on the Velocipede. 
cm,mus. 
He'd fly through the streets with the wildest aspeed, 
A daring young man on the Velocipede, 
His movements were graceful, all.girls he could please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man, I 
know, was a 
clerk in a 
store, 
He never had ridden a 
real steed before; 
Where'er he appeared the streets rung with a 
roar 
Of ovation from all people there ; 
He smiled from his scat on the people around, 
And one day he smiled on my love, 
She winked back at him and she shouted " Bravo I" 
As he flew like a 
carrier-dove. (Cnon-
t;s.) 
One day I 
as usual went up to the Park, 
To see that young man , n 
the wing, like a 
lark ; 
I 
looked for my love, and nearly went stark 
Mad, to hear that ,she had run away 
She'd put on her things and eloped in the night 
With hint with the greatest of speed, 
No use for her father to seek to pursue, 
For they'd gone on his -Velocipede! (CnORCS.) 
Some days after this, as .I 
walked on the mall, 
I 
was greatly surprised to see something tall— 
A 
girl in red pannier, which did my heart gall, 
For she was appearing with him! 
Ile ! aught her gymnastics, and dressed her in turks, 
Is proud of her marvelous peed, 
And now she can beat all the masculine world 
As she goes on her Velocipede, 
criORUS: 
She'll float through the air with the wildeSt of speed, 
A daring young girl on the Velocipede, 
Her movements are graceful, all men she can pleaSe, 
And that's what's become of my love! 
The Minstrel and the Song. 
Amid the city's busy throng 
I 
heard the minstrel sing his lay ; 
But few would listen to his song, 
The world, neglectful, turned away; 
The music floated from the crowd 
And mingled with the upper air; 
traced its measure, deep, not loud, 
And heard it melting sweetly there, 
saw the minstrel turn away, 
But More in sorrow than disdain ; 
Too oft it was his lot to play 
The music that he loved in vain. 
thus that all that pleasure gives 
Must know neglect, must suffer wrong ; 
The poet in the future lives, 
The minstrel dies, but not the song.

Beautiful hells ! oh, beautiful bells, 
Ringing so sweetly again and again, 
Welcomes of joy and weary farewells, 
Chiming in sunlight and rain ; 
Long ago, long ago, so dear unto mc4 
Oh, hattpy and pure was the message you bore, 
Loud o'er the vale and soft o'er the sea, 
Oh, could I 
but hear you once more. 
CHORUS—Beautiful bells ! oh, beautiful bells, 
Ringing so sweetly again and again, 
Welcomes of joy and weary farewells, 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful bells. 
Voice of the morn, and voice of the night, 
Waken, oh, waken the memories of old, 
Ring to my heart your dreaths of delight, 
Visions of beauty Untold ; 
Beautiful bells, or merry or sad, 
Telling your message of goodness to all, 
Whisper of moments hopeful and glad 
Vanished beyond our recall, (Cuonus.) 
The Thorn. 
From the white-blossom'd sloe my dear Chloe requested 
A sprig, her fair breast to adorn; 
No, by heavens! I 
exclaimed, may I 
perish, if ever' 
I 
plant in that bosom a 
thorn. 
Then I 
showed her a 
ring, and implored her to marry, 
She blushed like the dawning of morn ; 
Yes, Pll consent, she replied, if you'll promise 
That no jealous rival shall laugh me to scorn.

Ye ardent young men, to my warning take heed, 
And learn from the wretched existence I 
lead, 
When the passion of love cloth your bosom inspire, 
Don't get married until you stop to inquire. 
I 
was first in 
to my wife at a 
ball, 
Of the fair ones her graces exceeded them all, 
And that instant my heart to love her inclined, 
But ah 1 
I 
repent it Ibr going it blinds 
CHORUS. 
Take care, go it easy and make this a 
rule, 
Go it slow, go it slow, and don't be a 
fool, 
If you marry when love first your bosoms inspire, 
You'll jump from the frying-pan into the fire. 
That night at the ball, she was dressed in great taste, 
She had features so fair, and a 
sweet little waist, 
She had glossy black hair, and teeth pearly white 
And her beaming eyes shone like diamonds bright. 
I 
at once decided to make her my wife, 
I 
thought she would make a 
nice partner for life, 
Front her smiles and her graces I 
made up my mind, 
But now I 
repent it for going it blind. 
(
Crion-os.) 
'We were married, a-lass ! but I 
found out too late, 
That her smiles and caresses so soon changed to hate, 
That her glossy black hair so soon faded to,red, 
And that washing her fair face left freckles instead. 
Her pearly white teeth she takes out every night, 
Bad temper is all she initerits by right, 
She's built up with cotton before and behind, 
And that's all I 
got by going it blind. (CnoRUS.)

The Curly Little Bow-wow 
Miss Briggs was an old maid so stately and so staid, 
And her house in Portman Square 
Was crowded Ivith nicknacks, and china all in cracks, 
With articles of vertu rare ; 
She'd a 
parrot gray, called" Polly," that could whistle 
"Nix my dolly," 
But the pride of her life, I 
vow, 
Was a 
pretty little poodle, of the name of Slinky 
Doodle, 
Which she used to call her bow, wow, wow, 
CHORUS. 
For a 
jolly girl was she, so easy mid so free. 
With her curly little bow, wow, wow. 
Great pains Miss B. would take, her little pet to make 
In health and strength quite sound, 
To keep its coat like silk, it was fed on bread and 
milk, 
And when Saturday morn came round, 
She'd put it in a 
tub, and its coat begin to scrub, 
Then she'd towel it dry with care, 
And take air and exercise with her pretty little prize, 
In the neighborhood of May fair. (Cnonus.) 
But her poodle long had pined, its liberty to find, 
As thouLth of all sense bereft ; 
Site with no one near to warm her, one day dared 
round the corner, 
When the street-duor was open left. 
Miss 13., when told the new;=, was afflicted with the 
And grew nervous over her tea, 
And was very nearly cranky, at the thought of los-
ing Shanky, 
Who site never more thought to see. (Cnonus.) 
Now not far from Portman Square, there resided, I 
declare, 
An old major of the name of Boothl ; 
One evening after dark, while walking in Hyde Park, 
He met a 
distracted poodle ; 
He was smitten with its charms, so he took it in his 
arms, 
While his bachelor days to end, 
He said when he was shown her, that he'd wed the 
lucky owner 
Of his curly little canine friend. ( Cnonts.) 
The owner he found out from the handbills round 
about, 
The major off did start, 
With the poodle in a 
string, saw the maiden Briggs 
—poor thing, 
And offered her his hand and heart. 
Upon his knees he went, and asking her consent, 
Said a 
bappy man was he ; 
While stroking like a 
noodle, that pretty little poodle, 
She promised that his. wife she'd be. (Cnonus.) 
Good-Night. 
Sleep, gentle lady, the flowers are closing, 
The very waves and winds reposing ; 
Oh I 
may our soft and soothing u 
u 
milers 
Wrap thee in sweeter and softer slumbers. 
Peace be around thee, lady bright ; 
Sleep while we sing good- night, good-night.

I 
was out one charming morning, 
Picking berries all alone, 
On the grass the dew- drops glittered, 
Every bush with diamonds shone ; 
Merry birds with joyful carols, 
Skimmed the waving fields of rye, 
And I 
called unto a 
redbreast, 
As it coyly fluttered by, 
"Come to me, my pretty robin, 
Kiss me with your chirping bill, 
Let me tOndle and caress you, 
While your song my heart shall thrill." 
Lo ! a 
shadow fell beside Inc, 
And I 
heard a 
youth reply, 
" 
Shan't I 
kiss you for the robin ?" 
" 
No, I 
thank you, sir," said I. 
Quick I 
turned and looked about me, 
There stood blushing Willie Ray ; 
He had seen me by the roadside, 
And had slyly crept that way ; 
" 
Ali," said I, " my roguish lover, 
You're too willing, sir, by half, 
To assume the role of robin, 
You could better act the calf I" 
Hanging down his head in silence, 
Willie stood in blank dismay, 
While I, stern tone assuming, said, 
"Now mark me, Willie Ray: 
25 
You may kiss me for yourself, sir," 
He looked up with beaming eye, 
But to kiss me for the robin, 
No, I 
thank you, sir," said I.

The phrase throughout society 
Most popular, I 
think— 
It never gives satiety— 
Is, " Come and take a

You scarcely ever meet a

But, ' tis the usual style, 
Betbre you know, awny you go 
To have a 
friendly ' smile r

CHORUF. 
There's not 
that I 
think 
So good as Bourbon ‘vhisky, 
So come, my boy, and take a 
drink, 
I'll guarantee it makes you gay and frisky. 
When walking down the gay Broadway 
You come across friend Brown, 
Who looks so cheerful, that. he seems 
The happiest man in town. 
He shakes your hand, with joy elate, 
And says, " What do you think ?

Young Jones, he gives you an invite,

Of despair he's on the brink,

So thus in every phase of lire, 
Joy, gladness, grief or pin, 
You'rc il ways asked to take a

The Frost upon the Pan.e. 
One winter morn in careless mood 
I 
turned to gaze noon the sky, 
But when I 
by my window stood; 
What dreamlike fancies met mine eye? 
The glass was changed to fields and trees 
With feathery clouds, and waving grain, 
And fairy ships on mimic seas;— 
It was the frost upon the pane. 
I 
thought, while gazing on the view, 
What houseless forms beyond it lay, 
And then the sun came shining through, 
And soon the scene dissolved away. 
'Tis thus in sorrow's darkest hours, 
-AV hen most we doubt, hope comes again, 
And yielding then to brighter powers, 
Grief melts like frost upon the pane.

The Artful Old Sparrow. 
A 
gray London sparrow, an artful old cock, 
Sat blinking a- top of a 
spout, 
To and fro went his knowing old head like a 
clock, 
As he chirruped these sentiments out: 
" 
We live on the dust in the gutter and tiles, 
It sharpens one's wits and one's beak, 
What mysteries and secrets we downy old files 
Could tell if we only could speak; 
Twit, twit, twitter and sing, 
An old London sparrow knows many a 
thing. 
" 
There's young Mr. Flitter comes home with the milk, 
At the office he's always so prim, 
And yet a 
detective, as silky as silk, 
I 
mark is a-dodging of him ; 
There's Mrs. Hightlyer drives out in the Park, 
My feathers I 
don't she cut a 
dash ? 
And yet just a 
word in your ears, my friends, mark, 
Very soon her fine husband will smash. 
" 
The old swell that haunts the sweet milliner's shop, 
Lor' bless him, will find it no go, 
For to church very soon she'll be hopping the twig, 
With another and much younger beau ; 
And why does that dear girl at Miss Trimming's 
school, 
Peep over the play-ground wall high 
When that gent in light gloves, and coat made by 
Poole, 
Is by accident just passing by ? 
" 
The butcher, and baker, and jolly jack-tar, 
Make love to the nursery- maid, Sue ; 
29 
But, law ! there is one she loves better by far, 
And that's a 
great life-guardsman, Bin, 
That smart young policeman on key-holes, they say, 
At night keeps a 'vigilant eye, 
There are two things I 
know are much more in his 
W ay, 
Missus' cook and her cold rabbit pie. 
" 
That old Mother Hubbard has taken to gin, 
Her husband to bet the young flat ; 
I'd not trust those Browns with the price of a 
pin, 
Although for the matter of that—" 
Here ended the sparrow ; a 
sly cat, you see, 
Had crept up behind him so light, 
He pounced on his prey, and he bore him away— 
Faith, it served that old sparrow quite right. 
A 
Father's Love, 
The nectar cup may yield delight, 
The heart sweet music move, 
But, oh, no charm, however bright, 
Is like paternal love ; 
Affection wears a 
silken chain, 
O'er oceans though we rove, 
It gently brings us back again— 
Each link a 
father's love. 
Yes, like the balm of opening flowers, 
Across the ocean foam, 
It floats with us to distant towers, 
It pilots back our home. 
Alas, how oft, in later years, 
Though changed the heart may prove, 
Doth memory's dream recall—through tears— 
A father's early love. '•

Being only two wheels and a 
saddle, 
But is rather a 
nag, than a 
vehicle, 
That a 
man sits and rides on astraddle. 
Just two wheels, and no more, of which one goes 
before, 
With a 
crank on each side for propelling, • 
And the other one, smaller, comes jogging behind— 
Just the " wickedest " thing that is sailing. 
You must sit on the saddle and steady yourself, 
Then on pump with both legs like the 
Holding firmly meanwhile to the handle, to steer, 
When it " gits," if your head's only " level." 
It's a 
jolly fast nag, and will take you to town 
At a 
two-forty gait if well curried, 
But your head on the ground will too forte resound 
If your steed's badly managed or hurried. 
It will stand without hitching, keep fat without oats, 
And Vill never get frightened or frisky, 
It will never run off with the bit in its teeth 
When you call at the corner for whisky. 
It is not at all tricky unless you are green, 
When, look out, or you'll find yourself sprawling ; 
It will never get balky on any good pike, 
And is handy on New Years for calling. 
It's a 
sort of a 
hybrid, though not any mule, 
But a 
steed which " you bet " we can brag on, 
And for changing one's base is the vltima Mule 
On two wheels, with a 
crank and a 
wag on.

Two in the Morning. 
Young Tomkins resolved that he'd settle for life, 
So at twenty-two married a 
nice little wife, 
But a 
month or two served to subdue Hymen's flame, 
When he thought staying in of a 
night rather tame, 
His companions would chaff, when he'd fly in a 
rage, 
And for liberty sigh like a 
bird in a 
cage. 
And nightly he'd roam, ab(mt nine, from his home, 
And return about two in the morning. 
The excuse most invariably made wtrs, that he 
Was going a 
friend fond of science to see, 
And thence to a 
lecture on chemistry hear, 
Then afterwards try an experiment, dear. 
Now his wife, not a 
tartar, and yet not a 
flat, 
Had the gravest suspicion of what he was at, 
Said, " Experiments tried, it could not b, denied, 
Were no good about two in the mornings" 
Missus Tomkins one day through a 
friendly call, 
Discovered her husband had been to a 
ball, 
And when she came home, she, of course very cross, 
With the following charged him, and talked of divorce : 
" 
An experiment trying last night you were seen 
On the science of dancing, with a 
lady in green, 
And many such lecture, its right to conjecture, 
Yon have been at till two in the morning." 
" 
My dear, you're mistaken," exclaimed Mister T., 
" 
There's a 
man who presumes to impersonate me, 
And 
nicely he does it in every respect, 
That the difference it takes a 
keen eye to detect. 
34 
My friends say his clothes are precisely like these, 
In fact we're alike, yes, as like as two peas," 
Missus T. said, " No use, it's a 
paltry excuse, 
To come home about two in the morning." 
When next he went out he came home about two, 
'Twas pouting with rain, he was dripping wet through, 
When his with from the window of the front second. 
floor 
Popped her head out and asked, " Who is that at the 
door ?" 
" 
It's me, dear, it's Tomkins your husband come home, 
I'm drowned very nearly, make haste and come down, 
I'm as cold as a 
frog, it's not fit for a 
dog 
To be out such a 
boisterous morning." 
" 
Oh, you're the man, are you ?" exclaimed Missus T., 
" 
Who NVOUltd pass yourself off as my husband on me? 
But for once you have hit the wrong nail on the head, 
For my husband and I 
have been hours in bed, 
And you'd better be off while you're free and at large, 
For should he come down he will give you in charge, 
And likewise some kicks, sir, for playing such tricks,sir, 
At his house about two in the morning." 
Then she shut down the window, and Mister T.'s face 
Appeared very long when lie thou1a of the case, 
For it struck hint that really there might be a 
man 
Like the one he hail told to his wile is a 
plant. 
But the cure was effected, and his wife, about four, 
Took compassion upon him and opened the door, 
And ever since then home lie comes about ten 
Instead of at two in the morning.

My cognomen is Racketty Jack, 
A 
noisy swell am I, 
I 
care not how the world may wag, 
I 
never will say die; 
In grog and beer I 
do indulge, 
Sometimes in eliquot too, 
A 
bottle of " phizz " is all my eye, 
Bring in a 
dozen or two. 
CHORUS. 
Hi! ho ! ho ! stop ! 
Here, waiter, brandy hot ! 
Racketty Jack, no money I 
lack, 
And I'm the boy for a 
spree. 
When I 
go out at night, my boys, 
I'm always ripe fOr fun, 
And amongst the fair, I 
do declare, 
I 
always was " a 
1." 
Though a 
harum-scarum sort of chap, 
I 
ne'er forget the gals, 
For, next to them, there's nothing on earth, 
Like phizz and jolly good. pals. (Cm.) 
I 
like a 
lark, T 
do of course, 
I 
can't help being gay, 
I 
follow in my lather's steps, 
So at least the people say ; 
For beauty I 
admire, 
For a 
spree I'm always fresh, 
You see, what's bred in the bones, my boys, 
Is sure to come out in the flesh. (Clio.) 
I 
never fall out with a 
policeman, 
Nor cheat a 
hackman's fare, 
Nor, like low swells, wrench knockers off, 
And kick stalls in the air; 
For I 
can true enjoyment find, 
With friends like you at my back, 
So enjoy yourselves as long as you can, 
And hurrah for Racketty Jack. (cm)) 
When I 
bade good-by to Pheebe, 
From her eyes the tears fell fast; 
I 
clasped her, while around my neck 
Her arms she fondly cast. 
And though I 
whispered in her ear, 
I'd ever constant prove, 
Her sinking heart I 
could not cheer 
With tenderest words of love. 
CHORUS. 
"Now that you are going from me," 
Said my girl with sob and sigh, 
" 
There is nothing left for Phcebe, 
But to pine, and droop, and die." 
When I 
bade good-by to Plicebe, 
Though I 
strove to be a 
man, 
Adown my cheeks the bitter tears 
In scalding urrows ran. 
I 
strained her to my aching breast, 
And in those moments brief, 
It seemed as if there were comprest 
Long years of deepest grief. (Cnonts.)

Oh ! kiss me again—come close to tae now, 
The death-damps are gathering fast on my brow, 
And whisper thy love—its music will lay 
DeQp, deep in my soul, when I've passed away ; 
Don't shrink from me, darling, no rudeness or stain, 
Shall rest on this hour—kiss, kiss- me again. 
CHORUS. 
Don't shrink from me, darling, no rudeness or stain, 
Shall rest on this hour—oh, kiss me again. 
Oh I 
kiss me again—the cold world has laid 
Its mandate upon us, and we have obeyed ; 
Thy home has been sacred, thine honor to me 
Was dearer than life even ever could be. 
Don't tremble, my darling, my heart and my brain 
Has held but one passion—oh! kiss me again. (CHo.) 
Oh I 
kiss me again—'tis joy thus to be, 
Close, close to thee, dearest, untrammeled and free, 
To breathe out my passion, and call thee mine own, 
Ere I 
pass through the unlighted valley alone. 
Don't grieve so, my darling, there's pleasure and pain 
In meeting and parting—kiss, kiss me again. (Cno.) 
Oh! kiss me again—this sad world of ours, 
O'er our pathway has strewn more of thovns than of 
flowers; 
Let thy lips' gentle pressure thrill to my heart's core, 
Let our breath and our beings but mingle once more ; 
For soon these wild throbbings of heart and of brain 
Will be stilled in death's silence—then kiss me' again.

When. leaving old Ireland, 
My poor Pat said unto me, 
May heaven guard you, Norah dear, 
Across the deep blue sea; 
But you'll not forget your own true lad, 
or dear old Erin's shore, 
But hasten back to bless us 
With thine own sweet smile once more. 
CHORUS. 
To go is wrong—don't stop long, 
Bat come back soon to your own Chickabiddy, 
For my heart beats so when away you go 
From Pat and poor old Ireland. 
He kissed me with his ruby lips, 
And gave me such a 
smack, 
And said, in troth, before you go, 
Folks I 
I 
wish you would come back ; 
The grass will not grow half so green, 
The sky seem half so bright, 
'When No 
rah leaves old Ireland, 
For she's my heart's delight..

I 
could not help the scalding tear 
That trickled down my cheek, 
Nor keep the big lamp from my throat 
That would not let me speak. 
I 
threw my arms about his neck, 
And to relieve his pain, 
Declared that rd return to him, 
And Ireland once again. (Cnonus.)

In sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart is filled with woe, 
Though in my grief I 
ponder, 
What to do I 
do not know ; 
My cruel fate does on me frown, 
The trouble seems to be, 
There is a 
fellar in this town, 
And he just looks like me. 
cnonus. 
Oh, wouldn't I 
like to meet him, 
Whoever ‘he may be, 
Oh, wouldn't I 
give him particular fits, 
The fellar that looks like me. 
One day I 
went to see a 
girl, 
I 
was going to take her round, 
When a 
lady tapped me on the arm, 
Saying, " How's your wife, old Brown?" 
In vain I 
said, " I'm a 
single man, 
And married I 
wish to he," 
They called me a 
swindler, and kicked me out, 
For the fellar that looked like me. (Cnonus.) 
One night I 
went out to a 
ball, 
I 
was just enjoying the sport, 
When a 
police grabbed me by the arm, 
" 
You're wanted down in court ; 
You've escaped us once, but this 'ere time 
I'll take care you don't get free." 
He dragged me off, locked me up in jail, 
For the fellar that looked like me. (Cnoncs.) 
41 
I 
was tried next day, found guilty, 
I 
was about to be taken down, 
When another policeman he brought in 
The right criminal, Mr. Brown ; 
They locked him up, they let me go, 
Oh„ he was a 
sight to see, 
The ugliest man / ever saw 
Was the fellar that looked like me. (Cnonns.)

I 
wandered by the leafy lane, 
The sun was going down ; 
I 
heard his gentle steps again, 
And yet I 
did not frown; 
Thinks I 
he came to walk with me, 
To tell him " No" is rude; 
I 
couldn't if I 
would, you see, 
I 
wouldn't if I 
could.

I 
wouldn't if I 
could! 
The early stars were in the sky. 
And still he did not go ; 
The garden gate we lingered by, 
In evening's silver glow; 
He asked me if his wife I'd be, 
And whisper " No," who would? 
I 
couldn't if I 
would, you see, 
I 
wouldn't if I 
could.

Pretty Jemima, Don't Say No. 
My love she lives in a 
two pair back, 
Iler eyes are bright as stars of night, 
Of falling in love I've got a 
knack, 
And she's the girl for me. 
At six o'clock she leaves off' work, 
At seven she's finished her tea, 
At eight she's dressed in all her best 
And she comes for a 
walk with me. 
Oh, 
CHORE'S. 
Pretty Jemima, don't say no, 
Oh ! hi, oh ! don't say no, . 
Pretty Jemima, don't say no, 
And we will married be. 
I 
once was afraid to speak outright, 
I 
was so shy I 
feared to try, 
The thought of it put me all in a 
fright, 
So I'd grizzle and pine all day. 
I 
was getting as thin as a 
scaffold pole, 
My buttons all fell away, 
And just because I 
hadn't the nerve 
To pluck up my courage and say, Oh, (Clio.) 
We went for a 
walk not long ago, 
Thinks I:somehow I'll tell her now. 
I 
was just going to let her know, 
When she spied a 
milliner's shop ; 
A hat and feather was there for sale, 
I 
couldn't do less than stop, 
By the time I'd bought it my courage had gone, 
And I 
could not the question pop, of ( Ono.) 
At last one morning I 
bought the ring, 
And hit on a 
plan to make me a 
man : 
43 
Thinks I 
to myself, this is the thing, 
This night shall cast the die; 
I 
held it up : " Look ye here," I 
said; 
The moment it caught her eye, 
Her lovely cheeks were suffused with red, 
And seeing no one by, I 
said, (Ono.) 
Of course I 
was anxious to know my fate, 
I 
almost dread the words I 
said, 
Whether to be with joy elate 
Or be the most wretched of men. 
She tried it on her finger and said, 
'Twas a 
little too large, but then 
I 
could buy a 
keeper and we'd get spliced 
Next Saturday morning at ten, and (Ono.) 
My Sweet Girl. 
The wealthy fool, with gold in store, 
Will still desire to grow richer ; 
Give me but these, I 
ask no more, 
My charming girl, my friend and pitcher. 
Crponus—My friend so rare, my girl so fair, 
With such what mortal can be richer ? 
Give me but these, a 
fig for care, 
With my sweet girl, my friend and pitcher. 
From morning's sun I'd never grieve 
To toil a 
hedger or a 
ditcher ; 
If that, when I 
came home at eve, 
I 
might enjoy my friend and pitcher. (Cno.) 
Though Fortune ever shuns my door, 
I 
know not what can thus bewitch her ; 
With all my heart, can I 
be poor, 
With my sweet girl, my friend and pitcher? 
When Sammy Comes Home. 
I 
love a 
valiant soldier bold, 
Nineteen years old, with plenty of gold 
On his dress, and if the truth he's told, 
lie's awfully fond of me ; 
The one that I 
love, his name it is Sam. 
Such a 
darling is Sam, without any cram, 
I 
like him much better than raspberry jam, 
For his like yet I 
never did see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, shan't I be glad when Sammy comes home, 
when Sammy comes home, 
Oh, shan't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home in the morning. 
He wears a 
red coat, and a 
sword by his side, 
With sptirs on his heels and long whiskers beside, 
And sometimes he has a 
big horse for to ride, 
Oh, don't he look martial and grand ; 
On top of his hat a 
feather there grows, 
Put there, I 
suppose, to show how the wind blows,. 
His hair is magenta, and so is his nose, 
With the handsomest form in the land. (OnoRus.) 
My Sammy lids traveled to many a 
shore, 
Where the elephants fly and the crocodiles roar, 
And oh, should he never come back any more, 
For my Sammy I'd die in despair ; 
No one could imagine what he has gone through,. 
He can talk foreign language until all is blue, 
French, Dutch, Spanish, Persian, and Irish too, 
To hear him would make you all stare. (Cnonus.) 
I 
shall never forget when he told me his love, 
And vowed by all of the stars above, 
And squeezed my poor fingers as well as thy glove, 
I 
believed every word that he said ; 
But, oh, when he said that abroad lie mutt hie, 
And wished me good- by, I 
thought I 
should die, 
So I 
sat myself down and had a 
good cry, 
For without him rd surely do dead, ( CtioRus.) 
Are You Angry, Mother? 
Are you angry, mother ? 
o ? 
Should I 
sad and peevish grow, 
-When I 
see our sky so bright, 
And our fields so warm with light ? 
Oh ! I 
feel as I 
had wings, 
And the heart within me sings; 
Then, it may be, I'm too gay, 
But forgive me, mother, pray ; 
Be not angry with your boy, 
One cross look will mar his joy. 
Is it my fault that my heart 
Sometimes plays too wild a 
part ? 
Oft when I 
have tried to be 
Grave as age could fimey me, 
Stepping lvith a 
sober pace, 
Looking with a 
sober face, 
Still my heart is wildly gay, 
Spite of all I 
do and say ; 
Yet no anger with your boy, 
One cross look will mar his joy.

Society's ways, in these Curious days, 
Needs much alteration, Pm sure ; 
For seldom you'll see that rich folks agree 
With those whom misfortune's made poor. 
Now this must be wrong if there's truth in my song, 
For a 
man may be worthy, though poor, 
Then give him a 
lift that be may make a 
shift, 
To keep off the wolf from his door. • 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
give this advice, entreating you won't, 
On your heel turn away with a 
frown, 
When a 
poor fellow needs it, assist him, but don't 
Put your foot on a 
man when he's down. 
The poor laboring man, who tries all he can 
To battle his way through life's throng, 
Oft finds, to his cost, that cold winter's frost 
Impedes much his getting along. 
The workingmen strive in the industrial hive, 
Something to put by from their trade, 
Commercial depression brings stern retrogression, 
And swallows the little they've made. (Crio.) 
How many good men have again and again, 
Given way ' neath the world's heavy cares, 
For want of a 
start from a 
generous heart, 
Whose fortune's been brighter than theirs. 
And time after time we hear of some crime 
Induced by sad poverty, keen, 
That might have been stayed, had an effort been made, 
Before he'd such misery seen. (Cnonts.) 
Misfortune's cold shade visits every grade, 
The rich man as yell as the poor, 
Then hesitate not, while wealth you have got, 
To help whom you can from your store. 
Ere long it may be fate's cruel decree 
Your hopes' fairest prospects to smother, 
You'll surely find then, kind, good-hearted men, 
To help you as you've helped some other. (Cno.) 
The Child and the -
Butterfly, 
An old man saw a 
little child 
A butterfly pursuing, 
That fluttered gayly in the sun, 
Each bud and flow'ret wooing; 
" 
Oh trifle not with time," he said, 
"Lire's fleeting moments treasure, 
Nor waste youth's bright and rosy hours 
In vain and idle pleasure.' 
'Twas vain—the merry boy went on 
Through meadow, vale and wildwood ; 
For what has youth to do but play, 
And what is time to childhood ? 
The laughing boy to manhood grew, 
Life's battle bravely doing ; 
But what is oft the noblest aim. 
But butterflies pursuing ? 
Some false light glitters in our path, 
Some phantom flick before us, 
And, ere we've snatched the wished-for prize, 
Old age comes creeping o'er us. ' 
Alt ! 
chide not then each idle sport 
In valley, mead or wildwood, 
Let youth be happy while it may, 
Nor talk of lime to childhood!

From Skaneatalas lately I 
landed, 
The reason to York I 
came down, 
A 
letter one day I 
was handed 
From a 
friend who resides in this town ; 
A long story he in it was telling 
'Bout what is just now all the talk, 
Of a 
fellow they call John Allen, 
The wickedest man in New York. 
I 
immediately bought all the papers, 
To see where those bad fellows meet, 
To cut up their curious capers; 
I 
found it was in Water street. 
There, outside of a 
queer-looking shanty, 
I 
saw a 
crowd on the sidewalk, 
And a 
white-chokered fellow I 
thought was 
The Nvichedest man in New York. 
By a 
smart looking girl I 
was greeted, 
To a 
meeting she asked me to go ; 
I 
went to the meeting, and treated— 
At drinking she did not prove slow ; 
Tommy Haddeu's she asked me to visit, 
And there we had some pleasant talk, 
Ere I 
left her, I 
quickly di-,covered, 
She was the wickedest gal in New York. 
Then I 
met with a 
fellow who asked MC 
To Kit Bums' rat- pit to go, 
Saying the mission their meeting have ended, 
ITow the sport is beginning, you know. 
A large lot of rats they let loose then, 
And a 
dog who at once went•to work, 
And I 
thought from the way that he killed them, 
fie was the wickedest dog in New York. 
And still I 
went on, on my journey, 
Because I 
had made up my mind, 
Before I 
went back to the country, 
The wickedest man for to find. 
At length I !bun& out Johnny Allen's, 
And into the house I 
did walk, 
And the preacher my friend pointed out as 
The wickedest man in New York. 
Then I 
found out among those.were there, 
I 
the wickedest man couldn't tell, 
So I 
gave up the job in despair, 
And wandered back to my hotel. 
There I 
found out my watch, chain and money, 
Away from my person had " walked," 
And I 
made up my mind that- my friend was 
The wickedest man in New York. 
Mynheer Vandunck. 
Mynbeer Vandunck, though he never was drunk, 
Sipped water and brandy gayly, 
And he quenched his thirst with two quarts of the first 
To it pint of the latter daily; 
Sinning, " Oh that a 
Dutchman's draught could be 
As deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee." 
Water well mingled with spirits good store, 
No Hollander dreams of scorning ; 
But of water alone he drinks no more 
Than a 
rose supplies when a 
dewdrop lies 
On its bloom, in a 
summer morning; 
For a

I've just made a 
promise to marry 
A youth who to home is inclined, 
And misunderstandings to parry, 
I 
now speak a 
bit of my mind: 
lie mustn't get cross or unruly, 
Bounce, swagger, or toss off his hat, 
If he does, I 
can tell him, and truly, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that.

If he does, I 
can tell him, and truly, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
He shall find that I 
will be respected, 
Have no matrimonial snubs, 
Nor stop at home, sad and neglected, 
While he's at his parties and clubs. 
As to friends, he may have them by dozens 
But then, he must mind what he's at, 
For if he likes to flirt with his cousins, 
He'll find I 
can heat hint at that. (Cno.) 
I 
shall never be selfish or jealous. 
As many wives are, there's no doubt, 
But he mustn't begin gallivanting, 
Or !waning young ladies about. 
My rights I 
shall prize pretty highly, 
So tell him again, plain and flat : 
If he gives a 
kiss or two slily, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. (Cno.) 
But if he is happy and loving, 
Contented with me and his home, 
Affectionate, fond and approving, 
Nor ever seems wishful to roam, 
But each opportunity seizes 
To sit with me, comfort and chat, 
In short, be as kind as he pleases, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. (Ciro.)

Shall I 
ever get married ? oh dear, oh dear ! 
I 
never shall, I 
fear, I 
fear. 
There was Henry Brown and Johnny Snow, 
Both courted me some time ago, 
And why they left I 
do not know, 
But certain it is that they both did go. 
Shall I 
ever get married ? oh dear, oh dear 
I 
never shall, I 
fear, I 
fear. 
Many beaux have come, but none have stayed, 
Now I 
really begin to feel afraid 
That I'm doomed at last to die an old maid, 
That I'm doomed at last to die an old maid. 
Shall I 
ever get married ? oh dear, oh dear 
I 
never shall, Ifear, I 
fear. 
And now my hopes are blasted quite, 
This lesson has taught me that flirting's not right, 
A warning to ladies I 
now bring to light, 
And hope that the gents will all pity my plight. 
The Age of Indian-Rubber. 
Let steam and gas pursue their way, 
For now ' tis my intention 
A. word or two in praise to say 
About a 
new invention ; 
No matter where you chance to be, 
'Tis plain to wise and lubber, 
This is, by every thing we see, 
The age of Indian-rubber: 
Oh, the rubber, the Indian ,rubber, 
The rub, rub rubbing rubber 1 
Our gents When dressed once looked as well, 
As we can e'er allow men, 
No difficulty ' twas to tell, 
The difference to the plowmen ; 
But 110W our peasants, I 
declare, 
The gentry beat by notches, 
For they Indian- rubber smock- frocks wear, 
And call them Mackintoshes ! 
Oh, the rubber, the wonderful rubber, 
The real Indian-rubber! 
As stationery, you'll allow, 
We once used to discern it, 
But ' tis not stationer!! now, 
To everything they turn it ; 
It's former use now much declines, 
With nobler things it copes, 
Instead of rubbing out our lines 
They make it into ropes ! 
Oh, the rubber, the Indian- rubber, 
The wonderful Indian-rubber ! _ 
Boots made of Indian-rubber, you 
See everywhere, I'm told, 
And so you all can buy a 
shoe 
That never hal been soled ; 
Run up a 
score—'tis only fair, 
Whatever bills they show 
If you only Indian-rubber wear, 
You can rub out ag you go 
011, the rubber, the Indian-rubber, 
The convenient Indian-rubber 
A cold from sleeping m damp sheets 
You never need be dreading, 
For nothing is there now that beats 
The Indian- rubber bedding ; 
All those who have of children care, 
To them my song confesses, 
If they Indian-rubber aprons wear 
They'll never spoil their dresses 
Oh, the rubber, the Indian-rubber, 
The water-proof Indian-rubber 
Elastic belts our beaux prefer 
To show off well their muscles, 
Our belles who wish to make a 
stir 
Wear Indian- rubber bustles ; 
American demands are great, 
Thu article they're fetching, 
It suits them well, I 
needn't state 
They're noted so for stretching 
Oh, the rubber, the Indian-rubber,

Come all you boys, both tar and near, 
And listen awhile to me, 
And a 
dismal story you shall hear, 
About my love and me. 
I 
courted long, my love was strong, 
Like the heart of a 
big oak tree, 
But sorry I 
am to say, my love she's gone away, 
To the shores of Amerikey. 
cuonus. 
For my love was a 
charming girl, 
From the Cove of Cork came she, 
And I 
wept and I 
wailed, when the good ship sailed 
To the shores of Amerikey. 
When we got to the church, I 
was left in the lurch, 
But let that day go by; 
When we got to the door, Nellie says I 
am poor, 
Then says I, my love, good-by ; 
For I 
know right well you're an Irish girl, 
And you can't come over me. 
Oh, says Nellie,do you mind,I will leave you far behind, 
And off to Amerikey. (CHonus.) 
Come gather round me one and all, 
And a 
warning take by me: 
A bird in the hand, as you well understand, 
Is worth twelve hundred thousand in a 
tree ; 
To persuade you they may say, name the day, 
But it's wait till the time suits me ; 
Then as slippery as an eel, they will turn on their heel, 
And skedaddle to Amerikey. (Cnonus.)

CHORUS—We're a 
lively pair of colored folks, 
And what we say, is true; 
" 
French Ballet" troupes are in the shade, 
When we put down the shoe. 
We does our shopping on Broadway, 
Just like the poor white trash; 
The clerks all roll their eyes on us, 
When we put down the cash; 
The white gals then turn up their nose, 
And say we put on airs, 
But I 
tell them to shut up their mouths 
And mind their own affairs. 
For you are my heart's desire, etc. 
I 
took her to the concert-room, 
To hear Parepa sing; 
The door- keeper he put on airs, 
And would not let us in; 
I 
told him we were Arabs, 
From the burning desert shore, 
Says he your hair is curled too tight, 
I've seen such figs before.

Your attention I 
ask for awhile, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
It's about a 
yaller gal that I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me : 
She was pretty, and as sweet as a flower; 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet, with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. • 
cnonus. 
Oh, my ! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
'ith her tilting hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along— 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda : 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be— 
So l'd dress up and I'd walk by her house 
Every afternoon about three— 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my 
dear Lueinila, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. (Cno.) 
Oh, you should have seen her on her wedding-day, 
She was handsome as a 
Venus ; 
I When the parson, made us one, aim, then the thing was 
done, 
4 
57 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So I've bought a 
little place out of town ; 
If you go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as 
life, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. (Cno.)

As style is every thing, the song I'm going to sing 
Is all about that interesting theme, 
And when you go away, each one of you can say, 
The nobbiest one at last you all have seen. 
CHORUS. 
So then we will all be jolly, 
Stand aside and let this swell go past, 
I 
like to do the grand, with a 
short cane in my hand, 
For by Jove, you see the nobbiest one at last. 
When I 
walk upon the street, the ladies that I 
meet 
Admire my stunning style as I 
go past; 
Through my eye-glasses I 
stare with a 
most distingue 
They acknowledge I'm the nobbiest one at last. 
At the theater or the ball, at concerts one and all, 
I 
ogle all the pretty girls I 
see ; 
And to use a 
common phrase, I've got such mashing 
ways, 
There's a 
dozen of them dead in love with me. 
So long- as I 
survive, to be a 
swell I'll strive, 
For that's the only thing that I 
hold dear ; 
And when they bury me, my epitaph shall be, 
" 
Behold the nobby one at last lies here." ( Cno.)

Have You Seen Ruth? 
A POPULAR COMO SONG. 
I'll sing of my love, of my love I 
will sing, 
And into your floodgat es the tears it will brim: ; 
My love was a 
Quakeress, with riches untold, 
So scrumscious and beautiful, not eighteen years old, 
I 
on her love squandered some two years or more, 
But alas ! all my hopes have come down to the floor ; 
My first love and last love, the pride of my youth, 
And now am forsaken by false, fickle Ruth. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, have you seen Ruth, the pride of my youth, 
The first girl I 
loved she was verily ; 
With a 
groan and a 
sigh I 
will lay down and die, 
Lor the loss of my Ruth with a 
cast in her eye. 
Her father and mother were awful severe, 
And never allowed me to see Ruthey dear ; 
Like Romeo and Juliet our case it was hard, 
For I'd serenade my love each night from the yard ; 
In an old empty water butt that stood on the ground, 
Secreted inside it I 
there might be found, 
While Ruth at the window would look down on me, 
When her parents looked for me no one could they see. 
I 
courted her long from the butt in the yard, 
I'd vamp on the violin and sing like a 
bird ; 
But her parents they found out the place where I 
hid, 
And 
on a 
pipe to the butt, yes they did ; 
The next night I 
got in my sweet voice she heard, 
I 
sung to my Ruth, " Oh, would I 
Were a 
bird IF' 
I'd scarce got so far as " I 
could fly to thee," 
When on came the water and nigh drowned me. 
59 
I 
left her in silence and returned to my home, 
With shame I 
turned red and then blue to the bone, 
I 
tossed head or woman which way I 
should die, 
But I 
couldn't teN either for the tears in my eye; 
It turned up a, woman, and " poison " that meant, 
So then to the cupboard half-drowned I 
went : 
A bottle ! 1 
seized it, to Ruth then I 
wrote, 
Then manfully poured the contents down my throat. 
Spoken: And it had not the slightest effect upon me. The 
reason it did not hurt me was because it was brandy, not 
"poison." (Clionuso 
From that day to this my sweet Ruth I've not seen, 
All over the world down to Greenwich rye been, 
No hopes I 
can trace except that I've heard, 
She flew from her parents' home just like a 
bird ; 
All through their cruelty to her and to me, 
I'll go for a 
sailor and plow the blue sea, 
I'll sail down to Gravesend, get sea-sick and die, 
Through losing my Ruth with a 
squint in her eye. 
The March Wind. 
Cold, oh ! cold the March winds be ; 
High up in a 
leafless tree 
The little bird sings and wearily twits 
The woods with perjury ; 
But the cuckoo knave sings bold his stave, 
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo. 
The spring comes ever merrily, 
And oh ! poor fool, sings he— 
For this is the way in the world to live, 
Ti) mock when a 
friend has no more to give, 
Whether in hall or tree.

She can't conic out before, 
So by a

My love I'll meet at four. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Comilla', coming, 
What joy could I 
feel more, 
'Tis happiness I 
can't express, 
To meet my love at four. 
She dresses neat, her smiles are sweet, 
Fond looks she bends on me, 
The sun shines bright, the daisies nod 
To her footsteps light and free. 
I 
whisper love- tales in her ears, 
And how I 
do adore, 
When Sunday conies, and off I 
run, 
My love to meet at four. (Cilonus.) 
The time is drawing to a 
close, 
And married soon we'll be, 
We'll feel no care, for a 
happier pair 
Don't live than Lou and me. 
And through this world we'll live as one, 
I 
hope to part no more, 
In memory shall I 
oft exclaim, 
My love I'll meet at four.' (Cuonus.)

With mighty conceit of herself,

Though gained with a
