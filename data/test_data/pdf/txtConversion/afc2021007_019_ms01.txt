25:00-34:30 
Rock fish important entry level fishery, Development of fleet for halibut and black cod.  
Previous markets dominated by foreign fleet and Seattle halibut schooner fleet.  Low 
sable fish prices, .29 cents per pound.   Fishing in bad weather 90 miles off shore out of 
Yakutat in 46 ft boat.  Stuck in a storm boat breaking apart.   16-18 hours to reach 
safety.  Other boat almost sinks. Feeling nerves outside of body.  Deckhand appendix 
bursts.   
 
34:30-38:00 
Fishing off Cape Edgecumbe, catching coho salmon, storm moves in. Clipper tough boat, 
but worried about taking wave over the stern.   Storm blowing out of Silver Bay. Bucking 
into bad weather trying to get home around the Cape.  Cruise ship calling to see if okay.  
Surviving ordeal, tied to dock cleaning fish.  Never wanting to be in situation of needing 
to be rescued.   
 
38:00-45:00 
Getting on North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (NPFMC).  Graduate school 
thesis on transferable fishing quotas.  Developing IFQ program, concern over 
consolidation of quota ownership Testifying before Council, getting nominated, not 
primary candidate.  Resistance to IFQ among fishermen.  Getting death threats, losing 
friends and boats in halibut derbys. No perfect fishery management system.  Fishermen 
who supported conservation supported program, fishermen who didn’t receive quota 
were against it. 
 
45:00-50:00 
Local resistance in Sitka to IFQ program. Fishermen attempt to join ALFA to  vote against 
it. Clem Tillion.  Kodiak fleet was against IFQs.    Fisherman fish for history to qualify for 
IFQ, rewarded by management structure.  Dangerous black cod fishing during derbys 
fishing off shore, friends lost at sea.  Make or break boat payment, fishing in bad 
weather.  Great way to raise kids fishing, longlining after IFQs for some families.   
 
50:00-55:00 
New Zealand fishing representative offers IFQs do not benefit small scale fishermen and 
small fishing communities.  Create protections for small scale fishermen though vessel 
size classes. Massive increase in cost of entry into fishery unintended consequence of 
IFQ program. Protections were not enough to control the cost of access to the fishery.  
Small quota not selling for less as previously anticipated.  Loss of halibut quota in 
smallest rural Alaska coast fishing communities.   Pursuing entry level access pool 
program for halibut fishery. 
 
55:00-60:00 
Climate change, ecological change, changes in what fish are eating.  Changes in forage 
fish composition. Warming waters degrade omega in salmon based on change in diet.

Squid not as rich as herring.   King salmon taste different based on diet.  Climate change 
warning signs, dead sea birds, less dolphins off shore, general decline in abundance.

100:00-1:05:00 
 
NOAA red-flag presentation to NPFMC. Climate change impacting commercial fisheries.   
 
Fishermen looking to Washington D.C. for relief instead of recognizing downward  
Trajectories in some stocks.  Heavy financial burden to switch, or diversify into different 
fisheries. Trollers look for feed in the water.  Looking for feed in cold water pockets, 
glacial fed streams entering the marine environment. Decline in crab. 
 
105:00-1:10:00 
Greater consumer interest in supporting small scale fisheries and protecting the ocean.  
Small scale fisherman part of keeping ocean clean. Increased prominence of indigenous 
voices, challenging dominant world view.   Relearning.  Next generation, wanting future 
generations to have the same opportunity to fish.
