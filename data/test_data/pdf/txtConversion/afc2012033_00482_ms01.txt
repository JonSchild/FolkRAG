HH: It’s January 14th, 2013. I’m Hannah Harvester with Traditional Arts in Upstate New York and I’m here 
in the home of Haskell and Jane Yancey. Croghan is your mailing address but this is Belfort— 
HY: Belfort 
JY: Above Belfort.  
HY: In back of Belfort is the way we’re looked at. If you go up the next set of hills, then it’s considered 
Long Pond.  
[big dog yawn] 
HH: This is Long Pond Road, oh! And we have a dog here too.  
HY: I got his ear, I moved my foot. 
HH: So just to start, would you both just say your full name and just a little bit of personal history where 
you were born, how you grew up, a little bit about your education. I know we’ve talked about this 
before, but just to get it as part of the interview. 
HY: okay. I’m Haskell— my middle name is Andrew— Yancey Jr. I was born in Lowville and I grew up 
near Croghan. This is my family’s homestead originally, the Yancey family. When they moved here from 
the Alsace-Lorraine provinces— France Germany— spent all but four of my years living here in this area. 
Graduated from Beaver River Central High School and then graduated from Cornell University. I spent 
five years working in Cooperative Extension as an Ag agent here in Lewis County, before moving to the 
farm. A couple years in construction and what not as well. I’ll let Jane talk about—we met at college. 
HH: I remember you were lab partners. That stuck with me. 
HY: Chemistry! 
HH: And what about you Jane? 
2 
 
JY: I’m Jane Ann Weisey Yancey. I was born in a place called Westville, NY which is almost out past the 
Pennsylvania border, southwest of Buffalo. Grew up outside a little village, well actually it’s the county 
seat so it’s not that tiny, named Mayville, in Chataqua County, on a dairy farm. Graduated from Mayville 
Central School and went to Cornell University in the College of Human Ecology, majored in Human 
Nutrition and Food, which is what it was when I started, then it became the Division of Nutritional 
Sciences before I graduated.  
HH: Okay. 
HY: And Haskell and I met the first week of college in freshman year in the chemistry lab. We were 
chemistry partners.  
[0:03:27]  
HH: Haskell, would you just talk a little bit more about the history of this farm itself? When did your 
family come here? 
HY: It was Catherine that moved here with all her children in 1834. And it was quite a number, I can’t 
even— we can look it up. I can’t even tell you how many quote unquote kids there were. Some were not 
even children at the time. She moved on and some of the family moved to Canada and other areas. But 
Peter and Nicholas that primarily stayed here. And Peter is the one that owned the property and 
whatnot here and started the farm. Also started the sugar bush in 1844, is the date we have on that. The 
next generation would have been Andrew, my grandfather. He was here for quite a number—our 
generations are quite far apart. So given the timeframe, there’d be more generations. But the trend is 
still continuing [Yanceys laugh]. But my dad grew up here but he moved away, well he moved to 
Croghan. So it was my two uncles that were on the farm. And the farm was actually in my Uncle Joe’s 
name, but my Uncle Ervin was here as well. And they operated the dairy and the sugar bush from 
Andrew on until us. And then Ervin was killed in 1981 after he was hurt by a bull. My other Uncle Joe, 
who was not young anymore, we took over the dairy and we ran the sugar bush jointly until he died in 
1995, I think it was. In the spring, prior to the microburst. The summer of ’95 was when the microburst 
hit. And since then it’s been us. At this point our son Tim is not a formal owner yet, but he does own 
some cattle and we have an operating agreement with him that started the first of the year, looking 
towards transferring to home in the future. 
HH: Okay. 
HY: A couple years down the road, or a year or two, depending on how things go. 
[0:06:25]  
HH: So you’re planning to transfer the whole operation to him. 
HY: Probably it would be cattle and equipment, cattle first, equipment and then real estate, which is 
the—contracts sales that’s the typical—timing of the things because—you do cattle first then they can 
3 
 
build up equity. And if you do machinery first—machinery depreciates— every year it’s a year older, so 
it’s harder for the buyer to gain, and then real estate is typically last. 
HH: Now will you continue working on the farm or you’ll basically retire? 
HY: Oh I’m just gonna quit! [all laugh] At this point we’ve looked at a partnership type arrangement or 
whatnot. It’s another couple years before I can get retirement. Then at that point we can make some 
decision as to whether he takes over completely and we leave completely. Probably we will be here. Old 
farmers never retire. 
[0:07:40]  
HH: So I’ve heard. Just before we leave history for a minute, when your family, when your ancestors 
came. Was that—were they Mennonite? 
HY: Yes. Yes. 
HH: Okay. And at that time, my understanding is that Lewis County is largely, has a large Mennonite 
population. Were they sort of the first settlers to this region? 
HY: They weren’t among the first, but they were early on. I think a lot of them came in the 1830s in the 
Croghan area here, since it’s branched out. Croghan itself, the village, was primarily Catholic. And the 
rural part, the outside part was where the Mennonites settled. And I think to some extent, my family 
always considered themselves German and a lot of the Catholics considered themselves French, but 
they all came from the same place! You either went with your religion, you went with the nationality 
because the Alsace Lorraine provinces were the ones that were fought over all the time. And they were 
basically draft dodgers, to some extent. Maybe not literally, but they wanted to get away from the wars. 
And we don’t know for sure what the story is, why Catherine came by herself with the children. We 
don’t know if something had happened to the family or him or what. And we’ve, I guess we’ve 
researched— Beth has mostly— back and got names from, and even the town where they came from. 
But we don’t know the answer to that. 
[0:09:40]  
HH: Now had that family been farmers in Alsace Lorraine? 
HY: We really don’t know. We really don’t know. 
HH: But most of the Mennonites who came over, set up farms. 
JY: And of course at that point, to some extent, it was subsistence farming; it wasn’t production farming 
per say.  
HY: And a lot of the farms were small and you shipped milk in the summer and in the wintertime you 
maybe put your horses in the woods. And then in the springtime what the trend became that you made 
maple syrup. And then you started it all over again. In the summer you did your farming type things. I’m 
4 
 
assuming that’s where you got your cash income. And this is one of the earlier sugar bushes that was 
started in this area. And then of course it stayed in the family, stayed in the same location. The woods is 
on the same location, the boiling shed is moved.  
[0:10:58]  
HH: How did you, Haskell, decide that you were going to go into farming? Was it something you knew all 
your life? It sounds like you did work some other jobs. How did you come to that decision? 
HY: Well, I guess ever since I was younger I was probably indoctrinated to take over the place anyway, to 
get into it. It was something I wanted to do. I don’t think I would have been satisfied if I wouldn’t have 
done it. I think probably time away from the farm was a good thing. I know that a lot of my experience 
helped when we got on the farm and that’s the one thing. Farm kids that grow up on a farm and stay on 
the farm, don’t learn necessarily how other people do it. And there’s any number of ways of farming and 
I don’t know if any of them are wrong, if they work. That’s why it’s hard to get farmers unified on 
anything, because we’re all a bunch of independent bullheads. [All laugh] And I tell people that I don’t 
think I could work for anybody else anymore. Because I’m— I think I could but you’re used to doing 
things the way YOU do them and not the way someone else does. And you’re used to doing something 
when YOU want to, not when somebody else says you should do it, that sort of thing. But we kind of 
jokingly say we did this by choice, not because anybody had to. I guess if we wanted to we could make a 
living elsewhere, but maybe it wouldn’t be as easy as it was 10, 15, 20 years ago. 
[0:13:02]  
HH:  [to Jane] You also grew up on a dairy farm, did you enjoy growing up on a farm, on a dairy? If so, 
what did you enjoy about it?  
JY: It’s one of those things that no matter what you do, I mean its how I grew up, so it’s the way it was 
supposed to be, as far as I was concerned. You like the animals— well one thing he says, and I think this 
is true, is that just about the time you really get sick and tired doing a certain job, except milking the 
cows which is there every day morning and night, just about the time you get really sick of doing 
something, it’s time to do something else anyway. There is such a variety of things that are 
encompassed in being a farmer. And so it keeps things interesting most of the time.  
HY: One of the things about her family when I first met them and visited out there and whatnot. The 
family was quite close and they’d get together quite a lot. Every time they got together they talked 
about farming. Because her family, not her parents, well her mother’s family had a long established farm 
too. But they talked farming, there were— now— the interesting part of all this is, we’re the only 
farmers left in the family— she and I. Her brothers were on their farm for a while; her uncle was on his 
farm. 
JY: And my cousin with him. 
HY: Yeah and the cousin with him. That one, a major highway went through and pretty well chewed it 
up. They built a big rest area in the heart of the farm and pretty well— for a family, even the non-
5 
 
farmers sat down and talked farming. And now it’s kind of— we’re it. And that’s maybe typical of the 
times. 
[15:18]  
HH: And what were your jobs when you were kids growing up on the farm? How did you start to learn 
and what were your first chores? 
HY: I didn’t grow up on a farm, my dad worked in the mill. I worked on the neighbors, primarily in the 
summer doing baled hay, small square bales. Which we have to clarify that now. [Haskell is referring to 
the fact that today much hay is baled as large round bales, while when he was growing up it all would 
have been square.] I worked there quite a few summers and then my uncles here were a little slower 
here getting started. So when the neighbor got done, I’d go to work here and I pretty much spend the 
whole summer— 
JY: doing hay— 
HY: And then sugaring. Dad was up here a lot. I think if my uncle hadn’t been here dad would’ve been, is 
about what it amounted to. He spent a lot of time here. My mother would get frustrated with him 
because he spent so much time. And of course when I was old enough, it was the two of us then.  
HH: Well let me ask you, Jane, and then I’ll come back to that. What were your tasks and chores? 
JY: I can remember one of the first things I had to do was feed the cows their grain, which is still my job 
here a lot of the time. Dad had a station set up where I’d weight the grain out and take it to the cows 
and put it down in front of them. Little bit later, would end of taking care of calves and feeding some of 
them milk, some of them water, hay, grain whatever. Some of the time I needed to wheel the silage 
around. At that point we didn’t have an automatic silo unloader so my two brothers were the two silo 
unloaders. So they’d be up above, throwing it down and then I get it in the wheelbarrow and then I’d 
wheel it around and put it down for the cows. But then, before that got really established as a long term 
job for us—because my dad has done it all before— dad did an expansion and ended up with a milking 
parlor. So things started going different. So really once they got the milking parlor, I didn’t have a lot to 
in the barn, other than helping take care of calves. 
HH: What time would this have been— 
JY: That was the mid-60s.  
HH: Okay. And that’s when you started getting the new equipment and things like that.  
JY: Yes. 
[0:18:05]  
HH: Okay. So tell me about this farm now. Tell me about how many animals you have and what kind of 
systems you use. 
6 
 
HY: We have 62 tie stalls for cows. So we run, say about, 60 cows. This past summer we had actually 
more than 62, but the cows were outside—the dry cows were. And sometimes we get down into the 
50s. About 60 milk cows. And we run about a hundred head in total. And that’s counting right down to 
the little calves. And I think that’s what we have right now, is exactly a hundred. Or we did at the first of 
the year. Our system is a tie stall barn with a pipeline milker. Which means no longer having to use 
bucket milks and lifting up milk and all that sort of thing. But it’s not the parlor type system or a free 
stall. We do about 35 acres of corn. This year we did 35 acres of corn silage. It’s usually 30-35, which we 
put in upright silos. And we do some grass silage in the silos as well.    We do a fair number of small 
square bales yet, which is getting outdated, I guess. We do basically all our own crop work, with the 
exception of maybe spraying. Versus custom hire which is becoming more of a practice too, especially 
on smaller operations.  Our production is over 20,000 pounds per cow at this point. It’s 21-something 
now. And just as a note, I was in [Cornell Cooperative] Extension 30 some years ago when the first farm 
in Lewis County went over 20,000 pounds as a herd average. That’s how much we’ve progressed. We’re 
not the top herd in the county by any means. And let’s see, we do about 75+ acres of hay and we still 
pasture cows, which is getting to be less of a thing. We do not do intensive rotational pasture. We just 
do the same things. We do cut the pasture and actually use the hay for either heifer hay or [inaudible]. 
All of the cropland except for 15 acres is right here. We have 15 acres of what’s called flats, along the 
Black River, Castorland, which is a distance away. Which is unusual for farms, people that aren’t from 
Croghan to understand, because a lot of the farms in the Croghan area had land on the Black River 
floodplain. Locally we call them flats, in the Lowville to towards Carthage vicinity. It’s very productive 
land, but it’s very wet. If the river comes up, it floods. It’s that simple. Apparently, the history of it is, it 
may very good horse hay. So farmers would go down there, they’d cut the hay. There were typically 
barns along the river there where you stored the hay. Then in the wintertime when you could bring it up 
with a sleight they went down and got it. Typically in Christmastime, or early January. And we still have 
15 acres of it. It’s very poor quality by today’s standards.  It’s high yielding, if you can get it.  
HH: So you do use it for hay. 
HY: We use it primarily for bedding. Now this year we were short [inaudible]. We’re using the better 
part of it for hay for the heifers. And we got a few times stuck getting it! But everybody over to Lowville 
and that area laughs at our flats, but I always kid ‘em and say, “Yeah but you know all we do is pay taxes 
on it. You guys fertilize it; you guys lime it, because every time it floods, it brings nutrients from you 
guys!” [Yanceys laugh] If you could cut it early enough— it’s reeds canary grass. It’s very nutritious if you 
can cut it early enough. But if you can’t get it early enough, it gets to be very fibrous. It’s high yielding. If 
we went there first thing and got our first cutting, it might be good. But a lot of times it’s too wet and it’s 
too far away. So you do— 
JY: —stuff around the home first. 
HY: But that’s kind of a phenomenon that’s unique to the Croghan area. 
[0:23:52]  
7 
 
HH: Interesting. So the land that you have now, does that date back to when your family first got here or 
have you expanded over the years? 
HY: They expanded. We haven’t—we bought one forested chunk since we’ve been here. The land, yes it 
did. I can’t give you dates. I think it was in the 50s when they bought the [Jaycox?] lot. And then there’s 
some other add-on lots that, there’s one back here that my uncle’s always referred to as the “fifteen 
acre lot,” which I assume was bought after the farm. We’ve got five parcels here and I think that’s how 
they became separate parcels, because pieces got added. We’re fairly unique in that all of our land is 
basically the same soil type. Which is a little bit unusual in the Northeast, I guess. 
[0:24:50]  
HH: I was noticing as I was coming up here, all the boulders and rocks and everything. Does that affect 
your soil type? 
HY: It would, yeah.  But we don’t have any big boulders, well we do down next to the river in the woods. 
We’re basically a— our soil is Colton loamy fine sand. And when they drilled my uncle’s well for the 
house over there, they drilled through 60 feet of sand, then they hit granite. I think granite is 
underneath everything and we’re fairly flat here with very, very sandy soil. Our problem is not drainage, 
our soils can be too droughty if anything. And your soil type would be determined partially by what’s 
underneath.  
[0:25:48]  
HH: Okay. Now you also have the sugar bush [maple syrup operation]. And do you also do work in the 
woods. Do you sell timber? 
HY: Yes. 
HH: Ca n you talk about how the overall economy of the farm works? You have the dairy, the sugar 
bush, the woodlot and is there anything else in the mix?  
HY: We did balsam boughs at one time.  
JY: That was a long time ago. 
HY: That was our Christmas money. That’s how our kids helped get Christmas money. No, the dairy is 
probably at this point, big enough to support a single family. But not necessarily big enough to support 
with Tim as a separate unit —right now he’s just by himself. So the sugar bush is always, in the past, 
probably supported the dairy more than the other way around. To be perfectly honest, my uncles put up 
with the cows so that they could work in the woods and do the sugar bush. And I think if the ancestors 
wouldn’t have rolled over in their graves, they would have gotten rid of the cows. They were not cow 
lovers by any means [laughs]. So in the past, it’s probably what kept the farm going. After we got here, 
we did more with the dairy. Some because of the arrangement with my uncle and the sugar bush and 
whatnot. But at this point, with Tim here, it would be difficult to keep going if we didn’t do something in 
8 
 
the woods and the sugar bush. Now last year the sugar bush, the sugaring season was basically a 
disaster. But dairying is a little bit better. And we got involved cutting some pine here this fall, then got 
behind doing other work. And right now Tim is up in the woods skidding out some logs we cut Saturday 
and I just talked to the buyer this morning and he’s gonna come Thursday or Friday. We do have a lot of 
timber on the property. The property was never really cut off to any great extent. In fact, up until a 
neighbor down here was allowed on the property to cut, it was basically cut by family. He is a very good 
conscientious logger, he works just by himself. He’s got an old skidder, an old log loader, they’re paid 
for. If he wants to go hunting or he wants to talk to somebody, then he does. But the way he works in 
the woods, instead of seeing how much he can get out how fast and doing a lot of damage, he takes his 
time. He does a very nice job. And except for stumps and limbs, you wouldn’t know he’d been there. So 
there’s a lot of timber— plus the maples were never cut until they had to be. That’s maybe just a hair of 
an overstatement. But they basically didn’t get harvested. In the 40s a lot of sugar bushes were cut off in 
this area because, it was called the Block Mill, but it’s now become AMF bowling. They cut a lot of sugar 
bushes in the area for bowling pins in the 40s. I don’t remember the dollar amount, but I do know they 
were offered a significant amount of money to cut the sugar bush here and they didn’t do it. Going back 
to ever since the sugar bush started, you did everything you could to protect the maples. That’s why we 
still have great big old trees out in the middle of the fields that are a pain in the neck! 
JY: As far as farming goes, yeah. 
HY: But for us, the sugar bush and cutting some logs— we have a low budget operation. We have— we 
stepped up. We did use a 1979 truck and now we’ve got a 1994. And we use the farm tractor with a 
skidding winch on it that we bought 25 years ago probably. And the tractor front end loader to load and 
a couple of chainsaws. And that’s our equipment. But we don’t put out a lot of stuff either. It’s definitely 
a supplement to the dairy. In a year like 2009, it was a tough year on dairy. Very very tough year on 
dairy. Everybody went backwards. Sugar bush and some logs helped, even though logging was not good 
then either. There’s kind of a saying among the older farmers around here. ‘When milk is down, maybe 
syrup is up.’ That sort of thing. Well, some years everything is down! [Yanceys laugh] As a stand-alone 
dairy with one family and not a tremendous amount of debt, we’d be okay. But now trying to do two 
households and whatnot… And we enjoy it. 
[31:50]  
HH: What are the main jobs that have to be done and who does what? What is the division of labor? You 
don’t have any hired hands— 
HY: Not now, we did have a kid up until he left school. 
JY: We had him before Tim came back. At that point we really needed somebody and we kept him on 
then. 
HY: Well some of us are getting older. 
JY: Yeah. Just a little bit. 
9 
 
HH: Was he someone who has grown up on a farm? 
HY: He was a neighbor kid. And he did pretty well, really. 
JY: Yeah, most of the time. Just on occasion he’d be a little bit— 
HY: —Oversleep! [Yanceys laugh] Well Tim does the morning milking, I do the night milking. I go out in 
the morning and sleep up and feed the cows some hay and then scrape down behind the cows. And 
then Tim does the milking. She feeds the hay and feeds the grain. So she still has the same job she had 
when she was a kid. And I take the manure out. 
HH: You have a solid manure system? 
HY: Yes. 
HH: You have one of those, what is it called? The gutter cleaner? 
HY: Yup. And daily spreading, we don’t have storage. And then we finish up, we have to bed the cows 
and Tim feeds the silage in the morning. 
JY: Grass silage. 
HY: Grass silage, yup. Feed the heifers hay and stuff too. And then at night, Tim feeds the corn silage. He 
takes care of his horses all the time.  
HH: You got the horses in the past couple of years? 
HY: Yeah.  
JY: 2010. No wait. 
HY: We got those first. 
JY: Yeah you did, but I’m trying to remember.  Yes  2010. November 2010. 
HY: There’s a story to this. She went in the hospital; we bought a team of horses. Tim did really. She 
went in the hospital again; we bought a furnace. She went in the hospital again; we bought a manure 
spreader! Next time she goes in, we’re buying a tractor! She hasn’t gone in since. [laughs] 
[0:34:54] HH: Now you got the horses and do they work the fields? Or is it just for the sugar bush? 
HY: Just the sugar bush basically and recreation. Yeah we haven’t done any farm work with them. Not 
saying we couldn’t. Of course most of the horse-drawn equipment we sold to the Amish. As far as farm 
equipment. It was all been years since it’d been used anyways. Sugar bush really. We’ve talked about 
using them to skid logs a little bit, but nobody has done it. 
[35:30] HH: I’m really interested, you’re saying that the dairy operation that you have can support you, 
because what a lot of people have said, the way that the pricing system for milk works, it’s impossible to 
10 
 
have a small farm. You have to intensify, you have to increase, you have to do the specialized feeding, 
you have to expand. So how have you made it work? Do you think it is true that for some they are 
forced into that or is it a matter of what kind of lifestyle— 
JY: I think it’s a couple things there. We have never been ones, and maybe we should be, and think 
money is the first thing. So have sometimes lived on a little less than what some other people would be 
happy with. 
HY: One lender asks us how much money do you take out of the farm for living expenses, and we 
basically told him, ‘whatever’s left.’ And he expected we were going to say, ‘well we pull out so much,’ 
but when we were young the 60s, early 70s and whatnot, thirty cow farms were on the small side, but 
were still there. They’re pretty much gone now. And the 50-60 cow farm is maybe becoming that. You’re 
looking at more towards 100, I’m not sure that you have to go to 500, 1,000 or anything like that, but I 
don’t begrudge people that do it. We don’t want to put up with the labor issues. That’s part of it with us. 
And I think Tim feels the same way. We want to be what the family can handle. Well, the other side of 
the coin is, with milking parlors, freestall barns and total mixed rations now, the family can have a lot 
more cows that they could in the past. And you are with the price of equipment and everything, it’s 
getting so you have to have more cows just to purchase a tractor. So there’s an element of truth to it. 
Now I’ve never had a brand new tractor. And that’s some of the different. We’ve got used tractors, and 
in fact I’m not even sure what our newest one would be, it’d be before 2000, definitely. And we’ve got 
one tractor or two tractors that are still here that were here when we came. And one was the big tractor 
when we came, now it’s the small one we use. And we really need, if we’re going to keep doing our own 
silage, we really need a 150—160 horse tractor and our big one’s 110. Which it does the job— 
JY: —Just. 
HY: You go out and look at em, $80,000 if you want something that is new or almost new. So there is 
truth to it and if you’re gonna put in a parlor, milking parlor, which is a lot easier to milk in than it is in 
our tie stall barn, in fact she can’t milk, or won’t! 
JY: You were told when you put the addition on that barn that if that’s the way you were going, I wasn’t 
milking. 
HY: But you’re talking a lot of money. And you’ve got to then have production units to pay for it.  So I 
don’t know why some of them never stop, ‘cause that’s the story. First you get more cows, then their 
parlor isn’t big enough so they build a bigger parlor. Then they can milk more cows so they get more 
cows, and then their parlor isn’t big enough, so they get a bigger parlor! [laughs] And they just keep 
going! I don’t know. You become not so much a hands-on farmer as much as a plant manager, to some 
extent. And I guess we’ve always been, get-your-hands-dirty kind of people.  Some is availability too. For 
us, it would be difficult for us to get more land. Most of the farmland is in use here and that’s not 
necessarily true of the whole state. But in this area, in fact, before Tim came back I had two different 
people who wanted to know if we wanted to either lease the farm to them or sell to them. And that’s 
not even counting the third place that all we’d have to do is drop a hint that we might be interested and 
we’d have someone here the next— maybe the same day! Not mentioning any names! [Yanceys laugh]

[0:41:15]  
HH: Haskell, you said you didn’t actually grow up on a dairy, but you spent summers working. So how did 
you learn and gain the skills— 
HY: The practical. Well, I had a pretty good crop understanding. And the neighbor that I worked for was 
a very good guy to work for and very good farmer at the time. And I guess if he were alive he’d probably 
would be today too. The animals I had to learn. I didn’t have a whole lot of experience with equipment 
in terms of fixing things. Dad always took stuff someplace and got it fixed. Her family was a big help. We 
had a neighbor here too that was really good about helping us. Not necessarily here doing something, 
but with advice and he kind of knew the situation here. When we came here, we didn’t have a lot of 
equipment. The equipment was— 
JY:—very basic. 
HY: And the farm, I mean there were eighteen cows here when we came. Typically there would have 
been more than that, but that was what there was when we came. And the barn would hold 34 at the 
most. And that was including places where there were heifers. Us putting cows. And the neighbor put 
the corn in for ‘em, which was like 10 acres at the time. 
JY: And harvested it for them. 
HY: Yeah. So we learned some things the hard way. We made mistakes.  
[0:43:12]  
HH: And what did you study at Cornell?  
HY: I had Agricultural Economics, Farm Management major. Now it’s Applied Economics. I found that 
out a year and a half ago. And Animal Science. 
JY: Yeah, you majored in both. 
HY: It would have been dairy, but Animal Science. 
HH: So you knew when you went to Cornell that you did want to— 
HY: I almost didn’t go. This is what I wanted to do. My intentions, we did look a couple other places at 
one time when things weren’t working out here. I mean this was a family arrangement, they don’t 
always go well. [laughs]  
HH: Pros and cons. 
HY: So far it’s going well, but it has its moments there too! 
[0:44:10]  
HH: Your children, when they were growing up, were they active in the farm? 
12 
 
JY: Very much. 
HH: And did Tim always know that this is what he wanted to do? 
JY: I don’t think so. 
HY: Not that he told us! 
[All laugh] 
HY: Some other people knew more about it than we did! 
JY: That night I took him up, when he was going to on his trip out to the Rockies and Canada. We had 
supper and he says, —he was just before his senior year of college— “Well I wanted to work someplace 
else for a few years,” but then he thought he wanted to come back to the farm. That’s the first time I 
had ever heard of it. No, we didn’t know. We didn’t know where it was going.  
HY: But Beth has always said that if somebody else didn’t do the sugar bush, she was going to. She’s the 
oldest. She just had her baby, and not hopefully going home. We tried. Some farm kids have to come 
home and work on the farm. There’s no after-school business. We told them they could do a couple 
sports, each one if they wanted, be involved in some things. 
JY: We tried to work it so they got to do some things that weren’t all farm things because we knew some 
families that basically said, “Kids have to come home after school and work on the farm.” End of story. 
And it’s help on the farm, but I know several of them that the kids aren’t on the farms now. They have 
no desire to do that. 
HY: They didn’t help in the barn in the morning before school. After school at night, they did. 
[0:46:10]  
HH: They help with the milking or the feeding? 
HY: Feeding and throwing down hay, depended on ages and who was here. 
JY: Because often somebody was at a sport some place. 
HY: And well Kathy was behind, or younger. 
JY: So she didn’t have to do as much, or a lot of the stuff as she was growing up. But once the other two 
were gone… [laughs] 
HY: And then they helped in the summer with crops and stuff. 
JY: Haying. They all know how to unload and pile hay. 
HY: In fact, Beth outworked the one hired man we had. 
13 
 
JY: Oh, more than once. 
[0:47:03]  
HH: So when did you have, did you have in your— 
JY: Well we’ve had several hired kids. Basically since we moved up here we had somebody most of the 
time. 
HY: In the summers at least, but not necessarily— 
JY: But not year ‘round. 
HY: And of of ‘ems four kids are there on that Christmas card. He’s the one we had the longest. 
JY: I think so. Yeah, ‘cause we tried to live with the rules of how you hire and stuff. And so we said, “Well 
we want to the stuff for your working papers,” and he says, “Oh I forgot it.” And so we let him work that 
day. Well, he kept forgetting it for about a week and a half and then he says, “I’m 14 now!” [Yanceys 
laugh]. But we was such a big kid, you never would have dreamed he wasn’t 15 or 16! 
HY: And the only reason he started working here was because his mother was trying to get him out of 
the house. Then he stayed and stayed and stayed. He came back after he graduated when he didn’t 
have anything else for a while. We have some great stories about him. 
HH: Yeah, do you want to share them? 
HY: Well, he lost his pants once going in the silo! [All laugh] 
HH: How did that happen? 
HY: He climbed in the silo and the silage was down from the door. The doors are not quite 2 1/2’ high 
and about 2’ wide. Anyhow somehow his pants came undone, and he kind of went in head—first, and 
they caught on something and his feet were up there and his head was down there! 
HH: Oh my gosh! 
HY: Somehow he got out of it. It’s a lot better story when he tells it. And then there was the time he 
went looking for— not all the cows came to the barn for night milking. So he went looking for them. And 
it was in the fall when the leaves and crunchy and rustly and make a lot of noise. And he was up in the 
woods there looking for them. And he heard all this rustling way ahead of him. So he thought it was the 
cows walking through the leaves. So he speeded up. And when he did, they speeded up. And he 
speeded up again, and then they speeded up again. And so on, until they got out into the clearing down 
there and when he came out there— it was a flock of turkeys! [laughs] And I told him, “Steve, you can’t 
tell the difference between turkeys and cows!” 
[0:49:46]  
14 
 
HH: With the high school kids are there certain restrictions as to what they can do? 
HY: Yes. 
HH: Now has that changed? 
JY: It’s getting a little stricter all the time. 
HY: They talked about changing it a lot here this past summer. 
HH: Yeah, I heard about— 
HY: But then they didn’t do it. But yeah, they’re restricted, size of tractors they can use, they’re not 
supposed to go up silos, chainsaws of course.  
HH: So that pants story would never have happened— 
HY: I don’t know what age that was it happened, to be honest! 
HH: Does it go to 18, or 16? 
HY: 14 and 15— 
JY: There are certain things you can do at 14 and 15. You can do more at 16 and then you can do 
anything at 18. 
HY: Like bulls. They can’t be around bulls. Dangerous livestock, I guess. We’ve had some good kids. We 
had a couple questionable ones. And we used to have kids to help with the haying before our kids. And 
then of course before Tim came back it was getting to be enough for us to do. The two of us. 
[0:51:06]  
HH: And when did Tim come back? 
HY: Is this the fourth year? 
JY: I think it was the beginning of 2009. He actually— yeah, I think so. He’s starting his fifth year now. 
HY: Fifth year? Hmm. 
JY: Yeah, because me being so sick and stuff. He’d been here more than a year by the time I got so sick. 
So that was in 2009. He graduated in 2006 from college. 
HY: Probably. 
[0:52:00]  
HH: Where did he go to school? 
15 
 
JY: He went to [SUNY] Geneseo. 
[Haskell whispers inaudibly] 
JY: Yes he did. 
HH: Really? Okay. 
[0:52:17]  
HH: What year did you come to the farm? 
HY: 1982. 
HH: ’82. And you said there were 18 cows then. 
HY: That’s what were here the day we started. 
[0:52:40]  
HH: Have any of your other systems or ways of doing things changed significantly. 
JY: Yeah. 
HY: Yeah, we had bucket milkers at that time. There wasn’t a gutter cleaner in the barn.  
JY: There was no silo unloader. 
HY: No silo unloader. There was just one small silo anyway.  
JY: The silo unloader was the first thing we did. And the gutter cleaner was the second major thing we 
did. 
HY: Bulk tank too. We changed the bulk tank. We changed the bulk tank early on. It was a small tank. 
And we kept getting bigger equipment as far as field work. 
JY: Usually— I think almost always— we’ve bought a couple brand new things. We bought two new hay 
bines and one new rake. And everything else has been used equipment that we purchased. I’m pretty 
sure—well, the winch. And your claw was brand new. 
HY: But those two— 
JY: —are for your woods operation. 
HY: And there was not chopping equipment to do silage. The neighbor did that. And he used our corn 
planter too. And then we went to a dumping station. Before that you carried the milk into the milk 
house and poured it into the tank. But then we got the dumping station from your family. 
JY: Yup. Uncle Bob had that. 
16 
 
HY: And I used that until we built on the barn, which was in ’93. That’s when we expanded from 34 cows 
to the potential 60. Or 62 actually. Everything was based on 55 cows when we built the barn on. But 
then there was— we came up with more room didn’t we?  
JY: Ed did. [Yanceys laugh] 
0:54:56 
HH: Do you feel like the nature of your work has changed since ’82? With these changes in equipment 
and things like that? 
HY: Mhm. 
JY: Yeah. I mean they used to literally pick— what you had was a wagon, a manure spreader that the 
horses pulled. And then you had a sleigh. 
HY: Yeah, but we didn’t use that. We had the tractor spreader.  
JY: Okay. That’s right. 
HH: You never worked with horses, except in the— 
HY: Not after we got here. But prior years, they had taken manure out with the horses. Like the Amish 
do now. I think it was the year before we came they got the first tractor-drawn manure spreader. 
Because they had to buy that little John Deere tractor to get through the barn. And that was what was 
here when we came. And we’re doing more—we’re actually doing more bales than we did when we 
came here. But we’re doing more silage. The place was run down, plain and simple.  
JY: Truthfully, if you had looked at operations around Lewis County and said, “A ton of these are 
probably gonna have to go.” You know, this would have been one of them. 
HY: You know my uncles kind of stopped changing in the late ’50s or ‘60s. That was part of it. And they 
were elderly. Ervin would have been 80 when— When was his birthday? 
JY: His birthday was later in September. 
HY: Yeah. He would have been 80. 
JY: When he was killed by the bull. 
HY: I don’t know how old Joe was. But anyhow, it’s been shown that, at least when I was in school. They 
talked about when farmers reached 55, the farm started to go downhill if there was no next generation 
coming. Because you stop making changes. And instead of buying another tractor, you used what you 
had. Because you figured, ‘Well I’ve only got a few more years and then I’ll be gone.’ And that’s what 
happened here. Only thing, nobody came along sooner. 
[0:57:32]  
17 
 
HH: But you were willing to take on the challenge. 
HY: Yeah. There was potential here. There was potential here. There was, doing more with the cropland 
and— I said we had the same soil type on just about the whole farm. The neighbor right up next door 
has the next soil type. Only thing’s there’s a fence line down through. And he was doing a lot of things 
that they weren’t doing here. So you could see the potential. And he’s the same one that— 
JY: —would help so much. We have another neighbor now who helps out a lot. But in a different 
direction. 
HH: What do you mean? 
HY: Oh there’s a neighbor over here on the Erie Canal Road that we work together on some stuff. 
HH: Is that the— I passed this interesting-looking farm? What’s it called, Moo Acres or something like 
that? 
HY: White barn with green roofs. That’s his thing, white buildings and green roofs. In fact, we bought 
this truck mainly because he wanted us to buy it! And his wife wouldn’t let him! [Yanceys laugh] She 
didn’t have a choice.  No but we’re back and forth. He’s used the truck more than we have. We just 
bought it not quite a year ago. And he’s used it more than we have. But we use his stuff. Our corn 
planter’s over in his tool shed. 
HH: So you do share stuff? 
HY: Yeah, we don’t share as much as we did at one time. Before we got the Case tractor. This chopper— 
we used to have to bring his chopper up sometimes. He used to come up and chop corn and he— 
because he said he liked to chop corn! And we have an argument, I jokingly tell people we have an 
argument every year about who came out better. And he says he did, and I say we did. And we both 
agree that, well whatever. He’s a very good neighbor. If we needed something he’s be up here as soon 
as he could get there.  
[0:59:54]  
HH: And this other neighbor that you learned from, do you think he— how would you describe that 
relationship, would you call him a mentor? 
HY: Yeah. Because his granddaughter’s on the farm now. And his son was for quite a while. Yeah, he 
knew my uncles and understood them.  
JY: They [the uncles] were good people, but they weren’t always easy to get along with. 
HY: You trying to say there’s something the matter with the Yanceys? 
JY: You got stubborn and bullheaded from someplace, yeah! [laughs] 
HY: [inaudible] just my mother? [Yanceys laugh] 
18 
 
[1:00:43]  
HH: You think your family was pleased that you went into dairy farming? 
JY: I think parts of them were pleased, parts of them were dismayed. But, yeah I think so. I think dad was 
really happy that they still have someone in farming, especially after the boys went off the farm. 
HY: And they’d have been happier if it’d been out there. 
JY: Oh yeah. 
HY: We’re 300 miles apart, the families.  
JY: And she’s the farthest one from home. Yeah, and I think your dad would have enjoyed being a part of 
it if we were closer, if we were close enough. Either they were up here or we were down there. 
JY: Yeah. 
HHL: Are you pleased that Time has decided to work here? 
HY: Yeah, I think so. We kind of—we ‘re glad to see it continue in the family. 
[1:01:48]  
HH: I just have a few more questions for now, if that’s all right. It’s okay? 
JY: It’s alright. 
[1:02:00]  
HH: I hope this doesn’t sound funny, but how would you describe your relationship with your animals? 
With your cattle and has that changed over the years? 
HY: Not as familiar with them as individuals, maybe, as you used to be. The good ones, the non— I 
jokingly tell people that the only ones that have names are the ones you’re mad at! [laughs] Not quite as 
much individually. There’s a lot that don’t stand out for one reason or another. They’re the ones that 
don’t kick or don’t give you problems, basically pretty good animals. You kind of know the best ones and 
the ones that give you trouble. Since we really don’t have names anymore. Since the kids have gone, we 
quite naming. But when the kids were here, there was “LG”and “LG’s Baby,” and so on. 
HH: “LG’s Baby” was the baby’s name? 
JY: First there was Lucy. And then there was LB, which meant Lucy’s baby. And then there was LG, which 
meant Lucy’s grandbaby. So yeah. [laughs] 
HH: That’s cute. 
19 
 
HY: There are not as many individuals that stand out to you even though they, maybe there’s just as 
many, there’s just others that don’t particularly stand out now. We had one that the one guy that 
worked in the sugar bush, the one older fella. He’d always ask, “You still got that cow you had?!” And I 
knew exactly which one he meant and I said, “Yup, and I still don’t like her!” [Yanceys laugh] 
JY: That was LG. 
HY: There was one out there, that I— 
JY: 373 or 374? 
HY: 374 
JY: Okay, that’s who you’re talking about. 
HY: I saved her life once and I regretted it ever after! I don’t know how she got herself tangled up like 
that? 
HH: What did she do? 
HY: There a pipe that goes down though in front with a chain on it, that goes around their neck chain. 
And then they have dividers in between cows so they can’t steal from one another. And anyhow, she 
had a knack for jumping over the pipe. Which is one of the things that made me mad about her. We 
anyway, she went to do that one night when I was here all by myself, and she went most of the way 
over and then her foot got caught in the divider. So she was there with her head bent backwards on the 
floor as far as it could go and the chain just as tight around her neck as it could be. And her foot stuck, so 
she couldn’t go the rest of the way. Now I don’t know how she did it. I don’t think you could do it if you 
tried. Anyhow, she was stuck there. And I worked and worked and worked. I pulled— I tried everything I 
could think of. I couldn’t unsnap the chain, I forgot what I did do. I guess I finally got her foot loose.  
JY: I thought you said you did something with the come-alongs, and brought her backwards… 
HY: I don’t remember for sure what I did, but I was wringing wet with sweat. And she was gasping for 
breath. One of the thoughts I was having the whole time was, ‘Should I just slit her throat and let her 
bleed out here and then we’ll use her for beef?’ Anyhow I got her out after a while. Ohh, what a time. 
HH: Well, I’m sure she appreciated it. 
HY: I don’t know if she did or not! 
HH: She did in her heart of hearts. 
HY: She was a good cow. She gave a lot of milk for a long time. 
[1:06:13]  
HH: Do you use natural insemination or artificial? 
20 
 
HY: Artificial insemination. 
HH: Do you keep track of their— 
HY: Mhm. There was a bull here when we came. We kept him for a while and then he started to get so 
he would just stare at you. We kind of said, “Okay, we’re gonna have little kids here and he’s just 
starting to get that look that maybe he’s gonna go down the road,” and then we never got another one. 
We did start to raise one once that we thought we might keep because sometime a bull can catch cows 
that artificial insemination doesn’t work on. And that same Steve started to teach it to butt! 
HH: What was that, sorry I— 
HY: Steve was here at the time and he was teaching it, letting it butt him. It’s just a smaller calf. 
HH: Was that a high school kid you had? 
HY: Yeah.  And Steve used to wrestle— And the calf wasn’t big enough, Steve used to wrestle in the over 
250 pound class, so he was no little guy. And I told him, “Steve, that’s not gonna be funny when he gets 
big!” But anyhow, we got rid of him. And we haven’t had one since.  That was one of the reason we sold 
cows, truthfully, because we couldn’t get them pregnant.  
[1:08:03]  
HH: So you have someone come and do that or do you do that yourself? 
HY: We have someone come do it. I’ve never taken a course. Tim’s had the option to a couple times and 
opted not to.  
[1:08:18]  
HH: Do you eat some of your cows? It’s part of how you— 
HY: Yeah. 
HH: Basically when they get— 
HY: We try to choose a little bit, but sometimes— 
JY: Something like what he was saying, something happens to somebody and whatever it is, it’s not 
something that will affect the quality of the meat. 
HY: It might not be great quality, but it’s still usable. You do that versus dog food, which is essentially 
you get nothing. 
JY: Not essentially, you do get nothing. You get nothing and someone you have to pay and take them 
away. 
21 
 
HY: If they’re in the barn and they have to pull them out of the barn, you have to pay. And they have to 
be dead. You’re not supposed to drag a live animal. So you try to get them out of the barn yourself if you 
can. There was one cow here that our youngest said that if she was going to be a vegetarian, when we 
were eating her, that was one nobody talked about. The one we were eating that time. She said that 
would have done it.  
JY: She was a bit of a pet. It was a little hard. 
[1:09:48] 
HY: On the other hand there’s been a couple I said, “Boy, I could enjoy eating you!” [all laugh]. Cows 
have personalities, very much personalities. And some are very good personalities and some are… not. 
We’ve only— on the other hand, we’re kidding around and we’re laughing and talking about it, we’ve 
only ever sold one cow, basically because we just got to the point we didn’t want to milk her anymore. 
Maybe want to isn’t the right word. I don’t want to say could, because we could. And that one kicked 
Beth pretty good. That one, the first time she calved, we monkeyed with her for a long, long time and 
then finally just happened to put another one that she has stood next to growing up, beside her, and 
then she calmed right down. And then she was fine. We said, “Oh, okay. Maybe we’re through this, 
maybe she’ll be fine.” The second time she calved, we started all over. And she was just like she was the 
first time.  
JY: And she would kick with purpose. Some of them are flipping their feed to knock the machine off and 
they happen to hit you. But this one— 
HY:—was trying to hurt you. 
JY: —was trying to hurt you. So she did go down the road. 
HY: I had the doctor look at my big toe once and he said, “What’s the matter with that?” And I said, 
“Well I dropped a block of wood one it once a long time ago, and plus it’s been stepped on a bunch of 
times.” And he said, “Oh, cows do that?” And I said, “Oh yeah, some of them do it intentionally.” And he 
said, “Oh, some cows are...”  I forgot how he put it. Schizophrenic? And I said, “Yup!” No, that’s the one 
thing about farming. It’s awfully easy to do something stupid.   
JY: And get hurt. 
HY: And get hurt. And we’ve all done stupid things. But we haven’t been seriously hurt. 
[Hannah coughing] 
JY: Do you need to take a break? 
[1:12:25]  
22 
 
HH: I guess we should just wrap it up here. I thought I was going to be better today. I’ll just ask a few 
more questions. Maybe you’ve already answered this, but what is the most challenging aspect of dairy 
farming for you? For both of you. 
HY: I guess you never get done. No matter how much you do, there’s always something more you should 
be doing. And I laugh because, I don’t like to make lists of jobs, because all you do it keep adding to it. 
And you cross off one item and write down two! And then some other things come up that aren’t on the 
list. We’ve got a list of fall jobs we haven’t finished yet, and I think probably, that’s as a general thing, 
there’s always something you feel like you should be doing. You never can say, ‘There, we’re done, we 
can goof off now for a week.’ Some of it is, we aren’t using brand new equipment a lot and there’s 
always the worse sound you can hear when you walk in the barn in the morning is water running. ‘Cause 
you know something is either apart or broke and you look to see how much water is there. 
JY: We’ve not had a bad one in a while. Where is some wood? [knocks and laughs] No, we had a little 
one here last month. 
HY: Now it’s your turn now. 
JY: What’s the most challenging? I think at times, most challenging is sitting down and getting the bills all 
paid. At times. At times it’s not a big problem. And that’s really, really nice. But there’s times you’re 
sitting in there going, “Where do we do what first?” And at one point to we say that we’ll call the lender 
and make sure we get everything paid. We don’t like to let things run for very long. We will for just a 
little bit sometimes.  
[1:15:13]  
HH: Is that you job primarily or do you do that together? The bills. 
JY: I pretty much do the bills. When we’re getting touchy like that, I usually list them all out and we talk 
it over. If it looks like everything is pretty well straightforward, I just go ahead and do it. 
HY: Yeah. She makes out most of the checks. We usually talk about things we’re gonna do. Sometimes 
we go off and buy a wood splitter or something. 
JY: Yeah, sometimes you do, don’t you? [all laugh] That one kind of came out of the blue on me. I heard 
him talking about it, I heard him make a phone call, but, ‘we’re going!’ And then they came home with 
it, well they couldn’t physically bring it home, but they had purchased it.  
HY: She didn’t go in the hospital that time either! 
JY: No, I didn’t! Or even go to the doctor or anything! [Yanceys laugh] 
[1:16:10]  
HH: So what keeps you wanting to farm? What do you like most about it? 
23 
 
HY: I guess you’re your own boss is some of it. You can, you look at the calf and it’s the calf you helped, 
well maybe you helped maybe you didn’t help it. Those are cows you raised, those are crops you raised. 
Milk in the tank is milk you produced. You aren’t doing it for just dollars. I always get a certain amount of 
enjoyment looking at a pile of wood, a bunch of syrup, hay mow full of hay. 
JY: Knowing that the silo if full. You don’t go up very often anymore. 
HY: No, I don’t climb silos too much anymore. I have a limit. She tells me, once a day. I haven’t even 
been up a silo in quite a while. 
JY: Tim’s been doing it. He still can easily, relatively easily at this point anyway. I don’t think climbing 
silos is ever easy.  
HY: Used to be easier! 
HH: I don’t quite understand it. Do you climb up from inside? 
HY: Yeah, the metal chute. Well, there’s a ladder on the outside too. But we don’t use that, except 
maybe filling if you have to get something in the silo. 
JY: I don’t know if you can see over here, there’s the round part that’s on the— that’s what they call the 
chute. And inside that are the doors that open up into the silo. And basically each door has two rungs on 
it, and you just go up like a straight ladder, not a slanted ladder. 
HY: And you can lean back against— 
JY: —the chute if you need to. Inside. 
HH: Wherever the level of what’s in it, you go to the door— 
HY: You have to have an open door for the unloader to throw, these silos. Now we’re gonna get into top 
unloaders and bottom unloaders. 
[1:18:44]  
HH: Do you have any, how do I want to ask this? Where do you see dairy farming in Lewis County 
heading? Are there plenty of farmers staying more moderate-sized like you? Are many expanding? 
Where do you see the landscape of dairy in Lewis County going? 
HY: Generally, bigger, I think. There are to huge farms in the county. Marks and Demko’s, and they’re 
huge. They’re talking thousands of cows. At least Marks are; I assume Demko’s are too. Oh and Hans is a 
pretty good size. But he’s not a thousand I don’t think. And then there’s a number of couple three four 
hundred size. There’s quite a few, probably 50 is on the small size and hundred cow. 
JY: 50 to 100.

HY: 50 to 100. And I think that’s where you’re gonna see more. Instead of 30 to 50 like we were talking 
about. You’re gonna see 50 to 100 and you’re gonna see the 50s gradually more in the hundreds. 
JY: Maybe up to like 120. Get a little bigger. 
HY: And then you’re gonna see the great big guys. Not everybody can handle a thousand cows. It’s like, 
what would you compare it to? Running a small business versus a large business. Being Billy Fucillo 
instead of the local dealer in Potsdam or Canton. Not everybody can be a Billy F—[local name omitted 
for privacy], thanks goodness [all laugh] I didn’t say it was good. 
[1:20:57]  
HH: Do you, every once in a while I hear about the question of migrant labor and Hispanic workers. That 
seems to be a fairly big deal here. Well, definitely in Jefferson County. Is it also in Lewis County? 
HY: I’m sure that most of the big farms— oh there’s Bel Aire’s too— have Mexicans, is what we’d say. 
Hispanics. Most of them are kind of kept under cover, because I’m not sure how legal a lot of them are. 
But I think without them, the dairy industry would not be able to expand the way it is. That’s my own 
feeling. It’s tough to get people, to hire people to do the work. It’s the issue we’ve had in the sugar bush. 
It’s hard work, you don’t pay great big wages. It’s not necessarily work, farm work especially.  
JY: Parts of it at least. 
HY: Parts of it. And if they can, people can find something better to do, I’m talking citizens, they’re 
gonna do it. Or if they find, maybe something better, we won’t say better to do. [laughs] I mean that, I 
guess, is the sad part of the whole thing: once families leave farming, for the most part they never come 
back. And that’s a little bit about what I’m saying about her family. Her brothers still have the farm 
property, even though they talked about selling some of it. And then one brother’s talking about some 
beef cows. But nobody in your family is gonna be farming.  
HH: Well you can’t really, at least in terms of dairy, I couldn’t decide to be a dairy farmer. 
HY: Well, you probably could. 
HH: I don’t know. I mean someone who hasn’t really grown up— 
JY: It happens. It’s rare, but it does happen. I’m trying to think of anybody in particular.  
HY: Yeah, there are some. And usually they work in with somebody, like if Tim wasn’t interested here, 
and then you work somebody in. But it has to be the right— even in the family it has to be the right. It 
does happen. It’s not easy to start up from scratch, without any connection or any—. I guess that’s the 
other challenging part. There’s always a place for money. There’s always something that you could 
spend money on a farm. And legitimately. Not so much buy a brand new pickup, to buy a brand new 
pickup.

JY: The old joke is somebody won a million dollar lottery and he said, “Farm ‘til it’s gone!” [laughs] 
Wouldn’t be hard to do at all. 
HY: Like we’ve talked about a tool shed here for a long time. 
JY: A long long time. 
HY: She got her kitchen, but I haven’t got my tool shed. 
JY: I know, but the kitchen was on the list first and you know it. 
[1:25:12]  
HH: You said that everyone has their own way of doing things; every farmer has their own approach. 
What do you think it takes to be a successful dairy farmer? If everyone is doing it their own way, is it 
something in the personality, is it upbringing? What do you need to bring to the job to be successful? 
HY: Practical sense. 
JY: Being stubborn and bullheaded does not hurt. 
HY: They used to say a strong back and a weak mind, but that’s not true. The strong back maybe. 
There’re a lot of skills. Everything from animals to crops to machinery to— 
JY: —buildings. 
HY: Yeah. You don’t have to be the best at everything, but you’ve got to have some ability at a lot of 
things. And you’ve got to know when to say, ‘This is something I’ve got to get someone else here for.’ 
And I guess you’ve got to be— you can be too frugal because you’ve got to spend money to make 
money. But you don’t have to have the brand new tractor. You’ve got to have what you need. And it’s 
easy to get caught up in “the neighbor bought a tractor so I’m gonna buy a little bit bigger one.” And 
that’s what I tell her. If Arlen buys something, then I’ve got to buy something bigger. 
JY: I don’t listen to that. 
HY: And so you’ve got to be able to sort through what you need and what you want and what you would 
like, is part of it. And you’ve gotta be dedicated to it. You can’t say, “Oh I won’t worry about this, I won’t 
worry about that, I’m gonna go—“ I guess there’s maybe an example that’s best not brought up that 
somebody was on a farm for a long time and he lost the farm. And some of it was just because he wasn’t 
there tending to the business, tending to the farm. I don’t mean the dollars and cents. And to some 
extent, it can’t, it has to more than just, it has to be kind of a family too. I mean these great big farms 
where they hire somebody to manage the dairy and somebody to manage the crops and whatnot, the 
quote unquote Boss is more or less just a Boss. I guess you have to have a spouse that’s willing to 
understand that when the cow is calving, you’re not gonna go to the concert that night! And you have to 
be ready to face that yourself. Because that’s happened already, hasn’t it? 
JY: Yes, it has.

HY: Plans change in a hurry. 
JY: Yes. And you do need to be flexible. Because very few days go as initially planned. 
HH: Well, you’re dealing with animals, and weather and all these unpredictable things.  
HY: Yeah, somebody couldn’t understand how come we get so wound up during sugaring about the 
weather, “All you gotta do is listen to the forecast!” [laughs] 
JY: You realize how often the forecast doesn’t really forecast! [laughs] 
HY: And with sugaring all it’s gotta be is a few degrees different one way or the other and it makes a lot 
of difference. Or that 50% rain. What do you do on that one? Some summers, you say, “Oh 50% rain, it’s 
not gonna rain, we’ll risk it.” And other summers— 
JY: It could say 20% rain and you’d say, “Well we hadn’t better mow it!” [Yanceys laugh] 
[1:30:10]  
HH: Has the weather been less predictable? Are these sort of trends, are you feeling this at all and how 
does it affect you? 
HY: I don’t know on the global warming. It seems sugaring is coming earlier than it used to. Whether it’s 
global warming or just a temporary trend. I mean we noticed, we’ve got the dates and we noticed back 
in the ‘20s there were a lot of early dates too. But it doesn’t, kind of sidestepping the farming I guess, 
what we seem to be getting is going from winter temperatures to summer temperatures and not getting 
spring temperatures. You go from 15 degrees to 60! And then you stay at 60, and then you go to maybe 
15 again instead of that 20—40. This summer was dry. The last previous two summers, if they said there 
was going to be a cloud in the sky, it rained. So I don’t know if it’s more unpredictable, or it just seems 
more unpredictable. The more forecast you listen to the more confused you get. 
JY: [showing a paper] This isn’t the graph— this is sugaring again.  
HY: You’re asking why we do this, it’s because we like to gamble. [laughs] That’s one of my favorite 
comments. I don’t need to go to Las Vegas, I don’t need to go to Atlantic City, I gamble every day! 
HH: Is there anything else you wanted to mention before we wrap up? 
JY: No, I think that’s it. 
[big dog bark] 
HH: Well, on that note—
