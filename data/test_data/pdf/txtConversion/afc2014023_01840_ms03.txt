planks maintained on the Alford premises in order to be able to “cut keys” for customers.

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Small but very heavily built hand press sued to push 
part out and to seat new parts/pieces into place, carefully and uniformly, under fairly high 
pressure (and hand hydraulic press would be used for very high pressure work). Note key 
blanks “keyed” to a color-coded retrieval system. [Belt driven grinder in close left fore 
ground].

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Establishing, general view of long, back work table with 
several cutting and milling machines, a long, flat work area, and the back wall with “peg 
board” color-coded key blank selections.

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Vast snake of “master” key parts – actually, very often, 
several of these are used, one after the other, to open a broken, jammed, or “orphan” lock 
whose key has gone astray.

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Dusty, less often used partial keys, hanging from a peg.

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Moderately large machine vise, solvents and oil, 
various awls & picks, files, and drivers. Tools and punches.  
 
afc2014023_1840_ph14 
Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – These milling machines can receive “code” or serial # 
information, and cut the key to conform to the recorded information, without the need for 
a physical model. The other methods and tools in the shop are used to finish the “key” 
itself.

workbench, near the key blank display. Note the several machines: cutting, grinding,

Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – Gary Alford explains and shows an example of the 
cylinder of a lock – essentially a tube with several revolving inner “rings” which turn to 
create a barrier. Once turned, the barrior prevents the pawl, peg, or latch to move. 
 
afc2012006_01520_ph20 
Alford Safe and Lock, Locksmiths – GA explains and shows an example of the keyway of the 
lock, fitted into the cylinder, so that the teeth of the key turn the tumblers which move the 
pins and create the barrier, preventing the lock from moving and “locking up” the device 
until the key is turned in another way.
