WASH TUB JUBICEE. 
WORDS AND MUSIC BY BLOSSOM & BOAC, 
Down on the old plantation. 
Where we remember mighty well; 
We had a 
great flirtation 
With those handsome colored gad. 
While ,working in de cotton patch, 
Our hearts they fairly bled; 
P,ight at the sight and we did ketch 
Around them wooley heads. 
CHORUS. 
She had such a 
lovely turned up nose, 
(BreaC).
.;;r, 
Golly what tremendous toes; 
(Break.) 
Law but didn't she suffer, 
Let it all be known and said, 
That the greatest charm about her, 
Was, around them wooley heads. 
••• 
When to her lips we kissed end pressed 
Her eyes were lovely glue; 
And when I 
saw beneath her dr,-:-; 
Her feet so black and clean, 
She is the darling of my heart. 
And tears for her I'll shed; 
But all the coons of that 
, Great big wooley head. 
Chorus and break. 
Partroxbizn AND SUNG BY HINES & BLOSSOM. 
We are two thoroughbreds from South Caralina, 
Two highly educated senators; 
On our way to Congress we have stopped to see yotto 
And our minds to fame does soar. 
We wet the people crazy 
Such speeches you will hear; 
And we will brave our way, 
And fix things up in Congress. 
Cnoars. 
For We are two thoroughbreds, 
Oh! yes, we are two thoroughbreds, 
Embassadors. ( Break.) 
Then it's oh! my, we're number one, 
Our way we'll brave when we reach Washington; 
Our style will turn their heads, 
And we show them that we are 
Two thoroughbred embassadors, 
[Break.) 
Now there isn't two more nigs in South Carolina, 
Like us two highly educated coons; 
And we will show them that 
When we reach the white house. 
That we are number one, 
And when we reach the white house 
And get within its doors, 
We will have our way and fix things, 
lip in Congress for we are two thorongheds. 
Chorus. 
COMPOSED BY MISS ADL:CASTLITON. 
Oh! forever will the evening 
Bring to me those tender eyes, 
That the twinkling stars might envy, 
In their home up in the skies. 
I 
shall see them o'er me shining, 
With their deep and holy spell; 
In the darkness and the daylight, 
Evermore they with me dwell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! those tender eyes of blue, 
Eyes that evermore are there; 
In the darkness and the daylight, 
Evermore they with me dwell. 
Years sweep o'er me, yet those blue eyes, 
Shed their charms of magic spell; 
Quiet, peaceful, and subdueing, 
Gentle as a 
snowy dove. 
Now in old age as in boyhood, 
Calm they still my trembling breast; 
Soon to lead me o'er lifo's river, 
With me ever there to rest.

All alone in my sad misery, 
He kissed me good-bye at the gate.

I am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay. 
I 
loved it and so did darling liate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow. 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view. 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
"When we played on the turnpike gate. (.1

That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'fill dark, and at sunrise in the morn.

Be home early, to-night, my dear boy.

Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For it good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend. 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I

Sure I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger. 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
Clienus. 
Paddy Duffy is my name, 
I 
will always be the same, 
Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy, 
A 
bold specimen am I, 
Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be au i

THE TRAMP. - 
RECITED BY FRANZ LIIM4 
Letame sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in ray shoe, 
Don't you commence your eusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
'Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothe., 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farLici,„ none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
lie was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, lint you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight--that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
VU tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day.

The old willow chair now so aged ind worn, 
Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so near its decay, 
Is dear to my heart in its treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was-young o'er my fevered cheek weep 
And then I 
would list ro her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the old willow chair. 
CHORUS. 
Jt rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with dig" 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayee, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
Bat mother lies told nie again and again, 
How e,.1mly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy tiles say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her old willow chair. 
OM& 
It stood in the kitchen, long. long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old will . w 
chair that our grandmother ineds, 
And wl•ere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured ot all;

relic so rare, 
AU acovorod with wobs stands the ohl willow shah.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm.; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the tarnL. 
It's sad to be az,ed and feeble, 
Aid know that this life has no ollarme, 
but when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage Ude farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our protestion, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And kel,-ey so gentle and 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions. 
In ways that bring evil and harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to be loveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm; 
We only can suffer in silence. 
Or tearfully mortgage the form.

VIO PUB. k COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LIEBER, 
It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh I 
the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
Atrud a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
HO told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
Cuouus. 
Ok, such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word 'twas really grand, 
Arul the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
baud, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig. 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
BM 
Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
'Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had coma, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus! 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun., 
broke in the sky, 
That McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
ahe'd really die, 
M'Guinuess got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
Hi felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup,

Thy loving heart will cease to yearn;

Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam,

And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a

And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to-be- sure, all the while.

That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
Ton may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can she 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Conaell and Moore I

And brave Duke of Wellington, while

O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true.

And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield,

When his war horse would enter the field;

Where such brilliant genius has been, 
there was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Mom,. 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen.

But thongh those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a

But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
put when honor demands them they valiantly fight,

Peeping with surpri-e. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
iludied is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes.

Summer ilctty is gently dawning, 
Lifting night 8

Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a

Which around her lies. 
May her future life he pure, 
Alay her sweetness never fade, 
lay grim sorrow neer secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing,

They're as brave as the shamrock is green.

There never was a

If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather blaCk poverty's storm. 
Don t

Has proved that he is a

By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true

Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a

Since Willie's left us it's so lonely, 
No more his cheery voice we hear; 
He was my darling, yes, mine only, 
For, oh! he loved his mamma dear. 
His rosy cheeks, his eyes of heavenly blue, 
The smile that round his sweet lips played, 
His curling locks of golden hue, 
But, oh! how quickly all did fade. 
CHORUS. 
Alas! they laid him in the cold, cold grave, 
His little spirit is at rest; 
one token of remembrance I 
have saved, 
'Tis a 
blossom from our Angel Willis's breast. 
While all around my boy were weeping, 
He lay so silent and so cold; 
It seemed that he was only sleeping, 
That soon he'd prattle as of old. 
I 
knew the parting moments were so near, 
His pale cold lips to mine I 
pressed, 
Upon his face I 
dropped a 
tear, 
And plucked this blossom from his breast.

PARODY ON EMPTY CRAKE, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jentiest, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties hip, 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his gm* 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizeued. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting Optailaii 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
. lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at hies, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditch**, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Cuonus. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise hias, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the clog-house-Towser's

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer. 
In the azure- tinted eky ; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Witue. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when iwilight shades the plain, 
You way tete our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness" 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to dome that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Wienie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is &tile-et of the fair, 
Oo anioes the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Toushing brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with peda, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'ator wirsome Winnie Wane.

A 
ROW OF . 
TENEMENT HOUSES. 
(MG 
BY NILES & EVANS. 
LIR: BLUE ALSATIAN mOUNTADIS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yeller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy. 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
7or the dog to chew that day.

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
In the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up town; 
She's a 
darling to me, and so pretty you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletan skirts all covered with tin, 
She's as an angel a 
soul without sin; 
She's a 
dancer, you see, in the tra-la-la-lee, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
CHORUS. 
She waltzes and pivots so neat on her t008, 
(gym) 
As '
round and 'round and 'round she goes; ( sym.) 
Now there's one thing sure I 
can't understand, 
Why her name on the bills should read 
- Madam Du Rana. 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you sea, 
And her right name is Biddy McGee. 
I 
taught her the skip, the hop, and the dip, 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would trip, 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, though I 
never could tell, 
Where she got it, or how, 'tis a 
mystery as well; 
For she's so full of glee, when dancing you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee, 
Chorus.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some huh. 
She is from the County Doww, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought. that she'd be true to me all the wit& 
but if I 
had to do it again, 
fibs would never go to swim 
Along with Inc down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the heaelt began to mile, 
'I hey all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " bloat her pat," 
'the day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier. 
We west and had Monte beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with 14trnum .s 
show, 
lint you ought to see my Peg upon the wsvalk 
The gang c 
minienced to guy us, 
My bnioni was on tire. 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mou th, 
"Beheave us" shouted out. 
(Cho 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day„ 
Of course I 
did feel mad, after listening lo that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful mart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You oan bt your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say 
a 
fight,r, a 
cutter or a 
biter 
But I 
can takJ my own part all the while. 
Arrah-tuusha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Behore I 
bring her again to Coney Isle. 
Chorus.

Oise day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief,' 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder. 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raise& 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak. 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make inn of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chore* 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
bet, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the island we are told, 
Part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
Thaes how you get served when you're old.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAIN& 
CLABABBLL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADMIN. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
lngel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Me, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alv.-ay! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
<That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Luiin mountains 
_Ever watch and wait Diway, 
A-de, A-de, A-do. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and 
alway. 
.13y the blue Alsatit mountains, 
Came a 
strange: . 
the spring, 
And he lingerea uy the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
'Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
seem to watch and wait alway.
