TO 
MY FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC. 
THIS collection of my songs and character pieces has 
been compiled, not with the view of giving publicity to 
my name—which the wide-spread reputation accorded to 
me by a 
generous and appreciative public has rendered 
unnecessary—but to fulfil the frequently-expressed de-
sire of my numerous friends and patrons. 
I 
trust that this little work will meet with their hearty 
approval, as well as that of the public generally; and if 
it should raise a 
desire in any readers of the book at 
some future opportunity to witness my endeavors to en-
tertain them, they may rest assured that their expecta-
tions shall not be disappointed through any want of ef-
fort or will on the part of

SOL SMITH RUSSELL'S 
AMERICAN HUMOROUS AND CHARACTER 
VOCALIST. 
THE LATE LAMENTED MR. JONES. 
Bung with great success by Sol. SMITH RUSSELL in his Character 
Concerts. 
My 
path of life is choked with weeds, 
I'm wearing them because 
My 
late lamented husband's gone, 
Oh, what a 
man he was. 
I 
am his relic now, alas ! 
Reduced to skin and bones, 
Thro' mourning day and night the late 
Lamented Mr. Jones. 
SPOKEN. — And what a 
pleasant man he was. I 
met 
him first at Greenwich Fair, we had tea and shrimps, and 
Jones was so honorable he wouldn't allow me to pay. 
No, he stood treat, and borrowed the money of me. 
CHORUS. 
I 
mourn all day and night my fate 
In melancholy tones ; 
Oh, what a 
treasure was the late 
Lamented Mr. Jones. 
We used to keep a 
public house, 
'Twas called the " Lovers Arms ;" 
And lots of nice young men came in 
Attracted by my charms. 
• 
12 
THE LATE LAMENTED MR . 
JONES . 
They'd squeeze my band and talk to me 
in such bewitching tones, 
Which often raised the ire of 
The late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn all day and night, etc. 
He trusted me with any one, 
And never had a 
doubt; 
The last at night who came to bed 
Would put ,the candle but. 
But now, alas ! I 
have to pass 
My nights in tears and moans, 
And put the candle out, and not 
The late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn all day and night, etc. 
He really was a 
model man, 
And sober so to speak ; 
I 
never knew him tipsy, more 
Than seven times a 
week ; 
But one day with a 
pewter pot 
(Their hearts were hard as stones) 
They knocked upon the head the late 
Lamented Mr. Jones. 
SPOREN.—And he died quite peaceful, poor man; and 
his last words were that he was quite happy because 
he'd tested quite as many as ever bested him. 
I 
mourn all day and night, etc. 
There's Mr. Robinson, a 
man 
Who's well to do in life, 
Or Mr. Brown, the ,greed,g,rocer, 
Would have me for a 
wife. 
The one makes love upon his knees, 
The other sighs and groans ; 
But bless you not a 
patch upon 
The late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn all day and night, etc. 
THINK OF YOUR HEAD IN . 
THE MORNING . 
1$ 
THINK OF YOUR HEAD IN THE KORNING. 
One of M r. RUSSELL'S favorite songs. 
Tom Jennings who never could drinking avoid, 
But always his vows was making ; 
And after each spree he was always annoy'd, 
With a 
nervousness and a 
headaching. 
Going out to a 
party one evening last week, 
his wife said to him as a 
warning: 
"Be careful, dear Tommy, now mind what you're at, 
And think of your head in the morning." 
(Repeat last line.) 
He promised sincerely to bear it in mind. 
At supper, at first, be was cautious; 
Although very nice the lager did find, 
lie sipped it as though it was nauseous. 
But lager will the best resolutions destroy, 
By degrees he forgot his wife's warning, 
SPOKEN.— And would say with each glass: Look out, 
old boy, you better be careful— 
And think of your head in the morning. 
(Repeat last line.) 
At leaving the party with drink nearly blind, 
He ran against a 
post in returning; 
SPOKEN.—lle turned round and said: Sir, that's very 
unkind— 
Just think of my head in the morning. 
He rolled in the gutter, that's very unkind, 
You might, sir, have given me warning; 
When all covered with mud he lay there and said, 
Shan't I 
look spruce in the morning. 
(Repeat last line.) 
14 
OLIVER BELL, YE ANCIENT. 
At length he reached home, his hat without crown, 
He said to his wife rather fawning— 
SPOKEN. — My dear, my dearey—well don't you hear 
me talking to you. I've been struck by a 
brute; a 
lamp-
post hit me on the nose merely because I 
said to him— 
Think Of my head in the morning. 
Too tipsy for bed, he rolled on the floor, 
There he caught it for scorning his wife's warning, 
SPOKEN.—Said she: You good for nothing brute, how 
dare you go and 
et drunk when I 
told you not to,Tom ? 
My dear, my dear— be calm, be calm, you're mistaken; I 
aint drunk a 
bit, but l'in one of the sickest men you ever 
saw •, I 
don't get drink because I 
like to get drunk; I 
get drunk to show you, my dear, the immorality of in-
temperance; if you aint got no respect for me — 
Think of my head in the morning. 
OLIVER BELL, YE ANCIENT. 
Written by J. B. M URPHY, and presented by him to SQL SMITH 
RUSSELL, sung in character with great success. 
Oh, here I 
am as you can see, 
Lively and merry as Lean be; 
I'm old I 
know, but you'll agree, 
That 
am a 
happy old man. 
I 
laugh and dance, and sing right jolly, 
I 
shake off the blues and melancholy, 
For I 
think such things are nothing but folly, 
Not fit for a 
happy old man. 
CHORUS. 
Then look at me and observe me well, 
And when you go home you'll have 
thing to tell, 
About the queer antics of Oliver Bell, 
Who's known as the happy old man,

SILLY SAPPY SIMPLE SOL. 
15 
When I 
was young and went to school, 
I 
thought it then as a 
very good rule, 
If a 
boy didn't laugh he grew up very dull 
And not die like a 
happy old man. 
So I 
laughed when a 
boy, and when I 
grew older 
My laughing grew louder, and stronger and bolder; 
And then they called me the jolly old soldier, 
And now I'm a 
happy old man. • 
Then look at me and, etc. 
How long I 
may live, I'm sure I 
don't know, 
But when I 
am called 
be ready to go; 
And by my example endeavor to show, 
That I 
am a 
happy old man. 
When old grim death comes with his sickle, 
lie will find for his cutting I 
don't care a 
nickle; 
And I 
didn't turn out an old grandfather fickle, 
But died like a 
happy old man. 
Then look at me and, etc.

ALABASTER JOE. 
Written by SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
311/Sic by EDDIE C. Fox. 
My song is of a 
damsel fair, 
With jet black curly hair; 
She's light and bright as she can be, 
Without a 
thought or care. 
And I'm her beau, she told me so„ 
We're like de deer and doe; 
I 
call her sweet, when'er we meet, 
I'm her Alabaster Joe. 
cnonus. 
She's gentle as the lily by the lake side, 
Or the ripples of the waves on the sea side; 
And I 
love her to distraction, ' tween our 
love der's not a 
fraction, 
And she calls me her Alabaster Joe 
The first time dat I 
met her, 
Was at a 
Minstrel Hall ; 
She wore an alapaca silk, 
With a 
Bliver waterfall. 
In love I 
fell, I 
must her tell, 
So to her now ril go, 
For she's my love, my little dove, 
I'm her Alabaster Joe, 
She's as gentle as the lily, etc. 
Her step is like de antelope, 
Her voice is like de lamb; 
She'll sing for me, she'll sing for you, 
But not for barber Sam. 
Sam, he is my rival, 
He's trying to run me out; 
But I'm her beau, she told me so, 
Her Alabaster Joe. 
She's as gentle as the lily, etc. 
HAPPY ROCHUNKUS.

DAY, his former 
business manager. 
As I 
tip my bow and flap my shoe, 
You wonder what I'm going to do; 
My name and aim I 
will explain, 
If you will listen unto me. 
CHORUS. 
My aim is told in half a 
word, 
I'm going to sin , 
jr..6t, like a 
bird ; 
I'll laugh and dance, and raise a 
rumpus, 
'Cause they call me happy Kochunkus. 
I'll tell you were I 
learnt to dance, 
To laugh, and sing, and run and prance,

oa! WOULD THAT I WERE YOUNG AGAIN . 
'Twas wid a 
little girl name Nance, 
In dose happy childhood summer days. 
My aim is told in half, etc. 
Some childhood friends have passed away, 
And other friends hold mighty sway; 
But among the few there's none so true 
As Nance, my happy little bride. 
My aim is told in half, etc. 
OH! WOULD THAT I 
WERE YOUNG AGAIN. 
Written by M r. DWIGHT BILLINGS, of the Arch Street Theatre, 
Philadelphia, and presented to SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
Oh! would that I 
were young again, 
For happy then I 
used to be, 
Upon the old plantation ground, 
Where sorrow never came to me. 
My mother's voice, how sweet 'twould seem, 
She said I 
was her darling boy; 
And when I 
touched the banjo string, 
'Twould fill her dear old heart with joy. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
But now I'm old and far from home, 
My mother she is dead and gone, 
And through this wide, wide world I 
roam 
A 
wanderer, wretched and alone. 
But often when my heart is sad, 
My angel mother comes to me, 
And I 
feel that I 
am young again, 
And happy as I 
used to be. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
My loving wife and angel babe, 
Within the cold, cold ground now lie; 
WHERE'S PETER 7 
The wild flowers bloom above their grave, 
And seem to ask why did they die 
But soon the happy time will come, 
When we shall meet up in the sky, 
To dwell within the angels home, 
For there we ne'er again can die. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

WHERE'S PETER! 
One of the latest English comic songs, introduced in America by 
SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
I 
once was so happy but now I'm sad, 
0 
so sad—dreadfully sad, 
A 
young man named Peter's behaved so bad, 
(How can the men be so unkind ?) 
He said " that he loved me "— would buy the ring, 
Buy the ring—buy the ring, 
But now I've found out he meant no such thing, 
0! I 
must have been dreadfully blind. 
CHORUS . 
Does any one know where my Peter's gone ? 
Peter's gone, Peter's gone ? 
Does any one know where my Peter's gone ? 
Where 0 ! where is my Peter ? 
My Peter was handsome—in style so smart, 
Dashing and smart— he soon won my heart, 
He often declared that we never should part, 
And of course— I'd believe all he'd say; 
He'd call me his darling, his dear and his dove, 
And heave snch a 
sigh when he squeez'd my glove, 
We'd reside in a 
villa and live upon love, 
So at last-1 
of course—named the day. 
But, does any one know where, etc. 
20 
THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
I 
told my acquaintance and felt a 
slight pride, 
A 
small bit of pride —I 
was to be a 
bride, 
Some wisled me much happiness, some of them cried, 
Declared that they envied my lot ; 
We were to be married at Hanover Square, 
Hanover Square, with bridesmaids fair, 
We arrived at the church, but he wasn't there, 
I 
waited but Peter came not. 
So does any one know where, etc. 
I 
thought at the moment I 
Should go mad, 
Actually mad—most awfully mad, 
To serve me like that, 0, it was too bad, , 
I 
thought it I 
ne'er should survive; 
How some of the 'bridesmaids too titter'd with spite, 
Was unfeeling quite, I'd no sleep that night, 
But out of revenge for so cruel a 
slight, 
Find a 
more constant beau I'll contrive. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
don't care a 
fig for where Peter's gone ? 
Peter's gone, Peter's gone ? 
I 
don't mean to fret because Peter's gone ? 
lie's a 
false, fickle, frail, faithless Peter. 
THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
Sung by SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
Music of JOHN CHURCH, Jr., 
66 West 4th St., Cincinnati, 0. 
Is there no secret place on the face of the earth, 
Where charity dwelleth, where virtue bath birth ? 
Where bosoms in mercy and kindness will heave, 
And the poor and wretched shall ask and receive? * 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor, 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door'? 
Ah! search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for a 
moneyless man! 
THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
21 
Go look in your hall, where the chandeliers light 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night; 
Where the rich hanging velvet in shadowy folds 
Sweeps gracefully down with its trimming of gold. 
And the mirrors of silver take up and renew, 
In long lighted vistas the wildering view ; 
Go there in your patches, and find, if you can, 
A welcoming smile for a 
moneyless mall! 
Go look in your church with the cloud- reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of red fire; 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin! 
Go down the low* aisle—see the rich and the great 
In the pomp and the pride of their worldly estate— 
Walk down in your patches, and find, if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew to a 
moneyless man! 
Go look to yon judge in his dark-flowing gown; 
With the scales wherein law weighed) equity down, 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right, while he justifies wrong. 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made— 
Go there in the court room and find, if you can, 
Any law for the cause of a 
moneyless man! 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told 
His hundreds and thousands of silver and gold, 
Where safe from the hands of the starving poor, 
Lies pile upon pile of the glittering, ore ; 
Walk up to the counter— all, there you may stay 
Till your limbs grow old, and your hairs turn gray, 
And you'll find at the banks not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man! 
22 
I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE . 
Then go to your hovel no raven has fed, 
The wife who has suffered too long for her bread ; 
Kneel down by her pallet, and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost ; 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it mites you the chastening rod; 
And you'll find, at the end of your life's little span, 
There's a 
welcome above for a 
naoneyless man. 
I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE. . 
Written by FRANK W. EDGERTON. 
Sung by SOL SMITH R USSELL 
in his Humorous Entertainments. 
I 
am the most unhappy chap, 
That ever you did see; 
The world, at large, seems always glad, 
To make a 
fool of me. 
A 
dreadful saying is about, 
Which cuts me like a 
knife; 
Where'er I 
go, the people shout, 
" 
I 
say, I'll tell your wife." 
CHORUS. 
I'll tell your wife, I'll tell your wife, 
It frightens me out of my life; 
And causes me such dreadful strife, 
When people say, " I'll tell your wife." 
I 
never did a 
thing that's wrong, 
No, never once in fun, 
And always go borne straight, and tell 
My wife what I 
have done. 
'Twas rather hard then, when 1 
met 
My cousin, Jenny Fife, 
I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE. 
. 
And just shook hands to hear her cry, 
Sad man, I'll tell your wife." 
I'll tell your wife, etc. 
The other night an aged aunt 
Dropped in to tea with us, 
And %Oren she left, as it was wet, 
I 
saw her to a ' bus; 
She kissed me, for affection in 
The dear old girl is rife; 
But the conductor rudely said, 
"Gay dog, I'll tell your wife." 
I'll tell your wife, etc. 
Last week my little wife and I 
Went for a 
country walk, 
And when we reached a 
pleasant nook, 
We sat down for a 
talk; 
My arm was 'round her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life; 
I 
turned, and saw a 
gaping crowd, 
Who yelled, " I'll tell your wife." 
I'll tell your wife, etc. 
I 
hear it in the noisy street, 
And in the quiet square, 
I 
hear its murmur in the shell— 
In short, it's everywhere; 
That dreadful cry is killing me, 
It's causing fearful strife, 
What, Mister Jenkins,* did you say 
He says, " He'll tell your wife." 
I'll tell your wife, etc.

WHEN A MAN IS A LITTLE BIT POORLY. 
WHEN A MAN IS A 
LITTLE BIT POORLY. 
A 
Comical Song, sung by Sol, SMITH RUSSELL with the BERG= 
FAMILY BELL RINGERS. 
When a 
man's a 
little bit poorly, 
Makes a 
fuss, 
Wants a 
nurse, 
Thinks he's going to die most surely; 
Sends for a 
doctor that makes him worse, 
I 
caught only a 
bit of a 
cold, 
My wife did make 
Me gruel to take, 
And cuddled me up, between kindness and scold, 
And with her own hands my pillow did shake. 
CHORES. 
When a 
man's little bit poorly, 
Makes a 
fuss, 
Wants a 
nurse, 
Thinks he's going to die most surely; 
Sends for a 
doctor that makes him worse. 
three days with fever was furnac'd, 
Balmy sleep 
To me'd not creep, 
Obliged to send for the doctor in earnest; 
Hopes of recovery faintly peep, 
He with long and serious face, 
Pronounced me ill, 
Sent— Bolus—Pill— 
Draught— powder-- and all the race 
Of drugs, compound to make a 
long bill. 
When a

bit of a 
hint— 
Shoudn't die sooner for making my will. 
When a 
man's, etc. 
Worse and worse was my condition, 
My body sore, 
Life a 
bore, 
The doctor called in a 
physician, 
Who physick'd and bolus'd me ten times more; 
Relations round, with sighs and tears, 
Each nephew—niece— 
Disturb my peace; 
Even my wife changed hopes for fears—

NEVER PUSH A MAN'.

NEVER PUSH A 
MAN WHEN HE'S GOING DOWN HILL. 
Sung by Son SMITH RUSSELL. 
In this sensation century good songs are vey few, 
The words are little cared for, if the music it is new, 
And subjects they are bard to find, but I 
have found 
one still, 
That's never push a 
man because he's going down hill. 
CHORUS. 
Then help one another, boys, should fortune on 
you shine, 
Remember when you give your mite that pover-
ty's no crime ; 
Though little be the offering, boys, give it with 
good will, 
But never push a 
man because he's going down 
hill. 
In this wide world there's many a 
man with brave and 
honest heart, 
Who to raise his wife and family, in business makes a 
start; 
But still his ends don't seem to meet, work which way 
he will, 
Fate seems to be against him, and he's going down the 
hill. 
Then help one another, boys, etc. 
PRETTY POLLY, IF YOU LOVE ME, DO SAY " YES." 27 
As we journey on in daily life, how many men we find, 
That poverty's a grievous sin to think they are in-
clined; 
They meet in sad adversity some old friend, Tom or 
Bill, 
And pass him by disdainfully as he's going down the 
hill. 
Then help one another, boys, etc. 
Should e'er you meet an honest man struggling on with 
fate, 
Never speak words of discopragement or tell him ' tis too 
late; 
Don't sneer as you pass by him, but help him with a 
will, 
And, perhaps, some day you'll meet him on the summit 
of the hill. 
Then help one another, boys, etc. 
PRETTY POLLY, IF YOU LOVE ME, DO SAY " YES," 
Music of JOHN CHURCH, jr., 66 West 4th Street, Cincinnati, 0. 
They say ' tis love that only makes the world go round, 
Where love is found there joys abound; 
And lovers always dance upon enchanted ground, 
At least it was the case with me. 
I 
knew a 
charming girl, quite a 
pearl, 
Hair in curl ; 
Fib for a 
duke or earl, 
And she is going to marry me. 
SPOKEN.—The first time I 
saw her, I 
remarked— 
CHORUS. 
Pretty Polly, if you love me, do say " yes," do 
say " yes," 
Pretty Polly, if you love me, do say " yes," do 
say " yes."

SEE TH AT MAN WITH THE HORRIBLE NOSE. 
I 
met her at a 
west end ball one happy night, 
her eyes were bright, her step was light ; 
Her conversation charming and her figure slight, 
in fact my style to a 
T. 
Byjove you should have seen, 
This fairy queen, 
Enchaming mien, 
It would have been with you quite up a 
tree. 
Pretty Polly, if you love me, etc. 
I 
told her I'd enlist if she'd not list to me, 
Or go to sea a 
tar to be, said she, 
You silly fellow you better marry me, 
- And stop at home for love. 
Next day to her ma I 
went, 
Gained her consent quite content 
The quvitations are all sent, 
And I'm going to marry my dove. 
SPOKEN.—And I 
mean to occupy my mind cheerfully 
in remarking—. 
Pretty Polly, if you love me, etc. 
SEE THAT MAN WITH THE HORRIBLE NOSE. 
One of Mr. R USSELL'S most comic characters. 
See that man with the horrible nose, 
Is something I 
always shall hear; 
Don't you see him ? why yonder he goes, 
Is constantly boring my ertf. 
CHORUS . 
What a 
norrable nose, a 
norrable nose, 
Oh; see that man with the ' orible nose. 
SEE THAT MAN WITH THE HORRIBLE NOSE . 
29 
When e'er to a 
party I 
go, 
My nose is a 
wonder they say; 
And when ever that organs blow, 
All around me cry out in dismay, 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
One day down to Barnum's I 
went, 
When I 
thought to the giants .rd go; 
But my nose they all ''(
razed at intent, " 
For they thought Ibelonged to the show. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
One day on a 
lady'lcalled, 
Her acquaintance to make " by the by ;" 
While at ,bowing and scraping 1 
toiled,. 
My nose took her squarnin the eye. ' 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
I 
once knew a 
damsel I 
loved, 
Whose sympathy healed all my woes; 
To kiss her good once I 
tried,' 
And knocked in her teeth with my nose. 
• 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
I 
once thought the Good Tempters I'd join, 
All spiritous.drinks to oppose; • 
But I 
found they had by-laws so strong, 
That they scoffed at the look of my nose. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
Now married 'I never shall be, . 
My advatites the girls all Oppose; 
The trouble you can plainly 'see, 
Why it's all on account of my nOse. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc.

TnE IDOL OF THE DAY. 
THE IDOL OF THE DAY. 
As sting by the great VANCE, of England, also by SoL Smrru 
RUSSELL in his character impersonations. 
I'm on the cards for gayety, 
The globe is not so old; 
I 
need no yellow passport, 
I 
live on a 
cloth of gold. 
I'm cast in good society, 
They like my nonchalance; 
Where'er I 
go they always know, 
The swell " par excellence." 
CHORUS. 
I'm par excellence idol of the day, 
London or in France my time I 
pass away; 
I'm par excellence in farm, field and dance, 
In fact, in all the sports of life I'm par excel-
lence. 
Now after dark I 
like to roam, 
And have a " loving cup ;" 
Or at the hunt I'm quite at home, 
And with the masters sup. 
I'm sweet on " rural felicity," 
Can course when I've the chance; 
And as to give a " blow for blow," 
Why I'm par excellence. 
I'm par excellence idol, etc. 
At Cambild,c,fe I 
gained " A.B.," 
Was never reckoned slow; 
And at a 
standard royalty, 
A standard man to row. 
As volunteer was in the Queen's, 
My military glance, 
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A GIRL GO MAD. 
31 
Was noticed by the " Prince of Wales," 
As the mail par excellence.

To charm princesses my finesse

CUPID'S 
A VERY NAUGHTY BOY. 
As sung first in America by Miss ANNIE BERGER of the BERGER 
FAMILY BELL RINGERS. 
Young Cupid's a 
very naughty boy, 
For with poisoned dart, 
tender bosom he, 
'Made a 
target and you see he 
Quite sickled my poor heart. 
But it's all through i 
a 
lardy dardy swell, 
Thouirh just like all the men, 
Said marry me he should, 
And I 
really thought he would, 
lie quite forgot to mention when. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do declare it's enough to make a 
girl go mad, 
And wonder all the day, 
To thh,k what he has brought me to, 
•• And now he's gone away. 
32 
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A GIRL GO MAD. 
Down at Ramsgate, twas upon the pier, 
This swell just caught my view ; 
He wore a 
suit of check, 
And twiddled round his neck, 
A 
glass which he couldn't see through. 
Now I 
thought him a 
baronet at least, 
And when he said, " be mine," ' 
I 
trembled with delight, 
And could not sleep at night, 
For I 
thought what a 
chance is mine. 
I 
do declare it's enough to, etc. 
When he'd stolen my siMple heart away, 
Likewise a 
watch and chain, 
He quickly disappeared 
Until very much I 
feared, 
I 
should never see my love again. 
But one morning while strolling out alone, 
I 
heard his dulcet tones, 
I 
saw him on the sands 
In a 
-nasty nigger band, 
And he rattled away on the bones. 
I 
do declare it's enough to, etc. 
Now young girls take a 
warning from my 
tale,, 
The men pray don't believe, 
No matter what they say, 
You shoud no attention pay, 
For you'll find they all deceive. 
I 
pine and wander day and night, 
For I 
can't forget my wrongs, 
And the only way I 
find, 
To relieve my troubled mind, 
Is at night to sing comic oti'gs. 
I 
do declare it's enough to, etc. 
I KNEW THAT I WAS DRE AM ING. 
SS 
I 
KNEW THAT I 
WAS DREAMING. 
new English comic song, sung by GEORGE LEN-sot:ENE 
and 
SOL RUSSELL. 
Dreains are the strangest thing in life, 
So fanciful yet real, 
Sometimes depicting scenes of strife ; 
In others they reveal 
Such happinesss, that were it not 
Sometimes the spell was breaking, 
That we were sleeping we'd forget, 
And fancy we were waking. 
Some strange dreams l've had of late; 
My braitywith thought's been teeming, 
And if you'll listen I 
will state 
What lately I've been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
race course, 
And a 
crowd assembled there, 
To watch each noble race horse 
As towards the post they tear; 
I 
dreamt there was no welching, 
But all were acting fair, 
And I 
thought there was no flinching, 
Or card sharping, I 
declare. 
Well, soon the race it did begin ; 
The colors they were streaming, 
And I 
thought each jockey tried to win, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
postman, 
Who was hurrying on his rounds, 
Of letters he'd a 
host, man; 
And so nimbly on he bounds; 
I 
thought it just struck 8 
o'clock, 
i101.6411Alati.. 
34 
I KNEW THAT I WAS DREAMING. 
The maid the steps was clearing. 
And I 
thought he gave a 
gentle knock, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming ; 
He was so curiously arrayed, 
The buttons bright were gleaming, 
And some one said he was well paid, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw an area gate, 
And a 
pliceman standing near— 
A 
servant-maid with mincing gait, 
Came forth to fetch some beer,; 
I 
saw him kiss her on the sly, 
So life- like it was seeming, 
But when he refused some rabbit pie, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming; 
A row commenced close by there, when 
For police they loud were screaming; 
He came when he was wanted, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
music hall, 
And a 
waiter on his way, 
To serve some gents within the stalls, 
With something on a 
tray, 
I 
saw him hand politely. 
The glass with liquor streaming. 
But he went away without the fee, 
Then I 
knew that I 
must be dreaming ; 
I 
thought every comic song, 
Was full of wit and meaning, 
I 
felt convinced that I 
was wrong, 
And knew I 
must be dreaming.

WEDDING OF BIDDY MGRANE. 
A 
lively Irish comic song in that comical Soes humorous enter-
tainments. 
I'll sing you a 
song if you'll listen awhile, 
Of a 
damsel so pretty, so charming and witty, 
Who lived from the city of Dublin a 
mile, 
On the road to Clondalk, in the Emerald Isle; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tipping the blarney, 
But search near and far and you might search in 
vain, 
From Donaghadee, to the Banks of Killarney, 
And not find the equal of Biddy M'Grane. 
A 
fine hearted genuine son of the soil, 
One Larry Molloy, a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Who knew what it was for his living to toil, 
On a 
neat bit of land of his own at Baldoyle; 
And Larry for marriage felt no inclination, 
But love is a 
thing that ye cannot explain, 
And enters your heart without hesitation 
So Larry was smitten with Biddy M'Grane. 
Now Larry was fond of a 
jig, the spalpeen, 
He went to the fair and Biddy was there, 
And strolling up to the pretty Colleen, 
Soon led her out for a 
dance on the green; 
The blink of her eye was near driving him crazy, 
He axed her consent, but she look'd with disdain, 
But when the bould Larry, he trampled the daisy, 
It melted the heart of Biddy M'Grane. 
The day of the wedding the girls and the boys, 
And fiends were invited, and highly delighted, 
The Lannigans, the Brannans, the Burkes and • 
loys,

JOEY LADLE. 
Were all in their glory, with fun and with noise; 
Miss Morgan she came along with Dan Brady, 
In a 
new suit he'd bought from old Petticoat Lane, 
And Larry M'Guiness arrived with Miss Grady, 
To dance at the wedding of Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting indeed it was mighty fine, 
There was bacon and cheese, potatoes and peas, 
And lashings of potheen, in place of the wine, 
Biddy she look'd like a 
goddess divine; 
Attired as she was in her gorgeous apparel, 
In a 
new yellow kirtle of muslin detaine, 
Ould Barney the fiddler on top of a 
barrel, 
Struck up " Garryowen" for Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting concluded the dancing began, 
The Cairns, and the Gilli,gans, and the O'Howlagans, 
All of them leaped to their feet, to a 
man, 
And jigged it as only an Irishman cnn; 
But when bould Jemmy Howagan leaped on the 
table, 
I 
suppose 'twas the whiskey that fired his brain, 
And roar'd " Cead mule Faltaigh" long as he was 
able, 
Good luck and more power to Biddy M'Grane.

WHERE ARE THE FRIENDS OF MY YOUTH? 
A BAD . LOT. 
An excellent comic songs, sung by Son SMITH RUSSELL. Words 
by MT. HOWARD PAUL. 
In moods sentimental we're apt to ask questions 
That's best left unasked, if I 
must tell the truth : 
And sometime ago, in a 
flush of emotion, 
I 
scribbled a 
poem on " friends of my youth." 
Oh! where are the friends of my youth?" was the 
title— 
Of lines I 
thoua'nt touching, and tender and terse; 
'Twas all very well, but I 
greatly regret it— 
That bursting into interrogative verse. 
You'll see what I 
mean if you'll listen a 
moment— 
A 
nice set of creatures they turned out, forsooth— 
The next time I 
gush out in poetic rapture, 
I'll not be so anxious concerning my youth. 
The letters that reached me were simply astounding : 
They seemed to pour in from the earth's distant 
ends, 
Conveying the tidings I'd rashly requested— 
The doings of early and intimate friends. , 
John Smith wrote to say he was just then in prison, 
(I couldn't see him at that moment ' twas plain ;) 
And Jones, who in youth had a 
turn for the drama, 
Was gallery " checker " at Old Drury Lane. 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY, DARLING. 
41 
And Brown, who in boyhood was such a•wild fellow, 
(I often had trouble to keep him in bounds) 
Just dropped me a 
line, with apologies many, 
To know if I'd lend him a 
couple of pounds. 
„ 
Young Aaron, who had a 
bend in his proboscis, 
(We lads looked him up when a 
trifle was lent) 
Down Whitechapel way, is a 
flaring pawnbroker, 
And lends out his money at sixty per cent. 
And young Thomas Tompkins had turned out quite 
horsey, 
(I mind me he talked of the turf and its ways), 
And Green, who we thought would grow up to be 
pious, 
Was starring about on the " flying trapeze." 
And Simpkins—poor dolt—who was no end of a 
stupid, 
As clown in a 
circus was passing his life; 
And big Billy Bowles whom we used to call "Cupid,'" 
Had bolted last summer with somebody's wife 
But why go on further ? ' tis but an infliction 
Each name, as it turned u p', presented 
a 
blot; 
I 
think, on the whole, you'll join in the conviction— 
The friends of my youth were a 
rather bad lot! 
THAT'S VTR REASON WHY, DARLING. 
The music of this song may be had of Joipr CHURCH, jr., 
66 West 4th St., Cincinnati, 0. 
'Tis true that I'm sad, darling, 
'Tis true that I'm changed; 
What wonder I'm not blithe and gay, 
When from you estranged; 
You never let me see you home, 
As once you used to do; 
I'm often at the wicket gate, 
But Allan lets you through; 
42 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY, DARLING. 
It's hard to see you smilling so, 
While I 
do naught but sigh.

CAL HER BACK AND KISS IIER• 
t 
A 
beautiful serio-comic song. Sung *by 4. RENWOLF and Sox, 
&lima RnssnLi in his Humorous Entertainments. 
f 
There's nothing half so - 
charming — 
As a 
happy marriedlife; 
And nothing so alanning 
As a 
vixen .for a 
wife; `;,.. 
" But as you make your bed, you know. 
So on it you must lie; 
'Tis useless then to make a 
fuss, 
Take ray'advice don't try. 
CHORDS. 
'"A woman's stire to go her way,' 
. But when -she's gone 
miss her; 
„, 
So if you've had an angry word, 
' 
Why call her back and kiss her. 
{ 
A 
wife will sUrely inle'the roast; 
Of course,That's very proper, • 
And if she means to rifle you too, 
I 
don't think you can stop her. 
Be never cruel, always kind, 4,, 
Do nothing that; will tease her; 
And if you wish to live happy,' 
You'll do your best to please her. 
A 
woman's sure to gir her way, etc. 
A woman's sure to have her way,. 
For that we, cannot blame her; 
The remedy, ah, ,then I 
say„ 
'Tis kindness that will tame her. 
Be alw.ays. gentle, never harsh, 
And mind you do not flout her,-7-,, I 1. •
i 
Remember, you're but helpless men, Al 
And cannot :do without her. 
A 
woman's sure to go her way, etc. 
SlIA13BY GENVt., 
That woman is our greatest joy, 
Let every man reflect; 
Don't tease her like a 
worthless toy, 
Nor slight her 'by negleCt. 
If you possess a 
woman's love, 
What more does any need ? 
r 
In sickness or in health she'll be, ,. 
A 
comforter indeed. 
'A woman's sure to go lim%way, etc, 
SHABBY GENTEEL. 
A principal character song in SoL SMITH RUSSELL'S Concerts. 
We have heard it asserted a 
dozen , 
times o'er, 
That a 
man nay be happy in rags; 
That a 
prince is no more, in his carriage and four, 
Than a 
pauper who tramps on ;the flags. 
As 
chance to be neither, I 
cannot describe, 
How a 
prince or a 
pauper may feel; 
I 
belong to that highly respectable tribe, 
Which is known as the shabby genteel. 
CHORUS. 
Top proud to beg, too hone*St to steal, 
I 
know what it is to.be wantitig' a 
meal, 
My, tatters and rags, I 
try to conceal, 
I'm one of the shabby genteel: 
I'm a 
party, in fact, who has known better days, 
But their glory is faded and gone; ' 
I 
have started in life in a 
lot of odd wiys, 
But have not found the way to get' on. 
There are only three roads, I'm afraid, that are left— 
I 
shall have to beg, borrow or stcal ; 
Yet I 
don't quite encourage the notion of theft, 
The' I'm awfully shabby genteel. 
Too proud to beg, too honest, eta. 
THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER.

I 
am dressed in my best tho' I 
cannot' pretend, 
a 
.That my costuine is quite emote 
faut; 
You'll observe that my watch has been left with a 
friend,: 
And my gloves are unfitted for show. 
There Are traces of wear on my elbows and knees, , 
And my boots have run down at the heel; , 
But it's cruel to criticise matters like these, 
When a 
man has grown. shabby genteel: , 
Too proud to, beg, too honest, etc.. 
Still I 
strive to-be cheerful ria'all mY 
distreSs, 
And I 
bear,my bad luck like a,man; - a 
If I 
can't have my waY as to feeding or dress, 
I 
Must still do the best that I- can. 
And remember, good people, that fortune some day, 
By a 
turn 'of her treacherems wheel, 
May reduce one of you in the very same way, 
To the level of shabby genteel. 
prtiud to beg, too honest, etc. 
THE FISHERMAN'S 
DAUGHTER THAT LIVED O'ER THE 
WATER. 
A fine comic song, sung by Sot. Smug RUSSELL, 
I've been caught in, a 
net by a 
dear little pet, 
And her eyes are as blue as the deep rolling sea; 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, she lives o'er the water, 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
She's as rare as a 
salmon, there's really no gammon, 
As sweet as shrimps newly served up for tea; 
My soul she has caught, and a 
place I 
have bought, 
Where a 
ray of the, sunshine for ever will be. 
CHORUS. ' 
And she's a 
fisherman's daughter, she lives o'or 
the water, 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me; ,

BOTHER THE FLIES. 
r • 
BOTHER THE PLIES! 
Concocted and composed by Mr. and Mrs. H. Penn. 
The singer to imitate the hum or buzz of the flies during Synt-
phony.) 
Bother the flies ! they're a 
positive nuisance, 
Buzzing and biting from morning 'till night, 
Sticking, 
on paper, distracting our senses, 
Floating in liquids, annoying our sight. 
Jam pots selecting for sweet dissipation, 
Nipping our noses and blinding our eyes; , 
Into our coffee persistently bobbing, 
Hark! the loud chorus of" bother the flies !" 
crionus. : 
Bother the flies, bother the flies, ' 
Hark! the loud chorus of "bother the flies !" 
Bother the flies, bother the flies, 
Bother, bother, bother the flies. 
You want forty winks, and give way to the feeling, 
Weed just as you cosily fall in a 
dose, 
A 
fly lets himself slyly down from, the ceiling, 
And dances a 
jig upon- the top of your nose; 
Or your health is propos'd at a 
very swell dinner, 
Of course, to lisp out a 
response , 
you arise, '..t 
A 
blue-
bottle quietly pops down your throttle, 
You're chok'd with a 
splutter of " bother the flies.' 
Bother the flies, bother the flies, etc. 
1 
At tea they vexatiously keep up their clamor, 
Each moment much thicker and louder they seem;. 
That impudent fly oils his hair with your butter, 
Who takes eviry morning hrs bath in your cream. 
The patience of Job Would at this grow exhausted, 
Philosophy only can hinder the cries 
Of " bother the" flff! I 
think that was a 
settler, 
Miss'd him by jingo! - 0! " bother the flies !" 
Bother the flies, bother the flies, etc.

THE SOAP GREASE BELLE. 
Written, composed and sung in character by Sox. &arra Rus-
SEL in his Concerts. , 
Some girls are mourning all the while, 
And never are content 
Just like me, when papa was poor 
And didn't have a 
cent. , 
But begot rich on a 
soap contract, 
And so in dress I 
shine. 
That gussy snob, that gay young swell' 
Says: Oh won't you be mine!. 
CHORUS. 
I 
wear my frills and waterfall, 
Aristocratic I 
must act,. 
Just because papa struck ile 
On a 
heavygoap contract. 
Now since papa has 'got so rich, 
I 
so in dress must shine; 
I 
wear long trails with a 
Grecian Bend, 
There's no end to my crinoline. 
When poor, my hair it did not curl, 
Now my golden ringlets float 
Just because my dear papa 
Was so successful in soap. 
I 
wear my frills and waterfall, etc. 
There's Sarah Jones and Jennie BIigh, 
Sich girls I 
never seen, 
They laugh and, point when I 
go by, 
And make.me feel so green; 
They say " tliere goes the soap grease queen, 
With King Starch she Should elope, 
They would live so sweet; for her dad could 'build 
A 
palace of peirfapted soap." 
I 
wear my frills and Waterfall, etc.

THE CONICAL GHOSTS. 
One of SOL RUSSELL'S best Comic Songs. 
Three little ghosts took it into their heads, 
Into their heads, into their beads, 
To frighten good people right out of their beds, 
These odd little comical ghosts, . 
They parted good friends at four little' cross-roads, 
And went to find out quietpeople's abodes, 
Upsetting the frogs, and garrotting the toads, 
These bad little, cad little, sad little, glad little, mad 
little comical ghosts. 
CHORUS. 
Roblin, goblin, noblin, goblin, 
Bad little, cad little, sad little, glad little, mad

THE COMICAL GHOSTS., 
Ghost number one was black as a 
crow, 
As black as a 
crow, as black as a 
crow, 
He jumped down a 
chimney, and shouted out " Bo!" 
This odd little comical ghost, 
A 
feeble old woman was lying in bed, 
He frightened her out of her senses, ' tis said, 
By walking all over the room en his head, 
This bad little, cad tittle, sad little, glad little, mad 
little comical ghost. 
Hoblin, goban, noblin, goblin, etc. 
Oh ghost number two, was a 
funny young chap, 
A 
funny young chap, a 
funny young chap, 
His dress was an old postage stamp and a 
cap, 
This odd little comical ghost; 
He climbed up the houses, and damaged the slates, 
And when folks objected, his history states„ 
He merely remarked " that he'd called for the rates," 
This bad little, cad little, glad little, mad little, sad 
little, comical ghost. 
Hoblin, goblin, noblin, goblin, etc. 
Oh ghost number three was a 
trifle insane, 
A 
trifle insane, a 
trifle insane, 
Which gave his poor mother a 
good deal of pain, 
This odd little comical ghost; 
He thought. it was funny, this silly young coon, 
To tell people he was the man it the moon, 
And yell at the top of his voice, " Ah, balloon !" 
This bad little, cad little, glad little, mad little, siad 
little comical ghost. 
Hoblin, goblin, noblin, goblin, etc. 
These little ghosts met in ari inn at their ease, 
An inn at their ease, an inn at their ease, 
And went " Tommy Dod,d" for two penn'orths or

In sailing along the river Of life,

THE OLD TiTAID. 
BY SEP W INNER. 
When I 
was a 
girl of ' eighteen years old 
I 
was sorrowful, as sorrowful could be, ' 
I 
was taught to expect wit, wisdom. arid gold, 
And nothing else would do for me. 
Ah, those were the days when my eyes beamed 
bright, 
And my cheeks were like the rose on the tree, 
And the ringlets they curled o'er my forehead so 
white, 
And lovers came a-courting me. 
The first was a 
youth any girl might adore, 
As ardent as lever could be; 
But my mother having heart that the young man 
was poor,, 
„f 
Why, he would not do for me. 
And then hobbled in, my favor to beg, 
An officer in our navy; 
But though famous in arms, he wanted a 
leg, 
So he would not do for me. 
"And now came a 
lawyer, his claims to support, 
By precedents from chancery; 
But I 
told him; I 
was judge in -my own little court, 
And he would not do for me. 
The next was a 
dandy, who had driven four in hand, 
Reduced to a 
gig—d'ye see'?,  
an setting o'er the grdund, he had, run.thro' his land, 
So he would not do for me. 
64 
BE -SURE YOU SAY 
OUT. 
I'd a 
suitor from the South, and another from the 
West, 
I 
think, from the State of Tennessee; 
But one was rather old, the other badly &est, 
So neither of them suited me. 
These were nearly the last—I 
was then Porty-four, 
I 
am now only just fifty-three ; 
But I 
really think that some, • I 
rejected before, 
Would do now very well for me. 
Then, all ye young ladies, by me warning take, 
ho; scornful or cold chance to be ; 
• 
Lest ye, from your fond silly dreams should awake, 
Old maidens of fifty-three. 
BE SURE YOU SAY I'M OUT.

of JOH N CHUR CH, 
jr., 66 West 4th St., Cincinnati, 0. 
0,11, here you see a 
hapless man, which ever way T 
run, 
I'm pestered half out of my life by creditor and dun; 
It's tap, tap on the shoulder, and rap, rap, at the door, 
bear it very patiently, but its an awful lore. 
CHORUS. 
It's rap, rap, rap, rap, knocking; at the front, 
Ring ding, ring ding, half-a-dozen times or more. 
Is Mr. Furguson at home? I hear 'ern rave and 
shout, 
If anybody chance to call, be sure you say I'm out. 
My tailor noisily will say, that my style doesn't suit, 
he'll bring a 
suit against me for payment for this suit ; 
He wants me to invest my cash, on the vest around my 
waist, 
Says 'tisn't to my credit, tho' it's to my credit placed. 
It's rap, rap, etc. 
BE SURE YOU SAY I'M OUT .

My bootmaker as-shoers (assures)me my living, awl ( all) 
too fast, 
If I 
don't shoes ( choose) to alter, this sort of thing can't 
last ; 
He must an understanding have, he bootlessly will say, 
He thinks my habits slippery, and fears I'll never pay. 
It's rap, rap, etc. 
My baker oft turns crusty, and tho' a 
well-bred cove, 
Says that he'd loaf ( love) 
to see my tin, yes that he 
would. by J; 
My buttermonger too, declares, I'm not at all the cheese, 
His wife too, comes it mitey ( mighty) strong, umph, but 
her style don't please. 
It's rap, rap, etc. 
My greengrocer will often say, I'd cabbage all I could, 
But not from him exactly, he'd green grow, sir, ere I 
should.' 
My butcher if he meets me, says my conduct isn't meet, 
I 
show him the cold shoulder if I 
see him in the street. 
It's rap, rap, etc. 
My hosier says I'd collar all, but if I'm ask'd to pay, 
I 
take affront, my shirts get out, I'm in a 
shocking way; 
This calf ( scarf) he oft turns choleric and says my con-
duct's. such 
He can't keep up a 
stock in' trade, because I 
hose (owes) 
so much. 
And 
It's rap, rap, etc. 
SO you see, I 
do not dare, outside my house to 
roam 
To friends and creditors alike, I 
dare not be at home, 
B 
it if you'll only show you're friends, and lend me 
your applause 
To give me tick another week, perhaps they may see 
cause.

NIAGARA FALLS. 
Written by Mr. Wixom:tr., and sung by Son sArrrn Russp.Ln. 
From Buffalo my, labor done, 
For curiosities and fun, 
I 
took the cars, the morning run , 
To go to Niagara falls, sirs, 
The morn was cold, the snow fell fast, 
Old Boreas blew a 
piercing blast, 
With two horse pow'r sat off at last, 
We'd passengers of ev'ry caste; 
There was Mr. and Mrs. Frost and son, 
A 
charming lady of fifty-one, 
Whose volubility of tongue 
Reminded me of a 
Chinese gong. 
The following conversation took place in the cars be-
tween an old lady and gentleman: 
OLD GENT—" My dear, I 
told you not to bring that 
child along this frosty morning; you might just as well 
left it tew hum with the sarvant gall as -not, and it would 
have been well taken care of; let me hold it, that's a 
dear ?" 
OLD LADY—" No, Mr. Frost, 1'11 carry it my-
self, so I 
will, the ony dony leetle huny buny. 
I 
did not 
want to set off for the falls so early in the spring, but 
you are an untimely frost, Mr. Frost, as your conduct 
sufficiently evinces; last fall you were for going to the 
Springs, and this spring you are for going to the Falls, 
last winter you went to Summertown, we put up at Mr. 
Snow's hotel, where we had all like to have.frozen to 
death. (Child cries) There, there, yes mamma's dear pet 
shall go and see the" 
CHORUS. 
Rumbling, tumbling, tearing away, 
Wallowing; bellowing, wet with spray, 
Like aunt Deborah's washing day; 
This trip to Niagara falls. 
NIAGARA FALLS. 
67 
The- driver did his horses crack, 
But the snow came drifting o'er the track, 
Which made our travelling rather slack 
Going to Niagara falls, sirs, . 
At length arrived in time to dine, 
The Cataract hotel is fine; 
We'd flesh and fish of ev'ry kind, 
And negro waiters to stand behind; 
The landlord lie procured a 
guide, 
Who took us down to the water side, 
Where we rock'd and pitch'd in the foaming tide 
As through the surge our boat did glide. 
OLD LADY—" Don't sit over there sir, if you do we 
shall overset." 
OLD GENT—" Billy, my boy, set up 
out of the bottom of the bolt." 
BOY: " 
Oh, no, pa, 
I'm afraid I 
shall upset : 
Oh, mamma, see what a 
sight 
of i 
e 
there is all round the boat." " Sartain," ob-
served a 
Yankee, " This is an ice-boat wherry." 
OLD 
GENT—" Don't be making fun, it's punishment enough 
crossing this pond, ' tis ' port my word. 
Ah, there's the 
English hallo! I 
wonder what's the reason they are not 
as high as the American falls?" 
YANKEE—" Well, as 
nigh as I 
can calc'late ' tis because they hain' t 
got so far 
to fall." 
OLD LADY—" How is it possible you can jest 
in the midst of this " 
Rumbling, tumbling, etc. 
'Midst foaming billows at length we lan 
On cakes of rocky ice and sand, 
We all got safe upon the strand, 
Going to Niagara falls, sirs. 
We gazed upon the English falls, 
Tumbling over nature's walls„ 
The noise of which your heart appalls, 
Just like the thousand thunder squalls.

Rumbling, tumbling, etc. 
Stuck fast in mud with sad turmoil, 
Some lost a 
shoe, amidst the toil, 
At length we reach'd the topmost soil. 
That leads to Niagara falls sirs— 
The rival cataract's in view 
Roaring and rushing ever new; 
Goat island stmpls between the two, 
The English falls, they call Horse- shoe, 
Near Table- rock we all descend, 
Down winding steps that never end, 
The ladies our aid %% e 
had to lend, 
Each begging the other her pace to mend.

THOROUGH-BRED. 
beautiful characteristic song, sung by Sot SMITH RUSSELL. 
Written by W ILLIAM BERNARD. Composed and arranged by AL-
FRED LEE. 
Beau Brummell was a 
dandy, 
And Lord Chesterfield a 
fool; 
In fact there's naught to copy 
From swells of the old school; 
But we, as their successors, 
Are the boys to go ahead, 
And show you what it is to be 
A modern thorough- bred! 
CHORUS. 
And I'm Don of the lot, 
Though we've all of us got, 
The knack to be constantly jolly, 
We fight, love, and play, . 
Turn night into day, 
And drive away grim melancholy 
We flirt with Prima Donnas, 
The Baden banks we break, 
We run the cracks at Ascot, 
And always win the stake; 
In Rotton Row we canter, 
As fashion's brightest bards, 
For Tattersall and Poole are trumps 
To fellows in the Guards. 
And I'm Don, etc. 
If luck should go against us, 
And little leave to spend, 
The Jews are always willing 
The yellow dross. to lend;

And when old age assails us, 
Rowland and Rachel give

Written and composed by G. W. H UNT. Sung by Mr. RUSSELL 
in his humorous concerts. 
You must know I 
belong to the army, 
You can see that of course by my style, 
I 
delight in the title of Captain, 
And upon me the ladies all smile; ' 
In the ranks of the First Mounted Out-o'- sights 
I 
hold an important command, 
And perhaps you'll permit me to tell you, 
There are no finer men in the land.

The noble frame and glorious name, 
Of Captain De Wellington Boots. 
You may talk of the Bar or the Navy, 
My life beats the couple to smash, 
You can get a 
fine post in the army, 
That is if you've got but the cash; 
My dad you must know was a 
grocer, 
Who contrived to scrape up a 
good sum, 
Bought me a 
commission with " sugar," 
And afterwards left me a " plum."

At soirees and balls I 
get feted, 
The darlings at me, how they glance, 
And quarrel almost for the Captain, 
Or implore I 
will join in the dance; 
But dancing for me's too much bother, 
I 
leave such hard work to the rest, 
I 
like billiards and so I 
do croquet, 
After all tho' the thing I 
like best,

To la de da, etc. 
I 
tell them fine tales about battles, 
Which the darlings are anxious to hear, 
But what the smell of powder is like, 
I 
have not the slightest idea; 
They think I've done glorious deeds, 
And have oft made the enemy fly, 
But I 
haven't as yet, and what's more, 
I 
have no intention to try.
