HOOLEY'S 
EITGII DADDY 
SONGSTER 
The Mother of All Songs. 
WRITTEN BY EUGENE T. JOHNSON. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Mother songs are all the rage of course, you all do 
know, 
You'll hear these touching dities wherever you may 
go; 
In the cot, in the parlor, even on the battle plain, 
Our soldier boys all seem to have " Mother on the 
brain.'' 
This mania is increasing most fearful I 
avow, 
Ever sinco the appearance of " Who'll care for 
mother now 1" 
I've arranged a 
list of mother songs together in a 
string, 
And with your kind permission, them to you I'll 
sing. 
What is home without a 
mother ( in a 
garret near 
the sky,) 
Courage mether,I am going, mother,I've come home 
to die ; 
6 
High Daddy Songster. 
Mother, is the battle over, have our soldiers gain'd 
the day, 
I 
can't mind, my wheel, mother, ( what will Mrs. 
Grundy say.) 
It was my mother's custom — my grandmother's 
advice, 
The song my mother loved to sing, (a 
big thing on 
ice,) 
Kiss my mother dear for me, mother I've come home 
again, 
Break it gently to my mother, I've got mother on 
the brain. 
Write a 
letter to my mother, send it when her boy 
is dead, 
Tell mother I 
die happy, (is Joe Muggins dog long 
dead,) 
Is that mother bending o'er me, ' tis the ring my 
mother wore, 
flock me to sleep mother (on the old Virginny 
shore.) 
Let me kiss him for his mother, let me kiss his in-
fant brow, 
Bless me mother ere I 
die — who will care for 
mother now I 
My dear kind old mother, (her name was Mary 
Blane.] 
I 
cannot call her mother, rye got mother on the 
brain. 
Just before the battle, mother, I 
was thinking most 
of you, 
Be quiet do, I'll call my mother [ for an old. Irish 
stew ;] 
Mother dear would comfort me if she were here, 
I'm lonely since my mother died [from drinking 
lager bier] 
A 
mother's love can never change [picking a 
ham 
boned 
High Daddy Songster. 
7 
I'll not forget thee, mother, wherever I 
may roam: 
0 
sing me to rest, mother, [Joe Bowers is my name,] 
Kiss me good- night, mother, with mother on the 
brain. 
"-OM-. • 
The Fall of Charleston. 
WRITTEN BY EUGENE T. JOHNSON. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Oh have you heard the glorious news, is the cry 
from every mouth, 
Charleston is taken, and the rebels put to rout; 
And Beauregard the chivalrous, he ran to save his 
bacon— 
When he saw Gen. Sherman's " Yanks," and. 
" 
Charleston is taken !" 
Chorus. 
With a 
whack row de dow! 
A hunkey boy is Gdn. Sherman; 
Whack row de dow! 
Invincible is he. 
This South Carolina chivalry, they once did loudly 
boast ; 
That the footsteps of a 
Union man, should ne'er 
pollute their coast, 
They'd fight the Yankees two to one, who only 
fought for booty ;— 
But when the " Mudsills" came along it was 
" 
Legs do your duty." 
With a 
whack row de dow! 
Babylon is fallen; 
Whack row de dow! 
The end is drawing near. 
And from the " Sacred City," this valiant warlike 
throng ; 
Skedaddled in confusion, although thirty thou-
sand strong— 
Without a 
shot, without a 
blow, or least sign of re-
sistance, 
And leaving their poor friends behind, with the 
" 
YankeeS" for assMance. 
With a 
whack row de dow ! 
How are 3 
ou Southern chivalry'? 
Whack row de dew ! 
Your race is nearly run. 
And again o'er Sumpter's battered walls, the Stars 
and Stripes does fly, 
While the chivalry of Sixty-one in the "' Last 
ditch" lie;— 
With Sherman, Grant, and Porter too, to lead our 
men to glory ; 
We'll squash poor Jeff's confederacy, and then 
get " llunkydory." 
With a 
whack row de dow! 
lLiw are you neutral Johnny Bull'? 
hack row de dow ! 
We'll settle next with you. 
The Bounty Jumper. 
As sung by liooley's Minstrels. 
My song is of a 
fast young man whose name was 
Billy Wires, 
lie used to run with the machine and go to all the 
fires ; 
But as he loved a 
Soldier's life, and wished strange 
things to see, 
So the thought struck him that he would go and 
jump the Bounti ,e. 
At once he went to see a 
friend whose maiden name 
was Cal, 
When they started to the office of the Provost Mar-
shi-al, 
The Surgeon found that they would pass as either 
had no scars, 
And they received the Bounty of Five Hundred 
dol-liars. 
They were then marched into a 
room that was ex-
tremely near, 
Where they were dressed in the latest style as Union 
Cavaliers: 
Into thisroom they were locked up no long er 
to 
be 
free,  
Says Billy the first chance that I 
get, I'll jump the 
Bounti-e ! 
Three days elapsed when they were marched to the 
.Depot through the street, 
Says Cal to Billy lets get away, for nimble are our 
feet : 
As they got near the depot the guard told all to 
stop, 
When Billy and Cal as quick as you please popped 
into a 
Policy shop. 
When the guard found out that they were gone, 
they didn't know what to do; 
They went in every Gin Mill and searched the place 
all through; 
But their search was fruit-i-less as you may plainly 
see, 
For says Billy to Cal we're hunkey boys that have 
jumped the Bounti-e! 
As soon as they found that the guard had gone they 
resolved upon a 
spree, 
They travelled all around the town, the Elephant 
to see ; 
They treated everybody and to please all they tried' 
hard, 
But there was one whom the 
could not please for 
he happened to be the guard. 
Poor Cal was seized and hurried to jail his time 
there to serve out, 
But Billy escaped through the back door kir he 
knew that route; 
That nitzlit as Billy lay on his couch his sin he 
plainly did see, 
s 
In cheating thc) Government of funds in jumping 
the Bounti-e. 
He rolled all over that night in bed, to sleep he vain-' 
ly tried, 
He pitied Cal who in pris-u-on was, and resolved': 
on suicide, 
He purchased six dozen of wrought iron spikes and 
swallowed then' three by three, 
And that was the. last of Billy Wires who jumped 
the Bounti-e. 
The New Skedaddle. 
Written by EUGENE r. JOHNSON. 
As sung by EIooley's Minstrels. 
Now attention friends I 
pray, and list to me a 
min-
ute, 
A song t 
have to sing, there may be something in 
it ; 
The subject is quite old, the words all fiddle faddle, 
But when my story's told, I 
hope you won't " ske-•. 
dad.dle." 
Chorus. 
Hip, hip, boys, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over [Spoken—" What"' Taxes will 
" 
skedaddle." 
[Spoken..—" How are you, infernal revenue 'I"] 
By a 
man in Washington, this movement was fer-
mented, 
But at the first Bull Run they say it was invented ; 
Though our brave boys fought well, our officers in . 
the saddle. 
They made a move pell mell, which the people 
called " skedaddle." 
Hip, hip, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over [Spoken.— " What,"] jumpers 
will " skedaddle." 
[Spoken.-,-" How aro you, Bloomingdale Road ?"] 
Qur goodly land is filled with political war preach-
ers, 
Who love to.see blood spilled, [ the,Cheevers and the 
Beech ers, 
And loyal ",stay at homes," who in fat office squad-
And when the pay days come, laws 
how Green-
backs will " skedaddle." 
hip, hip, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over, [Spoken.—" Well,"] Provost 
Marshals will " skedaddle." 
[Spoken.—" How are you, Exemption Papers?"' 
Now poor Max in Mexico, he thinks he's " hunky-
. 
And 'Says that 
dory"  the Monroe Doctrine's but a 
story ; 
But when the war is over, we'll give him fal de 
And from the Aztec shore, we'll make the cove 
" 
skedaddle." 
Hip, hip, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over, [Spoken.—" What then?"] 
Blockade Runners will " skedaddle." 
[Spoken.—" How are you, neutral John Bull?'} 
There is Horace Greeley, now, who in the Tribune 
figures, 
He's loyal he'll avow, and dearly loves the niggers; 
But when he moves along, with his great martial 
straddle, 
" 
Nine hundred thousand" strong, the rebels will 
" 
skedaddle." 
Hip, hip, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over, [Spoken—" What next 1 " J 
King Shoddy will " skedaddle." 
[Spoken—" How are you, rotten vessels 11 
" 
Our Union right or wrong," be that our motto 
ever, 
And down with the dastard throng, who would that 
Union sever; 
Rebellion is played out, in the Gulf it soon will 
paddle, 
Then we'll all hail with a 
shout, " see the Chivalry 
skedaddle." 
Hip, hip, boys, hurrah, never mind the twaddle; 
When the war is over [Spoken—"Any more ?"] the 
Confederacy will " skedaddle." 
[Spoken—" How are you, Sacred Soil '?'] 
A Soldier in the Colored Brigade 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Old Uncle Abram wants us, and we're coming right 
along;

strong. 
Then fare you well, my honey dear, now don't you

CHORUS. 
A

l'se bound to be a 
soldier in de darkey brigade. 
Oh when we meet de enemy, I 'spect we make ' em 
stare, 
I 
tink he'll catch a 
Tarter, when he meets de woo-
ley hair; 
We'll fight while we are able, and in greenbacks 
will be paid, 
And I'll soon be a 
colonel in de colored brigade. 
A 
colonel, a 
colonel in de darkey brigade, 
And soon I'll be a 
colonel in de colored brigade. 
Wid musket on my shoulder, and wid banjo in my 
hand, 
For Union and de Constitution as it was I

We'll show dem what's de matter, in de colored 
brigade. 
Do matter, de matter, in de darkey brigade, 
We'll show dem what's do matter, in de darkey bri-
gade. 
In days of General Washington, we fought do Brit-
ish well, 
Behind de bales wid " hickory," I

and spade, 
And Greeley, he'll go wid us in de colored bri-
gade. 
Go wid us, go wid us, in de darkey brigade, 
And Greeley he'll go wid us in de darkey brigade. 
Some say dey lub de darkey and dey want him to

For him dey'd break dis Union, which de're fore-
fathers hab made,

'Worth more dan twenty millions of de darkey

And we'll raise up piccanninies for de darkey bri-
gade. 
Ninnies, ninnies for de darkey brigade, 
We'll raise up piccaninnies for de darkey brigade. 
Saturday Night. 
Written by E. 
BOWERS. 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
What mirth and play looks upon Saturday, 
Labor herself must lie sleeping to rest ; 
For Sunday with eating, no other day beating, 
Because they're all trying to show off their best. 
What a 
sight then at night, butcher's stalls gay 
and light, 
Marketing merrily, crowds upon crowds, 
Whbre are you shoving now l 
people keep moving 
now, 
Meat looks so tempting now, loads upon loads. 
CHORUS. 
Come and buy cheerily, dash away merrily, 
These are the humors of Saturday night. 
High Daddy Songster. 
t5 
Liquors are running now, nothing but funning now 
Laughing and cursing, 0, this is the go. 
Singers of ballads now, sellers of salads now, 
Ladie's caps, gentlemen's hats all in a 
heap. 
Praising them, raising them, soft one's amazing 
them, 
Goods good for nothing, they sell them so cheap. 
Into a 
brandy shop, in they hop, all for a 
little drop 
Market men standing there, talking away; 
You swear they inherit some troublesome spirit, 
All trying to soften and moisten their clay. 
Come and buy cheerily, &c. 
Oil on the Brain. 
9.s sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Yankees boast that they make clocks, 
Which just beat all creation; 
They never made one that could keep time 
With our great speculation. 
Our stocks like clocks go with a 
spring, 
Wind up, run down again; 
But all our stocks are sure to cause 
Oil on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
Stocks par, stocks up, 
Then on the wane, 
Everybody's troubled with 
Oil on the brain. 
Miss Simple drives her coach and four, 
And dresses in high style; 
And Mr. Shoddy courts her string, 
Because her dad's struck " ile." 
16 
High Daddy Songster. 
Tier jewels, laces, velvets, silks, 
Of which she is so vain, 
Were bought the time he had 
Oil on the brain. 
Stocks par, & c. 
You meet a 
friend upon the street, 
He greets you with a 
smile, 
And tells you in a 
business way, 
lie's just gone into " ile." 
He button-holes you half an hour; 
Of course you can't complain, 
Per you can see the fellow has 
Oil on the brain. 
Stocks par, &c. 
The lawyers, doctors, hatters, clerks, 
Industrious and lazy, 
Have put their money all in stocks, 
In fact they've " oil" gone crazy. 
They'd better stick to briefs and pills, 
Hat irons, inks, and pens, 
Or they will kick the bucket from 
Oil on the brain. 
Beautiful Lizzie 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
0, fair is the form of my own darling Lizzie, 
Her smile is as soft as the morn's early light; 
And with my poor heart this sweet maid is so busy, 
That 1 
to a 
shadow am dwindling outright. 
Her face is the index to all that is charming, 
Her form is as lovely as lovely can be, 
And she knocks at my heart with a 
clamor alarm-
ing, 
Her form is as lovely as lovely can be. 
And she knocks at my heart with a 
clamor alarm-
ing, 
My beautiful Lizzie, a 
cash la machree, 
CHORUS. 
My life and my soul, is my own little darling, 
0, she's brighter than starlight or sunbeam to 
me; 
And her voice is far sweeter than blackbird or star-
ling, 
My own little colleen, my sweet little colleen, 
My beautiful colleen, a 
cush la machree. 
My Lizzie is lovely and blooming and bonnie, 
Her cheeks shame the blush of the rose of the 
South; 
And the dew on her lips is far sweeter than honey, 
And graces in clusters hang round her dear 
mouth. 
Her voice has a 
gush of soft melody in it, 
A heaven of rapture it brings unto me ; 
Oh, ' tis sweeter than the song of the skylark or 
linnet, 
My beautiful Lizzie, a 
cush la machree. 
My life and my soul, &c. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Visions of the dear departed, 
Hover round with noiseless tread, 
Blessing me with smiles so loving, 
I 
can scarce believe them dead. 
Yes, I 
know a 
coming shadow 
Lies between their souls and mine, 
Mingled with sad tears and partings, 
Ushering in their spirit shrine. 
18 
High Daddy Songster. 
CHORUS. 
Visions of the dear departed, 
Hover round with noiseless tread, 
Blessing me with smiles so loving, 
I 
can scarce believe them dead. 
Brightly with the arching heavens, 
Shines the moon's refulgent rays, 
And her smiles so calm and placid, 
Leads me back to other days. 
Thrills me with a 
gentle dreaming, 
Such as I 
have known before, 
When young my heart thought the future 
Clothed in joy for evermore. 
Visions of the dear departed, &c. 
New Year's Calls. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you now, 
How the people on a New Year's set up a 
merry 
row; 
They harness up fast horses, and through the streets 
they cry, 
" 
Happy New Year to you all, Root Hog or Die." 
The gentlemen get up early to visit all the houses, 
They jockey- club their handkerchiefs, and strap 
down their trowsers; 
They kiss all the pretty girls in corners very sly, 
And may New Year's come every day, " Root Hog 
or Die." 
The ladies, they smile, if they never smiled before ; 
'Case every one that calls makes one number more; 
High Daddy Songster. 
19 
They mark it on their journals, and I 
think they 
mark it high. 
But of course they all do tell the truth, " Root 
Hog, or Die."

-44-0-4.  
Meet Me To-night. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Meet me to-night, dearest, down by the gate, 
Anxiously, longingly, for thee I'll wait; 
There while the lady moon softly reclines, 
There while her beaming eye lovingly shines; 
In sweetest dreams of thee, happy I'll wait, 
Eager to meet thee, love, down by the gate. 
CHORUS. 
Meet me to-night, dearest, down by the gate, 
Anxiously, longingly for thee I'll wait; 
In sweetest dreams of thee happy I'll wait, 
Eager to meet thee, love, down by the gate. 
Meet me to-night, dearest, day will soon close, 
Yonder the sun softly sinks to repose ; 
Love will awake as the starlights arise, 
On me will shine through thy dreamy blue eyes; 
Visions of joy will be mine as I 
wait, 
Eager to meet thee, love, down by the gate. 
I 
wish New Year's was Twice a Month. 
As sung by Henley's Minstrels. 
I 
kinder like a, New Year's Day, 
I 
swear I 
do, indeed: 
For then you see such peoty gals, 
And git such drink and feed. 
High Daddy Songster. 
20 
High Daddy Songster. 
And then you git 'em free of tax, 
And plenty on it tu, 
I 
wish New Year's was twice a 
month, 
Say neighbor, new, don't you 1 
CHORUS. 
Yes, yes, New Year's the day for us, 
We like it much indeed, 
For then we see such pooty gals, 
And git such drink and feed. 
Free lunch in everybody's house 
And licker all thrown in, 
And pooty " female waiters" tu, 
Tu pass the cake and gin; 
Yes, New Year's is the day for me, 
For then I 
save my cash, 
And live on something decent tu, 
And skip old Jones's hash. 
Yes, yes, &c. 
I 
made a 
half- a- dozen calls, 
And saw the gals and beauxs, 
All stuck up in their velvet chairs, 
Rigged up in Sunday clothes. 
And how them fellers did behave, 
The gals they acted wuss, 
I 
sought to crowd the fellows out, 
And did'nt care a 
cuss. 
Yes, yes, &c. 
The last call was the best, I 
swow, 
For there I 
stopped tu hours, 
A 
slaughtering hot whiskey skins, 
And paying my devours. 
2] 
And there I 
settled one big cake, 
That weighed a 
half a 
ton, 
Until I 
almost bust in tu 
I 
swow ' twos glorious fun. 
Yes, yes, &c. 
The gals they giggled dreadfully 
And kept a 
passin wine, 
And then again the whiskey skins, 
And thought the joke was fine. 
I " couldn't see it," so tu sleep 
I 
slid off on the floor, 
And that's the last I 
ever knew 
Until at Jones's door. 
Yes, yes, &c. 
I 
woke up in a 
hand cart, 0, 
My feet was hanging out, 
When Jones came grunting down the steps, 
And set up such a 
shout,

A Butterfly in the City. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Dear transient spirit of the field 
Thou com'st without distrust, 
To fan the sunshine of our streets, 
Among the noise and dust. 
Thou leadist in thy wandering flight 
My footsteps unaware, 
22 
High Daddy Songster. 
Until I 
seem to walk the vales 
And breathe thy native air. 
And thou hast fed upon the flowers, 
And drained their honied springs, 
'Till every tender hue they wear, 
is blooming on thy wings ; 
'Till every tender hue they wear, 
Is blooming on thy wings. 
Thou art like the poet's song, 
Arrayed in holy dyes; 
Though it hath drained the honied wells, 
Of flowers of Paradise. 
Though it hath brought celestial hues 
To light the way of life, 
The dust shall weigh its pinions down, 
Amid the noise and strife. 
And yet, perchance, some kindred soul, 
May see its glory shine, 
And feel its wings within his heart, 
As bright as I 
do thine; 
And feel its wings within his heart 
As bright as I 
do thine.

He must love his native country, and the Red,

No greater mark of merit could any mortal crown. 
Wanted—a

Wanted—a

Unless he's sound from head to foot, with perfect

Now, such a

To fight his country's battles in the land of Dixie. 
Wanted—a

Oh, Mother, hear my Dying Call. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Ah, well do I 
remember, mother, 
The day when we did part, 
The word farewell, how sad, dear mother, 
I 
thought ' twould break my heart. 
Thy gentle words, methinks I 
hear them now, 
As sweetly on my ear they fall, 
Uklibt 
tr, 
And now they're but a 
dream to me, 
Oh, mother, hear my dying call. 
CHORUS. 
I 
braved the raging battle 
And saw my noble comrades fall, 
I 
heard the muskets rattle, 
Oh, mother, hear my dying call. 
I'm passing fast away, my mother, 
The death damp's on my brow, 
Thy gentle hand I 
miss, dear mother, 
Oh! could it soothe me now. 
How oft the thought of home comes o'er me, 
My sisters dear, and brothers all, • 
While lying on this gory field, 
Oh, mother, hear my dying call. 
I 
braved the raging, &c. 
I'm calling for thee, oh, my mother, 
l'm breathing my last prayer ; 
In heaven we'll meet again, dear mother, 
To embrace each other there. 
I'm dying here upon the field of slain, 
Where many a 
noble one must fall, 
Ere peace shall bless our land again, 
Oh, mother, hear my dying call. 
I've braved the raging, & c. 
As sung by lIooley's Minstrels. 
White folks listen unto me, 
And what I 
have to say, 
'Tis of a 
gay young gal I'll sing, 
That lived upon Broadway, 
High Daddy Songster. 
Her name it was Augusta Jane, 
I'd have you all to know, 
And a 
clerk in a 
retail dry goods store, 
He was her gal-i-ent beau. 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
gay young dam-si-el, 
As ever you did know, 
And a 
clerk in a 
retail dry goods store, 
He was her gal-i-ent beau. 
As time flew by with this gay sport, 
All things did go serene, 
For, at knocking down his bosses cash 
lie wasn't very green. 
And all for to make Augusta 
Believe that he was rich, 
He used to tell so many stories, 
She couldn't tell t'other from which. 
She was a 
gay, & c. 
As goods fell short from off the shelf, 
This young man came to grief, 
And on his being arrested, 
"rwas proved he was a 
thief. 
And just because he had two things 
That really wasn't his'n, 
They cruelly did lock him up 
All in the Sing Sing Prison. 
She was a 
gay, &c. 
When Augusta Jane did hear the news, 
She went into hysterics, 
And the doctor straightway gave to her 
Some pills well known as 11m-ricks. 
She vow'd that she'd give up her life, 
For her dear sweet Clarence Tompkins, 
And she committed suicide, by eating 
A 
dozen hard boiled dumplings. 
As sung by Mooley's Minstrels. 
Yes, he's coming home, my darling, 
From the field where bloody Mars 
Holds his, carnival in honor, 
Of the dear old Stripes and Stars. 
And impatiently I'm waiting, ' 
While the tedious hours delay, 
For my gallant soldier-lover, 
Who is coming home to-day. 
CHORUS. 
0, my eyes were dim and tearful 
As I 
watched him go away, 
Looking, oh, so brave and fearless, 
But he's coming home to- day. 
In the thickest of the battle. 
It has been his fate to stand, 
Fighting as becomes a 
hero 
For his wronged and outraged land. 
But the fierce and angry missiles, 
From his heart were turned away, 
By a 
hand unseen and potent, 
And he's corning home to- day. 
0, my eyes were dim, & c. 
Solon Shingle. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Folks, I'm a 
Jarsey native, 
It isn't any braggin', 
My father fit in the revolution, 
He driv a 
baggage waggin. 
And one fine day he startid out, 
All fur tu git some full, 
But came back badly wownded, 
'Cos he had bin kicked by a 
muil. 
CHORUS. 
Jes so, jes so, strange things do come tu pass, 
Some pesky critter stole frum me, a 
barril of ap-

I 
courted Patty Biglow, 
But fur a

Or John Ellsley would have been my son, 
If he hadn't been old Jacks.

Jes so, jes so, & c.

And while I 
talked about old Si, 
And Nobby, my blooming lass, 
Some critter from my waggin stole 
A barrill of apple sass. 
Jes so, jes so, &c.

Perhaps," thinks I, " this Otis boy, 
Who stole a

Did steal my sass," so off I

And into court I 
came, 
Got swered right through, and tuk a

Says I, " here judge, hand me a

They thought I

They made but little out of me, 
Or my barrill o' apple sass. 
Jes so, jes so, & c.

Any feller what ' ud steal a

No pint o' morrils passed;

The Cottage in the Vale. 
As sung by liooley's Minstrels. 
Thoughts of childhood now steal o'er me, 
And its scenes go flitting by ; 
Dreamlike now they pass before me, 
Cloudless like a 
summer sky. 
High Daddy Songster. 
Happy were the days when wandering 
Gaily over hill and dale, 
Happier far to me the memory 
Of the cottage in the vale. 
Happier far to me the memory 
Of the cottage in the vale. 
Dreaming, I 
behold the roses. 
Running o'er the trellis'd door, 
And I 
hear the purling brooklet 
Flowing'on its pebbly floor ; 
Ali. methinks I 
love to linger 
On its shore in yonder dale, 
And review the pleasant memories, 
Of the cottage in the vale. 
And review the pleasant memories 
Of the cottage in the vale. 
There a 
mother gave her blessing, 
As from thence I 
went to roam, 
And she bade me e'r remember, 
Loving friends I 
left at home. 
And, as far away I 
wander, 
As o'er ocean's billows sail, 
Still I 
cherish pleasant memories, 
Of the cottage in the vale. 
Still I 
cherish pleasant memories, 
Of the cottage in the vale.

Shoulder Straps. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Pray tell me, mamma, what the shoulder straps 
mean, 
That on the blue coats of our officers gleam; 
You know they're so different, why should it be, 
Not even the uniform buttons agree ; 
I've notice'd for instance a 
blank and a 
bar, 
Two bars, leaves of silver, of gold and a 
star, 
Two stars and an eagle, now what may it mean, 
On scarlet or orange, light blue or green." 
" 
Now, listen, my daughter, and wisely take heed; 
• 
The income and strap of a 
beau are agreed; 
Though you dance with a 
leaf, and flirt with a 
bar, 
Reserve your best 'smiles for the eagle and star. 
For remember, the fence with nothing within, 
Belongs to the soldier whose spurs are to win. 
A 
second lieutenant, perchance still in debt 
For clothes he wore out as a 
West Point cadet. 
" 
And if on the field a 
bright bar should appear, 
Your prudence, my darling, may still bid 3 
on fear. 
If left a 
lone widow, the pension's so small, 
Your gloves and first mourning would swallow it 
all. 
And e'en with your captain who flourishes two, 
Defer the gay line to the staff's deeper blue; 
For the difference per month, when drawing their 
pay, 
With rations and forage, quite wiles one away. 
" 
Next in order are leaves, but here you reverse 
Each value metalic in prose or in verse; 
Though golden the major's, a 
silvery hue 
Marks lieutenant colonel on scarlet or blue. 
Then over the forest, and ' neath the bright stars, 
The eagle soars lord of the leaves and the bars ; 
Besides, ' tis suggestive of eagles that fly 
When the Colonel's fair wife her bonnets would buy. 
32 
High Daddy Songster. 
" 
Above all, my darling, remember the star, 
Though set ' neath a 
silver head, better by far 
To catch some old General, then make him afraid 
You won't be the first to command a 
brigade." 
"I've heard you, dear mother, and thought it all o'er, 
My heart's with the lover who went to the war. 
You know the poor boy has not even a 
bar, 
But I'd rather be his than the bride of a 
star." 
As sung by lIooley's Minstrels. 
It's some years ago I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw daylight with my two blessed eyes, 
When my dad was away, I 
was born, so they say 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy, and said what a 
fine boy, 
Put a 
stick in my fist by way of a 
toy, 
Faith, there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said, some day I'd give some one a 
warming.

Paddy is the boy that is fond of a

Dear auld Dublin's the place for me, 
And Donnybrook's the place for to go on a 
spree. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair poor Paddy is there, 
He will fight friend or foe, if they do him offend, 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
A smile on his face adorning. 
With his little colleen, he will dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman there in his glory is seen; 
Play a 
reel or a 
jig, he dont care a 
fig, 
But he'll dance till daylight in the morning. 
For Paddy is & c.

Now, boys, do you mind, you never will find. 
Such a 
dear little place as that over the way, 
Long, long may it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear old St. Patrick was born in. 
May the girls young and old, may the boys brave 
and bold, 
Unite heart and hand to protect the dear isle, 
And morn, noon, and night, may joy and delight 
Shine on them like a 
sunshiny morning.

Hornsey Wood. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels 
One day I 
went out walking, 
With such a 
nice young girl, 
She smiled as we were talking, 
And shook each glossy curl. 
She'd patent boots upon her feet, 
Her gloves were made of kid, 
She said I'd better stand a 
treat; 
I 
said I 
would, and did. 
CHORUS. 
Yes indeed, I 
really, 
Yes I 
really did. 
She said, I'd better stand a 
treat. 
I 
said. I 
would, and did. 
A 
ride she much desired— 
She thought ' twould do me good— 
A Hansom cab she hired— 
We went to Hornsey wood. 
The driver was a 
civil man 
And drove where he was bid. 
She said she quite enjoyed it, 
And I 
really think she did. 
35 1 
34 
High Daddy Songster. 
Yes, indeed I 
really 
Yes I 
really did, 
She said that she felt hungry 
Would I 
treat her, so I 
did. 
We both sat down together, 
And had a 
jolly lunch, 
And when I 
asked her whether 
She'd take a 
glass of punch— 
She merely answered with a 
wink, 
And closed one little lid, 
The punch caine in, I 
begged she'd drink, 
To tell the truth, she did. 
Yes indeed, she really, 
Yes, she really did, 
She said ' twas nice, she liked it , 
And it seemed as if she did. 
Glass after glass soon followed, 
I 
thought she'd tie'er be done; 
So quickly each was swallowed, 
I 
counted twenty-one. 
She got so drunk, why how I 
longed 
Of her presence to be rid; 
She swore that she belonged to me, 
And the landlord thought she did. 
Yes indeed, she really, 
Yes, she really did, 
She swore that she belongea to me, 
And the landlord thought she did 
I 
paid the man his fare, and then 
Let her ride home alone ; 
I 
walked tho distance by myself, 
And found my watch was gone. 
How much my folly I 
repent, 
In shame my head I 
hid ; 
To make me think of her she meant, 
And to tell the truth, she did. 
• 
High Daddy Songster. 
Yes, indeed she really, 
Yes, she really did ; 
To make me think of her she meant, 
And to tell the truth, she did.

Ah, the pretty girls of Fulton street, are first rate

With eyes like gas lights shining, and their pretty 
shoulders bare; 
Their glances are so wicked, and they've got so 
much to say, 
Ah, the pretty girls of Brooklyn, what angels isn't 
they 7 
They are like a 
bed of Mignionette, or roses in full 
bloom; 
That scents the air a 
mile around, with their pre-
cious strong perfume. 
Their kisses are all sweetness, we can scarcely keep 
away, 
The pretty girls of Fulton street, what comforters 
are they. 
They're delighted when we please them, if we snub 
them won't they cry 
And swoon away, provided there's a 
glass of bran-
dy nigh. 
High Daddy Songster. 
Oh, happy is the young man that's got five or six,

The pretty girls of Brooklyn, what pretty girls are 
they. 
Then let us like brave Trojans do the thing towards 
them neat, 
Nor give them time to ask you when you're going

And that none of them will die old maids, let's all 
sincerely pray, 
The pretty girls

ducks are they.

The Candidate's Appeal.

One evening I 
was walking down 
The crowded promenade, 
A mammoth poster caught my eye, 
Upon a

When I 
hastened to the City Hall 
To see the great mass meeting; 
And there I 
heard a 
brilliant speech, 
Well worthy of repeating. 
CHORUS. 
Choose your candidates, my friends, 
And listen to my joke; 
For friends I 
hope we'll ever be, 
Whichever way you vote. 
[Spoken.)— This is what the speaker said :— 
The crisis is approaching fast, 
When we must use our power 
Let every traitor to the cause 
Dread that eventful hour. 
My foreign friends I 
welcome you, 
To this our trysting ken; 
For you are nature's Democrats.

Think on their welfare when you vote.

Ours is a

Stand firm as solid rock and we 
Shall conquer, (great applause.) 
Mark our proud eagle as he flies, •

And put some salt upon his tail,

Crush out the negro worshippers. 
(Some symptoms of a 
row.) 
If there be any here to-night, 
Would like to have my card, 
They'll find roe in the liquor shop, 
Up in the Eighteenth Ward. 
Choose your, &c. 
Aly fellow men I 
am a 
man 
By envious malice crushed; 
But if you cast your votes for me, 
I'll pay you well, (he blushed.) 
I 
go for freedom of the press, 
(Reporters pricked their ears ; ) 
I 
deprecate the liquor law, 
(Here Greeley left in tears.) 
Choose your, &c. 
My friends the lights have all gone out, 
And ere we disappear, 
I 
think 'twould be advisable 
To take some lager beer. 
I 
turned me sadly from the scene, 
And to myself did say, 
These politics are all humbugs, 
And humbugs rule the day. 
Choose your, &c. 
The Obstinate Man. 
Written by J. H. 
BITOWORTH. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
I've run against many strange folks in my time, 
Some nervous, some absent, some queer and some 
prime; 
Some foolish, some witty, and some fond of laugh, 
And others a 
great deal too clever by half. 
But the subject of my little song, if no fool 
Was as obstinate as a 
Jerusalem mule. 
CHORUS. 
Of all obstinate, buffers, beat him if you can, 
Did you ever come near such an obstinate man 7 
Of obstinate fellows, he's surely the worst, 
When going to bed he'll get in feet first; 
And come out feet first in the morning ' tis said, 
And lie with his head at the foot of the bed; 
Puts his trousers on bottom end up, and what's 
more, 
Tries to force on his top boots, hind side betore. 
Of all obstinate, &c. 
Like Paddy from Cork, when two sheets in the wind, 
He actually wears his coat buttoned behind; 
Whenever he reads a 
newspaper or book, 
Upside down, ten to one, he'll hold it by hook or 
by crook; 
As a 
cure for the toothache, he always gets bled, 
And his spectacles wears at the back of his head, 
Of all obstinate, &c. 
When ill, he was ordered a 
warm bath, ' tis said, 
So the obstinate fool had a 
cold one instead ; 
A 
lotion was sent him for bathing his skin, 
And a 
mixture likewise to be taken within ; 
Yet warned of the danger, all was no use ' 
He would drink the lotion, which nigh cooked his 
goose. 
Of all obstinate, &c. 
He says it's all stuff ' bout the world's turning ' round, 
Every house in its proper place he always found; 
He's been up at all times in the night from his bed, 
But never found himself standing top of his head. 
He vows if the world was to play such a 
prank, 
The sea would run over as sure as the bank. 
Of all obstinate, & c. 
He won't eat when he's hungry, or drink when 
he's dry, 
And takes mustard and pepper with raspberry 
pie; 
He says of pig's bacon it cannot be pork, 
And he's spooney enough to eat broth with a 
fork; 
When he's dreadfully tired, [ it's no use to chide,] 
He hires a 
cab, and then runs by the side. 
Of all obstinate, &c. 
On a 
soaking wet day for a 
walk out he'll roam, 
And leaves his overcoat and umbrella at home; 
High Daddy Songster. 
But in July, or August, the obstinate goat 
Wears a 'thick overcoat buttoned close to his 
throat; 
And would you believe it, whenever it snows 
In a 
pair of nankeens or white ducks out he goes. 
Of all obstinate, &c. 
Ile laughs fit to burst at a 
serious play, 
And will have his hair cut on a 
bitter cold day; 
Cursed his dad and his birthday —the obstinate loon, 
Both happened to fall on the twentieth of June. 
No one can persuade him a 
jot, I'll engage, 
But that him and his father were both the same 
age. 
Of all obstinate, 8ce. 
Good Doctrines. 
Written by J. H. BUDWORTH. 
As sung by Hooley's Ilinstrols, 
Twelve parsons once went to a 
squire's to dine, 
Who was famous for giving good venison and wine; 
All great friends to the cloth with good living in 
view, 
Quite graceful they sat down as good parsons 
should do. 
CHORUS. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
A wicked young whipster, our worthy squire's 
Whispered, 
co usin, 
llisin, I 
boldly will lay you a 
dozen, 
Though here we've a 
dozen staunch parsons, God 
Not one of the twelve has a 
prayer-book got." 
Derry down, & c. 
" 
Agreed," cried the squire, " coz we must not be 
loth, 
Such a 
wager to lay for the sake of the cloth; 
The parsons, no doubt, to confute you are able, 
So well bring with the dinner, the bet on the table." 
Derry down, & c. 
Dinner came, cried the squire, " a 
new grace I 
will 
say 
Has any one here got a 
prayer- book, pray 7" 
Quite glum looked the friends, coughed, and with 
one accord 
Cried, " mine's lost," " mine's at home," mine's at 
church, by the Lord." 
Derry down, &c. 
Quoth our cousin, " dear squire, I 
my wager have 
won, 
But another 1 
purpose to win, ere I've done; 
Though the parsons could not bring a 
prayer-book 
to view, 
I 
the same bet will lay, they have each a 
cork-
screw." 
Derry down, &c. 
" 
Done, done," roared the squire, " Halloa, butler 
bring nearer, 
That excellent magnum of ancient Madeira." 
'Twas brought—' let's decant it, a 
cork-screw, good 
John l" 
Here each of the parsons roared out, " I've got one." 
Derry down, & c. 
MORAL. 
But let us not censure our parsons for this, 
When a 
thing's in its place, it can ne'er be amiss; 
Prayer- books wont serve for cork- screws, and I'm 
such a 
sinner, 
Though a 
sermon I'd like, I 
don't want it at dinner. 
Derry down, &c. 
High Daddy Songster.

John cried, I 
am a 
stupid elf 
To be jeered by all the people; 
But 1'11 hang ray cares up with myself, 
So he hung himself in the steeple. 
CHORUS. 
[Spoken.}—And there little Johnny Bell bung dan-
gling, along with the great Tom Bell, and all the 
rest of the bells to the tune of Ding dong, ding 
dong, ding dong. 
The ringers came who rang so well, 
And found as the story tells, 
Among the rope.s, the rope where Bell, 
Was hanging among the Bells: 
We came to ring a 
merry round 
For mutton and trimmings, they said— 
Our mutton's lost, but we have found 
A man as mutton dead. 
[Spoken.)—We pay no toll, said they, although we 
toll for pay, but, however, as Johnny Bell was a 
man of mettle, and a 
sound fellow, we'll give him a 
sound gratis, to make all square, to the tune of— 
Ding dong, &c. 
They cut him down, and quickly found, 
Poor Johnny was not dead; 
His mortultin rope '
tis true was cut, 
Not so his vital thread. 
" 
Why did you do this act so dread," 
They one and all did cry ; 
Poor Johnny stared at them, and said 
I 
hung myself to try. 
[Spoken]—" I 
know," said he, " good judges try 
before they hang, but there's an exception with 
bells— for they must be hung before they are tried, 
or else how can folks tell if they'll ring to the tune 
of—Ding'dong, & . 
High Daddy Songster. 
While Johnny Bell hung there, ' tis true 
The steeple high to deck, 
Mistress Bell was hanging too 
'Round Major Georg-'s 
neck. 
John caught them both, and to enrage her, 
He thumped the Major's nob; 
For Johnny Bell, he loved no Major, 
But merry Major Bob.

When the War is Over, Mary

As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Sadly now the breeze is blowing, 
Comrades all around me sleep; 
But my thoughts are far away, love, 
While my lonely Wach I 
keep. 
Fondly now niSr heart is telling, 
Joys that coming days will bring, 
Wheii the war is over, Mary, 
When the bells of peace shall ring. 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more for me, dear Mary, 
Soon I'll clasp you to my heart; 
When the war is over, Mary, 
We shall meet no more to part. 
In the long and weary marches, 
In the battle's fearful din, 
Where our true and noble soldiers, 
Fame and honor strive to win, 
Like the starlight love has cheered me, 
Shining o'er me in the gloom; 
And your words of kindness, Mary, 
Make my heart with pleasure bloom. 
Weep no more, &c.

The Jersey Lovers. 
Written by T. A. JOHNSTON. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Of a 
heartrending trad-gi-dy, 
A story I 
will tell, 
Concerning a 
maid named Sa-ri Jane. 
And a 
youth called Sam- u- el. • 
They loved each other ten-der-ly, 
And the Jersey people said, 
That before this cruel war was o'er, 
" 
These lov-i-ers would be wed." 
One day as Sam was taking a 
walk, 
By the Elysian fields it seems 
He spied his charming Sa-ri Jane, 
Walking with his rival, Jeems. 
He jumped and raved upon the grass, 
And his golden locks he tore, 
Saying " Fare you well, my Sa-ri Jane, 
You ne'er shall see me more. 
Then he ran down by the river side, 
But being out of breath, 
He fell down on a 
big clam- shell, 
And scraped himself to death. 
When Sa-ri Jane she heard of this, 
She gave a 
piercing squall; 
Then tied a 
grindstone round her neck, 
And jumped in the raging canawl.

Parody on Just Before the Battle, Mother. 
Written by E. 
T. 
JOHNSON. 
Sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Just before the battle, Mother, 
I 
was drinking morning dew; 
And when I 
saw the rebels marching, 
Unto the rear I 
quickly flew ; 
Where all the stragglers were flying, 
Thinking of their homes or wives; 
It was not the rebs they feared, dear 
Mother, 
But their own dear precious lives. 
CHORUS. 
Then farewell, mother,you will never, 
See my name among the slain; 
For if I 
only can skedaddle, 
Dour mother, I'll come home again. 
I 
have no thirst for martial glory, ' 
Fame and honor's all my eye; 
I'd rather be a 
home- guard private, 
Than a 
brigadier come home to die. 
Salt horse and crackers, dearest mother, 
Are not the things to make one brave; 
And I 
assure you I 
have no ambition 
To fill an early, honored grit Ve. 
Then farewell, & c. 
I 
hear the bugle sounding, mother, 
(My soul is eager for the tray ;) 
I 
guess I'll hide beneath some cover, 
And. then I 
will be all 0. K. 
Discreth;n's the better part of valor, 
At least I've often heard you say; 
And he that loves his life, dear mother, 
Must fight if he would run away. 
Then farewell, & c.

Three Part Medley. 
Written by J. 11. Budworth. 
PART FIRST. 
The Nightingale Club in a 
village was held, 
At the sign of the cabbage and shears, 
Where the singers, no doubt, would have greatly 
excelled 
But for want of--
Four and twenty fiddlers all of a 
row 
Four and twenty fiddlers, 
Peacefully elumbering. 
At the town of neat Clogheen 
Where— 
The graces they were gathering posies 
And found— 
The finest ram, sir, that ever was fed on hay, 
This ram was fat behind, sir, this ram was fat 
before, 
This ram was— 
A 
flaxen- headed cow-boy, as simple as may be, 
And next, a 
merry plough- boy, who whistled 
Old King Cole was a 
merry old soul, 
And a 
merry old soul was he ; 
He called for  
The lass of ratio's mill, so bonny, blithe and gay 
In spite of all my skill, she stole-
4 
bold dragoon, with his-
0, dear, what can the matter be? 
Dear, dear, what can the matter be 7 
For of all the girls that are so smart 
There's none like pretty Sally, 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives with  
Robin Adair. 
What made the ball so fine, 
What made the Assembly shine 7 
Oh, it was— 
The rum old 'commodore, 
For the bullets and the gout, 
Have so knocked his hull about, 
That he'll never more be fit for— 
The maid of Lodi, who sweetly sung— 
Call again to- morrow—call again to- morrow, 
Can't you, can't you, call again to-morrow. 
PART SECOND. 
A master I 
have, and I 
am his man, 
Galloping dreary dun, 
And he'll get  
A regiment of Irish Dragoons and they were quar-
tered 
In a 
mouldering cave, the abode of despair, 
As Columbia sat weeping her loss, 
She mourned for brave Elsworth, and exclaimed 
in despair, 
'Twas in the good ship Rover, 
I 
sailed the world around ; 
And for ten years and over, 
I 
never saw 
Roy's wife of Ablivallocb, 
Roy's wife of Aldivalloch, 
Wot ye how she cheated me,— 
In the Bay of Biscay, 0, 
Cease, rude Boreas, blustering railer, 
List, ye landsmen, all to me, 
Messmates, hear a 
brother sailor, 
Sing— 
Oh, hush thee, my darling, the hour will soon 
come, 
When thy sleep shall be broken by 
The wood- pecker tapping the hollow beach tree, 
The wood- pecker tapping— 
Poor Sally's wooden ware, 
Who all for money barters— 
Her cottons, tapes, her top-knots rare, 
Her bodkins, lace, and— 
Paddy Shannon, high mounted on his trotting 
little pony, 
Who set off on a 
journey, from Maiden Lane to the 
Bowery, 
To ogle Widow Wilkins, whom he courted for her 
money, 
And tugging at his bridle, cried, 
Don't I 
look spruce on my donkey'? 
In spite of his kicking and prancing, 
Gee up, and come hither, boy, steady, 
Mr. Donkey, I'm not fond ot dancing— 
When absent from her, whom my soul holds so 
dear, 
What a 
medley, what a 
medley of— 
Old chairs to mend, old chairs to mend !— 
A 
very good song, and very well sung, 
And we're jolly companions every one. 
Thus, the Nightingale Club, daily kept up their 
clamor, 
And we're nightly knocked down by the president's 
hammer, 
We're nightly knocked down by the president's 
hammer. 
PART THIRD. 
Your pardon, kind gentlefolks, pray, 
I'm called once more to roar out a 
song, sir, 
And when a 
man's called on they say, 
Come bustle, neighbor Prig, 
Buckle on your hat and wig, 
In your Sunday clothes so gaily— 
Together we will range the fields— 
When the wolf in nightly prowl, 
Bays the moon with— 
Will you come to the bower I've shaded for you'? 
High Daddy Songster. 
61 
Your bed shall be— 
On that spot, in ancient lore oft named 
Where--
Giles Scroggins courted Molly Brown, 
Ri tol de riddle lol de ray; 
The fairest wench in all the town, 
Ri tol de riddle lol de ray. 
If you love me as I 
love you— 
On this cold flinty rock, I 
will lay down my head, 
And sweetly I'll sing— 
Bound prentice to a 
waterman, I 
learn'd a 
bit to 
row, 
But bless your heart, I 
always was so gay, 
That to treat— 
An old woman in Yorkshire, in Yorkshire she did 
She loved— 
Billy Taylor, a 
brisk young fellow, 
Full of mirth and full of glee, 
And his mind he did diskiver 
To a 
frog who would a 
wooing go, 
Heigho, says lowly. 
Whether his mother would let him or no, with his— 
Here's a 
health to all good lasses, 
And that ends my song. 
Gun Cotton. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
A 
great discovery's been made, 
To give our foes a 
dusting; 
Gunpowder mills, just now ' tis said, 
With rage are nearly bursting. 
For nothing in the world of late, 
High Daddy Songster. 
63 
62 
High Daddy Songster. 
Has made a 
noise more louder, 
Than the famed gun cotton meant by state, 
To supersede gunpowder. 
CHORUS. 
Row de dow, dow,dow, gunpowder now, 
Will quickly be forgotten; 
For every one who sports a 
gun, 
Will use the famous cotton. 
Since cotton's got to such a 
pitch, 
Of expensiveness—young ladies 
Will dread all articles—(though rich,) 
Of cotton now that made is. 
To be, " laid up in cotton," now 
Will be (don't speak it louder) 
Like sitting by the fire I 
vow, 
On a 
barrel of gunpowder. 
Row de dow, &c. 
If a 
cotton umbrella you own, my friend, 
Pray throw it away, don't tarry ; 
As such a 
thing, you just as well 
A 
loaded gun might carry. 
Don't cotton nightcaps wear—they might 
While you're asleep, ' tis said, sir, 
Go off with a 
bang, fiz, in the night, 
And blow you out of bed, sirs. 
Row de dow, &c. 
Our soldiers brave, when going to war, 
Thanks to the inventor's brains, now, 
Instead of rounds of cartridge, lor, 
They'll be served with rounds of skeins, now. 
And if while fighting they run short, 
(Despite the enemies mockings,) 
Being cotton here's a 
happy thought, 
They can use their shirts and stockings. 
Row de dow, &c. 
What paper's made of you'll agree, 
Young ladies ought to mark this, 
"Cis dangerous, especially 
When sending to a 
spark, Miss. 
Cheap handkerchiefs I 
look upon, 
As destructive too—(don't scoff, sirs), 
Though bought to blow your noses on, 
They might, perhaps, blow 'ern off, sirs. 
Row de dow, &c. 
Wake Nicodemus. • 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels, 
Nicodemus, the slave, was of African birth, 
And was bought for a 
bagful of gold; 
He was reckoned as part of the salt of the earth, 
But he died years agd, very old. 
'Twas his last sad request, so we laid him away 
In the trunk of an old hollow tree. 
" 
Wake me up," was his charge, " at the first 
break of day, 
Wake me up for the great Jubilee." 
cif ORIJS. 
The Good Time Coming is almost here, 
It was long, long, long en the way, 
Now run and tell Elijah to hurry up Pomp, 
And meet us at the gum-
tree down in the swamp, 
To wake Nicodemus to- day. 
He was known as a 
prophet, at least was as wise, 
For he told of the battles to come ; 
And we trembled with dread when he roll'd up his 
eyes, 
And we heeded the shake of his thumb. 
Though he clothed us with fear. yet the garments 
he wore. 
64 
High Daddy Songster. 
Were in patches at elbow and knee; 
And he still wears the suit that he used to of yore, 
As he sleeps in the old hollow tree. 
The Good Time, &c. 
Nicodemus was never the sport of the lash, 
Though the bullet has oft crossed his path; 
There was none of his masters so brave or so rash, 
As to face such a 
man in his wrath. 
Yet his great heart with kindness was filled to the 
brim, 
He obe.
ted, who was born to command; 
But he longed for the morning which then was so 
dim, 
For the morning which now is at hand,. 
The Good Time, 8cc. 
'Twas a 
long weary night, we were almost in fear 
That the future was more than he knew; 
'Twas a 
long weary night, but the morning is near, 
And the words of our prophet are true. 
There are signs in the bky that the darkness is 
gone, 
There are tokens in endless array; 
While the storms which had seemingly banished 
the dawn, 
Only hastens the advent of day. 
The Good Time, &c. 
I'm Lonely Since My Mother died. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
Tho' friends and kindred gather near, 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent heartfelt tear. 
High Daddy Songster. 
65 
Of earthly friends she was the best, 
My erring youthful steps to guide; 
Oh. do not smile because I 
weep, 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHORUS. 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
'rho' friends and kindred gather near, 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent heartfelt tear. 
You may not deem it brave or strong, 
To let these tears so often flow, 
But those who've lost a 
mother's love, 
Can tell the pains of my sad woe. 
Could I 
but call her back again, 
And kneel once more down by her side, 
I'd love her better than before— 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
I'm lonely, &c. 
Oh, you who have a 
mother dear, 
Let not a 
word or act give pain, 
But cherish, love her with your life, 
You ne'er can have her like again. 
Then when she's called from you away, 
Across death's dark and troubled tide, 
In pain with me you need not say, 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
I'm lonely, &c.

As sung by Hooley's Minstrel. 
Now, gentle ladies, list awhile, 
And look wid kindness on dis chile ; 
High Daddy Songster.

I'm always happy, never fret, 
'Case I'm Sassy Will, de ladies' pet.

I

To kiss de ladies' pet. 
Swinging in the Lane. 
Published by permission of CHARLES CARROLL SAWYER. 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels 
How oft we talked of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play 
Upon each other, while at school, 
To pass the time away. 
But oh, how often have I 
longed, 
For those bright days again, 
When little Rosy Nell andI 
Went swinging in the lane. 
CHORUS. 
But yet I'd give the world to be, 
With Rosy Nell again, 
I 
never, never will forget, 
Our swinging in the lane. 
The boys and girls would often go 
A 
fishing in the brooks, 
With epools of thread for fishing lines, 
And bended pins for hooks. 
They sometimes wished me with them but 
They always wished in vain; 
I'd rather be with Rosy Nell, 
A 
swinging in the lane. 
But yet, &a. 
But soon a 
cloud of sorrow came— 
& 
strange young man from town, 
Was introduced to Rosy Nell, 
By aunt Jemima Brown. 
She stayed away from school next day— 
The truth to me was plain, 
She'd gone off with that old city chap, 
A swinging in the lane. 
But yet, Soa. 
High Daddy Songster. 
69 
Now all young men with tender hearts, 
Pray take advice from me— 
Don't be so quick to fall in love 
With every girl you see; 
For if you do, you soon will find, 
You've only loved in vain; 
She'll go off with some other chap, 
A•swinging in the lane. 
But yet, &c.

As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
The boys are coming home again, 
This war will soon be o'er, 
The North and South again will stand, 
United as of yore. 
Yes, hand in hand, and arm in arm, 
. Together they will roam; 
Oh! won't we have a 
happy time 
When all the boys come home. 
We'll have no more false hopes and fears, 
No more heart-rending sighs; 
The messenger of peace will dry 
The weary mourner's eyes. 
We'll laugh and sing, we'll dance and play, 
All, wait until they come, 
And joy will crown the happy day 
When all the boys come home. 
How proud our nation then will stand, 
United ever more— 
We'll bid defiance to the foe 
That dare approach our shore ; 
Well hoist the good old flag again, 
On Freedom's lofty dome, 
And live in peace and happiness, 
When all the boys come home. 
CHORUS. 
We'll hoist the good old flag again, 
On Freedom's lofty dome; 
And live in peace and happiness, 
When all the boys come home. 
I 
Dreamed My Boy was Home Again. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Lonely, weary, broken-hearted, 
As I 
lay me down to sleep, 
Thinking of the day we parted, 
When you told me not to weep. 
Soon I 
dreamed that peaceful angels 
hovered o'er the battle plain; 
Singing songs of joy and gladness, 
And my boy *as home again. 
CHORUS. 
How well I 
know such thoughts of joy, 
Such dreams of bliss are vain; 
f 
My heart is sad, my tears will flow, 
Until my boy is home again. 
Tears were changed to loud rejoicings, 
Night was turned to endless day! 
Lovely birds were sweetly singing, 
Flowers bloomed in bright array, 
Old and young seemed light and cheerful, 
Peace seemed everwhere to reign; 
My poor heart forgot its sorrow, 
For my boy was home again. 
How well, &c. 
But the dream is past ; 
and with it 
All my happiness is gone; 
Cheerful thoughts of joy have vanished! 
I 
must still in sorrow mourn. 
Soon may peace with all its blessings, 
Our unhappy land reclaim ; 
Then my tears will cease their flowing, 
And my boy be home again. 
&c.
