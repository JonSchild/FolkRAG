JEPPE'S " JOLLY JOCKY BOY" SONGSTER. ' 
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCII OF JEPPE, THE PARLOR 
COMIQUE. 
THE subject of our sketch, Jephtha Delano, was born in Charlestown, a 
suburb of Boston, Mass., and graduated with honors at high school of the 
latter city, where his brother, C. II. Delano, the well-known diamond set-
ter and manufacturer of fine jewelry, of the firm of Guild & Delano, is en-
gaged in business. 
Jeppe, after leaving school, served under the watch-
ful eye of his brother, and in a 
few years mastered the art of engraving, 
diamond setting, and the different branches of the jewelry trade 
During 
this time be appeared at several amateur concerts and charitable benefits, 
having a 
fine voice, a 
musical taste, and the elements of a 
humorist, his 
services were always in demand on such occasions, and he cultivated his 
talents more as an amusement than as a 
profession, until his abilities at-
tracted the attention of several well-known managers. Among others Mr. 
Wm. Peak, Sr, at that time one of the most successful concert managers 
in the country, and Jeppe accepted a 
very liberal offer from him to join the 
celebratel Peak Family Bell Ringers and Vocalists; and made his first 
appearance as a 
professional at Hagerstown, Md., June 18th, 1869, and as-
sumed the name of Jeppe, fearing, like all modest debutants, that his first 
appearance would be unsucce ,sful; but his fears were groundless, as his 
great originality and talent soon became the principal attraction with the 
above troupe, Miss Fannie, a 
member of the Peak Family to whom he was 
married, appearing with him in operatic duets and fashionable character 
duets, a 
line of business entirely original with him, which, with his single 
lightning changes and dialect songs of different nations, prove immensely 
popular, he being one of the few that can cater to the refined tastes with-
out resorting to vulgarity--being the originator of the celebrated Flirtation 
Duets and other specialties. 
Jeppe is still young, but enjoys a 
reputation 
that many old professionals may well envy, and we anticipate a 
most bril-
liant career before him. 
This book contains some of his latest and best songs, with many others 
he has made popular, and is offered to the public on its merits alone. 
THE JOLLY JOCKY BOY. 
Written expressly for and sung with great success by JEPPE. 
Words and Music by a AEG. POND. 
W HEN daylight first begins to peep, 
I 
then brush round the track ; 
The little roan begins to leap 
When I'm astride his back ; 
For I'm a 
nobby jockey boy, 
And know what I 
am a-doing ; 
The girls they smile, and look so coy, 
Whenever a 
race is brewing. 
REFRAIN 
Hey ! g'lang ! 
You needn't never fret, 
I'm the chap, the jockey boy that's bound to win, von bet. 
SPOKEN.-GPfIllg! 
All by myself I 
train my stock, 
And find out all their muscle: 
I 
know the points of every boy, 
And who atm stand the tussle; 
But when a 
race is on the taps, 
You better believe I'm there, 
My team ahead of all the chaps, 
With my little bay Morgan mare. 
Hey! g'lang, etc. 
To get the pole I 
always try 
When up to the stand we come; 
Then taps the bell, Oh, whew, my eye, 
But doesn't I 
make it hum. 
I 
go a 
rattling gait—I 
do! 
With nip and tuck sail in ; 
On the Lome stretch it's all, " all for Joe," 
Steady, boy ! I'm bound to win. 
Hey ! g'lang, etc. 
That's so, and that's just what's to pay, 
When in the twenties I 
skeet; 
But if %ray down the teens I 
lay, 
Bet your life they all cry beat !, 
A 
nobby, jockey boy am 1, 
And draw the lines so steady, 
Git up and dust, so neat and sly, 
Sure pop ! I'm always ready. 
Hey! g'lang, etc. 
VTR JOLLY JOCKEY BOY.— Concluded. 
My rig's the nobbiest on the track, 
The gamest nags I 
drive ; 
The boys they call, Jockey Jack, 
That's so sure's I'm alive; 
Now if you've anything to say, 
For biz or on the sly, 
Why, call on me, most any day, 
For to please I 
always try. 
Hey glatif,T„ etc. 
I AM CALLED A FAST YOUNG MAN. 
Written for and sung with great success by JEPPE. 
MY 
name if I 
should tell you none of you would know, 
But where I 
am acquainted they call me quite a 
beau; 
The pretty girls all like me, my figure close they scan, 
But all the mammas shake their heads and call me a 
fast young 
man. 
But if I'm fast I'll tell .' ou it's not my fault l'm so, 
The ladies are so rapid wherever one may go, 
Unless we wish to lose them, and that will break my hea, 
We have to go like lightning, or fly like Cupid's dart. 
CHORUS. 
Then do not judge me harshly, for I'm full of faults I 
know, 
But ' tis the charming ones that's belp'd to make me so ; 
They go it all a 
tandem, and never stop to rest, 
The fellow that's the fastest they are sure to like the best. 
I 
sport the latest fashions, I 
wear the newest coat., 
I 
sometimes ape the monkey, and look just like a 
goat; 
I 
drive the fastest. horses, and often have a 
smash, 
But then I 
please the ladies and don't care for the cash; 
But when I 
get quite hard up, and cannot raise the stamps, 
My stern paternal parent my youthful ardor damps; 
He says that I 
shall ruin him, my notes he cannot stand, 
That all his wealth I'll squander, I'm such a 
fast young man. 
But do, etc. 
I 
know I 
go it lively, my life it is a (lash, 
I'd spend a 
thousand fortunes if I 
could get the cash ; 
But as it is I 
surely am anything but slow, 
Though if more money I 
could get I 
still would faster go 
But listen when I 
tell you, though now I 
am so fast, 
I 
think the time is coming to settle down at last. , 
Some fair one I 
shall marry, lid lead a 
blissful life, 
if I 
can get the right one to be my little wife. 
But do, etc.

JEPPE'S MEDLEY. 
I'm sitting on the style, Mary. 
It was my wife's new bonnet, 
I 
didn't know till she pulled my hair, 
That I 
was sitting on it. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, 
And that ain't long ago, 
I'd sell my book and pawn my hat, 
My stomach grumbled so. 
Near the lake where drooped the willow 
I 
met old Granger's bull ; 
For many a 
day ' twas agony 
To sit down at school. 
Oh, mother, have you quite forgot 
The time I 
stole the pies, 
And how you thrashed tue that same eve; 
For tellin7 to you lies. 
Oft in the stilly ni7ht, 
Ere slumber's chain bath bound me, 
I 
seem to feel Pop Townsend's boot. 
Playing rub a

THE GOVERNOR PAYS THE BILLS. 
Written by Fn 
ED FosTrs, and Sung by JEPPH. 
THERE is not a 
happier fellow about, 
Than the fellow that you see; 
There is not a 
swell that can turn himself out 
In a 
style to compare with me. 
I 
laugh all the thy and I 
dance all the night 
And go wherever I 
will ; 
My debts I 
despise them, I 
know it's all right, 
For the governor pays the bill. 
CHORUS. 
I 
laugh at all care, and I 
never despair, 
My life with pleasure I 
fill; 
And every debt is sure to be met, 
The governor pays the bill. 
The fashion I 
now lead in everything new, 
From my boots to the shape of my hat; 
And as to my rivals, I 
have not a 
few 
Who try to excel me in that; 
But there is not one in my presence can shine, 
I 
pity their sad want of skill ; 
Of course the advantage is sure to be mine, 
For the governor pays the bill. 
I 
laugh, etc. 
The reason of this is accounted for thus: 
I'm the only son of my dad, 
And never indeed has he made any fuss 
In meetinff the bills of his lad. 
He thinks it far best I 
should sow my wild oats 
On the field Fin destined to till ; 
And while I 
see life, he secretly dotes 
On the lad who submits his bill. 
I 
laugh, etc.

When he bade me good-bye tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took ivery chit. 
What to do I

" 
HANNAH, HOW'S YOUR MA ?" 
Sung by JEPPE. 
calm to town the other day to have some fun and joy, 
For I'm my mother's precious hope, and father's only boy; 
I 
called to see my cousin fair, as I'd been told by " pa," 
The first words that I 
uttered were, " Oh, Hannah, how's your 
ma 1" 
CHORUS. 
" 
How's your sister, Hannah 1 How's your darling pa 1 
And how's your brother, Charley 1 Oh, Hannah, how's your 
in 'F' 
Sweet Hannah smiled when I 
thus spoke, her cheeks turned rosy 
red, 
To kiss them once was what I 
wished, but a 
slapping I 
did 
dread; 
I 
looked at her sweet ruby lips and at her golden hair, 
To ask for one I 
could only say, " Hannah, how's your ma 1" 
"How's your sister," etc. 
" 
My ma is well," sweet Hannah said; " I 
hope yours is the 
same." 
" 
Quite. well, I 
thank you," I 
then cried, " but our brindle cat 
is lame; 
Old Grimes is dead, that good old man, but of that you've heard 
before, 
And what good times we used to have slipping up his cellar 
door. 
" 
How's your sister," etc. 
"

We've lots of home-made sausages and heaps of buckwheat

UP THE GLEN AT WATKINS. 
As sung by JEPPE with great success. 
UP 
the glen at Watkins I 
strolled one lovely day, 
My mind was filled with wonder that took my breath away ; 
At first I 
did not see a 
young and smiling gent, 
Whose air was bold and free, and look was quite intent; 
At last I 
heard a 
sigh, and casting up my eye, 
I 
met his smile so sweet, it made my poor heart beat; 
I 
was so young and tender, only thirty-one. 
Oh! spare my blushes, must I 
say my band was all my own. 
et:tours. 
Ab ! up the glen at Watkins I 
met that lovely day, 
The cruel, cruel man that stole my heart away ; 
I 
was so shy and gentle, and only thirty-one, 
And yet I 
found my trials surely had begun. 
He looked at me so sweetly, as I 
have said before, 
I 
felt that I 
could love him then and ever more; 
His form it was so graceful, his eye it was so keen, 
He had such darling whiskers, and such a 
noble mein ; 
And then he'd such a 
bow ; I 
turned my bead away, 
I 
don't know hardly how, and could not really say ; 
I 
was in such a 
state with maiden bashfulness, 
I'd met a 
man, and fell in love and was so full of bliss. 
Ah ! up the glen, etc. 
And now I 
looked again where he so nobly stood, 
His hat was in his hand, a 
graceful attitude, 
And now I 
thought I'd hear the voice I 
knew was sweet, 
And bent my modest gaze his sparkling eyes to meet ; 
But just when his sweet lips were opening with a 
word, 
A 
loud terrific noise we just behind us heard— 
A 
crowd of ruffian men were coming towards us fast, 
And one cried, "'Woa, my prison bird, I've got you safe at last." 
CHORUS. 
'Twas up the glen at Watkins, that bright mid-summer day, 
I 
saw them take my love, and carry him away; 
I 
don't believe him guilty of any awful crime, 
I 
know that 1.e'd have asked me for this hand of mine:

DON'T PUT YOUR FOOT.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
The poor laboring man, who tries all he can, 
To battle his way through life's throng ; 
Oft finds, to his cost, that cold winter's frost 
Impedes much his getting along. 
The working men thrive in the industrial hive, 
Something to put by from their trade; 
Commercial depression brings stern retrogression, 
And swallows the little they've made.— Cho. 
How many good men have again and again 
Given way 'neath the world's heavy cares, 
For want of a 
start from a 
generous heart, 
Whose fortune's been brighter than theirs. 
And time after time we hear of some crime 
Induced by sad poverty keen, 
That might have been stayed, had an effort been made 
Before he'd such misery seen.— Cho. 
Misfortune's„cold shade, visits every glade, 
The rich man as well as the poor; 
Then hesitate not while wealth you have got, 
To help whom you can from your store. 
Ere long it may be fate's cruel decree 
Your hope's fairest prospects to smother, 
You'll surely find then kind, good-hearted men, 
To help you as you've helped some other.— Cho.

UM SUCH A WINNING MAN 
As Sung by Miss BLANCHE CHAPMAN. 
When I 
go on the street to walk, 
I 
look so fine and gay. 
The people stop to look at me, 
I've such a 
winning way, 
I'm not the one to hesitate, 
But please the best I 
can. 
And all the ladies take to me, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me, 
I'll bet a 
double span, 
That all the pretty girls will say, 
He's just the winning man. 
I 
get myself up free of charge, 
.For any ball or show, 
And then I 
call on all the b'hoye, 
To tell them I 
shall go, 
Then each one tries to buy me off, 
And I 
get all I 
can, 
Or else I 
go and cut them out, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me. 
And beat me if you can, 
I 
know the ladies here will say, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
A young chap once came up to me, 
Says he, " Id like to know, 
flow you charm all the pretty girls, 
And make them like you so." 
Says I. " Young man, go ask your ma., 
Or else your sister Fan, 
And they will tell you why, ' Because—. 
He's such a 
winning man.' " 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me, 
And beat me if you can. 
Every body's sister smiles 
On such a 
winning man. 
ACT ON THE SQUARE, BOYS. 
By ALFRED LEE. 
Author of " Champagne Charlie." 
[The mimic of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt's Half Dime Series of Choice Music. 
For sale 
by R. M. Be Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price five cents.) 
Through being fond of acting right, 
Straightforward, just and fair 
I 
try to make my troables ugh 
And little do I 
care; 
As happy as a 
king I 
live 
On just what I 
can spare, 
And from experience I 
give 
This hint, act on the square. 
CI1011178. 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square; 
Upright and fair, boys, act on the square; 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square, 
Upright and fair, boys, act on the square. 
Now in the street a 
thing so bad, 
Which often is the case, 
A 
swellish, foolish looking lad 
Some modest gir: will chase; 
Then, square you round, and let him see 
If he annoyance dare, 
you'll give him striking proof to show 
Now to act on the square. 
Act on the square, boys- &e. 
When out one night with noisy swells, 
Th' Haymarket kept alive, 
One Sergeant X with oyster shells 
To pelt they did contrive; 
They nearly got into disgrace, 
But squaring served them there, 
And brightly shone the Bobby's face, 
Who liked to see things square. 
Act on the square, boys, & C. 
I 
never liked a 
round game, nay, 
Round tables can't a-bear; 
And in a 
circus I 
can't stay, 
So I 
live in a 
square, 
Now brothers all, and masons too, 
Of good lets do our share, 
And when a 
chance presents itself 
We must act on the square. 
Act on the square, boys. & c.

SEE THAT MAN WITH THE HORRIBLE NOSE 
Sung by Sot Smixn RUSSELL and JEPPE. 
SEE that man with the horrible nose, 
Is something I 
always shall hear; 
Don't you see him? why younder he goes, 
Is constantly boring my ear. 
What a 
norrable nose, a 
norrable nose, 
Oh, see that man with the ' orible nose. 
Whene'er to a 
party I 
go, 
My nose is a 
wonder they say; 
And whenever that organ blows, 
All around me cry out in dismay, 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
One day down to Barnum's I 
went, 
When I 
thought to the giants I'd go; 
But my nose they all gazed at intent, 
For they thought I 
belonged to the show. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
One day on a 
lady I 
called, 
Her acquaintance to make " by the by ;" 
While at bowing and scraping I 
toiled, 
My nose took her square in the eye. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
I 
once knew a 
damsel I 
loved, 
Whose sympathy healed all my woes ; 
To kiss her good once I 
tried, 
And knocked in her teeth with my nose. 
What a 
norrable nose. etc. 
I 
once thought the Good Templars I'd join, 
All spiritous drinks to oppose; 
But I 
found they had by-laws so strong, 
That they scoffed at the look of my nose. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
Now married I 
never shall be, 
My advances the girls all oppose; 
The trouble you can plainly see, 
Why it's all on account of my nose. 
What a 
norrable nose, etc. 
SOME plebeian swells you read about, 
Who ape the high born when they're out, 
At flower- show, levee or rout, 
They hang on Fashion's brink ; 
These men of brass, how soon, alas! 
Their arrogance will sink 
Before the proud and haughty don 
Surnamed, Perfection Pink. 
CHORCS. 
Perfection, perfection, 
They say I 
am perfection, 
In manner and connection, 
By Jove! I 
am—perfection. 
To join the army it is grand, 
And meet the flower of the land, 
To squeeze fair ladies by the Land, 
And to their bright eyes drink; 
When on parade or oft' at mess, 
Such duties I 
ne'er shrink ; 
And to teach the fellahs how to dress, 
Fin thought Perfection's pink. 
Perfection, perfection, etc. 
In all the sports I'm awfully fine, 
At croquet and billiards both I 
shine; 
I 
well please in a 
pantomime, 
By Jove: to see me wink. 
I'm sure, dear girls, I 
am not vain, 
Now don't you really think 
For manners and accomplishments 
I 
am Perfection's pink ? 
Perfection, perfection, etc.

with great success by JEPPE, the Parlor Comique. 
FROM dear old Killarney I've come all alone, 
To find out my sweetheart, that left me, och hone 
A 
broth of a 
girl she was, as you might see, 
But a 
rale sharp young divil, ' twixt you and me; 
An illigant gintlema,n stood in her eye, 
That crossed the big sea, for I 
don't know why, 
Be gorra, unless for to sthale her away 
From mesilf that's her man for this many a 
day ; 
She's Biddy O'Flaherty, right from the bogs 
Of the Emerald Isle, with hersilf and her togs ; 
I'm Terrence Muldoon, so the priest sure may say, 
An' faith, her I'm huntin' this many a 
day. 
I'm wretched I 
am by mesilf all alone, 
From me country and friends I 
have left, och hone I 
For Biddy I've saunthered the country around, 
And still I 
kape goin' though niver she's found; 
I 
think of the shanty, the pigs, and the cow, 
The buttermilk fresh and the hay on the mow; 
The nate little shtrame, wid the ducks and the geese, 
D'ye mind now these things will disturb share her peace. 
Och ! Biddy, my darlint, 1'11 find where yees shtay, 
It's mesilrll kape looking be night and be day ; 
I'm longite to find yees, and whin very soon, 
Be jabers I'd make ye sweet Mistress Muldoon.

PITY GIMLET. 
HAIR-PIN SONG. 
Composed for JEPPE by H. Atro. POND. 
SLINRETY Gimlet is always my name, 
If you don't like it, why that's all the same; 
I 
live on air when I 
don't swallow flies, 
And go bobbin' round, quite often endwise. 
Whickety, whackety, fiipperty flop, 
I'm always a- going when I 
don't stop. 
I 
squirm through a 
knot-hole, squeeze through a 
crack, 
Bottomways, endwise or flat on my back; 
Chuck up my dickey, tight under my ears, 
Legs, arms, and body, in close fitting gear. 
Ripperty, snipperty, loppity, whip, 
Ever a-buzzin when I 
don't slip. 
In at the window or out at the door, 
Under the ceiling or over the floor, 
Eyes both asquint, and with my big long nose, 
Where I 
go, when I 
go, nobody knows. 
Higgerty, phr.Y,gerty, skipperty jump, 
When I 
stand still, I 
look like a 
long pump.

THE BARBER. 
Written for JERRE by CHARLIE 
A 
BARBER loved a 
girl named Maria, 
She left a 
pain here at his side, 
She was all that mortal could desire; 
She vowed that she would be his bride, 
From him she never would be parted ; 
Oh, how her words he had believed 
Now racks his brain ; the cruel torment ! 
For cruelly, ah, cruelly he's been deceived. 
CHORDS. 
She has jilted the barber, the barber, the barber, 
She has jilted the barber—he feels his brain on fire; 
She has jilted the barber, the barber, the barber,— 
Mad is the barber, yes, mad is the barber, 
And through his false Maria. 
The first time she came into his shop, 
Ah, me ! he felt so strange and queer, 
IIer eyes they nearly made him drop, 
Her hair it hung right down here ; 
He dressed it, and from that moment 
Wounded he was by Cupid's dart. 
What he cut off he dearly cherished, 
He wears it, yes, he wears it near his heart. 
SDoKEN.—There it is (
takes a 
switch of hair from unler his 
coat.) 
She has jilted the barber, etc. 
He never made the slightest charge, 
So the fair one often came; 
With love he felt his heart grow large, 
lie told his love, but not in vain ; 
She named the day, oh, blissful moment, 
With joy he could have danced a 
fling; 
Now racks his heart, the wicked varmint, 
To find she is a 
false, deceitful thing. 
She has jilted the barber, etc.

THE STYLE IN WHICH IT'S DONE. 
As Sung by BILLY Corrox. 
1 
stand before you once again, 
A few words just to say; 
The subject of my song I'm sure, 
We each meet every day. 
Some men live fast and others slow, 
As through the world we run; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be " brought to book; 
While another man across a 
hedge 
Is not allowed to look. 
This may seem contradictory, 
Indeed, to many a 
one ; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style Ill which it's done. 
The politician speechifies, 
And makes a 
great hurrah, 
Till another man, he mounts the stand, 
And points out every flaw. 
He gets the nomination, 
And for Congress lie does run ; 
Succeeds and laughs to think he knows 
The style in which it's done. 
Now has it ne'er occurred to you, 
How strange the mystery seems; 
That girls can dash along Broadway, 
Who scarce are in their teens? 
Their pas are poor, but still they dress. 
In a 
style that's number one, 
But I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
I 
think I'll conclude tny song. 
Perhaps you'll say ; 
it's time," 
But I 
hope that I 
have pleased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
Some may think it is too short 
And others it's too long : 
But very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A HUSBAND'S LAMENT. 
Sung by JEPPE, the Parlor Comique. 
On I 
the pain and tribulations 
That a 
married man endures, 
And the trials and vexations 
For which there are no cures ; 
It makes me sigh and almost cry 
When on such thoughts I 
dwell, 
For I've a 
wife who makes my life 
Far worse than I 
can tell, 
CLIORITS. 
She will scream and tear and pull my hair, 
And order me about; 
And if I 
squeal, or make appeal, 
She'll surely put me out. 
If I 
go out an evening 
And remain a 
little late, 
I 
know when I 
turn homeward 
She'll meet me at the gate; 
And then to me so very dear 
Are the kind words I 
hear, 
As she leads me by the nose, 
You're again off color, I 
suppose. 
She will scream, etc 
But ofttimes she changes 
And comes up with a 
smile, 
And sweetly asks " dear hubby " 
For " change," to keep up style; 
For well I 
know when she would go 
To buy a 
dress or shawl; 
For then she's mild, just like a 
child, 
And will never raise a 
squall. 
She will scream, etc.

BROTHER TO JINKS. 
Written for and sung by JEPPE. 
Pm brother to Jinks of the famous marines, 
But I, like the captain, don't live on my means, 
And instead of the army I've been through the fleet, 
As bold a 
young sailor as ever you'll meet; 
The ladies all take in me purest delight, 
For that very reason I 
keep them in sight; 
I 
am booked in all ships of the shore dry dock line, 
As the greatest repugnance I 
have for the brine. 
CHORUS. 
I'm brother to Jinks of the famous marines 
But I, like the captain, don't live on my means, 
Instead of the army I've been through the fleet, 
As bold a 
young sailor as ever you'll meet. 
I 
don't think my messmates in love with me fell, 
Though I 
ate all their dinners and treated them well; 
I 
was always so pleasant, how could they find fault 7 
But sometimes they would ask me now do you like salt'? 
A 
lack of good breeding this was you'll allow, 
And to be more polite I 
just made them a 
bow, 
Saying, gentlemen, filled with our dear captain's wine, 
And here's to the Commodore's daughter so fine. 
I'm brother to, etc. 
The Commodore's daughter was all that was gay, 
She often a 
stroll would take out on the quay, 
And one luckless morning she fell from the pier; 
My heart was quite frozen with dread and with fear; 
As fortune would have it I 
st44od on the dock, 
Bat I 
could not go further for fear of a 
shock, 
When a 
fellow rushed by me with bloothin his eye, 
And cried, " I 
will save her or with her I'll die." 
SPOKEN. — Ah, poor fellow; well, had I 
any objections 7 Cer-
tainly not. 
If I 
had prevented that young fellow from following 
the dictates of his enthusiastic and noble nature I should 
never for one moment conscientiously consider myself— 
I'm brother to, etc.

KING OF TRUMPS. 
As sung by JEPPE. 
Confound your doleful dumps; 
I'm known upon the town, boys, 
As the jovial king of trumps. 
I'm the favorite of all jolly dogs, 
They drag me out at night; 
For when they have got me with them 
Of course they know they're right. 
CHORD'S. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps! 
Whenever you're down in the dumps, 
Come with me for a 
jolly spree, 
For Pm the king of trumps. 
We drink seltzer water and bourbon, boys, 
And look in at the club; 
Join in a 
game of euchre or all- fours, 
Or cut in for a " rub ;" 
But when Trinity strikes ten, we pitch 
Pasteboard and bones away, 
For ten o'clock at night, boys, 
Is our favorite ( line of day. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps, etc. 
The theatres now are voted slow, 
A 
music hall's the thing ; 
We travel to the jolliest 
To hear the " comiques" sing. 
We go in for no end of " chain," 
No end of bright " moselle," 
And when the ballet is over, boys, 
We tumble out pell-mell. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps, etc. 
WHEN ALL WAS BRIGHT BELOW. 
Words by Miss 31. F. OSGOOD. 
Music by Lou DINSMORE. 
Mr life is hung with shadows, 
My heart hath known no morn ; 
Beneath the fading sun rays 
The joy of all hath gone. 
And darkness, and darkness gathers 
O'er these eyes of mine, 
Like falling dew- drops, like falling dew-drops 
Along, along a 
cloudy sky. 
The spring of thought returning 
With blossoms ever new, 
Shall make the fair lands smiling 
Their .joyous youth renew. 
Ah, can I, can I 
remember, 
When e'er that spring was mine ! 
Like flowers, sweet flowers, like sweet flowers budding, 
In a 
land of sunny clime. 
The night grows thicker, darker, 
But yet aloft I 
see 
The brightest star of all is left, 
And that may shine for me. 
And heaven, and heaven bless me, 
And bring the long ago 
Still nearer, nearer, as in the old time, 
When all was bright, was bright below. 
MUSIC OF HOME. 
Words by Miss M. P. Osg-ool. 
Music by Lou InNSMORE. 
LIGHT, light as the breezes of morning, 
Faithful as the brightness of day ; 
Far, far away over the sea, 
Still roam my thoughts, 0 land, to thee ! 
Still roam my thoughts, 0, dear home, to thee ! 
Far, far away— far, far away. 
Ever in the footsteps of mem'ry, 
Follow to the scenes of rapture— 
My heart is thine, 0, native home ! 
Thy joys in dreams will come will come— 
Thy joys in visions sweet will come. 
Longing for thee—dreaming of thee. 
Bright hours, oh speed thy flying, 
Rest not for the joys of to-day ; 
Sweet songs of old, ever more dear, 
Thy raptured strains again to hear, 
Thy raptured strains I 
long to hear. 
Music of home—sweet songs of home.

YACHTING IN THE BAY. 
Words by W3t. F. 
BA.CON. 
Music by Lot Dnismous. 
Sung with immense success by JEPPE. 
THERE'S many pleasures in this life, 
But none that can compare 
With the one I'm going to sing of, 
Perhaps you have been there. 
With pretty girls, and jolly boys, 
All full of fun, I 
say, 
It's splendid on a 
moonlight night, 
A-yachting in the bay. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yachting in the bay, my boys, 
Yes, yachting in the bay; 
There's nothing to enjoy so much 
As yachting in the bay. 
Here's Ella, Sue, and Hattie, too, 
A-coming down the wharf; 
And Ella's friend, and Hattie's ma 
Are here to see them off. 
Now all aboard! aye, steady there, 
Your big foot's in my way; 
Up goes the mainsail, and we're off, 
A-yachting in the bay. 
Oh, yachting, etc. 
And now the " Belle" begins to toss, 
Likewise the " yachters," too; 
And Sue and Hat they both exclaim, 
" 
Good Lord! what shall we do '1 
Oh, dear, I 
feel so awful sick !" 
We hear the land lubs say: 
" 
I 
wish I 
never had come down 
A-yachting in the bay." 
Oh, yachting, etc. 
" 
Oh, let's go home! 
Oh, please go home!" 
The girls in one voice said ; 
We want our dear mammas to put 
Us in our little bed." 
We soon in calmer water got, 
And then we felt quite gay; 
For we " spliced the mainthvce" coming back 
From yachting in the bay. 
Oh, yachting, etc.

LncE to meet with an honest man 
That you don't see every day, 
One of the kind you seldom find, 
No matter where you stray ; 
Though rich or poor he is just the same,

Yes, that's what I

Is one of the kind for me, 
Who takes the stand and shows his hand— 
Oh ! that's what I

When you can find me a 
man like that 
In all this world of scamps, 
I'll take his hand and tell you true 
lie's worth his weight in stamps; 
One who will go to the poor man's door 
With a 
heart's that glad and free, 
And give him a 
share from his own small store— 
Ah ! that's what I 
like to see. 
A 
man, etc. 
But, with all its gilded spires and domes, 
This world is but a 
ball, 
That rolls along in a 
selfish way, 
To crush the ones that fall; 
Yet now and then you'll find a 
man 
Who is just the style for me— 
One who will always lend a

And that's what I

WHO STOLE THE DONKEY? 
Kind friends, just listen to my song; 
Its a 
new one I've invented ; 
And when you've heard. how I 
was wronged, 
I'm sure ' twill be lamented. 
One fine day, I 
took a 
stroll, 
Full of pleasure, fun, and glee, 
With a 
new white hat upon my poll, 
When some boys did shout at me; 
CHORUS. 
Who stole the donkey ? who stole the donkey P 
Who stole the donkey ? those boys did say, 
WHO with a 
who, STOLE with a 
stole, 
With a 
who stole, THE with a 
who stole the 
DON with a 
don, with a 
who stole the don,, 
KEY with a 
key, who stole the donkey 
I 
turned around, feeling in a 
rage, 
But the boys they kept on shouting: 
If they had been upon a 
stage, 
You might have thought them spouting. 
But I 
found myself in such a 
mess, 
While being out on this spree, 
With my new white hat and evening areas, 
Those boys did shout at me: 
Who stole the donkey'I eoe. 
A 
policeman came up at the time, 
The noise to ascertain, then, 
He tried to quell the mob, you know, 
But his efforts were in vain, then; 
They began to smash him on the poll, 
And. seeing he was in for a 
spree, 
I 
ran and left it to himself, 
While the boys did shout at me : 
Who stole the donkey ?

CAPTAIN DE WELLINGTON BOOTS. L
CONCLUDED.J 
You itmy talk of the Bar or the Navy, 
My life beats the couple to smash, 
You can get a 
fine post in the Army, 
That is if you've got but the cash; 
My dad you must know was a " grocer," 
Who contrived to scrape up a 
good sum, 
Bought me a 
commission with " sugar," 
And afterwards left me a " plum." 
gPOKEN.—To enable me— 
To la de da with the ladies, 
For that is the style that suits 
The noble frame and glorious name 
Of Captain de Wellington Bocts. 
At Soirees and Balls I 
get feted, 
The darlings at me how they glance, 
And quarrel almost for the " Captain," 
Or implore I 
will join in the dance; 
But dancing for me's too much bother, 
I 
leave such hard work for the rest, 
I 
like billiards and so I 
do croquet, 
After all, tho' the thing I 
like best 
SPOKEN. — IS 
To In de da with the ladies, &a. 
I 
tell them fine tales about battles. 
Which the darlings are anxious to hear, 
But what the smell of powder is like, 
I 
have not the slightest idea; 
They think I've done glorious deeds, 
And have oft made the enemy fly, 
But I 
havn't as yet, and what's more, 
I 
have no intention to try. 
SroxE3r.—.Yot i,n the least, I 
prefer by far— 
To In de da with the ladies, Art:

fine Drag that's a

devil to go, 
Of an afternoon I

Words by FRANK Dr.MONT. 
Music by JAMES E. STEWART. 
THR roses and lilies now bloom in the dell, 
They smile in their beauty for Kathleen Machree - 
She trips to the glen that we both know so well, 
While I 
am so anxious her sweet face to see. 
0, could you but list to the sound of her voice, 
It fills me with joy, ' tis music to me ; 
When I 
ask if she loves me, her answer will be— 
A 
kiss from the lips of sweet Kathleen Machree. 
CHORUS. 
Kathleen Machree, sweet Kathleen Machree, 
No rose in the dell can compare, love, with thee; 
Kathleen Machree, sweet Kathleen .Machree, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree. 
Some maidens are sweeter and fairer to view, 
But none can compare with sweet Kathleen Machree, 
She wins with her smiles and her heart free from guile, 
While close by her side I 
am longing to be. 
0, she will be waiting to- night in the glen, 
With words that are fond and sweetest to me ; 
She's the dearest to me and the fairest of all, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree.

PET OF THE SERVANT GIRLS. 
Poetry by ROBERT MCKAY. 
I'm one of the force, you'll observe, 
My name cannot matter to you; 
My number is plain if ' twill serve, 
It's 36-9-42; 
My heat's on the west side of town, 
Where the upper ten most congregate, 
Up this way one minute, then down 
The other way, early and late. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, my duties are very arduous. 
In fact, I 
should 
throw up my position were it not for the dear servant girls, who 
do all in their power to make my lot pleasant. 
Why, it was 
only the other evening one sweet creature informed me that I 
was— 
CHORUS. 
The pet of the servant girls, 
With my light mustache and curls; 
When I'm on my beat they smile so sweet 
On the pet of the servant girls. 
Of course I 
make love to them all, 
And swear I'm a 
single man; 
Then promise some evening to call 
On Eliza, Matilda, or Ann ; 
They take it all in; but, dear me, 
Were my wife the arrangement to know, 
She'd fall to the game; then, you see, 
My nice little cake would be dough, 
SPOKEN.—Decidedly, it would never do to allow her to make 
the discovery that I 
was 
The pet of the servant girlv, etc. 
If the city would increase our pay, 
I'd marry the girls every one, 
And when off duty each day 
I'd have, oh, good gracious, such fun; 
But then of course that cannot be 
While the people in office keep churls, 
Who think very different from me, 
The pet of the servant girls. 
SPOKEN.—Never mind, brother cops. 
Wait till 
the women 
get the right to vote. 
Then we shall see who will control the 
affairs of the city. 
Who 7 
why, who but— 
The pet of the servant girls, etc.

A 
FELLAn stands before yon 
Who's " some" on style, you see, - 
A 
concentrated extract 
Of sweet gentility ; 
So much attention I 
receive, 
honah ' tis no sham, 
It almost overwhelms me, 
But I 
bear it like a 
lamb. 
CHORUS. 
I'm, you see, the nobby boy the ladies all adore; 
As I 
saunter up and down before some dry- goods store. 
They throw such killing looks at me, flirt handkerchiefs and fan, 
I 
never get excited though, lne., bear it like a 
lamb. 
I 
go to balls and soirees, too, 
Or some such high-toned crush; 
I 
just stand in the corner, 
And the ladies for me rush ; 
They all want me to favor them 
For just once with my hand, 
Of course it's dreadful trying, 
But I 
bear it like a 
lamb. 
I'm, you see, the nobby boy, etc. 
To pic-nics, too, I 
often go, 
Though all the games I 
shirk, 
For croquet's rather tiresome, 
And swinging girls is work ; 
But when the luncheon comes around, 
Why then's the time I 
cram, 
Though some may say I'm piggish, 
But I 
bear it like a 
lamb. 
I'm, you see, the nobby boy, etc. 
That I'm a 
perfect piece of patience 
You must all agree; 
No matter what my hardships are, 
They never worry me; 
Why, even when I 
meet a 
friend, 
And we both take a 
dram, 
If he insists on paying, 
Why, I 
bear it like a 
lamb. 
I'm, you see, the nobby boy, etc.

M Y 
heart is glad, I'll tell you why, if you will only listen, 
For I'm in love with a 
charming girl I 
met the other day ; 
Her eyes are blue, her heart is true, her hand with jewels glis-
ten, 
And she had on, when first we met, a 
dress of white " P. K." 
And it's oh, my she looks so gay, lovely, charming sweetness. 
CUM:CS. 
Talk about your gowns of silk, poplin or of satin, 
But I 
love best a 
charming dress of snowy white " P. K." 
I 
winked at her, she smiled at me, we joined in conversation, 
As with the throng, we strolled along the crowded gay 
Broadway ; 
And as I 
gazed, I 
thought her face the fairest in creation, 
And she herself the sweetest girl that ever wore " P. K." 
For it's oh, my! she looked so gay, lovely, charming sugar 
plum. 
Talk about, etc. 
We paused before a 
high church door, where wedding bells 
were ringing, 
I 
glanced at her, she blushed and smiled, and looked the other 
way; 
And then grown bold, my love I 
told, while voices sweet were 
sin
; 
She promised then to be my wife, the girl in white " P. K." 
So it's oh, my I 
she looked so gay, lovely, charming honey-
suckle.

But wery much depressin' 
When it soaks in through your coat.

My pores, you see, is portable, 
And every pore's a

Where port and sherry wapors meet, 
And has their bit of sport;

And muddled as can be.

And makes them pop the stores, 
But from me it takes the health away', 
'Cos I

There's one thing, I

And that keeps me a-goin';

I've always pecked my share, 
And always will till down my throat,

THE PIC-1NTIC PARTY. 
Words and Music by GEO. ANDERSON. 
Sung by JEPPE. 
MISTER JONES and Mrs. Jones declared one August day, 
- 
Before the' summer was entirely gone they'd have a 
holiday; 
They decided on a 
pic-nic in the woods just out of town, 
And asked all their relations, also young Mr, Brown. 
SpoKF.N.—Whoa, Fan! all aboard, ladies. 
Pa, my sponge 
cake isn't done yet. 
Never mind. dear ; bring it along and 
we'll finish it when we get there. 
For— 
CHORUS. 
What's more fun than a 
pic-me party, with the victuals on the 
ground? 
Bugs in the butter and ants in the milk and skeeters buzzing 
'round. 
They went in four big carriages, and when they reached the 
spot 
They found the ice had melted and the butter was piping hot ; 
The sugar, too, was missing, the spoons were left behind, 
And the handle of the ice-cream pitcher was all that they could 
find. 
SPOKEN.—We'll get out here, ladies. 
Oh, dear Mr. Brown, 
do come and kill this horrid spider. 
Aw, never mind, my dealt 
Miss Jones, it can't bite you; and after all— 
What s 
more, etc. 
Young Mr. Brown, the handsome man, on whom the ladies 
dote, 
Sat right down in the frying- pan and burnt his Sunday coat ; 
Big fat Jim, the booby, moved round like a 
live haystack, 
his foot kicked over the lemonade tub, and wet Miss Jones' 
back. 
SPOKEN.—Ladies, it's time to go home; James, remove the 
dog's nose from the dish of sardines. 
Never mind, papa, the 
dog's having a 
good time, don't bother him ; you know how it 
is yourself. 
What's more, etc. 
They broke the plates and spilt the milk and left it there to 
sour, 
Two lovers walked off in the woods and fooled around for an 
hour ; 
The horses all got frightened, and reared and plunged and 
kicked, 
And spilt one load out in a 
mud- bole. 
So ended this pic-nic. 
SPOKEN.—Whoa, Fan ! 
Whoa, whoa! 
Why, James, I 
do 
believe the horses are running away. 
All right, marm, well 
get borne all the sooner. 
Good gracious! there goes my 
bustle. 
What's more, etc.

I FELL IN LOVE WITH TWO. 
Sung by JEPPE with great success. 
ONE day when out a- walking I 
met two girls a- talking, 
They looked so sweet and wore such stylish clothes, 
What could I 
do but eye them, as slowly I 
passed by them; 
They made me think of a 
lily and a 
rose, 
For neither was the fairer, I 
really could not tell, 
Which one I'd rather marry if such good luck befell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I wish I'd never seen them, for I 
could not chose between 
them, 
And so I 
had to fall in love with two. 
I 
met them very often, at parties or out walking, 
And by-and-by good friends we got to be; 
I 
found each day new graces in their lovely smiling faces, 
And then ere long my heart they stole from me ; 
But which I 
loved I 
knew not; I 
really had no rest, 
When alone with one I 
fancied I 
loved the other best. 
Oh ! I 
wish I'd never seen them, etc. 
I 
was so long deciding, that fate, at last deriding, 
Saved me the task of making up my mind ; 
While I 
was hesitatina, the girls got tired of waiting, 
And shook me off and left me far behind; 
For when I 
called one evening the maid to me did say 
That morning they'd been married, packed up and gone away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
wish I'd never seen them, for I 
could not choose between 
them; 
It is no fun to fall in love with two. 
SPOKEN AFTER LAST VERSE.—And there I 
was left a 
disconso-
late lover, with my heart broke in two places. 
KATY MOLLOY ON THE JAUNTING CAR. 
By 
H. 
A. 
POND. 
As once I 
was going to market alone— 
That is, wid myself, and my horse, och hone! 
I 
heard a 
sweet voice singing loud and so clear, 
" 
Oh, Dennis, my darling, come back to me here !" 
I 
listened intent, to be sure what said she, 
My name being Dennis, of coorse she meant me! 
I 
pull'd up my collar, and rubb'd my ould pate, 
And what dye think jist ahead of me straight ? 
Faith the purtiest sight, at the turnpike bar 
There was Katy Molloy on the jaunting car. 
I 
poulther'd my beast wid a 
cudgel so nate, 
Till soon we came up to the big turnpike gate; 
'The top o' the mornin'," sez I, " Miss Molloy." 
" 
That same to yourself, now," says she, " Misther Foy." 
Her cheeks look'd like roses, and och, such an eye! 
"Shure I 
heard yourself sinain' now jist," sez I. 
" 
An' faith you said 
Dennis,' be jabers that's me, 
At your sarvice, sweet Katy, right here, you see." 
And the purtiest sight at the turnpike bar 
Sat young Katy Molloy on the jaunting car. 
" 
I'm not quite so shure, arrah now, Misther Foy, 
'Twas me you heard singing," sez Katy Molloy. 
" 
I'm never mistaken, och, darlint," sez I. 
" 
Bedad now, you'd not think my ears tell a 
lie ? 
'Twas Dennis' I 
heard ! an' shure Dennis' means me." 
" 
But there's more than one Dennis, of coorse," sez she. 
" 
D'ye think I'd be so ongintale, Misther Foy .?" 
An' she turned her swate eyes then, and look'd so coy. 
Faith, the purtiest siE/,ht at the turnpike bar 
Was fair Katy Molloy on the jaunting car. 
" 
Och, Katy !" sez I, " won't you be Mistress Foy 1" 
" 
Be off wid ye, mind now," sez she, 
Dennis Foy !" 
But when she said " Dennis," " Sweet Katy," sez I, 
And jump'd by her side in the twink of an eye. 
Its many a 
year now since that time o' life, 
When Katy consinted to be my dear wife, 
And sometimes she sings " Dennis, come back to me," 
To the young little Foys that sit on her knee; 
Ai she tells of the time at the turnpike bar, 
Whin her and I 
sat on the same jaunting car.

KISS AND LOVE AGALN. 
Poetry by W ILL H. Cox. 
You may sing of lovers sighing, 
And parting in a 
pet; 
They say they'll part forever, 
And each one will forget; 
But all this talk is nonsense, 
And only brings them pain; 
You'll find a 
cure for sadness 
To kiss and love again. 
CHORUS. 
Then what's the use of sighing I 
It only gives you pain; 
Don't dim your eyes with crying, 
But kiss and love again. 
It only brings you sorrow -1 
To part with angry words, 
For lovers should be happy, - 
Like merry mated birds ; 
'Tis like the summer sunshine, 
That follows gloomy rain, 
For lovers who have parted 
To kiss and love again. 
Then what's, etc. 
Though dearest friends meet trouble 
In every age and clime, 
It only makes it double 
To let it grow with time; 
Then think upon it kindly, 
'Twill drive away the pain ; 
Take back the hand in friendship, 
And kiss and love anain. 
Then what's, etc. 
sang by JErrn, the Parlor Comique. 
I'm going to tell of a 
nice young gal, 
A 
nice young gal as sweet as muscateel, 
Who'd a 
fair, fair skin, 
And her dada was in the city militia; 
I 
called to see her dad one day, 
Something important I'd to say; 
She said her dada was away, 
So I 
couldn't see her dada. 
CHORUS. 
Dad- dad, dad- dad, dad-did-da, 
Dad-did-a- dad, did-a-dad-da. 
When I 
saw sweet Rose I 
blushed to my nose, 
How oft I 
lacked the courage to propose; 
Not knowing what to say, I 
asked her to play 
A 
tune from some opera; 
I 
threw my arms around her waist, 
Those lovely lips I 
longed to taste; 
Said she, " You'd better retire in haste, 
Or I'll surely call dada." 
Dad-dad, etc. 
Says I, " My dear, your dad's not here ; 
Believe me, what I 
say, my darling, is sincere, 
I 
think you are divine, say you will be mine, 
Or I'll jump into the canal." 
her answer to me was so bland; 
Says she, " I'll give you to understand, 
You've got my heart, but for my hand 
You must go and ask dada." 
Dad-dad, etc. 
I 
called nest day for her dad's consent; 
He met me with much astonishment ; 
Says he, " I 
never knew that the girl h 
v • 41 you, 
You can have her." 
Says 1, " You're a 
brick ;" 
Now nothing can our wedded life annoy ; 
And oh, we've lately not a 
little boy, 
And I've named him after Pat Malloy, 
And I'm teaching him to say dada. 
Dad- dad, etc.

SOPHANISBA SNAPPS. 
I 
ONCE courted a 
girl like other chaps, 
Her name it was Sophia Snapps, 
She lived in a 
place called Grinlico, 
But I 
wish she'd been at Jericho. 
Ri too ral looral looral 
Ri ti looral I 
doo. 
She looked so neat, she dressed so sweet, 
And didn't she show her pretty feet; 
Her hair was red, her eyes were blue, 
And I 
imagined she loved me true. 
Ri too ral loortl, e•c. 
I 
courted her for near a 
year, 
When a 
rich old suitor did appear, 
He followed her every where about, 
One foot in the grave, the other with gout. 
Ri too ral looral, etc. 
But woman, she's as false as fair, 
Although I 
raved and tore my hair, 
She cut me dead for that old swell, . 
Wed him and went to Paris to dwell. 
Hi too mai looral, etc. 
LAST VERSE ELONGATED . 
Now as Sopbanisba can't be my wife, 
As sure as I'm alive I'll end my life. 
I've a 
child, so don't stare if you're told 
I've committed infanticide so bold, 
And married been beneath the mould. 
Though artfully I 
have been sold, 
She's spurned me, all for love of gold ; 
But when my ghost she does behold, 
If ghosts can talk, her won't I 
scold, 
And then her bed- post fast I'll bold, 
And cry " your small game's out Pna told.' 
With fright she'll ugly turn, and old, 
Then in a 
moment grow gray poll'd, 
And when out of bed she's rolled, 
She will in a 
moment turn quite cold 
Then her in my arms I 
will enfold 
And bear her away where—

SOPHANISBA SNAPPS.—Concluded. 
Little Jack Warner sat in the corner 
Eating his Christmas pie, 
He put in his thumb, 
And pulled out a 
plum, 
And said— 
High diddle diddle, 
The cat's in the fiddle, 
The cow jumped over the moon, 
The little dog laughed to see the sight, 
And I 
hope I've pleased you all to-night.
