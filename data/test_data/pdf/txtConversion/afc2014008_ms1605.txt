rchaeology (
semantically speaking )
 =  the study of ancient thin T
h,  the
 
study of antiquittes.
 It is restricted to the study of those things whhch
 
reflect human life or have significance to human beings.
 If the things e

thus, they are not rocks and not fossils animals (not geology, not

Ts archaeology a discipline in its own right, or is it a piece o
 eeth n
 
else?  It is usually found in other academic departments: history, enthrc-
nology,  languages and so on.  Normally in the U
.S. it is a sub-disci'1ine
 
this is not true, however, in the old world.
 
Is archaeology a science?  It is partly a science, partly one of the
 
ities and partly a social science.
 To take the latter question,  some
 
eople feel that anthropology should stress soci f
i and cultural anthr(

sical anthropologists or arcaeologists on its faculty till t recenti;:.
 
Archaeology is a discipline that uses the methods of nturel science to
 
study social science data for humanistic purposes.
 The e t

2) description and taxonomy (describing and d nn -.

Therefore the archaeologist must be able to thi''
 " 
sciences in order to be able to do archaeology.
 
The social science data refers to the fact that -r-

study ancient societies, and therefore the things that they seeks are
 
social science facts.
 The kind of facts accessible to the arc

it
 
are demography, ecology,  social organization  human interactions (not
 
rer so n
to_p
rsOn
 but group=to-group).
 The ultimate objective, however,
 
es not always show up in the work being done; some archaeologists reili
 
like pots better than people, but this has nothing to do with the ult-
te goal.
 The hope is that the technological factors will make some kf

 The reason that archaeology is done is because it en-

 He gave psychoanalysis up because he fo u'

 If archaeologists are oriented toward the rarticu

 It's very hard to study an area of large size, very difficiult
 
for the archaeologist to recognize what an ethnoloc!ist would call a
 
tribe.
 The focus of interest in archaeology tends to he on a community.
 
He site is any location that shows the activity of man in the nast.

 Tecent development
 
0  techniques in sampling have b
ieen become very imr,ortant.
 Now we
 
mout efficient samplina; there are many considerations in this line:
 
1)  Archaoelogical sites are iatterned,  since living activities
 
in any community are never random, even nrehistoric communities.
 In
 
'
-ractical terms random sampling is inefficient; what you wxkkxtV want i
s
 
to get certain information from certain areas  though random sampline
 
might be useful within a subdivision or my small section.
 But let the
 
aattern be your guide for the overall picture of the community.
 
2
)  The sample taken is usually 5 to i0  or less.
 Very rarely
 
does an archaeologist investigate a11 of a
 site, even 50%.
 The
 
archaeologist's obligation is to reconstruct an ancient community,  and
 
when he has enough information to be able to do this he wø * should c
niit.
 
The rule of thumb is to quit when you are only making a larger collection
 
rather than acquiring new information.  The usual detth of a dig is a
 
few feet,  though it can be 90 to 100 feet in such areas as the middle-
east.
 You dig until you come to a  sterile soil, which has no evidence
 
of human activity.
 
3)  The archaeologist has a peculiar obligation to his data which
 
has to do with the operation itself.
 You destroy your data when you dig.
 
If you do an incomplete job, you have ruined the site for anybody else.
 
This obliges the archaeologist to make as complete a record as possible
 
of what he digs; he should inviude everything whether he is especially
 
interested in that problem or not,  since nobody else can do it after him.
 
He cannot be selective about what he records
 An archaeological site is
 
like and ancient book of which there is only one copy,  and as you read
 
each page, you throw it away.
 
A study done at Berkeley indivates that five or six samples o
 
two or three pounds will give a correlation of 10 r1us or minus. whic'
 
accurate enough.
 This was done in terms of digging a

assume.
 This exam' 1e was brought in to point out that the investigat
 
was only interested in tkit arriving at this formula; he still had to
 
x stop and record all the data he dug. enough though his own problem wn
 
different.

freshman work can be tremendously beneficial to the student as well
 
to the department.
 Archaeology is sometimes considered to be a fie
 
closed to women, because of the physical demands.
 These are someti......
 
heavy, but only rarely; the amount of actual dirt throwing is quite s "
 
compared to the record keeping and there are always a few large footba1
 
players who can do the heaviest part of the work.
 Remember the nronort
 
of laboratory time to field time is 10 to 1
.
 Women do laboratory work
 
on the average better than men.
 Actually anybody can play.
 
Very often students don't realize what they are doing until afterwards.

he Archaeological Record of objects collected.
 
'
he first job of description is not too hard; more difficult is the inter-
retation in terms of function.  Methods of internreting data are numerous
 
.,
it  there are five important ways the archaeologist uses to decide what
 
thi
 e
' lect was for:
 
) Wear: physical wear on the object.
 This works only on functional
 
tools
 not fetishes, or art objects etc.
 From the straitions on the
 
curfaces and the polish of the edges you can sometimes tell how things are
 
.ctually used.
 
2
) Ninety percent of archaeological internretation is based on
 
.
..
thnographic analogy; this is really the key to archaeological internreta-
'
ton.
 This tends, however, to be implicit rather than explicit; however,
 
:
hen you trace an interpretation back to its argtx ori in, you generally
 
r
ind the interpreter has been thinking in terms of ana logy.
 Items or
 
iymbols, for example, may be mentioned in folk tales or legends, and this
 
nowledge may be helpful.
 Ethnographic analogy is important for discovering
 
.
 :
unction but even more important for non-functional items which are the
 
L
 hardest by far to figure out.
 In early California a number of items were
 
-
 discovered,  five or 6 inches tall and mde out of abalone shells; they

refer to a "big head dancer" who wears a fancy head dress; (
actually,  there
 
•re still big head dancers anpearing at certain Calf fornia Indian ceremoric )
 
l
'here is then a very high probability that these ornaments represented
 
the big head dancer or the cod that the dancer represents.
 Therefore th s
 
i
s likely a religious item 'besides, it was found niaced in graves.)
 
.
e know something if we know th se items relate to religion rather than to
 
secular ornament or to banjos.
 This is a fairly recently made item, so
 
the analogy is probably pretty accurate.  Another example are the plumict
 
shaped stones, some of them almost 5
,000 years old -
-
 some of our oldest
 
relics.
 They occur in many forms.
 The reason we know what they are is
 
1ecause we have a number of sources which refer to these objects as no
—
 
objects.
 They are believed to be animate,  they aid the individual who
 
owns them, they can move and fly through the air, they represent the pow''
 
the Indian wishes to call on.
 In 1947 an archaeologist found an old mdi
 
shaman who had several of these things who was using them to control the
 
:
eather and so on.  Aoparontly the
 5
,000 year old stones w had the
 
"
-
'me kind of significance as the ones in use now do; they function in the
 
'
rea of self-realization.
 It is esnecially i
r
imortant in the area of re-
ligion to have some kind of approach to the battiev belief system; and th
 
ood archaeologist is up on his ethnogranhy.
 This also explains why
 
-
'rchaeologists are happy in an anthropology derartment -
-
 the cultural
 
-i
thronologist and the archaeologist can cross-feed each other.  (
In th
 
Td World, archaeologiststs tend to come from departments of ancient h tsr'
 
classic literature; this works well because of the kinds of sites .
sr
 
re-history they have to deal with.
 In the new world,  the problems are
 
ifferent

 in terms of field work -
-
 and archaeologists tend to c

 Context: association of the objects together may heli, interpret
 
object is for.
 This is site information.
 
) Imitative experiment. 
This consists in using a tool or its
 
c  to see if the thin  could have performed the act or not.
 Obviously
 
this only works with ?unctional tools; the probability is that this tee
-
•ique will tell you that it could work but it will not tell you if it  i
 
york.
 It is mostly helpful in  E  clearing the ground -
-
 the elimination
 
some theories.
 Further, it is important in judging the functional super-
erity of one tool over another -
-
 this is a subject about which we are in-
e
l
.ined to over-generalize.
 We tend to take it for granted that history
 
one of continual progress, and that each device is functionally sunerior
 
to the one before it.
 But this is not necessarily true.  Meighan says
 
t
hinks that stone arrowheads are functionally better than copper/bron7
 
rrowheads; maybe, however, the cooper/bronze were more important for
 
ccl reasons or aesthetically.

 The appearance of plows and so forth is an indivation of advc cz

," 
hing that archaeologists know, that is: you cannot alter culture ov
 
tght but you can alter it in almost any direction you want it to
 
ou do it slowly.
 Cultures have a tremendous inertia; it is worki
 
so it is difficult to move it.
 If you want to change a cultu'-

cord, a culture is more like its nredecessor than anything elsc

 Some of the leading exnonents of new archaeology are Jim
 
(UCLA), L

 the young aggre
 
idea men in archaeology today, and they have made some creative cort ''
 
tions in terms of methods but mostly in terms of nurpose. Richard
 r
 
Deetz, for instance, correlated nottery design of the Plains India:-
and found that the pattern shifted and disintegrated in a correlat 4 
with a shift and disintegration of family structure.
 The Plains I
:
 
were once matrilineal but shifted to natril t
heal after Euror,ean co:i.
' -,
 
Then the women of a family group were drawn in from the outside thc
 
family (married in), and they no longer had a unilateral nattern o

Ultimately, the refined techni ues being developed by archaeolog
r
Dy to,
 
,
 
will be develo',
 ed to the point of real accuracy.
 Right now.  then,  it
 
doesn't really matters whether the answers are right; nart of the im-
nortance is the kind of questions the anthro' ologists and archaeolo i
 
are asking now.
 For examnie,  they are working on the nroblem of what
 
is a decline -
-
 a very tough c
7uestion.
 Real civilizations for examn
 
have noor and uninteresting nottery (

Egynt) because by the t
i
 
you get a civilization you get almost a factory tyne of nroduction;
 
they're cranking them out.
 The highest quality of nottery is at th

 The statement that a weaponless bipedal could not have w r s1 r-

sDecialized defensive equipment.
 Greenway pointed out the Koala br be-'r
 
who has everything against him but is somehow surviving.

For small schools where you have the problem of students not ±

southern states, etc.):
 the LIFE Nature
 
series on evolution; photographs are excellent and text accurate.
 
For schools with students sufficiently sophisticated to realize that

ay and Brace's book is okay.
 
Further recommends William Howells: MANKIND IN THE MAKING -

Miscellaneous announcements.
 
Anthropology is not ax science; with some it is an art and with others a
 
craft. Greenway's approach is that of cultural determinism (Leslie White
 
also).
 
Anthropology is actually the study of certain things that were the interests
 
of charismatic figures in the field.  Anthropology in ExXtJ
: =d England
 
means physical anthropology; in this country, it is a kind of dustbin.
 
For example we study social organization, but social disorganization has
 
been left to the sociologists.
 
I
f any principles or processes are valid at all they are valid for all of
 
the culture; they may be vestigial but they are there.  He warns against
 
"the suspect singleton" -
-
 the s
ingle example that turns up.

CULTURE
 
Definitions of culture should not say arbitrarily that cult ure is exclu-
sive to man; we haven't sufficient evidence to say this for sure and it
 
tends to arbitrarily limit the possibilities in thinking about it.
 
One problem therefore in arriving at a detinition of culture is that man
 
has been slowly driven from bastion to bastion in his attempt to feel that
 
he is special and favored by God; all that he has left to hang his special-
ness on are nis non-sense (in the linguistic sense  as non-tangible or
 
non-sensible) elements such as faith and the excuticive idea of culture
 
as an exclusive possession.
 
To define means to draw lines around.
 The Biblical idea of species was
 
that they were immutable.
 Lirtneaus and others concerned with taxonomy
 
found that they couldn't define the species in the sense that they couldn;t
 
bound them off from each other.
 If you can't draw lines around them, you
 
have to assume that this is because they are chnnging.
 But the failure
 
of their definition led to the development of the theory of evolution.
 
This is happening to our definition of culture.
 Is culture t
,eculiar to
 
man?  To solve this problem we will have to Ston lookin  at man and start
 
looking at culture....

 First week (Thursday -
 June 2)nd)
 
Definition of culture:
 another fault in many defitions (besides confinin
 
it to man) is to construct it in terms of a list; this is inadequate be-
cause if you run across something not on your l
ist, what do you do with
 
it?
 
Culture is anything founded on the symbolic 'rocess:
 
A stands for B as opposed to A =  B
.
 
symbol
 sign
 
Animals and plants have a tropismatic reaction -
-
 a signal reaction
 
Pavlov's bell was food; it didn't stand for food.
 This is "nroved"
 
the dog's reaction who simply salivated as they would in the presence
 
food.
 Human beings operate on tro ism tic responses most of the time,
 
but occasionally according to the symbolic process.
 
A signal reaction is the inevitable reaction to the stimulus
 
A symbolic reacion is a resnonse based on "stands for"; therefore it
 
has greater variation.
 
Language is just a means of communication; it is a part of culture, not
 
culture itself.
 Greenway feels there is no qualitative difference between
 
language and any other part of culture -
-
 at least that the evidence is
 
not all in. It is one means of symb lic intercourse; there are others.
 
He mentioned "proxemics" -
-
 the study of distances between people.
 
Greenway thinks we obscure the nature of culture if we connect it too
 
closely with language.
 Language grows out of culture.
 
We must see culture as if it were a sentient being, omnipotent but not
 
omniscient.
 You can study culture only if you take man out of the equation.
 
(This is a direct quote from G
.  I believe quoting from his book.)
 
He also discussed several random things:
 
1
)
 "Non-literate".  Many people think if you have a word that is loaded
 
up with connotations, all you have to do is get rid of the word and you
 
will lose the connotations; this is what happened
 to "primitive".
 Green
-
.ay says the thing to do is use the word and gradually its connotation
 
ill change -
-
 "Quakers" for example.
 G
. feels not only is the substitution
 
f the word "non-literate" for "nrimitive" useless but it makes the un-
:
uistic situation stand for the l
o
7sawtax whole culture and its '
-,
eonle.
 
2)  When Greenway uses the term "primitive" he uses it in the sense of
 
a people who have not yet attained cereal agriculture.
 
3)  He quoted a poem by Robert Fro st on ants; very funny and worth
 
looking up.
 
4)  In reference to questions on "miraculous events" he quoted Thomas
 
Paine:
 "Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course
 
than that a man should tell a lie?"
 
5
)  He also stated:t
tx "
I think the aor ose study is a biq boondor le."

he anti-nomianisrn refutation couldnever be met by Calvinist supporters.
 
(Antinomianism says that if your future is ordained before birth why
 
bother to do good when doing bad is so much more fun and doing good won't
 
help.)
 
Panchreston is another argument ag:ünst cultur-
il determinism; it  l
iter ll'
.
'
 
means "explain-all".
 The objection meant here is that cultural deter-
minism does not offer any means within its nhilosonhy to reject it; it
 
explains itself.
 
A third objection i
s thnt formulated as "Cultures don't naint f
in ernails;
 
eople do".
 See refutation in Greenway chatter one.
 
Ta order to understand culture, man must be a constant.
 Culture m
ove
 
like a leister -
-
 a many-pronged fish spear.
 The man on the outside
 
end of the prong which is t ex ±x x pointed in the direction that the
 
culture is going anyway is a "great man" and "ahead of his time".
 
onnoses strongly the great man theory.  Man is an instrument of cul-
ture.

 (Eskimos were cited a

.
hen people are trying to defend man a
 
often fall back on the great man theor':
 
Jhite defines a great man as:  A biological organism in which a signi ican
 
cultural event has taken plac e .
 
The question is are there such things as independent inventions or are
 
they polygenetic?  Ralph Linton in STUDY OF MAN says "A discovery is any-
tking addition to knowledge and an invention is any new application of
 
knowledge. He points out: a small child pulls a cat's tail and gets
 
scratched and that's a discovery; the child pulls the cat's tail when some-
one else is holding the cat and the other person gets scratched it's an
 
invention?
 
In all inventions or innovations the man who does it first is the sacri-
ficial pioneer and usually loses out both on his bankroll and the credit.
 
Alexander Fleming.
 The ancient Egyptians had knowledge of curative power
 
of fung; witches include fungi in the brew recipes.
 Florey and Chaim made
 
the final discovery (of Fleming's report) working on order from the British
 
govenrnrnent to find a cure for battlefield wounds.
 
White says a great man is just someone who happens to be at the right place
 
at the right time.
 If you're not on the right place in the cultural
 
line you're just another nut.
 
Nobel prizes are more and more frequently being shared between eeople who
 
happen to have discovered the same thing at the same time.  As a chess
 
writer says -
-
 the combinations are there, you just hive to see them.
 This
 
is a good description of the invention process.
 
Edison gets credit for the invention of the elctric light; it was first
 
invented in 1822 by a Briton who did n '
t bot her  to  natent it because he
 
said none of the processes were sufficiently unique for it to be natentable.
 
Edison didn't know enough, sought the patent and got it.
 
Oreenway found the sheet music to Irene Goodnight in an Australian library;
 
said Leadbelly was known as a great man because be wrote Irene Goodnight.
 
(song was copyright * 2 1895)
 
You get students attention much more actively if you ask them to brinz in
 
examples of processes from their own society.
 
(
roeber says the inventor is tha  the man who makes the invention economically
 
feasible.
 
Autoharp is basically a zither, invented by Charles
 .
 Zimmerman in 1880;
 
he remarked at the time "
It's the greatest accomplishment in the history
 
of mankind." (There is a film called "How to Play an Autoharp" which Green-
way recommends as a riot..)- public school tyne of thing.)  The autoh rn
 
has diffused; C. Saw one in Aistraija at about the normal  rice; turned out
 
to have been made in East Germany.
 
You can take anythinr  in n culture and observe a

in it.

in coal mines along with his reindeer horn '

 Coal has always been i
 
'
retty worthless substance (per square foot,  I presume); it is used ur

 Coal miners have basically been
 
s
laves ever since coal was first mined, and he had some horrendous statis-
tic about how many American miners lie buried in coal mines.
 In order to
 
try to make some profit, coal mining has been among the most inventive
 
of industries; many of the great inventions were made in or for the coil
 
mining industry.

roeber pointed out that, like fashion, armor is cyclical; it will come
 
in, become over-developed and drop out.
 C

 he thinks, about
 
to come in again in present day.
 The invention of the bill-hook pushed
 
armor out in the medieval period; a neasant could reach un and null a
 
knight off his
 r
x
xtx horse and a knight was almost helpless on t''
 
round.
  
Cross bows (much superior to the long bow) have been invented
 
again and again including back in ancient times.  R During the 11th c
 
tury in Europe the cross-bow was banned by general agreement because
 
was considered the ultimate weapon. Practically every important inven
 
ws first develoned for war.

 Second week (Monday. June 26,  1967)
 
1)  Paley's principle (Paley a 19th century clergyman):  A function of an
 
organism must be evaluated in terms of that organism.
 EG one lives in
 
a mosquito area and are annoyed by mosquitos.  so you ask "Why are there
 
mosquitos?"  A religionist might answer that God made them to try us
 
or a scientist might answer that they are there to eliminate other more
 
noxious creatures.
 These are all answers vfxtv in terms of man rather
 
than mosquitos.
 
2
)  Competitive Exclusion PrinciT-'
le:
 Comnetitors cannot co-exist.
 
And a corollary: the closer two com'aetitors are to each other,  the more
 
ferocious will be the competition.
 
4othE the above are contained a in a book recommended by Greenway:
 
Nature and Man's Fate by Garrett Hardin.
 Hardin further states that
 
mutations seem to be an inefficient way of making changes -
-
 a very
 
gross system.
 However, if there is an environmental change, the gross
 
effect of mutation may be necessary (in crder to be able to exploit t
1-
. .-
change or simply to stay alive?)  He comnares mutation with a race car
 
driver trying to adjust his carburetor by shooting shotgun t
,ellets at
 
it; one of the little nicks may be just what it needs but it's a wasteful
 
technique.
 
Rabbits were introduced into Australia by Eurooeans and, since there were
 
no natural enemies for them there they multiplied and almost took over
 
the country.  Many remedies were tried, but finally a solution was found:
 
myxomatosis was introduced killing almost all the rabbits, leaving those
 
few who were genetically immune to myxomatosis.
 These were eventually
 
able to get together and began to rip reproduce resulting in a population
 
of rabbits as large as *
 Australia had had before except that these
 
rabbits were immune to myxzx*i=wmztvsts myxomatosis.
 
He then digressed to say again beware of the suspect singleton.  Apparently
 
according to G the distinguishing difference
 
with one of Leaky's fossils is the existence of the sagittal crest.  He
 
a
lso says that the sagittal crest is a sign of a male, at least in go-
tllas.  Maybe this is a male of one of the earlier types of fossil
 
i
stralopithecine and not a separate type.
 In further comment on the
 
.
eaky's work he pointed that Olduvai Gorge has been the scene of the
 
most violent and extensive flooding in the east mixing up the strata;
 
therefore dating by stratum is highly questionable (and I gathet the
 
Leaky's have done this).  He also announced that Leakey hadn't found
 
any of the fossils himself; he was always asleen at the t
ime and it was
 
his wife or his son or somebody else.

 culture must be seen as an omninotent but not neces-

 Cultures do r
nake decisions. but sometimes

Cultural determinism is equivalent to anthromological Calvinism.
 Cal-

America is primatily notable for a synthesis of traits taken fo

 al,habet:  The Be Hebrew alphabet had no vowels; when the Gr

 These were transf err ed to th e vo

L

Design i
potifs:  Greenway says many of these invent themselves.
 As the
 
weaver plays around with the weaving process, certain of these designs in-
evitably emerge (stair-steps; Greek key; concentric diamonds etc.) and
 
get transferred as design elements to other artifacts su ch as rott ery.

When a culture trait is introduced, it will u rd cr '-'

 Th

oint is that the pattern lasted beyond the point where it was functionn f

ccessary or even perhaps appropriate.
 The evolution went from the hand '
 
o the design; it couldn't have gone the other way (and I believe he got

of wood but sometimes of stone, and it belongs to the one for whom it

 It is kept in a special hol ein the rocks which becomes an equiva
 
to a tabernacle.
 The marks on the t

juringa ritual reinforces the belief in the totemic ar
 
and his life turnings much as does the tracing of the stations of the c
