 She
 
taught me Latin and piano and medieval history and lots of
 
unusual things,  but she also taught me the day-to-day things.
 
She taught me how to sew,  for example.
 I remember sitting with
 
her rag bag that contained scraps of material from all the
 
clothes mother had made for us and sort of folding doll clothes
 
out of them.
 
But then I had to learn how to do it  right.
 My mother was a
 
great believer in that.
 She gave me a Latin motto  (she gave all
 
us children different mottos).
 Mine was  "Faciendo ediscere
 
facere" which means  "By doing you learn to do"  and she would
 
tell me over and over,  "by reading you learn to read,"  "by
 
running you  learn to run,"  "by sewing you learn to sew."
 So I
 
learned how to work her old foot treadle Singer sewing machine.

 So  I
 
learned how to work her old foot treadle Singer sewing machine.
 
She gave me the front page of the Dallas Morning News  and --
with the machine unthreaded -- I had to sew up and down the
 
great believer in that.
 She gave me a Latin motto  (she gave all
 
- 2 -
newsprint columns  and around the photographs until  I learned
 
just how to sew a straight  line and turn a neat corner.
 And
 
then I had to  learn how to embroider -
-
 because that's what all
 
little girls did in my part of the country -
-
 at  least,  little
 
Anglo girls  like me.
 
And then every November,  my mother and I would go to the
 
dime store and I would get to pick out the presents  I was going
 
to make for Christmas.
 In those days you could buy dresser
 
scarves or table napkins or bridge table covers or pillow cases
 
that had designs stencilled on them with blue dots.
 And
 
"embroidering" was to cover those blue dots with French knots
 
and lazy daisys and outline stitches  in different colors so it
 
would turn out to be a special present that you yourself had
 
made.
 
So after I had picked out the item I wanted to embroider for
 
my sister or my mother,  I would go to the embroidery thread
 
counter and pick out the colors.
 There was  always white
 
embroidery thread,  I remember,  and lots of pastels
 
- 3 -
-
-
 pale green,  pink,  lavender,  yellow,  blue and sometimes black
 
and sometimes  red.
 I agonized.
 One year I remember coming home
 
with red and black and green and pink and lavender and white,
 
and my sister said,  "Honey,  you don't want to use that red and
 
black;  they won't blend.
 You want it to blend and be pretty."
 
And I thought it might be pretty,  but I tried it and it wasn't.
 
It didn't blend -
-
 and I had to pick it all out  and start again.
 
Now when I remember what was in the ragbag -
-
 scraps from my
 
dresses and the shirts and blouses mother made for the others,
 
and her own dresses and aprons and good pieces from father's old
 
business shirts -
-
 those pieces of cloth weren't scarlet or
 
magenta or black.
 They were lavender and aquamarine and pale
 
blue,  and they were solid colors or small prints.
 I guess you
 
could say we were conservative.
 And every once in a while my
 
mother would load up the ragbag into the car and we would go to
 
see the quilt lady who  lived about two miles from us.
 This was
 
during the depression and everybody did what they knew how to do
 
to make a few cents,  and this  lady really knew how to make
 
quilts.
 Mother and she would look over all the scraps,  and she
 
would get out all her patterns from the newspapers,  and they
 
- 4
-
would decide which pattern would look best with the material we
 
had.
 The idea was,  you see,  not to have to buy material;  nobody
 
could afford that in those days.
 But this  lady could take all
 
our old bits  and pieces and make absolutely beautiful quilts out
 
of them.
 Mother always said she was  a real artist at her work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds turned out to be blendy. 
They
 
were made out of the clothes we wore and the colors we had
 
chosen and the aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat
 
corners,  straight  lines,  balanced curves,  precise workmanship,
 
unemphasized dividing lines,  subtle color gradations.
 It's
 
actually a wonderful system -
-
 around the world it has produced
 
some beautiful effects from 19th century Italian paintings to
 
British flower gardens to Chinese porcelain to east Texas quilts.
 
But,  although the quilt  lady,  as everybody I knew called
 
her,  was an artist,  it gradually became clear that I wasn't.
 
Sewing just didn't really interest me.
 I learned those things
 
that an east Texas  little girl needed to know but that was it.
 
I didn't become an artist.
 On the other hand those aesthetic
 
principles  I learned as a a child have never  left me.
 At home
 
- 5 -
at this moment there is a basket by my chair full of woven
 
squares  I' m putting together for a baby blanket -
-
 and I giggle
 
a bit sometimes when I look at them,  for with the world of color
 
and gaiety to choose from I picked out white and pale green and
 
the sweetest pale yellow to make those squares out of,  because I
 
thought they would just work up so pretty... 
Now this  is a very homely story,  and I hope that many of you
 
recognize it and can understand its understated power.
 But we
 
have not explored it all the way yet.
 Notice,  for example,  that
 
although my mother considered it essential for me to  learn the
 
principles of sewing,  she did not consider it necessary to show
 
me the rudiments of basketry or of pottery.
 What you do not
 
learn or experience marks you as distinctively as what you do.
 
I' m sorry to say that as a child I didn't know any Mexican or
 
Black or Indian children who were neighbors to me in east Texas,
 
but I can tell you that it is  likely they would have had
 
instruction in different aesthetic activities than I.
 A recent
 
research project in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South Carolina
 
where ancient African basketry tradition connected with rice
 
growing is  still alive and thriving indicates that every single
 
African American man,  woman and child past the lap baby stage in
 
- 6 -
that community can make a basket.  I can't.
 I don't really have
 
any idea how to start.
 Basket making was not part of the
 
tradition in which I was brought up.
 Some might say I was
 -
-
deprived.
 
And then consider the various color palettes that are in use
 
around the world.
 American Indians often emphasize clear
 
primary colors -
 blue,  red,  yellow -
 each of which represents a
 
different direction -
-
 east,  north,  south,  west,  up,  down;  they
 
point a way and make distinctions between elements  rather than
 
shading things together.
 Black quilters often emphasize
 
movement and energy with brilliant color-soaked contrasts that
 
almost vibrate to the eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur
 
yellow and lots of black to set it all off.
 The colorful visual
 
playfulness of many Mexican traditions depends on the use of
 
shocking pink and scarlet and peacock blues.
 The folk arts
 
coordinator for the state of Arizona told me a few years ago
 
that he had noticed many of the local pinata makers were
 
producing snow white and pale pink and blue pinatas;  he thought
 
this odd and enquired if a new fashion had developed.
 No,  he
 
was told,  the only Arizona wholesale paper company had decided
 
that they would just sell to the big department stores  in future
 
- 7 -
so they had cut back the colors  to those that  "most people"
 
(anglos)  like.
 I
' m happy to tell you that when I last enquired,
 
our coordinator had a small  room in his house full of  industrial
 
rolls of purple and orange and deep pink tissue paper where any
 
Tucson pinata maker could come and buy a few yards of his own
 
aesthetic selection.
 
So far I have been trying to demonstrate how folk arts
 
emerge from the aesthetic patterns expressive of particular folk
 
groups,  groups that define themselves
 
sharing the same ethnicity,  location,
 
religion or other common factor.
 Now
 
group is exposed to  (or you might say,
 
as themselves by virtue
 
occupation,  language,
 
every person in a folk
 
"learns")  the aesthetic
 
of
 
pattern and carries  it with him as a point of aesthetic
 
reference the rest of his or her  life.
 This  is why the current
 
emphasis on "multi-culturalism"  in the arts agenda,  as badly
 
defined and confusing as the discussion so often is,  is of such
 
vital importance.
 Every individual,  regardless of the aesthetic
 
system of her family or community,  needs to see that system
 
treated with respect and appreciation and genuine understanding,
 
8
 
not just  lip service.
 When this happens,  the individual can
 
allow himself to be open to other aesthetic experiences and
 
become gladdened by variety rather than frightened or angered.
 
Each new aesthetic exposure then serves to broaden and deepen
 
our personalities,  making us more wise,  more humane,  more subtle.
 
It is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie and
 
how potent they are.
 Some years ago I was attending a concert
 
that presented a sampling of the musicians scheduled to appear
 
at a large multi-ethnic festival  in Los Angeles.
 There were
 
scores of musical performances from all around the world;  kilted
 
Scots bagpipers marched down the central aisle,  African drummers
 
thundered from the stage,  mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted,  gospel choirs filled the enormous hall with
 
sonorities.
 I was in my element,  showing off (f 
I
 
rankly)  making
 
knowledgeable remarks to my companions,  thrilling to each
 
extraordinary set of sounds.
 The whole thing dragged on for
 
hours,  each performance more special than the last until almost
 
at the end three slightly bedraggled looking men carrying a
 
banjo,  a guitar and a string bass shambled out on the stage,
 
fussed around rather unprofessionally for a minute or two and
 
then struck up  "Red Wing."
 And my heart absolutely melted.
 The
 
- 9 -
most extraordinary sense of total well-being came over me,  I was
 
comforted,  I was secure,  I was home,  that was my song.
 And I
 
realized,  to my great embarrassment,  that if  I had seen a copy
 
of the program ahead of time,  Red Wing would have come down
 
towards the last of my list of favorites.
 I had moved so far
 
away from my roots I had forgotten where they lay.
 But my roots
 
hadn't forgotten;  there they were ready to  remind me who I am
 
and where I come from...
 
So that,  ultimately,  is what multi-culturalism is  about,
 
making sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back to
 
his own roots every once in a while for comfort and dignity and
 
presence and on the other hand gets a chance to  revel in the
 
glories of the inventiveness that other cultures have to share
 
with us.
 It's a nice system; we just have to keep on trying to
 
ensure that everybody gets their turn.
 And that the quality
 
stays high.
 
For  remember my quilt  lady as compared to me as  a child and
 
an adult.
 She was an artist,  I wasn't.
 And everybody around
 
knew that.
 If you had asked anybody in our county who was a
 
-
 10 -
 
good quilt maker,  every one would have mentioned this  lady's
 
name;  they could also have told you -
-
 depending on who you
 
asked -
-
 who was a good blues picker,  or who knew the whole of
 
"las posadas."
 Everybody in a folk group knows the traditional
 
art forms and has experienced their basic aesthetic principles
 
and internalized them,  but this does not
 
of that group is an artist.
 Artists are
 
community and must be cherished as such.
 
mean that every member
 
special members of any
 
It's the same in any art form from anywhere.
 
I once wrote
 
that  it probably takes 10,000  little girls  learning to play "Fur
 
Elise"  or the "Happy Farmer"  or whatever your first piano tune
 
was on the piano to produce one Dame Myra Hess  (or any other
 
piano virtuoso).
 Every individual artist regardless of art form
 
or origin emerges out of and depends upon a massive support
 
system consisting of elders who have conveyed the "rudiments"  at
 
an early age,  of teachers who recognize and polish budding
 
talent,  of other artists who compare and compete,  of promoters
 
who present and exhibit,  of audiences who applaud and buy,  of
 
critics who scold and praise.
 All of these are necessary to
 
support just one artist.
 But then -
 how can you distinguish
 
which is more important to a mountain--the top or the bottom,
 
the peak or the bedrock?
 
Actually,  the longer I work with folk arts,  the more it
 
seems to me the problems  in folk arts are exactly the same as
 
the problems  in all art forms whether you call them classical or
 
fine or popular or whatever.
 All artists have pretty much the
 
same needs.
 They need to be heard or seen or experienced,  they
 
need their work to get out into the world.
 They need audiences,
 
whether  large or small,  but they do need educated and
 
sophisticated audiences -
 that is,  audiences that understand the
 
rudiments of the particular art form and won't be expecting
 
excitement where serenity is the order of the art or blendy
 
colors where visual contrast is the desideratum.
 (I keep
 
remembering the Anglo county social workers  in the deep south
 
who used to give Black quilters color wheels in an attempt to
 
teach them how to make their quilts blendy instead of vibrant.
 
They didn't realize you could as well  look across the color
 
wheel for contrast as side by side for harmony.)
 
There are some other simple needs that all artists,  folk and
 
fine share--they need to have their work included in public
 
school curricula so that all children can be exposed to their
 
special aesthetic principles,  they need to have their property
 
and personal  rights protected from exploitation,  they need to be
 
-
 12 -
 
able to make a little money at their art form from time to
 
time.
 Finally they need to be criticized;  they need to have
 
their work held to high standards,  so  long as,  of course,  the
 
standards are the standards of that aesthetic system.
 For that
 
you need a
 
themselves
 
defend it.
 
corps of aficionados,  people who have steeped
 
in the particular aesthetic system,  who love it and
 
That is why the Folk Arts Program insists that folk
 
arts projects need both community and outside experts on the
 
particular art form;  our folk arts coordinators,  like your fine
 
Rita Moonsammy,  spend much of their time making sure that
 
qualified expertise is involved in every major folk arts
 
project.
 Just stop and think a moment -
-
 you wouldn't put on an
 
important exhibit of 20th century painting or a brand new
 
Shakespeare festival without having it put together by a trained
 
art curator on the one hand and a drama expert on the other.
 
It's just the same with folk arts.
 You and the folk artist
 
needs the help of somebody that has  really done large-scale
 
research into Viet Namese embroidery or Jewish cantorial vocal
 
style or whatever.
 
-
 13  -
 
By the way,  that built in ever present concern for quality,
 
for the refinement and elegance of traditional authentic styles,
 
techniques  and repertoires is a major characteristic of the folk
 
arts movement.
 I mention this because people often don't seem
 
to realize there are quality standards  in folk arts,  possibly
 
because they can't visualize a critic that isn't wearing a three
 
piece suit.
 But the toughest fiddle critics are other
 
fiddlers.
 It's quality first and participation second in the
 
folk arts.
 That seems kind of mean perhaps,  but that is the
 
true way it is.
 I can't tell you how many musicians have told
 
me their daddy threatened to whip them if he caught them
 
touching his guitar or dulcimer.
 It wasn't until the child had
 
snuck around and learned in spite of the difficulties put in his
 
way that he was accepted as
 zartist.
 
And this  is one of the distinguishing features between folk
 
arts and the community arts movement.
 A good community arts
 
program,  in my experience,  rejoices in what is there within a
 
particular population -
-
 or what is  ready to be developed.
 Its
 
primary goal,  however,  tends to be participation,  community
 
involvement.
 It tries to create a more joyful surround by
 
virtue of  involving as many people as possible in the making and
 
-
 14 -
 
receiving and distributing of art -
-
 all kinds of art:  folk,
 
popular and fine--setting up community theaters,  community
 
choruses,  community art galleries where openness is the order of
 
the day,  where everybody can come and try their hand.
 It's a
 
great idea and I support it to the fullest.
 My main concern
 
with the community arts movement is that too often they overlook
 
their resident folk artists,  their  local traditional arts.
 They
 
bring in too many people from outside.
 Please include the local
 
folk artists in  .
 
The same thoughts can apply to the so-called "ethnic art
 
movement.
 The term "ethnic"  tends,  these days,  to refer to
 
people who share not only the same language but the same history
 
and,  at some past time,  the same geographical area.
 They have a
 
solidity that only history can bestow.
 They are the kind of
 
people who--when they move to a different place such as the
 
United States--get referred to in a hyphenated sort of
 
way--African-Americans;  Polish-Americans;  Chinese-Americans.
 
The important thing to remember about such people is that they
 
were originally un-hyphenated:
 they were Africans,  they were
 
Poles,  they were Chinese.
 As such,  they had created a number of
 
different kinds of complex art forms:
 classic  (elite),  popular,
 
-
 15 -
 
and--more than likely--several forms of traditional  (or folk).
 
It is insulting to such people to confine them to only one art
 
form.
 
Should a group of Polish-Americans turn up in my office,  for
 
example,  seeking support for a major Polish-American cultural
 
festival,  I would tell them that they should include in their
 
planning all the range of Polish cultural creativity--they
 
should have Chopin concerts and Paderewski concerts and polka
 
band concerts  (preferably with dancing)  and concerts of the
 
mouth music of the Tatra mountains,  along with exhibits of paper
 
cuts as well as easel and memory painting,  etc.,  etc.
 
So the folk arts always exist as part of a larger surround.
 
Let me remind you once again--folk arts emerge from a group of
 
people who share something in common and they speak especially,
 
therefore,  of and to that particular group.
 This is their big
 
difference from the fine or popular arts that try to speak
 
across cultural boundaries to much larger audiences and whose
 
message is therefore often more dilute.
 Folk Arts,  being
 
learned informally and passed on from one group member to
 
another,  utilize a shared aesthetic style characteristic of
 
-
 16 -
 
the group.
 Think,  for instance of Hawaiian hulas,  African
 
American blues,  Pueblo pottery.
 Thre is nothing whatever to
 
prevent,  say,  an Alaskan Eskimo from learning to hula,  but it
 
will remain a Hawaiian hula that has been learned;  it is highly
 
unlikely to be considered an Eskimo hula.
 
For in the folk arts,  as  I again tried to demonstrate in my
 
original personal story,  there are various kinds of artists.
 
From the point of view of the folk group itself,  probably the
 
most culturally valuable are those who have been brought up
 
within the tradition,  learning the arts as they live the life
 
that the art itself stems from and represents.
 Such people are
 
sometimes called "tradition bearers" or "culture bearers."
 They
 
exist in other fields of art as well.
 I have always thought
 
that Nadia Boulanger must have been a tradition bearer in the
 
field of classical piano.
 
Then there are those folk artists who have been brought up
 
within a tradition and who determine that they will develop it
 
into new ways.
 They are the innovators,  the "new wavers."
 
Sometimes they bring it off and create a refreshing and exciting
 
new artistic style that becomes accepted by others and gets added
 
 
I
 
-
 17 -
 
into the cultural  repertoire.
 More often,  they don't,  and they
 
sink into a noble and honorable oblivion,  unheard of by future
 
generations.
 Again,  this same situation exists  in many other
 
art forms.

Finally,  there are practitioners who have not been brought
 
up in the tradition but who determine,  at some point in their
 
lives,  to  learn it.
 This is a natural human impulse--to admire
 
deeply,  to the point of commitment--somebody else's art form,
 
and it should never be denigrated.
 Such practices stretch the
 
aesthetic muscles and increase the humane and tender side of an
 
artist's character.
 The outside learner--the "revivalist"  the
 
"folky,"  the "interpreter" must,  however,  remember that the
 
oncoming phase,  the future development of the art form she has
 
adopted will invariably arise from the authentic artists--the
 
in-born,  in-bred culture carriers,  whether old-fashioned
 
conservatives or young radicals.
 The local Armenian oudist is
 
likely to )
stay working away at his music long after the
 
eclectic young outside learner is off trying his hand at
 
Bolivian pan pipes or Applachian hoedowns.
 
-
 18 -
 
So the Folk Arts Program in its national policies has
 
adopted a particular order of critical necessity in its funding
 
policies.
 First,  we decided,  we must try to support the
 
authentic old-time tradition bearers,  partly because nobody else
 
was but mostly because of their essential function.
 Second, we
 
would try (if there was any extra money)  to help the emerging
 
exploratory art forms that were growing out of traditional
 
cultures.
 Lastly--if there still was any extra money--we would
 
try to help the outside learners,  many of whom could indeed make
 
serious contributions to the preservation of the supported art
 
forms.
 And that's just what we've done on the whole.
 
And state programs across the nation have also adopted those
 
principles with a totally acceptable amount of  local variation.
 
In fact,  I urge state programs to develop their own guidelines
 
and principles appropriate to their particular situation,  and
 
many have.
 I personally believe it is our continued emphasis on
 
variation and local originality that has spurred the growth of
 
the current 50 state folk arts programs.
 The record of state
 
development is really extraordinary.
 Only the states of
 
Delaware,  New Hampshire,  Indiana,  West Virginia and North Dakota
 
are currently without programs along with the territories of the
 
-
 19 -
 
Virgin Islands,  Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern
 
Marianas.
 For those of you who might be interested in learning
 
more about developments in other states,  I recommend your taking
 
a look at our most recent survey.
 I can also offer you copies
 
of our guidelines and brochure should you need them and suggest
 
that--if you are concerned about particular areas of grant
 
activity--you can get in touch with my office for  lists of our
 
past grants  in such sub-divisions
 
arts of African Americans;  grants
 
grants to apprenticeship programs
 
as grants concerning the folk
 
concerned with media projects;
 
and the like.
 
For my final remarks must  inform you that the folk arts are
 
alive and well and living not just in Paris  (Texas)  or Middlesex
 
County,  New Jersey but all over the nation.
 Indeed they are in
 
many cases positively flourishing because for many many reasons,
 
people seem nation-wide to be looking with fresh respect and
 
appreciation to their local traditional art forms and
 
practices.
 I am delighted and honored to have been invited to
 
play a small role in the development of what I know will be
 
great plans for the support of the myriad folk arts that have
 
always decorated life in this Garden State.
 Such projects as
 
the Pine Barrer
s work initiated by the American Folklife
 
-
 20 -
 
Center at the Library of Congress and followed by your state
 
cultural agencies'  production of the Pinelands exhibits book,
 
the excellent series of films on the folklife of the New Jersey
 
waterways produced by the New Jersey Public Broadcasting
 
Authority,  the lovely book THE FOLKLORE AND FOLKLIFE OF NEW
 
JERSEY by your own David Steven Cohen and the folk artists in
 
schools projects coordinated first by Linda Buki have paved the
 
way.
 
Let us build on this good work and on the work of the
 
eminent folklorists who preceeded it--Horace Beck,  Herbert
 
Halpert among others.
 Let us consider ways  in which the many
 
folk traditional arts and artists of New Jersey can be located,
 
presented,  and c elebrated throughout the state.
 I
 
guess--frankly speaking--that is what I miss when I look around
 
me here--the sense of the ongoing consistent widespread happily
 
churning activity that I note in some other states and regions.
 
Let us hope that another year,  for instance,  will find New
 
Jersey with its own apprenticeship program,  and with several
 
full time field workers and folk arts staff.
 It is no more than
 
your artists deserve.
 So let us begin--remember my mother's
 
principle--By doing,  you learn to do...  by planning you learn
 
-
 21 -
 
to plan--by starting folk arts programs you learn just exactly
 
how to start folk arts programs--and that's about the only way
 
there is to do it.
 Thank you very much for inviting me -
 it is
 
a pleasure and an honor to be with you.

I' m calling my talk this morning "Some Characteristics and
 
Qualities of the Folk Arts".
 I m a folklorist,  and quite a
 
few people since  I' ve been visiting here have asked me how on
 
earth I got  interested in such an unusual field.
 Well,  my
 
father was a folklorist,  but  I myself began to acquire my own
 
personal  folk tradition long before  I really knew what my
 
father was up to.
 
When  I was a little girl about  sixty-five years ago  (
I was
 
born in  1921)
 we lived out  in the country.
 It's now a
 
suburb of Dallas
 but then it was pretty remote and so my
 
mother decided to teach me at home.  She taught me Latin and
 
piano and medieval history and lots of unusual things,  but
 
she also taught the day-to--day things.
 She taught me how to
 
sew,  for example.
 I remember sitting with her rag bag that
 
contained scraps of material  from all the clothes mother had
 
made  for us and sort of folding doll clothes  out of them.
 
But then  I had to learn how to do it  right.  My mother was a
 
great believer in doing things right.  She gave me a Latin
 
motto  (
she gave all of us  children different mottos) .
 Mine
 
was  "Faciendo ediscere facere" which means  "By doing you
 
learn to do" and she would tell me "By reading you learn to
 
read",  "by dancing you learn to dance",  "
 by sewing you learn
 
to sew".
 So I learned how to work her old foot treadle
 
Singer sewing machine.
 She would give me the front page of
 
the Dallas Morning News after
 she and father had finished
 
with it,  and -
-
 with the machine unthreaded-- I would sew up
 
and down the newsprint columns and around the photographs
 
until  I learned  just how to sew a straight  line and turn a
 
neat corner.
 And then I had to learn how to embroider -
-
because that's what all the  little girls did in my part of
 
the  country -
-
 at  least  little Anglo girls.  like me.

i  visiting here have asked me how on

 Well,  my

about  sixty-five years ago  (

 we lived out  in the country.

I
' m calling my talk this morning  "Some Characteristics and
 
Qualities of the Folk Arts".
 I m a folklorist,  and quite a
 
few people since I' ve been visiting here have asked me how on
 
earth I got  interested in such an unusual field.
 Well,  my
 
father was a folklorist,  but  I myself began to acquire my own
 
personal  folk tradition long before  I really knew what my
 
father was up to.
 
When I was a little girl about  sixty-five years ago  (
I was
 
born in 1921)
 we lived out  in the country.
 It's now a
 
suburb of Dallas
 but then it was pretty remote and so my
 
mother decided to teach me at home.  She taught me Latin and
 
piano and medieval history and lots of unusual things,  but
 
she also taught the day-to-day things.
 She taught me how to

contained scraps of material from all the clothes mother had
 
made  for us and sort of folding doll clothes out of them.
 
But then  I had to learn how to do it  right.  My mother was a
 
great believer in doing things right.  She gave me a Latin
 
motto  (
she gave all of us  children different mottos) .
 Mine
 
was  "Faciendo ediscere facere" which means  "By doing you
 
learn to do" and she would tell me "By reading you learn to
 
read",  "by dancing you learn to dance",  "
 by sewing you  learn
 
to sew".
 So I learned how to work her old foot treadle
 
Singer sewing machine.
 She would give me the front page of
 
the Dallas Morning News after
 she and father had finished
 
with it,  and -
-
 with the machine unthreaded- - I would sew up
 
and down the newsprint columns and around the photographs
 
until  I learned just how to sew a straight line and turn a
 
neat corner.
 And then I had to learn how to embroider -
-
because that's what all the  little girls did in my part of
 
the country -
-
 at  least  little Anglo girls.  like me.
 
Because every November,  my mother and I would go to the dime
 
store downtown and I would get to pick out the presents  I was
 
 
I
 
going to make  for Christmas.,  secretly, .when  she wasn't
 
looking.
 In those days you could buy dresser scarves or
 
table napkins or bridge table covers that had designs
 
stencilled on them with blue dots.
 And embroidering was to
 
cover those blue dots with French knots and lazy daisies and
 
outline stitches  in different colors  so that  it would turn
 
out to be a special present that you yourself had a hand in.
 
So after  I had
 picked out the things  I wanted to embroider
 
for my sister or my mother or my aunts,  I would go to the
 
embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.  That was
 
the best part.  There was always white embroidery thread
 
there,  I remember,  and lots of pastels -
-
 pale green,  pink,
 
lavender,  yellow,  pale blue,  and sometimes black and
 
sometimes  red and sometimes bright green.  I agonized.  I never
 
had enough money for all the colors  I wanted.  One year  I
 
remember coming home with red and black and light green and
 
pink and lavender,  and my older sister said,  "Honey,  you
 
don't want to use that  red and black.  They won't blend.  You
 
want  it to blend and be pretty."
 And I thought  it might be
 
pretty,  but  I tried it,  and it wasn't.  It didn't blend,  and I
 
had to pick it  all out and start again.
 
Now when  I remember what was  in our ragbag -
-
 scraps  from my
 
dresses and the  shirts and blouses mother made for the
 
others,  and her own dresses and aprons and good pieces  from
 
father's old business  shirts -
-
 those pieces of cloth weren't
 
scarlet or magenta or black.
 They were lavender and pink and
 
light blue,  and they were  solid colors or small prints.
 I
 
guess you could say we were conservative.
 And every once in
 
a while my mother would load the ragbag up into the car and
 
we would go to see the quilt  lady who lived about two miles
 
from us.
 This was during the depression and everybody did
 
what they knew how to do to make a few cents,  and this  lady
 
really did know how to make quilts.
 Mother and she would
 
look over all the  scraps,  and she would get out all her
 
patterns  she had cut out of the newspapers,  and they would
 
decide which pattern would look best with the material we
 
had.
 The  idea was,  you see,  not to have to buy material;
 
nobody could afford that  in those days.
 But this  lady could
 
take all our old bits and pieces and make absolutely
 
beautiful quilts out of them.
 Mother always  said she was a
 
real artist at her work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds that we  slept under every night
 
turned out to be blendy.
 They were made out of the clothes
 
we wore and the colors we had chosen and the aesthetic
 
principles we had learned -
-
 neat corners,  straight  lines,
 
balanced curves,  precise workmanship,  unemphasized dividing
 
lines,  subtle color gradations.  It's actually a wonderful
 
system -
-
 around the world it has produced some beautiful
 
effects  from 19th century Italian paintings to British flower
 
gardens to Chinese porcelains to east Texas quilts
 
But although the quilt  lady,  as everybody I knew called her,
 
was an artist,  it gradually became clear that  I wasn't.
 
Sewing just didn't really interest me.
 I learned those
 
things that an east Texas Anglo little girl needed to know
 
but that was  it.  I didn't become an artist.  On the other hand
 
those aesthetic principles  I learned as a child have never
 
left me.
 At home at this moment there  is a basket by my
 
chair full of woven squares  I have been
 putting together for
 
years  for a baby blanket,  and I smile sometimes over them
 
because with the world of color and gaiety to choose from I
 
have picked out white and pale green and the  sweetest pale
 
yellow to make those  squares out of,  because  I thought they
 
would just work up so pretty.
 
Now this  is a very homely example,  and I hope that many of
 
you recognize it and can understand its power.  But we have
 
not explored it  fully yet.
 Notice,  for example,  that
 
although my mother considered it essential  for me to learn
 
the principles of sewing,  she did not  consider it  important
 
to show me the rudiments of basketry or of pottery.
 Indeed I
 
doubt that  she knew them herself.
 
Now,  what  you do not  learn or experience marks you as
 
distinctively as what you do
I am sorry to say that as a
 
child I didn't know any Mexican or Black or Indian children
 
who were neighbors to me in east Texas,  but  I can assure you
 
it  is  likely they would have had instruction in other
 
aesthetic activities as well as  sewing.
 A recent
 research
 
project  in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South Carolina,
 
where the ancient African basketry tradition connected with
 
rice growing still thrives,
 tells us
 that every single
 
African -American man,  woman and child in that county past
 
the  lap baby stage
 can make a basket.
 They can.
 Notice
 
they all don't but they can.
 And I can't.  I don't have any
 
idea how to start.  You could lock me in the tower all night
 
with a bale of straw to weave like the princess in the fairy
 
tale and you would have to chop my head off the next morning
 
because  I wouldn't have even begun.  Basket making was not
 
part of the artistic tradition in which I was brought up.
 
Some might even  say  I was  culturally deprived.
 
And then consider the various color palettes that are in use
 
around the world.
 American Indians often emphasize clear
 
primary colors -
-
 blue,  red,  yellow -
-
 each of which can
 
represent  a different direction -
-
 east,  north,  south,  west,
 
up,  down.
 They point a way and make distinctions between
 
elements  rather than shading things together.  African
 
American
 quilters often emphasize movement and energy with
 
brilliant  color-soaked contrasts that almost vibrate to the
 
eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur yellow and lots of
 
black to set  it all off.
 The colorful visual playfulness of
 
many Mexican -American traditions depends on the use of
 
shocking pink and scarlet  and peacock blues.
 
A few years back in
 the state of Arizona Jim Griffith,  the
 
state
 folklorist noted that the very hottest,  most creative
 
pinata maker in town had been turning out awfully
 
uncharacteristic pinatas -
-
 all white and baby blue and pale
 
pale pink.
 Now,  this artist was  so highly thought of in
 
Tucson that the University of Arizona football team had
 
several times commissioned him to make mammoth pinatas of the
 
Wildcats or the Roadrunners -
-
 whatever their emblem was -
-
and those pinatas had ridden in honor in the victory parades.
 
Jim
 became  increasingly disturbed by this apparent  shift  in
 
aesthetic sensibilities,  for it turned out that other
 
regional pinata makers were also abandoning their usual
 
palettes of electric blue,  scarlet,  lime green and shocking
 
pink.  Everybody was going absolutely and uncharacteristically
 
pastel all of a sudden and
 Jim got really curious as to what
 
on earth was going on,  what  factors had stimulated this
 
really major aesthetic change.
 Was  it a kind of art nouveau
 
idea coming up north from Mexico?
 Was  it  some sort of
 
attempt to imitate another possibly more glamorouos
 
aesthetic?
 Had the art teachers with their color wheels
 
gotten in there and persuaded the pinata makers to work  for
 
gentler,  more melding effects  instead of looking across the
 
color spectrum for brilliance and contrast?
 
The answer turned out to be pretty simple -
-
 awful,  but
 
simple.
 The wholesale paper company that  serviced almost
 
all of the state of Arizona had determined that the major
 
tissue papers that were being bought  in bulk across the state
 
were  light-colored;  department and gift  stores everywhere
 
used white,  pale blue,  and pale pink tissues to wrap their
 
merchandise in,  and they were the big-time quantity
 
consumers.
 The  sales of burnt orange,  emerald,  crimson,
 
aquamarine,  royal purple tissue papers were negligible by
 
contrast,  so -
-
 well,  it was a good hard business problem and
 
a good hard business  decision got made.
 No more bright
 
colored tissue paper;  we can't afford it;  it doesn't make a
 
dime.
 Now,  just  for a moment,  let us together look privately
 
into our own silent,  art-loving and profit-loving hearts and
 
think -
-
 if I were a big-time paper manufacturer and times
 
were hard,  what would I do?
 
Well,  what  Jim did,  not being a paper manufacturer but a
 
practical man and a first-class  folklorist,  was to stockpile
 
in his own private closet  in his own private living room a
 
number of industrial-sized rolls of a full range of brilliant
 
color-soaked tissue papers.
 And any pinata maker in southern
 
Arizona could come by and quietly take off a yard or a mile
 
as needed of any of the colors according to his own aesthetic
 
taste.
 And what do you know -
-
 things  just began to sort of
 
subside back to normal;  there were fewer and fewer white or
 
pastel pinatas and more and more lively multi-colored ones,
 
and pretty soon everybody had forgotten about the great
 
southern Arizona color change.
 
But what  I learned from it was that our system is a very
 
powerfully integrated system,  and it works all of a piece,
 
and what happens here affects what happens there.
 And I
 
thought of how many thousand similar tiny dramas are being
 
acted out every day in thousands of different subtly
 
injurious ways  in thousands of American places.
 And I began
 
to believe we of the arts world must reflect together more
 
frequently and in greater depth on how we might mitigate the
 
masive forces  in our nation that grind away steadily and
 
often unconsciously towards artistic conformity and cultural
 
uniformity.
 
So  far  I have been trying to demonstrate how folk arts
 
quietly emerge  from the aesthetic patterns expressive of
 
particular folk groups,  groups that define themselves as
  
themselves by virtue of sharing one or more common factors
 
ethnicity,  occupation,  location,  language,  or religion,
 
perhaps.  (
It's easier  sometimes to think about this  if you
 
recall how you might choose to remember a person you just met
 
-
-
 by virtue of where he lives,  what she does,  what church he
 
attends or what  language she speaks;  most
 of us belong at
 
one time or another to more than one  folk group.)
 
And every person who  is a member of a folk group is exposed
 
to  (or you might  say "learns")  its
 particular aesthetic
 
pattern and carries  it with him as a point of aesthetic
 
reference the rest of her life.  This is why the current
 
emphasis on "multi-culturalism"  in the arts agenda,  as badly
 
defined and confusing as the discussion so often is,  is of
 
such vital importance.
 Every individual,  regardless of the
 
aesthetic system of his or her family
 or community,  needs
 
see that  system treated with respect and appreciation an
 
genuine understanding.  When this happens,  individuals car.
 
allow themselves
 to be open to other aesthetic experiences
 
and become gladdened by variety rather than frightened or
 
angered.
 Each new aesthetic exposurethen serves to broaden
 
and deepen our personalities,  making us more wise,  more
 
humane,  more  subtle.
 
It  is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie and
 
how potent they are.
 Some years ago I was attending a
 
concert that presented a sampling of the musicians scheduled
 
to appear at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles
 
It was quite a show.  There were scores of musical
 
performances  from all around the world;  kilted Scots
 
bagpipers marched down the center aisle;  African drummers
 
thundered from the stage,  mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted,  gospel choirs  filled the enormous hail with
 
sonorities.
 I was  in my element
 making knowledgable remarks
 
to my companions,  (showing off,  frankly)  thrilling to each
 
extraordinary set of sounds.  The whole thing went on for
 
hours,  each performance more special than the last,  until
 
almost at the end three  slightly bedraggled looking men
 
carrying a banjo,  a guitar and a string bass  shambled out on
 
the  stage,  fussed around rather unprofessionally for a minute
 
or two and then struck up --"Red Wing".
 
"Red Wing!" The corniest of all tunes,  the one you never know
 
whether you should
 
ultimately
 
absolutely
 
well-being
 
home,  that
 
silly.
 
melted.
 
sing in public or not,  it's text  is  so
 
But they played "Red Wing" and my heart
 
The most extraordinary sense
 
came over me,  I was comforted,  I was
 
of total
 
secure,  I was
 
was my song.  And I realized to my vast
 
embarrassment that  if  I had seen a copy of the program ahead
 
of time,  "Red Wing" would have been the last of my list of
 
possible  favorites.I had moved so far away from my roots  I
 
had forgotten where they lay.  But my roots hadn't  forgotten.
 
There they were,  ready to remind me who I am and where  I come
 
from.
 
So that,  ultimately is what multi-culturalism is about,
 
making sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back
 
to his own roots every once in a while for comfort and
 
dignity and presence and on the other hand gets a chance to
 
revel in the glories of the inventiveness that other cultures
 
have to share with us.
 It's a nice system;  we  just have to
 
keep on trying to ensure that everybody gets their turn.
 And
 
we may find that that may mean
 giving up  just a bit of the
 
prime time on the media and in the schools,  time that  is
 
typically reserved for popular music,  advertising art,  and
 
classical European art  forms of all types.  That may be a
 
really tough battle;  don't  ever under-estimate it.
 
And then we have to go on working to keep the overall quality
 
high.
 
and an
 
around
 
Remember,  my quilt  lady as compared to me as a child
 
adult.  She was an artist.  I wasn't.
 And everybody
 
knew that.  If you had asked anybody in our county who
 
was a good quilt maker,  every one would have mentioned
 this
 
lady's name.
 They could also have told you -
-
 depending on
 
who you asked -
-
 who was a good blues picker,  or who knew the
 
whole of the Mexican-American religious drama "Las Posadas".
 
Everybody in a folk group knows the traditional art forms and
 
has experienced
 and internalized their basic aesthetic
 
principles,  but this does not mean that every member of that
 
group is an artist.  Artists are  special
 members of any
 
community and must be  cherished as such.
 
It's the  same  in any art  form anywhere.
 I once wrote that  it
 
probably takes  10,000  little girls  learning to play "Fur
 
Elise" or the  "Happy Farmer" or "Chopsticks" or whatever your
 
first piano tune was to produce one Dame Myra Hess  (or any
 
other piano virtuoso.)
 Every individual artist regardless of
 
art  form or origin emerges out of and depends upon a massive
 
support  system consisting of elders who have conveyed the
 
"rudiments" at an early age,  of teachers who recognize and
 
polish budding talent,  of other artists who compare and
 
compete,  of promoters who present and exhibit,  of audiences
 
who applaud and buy,  of critics who scold and praise.
 All of
 
these are necessary to support  just one artist.
 But then,
 
how can you  judge which is more  important to a mountain,  the
 
top or the bottom-- the peak or the bedrock?
 
Actually,  the longer ± work with folk arts,  the more it  seems
 
to me the problems  in folk arts are exactly the same as the
 
problems  in all art  forms whether you call them classical or
 
fine or popular or whatever.  All artists have pretty much the
 
same needs.  They need to be heard or seen or experienced,
 
they need their work to get out  into the world.  They need
 
audiences,  whether large or small,  but they do need educated
 
and sophisticated audiences -
 that  is,  audiences that
 
understand the rudiments of the particular art  form and won't
 
be expecting excitement where serenity is the order of the
 
art or blendy colors where visual contrast  is the
 
desideratum.
 
And there are some other simple needs that all artists,  folk
 
and fine,  share.
 They need to have their work included in
 
public school curricula so that all children can be exposed
 
to their special aesthetic principles,  they need to
 
their property and personal rights protected from
 
exploitation,  they need to be able to make a little
 
have
 
money at
 
their art  form from time to time.
 Finally,  they need to be
 
criticized;  they need to have their work held to high
 
standards,  so long as,  of course,  the standards are the
 
standards of that aesthetic system.
 For that,  you need a
 
corps of aficionados,  people who have  steeped themselves in
 
the particular aesthetic system,  who love it and defend it.
 
This  is why folk arts specialists  (like your fine Colorado
 
trio -
-
 Bea Roeder,  Ronna Lee Sharpe
 and Kathy Figgin)  spend
 
much of their time making sure that qualified expertise from
 
inside and
 outside the community is  involved in every major
 
folk arts project.
 
The  field of folk arts  is not  special because of its problems
 
or its needs,  then,
 but more because of its approach.
 Let's
 
compare a community arts,  an ethnic arts,  and a folk arts
 
program.
 
A good community arts program,  in my experience,  rejoices  in
 
what  is already there within
 a particular population,  or
 
what  is ready to be developed.
 A jazz trombonist,  an easel
 
painter,  a classical violist,  a cartoonist,  a coicha
  
embroiderer -
-
 a community arts program embaraces them all.
 
Its primary goal  is participation,  community involvement.
 It
 
tries to create a more  joyful surround by virtue of involving
 
as many people as possible  in the making and receiving and
 
distributing of art -
-
 all kinds of art:  folk,  popular and
 
fine,  from all kinds of people -
-
 setting up community
 
theaters,  community choruses,  community art galleries where
 
openness  is the order of the day,  where everybody can come
 
and try their hand.  It's a great  idea and I support  it to the
 
fullest.
 My main concern with the community arts movement  is
 
that they sometimes overlook their resident  folk artists,
 
their local traditional arts,  and bring in too many people
 
from outside, .
 though I' m happy to say this does not seem to
 
be true in Colorado.  Remember though that every community
 
contains unplumbed depths,  artists that are waiting to be
 
found.
 
Turning to the  so-called "ethnic art" movement,  the term
 
"ethnic" tends,  these days,  to refer to people who share not
 
only the  same language but the same history and,  at some past
 
time,  the  same geographical area.
 They have a solidarity
 
that only time and propinquity can bestow.
 They are the kind
 
of people who,  when they move to a different place such as
 
the United States,  get referred to in a hyphenated sort of
 
way -
-
 African-American9
 Polish-Americans,  Chinese-
Americans ;For,  if they went to Brazil,  they would be Afro-
Brazilians,  and so forth.
 The important thing to remember
 
about  such-
- people is that they were originally un-hyphenated:
 
they were Africans,  they were Poles,  they were Chinese.
 As
 
such,  they had created a number of different kinds of complex
 
art  forms:  classic  (elite),  popular,  and -
-
 more than likely
 
-
-
 several forms of traditional  (or folk) .
 It  is  insulting
 
to such people to confine them to only one art  form.
 
Should a group of Polish-Americans ask my advice on
 
organizing a major Polish-American cultural  festival,  I would
 
tell them that they should include in their planning all the
 
range of Polish cultural creativity -
-
 they should have
 
Chopin concerts and Paderewski concerts and polka band
 
concerts  (preferably with dancing)
 and concerts of the mouth
 
music of the Tatra mountains,  along with exhibits of paper
 
cuts as well as  easel and memory painting,  etc.
 
For the folk arts always exist as part of these larger
 
surrounds.
 Let me remind you once again -
-
 folk arts emerge
 
from a group of people who share  something in common,  and
 
they speak especially,  therefore,  of and to that particular
 
group.
 This  is their big difference from the fine or popular
 
arts which try to speak across cultural boundaries to much
 
larger audiences and whose messages are therefore often more
 
diluted.  Folk arts,  being learned informally and passed on
 
from one group member to another by a process a young student
 
of mine once called "mouth to ear resuscitation"  (
I gave her
 
an A),
 utilize a shared aesthetic style characteristic of
 
the group.
 Think,  for instance,  of Hawaiian hulas,
 African-
American blues;  Navajo sand-paintings.
 There is nothing
 
whatever to prevent,  say,  an Alaskan Eskimo from learning to
 
hula,  but  it will remain a Hawaiian hula that has been
 
learned;  it  is highly unlikely ever to be considered an
 
Eskimo hula.
 
This Eskimo hula dancer notion reminds me to point out that
 
in the folk arts,  as  I again tried to demonstrate  in my
 
original personal story,  there are different kinds of
 
artists.
 From the point of view of the folk group itself,
 
probably the most culturally valuable are those who have been
 
brought up within the tradition,  learning the arts as they
 
live the  life that the art  itself stems  from and enlivens..
 
Such people are  sometimes called "tradition bearers" or
 
"culture bearers";  they have the authority that comes out of
 
a kind of total cultural immersion.  And they exist  in other
 
fields of art as well.
 I have always thought that Nadia
 
Boulanger must have been a tradition bearer in the  field of
 
classical piano.
 
Then there are those  folk artists who
 have been brought up
 
within a tradition and who determine that they will develop
 
it  into new ways.
 They are the  innovators,  the "new wavers".
 
Sometimes they bring it off and create a refreshing and
 
exciting new artistic style  (
such as blue grass)  that becomes
 
accepted by others and gets added into the cultural
 
repertoire.  More often,  they don't,  and they sink into a
 
noble and honorable oblivion,  unheard of by future
 
generations.  This  is why by the way,  folklorists tend to ask
 
how long a particular style or repertoire has been active;
 
time must  eventually prove the pudding.
 
Finally,  there are practitioners
 who have not been brought
 
up within a tradition but who decide at some point  in their
 
lives to learn  it.
 This  is a natural human impulse -
-
 to
 
admire deeply,  to the point of personal commitment -
-
somebody else's art  form,  and it  should never be denigrated.
 
Such practices  stretch the aesthetic muscles and increase the
 
humane and tender side of an artist's character.
 The outside
 
learner -
-
 the  "revivalist',  the
 "interpreter" must,
 
however,  remember that the oncoming phase,  the future
 
development of the art  form he or she has adopted will
 
invariably arise from the authentic artists -
-
 the in-born,
 
in-bred culture carriers,  whether old-fashioned conservatives
 
or young innovators.
 The  local Armenian oudist after all,  is
 
likely to stay working away at his music long after the
 
eclectic young outside learner is off trying his hand at
 
Bolivian pan pipes or Appalachian hoe-downs.It's the long
 
steady haul that does the  job in culture change almost
 
always.
 
So when the Folk Arts Program began,  it  looked at the three
 
previous groups and
 adopted a particular order of critical
 
necessity in its  funding policies.
 First,  we decided,  we
 
must try to support the authentic old-time tradition bearers,
 
in the first place because nobody else was doing it,
 but
 
also because of their essential function as  seed beds of the
 
future.
 Only then would we try  (if there was any extra
 
money)  to help the emerging exploratory art  forms that were
 
growing out ot traditional cultures and the outside learners.
 
And state programs across the nation have also adopted those
 
principles with a totally acceptable amount of local
 
variation.
 In fact,  I urge state programs to develop their
 
own guidelines and principles appropriate to their particular
 
situation,  and many have.
 I personally believe it  is the
 
federal Folk Arts Program's continued emphasis on variation
 
and local originality that has  spurred the growth of the
 
current  50  state folk arts programs.  The record is really
 
extraordinary,  and the changes during the past decade in
 
national attitudes towards the basic issues of cultural
 
diversity represented by the Folk Arts Program have also been
 
extraordinary.  We' ve been riding a big wave,  barely keeping
 
on top of the curl.
 
For example,  the following remarkable  statement, with which I
 
do not agree in all  its detail,  appeared recently in -
-
 of
 
all  improbable publications -
-
 TIME magazine;  it was written
 
by Robert Hughes.  He was  speaking of multi-culturalism,  and
 
he  said:
 
"America  is a place  filled with diversity,  unsettled
 
histories,  images  impinging on one another and spawning
 
unexpected shapes.
 Its polyphony of voices,  its  constant
 
eddying of claims to identity is one of the things that make
 
America America.
 This gigantic,  riven,  hybridized,
 
multiracial republic each year receives a major share of the
 
world's emigration,  legal or illegal.
 
"To put the argument  for multiculturalism in merely practical
 
terms of  self-interest:  though elites are never going to go
 
away,  the composition of those elites  is not necessarily
 
static.
 The future of American ones,  in a globalized economy
 
without a cold war,  will rest with people who can think and
 
act with informed grace across ethnic,  cultural,  linguistic
 
lines.  And the  first  step in becoming such a person lies  in
 
acknowledging that we are not one big world family,  or ever
 
likely to be;  that the diffrences among races,  nations,
 
cultures and their various histories are at  least as profound
 
and as durable as the similarities;  that these diferences are
 
not divagations  from a European norm  but structures
 
eminently worth knowing about  for their own sake.
 In the
 
world that  is coming,  if you can't navigate differences,
 
you' ve had it.
 
And as a little girl who started out a long time ago loving
 
string band music and lazy daisy stitches and who spent most
 
of her life trying to  learn how to "think and act with
 
informed grace across ethnic,  cultural and linguistic lines"
 
I can testify that always  caring for and putting in first
 
place the traditional root  cultural forms that we call the
 
folk arts,  has opened for me deep friendships and made
 
mutual alliances possibe with people of all sorts and
 
backgrounds across the entire country.  We tend to speak a
 
very basic language together,  and whenever I have the
 
privilege of travelling to visit another local group in
 
another state,
 I realize how strong many of these local art
 
forms are,  how brilliant and engaging their practitioners,
 
how ready they are for new audiences and new ways to open up
 
and enliven their particular part of the world.  To help them
 
with their purposes is a wonderful work of the hand and the
 
spirit -
-
 the better because it will never be finished.
 Let
 
us hope that the years to come will herald a new coalition of
 
energies working steadily and positively
 and with "informed
 
grace"
 across  cultural lines,  to help our country delight  in
 
its own artistry,  its own extraordinary history,  its own
 
remarkably individual cultural past-present-future.
 We
 
probably don't know at this moment exactly how to do all
 
this,  but  remember what my mother always  said -
-
 Faciendo
 
ediscere  facere -
-
 by doing we learn to do.  So let us begin,
 
let us do,  and let us keep doing again,  and again.  What
 
better task can we  see before us?
