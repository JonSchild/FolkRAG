Pretty Molly
PRETTY MOLLY 5119 A1
Pauline Ramsay Visalia, 1941
Pretty Molly, Pretty Molly Come go along with me Before we get married Some friends for
to see
He lead her o'er hollers And valleys so deep At last Pretty Molly Began for to weep
Sweet William, sweet William Yore leading me astray An innocent love You shall betray
Pretty Molly, pretty Molly Yore guessin' jest right For I dug at yore grave One half of last
night
Stand back, stand back No time, to stand And innocent he stood With a big knife in his
hand
He stabbed her to the heart And her blood it did flow And into her grave Her body did go
Now ladymens and gentlemens I bid you do right For Gray was distracted And died the
same night
