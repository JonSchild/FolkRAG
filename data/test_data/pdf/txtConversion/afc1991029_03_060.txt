Informant/Event:  Arrival of Research Party to St.  John Valley
 
Coworker: Whitman,  David;  Taylor,  David;  Hall,  Stephanie
 
Site:  trip from Bangor to Ft.  Kent;  Eagle Lake;  Ft.  Kent Hotel
 
The drive from Bangor was pleasent and stimulating.
 On the first
 
leg of the journey,  Stephanie rode with me.
 
We  discussed  her  work  with  the  deaf.
 Her  second  language  is
 
"sign."
 Stephanie contends that American Sign Language  (ASL)  is
 
French and not drived from American Indian sign languages as I had
 
read someplace.
 She said that the source of ASL goes back to a
 
book  published  during  the  18th  century  (
?)  by  a Frenchman  who
 
collected the language from the streets of Paris ethnographically.
 
Stephanie said that deaf preachers were the best educated and most
 
creative  signers.
 Preachers  switch  from  English-based  sign  (a
 
higher status language)  to ASL throughout their delivery.
 
David Taylor  switched places with  Stephanie  at Medway.
 He  rode
 
with me into Eagle Lake.
 Taylor said that this project needed to
 
look at a full range of folklife and folklore more so than study
 
anything particular in depth.
 
We  arrived  at  the  home  of  Mrs.  Catherine  (Cindy)  Brown.
 John
 
Brown,  her  son,  was  also  at  the  house.
 We  discussed  the  large
 
white and mottled ugly dog-like creature we almost ran over as we
 
were  approaching  Eagle  Lake.
 Apparently  this  creature  was  an
 
Eastern Coyote(?)  -
-
 a breed that has crossed with large tame dogs
 
and remained feral.
 
We unloaded at the beautiful camp on Eagle Lake that will be our
 
home for the nexttwo months.
 Fantastic
 
That PM we ate at the Ft. Kent Hotel.
 The food is excellent!
 The
 
restaurant  is  called the Brass  Lantern.
 There were many  French
 
speakers  dining  within  earshot.
 No  one  under  40  was  observed
 
speaking French.
 However, there were relatively few people within
 
earshot who were under 40.
 
Took a long walk after supper.
 Walked along levee on US bank of
 
St.  John River -
-
 felt like home.
 We visited the Block House on
 
the  Fish River.
 Walked  to  Church  and  St.  Francois  Manoir  (Old
 
Folks Home).
 Visited graveyard.
 Many graves of the 19th century
 
bear the inscription  
 epouse de  
,
 or  
 epoux de
 
 
 
Oldest grave appears to be 1842.
 
Gray and red color combination and eagle medallions on houses were
 
noticed.

Informant/Event:  first meetings on campus at Ft.  Kent
 
Coworker: Whitman, David; Ornstein, Lisa; Hall,  Stephanie; Taylor,
 
David
 
Site:  University of Maine -
 Ft.  Kent
 
Met  with  Dr.  Richard  G.  Dumont,  President  of  the  University  of
 
Maine,  Ft.  Kent at 1
:00PM.
 Dumont had been at Northwest Missouri
 
University in Merryville, Missouri.
 We also met with Dr. Myrna H.
 
Cassel,  Vice-President  of  Academic  Affairs.
 Dr.  Cassel  was  at
 
University of Missouri-Kansas City prior to comming to Maine.
 
Dumont  is  interested  in  seeing that UM-K  focuses  on the Acadian
 
culture of the St.  John Valley.
 His family was from Quebec and I
 
believe he was raised in southern Maine not far from Lewiston.
 
Later  met  with  Dick  Buchard,  head  of  physical  plant.
 Buchard
 
issued keys to us.
 I was  issued the  "P" key along with keys for
 
Howard Marshall.
 
We then began to unload Library of Congress boxes and rearrange the
 
office in Crocker Hall.
 There is a massive amount of equipment.
 
Ate supper at the Maple Leaf on the Canadian side.
 Before we ate
 
we drove down to the northern bank of the  St.  John in Clair  and
 
visited the historic structures placed there.
 There is one large
 
house and one gable-fronted log cabin. My first impression is that
 
these structures have been moved to present locations and that they
 
hve been heavily restored/ reconstructed?  [later  learned that the
 
large house allegedly has ship's knee supports  in its attic -
-
 I
 
intend to check this out  (6-10-91)].
 
Food  and  prices  at  the  Maple  Leaf  were  less  than  completely
 
satisfying.  The baked hallibut was dryed completely out.  Canadian
 
beer  cost  $3.00.
 Exchange  rate  offered  by  the  Maple  Leaf  was
 
12
. 5%.
 
Drove west from Clair along the Canadian side for 20 miles or so.
 
Stephanie Hall was at the wheel.
 The large 4-square house look as
 
though  they  have  a floor  plan  quite  distinct  from those  in  the
 
Midwest.
 These nearly always have asymetrical front door openings
 
and the first floor in very open.
 A large living room was clearly
 
visible from the road.
 This open living room often ran neary the
 
entire breadth of the house.
 House with "ski slope" roofs  (avec
 
les  larmier) seem to be more common on the Canadian side of
 the
 
St.  John.

Informant/Event:  Evening at B.J.'s Tavern in Ft.  Kent
 
Coworker:  Taylor,  David; Hall,  Stephanie; Whitman,  David
 
Site:  B.J.s  Tavern  located  on  the  south  side  of  Hwy  1 near  the
 
bridge in Fort Kent
 
Whitman and Brassieur met Hall and Taylor at B.J.s Tavern around
 
8:40 PM.
 We ordered beers and started a tab.
 We put $1.00 in the
 
juke box but it was not easy to pick songs that suited our taste.
 
A small percentage of the tunes were Country and Western.
 These
 
were  arranged  to  the  far  right  and  all  had  green  labels.
 The
 
majority of the tunes were popular soft rock, disco, MTV numbers --
or  so  I  assume,
 as  I  really  have  very  little  knowledge  of
 
contemporary poplular repertoires.
 
The ceiling of B.J.s is covered with 21 X 31 (approx.)  panels of
 
plastic-coated  masonite.
 Each  of  these  panels  have  been  hand
 
painted with the personal  logo of the  "owner"  of the panel.

 Some  of  the  panels  are

We began to meet people when we retired to the game room.
 Whitman
 
and I challenged Taylor and one of the locals named Kelly to a game
 
of  foosball.
 Kelly wanted  to  bet  a beer  on the  game  and,  opon
 
losing, he bought Brassieur and Whitman a beer.
 They were given a
 
rematch and won.
 I returned the favor of a beer to -Kelly.
 As it
 
turned out,  this fellow,  apparently in late 30s,  was once an aide
 
to Representative Martin.  Kelly was from Allagash and told me that
 
the people there were not French but Irish and Scottish.
 He said
 
that he nevertheless speaks French.
 He suggested that we go down
 
to Allagash because we would find a completely different view of
 
the Valley.
 
with a Quebecqouis accent was also comm on. There were a few bikers.

David  Taylor  began  the  meeting  with  a well-spoken  and  gracious
 
introduction.
 He  then  allowed  participants  to  introduce
 
themselves.
 By
 way
 of
 introduction,
 I  informed
 the
 
participants of my former roles as curator of the Longfellow-
Evangeline  State  Park  and  folkorist  for  the  Jean  Lafitte
 
National Park in La.
 
Marsalla Belanger-Violette, of Van Buren.
 She is the wife of Elmer
 
Violett,  former  State  Supreme  Court  Justice.
 She  was  the
 
first  from  the  Valley  to  receive  a doctorate  (PhD).
 Her
 
dissertation, Le Fait Français, presents an interpretation of
 
Acadian history from the perspective of the St.  John Valley.
 
She studied long with the priests and sisters (Mairist mostly)
 
and loves to talk about the roles and histories of the orders,
 
clergy, churches, parishes, etc., etc.  During the meeting she
 
was quite animated and  intense.
 She staunchly supports the
 
conservation of French  language;  at one point she said,  "la
 
langue c'est 1'âme d'un peuple."
 
Gil Albert was  born and raised on the Maine  side  of  the border,
 
across from St.  Pamphile.
 He went to school on the Canadian
 
side.  Albert is an outspoken supporter of bilingual education
 
and
 an
 expert
 on
 the
 cultural
 significance
 of
 the
 
International  boundary.
 He  mentioned  to  me  that  Richard
 
Guidry's  cousin  (Richard  is  from Geydan,  Louisiana),  Monica
 
Guidry,  lives  with Arlene  Keaton,  director  of  the  Kathadin
 
Area Health Clinic(?).
 
Geraldine Pelletier Chassé talked in a rambling way about Madawaska
 
Territory, the Acadian Festival, and Acadian geneaology.
 She
 
spoke of "le grand menage" as a current "season" now affecting
 
Acadian women in the Valley  .
.
.
 "
 they must touch everything
 
with a wet  cloth."
 She gave an example of  a young Acadian
 
woman who was walking around her house wiping every surface
 
with a wet rag.
 This young newly-wed had said to her mother
 
that,  "I guess this urge to clean is like a rite of passage."
 
Ms.  Chassé  said  that  some  people  think  this  compulsion  to
 
clean is in the Acadian genes.
 
Guy  Dubay  added  to  the  comments  of  Mrs.  Chassé  that  the  Valley
 
residents  have  been through  the  "Seras  and Roebuck  era"  as
 
well.
 He was trying to  say that the  locals have also been
 
allured  by  labor  saving  devices  and  modern  conveniences.
 
Dubay is a realist.  He presented an article written by Tessie
 
Dubois published in the St.  John Valley Times, June 5,  1991,
 
p.  7 .
.
.
 "MEA  results  for  Fort  Kent  show  that  90%  of  the
 
district's fourth-graders report they are monolingual!"
 
David  Raymond  was  very  eloquent  in  his  support  of  the  French
 
language  in the Valley.
 He  said that the Valley residents
 
need a program that goes beyond festivals and other short term
 
performances or periodical presentations.
 
Adrien Bérubé  is  interested  in cartography.
 Lately he has  been
 
developing a list of what he calls the "definitions of Acadian
 
identity."  Adrien and Cyrill talked about bilingual education
 
in New Brunswick.  There is a choice -
-
 either entirely French
 
or entirely English.
 There is no educational opportunity to
 
combine the two languages.
 
Cyrill  Simard  is  interested  in  the  political  and  ideological
 
aspects of identity.
 He acknowledged Adrien as his teacher.
 
Guy Dubay brought up the example of Sheila McDonald,  of the Maine
 
State Museum,  the project director of  "Chez-Nous:  The Saint
 
John Valley."  He said that it was possible for an outsider to
 
do  good  work  in  the  area.
 The  group  agreed  with  Guy  and
 
offered a receipe for success based on the McDonald model -
-
be knowledgeable, willing to learn; realize the importance of
 
the family;  be patient;  and above all,  be sincere.

Site:  UMFK office;  St.  Agatha;  Eagle Lake
 
Debbie Prignitz  (207-896-3063),  an instructor at UNFK,  came by to
 
share some information about Stockholm and New Sweeden.
 She said
 
that the New Sweeden Museum is now open and that the Midsummer Fest
 
will  be held June  22.
 She  said that the Historical  Society had
 
recently restored a blacksmith forge.
 
Debbie suggested that her neighbors,  Charlene and Peter Espling,
 
would  be  excellent  informants.
 Both  are  longterm  residents  in
 
their  80s.
 Charlene  owned  a little  general  store  (lamplighter
 
store?).
 
Lisa 0.,  David W.,  and Ray B.  went on an outing today.
 We needed
 
to get out of the office.
 There is much organizational work needed
 
at the office but we had not made any significant sortie into the
 
field.
 By the time we had organized the field kits and loaded the
 
car it was already 5:30pm.
 We took off anyway.
 
We took Hwy 1 down to Frenchville viewing a magnificent double barn
 
and the old buckwheat mill.
 We ate  supper at Rosette's.
 First
 
taste of JoJo potatoes.
 They are cut lenthwise into thick pieces,
 
baked for a while,  rolled in flour, then fried.  [There are no JoJo
 
potatoes in Fort Kent. We later found that Madawaska does have them
 
but Van Buren apparently does not.]
 
We spotted a large cache of potato barrels,  some with natural vine
 
bands,  behind a potato house on Hwy 1 near the road to St. Agatha.
 
Looks  like these are still used.
 Are there any other barrels  in
 
North America currently in commercial farm use that are banded with
 
natural vines?
 I thought that vine bands had long been out of use
 
in the cooper trade.
 
We drove to St. Agatha viewing a very well preserved potato double
 
barn and a very interesting Historical Society building.
 
On Hwy 162, on east side of the road,  at the edge of Lake Long,  1/4
 
mile below the Sporting Club, we noticed a funny looking wharf with
 
wheels at one end.
 It looked like the contraption we had noticed
 
at Eagle Lake near our camp.
 We photographed this wharf.
 It was
 
approx. 20 feet long X 40 inches wide.
 The structure  consisted of
 
two  long  round  ceder  runners  averaging  approx  6"  diameter  with
 
planking nailed across them to form a warf.
 The planking was 3/4"
 
X 40" x various widths.
 On one end there was an axle that sported
 
two  steel  wheels  of  the  type  that  came  with  early  20th  century
 
steel-wheeled  farm wagons  sold by Sears  and others.
 On the end
 
opposite  the  wheels,  a short  length  of  3/4"  synthetic  line  was
 
nailed to the deck of the wharf.
 This line was evidently to pull
 
the rolling wharf from place to place.
 
As  we were  documenting this  wharf,  a man  came  out  of  the house
 
directly across Hwy 162 from the wharf.
 His name was Jack Caron,
 
approx 45 years old.
 He had built this rolling wharf five years
 
ago.
 He quessed that the wheels were fifty years old or so.
 His
 
name for it was "quai."  He said that everyone around Long Lake had
 
one of these.
 The quai was  needed because the  ice on the  lake,
 
which is 3" thick each year, would smash any permenant wharfs.  The
 
wheels allow the boatman to pull the wharf to a safe distance from
 
the ice.
 Caron said that he had seen these rolling quai all of his
 
life.
 There  length  depends  upon  the  profile  of  the  underwater
 
surface at the landing site.
 If the landing is very shallow,  the
 
quai  needs  to  be  longer.
 The  quai  allows  dry  landings  along
 
gradually sloping beaches with very shallow water.
 
When we returned to our Eagle Lake after this trip,  John Brown was
 
there.
 He is the owner of the rolling quai near the camp.
 I asked
 
him what he called that wharf-like device.
 He first called it a
 
"cajeu."  "Cajeu," as we later found,  is the term applied to lumber
 
rafts.
 [See McDermott, Read,  Dupratz for colonial use of the term
 
to signify "raft"].
 When I told Brown that Caron had called it a
 
"quai"  Brown  said,  "a  tchai,"  yes,  it  is  a tchai."
 [Note  that
 
Brown was changing the hard  [k]  sound to the  [tch]  sound.  This is
 
common in Acadian French where,  for instance, "quell become "tchue."

 She didn't want any information -
-
 she only
 
wanted photos.
 She said she had the press release and that was all
 
she needed.
 [update -

 the article that finally came out during
 
the Acadian Festival week had my name as David A.  Brassieur!]

Cathy  Voisine  Corey,  born  11/23/66  Fort  Kent,  Maine.
 Cathy  is
 
married  to  Robert  Joseph  Corey,  the  descendent  of  a Lebanese
 
peddler that came to Caribou around the turn of the 20th century.
 
Robert
 Corey
 owns
 Robert's

 in  Madawaska.
 It  was
 
interesting  that  Cathy was  not  wearing  any wedding  ring  and  no
 
noticable  jewelry.
 Cathy  brought  her  3 month  old  son,  Samuel
 
Joseph, to the office.
 He was a very big and a very good baby --no
 
trouble at all.
 
Cathy's father is Raynold "Ti-Bee" Voisine.
 There were 16 kids in
 
his family.
 He has been working in the lumber and logging business
 
since he was  12  years  old.
 He  is  now driving  a logging truck.
 
Cathy's mother is Myrna Daigle.  Cathey's maternal (
?) grandmother,
 
Rella Pelletier,  went to finishing school in Boston.
 Cathy calls
 
her grandmother " M e m é

Cathy graduated from high school in 1984 and subsequently took some
 
Psychology and Public Relations college courses.  After High School
 
Cathy  ran  off  to  Florida  and  lived  in  various  situations.
 her
 
mother does not know about this part of her life.
 
Cathy claims that the Acadian motto is "do it babe!"  She says that
 
"the Acadians really stick together."
 
Cathey  said  that  the  Madawaska  Historical  Society  is  closed  to
 
outsiders.
 The  leaders  of  the  MHS  are  Bern  Albert,
 Roger
 
Thibodeau,  and  Blackie  Cyr.
 Cathy  said  that  was  some  jealousy
 
between Madawaska  and  Ft.  Kent because  Ft.  Kent had  stolen  some
 
information  (7)  research  (
?)  from Madawaska and taken credit for
 
it.
 There  is  not a good working relationship  between these two
 
historical societies.
 
Cathy talked about the Tante Blanche legend and the Tante Blanche
 
Museum.
 A white building with black shutters in Madawaska that is
 
107  years  old.
 She  told  us  about  a series  of  houses  built  by
 
Fraser Mill  for  workers.
 These  hosues  are  located  on  Bungalow
 
Hill.
 She said that they were not fancy or particularly old but
 
that they may be significant.
 Cathey told us about Brise Culotte
 
Road in the Long Lake vicinity which got its name because it was so
 
rough that it would tear peoples' pants when they road a wagon down
 
this road.
 She said that the name of this road had been changed on
 
the maps to "Brisciotte" road.
 
We worked  late  in the office tonight.
 Ate at Hoagies  on Market
 
Street in Fort Kent.
 Lisa met a fiddler named Sam Oakes whi was
 
ordering supper.
 Oakes  is  a member  of Poor  Poor Woodsman band.

I cooked rice and gravy (London broil was on sale for $1.98/ib) and
 
a sort of mottled dried bean we found at the Ft.  Kent IGA called
 
"Jack's cattle beans."
 These beans are mottled red and white.
 [I
 
also  bought  some  "yelloweye  beans"  packaged  in  Indiana.]
 The
 
cattle beans  looked  and tasted  like pinto beans  after they were
 
cooked.
 I cooked them with smoked ham hocks purchased at the Ft.
 
Kent IGA.
 These hocks are thoroughly smoked without other curing
 
agents.
 This type of smoked product  is easy to obtain along the
 
Gulf coast but is not generally available in Missouri.  Lisa joined
 
Whitman and I for lunch.
 
After  lunch,  Whitman  and  Lisa  took  off  to  catch  the  Fish  River
 
canoe race.
 The race began at Soldier Pond and  fnished  in Fort
 
Kent.
 Whitman reported that he  saw very few wooden canoes  -
-
 a
 
couple made of laminated wooden hulls were there.
 He said he took
 
photos.
 
I went into Ft.  Kent and washed cloths at Dinah's,  located across
 
the street from the Fort Kent Hotel.  The washers and dryers each
 
cost $1.25/load!
 I began to complain to a woman folding cloths who
 
turned out to be Dinah.
 She immediately straightened me out.
 The
 
electric service to the Valley is apparently very expensive.
 She
 
has  raised her prices  according to the rate  increases  they have
 
experienced.  The washateria is very clean.
 Dinah also rents video
 
tapes.
 Most of the tapes for rent are childrens programs.
 Dinah
 
also  sells  knitted goods  -
-
 mittens,  knit  socks,  "des  pichous,"
 
which are knitted house slippers.
 Some of the mittens are sold as
 
hunter's mittens.
 These have forefinger (shooting finger)  as well
 
as  thumb  seperated  from  the  otherwise  mitten  shape.
 Dinah's
 
mother-in-law  knits  these  items.
 Dinah  is  helping  her  out  by
 
offering them for sale.
 
Whitman, Ornstein and I met back at the Eagle Lake camp and set out
 
together to record the Poor Poor Woodsman band at the Brass Lantern
 
Tavern in the Fort Kent Hotel.
 I met Rudy Daigle,  the proprietor
 
of  the  hotel  to  ask  him  permission  to  set  up  the  recording
 
equipment.
 He was very nice.
 He and his wife do the cooking at
 
the Hotel.
 He said that doing his own cooking is the only way to
 
make it work.
 His prices are very reasonable and the quality and
 
quantity of the Hotel's food is highly acclaimed by locals.
 John
 
Brown spoke highly of this place when we first met him.
 Rudy said
 
that he gets none of his food from Canada.
 His seafood comes from
 
downstate Maine.
 
We then sought the band leader to obtain permission to record.
 We
 
met  with  Sam  Oakes  and  his  party  who  were  eating  before  their
 
performance.
 Met Sam's wife Marie Voisine Oakes.

Sam was born April 28,  1948 at the hospital in Edmunston.
 He was
 
raised at Conners,  New Brunswick.
 His  father,  Hector Oakes,  and
 
his mother were both good musicians and singers.
 Sam said that his
 
grandmother was a legendary musician and that his uncles were all
 
musicians.
 He talked about his brother, Merrill, who lives around
 
Conners,  as an excellent musician.
 Sam and Marie invited us over
 
to their house tommorrow for a family gathering.
 
Began recording at 8:35 PM at the Brass Lantern.
 
Poor Poor Woodman Band:
 
Sam Oakes -
-
 Fiddle,  steel guitar  [double-neck],  singer
 
Harold Jackson -
-
 band leader,  electrified acoustic,  singer
 
 
 
-
-
 electified acoustic,  some lead guitar work,  singer
 
 
 
-
-
 electric keyboard,  rythym machine
 
The  band  is  dressed  in  costume:
 red  shirts,  white  ties,  white
 
cowboy hats,
 
When the band started there were about 20 in audience.
 Estimated
 
ages:  10  (40-50);  6  (over  50);  4  (30-40).
 Six  more  from  the
 
younger  group  came  in  around  9:15  and  other  trickled  in  as  the
 
night progressed.  The bar area increased in number as well.
 21-30
 
age group was better represented in the bar area than the dancing
 
area.
 
Repertoire  is mostly country and western.
 They played "Roll Out
 
the Barrel" and three couples danced the German polka -
-
 two of the
 
couples were women only.
 When the band played "Tennessee Flattop
 
Box"  several people began to jig dance.
 One small man around 45
 
(
7)  was step dancing fairly well.
 Sam's wife,  Marie,  was one of
 
the  step  dancers.
 She  did  a step  that  would  go  well  with  the
 
jitterbug.
 No  waltz  was  played  while  we  were  there.
 When  I
 
requested a waltz  of Harold Jackson,  he asked me if "Faded Love"
 
would  be  alright  .
.
.
 "Faded  Love,"  of  course,  is  not  a waltz.
 
"Diggy Diggy Li,  Dlggy Diggy Lo" was requested from the audience.
 
Sam did  a very  good  job with  it.
 Sam played  "Jolie  Blonde"  as
 
well.
 He is very taken with Cajun music.
 
Baby powder was sprinkled on the dance floor.  The sprinkler called
 
it "poudre a
 danser."
 
Sam plays without the use of his middle finger -
-
 he hurt it in a
 
wood  cutters  accident.
 Sam  and Harold  Jackson have  been  in the
 
Maine  Touring  Program  but  they  do  not  receive  many  requests  to
 
travel.
 
We parted around 9:45  in order to go to the St.  John club called
 
The American Dream which is operated by a Mr.  Pelletier.
 This is
 
a fairly new club with a very nice dance floor.
 The Nadeau Family
 
was playing.
 The crowd was a well-mixed family scene.
 There were
 
more of the 21-30 group here.
 The music was  load.
 The beer was
 
very expensive.
 The music was well-performed but not traditional.
 
We  decided  not  to  record  this  commercial  pop/  soft  rock  stuff.
 
During the break we overheard the band leader telling some of his
 
fans that "you can play anywhere if you can play a little rock and
 
roll."

Coworker:  Ornstein,  Lisa; Whitman,  David
 
Site:  Farm house of Ethel and the late Joseph A.  Gagnon of Eagle
 
Lake,  few hundred feet north of Catholic church on Hwy 11.
 
We  visited  the  home  of  Mrs.  Ethel  Gagnon  of  Eagle  Lake.
 The
 
property is on the west side of Hwy 11 about 300 feet south of an
 
appartment building with adjoining washerteria and a few hundred
 
feet  north  of  a Catholic  church.
 Whitman  had  stopped  by  the
 
property yesterday when he niticed that an old barn was being razed
 
there.
 According to Whitman,  the men razing the barn were having
 
a hard  time  of  getting  the  roof  to  fall  because  the  structural
 
timbers were so well joined.
 However,  when Whitman,  Ornstein and
 
I arrived on Sunday morning, the roof and all walls were collapsed.
 
After admiring the heavy hewn sills  for a while,  an elderly lady
 
came out of the nearby house to put away some of her garbage.
 I
 
startled her as I approached to introduce myself and explain why we
 
were crawling around the remains of her barn.
 She was very nice to
 
us and seemed to need to talk.
 Ethel Gagnon's husband,  Joseph A.
 
Gagnon (b.5/9/1898), had recently passed away  on 5/13/91.  He died
 
at the age of 93 with an obstructed esophagus!
 Ethel was born five
 
years  after  Joseph  (1903).
 Ethel's  father  had  come  over  from
 
England  to  marry  her  mother.
 Ethel's  father  never  became  very
 
proficient in French.
 Ethel easily understands the French I speak
 
but she seems to be more comfortable in English.
 Married on July
 
25,  1927, they had enjoyed almost 64 years together.
 The old lady
 
seemed to be quite lost.
 She invited us into her house and showed
 
us photos of all of the family.
 She nearly broke down at several
 
points.
 
The house and the barn had been part of Joseph Gagnon's  father's
 
farm.
 The elder Gagnon had provided the land south of the house
 
for the Catholic church.
 The Gagnon's had farmed potatoes,  oats,
 
hay, and kept a few milk cows.
 The house deserves more attention.
 
It  is  very  nicely  kept  -
-
 could  be  built  of  logs,  or  heavy
 
transverse planks  (madrier)  -
-
 however,  if  it was built like the
 
outbuilding directly behind it,  which perfectly mimics its style,
 
it was probably built of  balloon  frame.
 Like many of the older
 
houses,  this  one  has  Greek  rivival  cornices.
 The  roof  line
 
indicates a number of additions.
 Apparently,  the  first addition
 
was  lateral,
 or  parallel  to  the  road.
 The  front  porch  was
 
subsequently expanded.
 It looks like the original house had only
 
one downstairs room.
 We did not go upstairs.
 
The barn had been a simple-gabled structure.
 The gable faced the
 
road.
 The  barn was  within  40  feet  of  the  house.
 The  barn  had
 
a place to store feed and hay.
 The barn had a central open area
 
with  stables  or  storage  compartments  on  either

Informant/Event:  Cyr,  Don
 
Coworker:  Whitman,  David
 
Site:  Notre Dame de Mont Carmel,  Lille
 
July 3,  1991
 Whitman and Brassieur to Lille
 
We visited with Don Cyr in Lille this morning.
 We began by touring
 
the presbytere where Cyr lives.
 He has a tremendous collection of
 
furniture,
 especially
 Acadian
 furniture,
 and
 an
 incredible
 
collection of religious materials.  In terms of religious articles,
 
for instance, he has a set of miniature alter furnishings that were
 
sold during the late 19th and 20th centuries as toys with which to
 
train youngsters  for the priesthood.
 There are toy chalices and
 
monstrances and candles that would be used to set up a toy alter so
 
that  the  child  could  "play  mass."
 Cyr  also  has  full-size
 
monstrances,  priests'  vestments,  chalices,  tabernacles,  candle
 
holders,  and  many,  many  religious  articles  that  deserve  to  be
 
cataloged and documented.
 
Cyr also has a tremendous textile collection.
 A few of the items
 
appear to be the products of Jaccard looms  (mid-19th century)  but
 
much of his collection was produced on the typical two- or four-
harness counter-march looms of the Acadians.  He has armoirs filled
 
with linnen and wool blankets,  sheets,  and bed covers.
 He has one
 
man's smock of hand-woven and hand-sewn linen that may come from
 
the  early  19th  century  or  before.
 He  also  has  an  amazing
 
collection of lace work and tatting that he has assembled from the
 
region.
 He  said  that  informants  told  him  that  the  nuns  would
 
punish girls by making them do needle work.
 It is no wonder that
 
needlework is rare today.
 Even though it is rare,  and despite the
 
long hours required to produce it, needlework sells for very little
 
money at  flea markets.
 It  is not highly valued  in the  St.  John
 
Valley.
 
Cyr  has  a number  of  pieces  of  furniture  that  show  the  hallmark
 
indications  I have  learned  in Louisiana to recognize as Acadian.
 
These hallmark characteristics include:
 
1
)  raised-panel doors with the often uneven, beveled  (raised)  side
 
of the panel placed inside of the door with a smooth planed or sawn
 
surface  (unraised side)  to the outside;
 
2)  raised-panel  doors  flawlessly  joined  by  mortise  and  tenons
 
wherein the tenon rides in through-cut mortises;
 
3
)  tenons are held in place by two wooden pegs at each joint;
 
4)  predominance  of  short  pieces,  whether  armoires,  armoirettes,
 
chests of drawers,  garde-mangers,  buffets,  etc.;
 
5)  simple curved trim between the front two feet of the piece;
 
6
)  painted surfaces often red -
-
 called qros rouqe in Louisiana/
 
sang de boeuf in St.  Jean Valley;
 
7)  use of local soft woods -
-
 cypress and pine in Louisiana/ pine
 
and ceder  in  St.  John valley  -
-
 rarely  in  combination with
 
hardwoods;
 
8
)  older  drawers  or  chests  are  joined  with  very  small,  widely-
spaced, hand-cut dovetails many of which have been tightened by the
 
addition of thin wooden shims or wedges.
 
While it is true that many of these features are characteristic of
 
18th  century  country  cabinet  making  in  general,  together  they
 
represent a pattern of features often selected by Acadian joiners
 
or menuisers. 
When all or most of these features occur on the same
 
St.  John Valley piece,  and Mr.  Cyr has numerous  pieces  in which
 
they do,  the piece was very likely built by an Acadian or someone
 
learned  in traditional Acadian cabinetry and joinery.
 Furniture
 
bearing these characteristics in Louisiana appears to be  distinct
 
from other colonial or early  19th century Louisiana furniture  in
 
the same way that St.  John Valley Acadian furniture appears to be
 
distinct from contemporary pieces made  in Quebec or elsewhere  in
 
New France.
 
Many features  that represent this Acadian pattern were evidently
 
carried forth throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century
 
in  the  St.  John  Valley.
 The  same  can  be  said  about  Louisiana
 
Acadian furniture.  In trying to understand the conservative nature
 
of  Acadian  furniture production we  should keep  these  factors  in
 
mind: 1
) many Acadians were highly skilled in woodworking, joinery,
 
and cabinetmaking; and 2
)  these skills were often passed down from
 
grandfather to grandson.
 It was the grandparents who often had the
 
best opportunity to pass traditional ways on to the young folks.
 
The parent generation were very busy  in taking  advantage  of  the
 
most  productive  period  of  their  lives.
 The  grandparents  often
 
cared for the children while parents worked away from the house.
 
Naturally,  the grandparents passed on value systems and knowledge
 
that was current in the peak production years of their generation
 
[see The Horse of Pride for good examples of traditional learning
 
among the Celts of French Brittany].
 
We also noted that the angels that originally sat atop the dome of
 
Notre  Dame  de  Carmel  are  presently  in  the  living  room  of  Cyr's
 
presbytere.
 They are carved of pine and covered with a tin/lead
 
alloy  developed  by  the  master  sculptor  Louis  Jobin  of  Quebec.
 
Jobin  (b.10/26/1845;  d.3/ll/1928)  lived  in  Ste-Anne  de  Beaupre,
 
Quebec.
 He was  very active as  a sculptor between  1860  and  1918

Instead,  D.  Cyr  commissioned  Glen  Hines  of  Holton  to  produce
 
replicas cast of polymer cement which will be put into place on the
 
structurally reinforced dome.
 The valuable Jobin pieces will be
 
put on display somewhere in the church.
 
After we had visited through the presbytere,  Cyr opened the church
 
so  that  we  could  take  photos  and  note  some  of  the  stunning
 
materials contained therein.
 The quantity,  variety,  and quality
 
(with  respect  to  both  historical  and  monitary  value)
 of  the
 
materials  contained  in  Notre  Dame  de  Mt.
 Carmel  can  not  be
 
overestimated.
 The church had its  last services  in 1978 when it
 
was  closed  because  of  the  dramatic  loss  in  population
 (Cyr
 
estimates  80-%  loss)  that  occurred  in  the  Lille  area  after  the
 
close  of  large  saw  mills  in  Keegan  and  vicinity.
 A  serious
 
confrontation  developed  between  parishioners  and  the  diocesene
 
power  structure  based  in  Boston.
 A  court  battle  resulted  in
 
victory for the Irish biship from Boston.
 But,  assured of  legal
 
authority to condemn and destroy the church,  the bishop realized
 
that this would as Cyr said,  "rub salt in the wounds" of the former
 
parishoners.
 Cyr offered him a way out of the delima by purchasing
 
the church and presbytere  for  $1.00 with the  intentions  that  it
 
would be restored.
 Much work has been accomplished by Cyr and his
 
L'  Association  Culturel  et Historique  de Mont  Carmel.
 There  is
 
very much work remaining.
 
The N.D. de Mont Cannel Church is a significant property because of
 
its  design  (Cyr  has  reproductions  of  the  original  plans);  its
 
external and internal combination of Romanesque, Greek,  and Gothic
 
characteristics; its construction materials, especially the work in
 
pine and ceder, but also the pressed sheet metal fleurs de u s wall
 
covering;
 its  artistic  painted  embellishments,
 including  the
 
marbleized wooden interior Corinthian columns;  and much more.
 
The religious materials housed in the church are very important and
 
deserve  complete  documentation  and  conservation.
 The  statuary
 
here,  for instance, perhaps common in a century-old church in this
 
region,  will  likely never again be duplicated by post-Vatican II
 
churches.
 Statues  include  the cult  statue of  Our Lady of Mount
 
Carmel;  St.  Antoine;  St.  Christopher;  Ste.  Theresa of Avila;  Ste.
 
Anne;  St.  Joseph;  The Sacred Heart of Jesus;  the Crucifixion,  two
 
angels;  full-size  figures  of  each of  the  twelve  apostles which,
 
according to Cyr,  were nicely painted in 1960 by Roy Macaully of
 
Montreal; as well as a great number of smaller religious statues.
 
In addition to statuary,  the church contains a wide assortment of
 
religious  items  like  candles  -
-
 votive,  Easter,  Last Rites,  and
 
others -
-
 pews,  alter dressings, colorful religious banners, alter
 
stones, reliquaries, several tabernacles, several monstrances, and
 
a variety  of  furniture  designed  to  facilitate  certain  religious
 
functions.
 Most  of  these  items  are  particularly  significant  to
 
this location because of the following reasons:
 
1
)  the  workmanship  in  every  medium  represents  either  the  best
 
craftsmanship and artistry in the region or the best materials
 
and work that the church could import;
 
2
)
 since
 Vatican
 II
 completely
 reorganized
 Catholic
 ritual
 
beginning
 in
 the
 1960s,
 many
 religious
 materials
 and
 
ceremonial  items  that  fill  this  church will  never  again  be
 
manufactured or used;

through oral historical methods.
 
Next to the vestiare in the sacristy is a holy water font made of
 
wood with an internal metal water storage tank.
 On the outside of
 
the elaborate font is the prayer:
 
ORATIONES
 
Cum Lavat Manus,  dicat:
 
Da,  Domine,  Virtutem manibus neis
 
ad abstergendam omnem macu -  
lam:  ut sine pollutione mentis et
 
corporis valeam tibi servire.
 
Holy water  is  very  important to  the  French  catholics  of  the  St.
 
John Valley.
 Don Cyr mentioned that his grandfather, Fred a
 Basile
 
Albert from St-Hilaire,  would say that when there was a bad storm
 
and thunder,  it would be raining harder inside than outside.
 Cyr
 
told us about L'Eau Pacque.
 At the first ray of  light on Easter
 
Sunday  water  is  collected  from  a spring.
 This  water  is  then
 
brought to a priest to be blessed.
 This water  is very powerful
 
Holy Water and it will never go stale.
 
We left the church with Cyr in conversation with visitors and ex-
parishioners who had stopped by to reminisce about the church.
 I
 
measured some of the pieces on the Violette house stacked in back
 
of Cyr's presbytere.
 The pieces that were placed horizontally to
 
form the walls of the building are 9" x 5 1/4" sawn pieces.
 They
 
were  flush-joined  in  the  corners  in  an  overlapping  manner  and
 
trunneled into place.  The trunnel holes were drilled though the 9"
 
dimension  of  the  piece  and  a 1 1/4"  trunnel  was  placed  on  each
 
opening of the hole  (both top and bottom of the horizontally fit
 
piece.
 There were two trunnels at each corner placed at 2 1/4" and
 
9 1/2" respectively from the end of the piece.
 The two trunnels
 
were set 7 1/4" apart.
 In addition to the two trunnels placed at
 
the end of each piece,  trunnels were also placed at intervals 5'
 
and 6' apart to steady the construction.
 One trunnel was measured
 
to be  6"  long.
 The trunnels  are made of pine  -
-
 the pieces  are
 
made of ceder.
 The ship's knees are made of oak.
 
Cyr also took us  to see the attock in the presbytere.
 It  is  so
 
jambed tight with artifacts that we could not easily appraise the
 
contents.
 Cyr  must  have  the  largest  collection  of  Acadian
 
ladderback chairs and rockers in the world.  He has pieces of looms
 
and spinning wheels, cabinet doors,  corner cabinets, architectural
 
pieces,  and who knows what.
 
We ate lunch at a hotel in Van Buren directly across Hwy 1 from the
 
Val Violette house.
 The special was potato fricasse and plouges.
 
The  fricasse  did  not  have  a  roux  base  though  otherwise  it
 
resembeled  my  mother's  fricasse.
 There  was  beef  as  well  as
 
potatoes in the fricasse.
 The plouges were made with buttermilk;
 
they resembeled buckwheat crepes.
 Very good.

Site:  At the home of Camille  Devost,  two houses  above  church  in
 
Lille,  Me.
 
After lunch with Don Cyr at Brookside Motel Restaurant in Van Buren
 
we returned to Lille to see more of his collection.  After visiting
 
Cyr's attic,  he bagan talking about a house nearby which had been
 
insulated with birch bark and was one of the oldest houses in the

red exterior ceder shingles are well painted.
 
In telling us the history of this house,  Camille Devost said that
 
his great grandfather, his grandfather, his father,  and he himself
 
have all been carpenters.

 Camille Devost -
-
 b.  1918 and raised in Ste.  Anne de Madawaska
 
Camille said that his uncles, Raymond and Fred Devost were the best
 
gigue dancers around.
 
Camille courted Christine Bellefleur who lived in Lille.  Christine
 
was an orphan raised by Ouellette family.
 He moved to Lille from
 
Ste.
 Anne  when  he  married  Christine  53  years  ago.
 She  is
 
approximately same age as Camille.
 She said that the Bellefleur
 
family came from Québec but that her mother had died young.
 Since
 
the Ouelette family could have no children,  she was raised as an
 
only child.
 She said she was spoiled and had more things than many
 
of the children she grew up with.
 
Camille had only an 8th grade education.
 Worked as a farmer for 26
 
years;  worked  for  Lane  Construction  from  Presque  Isle  building
 
roads for 26 years.
 Now he is retired and works in his garden.
 
Camille produces 100 barrels of potatoes from the 1/2 acre he has
 
planted.
 He  cuts his potato  seed  "dans  le cresent"  of the moon
 
(new moon).
 He plant "dans le decord"  (waning moon) .
 He said that
 
the potatoes could be harvested anytime.
 
I asked Camille if he had ever heard talk of a crooked knife.
 He
 
said  "shure,  he  still  uses  them."
 He  showed  Dave  and  I how he
 
carves  axe  handles.
 He  has  about  cherry  200  handles  in  his
 
basement.
 He also showed me how he sets wire snares for rabbits.

Informant/Event:  Eagle lake on 4th of July;  Roy,  Pat
 
Coworker:  Whitman,  David
 
Site:  Old Mill Marina on Eagle Lake
 
Whitman and I worked on notes early during the day.
 About 2:00 PM
 
we took a ride to Eagle lake to see what action we would find at
 
the marina and public beach on the 4th of July.
 
We stopped at the house of Pat Roy in Eagle Lake.
 Mr. Roy lives in
 
a mobile home with a built on garage on the west  side of Hwy  11
 
across from The Hunter's Inn.
 He had a "garage sale"  sign up on
 
the 4th of July so we stopped in to see him.
 He had an assortment
 
of carpenter, mechanic,  and pipefitters tools for sale.
 They were
 
not particularly cheap.
 He also ties flies and he has a trout pond
 
behind his house.
 I noticed by the way that Mr.  Roy responded to
 
questions that he was depressed.  We later found that Mr. Roy leans
 
toward the manic side of depression.
 
Whitman  wanted  to  buy  some  fishing  flies  from  mr.  Roy  who  was
 
selling them for $.75 apiece.
 In response to Whitman's questions
 
concerning the names of the flies that
. he had tied,  Roy lost his
 
temper.
 He  accused  Whitman  of  pushing  him.
 He  said  he  could
 
remember  all  the  names  when  he  was  younger  but  that  his  mind
 
doesn't work that fast anymore.
 He said he had taken orders for
 
thirty years down in Massachusettes where he had worked for General
 
Motors.
 He said that he wasn't taking no more orders from anyone.
 
He seemed to calm down a bit when he saw that Whitman was going to
 
buy some of his flies.
 I felt. however, that Mr. Roy was always on
 
edge.
 He was chewing tobacco and the tobacco spit dribbled down
 
his chin.
 He said he waned to sell all of his tools so he could
 
put his car  in his garage  and be  free to take trips to Florida.
 
And yet this man has the patience to tie flies!
 His most popular
 
one was the "black fly."  He also carves axe handles.
 When I asked
 
him about the crooked knife he said that this was an old tool that
 
he used at one time but that he uses other tools now.
 He showed us
 
his factory-made spoke shave and small smoothing plane.
 
Nothing much was happening at the marina.
 It  is  called the Old
 
Mill Marina because it was once,  over 18 years ago,  the site of a
 
hardwood  mill.
 The  mill  once  specialized  in  bowling  pins  and
 
toothpicks.
 The  restaurant  is  opened  for  breakfast  only  on
 
weekends  because  the  management  can  not  find  a  cook  to  work
 
steadily.
 Judging  by  the  relatively  few  customers
 in  the
 
restaurant on July 4th,  it seems that the problem may also be that
 
they have difficulty attracting clientel.  The menu had no regional
 
traditional  fare  except  for  haddock  and  salmon.
 The  prices
 
indicate  that  this  restaurant  caters  to  the  wealthier  diners.
 
There  was  no  personnel  at  the  registration  desk  for  the  Marina
 
Hotel.
 In order to get a room you must call  a phone number and
 
someone will come down to give you a key.
 This lack of personnel
 
suggested that they were not expecting a big surge of visitors for
 
the  4th  of  July weekend.
 In  fact,  the marina  looked  bare  this
 
afternoon.
 There  was  one  excursion  boat,
 a  large  outboard-
motorized pontoon boat, that rents for $60.00/hour that was pulling
 
away from the dock.
 There must have been at least fifteen people
 
aboard.
 They  had  evidently  crowded  aboard  so  as  to  reduce  the
 
individual cost of the excursion.
 We found that the marina also
 
rents boats.
 They have an alluminum "fishing boat" that rents for
 
$50/day.  [We  can  buy  a used  boat  like  this  in  town  for  around
 
$100.] The fellow we talked to was working on the inboard motor of
 
a speed boat.
 He was unfamiliar with the term skiff.
 The fishing
 
boat he was refering to was a skiff.
 In fact,  all of the fishing
 
boats I have seen on these lakes and rivers are either alluminum
 
skiffs or fiberglass canoes.
 I have seen no flatboats or jon boats
 
or any wooden boats as of yet.
 
There are some army surplus tents set up at the public beach.
 They
 
are not in use today.
 We learned that they are for the church fair
 
that is planned for the coming weekend.
 A beauty pageant is to be
 
held on Friday,  July 5.

Informant/Event:  Lavertu Family Reunion
 
Coworker:  Whitman,  David
 
Site:  Lavertu  Settlement  south  of  Madawaska  on  the  property  of
 
Gerald Lavertu.
 
Talked with Lisa on the phone about her interview with Mr.  Bosse
 
from New Brunswick.
 She was given many good leads on Canadian side
 
but not many on Maine side.
 
Yvon Theriault
  
Whitman and I set off to the Lavertu family reunion.
 We stopped on
 
South Perly Brook Road several miles east of Ft. Kent at the house
 
of Yvon Theriault.
 Mr. Theriault had a "garage sale" sign out and
 
an open garage.
 He lives in a ranch home with stone masonry vaneer
 
around the bottom 1/3 of house.
 He lives across the street from a
 
large farm house marked Box 1550 on mailbox.
 Mr.  Theriault's box
 
# is unmarked.
 Phone -
-
 (207)  834-5628.
 
Mr.  Yvon  Theriault  is  a retired  carpenter  (
72  years  old)  whose
 
father  and  grandfather  were  also  carpenters.
 Mr.  Theriault's
 
grandfather  camr  from  the  Canadian  town  of  St.  Quintin.
 Mr.
 
Theriault's  father  built  the  farm house  across  the  street  about
 
1914.
 It is built of sawn studs  (ballon)  but otherwise looks like
 
other  local Greek Revival  farm houses  of  the  19th  century.
 The
 
difference between these houses and the ones that Marshall and I
 
surveyed from the mid-19th century is that the rez-de-chaussez is
 
taller in these later models.
 In other words,  the roof is not as
 
low to the ground.
 Also, the later models seem to be more squarish
 
is floorplan.
 
Mr.  Theriault  is  also  a mason.
 He  gathered  the  multi-colored
 
stones he used on his house and also the ones he used to build a
 
barbeque pit on the side of his house.
 He buys antiques and junk
 
and sells them at his garage sale.
 I got the idea that this was a
 
steady part time job for this retired carpenter.
 He said that it
 
is much harder to sell antiques now than it was several years back.
 
He showed us a rake with long wooden tines that was used to rake
 
the cut buckwheat into piles.
 This rake was evidently the product
 
of automated manufacture though it could have been locally made for
 
the buckwheat harvest.
 He also showed us a blueberry scoop about
 
14" wide.
 The metal tines of this scoop have been set with lead
 
into the metal handle.
 It is quite heavy.
 It would scoop several
 
quarts of blueberries at each pass.
 It was likely made locally by
 
a whitesmith or tin worker.
 
Rosette's
  
We finally made it to Rosette's in Frenchville after driving on a
 
number of dead end farm roads east of Ft. Kent.
 Whitman took some
 
photos of potato fields but no one seems to be working on this day
 
after the 4th.
 
Rosette's was  buzzing at  1:40  PM when we arrived.
 There were a
 
number  of  large  family groups  dining.
 It was  apparent  from the
 
conversations that there were many from the Canadian side.
 After
 
we ate Whitman and I took some photos of the Connecticut licences
 
on automobiles in Rosette's parking lot.  More than 1/2 of the cars
 
parked there were from Connecticut.
 
Lavertu 
Whitman photographed a young man working with a tractor in a potato
 
field  in the  Lavertu  settlement.
 This  fellow was  applying  some
 
chemical to four or so rows of potatoes at a time.
 The ground is
 
very dry from lack of rain and the chemical spray and the tractor
 
wheels  were  stirring  the  dust  considerably.
 The  young  farmer
 
should be wearing a mask -
-
 so should we.
 
The  Lavertu  family  reunion  was  held  on  the  property  of  Gerald
 
Lavertu.  A large Quonset-type potato house has been commandered as
 
a hall.
 Out  side  of  the  hall,  Gerald  was  setting  up  horseshoe
 
stakes when we  arrived.
 There  is  a volleyball  game  in progress
 
nearby.
 Nearly everyone is wearing t-shirts with the Lavertu name
 
and coat-of-arms.
 The t-shirts are day-glow pink,  red,  or orange.
 
There are also many wearing baseball caps with the Lavertu emblems.
 
The caps are brightly colored like the shirts.
 There is a large
 
barbeque pit  smoking near the  entrance to the hail.
 The pit  is
 
made of a large, oval-shaped fuel tank that has been sawn lenghwise
 
in half and attached by hinges and set upon steel  legs.
 This pit
 
is roasting a young pig which has been split in two.
 
Cathy Corey had allerted Gerald Lavertu of our visit and he greeted
 
us very nicely.
 Met Edgar Lavertu,  the brother of Gerald.
 Edgar
 
works with computors for the Unsis(?) Comp.in Bristol, Connecticut.
 
Gerald and Edgar have on name tags that indicate their name on the
 
top line and the name "O'neil" on the bottom line.
 O'neil is there
 
father.
 Everyone at the reunion has on these name tags.
 Those in
 
the  Lavertu  family  have  their  father's  or  mother's  name  on  the
 
second line.
 Inlaws have the names of their spouses on the second
 
line.
 This seems to aid in communication.
 There is certainly an
 
air of easy friendliness and fun at this party.
 One of the men is
 
perpetually pulling a wagonload of children with a small Farmall
 
tractor.
 The  children  seem  to  enjoy  their  tour  of  the  Lavertu
 
settlement and farms.  Many of these children are likely from urban
 
areas  in  Connecticut.
 Some  have  come  from  as  far  away  as
 
California.
 
I learned that the house with the incised porch facing the Lavertu
 
Settiemant Road,  the one that looks so much like galleried houses
 
in Louisiana  and Missouri,  was  built  in  1950  by  Ernest  Lavertu.
 
None of the houses with incised galleries in Lavertu are older than
 
this one.
 
They bring James  (Jim)  Lavertu to meet me.
 Jim,  or "June," as he
 
is  sometimes  called,  is  an  attorney  in Madawaska  and the  family
 
historian.  He is writing a book about the family.
 Edourd was the
 
first  to establish Lavertu.
 He was born  9/17/1873  and moved to
 
this  part  of Maine while he  was  in his  early  20s.
 I met Vicki
 
Leveque Lavertu who is a travel agent trying to put together a tour
 
of Louisiana for the fall of this year.
 
I asked Edgar Lavertu about his neighborhood in Bristol.
 He said
 
that there were probably 10-20% French people in his neighborhood.
 
He said that the French people would live together in neighborhoods
 
when  they  first  moved  there  but  that,  as  they made  and  saved a
 
little  money,  they  would  eventually  buy  better  houses  to  their
 
liking and would thus scatter out in the city.
 He said that the
 
first  neighborhood  which  was  almost  completely  French  is  now
 
inhabited by Puerto Ricans.
 He said that there is French music in
 
Bristol.  Edgar's father-in--law, Theodule Martin, from Ste-Anne-de-
Madawaska,  was a famous fiddler in Bristol.
 
Inside the potato house/hall, not far from the entrance and against
 
one of the curving walls,  a stage was set up.
 At intervals,  two
 
teenage boys would mount the stage and provide music.
 One played
 
keyboards.
 He had two electric keyboards set up  in tandum.
 The
 
other teenager had a full trap set.
 They would play the corniest
 
selection of pop at high amplification on their keyboard and drum
 
set up.  They did not sing.
 They had great difficulty keeping time
 
together.
 When they played,  it was very difficult to converse in
 
the hall.
 These two kids were the ones who played the National
 
Anthem at the unveiling of the Lavertu monument  later  (see taped
 
documentation of unveiling ceremony).
 
This stage was also used by the master-of-ceremonies who was Donald
 
Lavertu of California.
 Donald a
 Lionel was wearing, a large white
 
straw  cowboy  hat  and  he  seemed  to  be  leading  most  of  the
 
proceedings.
 Donald organized the meal,  for instance.
 The hall
 
held  around  200  Lavertus  and  they would  serve  themselves  buffet
 
style two tables at a time.
 The serving was orderly..
 Also served
 
potato  salad,  baked  beans,  tossed  salad,  coleslaw,  and macaroni
 
salad.
 They  ran  out  of  roast  pig  and  soda  pop  before  all  were
 
served.
 During the meal,  Donald Lavertu mounted the stage to make
 
some announcements.
 He brought a young girl  (five?)  up on stage
 
and had her to sing a long French children's song.
 She did a great
 
job but we could not hear the words from where we had sat to eat at
 
the far end of the hall.
 This performance was heartily greeted by
 
the Lavertu family who seemed to cherish the continuation of French
 
among at least some of the younger kids.
 
Tables  full  of  crafts  were  also  set  up  against  the wall  of  the
 
hail.  A hand-quilted bedspread, numerous pieces of knitted afgans,
 
and blankets, some knitted "pichous" slippers, a variety of ceramic
 
ware  (one in the form of a potato),  and some plastic jugs of maple
 
syrup  marked  "Lavertu  Sugar  Camp,  108  St.  David,  04773,"  were
 
assembled  on  tables.
 These  items  had  been  made  and  donated  by
 
Lavertu  family  members  for  the  raffle.
 Raffle  tickets  were  on
 
sale.
 
There was also a concession area set up inside the hall.
 Lavertu
 
t-shirts,  caps,  and cookbooks were for sale.
 I bought one of the
 
cookbooks for  $5.00.
 It has a variety of traditional and modern
 
recipies from family members in Maine and all over the continent.
 
We  had  heard  from  Cathy  Corey  that  the  buffet  meal  would  cost
 
$12.00/person.
 Jim Lavertu,  however,  insisted that we eat free.
 
After the meal,  the entire family paraded down to the side of the
 
Lavertu Settlement Road for the unveiling of the monument.
 I was
 
able to tape the ceremony which included  introductions by Donald
 
Lavertu,  a speech concerning Lavertu history by Jim Lavertu who is
 
presently  writing  a book  on  the  topic,  and  a blessing  by  the
 
priest.
 I got some interesting information from Jim Lavertu and
 
others  on tape  during and  after this  ceremony.
 The two teenage
 
boys who were playing organ and drums inside the hall were asked to
 
play the National Anthem.
 They did  so on bugles.
 Et puis,  ils
 
sont bugle,  ouil
 
We found that seven blue spruces had been planted at the memorial.
 
Two of  them were  for Memere  and Pepere  (Edourd Lavertu and Anne
 
Doucett Lavertu)  and five were for their children.
 One child had
 
been left out -
-
 a young girl who had been married and had died as
 
a result of a tubular pregnancy.
 Though she had apparently lived
 
to child-bearing age,  she was  left out.
 No tree was planted for
 
someone who  produced no  offspring  even though  she had given her
 
life trying.
 
I met  and  talked  with  the  owner  of  Morin  Electric  -
-
 Licensed
 
Electrical Contractor -
-
 David Morin;  P.O.Box 87;  Madawaska,  Me.
 
04756;  (
207)  728-7987.
 David Morin's mother is a Lavertu.
 David
 
and Jim talked about how it was growing up.
 David had come from
 
Lavertu,  "les consessions," while Jim had grown up in Madawaska and
 
Edmunston.
 David recalled how the youngsters  fro  les consession
 
were ridiculed for having cow shit on their boots and because they
 
always smelled like a barnyard.
 David said he would try to wash
 
the smell off but it was impossible to remove all of the odor that
 
resulted  from  handling  and  milking  cows  each  morning.
 Jim  and
 
David M.  told me about the Canadian potato pickers that would be
 
brought  in  for harvest.
 A large red barn near the monument has
 
living space  on the  second  floor that  was  used  by these migrant
 
workers.
 
I also met one of Gerald's and Edgar's younger brothers.
 He was
 
married to a girl from Quebec.
 They live in Florida now but they
 
are raising their children to speak French.
 The young wife  from
 
Quebec insists that they speak French.
 They had recently been to
 
New orleans and were disappointed because they had not found anyone
 
speaking French.
 They were fans of Zachary Richard.
 
After the unvieling of the monument Jim L.  took us over to the log
 
house (Jim and others used the words "des pieces" as well as  logs)
 
of Gilman Caron (Box 106, St. David) which is located a few hundred
 
feet down the road from Gerald Lavertu's potato house/hall.  Gilman
 
was  sleeping  in a hammock behind his  old house when we arrived.
 
Gilman  was  born  in  1927  to  Philias  Caron  who  was  the  son  of
 
Epiphane Caron.
 Epiphane had built the house around the turn of
 
the 20th century.
 The house subsequently had a lateral addition
 
and garage added.
 The house was originally built on a spring head
 
(une  source).
 The  spring  head  was  boxed  in  with  logs  but  it
 
smelled pretty rank as though contaminated with sewage.
 The sills
 
of  the house  are ceder  logs  flattened on top.
 The walls  of the
 
house are built of sawn ceder pièces 10" x 3.5".
 From a piece that
 
had been removed when installing a sliding door, we could see that
 
the  i
nadrier  had  a short  tenon  cut  into  the  entire  edge  (tenon
 
deminsions are 1" x 1" x 10")  of one end of the piece.
 This tenon
 
may  have  fit  into  the  grooved  edge  of  a column  (en  coulisse).
 
Gilman could not help us with this.
 At age 43 Gilman had a heart
 
attact and open heart surgery.
 He has been out of work since.
 At
 
63 he gardens and relaxes around his house.
 He is a bit shakey in
 
most  categories  -
-
 not  a prime  informant  though  he  has  clearly
 
experienced the traditional life.
 
At any rate,  it is amazing that these pièces sur pieces houses were
 
being  built  as  late  as  the  turn  of  the  20th  century.
 The
 
construction and floorplan of this house deserves more study.
 
When we  returned  to  the  reunion we met  Adrien  Morin who,  until
 
fairly recently ran a stave mill and a cooperage business on the
 
Birchpoint Road on Lake Long.
 He said that we could call and come
 
by  to  visit
 thought  he
 barrel  business
 is
 not
 in  present
 
production.
 He said that he had given the business to his sons but
 
that they had found that it was too much work to keep going.
 He
 
said to call him to set an appointment -

Laplante's  camp  is  only two  doors  down  from our  camp  on Brown's
 
Point of Eagle Lake.
 
The birthday party was a veritable family reunion.
 There must have
 
been at least fifty people in attendence.
 Four of Margaret Brown's
 
brother-in-laws,  her  late husband's brothers,  were there.
 Their
 
had  been  seven  boys  and  five  girls  in  the  Brown  family  that
 
Margaret  married  into.
 Nearly  all  of  the  boys  had  moved  to
 
Connecticut during the Depression.  Several of them first worked in
 
the CCC camp at Princeton,  Maine before moving south.
 As one of
 
the elder brothers explained,  "the families in those days were so
 
large that there wasn't enough jobs  for everyone.
 We would have
 
starved  if  we  had  stayed."
 However,  all  of  these  brothers  had
 
moved back to the Eagle Lake area after retirement.
 
Margaret Brown was a school teacher.
 Phil  let us  in on a secret
 
about  living with  a school  teacher  during the mid-20th  century:
 
Mrs. Brown discouraged her children from speaking French.
 As late
 
as the 1940s there were many children that could not speak English.
 
Mrs. Brown evidently saw a great disadvantage in being monolingual
 
French so she did not encourage her children to speak French.  They
 
were educated  in English but they picked up French on the school
 
ground.
 They had to hide  from their mother to talk French with
 
their friends.
 They grew up with the idea that their French was
 
second rate and a source of embarassment.
 A number of the family
 
did quite well.
 Phil  is a computor programmer  in Portland,  John
 
sells insurance,  and so forth.
 
At the birthday party we met  
 Jalbert,  the son of the famous
 
wilderness guide,   
 Jalbert,  who has been deceased for nine
 
years.
 We met his widow,  ne Daigle,  as well.
 The son of Jalbert,
 
approx. 69 years old, was quite a character.  He had been raised in
 
Ft. Kent but had gone on many of his father's expeditions.
 He told
 
us  about  some  of  the  difficult  and  wet  times  without  food  and
 
warmth experienced as they camped out on the Allagash.
 He was a
 
bomber pilot during WWII flying 40 something missions over Europe.
 
3;!
 
After  the war he  became  an  electrical  engineer,  evidently  quite
 
successful.
 He has a summer cottage on Eagle Lake and a residence
 
in Richmond,  Virginia.
 He was very pleased to tell of his great
 
ski adventures to all of the posh resorts.
 
We met Mr.  George Fournier who  lives  on the north east shore  of
 
Eagle Lake.
 He is a retired postal worker who had travelled the
 
world,
 he could speak Spanish well because he had lived in Cuba
 
for a while during 1947.
 He had met Ernest Hemmingway.
 He drives
 
a Cadillac  that  once  belonged  to  Everette  Crosby,  the  business
 
manager for Bing Crosby.
 He is quite an eccentric.  He invited us
 
over to see some of his antiques.
 He also said he would take us by
 
to visit old man Mr. Andre Roy of Eagle Lake.
 He said that Mr. Roy
 
had changed his name from Voisin to Wizzin to Roy.
 He said that
 
the old man does not speak much English but that he knows plenty
 
about the old cures and plants that the Indians used to cure.
 G.
 
Fournier  has  a sailboat  of  the  Tinkerbell  (
?)  style  w/  Marconi
 
sail.
 He  is a decendent of the Fournier that built the house  in
 
St.  David where Geraldine Casse now resides.
 
Gearge Fournier's sister,  who lives on Brown Point on Eagle Lake,
 
was also at the party.
 She invited us over to visit.
 She seems to
 
be  very  bright  and  candid.
 At  one  point  she  was  joking  with
 
Jalbert about skinny dipping and how she couldn't recognize some of
 
the men with their cloths  on.
 She talked about the dance halls
 
that were around during her youth in Ft.  Kent.
 Jalbert confirmed
 
repeatedly that she had been one of the best jitterbuggers anywhere
 
around.
 She said that she had taught a number of boys to jitterbug
 
and that that was the craze when she was growing up.
 One of the
 
dance halls was the Silver Dollar.
 
Richard Laplante, about 42,  is an in-law to the Brown family.
 I am
 
not  sure who  his  wife  is  but  she had  inherited  land  on  Brown's
 
Point  and  she  and  Richard  had  decided  to  build while  they were
 
young enough to work to afford it.
 Richard has his own contract
 
logging business he operates from his home in Mapleton [764-0096].
 
He drives a souped-up orange 1967 Roadrunner and he is crazy about
 
60s and 70s rock music.
 He owns the neat 17' blue and white motor
 
boat with the 40hp outboard that is tied to the quai  in front of
 
his  camp.
 He  is  a good  friend  of  master  Micmac  carver  and
 
basketmaker Dave Sanipass of Chapman.
 He said we could call him
 
and he would be glad to take us to see the old man.
 He said that
 
it  is not advisible to go as  a stranger because we would  likely
 
never  find  the  place  and  because  of  Sanipass'  three  large  mean
 
German Shepherds.
 He also mentioned a skillful carver and weaver
 
named Shorty Lacombe who also lives in Mapleton.
 
There was a good bit of French spoken at this party -
-
 mostly by
 
the brother-in-laws of Margaret Brown.
 There was also a Pelletier
 
from Soldier's Pond who was much more comfortable in French than in
 
English.
 His  linguistic  mannerisms  reminded  me  much  of  Herman
 
Deperay.
 He  did  not  speak  when  the  conversation  was  English.
 
However,  he  was  a comic  and  a conversation  leader  in  French.
 
Soldiers  Pond  is  one  the  most  strongly  french  areas  we  have
 
visited.

Whitman and I rode out to the St. Mary's Church Fair which was held
 
at the public  beach near the Old Mill Marina on  Eagle Lake.
 We
 
arrived approx.  11:15 AN and there was very little going on at the
 
time.
 I bought a Family Recipes cookbook put out by St.  Mary's
 
Catholic Church  ($5.00)  and a blue and green wool knitted pair of
 
house  slippers
 (des  pichous)
 which  were  made  by  Mrs.
 Stella
 
Pelletier of Eagle Lake  ($5.00).
 The church ladies were selling
 
chances for a drawing for some religious wall plaques.
 There were
 
a number of  games  of chance  available.
 There was  not much  of  a
 
chance of winning any of these games.
 
As we  ate greasy  cheeseburgers  I found that  St.  Mary's  does  not
 
offer French masses though there are many French speakers.
 A
 
Mr.  Daigle who seemed to in charge of the affair,  and who Whitman
 
had met,  brought another of the organizers over to meet us.

They  raised  and  sheared  sheep  and  would  take  the  wool  to  the
 
carding mill in Frenchville which was in operation until the 1960s.
 
Ida would take the cartded wool and spin yarn which she would knit
 
into blankets and mittens and all sorts of wool wear.
 Beth makes
 
blood  sausage  or  boudin.
 She  made  some  boudin  lately when her
 
brother, Docite,  Jr., of Mars Hill buchered one of his hogs.
 Beth
 
said  that  the  recipe  can't  be  written  down  exactly  because  you
 
never know how much blood will be provided by the hog.
 She also
 
make cretan  "gerton"  and hoh head cheese.
 She submitted the hog
 
head cheese recipe that is in Family Recipes but she did not attach
 
her name to it because some people don't think highly of hog head
 
cheese.
 
Along with her older sister Violette "Vi"  Beth had a booth at the
 
church fair and they were selling "dough boys."
 She said that the
 
recipe comes through her mother from her grandmother so it must be
 
at least 100 years old.
 These "dough boys" are made of light risin
 
dough fried in grease.  The resemble biegnets made in the Louisiana
 
prairies but they are a little heavier and a bit more cake-like.
 
Beth and Vi were scheduled to make chicken stew today but they had
 
decided not to make any because they had made some yesterday and so
 
few people came to eat it [it rained on that day].
 However, while
 
we were talking to them at their booth,  people kept coming up and
 
asking  for  chicken  stew.
 A  number  of  people  were  really
 
disappointed not to  find the  stew.
 Some clamor  arose that  they
 
were going to have to cook  some.
 When we  left at  11:30 AN Beth
 
said that the stew would be ready to serve around 4:30 PM.
 This
 
precious stew has a light bouillon and rolled dumplings.
 
There is also a Mud Bog race being held at the Knights of Columbus
 
Hall  on Hwy  11  in  Eagle  Lake.
 Mr.  Daigle  said  that  the  trucks
 
would get  down  in the mud  and then the women were  going  to  run
 
through the mud as well.
 He said that there would be a wet t-shirt
 
contest.
 Surely he was joking.

Leona  Cyr has  been  sewing her  own  clothes  and  sewing  for  others
 
since  she  was  a young  girl.
 She  sews  for  a number  of  the
 
older  folks  at  the  Maison  Acadienne.
 She  has  been  at  the
 
Maison for nine years.
 
Leona learned most of what she knows about weaving from her mother-
in-law Mrs.  Delina Gendreau of St.  David.
 Mrs. Gendreau had a loom
 
that would produce material around 32" wide.
 She worked in cotton
 
and wool.
 
Leona's  father  raised  sheep.
 Ten  or  twelve  sheep  are  needed  to
 
produce  the  wool  that  would  be  knitted  into  the  stockings,
 
mittens,  hats,  and occasional coverlets for the average large
 
family.
 Sheep were sheared by hand.
 Wool was washed and hand
 
carded  to  take  out  sticks  and  dirt  then  taken  to  Martin's
 
carding mill in Madawaska where it would be further carded for
 
a price per  lb.
 The carded wool was then spun by her mother
 
to the particular thickness of yarn needed. Then the knitting
 
would begin.
 
Leona was the oldest in a family of nine.
 Her mother had carried
 
13 children, only nine lived (her mother must have died around
 
the age of 30).
 Leona said her  life as the  first child was
 
very hard.

My conversation with Mrs.  Leona Cyr was almost entirely in French.
 
I quizzed her concerning her knowledge of the various pieces and
 
parts of the loom.
 She seemed to like the game.
 I would describe
 
the part or draw a picture of  it and she would tell me its name.

After I left the Maison Acadienne where I had visited with Leona
 
Coté Cyr,  I traveled to Frenchville to check out the strip canoe
 
that David Taylor noticed under construction yesterday.
 
I met  Jean  Baker  White.
 She  was  working  in  the  garden  when  I
 
knocked at her door.
 When I said I was interested in the canoe she
 
began telling me in detail about its construction.
 I told her who
 
I was and the purpose of my visit and she invited me in for coffee.
 
I fetched my notebook and accepted her offer.
 
Jean  first  wanted  to  tell  me  about  her  heritage;
 she  is  a
 
descendant of the Baker bunch that stirred trouble  in the Valley
 
during the early and midle 19th century.
 Her ancestry:
 
father -
-
 Guy Baker  (spoke no French;  school superintendant)
 
mother -
-
 Bertha Dubé of Long Lake/Ste.  Agatha
 
paternal grandfather -
-
 Jesse Wheelock Baker II

 Enoch Baker
 
"gr.gr.gr.grandfather -

 Nathan Baker  (brother of John Baker)
 
Nathan Baker's wife was Sophie Rice.
 When Nathan Baker died,  his
 
brother John married his widow.
 So it was Sophie Rice that refused
 
to  lower the  flag of the United States while her husband was  in
 
prison in Fredericton  (and all that stuff).
 
Jean  has  a picture  of  a painting  of  "The  First  Framed  House  in
 
Moscow, Maine."  This house was built by John Baker before he moved
 
to  the  Valley.
 The  image  shows  a red  house  with  a centrasl
 
fireplace,  central  and one side door,  that  looks proportionately
 
similar to the older houses we are calling Acadian.
 
Jean refered me to an article in Down East, March 1989, written by
 
Tom Hill entitled,  "The Little War That Wasn't."
 
Jean was born in Eagle Lake, May 30,  1950.
 She was raised in Fort
 
Kent  until  she  was  15  years  old.
 Jean  claims  that  her  first
 
language  is  French  because  her  mother  spoke  almost  nothing  but
 
French when she was young.
 Her father spoke no French but could
 
understand it very well.
 
Jean attended L'Ecole St. Louis in Fort Kent.  Most of the teachers
 
were nuns although this was a public school.
 Jean said that the
 
Catholic  Church  paid  the  state  a fee  of  $1.00  (
?)  to  gain  the
 
privilege of teaching catechism one hour of each day.
 The day was
 
started with catechism lessons in French.  Jean learned her prayers
 
in French.
 The remainder of the school day was in English and the
 
students were not permitted to speak French.  Jean attended L'Ecol
 
St. Louis during the years 1956-1965.
 She claims that the students
 
were
 punished
 for
 speaking
 French.
 This
 information
 i
 
corroborated by others from the Fort Kent area that I have heard
 
speaking about this topic.
 I heard one woman younger than Jean say
 
that that she was made to feel so embarrassed because of her accent
 
and her French that she did not want her children to speak French.
 
Jean seems a little bitter about the school systems'  treatment of
 
French  but  Eh'  i  n v rth 1

heritage.
 
Jean's hu
 ,
 
family name had been LeBlanc until a census taker changed it around
 
the  turn  of  the  20th  century.
 Jerry  is  superintendent  for  the
 
school district that includes Frenchville and Ste.  Agatha.
 He is
 
building his first canoe.
 He is following some of the advice set
 
forth in Building a Strip Canoe, written by Gil Gilpatrick (Delorme
 
Publishing Company,  1985).
 He is using strips that are 1/4" x 7/8"
 
x various lengths.
 His main assistance and inspiration comes from
 
Mark Jalbert.
 
Mark Jalbert,  the grandson of Sam Jalbert, and cousin of the James
 
Jalbert  we  met  at  Mrs.  Kitty  Brown's  the  previous  Sunday,  is
 
helping Jerry to build this canoe.  Mark Jalbert lives on Star Barn
 
Road -
-
 543-6945.
 
Jean thought that I would want to speak to Jerry Morin,  librarian
 
for school district,  as well --543-7739.
 A good resource person.
 
Jean and Jerry invited me back tomorrow to meet Mark Jalbert and to
 
talk some more about the NPS  initiative.
 We set appointment for
 
7:00 PM.

Whitman and I revisited the Jerry White home in Frenchville to meet
 
the director of J.  White's  canoe building project,  Mark Jalbert,
 
and to get some info from the Whites.
 
Jerry  White's  family  name  was  LeBlanc  until  1900  when  a census
 
taker changed the spelling.
 Jerry T.  White was born 11/24/43 in
 
Caribou.

Kent, to East Anglia,  England for some college and to UMFK for her
 
B.A.  in  English  plus  15  extra  hours.
 She  has  been  a school
 
teacher.
 Now,  she  is  designing  and  creating  various  forms  of
 
needlecraft.
 
Jean started school in Fort Kent in around 1956.
 She said that at
 
that time there were many monolingual students beginning with her.
 
She said that, although the school was public, the Church would pay
 
the  state  $1.00/day  so  that  the  students  could  be  taught  there
 
catechism even though it was a public school.
 Jean said that the
 
catechism was taught in French during the 1950s.
 She learned all
 
of her prayers in French.
 She said that after catechism French was
 
not allowed.
 She spoke of being punished for speaking French.
 She
 
said
 that
 as
 late
 as
 1979
 when
 her
 mother
 was
 teaching
 
kindergarten, monolingual French students were entering the school
 
at that level.  Both Jerry and Jean believe that there are yet many
 
French speakers of a very young age.
 
Jerry and Jean had a lot to say negatively about Van Buren.
 They
 
said  that  the  town  is  crippled  by  the  welfare  system.
 Several
 
generation welfare  families  are  common  in Van Buren.
 They  said
 
that the closing of the McDonald's in Van Buren was because there
 
was not enough money in that town to buy hambergers.
 If they would
 
have  accepted  food  stamps  instead  of  cash McDonald's  could have
 
remained in business.
 
Jerry said that welfare was not as bad in Frenchville,  St. Agatha,
 
or  Madawaska  because  Frasier  and  farming  have  kept  most  people
 
working.
 Jerry  mentioned  that  the  white  "felt"  that  we  see
 
covering  some driveways  in the  area  is  a byproduct of  the paper
 
manufacturing process.
 Big roles of this felt are regularly given
 
away  to  Frazier  employees  when  it  is  no  longer  useful  in  their
 
industry.
 People in the Valley use it to cover driveways and yards
 
in the winter in order to keep the salt from the snow treatment off
 
of their property.
 This salt would kill all of the grass.
 
Jerry  said  that  Frenchville  has  a number  of  qualifications  that
 
should be noted when the selection of a location for the NPS center
 
is considered:  
-
 Frenchville  is  perfectly  centered  in the Valley  especially  if
 
Allagash is included in the definition of the region;
 
-
 Frenchville  is politically neutral  compared to Madawaska,  Fort
 
Kent,  or  VanBuren  -
-
 there  are  not  terribly  bitter  factions  in
 
Frenchville  (Arthur Foucher is the town manager of Madawaska);
 
-
 St.  Luce is probably the oldest church in the Valley,  the wood
 
work and pews inside is beautiful though it has been vaneered later
 
in flag stone;
 
-
 In a couple of years the Frenchville vocational center will be
 
complete and in business,  a performance hall could be part of the
 
facility,  the  facility was  located  in Frenchville because of  its
 
central location;
 
-
 Frenchville and St.  Agatha are the heart of the French-speaking
 
Valley region.
 
When  asked what  exactly  the  NPS  needs  to  do  to  help  the  French
 
maintain their culture in the Valley,  Jerry and Jean replied:  
-
 don't forget the children, NPS must work with the school system,
 
outreach to the students is essential;
 
-
 the common residents of the Valley who are not particularly well-
educated  or  high  class  must  be  comfortable  and  welcome  to  the
 
Center;
 
-
 (Jean)  the living customs and culture of the Valley needs to be
 
the focus of the Center
 
I asked Jerry and Jean if they thouqht the name "Acadian" would be
 
appropriate or if it would turn some away.
 
-
 Acadian is the least pejoritive name available and there is less
 
stigma attached to it -
-
 it is better than Franco-American;
 
-
 for the  last  15 years  family reunions and the Acadian Festival
 
have led to the resurgence (surgence?) of identity with the Acadian
 
story;
 
-
 those that are not Acadian need not be turned off.
 
The Canoe
  
Mark  Jalbert  is  the  37  year  old  grandson  of  Sam  Jalbert  the
 
renowned wilderness  guide of  the Allagash.
 He was  born at  Fort
 
Kent  3/1/54.
 RFD #1,  Box  560,  Madawaska,  Me.  04756.
 Mark  is a
 
postman who lives on Star Barn Road,  1/4 m.  after turn off of Hwy
 
1, house on left before powere lines.
 His brother Danny,  lives on
 
Brook Road.
 
Jerry is building a strip canoe.
 This is the first boat that Jerry
 
has built though he is very interested in wooden and sail boats of
 
all sorts.
 He is a sailor and his young children have all learned
 
to sail when they lived at North Haven,  Maine.
 He wants to built
 
a v-hull 17.5 foot sailboat next.
 
Mark Jalbert has build at  least a half dozen canoes.
 His  father
 
Wilber has built a canoe also.  He uses a mold around which to bend
 
the strips of his canoes.
 I taped a long (approx.  1 hr.)  interview
 
with Mark concerning his memories about his famous grandfather Sam
 
Jalbert,  his  start  in  the  canoe  building  line,
 and  specific
 
construction  techniques  he  uses.
 Jerry  White  entered  into  the
 
taped conversation at some points.  Mark did go hunting and fishing
 
with his  father Wilber and his  t
tgrampyt'  Sam.
 Sam had a few Old
 
Town canoes and some others for his guide business.  Mark remembers
 
that the  floating  of  the  logs  during the  Spring  flood was  still
 
going on during the early 1960s.
 He said that Sam was the foreman
 
of the log drive from the Allagash.
 
He  said that  he  remembers  that  soem people would  be paid  to  go
 
along the banks and push logs away from the bank.
 Others would be
 
in boats doing the same.
 Mark said that a floating camp on  logs
 
would come along at the tail of the drive.
 
Mark  built  six  canoes  using  the  planking method.
 He  said  this
 
technique requires more work and it is no more sturdy nor does it
 
perform better than canoes made of strips.
 Mark was not familiar
 
with the term "gore" or "spile" though he knows exactly how to fit
 
a curved plank into an odd place in the bilge of a canoe.
 Mark did
 
not  know the  word  "bilge."
 Mark  and  Jerry  have  both  seen  flat
 
stern canoes but they do not remember seeing wooden skiffs in the
 
area.  Jerry introduced the word skiff into the conversation but he
 
and Mark said that it was not used in this area.
 They said that
 
the common name for the alluminum skiffs that are so common on the
 
lakes is "fishing boat."
 
Mark gave me three 3 x 5 color prints of a strip canoe built in the
 
Spring of  1991  for Mark's brother Danny.
 One of the shots  is of
 
the  mold,  another  shot  focuses  upon  the  seat  installation,  the
 
other  focuses  upon  the  painted  (white)  canoe  under  power  (6  hp
 
outboard)  in the St.  Francis  (
?).
 
Jerry White also gave me four 3.5 x 5.2 color prints taken by him
 
that document the process of building that has gone on during the
 
current project.
 Jean Baker White gave me a lovely post card of
 
the schooner fleet at North Haven,  Maine.
 
I was not taking notes while I recorded the conversation with Mark
 
Jalbert and Jerry White so I must depend upon the tape log for much
 
of the technical  info gathered.

Whitman and I traveled to Van Buren for the opening of the Festival
 
de La Grande Rivi&re.
 We arrived at 2:15 pm which was just in time
 
to park where the Tintamare revelers were assembling.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Levasseur of Van Buren.  Mr. Levasseur was videotaping
 
the  proceeding.
 He  was  born  in  Hamlin.
 His  wife  was  born  in
 
Edmunston.
 He  said  that  below Van  Buren  on  the  St.  John River
 
there was no such a thing as customs.
 He said that people crossed
 
the  border  at  will  and  that  families  and  friends  lived  on  both
 
sides.
 It  is  not  like  that  today.
 The  border  restricts  the

After the Tintamare, a tug of war was scheduled between St. Leonard
 
and Van Buren.
 On the way to this contest I met Jim Madore.
 Jim
 
is  about  37  years  old.
 I had met  him  at  St.  Bruno's  when  the
 
choirs were  singing  for  the Good  Shepherd  Sisters  Centenial.
 I
 
asked  him  about  the  Tintamare  and  he  said  that  it  has  been  a
 
tradition in Van Buren since 1989.  He said that it is treated like
 
a tradition and people  look  forward to  it.
 He  said that he had
 
read that the tradition is really 400 years old but that he forgot
 
which place in France it began.
 
While I was talking with Jim Madore,  I met the mayor of the town of
 
Ouenne,  France  which  is  located  on  the  Loire  just  east  of  La
 
Vendée.
 Ouenne has twinned with Van Buren and there are some 50
 
visitors  in town from the French town.
 It  is clear that many of
 
the events at the festival are designed with the visitors in mind.
 
The Mayor was very pleasant and friendly.
 When Jim and I met him
 
he  showed pleasure  that we  spoke  French  to  him.
 Jim,  from Van
 
Buren,  told him that surely the Van Buren French was not the same
 
as his.
 The mayor said that sure it was the same French and that
 
he has had no problem speaking with the people from Van Buren.
 Jim
 
Madore belief that the  local  French is different and substandard
 
compared  French  from  France  is  typical.
 I have  heard  the  same
 
sentiment expressed on numerous occasions.
 The people here have
 
been  convinced  that  there  French  is  bad.
 There  is  a horrible
 
stigma  attached to  the  local  French despite the  fact that  it  is
 
extremely  common.
 There  are  clearly  many  people  who  can  not
 
communicate comfortably in English.
 
The tug of war was mostly a flop.
 It was very lucky that no one
 
received serious injuries at this event.
 First of all,  organizers
 
had planned for the contest to take place across the St. John with
 
opposite teams  pulling  from opposite  banks.
 This  did not  occur
 
because  there  was  nothing  but  steep  and  jagged  rocks  on  the
 
Canadian side  (how could anyone have missed that small detail?),
 
and a boat that was supposed to facilitate the contest did not show
 
up.
 Instead they decided to have  it on the bridge.
 This was a
 
mistake.
 The  custom  officers  did  not  stop  traffic  from  either
 
side.
 As  a result,  cars  and trucks weaved  in and out crowds  of
 
spectators  and  rope  tuggers  mounted  on  the  bridge.
 It  was  a
 
ridiculous and very dangerous situation.
 Children were dashing in
 
front of cars to get a better vision of the rope tuggers.
 
The actual contest was also a flop.
 The American side had chosen
 
a certain  number  of  pullers.
 Some  were  tremendous  in  size  but
 
there was a relatively small number.
 Where they one fire fighter
 
team?
 As the contest began,  the Americans clearly had the upper
 
hand.
 They  would  organize  ralleys  and  pull  the  Canadian  team
 
dozens of yards at a time.
 But Whitman,  who was stationed nearer
 
the  Canadian  side,  reported  that  each  time  the  Canadians  lost
 
ground,  they would add one or two pullers to there side.
 After a
 
while the contest began to swing toward the Canadians.
 Then the
 
near tragedy occurred: the rope apparently broke somewhere near the
 
middle  of the  bridge.
 One  of  the American pullers  fell  to the
 
bridge surface and groaned in pain.
 I am not sure whether the rope
 
burned  his  hands  or  if  the  end  of  the  rope  recoiled  from  its
 
breaking.  He was in pain and it took about five minuted for him to
 
regain his feet.
 All the time,  the crowd was gathered around the
 
fallen puller on the bridge and the cars and trucks continued to
 
weave their way  from one  side  of  the  border to  the  other.
 The
 
fallen  puller  regained  his  feet  and  he  was  not  apparently  hurt
 
seriously.
 
The  custom  station  guards,  in  my  opinion,  acted  irresponsibly.
 
They never attempted to control traffic on the bridge.  Had someone
 
been runover,  and it is a wonder that this did not happen,  whose
 
responsibility would it have been?

July 15,  1991
 
Tried to set up an appointment with Roger Paradis this morning.  He
 
wasn't sure when he would have time but he is going to be home for
 
several more days before he leaves again on his research trip.  Mr.
 
Paradis is very hard to visit.
 
Travelled to Van Buren (Acadian Village) to take in Native American
 
Day.
 When I arrived at the Village,  around 2:00 I
'M,  there was no
 
place to park.
 The parking lot was completely full so I parked on
 
the North side of Hwy 1.
 I was the first to park there but within
 
a half hour there was a long line parked on the Hwy.
 
The
 spokesman
 and  master
 of
 ceremonies
 was
 a  Micmac
 from
 
Frenchville by  the  name  of  Fregnon.
 Fregnon  is  originally  from
 
Bouctouche,  New  Brunswick.
 He  is  half  Acadian;  his  mother  is
 
Micmac.
 He told me that his family does not recognize their Indian
 
blood.
 He was a very good spokesman in French.
 He played along
 
with the crowd in a very congenial way.
 Later,  in private,  I asked
 
him what he thought about the term "sauvage" that is used locally
 
to refer to Indians.
 He said that the term does not bother him.
 
He  said  that,
 if  they  mean  "close  to  nature"  when  they  say
 
"sauvage," he like the term.
 
According to  the  news  release,  three  groups  were  supposed to  be
 
represented  at  the  event:
 the  Micmac,
 the  Malecite,
 and  the
 
Pasamaquoddy.
 Beside Fregnon,  there were a number from the Micmac
 
reservation  near  Fredrickton,  N.B.
 There were  around  one  dozen
 
Native Americans  in  all.
 The Micmacs  from Presque  Isle,  Donald
 
Sanipass and son, did not arrive.  The Malecites from Iroqouis were
 
not represented.
 
There was plenty of what appeared to be Plains Indian trappings at
 
the pow wow.
 There was  a large  teepee  set  up  just  outside the
 
Acadian Village grounds.
 Some of the Indians were dressed in the
 
customary fringed buckskin associated with the Plains.
 One had a
 
breastplate made of drilled cylindrical bones of the sort worn by
 
Apache warriors.  The Indians performed a purification ritual which
 
entailed the  burning  of  braided  sweetgrass.
 The peace pipe was
 
then  passed  around  by  a Micmac  named  Ken  Cloud  and  was  lighted
 
repeatedly with the braided strand of sweetgrass by a Micmac named
 
"Buck"  from  the  same  New  Brunswick  reservation  as  Cloud,  Red
 
?
,  near Frederickton.
 Quite a number of oldtimers  from the
 
area smoked on the pipe.
 Those that refused to smoke were tapped
 
ceremoniously on both shoulders with the pipe.
 Young and old were
 
offered the pipe.
 
Then the drum was introduced.
 Fregnon invited all to join in the
 
dance.
 He demonstrated  for  the crowd then he began to beat the
 
drum.
 It was a dance drum of the sort that i have seen among the
 
mixed Woodland and Plain tribes of Missouri.
 A surprizing number
 
of guests of all ages joined in the dance.  A number of the dancers
 
were the visitors from Ste.- Ouenne,  France.
 After this dance was
 
completed,  the  Native  Americans  performed  a  fancy  dance  in  a
 
tighter circle around the drum.
 
Next,
 Fregnon
 offered
 his
 long
 Plains-style,
 eagle-feather
 
headdress  for  anyone  who  wanted  to  wear  it  while  they  took  a
 
picture.
 The Mayor of Ste.- Oeunne, Monsieur Didier Delechat, was
 
the first to wear the headdress.
 While he was being photographed
 
standing  next  to  the  big  Malecite  from  Frenchville,  one  of  his
 
party  from France  commented  that the  caption would read,  "Mayor
 
standing  next  to  an  Italian."
 Fregnon,  who  does  look  a  bit
 
Sicillian,  broke up laughing at this.
 I thought I was at a Wild
 
West Show!
 
This event brings to mind a number of considerations:
 
1
)  there is inadequate parking at Acadian Village for an event of
 
more than a hundred or so;
 
2
)  it turned out hot  and the  crowd had nothing  to drink  -
-
 cold
 
drinks sold out within the first half hour;
 
3)  the locals are interested in and have considerable respect for
 
Native Americans;
 
4)  the locals continue to use the term "sauvage"  to refer to the
 
Native  Americans.
 In  one  instance,  a local  Acadian  said  to  a
 
Frenchman  from  Ste.-  Ouenne,  "u s  y on  a pas  des  Sauvage  chez
 
vous?"
 She was surprized when the Frenchman mumbled something and
 
walked off.
 The term  "sauvage"  is  also typically the only term
 
used  by  Louisiana  French-speakers  to  refer  to  Indians.
 In  my
 
experience,
 Europeans
 don't
 understand
 the
 local
 usage
 of
 
"sauvage."
 It is quite likely that certain native American groups
 
will not understand this either.
 But,  do you modify traditional
 
local  dialect  for  a public  program?
 I think  yes  -
-
 we  don't
 
present "nigger"  performers  in Louisiana though the term is very
 
common in white parlance.
 
One local woman named Cyr told me that children whose mothers were
 
pregnant were told that an Indian brought the baby.
 And, when the
 
mother had to stay in bed for a certain time after giving birth,
 
the children would be told that the Indian would break her leg when
 
he brought the baby.
 This explained to the children why the mother
 
ou1d not get up.
 
Mr.  Alfred Michaud,  the old birdhouse maker,  told me that he was
 
part "
s
a u v a g e.
"  
Then,  he began retelling the Acadian story of Le
 
Grand Derangement and when he got to the exile part he said that
 
the "sauvages" were put on one boat and the women put on another
 
I asked Mr. Michaud if he had ever heard of "des Lutins."  He
 
said that they are very small and they live in caves.
 He said that
 
they come out  at night.
 They will enter a stable and tress the
 
hair of a horse.
 When  I asked him how large are the  lutins,  he
 
said  that  they were  so  small  that  they  could  come  into  a house
 
anytime they pleased.
 They could pass through the key hole.
 I
 
asked Mr. Michaud if he knows Alford Parent, the fiddle player who
 
lives at the Borderview housing project.  He said that he does know
 
him and that he himself was a much better fiddler than Mr. Parent.
 
He said that he played dance from Edmunston to Grand Falls.
 Mr.
 
Michaud would be a good storyteller but he stutters a bit, possible
 
because of a nervous condition,  and he has a tendency to speak too
 
fast and rush his words together.
 He is a fascinating informant.

 work  with  the  NEA  Folk  Arts  Program  and  Missouri  Arts
 
Council to administer Mo.  TAAP and MPT
 
Since June 2,  1992 I have served as Field Coordinator for the
 
Maine Acadian Culture  Survey.
 This  survey  is being conducted by
 
the  American  Folklife  Center  in  the  Library  of  Congress.
 The
 
survey  personnel  consists  of  a small  field  team  including  Lisa
 
Ornstein  of
 the  UNFK  Acadian  Archives
 and  Professor. Howard
 
Marshall,  David  Whitman,  and  myself,  of  University  of  Missouri
 
Cultural Heritage  Center.
 We have enjoyed the  assistance  of the
 
staff
 of
 the  American
 Folklife
 Center
 in  Washington,
 D. C.,
 
especially  David  Taylor,
 Camila  Bryce-Laporte,
 and  Dir.  Allan
 
Jabbour.
 
Local  experts,  like  Guy  Dubé  and  Don  Cyr,  have  helped  us
 
greatly to begin to develop an informed concept of the history and
 
cultural wealth of the St.  John Valley.
 
Our work has  been,  and  continues  to  be,  greatly  assisted by
 
many  other  community  and  historical  society  leaders,  and  a much
 
greater number of those whom we may call "civilians," just everyday
 
people  of  many  walks  of  life  who  have  gladly  contributed  their
 
time,  honest opinions,  and great wealth of personal experiences.
 
As  our brief but enlightening visit  of Upper Maine draws  to
 
its  conclusion,
 I would  like  to  sincerely  thank  all  who  have
 
contributed
 to
 the
 success
 of
 this
 project.
 Without
 the
 
cooperation and assistance of local citizens our work could not be
 
accomplished.
 
I would like to begin a discussion of our ongoing project in
 
the St.  John Valley and Vicinity with a few words about cultural
 
preservation and public policy.
 A good place to start is with the
 
legislation that enables our project -
-
 that is,  the Maine Acadian
 
Culture Preservation Act (Public Law 101-543).  This law was passed
 
by the U.S.  Congress  on November  8,  1990.
 The purposes  of this
 
legislation are outlined in Section 2 of this Act and I think the
 
words  deserve
 carefull
 note.
 According  to
 Section  2,
 the
 
legislative initiative seeks to:
 
(1)
 recognize  an  important  contribution  made  to  American
 
culture and history by the Acadian immigrants from France who
 
settled in Nova Scotia and, following expulsion by the British
 
in  1755,
 resettled
 in  various  North  American  colonies,
 
including the territory that eventually became the State of
 
Maine;
 
[Recognition is a very important first step.
 As many of you know
 
from  first-hand  experience,  it  is  not  always  easy  to  come  by
 
Federal recognition,  and,  unless your a smuggler of  some sort or
 
you  have  IRS  problems,  it  should  be  a  source  of  considerable
 
satisfaction.]
 
(
2)  assist  local and  state governments and other public and
 
private  entities  in  the  State  of Maine  in  interpreting the
 
story of the State's Acadian settlers and their descendants as
 
well as preserving Acadian music,  arts,  crafts and folklore;
 
[Note that the emphasis here is not only upon the history of past
 
Acadian  settlers,  but  also  upon  living  descendants  and  their
 
cultural expressions.]
 
and,
 
(
3)  assist  in  identifying,  gathering,  and preserving  sites,
 
historical  data,  artifacts,  and objects associated with the
 
Acadians of Maine for the benefit and education of the public.
 
[Note  here  that  the  emphasis  includes  not  only  the  traditional
 
"cultural  resources"  that we  have  come  to  recognize  as National
 
Register properties,  stately mansions,  and sites associated with
 
the history of  famous people,  for instance,  but  it also includes
 
the  data,  artifacts,  and  objects  relevent  to  a group  of working
 
folk who were and still are relatively unknown and unappreciated in
 
this country.
 The wording of this legislation reflects an ongoing
 
change in the nation's commitment to cultural resources.]
 
The particular wording of this legislation was made possible,
 
in large part,  by the success of a cultural movement that has been
 
affecting  the  field  of  historic  preservation  for  the  last  two
 
decades.  This movement is known by the term cultural conservation.
 
Cultural conservation is an applied approach that recognizes and
 
encourages
 the
 diversity
 of
 traditional
 lifeways
 in
 plural
 
societies like our own.
 The concept of cultural conservation grew
 
out  of
 concern  with  the  accelerated
 erosion  of  traditional
 
community life  (Loomis 1983)  in this country.
 The development of
 
this approach is the result of an integration of folklife studies
 
with  the  historic  preservation  movement  (Jabbour  and  Marshall
 
1980).
 It  was  first  reflected  in  government  policy  in  January
 
1976,  when Congress passed The American Folklife Preservation Act
 
(Public Law 94-201),  which established in the Library of Congress
 
an  American  Folklife  Center  "to  preserve  and  present  American
 
folklife."
 Section 3 of P.L 94-201 defined the term "folklife" in
 
this way:
 
•
 •
 .
 the  term  "American  folklife"  means  the  traditional
 
expressive  culture shared within the various groups  in the
 
United  States:  familial,  ethnic,  occupational,  religious,
 
regional;
 expressive  culture
 includes  a  wide  range  of
 
creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical
 
skill,  language  .
..;  these  expressions  are  mainly  learned
 
orally,  by  imitation,  or  in performance,  and are generally
 
maintained  without  the  benefit  of  formal  instruction  or
 
institutional direction  .
 
The  need  for  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  cultural
 
heritage conservation was  further acknowledged  in  Section 502  of
 
The National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 (Public
 
Law  96-515).
 This  legislation  directed  the  Secretary  of  the
 
Interior and the American Folklife Center to prepare a report on
 
"preserving and conserving the intangible elements of our
 
cultural heritage such as arts,  skills,  folklife,  and folkways
 
that  underlie  and  are  a  living  expression  of  our  American
 
heritage."
 
The resulting report is entitled,  Cultural Conservation:  The
 
Protection of Cultural Heritage in the United States (Loomis 1983).
 
This report recommends strategies  aimed at the encouragement and
 
conservation  of  folk  cultural  traditions  that  "constitute  the
 
historical
 and
 living
 seedbed
 of
 our
 society."
 Cultural
 
conservation  relies  upon  the  tenets  of  cultural
 equity  and
 
pluralism -
-
 that all cultures have an equal right to be heard,  to
 
express their aesthetic values,  and to be judged in terms of their
 
own standards  (Brassieur and Marshall 1991).
 
I recommend this guide to anyone who is interested in programming
 
folklife  events,
 and  especially  to  anyone  who  expects  to  do
 
cultural business with the National Park Service in northern Maine.
 
Under the provisions of the Maine Acadian Culture Preservation
 
Act,  The American  Folklife  Center  in the Library  of  Congress  is
 
authorized  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  to  help  insure
 
compliance with its mandates.
 This includes the preparation of "a
 
comprehensive study of Acadian culture in Maine."  This study has,
 
to the extent possible, been holistic and multidisciplinary (Carter
 
and Fleischauer 1988).
 Historical and ethnohistorical method has
 
been
 used
 to
 assemble
 background
 information
 and
 archival
 
materials.
 Techniques  and  perspectives
 from  the  fields  of
 
ethnography,  ethnology,  oral history,  folklore,  architectural and
 
material
 culture
 documentation,
 geography,
 ethnomusicology,
 
genealogy, and linguistics, among others, have been employed.  This
 
research project has been limited in time and personnel but broad
 
and inclusive  in perspective.
 It has been woven together by two
 
principles  -
-
 a  concern  for  everyday  life,  and  a  focus  upon
 
tradition as the dynamic process that links past and present.
 
This
 study
 and
 the
 resulting
 report
 will
 provide
 
recommendations with regard to future documentation, conservation,
 
and  public  presentation  of  cultural  resources  in  the  St.  John
 
Valley by the National Park Service.
 
[so, how does the National Park Service -
-
 Yellowstone -
-
 Yosemite
 
-
-
 historical battlefields -
-
 former Presidents' houses -
-
 view its
 
commitment to living culture?]
 
The National Park Service
 
(Read  excerpt  from Douglas  A.  Scoville,  "Cultural  Diversity  and
 
Native  Peoples,"  in  10  CRM  Bulletin 1:1-13.
 (A  National  Park
 
Service Technical Bulletin published February 1987).)
 
I  find  this  analogy  between  the  conservation  of  natural
 
environmental diversity and the conservation of cultural diversity
 
to be very useful.
 
The U.S.  Department of  the  Interior  is presently supporting
 
cultural conservation objectives at a number of sites including the
 
Jean Lafitte National Historical Park,  Louisiana;  the Lowell NHP,
 
Massachusetts;  the  Blue  Ridge  Parkway;  Cuyahoga  Valley National
 
Recreation Area, Ohio; Big South Fork National River and Recreation
 
Area,
 on  the
 Cumberland  Plateau;
 the  Ozark  National
 Scenic
 
Riverways,
 Missouri.
 Interpretation
 and
 conservation
 of
 
traditional  culture  and  folklife  is  important  at  each  of  these
 
sites.
 The  effort  to  establish  a Maine  Acadian  culture  center
 
represents an expansion in this direction.
 
The study that we are presently conducting is only the first
 
step  in  a process  that  will  lead  to  a  National  Park  Service
 
presence  in the  St.  John Valley.
 What will  be the character of
 
this presence?
 It  is too early to tell.
 To some,  this presence
 
might  conjure  visions  of  a new  interpretive  center  located  on a
 
nice piece of property enclosed by a nice new cloture de pieux, or
 
rail  fence.
 Let  me  say  that,  at  this  point,  any  image  of  a
 
cultural center  is exactly that -
-
 imaginary. 
For example,  some
 
people are speculating as to where the Center will be built.
 Now,
 
according  to  my  reading  of  P.L.  101-543,  there  is  a mandate  to
 
"establish" a cultural center -
-
 not to "build" anything.
 
The  Park  Service  has  a number  of  models  of  development  to
 
consider,
 and,
 as  we  should  expect,
 the  development  of  this
 
cultural facility will have its own special twists and turns.
 
In
 Louisiana,
 the
 Jean
 Lafitte
 National
 Park,
 still
 in
 
developmental  stage  thirteen  years  after  the  initial  study,  is
 
taking the form of an administrative center with satellite units.
 
The  main  office  is  in  New  Orleans  with  developing  interpretive
 
centers in the French Quarter, Barataria, Thibodaux, Lafayette, and
 
Eunice, which is a small town 160 miles away from the main office.
 
For the first decade of operations in Louisiana,  the NPS sponsored
 
events were held at facilities provided by "cooperative agreement"
 
agencies.
 The  legislation of this  act also mandates the NPS to
 
enter
 into
 cooperative
 agreements
 with
 institutions
 and
 
individuals.
 
The Jean Lafitte National Park model is,  of course,  only one
 
of  many possible  models.
 Outside  of  the  strict  reading  of  the
 
legislation,  it  is too early to tell what direction the National
 
Park Service will take.
 In fact,  it is also too early to talk much
 
about  the  recommendations  this  study  will  provide  to  the  Park
 
Service.
 
I can say that, as we attended festivals,  interviewed people,
 
and ate ployes throughout the Valley,  we have found what many of
 
you  already  knew  or  suspected:  that  the  St.  John  Valley  and
 
Vicinity abounds in a great diversity of cultural resources.  There
 
are  numerous  distinctive  Acadian  architectural
 features  that
 
deserve complete and thorough documentation and world recognition.
 
Like in many parts of the country, some of these features are being
 
taken for granted.
 I am sorry to say,  that my first impression of
 
the St.  John Valley is of the great number of barns that are being
 
distroyed  by  fire  or  by  the  hands  of  time  --many  are  being
 
disassembled by the hands of man.
 If the number of farms continue
 
to decline and the destruction of farm buildings continues at its
 
present pace,  this entire class of historical  structures will be
 
completely absent  from the 21st century.
 What reminders will we
 
then have of those whose great toil produced and operated them?
 
French oral traditions are strong,  they are viable,  but they
 
too must  not  be  taken  for  granted.
 Having  lived  and worked  in
 
Louisiana,  I know that cultural and linguistic revival is a viable
 
alternative.
 The language,  the songs and stories that have passed
 
down through the generations,  are of tremendous value.
 They must
 
be cherished and they must be shared with the younger generations.
 
Among  our  discoveries,  I must  also  report,  we  found  the
 
fountain  of  youth.
 It  is  located  in  the  Forever  Young  Club  in
 
Madawaska.
 The  L'Age  d'Or  and  the  Forever  Young  Clubs  are
 
maintaining a wealth of music and dance traditions.
 But where do
 
the  younger  people  go  to  partake  in  this  wealth  of  cultural
 
heritage?  It seems to me that the older performance traditions are
 
crying for performance arenas.
 
Well,  I will  leave  it at that.
 I would  like  to  once again
 
sincerely thank all of those who have helped to make our visit to
 
St. John Valley so rewarding.
 I know that I will leave here at the
 
end  of  this  month  with  renewed  admiration  for  a people  who  so
 
cherished their traditions that they continued to spike sawn ship's
 
knees into their houses for a century after they were exiled from
 
their maritime homes.
 I'll also bring from the Valley a greater

 concerned  the  various
 sources  where  documentary
 
information  is  found.
 Dubay  recognized  four  sources:  archives,
 
registrars,  libraries,  museums.
 
Salmon Brook Agricultural Museum/Wilder House is great place.
 
Records indicate the patrilineal orientation of past society.
 For
 
instance,  in deeds and successions sons were listed by name while
 
daughters were  listed  in a group -
-
 "5 daughters."
 
In  1848,  ledgers  indicate  that  monatary  values  continued  to  be
 
assigned  in pounds,  shillings,  and pence.
 Eight days  of  common
 
work had the value of 1 pound.
 One days labor was equal to approx.
 
2  shillings,
 6 pence.
 Brittish  monetary  system  was  retained
 
because the capitol to finance the large lumber projects came from
 
brittish  Frederickton,  New  Brunswick.
 John  Glaser,  Perly,  and
 
Hathaway were some of the big investors involved in St. John Valley
 
and upper Maine finance.
 
The priest in Grand Isle was the only person who could sell oats
 
and wheat in the summertime.  Parishioners would support the church
 
by donations of farm produce and grain.  The priest would store the
 
donations  and  sell  grain  in  the  summer  when  the  price was  at  a
 
peak.
 
1846
 Glaser  blew the dam built by  Bangor  interests  in  order to
 
float logs in Aroostook Basin instead of St. John Basin.
 Case went
 
to court.
 Testimony of John Glaser is revealing.
 
1907 John Ranney blew the dam on the St.  John/Aroostook drainage
 
divide again(?).
 
1905  war  on  the  St.
 John  consisted  of  large  English  lumber
 
inertests  located  on  the  lower  St.  John  sending  conspiritors  to
 
dynamite  the  log  boom  in  Keegan  that  was  keeping  saw  logs  from
 
floating down river.
 Levy Pond had invented the shear boom or wing
 
boom,  a floating device to catch logs to be sawn at Keegan mill.
 
This infuriated the English-speaking interests in N.B.
 
Numbers of farms dropped during the 1920s prior to the Depression.
 
1922  newspaper  article  indicates  that  J.O.  Michaud,  maker  and
 
inventor of an automobile,  was in business in Ft.  Kent.
 
1956 Soil Bank Program begins.  Dubay sees longitudinal bifurcation
 
of state separating potato farmers from lumber interests.
 
Philip Turner and Winfred Martin from Caribou Historical Society -
-
"History in Painting"
 
Turner had the idea to build a "triptic" -
-
 a standing three-panel
 
display unit that folds together for easy transport.
 The tops of
 
triptic  panels  are  usually  pointed  or  arched.
 The  idea  for
 
triptics was  borrowed  from the  Catholic  Church which  often used
 
this  sort  of  a  system  to  share  information  with  congregation.
 
Turner  called  on Winfred Martin to  execute the  artistry on this
 
triptic.
 The tableau is commemorative of the 150 year anniversary
 
Caribou  (
?) or some such anniversary
 
Martin's  painting  is  naieve:  unrealistic  use  of  scale,  bright
 
colors of blue and yellow gold,  simplified,  non-naturalistic human
 
portraits.
 It  is  inspired  by  photographs,  memory,
 and  oral
 
history.
 It  is  chronological  in  orientation:  begins  with Capt.
 
William Eaton,  hero of the  19th century Barbary Pirates episode,
 
who was given a large land grant around Caribou.
 A canoe,  a bear,
 
a caribou,  a moose,  some Indians represent early history.
 Second
 
panel has oxen,  lumbering,  farm clearing scenes.
 Third panel  is
 
from Martin's memory  of  his  birthplace:  a large red  four-square
 
house,  a twin barn with a lean-to milking stable,  a potato house.
 
Martin said that potatoes were kept  in the basement of the house
 
until  the  potato  house  was  built.
 Also  on  this  panel  was  an
 
airplane and a bridge and a railroad in naieve perspective.

 "Making a Community Inventory"
 
Ornstein  provided  practical  advice  about  archival  procedures.
 
Catalogs for ordering archival materials were made available.
 
Ornstein  noted  problems  experienced  by  small  organizations  with
 
limited resources  and support,  related to responsible custody of
 
artifacts and documents.
 
Ornstein  suggested  the  development  of  a  controlled,
 focused
 
collections  policy  for  acquisition  and  de-acquisition.
 Also,
 
private citizens must help to conservre their own collections.
 
Rosaire Sirois was at the Workshop -
-
 he made a presentation after
 
lunch and we talked after the workshop.
 Sirois was born  in the
 
back settlements between Van Buren and Hamlin on August 26,  1924.
 
He now operates the followint business:

Rosaire J.  Sirois,  Prop.
 
Sirois began his talk by  asking  if  anyone knew the  sort  of  wood
 
used  to  make  the  ox  yoke  like  the  one  pictured  in  Martin's
 
painting.
 No one knew so he said that it was Birch.
 They used red
 
or white birch because it does not splinter.
 He said that birch
 
was  used  often  around  stables  and  stalls  in  barns  to  protect
 
animals.
 
Sirois  spoke  about  the  signals  that  smugglers  from Hamlin would
 
use:  flags,  telephone rings,  etc.
 Sirois was a conductor for the
 
Bangor and Aroostook.
 He would see people smuggling all the time.
 
He  treated  the  topic  of  smuggling  as  though  it  was  tricky  and
 
smart,  not terrible and bad.
 
Sirois remembered that when potatoes were brought from the field
 
during harvest,  if it was freezing,  the potatoes would not freeze
 
so long as they bounced and jiggled in the potato barrels on their
 
way  to  the  potato  house.
 However,
 if  the  potatoes  were  not
 
unloaded immediately upon reaching the house,  they would freeze in
 
He said the French people from the valley would pick for the potato
 
growers  from  Fort  Fairfield  by  hand.
 He  said  that  the  Ft.
 
Fairfield people would laugh at them for being French and  funny.
 
They were made to feel like second class people.
 
Sirois  siad  that  many  French  place  names  had  been  changed  by
 
mapmakers to a form that is no longer understandable.
 One example
 
is Brise-Culotte Road which is now "Brislotte."  Another example is
 
the  settlement  of  Caswell. 
It was  once  called  "cashe-canaillell
 
because  it was in this  area  that  Canadian  criminals were hidden
 
from authorities.
 
Sirois  sold  patent  medicine  during  the  mid-1930s. 
One  of the
 
products was called "Brule-Bec. 1

 He said that he has three things against
 
him  --  he  is  Catholic,  French,  and  Democrat.
 He  repeated  this
 
statement several times.
 He feels that he and many of the French
 
people  of  the  region  have  not  been  given  credit  for  thier
 
significant contributions.

Wilbur Nedeau,  a master machinist from Caribou,  perfected Sirois'
 
idea and produced the finely engineered model he holds at Nedeau's
 
Welding Shop in Caribou,  Me.
 
This Winter Wonder Invention can replace tire chains on cars
 
or trucks without making you get out of your vehicle to put them on
 
or  off.
 The  invention  can  be  activated manually,  hydrolically,
 
elctrically or by air.
 
!'his  Winter  Wondor  Invention  consists  of  a  spring  based  arm
 
extending from a small rubber wheel.  When the driver activates the
 
invention  from  inside the  car or truck cab,  the rubber wheel  is
 
lowered so  it can rub against the car or truck's tire.
 Three of
 
the spider-like arms are under the wheel  at all times to provide
 
traction.
 
THE ADVANTAGES
 
+ It can be turned on or off from inside the car or truck cab.
 
+ It can be used only when needed.
 
+ It is easier on the pavement.
 
+ It can be left on year-round.
 
+ It is noiseless.
 
+ Individual "arm" or cross-members can be replaced if they break.

Sirois also had some information about ship's knees.
 He said they
 
were taken from the roots or branches and that they are called "les
 
coudes,"  or  "elbows."
 He  said that the  Sacred Heart Church  in
 
North Caribou has at least 70 ship's knees.
 He said they are made
 
of spruce and pegged with ceder pegs that were burned in a forge
 
before thay were driven.
 The church was built around 1881 because
 
in  1981  they  had  their  centenial  anniversary.
 He  said  that  a
 
Father Nicnair would be the one to talk to.
 The church has seven
 
huge  load-bearing  wooden  columns  on  each  side  of  the  vaulted
 
ceiling.  Each of these columns have five ship's knees bracing them
 
in the area between the vaulted ceiling and the exterior wall and
 
roof  of  the  church.
 There  are  three  coudes that  brace  upper
 
transverse joists and two coudes that brace lower joists fastened
 
to each of the seven columns.
 Sirois had excellent 8 x 10 black
 
and white photos to varify his claims.
 I saw them myself and was
 
amazed.

A Rough and Rambling Stab at Recommendations:
 
Justification for a St.  John Valley Cultural Center
 
Both banks of the upper St. John River were settled during the
 
last  two  decades  of  the
 18th  century  by  a  French-speaking
 
population that consisted largely of refugees exiled by the British
 
from their homes in Acadia  (present-day Nova Scotia).
 During and
 
after the period of initial settlement in the St. John Valley, this
 
population of Acadians intermarried with the native population of
 
Malecite and Micmac Indians; with French-speaking immigrants from
 
Quebec,  from  along the  St.  Lawrence  River,  and  elsewhere  in the
 
Maritimes; and with English-speaking immigrants from New Brunswick
 
and New England.
 During  the  first  several  decades  of  the  19th
 
century, a thriving, Catholic, French-speaking, largely independent
 
and  self-sufficient  farming  community  with  many  Acadian  oral
 
traditions and material culture features developed in the valley.
 
By the fourth decade of the 19th century, the boundary dispute
 
between  New  Brunswick  and  Maine,
 sparked  by  the  struggle  for
 
forestry resources in the region of the upper St.  John Valley,  led
 
the United States and Great Britain to the verge of war.
 Following
 
the threat of armed conflict, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1843
 
finally  established  the  international  border  between  the  United
 
States and British-owned Canada.
 The boundary specified by this
 
treaty follows the course of the upper St. John River through that
 
region previously settled and developed by the Acadians.  After the
 
Webster-Ashburton  Treaty,  Acadian  families  settled  on  the  north
 
bank of the St.  John were British subjects -
-
 their brothers and
 
sisters and cousins on the south bank of the river became United
 
States citizens.
 
Following 1843, the French-speaking populations on respective
 
banks  of  the  St.  John  continued  to  interact  as  an  integrated
 
population.
 Parishioners continued to cross the river to attend
 
mass and receive  sacraments at their customary place of worship.
 
Intermarriages  between residents  living on opposite banks of the
 
river frequently occurred well into the 20th century.
 From time to
 
time,  residents  on  one  bank  typically  found  work  on  the  other.
 
River  crossings  were
 frequent  and  family  relationships  were
 
maintained irrespective of international policies.  To a diminished
 
extent, some cultural integration 15 maintained to the present day.
 
There are still residents on one bank who work on the other.
 The
 
older  generations  continue  to  maintain  certain  family  relations
 
across the river.
 Young and old often cross the border to attend
 
festivals,  dance parties,  and special events.
 
However,  the  international  boundary  that  separates  the  St.
 
John  Valley  Acadians  into  peoples  of  different  nationalitie s
 
inevitably led to important divergences in the two populations.  As
 
bridges replaced the ferry crossings early during the 20th century,
 
and especially with the enactment of Prohibition Laws, the boundary
 
became  more  carefully  controlled.
 The  Acadian  who  crossed  the
 
river  in  a private  boat  was  illegally  entering  into  a foreign
 
country.
 Bridge crossings were few and far between and visits to
 
the opposite bank often required good land transportation and much
 
more time.
 It was not the first time in their history that a wedge
 
had been effectively driven between Acadian kinsmen.
 
Perhaps
 the  greatest  differences  between  Maine  and  New
 
Brunswick  Acadians  has  resulted  from  the  divergence  of  the
 
respective school  systems.
 Throughout the  19th century and into
 
the  20th,  the  school  systems  on  both  banks  of  the  river  were
 
facilitated by the Catholic Church.
 It was possible for a Maine
 
Acadian to receive French  instruction  from teachers belonging to
 
one  of  the various  Catholic  religious  orders.
 French  education
 
dissolved in Maine with the advent of mandatory public education in
 
the United States.
 The mere speaking of French on school grounds
 
became  cause  for  punishment  and  a source  of  embarrassment.
 A
 
powerful stigma became attached to the local French language.  This
 
stigma  continues  to  negatively  affect  the  continuity  of  Acadian
 
oral traditions and folkways.
 
On the New Brunswick side of the river,  attempts to validate
 
and support French  language and culture have succeeded to a much
 
greater  degree.
 New  Brunswick  is  presently  a bilingual  state.
 
Parents  choose  between  total  French  or  total  English  education.
 
Most  Acadians  of  New  Brunswick  are  now  educated  exclusively  in
 
French.
 It is becoming apparent that younger Acadians on opposite
 
sides of the St. John River are becoming functionally unilingual in
 
different languages.
 
Acadian history provides an important key to our understanding
 
of the settling of North America and the historical development of
 
the United States.
 Acadian historical sites and properties in the
 
St.
 John
 Valley
 provide
 exciting,
 significant,
 and
 unique
 
information  relating  to  the  development  of  American  material
 
culture and society.  But most importantly, the need for an Acadian
 
cultural  center  in  the  St.
 John  Valley  is  justified  by  the
 
significance of the distinctive living expressive culture of Maine
 
Acadians.
 The
 living
 cultural
 heritage
 of
 Maine
 Acadians
 
contributes greatly to the cultural diversity of the United States.
 
The opportunity to maintain Maine Acadian cultural distinctivenes
 
can be greatly enhanced by the establishment of a cultural cent
 
that would encourage the respectful presentation and celebration
 
Acadian heritage.

;
 
which gauged groupness and identity among the Brayon/Acadian/Quebec

out  on  the  Maine  side  of  the  valley  would  be  very  helpful  to
 
cultural programmers.
 
D.
 Folk cultural studies:  this survey has barely began to scratch
 
the surface of rich oral and material expressions  in the valley;
 
oral tradition of every type needs collecting; material culture is
 
extremely rich.

To  document,
 conserve,
 celebrate,
 and
 
present  Acadian  and  related  French  traditional  culture  of
 
northern Aroostook county in such a way as to encourage the
 
continuity of living traditions and cultural diversity.

 This  model  takes  advantage  of  a  range  of
 
existing sites.
 One of the most pressing needs  is to develop a
 
performance venue which permits the professional presentation of
 
traditional performances to large groups.
 The Center should help
 
program and sponsor regular events but need not build and staff a
 
large site.
 
Notes on Programminq and Presentation:  
Programs must deal with living culture as well as Acadian history.
 
The legislative mandate addresses both.
 
The distinction between living history and living culture must be
 
underscored.
 
I strongly recommend that at  least some programs be presented  in
 
French  by  a speaker  of  local  Acadian  French.
 This  is  an
 
excellent way to validate local oral traditions.
 Nearly all
 
public presentations I witnessed during this field trip were
 
delivered at least partially in French.

Valuable radio or TV programs would be a great success.
 Live radio
 
broadcast performances would be very effective.
 
The  Center needs  to  learn to  arrange  for work  bonds  which  allow
 
performers from across the border to come over and perform in
 
the U.S.A.  for pay.
 This is crucial.
 There is a tremendous
 
amount of Acadian talent across the border.
 These tradjtonaJ
 
performers should be cultivated as role models and teachers
 
Regular/on-going programs that involve the transmission of skills,
 
lore,  or knowledge  from an  older master  to  a younger  student(s)
 
should be arranged.  Many of these programs can be presented to the
 
public  as  well.
 The  public  loves  to  see  the
 
traditions -
-
 especially from adults to youngsters
 
Present Native Americans,  Swedes, Allagash Moose Towners,  Syrians,
 
Irish, and every other ethnic and cultural group whenever possible.
 
Cultural diversity should not be limited to Acadians and Quebecois.
 
Include  school
 groups
 into  program  schedules
 either  through
 
outreach events or bus tours.
 The school children must feel
 
welcome and the parents must see that the Center serves their
 
children's needs.
 
The  greatest  sources  of  traditional  human  resources  are  the
 
valley's old folk homes.
 The Maison Acadienne in Madawaska,
 
the  Borderview  in  Van  Buren,
 and  homes
 in  Fort  Kent,
 
Frenchville,  and Eagle Lake are packed with fine exemplars of
 
Acadian traditions.
 
Genealogy  is  very  important  in  the  valley  but  leave  it  alone.
 
Family reunions do not need additional outside support.
 If
 
the
 Center
 produces
 successful
 programs,
 these
 good
 
programmatic ideas will diffuse rapidly to the larger family
 
reunions.
