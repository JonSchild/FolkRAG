Dear Anna:
 
November 10,  1997
 
Thank you for your exciting proposal regarding the Alan Lomax Archives.
 
The proposal envisions four key elements:
 1)  conveying the Alan Lomax Archives to
 
the Library of congress; 2)  ensuring that current efforts to develop and disseminate
 
educational materials from the Archives are sustained;  3)  endowing a curatorship to
 
oversee the preservation and utilization of the Archives and to develop future
 
activities appropriate to them;  and 4) providing a research and training capacity
 
tied to the Archives in the future.
 It is a proposal that views the tasks and
 
expenses comprehensively,  and thus it may seem challenging as we all contemplate it.
 
Nevertheless,  you have enumerated activities and responsibilities that seem both
 
appropriate and compelling,  and the Library is enthusiastically prepared to consider
 
all aspects of the proposal in comprehensive discussions with you.
 
In order to begin those discussions, we would like to offer a series of
 
comments,  clarifications,  and responses to questions you have posed.
 I have
 
reviewed this letter in draft form with Winston Tabb, Associate Librarian for
 
Library Services,  as well as with other colleagues,  to ensure that it fairly
 
represents our collective institutional thinking.
 
1. Endowment Proposal.
 
a. We heartily support the general idea of creating an endowment to
 
support the activities envisioned in your proposal.
 The Library is prepared to
 
undertake major fundraising efforts to achieve these goals,  and an endowment may be
 
the only way to secure the longrange programmatic goals.
 
b. Our discussions should address whether it is better for such an
 
endowment to begin under the aegis of the Library,  similar to certain trust funds
 
with their own board structures which have been created within the Library over the
 
years; or whether it should be created apart from the Library,  then come to the
 
Library with the collection.
 
c. We should also discuss whether and how an endowed Alan Lomax chair at
 
a university would function vis a vis the endowed curator at the Library.
 Are these
 
in fact similar or different positions?  Would the endowed chair at the university
 
be expected to work with the Alan Lomax Archives,  or is that not a necessary
 
function of the position?  Either would presumably provide research and vision.
 But
 
would they in fact be competing over the control of activities relating to the
 
collections.
 Of course one would hope that a university position would attract
 
students whose activities would increase use of the collections; but the Folklife
 
Center already attracts each year as many students,  interns,  and junior fellows as
 
2
 
we can find space to allow,  and the Library at large also has a growing program of
 
support for independent scholars and researchers using the collections.
 
d.  It is worth mentioning at this point that the Parsons Fund is an
 
endowed fund within the American Folklife Center that supports the work of
 
independent researchers on Center collections.
 That fund is presently small,  but it
 
will eventually become large by receiving the total assets of a trust fund presently
 
supporting the widow of the Parsons Fund's founding donor.
 
e.  It should also be mentioned that the Library does not follow the
 
custom of many universities and cultural institutions,  by charging endowed funds
 
with overhead and development expenses.
 The Library of Congress Trust Fund Board is
 
a distinguished array of government officials and citizens from private life who are
 
charged by law with managing the investments of funds.
 The expenses are negligible.
 
The funds may be invested either in government bonds or in public equities,  and one
 
may project an income on invested funds comparable to a conservative investment in
 
today's financial markets.
 
2. Accruisition of the Archives.
 
a. Regarding the proposed purchase of the Archives,  it has been typical
 
for major acquisitions by the Library -
-
 the Bernstein Collection is a good recent
 
example -
-
 to be structured as a combination of a purchase by the Library and a gift
 
by the donor.
 We should explore gift-purchase arrangements with regard to the Lomax
 
Archives.
 
b.  The Library is certainly interested in discussing "development
 
rights" to the Global Jukebox,  with which we are familiar based on viewings on
 
several occasions over the years,  as well as to the related Urban Strain concept
 
described in your proposal.
 If the Library were to undertake joint development of
 
the Global Jukebox with you,  it could potentially bring considerable resources to
 
bear on the effort.
 The National Digital Library Project is,  as you know,  a rapidly
 
growing enterprise.
 It receives significant funding through a partnership of
 
Congressionally appropriated and private funds,  and the Library's Development Office
 
is already geared to fundraising for digital online programming.
 The current
 
figures for use of the Library's Website are,  to us at least,  little short of
 
astonishing.
 There is evidence that the international usership is growing, making
 
it a worldwide source of cultural information.
 We believe these assets are ideally
 
suited to the worldwide scope and educational focus of the Global Jukebox.
 We
 
recognize,  however, that it will take further discussion to establish whether the
 
Global Jukebox is best developed jointly or independently.
 In either case,  the
 
Library will want to participate in the ultimate task of sharing the Global Jukebox
 
as a global research,  cultural,  and educational resource.
 
3. Development and Dissemination.
 
a. As noted above,  the Library is strongly interested in the possibility
 
of joint development of the Global Jukebox -
-
 including fundraising efforts
 
necessary to its proper completion and dissemination.
 It seems important,  at this
 
point,  for us to discuss the strategy for dissemination of the Global Jukebox.
 We
 
gather there has been an inclination on the part of your office to plan for a
 
strategy of producing individual kiosks that could be situated at research libraries
 
and cultural centers.
 Our National Digital Library Project has explored the
 
possibility of similar limited-access diffusion of digitized materials,  and it may
 
be an attractive strategy in certain situations -
-
 particularly if rights issues are
 
3
 
a problem in global dissemination,  or if dissemination is linked to a revenue
 
strategy.
 But NDL has for the most part inclined to a strategy of global
 
dissemination via World Wide Web,  believing that it has a wider and deeper
 
educational and cultural impact.
 
b. We are well acquainted with the 100-plus CD series,  The Alan Lomax
  
Collection, on Rounder Records.
 The early issues have been well produced and well
 
received,  and you and your team richly deserve the success you have had in launching
 
this important series.
 We are already in discussion with your team about
 
coordination and cooperation in production of the CDs in the series that involve
 
Library collections.
 Presumably the series should maintain its identity,  even if
 
the Lomax Archives are acquired by the Library.
 But acquisition of the Archives
 
opens up interesting possibilities,  such as extending the series in the future to
 
include other Lomax recordings currently in the Library's collections.
 We are
 
already working with Rounder on a reissue series of the Library's historic recorded
 
publications,  and discussions are under way for a series of new releases.
 Our
 
discussions regarding your proposal should focus on how to integrate these
 
activities effectively without losing the important identity of the Alan Lomax
 
Collection CD series.
 
c.  The other items proposed for production are also interesting to us.
 
We should discuss each individually as we consider their timetable,  cost,  and
 
priority in the plan for the future.
 
4.  Curatorship.  
We are very supportive of the proposal for creating a curatorship.
 
Indeed, we believe it appropriate to consider a permanent curatorship for a
 
collection of this magnitude.
 Your proposal that you serve as curator for five
 
years likewise seems attractive to us.
 We are grateful for your longterm commitment
 
to the labor and guidance necessary for carrying out the vision of this proposal.
 
Our discussions should focus on the particulars of the plan for the curatorship,  and
 
on the possible sources of funding for it.
 We believe there may be some interesting
 
longterm possibilities here.
 
5.  Preservation and Access.
 
a.  It is reasonable to think of preservation and access as a Library
 
responsibility.
 The Library has a large general budget for preservation,  as well as
 
budget and other resources for facilitating reference and online access.
 Library
 
expertise in this field is, we believe, very advanced compared to most universities
 
and cultural institutions.
 
b.  It is useful to distinguish between "physical transfer," which may
 
happen over a period of time,  and "legal transfer," which can happen any time in
 
advance of physical transfer.
 Using the Library's appropriated funds and other
 
resources for preservation will depend on the prior legal transfer of the collection
 
to the Library.
 In any case, the Library will hope to arrive at an understanding in
 
which legal transfer of ownership precedes,  rather than follows, most of the
 
activities we all envision.
 
C.  The proposal for managing some of the preservation work in advance of
 
physical transfer to the Library is worth our considering.
 Off-site preservation
 
work is certainly possible,  and it may be that certain activities could be carried
 
out very efficiently in the present offices.
 However,  some preservation work may
 
4
 
require the technical expertise of the Library's own in-house staff,  and of course
 
the Library must maintain oversight for any preservation work for which it provides
 
funding.
 Our discussions should elaborate further the useful plan and breakdown by
 
format in your proposal.
 
d.  The concept of multiple copies presented in your proposal resembles
 
the Library's system of producing what we refer to as "preservation copies" and
 
"reference copies."
 I am sure we can formulate a mutually satisfactory plan
 
suitable for each medium with regard to such copies.
 
e. We are quite willing to consider return of copies of materials to the
 
communities of origin,  as suggested in your proposal.
 In fact, we have done
 
precisely that in our very successful Federal Cylinder Project, which, with the
 
generous support of The Ford Foundation and other funding sources,  has returned
 
copies of thousands of wax cylinder field recordings to American Indian communities.
 
6. Research and Traininq.
 
a. As noted above,  the American Folklife Center has a small fund,  which
 
will become a large fund at some later date, to support visiting researchers and
 
scholars using our collections.
 In addition, the Library's Office of Scholarly
 
Programs is now in new and capacious quarters in the Jefferson Building and hopes to
 
expand our institutional capacity to serve (and in some cases fund)  outside
 
researchers.
 Any additional funding dedicated specifically to the Lomax collections
 
will be welcome,  and we will happily join with you in the search for such funds.
 
b. Regarding the training programs envisioned in your proposal,  the
 
Folklife Center has a history of organizing training programs in documentation
 
techniques, which are broadly analogous to some of the training programs you
 
suggest.
 
c.  The fellowships for professionals to return copies of the materials
 
in the collection and to use them to stimulate local cultural activities likewise
 
are an attractive concept.
 Our analogy,  as noted earlier,  is our Federal Cylinder
 
Project.
 However, that project had an ongoing project team rather than supporting
 
the work through fellowships.
 We can discuss further these issues of program
 
tactics.
 
d.  In general, we see no reason not to join you in such efforts and to
 
work cooperatively with any program, whether inside or outside the Library,  which
 
involves legitimate public use of the collections.
 
7
. Administration. 
a. We understand your need to support the administrative costs of your
 
office in the transition.
 We should discuss how much funding it would require,  for
 
how many years,  and whether it must be endowed or could simply be on a year-by-year
 
funding basis.
 We have found it harder to secure endowed funds for administrative
 
costs -
-
 especially in a transitional circumstance such as is envisioned here.
 
Funders seem more interested either in high-profile projects,  such as the Global
 
Jukebox, or in permanent endowment,  such as we are envisioning for the curatorship
 
of the collection.
 Perhaps in discussion we can explore some alternative models for
 
accomplishing this goal.
 
5
 
8.  Physical Space and Equipment.
 
a. Naming a separate room for individuals has been for the Library a
 
very unusual step,  and when it has occurred the person honored has always been a
 
major financial donor.
 But we are certainly supportive of the kiosk concept you
 
mention,  as well as other exhibits and displays that give Alan Lomax honor and
 
visibility.
 (Perhaps we should also find ways to acknowledge your grandfather, who
 
is also closely associated with our own history.)
 There are yet other possibilities
 
for heightening public visibility that we should discuss as part of the overall plan
 
we develop.
 
b. We believe strongly that the unique ethnographic collections that
 
form the heart of the Alan Lomax Archives should be kept together, processed
 
together,  and serviced together.
 The Library would approach all our discussions
 
with these working assumptions.
 Such a treatment honors the proper ethnographic
 
unity of the collection and allows for certain synergies that would be lost if the
 
collection were divided.
 We are less passionate about extending the same principle
 
to published books and recordings.
 The 78-rpm commercial records,  for example,
 
could stay with the unique ethnographic collections; or they could be interfiled
 
with similar commercial collections in our Motion Picture,  Broadcasting and Recorded
 
Sound Division, where many users would logically go in search of,  say,  a particular
 
hillbilly or blues disc known to have been released in the 1940s.
 We are open to
 
your thoughts on this issue.
 In any case,  however, we would strive to preserve,
 
catalog,  and service the collections as a total entity, maintaining always the
 
connection to Alan Lomax as the source.
 
c. We note that there will be additional longterm administrative costs
 
in maintaining separate physical space and equipment if the Library does not embrace
 
all the activities envisioned by your office.
 That,  in our opinion,  is a strong
 
argument for an approach that fully integrates the collections and the other
 
activities within the Library's aegis.
 
9. Conclusion. 
We at the Library recognize that the scope of your proposal is very
 
broad and comprehensive,  as you yourself suggest.
 But we want to convey our belief
 
that these goals are not simply laudable, but doable with careful planning,
 
energetic fundraising,  and a concerted collective effort on all our parts.
 We
 
believe that your vision can be accomplished,  and we are eager to begin serious,
 
detailed discussioné about how we can do it togethor.
 
Please give my warm regards to Alan.
