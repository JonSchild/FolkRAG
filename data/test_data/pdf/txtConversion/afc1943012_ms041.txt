Dear Dr. Botkin:
I was happy to receive your letter stating the possibility of borrowing the Fisk University
recording machine for use at our August Festival. I shall investigate this possibility at once
and let you know the outcome. I regret to say, however, that I do not have too much hope
in the matter.
Everything is going very well. I have made arrangements to carry some singers up to
Macon where we have been fortunate to arrange to have some records cut at station
WMAZ. I assure you that I will do all that I can to have something of value for you. May I
also say that we are having our recording machine repaired in Macon and I am hoping for
the best results. I shall let you know about these results. Will you please be kind enough
to inform my friend Lewis Jones that I have never heard from him. Indicate to him strongly
that I am expecting to hear from him.
With every good wish, I am
