I Yoke up a Pig
I YOKED UP A PIG (Same as - The Reason Why That Women Is Wiser Than Men and
Farmer's Curst Wife) 5115 B1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
I yoked up a pig in order to plow I broke the ground the devil knows how That's twice fi-
dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
The devil he come to me one day Says one of your family I'll carry away That's twice fi-
dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day
You can't have my oldest son This farm my hardest works begun That's twice fi-dum fi-
diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
You can have my scolding wife But you can't keep her to save your life That's twice fi-dum
fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
He wagged her up all on his back Just like a dutch peddler a-carryin' his pack That's twice
fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
The first she met was Beelzebub She knocked him in the head with a great big club That's
twice fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
He carried her on to Hell's own gate And there he bid her to walk on straight That's twice
fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
Nine little devils peeped over the wall Says take her back or she'll murder us all That's
twice fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.

He wagged her up all on his back And like a darn fool come waggin' her back That's twice

When she got there we was all in bed She up with a breadpan and batted our head That's
twice fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
The old man went whistling over the hill If the devil won't have her I don't know who will
That's twice fi-dum fi-diddle fi-dum Fi-dum fi-diddle fi-day.
