There is a 
little lady that keeps a 
grocery store, 
The number is nine, Bowery, below Grand; 
She is a 
little beauty the one that I 
adore, 
And her mother keeps a 
little oyster stand. 
I 
go to see her evenings, to hear her play and sing, 
For she is the girl to entertain a 
gent; 
For playing on the harp, the whole town knows she's 
smart, 
For she,'s a 
girl of great accomplishment. 
CHORUS. 
She plays the piano., 
the, harp and concertina, 
And in a 
ball room you should see her whirl; 
She sings Ernmet's Lullaby, llascott and Josephine, 
What a 
little treasure is my Bowery girl. 
You ought to see her evenings, way out at Rockaway 
Bathing in the surf and on the beach: 
She gives an exhibition in her wet weather clothes, 
And how the female highbred ladies screech. 
She's a 
lady of the town and she wears her own night 
gown, • 
-When she dives under water I 
see her curl; 
When she sinks within the bottom why the under-
ground is rotten, 
What a 
Flew-ar-er comes from my sweet Bowery 
girl,

'Twas in the golden summer days 
We met beside the brook, 
The birds were singing happy lays 
In every shady nook. 
But sweeter far than songs of birds 
The gentle voice that fell, 
And what was told in whispered words 
I 
should not care to tell. 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
'And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow. 
CHORUS. • 
rDown beside those silver streams, ( Break.) 
Have we lingered in happy dreams; (Break.) 
,The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow. ( Dance.) 
Twilight shades were in the sky 
Before we bade adieu; 
I 
heard a 
tender little sigh, 
And knew one heart was true. 
The little birds had gone to sleep, 
Soft dew-drops kissed the flowers, 
And never stars began to peep 
On h^ppier hearts than ours. 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow. 
Down beside, &c.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by F. T. 
W ARD. M USIC 
by Wm. B. W OOD. Sung by 
LAMONT and DUCROW with great success. 
Oh my love she is the sweetest in the land, 
In her stylish way she looks grand. 
I'm bound in love to wed her 
On some future day, and there's my hand. 
For her loving smile it lingers with me yet, 
While in the park the other day we met ; 
Those loving words she whispered 
I 
neter shall forget. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the honey-comb, 
Her heart seems light and free, 
And when I 
pop the question, 
What joy and ecstacy 
If she vows she'll have me— 
How happy then I'll be. 
Now I've told her all and asked her to be mine, 
She gave consent, we've set the time. 
And now we live together 
Like turtle doves so gentle and so kind. 
Oh my heart is filled with joy, I 
feel so gay, 
That she has named the wedding day; 
Now won't we both be happy 
As singing birds in May. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the honey-comb, 
Our hearts are light and free ; 
And soon we will be married, 
Oh how happy then we'll be— 
And soon we will be married 
And live in ecstacy. 
Too much Rumbling in them Clouds. 
END SONG. 
Sung by LAMONT and DUCROW with big success all through the West. 
Every time I 
go from home 
I 
comb my hair with the old jaw bone ; 
I 
grease my hair with candle grease 
And I 
slick and slid on the mantle-piece. 
• 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my lord Timbo! 
Oh, good lord Timbo! 
There's too much rumbling in them clouds, 
There's too much rumbling in them clouds ! 
Lord, lord, I 
can't go yonder! 
Lord, lord, I 
can't go yonder! 
There's too much rumbling in them c 
ouds, 
There's too much rumbling in them clouds ! 
Every night I 
go to bed 
I 
pull the clothes all over my head; 
There I 
lay and sneeze and snore, 
Until the old man knocks at the bed room door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, get up Timbo! oh, come along Timbo! 
There's too much rumbling in them cloudi I 
There's too much rumbling, & c. 
Written, composed and sung by BONNIE RUNNELLS With great 
success. 
There is a 
sweet town, Hoboken is the name, 
It's noted for bed- bugs, mosquitos for fame; 
They wait till the night-time when you get in bed, 
And they sing Billy Taylor all round your poor head. 
Cuonus, 
They're always a 
biting, and never stop fighting; 
They sting you like lightning, and your nose they are 
lighting; 
They'll never stop biting, but always keep fighting; 
These sweet little birds of Hoboken. 
One night T 
was sitting and reading the news, 
When one came a 
waltzing away with my shoes; 
lie came back for my socks and he found them so loud, 
He -was bound for to have them so he brought the whole 
crowd. 
I 
made up my mind to catch these young scamps, 
With two guns in my hand and a 
kerosene lamp: 
And before I 
retired I 
got down for to pray, 
And they took guns and lamp and they whistled good day. 
Now take my advice when you go to that town, 
Just cover your head with your mother's night-gown; 
Just put a 
free lunch at the head of your bed, 
With some St. Jacob's oil and you'll find them all dead.

STOP THE TIDE FROM GOING OUT. 
—:0: 
EDWIN TALBOT'S latest success. 
Composed and written by EDWIN 
TALBOT. Sung by Tom SAYERS with great success at the Lon-
don Theatre, N. 
Y. 
(): 
This life is like a 
river 
A running in and out, 
This year a 
man may be quite poor, 
And next year have money to count; 
The man who is the banker now, 
Next year may be the tramp; • 
A 
traveling in the snow and rain, 
With clothing ragged and damp; 
Perhaps a 
fast life he lead, 
And, perplexed with doubt, 
He didn't watch the breakers 
When the tide was going out. 
CHORUS: 
So now take heed to what I 
say, 
Be careful do not doubt, 
For you'll find it very difficult, 
To stop the tide from going out. 
Then if we want to be successful, 
And lead a 
happy life, 
We must meet trouble halfway, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
We must work with honest labor, 
Always scorning every scamp; 
And if prosperity shines upon us, 
help the poor and needy tramp; 
We will never miss the nickel 
That we give with hand stretched out; 
And some day it will come back to us, 
When the tide is going out.

Oh, my gracious! let me look round, 
I 
look in dis morning's paper lost and found; 
Mr. Levy lost his cornet down at Manhattan Beach 
While trying to eat some swcet oil salad, piekeled eel's 
feet and beets. 
" 
For vy is de reason," said Levy, " the sky overhead is 
clouded? "

Irish is crowded.

money and friends, 
Dot was before I 
got wealthy, and lightning struck rue 
every two minutes dead. 
I

bread, 
On Jill-to us of coal I 
shoveled till my back was sore and 
asleep, 
A.nd spiders crawled into my whiskers, and huckelberries 
grew on my big feet 
You clink dat Zubrinski's my cousin, I'm a

I

We have made over one hundred and thirty-three dol-

Went down to the Slaughter-House, 
To see Bill kill a 
Calf; 
He sharpened the axe on a 
hickory stone, 
And made the cows all laugh; 
lie hit 'ern plumb upon the head, 
And split 'era up the backs; 
his little brother Harry cried, 
And hollered out Nick Nax, 
CHORUS: 
Nick Nax don't shave the pigs, 
But give 'em carpet tacks; 
The best thing out to cure the blues, 
Is to come and see Nick :N.Tax. 
A nigger went up in a 
balloon 
Balanced by a 
nail; 
He met old Jonah in the clouds, 
With a 
warrant for the Whale; 
The balloon busted, landed on a 
church, 
And struck the nigger in the back; 
He lowered himself with a 
spool of thread, 
And shouted out Nick Nax.

in the ebening by de moonlight, when dis darkey's wolk 
was over, 
We would gather round de fire, till de hoe-cake it was 
done; 
Den we all would eat our supper, after dat we'd clear de 
kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare, to bob a 
little fun; 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down, dat hung upon de 
wall, 
While de silvery moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by the moonlight. 
Cnonus: 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear us darkies 
singing, 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear de banjo 
ringing; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In de ebening by de moonlight, when de watch-dog would 
be sleeping, 
In de corner near de fire-place, beside de old arm-chair; 
Whar Aunt Chloe used to sit and tell de piccaninnies sto-
ries, 
And de cabin would be filled wid' merry coons from near 
and far; 
All dem happy times we used to hab, will ne'er returii 
again, 
Eb'rything was then so merry, gay and bright; 
And I 
neber will forget it, when our daily toil was ober, 
how we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
lie is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his livg stealing pie. 
Chorus. 
(Chorus), 
They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
He's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup.

Jons IVALsii, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borne, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarstield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
Tf we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made theruselveu 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their sty1.; 5 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day ; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain ; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again ; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Come to your laddie once again ;

THE GEM OF THE SEA. 
Written by PAT REILLY. 
0 .-
With all condescension I'd turn your attention, 
To what I 
would mention of Erin so green; 
And without hesitation, I'd show bow that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
It happened one morning without any warning, 
That Venus was born in the beautiful sea, 
And be that same token, aad sure 'was prevoking, 
Her pinions were soaking and would not give play, 
Till Neptune who knew her began to pursue her 
In order to woo her, the wicked old Jew; 
And he very nigh caught her on the top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter who cried philaloo. 
So jove, the great genius looked down and saw Venus, 
And Neptune so heinous pursuing her wild; 
So he roared out in thunder I'd tear him asunder, 
And sure 'twas no wonder for teasing his child. 
So a 
star that was flying around him aspiring, 
lie seized without sighing and burled it below, 
Where it tumbled like winking on Neptune while 
sinking, 
And gave him I'm thinking a 
broth of a 
blow, 
That star was dryland both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the land of my birth; 
Thus plain is the story, case sent down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary is a 
heaven on earth, 
So Venus jumped neatly on Erin so stately, 
But fainted case lately so bothered and pressed; 
Which much did bewilder but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That glass so victorious it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might proove; 
Hence how can ye's blame us that Erin's so famous, 
For beauty and murder and whiskey and love. 
Words and music by J. L. BARRETT. 
Dedicated to JOHN W ALSH. 
Sung by FERGUSON and MACE., 
at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
On the 15th of September, 
We dressed up neat and gay; 
For to join a 
grand procession, 
We at once set on our way; 
There were tinkers, tailors, scavengers 
And ladies short and tall; 
All went to see the opening 
Of our lovely City Hall. 
There was Mr. Michael Murphy, 
With a 
bran new suit of clothes; 
That was made by Johnny Doherty, 
Whom everybody knows; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there, 
As dacent as could be; 
But there wasn't one in all the lot, 
Could equal him or me. 
Cuonus• 
Did you see the two Malones, 
With their shining, bran new hats? 
Did you see them marching off 
Like two young aristocrats? 
There were flags and banners waving high, 
And dress in style was shown; 
But the greatest swells in all the lot, 
Was Pat. and Tim Malone. 
The Mayor, upon the City Hall steps, 
Quite stately took his stand; 
He noticed none till we came by, 
And then he waved his hand; 
He saw at once the style was there, 
For he stared with both his eyes; 
As if he thought we were some lords 
Or dukes dressed in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, 
Till I 
thought we'd never stop; 
So I 
fell out, and then fell into 
Magee's to take a 
drop; 
The people there were talking of 
The sights they saw that day; 
We felt a 
little flattered 
When we heard the women say— (Chorus} 
We received an invitation 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
Witho,:A our evening dress suits, 
We couldn't go at all; 
Mr. Doherty, the tailor, 
Our measure couldn't take; 
Because, for Owney Geoghegan, sure, 
He had a 
suit to make. 
So we both went down to Baxter Street, 
Bought new suits, second hand; 
With a 
piece of shamrock in our hats, 
We looked a 
trifle grand; 
We danced about till Midnight, 
And when home in the dark, 
You could scarcely walk a 
foot, 
When you'd hear some one remark—(Cho.) 
Beautiful waltz song written expressly for PAT REILLY by " James 
O'Neil." Music published and copyrighted by E. H. Harding, 
229 Bowery. 
I'm a 
masher among the shop girls, 
I 
carry on business down-town; 
Every morning at eight me breakfast I 
eat, 
With coffee and doughnuts done brown. 
The ladies they all at me smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style; 
And the boys on the street when ever I 
meet, 
Say how do you do Boquet Doyle. 
CHORUS. 
Boquets I 
wear in my coat, 
Dasies and Posies and Pink and White roses, 
With Perfume I'm ready to choke, 
Oh! carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn, 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park, 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street, 
I 
always do give him a 
dime. 
Sung by Mum.ny & MILES. 
Written by " Mr. John Murphy," and 
dedicated to " Burk & Bligh." 
Sure our story is of a 
lovely little fairy, 
Who milks the cows upon her father's farm; 
And the lovely name she bears is pretty Mary, 
And her roguish eyes is like a 
charm. 
She's far prettier than the best picture ever painted, 
Purer than the lilies or the rose; 
The envy of all young lovers' hearts 
Is the fairest flower that grows. 
CHORUS: 
When the shades of evening fall, we tarry,—Break. 
And the angel of my heart I'm going to marry.—Break. 
We're as happy as two doves that live in the mansion, 
Or the rich that wear the finest clothes; 
The joy and treasure of ray heart; 
Is the fairest flower that grows. 
There will be a 
happy time when we are married, 
It will be merry moments of our life; 
To think of the girl we loved and would have mar-
ried, 
And settled down and led a 
happy life. 
If we live to be a 
jolly aged couple, 
We'll see that the old back gate is closed; 
When the moon shines bright, we'll kiss good- night, 
To the fairest flower that grows. 
A 
Serenade. 
Written by AucniE DELMANING, and sung by "THE DELMANING." 
Oh, the moon is out to-night, 
Sweet Irene; 
And my heart beats with delight, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
am lingering by the well, 
And I've something sweet to tell, 
When we wander through the dell, 
Sweet Irene. 
CHORUS: 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.,) dear Irene, ( Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me datling, thou art mine; 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.), dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me dearest, thou art mine. 
Underneath the old oak tree, 
Sweet Irene; 
I 
have whispered love to thee, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
said, I'd be here at eight, 
Down by the garden gate, 
For your answer to await, 
Sweet Irene.

)11, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
ks she sweetly smiled she set me NNT.d, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrite, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
Hoiv my heart it beat, she looked so swoot, 
Oh, I 
never can forget ; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true ? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dose in clover over there. 
With sweet laughing eyes, tic.

The hit of the season. 
Kind friends just listen now to us, 
And well sing to you a 
rhyme, 
And tell you of our youthful days, 
When we were in our prime. 
We're getting old, yes very old, 
And soon must pass away, 
We've traveled on life's weary road, 
With spirits always gay. 
CHORUS-
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
A 
jollier old pair you'll seldom find— 
Than Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
'Tis now some sixty years ago 
Since we first joined our lot, 
And in that time there's nothing wrong 
Transpired in our cot. 
We've had our share of sunshine, 
And of course we can't complain; 
Them -r,00d old days that's passed and gone, 
'Jan lever come back again. 
As sung by WILL SMITH, With BAIRD'S MINSTRELS. 
I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dettr but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
scarcely ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many time,: I 
gee 
A 
dark'ning sI

:0: 
One pleasant morning for recreation, 
And in meditation for to spend the day, 
With a 
congregation of my own relations, 
I 
went meandering adown Broadway. 
Like ladies shopping, each bar we would stop in, 
For to take a 
drop in for to make us gay, 
When a 
policeman nabbed me, and as he grabbed me, 
He says, old man youv'e been led astray. 
Wi,th great vexation and botheration, 
Me to the station he then dragged along, 
With consternation and indignation, 
I 
was the sole attraction of all the throng, 
But I 
wasn't long getting to where the judge was sitting, 
And he looked over at me in a 
serious way, 
Yara, says I 
don't mind me, but by gob he tined me, 
And says he old man, you have been led astray. 
Then with humiliation awl botheration, 
To my habitation, I 
then took my way, 
And with great vexation as to what narration, 
Would drive the anger of my wife away, 
I 
met her standing upon the landing, 
And the broom a 
handling in a 
trireatuing way, 
With a 
profound ovation upon dissipation, 
Says I, stop it darling, you have been led astray. 
Then I 
felt a 
pushing and I 
heard a 
rushing, 
And a 
great concussion like a 
heavy fall, 
Then madly stumbling and blindly tumbling, 
Bang! I 
went up against the wall. 
I 
looked all over for to discover, 
What tramp or loafer had been used that way, 
It soon was shown me, that down stairs she threw me, 
And I 
knew by gorra, I 
was led astray.

His shirt is very " tricky," lardy dah! lardy dahl

WORDS By SAMUEL N. 
M ITCHELL. 
M USIC BY HARRY LEIGHTON. 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of old, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
The eyes that were so fair and bright, 
Still shed for me their loving light, 
And on your lips I 
plainly see 
The smile that's always dear to me. 
CHORILS. 
When silver locks replace theigold, 
I'll love ypu, darling, as orold, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
And love with some is growing old, 
I'll cling to you with all my heart, 
And death alone our love shall part; 
Thy face no more with ruby glows, 
The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as dear, 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear. 
When silver locks, 
When silver locks replace the, gold, 
Our stories oft will be retold, 
And in life's last declining rays 
We'll catch a 
glimpse of other days ; 
The hands that clasped each other true, 
The olden vigor will renew, 
And ' till life's busy dream is o'er 
I'll love you, darling, all the more. 
When silver looks, be.

original play of the Rising Man. 
Copyrighted We, by A. J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., New York. 
Old country people say, 
Where there's will there is a 
way, 
So I've kept it in my memory all the while; 
Throwing care unto the dogs., 
Oh I 
bundled up my togs, 
And sailed away from Erin's lovely isle; 
To America in the west. 
Of nations she's the best. 
Then take advice my countrymen, 
And listen to my plan: 
Save your money, buy a 
passage, 
Cross the western ocean; 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
risin— man; 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man; 
Oh the land is mighty broad, 
With the divil a 
duke or lord 
To make you bend your knee to his rule; 
Where your children have a 
chance 
In learning to advance, 
Free education there in any school; 
poor old Ireland, oh-oh-hone, 
I 
have heard your people moan.1 
They have suffered sad privation 
Ever since the world began; 
Throw of the yoke of tyranny, 
Come over to uncle Samuel, 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man. 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man. 
Oh the day lc drawing near, 
When a 
signal you shall hear 
Which will send a 
thrill of gladness o'er the see; 
As a 
million Irish hearts, 
From kmerica departs, 
'Twill make the lion tremble in his knee; 
With money and with brains 
To handle all the reins, 
Ready for to fight it out, 
Or settle it with the pen. 
So take advice my countrymen, 
And cross the western °coal, 
Be an American citizen 
And join the rising mes. 
Be an American citizen, 
And join the rising men.

RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their tight. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Hc2,vens glad shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, Ito. -

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W IT.TAAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
alit now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
A3 children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc. 
Pull Yourselves Together, Boys. 
Originally sung by M ISS ELLA W ESNER. 
We're all of us bothered sometime in our lives, 
By something that's sure to go wrong, 
With us our children, our sweethearts and wivet. 
As life's road we journey along. 
That troubles are hard I

Though afterwards they appear small ; 
And I 
will endeavor to show in my rhyme, 
A 
way to get over them all. 
SPOKE-N.—And that is to— 
CHORUS. 
Pull yourselves together, boys, 
Pull yourselves together, 
Never mind the knock down blows, 
But pull yourselves together. 
'Tis nice when your cupboard is scanty and bare 
To have hungry visitors call, 
And say they've popp'd in your small dinner to share 
But hope you won't mind them at all; 
The last bob has vanished for victuals and drink, 
And so has your credit as well ; 
You treat them as friends, but in frenzy you think. 
That it is a 
terrible sell. 
Svcs:Ex.—Still, nevertheless! you must--
Pull yourselves, ke. 
'Tis nice when you borrow and pay Interest large, 
To be just a 
little behind; 
And go home and find broker's men are in charge, 
And taking your goods--never mind— 
Your furniture, worth more than treble your debt, 
Is seized by these scoundrels, but they 
Will find to their cost there are Magistrates yet, 
Who'll make the rogues heavily pay. 
Pull yourselves, &e. 
It's rapture when out until three or 'till four, 
'Unknown to your wife, on the spree, 
To find that the chain is put up on the door, 
And you have forgotten the key. 
It's nice when you serve on a 
jury, to find, 
Your tailor sits next door but one, 
And he is a 
Claimant but law! never mind, 
All trials will some day be done.

YOU MAY KISS AND CARESS ME. 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAM. 
Now I'm going to sing a 
little song, the tune you've heard 
before, 
'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a 
lean banana core, 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I 
asked her for her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
CHORUS: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no; 
Buy me a 
Tom and Jerry, a 
keg of beer or so, 
But don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la in lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss me you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say: 
CHORUS: 
You may kiss me and caress me and I'll never say nix, 
Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll strike you with a 
brick; 
You may chew my alabaster ear, I'll never make a 
kick, 
But don't you tell my sister.

That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door.

They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make 'ern sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a

The Captain of Police kr to sleep in the

Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, Esq. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I

I

I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from

And let people sleep in the drums of my ears.

am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lum and Bud Granger were 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, he is mashed on Charlotte

He is the pretty boy that came from Baltimore. 
Papa's Chest Protector's Faded. 
Written by DAN COLLYER., and sung with great succees. 
Papa's chest protector's faded, 
Lost the color on his chest; 
Faded now for once and ever, 
From the sweat caused by his vest; 
Oh, the many years he's worn it, 
Never has it seen a 
change; 
How our bull-pup slept upon it, 
And from it he's caught the mange. 
CHORIJS: 
Papa, papa, darling papa, 
Don't spread your mug at me with wrath; 
For it's true that you've grown lighter, 
Since you took that Turkish bath. 
Think of when you had the jim-jams, 
How I 
never left your bed; 
How I 
hired Tom Jones, the Cooper, 
To put a 
hoop around your head; 
Oh, my gall, how you do flutter, 
For, of chest protectors, when I 
think 
How you've oft protected papa, 
When he's braced men for a 
drink. 
CHORUS: 
Pap, you darling, old brace, papa, 
At hoisting schooners you're the boss; 
But your nose is growing brighter, 
Since you've been budging at O'Rourke.

OH I 
FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE M EEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my , girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. I 
said. all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, she 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. . 
DIALOGUE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with you, makft 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus). 
MAT 
TIE DEAR. 
Written for PAT REILLY by" Chas. Connelly," and sung by him with 
great success. 
Music to be had at " Hardings." 
Soft I 
sing of Mattie, dear, 
Sweetest young maiden far or near; 
Dearest yet, she's my pet, 
Warming up my heart so queer. 
On the fires of love that lie 
In the sweet corners of her eye, 
Oh, I'm gone, I'm killed with joy, 
About my Mattie,  dear. 
ClIORUS: 
Mattie mine, girl so fine,—Sym. 
Dearest yet, she's my pet.—Sym. 
She's the belle, the daisy grand, 
Sure she's the Queen of Ireland; 
On my royal head I'd stand, 
For my sweet Mattie, dear. 
In a 
dry good's store below, 
Juggling silks and calico; 
All the day there she'll stay, 
Wasting her sweet life away. 
Oh, if I 
had gold in store, 
I 
would let her work no more; 
For it's in a 
birdie's cage, 
I'd put my Mattie, dear.

Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
Bhe never will he false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie bills across the sea; 
And though far away I 
roam, ah! I 
know there is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
I'll come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying for you; 
Of all this world so fair I 
am loving you the best, 
And your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
Af." 
sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
/..rit we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the st irs and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
Ae cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

Sung with great success by W. FRED AYMAR, America's Grotesque 
Clown and Comic Vocalist. 
Mrs. Brady, a 
widow lady, 
Has a 
daughter that I 
adore; 
I 
go to court her, across the water, 
Every Sunday afternoon at four; 
She sings so sweetly, she dresses so neatly. 
So like a 
fairy she trips the floor; 
She's good society, she's full of piety, 
And her mother keeps a 
little candy store. 
CHORUS: 
Dainty feet, measured beat, 
Trips the street; oh! so neat; 
Dresses sweet, what a 
treat, 
And her mother keeps a 
candy store; 
Her name is Norah, I 
do adore her, 
She's like an angel, my heart is. so sore; 
She's like a 
daisy, she sets me crazy, 
And her mother keeps a 
little cOndy store. 
(Dance). 
Every Sunday, and every Monday, 
With the family I 
go to dine; 
And the daughter, I 
do escort her, 
Every evening till the clock strikes nine; 
One Summer evening, the moon was beaming 
I 
said I 
loved her as dear as life; 
She blushed completely and smiled so sweetly 
Yet she promised she'd be my darling wife.

My wile, she does always grumble, 
Tells me to go taxe a

If I

Always is shelter, my darling, for you; 
Here on the heart that is hiving and true 
Always is shelter, my darling, for you.

When he told me that he loved me, 
"r was the flow'ry time of May; 
I 
put roses in my ringlets, 
And went singing all the day, 
When he told me that he loved me, 
in the pleasant month of May. 
Yes; because I 
knew he loved me 
I 
went singing with the birds. 
All the day I 
listened to him, 
In my dreams I 
heard his words; 
Dreaming nightly that he loved me 
I 
was blither than the birds! 
Dreaming nightly that he loved me 
I 
was blither than the birds. 
But I 
did not know I 
loved him 
Till I 
found one Summer day 
That in telling how he loved me 
He had wiled my heart away, 
Just by saying how he loved me 
Through the long bright Summer day. 
Still he told me that he loved me 
When the roses fading fell, 
And the birds had all forgotten 
That sweet song I 
learned too well, 
For I 
love him and he loves me 
More than any words can tell, 
For I 
love him and he loves me 
More than any words can tell.

How can we bear to leave thee, 
Our noses blue with cold; 
And love, we won't deceive thee, 
Our coats are worn and old! 
The snow and rain are falling, 
There doesn't shine it star. 
While at thy window bawling, 
We strike the light " Catarrh!" 
Cnoitus 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
The Tom cat answers shrill, . 
And sweet, we won't deceive thee, 
Of serenades we've had our fill! 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
Thou breathest no reply; 
Oh snore not while we weave thee, 
A 
gentle lullaby! 
Alas! we see a 
night cap 
At yonder window pane, 
The voice of no polite chap, 
Yells: " Don't come here again!" 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
We heard the milkman's yell; 
And love we won't deceive thee, 
That was a 
brick that fell! 
Good bye, good-bye sweet darling, 
The rheumatiz we fear, 
And,hark! this copper howling;

You just git out of here! "

Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs.

"KEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
success, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum.

MICHAEL BRADY'S SHIRT. 
Composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the Ventriloquist. 
My name is Michael Brady, and I 
am not ashamed to own, 
I 
am honest and I 
am dacent if I 
am only left alone; 
But the gang that hangs around me they are a 
terrible clan, 
And when I 
moved around them I 
was like a 
crazy man. 
They roar and bawl the whole night long, with conversa-
tion strong, 
I 
haven't slept for forty nights in the house where I 
belong. 
Now the first one to kick up a 
row was Chateau Jane McGee 
If my wife don't go up and fight with her, she'll come and 
fight with me. 
She stole a 
shirt from our back yard, and gave it to her 
son Dan, 
I 
took it from his back in a 
ball-room, by the owner I 
am 
the man. 
I 
made a 
holy show of him, I 
ran him down like dirt, 
And he near goes mad when the boys all cry: " Who stole 
Mike Brady's shirt?" 
Their rooms is to let in the parlor, Italians just moved in, 
With fourteen harps and fiddlers, all dacent working min. 
What Mary McGaskin did last night, I 
swear it was a 
sin, 
She trun her thirty dish-water on the mackirony min. 
Such holy murder you never heard, since the day that you 
was born, 
Was among them darned Italians in the house where I 
belong. 
Now there's my daughter Johanna, she sings Dianne a 
• 
store, 
She goes to balls and picnics with a 
huzzy of a 
girl next 
door. 
McFarling's boy he stole a 
goat and he put it in our wood-
shed, 
If he ever does the like agin. I'll brake his father's head. 
I 
am glad I 
am going to leave them to let them bawl and 
shout, 
I'll take down the stove to-morrow and be Heavins I'll 
move out. 
Written, composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the 
Ventriloquist. 
On our back fence at twelve at night 
A 
big . buck cat, striped black and white, 
Meanders out to look for fight— 
Mali 
Fenian cat. 
With an eye IIMIZed out and ears ehawed off, 
With a 
half-mast tail and the whooping cough; 
Strange ratters thought they'd something soft 
On Mahoncy's four-act cat. 
Nu cat or dog had pluck or gaul 
To give McGuire's pup a 
fall, 
So down he went to open the ball 
With Maloney's Thomas dog. 
Out from McGuire's alley gate 
He straightway did perambulate, 
Intending to make sausage meat 
Of Mahoney's brindle cat. 
They met upon McGuire's shed, 
With hair on end and eyeballs red, 
With yells and howls 'twould raise the dead— 
The slaughter it began. 
In half the time ye'd say begob 
The air was full of McGuire's dog; 
While up and down McGuire's fence, 
The picture of pure innocence, 
Mahoney's cat sas-shayed. 
Then from the roof a 
brick was fired, 
I'd take me oath it was _ leGuire; 
It struck the cat between the eyes, 
And down he went, but he didn't rise. 
There's a 
statue where this hero lies— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat. 
Composed by EDWIN TALBOT. Sung by BONNIE RENNELLS. 
Air—John Riley's Always Dry. 
I 
have a 
fine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Jitney she loves me; 
Her throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all 
her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
CHORUS: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and nay; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on the table and cry 
My son Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry, 
It's only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
It's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye, 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
Her mother often told me, when I 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, just look you in my eye, 
'Tis a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. 
COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. J. FisnER. 
Sung with great success by LESTER 14.; W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob- tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
lie was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu! 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
lie might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
he'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
his feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and did, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CI:routs: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
his overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

He'll always fill the can, 
And when ye seek for blooded stock, 
Dan Maloney is the man. 
Cnonus: 
Maloney's my man, now don't he look gran::? 
He is down here to-night wid his cronies; 
At raffle or wake, sure he'll take the cake 
No man in the world is like Maloney. 
Sure he is no day labonr, 
His debts he'll always pay; 
He hires all his men himself 
At five dollars a 
day. 
Now when the politicians 
They need a 
helping hand, 
They send for Dan for well they know 
Dan Maloney is the man,

THE SOUTH FIFTH AVE. RANGES. 
Sung in " Dan Maloney's Raffle," by MAGGIE W ESTON. 
The daisy soldier coons are we, 
The rangers file away, 
A 
rare battalion of renown, 
Can fight as well as play; 
Oh! the sweetest admiration 
is the glance of every lass, 
When tramping by with elegant step, 
The South Fifth Rangers pass. 
Boldly we tramp away without a 
fear, 
Scowling as though we wished the foe was near, 
On to the field we march away so wild, 
It's cannons that we ought to bear 
Instead of muskets mild. 
CHORUS.

No lonely privates fill our ranks, 
We are colonels every one, 
And no one on St. Patrick's day, 
Can make these Rangers run? 
With our feet of wondrous strength, 
And our head upheld so high, 
We'll bust the gizzards of the gals 
When us yaller coons go by.

Pass all us warriors bold behind the calcium light, 
Bent low with prizes grabbed, and clutched, and wos 
Alive with home-made glory,

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
1-11114PTY DIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
11 is a Pac simile of a Trick practiced by all. 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thauraaturgic order 
has been sent us, called `1117MPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
-While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand 
ling of it."—Phila. EveniniBulletin.
