Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy
INTERVIEW LOG
00:00:00  Introductions, signing of release forms, explanation of project.    
00:04:30  Name is Rose Rogers, born on May 25, 1949 in Grand Rapids, MI.  Moved to the West
Coast in 1988.  Met husband after he served in Vietnam.  Both lived in Pennsylvania for around 
17 years.  
00:05:40  When did you start doing caregiving?  Since I've had children (laughing).  Son has 
autism and bipolar.  Been employed as his caregiver since he turned eighteen; roughly twelve 
years. 
00:06:58  Previously work—odd jobs, paper route, childcare.  Worked on the 2010 Census. 
00:08:05  Her son can't care for himself.  He was in an adult transition program from the ages of 
eighteen to twenty one.  Qualified for DHS services after that.  If he was somewhere else, he 
would have to receive care.  Rose takes him to Special Olympics, other outings.  He doesn't 
understand a lot of things, but he's very good at fixing things, playing video games.     
00:10:31  Difference between being official care provider and regular parent?  It's more guidance
than parenting.  Working with the union and meeting other caregivers has been helpful.  Learned 
more about autism through the union.    
00:12:00  Union “helps us carry on.”  It's hard not to get overwhelmed.  Hopes that medications 
get better over time.  Family also provides support.  
00:13:43  Has met other parents in similar situations.  Met one woman through the union who 
was very encouraging.  Her son has also learned that he needs to be treated well; he knows that 
he has civil rights.  He can get angry sometimes.  Rose deals with this by advocating for him.  
00:15:42  Has gone to lobby days.  Very important for home care workers to gather together and 
speak to politicians.

00:16:56  Has spoken at lobby days, which was frightening.  Usually more of a background 
person.  Once you're encouraged by others, you feel comfortable doing it.  Knows her situation is
important.  
00:17:48  Has taken her son to lobby days.  He learned a lot, started talking about his civil rights.
Held up signs.  Learned union chants.  Gives example: “We are the union, the mighty, might 
union.  Fighting for justice.”  
00:18:49  Went once to a meeting in Coos Bay with local officials.  Asked why her son was 
being paid below minimum wage at his job.  Why is it called “work” if they won't pay him?  
Very frustrating to Rose and her husband.        
00:23:18  Father was a union painter.  Rose went to union halls, Christmas parties, and other 
events as a child.  Probably wouldn't have had her eye operations if father was not in the union.  
Father had retirement benefits and good pay.  
00:25:20  Typical duties — helps son eat properly, keeps him on a schedule, helps him make 
choices.  Receives backup support from husband.  Son lives with parents; a 24/7 job.  Feels that 
he wouldn't have as much freedom and support in a different environment.  Other caregivers 
from the union fill in if Rose is gone.  Son likes to stay overnight with other family members.
00:31:29  How do you relax?  Takes son to Special Olympics—a time to relax and watch him 
enjoy himself. 
00:32:11  Most gratifying part of the job: doing something for humanity.  Son has so much to 
offer.  He likes to help people.  There are frustrating times, too.              
00:33:16  Not a hobby person.  Likes to go to the union meetings, though.  Family is her hobby.  
Doesn't want to miss out on life.
00:34:17  Has gone to union meetings once a month for at least two years, ever since SEIU 
organized personal support workers.      
00:34:41  Has been told, “You don't need a union.”  Doesn't see herself as an outspoken person 
who can come back with a quick response, but knows from her life that she does need the union.
00:36:00  Her son sees friends at Special Olympics.  Plays basketball.  Family encourages him.  
He has decided to play softball for the first time.  He does bowling in the fall.  She sees other 
home care workers at Special Olympics.  Often a time to talk about frustrations.  Shares example

of meeting a woman and encouraging her to get more services for her own son.  Proud of helping
another home care worker and being inspired by the union to do so.
00:41:55  The hardest part of the job?  Communicating about simple things with her son.  
Example of him refusing to take out the trash.  Always has to remind her son about everything.    
00:44:12  Has learned a lot about autism but there's so much too learn.  Learns a lot from her 
son.  
00:45:00  Does the community understand what you do?  Thinks the community would 
understand more if son lived in a group home.  People think that it's not work to take care of your
own son at home.  He's over eighteen, though, and can't support himself. “It is work. I am doing 
my work along with his work.”  
00:47:44  Sees herself doing other work, if not caring for son — home care, childcare, working 
on the census.  Even being a stay-at-home mother is a lot of work.  “We're building the 
cornerstones; we're building our future.”  
00:51:18  What are your hopes for you son?  Has seen ups and downs associated with mental 
illness.  Has also seen the greatness of defeating it at times.  It's never  completely defeated.  
Hopes that her son has strength to keep going.  Discusses advocating for her son, writing letters 
to mental health specialists and counselors.  Medications only work so long.  Hopes that 
scientists are working on better medications. 
00:55:42 Talks about helping son make good nutritional decisions.  Reading serving size 
information on packages works.  Discussion between Don Stacy and Rose about giving clients 
guidance as a relative versus being a non-relative.  
00:59:52  Discusses how she noticed son's autism when he was five.  He was in Head Start and 
the teachers and doctors did not notice it.  Explains it as a mother's instinct.
01:01:11  You have to have humor on the job.  Jokes with son about various things.  Easy to joke 
with him because he is a family member.  Finds it humorous that her son can beat her at chess 
every time.
01:04:51  End of interview.
