LG: 
Okay, today is January 13th, 2020; and I am here, in Draper, Utah. This is Lisa Gabbert, 
and I am talking to Dr. Ian Cavin (here, in his office).  
 
 
 
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this interview.

IC: 
Well thanks for having me, or thanks for coming, I should say [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
For the record, can you state your full name and your title? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. My name is Ian Richard Cavin, and I am a doctor of osteopathic medicine. 
 
LG: 
Okay; and what’s your birth year? 
 
IC: 
1971. 
 
LG: 
1971, okay; great.  
 
 
 
For the first part, can you just talk about where you went to medical school, residency 
training and the years –  
 
IC: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
That you did that? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
[Stops and chats for a minute about something unrelated to question.] 
 
LG: 
So, just the year – where you went to medical school, the years –  
 
IC: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
Residency, fellowship? 
 
IC: 
So, I went to medical school at Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine. It was 
in San Francisco when I started, and it moved to Vallejo, California (which is in the 
northeast Bay Area) my second year. And that’s (I believe) where it still is. 
 
LG: 
What year did you start? 
 
IC: 
I started in 1998 and finished in 2002.  
 
LG: 
Okay. And then how about after that? 
 
IC: 
So, after that I did my residency training in Dayton, Ohio, at Grandview Hospital 
Medical Center, which is an osteopathic hospital in Dayton, Ohio. And that is affiliated 
with Ohio University. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 3 
 
IC: 
And then after that, I came back here to Draper, and set up practice. 
 
LG: 
Okay, thank you. 
 
 
How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
IC: 
Honestly, I think when I was young I wanted a lucrative career. So, I think I decided I 
wanted to be a doctor about age 12. And so, I spent all my years from that point on 
working toward this.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Do you come from a medical family? 
 
IC: 
No, no; I’m the only person. Well I have – my mom’s sister is a nurse (or was a nurse; 
she’s retired now) – but outside of that, no. 
 
LG: 
And how did you decide on medicine, as opposed to say, law, or you know, some other 
professional? 
 
IC: 
I don’t know. I’m not sure why. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
IC: 
It just fascinated me, I guess. When I made the decision, I really knew nothing about any 
of it. I wanted to be a businessman for a while, and that was just so vague that I think I 
just happened on doctor. And it was a much more tangible something that I could work 
toward. 
 
LG: 
Nice; nice. 
 
IC: 
So, that’s probably it. 
 
[03:02] 
 
LG: 
Can you tell the story about applying to, and getting into medical school? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. So, I did my undergraduate work at the University of Utah. And as I was preparing 
to apply to medical school, one of my classmates asked me if I had considered going to 
an osteopathic medical school, which I had never heard of at that point.  
 
 
So I tried to find out more information on that, and didn’t find a lot. But what I found was 
that it was a more holistic brand of medicine. And I decided that I wanted to only apply 
to osteopathic medical schools. And so, I did not apply to any allopathic schools or MD 
schools.  
 
 
And so, one of the requirements to get into medical school is to take the MCAT (or the 
Medical College Admissions Test). And so I worked on that – I did a preparatory course 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 4 
 
for that, and then I took it. I think I did pretty well for the MCAT. And I submitted my 
applications, and I had one interview [laughs]. And I got in. 
 
 
And so, it was fortunately the school I wanted to go to, which was out in San Francisco. I 
was basing my decisions mostly on locations of where I’d like to live. 
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
IC: 
And so, I was excited to go out to San Francisco. My dad grew up in the Bay Area, and 
it’s always been kind of a second home to me. It’s a place that I wanted to go. 
 
 
So in order to do that, you have to fill out an application. And at the time (back in 1997, 
when I was doing all this), it was still – I had to apply to each, individual school, which 
limited the number of schools I applied to, because I didn’t have much money. You had 
to pay an application fee and apply individually to each of these schools. I think now it’s 
more of an automated –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Click the schools you want your application to go to and they’ll send it off.  
 
 
And then I had to write a personal essay, which I can remember doing over Christmas – 
no, I’m sorry, it wasn’t over Christmas. I can remember doing it on a typewriter. And I 
got an interview in early December.  
 
 
 
And then my wife’s parents were living in Billings, Montana, so we went up to Montana 
for Christmas. And right before we left, I believe, I got my acceptance letter. And so I 
went up there pretty excited because I knew that I’d actually be able to get in to school. 
 
[06:12] 
 
 
And so, I went to medical school with the desire to be a family practice physician; I 
wanted to take care of people from birth to death – that’s kind of what intrigued me at 
that point. And so, my first two years that’s kind of what I thought I was going to do.  
 
 
I always had an inkling for doing things with my hands – I always enjoyed tinkering with 
things, and taking things apart. In fact, I had a scholarship (as an undergraduate) for 
nursing school, from the ROTC – and that was one of the things they asked me about, 
was you know, “Why do you want to do nursing?” 
 
 
 
Well in my young mind, I didn’t realize there was a huge difference between nurses and 
doctors; I kind of thought I could transition from nursing into medicine (relatively 
simple) – which you can, but there are different –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 5 
 
IC: 
Different philosophies. 
 
 
But that was one of the questions that they asked me was, “Why do you want to do this?” 
And the answer I gave them (even at that time) was, “I like to figure out how things 
work.” And so, that’s always been with me. And I realized, as I was getting on through 
medical school that that was something that really was drawing me more than medicines 
and other things.  
 
 
I feel like I’ve always been good with people, so I liked the aspect of being the family 
doctor that someone brings their kids to, and they come see me. But in my third year of 
medical school I realized that just being in the office was too boring [laughs]. I couldn’t 
stay in the office all day long, eight hours a day, for five days a week. 
 
[08:17] 
 
 
And then that was also the year I had my surgical rotations. And when I did general 
surgery, I would work until eight or nine o’clock at night, from six or seven in the 
morning, and it never phased me as what time it was.  
 
 
And I distinctly remember, especially when I did pediatrics, that I would look at my 
watch and what time is it? There was this one, particular time, I think it was 11 in the 
morning. And then my heart just sunk. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
Because I was like, “Oh, no! It’s only 11?” [Laughs] 
 
 
And so, just the thought of being in the office for another six hours was too much. And 
so, that’s when I decided to maybe switch my trajectory. 
 
 
So I talked with my wife; and knowing that surgical residency was difficult, and it was 
going to be more time-intensive – I asked her what her thoughts were. I told her, “I don’t 
think I’ll be happy doing family practice.”  
 
 
And so being the angel that she is, she said, “Well if that’s what’s going to make you 
happy, then that’s what we’ll do.” Knowing that it was going to be worse for her. 
 
LG: 
That’s a good wife [laughs]. 
 
IC: 
It is a good wife; and she’s supported me through all of this. You know, we met in 
college, and were married and had one child when I started medical school. So, she’s 
been through it all with me. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit more about what osteopathy is, and how it differs from the 
allopathic tradition? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 6 
 
IC: 
Sure, yeah. So, osteopathic medicine is a branch of medicine that came about in mid to 
late 1800s. It originated with a physician who was dissatisfied with the state of medicine 
at that time. And he felt like there was a better way to do things. And so it grew into a 
more of a manipulative type of medicine.  
 
[10:28] 
 
 
And so he started researching and teaching, and he opened a school in Missouri (in 
Crooksville, Missouri – which I’ve never been to, but I hear it’s pretty small). But it just 
grew out of that. And it’s definitely a more holistic – I think that’s one of the things that I 
gained from this, was that it was – I’m more open to alternative therapies –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
for people. I believe that there are things that have been around – some of them are 
tradition, but some of them (I’m sure) are very useful and helpful; and some of them have 
borne out in research as alternative therapies (whether it’s eastern medicine or 
manipulative medicine).  
 
 
And so, I think the main difference is that we not only learn all of the contemporary 
medicine, but we learn different manipulative techniques. And we had a lab twice a 
week, for four hours, that we would work on that. And then we had class, as well, to learn 
the theories behind it. 
 
 
Unfortunately, it’s not something that I stuck with, because I like to cut things, and so 
[laughs] – I ended up not doing much in the way of manipulation after I graduated. But 
there are people who just do manipulation, and so they are proponents of that. 
 
 
And it incorporates soft tissue manipulation: so, myofascial releases; and yeah, it also 
incorporates manipulation of the musculoskeletal system – so, it’s similar to chiropractic 
in that fashion. Also, it incorporates different things like cranio-sacral manipulation, 
which is something that I’ve seen more in physical therapy. 
 
[12:41] 
 
 
So some of the things that we learned you would see a lot in physical therapy, and those 
types of modalities, as well as maybe chiropractic, or other things. 
 
 
So, there are some people who still practice it. I think my philosophy kind of changed on 
that throughout medical school and residency into something that I feel like is probably 
more of a specialty.  
 
 
The profession, as a whole, would probably have me you know, say more that it’s, you 
know, it should be integrated into everything I do. But I don’t find that as practical, given 
what I do. I mean, there are surgeons who still will –  
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 7 
 
LG: 
Do that? 
 
IC: 
use some manipulations. 
 
LG: 
The general public doesn’t really have a good understanding of, you know, what medical 
school is like. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? And maybe some of your strongest memories? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. So, medical school is different, depending on which school you went to. Ours was 
a classroom-intensive; others are bookwork-intensive.  
 
 
But essentially I spent eight hours a day in class, and then I would go home after class 
and try to study a little bit. Given the length of classroom sessions they had [laughs], I 
didn’t study much on the weekdays, but I usually would study all day on Saturday.  
 
 
And so I had a study group and we would get together on Saturdays, typically, and start 
probably another eight hours on Saturday, and get ready. We always had (not always, but 
often had) tests on Mondays, depending on the different classes. So, it was a good way to 
kind of review everything that we had learned from the week, and read up on the things 
that we may have missed, and prepare ourselves for our tests on Monday. 
 
LG: 
Is there a particular moment, or series of moments in medical school that jumps out for 
you, as kind of defining moments? 
 
[14:42] 
 
IC: 
Well certainly, the anatomy lab. I think that’s probably [laughing] a defining moment for 
most people. But at the time, when I started medical school (like I said) I wanted to be a 
family practice physician –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
We had four people assigned to our cadaver, and I don’t remember how it came about, 
but everybody kind of nominated me to make the first incision. 
 
LG: 
The future surgeon. 
 
IC: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 8 
 
IC: 
And it was actually really difficult to make – it’s a corpse that’s been preserved, and you 
know, I’m not going to hurt anything; but just making that incision into someone’s body 
was difficult. And it took some getting used to. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Do you remember what you were thinking, or how you felt at the time? 
 
IC: 
I was queasy. 
 
LG: 
Were you? 
 
IC: 
Yeah [laughs]. I didn’t – it wasn’t an enjoyable experience by any means. But it was also 
exhilarating, you know? It was kind of the quintessential “this is medical school.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
You know, when you start doing your dissection, this is what it’s about. And so, it was 
kind of mixed feelings: I was excited, I was a little sick to my stomach [laughs], and not 
really knowing what was going to happen underneath when I opened up the skin.  
 
 
We started on the back, and so we – I don’t remember the exact incision we made, but we 
were making it in the back, and it was interesting. And then trying to determine between 
the four of us who would make which moves next, and –  
 
 
It turned out that some of us did more dissection and others just kind of did more 
watching.  
 
LG: 
Yeah, that makes sense. 
 
IC: 
But then the smell. The formaldehyde stays with you – it does not go away.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, for a year – well a year and a half, because my second year I was a TA for the 
anatomy lab. And I got to the point where I just did not like being in there anymore, so I 
stopped about halfway [laughs] through the year. I couldn’t keep dissecting. 
 
[17:01] 
 
LG: 
Because of the smell? 
 
IC: 
Yeah, the smell. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And the tissue is so not normal. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 9 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
It’s you know, more rubbery, and it just doesn’t feel right, and it’s cold. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
You know, all refrigerated. So, between those things, I just didn’t want to do it anymore.  
 
LG: 
That’s interesting. 
 
 
So, when you decided to become a surgeon, you said you were good with your hands –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or, you liked –  
 
IC: 
I like to work with my hands, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Like to work with your hands – were there other reasons, apart from the fact that you 
were moving away from family medicine? Or, how did –  
 
IC: 
Oh, no; I mean, I think that was the reason, was I got to work with my hands. There are 
different surgical specialties, but even in undergraduate, I was always very fascinated 
with the blood supply and the intestines (which is essentially what a general surgeon 
does, is the abdominal surgery).  
 
 
And so, it was, you know, it just kind of was a natural fit, I think, based on my interests, 
that that’s where I should be. I think I chose family medicine, probably initially, I think 
there was a part of me that always wanted to do surgery –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
but just felt like that wasn’t fair to my family. So, I chose something that I thought would 
be a much more practical application, and something that I was interested in doing, as 
well (obviously); it wasn’t something like, “Well, I guess I’ll choose this.” But it 
certainly wasn’t my passion. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And once I started getting in the operating room, it was similar to that first incision in the 
anatomy lab: it was exhilarating, and maybe a little bit nervous, and then realizing that 
this is just – it’s fantastic. It was fun; it was fun for me (it still is fun for me). I still enjoy 
doing what I do. 
 
 
And so I don’t know that I decided so much to move away from family practice, as that I 
felt like surgery was a much better fit for me. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 10 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, it wasn’t – yeah. 
 
[19:22] 
 
LG: 
Did they allow you to participate in surgery in medical school?  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or did you not learn to do it until you went into residency? 
 
IC: 
No, well so, it’s – a lot of it depends on where you’re at, and the different setups they 
have. So I was at a community hospital – a lot of osteopathic medical schools do their 
rotations at community hospitals. And so, you don’t have the hierarchy that you typically 
would have with a training program.  
 
 
So, in a training program you have residents, and then you have interns, and medical 
students – and so, you have the attending physician, and then down the table (in the OR 
at least) you have maybe two or three people (as a medical student), that are closer to the 
operation than you. And so, you’re standing at the knees, sometimes, just kind of trying 
to get a look.  
 
 
But when I was a medical student, I didn’t have residents. We had just the attendings, so I 
got to help a lot more, which was actually fantastic for me, because it just made me want 
to do it more.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit more about learning to do surgery? 
 
IC: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
Because I know it’s kind of an apprenticeship, almost – isn’t it? 
 
IC: 
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, I mean, I think most of medicine is that way. You spend four 
years in medical school learning the very foundation of where you can jump off from 
there. But most medicine now is, you know, at least three more years of additional 
training; and possibly, you know, a decade (or more), depending on what you decide to 
do. 
 
 
But so, as a medical student I assisted; and so you learn some of the basics of retraction. 
In fact, as a medical student I would practice tying surgical knots with dental floss. I had 
a big box of floss (one of the big canisters), and I’d just pull off a yard (or so) at a time, 
and tie it around something and just start throwing knots. And so, you just learn how to – 
I practiced with my hands. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 11 
 
[21:30] 
 
 
In fact, one of my surgical attendings, as a student, wanted me to try and tie a different 
knot, because there are different ways to tie knots, and you can use two hands or one 
hand. And I’d learned the one-handed technique.  
 
 
And he’s like, “I want you to do it the two-handed technique.” [Laughs] And I’m like, 
“Uhh.” So, I tried. And I hadn’t practiced that, so I fumbled quite a bit. I’m like, “I don’t 
understand why you want me to do this, but whatever.”  
 
 
But it was good, you know, it’s good to know all of it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And so, after my medical school years – so, I had two general surgery rotations (in 
medical school), and then I had some surgical electives. And so I was able to do some of 
my electives at places I had looked at, that I thought I might want to try doing my 
residency.  
 
 
So, I spent a month in Michigan (in the Detroit area), and then a month down in Dayton. 
And I absolutely hated Michigan, but loved Dayton. So, I was happy that’s where I kind 
of ended up. 
 
 
The residency process is what they call the match. So, you kind of put your top places 
down, and they put their top candidates down. And if they match, then that’s where you 
go. So, if I’m listed number one by them, or number two, and they have two spots, and I 
list them as number one, then I fall into their category. 
 
 
If I list them as number three and my number one and two slots are taken by someone 
else, then I move to theirs; or vice versa: if they have me listed as three, and their first 
two candidates are able to come, then I would have to move to somewhere else. 
 
[23:31] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And so, I felt very fortunate that I didn’t have to scramble for another place: that I got 
what I wanted.  
 
 
And the training there – one of the reasons I liked it, is it was a, you know, it was not 
what we call malignant. So malignant training programs are very harsh on people, and 
[laughing] there’s a lot of yelling and demeaning. And they were very much not that way. 
 
LG: 
Supportive? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 12 
 
IC: 
They were very supportive. And the residents were great – I loved the residents that were 
there. And I just felt like that was a great place, and I would fit in well. 
 
LG: 
And how long was the surgical residency? 
 
IC: 
Surgical residency is five years. 
 
LG: 
Five years. 
 
IC: 
So, the first year is what we call our intern year. And then my intern year I did – so, 
osteopathy still has what they call rotating internship, which is a traditional internship 
(from 30, 40, 50 years ago) where you kind of rotated through all the specialties and 
learned everything – that was just to get you prepared for practicing on your own. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And then as other specialties started coming in, you would do an internship, and then a 
specialty, and then eventually the internship became incorporated into your specialty.  
 
 
But for osteopathic medicine, when I matched into that residency they still had a rotating 
internship. So, they had a four-year residency and a one-year internship. And I was able 
to secure a surgical emphasis internship (they had one of those available for their two 
slots they had).  
 
 
And so instead of doing just one or two months of general surgery, I did six months of 
general surgery, and six months of – I did OB, and internal medicine (twice) in the 
emergency department. And part of that, was I did a family practice clinic –  
 
LG: 
Interesting. 
 
[25:32] 
 
IC: 
every week for the whole year. So, you know, when I was on my surgical rotation I 
would still have to break away and go do family practice clinic. Which was actually 
really good, because I (later in my residency) I moonlighted. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
To make a little extra money. And that extra broad training was helpful. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. A lot of people think of the intern year as one of the worst years, or the 
toughest years (in terms of time) and –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. So, my intern year they introduced the 80-hour work week, which was a new thing 
at the time. So, that was the first year that they were incorporating that into the residency. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 13 
 
And so my intern year was just the interns. And then the following year they were going 
to introduce it for everybody. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
IC: 
And so, my intern year I was limited to 80 hours a week – which is still a lot of work, but 
it wasn’t what they normally did. The way that we worked it was I helped the two 
surgical interns. They rotated on surgery over the Christmas break, so there was a two 
week (one was Christmas, and the other one contained the New Year’s).  
 
 
And so, you know, we got one of those weeks that we had to work, and we got one of 
those weeks off. And for that week I was a resident, at least by the resident standards, 
they considered me a resident. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, they didn’t want to apply [laughing] the 80-hour work week. I think that work week 
was about 120 hours [laughs]. So, I got a taste of what they did typically, which was 
changing the following year. So, I never felt like it was excessive –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Prior to going to medical school I worked up at the University of Utah hospital, and I 
worked a shift where I worked 70 hours a week, and then I had a week off – so, I had the 
seven on, seven off schedule.  
 
 
So, 70 hours a week I was used to working, and that was just the same as what I was 
going to be doing as a resident – just every week, not every other week. 
 
[27:43] 
 
 
But the hours could be crazy. The rotations – some of the rotations were more intensive, 
and so I’d get up at three o’clock in the morning and start my rounds before the 
attendings would come in at six-thirty, or six, or five-forty-five, or whenever they decide 
to come in, before we started surgery at seven-thirty.  
 
 
So, I had to have all the patients seen and rounded on, and labs checked, and make sure 
that things were where they should be. And the attendings would come in, and I would 
have to present everybody, and then we’d go through and round with them. 
 
 
So, there was a few months where I felt like it was more arduous, because I was working 
from three until (sometimes) seven or eight at night, and get home (maybe) eight or nine, 
say hi to my family real quick, try and get some sleep, [laughing] go back and do it again. 
 
LG: 
Again.

IC: 
So, there was a lot of times I wasn’t around, as a resident (and still are). [Laughs] It 
hasn’t changed a lot. I don’t have anybody to do my work for me now, so it’s all me. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] And when you were learning to do surgery, can you describe a little bit like 
how that learning process works? 
 
IC: 
Oh, yes. So, when you’re low on the – I don’t know – when you’re low in order, it is – 
you watch, and you watch, and you watch. And then you watch, and you may retract. So, 
as a medical student –  
 
LG: 
Retract, meaning? Bring back –  
 
IC: 
Yeah, you pull the tissues back to get good visualization for the surgeon (or the resident). 
If the resident is doing – I always liked it when the resident was operating, because 
sometimes the surgeon would step out and just let the resident operate, which meant I got 
to move up the table. 
 
[29:45] 
 
 
But so, you start by doing the tasks that you can’t mess up [laughs]. So, watching is the 
first one. So, as a student you do a lot of watching; and then you retract, which actually is 
probably harder than some of the other things that they would have us do. You know, as 
you move up you realize that it’s really easy to mess up retracting and not know. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And then you learn how to close the skin, so you put sutures in, and you try to close the 
skin up, and dress the incision. So, as you get more proficient, then you get the next task, 
and the next task. 
 
 
But for us, in our program, there was enough people ahead of you that you really didn’t 
do much operating until your third year, probably. And then you started doing some of 
the smaller cases, you know? 
 
 
As a second-year resident, you probably would do some of the really small cases. 
 
LG: 
What would be an example of a small case? 
 
IC: 
Maybe if you had a lipoma, which is a little fatty mass; it usually sits in the subcutaneous 
tissue, so right under the skin there is a layer of fat. And these tend to grow in that area. 
It’s really hard to mess those up, and so you start by doing stuff like that.  
 
 
And so, you get to make the incision, you get to pull the tumor out, and then you get to 
close the incision. And so, you get to the whole thing yourself – which is great when 
you’re first, “Oh, I get to do something.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 15 
 
 
But as you get further along, you want bigger things, you want to do more. And so, that 
continues as you move through the years, you get bigger and bigger cases, until you 
know, your fourth and fifth year you’re doing a majority of the surgery; often, in 
conjunction with your attending physician. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, I’d be operating and they would be assisting me –  
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
IC: 
But also guiding me. It’s like, “Don’t cut that; oh, stop, back up.” You know, and just 
kind of correcting me as I tried to sabotage through surgery. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
I had one of our attendings would call us “the first combatants,” instead of the first 
assistants. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Do you have any particularly salient moments that stand out in your mind from 
that period of time? 
 
IC: 
Oh, yeah. So, as a student, so – well there’s lots of them. But just kind of the things, as a 
student you’re scared. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
You don’t want to mess up, you’re afraid to move, because you might touch something 
you shouldn’t touch. And in surgery, you have the sterile field. And so, if it’s not on the 
sterile field, you shouldn’t touch it.  
 
[32:43] 
 
 
And so, you have these you know, bigger than life people that you’re working with, and 
trying to learn from. And so, you know, I (often) was afraid to ask questions – I just was 
like, “Oh, I don’t want to say anything; I’m just here. I’ll just be here, I’ll just try to fade 
in the background.” 
 
 
So, as a medical student I had – I was operating with a surgeon who was a vascular 
surgeon. And I hadn’t operated with him before, but when I had downtime, I’d go find 
someone that would let me operate with them. And I had put on some safety glasses 
(which was good), and he was sewing in a vascular graft.  
 
 
In fact, this type of thing happened to me twice, through all the years [laughs].  
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 16 
 
 
But when you do vascular surgery, you have to clamp the artery, so that you don’t have 
massive blood loss. So, times is of the essence, you want to restore blood flow as quickly 
as you can. So, it’s a series of clamps: you clamp before, and you clamp after the area 
that you’re going to put this graft on. And then you make an incision in the artery, and 
you sew this graft to it, and then you have to clamp the graft also, because when you open 
up the artery, it’s going to fill the graft. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And so, often you’ll check to make sure that you have blood flow, by unclamping the 
graft, or unclamping the artery. And you check for leaks around the graft by unclamping 
the artery and keeping the graft clamped.  
 
 
And so, this particular day he unclamped the graft, and it just shot a stream of blood, and 
hit me square in the forehead. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
And then was just dripping down my nose, inside of my safety glasses. I was like very 
grateful I’d put [laughs] glasses on that day because I often (at that point) did not wear 
safety glasses. 
 
LG: 
Oh, my god. 
 
IC: 
And he just kept – he didn’t know he did it. And finally, after a couple of minutes – and 
this is just dripping down my face –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
One of the nurses stopped him and said, “Do you mind if we wipe his face off?” And he 
looks up, and he’s like, “Oh, sorry. That’s fine. Hurry.” 
 
[Laughs] 
 
 
And so, he had to wipe my face off –  
 
LG: 
[??] 
 
IC: 
And he just kept going back to work. I mean, and that’s just – it was no big deal, you 
know? Blood’s part of the job. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[35:12] 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 17 
 
IC: 
It happened again as a resident – where I was helping a vascular surgeon (this was later 
on in my residency, so I was more involved in this case). And he was doing, it’s called a 
fem-fem bypass – which is (I don’t even know if they do these much anymore, because 
surgeries change so much) – so anyway, you graft from the femoral artery on one side 
(on the right side, in this case) to the femoral artery on the left side, because they have a 
blockage in their iliac artery. So, you’re bypassing all the blockage and sending blood 
down the leg.  
 
 
And this surgeon had the graft kind of hanging off the edge of the table and forgot to 
clamp it, and I didn’t notice it. And as we were working, he was unlocking, er, 
unclamping it, and checking everything. And after 20 or 30 seconds, I just had this warm 
sensation on my foot. And I looked down, and it was just draining straight down my leg 
and into my shoe. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
IC: 
It just filled my shoe with blood. And so, I just said, “You might want to clamp this; I 
think you need to clamp this.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
And we just kept operating [??] –  
 
LG: 
Yep. 
 
IC: 
I think I threw the socks away and tried to rinse the shoes out when I got home.  
 
LG: 
Like, “Honey, I have really bad laundry today.” [Laughs] 
 
IC: 
Yeah, well of course, I mean you wear the hospital scrubs –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
That’s not an issue. But I think, the thing about that – I wore those shoes home every, 
single day. I’d take them off by the back door –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
And those poor shoes were such a – I just hope my kids never played with them. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
They might be healthier now; they might have developed a strong immune response 
because of it, but those shoes were nasty. 
 
LG: 
That’s really funny. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 18 
 
 
 
Well so, you are currently a general surgeon. 
 
IC: 
That’s correct, yes. 
 
LG: 
What are some of the most difficult challenges in being a surgeon – now that you’re 
through all the training and have your own? 
 
IC: 
[Sighs] For me, there’s a few. But I think time; time is a commodity that I don’t have 
much of. So, I feel like – now, instead of having an 80-hour work week (which I typically 
don’t work more than 80 hours anyway), but there are weeks when I do: I may have 70 
hours done in three days, sometimes, four days maybe. It’s just, you know, you get these 
18, 19, 20-hour days and you just keep doing them day after day. So as I get older I’m 
less able to do that as much. I still have to, but [laughing] it just wears on me way more 
than it used to. 
 
[37:56] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
I’ve found that I don’t sleep as well as I used to. I used to be able to sleep anytime, 
anywhere – it didn’t matter. If I had ten minutes, I was asleep. And now, you know, for 
instance – last night, I got called at one o’clock in the morning, and felt like I had to go 
evaluate this patient. So, I got up, went into the hospital, evaluated them – and 
fortunately, they didn’t need surgery, but I was up.  
 
 
I went back home, and got another phone call as soon as I got into bed. And then I laid 
there for – I try not to look at the clock, so I don’t know how long it was – but I’m going 
to guess at least an hour (it could have been up to two, maybe an hour and a half). But I 
just couldn’t fall asleep. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
My mind was racing, I was awake, and I was done [laughs]. So, I think that’s the biggest 
constraint for me, right now (personally) is just being present for my family. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Professionally, I think the hardest thing for me is still probably having conversations with 
people who don’t have good prognosis. So, if someone has cancer, it becomes really 
difficult to dash their hopes and their dreams.  
 
 
I had a patient just last month that [laughs], it was really difficult –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 19 
 
IC: 
We found a cancer, incidentally, at the time of surgery and we ended up not doing the 
surgery that we planned on. And it’s not a good cancer, and it looked like it’s probably 
advanced. And so, because it’s not a cancer that I see often, I didn’t feel like I could give 
them a straight answer on what the prognosis was, so I probably left more hope than there 
was; but I didn’t want to be the one to squash that hope. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And unfortunately, her husband had died just a few months before, and she was here with 
her daughter – she wasn’t old; it was just a bad set of circumstances.  
 
[40:13] 
 
 
So, to me – that’s the part of my job I enjoy the least.  
 
LG: 
That sounds very difficult. 
 
IC: 
Yeah, it can be. But you know, it’s what I have to do [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
That’s the job. 
 
LG: 
How do you deal with that personally, if you don’t mind me asking? 
 
IC: 
How do I deal with it personally? 
 
LG: 
Yeah? 
 
IC: 
I don’t know. I’m very good at compartmentalizing, so work stays at work; I don’t often 
think about things when I get home, unless there’s something that I need to look up or 
research. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
But I tend to just leave that all at work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
I certainly joke a lot. That’s [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
IC: 
Sure. I mean, I’ve always teased my sisters – I have six sisters, and a brother; so, my 
sisters always got teased by me (I’m the second oldest). I’ve always enjoyed playing 
pranks.  
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 20 
 
 
 
I can remember as a child I had this little plastic grasshopper, and I would just toss it on 
my sister’s bed at night – because she would scream: I knew she would scream every 
single time, and every, single time she would scream. And it never got old for me. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] And she never caught on. 
 
IC: 
Yeah, and that’s what I couldn’t figure out; I was like, “You know this is coming, at least 
once a week.” 
 
 
But you know, I’d like to stand in the basement when she would come down the stairs, 
and it was dark and I would jump out and scare her, stuff like that. I just loved doing (I 
still do, actually) [laughs]. I’m almost 50 years old and I still enjoy doing that. 
 
 
But so, sometimes I’ll do pranks on people at the hospital; sometimes they’ll try and do 
pranks on me. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about those? 
 
IC: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
You know that Susan sent me the video? 
 
IC: 
Yes, yes; I do. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that, particularly? That was where somebody pranked you? 
 
IC: 
Yes, that was where someone pranked me. So, it was April Fool’s Day. 
 
LG: 
Oh. 
 
IC: 
And because it’s April Fool’s Day, of course, I thought I would have fun. So, I actually 
got there a little bit earlier. And the anesthesiologist who was in my room didn’t see me. 
So I told one of the nurses in the pre-operative area to tell him that I’m running late – just 
because I knew that would get under his skin. 
 
 
And so, I was watching – she called, and he’s like, “Ugh, okay.” 
 
[Chuckling] 
 
 
And so, I got my rise, and I was like, “Yay, I did it – April Fool’s, look at me.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
And little did I know that they’d already planned something for me. And so, I saw my 
patient, and I went and just kind of (sometimes in the morning I’ll eat some breakfast, 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 21 
 
before I go into the operating room) – there’s usually ten to 20 to 30 minutes before they 
need me, once they go back to the operating room. 
 
[43:25] 
 
 
So, they took my patient – or they said, “Okay, we’re going to take him back.” 
 
 
And so they called me and said, “We’re ready for you,” I came into the room. And I 
mean, it’s my fault that I got pranked (for lots of reasons), but I should have been more 
attentive. And I walk into the room, we did our time out. And there was a lot of people in 
the room – it didn’t really strike me – it struck me that they were all there, but it didn’t 
strike me that there was something amiss at that point.  
 
 
And one of the technicians (the scrub technicians/surgical technicians) was under the 
drapes. And on a lot of the drapes (the paper drapes) there’s a little white piece of paper 
that sits over the area that you prep. And usually, when they have someone prepped for 
me before I walk in, they’ll take that off. And I thought, “Why is that still on there?” 
 
 
And so, I pull it off, and as I pull it off, the tech sits up – 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
And just is like, “Rawr.” And of course, a lot of things go through my mind. I find it very 
funny actually, the two things that went through my mind first was, “Who didn’t shave 
this guy?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
IC: 
And, “Why is he moving?” And I was getting mad at the anesthesiologist for not putting 
him properly to sleep before it dawned on me what was happening. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
IC: 
So, I’m already critiquing my peers about what, you know, what a sloppy job they’ve 
done –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
IC: 
as I’m jumping away from the patient and screaming. 
 
LG: 
That was a hilarious video. 
 
IC: 
It was. 
 
LG: 
It was very funny. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 22 
 
IC: 
And they were so kind – you know, there were people in there because they were 
videoing it. And then the girl who put it all together posted it to Facebook. Which, I 
didn’t mind the prank, but I didn’t like being posted on Facebook. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
And it ended up, in the course of two or three weeks, with four or 500,000 likes on 
Facebook –  
 
LG: 
Oh, really? Wow. 
 
IC: 
It really made me mad. And I don’t know if it’s a ego thing: I didn’t want to have that 
many people seeing me jump –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Probably. That’s probably the base of it. But I also felt like my privacy was violated 
[laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Because I didn’t give her permission to put that on the internet. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And I never told her that. 
 
LG: 
Interesting. 
 
IC: 
But I enjoy watching those types of videos, so I can’t complain, honestly. 
 
LG: 
Well I think social media changes, you know, what is traditionally done, which is often –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Pranks, you know? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
I think surgery is sort of one of those areas of medicine that does have – does do pranks 
maybe a little bit more often than maybe other specialties –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
But social media changes that. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 23 
 
IC: 
Well you can, because your patients are asleep; so, you can joke, and you can do things 
without having to have the normal decorum that you have as a bedside manner when your 
patients are awake. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[46:31] 
 
IC: 
Which for better or for worse, I think that’s part of the coping mechanism in dealing with 
the stress. It’s a high-stress environment, and you have to be on –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
All the time. It’s expected that you’re on all the time. You cannot have a bad day. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
IC: 
Because a bad day in surgery is a bad life for somebody else. So, I mean you feel that 
pressure to always be on. And fortunately, most of the time, that’s the case. But there are 
times when things don’t go well; or things that you don’t plan on, but you get. And then 
the stress goes up. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, of course. 
 
IC: 
So, when you get through that, you know, you may joke a little bit; or you say things that 
may, or probably would not be appropriate in other aspects of life [laughs]. You know, 
there’s a lot of anatomical jokes because we deal with anatomy; and for us, it’s anatomy. 
And so, we – not particularly patient-specific – but you know, you start thinking about 
different things that –  
 
 
You know, I have a friend who is a urologist, and he has a lot of urology jokes or penis 
jokes. And so, [laughs] and they’re not jokes you would probably tell, normally; but 
when you’re amongst your peers, and it’s not taboo to talk about things that you see all 
the time, then –  
 
LG: 
It’s very context-specific. 
 
IC: 
It is. 
 
LG: 
Is what it is. 
 
IC: 
Yes, exactly. It’s not – I don’t like it when people comment on my patients. Sometimes 
I’ll step in, but usually it just gets under my skin. Obesity is an issue for me, that people 
sometimes will say, “Oh,” – and I’ve been guilty of, you know, saying things because it 
makes my job harder. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 24 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[48:42] 
 
IC: 
It’s hard to get through bigger people, and it just poses a whole new set of challenges that 
I don’t think people understand how much more difficult it makes life. But I’m still held 
to the same standard of, “You still have to do this right.” 
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
IC: 
You still have to make sure that you have the same outcome, whether they’re 450 
pounds, or 120 pounds. And I hold myself to that standard because I certainly don’t want 
them to have any untoward issues either. And fortunately, most of the time things are not 
– you know, you still get the same results. It’s just harder to get that. 
 
LG: 
That’s probably why that YouTube video (or that Facebook posting) –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Made you annoyed, because it was taken out of context. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Like an appropriate prank for the OR, you know, among people you know –  
 
IC: 
Yes, and then shared with –  
 
LG: 
Then you take it out of that context –  
 
IC: 
Everybody –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
Who doesn’t –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
And like, “Oh, what?” 
 
LG: 
It’s a different thing. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
It’s a different thing. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 25 
 
IC: 
And honestly, I would have laughed at it if it was anybody else – I wouldn’t have had a 
problem with them putting that on Facebook. It just, that was because it was me. 
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
IC: 
But it taught me – I mean, it taught me something. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
You know, which was – I guess it humbled me [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Or watch out for your anesthesiologist! [Laughs] 
 
IC: 
Watch out for the conniving anesthesiologist, who has been on the butt-end of my jokes 
way more than I’ve been on the butt-end of his. So, [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about any that you’ve done to him? 
 
IC: 
Oh, I mean nothing in particular. Just I’ll harass him, and I don’t know. I don’t have any 
specifics on that – that’s the one specific – I make jokes, and sometimes I make jokes at 
the expense of the anesthesiologist [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
There is sort of the traditional rivalry, isn’t there? 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
[50:44] 
 
LG: 
Or traditional competition between –  
 
IC: 
I think so. 
 
LG: 
Surgery and anesthesiology? 
 
IC: 
I think the first rule of surgery that you learn early on is that you always blame the 
anesthesiologist for all your problems. So, whether it’s true or not. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
And then after the anesthesiologist, you go to the nurse, or the scrub tech, or [laughs] – 
but the anesthesiologist always gets it first. And so, there certainly is a rivalry there, I 
think. And they’re good – they’re good sports; they don’t – they probably get tired of 
hearing it, I’m sure. 
 
LG: 
I’m sure it goes the other way, too. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 26 
 
IC: 
Not so much [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
You don’t think so? 
 
IC: 
[Laughing] No, I don’t think they –  
 
LG: 
Oh, interesting. 
 
IC: 
I don’t think they send it the other way very much. 
 
LG: 
Oh, okay. 
 
IC: 
There are some who definitely would. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
There are some; and those are the people I usually just leave alone [laughs], because even 
still – you know, I’ve been doing this for a while now, and still there are some people 
who intimidate me and those are the people I leave alone.  
 
LG: 
Fair enough. 
 
IC: 
I hope that I don’t intimidate others; I’d like to think of myself as fun-loving, but I’m sure 
that I’m intimidating to people, despite what I do. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Why do you think – so, physicians are stereotyped a little bit as having a sense 
of humor, or being funny – why do you think that is? Not just surgery, but physicians, 
generally? 
 
IC: 
I don’t know. I mean, I think for me – I use a sense of humor to connect with people. I 
feel like I have a limited amount of time to connect with somebody, and if I can connect 
well with them, then they trust me to cut them open. If I don’t connect well with them, 
then you know, they still may let me do it; but for me, I want them to be comfortable with 
who is going to operate on them. I don’t want them to be apprehensive. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And I’ve told before, “Look, if I’m not the right person for you – get a second opinion. 
Find someone that you’re more comfortable with. I don’t want to do your surgery if you 
don’t want me to do it.” 
 
[52:53] 
 
 
Because I feel like it’s very important that they trust me. Because I want to trust someone 
who is going to cut me open. [Laughs] I don’t want to have someone pull all of my 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 27 
 
intestines out and lay them on top of my belly (or whatever) and not know what they’re 
doing.  
 
 
So, if someone is going to trust me, I have to be able to connect with them. And for me, I 
think the fastest and easiest way is to do it through humor.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Some people are not funny, and they don’t appreciate humor – so, I try to be nice. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
But for most people, I think they appreciate some humor; I mean, for me – that’s what I 
try to do. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
So, I assume – I don’t know, maybe it’s that way for everybody? But I can’t speak for 
other people. But for me, it’s a release, but also, it’s a connection –  
 
LG: 
Connection? 
 
IC: 
It’s a personal connection. 
 
LG: 
How do you think being a surgeon has changed you, as a person? 
 
IC: 
I think I don’t invest myself in people. So, I think I can come across very warm and 
inviting, but I think I have definitely an arm’s length. 
 
LG: 
Why is that? I mean, how does that relate to being a surgeon? 
 
IC: 
I think maybe just more to being a physician, but I know that I’m going to have people 
that don’t do well. And if I get too emotionally involved in that, then that can cloud how I 
deal with it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
My partner, case in point [laughs] – about two years ago called me and said, “My father-
in-law is in the ER, and I think he’s got an acute cholecystitis,” (which is inflammation of 
the gall bladder), “are you available to come do his gall bladder?” 
 
 
I said, “Sure.” 
 
 
And he called me back and said, “Never mind; he and my wife both want me to do it. So, 
I’m going to just do it.”  
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 28 
 
 
And his father-in-law had some complications and spent some time in the ICU. And he 
just beat himself up over this. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And it was unavoidable. But after it was all said and done, he said, “I wasn’t impartial. I 
should have put a tube in to drain the gallbladder, instead of actually taking it to the 
operating room, because he was old. I knew he had a bad heart. And you know, I just 
wasn’t impartial; I should have just done it this way instead.” 
 
 
And I think that you have to try to remain somewhat impartial with your patients. As 
much as I like to connect with them, as well – I don’t think it’s a deep connection, it’s a 
superficial connection that allows me to get to know them a little bit. But I don’t know 
that I want to get to know them really, really well. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Because if things go wrong, A: it hurts you know (it always hurts when things go wrong), 
but it hurts more if things go wrong with someone that you have more of an emotional 
connection to. But me – I think I need some impartiality to be able to deal with those 
things when they happen. 
 
[56:16] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; that makes sense. 
 
IC: 
So, I think – I don’t know if it’s so much as a surgeon, or just as a physician – but I feel 
like my job doesn’t allow me to –  
 
 
Or I don’t know if it doesn’t allow me, I’ve chosen not to make real deep connections. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And I have a really good relationship with my wife, and I think I have a good connection 
with her – but even some of my kids, I don’t connect with like I would like to. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And I think it’s because it’s so much a part of me now –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
That it’s just not something that I do. And so, I think they suffer for that. 
 
LG: 
Well I think it’s engrained in the training: the training is so long, too. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 29 
 
IC: 
Yeah, it’s so long; and for a lot of my kids, I just wasn’t there when they were young. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
IC: 
So, I didn’t really get to know them anyway. And so, now I have to not only get to know 
them, but try to invest myself into them. And you know, it’s sad because I want to, but I 
find that I just don’t do it 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
well. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; well you haven’t been trained to. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Or you’ve been trained the other way. 
 
IC: 
Yes, I’ve had – I think I’ve been trained not to. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
IC: 
So much, because I feel like that before all of this, I was really, you know – I was way 
more emotional than I am now. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
But you know, now it’s just more of a, “Meh.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. Well I think, you know, one aspect of this book that I’m writing is 
sort of, you know, how does training affect physicians (all kinds of physicians) as people. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? And I don’t think it’s always in the best way, you know? 
 
IC: 
No, I don’t either. I think – I mean, we can do great things and wonderful things for 
people, and it comes at a sacrifice –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
for us and for our families – I think my family more-so than me have paid a bigger 
sacrifice, because I’m not there. And when I am there, I may not be there. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 30 
 
LG: 
You might be asleep [laughs]. 
 
IC: 
I might be asleep, or I might be sitting right next to them and just not interested in 
interacting. 
 
[58:24] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, I think they pay a much bigger price than – I’m fine with who I am. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And other than a few things here and there I’d like to work on – but I feel like for the 
most part –  
 
LG: 
You’re good? 
 
IC: 
I’m good.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
I’ve got the connection with the people that I need to have the connection to. And then I 
stop and I think, well maybe not all the connection. But my siblings, you know, I’m not – 
my mom had surgery a month and a half ago, and I live the closest to her, but I was the 
last one (probably) [laughs] to come see her. And it’s just I’m busy, and when I have free 
time, I feel like I need to invest it in my –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
immediate family. And so, you know, it took me a few days to go down and see my 
mom. And I feel like I don’t have the ability to stretch myself any thinner. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. It’s a hard job. 
 
IC: 
It is. 
 
LG: 
[??] 
 
IC: 
I mean, it’s a very gratifying job. My wife often will make a remark like, “You get to do 
something that makes a difference.” [Laughs] Thinking, “But you’re doing something 
that makes a difference as well.” 
 
LG: 
One of the things – this is just a side comment from me – that I really learned about, is I 
am – I mean, I am not a science person anyway, so it’s not like I would have ever gotten 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 31 
 
into med school – but I am very glad it’s not something that attracted me, because I don’t 
think I could do it. You know? I honestly don’t. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. I think there is definitely a personality that’s attracted to medicine. I think for most, 
there’s some hubris that goes on with it. 
 
 
You know, when I was a resident, I was talking with one of the senior residents who was 
looking for a job. And he was telling me the job offers he was getting, and the amount of 
money. And that just was unfathomable to me. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
I was like, “That is so much money. How?” I was like, “That’s crazy.” And he just 
looked at me and said, “I want you to think about how many people there are around that 
can cut you open, rearrange your intestines (or rearrange your body in some way), put 
you back together, and not think twice about it?” 
 
[1:01:02] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And you think, “Wow; I mean, that’s, that’s – it’s weird.” 
 
LG: 
It is weird. 
 
IC: 
[Laughs] That’s a weird job, to have someone pay you to cut them open, rearrange them, 
and sew them back together.  
 
 
And then you start thinking well, and then you’re expected to do this at a high level every 
time –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And there really is not a lot of people that can or would do that. And so, then you start – I 
guess that’s probably –  
 
LG: 
And the amount of sacrifice, I think –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That it took to get to that place. 
 
IC: 
Well exactly. I mean, there’s a lot of financial sacrifice – I’m still paying off student 
loans. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 32 
 
 
IC: 
I’ve been in practice 13 (almost 13) years now. And I have got a lot of student loans left.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And you know, I put off a career for – I was 36 when I finished my residency, so you 
know, that’s 14 years a lot of people have time to invest and start building their 
retirement, that I lived off of nothing. And so, there’s a lot of catch-up and there’s a lot of 
financial sacrifice upfront. So, I don’t feel bad about it anymore. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
I used to feel like it’s more money than I need and deserve. But looking at – I still have 
liabilities I have to take care of. 
 
LG: 
No, I think that’s an important point to make. Because I think (again) like a public 
perception of physicians is often like, “Oh, they’re wealthy.” Or you know, “They’re 
upper middle class.” 
 
IC: 
I think, yeah –  
 
LG: 
And I don’t think people really understand that other piece of the financial picture. 
 
IC: 
Well I think if you put the amount of money I made per hour, I don’t think it would be 
worth it for most people to work that hard, for that amount of money. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; yeah. 
 
IC: 
I mean, I make a good living; but I also work like crazy. And you know, I probably work 
– an average week is probably 50-60 hours, and I think that’s becoming more common 
(unfortunately) in this country, that people are working more and more. But it’s not 
uncommon to put in 80 hours a week, and to have ten hours of sleep over four days. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And to still try to perform at a high level. I mean –  
 
[1:03:33] 
 
LG: 
I had one physician who said, you know, “It has to be perfect.” 
 
IC: 
It does. 
 
LG: 
I mean, it’s not always perfect – it’s not always the reality, but –  
 
IC: 
But it has to be. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 33 
 
 
LG: 
That’s the expectation. 
 
IC: 
That is the expectation. No one wants to be that person that it wasn’t perfect on. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And you don’t want to have that conversation with anybody. I mean, I’ve had to have 
those conversations –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
IC: 
And there’s so many things that go into having a perfect outcome (or even a good enough 
outcome), that you know, everything – the stars really have to be aligning, often, for that 
to happen.  
 
 
And the fact that we do it so well, so often is amazing to me. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
Because there are so many, so many things that can go wrong, at any point. 
 
LG: 
It’s a big responsibility. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. And some of it you have no control over. You don’t have control over what 
someone comes in with their health problems, but they still need this surgery done. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And you have to decide what’s the best way to try to overcome all these other health 
issues that are going to hamper the outcome? 
 
 
So, I find the biggest thing is just set realistic expectations prior to surgery: “This is what 
could happen; this is why this might be a bigger problem for you. And you know, if 
you’re willing to take that risk, I’m willing to try.” And it’s worked fairly well. But 
sometimes you have things that happen that you didn’t – you’re just not sure, you know, 
“How did this happen?” 
 
LG: 
What – kind of moving towards this last question or two – what advice would you have 
for somebody who was thinking about going to medical school? Or what would you tell 
them, that you wish you would have known? 
 
IC: 
I don’t know that there’s anything that I didn’t know, going in, that I wish I would have 
known. There was a lot of things that I learned along the way.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 34 
 
 
I don’t really remember not wanting to do this, and so I was going to do it regardless. But 
the one piece of advice I probably would send (or tell people) was if this is what you 
want to do, then do it.  
 
 
It’s a perpetual cycle, I think, of you get into medicine, and you talk to the older 
physicians (who have been doing this for 20 or 30 years), and they’re jaded and they’re 
beat down, and they would say, “I would never do this again.” Yet, they continue to do it. 
 
 
And where you get people – like, “This was way more lucrative ten years ago, you know. 
I feel bad for you, if you want to go to medical school now; you’ll never make a good 
living and you’re going to come out with so much debt.” 
 
 
And I think that’s all secondary. I think if this is what you want to do, then that’s what 
you do. Everything else will work itself out. 
 
[1:06:37] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, you know, I was disarmed, I think, a little bit when I first started at how jaded some 
of the older physicians could be [laughs]. It just was, “You’re not giving me any hope; 
why are you telling me this? I’m just starting – I can’t turn back. I’m in too much debt. 
There’s no way I can not do this now. Why are you trying to dissuade me from wanting 
to do this?” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
And personally, I love what I do – I still love it. I still prefer, probably to most any other 
place, to being in the operating room, operating. And that’s my happy place.  
 
LG: 
Do you have a favorite tool? Did I ask you that? 
 
IC: 
No. 
 
LG: 
I’m just curious? 
 
IC: 
You didn’t ask me that. The right tool [laughs]. I don’t have a favorite. I think there are 
some advances in medicine that just are fantastic. [Sighs] Oh, what is this – let me think. 
 
 
Laparoscopy, for instance. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
So, laparoscopy is using cameras to do abdominal surgery; and it’s similar to arthroscopy 
in orthopedics, where they use cameras in the joint space. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 35 
 
 
So, the premise is that you make a small incision to get into a big space, and then use a 
camera to do all your visual stuff – so you’re actually not putting your hands inside the 
abdomen. But you make these small incisions, and you put tubes through the abdominal 
wall that allow you to pass back and forth, and change your instruments out. 
 
 
I think laparoscopy was a game-changer. That started back in the ‘80s, and really caught 
on in the ‘90s. And it’s just there had been significant advances in different ways to 
approach it, but we went from having these big incisions that would go from your ribs, 
down to your pubic bone (and multiple incisions, for some people, who had to have 
multiple surgeries).  
 
 
And the complications from those surgeries were adhesions, and bowel obstructions, and 
hernias. And so, you’d have to go back and re-operate on these people. (And we still have 
those people out there, that I still see, because they had these big surgeries.)  
 
 
And we can’t always do things with laparoscopy, but it certainly is more – we’re more 
skilled at doing that now then we ever have been. And more and more, this is being done, 
minimally invasive, through these small incisions. 
 
[1:09:25] 
 
 
So, I just always am amazed because I trained in the early 2000s where the only things 
we really did with laparoscopy were take out a gall bladder and take out appendix; 
anything else was a bigger incision. So, if you’re going to do a colon resection, or a small 
bowel resection, or take out any kind of a tumor – that was all done with a big incision.  
 
 
And I think doing a colon resection now, my biggest incision is, you know, maybe six 
centimeters, you know, where it was a six to eight, or ten-inch incision before. So, it’s –  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
IC: 
It’s significantly better. And I still, at the end of each of those surgeries, now look at the 
incision [laughs] when we’re done and just think, “This is amazing.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
This is just amazing that we are able to do this. Because I lived through the big incisions, 
and you know, some surgeons that trained me would tell you, “The bigger, the better.” 
You know, “We’re not here to give them a good cosmetic outcome. We’re here to get 
visualization; we want to be able to see what we’re able to do.” 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
And so, it’s crazy to me that I feel like I have better vision with a camera there: it’s 
magnified, I can see in corners and crevices that I couldn’t really see when the intestines 
are laying and just kind of splayed out all over where you want to be looking. So you can 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 36 
 
position the patient so that the intestines fall away, and look in these crevices that allow 
you to see things way better than, I think, doing it open. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
So, that’s probably my favorite. I still like getting my hands in the belly. There’s a tactile 
sensation, and there’s a smell –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
And it’s weird to say, but you just get this flood of senses when you have someone’s 
abdomen open and you’re playing with their intestines. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Huh. 
 
IC: 
I shouldn’t say “playing” I guess, but –  
 
[1:11:37] 
 
LG: 
It’s a little bit like playing. 
 
IC: 
I think it is, when you enjoy what you do. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
IC: 
It’s all playing. 
 
LG: 
Well I have interviewed other people, who do other kinds of professions, who have those 
same responses, you know – artisans, and stuff who talk about like metal, you know –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
When you’re melting metal, or forging it, or you know, gardening, or you know, anything 
that has that – they enjoy what they do –  
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Partially because of those tactile sensory experiences. So, it makes sense that even with 
surgery –  
 
IC: 
Yeah, it’s no different, you know? Blood has a smell to it, and you know, there’s even 
like when you have infected organs that have a smell – some of them are not good smells 
[laughs], but –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 37 
 
IC: 
But you know, there’s a subtle smell when you take out an appendix that’s just starting to 
infect (that isn’t over-infected). And you know, this morning I took out a gall bladder, 
and the same smell – it was slightly starting to get infected, and you have that first smell. 
I’m sure it’s whatever bacteria is growing there, but –  
 
 
You know, it’s definitely a you know, you call it a feast –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
[Laughs] But there’s all these overwhelming sensations that you get when you’re doing 
this, that stimulate your nasal sensory, and your touch, and sometimes you get the liquid 
on your face [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
Right [laughs]. 
 
IC: 
You know? But you know, the first time you get sprayed with blood, it’s this warm – it’s 
not as bad as you think. You’re like, “It’s really warm.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
IC: 
That’s the first thing, when I got the blood on the forehead, “This is very warm.” 
[Laughs] “And I hope it doesn’t go in my eye,” that was my second thought. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
IC: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Well is there anything else, you know, that we haven’t talked about, that you feel is 
important for people to know, or that you would like, you know, the public to know about 
what it’s like to be a surgeon? 
 
[1:13:55] 
 
IC: 
I think the vast majority of surgeons, despite everything they may look like on the 
outside, want to do right: they want to do what’s best for their patient. And I think there 
are very few people who have ulterior motives, for other reasons, whether it’s, “I only do 
this for research.” Or, “I’m only doing it for the money.” 
 
 
I think the vast majority of people, first and foremost, want to do right by their patients, 
and they want to make sure that they do a good job. I mean, like any other professional, 
or anybody else who loves what they do – I think they strive for excellence in whatever 
they do. 
 
 
And I wish we were always perfect, as I’m sure [laughing] that all the patients wish that 
we were always perfect. I think there are very few cases of really gross negligence. And I 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 38 
 
think what people don’t see is the agony that we go through when things don’t go well – 
whether it’s our fault or not our fault. 
 
 
And you know, more than once I’ve had patients who don’t do well. And you, for weeks, 
or days, or months – you live with it, every waking moment, you think about it.  
 
 
If you have a complication that, again, may or may not have been your fault – it stays 
with you, and you replay that in your head every, single day for weeks and weeks and 
weeks, to see, “How could I have done this differently? What would have changed if I 
would have done this or that? How,” you know, “how could I do this better next time, so 
that this doesn’t happen again?” 
 
 
And there are times when you feel defeated because things don’t go well, and you want 
to quit because it’s just – you can’t do it anymore: you can’t take the letdown of letting 
someone down.  
 
 
And those are the – you know, fortunately, those are few and far between, you don’t have 
that often. But I think everybody who practices medicine, but specifically in surgery, 
where I think the stakes are a little bit higher – they all have patients they can point to and 
say, you know, “I’ll never forget this patient. I’ll never forget what happened.” 
 
 
And you know, I have a patient I think about, you know – two years ago I had two 
patients, three patients (actually) that things did not go well. And you know, you wonder 
– “Was it my fault? Did I do something wrong?” 
 
[1:16:58] 
 
 
And some of them you think, “Yeah; I could have done this way better and I didn’t do 
that.” And other times, you just – no matter how you play it out, you cannot figure out 
how you could have done it better, to have changed the outcome.  
 
 
And you know, it’s been almost two years since the first of those; and I still think about 
that on a regular basis (fortunately, not daily) – but you know, maybe every other week. 
And you know, she’s better and doing well. And you know, I haven’t seen her for well 
over a year; but it still – it doesn’t go away. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
It’s not something that I can get rid of. And I think about it every time I’m doing that 
surgery again, it comes up in my head. And you know, “How do I change?” Or, “How do 
I not do that on this patient?” 
 
 
And sometimes you’re filled with doubt, you know? It’s like, “How can I do this surgery 
again without messing up, or without having this same outcome?” 
 
 
And you just have to power through that. 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 39 
 
 
LG: 
Do you feel like those kinds of experiences are traumatizing in any way? 
 
IC: 
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. 
 
 
You know, I didn’t want to do this anymore for –  
 
 
You know, you have one patient, and you know, it took a long time for me to have severe 
complications – you know, two years ago I had three patients with severe complications. 
And just as I was getting over the first one, the second one happened. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And then so, you deal with that, and you live with that. And then just as you’re thinking, 
“Ah, finally okay; I can take a breath,” the third one happened. And it just – at that point I 
just was, “Maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Maybe I need to stop doing this.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
IC: 
You know, “I can’t operate without hurting people.” 
 
[1:19:06] 
 
 
And again, I don’t think that (in some of those cases) I could have done anything 
differently. And you know, I think definitely –  
 
LG: 
That can still haunt you. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Even if you couldn’t have done anything. 
 
IC: 
Even if I couldn’t have done anything – you feel, you’re responsible for that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
You know? You’re the one that made that incision; you’re the one that cut that, or you’re 
the one that –  
 
 
You know, one of them I put a trocar, which is that tube that goes through the abdominal 
wall, through their gut and into the renal vein (which is the kidney vein). So, you know – 
it just, you know, you replay that and think, “How can I not do that again?” And you 
know, “Should I be doing this?”  
 
 
It happens to everybody: everybody who does what I do – everybody who is a general 
surgeon and uses laparoscopy, and uses these trocars will have a trocar injury – we all

have had them. But that doesn’t make it easy when you have one; it doesn’t make you 
feel better. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, of course not. 
 
IC: 
But you know, “Well at least everybody else has one.” You know, you incapacitate 
somebody’s life, and derail them for a while, and maybe left them with long-lasting 
problems that they will never recover from. And so, those things haunt you; they don’t go 
away. 
 
LG: 
Does the profession give physicians any resources or help them in any way? Or are you 
just sort of left to figure it out – these experiences, by yourself? 
 
IC: 
Yeah, not as a whole. I mean, we talk to each other a lot, you know. I think the way I got 
through some of those experiences was talking to my partner, or talking to other 
surgeons. And you know, just hearing enough, over and over again, they – you know, 
there’s nothing else you could have done, you did everything – you did this. Or, “This 
happens to everybody; you have to understand that it is going to happen.” You can’t be 
perfect –  
 
LG: 
Perfect. 
 
IC: 
You can’t see minute differences in anatomy, that you didn’t notice. But you think, you 
know, you should!  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
I sure want someone to see that on me! 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
And so, why shouldn’t I be expected to do that? Because if that happened to me, I 
wouldn’t be happy about it. It is what it is; I understand the other side of it, too. So, I’m 
sure I’d be okay with it, eventually; but I would be angry, and I would not like that. 
Nobody would. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; it’s hard. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
[1:21:44] 
 
 
So, I guess that’s the one thing – is I think people don’t realize how much you take that 
stuff with you, and you may never let it go. Because part of it, you don’t want to let go. 
Every time I do a gall bladder, I want to be able to make sure I see all my anatomies, so I 
don’t have an injury. Or every time I put a trocar in, I want to know that, “Yeah, I put a 
Physician Oral History: Ian Cavin 
Page 41 
 
trocar through someone’s stomach, and I’m not going to do that again. How can I see that 
better, so this doesn’t happen again?” Knowing that it certainly still may. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That’s hard. 
 
IC: 
And the subtle differences are sometimes so subtle, you just don’t see it until it’s too late 
(or you don’t notice it until after it’s done). Or, sometimes you don’t notice it even after 
it’s done, and then they get sick and they come back, and you’re like, “Oh, great.” 
 
 
I’ve not had that – but I’ve taken care people that that’s happened to. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Alright. Well is there anything else you would like people to know? Either about surgery 
–  
 
IC: 
Take good care of yourself. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Don’t come see you? 
 
IC: 
[Laughs] Yeah. Stay out of my office if you can. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
It’s an odd thing, where I benefit financially and professionally from people who don’t 
take good care of themselves.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
IC: 
It’s definitely – it’s a weird dichotomy, where you don’t want people to take poor care of 
themselves, but then I’d be out of a job if they didn’t.  
 
 
But I do – I want people to take good care of themselves [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Of course. Of course. 
 
 
Well thank you so much for talking with me. 
 
IC: 
Thank you, yeah. 
 
LG: 
I really appreciate it.

IC: 
This was fun. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, it’s so fun to talk to everybody. 
 
 
I’m just going to do a closing tag. 
 
IC: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
So, again – this is Lisa Gabbert, I’m talking to Dr. Ian Cavin here, in Draper, Utah (in his 
office). And today is June 13th, 2020. 
 
IC: 
January. 
 
LG: 
Or I’m sorry – thank you. January 20th, 2020. 
 
IC: 
January 13th. 
 
LG: 
We’re going to clarify this date here –  
 
IC: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
January 13th, 2020; I didn’t put on my glasses, that’s why. 
 
IC: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Thank you.
