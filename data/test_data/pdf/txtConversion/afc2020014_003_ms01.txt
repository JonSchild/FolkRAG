Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Megan Brakeley 
December 17, 2020 
Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Megan Brakeley is the Food and Garden Educator at Middlebury College in Middlebury, 
Vermont. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Megan Brakeley joined 
the interview from Middlebury, Vermont, and Katie Reuther joined from Chittenden, Vermont. 
Interview Log 
00:00:00 
Introductions 
00:00:34 
Megan grew up in the 1980s with two working parents (a 
teacher and an 
engineer) and two older siblings. Megan's family prized meal time together. They 
were influenced by the various places they lived, including Birmingham, 
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Cooking and making homemade meals was 
important, but not necessarily cooking from scratch (meaning they ate 
"convenience foods" like Toaster Strudels, Hot Pockets, Hungry Jack mashed 
potatoes, and Minute Rice). Their food culture was more about the time spent 
together than the foods they ate. Megan describes a 
typical school lunch, which 
she classifies as classic 1990s white middle/upper-middle class American 
suburban foods. 
00:04:06 
Megan was raised in a 
way where there was no snobbery around food. Food 
sustained them, and they were grateful for it. Megan was taught to appreciate food 
and value that it took time and effort to cook and prepare, but she was not 
thinking about the production side of it. Now, there are many elements that play 
into Megan's work and how she sees food, such as: how politicized and charged 
conversations are around where food is right now; how privilege intersects with 
that; who has access to food; who gets to choose what gets eaten; and who can 
afford fresh or organic produce. 
00:05:50 
Megan's consciousness around food developed during her time at Middlebury 
College from 2002 to 2006. Megan was surrounded by people who felt very 
differently about food than she did. As a 
freshman, Megan went to a 
friend's 
house during winter break. Witnessing how different their family's food traditions 
were from hers shook her. She thought she knew about baking and cooking, but 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020

seeing more formal technique at her friend's house made Megan realize the 
nuance and meaning it could bring in another family. Megan found that for 
another friend's family, The Vegetarian Epicure cookbook by Anna Thomas 
meant something deep to their family identity. 
Sophomore year of high school, Megan transferred to a 
private school where her 
mom taught. She had a 
lot of Indian friends, and through attending their opulent 
sweet-sixteen parties, she was exposed to their food traditions, banquets, and 
party-style foods. Their embrace of food was so much about their culture as first-
generation Indian Americans, which felt new to her. This stood apart from 
Megan's later experiences with her friend's family in Minneapolis and their love 
of The Vegetarian Epicure. 
00:10:20 
As a 
transracial, transnational Korean adoptee, Megan spent a 
lot of her youth 
wishing other people would see her as as white as she saw herself. Feeling like an 
outsider, Megan's urge to fit in made her want to embrace what she saw as 
American (i.e. white culture). 
00:12:05 
Megan's time at Middlebury began to shift her thinking about food. In the early 
2000s, there were many new conversations emerging around food, including ideas 
about the carbon footprint, food miles, examination of conventional agriculture, 
cradle-to-grave production, and environmental externalities that result from 
business choices. Through taking environmental studies courses, Megan realized 
how much she did not know. 
Megan's family is religious and conservative. Most of her social circles in 
college were pretty liberal, and her friends were very open about condemning 
choices around food that happened to apply to Megan's life. Being exposed to a 
lot of different ideas got her thinking about how we all collectively move toward a 
more sustainable future. Before getting into any of the activism and policy work 
her friends were interested in, Megan wanted to dive more deeply into her own 
choices and understand her own impact. This brought her to food production. 
00:15:48 
Looking back, Megan says her journey makes more sense than it did at the time. 
As an undergraduate and young adult, she did not know where exactly she was 
headed. After graduating from Middlebury, Megan knew she wanted to do 
physical work that was not so academic. She had mentors that got her into skiing, 
fly fishing, winter camping, and exploring the backcountry. She also loved 
working with kids and wanted to work in education in some way. 
Megan followed her then-partner to a 
remote location in the Adirondacks and 
found her dream job as a 
Food and Garden intern at a 
small, independent middle 
and pre-middle school. It was a 
three-acre organic farm where they made maple 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
2 
syrup with buckets and had riding horses and a 
variety of other animals that 
they grazed rotationally. She got to learn a 
little about everything right off the bat, 
and often found herself in situations where she had to teach students about things 
she had just learned how to do herself (like harvest chickens). 
00:19:16 
This was Megan's first experience with farming and agriculture. 
00:19:38 
Megan loved this job, because there was so much to learn. She loved sharing the 
wonder of it all with children and helping them answer their questions. It was a 
fun expansion of Megan's world, a 
world that was already in front of her and had 
not been considered. She also loved the physical parts of the job and feeling 
strong in her body and rooted in place. Megan came to appreciate a 
very rural 
lifestyle, how their team became close and relied on each other, and how special it 
was to see a 
tiny microcosm of a 
community working together in this way. Alice 
Waters called that school "the original edible schoolyard." It was an empowering 
experience for Megan that really hooked her. After spending so much time 
deconstructing literature and culture in her academic, liberal arts education, it felt 
invigorating to lose herself and be totally present in the material world where 
there were real consequences. 
00:23:36 
Megan describes how she has thought about her Asian American identity 
throughout her life. While working at the school in the Adirondacks, there was an 
undercurrent of conversations around who were students of color, who were 
scholarship students, and who were full-pay students. As a 
student of color who 
attended a 
relatively expensive private high school on scholarship, Megan was 
always aware of socioeconomic standing and where she felt she fit into the 
picture. She carried that idea of herself as a 
financial aid student for a 
long time. 
In middle and high school, where Megan was one of the few visible students of 
color, she frequently experienced being featured in promotional brochures with 
the other students of color. 
For the most part, her identity as an Asian American was not at the forefront of 
her mind in the work she was doing as the Farm and Garden intern. She 
celebrated more the fact that she was a 
woman learning how to drive a 
bulldozer, 
run a 
chainsaw, and back up trailers. That felt more accessible at the time. 
Megan's relationship with her identity as a 
Korean adoptee is complex, and it has 
taken her thirty-five years to come around to having conversations about it. She 
was too scared of her identity and what it contained in her twenties. When 
strangers would ask her very prying questions right off the bat, it hurt and 
annoyed Megan. She tended not to want to answer those questions, but never felt 
like she had permission not to until she was in her thirties.

As a 
woman and small person in the Adirondacks, Megan wanted to be hiking and 
fly fishing, sometimes alone. She sometimes found herself terrified for her life 
and ended up getting a 
large dog who was her companion all day, every day. 
When he was with her, she never worried. She is unsure if that fear was centered 
in her Asian American-ness as much as it was in her other-ness. 
00:31:12 
In 2007, after finishing her job in the Adirondacks, Megan followed some 
Middlebury friends to Portland, Oregon. They rented five houses together and 
Megan got a 
job farming in Silverton, Oregon. When that seasonal role ended in 
the fall, she was hired as a 
kids' ski instructor at Mount Hood. 
00:33:28 
Megan loved working on farms. Fortunately, she had some great farmer mentors 
who wanted to share their knowledge and lift up the next generation of farmers. 
Learning through practice, repetition, kinesthetic moment and spatial awareness 
clicked with Megan, and she learned a 
great deal at each farm. Everywhere she 
worked, she kept a 
mental checklist of the practices she liked and disliked, or 
what she would include or exclude on her own operation. 
Due to her financial position, Megan never kidded herself that she would have her 
own farm one day. For her, being a 
farmer was about purchasing land. Her parents 
were both the first in their family to attend college, and her dad's father ran a 
John 
Deere dealership. Her dad grew up in a 
rural farming lifestyle, and vowed never 
to do it again. When Megan's parents saw her falling in love with farming, they 
supported her but also wanted her to think about things like having health 
insurance and paying for loans, car payments, and insurance. Megan notes that 
most people do not see farming as viable career pathway, especially if you want to 
have a 
family or a 
certain way of living. 
Ironically, Megan ended up starting her own farming business. While talking with 
the parents of a 
Middlebury College friend, they offered her the opportunity to 
farm on a 
piece of land they owned in Vermont. Some months later, she moved 
back across the country and started drawing up business plans. Their generosity 
and kindness still astound her. They believed in her and provided her with land, a 
place to live on the property, and upfront capital to get started. 
Not long after arriving in April, Megan started to wonder how she would afford to 
live. She found a 
position teaching Spanish and taught high school Spanish and 
Environmental Studies at another school while she ran the business (Green Peak 
Farm) for four years. She says she made it work by piecing things together, trying 
to make the most of what was available in the moment, and dumb luck. 
00:41:22 
Megan was twenty-five years old when she started Green Peak Farm. 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020

00:41:34 
Megan did not see Asian American farmers before she started farming, and has 
not seen many since. 
00:42:15 
Megan says she enjoys breaking into ivory towers built by wealthy white men. 
She loves fly fishing without thousands of dollars worth of gear. She loves skiing 
and back-country skiing. When on outdoor trips, Megan was almost never 
accompanied by women friends unless they were there under some obligation to 
their romantic partners. Until recently, many of these activities, such as mountain 
biking and back-country skiing, were very gendered. Not having seen any Asian 
American farmers before she started farming did not impact her in a 
conscious 
way. 
00:44:33 
Megan talks about the process of starting her own farming business. She began by 
drawing up business plans and deciding on her niche. She realized quickly that if 
she didn't love the work, she wouldn't do it, and if she didn't do it, no one else 
would. This factored into her idea of sustainability and motivated her to find 
things that fed her mentally and emotionally. 
Looking back, Megan realizes how much groundwork she could and should have 
done beforehand. She was already an outsider, but crashing the farmers market 
with what she was doing was perceived in a 
lot of different ways. Over time, 
Megan built more relationships and got to know the community. 
She knew early on that she did not want to overstep or overpromise. She never 
saw a 
large farm operation as viable, in part because she was not drawn to 
maximizing efficiency in everything all the time. Instead, she tried to be creative 
about the skills she had and the things she could offer. In Oregon, Megan worked 
on a 
certified organic flower farm, helping to lead a 
harvest crew and sell flowers 
to florists. She loved flower arranging, and figured that if she could grow and 
arrange the flowers for one wedding a 
year, that would pay for the rest of farm 
operations. Raising meat chickens would also help to pay for things. The 
vegetables were a 
fun bonus. She ran a 
small CSA (Community Supported 
Agriculture) that started with a 
handful of neighbors. The soil had been well 
tended in the past and was very productive. 
00:50:43 
Megan says most people did not know she was there unless they came across her 
at the Dorset Farmers Market. She also enjoyed taking pictures and writing posts 
for her blog. Megan's willingness to accept her identity as a 
Korean American 
was nonexistent at that time, so she did not grow traditional Asian vegetables. 
Instead, she had other offerings that set her apart, such as ramps and dry beans. 
Megan was one of two people of color at the farmers market. They would chat 
each week, and she says there was always a 
kinship there that they didn't talk 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
5 
about. She knew she could do well at a 
farmers market, because she likes to talk 
to people, but she also suggests that being distinguishable from other people in a 
very obvious way gave her a 
business advantage. She definitely stood out, but she 
likes to think that it was for reasons that she wanted to (like growing fresh shelled 
beans). 
00:54:30 
Megan taught and farmed for four years in southern Vermont. She was single at 
that time, which was difficult. She ended up meeting someone from Middlebury, 
and they started dating. After dating for a 
year and a 
half, Megan applied for the 
Food and Educator job at Middlebury College in 2011 and did not get the 
position. This prompted her to think about what else she needed to obtain the job, 
as it matched so many of her interests around education and agriculture. It also 
offered stability. 
Megan has struggled to approach full-time farming as a 
viable career option, 
because she saw how challenging that lifestyle was for other farmers. Despite 
how meaningful and powerful the work is, she also wanted health insurance and a 
steady income. In addition, the Food and Garden Educator position would allow 
her to be surrounded in community. The loneliness she felt farming by herself in 
southern Vermont was one of the hardest parts for her. 
Megan understood that Middlebury College wanted more credentials. As her GRE 
(Graduate Record Examinations) scores were expiring, she applied to graduate 
school as a 
last ditch effort. Without expecting it, she got into one of the 
programs and realized that it did not fit her plan. She was engaged at that point, 
and her fiance told her that he would not be going with her to school. Immediately 
after getting married, she moved to Connecticut to attend graduate school. 
After graduate school, Megan ended up back at Middlebury College working in a 
different role. Through a 
passing conversation in 2018, she learned that the Food 
and Garden Educator position had opened up again. When she later found herself 
in that position, she felt like the luckiest person in the world. 
Megan describes how she and her husband decided to make their lives in 
Middlebury. Her husband was already working at Middlebury College, and they 
wanted to raise their family where his parents are. Despite receiving lower rates of 
compensation for their work, they aimed for a 
rich quality of life, including four 
generations of people in one place raising a 
family. 
1:02:39 
Megan left her farm to move to Middlebury and go to graduate school. 
1:03:08 
When Megan did not get the Educator position at the College, she knew she 
wanted to continue on with farming and agriculture in some way. Teaching 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
6 
Environmental Studies while farming prompted her to think about education jobs 
and other ways to meld education and agriculture. 
1:04:47 
In April 2018, Megan started as the Food and Garden Educator at The Knoll at 
Middlebury College. The mission of The Knoll, an uncertified organic farm, is to 
explore food as a 
medium to cultivate wellbeing in people, place, and the planet. 
In 2020, they were really able to examine the idea of wellbeing and try to center 
anti-oppression and justice work as a 
starting point for their conversation around 
the topic. 
At The Knoll, they grow produce for the College's dining halls and for 
community partners to help address food insecurity, team up with classes at the 
College, support student and faculty course research, and host a 
variety of events. 
The garden was established in 2002, and they broke ground in 2003 while Megan 
was at Middlebury as a 
student. Even though she wanted to learn more about the 
garden and had friends who would share great stories about it, she never went out 
there due to her own insecurities. 
Megan has received important guidance from the previous two Food and Garden 
Educators, Jay Leshinsky and Sophie Esser Calvi. Jay is the original Food and 
Garden Educator, and Megan made a 
point to learn more from him about the 
history of The Knoll, his philosophies, practices, and knowledge of the site, and 
the particulars of managing a 
campus-based garden, which is quite different from 
a 
market garden. 
The Knoll is open to the public, but Megan says you feel like you are the only one 
there. She wanted to learn how to be a 
steward to this special space that had been 
carefully cultivated by the previous Educators. Megan never saw it as being her 
space, but rather as a 
space she had the privilege of helping to guide so it could 
best respond to student needs and input. Since its inception, The Knoll has been a 
student-centered space, designed and brought about by students. Learning about 
what it meant to be able to do that was one of the first things Megan did. Like 
most educators, Megan learns the most from her students. When she was hired in 
mid-April as the season began, volunteers would teach her how things had 
been done in the past. 
1:10:31 
The goals of managing The Knoll are very different from those of a 
market 
garden. First and foremost, The Knoll is not a 
business. It was in its early years, 
and the students felt they needed to prove their legitimacy by growing a 
lot of 
produce. The revenue they generated from the produce they grew ran the farm, 
which was the only funding they received at the beginning. 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020

By 2018, The Knoll was supported by the College's budget. Because The Knoll is 
not a 
business, Megan was released from feeling like she had to prove that she 
knew how to grow vegetables. She was given a 
large amount of freedom to design 
the program as she wished. 
Since they are not a 
business, they are not focused on the economics. On many 
small farms, the most limiting and most expensive resource is labor. They have an 
abundance of that at the College, much of which is new and not always 
predictable. Because they are up against an academic calendar, Megan has had to 
get used to the ebb and flow of labor availability depending on the time of year. 
In addition, The Knoll is a 
primitive site with no in-ground irrigation system or 
access to refrigeration or electricity. Without sun, there is no potable water. These 
considerations required adaptation, as did the understanding that The Knoll 
operates as one piece of a 
larger network that is Middlebury College and the 
Middlebury community. One of Megan's favorite parts of the job has been getting 
to see and step into the rich landscape of relationships The Knoll has, and to build 
that out as a 
new steward. She has also enjoyed learning about the many things 
that happen at The Knoll, because she previously had no idea how much goes on 
there. 
1:18:08 
When she took over the position, Megan brought her own insecurities about The 
Knoll from when she was in college, and her own assumptions about who saw it 
as a 
welcoming space. With that in mind, she set out to make The Knoll as 
inclusive and welcoming as possible. After her first season, she realized how 
many different groups were already coming out to the space. In spite of this, she 
also notes that there are serious physical accessibility challenges at The Knoll. 
The core of the program is centered in gardening. As Megan facilitated garden 
volunteer hours, she noted that the demographic breakout of volunteers was not 
representative of the College as a 
whole, with primarily white female/femme folks 
coming out. For her, earth work and the physical part of gardening has been 
healing, centering, and grounding, and she wanted to share that with others. 
When she started in her role at The Knoll, Megan was in her second year of 
mentoring her Posse. Middlebury is one of sixty or so partners of the Posse 
Foundation, which is a 
non-profit that supports high-achieving students from ten 
different cities around the country to attend their partner institutions as a 
cohort. 
Megan says being a 
Posse Scholar at Middlebury is often conflated with other 
identities, and people make a 
lot of assumptions. They are treated as a 
monolith, 
but the experience she had with her Posse could not have been more different. 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
8 
That experience of having close relationships with ten different people helped 
ground her approach to working in higher education. Specifically, it reminded her 
to be more mindful, because you never really know what people have going on. In 
college, there is so much that is core to our identities that is up for consideration 
again. 
It is a 
privilege for Megan to be able to think about what The Knoll is, what it's 
not, and what that allows them to do. If it is not a 
production farm, what are they 
doing there? They are working with people, and doing it in a 
way that is 
relational, not transactional. They are also providing rich learning opportunities 
and time to listen to each other. 
Megan wanted more folks from historically excluded backgrounds, including 
those who didn't have choices about how they could participate in agriculture, or 
those who were actively excluded from that space. However, she understood that 
would take time and trust. Also, knowing she had a 
lot to learn about the space 
and wanting to center students' voices, she did not go into the program with a 
specific plan of action. 
1:26:14 
Megan has always been interested in the ways that values and rules for 
engagement are explicitly written out or not in public spaces, especially the 
outdoors. She feels it is characteristic of majority white spaces not to name rules 
or provide clear guidelines. 
When she stepped into the role, nothing was written down about how to hold an 
event or have a 
campfire at The Knoll, nor was there a 
mechanism to 
communicate with volunteers. Megan has taken time to think about what 
information is available to people and how she can put out as much information as 
possible to make things more transparent (for example, a 
link 
for a 
live-updated conditions page and a 
list of volunteer hours with expected 
tasks for the week). 
Previously, people needed a 
lot of resources to have a 
fire at The Knoll, including 
the ability to access the necessary materials and knowledge. Megan has focused 
on writing out protocols and making them more visible to people. Now, they have 
a 
campfire kit and the option for a 
paid intern to provide the host with site and 
activity-specific knowledge. In her eyes, these things are all anti-racist. They are 
looking at the ways systems are set up and making them equally available to 
everyone, no matter their background. 
At The Knoll, they are also looking closely at the position descriptions for student 
jobs. Megan thinks that how we frame experiences and credentials, and what we 
name as essential qualifications, are critical for who we are able to hire and what 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
9 
kinds of experiences we are hoping to create for volunteers. In June, they 
published a 
statement affirming that Black lives matter, in which they named the 
fraught history agriculture and the economy had from the outset. That helped 
them refocus and name the goal of actively engaging with anti-oppression and 
food sovereignty work as their centerpiece. 
To do that, the students who are paid to support that work need to be able to 
do so with their skills and training. This has affected how Megan thinks about 
hiring practices, and how they name skills and practices so that students can 
expect to be actively trained and developed in those areas. 
If interns are students of color in the majority white space that is Middlebury, and 
then the extra-majority white space that is the garden sometimes, Megan takes her 
responsibility to support students through that very seriously. She feels it is 
necessary to build that into the position description, name it as work, and 
compensate for that, because there is already a 
lot of unpaid, invisible labor and 
burden carried by students of color on campus. 
Chief Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan band of the Abenaki, reached out two 
years ago to partner with them on a 
multi-mission project to preserve heritage 
seed, grow food for his community, and educate. They were eager to support him 
as much as they could by centering his tribe and their needs, providing 
educational opportunities that would bring about more conversations on campus, 
and harnessing and mobilizing the college's resources in order to support 
communities locally. 
Because The Knoll is not a 
production farm, they have moved more toward 
growing produce to match community-identified needs. The local chapter of the 
Vermont Gleaning Collective, centered at HOPE (Helping Overcome Poverty's 
Effects), is an amazing resource. Within this partnership, they try to fill in gaps 
where they can by growing what HOPE cannot get elsewhere. More broadly at 
The Knoll, they are trying to work in a 
way that is led by the community. Being 
responsive to requests is another way they have been working toward anti-racist 
and anti-oppression goals. 
In the fall (2020), they hosted a 
gathering of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of 
color) environmental leaders and BIPOC students that fostered relationship 
building and uncovered a 
desire for programming that creates affinity spaces. In 
the past at The Knoll, aside from a 
few paid internships, most of the gardening 
work was done by unpaid volunteers. People who got the paid positions typically 
had previous gardening experience. This past fall, they were not able to pay more 
students, but they were able to offer physical education (PE) credit for 
volunteering. They offered this as a 
different way to honor students' time and 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
10 
commitment to being out there. In the spring (2021), they envision an affinity 
space PE class that meets weekly to build community and witness the arc of the 
spring season. For the summer, Megan would like to see a 
FoodWorks program 
that matches BIPOC students with BIPOC organizations in Vermont to do food 
and agriculture-related work. 
At The Knoll, they also hosted a 
BIPOC affinity space in partnership with the 
College's Anderson Freeman Center after the November election. The temporary 
closure of the Anderson Freeman Center due to COVID capacity restrictions gave 
Megan the opportunity to offer an important reflection space at The Knoll instead. 
1:43:45 
It is fun for Megan to be back at Middlebury in this role. She loves getting to 
know and learn from Middlebury students. Megan never imagined she would live 
in Middlebury. Becoming a 
mom has offered her new perspectives into her 
identity, what she is willing to explore, and how she embraces that with her kids. 
Her spouse is one-quarter Japanese, and his mom has been an important mentor 
for her. Megan has learned so much more about Asian culture from her spouse's 
mom and her Japanese heritage than she has ventured to know about her own 
Korean heritage. The ways her spouse's mom shares about their culture have been 
fun for her, and they have opened up new ways for Megan to get to know Korean 
culture. She just started to explore Korean cooking and Korean food more 
recently, but she has known for a 
long time that when she eats a 
bowl of rice, 
kimchi, and a 
fried egg for breakfast, everything in her body works better. To 
embrace this idea in a 
more active way has been powerful. She credits her 
spouse's family for helping to lead her there. 
Megan says that when Vermont calls itself "so white," it completely erases the 
people of color who are there. Megan's family moved around a 
lot when she was 
younger, and she always longed to be the person who lived in the same house for 
a 
long time. As she, her spouse, and their kids spend time with her spouse's family 
every day, it is surreal for her to realize that they are doing what she always 
wanted: putting down roots. 
As an adoptee, she never felt like she was white enough, and she never felt like 
she was Korean enough. She always dismissed the idea of going to Korea, 
because she was afraid of how authentic her experience would be there. The quest 
for authenticity, as if there is some kind of genuine experience or the only way to 
be something, was an ethos she held onto for way too long. She was also afraid 
that if she dove into history or tried to research her birth family, it would hurt her 
adoptive family's feelings or somehow convey that she was ungrateful for the 
opportunities she has had in her life. From a 
young age, she knew that it would be 
Megan Brakeley Interview Log, December 17, 2020 
11 
a 
lot to pursue history around her adoption story. She was not ready to do that 
work or hold those questions, and she was always pretty able to set that aside. 
Being able to put roots down in Middlebury and being older has put Megan closer 
to a 
place where she realizes no one is judging her, and no one cares what she 
does. She studied Spanish for a 
long time and traveled to a 
lot of Spanish-
speaking countries, so she had an idea of an authentic experience and what that 
was like. Because the idea of arriving in Korea and not being able to speak 
Korean horrified her, she decided she had to learn Korean first. Now, though, she 
recognizes how unrealistic this expectation is, especially for a 
mom who is just 
trying to keep things together day-to-day.

Megan says she did not actively see her work in food and agriculture as a 
way to 
connect with Korean culture. For the past few years at The Knoll, they have 
grown daikon radishes. It has been fun to experience growing different varieties, 
and to think about the climates, soils, and environments that would host these 
crops. The more she gets rid of her pretensions and can appreciate and trust 
embodied knowledge, practice, and experience, the more she wonders if her 
family were Korean farmers. Certain parts of Korea's climate are not dissimilar 
from Vermont, and getting to know Korean food has been really fun for Megan. 
Megan feels grounded in old practices (like fermentation) that came about in 
seasonal, temperate climates where the harvest comes in the fall, and you have to 
put it up and make it last. As someone committed to small-scale, local agriculture, 
that is what Megan was already doing anyway. She compares fermentation's 
multi-organismal, ecosystem approach to the American craze around sterility and 
the dangers of botulism and canning. Fermenting foods speaks to the ecosystem 
of her body in ways that are more than superficial. The older she gets, the more 
she is willing to embrace and trust that.

The communities Megan has found to be integral to her j 
ourney as an Asian 
American farmer are different than the ones she hopes will be integral in the 
future. She let herself think for too long that there are not that many Asian 
American farmers. Although she does not currently know any others personally, 
she is eager to see what they can build, especially in Vermont. 
Megan has also felt community in family, in the northeast, and in the community 
created around NOFA (Northeast Organic Farming Association) Vermont. 
The Releaf Collective, a 
new group created for and by BIPOC to advocate for 
racial equity in land, the environment, agriculture, and foodways, has been one of 
the most meaningful communities she has been a 
part of, especially now. She 
finds solace and company in the Releaf Collective, and she is able to approach 
conversations around racial equity and their racialized experiences from a

different starting point than with white friends or in an all-white group. She 
partially attributes this to not giving herself permission to see herself as Asian 
American. 
Megan ties this to the summer of 2020 and the state-sanctioned lynchings and 
devaluation and erasure of human lives. She asks, where do we go from there? 
What does it mean to do justice for and in honor of the lives that were lost? 
Megan is both excited and terrified that we can even begin to start some of these 
conversations that have been in the room for so long but never voiced. Opening 
up the complexity of that for more people to hold than just the people who have 
always been holding it feels like a 
move in the right direction.
