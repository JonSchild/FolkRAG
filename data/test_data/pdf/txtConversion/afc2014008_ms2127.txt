Folk Arts is in time bizarre situation of equipoise:

one of the three or four remaining highly skilled Haida Indian basket
 
makers of Alaska recently consented to demonstrate for a Folk Arts funded
 
film her centuries old craft.  This is the first time this craft has been
 
carefully documented; it will probably be the last.  A Haida basket is a
 
human invention as breathtakingly original, as nobly utilitarian, as creatively
 
stirring as a Greco-Roman temple, or a grand piano, or a laser-beam sculpture.
 
It is a contribution to human knowledge of the first order of excellence.
 
The private sector has had a long time to fund a film that carefully
 
depicts Haida basketry for the benefit of future generations -- perhaps as
 
long as 2
,000 years.  This project, however, awaited the National Endowment
 
for the Arts.
 
For another example from the same section of the United States, in
 
February of 1980, the National Council on the Arts approved a grant of
 
$12,860 to the Chukchi Community College to help prepare ten bi-lingual rad'
 
programs of
' Point Hope Eskimo legends and myths.
 Last month, along with a
 
formal report concerning the disposition of t
hese funds, the following lett
 
arrived from the senior Eskimo participant:
 
"I told the stories.  
,
ib i  translated them.
 I did my best-  To
 
tell them, and the truth about them.
 
"I tried to please.  The papers are the proof of the work.  What is
 
in here, I did my best to tell it right.  Work about our p
e o p le gets back
 
"The things you have written will give you the power to show them what
 
we tve done.  Three sticks can't be broken."
 
(
signed) Jimmie Killegvuk
 
Mr. Killegvuk writes not only an admirably concise and business-like
 
letter, he states a profound truth.
 In spite of the fact that, to the Eskimo,
 
these stories represent their Odyssey, their Midnight Ride of Paul Revere q and
 
parts of their Old Testament, actually broadcasting Mr. Killegvuk's versions
 
over the radio required two additional elements: a literal English translation
 
by Mr. Tukummiq, and a further translation by a brilliant young poet q Tom
 
Lowenstein, to create for Anglo ears the literary power of the original texts.
 
This is necessary because there are so few Eskimo speakers left, even among
 
Eskimos.  With those three elements in place, the sticks could not be broken g 
stories in Eskimo could actually be broadcast over the radio.
 
It seems to me that in one sense the overall work of the Arts Endowment
  
is to help recognize the sticks that must be gathered and the pattern into
  
which thev must be aligned before an artistic event of national magnitude
  
and excellence can take place.   
This is the part of the job that the private
  
sector does not seem to be very interested in, strangely enough. The private
 
sector seems to like to follow along with the money after the Endowment has
 
made its usually very small investment and has thereby pointed the way to the
 
interesting, the exciting, the creative g the future potential.
 
2
 
Last week we heard that Mr. Killegvuk, a respected elder of his tribe,
 
died since sending us his letter.  One of the original three sticks is gone,
 
but its place has been taken, however partially, by the radio programs
 
themselves, now safely on tape and available for broadcast to Eskimos across
 
the top of the world.  We did our best too.  We tried to please.  The papers
 
are the proof of the work.  Three sticks can't be broken.
 
I believe these sentences are true for the whole of the Arts Endowment.

Dearest D
orry and B
ill,
 
I
t was s
o nice to see you last week, and the two of you l
ooking so well.
 
The only thing that perturbed me a bit was B
ill's eyes.  Are you sure,
 
B
ill, that you have availed yourself of the most recent medical advice about
 
your cataracts?  There i
s now, I understand, a much simpler surgical procedure
 
than the one Butch went through, and the results -
-
 though never l
ike your
 
own oroginal equipment in terms of f
lexibility -
-
 enable you to do a l
ot.
 
"Anything beats a b
lank", a
s my domino-playing s
ister-in-law used to say,  and
 
I think Butch f
ound that, on the whole, to be true.  I
t might be worth your
 
consulting a specialist f
or a second opihion, just to satisfy yourself and
 
your worrisome daughter-in-law...
 
I have thought a great deal about our conversation concerning your e
state.
 
I
n the f
irst place, I am s
incerely f
lattered that the two of you, who have
 
done such a f
ine job of building and maintaining your own f
inancial independence,
 
should decide to consult me.  The remarks I made at the time were off-th-cuff,
 
but, on serious reflection, I think I
 will s
tand by them.
 
_ 1
 
1
)  I
t s
eems to me there are two l
ogical and totally understandable
 
ways of passing a
long your property: d
ividing it two ways between the Carey
 
children, or d
ividing i
t four ways between the Hawes and Carey children.  I
 
remind you again that you have a
lready helped the Hawes children (
and their
 
families) in ways that you may not have kallind had occasion to help the
 
Carey children.  (
Of c
ourse, I only know the details of what you did f
or me
 
and Butch.)
 
2
)  Basing your l
ong-range planning on individual needs, as you now
 
may perceive them, seems to me a weaker position and one l
ikely to cause
 
c
onfusion and dismay.  Needs vary enormously both through time and through
 
c
ircumstance, and there i
s absoltely no way to predict them.  I can see this
 
in terms of my own f
amily.  Corey and Mike went to Canada some years ago, jobless
 
and with very l
ittle money to t
ide them over; as non-citizens, their f
inancial
 
outlook was grim, to say the l
east, and I expected them to return in due course,
 
i
n pretty much the same condition in which they went.  Instead, they have
 
itzit
.±ziA s
tabilized their f
inancial picture with great wisdom( An are current ly
 
i
n by far the best monetary shape of any of the three Hawes grandchildren.  Naomiis
 
and John's f
ortunes have fared just the reverse.  When they moved east from
 
California, they were in excellent f
iscal shape, with a healthy savings account
 
and a well-paying and regular job for Naomi.  Now, with two children to care for,
 
and Naomi's decision to s
tay home with them, they are getting along pretty much
 
day-to-day on what John can bring in free-lancing, a somewhat nervous s
ituation,
 
a
s I know f
rom personal experience.  I
 might add that i
t wouldn't z xsurprise
 
me i
n the l
east to see the two s
ituations reversed in another ten years or s
o.
 
Nothing surprises me much any more, and this i
s why I don't think you should
 
place your faith in what you can see now.  There are just too many possible
 
quirks in the road ahead that noneof us knows about -
-
 thank goodness.
 
3
)  If you want to take the short view, though -
-
 and there i
s no
 
reason why you shouldn't -
-
 you may feel that there i
s just not enough in your
 
e
state to go round.  Though I think you believe, with me, that your children
 
care f
or each other and will continue to do so in your absence, you may be
 
worrying that there i
s not enough for them to care for each other with.  In
 
that case, i
t occurs to me that youe have a
t least one other alternative: you
 
can maintain the trust ei you have set Xp up f
or yourselves beyond your own
 
l
ifetimes, the principal to be managed by your trustees, and the income to be
 
disbursed by then to your heirs as needed and according to your general
 
instructions.  This would have the advantage of maintaing your estate as
 
a unit, which would be more profitable, I should think, than splitting i
t
 
up.  Your l
awyer, I an sure, can tell you the benefits and difficulties of
 
such a procedure.
 
4
)  The one thing that I didn't say during our talk was that I
 
was personally surprised that you hadn't willed anything to some of the
 
causes you have spent your l
ives furthering.  Maybe you don't t .r
 think
 
there i
s money enouch.  I
'd l
ike to assure you, though, that I don't think
 
any one of your children would do l
ess than applaud any decision you might
 
make to g
ive a major donation to your vision of world peace or social justice.
 
P
lease understand -
-
 I
'm not urginign you to do anything you don't want to;
 
I
'm just trying a to assure you that this -
-
 of all times -
-
 i
s the moment
 
when you should do what you want to.

)  Overall, i
t seems to as that a)1 of us who face in the reasonably
 
near future the fact of our eventual non-ex
 should try to relax and think
 
of the positive values we have, we hope, implanted in our young.  They are the
 
ones who must l
ive in that future, and they will have to get along without
 
the benefit of our advice, counsel, and -
-
 let's face i
t -
-
 our control.  I
t
 
seems to me that a will should be a heart-felt passing on of l
ove andzuzet
 
warmth, confidente and f
aith -
-
 a kind of letting-go and God-speed -
-
 l
eaving
 
no mysteriest or questions to trouble anyone, in a time of trouble.  That i
s
 
honestly what I
 believe, and what I have tried to do in my own case.
 
This has been a l
ong l
etter.  I hope it helps,a a bit.  I
t comes to you with
 
my affection and approval, whatever you may decide.
 
L
ovingly,
 
Bess
 
Dear Mrs.  Specht,
 
I am  enclosing  a brochure  from  the  Folk  ASrts  Program  that
 
will  tell  you  how  to  nominate  yourself  for  a National  Heritage
 
Fellowship.
 Let me make  another  suggestion  as  well.
 You might
 
get  in  touch with  your  own  state  arts  agency  also.
 You mention
 
that  you would  like  to  terach others  your  art  form,  and  I know
 
they  have  an  artists  in  schools  program w
xt
t
N
x
t±
tx
 
as well  as  an  apprenticeship  program.
 You might  qualify  to  get
 
students  through  either  of  those  programs.
 Why  not  drop  a line
 
to Tim  Lloyd  
(fill  n address  please)  or  call  him  at
  
I must  tell  you  too  that  rag  ru g
 
making  is  not  really  a dying  art
 
I' m  enclosing  a little  brochure  from  the  Library  of Congress  that
 
tells  a few  things  about  it  and  talks  about  some  of  the  people
T
hround
 
Washington who  are  pracrtcing  it.
 I thought  you' d  like  to  have  it
 
for  your  own  library.
 
With  best  regards,
 
Sincerely,

Dear Nick (
 
Thank you for your nice card.  I have i
t pinned on my bulletin board;
 
I l
ove those rock-like, here-we-are-and-here-we'll-stay Cajun faces.
 
V
 
I
'm back from 9 days on the i
sland of Nevis where I luxuriated at
 
Roger Abrahams' father's place, being thoroughly spoiled and treated
 
l
ike a very f
ine lady indded.  A l
ittle of that is a very good thing;
 
I
 only wish everybody could have a turn.  As a matter of fact, why don't
 
you think about a couple of weeks recuperating there, when the chemotherapy
 
i
s over'  I
t's a physically l
ovely i
sland, full of f
lowers; the mangos
 
and papayas and 1
7 d
ifferent kinds of bananas are never out of season.
 
And when you get t
ired of absorbing a
ll those vitamins, you can ride down the
 
mountain and l
ie down in the lovely warm ocean on your s
tamach with your
 
face mask on and watch those extraordinary striped and polka-dotted yellow
 
and blue and s
ilver f
ish pursuing their mysterious business a
ll around you
 
and then drive back up the mountain to Morningstar (
the Abraham's place)
 
and drink s
oursop juice on the patio and watch the white cattle egrets
 
f
lying back to their roosting places a
s the evening comes on.  If I
 make
 
i
t s
ound idyllic, i
t's purely because i
t i
s.
 
I
t's a
ll very easy to arrange and doesn't discombobulate anyone.  Mr
 
Abrahams i
s only there from December through April and in between he keeps
 
his cook and g
ardener on salary anyway, and they kind of enjoy having
 
some company to fuss over and take care of.  Think about i
t.  Roger could
 
s
et i
t a
ll up with a s
ingle phone call, and off you could go whenever
 
your d6ctors say okay.
 
The other nice thing about Nevis i
s the people.  Maybe i
t's because i
t's
 
s
uch a very small i
sland, beither a resort nor a mineral resource, but
 
the f
olks I
 met are friendly, warm, and unabashed.  One day in the tiny
 
/
18th century village capital of Charleston, I suddenly heard, unbelievably,
 
a f
ife and drum band playing right over my head.  I l
ooked up, and there,
 
on one of the ancient s
tone balconies, were three aged gentlemen, one
 
playing bass drum, one playing snare, and a third on cane fife.  You could
 
have picked them up, all three, and dropped them down in Pecolia, Miss.,
 
and none of the l
ocals would have raised an eyebrow.  They ran through a
 
couple of choruses and marched down the outside stairway, out into the
 
s
treet, across the miniscule town s
quare down towards the beach, playing
 
with total conviction and that kind of f
ierce authority that i
s special
 
to some o
ld men.  Nobody paid them much attention, including me -
-
 I
 
was involved with assisting Hyacinth (
the Abraham's cook and worth a whole
 
l
etter on her own account) in negotiating the market-day scene -
-
 but
 
a falf an hour l
ater I followed their sound down onto the beach where the
 
f
ishing boats were drawn up and there they were still, playing in the
 
middle of a crowd of perhaps 300 people gathered to celebrate Nevisian
 
foodways.  I
t was their "Culturama" week, and, without benefit of folkloristic
 
advice, the l
ocals had decided their food was worth belebrating, too, and
 
so i
t was, indeed.
 
I
t brought back to me my own personal f
inest hour of the 1976 Smithsonian
 
festival -
-
 the opening moments of our infinitely worried, crampled, crimped,
 
and bureaucratically prayed-over Fourth of July celebration.  I don't
 
remember if you were down there or not, but I
 myself was at the Regional
 
"big s
tage" s
itting i
n a pargo, when the three old gentlemen from northern
 
Mississippi l
ed off the program.  There wasn't anybody there at all when
 
\
the program was supposed to begin, but they hauled themselves up onto the
 
)
stage and approached the licrophones with total security and complete
 
confidence and l
aunched, unbelievably, into "Glory, Glory, Hallelujah"
 
to a
ll those empty seats.  And they played i
t, and they played i
t, and they
 
played i
t;  By God, those three raggedy, crippled old gentlement were the
 
Spirit of 2076, if they were a day, and they weren't about to let go of
 
that moment, no way, no how...
 
I sat there with tears streaming down my face for a full half hour, partly
 
because I couldn't attract CBS or NBC or ABC or any of their assorted
 
media satellites to come down and l
ook at the real artists of the occasion,
 
but mostly because those three old men had realized what was important
 
about the moment and hit it dead on.  Eventually, some other people joined
 
the audience; I
 hope they got at least some sense of how much hope and joy
 
was theirs to call on.
 
I am enclosing a planning document I
've just lately prepared.  I would
 
enormously appreciate any comments you might have; i
t includes a
lmost
 
everything I
've been thinking about for the last few months, but i
t i
s
 
a draft, and i
t can -
-
 and must -
-
 be changed.  Telephone when you want
 
to talk about i
t if you l
ike.  I am of the old-fashioned generation and
 
would always rather write a letter when I have something particular to say,
 
but I realize I am way behind the times.  I do hope these lengthy screeds
 
I
've been sending are in no way a burden or a responsibility. Please call back.
 
Affectionate yai*m

I am gre. tly honored by your invitation to give this
 
year's

 ecture.
 I' ve always  liked
 
ethnomusicologis s,  you know -

 partly because they re
 
generally  just  sua
 a lovable bunch and par ly because  F know
 
of few other acade
 c disciplines that are  •oth so tole ant
 
and so self-assured  ts to allow and even e courage the
 
participation of outr ders  like myself.  Bu
 then,  here  you
 
are with the Seeger Lestures to put on,  a d Charles

himself was certainly mo e than a bit of an outride
 
verall one could describe  him as
 a sc olar of mus c,
 I
 
pose,  but then he was a so a compos:r 1
r
d an ar ,anger
 
an
 ditor arrd an educator,
-  
a state
 an and a bireaucrat,
 
and h-  worked a great deal  in matter
 to do with
 how music
 
might  • operly and effectively be i  luded in t e purview of
 
governme't,  and also how music
 ig
 itself af ect the course
 
of governm-nt.
 And he had a wic #o and witty side too;  his
 
son Pete te
 s me that  in the 30
 got the
 eeling that the
 
politics of t e day were  just a *it too sol-  n and he cooked
 
up a scheme witi  some musical
 riend-  to p
 out a series of
 
rounds about n c
 folks,  and
 e wrote
 he
 usic to several of
 
them.  including
 
Oh  joy upon

Comrade,  can

up to me and say
 
me?
 
Actually,  it's hard to think of a single .spect of the

 Charles S

opinion about

 There is  something so
 
old ballad style when the old ballad singers

Ex Scholars talk about kka literary ballad construction in terms
 
of its remoteness and universality,  but somehow the transmission  (from an
 
experienced singer)  is one on one,  not one on on /

thousand.  In ways,  listening
 
to Doug was a bit like listening to your father 
 the old family story that
 
tou' ve heard a million times,  yet once again.  It was terribly personal and
 
boring all at the sametime.
 
This is very
 different from the way I feel when I listen to most
 
songs/music,  folk as well as other kinds.
 The orchestra and the other singers
 
serve to depersonalize the message.  Somehow Doug makes me feel I ought to think
 
about going out and doing something about that Golden Muo&Hkx Vanityx situation.

her the way she and Ralph had determined to make a different world for their

hadn't worked.
 Later I began talking a bit about my thoughts of maybe writing

so many people into common understanding this way so that they can build a new life

what Marcy and

Dear Bess,
 
How can I begin to t
hank you--for your t
elephone call
 
as soon as you heard about Frank, and then for your very
 
wonderful letter which left out all the platitudes and go
 
right to the heart of what seems to be the greatest cause
 
for sorrow.  Sharing the same interests and, in a way,
 
the same sort of life, you know better than most people
 
how hard the breaking of such a long partnership seems t
o
 
be.  A hundred times a day I find myself planning to tell
 
Frank this or that (as you say you still do, in a way,
 
with Butch).  Yet in some deeper sense I am very conscious
 
of his presence.  Surely I know that this is not the end
 
of life.
 
I know there is much for which to be grateful.  We
 
had many wonderful years together--rich and satisfying on
 
many levels.  Frank loved people--all sorts of people--
and it is comforting to be reassured, as I am now on every
 
hand, that people loved and appreciated him.
 
I wish you could have been with us at the Matinecock
 
Friends Meeting House (built in 1725) across the road from
 
Friends Academy where Jeff and Gerret went to school--for
 
Frank's 'meeting.'  We had some Scripture reading and a
 
time of silence, and a few old friends talked about Frank.
 
Alan was our keynote, really, and what he said, and sang,
 
was moving and inspiring, and we were all grateful.  Jean
 
Ritchie sang '
Amazing Grace'--as Frank said long ago he
 
would like her to do on such an unlikely occasion.  Then
 
we had a party here at the house and a great deal of music.
 
Frank would have loved it all.

I have written Phil Marcus at N
EH but I haven't heard
 
from him.  I don't know what happens in a case like this.
 
I shall finish the book, of course.  We had made a lot of
 
progress and Frank and I were in complete agreement as to
 
what we wanted it to be.
 
Thank you enormously, Bess.  I shall be in touch again
 
soon.  Jeff and Gerret join me in gratitude and love.
 
God bless...

Dear Anne:
 
-
v
 
When Butch died, all his and my and our good friends rallied round and
 
consoled me in a perfectly splendid display of concern and tenderness.
 
Somehow, though, I kept feeling that they were all too worried about me,
 
that there needed to be more worrying about Butch and more thinking how
 
sorrowful it was for him that he would miss his grandchildren-to-come and
 
the various kinds of fun and happiness that would grace our l
ives in future.
 
Because things do go on happending, and every day there are things that I
 
wish he were here to share, not so much because I need him as because he
 
would have enjoyed them so much -
-
 and, danunit -
-
 he deserved that enjoyment.
 
i
J
 
I expect you are feeling that way about Frank (and that is why I am so
 
gauche as to mention my own personal sorrow, both for my husband and for yours.
 
Anne, I know that you are a tough and solid lady and that you will eventually
 
make for yourself -
-
 as I have made foy'inyse1f -
-
 a good l
ife on your own.
 
.

But I wo
 so
-
ke to 
,/'
out of our long friendships that Frank
 
3
f 
 had a food ife 
, as l
ong as he could be with us
, 
-
-
 partly because
 
of the grace, courage, intelligence and sensitivity that he brought to the
 
job of l
iving, but also because of what you contributed
 
The two of y o u
 
were a great team.
 
I suppose there were problems and disappointments and all that, i&t basically,
 
Frank Warner was a man who relished and savored and appreciated all the complex
 
and interesting aspects of l
ife, and he knew them in full measure.  He did
 
such a good job of living while he was here, and I am so happy that -
-
 l
ike
 
left so much of his work behind for new generations to learn from.
 
Please, dear Anne, if I can ever help in any way -
-
 if you want, for example,
 
a place to stay a while in Washington, or any kind of mediation with the NEH
 
folks, or anything e
lse in the world, give me a call.

Dear M
. Albanese:
 
"
Everybody Loves Saturday Night" was written by my husband, Baldwin Hawes.
 
He i
s dead.  I am his widow.  After he died, I wrote a
ll the companies
 
with which he had royalty accounts, and they a
ll sent his royalties in
 
my name except f
or t
he c
ompany that at that t
ime published "Everybody
 
L
oves Saturday Night".  They continued, in spite of all my efforts, to
 
send checks i
n his name, so I simply took them to the bank and cashed them.
 
You recently sent me a check a
s well as my husband.  I telephoned and spoke
 
to several people trying to straighten the matter out and was finally
 
advised to cash the checks and t
hen see what happened.  I did so.
 
I am enclosing my social security number.  I no l
onger have a record of
 
what my husband's was.  I guess the next move i
s up to you.
 
Sincerely,

Dear John Houseman:
 
I was sorry that I had to cancel our appointment in January.  I am not sure
 
"-
)
,
.,whether or not my recollections of the OWl period would be of particular use
 
to you; I was a very small frog in that puddle.
 
I could attest, perhaps, to the intense political atmosphere of the period,
 
especially in connection with music.  I recall having to break across my knee
 
a recording4. particulir Chopin polonnaise in order to prevent Mr. Raquello
 
(
the Polish"director-producer) from playing it on the air in the middle of
 
an especially delicate political period.  The particular polonnaise was
 
widely known to have been composed in celebration of the Poles' expulsion of
 
Russian Imperial troops during the 19th century; since Mr. Raquello was a
 
forthright Russianophobe, I rather questionned his motives in insisting on
 
playing it while Soviet troops were marching into Warsaw, even in the role
 
of liberators.
 
Mr. Raquello was a passionate man, and, though we differed violently on almost
 
every political point, I think he rather l
iked the fact that I was equally
 
passionate in my own terms.  We had some memorable confrontations, and from
 
y
\ 
him I learned not to be afraid of a shouting match.  I recall his coming to
 
me towards the end of the war, his eyes filling with tears, explaining why I
 
\
 
\
/ shouldn't schedule over1 ylight music in broadcasts to Poland.  "Remember
 
' 
how their feet look, Bess,'  he said.  "Those people they just turned loose
 
.
from the concentration camps, remember how their feet look in the newsreels.
 
L 
For God's sake, don't play music that is too fast for those feet to tap to... 
The other thing I remember is how young we all were down in the operational
 
divisions.  I was only twenty myself, and I was supervising l
ittle girls that
 
I
'm sure weren't over fifteen and who had lied nobly about their ages.
 (
Who
 
else could you get to staff the record l
ibrary 24 hours a day for $25.00 a
 
week?)  There was one lovely black child who went to high school all day every
 
day, ran home to "help mama" and then turned up every evening at 4
:00 to work
 
in the record l
ibrary until midnight.  She was worth her weight in platinum -
-
totally unflappable, completely reliable and brimming with a really personal
 
concern for the job and the people on the job.  A lost record, announcers
 
screaming at her in everything from Arabic to Lithuanian, emergency shut-downs
 
so that she couldn't go home or even phone at the end of her shift -
-
 she
 
stayed through them all, always warm, loving, hard-working, smiling her great
 
smile of happiness when the crisis was over and the record found.  I hope she's
 
raised a big family.
 
I
 
2
 
I
 write a
ll this because our brief chat on the phone turned me back into
 
a reminiscent mood, and what I really recall about those crazy days was the
 
sense of dedication I felt in the people I dealt with every day -
-
 the e
levator
 
operators, the errand runners, the truck drivers, the record l
ibrary c
lerks.
 
I think many of them really felt that for once in their l
ives they were doing
 
s
omething that was important, and that they themselves therefore were, for
 
once, important; and God knows they were.  So I wrote this out for you in case
 
you didn't get a chance to see and feel this as much as I d
id down in my
 
f
loor.

TO:  Jim, Ralph, Dick, Bob, Ernestine, Alan, Program Coordinators
 
FROM:
 Bess
 September 17,  1975
 
SUBJECT:
 Proposed festival food plan for 1976 (
as requested)
 
Consultation with the Program Coordinators confirms my earlier-stated
 
objections to the food service furnished by 051.
 These include:
 
failure to provide requested menus
 
poor quality food -
 lukewarm and tasteless
 
monopolization of most profitable food items
 
high prices
 
slovenly and inefficient service
 
In fact, there is no area of food service in which 051 meets even minimum
 
standards except for the doling out of calories to a large number.
 
This is a situation of real concern.  There is no culture in the
 
world in which food does not have meanings far beyond its physiological
 
function; and one of the hallmarks of ritual and celebratiof
lal activity
 
everywhere is the consumption of special and festive food.  There fore,
 
regardless of either our or GSI*s intentions, food is an intrinsic
 
part of our program and must be approached at that level.
 
Each item of food and drink served is a communication with the
 
Festival goer -
-
 a 5tat TnPnt concerning the social context (
this is a
 
party, a good time, different from every-day), a particular cultural
 
group (we're Native Americans and isn't our fry bread terrific) or a
 
geographic area (
this is California and here's where the olives grow
 
on trees).  When we serve such tacky and tepid concoctions as mass-
produced "honey dipt fried chicken  or water-logged half-ears of corn,
 
the stated message is that we are producing merely another run-of--the-
mill rip-off event.
 
As a symbolic substance, food seems to operate on two levels.
 
First, it says who you are; it is a form of personal identification.
 
The strength of this emotional identification goes far beyond the
 
simple requirements of nutrition, a very clear example occurring during
 
the 1975 Festival when the Italians refused to eat at all until they
 
were provided with pasta.  Quite literally, the Italian contingent were
 
identifying themselves as pasta consumers; if the appropriate food wasn't
 
presen ,  the Italians wouldn't be either.  The second way that food
 
operates may,  however, be of oven greater importance in Festival
 
management:
 food says what we think of you.  At a dinner party. one
 
can serve hamburgers or steak
 the nutritional content is about the
 
-2-
same, but the message to the guest is different.
 It is interesting
 
to speculate on the menu the director of GSI serves guests at his home.
 
Mass-produced food, then, convoys a mass message.
 If we are
 
forced for logistical reasons to handle a part of our food service on
 
a mass basis, then our strategy should be to look to those occasions
 
when Americans get together in large numbers for really convivial
 
activities and select which of those occasions and their associated
 
cuisines most closely reflect the spirit and concerns of our Festival.
 
Ball park hot dogs are a case in point.  Thousands of people at our
 
major league games consume well-f
 l& ored and tasty frankst the hot dog
 
is, indeed, so closely associated with the self-image of the United
 
States that during the thirties the Roosevelts served red hots to the
 
visiting King and Queen of England at a White House picnic.  Here is
 
a mass-produced and mass-distributed food item which means, to most
 
Americans, good times, a kind of youthful nostalgia, and a public
  
occasion (
since the ball park hot dog is unreproductible in the home
 
kitchen).
 
Non-mass produced food, on the other hand, conveys a non-mass
 
message.
 It speaks of home, or conjures up the place one hopes to
 
visit one day.  Therefore, the Festival should include a number of
 
small food services offering regional or ethnic foods.  These must be
 
prepared by speciali sts from the area or national group involved;
 
mass-produced imitations such as the taco platter or the Uerman
 
sausage and sauerkraut offered by GSI this past su m
aer are so far
 
below the standards set by our general program as to be demeaning.
 
The United States produces a variety of foodstuffs unparalleled
 
in other areas of the world.  We w e our many visitors in 1976 the
 
opportunity to wander through the Festival sampling this bounty,
 
visiting fresh-squeezed juice bars and sweet corn stands, hot tamale
 
and roast chestnut vendors, with occasional side trips to pick up
 
some barbecued chicken or a really find ice cream cone.  The
 
popularity of the Arabbers should convince us of the value, salability
 
and plain goodness of the many types of hand-held foods we would offer.
 
In s u
mming up the many staff suggestions, the following pattern
 
for food service has emerged as our ultimately desired scheme:
 
1
.  One, or at most  two, large structures serving carnival food
 
(hamburgers and the like).
 
2
.
 In Regional, Native Americans, Old Ways and Diaspora, medium-
sized food-dispensing structures equipped to produce full-plate
 
(complete meal) services of regional or ethnic foods, staffed by
 
competent cooks from the regions or ethnic group  involved.
 
3
-
.
 
3
.
 In Working Americans and the Childrens area, program-related smaller
 
food services -
 coffee, pie or doughnuts in Working Americans
 
juice, whild-sized sandwiches, etc. in the Childrens area
 
4
.  Throughout the Festival, a variety of push-cart or individual
 
booth servers of first-class hand-held foods.  These should be
 
mobile carts or small stands selling one or at most two food
 
items (
ice cream cones, hot sweet corn, juice, etc).
 
This may s exu a4ministratively complex; however, it is an extension
 
of the tatt rn already set in the Festival.  Each Festival area should
 
be administratively responsible for its own special food service, leaving
 
to the overall administration only the responsibility for the nobiie
 
vendors and the large structure food services.
 
Staff concerns may be summarized as follows
 
1.  GSI has served ne badly for too long.  We should rid ourselves
 
of it.
 
2.
 If we cannot, there are three essentials to stress in negotiations
 
a.  GSI has proven incapable of producing palatable full meals.
 
Its menu should be confined to carnival foods -
-
 hamburgers,
 
hot dogs, pretzels, beer, lemonade and the like -
-
 of top
 
quality and sold at a reasonable price.
 
b.  GSI should not be longer allowed to monopolize the sale of
 
beer, for some the sorest point of all.  Beer is an essential
 
part of some ethnic cuisines and forms an important point of
 
e.lf-image for American workers.  Besides, it often means
 
the difference between profit and break-even for local church
 
and community groups.
 
a.  We must be allowed to contract with individual producers of
 
high-quality specialized food items (e.g. Swensons ice cream
 
or fresh :
fruit juice bars) as well as with church and
 
community groups capable of preparing program-oriented regional
 
and ethnic foods.
 
3
.  Quality is the area of greatest staff concern.  Any food served
 
on the Mall must reflect our high opinion of and our genuine
 
concern for our visitors.
 
4
.  Fina11y  
,we must never be locked into a single food distributor
 
or a single type of food service.  The entire Festival turns on
 
a summons to Americans to come and celebrate the beauty of their
 
divor it7.
 Only in the area of food have we been letting thei
 
dawn.
 
The Folk Arts Program often turns down what seem like go
 
ideas,  because it believes that the project is being don
 
badly.
 It does no favor to a great tradition to present
 01
 
it in a careless,  inaccurate,  or unimaginative way.
 Wha
 
we need are projects  (products)  that are shiny,  hard,  an
 
defensible.

Bess Lomax Hawes,  Folk Arts
 
SU BJECT:  Folk Arts'  Five Year Plan
 
T O:  Phil Kadis
 
memorandum
 
The main problem is the general feeling that Folk Arts are
 
entirely concerned with the past,  down-right archaeological
 
in fact.
 On the contrary,  we represent the vanguard of the
 
nation's cultural future.
 We are concerned with presenting
 
and evaluating the many diverse cultural styles now present
 
within the united States from which so many varied and inter-
esting cultural futures can spring -
-
 and are springing right
 
now,  for that matter.
 If our strategies are even partly success-
ful, we look to a time when we in this country will neither be
 
chained into a single over-used cultural mode nor dependent
 
for inspiration upon the improvisations of individual creative
 
artists.
 The United States is uniquely fortunate to be the
 
living repository of the cultural wisdoms of the world.
 Shall
 
we not build upon those heritages?
 
Think about an old beat-up guitar.
 What should one do with
 
such an object?  What I did,  when I was fifteen, was to write
 
the notes of the chromatic scale on the neck underneath each
 
fret,  so that I could figure out the chords according to
 
principles I had learned in harmony classes.
 And I played
 
music that sounded like that -
-
 nice European tunes.
 I don't
 
in any way put them down;  they were pure,  and they were pretty.
 
A Black country bluesinan,  however,  would have gone about the
 
problem in a totally different way,  and he would. have made
 
music very different from mine.
 A cowboy picker would have
 
gone about it differently still and would have made a differ-
ent kind of music.
 So would a Mexican mariachi musician.
 
All of us would have been working within our own musical
 
traditions -
-
 trying to reduplicate and improve upon the
 
sounds already ringing in our ears.
 
What the Folk Arts Program is ultimately about is the preser-
vation of those different kinds of sounds
-
 
the many optional
 
musical systems open to guitar pickers.
 The same principles
 
apply to all the other art forms.

So how do we do it?  We do it just like the Music Program
 
or the Visual Arts Program -
-
 we publicly honor the tradi-
tional artists who best represent the highest quality of
 
each of these many cultural options.
 Bu±
' we' re starting
 
from behind,  so we have to work fast to make sure we
 
document and present the old-timers who won't be with us
 
so long.
 When those options are stable,- and those artistic
 
systems are functioning at their peak, we won't have to
 
worry about creativity;  it will just happen.
 
By reinforcing and honoring our pasts,  we are looking to
 
the future.
 Why is this so hard to explain? We see it every
 
day.
 You have only to drive past build fngs that ennoble our
 
national capital to see how visible are the symbols of the
 
cultural pasts of the majority European culture.
 There are
 
Doric and Ionian and Corinthean columns gracing our national
 
buildings the length of Constitution Avenue.
 But where is
 
the Plains Indian to go to see the exciting structural and
 
artistic excellencies produced by the four-pole as opposed
 
to the seven-pole teepee?
 I had an elderly Sioux gentleman
 
in my office last week weeping as he tried to describe to
 
me how beautiful a teepee city can be.
 
We are not immersed in china-painting,  paper doilies,  and
 
faded lithographs.
 Folk Arts is central' to the Endowment,
 
to its commitment to excellence in all the arts.
 As Dave
 
Searles remarked at the budget meeting, we are the elitest of
 
the elite and we go about our business using the same strategies
 
that other Endowment programs use.
 If there were no recordings
 
of the Fifth Symphony,  don't you think the Music Program would
 
be starting a documentation program?
 Our symphonies have not
 
been recorded or even widely heard, but when they are,  you
 
will find that the Folk Arts Program is on the cutting edge
 
of the future of the
, artistic life of this nation.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS -
 Ithaca,  NY June 1990  (AS GIVEN)
 
"Why Folk Art?"
 Well,l I've been asked to deliver a keynote
 
address on this topic so I shall give it a try.
 Keynoting is a
 
fairly frequent experience for me these days;  apparently I have
 
attained an age at which I am presumed to have acquired modest
 
quantities of good sense and good taste suitable for getting a
 
conversation started.
 But as you know,  it's getting harder and
 
harder to be both sensible anc  tactful...
 Still  I shall do
 
my best.
 
And so here goes.
 I shall once more haul out my silver
 
trumpet and blow the charge.
 My charge--my text--my
 
message--which is not only a message of reality but of a kind of
 
triumph actually--is that our communities,  our states,  our
 
nation,  our continent,  our hemisphere,  our world,  have--in spite
 
of the massive forces of homogenization--nurtured over the
 
centuries countless kinds of smaller social groups,  each of
 
which has expressed its inborn dynamic potential through one or
 
another artistic activity--through song or story,  pattern or
 
design,  dance or ceremony.
 We simply don't have to worry about
 
these groups'  expressing themselves in artistic forms;  they
 
- 5 -
Over the past fourteen years the Folk Arts Program at the
 
National Endowment for the Arts has  labored at a single
 
objective:  to develop ways through whidh the folk artists of our
 
nation can step forward and shine both at home and abroad.
 Our
 
primary focus has been first on the culture carriers,  second on
 
the cultural innovators,  last of all on the outsiders.
 We
 
developed these priorities because of our primary concern with
 
nourishing the field itself,  and it has produced unexpedtedly
 
high dividends.
 There are these days a truly startling number
 
of world-class performing folk artists in our nation,
 
indigenous,  immigrant and transient,  .
 (Visual artists,
 
normally lagging behind,  are nowadays coming up fast.)
 The fact
 
that Carnegie Hall during its centennial celebration is devoting
 
several weeks to a folk arts concert series is only one evidence
 
of the present availability of,  as well as,  interest in a
 
serious approach to the presenting of folk arts.
 
So I return to my title--Why Folk Arts?
 Why do otherwise
 
sensible people consider devoting time and money to presenting
 
this complex field?
 Quite simply because the very best of the
 
art forms traditional to the many groups that make up this
 
country do indeed comprise the emotional core of our nation.
 We
 
are a multi-cultural nation.
 We must begin to behave as though
 
we actually realize (instead of simply mouth) that fact.
 And as
 
presenters, we must begin to look beyond what we may have
 
assumed as normative quantities and methods of presenting our
 
-
glorious variability.

artists when they do not think they are anything of the kind.
 
Part of this is bacause almost everybody thinks of folk art
 
as rural,  or possibly blue-collar,  art--dancing,  as my friend
 
Barre Toelken says, with the elbows out.
 And,  because many
 
Anglo-Americans feel deep conflict between what they envision as
 
their "back-country" ways and the styles they believe they must
 
assume to get ahead in the more "sophisticated" world,  there has
 
been until recently little impetus to present North Carolina
 
fiddling or South Carolina seagrass basketry as important art
 
forms.
 (They might well have been so honored in other more
  
self-confident cultures.) 
It's hard to remember back that far
 
nowadays,  but the initial presentation of Appalachian country
 
crafts and music under federal sponsorship on the National Mall
 
by the venerable Smithsonian Institution in 1966  (only 24 years
 
ago) was a really radical move for its time.
 
And how did the Smithsonian bring it off?
 Why,  they set up
 
rough-hewn temporary platform stages sheltered by circus style
 
tenting fabric overhangs.
 They created a great good-humored
 
all-American county fair atmosphere on the Mall where Mr.  and
 
Mrs. America could come and bring the children and show them how
 
- 8 -
things used to look back home in Indiana,  or Alaska, or Nigeria
 
or wherever.
 This wasn't a small trick at the time; perhaps you
 
have forgotten or never knew the sixties and seventies, but
 
bringing thousands of people together in peaceable celebration
 
was a difficult thing to carry off.
 
When I first arrived in Washington in the summer of 1975 to
 
help present the California Heartland at the Festival of
 
American Folklife that year,  I was escorted around the grounds
 
by the Festival Director, Ralph Rinzler.
 I already knew the
 
ground-breaking principles governing the Festival -
 only
 
authentic traditional artists presented both sympathetically and
 
accurately by scholars acquainted both with the community and
 
the art form.
 Now he was giving me the domestic details.
 He
 
said,  there are some things I tell everybody about how to run a
 
good outdoor festival:  first no matter where you are on the
 
grounds,  there has to be palatable food and drink easily 
available; then, no matter where you are on the grounds, you
 
ought to be able to look around you and see at least three
 
interesting things going on--if you can, perhaps you will decide
 
to stroll over to the less crowded one.
 Then, never include big
 
names because half of your crowd will come planning to hear only
 
9
 
the big name and they will reject and ignore the other worthy
 
artists;  and finally,  take your sound budget and triple it.
 
I go into this much detail only because I think Ralph's
 
extremely sound advice was slanted towards answering a number of
 
problems specific to the time, the period, the event,  and the
 
participating cultures.
 He was trying first of all to ensure
 
social peace at his big party and he had selected a
 
middle-American model--the county fair--in which most spectators
 
would feel comfortable,  and enhanced it to accommodate large
 
numbers of uncomprehending visitors (who never thought that that
 
was what they would be looking at when they came to Washington),
 
as well as large numbers of homesick and nostalgic Washington
 
government employees.
 His prescriptions were intelligent
 
attempts to create and magnify social communication during a
 
period when the fabric of that communication was in pieces.
 
He sized up his problem well and he handled it beautifully
 
and he presented us with an inspiring example -
 down to the
 
smallest well-thought out detail.
 But although I recommend we
 
follow the Smithsonian example, we need not use only the
 
Smithsonian model, as democratic a venue as it may be.
 For if
 
A 
-
 10 -
 
my definitions for folk art are acceptable, we are dealing with
 
the literal hearts blood of the many different peoples who make
 
up the citizenry of the United States.
 Should we not
 
investigate and consider the now classic outdoor festival as
 
only one of the contexts suitable for presenting the work of
 
trans-American artists?
 Should every presenter not consider
 
prayerfully and in great detail the time,  the period, the nature
 
of the event,  the participating cultures and make decisions
 
accordingly?
 I say this simply because it appears to me that
 
many presentations of folk performances even in major auditoria
 
somehow seem to smell of the tent.
 They lack the kind of
 
creative imagination we might call upon,  if we will labor hard
 
to establish more wide ranging presentational frames.
 
Should we,  for example,  invariably sacrifice everything
 
visual for the accommodation of everything auditory?
 Perhaps we
 
should triple our lighting budget.
 And almost all non-Anglo
 
performing art forms demand some movement on the part of the
 
musician; tying him or her down to a single upstanding
 
microphone has serious artistic implications.
 The individual
 
miking of all the accompanying musicians transfers the total
 
musical effect into the hands of the sound-man at the board
 
rather than to the performing group.
 In large halls this
 
transfer of control may be essential; we must however carefully
 
consider its implications.
 
Well.
 This is my own particular hobby horse and I will not
 
trot off on it interminably.
 I realize perfectly well that
 
getting adequate sound reinforcement for New England ballad
 
singers and Cajun dance bands and Ojibwe drums all in a single
 
concert is hard--but, what the
 
wouldn't be so much fun, would
 
as I see it.
 We tend to apply
 
outdoor tent fair to all kinds
 
of whom might appear much more
 
heck,  if
 
it?  Let
 
a single
 
it wasn't hard,  it
 
me restate the problem
 
successful model -
 the
 
of traditional performers,
 
impressively in different
 
some
 
surroundings and in different presentational rhythms and
 
scenarios.
 How about letting the visual element dominate or at
 
least compete with the auditory?
 How about setting things up
 
so the musicians can move from place to place?  How about at
 
least keeping the musicians and dancers on the same level,  as
 
Joe Wilson puts it?
 How about examining the street or the
 
social hail or the castle or the market as venues for
 
performance as comfortable as the tent?  And how about keepinq 
the tent,  the lovely traditional outdoor festival,  alive and
 
-
 12 -
 
well too?
 We can have it all.
 How about more frequently
 
forming common cause with other art forms -
 theater,  film,
 
photography,  some of the new artistic inventions I don't even
 
know the names of -
 to help us with our shared goal -
 to present
 
back to the people their own glowing artistic creations.

Dear Lynn Contaste,
 
I
'm afraid you've missed r
ay point.  It i
s not that I am annoyed to be solicited
 
four and five times within a single days mailing four or five times a month.
 
What I am objecting to i
s that I am paying for such solicitations and for the
 
trash men that haul it all away.  I mean, somebody has to, and I do believe it i
s
 
me, when it comes down to the final billing.

I understand that much of what you send out is bread cast out up nf
 the waters.
 
But when over half of my every days mail consists of' *educational-'nkhiJlUS addressed
 
to me (
in several different computer misspellings) I get a kind of desperate
 
feeling.  I
s all the money I contribute to these great causes being used to
 
solicit me to give even more money to solicit me to give even more money to...
 
Somebody has to break this chain somewhere.  I am sorry that you are having
 
trouble with your computer lists.  Have you considered stopping using them?
 
I mean, we are going to have to do something, as a society, to stop this'
 
arrant and arrogant waste of our natural resources.  Pleá e do not send me
 
any further news'etters or magazines.  Please do use the donation I sent
 
you (
$100.00 -

 more than I could afford) for the defense of x civil rights
 
and the First Amendment.  I am kind of ashamed that you sent me back a defense
 
of your inability to control the computer.  I thought the ACLU was bigger and
 
classier than that.

Dear Sirs:
 
I am sorry to be attending to the enclosed statement so late,
 
but I have been away from home for an extended period, and some
 
of my mail has been greatly delayed.
 
I do not believe the enclosed check and statement belongs to me.
 
My late husband's name was Baldwin Hawes
I, to the best, of my
 
knowledge, he wrote no such song as "Hejo gin und rum".  Confusingly,
 
he did write a song titled "Champagne Wine" which I believe you
 
published but no gin and rum.
 
I hope you can get this straightened out before my income tax
 
records get all confused, not to mention yours.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Sirs:

V
 
This is the second year I have written you on this matter.
 My deceased
 
husband, Baldwin Hawes (
formerly of 2522 24th Street, Santa Monica, California
 
90405) did not write a song titled "Hejo Gin Und Rum".
 I am returning,
 
(
as I did i E year) the royalty check you mistakenly send him.  Somebody
  
presumably wrote this rather notably unsuccessful song.  Please try to find
 
out who it was and send the enclosed to its proper owner.
 
A song my husband iAd did write (
and on which I have received no yoraylty
 
statement, though I doubt that much is owing) was titled "Champagne Wine".
 
I do wish you could get this somewhat macabre business straightened out.
 
In future I shall correspond no further with you on this topic.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Sirs:
 
For three years you have sent me royalty checks (
averaging around 23)
 
for a song titled "Hejo Gin Und Rum" which you appear to believe my
 
husband, Baldwin Hawes (
five years deceased) wrote.
 
Every year, I
 have returned the check and informed you that my husband,
 
to my knowledge, wrote no song by that title.  Every year my letter has
 
been returned to me.  Apparently, B
lackwood Music, who makes out the check,
 
has no legal existence, at least in the eyes of the post office.
 
I am attempting for the last time to get this straightened out.  I am
 
hereby returning the current year's check, along with last year's check,
 
along with the income tax copy of the year before.  Baldwin Hawes did not
 
write "Hejo Gin und Rum".  I know absolutely nothing about this.  I will
 
not ever under any circumstances cash your checks acknowledging authorship
 
or responsibility for what must have been a singularly unappealing song.
 
For heaven's sakes, get this thing out of your computer and leave as alone.

I am enclosing herewith a reasonably up-to-date Vita which covers most of
 
the points on which infornaticn is requested.  The areas not covered in the
 
Vita concern PW non-professi o
nal activities and interests, as well as my
 
general attitude towards education and the teaching profession.  An informal
 
paragraph on each of t
heee s
ubjects follows.
 
I
.
br non-professionsl activities have -
 both by choice and by necessity -  
revolved around thebringing u

California at Berkeley with a B.A. in Physical Anthropology and a five year
 
NSF f
ellowship to pursue her doctorate in that field.  O
ur third has just
 
c
ompleted his sophomore year at S
an Francisco State C
ollege, where he i
s

ime
 
teaching load plus additional extension classes, rwud.ng a household,, and
 
mothering three has l
eft me little time for hobbies or extra-c rric &ar
 
activities except those that go with the job: P

drives and s

and I
4xico; I had s
ix months in Europe before nr n
irriage.
 
My own v
iew on teaching is that it is the most exciting, frustrating, s
timulating,
 
exhausting, demanding, impossible -
 in sum, themost joytully dangerous job
 
in the world.  Two factors —  the knowledge explosion and the undergraduate
 
rebellion(
 under which I include the long overdue d
emands of minority s
tudents)
 
leave today's teacher balanced on an uneasy and s
lippery footing, his knowledge
 
challenged, his values and his s
trategies undergoing perpetual re-assessment.
 
Carl Sandburg's uncomfortable question:  "what do you know today, for s
ure?"
 
poses the problem w
ith poctio ocon
r.  I never face a class without wondering
 
this; actually, I have evolved my own even harsher version:  "
ihat do you
 
know today, for sure, that matters?"  A profession which forces s
uch questions
 
u
pon you -
 not just once a week or one, a year, but as often as you c
an f
ind
 
strength to face them -
 must s
ure l
y be olosest to the heart of the human
 
condition.  I c
