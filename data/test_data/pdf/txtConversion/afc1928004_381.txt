O'REILLY'S RAFFLE. 
(Original Song.) 
Words by JOHN TEASLEY. 
Sung with great success by the 
PEASLEYS. 
I'll tell you of a 
jolly time 
We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, some were singing, 
Others making lots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar, 
We took a 
drink with Paddy ()Ala; 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
He got up and gave a 
toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty, 
Michael Dolan, Teddy Regan, 
Danced the dust out-of the floor. 
Here's to all the pretty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys, 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dances, 
From the break-down to the lancers, 
Cracking jokes and telling stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Some were sleeping, some were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Then the ruction soon began, 
'Twas woman to woman, and man to man, 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye, 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking off their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a-squealing, 
The big blaguards they had no feeling, 
At it right and left they went, 
And busted O'Reilly's raffle. 
THE SENATORS, 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and music Iv JOHN PEASLEY. 
Sung with great 
success by PEASLEY & HUGHES. 
We are two senators, you see, 
And know just what we're doing, 
Pray tell me where that sound came from ? 
Some trouble must be brewing; (
biz chord) 
Now for this time you must excuse, 
But don't make a 
repetition, 
Or else to pardon we refuse, 
And sacrifice position. 
CHORUS. 
(Waltz time) For yes, we are two senators, 
Swells of the fashion, you see, 
You'll seldom find two nigs like us, 
Stylish colored senators are we. 
A 
collegiate education we've had, 
Since our emancipation, (
biz chord) 
Although we have our fun at times, 
We dont forget our station. (
biz chord) 
Now every thing is settled right, 
And to each one's satisfaction, 
And as it's settled we will not fight, 
'Twould surely cause distraction. 
For yes, we are, etc,

THE O'GRADYS. 
ORIGINAL SONG. 
Words by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by the PEASLEYS, JOHN 
and LEA. 
Good evening to you, gents and ladies, 
We've come here to make a 
call, 
Descendants of the great O'Grady's, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A year ago we took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep. 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
We could not get a 
wink of sleep. 
CHORUS. 
They call us now the great O'Gradys, 
We'll fight till we're pushed to the wall, 
The young folks they were all a 
crying, 
The day we left ould Donegal. 
We were known throughout the country; 
The devil the one with us could dance, 
We were the first in every motion, and drink 
Whenever we had the chance. 
We used to drive the girls all crazy, 
So nimbly we could shake our feet; 
They never found us slow or lazy, 
At dancing we could not be beat. 
They call us, etc.

SPEAK, ONLY SPEAK. 
Sung with great success by the PEASLEYS. 
Why are you silent and sad, love, 
Filling my poor heart with pain'11 
Lives like your own should be glad, love, 
Smile on me sweetly again ; 
Surely I 
never can leave thee, 
Here with those tears on thy cheeks, 
What have I 
done thus to grieve thee ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me then, only speak, love, 
why are those tears on thy cheeks, 
Give me the answer I 
seek, love, 
Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Lives like your own cannot live, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain, 
Whisper you gladly forgive, love, 
Kiss and be happy again; 
Cease then your weary repining, 
Banish the tear from thy cheek, 
With my arms round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
Speak to me, then, etc.

Words by 
G. 
S. 
KNIGHT. Music by FRANK CARDELLA. 
Watch our style and dashing figure, 
We always travel with gentlemen, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten; 
We always did detest that vulgar name of nigger, 
We've been called by that name, and though it did of-
fend, 
We never did take notice or the insult e'er resent, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my gracious ! can't we sling our yams (
break) 
Glory hallelujah to all the blessed lambs, 
(
break) 
Watch our feet and watch them close, they've educated 
been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
We always dress up to the fashion, 
At each resort we both have been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten ; 
We're up to every game, and that you bet your cash On, 
At every race of note you'll find we do attend, 
We never borrow money nor neither do we lend, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
Oh, my gracious, etc.

ORIGINAL BIG SHOE SONG AND DANCE. 
-Written for and sung by PEARLEY & H UGHES. 
Words by 
GEORGE S. 
KNIGHT. 
3111°.ie by FRANK CARDELLA. 
Some people talk of being fat, 
And others that they're thin, 
Some show their muscle and all that, 
But with we they can't begin ; 
To blow about every thing they have, 
Is what we've never done, 
But where's a 
fig can sling a 
shoe 
Like this delicate number one. 
CHORUS. 
They're only number one, 
Don't think them any more, 
All colored men must vacate, 
When we come in de door: 
When we say one you must not think 
That we mean one in size, 
But one whole ox right by himself, 
We never tell no lies; 
We're never careless with these pets, 
We wear them all the year, 
For when there's one gets busted up, 
There dies another steer. 
Thoy'ro Only, etc.

Behold two warlike heroes, 
Dressed up fit to kill,

And when we put our feet down, 
Oh! don't we make them stare!

The girls they laugh and wink; 
When the militia boys parade, 
The militia boys parade,

And then they grin and blink. 
We don't care to go fighting, 
We'd sooner drink or eat, 
In drilling we are lively, 
Our bass drums can't be bErat; 
Our fathers they are wealthy, 
We're soldiers just for fun, 
And when it comes to fightiug, 
Were lively with a 
run.

PARAGON OF STYLE, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written for and sung by LEA PEASLEY. Words and 
music by FRANK CARDELLA. 
'Twas on one Sunday eve, 
I 
thought I 
would relieve 
My busy mind by strolling through the park; 
When I 
met as if by chance, 
And caught a 
roguish glance, 
Of a 
charmer who seemed bent upon a 
lark. 
She was resting ' neath a 
tree, 
When first she looked at me, 
And of course my bounden duty was to smile; 
And quick it was returned. 
Oh how my cheeks they burned, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas '
neath an oak tree grand, 
While list'ning to the band, 
Perhaps a 
pleasant hour to beguile ; 
When we met as if by chance, 
And she threw a 
roguish glance, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
Kind friends, you've heard my song, 
And with it each detail 
Of our friendship, which was very short and sweet; 
And now I 
guess I'll go, 
But before I 
do I'll show 
A 
step I 
think it's very hard to beat. 
But on our wedding day, 
Which is not far away, 
We hope you'll come and stay a 
little while; 
And then you all can see 
How happy we can be, 
Together as the paragon of style. 
'Twas ' neath an oak tree, etc. 
GILFILLEN'S GOAT. 
Sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN with great success. 
Air—" Mulcahey's Gone Away." 
Come listen to me one an' all, 
To what I'm goin' to say, 
It's all about a 
neighbor o' mine, 
Who lives across the way ; 
He's the owner of a 
big coal cart, 
An' lie likewise drives the same, 
An' he got a 
great big billy goat, 
Who's very much to blame. 
CuoRrs. 
For whin he'd jump, he'd hit you a 
thump, 
Unless you'd quickly slope; 
Oh, the terror of the neighborhood— 
Is Gilfillen's big buck goat 
I'll tell you of the damages, 
That he's done all around, 
He wit into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I 
tell you there was a 
row, 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
Now it was here this afthernoon, 
He came into my yard, 
While I 
was plantin' 
And he still- lick me rur:hty hard! 
rfa knocked me down, jumped on Me, 
An' he ate the tail o' me coat, 
Illue'd glass have no effect at all 
Oii Gdfillen's big buck goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
Last Sunday week he ate my shirt, 
He also a,te my hat, 
An' he also knocked the shtuffin' 
Out of Mrs. "Maloney's cat; 
I'm goin' to get a 
warrant now, 
(For my back is nearly broke,) 
To have Gilfillen arrested, 
And his son of a 
gun of a 
goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc.

An angel without wings. 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so slow 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's cai 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly saki, 
I 
wish you au-revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever you may Liao 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
Nile's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
Oh, my heart, &c.

While rowing on the lake one night, 
I 
heard the splash of oars, 
And seeing a 
lady gliding by, 
I 
rowed my boat to hers; 
The spray's sweet sound, as we went on 
Bewitching coal-black eyes, 
Enchanting scenes I'll ne'er forget, 
Beneath the starry sky. 
CHORUS. 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent. 
Until the boats closed tight, 
Leaning over on one side. 
Kissing in the moonlight. 
(Repeat.) 
" 
Oh, sir," said she, " you're impolite, 
An advantage to take like this 
In following me out on the lake, 
You've surely went amiss ;" 
And then a 
smile so very sweet, 
Stole o'er her pretty face, 
Then leaning to her oars again, 
Said for another race. 
Dip, dip, k

The moon's bright rays shone on the lake, 
It was eternal bliss, 
I 
believed the words that I 
had heard— 
There is magic in a 
kiss. 
Like flying birds our boats sped on, 
I 
rowed with all my might, 
To gain the shore in time to help 
My darling to alight.

TWO ORPHANS. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
Air.—" Over the Hills to the Poor-House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark! do you hear that cry? 
Fire! 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the " Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take: 
The doors they were open Pa seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight; 
Them that had got seats they wk re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly, 
Till sparks from the scenes they did fly; 
It's then that men, women and children, 
" 
Oh, God, save our lives !" they did cry, 
We ne'er can. etc. 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, God! what a 
sight met our eyes 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Some there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God! let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er ;an, etc. 
What means this large gathering of people, 
Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
• 
Where the wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can. etc.

never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a

" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
YQt they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, et. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint,

little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek I 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;", 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

Theatres in the United States. 
Everywhere received with 
roars of laughter and applause. 
We are two Irish boys so frisky, 
None better sure you can't find, 
To twirl the twig, or drink strong whiskey, 
Or bate a 
big foe, do you mind; 
If the four- leafed shamrock we could get now, 
All bare footed cripples would be shod ; 
No poor needle woman would sit down: 
But be gay, like the boys that carry the hod. 
CHORUS: 
Drink success to Irish labor, 
Just new over from the sod; 
All we want is laborers' wages, 
For we're the boys that carry the hod. 
We'd have no shifting politicians, 
But every man would honest be; 
Old starvation, he'd have no relation, 
And all ould Ireland would be free; 
We'd have Saturday night three times a 
week, 
Fine roast beef, and less salt cod; 
Then every one would happy be, 
Just like the boys that carry the hod.

BEHETD THE SCENES, 
As sung by W ILL. MORTON. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. • 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
Ilis heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead , 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends ; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very ditlerent state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
But be that as it may, who cans. ; all the fray, 
Their quarreling cont!nues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide froni all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the sant° in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make thealselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatever we enjoy, there's something to annoy, 
If we could only peep behind the scenes.

Music by ROY LESLIE. 
0, this is the age of invention, 
Strange wonders turn up ey'ry day, 
All the sciences seem iii convention. 
Where they'll stop at, no mortal can say; 
But the latest and greatest of mysteries, 
Which all other wonders surpass, 
To go down in posterities' hist'rics, 
Are these wonderful panes of blue glass. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
science none others compare to, 
The philosopher's stone found at last, 
For twill cure all the ills flesh is heir to, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
If a 
pane of blue glass you put over 
The head of your mother-in-law, 
She'll be tame as a 
lamb 17 spring clover, 
And she can't even wag her own jaw; 
Your own wife won't dare ask where you've been to, 
If a 
night at your club you should pass, 
If you have in your own bed- room windows, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
Twould do well in the windows of churches, 
It might keep the preachers from sin. 
And in street cars %would make the conductors, 
Account for each fare they takc in; 
And it you had a 
brick in your hat, sir, 
For a 
sober man wanted to pass, 
'Twould be easy for you to do that, sir, 
In your hat put a 
pane of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, eta. 
A 
blue goblet full of good whiskey, 
Would be most tee tempting to pass, 
And HO temperance mu will get frisky, 
If he drinks his rum from 
blue glass; 
All the boarding-house keepers will have them, 
And the boarders will get fat quite fast, 
They can't tell the shirt buttons from grizzle, 
When the hash is served up in blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, et& 
If we send up a 
dozen of glaziers, 
To the Capitol with this blue glass, 
Congressmen would be honest as blazes, 
And the days of their stealing be past; 
If we had blue glass ballot boxes, 
We'd have fair elections at last, 
And a 
President upright and honest, 
If the White House was glazed with blue glass. 
'Tis a

I 
saw a 
pretty face, 
A

And actions full of grace; 
In silks and velvets by the yard, 
In the fashion of the day, 
Made up this charming little belle, 
Who stole my heart away.

She was clerk in a

She was clerk in a

She was sweeter by far than the sweetest of sweets, 
Was this clerk of a 
candy store. 
And now we were the best of friends ; 
We chatted, laughed and talked ; 
Ifertheme was candy, mine was love, 
As down the street we walked; 
The best of friends must often part, 
I 
left my heart's delight, 
But promised we should meet again 
'Neath the dusky shade of night. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, at nine o'clock this evening, • was to escort 
home— 
This clerk, etc. 
The twinkling stars shining bright, 
They seemed so full of life, 
Winked and nodded as I 
asked, 
It she would be my wife; 
And as she g'ently murmured "yes," 
One year from this sweet "night, 
They danced and sparkled as if to say 
We'll keep your pathway bright, 
She was clerk, etc. 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIS. 
Listen to the water-mill, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, lose no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with the \ iner that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lust without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh I 
hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed.

THE WATER 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILIAAms. 
Listen to the water- mill, all the livelong day, 
-How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts ray mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, lose no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with the il..ter that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lort without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh 
hold it fast, 
The mill will never g,-rind again with the water that has passed.

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANK LEWIS. 
How the world has wrote the praises of our politica ns of fame, Sir--
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those who get no thanks Sir; 
The tide of victory on been turned by the solid poor man's t 
auk Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think it would he about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man, and feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for wine, big suppers and fins, 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our honest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for-
lorn, Sir,

GOOD BYE, MAGGIE DARLING, 
swig with well-merited success by II.kaav Osaox 
FANNY -W ENTWORTH. 
Maggie darling, now, good bye, 
To America I 
go; 
It will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
And still I 
cannot live here so. 
I 
will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
Yet I 
must from old Ireland go. 
The old folks they are growing grey Maggie, 
The farm it wont support us all, 
I 
cannot stay and see them suffer, 
So I 
must go where duty calls. 
CFIORRS, 
Maggie, dear Maggie dear, 
! 
should I 
never see thee more, 
My fondest hope is that you love me, 
When you've Lft old Ireland shore. 
Barney what will come of me 
When you are gone far, o'er tile Main ? 
The birds will only sing in sad ess, 
The sun wili ne'er shine bright wain: 
The birds will only sing in sadness, 
Till Barney comes back home again. 
Maggie, Barney feels ' tis hard to part, 
To leave his home and country too, 
But times are getting hard here, Maggie, 
And I 
must now find work to do.

MoRTuN, with HARRIGAN 1.7. HxRT'S 
COnthination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time. 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject I'll mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give hint any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A nan may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He struggles hi b 
hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To such worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So rive what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how scon things may turn 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return.

We buy up what e're we can find, 
We work hard at on- or•eupation, 
In picking up junk & all kind. 
From the lear ould green land of shamrock 
A few years ago we came out. 
As partners we started this business. 
And from morning ' till night we do shout --

Any old rags, ( Symph.) 
Any idol bottles, (Symph.) 
Any old rags to put in our bags. 
Have ye any- old rags or bottles to- day.

Bladder refinery, 
And the boss he would put its to work. 
Faith we soon found out all their queer tricks, 
There jokes, their stalls and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Any old rags, ,kc. 
Now before we kave we ntuA led yo u

My golden-hair'd darlings, disturb not their rest, 
Sweet Angels have lull'd them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep, 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Grows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let them rest; 
While Angels are watching them, slumber is best. 
CHORUS. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best. 
Hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
I 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where I'll not see my darlings want something to eat I 
Tread softly, etc. 
Pat a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCAN LAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
:Rot now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you T 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to iis be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone hero to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc.

AWFULLY AWFUL,

Sting by LYDIA TdOMPSON. 
They tell me I am too bashful by far, 
And, sometimes, I 
think they are right, 
But so aw2t u.. 
n 
y 
naughty the inase nii nes 
are; 
NO 
wonder one feels in a 
fright; 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they, their compliments pay, 
In language absurd. I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But, first, as a 
caution I 
say. 
Ciforics. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away ! 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say. 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are! 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance. 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has tide ehatice, 
Is sure to have son-waling to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man, as soon as I 
call, 
In ease he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me, he has told two or three, 
For such sad lion Giovanni's they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas tape, whene'er it conies round, 
Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again mid again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh! and would von believe. on last Christmas eve, 
found a 
yonric• man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion, and carriage, 
Of course, I 
soon heat a
