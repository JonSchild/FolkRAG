BILLY EMERSON'S 
SHE WAS SUCH A 
CHARMER. 
BILLY EMERSON'S great Song and Dance. 
I 
AM going to sing a 
song and hope 'twill please you all, 
About a 
pretty girl I 
met, '
twos at a 
fancy ball. 
She was handsome as a 
rose, her eyes were black as 
coal, 
And when I 
gazed upon her, oh my heart away she 
stole. 
chorus. 
For the was such a 
charmer, 
I 
had her for a 
partner, 
She was handsome as a 
rose, 
Her eyes were black as coal, 
And when I 
gazed upon her, oh, 
My heart away she stole. 
10 
DAMS AND rtoGisH   
Her charms I 
will describe, as I 
saw them at the ball, 
A boxing glove put in her net, she wore as a 
water-
fall. 
She had a 
double jointed thumb, a 
foot like a 
giraffe, 
And when she went to dance the waltz, she made the 
darkeys laugh. 
For she was, etc. 
When the ball was out, I 
saw her to the door, 
I 
felt so really happy as I 
never felt before. 
I 
asked her to be mine, she answered with a 
smile, 
She pierced my heart right through and through, like 
boring down for oil. 
For she was, etc. 
DARK AND ROGUISH EYE. 
As sung by DILLY EMEPSON. 
W E 
all do like the pretty gals, we see them every day, 
And how at first sight fall in love, whene'er they pass 
that way. 
But a 
charming gal the other morn, I 
saw come walking 
by, 
And as she looked, I 
saw she had a 
dark and roguish 
eye. 
Chorus. 
But I 
never can forget her, 
The first time that I 
met her; 
And as she looked, my fate was booked, 
I 
sealed it with a 
sigh, 
I 
found that I 
had fell in love 
With a 
dark and roguish eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, looped up so gay and 
neat, 
And as she went across the way, I 
saw her pretty feet. 
NVE HAVE PARTED. - 
11 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 'twas marked 
L-U-C-Y, 
I 
picked it up, she marked me with her dark and roguish 
eye. 
But I 
never, etc. 
Of course this little charm I 
took, we walked and talked 
a 
while, 
She said her father he was rich, he lately had struck 
oil. 
But as I 
exclaimed, " Will you be mine?" her fellow, he 
came by, 
" 
Walk off!" said he " or I'll give you a 
Ca :k 
and roguish 
eye." 
But I 
never, etc. 
As sung by Gnonon BnooKs, of Newcomb's Minstrels. 
1VE have parted, and forever, o'er my life a 
shadow's 
cast, 
For the light of love, ah, never can restore the happy 
past. 
We have parted, I 
have loved thee, but for me all hope 
is o'er, 
All is over, we have parted, I 
must dream of thee no 
more; 
All is over, we have parted, I 
must dream of thee no 
more. 
We have parted, but thy image is engraven on my 
heart, 
Canst thou think what happy moments we have passed_ 
and yet we part!

THE BIGGEST LIAR OUT. 
But thou lovest me, and forever must thy memory be 
with me, 
We have parted, all is over, but I 
still must think of.

We have parted, all is over, but I 
still must think of 
thee. 
ISE BIGGEST T.TAR OUT. 
As sung by BILLY EMERS011. 
Am—" Dandy Jim." 
THE lies I 
tell's all the go, that's right, 
I 
swear night's day, I 
say day's night, 
The truth of my lies I 
shall bring to light, 
I 
will show white's black, and black's white. 
Chorus. 
I'm the boy for the long-bow, 
I'm the biggest liar out, 
None can like me the hatchet throw. 
I'm the biggest liar out, 
There is no doubt, 
Now the truth of my lies I'm going to show. 
Spoken. — Now you may think this is a 
lie; but it's the 
truest lie that was ever told. 
You have heard of Jonas; 
well, he swallowed a 
whale. 
There was no doubt but he 
was very fond of fish, but I 
knew a 
feller who swallowed 
Jonas, whale and all. 
It's as true as you are there. 
Then there was John Thompson, who slew 50,000 Phil-
limingoes with the jaw-bone of a 
donkey's leg. 
That's 
true. 
Then there was Ring Richard the Third of En-
gland; he was a 
very handsome man, because his legs 
were hump-backed, and so was his belly. 
I'm the lxiy, etc. 
(BELIEVE TIS 'BEST TO GIVE.

I 
can do the dodge doctor's shops, . 
I 
can pull out teeth and serve out slops, 
I 
make their physic very strong, 
And I 
make their bills out precious long. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
Spoken. — Well, perhaps you don't believe this ;—I 
cured a man of the mathematics, I 
cured another of 
the Bombago, and I 
cured him with the new Ulcerated 
Bread. 
Well, I 
cured another of the Yellow Flanders. 
Then I 
cured another of the toothache in his great toe. 
Then I 
cured another of a 
galloping comsumption. 
Well, I 
cured him until he died. 
Well, I 
went a 
fishing 
one day, and I 
baited with a 
piece of a 
soldier's coat, 
and I 
caught some of the finest red herrings out.

BELIEVE ' TIS BEST TO GIVE. 
As sung by STEVE Aloonz. 
Ant—" You'll Remember Me." 
How wrong it is to crush the poor, 
Or pass them by with scorn, 
Since all on earth are naught but dust, 
Not buried—merely born! 
Then caution use, nor too proud be 
To heal another's grief, 
To-morrow's moon may change the tide, 
And you may need relief. 
'Tis surely proved by law divine, 
That we should help each other, 
Foster regard and tender love, 
E'en as we would another. 
14 
SECS WAS VERY FOND OF DANCING. 
Then why refuse to share your wealth, 
With those who crave for bread? 
Unstring your purse, relieve in time 
To save them from the dead. 
Oh, speak not hastily to the poor, 
Let mercy plead their case, • • 
Nor turn the wand'rer from your door 
With hunger in his face. 
Life is but short, stern death is sure, 
In luxuries though you live; 
If 'tis but little from your store, 
Believe 'tis best to give. 
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF DANCING; 
Or, the Calico Printer's Clerk. 
As sung by BILLY EarEnsort. 
Dowic in Lowell, that City 
Of cotton twist and twills, 
Lived the subject of my ditty, 
And the cause of all my ills; 
She was handsome, young and twenty, 
Her eyes were azure blue, 
Admirers she had plenty, 
And her name was Dorothy Drew. 
Chorus.. 
She was very fond of dancing, 
But allow me to remark, 
That one fine day she danced away, 
With a 
calico printer's clerk. 
At a 
private ball I 
met her, 
In eighteen sixty-three, 
, SE E WAS VERY FOND OF DANCEIG. 
I 
never can forget her, 
Though she was unkind to me. 
I 
was dressed in pink of fashion, 
My lavender gloves were new, 
I 
danced the waltz Circassian, 
With charming Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, etc. 
We schottished and we Polka'd, 
To the strains the band did play, 
We waltzed and we mazurka'd, 
Till she waltzed her heart away. 
I 
whispered in this manner, 
As round the room we flew, 
Doing Varsoviana, 
• " I 
love you Dorothy Drew." 
She was very, etc. 
For months and months attention 
.Unto her I 
did pay, 
Till with her condescension, 
She led me quite astray. 
The money I 
expended, 
I'm ashamed to tell to you, 
I'll inform you how it ended 
With myself and Dorothy Drew. 
- 
She was very, etc. 
I 
received an intimation, 
She a 
visit meant to pay 
Unto a 
near relation, 
Who lived some miles away. 
In a 
month she'd be returning, 
I 
must take a 
short adieu, 
But her love for me was burning, 
Deceitful Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, etc.

Ant—" New Sensation." 
I 
Am a 
jolly Irishman, from Ireland I 
came, 
If you want to know me more, Pat Murphy is my name. 
The raison I 
am here to-night, is to tell you av a 
spree, 
That happened to a 
chap called Dan, and another chap, 
—that's me. 
Dan and his girl were married, oh, 
Through love, you know and so and so, 
And all the boys from there below, • 
Assimbled at the spree. 
There was Mike and Dan, 
And Mary Ann, and Pat McCann; 
There was Toole, the fool, 
And Pat Drumgoole and me. 
Chorus. 
We had a 
row that very night, 
We put the women in a 
fright; 
There was murdher right and tight, 
And all the boys began to fight. 
Hurroo! boys, here we are agin! 
Here we are agin, here we are agin! 
Hurroo !- boys, here we are agin, 
Bowld Irishmin are we!

. 
head.

Ould Teddy Whack, wid the broken back, kern Empire

And they were not melancholy, oh! 
But jolly, oh ! so jolly, oh ! 
With Biddy, Jane, and Molly, oh! 
All dancin' at the spree! 
There was wine and punch, 
And Irish spuds in their duds; 
There was knives and forks, 
And gingerbeer and fay. 
But they had a

THE WAY TO MAKE LOVE LIKE AN IRISHMAN. 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
Ant—" Ned has no call to Me." 
W HEN you go a 
courting a 
neat and. dainty lass, 
Don't you be sighing and ready to faint, alas! 
18 
TIE WAY TO MAKE 'AWE LICE AN IRISHMAN. 
Little she'll care for such pluckless philandering; 
Show that you know that her love she would like to 
grant— 
Plainly explain that yourself is the boy she'd want; 
Stand up and speak up, and make her be sensible, 
How she's in good luck that can get such a 
fencible. 
Tip her the wink, and take hold of the fist of her, 
Kiss her before she will have time to cry Christopher; 
Give her another, and then half-a-score of them, 
Still you will find her quite ready for more of them; 
If she gets crusty, and makes your ears ache a.bit, 
hush her, and please her, and don't let her speak of it; 
When in your arms you fairly have got her, sir, 
Her heart it will melt like a 
lump of fresh bitter, sir. 
Pitch to the devil your sighing and well-a-days, 
Ogling and singing of piperly melodies; 
Moaning and groaning may do, but I 
doubt it, boy, 
Take my advice, and go briskly about it, boy; 
Never be quibbling or scribbling of sonnets, sir, 
Fly at her face and lay thousands upon it, sir, 
Press her, caress her, be saucy and stylish, man, 
That is the way to make love like an Irishman. 
When she cries out, you're an impudent fellow, sir, 
Her eyes gainsay what her tongue it may tell you, sir; 
Walk with her, talk with her, and sit by the side of her; 
I'll be your ball that you'll soon make a 
bride of her; 
4' 
Arrah! the creatures, it's fairly I'm kilt with them, 
Could my heart hold the red sea, 'twould be filled with 
them; 
Far have I 
rambled, and surely where'er I 
went, 
'Twas with the girls I'd the fun and the merriment. 
Why ought women to be employed in the post-office? 
Because they know how to manage the mails (males.)

MY LOVE NELL, 
' As sung by B/LLY EMERSON'. 
On! come all you boys both far and near, 
And listen awhile to me, 
And a 
dismal story you will hear, 
About my love and me. 
I 
coorted lon.,g—my love was sthrong 
As the heart of a 
big oak three; 
But sorry I'm to say, 
My love is gone away 
To the shores av 
Chorus. 
For my love Nell 
Was a 
charmin' girl, 
From the Cove av Cork kem she, 
But I 
weeped and I 
wailed 
Whin the big ship sailed 
For the shores av Amer-i-kay. 
Whin I 
got to the church, 
I 
was left in the lurch, 
But let that day go by; 
Whin I 
got to the door, 
Nelly sez, 
I'm poor;" 
"Then my love," sez I, " good-bye, 
For I 
know right well 
You're an Irish girl, 
So you don't come over me." 
" 
Oh !" says Nelly, " d'ye mind, 
I'll lave you far behind, 
And I'll sail for America." 
For my love Nell, etc. 
Now come all ye Irish boys both far and near 
And a 
warnin' take by me, 
A

Is worth twinty thousand millions on a

HANDSOME DICK, THE SOAP-FAT MAN! 
As sung by BILLY EmEnsoN. 
Ant.—" Dandy Jim o' Carolina." 
IN 
Union Square there lived a 
maid, 
Her name was Susan, it was said, 
And parlor maid she long had been 
To a 
rich old gent called Colonel Green. 
The coachman tried her heart to win, 
But his fellow-servants with a 
grin, 
Cried, " Ah, there's no chance for you, Dan, 
For Susan loves her soap-fat man. 
Chorus. 
With his curly hair and handsome nose, 
He really was the pink of beaux; 
Find such another few girls can, 
As handsome Dick, the soap-fat man. 
Dick called one day to see his Sue, 
And what befell I'll tell to you, 
The master came home unawares, 
Poor Susan bolted down the stairs, 
Crying, " Cookee, I'm in such a 
fright, 
Here's master's come home nearly tight. 
Do, cookee, pray, devise some plan, 
To save my handsoml soap-fat man." 
With his curly hair, etc. 
OLD SHADY. 
Now cook was tall and fat you see, 
• 
And dearly loy'd a 
jolly spree. 
She dressed Dick up in woman's clothes, 
And he look'd a 
strapper, goodness knows. 
But Dan the coachman found it out, 
And out of pure revenge, no, doubt, 
With his story to the master ran, 
To betray poor Dick the soap fat man, 
With his curly hair, & e, 
OLD SHADY.

OH! IF I 
HAD SOME ONE WHO'D LOVE ME. 
As Sung by old JUDGE, 
On! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
My troubles, my trials who'd share, 
One to love and little reprove me, 
And lessen my heart of its care. 
Oh! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
To cherish and comfort me-too, 
The bright shining stars then above me 
Would prove a 
great happiness too, 
For 'tis love that's the bliss of creation, 
Only love that's in nature sublime, 
To the higher or lower in station, 
Love to all is a 
feeling divine. 
Chorus. 
Oh ! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
My troubles, my trials who'd share, 
One to love and little reprove me, 
And lessen my heart of its care. 
Oh! if I 
had some to love me, 
Then nature more lovely .would beam, 
The flowerets' sweet perfume around me 
Would hallow and gladden the scene. 
Oh! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
Whose heart and whose soul could be mine 
Then I'd praise the blest powers above me, 
For my life made thus truly divine. 
DO NOT DECEIVE ME.

For 'tis love that's the bliss of creation 
Only love that's in nature sublime, 
To the highest and lowest of station, 
To be loved is a 
feeling divine. 
Oh! if I 
had, Sze. 
DO NOT DEOEIVE 
Do not deceive me—never 
Let a 
careless word or tone 
Fall from thy lips, if ever 
Its truth thou would'st disown. 
To thee my faith I've given, 
With the fervency of youth. 
And my vows are vowed to heaven, 
Do not betray my truth. 
Do not deceive me—never 
Let thy heart inconstant be; 
With a 
love that dare not sever, 
Shall mine still cling to thee. 
Do not deceive me—others 
Perchance may greet thy smile, 
But a 
flame no coldness smothers 
In my bosom burns the while. 
Remember one, who'd only 
Thy first fond love retain, 
Nor leave my bosom lonely, 
To sigh for thee in vain. 
Do not deceive me—never 
Let thy heart inconstant be; 
With a 
love that dare not sever, 
Shall mine still cling to thee. 
What's de difference between a 
polite man and a 
dog? 
De polite man bows, and de dog bow-wows.

THE GENTLEMAN OF THE ARMY, 
As Sung by BILLY EMERSON% 
I'm Paddy Whack, of Ballyback, 
Not long ago turned soldier: 
In grand attack, in stoim or sack, 
None will than I 
be bolder. 
With spirits gay, I 
march away, . 
I 
please each fair beholder; 
And now they sing, " He's quite the thing, 
Och ! what a 
jovial soldier !" 
In Londonderry, or London merry, 
Och; faith, ye girls, I 
charm ye; 
And there ye come at beat of drum, 
To see me in the army. 
Chorus. 
Rub a 
dub dub, and pull Ii loo, 
Whack! fal.

The lots of girls my train unfurls, 
Would form a 
pleasant party; 
There's Kitty Lynch, a 
tidy wench, 
And Suke, and Peg M'Carthy; 
Miss Judy Baggs, and Sally Maggs, 
And Martha Scraggs, all storm me,

Admires me in the army.

Before me dumb, 
Or else they're mighty civil. 
There's Murty Roake, 
That often broke 
My head, now da.ren't harm me' 
But it's bows and scrapes, 
And off he snakes, 
Since I've been in the army.

PRETTY LITTLE SARAH. 
Or, 
Seven Dollars a week, 
As 
sung by BILLY EuEnsoN. 
Dly heart is like a 
pumpkin, swollen big with love, 
For one of the fairest girls in creation. 
She is too good f
or 
man— she 
ought 
to be above, 
Such a 
beauty is a 
credit to our nation, 
Her father keeps a 
farm-yard on the Bloomingdale 
Road, 
For this little virgin, of love I've got a 
load; 
I've spent a 
fortune on her, but of that I 
Only speak, 
But what a 
fortune I 
must haTe on seven dollars a 
week. _ • 
Chorus. 
Pretty little Sarah, lovely golden hair. 
Her beauty gives to other girls a 
warning. 
She ought to be an angel miles up in the air, 
I 
d 
marry her so early in.the morning 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas in the pouring rain,. 
I 
proffered her my arm and my umbrella; 
She answered with a 
smile, .I said I'd see her home, 
She thanked me with a 
voice so low and mellow. 
When we arrived at home, she said she'd ask me in, • 
But her parents they were poor, said I, " Poverty's no 
sin; " 
No doubt she thought me rich, but of course I 
didn't 
speak, 
For I 
was doing my heavy on seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, etc. 
She's got a 
little ankle, she's got a 
little foot, 
And pretty little fingers running taper: 
Her waist is round and small, her mouth is best of all, 
With ruby lips not twice as thick as paper ; 
She's always dressed in silk, her notions they are 
high; 
IETSTE CUEE. 
Although her stature's small, her bearing's in the sky, 
When she belongs to me, but of that I 
will not speak. 
What lots of silks she'll get from me on seven dollars a 
week! 
Pretty little Sarah, etc. 
THE IRISH CURE. 
THEY call me Katty Conner, 
A 
laughing girl am 1, 
But to get an honest living, 
Through Dublin streets I 
cry, 
The fruits of all the seasons round, 
Whether hot or cold, 
By the merry Irish cure, 
Are daily bought and sold. 
But I 
cannot tell why, I'm sure, 
They call me the Irish cure, 
But the gents wink and grin, 
Touch me under the chin, 
And call me the Irish cure. 
I 
deal in garden stuff and fruit, 
With fish I 
spend my hours, 
Such as rabbits, chickens, eggs and roots, 
Crabs and cauliflowers; 
No matter what the seasons are, 
I've something worth their buying, 
And tho' I'm laughing near and far, 
For other folk's good I'm crying, 
But I 
cannot toll why, I'm sure, 
They call me an Irish cure. 
But the gent; wink and grin, 
Touch me under the chin, 
And call me an Irish cure. 
There's Barney Lary courted me 
A twelvemonth and a 
day, 
But he never once supported me, 
28 
Lov-
E's rem:syn..", 
For all his work was play; 
Ile spent the wages he'd not got, 
And so badly was behaving, 
His brass and coppers went to pot, 
He at the pot-house spent his savings, 
Why he'd call me an Irish cure, 
I 
never could tell I'm sure, 
But the gents wink and grin, 
Chuck me under the chin, 
Saying, there's a 
sweet Irish cure. 
LOVE'S FAREWELL 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
MEET me to-night, when dewy stars 
Are in the heavens set, 
And we will bless the happy hour 
When first we met, 
Yea, meet me then, with winning smiles, 
Beneath our tiysting tree, 
And there will I 
most fondly breathe 
My parting vows to thee. 
Chorus. 
Meet me to-night, when dewy stars 
Are in the heavens set, 
And we will bless the happy hours 
When first in love we met. 
Since we, alas! are forced to part, 
I 
care not where I 
go, 
For by Fate's stern and harsh decree, 
Seas must between us flow, 
But thou wilt not forget me, then, 
Oh! no, it cannot be, 
Thou never canst forget the tears -
 
That I 
have shed for thee. 
Meet me to-night, etc.

Alas! 
true, that friends will change 
Like Summer's fragile flowers, 
And love too often blasted is 
By Winter's chilling hours,

I 
would but lightly mourn to think 
That all are changed but thee.

KISSING IN FUN. 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
YOUNG Joe he was as nice a 
man 
As any in the land, 
He never told his love to me, 
Tho' often press'cl my hand. 
Ms failings were but few indeed, 
In fact, I 
knew of none, 
Yet once he had the impudence 
To kiss me just in fun. 
I 
chid him in most tender words, 
Indeed, 'twas all in vain, 
For as he begg'd my pardon then, 
He kiss'd me o'er again. 
I 
tore myself from his embrace, 
And strove his grasp to shun, 
But with a 
kind apology, 
He said 'twas all in fun. - 
As time roll'd on and days went by, 
His lips met mine again, 
I 
half forgot to chide him then, 
I 
knew Iwould be in vain: 
THE GAY CONDUCTOR. 
Now ladies fair and maidens shy, 
Take my advice as one, 
Let lovers kiss not on the sly, 
-Unless you're fond of fun. 
THE GAY CONDUCTOR. 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
W HITE folks, give me your attention, while I 
sing you a 
little song, 
hope it's going to please you, though it isn't very 
long; 
Its all about a 
ladies' man, the handsomest by far, 
For he was a 
gay conductor on the City Railway Car. 
Chorus. 
He had such handsome whiskers, such pretty curling 
hair, 
He was a 
gay conductor on the City Railway Car. 
This young man was very vain, and put on many airs, • 
Paid attention to the ladies when he gathered in his 
fares, 
With his bewitching mustachio, and pretty curling hair; 
For he was a 
gay conductor on the City Railway Car. 
He had such handsome whiskers, etc. 
If by chance he saw a 
lady with pouting lip so sweet, 
He stopped the ear, and took her in, and helped her to 
a 
seat, 
He put his arm around her waist, and too polite by far, 
For he was a 
gay conductor on the City Railway Car. 
He had such handsome whiskers, etc. 
Angelina Pretsell, one day she took a 
ride, 
This gallant conductor came and sat down by her side, 
THE JOLLY CATS. 
31 
He made a 
sad impression, for she told her clear mamma, 
That she smelt a 
rum conductor on the City Railway 
Car. 
He had such handsome whiskers, etc. 
Now this young man was honest, for he never stole a 
clim e, 
But he lived upon the money, that by mistake he used 
to find, 
Now he sports a 
fancy watch and chain, and his friends 
both near and far, 
Are applying for a 
conductorship on the City Railway 
Car. 
He had such handsome whiskers, etc. 
THE JOLLY CATS. 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
DIERE are a 
lot of jolly cats, 
That often meet at night, 
To hold a 
concert on the roof, 
Or else to squall and fight. 
Chorus. 
And they always are so noisy, oh, 
So noisy, oh, so.noisy, oh, 
They always are so noisy, oh, 
Whilst on the roof they be. 
They fight, they bite, 
And swear and tear each other's hair, 
They call, they squall, 
Such noisy cats are they. 
With their mol row row, mol row row, 
Mol row row, mol row row, and 
Kwatchk I Phutt I

DARBY MAGUIRE. 
There they are again, there they are again, 
liwatchk! 
Phutt! there they are again, 
Such jolly cats are they. 
They kick up such a 
jolly row, 
In vain to sleep I 
tries, 
Their little claws I'm sure were made 
To scratch each other's eyes. 
For they always are, etc. 
They wander round the chimney pots, 
And climb the water spout,. 
And oft I 
have to throw a 
brick, 
To put them to the rout. 
For they always are, etc.. 
To watch their gambols and their pranks, 
Sometime S 
is jolly fun, 
Although I 
never shot a cat, 
I 
mean to buy a 
gun. 
For they always are, etc 
They drink our milk and steal our meat, 
And think it not a 
crime. 
And when they bring forth kittens, 
They come fifty at 
time. 
For they always are, etc. 
DARBY MAGUIRE, 
As 
sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
SOME say 'twas in England I 
first saw the light, 
And others in Scotland would have my first night; 
But, as writers on heroes are often astray, 
DARBY MAGUIRE. 
33 
I 
think for myself I'll have something to say. 
Oh! the night I 
was born, sure, I ery well know, 
When the Clergyman tumbled in, covered with snow: 
He laid hold of myself, and sat down by the fire, 
And made a 
good boy of young Darby Arguire. 
Chorus. 
Then, hurrah for Ould Ireland, the land of my birth! 
'Tis there you'll get plenty of pleasure and mirth, 
Where the beautiful girls are sure to admire 
Such rollicksome fellows as Darby I'Guire! 
From christ'nings to weddings what heavenly bliss, 
As I 
stand by the bride and obtain the first kiss, 
While the creature looks sly as if nothing occurred, 
And the husband looks daggers, but daren't say a 
word; 
Och! then, for the carving of praties and pigs! 
The piper begins for to " rattle the jigs," 
The girls jump up, and begin to perspire 
At the pleasure of dancing with Darby 111'Guire! 
Then, hurrah for Ould Ireland! etc. 
For twenty miles round, at a 
market or fair, 
I'm sure to be found, if I 
don't be elsewhere; 
I'm just on the spot when a 
row is begun, 
And I'm smashing away, for the sake of the fun; 
'Tis then that you'll see the big blackthorns all fly: 
Mum mnrther! you'd think 'twas a 
show'r from the sky! 
And who wins the battle? I 
never inquire; 
They're all " blood relations" to Darby :N.I'Guire. 
Then, hurrah for Ould Ireland! etc. 
But, speaking of rows, I 
don't wish to offend: 
For, I'm always the boy to assist a 
poor friend; 
Though first in.. 
the " field," and not last in the " row," 
I 
can mind number one, and look after the plow, 
Some paint Ragged Pat with a 
villainous face, 
34 
Inn, IRISH PIPER. 
But I 
hope none of that in my own you can trace; 
To see every man happy is all I 
desire, 
Contented and jovial, like Darby M'Guire. 
Then, hurrah for OuId Ireland! etc.

THE IRISH PIPER. 
Written and first sung in Amerida by IVILLIAlt CAnLICTON. 
AIR—" Organ Grinder." 
You see before you an Irishman, 
Who groans both night and day, 
For the loss of Judy Callaghan, 
Who stole my heart away. 
With an Irish piper she fell in love, 
His name is Teddy Quipes, 
, 
And he melted her with lovin' tunes, 
Ho played upon his pipes—pipes—pipes. 
Chorus. 
So I 
grunt and groan, and cry, " Ochone ! 
Judy you're a 
viper; 
You're gone away from your Pat Molloy, 
For a 
one-eyed Irish piper." 
I 
bill- my Judy to a 
fair, 
To thrate her to a 
spree, 
And whin we wint into the tint, 
This piper she did see. 
One eye was blind, an' the other one 
It could not see a slim; 
But though he could not ogle her, 
By my song she ogled him—him—him. 
So I 
grunt, etc. 
THE IRISH PIPER: 
I 
axed my Judy to take a 
dhrop 
Of whiskey clear and pure, 
And axed the piper just to play 
For us the " Perfect Cure." 
With his blind eye he winked at Judy, 
As he squeezed the bags, 
I 
got so vexed I 
gripped them next, 
And I 
tore them into rags—rags—rags. 
But I 
grunt and groan, etc.. 
I 
floored the piper with my fist, 
And broke his bags and pipes, 
And with the leather of the bags 
I 
leathered Teddy Quipes, 
His chanthers and his dhrones I 
bruk, 
And I 
damaged his ould hat. 
I 
tuk a 
glass o' whiskey thin, 
And I 
left them afther that—that—that. 
But I 
grunt, etc. 
I 
never more will fall in love 
With any other woman, 
I'll sing my song and keep my heart 
For the good times that are cumin', 
And if my Judy I 
should see, 
And the Irish piper too, 
I'll come again some other time, 
And I'll tell yez what I'll do —do—do. 
But I 
will not grunt, nor I 
will not groan, 
Though Judy is a 
viper; 
And though she's gone from Pat Molloy, . 
With a 
one-eyed Irish piper. 
What mechanic never turns to the left? 
A 
wheelwright.

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND, 
Or where the Apple Praties Grow. 
Mr name is Ned 0'.Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killar-
ney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney, 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd 
like to know- . 
I'm none of your iulgudderies, nor other shabby fam-
ilies, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh! I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy 
Whacks, 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties 
grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties 
grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscar-
berry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0: 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Calla-
ghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
-can plainly show: 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, where the Apple Praties 
grow; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, where the Apple Praties

May heaven still protect our hospitable country, 
Where first I 
Grew my living breath, and heard its

Where, many a 
pl casa.nt evening, my love and I 
did 
go, 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so 
merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to 
show. 
Oh those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
-gay, unthinking 
boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, where the Apple 
Praties grow; 
With the lads who live in Ireland, where the Apple 
Praties grow. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth, 
was he: 
Great gifts unto our country. he freely did bestow; 
lie banished all the frogs and toads, that sheltered in 
our country, 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go; 
There is one fact, undoubtedly, that cannot contra-
dicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be 
found 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, where the Apple 
Praties grow; 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, where the Apple 
Praties grow. 
THE FELLOW THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. 
An—" 
Jernima Brown." 
IN 
sad despair I 
wonder, 
My heart is full of woe, 
Though on my grief I 
ponder; 
What to do, It do not know, 
For cruel fate does on me frown. 
The trouble seems to be, 
There's another fellow in this here town, 
That's just the image of me. 
Chorus. 
0, wouldn't I 
like to catch him once 
Whoever he may be; 
And wouldn't I 
give him particular fits, 
The fellow that looks like me. 
With a 
lady fair I 
started, 
The Central Park going to, 
But was stopped by . a 
man in the street who said, 
" 
Just pay this bill you owe." 
In vain I 
said " I 
know you not," 
He wouldn't let me free; 
Till the crowd came round, and the bill I 
paid, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh wouldn't I 
like, etc. 
The other day, I 
chanced to go, 
Through a 
narrow street up town, 
When a 
man in a 
rage seized hold of me, 
Saying, " I've caught you, Mr. Brown. 
You know my daughter you have wronged," 
But the gal I 
never did see; 
lie beat me till I 
was black and blue, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh wouldn't I 
like, etc. 
I 
sat one evening sparking, 
With a 
gal as dear as life, 
When a 
lady who had just come in, 
Says, " Brown, how is your wife?" 
In vain I 
said, " I'm a 
single man, 
THE SCAVENGER'S DA_LL. 
But married I 
hope to be;" 
They called me a 
swindler, kicked me out, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh 
wouldn't I 
like, etc. 
To a 
ball I 
went one evening, 
And was just enjoying the sport, 
When a 
policeman gripped me by the arm, 
Saying, " You're wanted down to court, 
You've escaped me once but this here time, 
I'll take care you don't get free;" 
So I 
was arrested, dragged to jail, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh wouldn't I 
like, etc. 
I 
was tried next day, found guilty too, 
And about to be taken down,; 
Whe a 
another policeman then brought in 
The right criminal, Mr. Brown. 
They set me free, they locked up him. 
Oh, he was a 
sight to see! 
He was the ugliest creature that. ever I 
saw, 
The fellow that looks like me. 
Oh wouldn't I 
like, etc. 
THE SCAVENGER'S BALL. 
On, sure such a 
party, so gay and so hearty, 
Of comical persons both great and small, • 
One night met together, in spite of the weather. 
To dance at and prance at the scavenger's ball.

Had married old Peg with a 
hump on her back; 
So he sent invitations to friends and relations,. 
To kick up a 
spree and the whiskey to smack.

aEGS SCAVENGER'S CALL. 
Chorus. 
Oh sure such a 
party, so gay. and so hearty, 
Of comical persons both great 'and small, 
One night met together, in spite of the weather, 
To dance at and prance at the scavengers ball 
The room was alive in, the friends were all driving, 
Of scavengers nearly a 
hunched were met; 
With women full thirty, all ragged and dirty, 
With pipes in their mouths, such a 
comical . set. 
Some joking, some tearing, some cursing and swearing, 
And for want of chair-bottoms, they sat on the floor; 
They made such a 
clatter, drank -ruin and pia:1u'', 
Out of kettles and saucepans, a 
dozen or more. 
Oh sure, etc. 
Then every sinner bawled out, Vere's the dinner? 
Ve all feel so peckish a 
horse ve could eat. 
Not to be provoking, the grub came up smoking, 
They all licked their chops 
at 
the 
si
ght 
of 
the treat. 
They wolfed up the herrings, paratees, and parings, 
And the whiskey in quarts they did pom down their 
throats, 
The women, dear honies, ate bread and polonies, 
And bacon, to give just their stomachs a 
coat. 
Oh sure, etc. 
• 
As soon as 'twas over ,
they being in cl
over, 
Twelve farthing ra:_thlights they stuck in some clay; 
The piper so merry, struck up Paddy Gary, 
And all began dancing and prancing away. 
The women did scuffle, the men they did shuffle, 
The piper blew till:he was black in the face; 
With stamping and boring, they broke in the flooring, 
And kicked up their heels with such comical grace. 
Oh sure, etc, 
Then Paddy inviting his friends all to fighting, 
Seized a 
shillaleh to knock the coves down; 
DTLTY TAYLOR. 
Half crazy with whiskey, he bawled out so frisky, 
I'll crack Teddy Haloran's bead for a 
crown. 
Then Teddy so civil, cries, Arrah, you divil! 
By Jases I'm ready to fight me own cause, 
He gave him a 
topper —och hone. sick a 
whopper, 
He smashed all the teeth that he had in his jaws. 
Oh sure, etc. 
The rest of the varmint, as they seed no harm in't 
Seized on the chairs and began fighting too: 
They gave their poor flappers sich illig,ant tappers 
And the ladies all joined in the hubbubabOo, 
Pulling and mauling, scratching and bawling, 
They rushed in the street, just to finish the fray,

YOUNG ladies, pray listen to me, tho' to gossip I'm no 
ways inclin'd, 
And I'll make you as wise as myself, if you store up my 
hints in your mind; 
MY conduct, you'll own, is discreet, tho' to tell of some 
people I 
ought— 
But I 
never tell tales out of school—because I'm not a 
gal of that sort! 
Chorus. 
So, ladies, take pattern by me, let your conduct be just 
as it ought; 
You may all have the follies of youth—but I'm not a 
gal 
of that sort I 
There's many young gals that I 
know— though the same 
thing of me can't be said— 
Bring home to their mothers a 
child, before they've a 
husband to wed; 
With me, now, it's different quite, for I'm rather too wise 
to be caught; 
I 
should like 't 
m to try it with me—but I'm not a 
gal of 
that sort! 
So, ladies, take pattern by me, by the he creaaires 
never be caught; 
I 
don't care for the men, not a 
bit—for I'm not a 
gal of 
that sort I 
There's many folks cut a 
fine dash, and their clothes on 
the tally they get; 
But I 
always pay ready for mine, you can tell by the 
style and the fit. 
There's Mrs. Futtox, a 
neighbor of mine, has a 
tally-
man call once a 
week— 
And the furniture could tell a 
tale, if it had but the 
power to speak. 
Chorus. 
So, ladies, take pattern by me, by a 
bonnet or shawl 
don't be caught; 
For I 
never take tallymen in—for I'm not a 
gal of that 
sort. 
It's really surprising to me, and my morals it oftentimes 
shocks, 
To see women walking the streets, with mud on their 
draggle-tailed frocks ! 
Now I 
always take care of my tail, as the puddles I'm 
stepping between— 
What's the use of having good legs, if you're frighten'd 
to let 'em be seen ? 
Chorus. 
So, ladies, take pattern b-i

you ought; 
You'll find nothing dirty on me—no I'm not a

I've known some young ladies go out, tho' they say it's 
done out of a 
lark, 
And spend all the money they've got, with the soldiers 
at night in the Park; 
I 
don't say they mean any harm, but tole care of the

They're rare chaps to gammon the girls, when they find 
they've got one of the sort.

My dear Miss, I 
don't know your name, tho' offended I 
hope you'll not be, 
But that young man that's sitting with you, is laughing

In company that's not genteel, better manners he ought 
to be taught, 
Tho' I 
blush, I 
don't know what you mean, for I'm not

don't like to see gals guzzle gin, and with pickled eels 
blow themselves out, 
Then gammon they feel very ill, and in fits begin kick-

shouldn't take more 
than a

AIR—" Old Sir Simon the King." 
COME, come, my hearts so bold, 
Let us be merry and wise; 
'Tis a 
very good proverb of old, 
Suspicion has double eyes, 
Whatever we say or do, 
Let's not drink to disturb the bin; 
Let's laugh for an hour or two, 
But never get drunk again. 
Chorus. 
For much drink makes a 
man drunk, + 
And drunkenness makes a 
man dry, 
And drought will make a 
man sick, 
And sickness you know makes us die. 
A 
glass of rum punch is good 
TO drive the cold winter away, 
'Twill cheer and enliven the blood 
Most when a 
man's spirits decay, 
But he that drinks too much, 
Of his head will soon complain; 
So we'll have a 
gentle touch, 
And never get drrnik again. 
For much, etc. 
Good liquor was made for man, 
But man was not made for it; 
Let's drink as long as we can, 
While we drink not away our wit. 
Good fellowship's often abused, 
When liquor affects the brain,

WE'LL NEVER GET DRUNK AGAIN. 
But we'll have it far better us'd, 
For we'll never get drunk again. 
For much, etc. 
When with good fellows we meet, 
A 
bowl among three or four 
Will make us stand on our feet, 
While lots lie drunk on the floor. 
Thei landlord come fill us a 
bowl, 
And let it be liquor that's fine, 
'Twill cheer and enliven the soul, 
And we'll never get drunk again. • 
For much, etc. 
Enough's as good as a 
feast, 
If a 
man did his measure but know, 
A 
sot is worse than a 
beast, 
For he'll drink till he cannot go. 
Since he cannot past time recall, 
In a 
tavern that's spent in vain, 
Let's learn to be sober all, 
And never get drunk again.

SERAPHINA SARAH JANE MATILDA. 
Am—" 
Jordan." 
Just listen to my woes, my trouble I'll disclose, 
And when I 
have related my narration, 
With truth say then you can, I'm a 
victimized young 
man, 
Deserving of the deepest consolation. 
My name is Richard Green, bamboozled I 
have been; 
The very thought of it does me bewilder: 
I've been caught in a 
snare by a 
feminine so fair, 
Named Seraphina Sarah Jane Matilda. 
Chorus. 
I've lost my love, alack! 
I 
shall never get her back, 
Such heartless conduct does my head bewilder, 
To leave me in this way, 'twas wrong of course you'll 
say, 
- 
Of Sarah Jane Matilda Seraphina. 
My Seraphina fair was a 
housemaid in Union Square, 
And had a 
very tidy situation, 
Besides her I 
adore, there were thirteen " slaveys" 
more. • 
Each had a " Sunday out" too, in rotation; 
Each fourteenth Sunday, I 
dress'd out so spruce and 
spry, 
On. wings of love did quickly fly to meet her; 
I 
felt enraptured quite, and oft said with delight, 
" 
That, I 
without a 
bit of salt could eat her." 
I've lost my love, etc. 
But one unlucky day, I 
chanced to pass her way, 
A 
lean and lanky M. P. near was standing, 
I 
staggered back, oh law! I 
my Seraphina saw, 
A 
sandwich up the area to him handing. 
52 
SERAPHINA SARAH J'ANE MATILDA. 
With rage my buzzum glowed, I 
hollered, " Well I'm 
blowed, 
You've been and guy me turnups' for another:" 
Said she; Be off, you goose, you aint a 
bit of use; 
Don't think I 
loved you, 'cos it was more Vother. 
I've lost my love, etc. 
Such conduct gave me pain, my tears came down like 
rain; • 
Said she, " Don't put yourself in such a 
flurry," - 
The words she used to me, I've tried, but failed to see 
In Johnson, Walker, or in Lindley Murray. 
Said I, " Your words polite, arn't dictionary quite," 
Said she, " It jest the langwidge is to suit ver, 
As for diekshunarys too, I 
think 't

xt 
me and you, 
You'd better, _
Vick, shun areas for the future. 
• 
I've lost my love, etc. 
The cruel " M. P." he in custody took me, 
Charged me with lurking round about the area; 
My jugular he scragged, to the station I 
was dragged, 
Which placed me in a 
very queer quandary, 
I 
was confined as well, all night in a 
cold cell, 
And shivery and shaky in the morning; 
I 
stood before the judge, 'gainst whom I 
owe a 
grudge, 
For giving me a 
twelvemonth " as a 
warning.' 
I've lost my love, etc. 
So single men beware of the false and fickle fair, 
Know well on whom you're fixing your affection, 
Just mind you're not caught slap, like mice are in a 
trap, 
Lest afterwards you suffer a 
rejection. 
Take warning then by me, let this a 
lesson be, 
Don't let the fl - male sex your head bewilder; 
You see without a 
doubt, how I 
have been " tarred out," 
By my Seraphim Sarah Jane Matilda. 
I've loamy love, etc.

Worth all their cordials, balms, and spices:

The Captain's truth brought on a, crisis.

THE LIVELY FLEA. 
Parody on the " Ivy Green." 
On, a 
dainty old chap is the lively flea, 
As he creepeth o'er young and old, 
His choice food is fat, no lean liketh he, 
And he's not werry fond of the cold, 
You can't be too warm when he finds you in bed, 
To pleasure your dainty skin, 
Off a 
nice young kid wot's been veil fed, 
Is a 
werry good meal for him. 
Chorus. 
Creeping where no light there be, 
A 
dainty old chap is the lively flea, 
Hatching, scratching, 
All over your body at night he'll be, 
Creeping, hopping, 
A 
dainty old chap is the lively flea. 
Fast he stealeth on, though he hasn't no wings, 
But a 
stunning good hopper is he, 
How sharply he stingeth, how nimbly he springs, 
From your toe to the top of your knee, 
And slily he hides and cannot be found, 
Yen tormenting to you he behaves, 
A HERMIT ONCE DWELT IN A VAT.LTIY

The rich spot which his appetite craves. 
Creeping, etc. 
Old bedsteads they burn, and the sacking they rout, 
And thousands are crusli'd, d'ye see, 
All kinds of clothing are turned inside out, 
But you cannot get rid of the flea. 
This queer old chap in future nights, 
Shall fatten on he or she, 
For the stateliest man or woman he bites, 
They are all on 'em food for the flea.

A 
HERMIT ONCE DWELT IN A 
VALLEY. 
A 
HERMIT once lived in a 
valley, 
A 
heaven it was as they tell, 
Yet from this sweet home he would sally, 
In the gay world's freedom to dwell, 
He sought eery scene for a 
treasure, 
Of bliss he expected in vain, 
Till deceived with false friendship and pleasure, 
He returned to his valley again. 
But the pride of his welcome was over, 
The flowers in his absence had died 
The birds hung their heads for the rover, 
They sing not their music, they sighed; 
But the hermit knew how to awaken, 
Their hearts from their sorrow and pain, 
They forgot soon, they'd e'er been forsaken, 
For he ne'er left the valley again. 
THE BOLD DRAGOON. 
And thus from thy love I've been roaming, 
But never found truth like to thine, 
And now like the hermit, I'm coming, 
To cherish thee ever as mine; 
Tho' the blush of thy cheek did receive, love, 
From my bitter unkindness, a 
stain, 
Oh! forgive me, and henceforth believe, love, 
I 
will never forsake thee again  
,THE BOLD DRAGOON. 
A 
Favorite Comic Song. 
As sung by BILLY EMERSON. 
THERE was an ancient fair, she loved a 
n.ate young man, 
And she could not thrQw sly looks at him but only 
through her fan; 
With her winks und blinks, this waddling minx, 
Her quizzing glass, her leer and sidle; 
Oh ! she loy'd a 
bold dragoon, with his long sword, sad-
dle, bridle! 
Whack! row di dow, dow, etc. 
She had a 
rolling eye, its fellow it had none, 
Would you know the reason why, it was, because she 
had but one; 
With her winks and. blinks, this waddling minx, 
She couldn't keep her one eye idle; 
0! she leered at this dragoon, with his long sword, sad-
dle, bridle, etc. 
Now lie was tall and thin, she squab and short was 
grown, 
He looked just like a 
mile in length, and she like a 
mile 
stone; 
THE HAPPIEST PADDY ODT.

With her winks and blinks, this waddling minx, 
Her quizzing glass, her leer and sidle; 
0! she sigh'd to this dragoon, " Bless your long sword, 
saddle, bridle," etc. 
Soon he led unto the church the beauteous Mrs. Flinn, 
Who a 
walnut could have crack'd between her lovely 
nose and chin; 
0! then such winks, in married links, 
The four foot bride from church did sidle, 
As the wife of this dragoon, with his long sword, saddle, 
bridle, etc. 
A 
twelvemonth scarce had passed, when he laid her un-
der ground, 
Soon he threw the onion from his eyes, and touched ten 
thousand pound: 
For her winks and blinks, her money chinks, 
He does not let her cash lie idle. • 
So long life to this dragoon, with his long sword, saddle, 
bridle, etc.

By trying to be all in one myself.

DIOX LUCKLESS,

And nought I've met but discontent from weary day to 
day, 
DICK LUCKLESS. 
61 
Whatever star presided on the night that gave me birth, 
Saw one of the most unlucky rogues that ever trod the 
earth, 
31y mother scarcely had the bliss to tickle my chubby 
nose, 
When she was called by angels to the land where all re-
pose, 
My father two nights after, went out upon a 
spree, 
And never came back nor left a 
nurse to sooth or suckle 
me. 
And never came back, etc. 
I 
was taken by the polls to the baby institute, 
Where they gave me sweetened starch for milk and lau-
danum drops to boot: 
To see the way they treated me would make you almost 
cry, 
But I 
throve apace, like a 
dairy cat though the doctor 
swore I'd die. 
When yeays of suffering were past and I 
to boyhood 
gro wn, 
The7 gave me a 
trade to get me bread—a 
trade I 
hat' 
to own. 
When first they told me what rd be, my life blood 
freezing ran, 
And they made of me a 
tailor, when they should have 
made a 
man. 
And they made of me, etc. 
Spoken. —*Well, when I 
was deemed competent to pad-
dle my own boat, I 
was let out to make my living.—I 
was about as well posted in the ways of the world, as 
Cincinnati hog would be in the movements of the " Lan-
cers" or " Varsovienne." I 
was going down the Bowery 
one day when I 
met an old fondling chum of mine, 
Tom Quigley, who got from under the parental care of 
the Institute a 
year or so before me. 
Tom compliment-
ed me on my appearance, said he was glad to meet me 
.uicit LUCKLESS.

DICK LUCKLESS. 
&c.--asked me to take a 
horn—we had it—asked me 
what I 
intended doing—said that no man of any brains 
-.vould work in this city while he could live like a 
gen-
tleman without it.—" Look at me," saidTom, " dressed 
in Brooks's best, living like a 
game cock, and never 
does o. damn thing from one .end of the week to the 
other. " I'll tell you what yoUll do Dick," says he, " be 
a 
prize-fighter: you'll be just A 
1 
in the light weights, and 
_ 
as soon as you get recognized among the big 'uns you're 
hanky dory all your life. 
And to show you that I 
am 
not on the humbug, I'll back you to-morrow morning 
against Jim Sniffier, one of the best " feathers" in the 
4.th Ward." We had another Bourbon:—" Will you 
tight him ?" said Tom. " I 
wilt,'" says L Tom wanted fun 
and he had it. 
The necessary arrangements being 
inade, next morning at 9 
o'clock I 
found myself pitted 
against one of the hardest looking .villains I 
ever saw. 
His head was as hard as an anvil. 
It wouldn't do to 
back out. 
We met--shook hands and went at it—but 
Jim soon finished me. 
He made a 
present of two black 
eyes, a 
crooked mouth, and then treated -me to any 
quantity of my own claret. 
Sam Slash seconded me and 
threw up the sponge at the end of the .second round, 
indeed if he knew his biz, he'd have thrown it up before 
the first. 
However we had the American flag between 
us, as Jim got all the stars and I 
got all the stripes." 
With an empty stomach and broken nose I 
roamed 
from street to street, 
A 
crownless hat adorned my head, and legless boots my 
A 
junk man down 
the 
Hook twigged me, 
and called 
as 
feet. , 
, he caught my eye, . 
Come into my rag and bone store my lovely light 
. weight boy. 
The M. P.s on the corner suspiciously eyed me, 
And one of them followed ma half a 
mile—he smelled a 
burglary. 
" 
Judge Mansfield wants you here below," he said with 
scornful leer, 
" 
What for ?" says I, " Your jiramys to see, so come 
along my dear." 
For what says I, etc. 
His honor sat upon a 
bench high up above the crowd, 
And in his presence there I 
blushed and reverently 
bowed, 
" 
Not know your parents eh ?" says he, " I 
never had 
none," says I. 
A 
frown appeared upon his face, " iSix months, my light 
weight boy," 
'When my sentence had expired, 'twas in the glowing 
fall, 
I 
bid adieu to lock and key and cell and bugs and all, 
Resolved to earn a 
livelihood as honest men should do, 
I'd go to work and take the pledge and join the temper-
ance few. 
I'd go to work, etc. 
" 
Three dollars inauguration fee," 'twas more than I 
could pay, 
So I 
put it back, I 
put it back, and sure it's back to-clay, 
For so much money of my own, by gum I'd never seen, 
Besides, my coat would shabby look beneath a 
scarf of 
green. 
My boarding-house was on the flags, my bed an alley 
way, 
When Molly Grogan passed me by, just at the break of 
day, 
" 
You're early up my cove," says she, " I 
got no tiu" 
says I, 
Come in and take a 
drink my lad, I'm sure you're very 
dry. 
Come in and take, etc. 
64 
M
elt LTICKLESS. 
Spoken.—My eyes stared in vacant wonder at Molly's 
kind offer.—Did she mean it?—yes she did mean it, and 
all my fine resolutions about temperance were nowhere. 
And Molly was charming—a beautiful blonde — such 
hair—angels wear hair like Molly's—no one else. 
When 
she smiled she put me in mind of Paradise—I 
could live 
looking at her for ever. 
Her stockings were not stuffed 
either—I 
could see that—no cotton about her—the gen-
uine metal was Molly.—Bverything was her own. Well, 
we went to a 
liquor store,—had 4 
drinks—the bartender, 
you know, saw Molly handing me the money to pay— 
and he was not very scrupulous about the quantity— 
bartenders as a 
rule seldom are when there s 
stamps 
around.—Yes she gave me a 
two dollar bill to pay for 
them, and another two dollar bill to buy myself a 
pair of 
gaiters. 
The bills were on the Bank of Blowhard in 
Jersey. 
I 
wish the Devil'd blew 'em out of my hands 
when she gave them to me. 
When we were after' the 
4th whet, Molly says to me, " Wait here a 
minute, I 
want 
to go out; I 
won't be long "—" All right," says I—I 
did 
wait, but Molly never came back. 
After a 
while the bartender hinted that it was time to 
" 
settle for them drinks." I 
chucked out one of the 2 
dollar bills with an air of wounded pride. 
He looked at 
it, and at me, " Ain't you fly' this morning?' says he, 
" 
or what do you take me for? 
That bill ain't no good." 
I 
tossed him out the other. " That's just as bad," says 
he. / did not know what to do, but he did. 
He went 
out and he fetched a 
cv and the cop fetched inc—to 
the stone palace in Centre street, where I 
was aceomo-
dated with a 
private apartment for three weeks, till the 
Recorder, or somebody else in power, taking my case 
into consideration, procured my removal to an academy 
up the river—built for German Professors and other 
musicians like myself—called Sing Sing. 
A beautiful 
retreat—How 
very considerate of our good Government! 
I 
si3ent four years there and am now just returned.. 
And now I'm free once more my boys to roam where-
ever I 
choose, 
Without a 
coat—without a 
hat—without a 
cent to lose. 
But ye beware of maidens fair who travel at break of 
day, 
And hand you Jersey Blowhard bills the tavern score to 
pay. 
THE HORRIBLE TALE 
Of a 
Suicidal Family. 
NEW '
VERSION. • 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
On! an norrible tale I 
have to tell 
Of sad disasters that befell 
A 
family that once resided, 
Just in the very same thoroughfare as I 
did. 
The pa-ri-cut was so grim a 
gruffin 
He never liked no fun nor nuffin, 
And he never made the least endeavor 
To make a 
joke not what-sum-de-ver. 
Chorus. 
For oh it is such a 
norrible tale, 
'Twill make your faces all turn pale, 
Your eyes with grief will be overcome; 
Tweedle twaddle twiddle twiddle twum. 
They never saw no compa-nee, 
Tho' they was a 
most respectable fami-lee; 
And ev'ry boy and ey'ry gal 
Grew ily-po-con-der-i-a-cal. 
They thought they had all sorts of sorrows, 
66 
Au/. HORRIBLE TALE. 
And conjur'd up all kind3 of horrors, 
Each had a 
face as long as a 
ladder, 
And was frighten'd into fits if they saw their own shad-
der. 
For oh, etc. 
They. sat with the curtains drawn down tight, 
On purpose to keep out the light. 
Father, Mother, Sister and Brother 
Never spoke a 
word to one another. 
Well, at last this doleful, dismal lot, 
So very melancholy got, 
That an end to theirselves they did agree, 
When they had settled which end it was to be. 
For oh, etc. 
First the father into the garden did walk, 
And cut his throat with a 
lump of chalk: 
Then the mother an end to herself she put, 
By banging of herself in the water butt; 
Then the sister went down on her hen (led knees, 
And smothered herself with toasted cheese: 
But the linther, who was a 
determined young fellah, 
Went and poisoned himself with his umbrella. 
For oh, etc. 
Then the little baby in the cradle, 
Shot itself dead with a 
silver ladle, 
While the servant girl seeing what they did, 
Strangled herself with the et:,ucepan 
The miserable cat, by the kitchen fire, 
Swallowed a 
portion of the fender and did expire; 
And a 
fly on the ceiling—this case was the wust 'un, 
Went and blowed itself up with " spontaneous combus-
tion," 
For oh, etc. 
AS GOOD, AND A GREAT Dio,kT4 Bat.t.Es. 
67 
So here's a 
moral if you choose, 
Don't never give way to the blues, 
Or you may come to the dreadful ends, 
Of these my melancholy friends. 
For ain't it now a 
norrible tale? 
Hope it's made your faces all turn pale, 
Your eyes with grief is overcome. 
Tweedle twaddle twiddle twiddle twum. 
AS 
GOOD, AND A 
GREAT DEAL BETTER. 
Ara-" Oh! Cruel.' 
OH! I 
met her on a 
steamer as I 
journeyed to Ore-
morne, 
A 
crinoline and pork-pie hat her figure did adorn, 
Our glances met, she smird at me, then, as if unawares, 
My arm it slipped around her waist, whilst on the cabin 
stairs; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd go with me. 
She said, " Yes, if I'd 
let her." 
'Twas just as good as going home—yes, as good, and a 
great deal better. 
So we went into the gardens, danced the polka and qua-
From ni
dru
ile
lealf half-past eleven at night stood not ten 
minutes still; 
Then to the supper-room we went, and had a 
first-rate 
spread, 
With lots of wine— Oh! 'twas very fine, but it got into 
my head; 
For after, when I 
tried to dance, tumbled and upset 
her, 
I 
really felt a..-3 
good as tight—yes, as good, and a 
great 
better, 
68 
is GOOD, AND A GREAT DEAL BETTER. 
I 
felt so very much in love, whilst thus out on the hop, 
I 
went slap down on both my knees, and did the ques-
tion pop, 
She said she'd have me; I 
felt glad, the folks began to 
stare, 
I 
asked her her address, she said it was in Union 
Square. 
Thinks I, then she's an heiress— Oh 1 
how lucky that I 
met her, 
She's as good as " any other gal "—yes. as good, and a 
great deal better. 
Then that same night, with many a 
vow, and pressure 
of the hands, 
We tailed about the wedding-day, but she wouldn't hear 
of bans, 
Then with a 
kiss we parted, but the parting caused such 
sorrow. 
I 
promis'd that in Union Square I'd call upon the mor-
row. 
Then to the clergyman's we'd go, and join in Hymen's 
fetters, 
'Twere just as good at once to wed—yes, as good, and a 
great deal better. 
Next morn, to Union Square I 
went, my heiress rich to 
see, 
But on arriving at the number nam'd, such a 
queer sight 
- stagged me, 
The fair one I 
to Cremorne took was but the servant 
I 
found .she had eight dollars a 
month, and that her 
name was Sal. 
She was talking to a " Bobby," as on the steps I 
met 
her, 
I 
star'd. " He's as good as you, said she, " yes, aa 
good, and a 
great deal better." 
MAN IS BUT A PIPE. 
69 
She left off scouring down the steps, and said, " Now, 
• young man, stop. 
And let no gal another night catch you out on the hop. 
If you object . to marry me, you must lay down the ready, 
For me to marry ' Bobby' with, and then you'll be more 
steady. 
You'd better pay the money quick, and get out of ray 
debt, or - 
It's as good as a 
breach of promise case—yes, as good, 
and a 
great deal better." 
So mind, all fast young gentleman who journey to ere-
morne, 
Or any other gardens where such crinoline is worn, 
Do not propose to wed strange girls, however well they 
dress, 
Or else, like me, you perhaps may get is such another 
mess, 
Be sure you know her station well before you say you'll 
wed her, 
A 
little care is just as good—yes, as good, and a 
great 
deal better. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air.--" Raking the Moon." 
CONTENTED I sit with my pint and my pipe, 
Puffing sorrow and care far away, 
And surely the brow of grief nothing can wipe, 
Like smoking and moistening our clay, 
For though lager can banish man's reason afar, 
'Tis only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
Who with reason or sense would be ever at war 
And don't know when enough he has got. 
A :o:.4Ar4A.

LEATHER AND LEARNING. 
Chorus. 
For though at my simile many may joke, 
Man is but a 
pipe and his life but smoke. 
Yes a 
man and a 
pipe are much nearer akin, 
Than has as yet been understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are they good. 
They one and the other composed are of clay, 
And, if nightly I 
tell nature's plan, 
Take but the breath from them both quite away, 
The pipe dies and so does the man. 
For though, etc. 
Thus I'm told by my pipe that to die is man's lot; 
And sooner or latter he must, 
For, when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a 
pipe that's smoked out, he is dust. 
So you who would wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not strife, care or sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day, 
For you may be smoked out to-morrow.

Spoket—What is it that learning and leather can't 
accomplish? 
But leather preceded learning, leather 
came into the world before learnin; all the beasts of the 
earth were covered with hide, and that was leather run-
ning about the fields and forests in different forms; 
then there was Adam and Eve; they wore hides, though 
they wore fig-leaves to hide it; leather again.

Adam could not write his own name, for learning was 
not invented; leather again.

into new paper: another man turns hot water into coal

on brick dust they spin red silk, on gold dust they spin 
yellow, on sawdust they spin wool color; feed them. 
on hot coals they spin thunder and lightning color, 
feed them on grass they spin green, and feed them on 
sugar they will spin a sweet color. 
Now, as the in-
ventor of all this was man, and this man wore a 
hide, 
there we have leather a7ain, and thus what is impossible
