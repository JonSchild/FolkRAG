Field Notes 
Pre-Interview 
 
John and I made arrangements to do the interview at the speedway ahead of a race in early July, 
depending on how his wife’s recovery was going, and whether he’d be needed at home that week. I 
checked in on the Tuesday (6th) to see how the week was looking, and whether he thought we’d still be 
on for the Friday or to reschedule for the following week. John said it was looking good so we were 
confirmed for Friday July 9th.  
 
When I got to the speedway, I walked up to the employee entrance and mentioned I was looking for 
John Nelson for an interview, and he pointed him out to me – that he was the one wearing the black 
shirt talking to his son (Steve Petty) and Zach (infield official). So I walked over and introduced myself to 
John, Steve, and Zach (Rick Zachary)- who John said would be great to interview as well, as he does the 
infield and response and all of that, and is one of the longest serving employees at the track - up there 
with Dave Rinker. 
 
We ended up setting up under a covered eating area next to the concession stand, where I checked in 
with John again how his wife was doing, and we spoke a bit about the interview process and the 
weather – as it was looking like it could go either way. After setting up my equipment and tripod, I did a 
sound check with the microphone for the input levels, and the background noise (as we were outside, 
and the hive of activity of the speedway on a Friday night was starting to pickup), and then took a seat 
opposite John and got started with the interview.  
 
Interview 
 
During the interview, John traced his history and first exposure to racing, growing up in Lancaster and 
attending a race at the Lancaster Speedway with his Uncle. John shared how he first got involved in 
racing, through working on a pit crew with a friend for a number of years and traveling, and then 
eventually once that friend ended up transitioning into a track official position he was asked to also take 
up a role at the track. Due to time we didn’t jump into this period of the interview – as I was mindful of 
not wanting to keep John longer than would be comfortable for him, as he needed to be ready around 
6/6:15pm for the track. So we shifted a bit to focusing especially on the race director role, and John 
walked through how he got his start as Race Director, working for Dirtcar Northeast as a traveling 
director (and those challenges) for a number of years, which is the major dirt organization and traveling 
racing series in the area, and then transitioning into a weekly race director role at Ransomville around 
2018 (in prior years came through as race director as part of that series).  John walked through the roles 
and responsibliites of the race director, how calls are made, how the rules change or don’t change year 
in year out, and the differences between being a race director for a weekly setting and being a race 
director that travels around at different tracks each week.  
 
At the end of the interview, John also shared the story behind his nickname ‘Left Turn Johnny’, 
explaining that it came about as most of his neighbors in Lancaster were drag racers who used to joke 
and make fun of how with oval track racing (dirt and asphalt), everyone is always turning left. But he 
countered that sometimes he’d joke with those drag racers that a good night for them is only a few 
minutes on the track and all the warmup and prep they do, where with dirt it’s lot longer track time and 
that after a few hot laps around/practice laps, it’s all set to go.  
 
Post Interview 
 
After the interview, we wrapped up and talked for a bit, and I checked in with John if it was alright for 
me to pop into the tower some point in the night during a race to take some photographs of what the 
control center area of a track looks like during a race and he said for sure wouldn’t be a problem. So 
after chatting for a little more John went to go do his usual pre-race routine – as we ended around 5:45 
or so – and I went off to go make a few calls, and then popped over to say hi to April and see how she’s 
doing at the concession stand, before I went to go make a few calls: and also see about checking in with 
some other folks ahead of the race too.
