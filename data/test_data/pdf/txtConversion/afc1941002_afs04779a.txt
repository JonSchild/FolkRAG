END OF SIDE A
Endnote: The interviewer goes on to ask him what he said, and he says “I cussin' you out.” But
actually, Mr. George Johnson doesn't use any profanity. The basic translation of the passage is: I'm
not a child. I'm not waiting on [you (?)]. I don't know, I don't know, yes ??? . Which in slavery times
would most certainly have been considered impertinent and insubordinate, but it wasn't cursing. Mr.
George Johnson seems to be having a bit of a joke on the interviewer, using the Creole to express
some impertinence and resistant attitudes that don't at all come through in the English majority
Interview with Mr. George Johnson, Mound Bayou, Mississippi, September 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941002_000144
of his testimony. Whether this is indicative of some wider sociolinguistic trend or not would make
a fascinating research topic. We do know that in the 19th century, the Creole language was often
used for satire and expressing emotions that would have been socially unpermissible in either
International French or English.
