THIS LOG MADE FROM CASETTE DUB OF ORIGINAL TAPES. 
1st voice is Elke Dettmer; next voice is Karl Knorr. Discussion of 
hay technology, change to modern techniques, etc. 
During WW II, they developed hay stacker appendages--the "side gates"—which 
allowed two menfco do the work larger crews used to do. That is, side gates 
meant they "could pour it in without anybody on the stack." 
Work horses used ir)pld days. 
We look at family album pictures--theyare stacked in order that Marshall 
copies the next day. 
We look at the pictures: 
Uncle dressed in cowboy outfit— "wooly chaps and cuffs" etc. McKee Guyselman. 
Has a handgun. C. 1910 photo taken, at the ranch. "Angoras" other name for 
"wooly chaps;" bought at store. K K wore them, as did others in the family; 
best in cold weather. 
(Form 7/80/hwm-cf) 
2 
I ask for the history of chaps: 
Most guys wore woolies; also leather chaps for summer, warm weather. 
"Wing chaps"--snaps and rings. (Those are local term for what 
Nevada cowboys call "batwings") 
K K made own chaps out of elk hide (he killed and had tanned by a 
neighbor). Made from old pair's pattern he liked. Make one leg out 
of each half of the hide; close with snaps. 
Some decoration, not much; hung in the barn now (K K itill uses them). 
They don't wear short chaps here; never heard of "chinks" (Nevada type 
short chaps). 
What's the diff. bet. rancher and a cowboy? Work, etc. 
Ranchers started out as cowboys; still can cowboy. Cowboys worked for 
ranchers.... Hired men mostly. 
Cowboy came "from way back in the cattle drives, when they drove 'em up 
out of Texas, you know, these guys were cowboys." 
Cowboys are not necessarily ranchers, though. 
Other hands--hired hands do "general ranch work:" "irrig ate in the summer, 
then put up hay, and in the fall you have to gather your cattle and ship 
and so forth. Winter comes, why you feed the hay back out again to them. 
A guy that can do it all is the kind of guy you like to have, you know." 
= "ranch hand" 
Big ranchs hire specialists--just to be an "irrigator" or just to handle 
cattle. Maybe a mechanic. 
"All he does is chase water, you know." (Irrigator) 
Never used the term "buckaroo" in Colorado. Heard of the term. ‘ 
Buckaroo "is maybe another cowboy, maybe a little rougher than the 
average, I don't know." 
"Wrangler" — is a "horsebreaker" and works just with horses; on big ranches only. 
Pretty high status job--"not too many guys qualify for that, you know." 
But it is a rough job. 
"saddle horses" "saddle string" — the small gourp of horses ranchers have 
here in Colorado. Mostly small outfits here. 
Bill places also had special chore boys, swampers, etc. But not here. 
contd 
3 
We can't run cattle all year here—have to feed 3ix months. 
"This is not an easy country to raise cattle in, you know." Bee. of the 
climate, altitude, severe winters. Got to have enough hay to feed the 
cattle through the long winter. 
Hay stacks have to be fenced so "you can pasture your meadows without 
the cattle getting in to the haystack, you know." Then that's "fed 
back out again" in winter when the cows have grazed out the pasture 
(formerly hayfield). 
In spring--"you got forty jobs to do like yesterday, you know." Busy time. 
"It all hits you at once--you gotta fix your fences, you gotta drag your 
meadows and brand your calves and get your cattle where you want them." 
"Everything hits you at the same time." 
Branding: use a "chute" now. In corral. We also ear mark them, though 
it is not nec. anymore. We crop once on left ear. 
their mark used to be two ear marks: swallow fork or right ear and crop 
on left ear 
We don't wattle; some rancher do. Don't see it much today. 
"An earmark is handy because you can see it." (easier than brands in the 
fall and winter--when hair gets long on the cattle, etc. 
so brand 
ear mark both are important 
but wattle is not important 
Earmarks and wattles are registered, but they are not as binding as 
the registered brand. State brand board; brand inspecting done. 
No brand inspector anymore in Summit County (too few ranches today); Grand 
Co. has inspector, also Routt Co. Part-time job. 
"Brand" is the term, not "iron" etc. Don't keep neighbors' irons, bee. no 
need. Little mix-up here in this area. 
Brand April, May. No need for running iron today; used to use them, though. 
Circle shape — ring — running iron. Just an iron ring, and needed 
a set of tongs to hold the hot ring with. 
4 
Brands used to be kept, recorded by the countyrecorder. Not state does it. 
Cattlemen's association puts, out "brand books"'with history of the 
brands, ranches in Colorado. 
next picture: #2:/ stackinghay years ago. Method used till horses 
went out. 
"slide stacker" --no "gates" or "backstop" so man had to be on top 
of the stack to fork it around. 
"bench" of hay = the batch of hay bunched up by the buck rake that is 
pushed up over the stacker by the plunger 
in the pic: dad, brother, K K, a neighbor 
(see logs' 
pic. c. 1916 or 1917; George and Karl are small boys, 
taken at old meadow now under Green Mt. Reservoir 
next, #3:j bringing the hay in -- "sweep rake" / "buck rake" with "crazy 
wheels" (caster wheels).... 
offset axle, two wheels on back and two under th^buckhead" / "sweep" on 
the front, etc. Horses in big doubletree on back, so they pushed it 
forth. \ 
rigging^he lines difficult; turned like a caterpiller--a brake 
and a clutch.... 
dad called it a "bull rake" (also "buck rake," "sweep rake" etc.) 
They developed motorized buck rake using old car frame, engine. 
c. 1935 — Karl had heard about motorized buckrakes up in Wyoming or 
someplace like that.... 
"So we proceeded to build one." 1924 Dodge car used: 
take the bodyoff , turn the back end over (raise frame up), etc. Gear system 
reversed by simply turning it over. Turn seat around, steering wheel, etc. 
"It takes some mechanicin"1 — not too hard. 
Story about guy bit. one in Kremmling who didn't change the steering.... funny 
story....humorous anecdote....

"post card size" camera; actually 3% by 5" 
Corinne Guyselman Knorr -- the photographer (Karl Knorr's mother)(Mrs. William 
~ P.~ Knorr) 
~| #6^] "little George and KarV'picture by CGK with fish they've caught. C.1917. 
good fishing at beaver dams along the Blue River in the old days. 
"we hooked up a skim milk calf — broke him to drive." 
in cart with milk cow.... C. 1920. 
photo by CGK (Corinne Guyselman Knorr) 
George and Karl 
another early branding scene; no i.d. available 
Branding chutes came in c. 1925 or 30; pic. shows outside branding, old way. 
Chutes with "alley" and chute oruhe end now. 
"squeeze chute" / "branding chute" used today; modern ones tip the 
cow over for you and lay them flat in the squeezer apparatus 
branding now done fS^ing propane torch to heat the branding iron 
MAY: main branding time -- also earmark then, and innoculate cows with 
injection gun ("syringe") with trigger like a pistol. 
Most innoculation done for black malignant edema now. 
6 
Castrate at same time as branding, with knife; K K uses short blade 
(sheep foot blade good); "stockman's knife" style. 
K K likes medium size knife; Marshall shows him his, K K says that's the kind. 
TheyVeep the testicles and cook / eat them. "Rocky Mountain oysters." 
We also use "fries" term for Rocky Mt. oysters. 
"Rocky Mt. oysters" is a joking term, really. 
A special dish. You can buy them now in stores, too. 
SO: at spring branding - do these things: 
1. brand 
2. dehorn (with paste -- a caustic alkali) 
3. earmark 
4. wattle (if you wish) 
5. innoculate against disease 
Very busy time. Spring is the busiest season. 
Seasons: "Some guys say we got three—July, August, and winter!" 
Winter — maintain ranch, fix machinery. 
Spring: "Everything happens at once." 
"drag meadows" with EngQlish harrow--to help with fertilization. Spreads 
out the manure where the cattle were. 
"check fence" 
branding etc. 
get your ditches in shape (irrigation ditches in hay meadows) 
move cattle off into pastures onto the government "range" (Forest Service 
alottments and own private pastures) 
Have some BLM but mostly it's Forest Service now. 
"Blue Ridge alottment" is their BLM/Forest Sv. alottment -- across the 
reservoir. "Blue Ridge." 
Alottments just go to top of the hill. Timber on the other side. 
Lots of good grass in the sagebrush, and better even still in the aspens. 
June 1 is the usual date the Forest Service tells you to get started. It takes 
only a day to get the cattle around the dam (6 miles) to the "cow camp" and 
the Blue Ridge alottment. 
* was a "cow camp" over there; originally a big ranch owned it — 
where big ranch brought cattle JUST FOR THE SUMMER to graze. 
Some still use cow camps but most of us don't need them. 
("cow camp" shows up on old maps, just along present Colo. Hwy. 9 bet. 
hill and the reservoir....) Fenced, c. 40 acres. 
7 
local name is "the cow camp" 
We don't camp out anymore. Not necessary. Some do it just for the fun of it. 
"line camps" — only with the "big outfits" where they needed a string of 
diff. camps spread out 
after the cattle "turned out:" raise the next hay crop 
irrigation has been going since May 
We just get one hay crop; "we're lucky to get one!" 
lots of alfalfa used to be grown, still is 
used to try for two hay crops, but not worth the trouble (second crop 
so poor) 
big creeks here--good irrigation, good water 
We have very good water here. 
We're on Cataract Creek, Black Creek, and Otter Creek. 
--the three creeks Knorr Bros. Ranch has water rights on. 
They're "adj^icated rights" on basis of Col. water law; you can 
appropriate water rights and put it to "beneficial use," if it is not 
already being used or appropriated. 
1880s — date from their wtar rights on this ranch; first ditches. 
We also bought up other places AND the water rights at same time. Rights go 
with the property. 
Ditch building: the survey is the critical thing -- in{order for you to get 
just the right "drop" for the water to "run" by gravity where you want it to go. 
Tools: transit or level for the surveying work. CAN BE DONE with "pretty 
crude tools". Just a little transit is all you need. 
e.g., quarter-inch drop per half mile is a typical "drop" -- and that is 
"just a shade off of level" 
I 
You do the survey in reverse — look through the level at the water 
exit place at the field, and work back to the source. 
8 
Used to be a very hard job. I built them "the hard way" with "just a pick 
and shovel and dynamite." 
"This is big rock country." You hit big rocks so you have to blast 
them out. 
You go around the really huge ones, and leave them there. Today we 
just use a "cat" (caterpiller / bulldozer), and move most rocks. 
"Pick and shovel and bar" -- the rancher's main tools for moving rocks 
on a day to day basis, as needed in ordinary routine. 
K K nicely explains the glacial history of the region. "This is all glacier 
stuff." Ridges are irregular, rocky — "it's all glacier moraine." 
"Big bowls" of pure rock -- the loose rock washed down the creeks, the 
little side valleys into the bigger valleys and so on. 
Glacier passed through "and left it in the yard!" (all those loose but 
huge rocks) 
"It melted out" here into the valley. "The dirt's out here." 
bedrock up there, little stuff and the dirt washed down here 
In the meadows--"You hay what you can and miss what's too tough, you know." 
Can't do much with the huge, deep rocks. So the mowers just skim over 
them or go around, when cutting hay. 
Even if grass there, you better just stay out of it. 
August -- hay. 
- C080-HM-R3 dub.------ 
25 Aug 80 continued 
Discussion of the Doig house (log I house Dettmer and I recorded; see notes). 
K K going to fix it up, needs new roof etc. He and Jean might move over there 
after they retire, quite ranching. 
Be a nice retreat, etc. Need to build a road up there so can get in in summer. 
Little bldg, behind it (log also) a tool shed or something. 
* * roof — "just boards" — important to K K. Roof on the outbldg. "Theyjjust 
bend boards, you know--you got a log through the middle that's higher than the 
side, and you put boards over and bend them down and nail them and another board 
over the crack and you've got it made." 
it's just called a "board roof, I guess" 
I

1915 Saturday Evening Post as wallpaper, etc. 
Prob. bit. before 1915; DOIG had one hse. burn down. Then he built this one. 
Bit. before 1915. 
Log house — Doig house — has "dovetailed corners" in K K terminology. 
* He calls it dovetailing; says dovetailing does not have to have 
"a slant." ! 
Doig family all gone now; some old family members still live in Denver. 
Knorrs bought it and let the old man, Doig, stay there until he died. That 
was part of the sale deal. 
It's been vacant ca. 18 years. Spring behind house, in willows. No electricity. 
Used kerosene and gas lanterns; kerosene 1st, thdn gas in "modern times." 
"That's a typical log house, you know. Two rooms downstairs, two rooms up." 
"That was a pretty standard way to do it. Of course there were a lot 
of variations to that, but basically that was pretty good, you know." 
Doig house is 
"exactly" the same kind of house K K's uncle built. 
George Guysel man — a great-uncle (bro. of grandfather Judge Wm. A. Guyselman). 
He bit. quite a bit around here. 
Bit. the 1st hse on the place (now on ranch; was the old post office 
for VUtkeTafKh community etc.)

William P. Knorr — 
Came to USA at 18; 17 march to New York, so celebrated with the rest of 
the Irish! 
"He never forgot that, either, on the seventeenth of March, boy 
that was his, he, he helped the Irish on that day!"

"He did all the work on the first water rights in this country." 
Combination surveyer and lawyer. 
It's 10 O'clock.... getting ready to have the coffee.... 
"Like Ozark--I ozark ready when you are!" (K K) 
So take the break.... while we have coffee and "tannies" (brownies) 
Mrs. Knorr has made.... 
dad's house in Breckenridge "in the boom days." 
Before he came to the ranch. Could have bought the hse. for taxes at one 
time, and it recently sold for^!75,000! It is now a ski shop in Breckenridge, 
on the main street next to the bank. 
In Breckenridge and Montezuma before the ranch; came in about 1882 or 1883. 
Came to be a miner-and he and brother^had Knorr Brothers Pioneer Saloon. 
* K K shows us his "little tropy, a relic" -- tin match box with Knorr Bros. 
Pioneer Saloon printed on it. 
St. Bernard, "Duke" in the picture. Dog. 
Most of the early ranches were "out on the flats" in the early days -- 
Prairie Cattle Compnay, other "big outfits." 
Discussion of Centennial (James Michener historical novel) — they all like it. 
Because it is "accurate." In depiction of Colorado history. 
MIt fascianted me" bee. of the vast amount of research he had to do. 
In depiction of Colorado history. 
12 
#19/ another picture of the same house in Brkng. Also with dog. C. 1890 or 1900. 
The brother went over Delta and started farming when Prohibition came 
along; brother Knorr had bought out William P. K's interest in their saloon.... 
K K born in Denver, not on the ranch. No doctor up here at that time, so mom 
went to Denver on train (C & S from Dillon over Boreas Pass...and down). 
"Matter of fact I was born in Denver--but I only lived there two weeks!" 
train went out from Leadville in those days, then on around down to Denver 
William P. Knorr: (K K father) 
came straight from Germany, to the Gold Rush country, at age 18. 
* to join his uncle Christ Dei nst, who was mining there. 
"He came to get out of Germany, if you want to know the truth." To escape 
military draft, army duty. "This was the land of opportunity, you know." 
-C080-HM-R4 dub.-..LAST TAPE THIS EVENT 
"Free grass" here; that was attractive. 
ELKE DETTMER works through the interview report form with K K. 
"rancher" = occupation. But according to the IRS "your're a farmer!" 
K K doesn't mine being called a farmer. "Probably right." 
"This is ranch country. To me a farm is an agricultural set-up." Wheat, 
beets, a truck farmer, etc. 
Eastern Colorado--farmers fed cattle andalso raised crops. Lots of small 
operations; like to raise corn and feed own corn to own cattle, esp. in Iowa.... 
K K born Jan. 21, 1913. School in local country school that met in the summer. 
High school in Kremmling, then finished at Fort Collins. 
All of "grade school" in the summer; went for 8 months. 
No special church affiliation. 
Dad was Lutheran; mother was Methodist. 
Blue Valley Stock Growers Association -- important early organization; predates 
the state one. Mostly in Grand Co. now, since few ranchers left in Summit Co. 
Four yrs. high school, otherwise whole life spent here on the ranch. 
Travel, though—African big game hunting/safari, etc. 
Married 1948. Two daughters—one in Alaska.

Discussion of the brand book—and their brand (SEE NOTES). 
Lazy K Lazy W 
(their brand) 
A' 
Memorat/story: about the brand being applied, branding time: 
"An old cowboy that used to work around this country, somebody started 
to put that on backwards one time, turned the W the wrong way—and he 
said 'Don't do that, it'll catch in the sagebrush and tear off!'." (laughter) 
Old brands are worth money now, as collectors items—not nec. for actual 
use. Rich people buy them up, and use the brands on cattle just for 
for show. 
1 
Slash K Bar^/£ old brand they don't use much now, but keep registered. 
SEE NOTES 
It takes three "whacks" of the irons to apply. 
Father: William (Wilhelm) Peter Knorr. Family Bible is available (Knorr 
family) for reference.... 
"He was Wilhelm there but William here. Most of them called him Billy." 
We chat while eating "tannies" and having coffee. 
"You're not going to look up my family tree, are you? Might find a horse 
thief if you go back there far enough!" (laughter) 
"They used to hang them for horse thieves, you know." 
Other grandfather: William Armstrong Guyselman. From Warsaw, Indiana, to 
Missouri, to Leadville, to Breckenridge, to here. 
This was originally a placer claim. 
Got the ranch from a lawsuit—as payment for defending a guy; it was 
a placer claim. "Placer ditch" was built, etc. But nothing there. 
There is, though, some gold irial 1 these "gravel bar" but it's too 
"skimpy" to work out. ) 
14 
K K has old map, c. 1900, showing the area. 
"Lakeside" was name for the original community here--where original ranch 
was located. Post office at the ranch. Before Green Mountain Reservoir 
and dam built in 1940s, etc. 
McKee family in Missouri —still there -- father's wifes family. 
We get ready to leave. It's late.... Discussion turns to John Farr's 
folks—his father was president of Am. National Cattlemens Assoc. (Bill Farr). 
Bit operation, over by Greeley. Farr Farms. Feedlot. K K thinks highly 
of their outfit. 
K K has --c.300 cows and c. 6,000 acres. 
"From upper end of the Doig place down to the far end of the Stafford 
place down by Green Mountain. Spring Creek ("crik") Road." 
Hired man Allen (A1) Pullian lives there, at the old Stafford place. 
(SEE PHOTOS: I photographed Allen and father Dale Pullian mowing 
hay in meadow at Doig place) 
"Ole man Stafford was one of the old, early-day boys. You bet. Old Jimmy 
Stafford, old Irishman. Yeh." 
A wide, shortman --"But my god, the work he done—his hands, you know..." 
big old monstrous hands, and all stove up, you know, he'd walk 
a cane. And he'd get a big old stick, you know, and put her in front 
of him. Chewed this old twist tobacco, you know; he'd cut that up and 
put it in his pipe, you know, whittle him off some, you know. Old 
George and I used to take him fishing when we were kids, you know." 
"Jimmy Stafford. Quite a guy. He was a kind of a comical old cuss- 
had quite a sense of humor. 
"Ole uncle Jimmy Stafford." (K K inflects voice in mock-Irish dialect) 
From Ireland. "The old lady too." 
Most of people up here— Scandinavian setltment around Slate Creek (Swedes, and 
Norwegians, Danes). Hedin, Lund, Lind, Ferguson, Lindquist, Christiansen, 
etc. 
Norwegians over on the Williams Fork. Mostly Swedes on Slate Creek. 
15 
Had some Austrian neighbors, too. Daunce; Kumneg (sp?)- **Dad would 
talk the Austrian brand of German with them. 
"Swinehundout!"= "Pig-dog, get out of here!" 
(spelling wrong) 
"You see, I learned a little bit of German!" 
Folks (mom and dad) lived in original log house (RECORDED) while they 
were building the new log house.... 
The white house now across road--originally on the old ranch--it is actually 
three log houses put together.
