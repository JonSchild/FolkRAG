La Cruz and Helen Marie Moss
INTERVIEW LOG
PART 1: 00:03:33
00:00:00  Consents to interview. Olena Kryuchenko, lives in Beaverton, Oregon. Other jobs? In 
Kiev was chemical engineer.
00:01:22  I have been doing home care work for five years. I started with elderly female clients, 
one male client.  I now have a younger client, disabled after a car accident; and an older woman, 
also disabled in a car accident.
00:03:05  How decided to become a home care worker?  When I first came to this country I 
studied English at PCC [Portland Community College]. No work then, offered a job doing relief 
for another home care worker who could not work. (Process question from interpreter: should 
she translate simultaneously or wait for the answer, which slows down process?  She was 
instructed to wait for the answer so the audio recording would be clear.)
00:03:33 End of Part 1
PART 2:  00:25:57
00:00:00  (Interpreting the process question and answer)
00:00:50  Anything else on how you got started?  No, started working in home care, just like any 
other job, rewarding.  
00:01:35 How is it different?  Responsible for many things.  I am everything to them.
00:02:19  Special skills? You have to have a special talent, like a singer has to have a good 
singing voice.  Very important to love people, need to be very punctual and exact - I am never 
late!  Have to be hard worker.

00:03:15  How did you learn?  We went to a training, the one that is held in this office.  Grateful 
for this training, I would not have known otherwise, not even where to look.
00:04:10  Typical day? My schedule is so set out I could tell you what I am doing right down to 
the minute! Used to write it in a diary, then I see my days don't change at all.  Describes typical 
day. Client lives with parents, so they cook.  I help him with exercises, spend lots of time playing
cards and dominoes.  Never TV, but he likes music so I play piano for him.  Some personal care 
but my job is to be with him every second, not cooking or cleaning. Thanks to him, I am learning
English!  Speech is slow, so I learn.  This client does not speak any Russian.
00:07:53  Do you feel close to clients? Yes, and there is no other way.  Have to feel close with 
the person.  Does this cause tension when go home?  No, I see them everyday.  Hard to set 
boundaries?  Do they call you? No, I never have that.
00:09:30  Intimate tasks? Yes, first time with a male client.  I had a personal barrier for the first 
time. I would have really liked some information or training then, but none available.  Life itself 
sorts things out.  Personal philosophy is that we all need care.
00:11:10  Good story?- She was asked to substitute for another person, difficult because of 
language barriers, so only there for ten days, but trying really hard.  Frail, elderly woman with 
cat, the only family she had.  One month later, I was called and told that the woman had died, 
and that the cat would be taken to the shelter.  Of course, I went and got the cat. Family jokes 
that she needs to pick clients with no pets.
00:13:39  Friends who are home care workers? No - all my family members have an education, 
they do other work - only in trainings do I meet other home care workers.
00:14:26  What do you talk about? Maybe how lucky you are with client, or how difficult it is 
because they are so sick.
00:15:21  Is humor important in this job? Yes. I try to have a smile on my face, bring something 
good to the family, workplace.
00:16:23  Most rewarding? Knowing clients are well taken care of.
00:17:22  Most challenging? There are difficulties.  Working with elderly, end of life coming, 
some depression; or with younger people, dealing with big challenges, they can be negative.
 
00:19:00  Union? Very happy in union, in the last five years I have received so much help.  
Training, health care, 2 salary raises.  There is a language barrier - I wish I could do more in 
union.
2
00:20:00  Lobby days? No. Would you want to? Yes, but to do that need to know language.
00:21:07  Anything you want to tell? Hard work.  Not always physically, but emotionally, when a
client dies it is like a part of you dies.
00:22:05  Example of a gentleman she took care of who died, she still visits his grave.  Special 
person, WWII vet.  I brought my grandchildren to listen to him and they were very interested.
00:23:00  Other interests?  I love my family, two dogs, two cats.  We walk a lot, go to coast.
00:24:12  You seem passionate about what you do. How many years doing this work?  5 years.  
How long in US? 5 years. In your work, connect with broader Russian community?
  
00:25:00  Lots of family is here - don't have time for more.
00:25:33  Anything else? Probably not - grateful that you are interested, it is a very interesting 
job.
00:25:57 End of interview.
