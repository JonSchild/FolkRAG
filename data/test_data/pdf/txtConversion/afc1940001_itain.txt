It Ain't Goona Rain no MoreThe bull frog sat on a lily padLookin' up at the sky.The lily pad sunk
and the frog fall in,Got water all in his eye.It ain't gonna rain no more, no more,It ain't gonna rain
no more.How in the heck will I wash my neckIf it ain't goona rain no more!Oh, I went to see my
Susan,And she met me at the door,Shoes and stockings in her hand,And feet all over the floor.It ain't
gonna rain no more, no more,It ain't gonna rain no more.How in the heck will I wash my neckIf it
ain't gonna rain no more!Where Mary went to school one day,Her teacher's name was Bill,He always
rode that [piebald?] horse,And made poor Mary ill. *
