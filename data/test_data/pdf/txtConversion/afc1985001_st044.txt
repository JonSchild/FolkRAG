I Come in the Other Night
I COME IN THE OTHER NIGHT 4107 20B1
Ernie Alston Shafter, 1940
I come in the other night Drunk as I could be There stood a horse in my stable Where my
horse ought to be.
Now, my wife, my darling wife Explain yourself to me How come this horse in my stable
Where my horse ought to be?
You blind fool, you crazy fool Can't you never see That's just a milk cow My granny gave
to me.
I've traveled this wide world over I've been from shore to shore But I never saw a milk cow
With a saddle on before.
Now I come in the other night Drunk as I could be There stood a hat on my hat-rack Where
my hat ought to be.
Now, my wife, my darling wife Explain yourself to me How come this hat on my hat-rack
Where my hat ought to be?
You blind fool, you crazy fool Can't you never see That's just a fryin' pan My granny gave
to me.
I've traveled this wide world over I've been from shore to shore But a sweat-band on a
fryin' pan I never saw before.

I come in the other night Drunk as I could be There laid a head on my piller Where my
head ought to be.
I COME IN THE OTHER NIGHT
Now, my wife, my darling wife Explain yourself to me How come this head on my piller
Where my head ought to be?
You blind fool, you crazy fool, Can't you never see That's just a cabbage head My granny
gave to me.
I've traveled this wide world over I've been from shore to shore But whiskers on a cabbage
head I never saw before.
