Unidentified Man: Well, that's so, too, but they've been flying relays, you see. Unloading and going
back and reloading and coming again, you see.
Unidentified Man: And before they could hardly find out where it's coming from though, you see. He
get in the first blow on a man you know. There's a surprise why, he's upset pretty well.
Unidentified Man: It'll last a little while, but they're going to — it won't last very long. It's kind of like
you're smacking a fella and then you laid into him, you know, directly. We can take that thing over.
Unidentified Man: He doesn't have to lick them before breakfast. They can take as long as they
want ???.
Unidentified Man: One thing we can do, we can lick them if it takes ten years because we can build
more in thirty days than they can build in twelve months as far as that part goes.
Unidentified Man: And I'll be glad when I hear them getting over to China with one of those big
bombers.
Unidentified Man: The thing I want to know — the thing that's going to do me most good is to know
that when Tokyo is set afire just like a brush fire all over, and that's what's going to happen. It's bad
for the average . . . Jap. In other words, the type who, the class of folks who don't care about fighting.
They are forced to it, by the army of course. But good gracious alive. It won't be like Germany
bombing England. When they get this thing started right there's going to a fire like nobody's ever
heard tell of it. I don't care if they burn them, and there've always been classes of a brown or yellow
class of folks, but when they get through the scorching for this, boy they'll all be brown. That's what
I want. And to show you how the folks have reacted to it, the doggone recruiting stations can't be
waited on today.
Unidentified Man: I think that . . . ninety percent of the men in America would pick up a gun and
grasp them today if they were ever asked to.
Unidentified Man: Why sure [and who wouldn't (?)].
Unidentified Man: An old man that I saw for a long time this morning. He was an older man than I
am and he said that he'd be going tomorrow, be glad to go. He said, “I can stand anything they can

put on me over there as long as [I'm living (?)] with those other guys.” [laughter] Take anything that
comes up. Sleeping in the trenches, walking in the rain, anything that's necessary to do just to kill just
a half a dozen of them.
Unidentified Man: Well, that's what's going to happen.
Unidentified Man: Don't spare them anything. There's no need of talking about mercy, that's a thing
of the past. Now if you get stuck in the back, we've been stabbed in the back. They couldn't kill us ???
just stabbed us, and now is the time to —
Unidentified Man: What I noticed — I noticed in the paper tonight there's a ad in the ??? union was
talking about striking.
Unidentified Man: Mm hmm [affirmative].
Unidentified Man: Well can they — if there's a strike why, now it would be treason, wouldn't it?
Unidentified Man: Yeah, they can't strike. They won't let them strike. The striking business is over
with 'cause of now.
Unidentified Man: No, a man has —
Unidentified Man: I'll tell you what I believe we'll do, what I believe we'll do. I believe that our
production will build up in sixty days time to take — the production over and above today will take
care of what our losses will be in Japan. And the present setup will go ahead and take care of things
like it is. I believe that the American people will see to it.
Unidentified Man: They ought to take whatever they need to win that war and win it in a hurry.
Whether they use them here or use them there. Anybody, put them where they need them, in a gun
factory or munitions factory or anywhere else. Any man, any age. Let everything else go and beat the
hell out of Japan first and then come back and tell them they can work at home after.
Unidentified Man: Well, the other thing is about after we get through Japan then we just have to help
England and Russia clean those damn Germans out.
Unidentified Man: [So they all over there (?)]
Unidentified Man: They might as well have declared war on the whole bunch at one time.

Unidentified Man: Well, I . . . the Tokyo government is just a mouthpiece for Hitler anyway so after all
when you fight one you're fighting the whole damn works.
Unidentified Man: Yeah.
Unidentified Man: And I don't believe it'll be, I don't believe it'll be forty-eight hours till there'll be a
declaration of war against General Hitler.
Unidentified Man: Well I think they'll declare war on us in less than that time.
Unidentified Man: Well it's predicted. Tonight's report, for example, is predicted that it will have to
come in twenty-four to thirty-six hours.
Unidentified Man: Well Hitler has never declared war on anybody yet. That isn't his policy. No, I don't
what — there's no difference, he just goes in a nation and for some reason or other says he's got to
have that country, or — he never had declared war on Russia or any of the countries he's taken over
there. He just marched in and took them by surprise, like Japan ??? took here.
Unidentified Man: He's just so damn big ???.
Unidentified Man: Well it ain't no need — but nobody about to tell me that Hitler can take the
remnants that's left in Italy which ain't nothing. That wouldn't make us a ??? and Japan, that's all he's
got. And whip the rest of the world, that's out of the question.
