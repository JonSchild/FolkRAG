"There's hard times on old [Bister?] CreekThat never can be beat;It was root hog or dieUnder every
wagon sheet.We cleared up all the Indians,Drank all the alkali,And it's whack the cattle on, boys,Root,
hog, or die."Oh, I'm going homeBullwhacking to spurn;I ain't got a nickelAnd I don't give a dern.'Tis
when I meet a pretty girl,You bet I will or try,I'll make her my little wife,Root, hog, or die."
