Interview with Carl Jenkins, afc2016037_04060 
August 16, 2017 
Interviewed at Jenkins Funeral Home and Cremation Service, Newton, North Carolina, 
by Sarah Bryan for Folklife of the Funeral Services Profession 
Sarah Bryan: For the recording, let me ask you to introduce yourself and let me know 
where we are. 
Carl Jenkins: My name is Carl Jenkins, and Fm the owner of Jenkins Funeral Home and 
Cremation Service in Newton, North Carolina. 
SB: Just before the recording started we were, you were starting to tell me about 
your first experience with the funeral services profession. 
CJ: How I became involved and my influences. When I was 16 — this was in 1974 — 
my father passed away. He had had some heart issues prior to that, and died of a heart 
attack. And it was on Christmas Eve, ironically. The funeral director came to my house, 
and that's the first time I knew what their role was all about. But I was able to see first¬ 
hand what he was able to do in that setting. And my mom was lying on the sofa in our 
den. I sat across the room when he came in. I could see in the distance a few folks 
coming into our home, bringing in food, and they wanted to see my mom of course. 
And I saw them kind of put their hand up on the mouth and say, "Oh, okay. I'll be 
quiet," because they saw her lying on the sofa and somebody in the kitchen said where 
she was, and they would just say, "Okay, I'll see her later." So she's on the sofa, 
grieving. I'm in the chair across the room. I'm watching this happen. And this funeral 
director, his name was Gene Freeman, he walked in, and they showed him into the 
room where she was. He knelt down, held her hand, and what I call sprinkled magic 
dust over her. I don't know any other way to describe it, because that's what it seemed 
like to a 16-year-old at the time. When he rose up, she got up as well, and started 
smiling and greeting her guests. And I'm sitting there thinking, "What—wow—what 
just happened?" And it still brings chills to my arms when I think about that. But it was 
just a neat experience. I thought, "That's pretty cool. Maybe I should check into that." 
Because I was 16, looking for something, didn't know what I was going to do career- 
wise. In the 11th grade a lot of my friends were writing off to schools, and getting 
acceptance letters. I hadn't even started. So, that made a lot of sense to me, to check into 
something like that. A real short story about that too, with Gene Freeman. Fast-forward 
a few years, I owned another funeral home, one of the sales reps came by, he said, 
"Gene has had a heart attack. Did you hear about that?" I said, "No, I hadn't." "You 
need to call him." I told him what an influence he was on my life, he says, "You need to 
call him." So I called him, and I got his wife on the phone, and I told her who I was and 
why I was calling, and she started crying. And so, she says, but "He's resting now, but I 
beg you to call him back. Please do." She gave me the time to call, and I did. And when 
I called him, he started crying, after I told him who I was. And so we had a nice 
conversation, he thanked me and we hung up. So fast-forward a number of years later 
to 2005, my brother's wife died in Fayetteville, and here I am three hours away, he 
wants me to handle the service. So I had her body picked up, and already had her 
casket selected — pre-selected, because she had cancer, and we were able to talk about 
some things ahead of time. So I drove a van down with the casket, and my wife and I 
helped with the service, and I told the funeral director that was at Sullivan's in 
Fayetteville that I'm going to need some help. They're the ones who picked up the 
body, and did the embalming for us. So I said, "I need some help. Do you have any 
part-timers that you could lend me? I'd pay them to help me out with the service, 
because I'm out of my area, and I need some help." I rented a hearse and rented a limo. 
He said, "Well, I've got So-and-So, I've got So-and-So, and I've got Gene Freeman." I 
said, "Are you kidding me? Gene Freeman is one of your part-timers?" He'd retired by 
then, he was in his eighties. And I said, "I want Gene." He gave me his phone number, 
and I called him up and reminded him who I was. He said, "Carl, I'd love to help you." 
So I was able to really kind of come full-circle. I was able to work with the guy that 
influenced me into funeral service. And it was just a really neat experience. 
[00:05:00] And ironically, it turns out they're the same age. 
SB: That's a wonderful story. 
CJ: Thank you. 
SB: I've been so struck by how funeral directors seem to have a brotherhood and 
sisterhood, that it really seems to be a supporting community, like the group that you 
were talking about. 
CJ: Right. Right. There is a North Carolina association, there's the national 
association, neither of which I belong. At one time I did, when I was in another funeral 
home. I actually was a district director over our District 10, which meant I would be on 
the board of directors of the state association. That was a great experience, and there 
was that support. You know, you got to meet a lot of folks, go to conventions, and you 
know, you really have some camaraderie and fellowship, and at the same time, make 
lifetime friends. But I don't belong to that anymore. It's quite expensive. I didn't really 
see the value in it, versus the expense of it. So I didn't join, but I have missed out on 
some of that benefit of camaraderie. And so that's why the study group is important to 
me. 
SB: Well, going back to this first experience, prior to your father's passing, what had 
your impressions of funerals and the world of funeral services been, do you think? 
CJ: Yeah. I only recall maybe two other instances in my life when I had attended 
funerals prior to that. One was when I was probably three years old, and one of my 
little friends passed away. And I don't even know, I couldn't tell you his name now or I 
couldn't tell you what he died of. It was a disease that took his life. I remember seeing 
him in the casket, and it was a small casket. I mean, it was full-couch, so you could see 
his feet. I remember asking my mom why he just had his socks on and no shoes. And 
she held me up to view him in the casket. So that was one experience, and another was 
when my grandfather died—he was in South Carolina and we drove there. You know, I 
wasn't very impressionable, really. I never really dreamed that I would be in the funeral 
profession, so it didn't really have any kind of impact on me at all, those experiences. 
And it's not something that I would seek, or that I sought after, or that was a passion in 
my early life—until I met Gene Freeman, and then it became a passion. So. He was 
great. 
SB: What was it in that moment that Mr. Freeman was counseling your mother, what 
was it about that — ? 
CJ: My dad told me, throughout my life, "Son, whatever you choose to do in life, be 
a professional at it, and do your best." But that word, professional, kept sticking in my 
mind. I think he meant be a doctor, but that's not what I wanted to be. (Laughs) When I 
would think about that, when I met Gene Freeman at an early age, it just sort of clicked, 
because he was the epitome, in my opinion, of a professional. So that was probably the 
greatest influence. A side story of that was a time—I forgot to tell you—was around the 
time of the 11th grade, I looked for a part-time job in the summer and on into the school 
year, and I just happened to find a job delivering flowers, at a florist. And so it 
connected real well into the funeral business. And little did I know at the time that you 
would, a florist would schedule all the funeral flowers at one time, at the end of the day, 
so they would be fresh for the visitation from seven to nine. You wouldn't want to take, 
make several deliveries during the day, you'd take them all at once. So I would take 
deliveries around four or five o'clock at each funeral home. As we were taking—I 
remember one funeral home in particular, it ended up being the one that I worked for — 
had a flower room that you would take them into. It had a sofa, TV, and a little bit of a 
lounge-like atmosphere. And I was passing by all of the Cadillacs parked in the parking 
lot, placing the flowers in the flower room, watching the funeral directors, saying hello 
to them. They're in their suits, they're watching TV. 
[00:10:00] And I'm like, "Yeah, that's the job for me. Right there. I like that." Little 
did I know, they'd been up all night embalming, and dressing bodies, and going on 
death calls, and very little sleep. They'd worked funerals all day, in the heat and the 
snow, and this was the time of day when they could just relax for a few minutes and get 
ready for the visitation to start at seven o'clock. (Laughs) I was in for a big surprise. 
SB: Their one moment of down-time. 
CJ: 
Right. 
[Pause in recording] 
SB: You said your grandfather was in South Carolina. What part of South Carolina? 
CJ: It was Conway. 
SB: Conway, okay! I'm from Myrtle Beach originally. 
[Chatting about Horry County, SC, genealogy, comparing notes about each other's 
relatives.] 
SB: So then after you developed an interest in this profession, what was the next 
step? 
CJ: Graduating from high school, and then seek out a mortuary school. Decide 
which path to take, whether to serve an internship first or to get the training through 
school. It so happened that around the same time, in my hometown of Fayetteville, they 
opened a mortuary school at the technical college. And so I thought, you know, "This is 
just meant to be." So I enrolled in the college, the funeral service education program. 
And I kept telling myself, "I can always transfer to another curriculum if I need to, if for 
some reason this doesn't work out, or if I just don't feel that I can stomach it." Because I 
had told myself that the first thing I see an embalming process I was probably going to 
throw up, but then I'll get over it and I'll be okay. But I didn't. (Laughs) So that was the 
next step. Enrolling into the mortuary program at Fayetteville. And that was a two-year 
Associate Degree program. And beyond that I went to Methodist College, and ended 
up with a Bachelor degree in psychology at North Carolina Wesleyan College in Rocky 
Mount. 
SB: Are there many funeral directors who've studied psychology? 
CJ: I really, I don't think so, but I don't know for sure. A lot of my friends are, do 
have a Bachelor degree, which is not required, but many do. But many don't. 
SB: It seems like that would be a great asset in your work, to have that background. 
CJ: I think so. Yeah. I think any—psychology or not, any kind of four-year degree 
would be beneficial. I think it just helps to make you a little more well-rounded, learn 
about a lot of different kinds of things. Gives you time to grow up before you go into 
business! 
SB: You mentioned the, maybe, anxiety that you had before seeing an embalming. 
I'm interested in that aspect of funeral directors' experiences, because, you know, it 
seems like we're all born with a sort of natural fear of dead bodies, or, you know, 
avoidance of death, but especially of like the clinical fact of a dead body. How do 
people in this field get past that? Or are many people born without that fear? 
CJ: Hmm. Good question. It really didn't affect me like I thought it was going to, the 
first time I saw it. I think the main thing is, when I started working at the funeral home, 
soon after I enrolled in the curriculum, I was asked by one of the local funeral homes 
came by the school and said, "Do you have any students you could recommend? 
Because I have a vacancy at the apartment, to live in the apartment, answer the phone at 
night and go on death calls." 
[00:15:07] And so I was chosen to do that, and I was grateful for it. Where was I 
going with that? 
SB: Oh, about fear and aversion. 
CJ: So, oh, that's right. So when, my first day on the job, one of the gentlemen was 
taking me around, showing me all the rooms, and we walked right into the embalming 
room like it was nothing, and there was the embalming process going on, there were 
two embalmers there working on a body, they were flexing and bending and, you 
know, working, massaging the tissue and all the things that you're supposed to do. And 
I'm looking at that and I'm thinking, "Hm, that's not so bad." The main thing I thought 
of, though, was, "I'm not supposed to be in here." I thought for some reason I wasn't 
allowed in there, but he was taking me in anyway. And I'm thinking, "I hope nobody 
catches me in here!" So that was the fear that I had, more so than the fear of any 
physiological functions. 
SB: Was that—weren't supposed to be there like in a legal sense, or the rules, or 
propriety? 
CJ: Right. I just didn't know. I was so young and so new to it, I just didn't know. I 
felt like that was a no-no to be in there, watching this body being embalmed, and I 
didn't know them, and they didn't know me. Since I've learned that you're not 
supposed to be in there unless you're a student or a registered apprentice or, you know. 
SB: So let's see, so this was at Fayetteville Tech. 
CJ: Right. 
SB: And then when you finished school, what did you do next? 
CJ: Well, I was already employed by this particular firm in Fayetteville, and I 
continued on with them, I finished my internship and got my funeral service license. 
Continued working there for a period of time, and then, I think at age 21,1 got married. 
Doing all the things that most people do, you know. You're starting your career, 
starting your life, with a wife, and thinking about starting a family at some point in 
time, and buying a home and those kinds of things. But I just wasn't making enough 
money to do that. I didn't feel that this place was providing me with the proper income 
to create that. So I started looking around to see what was out there, and found a place 
to move to, and seek employment elsewhere, at another funeral home. And everywhere 
that I've ever gone has always been kind of a stepping stone — with more funds, and 
more experience, different experience, because each firm is different, each locality is 
different. Each town is different, the people are different. All the places you go are 
different. But it was, each of those were a stepping stone for my career. 
SB: Were these mostly in North Carolina? 
CJ: All of them were in North Carolina. I'm North Carolina-licensed, so I didn't seek 
elsewhere. When you go to conventions and you meet a lot of funeral directors all 
across the state, it's a North Carolina convention, so you're going to meet all the North 
Carolina firms and owners and workers. So you get to know some of those folks, and 
then you think—you get offers occasionally when you're at a convention, like, "Hey, if 
you ever want to make a change. I'd like to talk to you," that kind of thing. So I had 
some contacts already that I could make. 
SB: And how have you found working in different parts of the state? Let's say here 
in—is this Catawba County? 
CJ: It is. 
SB: Okay. Rather than Fayetteville. How have you found that, say, culturally 
different? If at all. 
CJ: Um, not a lot of difference. You, I guess you make the best of whatever situation 
that you're in. But some things that I've learned, and it's hard to think back now, 
because I've been here so long — but I remember, I went to Statesville first, and then to 
Hickory, and then now Newton. One of the things that I noticed that they do here that 
they didn't do in Fayetteville is they put out road signs, "Slow, Funeral" signs. I 
thought that was odd. Why would you want to do that? Nobody's going to really slow 
down—I didn't think. And you're just identifying the house or the neighborhood. And 
the other thing they do is they have, they print what they call memorial folders in the 
western part of the state. We didn't do that in the eastern part of the state. 
[00:20:00] So it's another detail, another task. Maybe another service, for sure. We do 
bulletins now instead of the memorial folders. People expect that. Another difference 
that I've noticed in the west, as opposed to the east, is the funeral lines, the visitation 
lines. You go to the bank, you go to the grocery store, any retail establishment, you're 
going to stand in line to pay, or a restaurant, you'll stand in line to pay. And nobody 
likes lines. At a visitation, I noticed the lines were very lengthy, and I thought, "Wow, 
why do you do that? Nobody likes lines. Why do you do that?" It's like a wedding 
reception line. And that's the only place I've ever seen that. But that's how they do it 
here. And I think that I came to the conclusion that it's the facility, that maybe that's 
why, that maybe they don't have the space in certain facilities, so they have to do a line, 
because they don't have a big room like the one we're in now where you can be free, 
and then go to the person you want to speak to, and then leave. But in eastern North 
Carolina at the funeral homes there, that's what we did. They had big rooms, the body 
was in the casket, the flowers were all around. And the room was decorated with 
flowers, it wasn't just all grouped up where the casket was. But you could be anywhere 
in the room, and then people would come in and speak, and then they would leave. 
And they didn't have to stand in line to see every single member of the family. When I 
go to another funeral home, if someone chooses elsewhere and I go visit them in the 
visitation, I only know one person in the family, typically, but I've got to speak to 25 or 
30 people. You're shaking hands with each one down the line, you're like, ah—what do 
you say? "I'm Carl Jenkins. I'm a friend of Joe's." And they don't know what to say. I 
just think it's awkward. But that's what we do. We've tried to do it differently here, and 
do that mingling concept. People will come in and say, "Where's the line?" I'd say, 
"There is no line. The family has chosen just to mingle." And they're just—you can see 
the look on their face. They're just so confused. They want a line. (Laughs) They want to 
get in that line! 
SB: That is exactly the experience—I mean, you and I are from the same part of the 
Carolinas, more or less, and I grew up with exactly that, the mingling. And a few 
months ago a relative of mine from the Piedmont died1, and I went to her funeral, and 
there was a line — and, "What are they doing? Is this a wedding?" And I—yeah, I felt so 
awkward. I didn't know. 
CJ: I'm very used to it now, because that's what we do all the time. If you don't do it, 
people complain. I had one—well, several people—tell me how chaotic it was. (Laughs) 
Okay. I didn't think so, but okay. You go and talk to the person that you came to see, 
and then you leave. You don't have all this huge mass of people in your building at 
once. They come and go. It's so easy. 
SB: Yeah. One person's chaos is another person's order. 
CJ: Exactly. 
1 A November 2016 service for a 100-year-old woman, held at a funeral home in Star, North 
Carolina (Montgomery County). 
SB: What about—let's see, I mentioned that I wanted to ask you about the Hmong 
communities here. What about other cultures, whose, you know, families you serve? 
CJ: Well, we serve anybody that asks us to serve them, obviously, as any funeral 
home would. Here at Jenkins we have served the African American community, we've 
served Hispanics, and then of course the Hmong community. We're still predominantly 
white, but we're starting to see a little bit of a trend where we're serving more black 
families. And I don't really know the reason. Maybe it's because one family chooses us, 
and then their relatives want to use us too because they like the way we do things. 
Whatever. It could be facility, it could be cost. I don't know. But yeah. There's a mix, for 
sure. 
SB: And how is the experience, in terms of your work, different from one culture to 
the next? 
CJ: Um, in a Caucasian or white family, it's typically a 30-minute service, an hour 
service. So the length of the time that they would actually have a ceremony would 
actually be longer with the African American community. Hispanic is a lot longer as 
well. 
[00:25:00] They like to, whether it's Catholic or Protestant, they want to be here all 
day. They want to be here all day, and they want to just be here, and not do anything, 
but just be on premises and just support one another. And with the Hmong community, 
they'll be here all weekend. And so it's very different. And it's different how we charge 
for that too, because we don't really charge by the hour, but we do have to be 
compensated for the facility and our time and our labor. It's different. With the Hmong 
community, it's not only all weekend but it's all night too. For the traditional Hmong— 
there's two sections of Hmong families here. There's the Christian Hmong, and then 
there's the traditional Hmong. Traditional are more ancestral worshippers. Christian 
Hmong, obviously, worship Christ. So with the Christian Hmong it's a shorter time that 
they're here. They might be here a Saturday at given times, with a break in between, 
and then on Sunday they'll have their—their whole church will come in and have their 
worship service at the funeral home, in our chapel, instead of having it at their church 
that day. And then after that they'll have a little more ceremony, and then we'll go to 
the burial. With the traditional Hmong, we'll be here from Friday at eight AM until 
Sunday at noon or one or two, and have the burial. And what they do during all that 
period of time is very different from what the Christian Hmong do. 
SB: And what sort of things are those? 
CJ: I knew you'd ask that. 
SB: 
Is there a shaman involved? 
CJ: Um, sometimes. And every family, every ceremony that I've — and we've had 
many, many, many—but they're all very different in certain ways. They're all very 
similar in a lot of ways. But some of the differences are I've seen them tie a string to the 
deceased's finger and they'll bring it all the way outside to a box where a chicken will 
be, and they'll tie that string to the chicken. There's some significance about the soul. 
And what they want to do all that time, is they—depending on the age of the person, if 
it's an older person, they're here to tell the story of that person's life, from the womb all 
the way to the death. Older person, they would be here longer, obviously. So there's 
chanting, there's the beating of the drum, there's the playing of the flute. There's 
announcements, there's food. They cook here, every meal, they serve everybody. If the 
person is more prominent in their Hmong community, they'll kill more cows. If less 
prominent, less cows. They feel like they have to serve everybody who comes in and 
honors them with their presence. They'll also, what I call pay at the door. They pay cash 
to — there'll generally be someone taking donations, taking money. Those 
denominations of bills are usually hundred-dollar bills. They'll schedule a funeral out 
three weeks out, somehmes a month out, depending on the prominence of the person. 
They want the people in Fresno, California, and Wisconsin, and Minneapolis, to be able 
to have the opportunity to make plans to be here. If you walk in the parking lot and see 
all the license plates, you'll see California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, all over the place. 
SB: People are actually driving from — 
CJ: Mostly Toyotas too, ironically. (Laughs) Nissans and Toyotas. Very few 
American-made vehicles, which is interesting. Just an observation. But they want to 
give them plenty of time to make their, to get here, out of respect, obviously, but the 
other thing is they want them to — they want the more guests to be here so they can 
have more funds to pay for all the activities. The activities that we see from Friday to 
Sunday is just a minute portion of that. In the three weeks preceding that, from the 
death to the time of, the weekend of the ceremony, they'll have feasting at their homes, 
they'll set up tents at their homes, there's a lot of planning involved, they get someone 
to do the —the shaman? They'll have that person, they have to pay that person, they'll 
have someone to play the flute, and they have to line up — there's not that many people 
in the culture that do that, so they have to schedule a person. He may be scheduled 
every weekend at various places in the United States. Very interesting. 
[00:30:00] SB: Very interesting, yeah. Now, in those three weeks, has the deceased 
person been cremated, embalmed and waiting for the service? 
CJ: They don't cremate. It's very traditional. A person will be embalmed by us. We 
have an on-site cooler, refrigeration unit. We'll place the person in the refrigeration all 
that time. It's very important for that. And the other thing, we'll place what we call 
massage cream, funeral directors call it massage cream but it's actually, it's a lotion, it's 
a moisturizing cream that we apply very heavily on the face and hands. Keeping a body 
out that long would typically cause dehydration, particularly in a refrigeration unit, so 
the moisturizing is a very, very important aspect of that. The type of embalming fluid is 
also very important that we choose. We've kind of perfected that. It's probably little- 
known around the country, the type of fluid that we use, because we're one of the very 
few funeral homes that serves the Hmong culture, so, where they would have a need to 
keep the body for three weeks, to develop this particular kind of fluid for that. And it's 
one that has — in the embalming process fluids are rated by index, and the higher the 
index, the stronger the fluid. So in the case, it would fix the tissue faster, and keep it 
preserved for a longer period of time. But there's a problem with that. It dehydrates. 
And that's the other negative that we don't want to happen. So we have to have another 
component of that mixture, that solution, and that's called a humectant. And when 
that's placed inside there—there are very few strong fluids that have humectant. 
Usually it's one or the other. So we've found a company that has this chemical. We've 
researched it and found that this really works best for us — in most cases. I'd say 90 
percent of the time. Unless there's some other variable that we're not aware of, some 
medicines that the person was taking, or some obesity situation, or traumatic accident 
or something like that. Normal cases, 90 percent of the time that works really well. 
Along with the other moisturizing and refrigeration. Those three components help us to 
preserve that body for a longer period of time and make them look as natural as 
possible. 
SB: Now, this is something that was developed by a company? 
CJ: Correct. 
SB: This is not a formula that you've developed here. 
CJ: No, no. 
SB: Would that have come from, like, military use? Would that have been from 
sending soldiers home? How would they have come upon that formula? 
CJ: The need, for many reasons, I suppose. Since the Hmong people have been in 
this country. I'm sure I'm not the only one that's ever asked them this question, 
"Provide something to me, or give me some idea about what I can do to — Because 
here's my problem. Help me solve my problem." And Dodge Chemical Company in 
Massachusetts has stepped up to the plate and provided this fluid. Now, whether it was 
developed specifically for the Hmong culture, I doubt it. There's probably many other 
uses. But it sure works well for us. 
SB: That's very interesting, wow. Now, in terms of the service, you mentioned the 
string, which I'd never heard of—that's amazing—and the chicken. You also mentioned 
the killing of cows. Is that— And I know sacrifice can be part of their rituals. Is that 
something that's —like, what are the legalities? Is that something that's done off-site? 
CJ: It is. (Laughs) Yes. It's definitely done off-site. I witnessed the live chicken in the 
box, and I sort of cringe a bit when I see that because I'm like, "Uhh, I hope no other 
family members from other families that we're serving see that." I have seen a live pig 
here on the back of a pickup truck before, in the parking lot. You're walking by and you 
hear it squealing, you're like, "Whoa, what's that?" But it's not here long, and I've seen 
a trailer with cows on it, and I'm like—it kind of got me started a little bit, because I'm 
thinking, "I hope they know they're not going to —they don't have permission to kill 
that cow on our premises." And I think it's, for whatever reason it was here, I don't 
know, but it's generally known throughout the Hmong community, those that use us 
know how we operate, and they're very respectful of our premises. 
[00:35:02] They know that we don't want that killing of the cow or any pig or any 
livestock on our—you know, that's not done here. There was a time, there was a family 
in the area that has a farm, and they have a big barn—it's a big metal building—that 
they chose to use it instead of our facility for the ceremony. So we manned it there 24 
hours, we had staff there. And my son was one of those. And he called me on his 
cellphone, said, "Well, I've just seen something that I've never in my life seen and 
probably will never see again." I said, "What's that?" He said, "I just witnessed a guy 
took a gun up to the head of a cow and just shot him." And he's, "I— didn't know that I 
signed up for that." (Laughs) But that was what they did. They killed the cow. Now, 
they will bring the meat here on premises, and they will have a refrigeration unit 
brought in, that they store the meat. We built a pavilion—I don't know if you saw it 
when you came in—right outside of our parking lot. It's a pavilion that we use to store 
our vehicles, but that we also, when it's not used for that, when we have a Hmong 
service, they use it for an outdoor shelter. We have some ceiling fans, they have 
restrooms there, we have a — behind it is a patio with a wall that they can use to chop 
the meat, cook the food, and there's water service, there's drainage, there's a stainless- 
steel sink in place. We haven't gone so far as to put a roof on it, just for fire purposes, 
and to —you know, house it, house these, where they would be, as an indoor thing, or 
put a stove there. We did purchase a 10-burner gas stove. We haven't hooked it up yet. 
And the reason we haven't gone that far yet is because, just the market, the way it is, 
some of the Hmong families — as much as we've invested in this facility for them, in 
trying to accommodate them, they're not very loyal, and they'll go wherever the best 
deal is. There is a Hmong person that has moved in from Minnesota and he saw this as 
a market that he could use. He rented a restaurant facility that was not in operation, and 
he's renting it now, and a lot of the Hmong families are going that direction. So we've 
decided to halt our spending, because we want to see what's going to happen. It may be 
that they come back, and then we'll continue, but for now, we're not serving as many as 
we have in the past. 
SB: Right. Now, is he doing funeral—I mean, the funerary services as well, the 
mortuary work — or just the sort of venue and hosting? 
CJ: He's only doing the hosting at the facility. But I don't know if you're familiar 
with a national company called Service Corporation International, trade name Dignity. 
SB: Yeah. 
CJ: They're well saturated in our area, and it's my understanding that this person 
has a national contract with Dignity. I don't know when that runs out. He won't speak 
to us. I think he's afraid that if we negotiate with him and say, "Well, okay, let us be 
your funeral home," that we might entice the family to use our facility and cut him out. 
That's just my suspicion, I don't know. But either way. We're happy to service anybody 
that chooses us. And we still serve some Hmong families. And we just have a feeling 
that that's a trend and it won't be there for long. 
SB: That's so interesting, the sort of accommodations that people make to each 
other's cultures. 
CJ: Mm-hmm. We've spent tons of money here. This facility that we're sitting in 
now, called the Celebration Center, we really built it with them in mind. We would go 
to each family over a period of time, a period of years, "What do you need from us? 
What does your culture need from us? How can we accommodate you? You're a good 
niche market for us, we love your people." We actually have someone on our staff who 
is Hmong—we have two, two people. They're out in the Hmong community telling our 
story and letting them know what we can do for them. And so we've done a lot of those 
things. We've increased the size of our parking lot, we've added the pavilion, we have 
our own cemetery where a lot of Hmong people are buried. We have an inventory of 
grave spaces at other cemeteries, that we own, and we can accommodate them at those 
cemeteries as well. 
[00:40:00] And we have this facility, that's, you know, well over $300,000. So it's a 
little disheartening to invest that and then to watch them go away. But at the same time, 
we've been able to use this for many other uses and many other families, other events 
other than funeral events. Like I mentioned earlier, birthday parties. We've had family 
reunions here. And it's not expensive to rent it. It's just that we want it to be utilized, 
and we want to let folks know what we can do for them. 
SB: Right. Have the investment return. 
CJ: 
Mm-hmm. 
SB: What is involved in operating cemetery space? Is that— That's behind the 
building, right? 
CJ: Correct. Our cemetery is a private cemetery, meaning we are the owners of the 
land. It's not a perpetual care cemetery like a memorial park. That would be regulated 
by the state. They have to get a license. There's certain requirements in order to stay in 
business and to actually go in business. To open a cemetery you've got to have so much 
money set aside in a fund, and so much land, like 30 acres or something like that. 
Obviously, this land is attached to our facility and our property. So when the church 
sold us this property, they couldn't separate the deed because the graves were so close. 
And so we took the good with the bad. And the bad is that if we were going to open a 
funeral home we'd love to be able to drive around it and utilize the back part as well. 
The good part is that we have grave spaces that we can utilize. 
[Pause in recording] 
SB: Another thing I'm interested in is is there any sort of community pushback from, 
you know, surrounding non-Hmong communities to services? You mentioned being, 
you know, some anxiety about when the animal is in the parking lot and visible. Is that 
something that other people are at all—do you receive any feedback about that? 
CJ: I do get some feedback. Mainly from, say, we're out at a restaurant or out in 
public somewhere, and we'll introduce ourselves to some new folks, and they'll say, 
"Oh, you're the ones that, I drive by your place and you have these all-night funerals." 
Or "these all-night parties," they'll call them. And at first I don't know how they mean 
it, or I'm a little taken aback by it. But I try to make it a positive spin, and I tell them, 
"Yeah, these are the Hmong folks, and they're very good people." And then they'll 
invariably say, "Oh yeah, I know! We work with some folks and they're really good 
people." So it's not negative. They don't specifically say anything about animals. I did 
have—we are next-door to a school also, and so — I was just telling somebody this 
today—I had a teacher call me one day, and they're, the kids are out on the playground, 
and there's a service going on on a Friday. And there's Hmong folks out at our pavilion, 
which is close to the playground. There's some Leyland cypresses that separate, so you 
can hear what's going on over there, and I'm sure they can hear what's going on over 
here. And so the teacher called and complained, very disturbed that we would kill a pig 
on our property and that the kids made a comment about it to her and she wanted to 
make a phone call. Of course I assured her that didn't happen, it was, the squealing that 
she heard was probably one of the kids squealing, or some of the loud folks talking or 
laughing out at the pavilion. But I just had to make her assured that that didn't happen 
here and I wouldn't allow it. And I actually walked out to make sure. But it was none of 
that. I didn't see any blood, didn't see any pigs. (Laughs) 
SB: And just a sort of inter-religious level, there's not— I mean, this is a fairly 
conservative Protestant area, isn't it? 
CJ: Right. 
SB: Is it—just in terms of other people exercising religious rituals outside, is there 
discomfort with that? 
CJ: Um, I haven't had any. I think most people are pretty tolerant about the different 
cultures. In this day and age people are a lot more tolerant about a lot of things. 
[00:45:05] And so that's part of it. And by them, the Hmong folks are definitely a 
part of our society. There's a pretty good population here, and so they're part of the 
workforce, and they're in our factories and our manufacturing facilities. You go to a car 
garage and there's Hmong folks working there, you go to our school system, there's 
Hmong folks working there, you go to our medical facilities, there's Hmong folks 
working there. And so most of us know that there's — a lot of us know folks that are 
Hmong, and are friends with them or associates with them. So they, they treat it like 
anything else really. I don't really see it as being any issue whatsoever. 
SB: All parts of the same community. 
CJ: Right. The only thing is the comment that we hear about, "They don't" — That's 
when they see them in their workforce or in their everyday activities. What they don't 
see, what they don't understand, is the funeral rituals. So when they drive by our 
facility and they see cars, and people, all hours of the night, I want to ask them, "What 
are you doing up at that hour?" (Laughs) 
SB: (Laughs) Maybe they're going to an all-night party. 
CJ: Exactly. But it's okay. You know. At first I was a little reluctant, because I didn't 
want it to damage any other business, any other families, I didn't want them having 
negative responses to what we do. And I'm sure there's some of that that we don't hear 
about. But I think generally, our business has grown by leaps and bounds. I would say 
that we're not getting any negative feedback about that. 
SB: I think that that's — I mean, just speaking as somebody from the Carolinas, I think 
that's something that people in other parts of the country don't understand about us, 
that there is that diversity and community meshing. 
CJ: Yeah. Well, the other point is that our facility is conducive, because we try to 
accommodate their needs. On the side of the building that you're on right now is where 
you would see the Hmong family. They would be in this room, we have a basement- 
level gathering center that they would use as well. Restrooms there, a big—it's like the 
fellowship hall of a church. We have our pavilion, the parking lot. Other than some 
parking on the other side of the building, there's really no need for the Hmongs to be 
over there. We've actually had, on Saturdays when they would be there, we've had 
services in our chapel with other families. So we have both going on at the same time, 
and it's never been a problem. 
SB: Now, shifting topics a bit, how do you personally—actually, this is a very 
different topic — how do you personally take care of yourself emotionally when, you 
know, you're dealing with a call that's particularly traumatic, an especially sad death. I 
mean, that must be something that you deal with frequently. How are funeral directors 
resilient enough to handle that? 
CJ: Good question. The first thing that comes to my mind when you ask that 
question is — I guess it's because I've been a funeral director all my adult life, so I am 
resilient to trauma and blood and gore, and those traumatic deaths, and those grieving 
families that are so outwardly grieving. The first thing that came to my mind, though, is 
that it's not that so much that bothers me, that really takes its toll on me. It's more that 
public that tries to get something for nothing, and tries my patience. Just unreasonable. 
Those are the families that I have a harder time dealing with. And you try to keep your 
cool, you try to be professional and businesslike, and be compassionate, all at the same 
time. It's actually different. We had a situation just recently with a family that I'd never, 
in all my years. I'd never experienced. That was the thing that I wrote to some of my 
study group comrades about. I actually had to ask this certain family member, "You're 
not very happy with us right now, are you?" 
[00:50:05] And he couldn't really answer that in the affirmative. He said, "Well, 
mostly positive, but—" And so I came back at him and said, "Well, no, what I'm getting 
from you is that you're not happy." And so, "We've already done a certain portion of 
service for you. We're going to keep that money. But you've paid us for some other 
things that we haven't done yet. I'm going to refund that money, and perhaps you'd 
feel more comfortable going somewhere else." And so I've probably done that maybe 
twice in my career, over thirty-some years. This guy was the worst. He was absolutely 
the worst. But you know, he wouldn't accept it, "Oh, no, no, no, I want you to — " And 
the bottom line was he wanted something for nothing, and he was being very 
unreasonable about it, and very belligerent about it, and insulting to us about it. But 
those are the kinds of families that I'm starting to —not to that degree—but I'm starting 
to see some of that in the general public, that are being a little more unreasonable these 
days. And that is really weighing on me quite a bit, as a — I'm not old, but I'm an older 
funeral director. I'm not young. And through my career, I haven't ever had to 
experience that. Most people have always been very grateful and gracious, and sure, 
they experience grief and they experience anger, but never to the degree that I 
experienced this past week. And I know that's all fresh on my mind and probably why 
I'm talking about it. I am noticing a trend, and I hope it's — I hope it's not a trend, I hope 
it's just a fluke, a cycle that we're going to get through—that the public is being a little 
unreasonable these days. 
SB: What do you think is spurring that? What's that due to? 
CJ: Economy? I don't know. Maybe it's the economy. I'm sensing also that, you 
know, cremation is on the rise, it's a disposable body now. It used to be a body where it 
was very reverent, it was very respected, and we did things with rituals and ceremony 
that were traditional but also therapeutic. And it's almost like people don't care 
anymore. And I don't know if it's the transient society, or it's the economy, or— Who 
would have ever thought that a 90-year-old woman would be cremated in 2017? When 
she was born and all through her life she always felt that she was going to be buried, 
and probably had a cemetery where all of her relatives are buried. So she goes to 
hospice and she has a lingering illness, and all through this process she probably has a 
life insurance policy that would take care of whatever her needs were. But the family 
makes a different decision. "Let's just cremate her. We don't want to see her. We've said 
our goodbyes at hospice. They gave us ample time to do that. We don't need to see her 
in a casket. We've had our therapy. It's easier, it's cheaper, and look at all the money 
we're going to save." And they don't see the value in not just the, not only the process 
of the visitation and the support of the community and the funeral service itself—the 
viewing of the body, they don't see the value of that—much less the value of having a 
final resting place for the mortal remains. And that's what cemeteries are for. Now we 
have columbariums with niches for cremation ashes, or cremains. And only a certain 
segment of the population will opt for that. A lot of them are just — some of them will 
say, "I don't care what you do with them, just dispose of them." "We don't do that. 
They're yours. You do with them— If you want to do that, that's fine. You want to 
scatter them, that's fine." And of course, people are saying, and I'm hearing this from 
families, "His wish was to be scattered at sea," or "scattered in the mountains." And so 
they're taking that, and they're taking it a step further, and fulfilling that request— 
which, I don't see —there's nothing wrong with. I'm just saying that bodies are a little 
more disposable now than they used to be. And it's a shame. I've talked with pastors 
that have a real problem with that. And so I don't know what the solution is, I don't 
think there is one, I think we're there. We're already at 70 percent cremation in 
America, and some people will not cremate. I probably will be buried instead of 
cremated, that's my wish. 
[00:55:10] But my wife would rather be cremated. So (laughs) there you have it. 
SB: Even within one family. 
CJ: Correct. I tell her that she better die after me, because I'm the next of kin. I get to 
make that decision. 
SB: Now, does that often put you in a difficult position in your work — I mean in 
addition to the question of cremation—but, you know, when the deceased person may 
have expressed, but in a non-legally-binding way, what their wishes were, but the 
family— And I know you have to follow what the family requests. But is that difficult 
for you, the conflict between what the deceased person has expressed and what their 
family decides to do? 
CJ: I relate that to, years ago, when people would say to me, "Oh, just put me in a 
pine box." Or, "Just throw me in a ditch." Do they really mean that when they say that? 
I don't think so. I don't think—their family would not want to do that, of course, put 
someone in a ditch. But there are those cases where family members are conflicted 
among themselves about burial or cremation. And there is a compromise. Cremation 
provides many, many options for the disposal of the ashes. Niches, burial, 
columbariums, or mantles, in an urn; scattering, favorite place on earth. But the 
compromise can be, "Let's embalm the body, let's place his own clothing on him, place 
him in a ceremonial casket," not one that you purchase but one that is used over and 
over. Just the interior is cremated with the body. The exterior is a shell that's used over 
and over. We call it a ceremonial casket. And let's have a funeral service and a receiving 
of friends, and instead of going to the cemetery for the burial, everyone dismisses, and 
we cremate the interior of that casket with the body, and then we provide them with the 
cremains, and they can do whatever they wish to do with the cremains. They can scatter 
if that was his wish, or they can bury them at a cemetery along with other family 
members, or they can put him in an urn on the mantle. Whatever they choose to do, it 
provides lots of options. So that is, that's one compromise that can take place. Other 
compromises are let's have what's called a private family viewing. No ceremony. Have 
a memorial service, usually after the cremation, at their church with their own pastor 
involved, or they can have it at our chapel with their involvement, or at a church with 
our involvement. We do all three. But the private family viewing is where we embalm, 
dress them in their own clothing, place them in a ceremonial casket, provide a private 
room for up to an hour to let them say their goodbyes. They can invite anybody in that 
they want, family and/ or friends. Not a ceremony but just a gathering of friends to say 
goodbye. There's also, you can have a public visitation with the body present, and no 
ceremony. And of course after cremation you can have the ceremony, which is called a 
celebration of life or a memorial service, that can be done anywhere. So try to interject 
some of those compromises into there, and see what they bite. What they (?). I've seen it 
happen time and time again, we're in the arrangement conference, and the decision has 
been made, it's cremation—no viewing, no ceremony. Then you see some tears start to 
flow on one family member. And everybody's attention goes to those tears, and they 
say, "What's wrong? Are you okay?" "I want to see my daddy," or, "I want to see my 
grandpa." So a different decision gets made at that point. So. Sometimes it's up to the 
last minute, when different decisions are made. 
SB: That also reminds me of something I was going to ask earlier. We've talked 
about different religions and different religious services; what about totally secular 
services? Are there many of those in this area, or people who choose to have, you know, 
a non-religious observance? 
[01:00:00] CJ: Probably very few. We're in the Bible Belt. Churches on just about 
every corner. And even, I would say, in a lot of families, and even in my own family—I 
happen to be a Christian, and I know what that means to me, but I have family 
members that don't go to church, and they claim to be a Christian, and to whatever 
degree they are comfortable with that, it's fine with me. I could certainly talk to them 
more about that, (probably?) I should, but I haven't. It's their choice. But there are lots 
of family members that we work with that, if we were to ask them, "What 
denomination are you?" or "What religion are you?" "What's your beliefs?" they'd say, 
"Well, I'm a Christian. They don't really know what that means, because they probably 
haven't set foot in a church or had a religious experience or they don't have a 
relationship with Jesus Christ (laughs), so I think most people identify as a Christian in 
our area, but there are a lot of unchurched people. And so sometimes we're faced with, 
"Well, do you have somebody that we can get?" And sure, we have pastors that tell us 
all the time, "If you ever have someone that needs a pastor, let me know and I can 
help." But I typically ask them for an honorarium to give to that person. Because there's 
a lot of credentials involved. Lot of planning involved. They need to be paid for their 
services, and so I try to help them out on that aspect of it. So there's a lot of — not a lot, 
but occasionally there are times when they all of a sudden have a need for a pastor. 
(Laughs) Did that answer your question? 
SB: Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I wanted to ask just two sort of general 
questions to wrap up, but what do you think makes a good funeral director? 
CJ: Oh wow. (Laughs) Um, I've been— gosh— I've been told all my career that I'm a 
good funeral director, by many people. And I don't want that to sound egotistical at all. 
I'm a very humble person. I'm very reserved. I'm a conservative, sentimental. My 
mother, I could — she's still living but I could kill her sometimes for instilling in me the 
sensitivity that I got from her. But if you take those attributes, the compassion along 
with it, I think that makes a good funeral director. I've been told that, and I've been told 
by many families, "Gosh, Carl, you're exactly what we needed at that time." They're 
always grateful, and they're thankful. Sometimes you walk into a conference, and you 
don't know the personalities, and you're trying to get to know them, sort out who's in 
charge, sorting out who's going to give me a hard time and who's going to work with 
me here. And lots of times they're very quiet and reserved, and they're either angry, or 
they're —I represent death to them. They're grieving, obviously. And I don't know 
where I stand with them at that point. But my attitude is, "Tm here to help. I'm going to 
be very accommodating to you. I'm going to advise you. You're hiring me to do that. I'll 
be businesslike. I'll be professional." I mean, I don't say those things, but that's what 
I'm trying to relay through example. And for whatever it is that I do, by the end of that 
conference I get smiles out of them, and handshakes, sometimes hugs. And comments 
from them that say, "You've made this process a lot easier, and we sure are grateful for 
you." And I get notes and cars. We used to get pies and cakes, but we don't get those so 
much anymore. 
SB: And what do you wish more people understood about your work and your 
field? 
CJ: Oh wow. 
SB: I know you've mentioned some of these things already. 
CJ: I wish that families would understand what-all has to happen when somebody 
dies, and the things that we can help them with, and the things that we actually do help 
them with, a lot of them behind the scenes. But as I mentioned earlier, it seems like 
more and more families are wanting something for nothing, and we just can't give it 
away. There's some expertise involved, there's some credentials involved, education, 
there's quite a bit of investment, and there's a big payroll. 
[01:05:10] And, okay, if you're not using all of that, fine, but don't try to beat me 
down and cheat me out of it. I just wish that they were more aware of what-all there is 
to do, and the things that we actually do do for them. And don't take me wrong, a lot of 
them do. Many, many do. They are very grateful. And I am appreciative of that. But 
there are those few that, I wish we could somehow educate them to that degree, make 
them aware of what-all is involved and that there is value in what we do. 
SB: Is there anything that you've been hoping to talk about or cover in this that we 
haven't talked about? Anything you'd especially like to add? 
CJ: Hmm. I really can't think of anything that pops out at the moment. We've 
covered a lot. But I keep going back to the value of the funeral and the therapy 
involved. I can't put my hands on it, but I have heard through the years that there was a 
study from, in Vietnam, where bodies were brought back— some were intact, some 
were not, some were open-casket, some were not — and that through the years these 
folks have kept up with these families and tried to get a gauge of the grief and where 
they stood, and how well they tolerated the grief. The result was that the ones that were 
able to view the body, and they could find — I don't like the word "closure" — but they 
could find that, it was more helpful to them in their grief process. And those that did 
not, of course, were just the opposite, and they struggled more. Just takes longer to get 
through that. So I take that to mean that there is therapy, there is value in the open 
casket, and whether they're going to cremate or not, there should be some respect of the 
body and some viewing process, whether it be a clinical viewing or a private family 
viewing, or a public visitation — I really like that. And it's not just because of the money, 
it's not just because of the revenue source, it's because I believe that there's value in it, 
and if there's something I could change about funeral service, that would be it. I wish 
we could reverse the trend of cremation. And if we can't do that, let's at least find more 
value in the therapy of viewing the body, and then proceeding with whatever we need 
to do at that point. 
SB: This has been wonderful. Thank you. 
CJ: Good. I appreciate it.
