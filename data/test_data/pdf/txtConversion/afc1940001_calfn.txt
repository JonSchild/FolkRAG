The CalifornianWe've formed and all well mannedTo journey afar to the promised land;Where the
golden ore is rich in storeOn the banks of the Sacramento shore.Chorus:Then ho! Boys, ho! who to
California go,For the mountains cold are covered with gold,Along the banks of the Sacramento.Ho!
ho! away we got digging up gold in Francisco.Oh! the gold is there, most anywhereAnd they dig
it out with an iron bar,And when it's thick, with a spade and pick,They've taken out lumps as big
as a brick.Oh! don't you cry or heave a sigh,We'll came back again by and by,Don't breathe a fear
or shed a tear,But patiently wait about two year.We expect our share of the coarsest faro,And
sometimes to sleep in the open air,Upon the cold ground we shall all sleep soundExcept when the
wolves are howling round.As off we roam over the dark sea foam,We'll never forget our friends at
homeFor memories kind will bring to mindThe thoughts of those me leave behind.In the days of
old, the Prophets toldOf the City to come, all framed in gold.Peradventure they foresaw the day,Now
dawning in California.
