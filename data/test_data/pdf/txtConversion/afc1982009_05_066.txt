Field notes, 2 September 1978 (Saturday) 
Last night with OF and AJ to a meeting of the Twin County Fox Hunters 
Club about 10-12 miles out of town in Carroll County. The club is located 
on county rd 620 (dirt road)j go east on 97 out of Galax, turn R on 713 (north), 
and then baclc east at 683, then onto the 620# Followed signs on the way 
out, about 4i00, arrived there before dark. 
Contact for this (permissions man) was a Jess Higgins, who was 
president of this organization, and an elder in the Galax Prim Bap Ch, 
but he seemed very busy and rather neutral to us when we introduced 
ourselves. As night wore on, it seemed apparent that the local club had 
greatly underestimated the people who would come. We talked to people from 
5 states, all of whom had brought their limit of 2 dogs for this all night 
Field Trial. Logistics began to be a problem. 
No faxes are let loose in a Field Trail; the dogs are released at 
once ("making the cast") and each dog has a number painted onit; the 
dogs are then evaluated at various points during the night by one of 
a number of judges spotted around the woods. They score the dogs on 
Hunting, Trailing, Speed & Drive, and Endurance (of. scorecard included 
in documents/clippings file), and in the morning at 9i00 the dogs have 
all come in and the judges come in and over coffee they total the scores. 
Did several interviews with field trail people, young »nd old; about 
180 dogs were finally enetred. This particular club has been dormant for 
a number of years, and is just now starting to get up again. We gathered 
that there was considerably more fox hunting in parts further northi 
Many people complained about the new regulations prohibiting the hunting, 
and there was a lot of general talk about showing dogs. Later that night 
they had a bench show to choose the best looking dog. 
However, about 7i00 myself and AJ left to go up to Rocky Knob, above 
Mabry Mill, on the parkway where Andy Kardos had invited AJ to appear at 
a campfire held in the campsite by local NFS people. There are semi- 
formal programs featuring local musiains and storytellers, etc. At 
the one tonight not many locals played; Andy and Sue Kardos, AJ, BO, 
and Wally Macaow performed, and everything went well with the audience; 
met Barry Poss and we talked a lot. 
About 10*00 headed back to fox hunt to try to be there for the "cast”. 
We had been told we could tape this, and would be allowed to go along. 
I stayed at the club, AJ/C1 went to cast; took Nagra around to where 
I was told I could hear foxes coursing thru the woods, but hward none. 
Gave up about 2 and headed in, talked with Barry until 3:30/ or so. 
About 9:00 AM headed back up with CF to "mop up" and find out who 
won. Stayed the morning, taking photos and doing some more interviews. 
Many of the people into fox hunting use as their media The Hunters Horn 
or Chase — both magazines, the Horn published in Illinois, Chase in NC. 
These list hunts, trals, stud services, etc. Also have a lot of interesting 
tail tiles and lore in them. 
2 Sept p 2 
Talked to some people about leads for gospel singers, (at the 
field trial). Met Warren and Joanne Brown, a local group with 5 
family members and electric piano, live on Rt 3, Piper Gap Rd, 
236-5320 (ac 703); Box 489. Have rec by Heritage. Told me about 
Walker Family (Sparta, LP for Bobby Patterson), and a mail carrier 
named E Caldwell Schuyler from Low Gap — song leader at Mt View 
Baptist Church. Also talked a ld>t about the Believers Qt from 
Austinsville, Warden and Gene Cox, who "sound just like tje Inspirations." 
Find them at Tri County Beal Estate. Plan also to visit th Browns. 
Later talked to "The Dutchman," a local character reputed to know 
more about fox hunting than anyone around; real name is Ernest Liddle, 
and his number is (Galax) 6-5388. Set up interview for him iater. 
Returned to Galax about liOO. Found out about a monthly regular 
gospel sing at the Friendship Independent Baptist Church, south of 
Baywood just over the NC line. This was a tip from a Mrs. Mae Willey, 
of Baywood, an informant who has been helpful; she and her husband 
were going and told us we could come along; they had already spoken 
to preacher in charge. We drove to Baywood and then followed them on 
down, their big Buick roaring around the dusty roads. (Mainly down 
oty rd 625) 
Got there about 7;0U -- a new, plesaant church well lit and 
well attended. The preacher in charge was Rev Larry Andrews (phone 
919-657-8126, Box 35, Ennice NC). Rev Larry is young and plays guitar 
and sings a lot himself; has radio show on WCOK (Sparta?) on Saturdays 
11 30 til noon. He said that there would be primarily two guest 
groups tonighti the Ted Bartlett Quartet from Baywood, and the Bear Creek 
Baptist Church Choir from Fairview NC. Bartlett's group sang first, 
and they were fairly good (see tape logs for details). Bartlett, in 
his 40's, is a "properties representative" for the Appalachian Power 
Company in Independence (Residence 236-5628), and he is quite sophisticated 
about his sound system; in fact, helped us jack into his PA system 
to our mixer. The Brer Creek Choir was good and loud, and brother 
Larry (who used to be from that church) sat down on the steps and plugged 
in his electric bass and played along. 
The bass player for Ted Bartlett was Katie Lundy, Ted Lundy’s 
sister, and she came up and intro uced herself iater. A couple of 
men did some fine duet singing! Barlow Stanley and Elton Byrd, both 
from Dobson Rt 3 (Surry County). Brother Eunice Holbrook dismissed us. 
4 September (Monday) field notes 
Spent much of morning around office doing odds and ends 
and logging some. Restless by noon, tried to oall Ernest Liddle, 
with no results. Then managed to oontaot the Schuyler family in 
Lowgap and by ooincidence they were practicing singing that 
afternoon; it was a good time, so we were invited down. Right 
then father & son were shoeing horses. 
CF came too, wanting some shots of the horse teheeing, but 
arrived too late. Set up to record the <5 of them doing some nice 
shape note soapella singing; mostly out of of? Vaughan, S/B, or 
Teachers paperbacked convention books. They had a huge collection 
of books, but the songs they sang a lot they had torn out of the 
books and pasted onto pieces of cardboard for easier reference. 
Tapes give a good idea of their repertoire. We started off with 
just 2 mikes, but after an hour a Mrs Ted Draughan came in; she 
liked to play piano with them, and the piano wouldn’t mike. CF 
went back for mixer, while I did some unaccompahied staff. When 
CF returned, did a nice session with a slightly out of tune piano. 
They were apologeticabout the piano, asked us back for a session 
at Mrs D's hous.e where there was a tuned piano. Tentatively agreed 
on a session Thursday. 
Mr. Schuyler is avery serious old German farmer type who 
agreed to record for us only when we assured him that no one would 
make any money off it at all. He was adamant about the group 
never singing to the Lord for profit. 
After session, copied some Schuyler family photos and got 
some singing and family history; most on tape. Attached is list 
of identifications of some of the old photos we copied. 
Generally a fascinating and very good group. Plan on more 
sessions. Back to Galax about 5t00.

Not much action today. This AM CF & I went into Hoanoke to pick to 
Tom Adier; this took much of day, and stopped for a while in I±y Floyd 
County Sales on way up. Got some LPs, Freeman not there, talked with a 
couple of other employees there. Stopped at Mabry Mill with TA on way 
back and looked it over. 
In by late dusk and logging. 
NE Stopped on way up at Christian Book Store in Hillsvillej found a 
couple of local gospel LPs, and talked to owner about what the 
most popular groups were. By far, he said. The Inspitations, and one 
of the post popular songs recently was "When I Shall Wake to sleep no 
more." 
Field notes, 6 September 1978 (Wednesday) 
to 
Weintraub of the Washington Star here, went out with PM 
see the methods end meet Mr. Hatoher. Later in AM Lyntha and I 
went exploring down in Surry County; turned off 89 south just before 
Lowgap on Cty rd 1408, toward Fisher's Gap; we were looking for an 
old schoolhouse we had been told about, but didnt find it. We did 
finally find a nice old church at Fisher's Gap (FG Baptist Church), 
and noted that the cemetary on the nearby hill had white ohat covering 
virtually ail the graves. Asked at a house behind the cemetary about 
this practice, and were told that the man there knows nothing about the 
upkeep nor does he belong to the church, nor help grave upkeep. He 
suggested we talk to a Mr. Lowe who lived on a road leading up past the 
cemetary on the R, rising steeply up the hill and curving around to the 
north. We climbed this road (can't find name or number for it) 
and got to a rather new house with an oldwoman quilting out in front. 
Introducted myself and explained our interest; she was Litha Lowe, and 
had been a member of the churhc for years. Gave us some chruoh history, 
and soon her husband came in from bee hunting. His name was Fred Lowe 
and he was a bee hunter from way back. Gave us a lot of bee and honey 
lore and told us some very nice things about local history. Among his 
stories was a variation of the hoop snake tall tale that I had 
read in Toliafero (sp?), ca 1859 from the same area: the first recovery 
I've made of one of his tales. Lyntha photographed some of Mrs L's 
quilts, in and out, and I continued to talk to Fred. Later Mr Lowe 
was joined by Jack Hatton, who says he's from Sparta, but who seems to 
have spent many years in the north, only recently retiring here. Gave 
me a long speil on health herbs and various nature foods that sounded 
like something out of Earth News. 
Plan to revisit the Lowes; interesting people, and interesting 
reactions to the outside world. No phone, no TV, only a radio and 
they listen only to the gospel show and the funeral report. 
Later: have listened to tapes done by me at Lowes on the Nakamiohi; 
there's some customary break up, but on 3rd cassette have some real 
speed variation prbblems. Apparently when the batteries on this thing go, 
they go in a real hurry — and the warning light never did come on. 
Need to re do some of this on a decent reel to reel machine. 
Field notes , evening 7 September 1978 cw 
Arrived at the Schuylers' farm about 700 to go to their weekly practice 
session at Mrs. Draughan's house. While waiting for Mr. S. to get ready — 
both he and Trent, son, hid been out working with some of their calves that 
had gotten the scours — Avis Schuyler told me a little of the background 
behind Mr. A.P. (•'Fonzie") Thompson, whom we were to meet. It seems that 
after his work with the Red Fox Chasers, a famous 1920’s string band, 
Mr. Thompson gravitated more toward gospel music. It’s not leally accurate to 
say he got religion, though; he hadllways been strongly interested in sacred 
music, and gradually gravitated more that way. He travelled with the 
Schuylers when Trent was a boy, making a bass for their trio, but more 
recently has only as sung an occasional solo number in church. Mr Thompson 
has two kids now living — Fred, an executive with Western Electric in Richmond, 
and Mary Ruth Childress living in Mt Airy — and has had others in his family 
die tragically. His son Ralph, who was a singer and had his own quartet at 
one time, died 3 years ago of cancer, and Mr Thompson's wife, other daughter, 
and son in law were all killed in an auto accidebt not long ago after they 
had cone to the hospital to see Mr Thompson. Mrs Schuyler again volunteered 
to let us copy the heme tapes she has of the entire Thompson Family singing 
with guitar before all the trggedy. 
Mr. Thompson's house is about | mile below the town of Lowgap on 89, 
and after Mr. Schuyler shewed me with pride his water system which his father 
installed by running a line | mile up the gap into a spring, we left to get 
Mr T. & go on to Mrs. Draughan's. I went with Trent, the ^family's 18 
year old, because I wanted to talk to a younger person in the community, and 
because Trent was fascinating. He is really into the gospel singing, attends 
regular prayer meetings, yet also is heavy into local car culture, cruises of 
sorts, and hangs out with his gang at the local Mobil station. Yet he is 
also in his 2nd year at MYM## Surrey Co Community College, taking 7 
courses, everything from arc wedling to business math to a 1-hour "human 
potential seminar" (his only humanities course); on semen nights he comes 
in at 5:30 from college (it is ccmmutable distance), helps with the chores, 
eats, showers, and goes with his family to a singing. Tonight I could tell 
he was really tired. In fact, the Schuylers are all hard workers, and they 
love their singing so intensely that they are willing to push themselves off 
to concerts and churches even when tired/ Trent said that they were, since 
Mrs Draughan began playing piano for them in February, getting more and more 
requests for church appearances. (NB: in the first taping session, Mr. S. 
was nervous cmly about whether the tapes would be "used for any ccnmercial 
purposes;" "I don't mind singing for you, " he said, "but I don't want 
to see anyone making money off of it.") The furtherest they have been away 
fron Lowgap, according to Trent, is Abin^ton, where they went on their only 
overnight stay. (Here they also met the members of the Chesnut Grove Quartet, 
whom they admire, and in fact the baritone in the Qt has a wife who is somehow 
related to the Schuylers, caning from the same Silver Hill area south of Galax 
at the edge of the ridge.) Usually they travel no more than 50 miles round trip 
in their weekly church appearances. 
Other things Trent talked about: his interest in custcm cars, the occasional 
dirt track race in the area. He said there was a lot of customizing in the 
area, though few machine ships. He was very impressed with his mechanics teacher 
at Surrey CC who haad several years ago built a special custcm racer which 
required dry ice to be kept on the carborateur (sp?); he won a whole season's 
Field notes3 9-7-78, p 2 
Schuylers, cw 
races with this, then sold it to a man named Collins, and he in turn won 
a whole season's races with it. Collins, by the way, quit racing and is 
now a preacher south of Mt Airy (ota, unfortunately), a fact which I commented 
on but which Trent found unremarkable. 
Trent and his boys go more to Galax than Mt Airy for hanging out; he 
says most of the people in Lowgap have more in common with the Galax community 
(on top of the ridge) than Mt. Airy (below the ridge). Mt. Airy's getting 
too rough, says Trent; he reported that the town had a greater crime rate 
per capita than Chicago. They apparently hanging out at some late night 
stores in Galax, though try to avoid "rough" places with rough reputations, 
like Rays kingburger, the all night burger bar. Apoarently no real defference 
real or fancied between ridge culture and non ridge culture here. 
On the way to Mrs. Draughan's passed a good many tobacco curing barns. 
Here is is what we call brightleaf (curiously Trent didn t seem to 
knew the term), as ppposed to burley (grown on the ridge and air cured by 
simply hanging). To cure the brightleaf, it is picked (primed) a few leaves 
at a time, gathered in bunches, and hung in the drying barns; a fire is 
started, a certain temperature is reached to stabilize the plants, and then 
gradually increased. They have been doing this in the area for about a month, 
new, and we passed several farms working in their curing sheds until 
after dark. We also passed the site of the old Jess Franklin house; Trent 
remembers when they pushed it down and burned it. He said there were 
all kinds of stories about old chains and racks and skeletons in the cellar 
for the slaves. Wasn't sure if he believed these stories, but an interesting 
teen age reaction to slavery again. Franklin was apparently a former ggovermor 
of the state; there's a historical marker on 89 about him. Trent said another 
house (turn on the dirt loop road back of the Lowgap school) was a nice old 
deserted one-story house if I wanted to look at it sometime. He had heard 
of one haunted house: naturally, it was in Mt Airy. 
Later at Mrs Draughan's the Schuylers and Mr. Ted Draughan gave me the 
info on this sourwood honey. It is apparently very rare, found only in this 
immediate area, and around Walker mountain in Virginia. It is distinguished 
from the regular kind by its clear texture; "If you hold it up to the light 
and don't see too much yellow, you've got real sourwood honey." A lot of 
the local honey sellers that offer this apparently dilute it some with regular 
honey, and often charge $4.00 a pint for it. Apparently it is conmon to 
dilute it this way for the tourists. This was a good honey year; Trent said 
that whenever they had a fire in the woods, or a lot of clear cutting, there 
was better honey that year. The Schuylers knew the Fred Lowe's, by the way, 
fellow bee keepers I guess. One note: Mr S. kriitd at one point made a reference 
to the fact that he had tried to teach Trent about honey this summer, but 
Trent hariri't time or something. There was seme good natired kidding about it, 
but I felt Mr S really had wanted Trent to get more into it. 
Later that night, back at the Schuylers farm, Mr. S. and I stood out 
and talked for a while. He is worried that we depend too much on electricity 
today; he said that if "they" ever hit us, "they'll" just have to put a few 
key incinderary bombs at power stations and we'll have a blackout like that 
that hit New York a few years ago. He even thinks his own family, though on 
a farm, and sold-sufficient, are vuknerable to this, because they have most 
of their supplies in 2 freezers, and not much canned or dried. He seams to 
Field notee, 9-7-78, p 3 
Schuylers, ckw 
think that such food may not be all that great tasting, but that you 
could live on it. "I can live on pickled beans. They may get a little 
stringer as they get older, but they'd keep you alive." He wants to get 
back into drying foods, too; in fact, last year he bought an old station 
wagon body for $20 and hauled it down into his pasture to use as a food 
dryer (i.e., a substitute food drying shed.) "Not a window in it was 
cracked," he said. I thought he actually meant to just let the windows 
of the winshield dry the food, but he said,ika± "Well, what would you do 
on a cloudy day?® No, this clever old farmer had in mind fri«nr-rwyxi6W'fcxfctaf> 
cutting a couple of vents in the dashboard, putting a little wood burning 
furnace in the engine mount area, and running pipes throughout the car 
so he could really heat it up. He hasn't got around to doing it yet, 
but I'm sure he will. He has a neighbor who recently built a new drying 
shed, a frame building with brick furnace underneath for wood, and can 
dry apples in a day. This man's name is Josh (J.A.) Easter, and he 
lives out the Fisher's Gap road west of Lowgap; you go to the Fisher's Gap 
church (with the cemetery with chat on the graves), turn R on the gravel 
road, go til you hit a 2nd church, and his house is next^on R. Plan to see 
Easter and maybe photograph the drying process. 
On the way back fron the singing, Trent confirmed that the family has 
an elaborate series of hand signs they use to ccmnunicate with each other 
and with their occasional piano player. A circular motion means do xmsx 
an extra chorus; a beackoning motion means for the person to open mouth 
and sing more clearly. Fist down rapidly means to speed up the tempo, 
and fist dcwn sort of into hand means to accent more strongly. Five fingers 
open meant sanething too, but I forgot what it was. Mr. S. does most of 
the directing himself, needless to say, and enjoys it immensely. His 
cupping his haod to his ear is ap arently just an aitubempt to make himself 
heard better (i.e., to hear himself) and cutting his L hand up is an 
attempt to hear them better. 
After singing until nearly midnight at the Draughan's, we sat on 
the front lawn and ate watermelon. Mr. S. was reflective, and said that 
he feared the shape note singing would die out. He explained that he liked 
it not so much because it was old, but because it was an easier system of 
musical notation to learn. Easier to transpose, for instance. None of them 
except Mr Thompson read round music, and they simply don't buy a piece of 
music unless it is shaped. Mr. Thompson did show us a piece of sheet 
music he had bought in round notes, where he had added shape note 
equivalents to the round notes so he sxsii could sing it. (Must photograph 
this.) 
9 Sept, Saturday 
About 8jU0 left to attend and tape a oountr|i auction I had read 
about in the iacal paper. This was the Hardin and Lillie Etta Hall 
estate, located on State Rd. 701 (Joy Ranch Road) near Woodlawn VA. 
It is about 2g miles north of Rt 775, 1 mile south of Mt Lebanon 
Prim Bap Ch. Auction being conducted by Marshall Auction & Sales 
Service out of Hiilsvilie. 
Thouh auction scheduled to begin at iOjbO, I got there by 9*00, 
before they had carried everything out of the house into the yard; made 
sequence of photos before this occurred. A lot of people prowling 
around even then. The house was a 2 story 7 room frame house, not too 
old (ca. 1920), and it was being sold with about 24 acres of land. 
This was an older couple who had lived there all their years, all 
personal property; the woman (her husband had died) sat on the porch thru 
most of auction. 
Bought a couple of things at the auction; purchased complete set 
of Blum’s Alamanacs (or from 1919-1975) for the AFC, since this 
almanac is used so widely around this area, and since so many of the 
people even get their jokes from it. For personal use, purchased a 
couple of old records from a stock that went rather high; it was a 
good collection of 78s, with a supprising number of Paramounts (rare 
in VA) and a not so surprising number of Challenges in their original 
sleeves; much religious quartet work, as well as the obligatory Carters 
and Stonemans. 
Talked with the Marshall Brothers, Jim and Clarence, and they had 
no objection to my tapias the auction. Both of them have been auction ering 
for over 10 years and both, curiously, are part time bluegrass musicians. 
I got the Nakamichi out and tried to tape the auctioneering without 
picking up too much PA noise. Much of time used Seanheiser hyper card, 
mikes. 
Lyntha returned for photos about 3 and shortly after that I left. 
Back at motel to find WM had arrived back in town, and general talk 
of whether or not to do a fiddling contest that night at Buleah school 
just below Lowgap NC. Finally decided to do this, since it is a small 
regular contest — regional in most senses. 
Thus took along BO, WM, TA, Rusty Marshall and taped this contest. 
MCCamant & Price went along too. K Creedr ran sound. Problems in running 
mixer here ; ran six mikes into it, and taped them to Kyle's mikes. 
Tricky trying to keep up with sounds of diff groups. None of the music 
was outstanding, and attendance was smallwr than they had hoped for. 
More info in BO, TA notes for this. 
10 September Sunday 
Up early to put together bags of sound gear to do the two black 
churches. About 830 left with Gerri in one car, Lynthia and Andrew 
in mine. Macdeonia Baptist Church is off Macedonia Church Road off 21 
going from the parkway to Sparta, in NC. I had gone with Pat earlier 
and secured what I thought was pretty secure permission from two 
of the church deacons, Walter Brown and Leonard Bryan, but was still 
apprensiveja apparently this church had refused the team permission to 
document their homecoming eailier in the month (August), there was 
some reference to this earlier refusal today; Deacon Brown says (on tape) 
that when "these people first came around I didn't give them much time," 
but now that he understands what we're doing, he&s more supportive. 
And a woman spoke to me on the way out after the service, saying, "This 
was really a much nicer service than that other one would have been anyway." 
No problem in taping, but had to remind Gerri and Lynthia (who were 
sitting in congregation) to sit on the left side (facing the pulpit) instead 
of right. Men generally only on right, Deacon Brown said when I asked. 
I sat in a small room to the right of the pulpit and ran the mixer and 
6 microphones. At the end of the service, the preacher, Brother Young, came 
over and whispered to me askin if I could say a few words. I did. Pat 
says he has done the same thing twice in churches. Brother Young is from 
near Galax, a big heavy impressive man with a brace on his foot. In spite 
of this, he moved around a lot during the sermon, and once or twice jumped 
totally in the air. Deacon Bryan led the singing very well. Interesting 
contrast between "his" songs and the formal, Sunday school type song the 
choir did as its specialty. 
Delmar Bryan and his wife are young, rich members of the churbh; 
Delmar is obviously a hero figure in the community, because he has made a 
lot of money out of a stock sharing plan he got in on when he was working 
for Lowe's grocery store. He wore modish black glasses during the service. 
They own a sophisticated PA system the church uses, and in fact own the land 
the church stands on. We talked to both of them after the service; she was 
at ease, but he was nervous, not sure how to wear his new wealth. Detected 
a bit of embarassment on their part because we were interested in the older 
elements of the church (make that read, simpler), such as gryan's songleading. 
They emphasized the new Baptist convention meeting in New Orleans , etc. 
One feels some aspects of tradition is for them something to escape from, using 
their wealth. 
After church, returned to G. Gerri wanted to go back out and see if she 
could get Mrs Bryan's quilts photographed, and I had to head to Hillsville. 
I wanted to make contact with the Thurman Largen family, who were to sing 
live on the s'ation at 2:00. Taped the show on the way up to Hillsville; 
he is an interesting and wildly independent preacher, and they sing nice 
unaccompanied numbers. Today they included 'Beyond the Sunset' and set their 
pitch by plunking a banjo string. Met him — pleasant, well dressed mid-50ish 
man who reminds me of Sam McGee, and will tape them at their home tomrorrow. 
To motel about 3:30, napped, met new interns, supper with Rusty, formal 
meeting with team and interns. 
Field notes Monday 11 September 1978 
This morning went to Hillsville to be on a program called 
"Shenandoah Mid-Day," broadcast from the shopping center in Hillsville. 
On the program with me were Jim and Artie (wife) Marshall. I had met Jim 
at the auction Saturday, where he had helped his brother Clarence auction 
off an old homestead. 
Jim has sold truckers parts until very recently, when the job just sort 
of petered out. He also sells real estate, auctions property and cattle, 
and is a song-writer, singer, and rather good banjo player. Jim and his 
wife have been playing together for about 40 years (they started in high 
school) and for a time had a band that included Mel Garden on fiddle 
and Eldon Stanley. Now, though, they mostly perform by themselves, Jim 
singing lead and playing banjo, Artie doing guitar and harmony vocals. 
They have recorded two 45 singles, one in 1963 called "Tandem Blues" bw/ 
onowbound," which was recorded in Winston Salem and in which the instruments 
were apparently done too hot. Last winter Jim released "The Ballad of 
Fancy Gap" which has done quite well, but, as I understand, does not have 
Jim actually playing banjo. Jim, incidentally, hesitatest to desfribe himself 
as a bluegrass musician, saying he never raii really mastered the Scruggs 
roll. 
Jim thinks he can make it playing bluegrass truckers and gospel songs 
(interesting combination) and has also written quite a few local ballads, 
or ballads with a local tie in. This morning he was asking me if I had copied 
off the qords to my copy of "Story of Frieda Bolt" and I promised to get 
them to him. 
°ne of the songs Jim has written was "The Old Time Fiddler," about 3 area 
fiddlers ks including Glen Smith , Ernest Stanley, and one other whose name 
I didn't get. Jim was born in 1929, and says that the banjo player in the 
Laurel Fork area was one Heed Hakes (now deceased), who was a master of the 
Charlie Poole style, and in fact loaned Poole the banjo he made his "last 
10" records on, including "Milwaukee Blues." (Hmmmm.) But Jim sees the 
genealogy of Poole style as coming through Hakes to his pupil, one Martin 
Marshall, Houte 1, Laurel Fork, 398-2249, who still plays the Poole style 
in the area. 
Martin Marshall (no relation to Jim) married Ernest Stanley's daughter, 
and for a time played in a band that included Stanley, himself, and Johnny 
essup (autoharp) and Ei Jessup (gtr)j the band had no name, but was highly 
respected in the Laurel Forks area and played a lot throughout the years. They 
only went to Galax conention once (1938) and never went back; they didn't 
like it. Elbert Marshall recorded a fiome disc of the band which has been 
circulating; Elbert was sort of a homespun engineer at WHHV a few years back 
and Martin's brother. * 
ijartin's wife Eula has an extensive collection of old song texts. 
The Hillsville station WHHV is run by a husband and wife team, Kathy 
Kelly and Russ Pomeroy, who recently took it over and dramatically changed the 
format from MOH to more gospel, country, and bluegrass. Russ came from VJ&W 
Kt Airy, and both he and Kathy are not natives of the region. Kathy has ambitions 
9/11/78 
of becoming a folklie type singer, with Russ as manager, but both realize 
the value of true traditional music of the area. When they switched the 
format back to bluegrass and gospel, they got 3 domplaints from local 
merchants, one of whom cancelled his advertising and said they had set 
Hillsville back 15 years. But the shows are attracting listeners and 
Russ has plans to set up a live Saturday morning bluegrass show this fall. 
They rejuvenated the "Hjmns from the Hills” show, hired Rev Geo Carter 
as DJ for it, run it an hour each day (actually two hours if you count 
the 5:50 show in addition to the 1:00 show), and Carter is getting a lot 
of requests. They also have set up talk shows and interview shows. 
Before the Kelly-Pomeroy team got to the station, the management had 
shifted to MOR and gotten rid of the stations huge bluegrass collection; 
apparently they sold it off to record collectors, etc. Russ said that 
even after they got there, collec tors would still stop by wanting to get 
more records. Russ salvaged about 400 bluegrass 45s, but has only a sad 
handful of LPs. The station has only been going since 1961, but apparently 
had quite a collection. 
The station gets into the east pretty well, into Floyd county, and 
into glSK Galax. 
Lot of rivalry between Hillsville and Galax; a few years ago the 
towns merged their chambers of commerce into one, called the Galax-Carroll 
Co Chamber of commerce, and Russ says that Hillsville has had no new industry 
since then. Today there was controversy over who got to claim the new 
Kiss America; she was saying she was from Galax, but the Hillsville folk 
were upset at this, since she was a Fancy Gap girl and really a Carroll 
county girl. Talk of the old feuds rising up again, Allen gang shooting 
it out at the courthouse, etc. 
Off mike, after th show, Jim Marshall sang a nice version of Uncle Dave* 
"Deliverance will come" which he called "Palms of Victory." Plan to record 
them Thursday morning. 
Lat«r tonight go to the Marshall Largen (pronounced "Larjun") family 
near Laurel Fork. 
Field notes 
12 September (tuesday) 
Spent most of the morning in an informal meeting with the interns 
and the rest of the staff, talking about interviewing techniques. 
■Itly was in for a while, then left. 
In afternoon, went out to see Mr. Josh Easter again. Mr. Easter (cf. 
earlier notes) demonstrated his apple peeling device, and we shot a 
good many photos of his place: the peeler, the drying shed (which he had 
fired up and which was smoking nicely), his "Cow rest" , his homemade 
lathe, his blacksmith's shop, and a planer. Took interns along, and 
George Price commented later that the cow rest was like nothing he had 
ever seen, out of the middle ages. 
Mr. Easter seemed nervous about talking on tape when the interns were 
measuring his drying shed, so I didn't tape. Still need to do this. We 
set a date of next week for the great apple drying demonstration. 
Mr. Easter played a couple of tunes on an old home made fiddle he drug out 
of the attic; he had, as usual, tuned the fiddle into a wildly unusual 
key (sounds like the top 4 strings of a guitar, open harmonics) and he 
probably knows a lot of tunes, for he whittled around on several when I 
asked about them. 
He commented later about his philosophy of self-reliance; he prides himself 
on taking other old stuff and converting it to his own use. He is aware 
that he has a knack for taking older product and recycling it in a 
original way. He|s great at canabalizing cars, and generally loves 
junk: an odd combination of embracing technology on one hand and maintaining 
a sort of pioneer arcadian spirit on the other. 
Later, after the Easter's visit, I stopped to photograph the Roaring Springs 
Baptist Church (another independent church) about ■§- mile up the road from 
Easter's place. The cemetary is in back, and contained a little frame house 
vault over one grave, as well as a poem written about war by a son killed in 
viet Nam in 1971. Few interesting older graves. Exact location of church 
would be on road 1408 near Ramey Creek, Surry Countjs, about 2 miles southwest 
of Lowgap, NC. 
One further note about Easter: he is a self-taught surveyor, and has wanted 
his son to take up the work. He says there is no surveyor in the area, maybe 
even in Galax, and he has a beautiful old compass and surveyor's kit that he 
says is the same kind George Washington used. 
This evening about 7 I and George and Rich went to the house of Walter 
Lowe, to record his gospel group The Elk Horn Four. The group is named for 
the Elk Horn Church off the Piper's Gap road, and featured vocals by 
Walt and his wife Ethel, both in their mid-forties. (Cf. tapes) 
Ethel has a remarkable honest and clear country voice, and is a real delight 
to listen to. She's quite attractive, very shy, and as her husband said, 
oays what she has to say through her singing." 
Field notes, 12 September, page 2 
We recorded a number of very nice things by this group, and about 9:00 
Walt invited his next door neighbor Larry Richardson to come over. Richardson 
of course has an enviable reputation in bluegrass circles; he made, in the 
1940,s, some great clawhammer banjo duets with Happy Smith (including 
"Let Me Fall") and later played with Bill Monroe. About 8 years ago he 
got religion and for a time stopped playing altogether. Then, he recounted 
last night, he read in the Bible where you were to celebrate the Lord 
on stringed instruments. "Then I knew what the Lord had been saving me 
for," he said off tape. "All those years travelling on the road with Monroe 
and not a scratch. I had never stopped to think it was a miracle." 
Richardson then started travelling as a soloist, giving testimonies and 
gospel performahces in churches. He also began to play guitar more and 
banjo a little less, and nowseems to prefer the guitar. 
Richardson was very suspicious of us when he came in, especially since 
we were taking a lot of pictures. He soon eased down though, and began 
to play with the family group and by himself. He is obviously hero 
worshipped by young Eddie, the group's guitar player, and I fancy there 's 
a master-protege relationship going on here. They spent a lot of time 
playing and watching each other's fingers. On the other hand, Walt and 
Larry were old hell-raising motorcycling blaspheming drinking buddies back 
25 years ago (they were both raised in the area) and were very much at 
ease with each other. In fact, there were some delicious insult sessions 
(a la the dozens) which occured between Walt and Larry off tape while we 
were eating chocolate pie in the kitchen. 
After the session, we got some histories and conversion stories. Walt was 
in the resturant business, and for a time sold hams on the coad, but now 
handles mirrors at a local glass factory. Larry travels full time, though 
he spends a lot of time with his father. His father, by the way, was a fine 
old fiddler who knew many great tunes, and Larry says he doesn't know if 
we could persuade him to record for us or not. I plan to try next week. 
Also have notions of a futher, on tape, interview with Larry, and maybe even 
a short BU piece. Larry's playing, as the tapes show, is as strong as ever, 
and he still does do some secular stuff, bute even the gospel is fine, and 
I feel he has been unjustly written off by the grass fans (Dave Freeman in 
particular) sin^e his conversion. He has produced his own LP locally 
and can't get any of the standard distributors to take it. He also had 4 
8 track tapes that never were done onto LPs since ^e finds the LPs harder 
to sell and harder to carry around. He played a lot of what he called 
Mexican music — i.e., Spanish guitar — and did one or two mergings of 
Mexcican and blue grass. 
Got the Independent Baptist line again, and George mentioned he was a 
Catholic, which was good for another hour. In about 1:00. 
Richards and the Lowes live on county road 792, off the main highway 
between Galax and Piper's Gap, about 2 miles from Galax. Lowes are 2nd house 
on L, Richardsons one more up on R.

Field notes 
This morning went with Rusty Marshall to record Jim and Artie 
Marshall at Jim's old store on route 100 near Hillsville. Though the 
store is technically out of the area, both Jim and Artie were bom 
in the area (Galax, Baywood) and for years had a store actually on the 
Parkway. Jim is also an auctioneer (I taped him and his brother 
Clarence last Saturday), a real estate salesman, a former trucker, 
former drug supply salesman, and semi=professional bluegrass musician. 
Recorded in the middle of Marshall's old store surrounded by 
crates of old books, old instruments, old music posters on the walls, 
old chairs, and various junky items. The Marshalls used to have 
occasional music concerts in the store, but haven't recently. Had 
trouble recording them, and am still not satisfied with the results. 
The Shure seemed rather dead, and the two naired Neuman's picked up 
too much of Jim's banjo and not enough of his voice, nor Artie's. 
They sang and talked for about 3 hours, and then Artie had to 
leave to take a gog to the vet. Jim continued to talk with us 
for another couple of hours, and told some great stories about area 
musicians off tape. He has a real sense of local tradition, and offered 
to even bring a couple of older musicians (especially Rafe Brady) to 
the store. This fits in with Jim's interest in local ballads and history, 
and his penchant for writing songs about area events and people. 
This Rafe Brady was the one the crew taped at a dance recently; 
he was active sane years back and then dropped out of sight. He 
was rediscovered recently by people who had heard of him, and after 
a fashion rehabilitated. But drinking has taken his toll,says Jim; 
"Even though he's only 60, he looks 80." Apparently Blanton has not 
even met this guy; Barry Poss was asking about him 2 weeks ago, so he 
may be an interesting find. It would be nice to find a really nice 
fiddler; what fiddling I"ve heard since here has been depressingly 
poor, though I can see how it would appeal to the Galax freaks who 
like this sort of thing. 
One of the songs Jim sang was "On the Old New River," a powerful 
protest (he used the word, not me) song about the attempts to dam 
the New River last year. Jim went on the bus this morning at 2:30 to 
go to Washington to protest the closing of the access roads. Like 
others we've talked to, he was not really boiling mad, but approached 
the issue with a tried, weary apprehension: it was just another 
chore they had to do to keep the government off their backs. At the end 
of the session, I remember Jim yawning and saying, "I'm tired; I sure 
wish I didn'jr have to go up there tomorrow morning." 
Jim went to the Smithsonian festival last year; they enjoyed it, 
but even now haven't yet gotten the $180 premised them for two days' 
singing. 
Field notes 15 Sept 1978 
Office work end logging most of the day. Nothing new to report. 
Field notes, 16 September 1978 (Saturday) 
This morning talked for a time with Whit (Howdy) Sizemore, whose 
band was playing in front of the Galax Chevrolet sales room on Main 
Street. Last night WBOB broadcast live selections from the band, 
interspersed with pitches for new cars, and Adler and I thought it 
might be interesting to try to document this ±x sort of integration 
of traditional music into modern merchandising, and seriously contemplated 
recording and photographing the whole thing. However, when I dropped 
by the piece about 11, Whit said it would be ItOO before they were 
really ready. The rest of the team was to meet at an auction at 
Woolwine (a good, big one, with Matt Burnett doing sme guest calling) 
so I decided we'd wait on the Whit Sizemore documentation. 
Went to the Woolwine auction; it was well covered by almost the 
entire team (cf. notes by Mullen, Owen especially); in fact, with 
both interns, the Eilers, and the other firldworkers busily snapping 
pictures, I got the real feeling that it was overoovered, and decided 
to head out to other things. Before I left I asked the Eilers to 
copy on the ground a couple of old photos that looked intereding, from 
a large box of such photos. These 2 showed a banjoist and a guitarist 
in 2 diff poses, circa 1925. The banjoist looked more than a little 
like Charlie Poole, though no way to ascertain. 
Returned about 3*00 to Eillsville area and on a hunch tried to 
locate the patriarch of the singing Montgomery Family again. This was 
a fine local gospel group that had made a vanity LP a few years back, 
and which I had heard on Rev. Geroge Carter's "Hymns from the Hills" 
radio show. When I had inquired after the group at the station. Carter 
had to admit he knew nothing of them, but displayed the LP *- really 
worn out from a lot of heavy play. So I had pursued what leads I had* 
to the effect that one of the members (Mike) was a mamakBxx pastor of 
a church in Meadows of Dan Virginia; I got a number of leads on Mike, 
but nothing played out. A lot of moving around. Finally, someone said 
that the older man Montgomery lived in Hillsville across from the used 
oar lot. Had tried there a couple of times, but no luck. This time 
through the main drag, I tried again, and finally roused the main 
man himself. 
The father (my informant) and leader of the group is Dewey Mont¬ 
gomery. The others members of the group included Patricia Dalton 
(daughter), and sons Gerald, Ricky, and Nathan. The group is no 
longer singing regularly, but only because some of the members have 
moved away from home. Ricky, for instance, is in college. Yet another 
son is Michael Montgomery (associated with Meadows of Dan Baptist 
Church) but he does not sing — apparently he only annotated the LP 
and acted as sort of a "booker" during the group's heydey. I asked 
about the interesting banjo I heard on the radio version of "Got a 
Home in this Sock"; Dewey said that it was just a banjo player who 
happened to be in the studio in Galax when they cut the LP (he didn't 
specify whose studio this was). They normally used 2 guitars, a bass, 
and a piano, and cut the record around 1976. 
9-16-78, p 2 field notes 
Dewey Montgomery had some new copies of the LP yet, and 
bought a couple from him. It contains interesting notes indicating 
that the whole family was saved from lives of alcoholism, drug addiction, 
etc., and I don't know if this was rhetoric or literal, and 
wanted to ask (Dewey seemed like a tagh character himself, greeting 
me in his undershirt and a 2 days growth of beard) but Dewey had to 
get to work , so we cut short the visit, planning on a return visit 
and more formal interview. (I had taped none of this.} 
Montgomery's number is 728-2505, and his address is box 584, 
Hillsville. 
Sat night — 
Whit Sizemore had invited us to come out to the dance at 
the Fairview Puritan club tonight, so I took along MoCamant and 
Price — really eager beavers where music is concerned — and 
trekked out the 10 miles south of Galax, and into a new concrete 
and sheet metal buildiag that seems used to hold regularly weekly 
square dances as well as regular Tuesday wrestling matches. 
Whit Sizemore is middle-aged, bald headed, a man who until 
a few years ago was known primarily as a bluegrass fiddler. Then 
he started getting into old time music — someone told me he bought 
the Grayson-Whitter LP County has out and listened closely to 
Grayson's fiddling — and today has a fine old time band. Won 
2nd place (I think) at Galax a couple of years ago. More interesting 
than that, though, is the fact that the band is a regular working 
band, functioning in the coununity. They do a lot of square dances 
and local promotion work of sorts; he told me they still did a 
few auctions even. (Wade Ward, Norman and young Jimmy Edmonds 
have also recently played some for auctions in the area.) 
Sizemore's band (see tape logs for full personnel) includes 
Tom Norman, a fine but uneven banjo player, and Sizemore's son 
on mandolin. Their regular caller. Dean Carr, was a rather colorless 
sort that liked to go down on floor to call, but would seldom 
sing or embroider his calls. For a co pie of sets tonight, he was 
replaced by Brian Dollinger, of Fairview; Brian learned to call 
and dance at the old contests at White Top when he was a boy in the 
1930's, and is much more interesting as e caller. He sings a lot, 
and does all kinds of things with the calls themselves. 
About 150-200 people on the floor — good crowd for summer, bigger 
in winter. "In winter we sometimes get 45-47 dhlars each for our 
share" Norman said. Dance floor dark, and meal on floor to help 
in dancing. Dancers formed large circle most of the time; on some 
numbers, announced as individual buck dances. No drinking allowed, btt 
bottles were being passed around backstage and I assume outsiede as well. 
9-16-78, p*g« 3 
Duriag intermission, Sizemore told me that the group had 
done en LP for Heritage, the Galax label owned by Patterson (?), 
but that they weren't happy with it, and didn't feel it reflected 
their best work. Band was at National FF last year, enjoyed it. 
Dance tunas sometimes ran to 20 minutes, and I found this 
fascinating. Vocals were sung at odd, unexpected times, from 
odd unexpected sources, causing severe mixing problems. Fiddling 
was fine throughout, as was the guitar work. 
Midway thru the 2nd set the parents of Mxxx&x the newly crowned 
Miss America, Eylena Barker, came in and paraded around the hall 
waving and shaking hand. Kylene's mother came backstage amd she 
was pursuaded to sing a song with the band; she sung "Release Me." 
She had on a button (huge) announcing MISS AMERICA. 
Dance ended almost on the stroke of 12; dancers active and 
enthusiastic to the end.

FIELD NOTES, SUNDAY 17 September 1978 
Very full day. It began in the dawn about 61OO as I blundered 
into Sweet Sue's for some hambiskets to eat on the way to Hillsyille. 
I was planning to record some of the early religious shows done lire 
in WKH¥ studios. Arrived in time to help btw manager Russ Pomeroy open 
up and get ready for the first of the groups who paraded into the 
studio that Sunday. With Russ's help , I set up mikes in the studio 
taped to those already there, and we waited for the first group. 
This|was Rev. Coy Combs' group, which does nThe Independendant Baptist 
Hour' at seven; this group arrived just a few minutes before air time, 
all looking somewhat disshevelled and unshaven (2 men, 2 women). They 
consented to let me tape, and I taped their program, which included 
some nice unaccompanied singing as well as some preaching. 
While we were taping, Russ told me that the station is actually 
encouraging more local ministers to buy time on Sunday; they have 
a couple of "syndicated” religious shows, but would prefer more 
locals, and they often give very reasonable rates. Even then, several 
ministers are far behind in their air time bills; few churches 
kick in, and many independent ministers, like Combs, who has no real 
one base church, have troubles making the payments. They depend on 
direct contributions from listeners, which are relatively few. 
In fact, Pomeroy suggested that there has emerged lately a new breed 
of radio minister who is not directly affiliated with any church; 
Combs and Largen are two examples. As we chatted with Combs after 
the show, je inadvertently let slip £hat he also had a weekly show 
over WBOB in Gaj.ax, a fact which Pomeroy hadn't known. 
Other groups made their own tapes at home and sent them into 
the station for broadcast; one such was the method used by the Elder 
Ray Rotenizer for "The PrimitSve Baptist Hourj" he records a tape in 
his church (though not an actual service) and delivers it in time for 
broadcast around 8jUO AM Sundays. Russ let me make a copy of the 
tape of that's week show (BR8-CW-R49)• Yet a third way of getting 
services on the air is by line hook-up. For instance, the Mira Fork 
Baptist Church near Willis “feeds” their service to WHHV at lljOO 
through some sort of a homemade transmitter that the preacher built. 
"Most of the time the sound is awful," said Pomeroy, "but they say they're 
happy with it, and they pay their bills." Russ agreed to tape the 
feed this Sunday for me later if I would leave him tape; I did so, 
and picked it up later; vatalogued as BR8-CW-R50. 
Got back just in time to head out (with PM and GJ and 2 interns) 
to the big New Covenant Association meeting in rural area near Baywood 
at a church called the Redmond Creek Baptist Church, (on county rd 624, 
apparently; followed others out) For complete data on this Associan and 
the people, see notes by GJ and PM. I mainly did the recording of the 
service, running 6 mikes into the mixer. Immense volume genrated by 
about 200 very strong voices crammed into that building and outside. 
Very hot. The main speaker was the Rev G. P. Gentry, 94, now of 
Jefferson NC, who was the pastor of thie church for 45 years. The 
17 Sept page 2 
Redmond Creek church has been established for 105 years, though 
the current building (which we photographed and recorded in) dates 
only to 1939. W« left about the time they began dinner on the ground, 
though they offered me a ham sandwich (much appreciated) before I 
left. Cars were so choking this little gravel road that getting 
out was a very major problem. 
Without stopping headed through Galax and down to Lowgap for a 
creek baptizing the Schuylers had set up for us. This was at Carson's 
Creek (just to the R of where the road takes a bend to L going south) 
which was a favorite baptizing place for the people around here for 
over 100 years. Arrived barely in time, and by running to the 
creekband was able to get all of the actual^ cermeony, tho 
missed the congregation on the bank singing "Shall We Gather at the 
River." 
Turns out that 2 area churches h%d baptizings set up for today, 
so they combined the cememonies. Two preachers waded into the water, 
and each bap^izied his own flock. One was the Rev James Byrd of the 
Mountain Viev; Baptist Church in Lowgap (the Schuyler's shuroh); 
the other was Rev. Cecil Hooper, of the Community Baptist Church; 
Rev. Cecil did a lot of the talking, and was more folksy apd probably 
more of a hell and brimstone preacher than Rev Byrd, who appeared 
more subtle in his approach. Terry Eiler shot pictures, but the 
preachers refused him permission to actually get into the baptismal 
pool with the preacher and the subjects. Ho contented fcimself 
with standing on the bank and shooting. 
This whole ceremony didn't last 45 minutes, and the heat was 
becoming oppressive. Stopped at Lowgap Market and inhaled a couple 
of cans of something cold and th ;» in for a while. 
Field notes 18 Sept Monday 
Spent most of the day in office logging and doing various 
forms of paperwork. Looks like as many as 3 reporters this week, 
just es we are planning n digging in for a good last stretch run. 
One reporter is Nita Hilliard, Winston Salem; another is ’’somebody" 
from Hoanoke paper; another is Pet Borden from Winston Salem. 
The project has been ongoing for six weeks now, and only now are 
the local and regional papers showing any interest. 
The Walker Family had been recommended to me by the Browas, and 
others, as good unaccompanied classic quartet singers; today did find 
an LP by them on Patterson's local label. Based on data on the liners, 
tried to contact them in and around the Sparta area. Rachael 
Walker Wilson, I discovered, was really Mrs Reece Wilson, Ennice, and 
got of number of 191-657-3432 on her, but NA. Finally got Bavid 
Walker (919)372-4723, and he said that the group had split up a 
couple of years ggo, and that none of the individuals were even 
singing now. Seemed uninterested in talking with me farther, so 
I didn't press matters. 
Called up John Rector, the old fiddler who lived at Anderson 
St., 236-2784. He's been talked to and recorded a lot, but I had 
some discographical queries for him. First, was he any relation to 
either the John Rector who played with Henry Whitter in the early 
Virginia Ereakdowners Okeh records? No, he had heard of that banjoist, 
but was not related; the earlier Rector was from Fries, and died on 
the streets of Radford in the 1940's. What about the "Rector Trio" 
who recorded several nice string band sides for Okeh, including the 
Skyline Rag and Pt Pisgah blues in late 1930? No, knew nothing of 
him or the songs. (This Rector seems to have been a fiddler, and 
is probably from further south into North Carolina; or so Freeman 
thinks, and I agree.) I asked about the personnel on the wild 
Rector's Wildcat records done for LC in 1937; he remembered it as 
a large band, and including* 
Kelly Lundy - guitar 
Robert Catron - guitar 
- Catron - banjo 
Iver Edwards - uke 
Clyde Issecs — not sure 
John Rector - fiddle 
uhknown - tenor banjo 
The two banjos probably account for the drive of the band. Rector 
recalled that he learned "Old Dad" from a fiddler named Luther Hanks, 
who came to Galax from Ohio. 
Field notes, Tuesday 19 September 197® 
Acting on a tip from Peter Hartman, who wasvisiting over here 
last night, Tom Adler and I drove to Woolwine early this morning to 
check out a house, an old fifer, and a picture in a cemetary. The 
house reccmmended was the "Bunion McAlexander place," located about 
1.4 miles dcwn state road 678, which cuts off highway 8 about a mile 
above Woolwine after you've cone down the mountain. It is a starly nice 
old single chcmney job, but we couldn't get too close because of a 
barking dog, and because we couldn't seem to raise anyone. Also there 
was a sign on a tree by the driveway saying "Good Karma Farm:" an 
interesting transformation frcm the other name. We"ll try to get to the 
owners later. 
A few hundred yards up the road frcm the McAlexander house, on the 
right as you go out (i.e., north), high up in a field, is an overgrown 
old cemetary with a stone for a man named Ison Cockeram, who died 
seme years back, and who was noted as the leading fifer in the region. 
An inset photo shows him playing the fife, and needless to say we cleared 
away weeds and copied it. This cemetary is not visible frcm the road, 
though a rough path of sorts leads up to it. 
On the way down the mountain, we stopped at the general store of 
Ward Ccmpton, near the intersection of the parkway and highway 8 on the 
south side. Ward Ccmpton, who is now 90j is an old housebuilder who 
helped McAlexander build his house. He also built a lot of others here 
and in West Virginia. Ward also built his store, and many of the shelves 
and furnishings in 1935/6. He was out picking grapes when we arrived, 
and he talked about his housebuilding some, though we didn't tape him. 
He says he remembers the transition frcm the older log houses to the 
type the McAlexander place is. He was born in the region, travelled 
while young (he lived in "Indianapolis City" frcm 1911-1913, and worked 
in W Va building houses as a young man) and finally settled down when 
he built the store. He said he built a lot of houses, and some churches, 
in the area when he was out of work in West Virginia and came back here; 
also said he decidedquickly that he didn't want to work in the coal mines 
in West Virginia, though he built a lot of houses for miners, and that 
he decided he could stay out in the air by building houses. Ward also 
fiddles and plays the banjo a bit. His number at the store (which he 
says they keep open til 10:00 (!)), is 745-4769, his mailing address is 
W.W. Compton, Route 1, Box 119, Floyd Va. His wife is also an interesting 
talker: she's not so old, and says she has seme fine quilts to show us. 
We planned on returning to talk on tape with Ccmpton after our other 
errands in Woolwine, but when we got back, his wife had had to go to 
Roanoke to buy eggs, and he was alone running the store, and seemed 
unwilling to talk to us there in the store, with all the interruptions. 
Later we located an old fife player, Elmer Lyon, who lives 
about 2 miles out state road 616 going west frcm Woolwine; turn onto 
state road 619, and his is the first real house on the R; he has an 
old blacksmith's shop across the road, and couple of wagon wheels jthat 
he made himself?) by the driveway. Tock photos of him with fife, premised 
to send George out to investigate further. Did a rough informational 
cassette full of wind noise. Cones from a family of fifers and blacksmiths. 
Is now 86 years old. Has a son, Hubert Lyon, who lives down the road, 
who plays banjo, wife guitar, son autohapp, for own enjoyment. Their phone 
number is 930-2521, and his address is simply Woolwine. 
Had to get back by 1:00 to meet with reporter frcm Charlotte, so had 
to leave further work with Mr. Lyon and Mr Ccmpton to later. 
Field notes, 20 September, Wednesday 
Today we planned to measure the "Crouse” place, near Doughton 
Park, in sight of the parkway. (See attached sheet for complicated 
instructions on how to get there.) In mid-point meeting, NFS said 
they wanted to possibly acquire this to make it a”key interpretive" 
center, and that owners willing and anxious to sell. Today TA took 
the two interns and set out to measure it. According to the Bangers 
at Doughton pari, the farm had been sold only in the last 10 days, and 
the new owner was Carl Church, Sparta. Church s earned agreeable enough 
to me on the phone, but TA said later when he had met him, that he 
was very hostile to the NFS and was making signs about developing tha 
old farm. Coming during the general unsettlement about the easement 
situation, this was just another complicating factor. 
Pat Borden, a reporter from the Charlotte Observer (704-374-7493), 
also arrived today, wanting some general interviews, but especially 
to go on one of the trips. Adler and the 2 interns had already left, 
so I sent Pat Borden down to the Crouse farm with Lyntha, who had 
planned on leaving around noon for some photos. I agreed to meet 
Borden down there about 3j00 and take her back. 
I left about 1:00 and decided, with some spare time, to look 
around Enice for some sort of information about Ihe Peaceful Valley 
Quartet; I had heard their records at Upchurch's shop in Galax, and 
I had the name Audrey Brooks to go on. After asking fruitlessly at 
the local post office, I hit the general store, and got vague directions 
to the Brooks. Finally drove up to a couple fo women talking by the 
road and it turned out that one of them was Carol Brooks, Audrey's 
wife. We visited informally for a while, and a lined up a recording 
session -with them. The two older members of their quartet they have 
now replaced with their teenaged children. Since plan full info 
on them later. I'll save other data for then. 
Got to the Crouseplace about 3:30, and Pat Borden and I drove 
off to visit Mrs. Alam Hemminfcjs. Took rt 77 east toward Dobson, stopping 
en route to photogrph church at Mountain Park, and to photograph some 
Chicano laborers working in tobacco sheeting at the Clyde Smith farm 
five miles east of Dobson. Mrs. Henmings had nice baskets (pine needle) 
which GJ and LE had already photographed, but most interesting were her 
fine primitive style paintings of scenes from her childhood. Tried to 
copy several of these, as did Borden. 
Back to Galax via interstate, in by about 6:00. Bofden did some 
more interviews, then went off in search of another story about a 
haunted (by poltergeist) factory in Galax, where a couple of years ago 
all kinds of strange things took place. This needs following up by 
us too.

Field notes, Thursday 21 September 
Drove most of the day; up to Woolvrine, exploring some back roads 
that no one had gone down; these included down 58, off at SfiSx 636, over 
to 639, to 610, back into to 640, and on into Stuart. Talked to 
people in record store in Stuart about gospel; not much help. Did find 
an excellent 45 gospel by a middle aged preacher from the area named 
Charlie Massey; this was on the Raven label out of Hillsville and was 
THE KINGDuM OF GOD/I'M MY DADDY'S MAN (E0S45-204). Met Massey; he is now 
living in Danville, Phone 799-6869; interesting person to follow up. 
A native of Stuart area, tho, and technically OTA. 
Back by 3t30, talked again to Nita Hilliard of the Winston Salem 
Journal; she seems to be interested in wcharaotersw she can write about 
for her own column about hillbillies, or something, and wants mainly 
for us to share our leads with her. Plans to come up later in week. 
Friday, Sapt. 22/78 
To put it mildly, a full day. Th« Eilara, Maoaow, Fulcher, 
mysalf, TA, MD, all trakked out to tha Eastar farm for appla dryiag. 
Arrived thara about 8»00 — location is up from Fishar's Gap, naar 
Ramay Craak araa in Surry County NCj county road 1408, about 1 mila 
past Baptist church on R. Had visited Eastars before, and he had 
agreed to dry us soma apples, oing thru whole process, and I agreed 
to pay for the apples. He had gotten 4 bushels, and tha AFC repaid 
him the $20 they cost. 
Some problems with tha VTR delayed everything; neither Terry Eiler 
nor I was fully familiar with this system, and we got everything cabled 
up except that tha VTR could not be activated by the camera. Finally TA 
arrived and wo got it working about IQiOO. This set us considerably 
behind schedule, since Eastar said ha needed to get "fired up" as early 
as 8;00 (e,g,m build a fire in his dry house). Shot a lot of footage 
of Eastar pealing apples with his homemade peeler, both still & video, 
and a lot of misc. shots of the house and grounds. Ran a audio tape of 
proceedings since noticed that the off-and-on use of the VTR was missing 
some interesting stories and information. 
General background on Eastar elsewhere; today did mostly drying. 
Once or twice interrupted with rain and had to scurry to get the piles 
of equipment on Easter's porch. Finally got the whole process of getting 
apples peeled, sliced, and fire built, and then apples into the racks on 
the dry house — finished all this by about 2*00. After that, there was 
little to do but wait for the drying process to take place, so most of 
the team left to do other chores. 
MD and I returned about 5j0o to photograph the taking out of the 
dried apples; this was done, in tandem with yet another rainstorm, 
which got the cables good and muddy. But by 6iOO had done video and 
stills, and left with Easter complaining that we had yet another 2 bushels 
he wanted to dry for us. I said later, took a sack full with us. They were 
fine, but Mrs, Easter had told me that if you wat too many of these 
things, they can cause problems, since they are essentially dehydrated 
and rehydrate in the stomach. One story about a boy that died from 
overeating them.

Skipped down to Toast later this evening to record Fern Evans' family 
band; this is a contact ®f Gerri Johnson's, and Fern apparently has for 
years performed with what amounts to an almost ali-firl family band. 
Arnveu about 7*00 to find mysexf in the mids-c of a happening.Big 
comfortable ranch style house, fairly well to do people. The Evans (actually, 
to use miaden names, the Ramey Family) were all set up in a big front rooms 
electric bass, 5 string banjo, guitar, end snare drum, played by a7!- yr old boy. 
9-22, p 2 
In » long room opposite th» living room, where they could see end hear but 
be out of the picture, were shout a dozen assorted friends and relatives of 
Fern and family who had come to "watch the show." Wo set up mixer in the 
kitchen, off to the L of the living room, and ran mike cables into the front 
room. 
The group was a fair to middling biuegr&ss band, though Fern does have 
a nice voice, a good strong country-bluegrass voice. (See GJ’s notes for 
more data) She apparently played a lot with local bands in the 1930's add 
1940's, and won more than a few singing prizes at old time fiddling contests, 
appearing at times with the Jarrels. And all the girls apparently have 
genuine roots in the Lowgap area, and were known as the Ramey Family band 
before they got married. 
During a break Fern told me about some of their cousins, which include 
banjoist Eappy Smith (famous for "Let Me Fall") and a fiddler-banjoist 
named Woodrow Wilson Ramey (called Wilson), who was a legendaey old time 
banjoist who supposedly made some records in the 1930's. When pressed 
for more data about this. Fern called up her 2nd cousin, Earl Ramey, in 
Toast (789-2121); he said the records were old 78s, all right, but that 
they had been actually made closey to 20 years ago. Wiisonjf has a nephew 
living in Winston named ?? . Will try to find out more about these 
records later. 
Talk turned to old local ballads; all knew the Lawson Family, of 
course, but Fern and her husband remember another old murder ballad 
that was printed and sung a lot in t e late 1930(s, right after the 
Parkway was opened, about a murder of a young girl on the parkway. 
Couldn't remember the title though, or any of the song. 
Eilers came and napped some pictures of this session. Endedabout 
l2s00. 
Field notes Saturday, 23 September 
Day of raina and cancellations. First, Jim Marshall had tried 
to set up the session with Martin .Marshall, the banjo player who 
still sounded like Poole, from Laurel Fork, but Marshall's sister 
became seriously ill, and we weren't able to woxk out a session. 
Then another interview I had set up in Galax with fiddler John 
Rector fell through; Rector had to leave town on some errand or 
other. Tried to contact Marshall Largen and failed. Finally, out of 
desparation and general loathing, drove down the parkway to the 
Northwest Trading Post to see what a "good" concession looked like, 
it is indeed an interesting concession, started some years ago as 
an outlet for a local NG craft guild; mewspaper clippings on the walls 
tell this story. Good books, no records, good foods, and nice quilts. 
Fog on the parkway all the way back. 
That night Gerri and I had set up a session with Mr. Jess Higgins. 
Higgins is preacher of a Baptist church we had recorded earlier, and 
president of the fox hunters association we had taped and photographed. 
We had asked to cane out and deliver some photos to him, as well as 
record he and his wife doing their tape for their Sunday morning radio 
show heard over Galax radio WBOB. They told Gerri that they didn't tape 
until pretty late Saturday night, so as to get all cards and letters in, 
and to get all last minute information about the sick and ill. 
Both were polite enough (Mr. Higgins was gone to the hospital to 
visit sick when we arrived), but distant; we went on and taped their 
radio show. They do it in their bedroom bn Mr. Higgins' Wollensack. 
He props it up on a book because he found out if he doesn't the bands 
slip and make it run faster than the machines at the station. They used 
one mike. He read the announcements that his wife had typed out on cards, 
then they sang two songs; he often stopped the machine to check on 
playback quality. After they had done all this, he timed it,aand determined 
how much time he had for a sermon. Tonight it was 1? minutes. 
As he preached, I outlined the sermon on the tape box, mostly 
to save time logging. Afterwards, he asked to see the tape box; he was 
pleased that I had really listened to the sermon enough to outline it, 
that I got his scripture references correct, and that I had quoted him 
verbatim once or twice. After that, he loosened up a lot, and began talking 
about his religion in general. He and his wife offered to sing us some 
more songs from the little Coble (?) hymnals, and they wound up singing 
for several hoursj old tunes, songs with different melodies, old ways 
of singing, etc. etc. A fine, wonderful survey of Primitive Baptist 
hymnody. ( Cf. tapes for more info). They had several older Primitive 
Baptist hymn books there, and sang some out of them. Later he talked 
articulately of the "music" of the fox hunt, and about the democratic 
ideals of the church. About 11 they made sandwiches and coffee and we went 
on with the discus si cxi. Apparently, he often doesn't get a satisfactory 
"take" of his sermon until 1 or 2 o clock in the morning; then they take 
the tape and leave it at the radio station, in the door. But tonight the 
take was good. He said, "I'm really happy that something that started off 
so uncertain (i.e., our relationship with him) has turned out so well." 
Good. 
Field notes 
Sunday, 2\\ September 1978 
This morning talked Blanton into going out and covering the Skyline 
Baptist Church (near Orchard Gap, off the Parkway) with the twin-Nagra- 
and parallel connector hook-up. This was the church I had hoped to do, 
since Thurman Largen is song-leader there, and had bragged to me about how 
much of a "barroom*' piano player they had there on Sundays. But I had also 
set up a meeting at Is00 in Hillsville, and didn't really think I could make 
both places. So I took the mixer (for the afternoon session) and went with 
Gerri Johnson to the Faith Mission Temple in Galax (behind the bowling alley 
on the Hillsville highway). Gerri was interested in hearing a woman preacher 
there. Left about 10:30. 
The Faith Mission Temple is little more than a converted house with 
a large sign by the parking area which reads: Welcome, if you come to worship 
with us. Otherwise, No Trespassing." We arrived during Sunday School. I 
discretely entered, looking for the preacher, found her sitting in the 
class being held in the auditorium. I asked if I could be setting up the 
mikes as they finished Sunday School class, but she said. No, I should wait. 
I retired to the outside, began putting up mikes and stands, and had barely 
finished when we suddenly heard singing inside. We had ejected they would stop 
and break after Sunday school, but they didn't. So we rushed two omni-directional 
Sennheisers on stands into the back of the auditorium and hoped for the best. 
It wasn't much. The sound was boxy, the singing rather poor, and the congregation 
hovering at around 15 or so. A strange procession of souls. We had been 
talking earlier about hew healthy, well-adjusted, and generally interesting 
most of the Primitive Bcptist groups had been. This doesn't seem to extend to 
this group. 
Later we found ait that apparently they had expected us to tape Sunday 
School as well as service, and had been miffed by our intrusion. Gerri had tried 
to call this preacher the night before but had not gotten through, and hence 
the confusion. 
The preaching was sort of average, and nothing much unusual: low key, 
Norman Vincent Peale type. Modem instrumentation, all electric. One of the 
trios had published an 8-track tape (in the artifact box), and at the end 
(after the sermon) there was a song ot two by a children's trio that was sort 
of nice. But I wasn't overly impressed, and Gerri and I would probably have 
cancelled out on the whole thing had there been a graceful way to do so. Did 
3 reels of tape, and got a fistful of tracts. Gerri talked more with the 
preacher later on; cf. her notes. 
At 1:00 went to the Hillsville radio station WHHV to meet with Russ 
Pomeroy and a man named Jack Dunnavant. Dunnavant had beai after Russ to set 
up a recording session in his front room and broadcast it in the air as a 
good vibes family old-timey music get together sort of thing. (I think, so 
help me, he was tiying to recreate the Dirt Band album's "Circle Be Unbroken" 
atmosphere.) Russ asked if I would be interested, I said yes, and Dunnavant 
eagerly set it up. 
8-24-78, page 2 
Dunnavant told me he was an old-time music promoter, and had booked 
all sorts of bluegrass bands, including for a time promoting the Blue Sky- 
Boys. He lives high on a hill east of Hillsville, and you can see for miles 
off the top of the plateau. To get to his house, go out 58 east from Hillsville, 
turn onto 820 at the Fremont Church, and go about 3 miles to Dunnavant’s house 
on the right. 
Jack B. Dunevant 
Rt. 3, Box 73 
Hillsville VA 24343 
(703) 728-9469 
There were about a dozen people there when I arrived, and it was immediately 
apparent that I was walking into a contrived affair. Dunevant (correct spelling 
with an ’e’) had seen my name on some Rounder and County records and decided 
that I had an 'in' with these companies, and decided that this was an audition 
for a possible LP. I tried ray best to discourage this (I had been hampered by 
this before) and to explain the LC idea, but it was obvious that throughout the 
session LC was a secondary objective for at least Dunevant. 
This group struck me as being a reasonably sophisticated group who were 
playing foxfire with old time music. 2 of them taught college, one had played 
rock, and Dunevant himself was scurrying around offering newcomers ’’mixed 
drinks.” Yet most of them were genuine products of the culture itself, even If 
they had come to music late. The two exceptions were, oddly enough, Dunevant 
himself (who had learned a lot of nice old songs from his folks) and Raymond 
Melton, the famous dulcimer player fron Woodlawn, who had been recorded by LC 
as far back as the 1930's. Apparently MBlton has been playing in a square 
dance band with two other musicians at this session, fiddler Dea Felts and her 
husband banjoist Melvin Feltsj they call theraselces the Blue Sky Ramblers and 
we have other tape on than. Dea is a mediocre fiddler who came to Virginia 
from California to study chemistry at the University of Virginia; Melvin is 
apparently a native, but has only been playing 3 years. Melton is certainly 
the ^arkplug of the group, and seems to be sort of apprenticing Dea; he 
plays fiddle breakdowns on the dulcimer with wonderful ease. Other people 
on the session included Jack Dunevant, guitar and cheerleadingj his son 
Jackie (about 20) an guitar; and his college teaching wife Mildred clacking 
the spoons. Later on their daughter Susan, about 14 or so, did some lovely 
singing with her mother and by herself. 
Hooked ip the mixer in the following way: Senn 404, fiddle/banjo; 
Senn 404, dulcimer; 2 Neuman KM84's, guitars; Shure SM 61, spoons; Shure 
SM 61, vocal mike for Jack. (Vocals with Susan and Mildred into Neumans). 
The SM6l vocal mike on Jack seemed to be shredding the sound at times 
and finally dropped it out, repositioning the Sennheisers. Checked Shure 
later but couldn't find trouble. 
We got some fair stuff, though Dunevant (who played a nice rhythm guitar) 
kept wandering off microphone in his enthusiasm; haidly ever got any of his 
vocals on mike. Best things were dulcimer duets between Jfelton and Jack's son, 
one dulcimer in each channel. 
Melton (Woodlawn) a genuinely nice guy and hope to interview him and 
record him more at length later. Said he was on disability and at home a lot. 
?' 2-~?8 p+-y- 3 
Beneath his facade of self-conscious posing, Dunnevant probably knows 
some interesting stuff: songs, stories, etc., if I fed time to drag it 
out of him. His father-in-law, in his 90's, was a witness to the Allen 
shoot out in Hillsville, and a good story teller, but didn’t have time to 
meetbwith him. 
Field notes 9-25-78 
Spent the morning logging and^ dubbing, mostly trying to get the 
Schuyler tapes to sound decent. Then in the afternoon, went to 
see Boyden Carnenter. Mr. Carpenter lives north of Winston Salem 
near Walkertown, out of the area, but he was bom in Sparta and spent 
his early music career billing himself as "The Hillbilly Kid fran 
Alleghany County North Carolina" and did ccmedy routines featuring 
jckes based on happenings around his native county. He was one of the 
first area musicians to turn professional and try to exploit the 
traditions of the area in a ccmmercial way, and worth talking to. 
One of the stories he told me when tape had quit; he moved to Galax 
about 1915 or so, and told of the first train to cane to Galax. 
"Then they were all busy bringing logs and cross ties and tar in 
from back in those hills, and when the first train came through 
people came out of the hills on fobt, in horse carts, in steer 
wagons, to see it. And they told of this one old couple who were 
sitting there right up next to the track in their steer wagon full of 
hay and the train pulled up next to them, and the old woman says, 'Listen 
to that poor thing, just panting for breath, and sweating and blowing 
that way,1 and the old manaays, 'I'll warrant the poor thing is hungry, 
I'm going to give her sane hay," and he picthed a forkfull of hay onto 
the cowcatcher. 
Carpenter is an alert 70=year old who has had two recent operations, 
one for throat cancer, one for cancer near the kidney. The former 
destroyed his ability to sing, though he has cassette tapes of his 
singing about five years ago. He has made sane cassettes up fran these 
and loans them out, and each one has a plug for the Raleigh products 
which he sells, along with his phone number, etc. As a performer, he 
was pretty stagey during the interview, but he is still a good story 
teller even if he can't sing. He complained several times about his 
financial straits; the operations have really strapped him, and he 
had recently to sell his guitar to help pay medical bills. 
Carpenter did knew Ernest Thompson, the blind singer from Winston 
who made some pioneering records for Columbia, nd in fact went to 
record with him. 
Carpenter's cwn ccmmercial discography is rather brief: 
Jan 22 1930 Richmond Indiana, Starr Piano Company (Gennett, Champion, etc.) 
Bring Back My Blue Eyed Boy rejected 
Billy Boy rejected 
September 13, 1932 same as above 
Old Grey Goose is Dead Champion 16519 
Hobo's Convention Champion 16519 
Also he has a songbook, as well as an old printed skit about Alleghany 
County that he developed from oral routines over the years [cf attached] 
Back by 6.00, more dubbing and logging. Did most of Carpenter's cassettes 
and will get them in mail back to him tomorcow. No time to do an extensive 
log on all of them. 
Field notes Tuesday 26 September 1978 
Day started off bad, but turned out CK. Constant hassles until 
noon with the motel switchboard, unable to get phone calls in. Runners 
with messages all morning. Then about noon got out to a) tape Tobacco 
auction in Mfc. Airy, b) do a short interview and borrow tapes frcm Ralph 
Epperson, WPAQ, c) do a substantial interview with AP Thompson, and d) 
visit the Schuylers and return their gospel music tapes. 
Blanton Owen had been documenting the tobacco harvesting process of 
one Tim Slate, a young tobacco farmer, and today Tim was selling his crop 
at auction. Blanton was unable to go, and Lyntha and I went to get photos 
and at least seme informational tape. Finally recognized Tim frcm his 
photos I had seen in oroof stage, and followed him thru the process. He 
had six piles of tobacco, and got frcm $118 to $155 a- pound for them (running 
about 135-140 lbs. per pile): the whole season reduced to a hasty bidding 
that lasted less than a minute over his crop. Tim was happy, though, and 
said that our interviewing him behind the bidders had helped raise the price 
he got. Here again we inadvertently became part of the process we were 
supposed to be documenting. 
Since I got out of the auction (at the New Farmers Warehouse on 601 
toward Dobson) early (about 1:30) I decided to take a chance, follow 
Russ Pomeroy's advice, and try to get hold of Epperson (Ralph Epperson), 
who had for years been with WPAQ in Mt Airy, and had been a prime force in 
old time music in the area. Epperson had been recording in a makeshift studio 
at the station since the late forties, and had done seme pioneering work with 
bluegrass and old time bands. He did the "hemer recordings" of Spangler that 
County brought out last year, and County has plans for 2 more LPs drawn from 
Epperson's work. Pomeroy said the attic of WPAQ was full of Epperson heme 
discs that he had discarded because of faulty starts, mistakes, etc. 
I explained to Epperson on the phone that I wanted to borrow seme of 
his tapes to copy to get a flavor of old time music in context of the area: 
preferably tapes with commercials intact, etc. He said he had many cassettes 
done at home as air checks, and after some hesitation agreed to loan me 
a few. I drove to his heme at 312 Robin Road , Mt Airy [phone 919-786-6498] 
where I was let in by a black maid, allowed to sit for a while, and 
finally greeted by Epperson, a youthful looking man in his early 50's. 
He is obviously a sound man (into sound reproduction) and asked about the 
kind of equipment we had for dubbing. The Nakamichi impressed him sufficiently. 
He asked about getting LC tapes of the local Material they had recorded over 
the years. I explained about theAAFS series of LPs, and the procedures you 
must go through to get tapes. He seamed disappointed that radio stations 
couldn't get such stuff free. 
He talked for a bit about the "Saturday Morning Merry Go Round" — 
it's been a live Saturday morning show in Mt Airy for over 30 years, 
and it always features local talent. Over the years the station has 
seen stars like Mack Wiseman(in 1950), Rudy Lyle; Ben Jarrell used 
to perform live with Uncle Joe Johnson; the Franklin Bros, used to play, 
and Bill Franklin new lives in Roanoke and has records out. For Tommy 
Jarrell's birthday, they had a special all day show with Tommy in tribute. 
Sometimes the bands don't make it mo in time for the show, and they 
play studio tapes of the bands they have on file until all the band members 
wander in and then go live. 
field notes 9-26-78, page 2. 
I'm not sure how many tapes Epperson has, but it orobably runs 
into the dozens, or hundreds, all of rather good quality mono sound. 
What amazes me is the fact that they can find so many live area bands to 
feature a different one each week — and that the show is so popular 
with local advertisers. 
Yet here is Eoperson, this fan of old time music, very knowledgable 
in it, in this*80,o6o house, with his maid, his Montavani records on 
music center console stereo, his pile of ^ospejh LPs he has been sent 
for review. 
To contrast, left him and drove 20 minutes up 89 to Lowgap to 
see AP Thompson, one of the original Red Fox Chasers, one of the 2 most 
successful record -making string bands of the 1920's in our study area 
(along with Dacosta Woltz). He was frank, honest, gracious about his 
life as a gospel singer and a member of the RFC band. County has one LP 
reissue on the band out, had planned another but ran into difficulties of 
some sort with someone's family (Miles?). Most of the good stuff here is 
tape, and orobably a good article on the band needed here too. ideally 
enjoyed Thompson; he's a resiliant man, having lost a wife and two kids 
in sudden and tragic ways. His data: 
Phone 919-352-W75 
Address: Lowgap, highway 89. 
The Schuylers gracious as usual; dropped off tapes, as well as 
two R/R dubs made for them. Mr Schuyler wanted me to photograph 
a strange locking tool he had found. I did. None around here knows what 
it is, ■unless a hide scraper. It was found at the scene of a burglary. 
Schuyler won't rest until he finds out what it is; even our friend 
Easter doesn't know. "I get to trying to figure it out," Schuyler says, 
"and I egt so puzzled I get dizzy." 
Enough. In dubbing tapes. Sleeping. 
Field notes, 2? September 1978 (Wednesday) 
This morning went out to visit J*C. Pierce, a local ballad singer 
and former Galax policeman. All evidence indicated that Pierce should 
be a real treat; he had recorded on a local two interesting regional 
ballads dealing with the Allen tragedy and the story of Gaty Sage, kid¬ 
napped by the Indians in 1792; he had been recorded several times in the 
late 1930's-early 19li0's for LC by Lomax; he was the nephew of Wade Ward; 
he was alert, chipper, and a highly reputable clock maker. In spite of 
all this, the session was not successful, and the morning was a waste of 
time. 
In the first place, Pierce was very self-conscious about the tape 
recorder and abput his singing. Though he is a genuine product of the 
area, he got some formal music training and by the mid-19i|0's was 
singing in local gospel quartets. His notion of "good singing" is thus 
quite formal: clean, clear, on pitch, hardly ornamented at all. And 
this is the way he sang for me this morning. A sort of Galax Vernon. 
Dalhart. Everything about Pierce and his wife is this way, though: 
clean, neat, simple, and well done. His clocks are even that way: curiously 
sterile. 
Because of this, Pierce does not trust his memory in singing songs. 
He insisted on having words to each song before him as he sang. After 
he sang the ballad of Caty Sage, he declined to re-do the Allen song 
because it was too difficult to get on one take. He played a tape he had 
made of himself singing and harmonizing with himself about 10 years ago 
and he really wanted me to dub that tape for my session with him. I simply 
could not get anything spontaeneous out of the man. Like a TV singer 
who wanted to lip synch so he wouldn't make a mistake. Finally asked 
him to sing some other old songs ("maybe some of those your mother used 
to sing") and he said, "Fine," and drug out a pile of Good Old Days 
magazines (and some of a companion volume called Old Songs, or something 
like that) and started leafing through them. (I noticed he had been 
subscribirg to it; address plates still on issues.) He would come to 
a song and recognize it, say that his mother used to sing that, and do it. 
Then, half way through, he would stop and say something like "Mother didn't 
sing it that way." 
Well, this went on for about an hour, and I finally tried to get him 
out of P gear by asking about his days as a Galax policeman. He did tell 
a few stories, but he's again so cautious and tentative that I realized 
he was not really telling the whole thing. 
I did get a fix on Pierce's interesting musical history. Apparently 
he played with a string band in 19i|.U at the Galax convention, and won first 
prize singing "Caty Sage" in the singing competition. The band also 
included Walter Catron on fiddle and Glen (Doc) Musser on banjo; the 
band itself won second prize in the band contest that year, and Doc won 
2nd on banjo, and Walter 2nd on fiddle. This victory led to an invitation 
for all of them to come to the National Folk Festival that next year, where 
they were apparently recorded again. As a result of this acclaim, they 
Field notes 
9-27-78 page 2 
decided about this time to form a regular band. They did, and since they 
were all members of the Moose club, called their outfit The Moose Melody 
Boys (cf. photos). Identification on this photo (and personnel) is: 
standing, LR: Robert Catron (guitar), Walt Hanks (bass), JC Pierce (silver 
steel guitar); seated, LR: Ivey Bully Williams (comedian, now lives in 
Carsonville), Glen (Doc) Musser (banjo), Walter Catron (fiddle), and 
Harold Williams (comedian). This band played foe a few years, broke up, and 
after the war Pierce got involved in gospel music. He sung with a number 
of quartets, including a local group called the Four Tones, which 
broadcast over Mt. Airy, recorded a few 78s for a label called Folk Star, 
and included as bass singer the father of Kyle Barker, and grandfather 
of Kylene Barker, the current Miss America. Pierce had sone tapes of 
these old records, which were interesting. He also has a scrapbook 
with lots of pictures of gospel quartets in it, testifying that he has 
knom or worked with some top names in the business. Scrapbook also 
contains clippings about Uncle Charlie Higgins, the old fiddler, who was 
Mrs. Pierce's uncle. Scrapbook groups: Sunshine Boys, Homeland Harmoneers, 
John Daniel Quartet. 
The Pierces, live in a neat little modern house near the Coal Creek 
Community off the Piper’s Gap road out of Galax. 
Here again we have another example of the Galax conversion pattern: 
good musicians who start out playing traditional or bluegrass music 
and then move into gospel music. With Pierce it was not so much a sudden 
change (at least he doesn't admit to it), but prcbably a case of upward 
mobility: good singing meant clean, propersinging, and church singirg. 
Pierce is not ashamed of old time music, though, and in fact is quite 
self-conscious about preserving it. But he has gotten a lot of his songs 
through media sources. I think he sensed that I was unhappy with the 
session, but was as usual very pleasant. 
I hao used ray last reels of tape with Pierce and the mail never brought 
the new supplies, so I decided that afternoon to record Paul Miles on 
a Sony cassette. After talking to Miles, I didn't really expect to get 
anything much except information, so it seemed this would be appropriate. 
ililes lives at Cherry Lane, just off the Parkway down by Sparta NC. 
He lives in a little house right on the main highway. He, of course, was 
the banjo player and acknowledged leader of the Red Fox Chasers, and I 
wanted to interview him to complement my interview with A.P. Thompson, the 
other surviving member of the group. He was in much worse physical shape 
than Thompson; he has had a couple bf strokes (he kept his rigjit hand in 
a glove all the time) and had to wear dark glasses while I was there. 
He speaks in a slow and halting manner, but after he gets interested, he does 
have a lot toisay: his manory is good yet, andhe gave me some fine colorful 
details about his early recording days.

With Miles was a son, fiftyish and taciturn, •who stood around 
impatiently waiting for me to finish with his father. He did loosen 
up a little toward the end, but was not at all interested in what was 
going on. Miles showed me the old Gibson 1928 banjo he had made the 
records with — still in fine shape — and said he had a picture of the 
Red Fox Chasers at their still. This was a publicity photo that the 
company splattered all over the countryside when their take off on a 
"Com Licker Still in Gerogia" came out. Miles is sure he has one, and 
promises to send it alongj I left him an envelope for this. 
Paul Miles phone number and address: (919) 363-2281, c/o Glade Valley, 
NC, Route # 1, Box 200, zip 28627. 
After I left Miles, went over to see the old store his father owned 
(about a half mile down the county road next to his house); this was a 
rather famous gathering place for musicians in the area, and was made famous 
by Boyd Carpenter's famous comedy routine and by the frequent use cf the 
place by the Fox Chasers for rehersal. Took some b/w photos. 
ifiles confirmed that his sen Wade Miles sings with the Walker Family, 
doing unaccompanied gospel. I had learned that the Walker Family (from 
Sparta) had broken up, but Miles said they still sung. (He was wrong.) 
Field notes, Thursday, 28 September 
This morning went to collect Carl F. at airport, and spent 
most of the rest of the day doing odd things around the office. 
Tuesday afternoon Jim Marshall had called me, and said he had 
gotten Rafe Brady to agree to come to his store and record Thursday 
night. I had already lined up the Brooks Family (The Peaceful Valley 
Quartet) from Ennice NC to record that night, but I called them 
and was able to rearrange them for Friday night. Marshall had 
said that there was really no flexibility in getting Rafe. 
I have been hearing about Rafe Brady since I got here. He 
is a honest-tQ-God local legend who began playing in the 1930's 
and by the sixties everyone thought he was deadj someone found him 
working in the fields down at Cana, and then his nephew brought 
him up to Laurel Fork (where he was originally from) and somewhat 
dried him out and got him to playing again. The crew had taped some 
of Rafe at a Fancy Gap square dance, but he apparently was so drunk 
he could hardly i±fc stand up. Here was a chance to get Rafe early 
in the evening, with congenial musicians, before too much drinking 
had occurred. I couldn't pass it up. 
Rafe had played with Ernest Stoneman in the 1930's, and Bill 
Monroe had tried to recruit him in 19l;0 to replace Tommy Magness in 
his band. (Magness knew and played with Brady, and had recommended 
him.) Rafe also played with Roy Hall for a time, and had taught 
Waybum Johnson (who has recorded for County as the Foothill Boys) 
his style. He lias written a number of songs — not oniy fiddle 
instrumentals but full-fledged songs which he sings — and has a 
wonderftal repertoire. I couldn't really explore it too well tonight, 
because Rafe had to play tunes his back up men knew, and there were 
enough there to require fairly common tunes. Also, Rafe's t»manager,i* 
and nephew, Donald B. Brady, while having a fine notion of what 
Rafe's music is and its importance, tends to think in terms of fiddle 
standards like "Black Mountain Rag** and '‘Mocking Bird." (I think he 
may be coasting a little on Rafe's reputation, backing him on guitar 
and selling him as living legend, etc.) 
Donald has Rafe up in Hlllsville now (address Route 2, Hillsville) 
helping him pick his cabbage; apparently he has a pretty large farm, 
and Rafe works for him cm a fairly strict basis. 
Rafe himself is absolutely fascinating} certainly the most interesting 
fiddler I've found on the trip. He dances around a lot when he plays, 
^?3he0nhgiir!SeW!Ml Sll^063' Hb 
down onto his check, and rocks it occasionally as needed to get notes, 
and his arm is incredibly active. He was hard to mike, as he continually 
moved around. He can do trick fiddling, and demonstrated this on "East 
Tennessee Blues." The Silers were there and photographed am lot of him 
and we taped 5 reels. All the time Rafe was insisting that the next tune 
would be "Home Sweet Home"; he was quite surly at first, but loosened up 
by the end of the session. Jim and Artie Marshall played banjo and guitar, 
and Donald played guitar. 
Field notes 
Friday 29 September 1978 
Most of the day spent in disassembling the office, dubbing, and 
catching loose ends. 
At 7:00 went to Ennice to see the Brooks Family and record them. 
A notice on the door met he; there had been a death in the family, and 
the group had to be at the funeral home that night. Back around 9:00 
and would still try to record then if I wanted. They had tried to phone 
me earlier, but, in true MLdtowner style, the message never got to me. 
I felt it would be both impractical and intrusive to record them later, 
and need the time to pack anyhow, so I left them a note thanking them 
and promising to write them later for copies of their records. 
Since I never taped an interview with this group, it is probably 
appropriate to enter here some of the material I did gather on them 
on the 20th. Audrey and Carol Brooks formed a quartet about 15 years 
ago and called it The Peaceful Valley Quartet. Carol Brooks sanf soprano, 
and her husband Audrey played guitar, sang lead, and wrote a lot of the 
group’s gospel-sentimental material. This group toured widely in the area, 
getting as far away as Akron Ohio. Their style comes from the Chuck Wagon 
Gang, and they sound very much like them on their records. I commented 
on this to Carol Brooks, and she said, '*Yes, that’s what everybody said.11 
They achieved this sound deliberately, and their biggest thrill was to once 
get to perform with the Chucks on a concert stage. 
From about 1966, the group appeared every Sunday afternoon over 
station WB0B in Galax, and then moved to a Sunday morning show over 
WC0K in Sparta for a year. Carol Brooks had to undergo surgery on her 
throat in 1968, and this caused problems; after another bout of throat 
problems, the doctors told her that if she didn't stops singing soprano 
she well might lose her voice entirely. So the quartet was broken up 
about 1973 or so. 
The discography of the group includes 2 LPs and U lj.5s. Their first 
record "was a custom 3P ij.5 with U songs, which they still have copies of; 
the label reads, PEACEFUL VALLEY QUARTET OF ENNICE, NC. They did three 
singles, including: 
Jesus Savior Pijot Lfe/l Wonder if Mother Knows 6-65i|.l A & B 
Lord Will Make a Way Somehow/ 
I'll Walk and Talk with my Lord 6-651*2 A & B 
These singles were on plain white labels, custom pressed. A third single/ 
1*5 "was issued on Pyramid, a label started by Arthur Smith expressly for 
the group. He was supposed to promote this release (have copy), but according 
to Carol Brooks did not; they also suspect he was somehow trying to gain 
publishing rights to ixm Audrey's original songs. 
9-29-78, continued 
Their first LP (called The Peaceful Valley Quartet) was a 
custom job with a black and white photo on the front, and literally 
nothing on the back. It contained their most popular song, and 
apparently theme song, "Peaceful Valley is Horae," written by 
Brooks. They sold out their first pressing and went through three 
more (probably of 900 each) before they decided rising costs on 
repressing were just too much. The LP is now out of print. A 
second LP, same title, with a blue cover, different tunes, came out 
about 1972; it is still in print. 
Most of the records;'; were recorded in Charlotte, at the 
Arthur Smith studios. 
The Brooks have started singing again recently, with Carol singing 
alto; they now sing with their two teenaged sons filling out the 
quartet, though they "own" the name Peaceful Valley Quartet and if 
they decide to start singing more publicly again will use it again. 
Brooks himself is a plumber or contractor,and they also raise tobacco; 
in fact, they could not record the week I found them because thqy 
were working almost around the clock to get in their tobacco into 
the barns. 
To get to the Brooks house, go through Ennice toward Sparta, 
take road lii39 south off of highway 18, bear left at the crossroads, 
and their house is the first on the left. Address? Aubrey Brooks, 
Route 1, Box 36, Ennice NC. Phone? (919) 637-3290. 
Final observations? though very traditional in sound, the Brooks 
were in some ways more "professional" than many other gospel groups 
I found in the area. No overbearing church affiliation, and a lot 
of concern about song copyrights, getting ripped off by record 
producers, etc. Carol Brooks chain smoked while I was there, and 
thqy seem to be as interested in straight country music as gospel. 
Somebody at the Lowe*s house told me (I think it was Joanne Munk) 
that they had quit gospel altogether, and she was somewhat sarcastic 
about it. Lowe himself had never even heard of them, which does in 
fact date their popularity, I guess.

Twas the night before Christmas when all thru the house 
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. 
The kids were in bed and were sleeping like dogs. 
And I was up late trying to finish my logs. 
I'd lost all my maps and my notes were askew. 
And the tapes and the photos and slides all looked new. 
No one looked familiar, and nothing looked right. 
So I gave up and headed to bed for the night. 
I tucked in my kerchief and settled to bed. 
But visions of MIDTOVJNER flashed thru my head. 
Of Dilly Beans, Sweet Sue's, dried apples galore. 
All Galaxative blessings and other such lore. 
Then out on the lawn there arose such a clatter 
That I leaped from my bed to see what was the matter, 
A tall lanky man in a GSA heap. 
Was lifting a Nagra from out the back seat. 
He jumped in the chimney and fell with a crash. 
And rolled out the fireplace all covered with ash, 
And went to my stocking and sat down his pack. 
And I saw GOOD LISTENER writ on his back. 
And he stuffed all my stockings with field notes and maps. 
Then went to the icebox and got him a Pabst. 
Then with a flashout he leaped to his car. 
And I heard him shout as he yelled from afarj 
"On Dobbins, and Delhart, and Sparta so finel 
And Baywood and Traphill and Toast and Wbolwine! 
On Galax, and Laurel Fork, and Stuart so bland. 
And Hillsville and Coal Creek and Meadows of Dan, 
Dash away, stash away, hash away each. 
And send them in care of the old AFC1"

Here is a dub of the nysterious Mullen cassette with the 
old fiddler who sings hymns and plays a neat solo fiddle. 
The outstanding selections here are the first three: 
0-72 Lonely Tombs — Pruitt, fiddle & vocal 
89-159 Jesus is Coining Soon - Pruitt, fiddle & vocal 
174- I Remember the Time - Pruitt, fiddle & vocal (outstanding) 
219 fiddling integrated into singing here 
It may be very hard to hear his singing, but singing he is, in a 
fine, Carsonesque voice. 
I am wondering if this in fact is a guy named Dewey Pruitt who 
who shows up in Blanton's tape logs as "Dewey Truitt" from 
Sparta N.C. McCamant did these logs, and he could have missed 
the names. Blanton recorded him making molasses, but nothing 
about fiddling. 
After listening to these again, I am even more adamant about 
trying to get some good tape on the man. I think we should 
commission Hartman to do a reel or two, let us choose what may 
be of use on the LP (if any), and give him rights to use other 
stuff later on. It is going to be an interesting chore to 
record a fellow singing and fiddling at the same time; I have 
had fits trying to do it before. Eken with a "voice" mike, the 
fiddle is so close that it gets in there a lot. It would be 
an interesting technical challenge, anyway.
