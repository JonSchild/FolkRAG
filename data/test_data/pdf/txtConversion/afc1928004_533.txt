Skipping with Burdelia, 
Through the grand easlia, 
Promenading whit my darling, 
Round and round so gay. 
The most enlrancing ones at dancing, 
In the hall are we, 
The prize we take, likewise the cake, 
At the Finegin Corterie. 
CHORUS. 
Over the floor we gracefully slide, 
In the liosliton dip and the Hoboken glide, 
All the dizzy dancers 
In the ball Poon envy me, 
And fat Burdalia's long tail dress, 
At the Finegin Corterie.

You will find us in the van ;

The tallow dips in beauty. 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen ; 
A 
kitchen full of dancers, 
in a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS. 
Rise It, Reilly! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly ! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout, Rise it Reilly! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd acorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor. 
The — Rocky Road" is startin', 
A 
tune they love so well, 
'Ti. now the ruction boomin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
A 
few nate words of blarney, 
To some bright buxom lass, 
.A few clean swigs of potheen, 
Widout the aid of glass. 
And soon the shrieks of music, 
Their notes a 
warning ring, 
When up and once again 
They dunce and wildly sing.

There's a 
dear spot of land fat out on the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be- sure, all the while 
They shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
but the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Nobler sous, truer daughters, than tnem. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellingtln, while 
King Brian liorogline, and our bold Emmett too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarni,y 
lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and line 
Sure the valley's and mountaids One Etcocd to none. 
For their boauty i•4 really Eublitne 
There grows iii
prOftl8i1111 the dear 1.ttle shamrock,

Dear land of-my birth, garden sit of the earth,

Obsarve a

ho stands before you here, 
The great and conquerin' Looney tis„ 
Whom no one yet could queer. 
They all can twist and throw and toss, 
And make a 
dizzy fall, 
But with me none can hould their heels, 
For 1 
can down them all, 
CHORUS, 
Yes, I 
can down them all, 
On me they get no fall, 
I 
pin their shoulders to the floor, 
For I 
can down them all. 
When up forninst me they do stand, 
I 
grip their hoofs just so, 
It's lightnin' points I 
give them all, 
In 
collar and elbow." 
I 
get the hip-lock on them, 
Then I 
hug them until they bawl. 
I'd crack their necks if they'd not drop, 
For I 
can down them all, 
ni toss Muldoon and Bauer too, 
And make McLaughlin sick, 
I'll break the hoult of Miller 
With my Greco Roman kick. 
I'll throw a 
giant or a 
ghost, 
A horse or a 
stone wall, 
I'll even wrastle with a 
mule, 
/For I 
can down them all.

Will be sent by us post paid, to any address, on eceipt or

I 
live with Widow Higgins, 
In her famous boarding house, 
Which used to be before my time, 
As quiet as a 
mouse. 
But with my sweet accomplishments, 
And style so very cute, 
There's lots of fun for every one, 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
CHORUS. 
Tootle-e-
toot. I 
play the flute, 
So lively and so gay, 
I 
charm the neighbors all around, 
And pass the time away. 
My tootle-e-toot sweetly played 
Would charm the savage ute, 
The boarders are enchanted quite, 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
Some say I'm quite distracting, 
And I 
ought to be suppressed, 
They threrten me with lynching, 
If I 
don't give them a 
rest; 
But on I 
play without dismay, 
Tho' they call me a " galoote, " 
They must not dare to interfere 
With Finnegan and his flute, 
Chorus. 
I 
don't belong to Gilmore's Band, 
Nor any hand at all, 
But play for scciability, 
At many a 
private ball. 
"1' was at Maloney's raffle 
There was such a 
great dispute, 
And down the stairs they threw at once, 
Both Finnegan and his flute. 
Chorus. 
I 
charm sweet widow Biggins, 
And her daughter Rosy Jane ; 
We duet on the piano 
With such a 
sweet refrain. 
And if she does not smile on me, 
Or her sweet voice is mute, 
I 
go into the parlor, and 
I 
charm her with my flute. 
Chorus.

We've heard martial songs and songs of the sea, 
Comic songs, and love songs, but they don't suit me, 
We love to sing of Ireland sweet land of our birth, 
I'm Paddy her sou, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh! Erin, my country it grieves us to see, 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we're not free, 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the son's of Erin's Isle, 
Hurrah for the daughters who on us do smile, 
A 
fig for her foes wherever they may be, 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Arise sons of Erin, add prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled, 
United all like brothers we'll join hand in hand, 
'We'll drive the proud Saxon away from our land. 
The land is the people's and who dare dispute, 
The word of our Maker, for He spoke the truth, 
Then descend from the hill and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin.

'P? 
Good evening, kind friends, I'll sing you a 
ditty,l/ 
It's of dear old Ireland the sweet land of song, 
I 
will sing you of heroes, of men iron- hearted, 
Of brave ones, and of true ones, to Ireland belong, 
For the day we are longing when we'll see Erin free, 
And all sons of Ireland strike for liberty, 
For starved and oppressed. they're stricken with awe, 
They're driven from Ireland, and Erin go Bragh. 
CHORUS. 
Then farewell to Ireland, the place I 
was born in, 
Farewell to Erin, the fairest of earth, 
Farewell till liberty on us is dawning, 
Farewell to Ireland the land of my birth. 
The sweet girls of Erin are hopeful yet weeping, 
They're singing for freedom which to them belong. 
And the heroes of Ireland whose name I 
will mention, 
Whoce fame in Irish hisery is inerked very strong. 
There was Daniel O'Connell a 
well known hero bold, 
And breve Robert Emmett, we're always been told, 
They fought for old Ireland were true to the core, 
They Loved that dear shamrock and Erin go Bragh.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are tr3ing the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever Pm passing, 
There's OTrien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con- nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Cho. 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brock, 
We tho t 
we'd just drop into Geoglian's. 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried, there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar- tender shot me a 
glance, 
Howld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
'1 hat's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

On the old bag- pipes he's as lively as a 
flea, 
And the jigs do spin from his violin ; 
He's a 
thoroughbred with side whiskers, 
Is my Mickey Flahrity. 
Mickey took me out flt a 
ride one day, 
In an Irish jaunting car, 
He drank so many whiskey slings, 
He was per-pen-dic-u-lar, 
Says lie, 
" 
more drink," ' twas a 
bottle of ink, 
And hi swallowed it with glee, 
"I'll lick the man," sfsys he, 
Chorus. 
" 
Who put vi negar

I 
sang in praise of kisses, 
As a 
soft and gentle hint, 
And soon upon my lips, my love 
A greeting did imprint ; 
But while intoxicated 
With its measure deep of bliss, 
Alas! my mamma witness was, 
Of our delicious kiss. 
" 
Au explanation I 
demand," 
I 
heard to my dismay, 
And in such trembling accents then, 
I 
ventured this to say.

CHORUS. 
I 
couldn't help it, ma, 
I 
really couldn't ma; 
He spoke so sweet, and said, 
I 
was his guiding star. 
He showr d 
kisses fast, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
couldn't stop his kisses, ma, 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds, 
I've surely had my share, 
From formal kiss of friendship, 
To love's salutation rare; 
But of them all I'm free to own, 
The sweetest one by far, 
Was the first kiss of love which ope'd 
The eyes of my mamma. 
Her voice how quick our dream did change, 
From pleasure unto pain, 
Ahl how I 
faltered, when in tears 
I 
softly did explain.

Last winter was a 
hard one, 1‘,1 rs. Reny' did you say, 
Well; ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGuiness didn t 
get no job at all. 
The politicians promised hint work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Alit six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dt n't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we bad plenty of our own class to ate up 'all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cenis a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring tin ir money home, taste no gin or wine, 
And that one thing Pd like to say of your old man and mine. 
Chorus. 
Ah the spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty work, 
MeGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
handsome clerk. 
You soould see him climbthe ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is always bawling, hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
Ah 1 
the old man he is always careful, nothing he lets fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at all. 
Chorus.

I 
am hard up, you don't know me, 
For my clothes are tat'r'd and torn, 
My parents died when I 
was young, 
I'm forsaken, dislikd and forlorn. 
I've travTd this country thro' and thro,' 
On the road and on the rail, 
My limbs are getting stiff and cold, 
For the want of a 
warm meal. 
CHORD. 
'They say why don't you go to work, 
Wiled they know there's none to be had, 
They slain the door in front of your face, 
If you ask them for a 
bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to door, 
And they ask for charity. 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't igipport their family, 
But place a 
fickle in their hand, 
To some grog shop they will run. 
A poor man's money they will take, 
And spend it all for rum 
CHORUS. 
Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak and sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
wodsinginan's poor family. 
'Twas at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rap,>ed at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave me bread and tea, 
Be was a 
son of Erin's Isle, 
Toiling for his family 
CHORUS 
I shook his hand so hard and tough, 
And the tears rolled fast down my fee*, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
For you're welcome always at his placto.

Oh! we landed in this country, 
At the time of the great big draft, 
We walked the town in search of work, 
,Faix we did seek for graft. 
We met a 
sergeant on the street, 
He treated us to lager beer, 
And enlisted us next morn, boys, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
CHORUS. 
We felt el gay as we marched away, 
With thoughts of ould Erin's Isle, 
Our guns shone bright in the clear sunlight,

In suits of blue we marched two by two, 
The girls gave hearty cheers, 
For old Erin's bus, brave soldier boys, 
in the Irish Volunteers. 
They dressed us up in soldier clothes, 
And faith drilled us three times a 
day, 
Received orders from head-quarters, 
To the war we marched away 
To fight the red-skin IndItns, 
And the " Nagur " fusilecrs ; 
The knapsacks were shot off our backs, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
They threw us in a 
baggage car, 
And shipped us to New York City, 
The neighbors gathered in and said, 
It's a 
shame and a 
pity 
They covered us with bread and soap, 
From our toes clean to our ears, 
We tesigned our p. st of honor, 
In the Irish Volunteers.

Darling, I 
have roamed to-day, 
'Mid the scenes of long ago ; 
*Change has taken all away, 
That we lond and cherished so. 
Time has touched both cot and tree, 
Friends we knew no more remain, 
And I 
found naught left to-day, 
But the old church down the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Dear old church down in the lane, 
It brings back with a 
fairy spell, 
Bright and beautiful ogain, 
Days, dear heart, 
re loved so well, so well. 
To its walls the ivy clings, 
And the roof was green with moss; 
Crumbling are the stones where sings, 
Lark and thrush amid the dross. 
It is going to decay. 
From the touch of time and rain, 
Just as we are love, to-day. 
Like the old church down the lane. 
Chores. 
Long I 
stood beside the door, 
Dreaming of the joys we know, 
In the golden days of yore. 
When we I 
crossed its porch with you, 
When we left it hand in hand. 
For our journey o'er life's main ; 
Drifting hack upon th , 
strand, 
To the old church down the lane.

In Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day. 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green ; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she hasn't come as yet ; 
'I he truth seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe Irr true, 
she's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS, 
Oh 1 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie 
once again! 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said you would meet me, but I've waited long in veils— 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
ner promise she will keep— oh ! break it not my Jean ! 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! theu let me long not wait, let me meet thee 
soon, my Jean, 
And the Heavens will smile on our love 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day toy infant died, 
This day one year ago 
A tender bud o 
beautiful, 
So fragile ' ,me and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's sin- tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain 
My precious darling lay; 
Their God in swe.it compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
He only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sca'ding tears will start, 
And long's, I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
I'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
Yor sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
ror on this day my baby died, 
This day one year ago.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
CHORUS. 
So for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy, 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chine the poor wanderer, friendless, afar; 
.

Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Lunging and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, dm 
Once he was pure a 
P 
the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home he has wandered a 
stranger, 
_Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamel of lost friendship and joy, 
With DO sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welc,me her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, (to. 
Go for my boy to-night ! search through the city !

Throwing pebbles in the stream.

Laughing, blue-eyed, blushing Daisy, 
Fairer than my fondest dream, 
Beat me on that summer morning, 
Throwing pebbles in the stream.

Flowing onward to the sea, 
And my heart first learned its secret, 
Daisy was so dear to me.

In Erin's isle there's many hearts, 
And bosom's pure as snow, 
In Erin's isle there's right good cheer, 
And hearts that everflow. 
In Erin's isle I'd pass my. time, 
No more I 
wish to roam, 
Oh ! steer my bark to Erin's isle. 
For Erin is my Home. 
If England was my place cf birth, 
I'd lo 's her tranquil shore ; 
If bonny Scotland was my home, 
Her mountain's I'd adore. 
But pleasant days in both I've passed, 
dream of days to come ; 
Oh ! steer my bark to Erio's 
For Erin is my home.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the ill-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay through unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos, cried, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA 
t" 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darli ng 
one; bu.t, 
alas, her efforts were in vain. The arms th at 
held 
the 
cherished 
one reiaxei their loving embrace, and when again tho mother 
beheld the little p,eatler the once bright eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

Take me in your arms dear mama, 
As the waves around us roll, 
I 
am lonely in the darkness, 
While the bells unceasing toll. 
Will there be a 
fairer Morning, 
'With the sunbeams clear and bright, 
When we both go home to papa, 
Take me in your arms to-night. 
CHORUS. 
Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight, 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the wives so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother weak and hop less, 
Praying for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader, 
Soon relaxed f 
ir strength had gone, 
And the mother broken-hearted, 
In her grief was all alone. 
'When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With the sun-heanls clear and bright, 
She went home alone to papa, 
Leaving child and love that night. 
But she often hears her darling, 
In the heartfelt pleading tone, • 
Take me in your arms, dear mamma, 
Words that come in dreams alone.

At the bright dawn of the morning,

You may see our queen of roses,

Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go itinon!!: the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with pain, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er our winsome Whittle Wane.

Once upon a time there lived a 
maiden, 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about it heavy laden, 
Grew u 
honey- suckle fair to see; 
And the maiden watched the blossoms daily, 
heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent above it singing ever gaily, 
Every bud and every blossom knew, 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Came a 
sudden dainty frown; 
Jealous was the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love she did not know, 
! 
greater love she did not know, 
Know, know, know, know, 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave, and full of manly graee s 
Whispering tender words he bent above het. 
Stooped and kissed her sunny smiling faOsi 
Underneath the honey- suckle walked they, 
But her eyes were cast demurely down; 
Seeing not as softly, sweetly talked they. 
Bow its leaves were turning sere and brows 
Withered now he tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the vine. 
Careless is the maid I 
trow, • 
Greater love bath learned to know, 
Ao! greater love ! lath learned to know, 
Know, know, know, know.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
Oen never more see, 
Flowers of the wild wood and home by the river, 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Rocks that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wildwood, 
Live only in memories chambers to-day. 
CHORUS. 
Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see; 
Flowers in the wildwou.I and home by the rivfr, 
Yes, gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Honrs of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vide and hill, 
That flowing streandet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old mill. 
Forest oi oaks where the sweet birds were singing. 
And roses abloom ' neath the fair summer sky, 
In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringinegh.
, 
Of days I 
onc e cherished f
or
ever 
gone by. orus 
Dave of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the past with their I terry good cheer ; 
Bloom of the valley from Alay to December. 
'I be snow flakes which heightened the rust of the year. 
Then in the fall, picking apples so golden, 
Or making the sugar w 
We lov e to recoun t 
jrys of 
when spri

come, 
childhood so olden, 
When sunbeams shine brightly on dear ones at home. 
Oho 
Gone are t' ,e 
days that my heart fondly cherished, 
And past are the charms I 
would love to recall ; 
Dear is the thought that when childhood's joys perished, 
The bliss of remembrance was loft to us all 
Now as down life's winding pathway I 
wander, 
My memory cling , to its past treasures yet, 
The sunshine which brigl.tened my childhood's home yonder, 
And frids ever patient I 
cannot forget.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
flushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
Au with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Dann.) 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer day is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure. 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes.

Dame.)

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle,'" 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the while. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never .go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
• • • • 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang• upon the beach began- to smile, 
'I hey all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we Wept , and , had a 
bathe, 
You nhiy talk about your fat woman 
That Crit'veled With . 
Li.
tkroun
ni's show, 
But you ought. 
Lo see my, Peg upon the waves. 
The gang cLmtmenced to guy us, 
My bosom ritt§ .on . fire.., 
When the gang gave. 
to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
"Beheave us" ehon t
ed 
put, (Chorus 
'there's one of the ses)iona that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feel Tuna,' after listening to that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if.1 had hint in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
can taka my own part all the while. 
Arrah-tnuslia' bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her bead, 
Before I'bring heragain to Coney isle.
