This area is primarily Robert Blue’s work area. In the foreground are two wheels; the one to the left is for 
throwing, and the one to the right is for trimming. In the background are shelves where pots sit while they are 
drying.

This area is primarily Robert Blue’s work area. Pots are placed on the shelf to the right—the one covered in 
plastic—to help slow down the drying process. This is called a “damp box.”

The glazing room. The table in the center has storage underneath for dry glaze materials, and the buckets contain 
glaze. This room also serves as storage space and a place for packing up orders.

These shelves in the glaze room alternately hold bisque pottery that is waiting for glaze, glazed pottery that is 
waiting to be fired, and finished pottery that is waiting to be packed and shipped.

The kiln shed. This part of the shed holds electric kilns that are used for bisquing pottery (the first of two firings, 
which stabilizes the clay before glaze is applied).

Some of Susan Blue Galloway’s pottery—pieces on top are finished, while other pieces on lower shelves were 
recently thrown and are drying.

Shelves of pottery in the kiln shed awaiting firing. These rolling carts are sometimes used to transport pots from 
the studio to the nearby kiln shed, and back again after firing.

A board full of pots waiting to be fired. Boards like this are sometimes used to carry pots from the studio to the 
kiln shed; carrying by hand is more steady than a rolling cart that might bump on the rough ground and knock 
over pots.

Susan Blue Galloway’s Geil kiln, which she purchased to use at home after her retirement from McHenry County 
College. She bought it used from the Richard E Peeler Art Center at Depauw University, where she had studied 
ceramics under Richard and Marge Peeler years earlier.

Robert Blue’s Alpine kiln, which he purchased used from Nick Nero. After realizing the kiln did not have a serial 
number, Robert learned that this was the original kiln designed by the Alpine company--the first kiln that they 
built.

to the right with the “Entrance” sign over the door. The sign to the right states “Hours by Appointment” and 
provides their phone number.
