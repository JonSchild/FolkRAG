I: 
Part 1 [15.16] Okay, so we’ve gone through the consent statement, and I want to start by saying once 
again thank you, A, for being part of this project. We feel really proud of it and honored that you’re willing to 
share your stories with us. 
P: 
Well, I’m pleased too. 
I: 
So, I’d like to start just at the beginning. I’ve been referring to the work that you do as personal care 
aide work or personal care assistance, and you’ve heard me say PCA for short. And in a minute, I’d like to talk 
about the language we use, but just for starters, can you tell us a little bit about how you got into PCA work and 
why? A little of your history. 
P: 
Well, several decades ago I began at a teaching hospital out West, and it was wonderful. I worked on a 
neurological unit. I learned a great deal. Had a wonderful time. I took some years off, and when I was needing 
to get a job again, it’s like, oh, yeah. Now, what do I do? So, I did a quick CNA course in the state of Michigan, 
and took the first job available, and it was my [inaudible – 13.43]. I worked in a long-term care facility, and just 
absolutely fell in love with my little old people. And the—everything I learned from the neurological unit could 
apply to the people—the elders who were suffering from dementia, from just lack of memory sometimes. So, I 
was hooked [laughs]. I was hooked. I can’t imagine doing anything else. I have tried. I have left for a while 
because you get tired lifting and moving and working weekends every weekend and holidays, and so I did 
leave, worked in an office. Could not deal with it, you know. I lost my little old people [laughs], so I went back 
with them. And I think I get into the—becoming a dementia care specialist and really focusing on them is—it’s 
just the most important to me. I would rather work with someone who has any form of dementia or a stroke—
someone who cannot communicate well rather than just assisted living—somebody needs help drying their 
back after a shower, you know. 
I: 
And why is that? What drives you to these people in particular? 
P: 
I had a challenging childhood. Challenging to the point where I stopped speaking for 10 years. That 
was my reaction to it, and I think because I know so well what it is to have this person in this life inside of me 
and not be able to express it. When one of my little old people, you know, I can see in their eyes they are so 
desperate to let you know something, and they cannot. I’m right there with them, and I will stay with them until 
we can, you know, figure out what this is, and comfort them. 
I: 
Can you give an example, of you know, something that stands out in your memory of some times when 
you were working with somebody who was having difficulty communicating, and you were able to use the skills 
that you learned in the neurology clinic, but also through your dementia training, how that played out? 
P: 
I think just an easy example [10.57], someone who perhaps has a stroke, and they may use a word, 
help. Family does not understand that. Family tightens up. [In an anxious voice] “What can I do? What can I 
do? How can I help you? Oh, oh, oh, come fix them.” No. Think about what’s happening in their brain. Whether 
you are suffering from some form of dementia, you have a stroke, you have a severe concussion, when the 
brain is injured, it is going to react according to what remembers just before the stroke/the concussion, 
whatever. Okay. If someone is shopping, and they suddenly fall, and they’re suffering a stroke, they are going 
to think, “Help me.” So, that word is foremost in their mind, so if you were reading with them, and they are 
coming along in the sentence and they cannot pronounce this next word, it may come out—“And then the little 
boy help, help.” Okay, so let’s go back, “And then the little boy jumped over the rock.” And then that person will 
most likely come back and be able to, with some guidance, say the word jumped and go on with the story. 
Okay, so you remember what you learned, the way the brain works there, it still applies with dementia or stroke 
or whatever [9.00] 
I: 
So, it sounds like you have found a skill, a niche, something that you feel you’re good at?

P: 
I am, and [laughing] there was a time, you know, people would say, “Oh, you’re so special.” And I would 
say, oh, no, I’m not [laughs] because I really thought everyone could do this, but I realized, no, not everyone 
can. And it is a wonderful, wonderful feeling. I mean you get tired [laughs], you know. It isn’t something that 
you—sometimes really have the energy to do one more day because you are tired, but you cannot not do it, 
you know. 
I: 
Aside from helping people communicate, which is huge and that must be very rewarding, why do you—
you said earlier, “I love this work.” Why do you love it so much? 
P: 
I’m not sure everything can be explained [7.56]. You know, there’s some things that just are. It is—we 
are who we are. When we are put on this earth, I think we all have a mission. We may or may not know what it 
is. I found mine. They’re just my little old people [laughing], is what I call them. They are—and when I got out 
for a walk, when I go out say to Panera’s [laughs], when I’m out, I watch the little old people, you know. They 
truly—I sincerely mean they are mine, each and every one of them. 
I: 
You take responsibility for them, it sounds like. 
P: 
Well, if you are out somewhere and you see an elderly person walking with a cane or a walker, and I’ve 
done restorative work for years in long-term care, so I know how you are supposed to use the walker or the 
cane, and if they are not—so that’s an accident waiting to happen. And [sighs] there are so many people who 
have simply gone out to the mailbox, they’ve gone into the kitchen to get a drink of water, they fall, they break 
their hip, they never see their home again, ever. This home that they’ve spent 30, 40, 50 years working on. 
They want to pay it off. They’ve raised their children there, and they never see it again. And there are so 
many—and not just—I don’t mean just young workers, there’s so many people who come in to work in a long-
term care facility, they go through a 2-week course. “Hey. I’m gonna go in, and I’m gonna make money.” They 
don’t understand what it is for this person to lose everything, you know. So, you see someone who is not using 
that cane correctly, you go and say, excuse me [laughs], you may think I’m a little strange, that’s okay. Let me 
help you, you know, or they simply don’t have it adjusted to the right height. That’s another accident waiting to 
happen, so you just open your big mouth and help them [laughs]. 
I: 
What do you find most challenging about this work that you do? What’s hard? 
P: 
[Deep breath] that families do not understand what’s happening, so they do not know—sometimes we 
just need to be loved the way we need to be loved, and families—families tend to love their own way. I mean 
we grow up, and we all have this little place in the family, and we tend to hold onto that personality, and then, 
you know, you go outside of the family, you may be a CEO, but in the family, you’re still the youngest, so you, 
you know? Okay. So, when something happens to mom or dad, people fall apart. They don’t—they do not 
know how to handle it. That’s probably the toughest part for me right there. I have worked where—I would work 
somewhere for years, and there were so many people who did not have one visitor, or the visitors would come 
in and stand in the doorway and go, “Yup. There she is. How’s she look to you?” “Pretty good.” “Okay. Well, 
let’s go,” you know.  
I: 
Because they can’t handle it or for whatever reason? 
P: 
For whatever reason, and you just wanna take them and say, please. Come, sit. You know, talk to 
them. There was one woman, she could not speak, she could not move her body. The only part [laughs] of that 
woman’s body that moved—her eyes. She had the most wonderful family—brothers and sisters, and they 
would come to visit her. They would bring newspaper articles, and her half of the room was filled with so many 
beautiful things. Other people would just go in, you know, wash ‘er up, put something on ‘er, get her in the 
Hoyer lift, get ‘er out. And I couldn’t do that because if you stand right there and look into her eyes and speak 
to her, her eyes will tell you what she’s feeling, and what she’s thinking. So, have a conversation with the 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18

woman, you know, and look around at the [2.56] new articles that the family brought in, look at the new little, 
you know, card sitting over there, whatever, and talk to her about them. 
I: 
So, it’s not just family members that sometimes keep a distance, but it’s also care workers? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Sure. Sure. 
I: 
Who don’t necessarily provide that personal interaction? 
P: 
Right. And I mean there are plumbers who really should not be [laughing] plumbers, you know. Car 
salesmen that should not, so there are PCAs that should not. It just isn’t what they do best, and this is a 
business. Absolutely, but it is a business of people, so you need to have the compassion for them or you need 
to find another job. 
I: 
You did mention the challenge of being tired. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Especially with the night shifts and with the lifting. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Do you worry about that as you get older, you know, the physical—the whole physical side of it? 
P: 
Mmm. It’s the um, mmm hmm. So, I don’t know if it’s actual worry, but it is absolutely, you know, in your 
face every day. It’s like, oh, okay, but you do it just one more transfer at a time. You know, one more, hey, 
we’re gonna roll this way. You tend to where long sleeves [laughing], you know, because people tend to kind of 
grab sometimes because they’re frightened, but it’s just, I don’t know, it’s just part of what we do. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
And there will come a time when I am no longer able to do the lifting, and I definitely cannot do the 
overnights [laughing] any longer, but I’m thinking that there is still a way that I can be very useful to the older 
people. 
I: 
So, you wouldn’t necessarily leave the field, you might just take on a different role? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It sounds like you’re thinking about what you might do next. 
P: 
Well, it’s definitely time to be thinking, yeah, yeah. It is. 
I: 
C, do you have any questions right now? 
I2: 
No. 
I: 
No. Okay. Is this a good time to stop? 
I2: 
This is a great time. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. ‘Because I’m looking—I’m trying to look at this watch. M said we should have about 20 minutes, 
and then it’s maybe awkward just to stop here, but. 
P: 
It’s fine.

I: 
We’ll start up again after lunch? 
P: 
That is fine. 
I: 
Okay. All right. Thanks. 
I: 
[44.27 – part 2] Okay. A, this is the second part of our interview, and we stopped. We were in the 
middle of a discussion about the challenges of the work that you do, about being a personal care worker, and 
how it’s physically taxing, and you were saying you were sort of thinking about what you might do when you’re 
no longer able to do it, but you know, some of the other challenges that were mentioned were the wages. Can 
you just talk a little bit about what it’s like to make a living being a PCA? 
P: 
You do not make a living. You make an existence. In order to make a living you do hours and hours of 
overtime or you may work in a facility or an assisted living home. You will, in most cases, have to do private 
care work in addition to that, and for those people who have small children, who are trying to go to school who 
have families, it just does not work. We are so under appreciated as a group, you know, the elders themselves 
are not appreciated for who they are, and what they have brought, and what they can bring to our lives. And 
the caregivers are absolutely not appreciated for what we do. 
I: 
Can you talk a little bit more about that, about the feeling that this work is undervalued by society? 
P: 
Extremely frustrating [sigh]. 
I: 
How so? 
P: 
You know inside of yourself, you know in your heart, in your mind, in your soul, that you are doing 
something that is crucial for the—not only for the survival, but for the life of these beautiful elders, and you 
must remind yourself of that frequently. Sometimes 12 times [laughing] while you are caring for this person 
attempting to get to the next person and the next one and the one beyond that because there are so—the 
wages are so non-existent that people move on to do other work that they do not necessarily enjoy, but they 
are paid better. So, you’re always understaffed. You’re always on the run. You do not get to eat on time. 
Sometimes you don’t get anything to eat all day. You don’t necessarily get, you know, you can’t hydrate 
[laughing]. You know, it is not easy, and without constantly reminding yourself and getting support from the 
other people you’re working with that what you’re doing matters, or you get that smile. You get that smile from 
an elder that doesn’t, you know, or you get [41.0] a family member on occasion who will say, “Thank you.” You 
know, that is what keeps you going, and then you go home, and you go to your second job or sometimes your 
third job, and life goes on. 
I: 
So, it’s that occasional thank you or smile that keeps you going? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
How do you describe your work? When somebody says, “Well, what do you do for a living?” How do 
you describe it? Do you say I’m a personal care worker, and I’m proud of it? 
P: 
I don’t think I ever have [laughing] said it quite that way. No. It depends on the person. I mean, you 
know, if—we need our RNs; we need doctors. Not taking anything away from them, and all they’ve gone 
through to achieve their success; however, when you are in a large facility, everyone is important, and it does 
not matter whether it’s maintenance or housekeeping or the cook or, you know, the 17-year-old kid in the back 
who’s pouring the juice in the glasses, we are all important. So, if someone asks me what I do, and I begin to 
tell them and they just kind of drift off because, “Oh, I thought you were a nurse.” Okay, fine. Don’t need to 
finish this conversation with you because you are not going to listen [39.24]. 
I: 
Have you had people say that to you? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18

P: 
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. 
I: 
Hmm. 
P: 
You are, you know, you just do not have the correct letters after your name. Okay. I’m going to 
remember that that’s your problem and not mine, and I’m going to sincerely hope that when you are in need of 
care, someone is there for you. I guess it’s a lousy attitude, you know. 
I: 
But it sounds like it’s one you face—it’s not uncommon? 
P: 
Ump mmm, not at all. Ump mmm. 
I: 
Hmm. Any ideas on how we could change that? 
P: 
[Sighing] mmm. 
I: 
What would you say to people who could change that? 
P: 
We have been—I’ve been doing—I say that I’ve been doing this the last 900 years, you know, it has 
been a very long time, and I think from the beginning we have been wanting to change it. There was an 
organization years ago, [inaudible] that tried to change, and they would speak to congress, and they would—
and here we are. Here we are, you know. I think something like these interviews, if we just keep pecking away. 
It’s like the water on the rock, you know, eventually we will. I’m thinking the lawmakers and policymakers [big 
sigh], they are getting older also. So, I don’t know if that will make a difference. I would hope so. 
I: 
So, I’ll ask the same question, if this was Governor Snyder sitting there [group laughter], what would 
you say to him about this work and the value of it and why people should pay attention? 
I2: 
Sorry. Can we pause right here? Think about that answer, and I’ll change batteries here. 
I: 
It gives you an opportunity to think about your answer, yeah. 
P: 
Hmm. 
I2: 
Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
P: 
Oh, don’t be sorry. I’m just in the midst of a great hmm ‘cause I’m thinking families do not understand. 
How do you help someone to understand this? 
I: 
Yeah. How do you get to the policymakers? 
P: 
Hmm. 
I: 
What can you say, if you looked me straight in the face, right in the eye, screwed up all your courage 
and say, Governor Snyder, this is what I want to say to you— 
P: 
Hmm. 
I: 
--about personal care work. And how to fix, you know, what changes could be done in your view to 
make it more valued, more of a career choice? 
P: 
Hmm. Hmm. 
I: 
Yeah. Just think on that. 
I2: 
This is all right.  
P: 
Stop [laughing]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18

I2: 
Okay. 
I: 
Okay. Let me pose the question again. If you had the opportunity, if K, here was Governor Snyder, and 
he was asking you, “You know, I understand that we’re gonna need about 32,000 more personal care workers 
in Michigan by 2020, 2 years away. Why is this important, and how are we gonna do this? How can we 
possibly do this?” 
P: 
[Big sigh] it is important because our future, our elder’s future depends on it, but it can only change if 
the way American’s think [laughs] changes. It can only change if someone of importance says we need to 
change. We need to get behind this and make a difference, so Governor, President, whomever, stop being a 
jerk. Open your eyes, open your ears, open your heart, listen to us. Know that we are doing an extremely 
important job, at least, at the very least as important as yours, and help us. Open your mouth and say these 
are wonderful men and women who are caring for our history and our future. They deserve our support. They 
deserve our gratitude, and they deserve a life, a financial way of life. 
I2: 
Let me ask this, and you’ve been doing this for such a long time, and I’m sure so many times you’ve 
had to explain what you do, or just casually at a dinner party either talk to our family member or friend about 
what you do, can you think of a time where you saw the light bulb go off in a person, and what you were telling 
them and what the tipping point was when you told them that? 
I: 
You mean made the light bulb go on? 
I2: 
I’m sorry. Thank you, on. Light bulb going on, but in other words my point is that like what has been an 
effective method in your experience in talking about your job to all these people, and making them really 
understand what you’re doing? 
P: 
[Sigh] I think because I listen well, I need to listen to my little old people, so I listen to the family 
member. They usually leave little clues, so that is where I, you know, that is the path I take. Really, I don’t 
know how you can do this all the time, you know, because my mother never listens to me at all. I just don’t 
understand it, and I mean she was just terrible, and you know, I could never, ever, ever take care of her. 
I2: 
Sure. 
P: 
Okay. Well, that person is the same person. You know, let’s talk about why she was impatient or 
whatever, or perhaps why are you sober (?), and you just kind of keep working it around and you say, okay, so 
this is what I do. I love them for you. 
I2: 
Okay. 
P: 
I love them for you, and I care for them. I make sure that they don’t have skin breakdown. I make sure 
that while their arms are flailing and they’re kicking, I wash them and dry them, and… 
I2: 
Yeah. Let me ask a follow-up question. Now, can you think of a time when you talked about what you 
do and the kind of care you provide to a person who wasn’t a relative of someone you were caring for? 
P: 
Um hmm. 
I2: 
That guy at Panera, you know. 
P: 
[Laughing] he’s a funny guy, isn’t he [group laugher]. I think a lot of the time they do not quite get it 
unless there’s some personal connection most people don’t get it. They come close. “Oh, okay. Well, that’s 
nice.” And that’s an expression I hear all the time. “That’s nice.” 
I: 
So, playing off of that for a minute, I think—I’ve got to remember. I have a couple of questions I want to 
remember, but one—perhaps one reason why people’s eyes start to glaze over, is they don’t really know what 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18 
6
you do. Like in concrete terms, can you describe—let’s say I don’t know what a homecare worker is—a 
personal care worker. What do they even do for a person? You know, I have heard people say, it’s low-skilled 
work. I mean after all, how hard is it to prepare a meal for somebody? Okay. So how do you respond to that? 
First of all, how do you respond to that about this is low-skilled work, and that’s all you do is sit there and you’re 
like a glorified babysitter? How do you respond to that? 
P: 
Deep breath [laughs]. Deep breath and no. It is not only, you know, I walk in the morning. You know, 
think about what you need done in the morning, you know, have to wash their face, and brush their teeth, and 
if they are unable to do it, you know, they need to have their entire body cleaned. We have to brush their teeth 
and floss them. Did you ever try to floss anyone else’s teeth? Your fingers don’t fit in their [laughing] mouth, 
you know. You know, yeah, sure, anybody could fix a meal, right. Can you go in and fix their meal while you 
are making certain that this particular person who perhaps does have dementia is trying to get out the front 
door? You know, they want to help you, and you know, you cannot allow them to burn themselves at the stove. 
You need to allow them to do as much as they can, but you know, you don’t want them to slip in the water that 
they just spilled. There’s, you know, it’s like - they are not childish…I do not—there’s not a comparison. They 
are not childish, but I’m saying you need to watch them as closely as you would a house full of children, you 
know [27.22]. And you want to keep their minds active. You can go for a walk, but it’s not as easy for them to 
walk as it is for you, so it’s getting their shoes on, it’s helping the poor old bones stand up straight. Their depth 
perception is off, so you don’t want to, again, treat them in a childish manner, but you must help them get down 
the stairs with their depth perception being off, and they don’t hear quite as well. So, you have—there’s a lot of 
little details to maneuver throughout the entire day. Every move that she makes. Getting them to drink. Elders 
do not wish to drink for a number of reasons. You have to find ways to get them to drink. You know, all of those 
little things and that does take some skill [laughs]. It takes some talent. 
I: 
Tell me about the skill it takes. What kind of skills? 
P: 
You need to—you need, first of all, to know the importance of the hydration. You need to know what 
they will and will not drink. What they like. What they like, but what they’re allergic to, or [laughing] you know, 
you need to keep all of these things in mind, and you have to play whatever game it takes, play whatever card 
it takes, you know. Even if it’s one sip at a time. Okay. All right, and then we’ll read another page, we will play 
three more cards, let’s take another drink, and it may take you an hour to get four ounces of juice down, but 
you do that because they need it. 
I: 
So, some creativity and patience— 
P: 
Patience. Patience. 
I: 
Lots of patience. 
P: 
Patience [laughing]. 
I: 
You know, you’re talking about there are different levels of care, right? Some people— 
P: 
Sure. 
I: 
--just need maybe you to keep an eye on them, make sure they’re safe. Whereas others need really 
high levels of care. Can I just throw out a few words to you in terms of actually care that you provide, and 
see—and you respond? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, for example you were talking about somebody flailing their arms and legs? How do you handle 
somebody who’s combative?

Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18

P: 
[Deep breath] again, we go with the patience, and we go with humor a lot of times, and keeping lights 
on, you know, so they are bright enough, so they can see but so that they’re not shining in their face. You want 
soft music, you want to keep things as calm [aspossible]. The environment as calm as possible, and [laughing] 
you learn how to move your hands and just keep those going out that way, and you back off when you need to 
unless it is a life and death moment, it can wait. Back off. 
I: 
I keep thinking of you know people who say there’s no skills. It’s low-skill work. Talk to me for a minute 
about continence or incontinence. 
P: 
Mmm. 
I: 
You have to—a lot of older people will have a problem with continence I mean in care. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
In care facilities or in care situations. 
P: 
I think that is probably, you know, one of the most difficult if someone is going to be combative that’s 
probably, you know, the time they’re going to be because—so it’s a very private matter, and especially people 
from the generation that we’re taking care of, things were not shared [laughing] [22.59]. Long clothes, and so 
here you are taking away every last ounce of dignity that they have, so, yeah, it’s a tough situation for them. 
So, you explain to them what you’re going to do, and you make sure that you have an extra sheet or blanket to 
keep them covered as much as possible, but consistency. When you can go in and tell them again, and again, 
I am so sorry. I do need to do this. I need to do it because I love you, because I care about you. I do not want 
you smelling. I do not want your skin to be sore, you know. And everything you do, moment by moment, I’m 
going to bring your right leg out this way so that I can clean in this crease. That is the only thing I’m going to 
touch. I am washing. All right. I’ve put that cloth down, I’ve picked up the rinse cloth. I’ve put that down, now 
I’m going to dry your crease on your right side. That’s it. I’m putting your leg down now, and you lift your hands 
up, so they can see. All right. I’m going to lean over or I’m going to go around the bed. I’m going to do, you 
know, every—every, little step you tell them, you honor them all that you can [21.23], you know. 
I: 
You know, we’re right in the middle of this MeToo Movement, and I know a number of personal care 
workers have had to deal with unwanted or inappropriate sexual comments, advances, you know during care. 
Have you ever dealt with that or what are your thoughts on that? 
P: 
It’s there. It is there. I think for one thing, people need to remember just because someone is older does 
not mean that they lose the need for human contact. It is ever so important. Human contact is more important 
than the sexual content, but they don’t know how. You know, and people say, “Men are terrible. That’s all men 
ever think about.” Well, when you work [laughing] in a large facility and having done restorative work I am 
throughout the building, throughout the day, women are just as needy as men are [laughing], and they take 
care of the situation themselves frequently. Humor comes in again, and I think being older now especially it 
helps a lot too. If someone grabs toward me, I will say, op, sorry. They’re mine. You can’t have them. I grew 
them myself, and we go on. You know, we just kind of move their hands back, and just keep going, you know. 
So, I haven’t had—it’s there, but it’s not become a problem for me because I haven’t let it. We put an end to it, 
you know, but— 
I: 
Have you ever felt unsafe? 
P: 
Um there have been a couple of situations. Medications can, certain drugs can help increase 
someone’s strength. I mean it’s just the nature of the game, so I have to just remember that I must remain 
safe, so I will go in—I have to go in with authority. They have to know that they need to respect me. I am there 
to service, to help, but that’s as far as it [laughing] goes. And if someone is obviously going to take a swing at

me, I mean to hurt me, then I back off because you cannot—you cannot put yourself in that situation [18.20], 
but, yeah, I mean it’s— 
I: 
It sounds like you’ve had so much experience over the years that you’ve learned ways in which to 
handle and deflect and minimize some of these situations. Have you ever been—maybe years ago, put in a 
situation that—you were put into a situation that you didn’t know how to handle? You weren’t trained for it. You 
weren’t prepared for it either physically or mentally? Do you remember any times like that at all? 
P: 
Mmm. I remember working in the hospital. There was a gentleman who just—he just—he was 
frightened, and I was 20, and I did not understand, you know, how deep his insecurity and his fears were, and 
he just was pestering everyone else in the room, and stressed, and didn’t know what to do, and so at one point 
he reached up and grabbed my arm and pulled me not—it wasn’t a sexual thing, but it was, “Hey,” you know, 
and yeah. That particular incident was scary, but I put my arms out, and you know, on the siderail, and stopped 
from going forward, and I am fairly sturdy [laughing]; I can do that. And I don’t know, we just—he started 
yelling, and I was just like, just stop it again. Remember, I said I had a challenging childhood, so I learned—I 
was put in situations as a very young child that—that I learned very young how to deal with situations [16.12], 
so in that sense—in that sense it was a good thing because I could go into this type of work and be more 
confident than many people just as the situation in my childhood was not good, it wasn’t anything I would wish 
on anyone else; however, it was the greatest gift I could have because now I can understand my little old 
people, and I can serve them better. 
I: 
It sounds like you have mastered the ability to establish some boundaries, and say, eh, not going there, 
you know. 
P: 
[Laughs] mmm. 
I: 
And to protect yourself, and I imagine younger people who don’t have that experience or haven’t had a 
bad childhood, might not have those same skills. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Right? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And especially in a home situation where maybe those boundaries get a little blurred. Can you talk 
about that a little bit? 
P: 
Mmm. Um [pause] hmm. 
I: 
Well, think on that one. 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
And here’s another way of coming at it. If you were talking to a group of young people, younger people 
who were considering going into this kind of work, what advice would you have for them? 
P: 
I think that they need to consider it. Again, I firmly believe that when we look at situation and we are 
satisfied with the answer, we need to back up and look at it from another angle because it just never turns out 
right when you [laughing] only, you know, you see this, you’re happy, you go forward, and then all of these 
other questions come in. So, look at it now. Think about what you are willing to do. What are your strengths? 
Do you have patience? Do you not take things personally? I was working with someone. I was doing 12 hours 
and she would do the other 12, and you know, this dear, sweet lady did not like the other person. Okay. But 
she would tell her, and this young woman would just cry [13.34] and cry and cry and cry. Okay. How long have 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18

you been doing this? “[In a sobbing voice] 12 years.” And when did you learn that you do not take these things 
personally? “[sobbing] I didn’t. I take everything personally.” Okay. You need to find a new job [laughing] 
‘cause you just can’t, so yeah, we would talk about not taking things personally, and about perhaps taking a 
self-defense course if you need it [laughing] first, you know. And keeping fingernails short, and wearing long 
sleeves, and [laughing] you know, all those little tricks, and you know, is this really something you want to do? 
It’s not—it’s wonderful. It’s not easy. It’s not easy, but there’s nothing better. 
I: 
Yeah. You know, we’re—this figure keeps getting thrown out there that we’re going to need 32,000 
more workers, and how are we ever going to get these workers, and of course we don’t want just warm bodies, 
we want people who actual want to do the work and are good. You know, know how to do it. So, how do you 
go out and recruit people and convince them that this is a good job? How do you do that? Is that even 
possible? 
P: 
It has to be possible. 
I: 
It has to be. We have to make it so. 
P: 
Um— 
I: 
Like how would you convince somebody that this is work they might want to try? 
P: 
I’m trying to think whether, you know, is there—are there groups we could talk to even? I know one 
home I worked in, they were always going to the high school and getting young girls, and they were gonna be 
great ‘cause, you know, they loved people. Well, no, these kids would come in, and it was just shocking to 
them. You know, and I think I like my job, but, oh, no [laughing]. You know, so I don’t think that’s the way to go. 
I don’t know which groups of people, but you just have to—I have no idea at this moment [laughing]. 
I: 
That’s okay. Neither do I [group laughter]. You look like you want to say something? 
I2: 
I’m just gonna say another way of asking that question, sorry, this is a tough question. But as we are 
listening to these conversations we hear about how there isn’t very good pay, and it’s very difficult, and it’s 24-
7. You have to have a very specific kind of personality to do this kind of work, and the only reward has been 
the thank you, and appreciation, but then if you further drill down into that—the industry isn’t even really 
appreciated outside of the community, so what you are promoting is a job or a career path for getting a bunch 
of new people to go in - what is one thing that keeps you addicted that you would share with a young person 
who is like, “Hey, I want to do what you’re doing.”  
P: 
Hmm. 
I2: 
Sorry for asking that question again. 
P: 
I know. It’s just—I know that I gained something because my purpose on this earth is to serve, and to 
comfort, and to ease other people’s—you know, ease their pain, and their sadness, but I don’t know that that’s 
enough for anyone else, so I don’t know that that’s the answer. But I don’t know of any other reason to do it. 
There is no other reason to do it because you’re not respected, and you don’t make a living, and so I don’t 
know how to answer that question [laughing]. 
I2: 
But if someone is looking for that fulfillment, this is where they should come. If they’re looking [group 
laughter]— 
P: 
Absolutely [laughing]. 
I: 
And you know, saying you don’t know, why because it’s—you can’t make a living at it, and you get no 
respect, so you really don’t know. I think that in itself is a powerful answer. Right there. I mean [laughs].

P: 
Well, it’s the only answer I have [laughing]. 
I2: 
Let’s pause here. 
I: 
Okay. And we should probably wrap up pretty soon ‘cause I know K wants to do photo shoots. 
I2: 
Yes. I was just pausing because we were on 30-minute mark, so now I’m ready to restart. Okay. 
I: 
I guess just a couple more questions. Let’s say you are sitting with some younger people, and you 
know this is a job fair, and you’re trying to describe the job to them. What would a typical day look like? I’m one 
of the potential recruits, and I’m sitting here going, well, what do you do every day, you know?  What would I 
have to do? If I got hired to do this job, what would I have to do? 
P: 
Well, I think I would ask you first of all do you think that what you would want to do would be private 
care or, you know, a small home with just a few people, or are you thinking about a large facility? It’s basically 
the same thing, but not at all [laughing]. You know, if you are caring for one person, and you go in and help 
them get ready for the day, and you fix them breakfast, and you try to get a little range of motion in, and you do 
some reading, and you know, lunch time, and whatever. Okay, but— 
I: 
Am I going to have to give somebody a bath? Am I going to have to lift people? What if he’s too heavy? 
What if there’s like 200, 6’5” guy in the bed? How am I going to do that? 
P: 
You are going to have to depend on your coworkers and hope that they are all in a good mood that day 
[laughing] and willing to help, you know. And you never know. I worked one place, we had a woman who was 
5’10, and she weighed well over 300 pounds, and when she would become angry because she didn’t get her 
extra plate of spaghetti or whatever, she would throw herself on the floor. It took every available CNA to get her 
up [laughing], you know. So, yeah, there are some crazy situations, so I think that they would need to hear 
about a few of those things. But again, if you don’t keep that sense of humor you’re not gonna make it through 
the morning let alone a whole day. 
I: 
And what kind of training would you recommend? 
P: 
More than 2 weeks, please [laughing]. There are a lot of people who go through a class. They come out 
at the end of it and still do not have a clue. They think it’s kind of like, you know, Barbie and Ken, like we’re just 
going to go in and, you know, give you a bath. Okay. Bath is not nice, smooth skin, it’s wrinkled and hanging, 
and you have to pick it up and scrub all those parts, you know, and dry them, and you know, when it’s time to 
eat, if they need assistance, you are going to have to make sure that the bites are the correct size so that they 
don’t begin choking. You don’t want them to aspirate. Yeah, there’s a lot, but I think the idea of just finding 
whether they have compassion first and then we can start going into the details and maybe they’ll stay 
[laughing] for more than 6 months [4.35]. 
I: 
Before we wrap up, I know you’ve made a few suggestions about how we can handle this. As a nation 
we need to change the value we place on older people and on this kind of work. Are there any last thoughts, 
anything that you really, you know, have inside that you want to say about this kind of work, and the people 
you care for, and the people who take care of them? 
P: 
I can say without any reservation I am so proud to be someone who cares for our elders, and I don’t 
know. I need to go and think more of how I can be of help to make sure that those of us who care for them are 
honored. 
I: 
I guess one final thought approaching the state government, you know, they have a lot of technical 
training programs, but they’re reserved for people who will go through those and come out and get a mid-wage 
job. So, we’ve been told that we can’t have a comparable program for PCAs because they’ll come out and get 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ardith G. Lee.  Haslett.  2.14.18 
11
a low-pay job. Without a clear career path, and so over and over we hear this that we need to demonstrate that 
some advancement, you know, that the PCAs who come through a program like this will then go on to become 
a CNA, and then a nurse, and then a this or that, and you know. It’s this idea that you have to keep 
progressing up. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And you know, even that language devalues the work. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
That you do, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, if everybody goes on this career path, you know, moves away from being a PCA to becoming a 
nurse or whatever, what do we—we need PCAs to stay and be PCAs [laughing], right, and value that. And I’ve 
heard some PCAs say, “I wouldn’t want to be a nurse. I don’t want to be a nurse. I want to be a PCA.” 
[laughing] 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You know, can you just talk about that whole idea of a career ladder for a minute? 
P: 
Life is not a ladder [laughing], you know. We are—there is nothing wrong with stepping sideways, and 
you know, you can go here, you can go there, but we are the ones holding everyone up, you know. We don’t 
need to progress because what we are doing right now is exactly what the people need. We don’t need to pass 
out pills, and fill out papers, and sit at the computer for 8 or 10 or 12 hours. We need to be there with the 
people, and we need to love them and care for them, and we’re wonderful. So, knock it off [laughing]. Pay 
attention to us and appreciate who we are. 
I: 
I think that’s a great way to end [laughs]. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
That was nice. 
I: 
That was great. You did great, A. Thank you so much. 
I2: 
Please, everyone stay there. Let me just shoot some [inaudible], which means just pretend that you’re 
still talking [group laughter. 
I: 
He want’s pictures of our hands. Just do what he says and pretend like we’re doing an interview. 
Actually, I still have this one, so we are actually doing an interview. Anything else you have to say? 
P: 
I think you were sort of doing a monologue there [group laughter].
