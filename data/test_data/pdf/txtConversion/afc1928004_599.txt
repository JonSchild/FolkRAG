JOHN ALLEN, this popular comedian, was born In 
Newark, N. j., April 20th, 1844. _His first appear-
ance on any stage was in Newark, N. J., in 1859, 
with schoolmates in an amateur minstrel troup. He 
-made quite a 
success as a 
dancer and comedian. 
He 
then enlisted in the 1st New Jersey Regiment, under 
Col. Johnson, Runyan's Brigade. 
After serving one 
year in the army he engaged with the Pry Brothers, 
in Washington on Pennsylvania Avenue, to play on 
the end and do songs and dances, for which he re-
ceived ten dollars per week. 
Ile created a 
sensation 
with his high-kicking in his song- and-dance, and had 
an offer from Hitchcock in New York City, who kept 
a 
concert hall in Canal Street near the Bowery, re-
ceiving fifteen dollars per week. 
After playing there 
two weeks Robert Butler engaged him for his famous 
music hall, known as 444 Broadway. 
Ile then did 
the song " Rip, . Tear, and Johnny's gone away," 
which was the trademark for his success. 
While 
playing under Butler's management he saw Charles 
E. Collins jump the ' r47;re, - and Allen was advised 
to imitate him. 
He did so, doing Collins' " Cure," 
and " Active Boy," in black face. 
He then was en-
gaged by Robert Fox of the Ca ,ino of Philadelphia. 
After playing therc he was engaged to play in St, 
Louis, after \I:hid' he played in Ch!eigo. 
Then he 
was engaged by Kelly and Leon to take Billy Ailing-, 
4 
toes place on the end. 
Arlington was the greatest 
minstrel favorite ever in Chicago at that time. 
He 
Vayed one season with those gtn lenien, when he 
was engaged by K M. Honley cf BrJoklyn to take 
the end, playing one season. 
He %% as engaged by 
Seaver of Williamsburgh. 
The minstrel band was a 
great success. 
Be then was engaged to play a 
four 
weeks' engagement in Cincinnati. 
After playing 
there he returned to Williamsburgh again, opening 
with Seaver, then with Kelly and Leon at 720 Broad-
way, New York City. 
Ile then was engaged by Tully. 
Pastor to dance his famous dance, " Nicodenius 
Johnson," after which Allen was engaged with Mor-
ris and Wilson's minstrels of St. Louis. 
He then 
came back to New York, and was engaged by the 
late W. W. Newcomb to take the place of Billy Em-
erson on the end. 
Emerson was to play in St. Louis 
at the Olympic Theater, in the play of the " Seven 
Sisters." 
Emerson, before leaving Cincinnati, made 
a 
proposition to start the minstrel band called Em-
erson and Allen's 
Minstrels. 
The late Manning 
thought he would like some of that stock, said he 
would put up money if they would let him join that 
money market. 
He was accepted. 
The band was 
known as Emerson, Allen and Manning's Minstrels, 
the trademark an I 
talk of the Western ebuntry to-
day. 
Allen sold out; came East and was engaged 
by John Stetson of Boston, and taken in as a 
partner 
of the Horn and Blood good troupe. 
He then sold 
out his interest to Stetson and started the Allen, 
Pettengill, lle!ehanty and Hengler troupe. 
This 
troupe met with immense success. 
The following 
season it was entitled Allen and Pettengill troupe.. 
when poor Charley Pettengill died. 
Allen playeil 
the troupe throughout the country to immense suc-
cess, taking in as partners Louis A. Zwisler. 
Shortly 
after he had his famous play " Schneider, dot House 
on de Rhine." which met with tremendous applause 
all over the country. 
He has met with many ups 
and downs in life, but has always strived to hold his 
own. 
He starts this season with a 
tine troupe, intro-
ducing the Public's motto, " Schneider, 
mit his 
}louse on de Rhine."

Jonah he was swallowed by de whale,

Da lost him in de Itriney deep,

When Jonah he woke he took his hand, 
And he led him in de promised land. 
CHORUS.

Humble yourself, de bells da done ring. 
Cain he was in the land of Nod;

And he liv'd NOM her the rest of his life; 
Now Abel was a 
different man, 
lie always lived in de promise land, 
And when he saw what Jonah done, 
lie cut his sticks and away he run. 
Live Humble, et 
Now may friends, there was a

Where Adam lived with Eve, 
Everything was lovely. 
No neighbors for to thieve, 
-Every day was Christmas, 
And they got their rations free, 
And eberything belong to them 
Except one apple tree.

Hey, Rickety Barlow, cock-a-doodle-doo;

Hey, Rickety Barlow, cock-a-doodle-doo; 
Every day I

M ii tele was the very man that tossed the penny

Hey, Rickety Barlow, cock-a-thH,ile-doo. 
SPOKEN.—They say I'm foolish; I 
ain't such a 
fool as I 
look, though I 
wouldn't cut my teeth till I 
was six years (. 1d, 'cause I 
liked to be fed on arrow-
root and jam pudding; I 
wouldn't walk till I was 
nine and a 
half, 'cause I 
like to be carried. 
Ain't I 
foolish! 
When I 
was too big to be carried they 
bought me a 
carriage. 
The nurse used to take me 
rating in the park; when she thought I 
was asleep 
she used to talk to a 
tail policeman, and I 
used to 
stick pins in his legs. 
When I 
was eleven I 
knew 
nothing, and scarcely that. 
They sent time to school 
to learn some more; they said when I 
could read 
and write that I should go to work. 
I 
got more 
foolish than ever then. 
I 
met a 
man the other day, 
and says he to me: " What's the matter with you, 
my good boy?" 
Says I, " I'm foolish." 
Says he, 
"I'm very sorry; here's a 
dollar for you." 
Says I, 
" 
Thank you, sir; I 
got a 
brother, and he's foolish, 
give us one for him." 
Oh! oh! oh! oh! They call me, etc. 
BROKEN-HEARTED LOV ER. 
FRANK KERNS TO ;JOHNNY ALLEN. 
The object tita- you now behold, 
In grief, once loved a 
fairy, 
In the shape of a 
blue-eyed, fair-haired girl, 
Whose father kept a 
dairy, 
Not far from the middle of the old Kent road, 
The well 1 
know it rather; 
She lived with her father across the path, 
And her darling name was Martha. 
Cr' out; s. 
Oh! I 
once was as happy as a 
young cock robin, 
Or the pretty little fishes in the water; 
Those days are gone, for now I 
mourn 
For Martha. the milkman's daughter. 
I 
used to wander by the house, 
In hopes my love to see, 
She'd take a 
survey front the second floor front, 
In hopes that she'd see me. 
One day she threw a 
billet-deaux, 
It made my blood run cold, 
'Twas to say that her pa demanded that she 
Should wed an old codger with lots of gold. 
Oh! I 
once was as happy, etc. 
At length the wedding day arrived, 
When she was to be bound 
To sonic old fool she couldn't love; 
But the bride could not be found. 
They searched the house both here and there, 
At length they did discover 
A note to say she'd gone “ way. 
To die for her true lover. 
Ohl I 
once was as happy, etc.,

,THE WICKEDEST GIRL THAT'S OCT. 
Song and dance by NED STRAIGHT. 
Sung by JOHNNY ALLEN. 
The most delicious moments 
I 
ever yet have seen, 
Was while I 
sat a-chatting 
With my Clementina Dean. 
She had st,c'.i pretty- coal-black eyes, 
And teeth a:-3 white as snow. 
And drove a 
pair of milk- white steeds 
When to a 
ball she'd go. 
CHORUS. 
Here lips of rose none could opposar 
So saucily they'd pout. 
Her flashing eye would make you siert 
She's the wickedest girl's that's out, 
I 
took her out a- riding, 
'Twas one Sunday afternoon, 
We rode and talked and chatted, 
Till we saw the silvery moon. 
I 
whispered to her gently 
You're the girl that I 
adore, 
But found her soundly sleeping, 
For she gave an awful snore. 
Her lips of macs ete. 
While sweetly she Il'a5 
:Nestled closely by my side, 
I 
kissed her twenty times or more, 
It cannot be denied. 
She sprang up v0ry suddenly,. 
And burst out in a 
laugh.

do declare, 
You're acting like a

THAT PRETTY LAUGHING EYE. 
Written by JOHNNY SHERIDAN for his particular friend, 
JOHNNY ALLEN. 
The prettiest girl T 
ever saw 
I 
met the other day, 
So gracefully she walked along 
The festive gay Broadway. 
A 
pretty little glove she dropped 
As she was passing by, 
picked it up, 'twas then I 
saw 
That Pretty Laughing Eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, she looked so sweet, 
Dressed in the fashion, oh! so neat. 
I 
couldn't help but love her, 
She looked so very shy, 
But the only thing that stole my heart 
I'Vrvi that -Pretty Laughing Eye. 
She smiled and bov.ed, we walked gilow 
Together down the street. 
Unluckily for me just then 
Her lover we did meet. 
He boldly walked straight up to me, 
And in his rage did cry, 
Walk off, young man!" " He won't!" said 511*. 
Olt! that Pretty Laughing Eye.

(Sin.) 
left him standing in the street, 
Home with her I 
did go, 
1 
asked her if she'd be my wife, 
You bet she didn't say no. 
Next week we're going to married be, 
If our home you pass by, 
Drop in and see my little wile. 
.And that Ptwtty Lauphing Eye. 
Oh, my, sh4/ looked go sweet, etm. 
As sung by JOHNNY ALLEN. 
Riding in the cars, vet and rainy day, 
Along with pa and ma, with fifteen cents to pay; 
You sit down, side by side, with a seat so well ar-
ranged, 
And fumble through pockets for the necessary change. 
CHORUS. 
Pull the bell, let her went, and now we go. 
Hurrah! 
Don't we have a 
jolly time, riding in the car? 
Pull the bell, let her went, now we go. 
Hurrah! 
Don't we have a 
jolly tune, riding in the car? 
On a 
blatform stands a 
man; he's not at all polite; 
Been drinking visky skin, und smokes a 
dirty pipe; 
You ask hint for to move, and give you fiddle space, 
Instead of moving he will puff tobacco in your face. 
Pull the boll, etc. 
Lady mit a

Baby keeps a-crying; mudder looks at me, 
Says its tiresome talking, she'd rather be at valking, 
Car keep a-jouncing, it was awful shocking.

Forty years ago.

In the sunshine making hay, 
When we used to get our home- brewed ale 
In the bottle every day.

There was riot so much grinding after pelf; 
But things are not as they used to be 
Forty years ago.

TWO-FORTY BY THE WATCH. 
Az; sung by JOHNNY A LLEN. 
One sunny afternoon last week 
I 
thought I'd take a 
ride, 
So hired a 
nag Nrhich they call fast., 
And so she was, when tied; 
But. Yankee Sinn drove the mare 
\Mile 1 
lay'd on the whip 
And shouted till I 
was quite hoarse. 
SPOKEN.—Look'e here, Sam, here conie 
Billings 
with his new horse, so you'd better put that ani-
mated female projecting power tnr.ougli— 
And wake up and let her rip. 
CHORUS. 
Wake up, etc. 
Wake up, wake up, 
Whi:e crack. crack went the whip, 
Wake up, William Henry, 
" 
Why " don't you let her rip. 
We stop't at Stalin Brewery, 
Of course to take a 
smile 
And give the expeditions nag 
A 
drink and rest awhile; 
So when the nig brought up the steed 
To him a 
stamp I 
slip't 
And Sam sang out. 
SPOKEN.—AS I 
jumped into the wagon. and seiz-
ing the reins, 
I told the member from 
Mass. 
ho held the double distilled essence of lightnimz 
114--
Wake up, and let her rip. 
Wake up, etc.

TWO-FORTY BY THE WATCH. 
(Concluded). 
A 
chap who drove a 
sorrel nag 
Seemed anxious for a 
brush, 
So when we reached Grand avenue 
We went it with a 
rush. 
"fwas neck and neck, -we pass the track 
When the t-orrel made a 
trip. 
We glided by, like lightning greased, 
SPOKEN.— I
for having hired the horse from Sam 
Raymond, at the rate of two dollars per day, wo 
concluded we had a perfect 
right to take out 
money's worth out of the ureter, so we 
Woke up and let her rip. 
We drove along without mishap 
At. least a 
dozen miles, 
Stopping now and then, of course, 
To take several 
miles: 
At last we ran into a 
chap 
Who gave us too niuch lip; 
While turning round, for Sam, I 
found 
SPOKEN.—The 
horse 
had broke 
the IN:mess, 
timashed the wagon, pitched Sam and myself into 
the ditch. " Sam." says I, " the mare's run awa 
Sam, struggling under the combined effects of lagt-r 
and a 11101101ft-

Dutch gag Ivas applied,

In four hundred different styles, 
And was struck by Jersey lightning on the cheek. 
While walking for dat cabs. 
Mustard plasters I

And can dance a

That was found behind a

I 
receive.1 the highest prize

EMMET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above.

Cuortus. 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock. 
The shamrock immortal and green. 
By ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
,.0h say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Ellin kings can tell: 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there. 
And liked the soil so well. 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
Oh the shanixock, etc. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A dower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
halite in thee. 
Thou shamrock of the dell.
