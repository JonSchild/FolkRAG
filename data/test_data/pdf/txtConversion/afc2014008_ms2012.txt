How soes it happen, then, that in the Heritage Fellowships there has been
 
such a concentration on older artists?  To repeat, it was not planned but there does
 
seem to be an especially close relationship between the folk arts and the elderly,
 
so much so that I believe that, even if the Folk Arts panel had tried to come up
 
with a more equitable age distribution, they would have found it an awfully
 
difficult feat to bring off.  The reasons are many, having to do both with the
 
nature of folk arts and the nature of the general human life cycle.  Let us take
 
up first the nature of the folk arts.
 
As we note in the Folk Arts Program guidelines, "the folk and traditional
 
arts have grown through time within the many groups that make up any nation
 
groups that share the same ethnic heritage, language, occupation, religion, or
 
geographic area "  They are the "homegrown, traditional artistic activities of
 
such groups
 and they serve both to identify and to symbolize the group that
 
originated them "  A list of examples might include, Samoan story telling, Ozark
 
ballads, Irish step dances, Southeast Asian embroidery.  Almost always, these art
 
forms have been learned informally, by casual or not-so--casual observation, or
 
by being "shown," often a relatively brief experience.
 On the whole, one does not
 
go to Julliard to learn how to play a hammer dulcimer, nor are there many courses
 
available, even in our technical schools, in how to build an Eskimo skin boat.
 
American society does not ordinarily place much stock in informal learning.
 
We like to be professional and efficient; the notion that an artistic activity or
 
style might be absorbed simply by a process of hanging about and observing sits
 
uneasily with our feeling that the really important things ought to be conveyed in
 
a really important (and thus formalized) manner.
 
Just a bit of reflection, though, impresses upon one the universality of
 
those early childhood experiences when one drifted off to sleep to the strains of
 
grandfather's fiddle practicing waltzes, or the family's favorite gospel hour on
 
3
 
the radio, or the matachine society next door getting ready for the fiesta tomorrow.
 
In the visual dimension, as the child watches the swift fingers of a basket maker
 
selecting and rejecting grass stems, or sees the seamstress making the vital decisions
 
between contrast or complementarity in color, or absorbs, just by living  with it,
 
the spare dignity of furniture built in the Shaker style, an equal number of elegant
 
distinctions are being learned, even though not taught.  Each one of us grows up
 
within an aesthetic environment that helps us identify and express from whence we
 
come, whether or not we practice or personally participate in the local art forms.
 
Thus we come to know early on whether our folks like to worship God with big
 
massed choirs or solo voices, to dance to oompah bands or to blue grass combos,
 
to sleep under overshot coverlets or Hawaiian appliqued quilts or woven Indian
 
blankets.  And depending upon individual temperament, family attitudes, the demands
 
of the larger society, and a myriad other variables, each of us may dedicate some
 
some part of ourselves to emulating those artistic features and techniques we most
 
admire during our growing up days.  We may begin to try playing the fiddle, clogging,
 
whittling, singing harmony.
 
A lot can be learned by observation and trial-and-error, or simply being part
 
of the scene.  But there are techniques, materials, specifics that are harder to
 
come by.  Where is the young learner to turn?  Typically, to the grandparental
 
generation.  Parents are generally pretty busy people, earning the money, raising
 
the babies, putting food on the table and clothes on the backs, running the farm
 
or the household or the store or fulfilling the demands of the job.  Even thinking
 
about teaching a young child can be an added imposition, though most parents will
 
"shew" a thing or two on the fly.  But the longer term more serious learning
 
relationships generally skip a generation.
 In a recent exhibit of Older Cleveland
 
Folk Artists sponsored by the Cleveland Department of Aging several of the artists
 
tell typical stories:  Mrs. Anna Jesenko, a Slovenian bobbin lace maker recalls,
 
I learned to make the lace when I was eight years old .
... I didn't
 
go to school for bobbin lace because I learned at home,  when you
 
U
 
4
 
learn, you never forget.
 I
'm eighty-one years old now and what I
 
learned at that tim e is still in my head.  The older ladies, like
 
the ones who come from our village, they die, and the young ones
 
they don't know how to do it.  When their mothers die, they throw
 
it away.  Now they would like to learn, and they don't have no
 
pillow, no bobbins.  They don't realize.
 I don't think my daughters
 
know how to make bobbin lace, because they were small I no think
 
about it, to teach them, because that is the best time to teach
 
the kids.  And then later, now, they are too busy.  But I try to
 
teach my grandson's wife..."
 
Ralph C. Meincke, a 72 year old Cleveland carver and duck decoy maker says,
 
"I taught my grandson to carve.
 It takes a lot of time to show
 
and explain.  Many, many weeks he came here, and we both sat down
 
and I gave him a bird to carve.  While I was carving one, he did
 
the same thing to learn.  Then he taught his father to carve, but
 
it was harder for my son to learn... t'
 
Mrs. Maggie T. Williams, an Afro-American quilter gives us a final variation:
 
"Mama taught me way back in Arkansas and now I'm enjoying it.  Me
 
and my mother did it together, until she passed.  We didn't piece
 
together.
 She'd piece hers and I
'd piece mine, but we'd quilt
 
together.
 She taught me how to do -different things.  She taught
 
me how to raise children and I try to carry it on like she taught
 
me.
 I came to Cleveland in 1979.  Now I
'm sisty-three... I just
 
love to piece quilts.
 I don't know how come.  I just love to piece
 
quilts... My daughter could piece quilts, but she don't have time.
 
And so I reckon when she gets older, she may do it.  I hope so..."
 
We are changing the focus of our discussion from the learner to the teacher,
 
from  the younger to the older, and a sense of pattern is beginning to emerge
 
from all the variables.  A number of years ago I taught folklore at a state
 
5
 
university in California, an area often settled down in by retirees.  My
 
students were all expected to do some field work, and a regular semester
 
assignment was to seek out and do a structured interview with someone over
 
sisty-five.  Over and over again my horrified students protested they didn't
 
know anyone over sixty-five; over and over I brutally replied, "They're all
 
around; go make friends.  Heck, you might even try talking to your grandfather!"
 
Such human treasures they found.  A Van Nuys clock maker who also made and
 
repaired musical instruments and finally shyly admitted to being able to play the
 
five string banjo of his youth that now stood in a corner of his shop.  At first
 
too bashful to sing a note, within months he became the star turn at valley folk
 
festivals, striding up to the microphone and positively belting out his songs
 
like some seventeen year old, his small repair shop jammed with general sociability
 
and young folks learning instrument repair.  A grandmother in Anaheim who after
 
her interview went up into her attic and brought down her old guitar, an exquisite
 
turn of the century rosewood "lady's model" wrapped carefully in a long silk scarf.
 
No one of her grown children had ever known that their mother both played and
 
sang; her fascinated grandson was her first audience in over fifty years.  An
 
Irish steelworker from the midwest who brought his old Irish "elbow" pipes into
 
retirement with him and who soon developed a sort of human train of young musicians
 
who followed him like a line of ducklings all around La Jolla discussing tunes and
 
techniques, solociting his views and his criticisms, all of them piping away, -
-
 he
 
joining in when his emphysema allowed, -
-
 on the windswept beaches and in the
 
eucalyptus groves.
 
My students and I became able almost to graph the career lines of these
 
artists.  All of them had been exposed to their eventual art form in childhood,
 
normally by "picking it up," watching fine musicians or artisans, absorbint the
 
aesthetic criteria, getting the feel of what is good and what is better, becoming
 
excited, trying a skill out, making mistakes, getting corrected.
 Some were
 
6
 
universalists, trying out a bit of many crafts and styles, some fewer became
 
entrapped, one might almost say, in a single art form early and made it their
 
own speciality.
 
Childhood moved into young adulthood with increasing energies shown most
 
frequently by the musicians and dancers (
they're good for courtship, after all).
 
But with marriage and growing family responsibilities, much of the artistic activity
 
slacked off; a kind of general latency period set in and life became real and
 
earnest and the "old ways" began to seem less beautiful and interesting.  My files
 
contain perhaps a hundred interviews containing one or more of the following
 
statements here paraphrased for convenience into one.
 "I don't know, I just
 
stopped quilting (or fiddle playing or embroidery or any number of things) while
 
the children were growing up.
 I was too tired, and we wanted so many things you
 
had to buy and the old things just got to seem too old-fashioned and corny.  And
 
then there wasn't any time."
 
But with the arrival of the fifties and sixties, many resumed their old art
 
form like a second career with all the enthusiasm of teen-agers -
-
 and infinitely
 
more knowledge and subtlety.  We began almost to wonder whether the long middle
 
period of inactivity was not so much a time of abandonment of the art as a time
 
for lying fallow, for gathering together energies, ideas, creativity.  Perhaps
 
the older musicians and dancers could not jump so high nor move so quickly, but
 
the smaller movements and the less frequent notes so often had the elegance and
 
authority that comes only from mastery and from experience.  And the morale -
 
the enthusiasm of the old-young artists and artisans is death-defying.  Mr. Meincke
 
speaks again:
 
"I am more busy now than when I worked.  The time passes so fast you
 
don't realize how long you are working, because you are so interested
 
in what you are doing..
. "  
And Mrs. Williams says:
 
"My leg will be hurting and I will be sitting up in bed piecing. . .My
 
7
 
children get at me, "Mom, you're going to go blind," but I just like
 
to do it.  People love the way I put my colors together..."
 
And Carmen Maria Roman, who came to Cleveland in 1952 from Puerto Rico, and
 
who has taken up again the art of embroidery she learned as a girl...
 
"I love it, oh boy!  No more pills, no more nervous, I
'm happy!"
 
Sra. Roman works with her niece to produce traditional ornamental favors
 
for weddings, christenings and baptisms, elegant creations of lace ribbons and
 
embroidered flowers.
 They sometimes make as many as five hundred for a special
 
occasion, and the artist remarks, "If you don't have these at a wedding, it's
 
not really a wedding."  No wonder she is happy -
 she has resumed a vital role in
 
her own culture aided appropriately by a young relative.
 
Here we begin to see the life cycle of a single artist repeating and overlapping
 
with the brand new oncoming second generation in a never-ending linked chain.
 
Admittedly this is an idealized picture, but most diagrams or analytic schemes
 
are just exactly that:
 idealizations of the knobbly, awkward and ungovernable
 
reality; and a pattern, even though it may not exactly fit any single individual
 
or situation, can still express an essential truth.  What we see, over and over
 
again, not just in the United States but round the world, is that the three
 
generations that overlap in their individual lifetimes interact in the following
 
pattern:
 the grandparents inspire and instruct the children while the adult
 
parents work to support and protect both the young and the old, until such time
 
as they themselves become the grandparents and their own children take up the
 
middle year tasks and a new generation of young ones come along.
 
The late great anthropologist, Margaret Mead, was once asked at a public forum
 
what was the most vital problem in the United States of the 1970's.  Without
 
pausing a beat, she said, "How to put the grandparents back into contact with the
 
grandchildren."  It is dismally true that within the contemporary United States,
 
at least, changing patterns of housing, employment, and family structures have
 
driven deep rifts into the vital communicative chain that has transmitted cultural
 
1
 
8
 
values skills and morale across the generations for millenia.
 It is a deeply
 
troubling situation.
 I myself, with grandchildren on both coasts and a career
 
that keeps me running fast into my middle sixties, find myself dropping in via
 
jet plane, like a modern-day Mary Poppins, on my beloved grandchildren, and
 
dropping right back out in no more than a week.  We barely get to say hello.
 
What can be done about all this?  Well, I
'm just a folklorist, and I don't
 
have any particular solution to recommend, but I have observed a few factors
 
that I think we could work with to our great benefit.
 For instance, in connection
 
with my job as a grants officer for an arts agency, I have often asked folk artists
 
that I meet what they would really most like to be doing.  A poignantly large
 
number of the older ones say that what they would really like to do is teach young
 
people.
 Over and over they say that they want to get into the schools, to work
 
with the children, to be allowed to be in touch with the generation that has always
 
been their special historical responsibility.
 Can this not ever be arranged?
 
Not everywhere, of course, nor with every senior citizen, many of whom announce
 
forthrightly that they have done their bit for future generations and want to
 
relax for a while.  But so very many artists -
-
 especially, it seems, the artists -
-
really long for a genuine contact with the young.
 
The city of Ann Arbor tried to follow through on Dr. Mead's suggestion by
 
circularizing their senior citizens with an invitation to come help out in the
 
schools if they wanted.  The last I heard the idea had worked out very well
 
without special funding or supervisory bureaucracy -
 just the seniors who wanted
 
to coming into the schools and helping the children out in crafts programs or
 
cooking or whittling or American history or Poetry.
 Some of them got help with
 
transportation and most of them got a hot lunch but that was all.
 I don't know
 
what the situation is now, but it really doesn't seem important -
-
 if it worked
 
for a while, then that's fine, and every community will have to work out their
 
own particular pattern anyway.  The basic idea is to use the schools as a meeting
 
ground for seniors and children when their own grandparents and their own
 
9
 
grandchildren are far away.
 
Another observation that is crystal clear to any folklorist is that our
 
older citizens are incomparable aesthetic resources. 
So much of the gerontological
 
literature that I glance through basically treats the elderly as a problem, and
 
old age as a time of life when a burdensome series of special conditions have to
 
be met.
 In folk arts, the elderly are, generally speaking, thought of as the
 
solution, rather than the problem (or at least as a solution) and we worry about
 
meeting their needs in order that they may continue to be productive and counselling
 
and helping us onward with their wisdom and experience and toughness and smarts.
 
It's quite a different point of view, and I recommend it to all those who work
 
with the elderly.
 It's a more respectful and considerate stance, and that is
 
always productive of cooperation and achievement.
 
Finally, I would like to suggest that the overall every-other-generational
 
pattern that I refer to as "the chain" is an infinitely subtle and effective
 
communicative pattern that provides both for continuity and for change in proportions
 
that are balanced with extraordinary delicacy.  We will neither remain mired in
 
the past nor careen rudderless into the mysterious future if we can respectfully
 
help maintain this age-old system of order.
 In it, both the old and the young
 
have their appointed responsibilities, their traditional and crucial roles.
 
(They may, of course, swap positions and often do; I know many radical grandparents
 
and plenty of conservative children, but in general a certain balance tends to
 
maintain.)
 Even in such mundane interactions as learning to make baking powder
 
biscuits or how to tune a fiddle "Sebastopol" style, the leit-motifs of "Well,
 
the way I always heard it" and "But why couldn't it?" intertwine in a never-ending
 
ballet of push and shove, give and take, calm and excitement, stability and
 
'
 
C
-''('

±
 It's a great system, and I hate to see it weakening because half of
 
the participants are in retirement villages and the other half have gone off to
 
day camp.
 
10
 
I have wandered a bit, it may seem, from my central topic of folk arts and
 
the elderly.  But not really.  Our traditional arts, the ways of magnifying and
 
decorating our lives through which we express our sense of ourselves and our
 
belongingness to our own special people, are the essential preserve of experienced
 
and senior practitioners.  They often appear simple, but a lifetime may be needed
 
to get them just exactly right.  And all this experience, all this devotion and
 
skill turns to ashes, if the human chain is not in working order, if there is no
 
one to pass the art on to.
 The late black quilter, Pecolia Warner of Yazoo City,
 
Mississippi sums it all up,
 
"I worked that to grow up in me, of making quilts.
 That was a gift,
 
that's my talent.  Making quilts, that's my calling.  And since I
 
learned when I was young I haven't forgotten it.
 I don't necessarily
 
altogether piece them for myself.
 I like to help people with them...
 
just giving them for the "remember me"...

such a concentration on older artists?  Tã.-repeat

seem to be

so much so that I believe that, even if the Folk Arts panel had tried to come up

nature of folk arts and the nature of the general human life cycle.  Let us take
 
up first the nature of t
he folk arts.
 
As we note in the Folk Arts Program guidelines, "the folk and traditional
 
arts have grown through time within the many groups that make up any nation -
-
groups that share the same ethnic heritage, language, occupation, religion, or
 
geographic area "  They are the "homegrown, traditional artistic activities of
 
such groups
 and they serve both to identify and to symbolize the group that
 
originated them "  A list of examples might include, Samoan story telling, Ozark
 
ballads, Irish step dances,
' Southeast Asian embroidery.  Almost always, these art
 
forms have been learned informally, by casual or not-so-casual observation, or
 
by being "shown," often a relatively brief experience.  On the whole, one does not
 
go to Julliard to learn how to play a hammer dulcimer, nor are there many courses
 
available, even in our technical schools, in how to build an Eskimo skin boat.
 
American society does not ordinarily place much stock in informal learning.

Just a bit of reflection, though, impresses upon one the universality of
 
those early childhood experiences when one drifted off to sleep to the strains of

the spare dignity of furniture built in the Shaker style, an equal number of elegant
 
di stinctions are being learned, even though not taught.. Each one of us grows yp
 
within an aesthetic environment that helps us i
dentify and express from whence we
 
come, whether or not we practice or personally participate in the local art forms.
 
Thus we come to know early on whether our folks like to worship God with big
 
massed choirs or solo voices, to dance to oompah bands or to blue grass combos,
 
to sleep under overshot coverlets or

blankets.  And depending upon individual temperament, family attitudes, the demands
 
of the larger society, and a myriad other variables, each of us may dedicate some
 
some part of ourselves to emulating those artistic features and techniques we most
 
admire during our growing up days.  We may begin to try playing the fiddle, clogging,
 
whittling, singing harmony.
 
lot can be learned by observation and trial-and-error, or simply being part
 
of the scene.  But there are techniques, materials, specifics that are harder to
 
come by.  Where is the young learner to turn?  Typically,  to the grandparental
 
generation.  Parents are generally pretty busy people, earning the money, raising
 
the babies, putting food on the table and clothes on the backs, running the farm
 
or the household or the store or fulfilling the demands of the job.  Even thinking
 
about teaching a young child can be an added imposition, though most parents will
 
"shew" a t
hing or two on the fly.  But the longer term more serious learning 
relationships generally skip
 In a recent exhibit of Older Cleveland
 
Folk Artists sponsored by the Cleveland Department of Aging several of the artists
 
tell typical stories:  Mrs. Anna Jesenko, a Slovenian bobbin lace maker recalls,
 
jl learned to make the lace when I was eight years old .
... I didn't
 
L
VI
 
go to
 i
ool for bobbin lace because I learned at home.  when you
 
I
 
learn, you never forget.  I
'm eighty-one years old now and what I
 
learned at that time is still in my head.  The older ladies, like
 
the ones who come from our village, they die, and the young ones
 
they don't know how to do it.  When their mothers die, they throw
 
i
t away.  Now they would like to learn, and they don't have no
 
pillow, no bobbins.  They don't realize.  I don't think my daughters
 
know how to make bobbin lace, because they were small I no think
 
about i
t, to teach them, because that i
s
. the best t
ime to teach
 
the kids.  And then later, now, they are too busy.  But I try to
 
teach my grandson's wife..."
 
Ralph C. Meincke, a 72 year old Cleveland carver and duck decoy maker says,
 
"I taught my grandson to carve.  I
t takes a lot of t
ime to show
 
and explain.  Many, many weeks he came here, and we both sat down
 
and I gave hint a bird to carve.  While I was carving one, he did
 
the same thing to learn.  Then he taught his father to carve, but
 
it was harder for my son to learn..."
 
( Mrs. Magg1e T. Williams, an Afro-American quilter gives us a final variation:
 
"Mama taught me way back in Arkansas and now I
'm enjoying it.  Me
 
and my mother did it together, until she passed.  We didn't piece
 
together.  She'd piece hers and I
'd piece mine, but we'd quilt
 
together.  She taught n
te
' k W to do -different things.  She taught
 
me how to raise children and I try to carry i
t on like she taught
 
me.  I came to Cleveland in 1979.  Now I
'm sisty-three... I just
 
love to piece quilts.  I don't know how come.  I just love to piece
 
quilts... My daughter could piece quilts,
 bu ts
 don't have time.
 
And so I reckon when she gets older, she may do i
t.  I hope so..."
 
We are  changing the focus of our dis ussion from the 1earner to  h _
h i., 
from  the younger to the older, and a sense of pattern is beginning to emerge
 
from all the v'
 les.  A number of years ago I taught folklore at a state
 
AD
  
5
 
university in California, an area often setLied down in by retirees.  My
 
students were all expected to do some field work, and a regular semester
 
assignment was to seek out and do a structured interview with someone over
 
sisty-five.  Over and over again my horrified students protested they didn't
 
know anyone over sixty-five; over and over I brutally replied, "They're all
 
around; go make friends.  Heck, you might even try talking to your grandfather!"

My students and I became able almost to graph the career lines of these
 
art
 s
o  All of them had been exposed to their eventual art form in childhood,
 
normally by "picking i
t up," watching fine musicians or artisans, absorbint the
 
aesthetic criteria, getting the feel of what is good and what is better, becoming
 
excited, trying a skill out, making mistakes, getting corrected.  Some were
 
6
 
universalists, trying out a bit of many crafts and styles, some fewer became
 
entrapped, one might almost say, in a single art form early and made it their
 
own speciality.
 
Childhood moved into young adulthood with increasing energies shown most
 
frequently by the musicians and dancers (
they're good for courtship, after all).
 
But with marriage and growing family responsibi1ities,.
.
.much
. of. the artistic activity
 
slacked off; a kind of general latency period set in and life became real and
 
earnest and the "old ways" began to seem less beau
.tiful and interesting.  My files
 
contain perhaps a hundred interviews containing one or more of the following
 
statements here paraphrased for convenience into one.  "I don't know, I just
 
stopped quilting (or fiddle playing or embroidery or any number of things) while
 
the children were growing up.  I was too -tired, and we wanted so many things you
 
had to buy and the old things just got to seem too old-fashioned and corny.  And
 
then there wasn't any time."
 
But with the arrival of the fifties and-sixties , many resumed their old art
 
form like a second care
?with all the enthusiasm of teen-agers -
-
 and infinitely
 
more knowledge and subtlety.
 
We began almost to wonder whether the long middle
 
period of inactivity was not so much a time of abandonment of the art  sa time
 
for lying fallow, for gathering together energies, ideas, creativity.,
,

the older musicians and dancers could not jump so high nor move so quickly, but
 
the smaller movements and the less frequent notes so often had the elegance and
 
authority that comes only from mastery and from experience.  And the morale -
-
the enthusiasm of the oldopol f
t artists and artisans is death-defying. Abnw4k-knnke

Carmen Maria Roman, who came to Cleveland in 1952 from Puerto Rico, and
 
who has taken up again the art of embroidery she learned as a girl
4 7 ç 1.
 
"I love i
t, oh boy!  No more pills, no more nervous, I
'm happy!"
 
Sra. Roman works with her niece to produce traditional ornamental favors
 
for weddings, christenings and baptisms, elegant creations of lace ribbons and
 
embroidered flowers.  They sometimes make as many as five hundred for a special
 
occasion, and the artist remarks, "if you don't have these at a wedding, it's
 
not really a wedding."  No wonder she is happy -
 she has resumed avttal role in
 
her own culture aided appropriately by a young relative4
 
Here we begin to see the life cycle of a single artist repeating and overlapping
 
with the brand new oncoming second generation in a never-ending l
inked chain.
 
Admittedly this is an idealized picture, but most diagrams or analytic schemes
 
are just exactly that:  idealizations of the knobbly, awkward and ungovernable
 
reality; and a pattern, even though i
t may not exactly fit any single individual
 
or situation, can still express an essential truth.  What we see, over and over
 
again, not just in the United States but round the world, is that the three
 
generations that overlap in their individual lifetimes interact in the following
 
pattern:
 the grandparents inspire and instruct the children while the adult
 
parents work to support and protect both the young and the old, until such time
 
as they themselves become the grandparents and their own children take up the
 
middle year tasks and a new generation of young ones come along.
 
The late great anthropologist, Margaret Mead, was once asked at a public forum
 
what was the most vital problem in the United States of the 1970's.  Without
 
pausing a beat, she said, "How to put the grandparents back into contact with the
 
grandchi1dre ." It is dismally true that within the contemporary United States,
 
at least, changing patterns of housing, employment, and family structures have
 
driven deep rif ts i
nto the vital communicative chain that has transmitted c tur±1
 
8
 
values skills and morale across the generations for
 
troubling situation.

with my job as a grants officer for an arts agency, I have often asked folk artists
 
that I meet what they would really most like to be doing.  A poignantly large
 
number of the older ones say that what they would really like to do is teach young
 
people.  t
0ver
 a
nd over they say that they want to get into the.schQQlS, to work
 
with the children, to be allowed to be in touch with the generation that has always
 
* 
been their special historical responsibility. tCan this im ever be arranged?
 
Not everywhere, of course, nor with every senior citizen, many of whom announce
 
forthrightly that they have done their bit for future generations and want to
 
relax for a while.  But so very many artists -

city of Ann Arbor tried to follow through on Dr. Mead ' suggestion by
 
circularizing their senior citizens with an invitation to come help out in the
 
schools if they wanted.  The last- 1
 aa the idea had worked out very well
 
without special funding or supervisory bureaucracy -
-
 just the seniors who wanted
 
to coming into the schools and helping the children out in crafts programs or
 
cooking or whittling or American history or Poetry.  Some of them got help with
 
transportation and most of them got a hot lunch but  that
 was  all.  I don't know
 
what the situation is now, but

Another observation that is crystal clear to any folklorist i
s that our
 
older citizens are incomparable aesthetic resources. So much of the gerontolo
Cal
 
literature that I glance through basically treats the elderly as
 and
 
old age as a time of life when a burdensome series of special conditions have to
 
be met.  In folk arts, the elderly are, generally speaking, thought of as the

soluL ,n, rather t
han the problem (
or at least as a solution) and we worry about
 
meeting their needs in order that they may continue to be pro ductive
 
I
  
and help
 us onward with their wisdom and experience and toughness and smarts.
 
I
t's quite a different point of view, and I recommend i
t to a
ll those who work
 
with the elderly.
 It's a more respectful and considerate stance, and that is
 
always productive of cooperation and achievement.
 
Finally, I would like to suggest that the overall every-other--generational
 
pattern that I refer to as "the chain" Is an i
nfinitely s
ubtle and effective
 
communicative pattern that provides both for continuity and for change in propo ti
.9tS
 
that are balanced with extraordinary delicacy.  We will neither remain mired in
 
the past nor careen rudderless into the mysterious future if we can respectfully
 
help maintain  this age-old system of order.  In it, both the old and  the young
 
have their appointed responsibilities, their traditionaL
  nd en iaL 91g . 
(
They may, of course, swap positions and often do; I know many radical grandparents
 
and plenty of conservative children, but in general a certain balance tends to
 
maintain.)  Even in such mundane interactions as learning to make baking powder
 
biscuits or how to tune a fiddle "Sebastopol" style, the leit-motifs of "Well,
 
the way   always heard it" and "But why couldn't i

t's a great system, and I hate to see it weakenin

Our traditional arts, the ways of magnifying and
 
decorating our lives through which we express our sense of ourselves and our
 
belongingneSS to our own special people, are the essential preserve of experienced
 
and senior practitioners
 They often appear simple, but a lifetime may be needed
 
to get them just exactly right.
nd all this experience, all this devotion and
 
skill turns to ashes, if the human chain is not in working order, if there s no
 
ass the art on to.
:
 
The late black quilter, Pecolia Warner of Yazoo City,
 
Mississippi sums it all up,
 
"I worked that to grow up in me, of making quilts.  That was a gift,
 
that's my talent.  Making quilts, that's my calling.  And since I
 
learned when I was young I haven't forgotten it.  I don't necessarily
 
altogether piece them for myself.
 I like to help people with them...
 
just giving them for t
he "remember me"...

he 1

here were hundreds o
f small potteries s
upplying ware e

t
o f

 Mississippi

, 'They were l

Sometimes t

emembers t

ugar, s
odv and s

Some s
imple e

roduced on English coastal p

As i
