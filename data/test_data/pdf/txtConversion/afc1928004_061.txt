We 
all do like the pretty girls, 
We see them day by day, 
And haw at first sight fall in love, 
When e'er they pass that way, 
But a 
charming girl, the other morn, 
I 
saw come walking by, 
And, as she gazed, I 
saw she had 
A dark and roguish eye. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never can forget her, 
The first time that I 
met her, 
And, as I 
looked, my fate was booked, 
I 
sealed it with a 
sigh: 
I 
found that I 
had fell in love 
With a 
dark and roguish eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, 
Hooped up so gay and neat, 
And as she went to cross the way, 
I 
saw her pretty feet, 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Divas marked L-u-c-y; 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me with 
A 
dark and roguish eye. 
I 
never can forget her, &c. 
Of course, this little chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said her father he was rich, 
He lately had struck Re. 
But as I 
exclaimed: Will you be mine? 
Her fellow he came by; 
Walk off! he said, or I'll give you 
A dark and roguish eye! 
I 
never can forsst her, &c.

THE MABEL WALTZ. 
As 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
once did know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat; 
She used to run a 
sewing-machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose; 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, and pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn-up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twas a 
fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
Up at Irving Hall. 
CHORUS. 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought she ever would prove false; 
Her step was light as the bounding fawn, dancing .the Mabel 
Waltz. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked; 
And, every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk. 
I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store, 
And also bought her a 
new silk-dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead broke, 
And I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
[CHORUS. 
And, then, I 
thought 'twas getting time 
The question for to pop. 
I 
went one day dressed in my best, 
Straight down to the shop: 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
My charmer had, that very day, 
Just gone out of town. 
Judge my feelings when Miss Brown 
These cruel words let slip: 
It's my opinion she s 
gone off 
Upon her wedding trip. 
[CHORUS. 
"NiTALTUNG DOWN BROADWAY." 
And when a 
year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see 
My fair, but false one, sitting 
With a 
baby on her knee. 
I 
quickly marched into the house, 
And, there, what met my view! 
'Twas a 
tall Policeman, six feetligh, 
He was her husband, too! 
He collared me, and then commenced 
A 
series of assaults, 
I 
never chassez'd it so fast before, 
While dancing the Mabel Waltz. 
[CHORUS. 
" 
WALKING DOWN BROADWAY." 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
The sweeteet thing in life 
And no one dare say nay, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
Is walking down Broadway. 
My sisters, thro' the Park 
And at Long Branch wish to stay, 
But / prefer to walk 
Down the festive, gay Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway— walking down Broadway— 
The 0. K. thing on Saturday is walking down Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway—the festive, gay Broadway; 
The 0 K thing on Saturday, is walking down Broadway. 
Last Wednesday afternoon 
My cousin Will did say, 
"Nellie, come along with Fee, 
I'll take you down Broadway, 
To the Theatre Comique, 
To see Captain Jinks so gay; 
Then we'll dine at Delmonico's, 
'Fore returning down Broadway." 
DIALOGUE.—And I 
must say ladies and gentlemen, with all 
due deference to other pleasures in life, there's nothing so 
charming as— 
Walking down Broadway, ezo.

THE RIVER ROE. 
As I 
went out one evening, all in the month of June, 
The primroses, and daisies, and violets were in bloom, 
I 
espied a 
lovely fair one, and her I 
did not know, 
I 
took her for an angel that was bathing in the Roe. 
Her teeth were like ivory, her skin a 
lily white, 
Her cheeks as red as roses, her eyes like diamonds bright, 
Her surname I'll not tell, lest you might her know, 
Bat her master's habitation is on the River Roe. 
I 
quickly stepped up to her, and this to her did say; 
" 
Are you a 
goddess, or what brought you this way ?" 
She answered me right modestly, and said; " I 
am not so, 
I'm but a 
servant maid that was bathing in the Roe." 
I 
said: " my pretty fair maid, if with me you'll agree, 
We'll join our hands in wedlock, and wedded we will be, 
My Father he's a 
nobleman, the country well does know, 
And his dwelling lies convenient to the River Roe." 
She quickly made me answer, and this to me did say: 
"My mistress she is waiting, I 
have no time to stay, 
I'll meet you to-morrow, and my mistress won't know, 
We have some conversing on the River Roe." 
They both shook hands and parted, from each other did go, 
In hopes to meet next morning along the River Roe, 
She dressed herself in private, away then she did go, 
Her true-love he was waiting along the River Roe. 
9 
EVER OF THEE. 
When she came up to him, he thus to her did say: 
" 
l'm glad to meet you here, my love, upon this very day, 
l'IR glad to meet you here, love, the way that I 
will know, 
If you're going to wed with me, and dwell beside the River Roe. 
She modestly did answer, and said: " She was canthnt," 
I 
kissed and embraced her, and then away both went, 
We were married next evening, as you will shortly know, 
She has servants to attend her, and she dwells upon the Roe. 
It was within ten miles of Newton, convenient to the tide, 
You'll find my habitation convenient to the soil, 
You will see ships from Limerick sailing down the silvery tide, 
And the lads and lasses sparking along the river side. 
Farewell to friends and parents, and to the flowing quay, 
Likewise my old acquaintance, and I 
have no time to stay, 
Here is a 
health to my own sweetheart, the girl that you 
know, 
And we will sing to the maid that dwells along the River Roe. 
EVER OF THEE. 
Ever of thee I'm fondly dreaming, 
Thy gentle voice my spirit can cheer; 
Thou wert th3 star that, mildly beaming, 
Shone o'er my path when all was dark and drear; 
Still in my heart thy form I 
cherish; 
Every kind thought, like a 
bird, flies to thee. 
Oh, oh! never, till life and mem'ry perish, 
Can I 
forget how dear thou art to me; 
Morn, noon and night, where'er I 
may be, 
Fondly I'm dreaming ever of thee. 
Ever of thee, when sad and lonely, 
Wandering afar, my soul joyed to dwell; 
And then I 
felt I 
loved thee only, 
All ,eemed to fade before affection's spell; 
Years have not chilled the love I 
cherish; 
True as the stars bath my heart been to thee. 
Oh, oh never, till life and mem'ry perish, 
Can I 
forget how dear thou art to me; 
Morn, noon and night, where'er I 
may be, 
Fondly I 
am dreaming ever of thee.

WRITE ME A LETTER FROM HOME. 
Words and Music by W ILL S. 
H AYS. 
Lonely I 
sit me and weep— 
Weep as I 
have not for years. 
Why do mine eyes fail to keep 
Back these affectionate tears ? 
I 
think of dear ones, o'er the sea, 
Who love me whereever I 
roam 
Oh! go to them, tell them for me 
To write me a 
letter from home! 
CHORUS. 
Have they forgotten me now ? Or do they expect me to come ? 
No, no; go and tell them for me,to write me a 
letter from home! 
I 
think of the old-fashioned cot— 
I've left it for m my a 
year— 
The last words: " God bless you I" I've got 
From my mother and father so dear. 
They hoped that my voyage would be 
A 
pleasant one over the foam! 
Oh! some one go tell them for me, 
To write me a 
letter from home! 
Cnonus—Have they forgotten me, &c. 
Yes, We'll Write You a 
Letter from Home. 
A RESPONSE TO " 
WRITE ME A LETTER FROM HOME." 
Composed by H ENRY TUCKER. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To tell how were longing to hear 
The footsteps that nevermore come, 
The voice that to us was so dear; 
For, oh you are still, still the same, 
Tho' dark, raging seas may divide; 
We sigh when we hear your dear name, 
To welcome you back to our side. 
CHORUS. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, we dream of you, darling, 
each night; 
We love you wherever you roam, we'll kiss ev'ry word that we. 
write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To bear you our love o'er the sea, 
To gladden your heart as you roams 
And cheer you wherever you be. 
'Tis lonely while you are away, 
For sweet was the joy that you gave; 
Oh! sadly we pine while you stray; 
Come back o'er the lone weary Ix ave. 
CHORUS— We'll write you a 
letter, Ike.

CROOS-KEEN LAWN. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman does his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet scented lawn, 
While I, more blest than they, 
Spend each happy night and day 
With my smiling little Croos-keen lawn, lawn, lawn. 
Oh, my smiling little Croos-keen lawn. 
Leante ruma Croos-keen, 
Sleante gar ma voor meh neen 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban, ban, b,au, 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban. 
In court with manly grace, 
Should Sir Toby plade his case, 
And the merits of his cause make known, 
Without his cheerful glass, 
He'd be stupid as an ass, 
So he takes a 
little Cross-keen lawn. 
Leante ruma, ctc. 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Let's not part with lips so dry, 
Though the lark should proclaim it is dawn 
But if we can't remain, 
May we shortly meet again, 
To fill another Croos-keen lawn. 
Leante ruma, cto. 
And when grim death appears. 
After few but happy years, 
And tells me my glass it is run, run, run, 
I'll say, Begone, you slave, 
For great Bacchus gives me lave 
Just to fill another Croos-keen lawn,lawn, lawn.

THE WATCHKAN. 
The snow was falling fast and deep, 
And cold the North-wind swept, 
As the watchman paced his weary beat, 
And the little Orphan wept; 
And shivering on the door-step, 
He raised his eyes to where, 
Amid the warm and glittering halls, 
The rich man slumbered there. 
CHORUS. 
D-eam on, dream on, thou sleeper, 
Nor heed the tempest's roar, 
While the orphan child is weeping, 
In rags beside the door. 
Amid the gathering snow-drifts 
There comes a 
stalwart form, 
That breasts the icy whirlwind, 
And struggles in the storm; 
He bends above the outcast, 
Then looks, above to where, 
Amid the warm and cheerful hall, 
The rich man slumbered there. 
Dream On, dream on, &c. 
Well done! well done, thou watcher I 
He folds him to his breast, 
And within his arms he bears him, 
Where his drooping head may rest; 
And, in after years, his bosom felt 
No thrill that seemed so sweet 
As the memory of that midnight hour, 
And the orphan in the street! 
DIV41/1 on, dream on, &e. 
13 
THE WATCHER. 
The night was dark and fearful, 
The blast swept howling by, 
A 
watcher pale and tearful, 
Looked forth with anxious eye; 
How wistfully she gazeth, 
No gleam of morn was there,. 
Her eyes to Heaven she raiseth, 
In agony of prayer. 
How wistfully she gazeth, &a. 
Within that dwelling lonely, 
Where want and darkness reign, 
Her precious child, hr only, 
Lay moaning in his pain; 
And death alone can free him, 
She feels that this must be, 
But, oh! for morn to see him 
Smile once again on me. 
And death alone can free him, &c. 
A hundred lights are shining 
In yonder mansion fair, 
And merry feet are prancing— 
They heed not mourning there; 
Oh, young and joyous creatures, 
One lamp from out your store, 
Would lend that poor boy's features, 
To his mother's gaze once more. 
Oh, young and joyous creatures, &e. 
The summer sun is shining, 
She heedeth not its ray, 
Beside her bed reclining, 
The pale dead mother lay. 
A 
smile her lips was wreathing, 
A 
smile of hope and love, 
As though she were still breathing, 
" 
There's light for us above." 
A 
smile her lips was wreathing, &e.

THE BELLS OF SHANDON. 
Composed by FATHER PROUT. 
With deep affection and recollection,' 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sound so wild would, in days of childhood, 
Fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, -where'er I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee, 
With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate; 
But all their music spoke not like thine! 
For ment'ry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the Bells of ,Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole in--
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
Xut thy sounds were sweeter than the dome of Pete 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly— 
Oh! the Bells of Shandon. 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Kosko, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud in air calls men to prayer, 
From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
Such an empty phantom I 
freely grant them: 
lut there's an anthem more dear to me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound more grand on' 
Tho pleasant waters of the river Lee! 
UNDER THE GASLIGHT; 
OR, POOR LITTLE LAURA. 
Words by-GEo. COOPER. 
Music by H ENRY TUCKER. 
Under the gas-light, while the snow falls, 
And the chill night-wind wearily calls: 
When the lone beggar creeps to his shed, 
And the rich miser lies in his bed: 
Hear little Laura making her moan, 
Poor little orphan-child weeping alone: 
" 
Pity me, stranger, help me, I 
pray 
Father and mother have sent me away I" 
Under the gas-light, Laura's asleep, 
While the snow's mantle round her cloth creep: 
Louder the night-wind—no help is near, 
No one to calm her, no one to cheer— 
But, in her dreaming, wanders she now 
Where the bright Angels will smooth her fair brow, 
Well: for, the life-tide's ebbing so fast, 
All earthly suffering soon will be past. 
Under the gas-light, rescue is near! 
• 
Poor little Laura hush every fear! 
Kind hands have borne thee, far from the storm, 
Up to you Mansion kindly and warm. 
Dearer, far dearer love shall be thine, 
Through tears, the Future so brightly will shine, 
Now, among strangers, rest thy worn feet, 
Poor little orphan-child found in the street!

WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A MOTH  RR 
Words and Music by ALICE H AWTITORNE. 
What is home without a 
motner, 
What are all the joys we meet, 
When her loving smile no longer, 
Greets the coming, coining of our feet ; 
The days seem long, the nights are drear, 
And time rolls slowly on: 
And oh, how few are childhood's pleasures, 
When her gentle care is gone. 
Things we prize are first to vanish; 
Hearts we love to pass away, 
And how soon e'en in our childhood, 
We behold her turning, turning grey ; 
Her eyes grow dim, her step is slow 
Her joys of earth are past; 
And sometimes e're we learn to know her, 
She has breath'd on earth, on earth her last 
Older hearts may have their sorrows, 
Griefs that quickly die away, 
But a 
mother lost in childhood, 
Grieves the heart, the heart from day to day; 
We miss her kind, her willing hand, 
Her fond and earnest care; 
And ah how dark is life around us, 
What is home without without her there, 
WHEN I SAW SWEET NELLIE HOME. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
flushed the sound of daylight bustle, 
Closed the Pink-eyed Pimper nell. 
As adown the moss-grown wood path 
Where the cattle love to roam, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
CHORUS. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight shone, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
When the Autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all its leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by the elders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nellie told. 
On the star-bespangled dome, 
How I 
blessed the August evening, 
As we stood together gazing, 
When I 
saw sweet Nellie home. 
In the sky, &c. 
White hairs mingled with my tresses, 
Furrows stealing on my brow, 
But a 
love smile cheers and blesses 
Life's declining moments now. 
Matron in the snowy kerchief, 
Closer to my bosom come, 
Tell me—dost thou still remember 
When I 
saw thee, sweet Nellie, home ?

This song, which is the production of John B. Casey, " the 
Galtee Boy," who was an inmate of an English dungeon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the West, where it is 
often made the marching tune of bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of '98. 
It is sung to 
the Air of: " Wearing of the Green ;" 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrel, tell mewhere you hurry so ? 
Hush, ma bouchal! hush and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CHORUS. 
By the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the moon: 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherl
in' is to be ? 
In the ould spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word more: for signal-token, whistle up the march in' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Out from many a mud-wall cabin, eyes were watching thro' 
the night, 
Many a 
manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
light; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Down along yon singing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
High above their shining 
weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death to every foe and  
traitor! forward! strike the marchin' 
tune! 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! 'tis the rising of the Moon. 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate; 
Oh! what glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eight! 
But yet, thank God, there's beating hearts in manhood's burn-
ing-noon, 
Who will follow in their footsteps by the rising of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &e.

THE RISING OF THE MOO 19 
N.  
THE MINSTREL'S RETITRN'D FROM THE WAR 
The Minstrel's return'd from the war, 
With spirits as buoyant as air; 
And thus, on his tuneful guitar, 
He sings in the bower of his Fair: 
The noise of the battle is over, 
The bugle no more ca ls, to arms. 
A soldier no more but a 
lover, 
I 
kneel to the power of thy charms, 
Sweet lady, dear lady, I'm thine; 
I 
bend to the magic of beauty ;: 
Though the helmet and banner are mine, 
Yet love calls the soldier, to duty. 
The Minstrel his suit warmly prest; 
She blush'd, sigh'd and hung down her head, 
Till conquer'd she fell on his breast, 
And thus to the happy youth said, 
The bugle shall part us Love, never, 
My bosom they pillow shall be; 
rill death tears thee from me forever, 
Still faithful, I'll perish with thee, 
Sweet lady, dear lady, I'm thine; 
I 
bend to the magic of beauty, 
Though the helmet and banner are mine, 
Yet love calls the soldier to duty. 
But Fame call'd the Youth to the field; 
His Banner way'd over his head; 
Ile gave his guitar for a 
shield: 
But soon he laid low with the dead. 
While she o'er her young hero bending, 
Iteceiv'd his capiring adieu: 
I 
die, while my Country defending, 
With my heart to my lady-love true. , 
Oh! Death then she sigh'd I 
am thine! 
I 
tear off the roses of beauty— 
For, the grave of my hero is mine: 
He died true to love and to duty.

We have lived and. loved each other fond. and true: 
Ever tru9 to thee, though far away I've been,

But oh! those happy days will ne'er return, 
Those happy days that we have seen; 
For I 
am left to weep alone,

Oh ! how sad we've been, lost Evangeline, 
Since we laid thee where the sweetest flowers wave, 
And the angels bright, robed in spotless white, 
Are watclring o'er thy green and mossy grave. 
Evangeline, Evangeline, Evan g-eline, Evangeline, 
She's gone to the silent grave! 
I 
am lonely now, my dear Evangeline; 
The days are long, the nights are sad and drear; 
And. how changed; alas! each well-remembered scene, 
Since you and I 
were sitting here! 
Alas! you never more will smile on me— 
And. life is now a 
sad., sad dream— 
I 
lived to love none else but thee, 
My sweet Evangeline.

Oh! how sad. we've been, lost Evangeline, 
Since we laid thee where the sweetest flowers wave, 
And the angels bright, robed in spotless white, 
Are watching o'er thy green and mossy grave. 
Evangeline, Evangeline, Evangeline, Evangeline, 
She's gone to the silent grave! 
One evening, so late. as I 
rambled on the banks of a 
clear purl. 
ing stream, 
I 
sat myself down on a 
bed of primroses, and so gently fell into 
a 
dream. 
I 
dreamed I 
beheld. a 
fair female—her 
ne er saw before— 
As she sighed for the wrongs of her country, as she strayed 
along Erin's green shore. 
I 
quickly addressed this fair female: " My jewel, come tell me 
your name; 
For here in this country I 
know you're a 
stranger, or I 
would 
not have asked you the same." 
She resembled the Goddess of Liberty, and of Freedom the 
mantle she wire, 
As she sighed for the wrongs of her country as she strayed 
along Erin's green shore. 
" 
11- know you're a true son to Granue, and my secrets to you 
I'll unfold, 
For, here, in the midst of all dangers, not knowing my friends 
from foes. 
I'm a 
daughter of Daniel O'Connell, and from England I 
lately 
came o'er; 
I 
have come to awaken my brethren that slumber on Erin's 
green shore." 
Her eyes were like two sparkling diamonds, or the stars of a 
cold, frosty night; 
Her cheeks were like two blooming roses, and her teeth of the 
ivory so white; 
She resembled the Goddess of Freedom, and. green was the 
mantle she wore, 
Bound round with the Shamrock, and roses that grew along 
Erin's green shore. 
In transports of joy I 
awoke, and found I 
had been in a 
dream, 
For this beautiful damsel had 
fled 
me, 
and 
I 
longed 
to slumber 
again. 
May the Heavens above be her guardian! for I know I 
shall 
see her no more; 
May the sunbeams of glory shine o'er her, as she strays along 
Erin's green shore 1

To cut a

The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill, 
At the Balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout. 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
"

ON THE BEACH AT LONG- 
BRANCH. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
On the Beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was I 
in the plot— 
A Gent stood there bedside me--still I 
saw him not— 
Till, at last, by chance, my eyelids I 
did raise--
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured gaze— 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness—quite the pink of beaux. 
C110ItUS. 
°Twas on the beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his bride! 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did, exchange—his eyes with love did beam— 
Ere much time was over, we began to chat— 
And hours passed away—still he beside me sat— 
And with ways so winning he did love impart— 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
He told me that he loved me, vowed that all his life 
Would be to him worthless, unless I'd be his wife. 
'Twas on the beach, &c. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of Town. 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true, by all the Powers above! 
He asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say— 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I 
named the happy day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
He'd live alone for me, and I 
alone for him! 
Spoken.—And I 
can assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, he 
is one of those dear delightful fellows that no young girl could 
resist, and I'm very happy and proud to say: Up to the pres-
ent moment I've no cause to regret that 
'Twas on the beach, & e.

AS THROUGH TFM. PARK I 
GO. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
Oh! I'm a 
girl that's fond of life, 
My age is twenty-one, 
I 
am averse to noise and strife, 
But very fond of fun; 
And though to vice I'm not incliied, 
I 
like the flattery of mankind, 
And always like to speak my mind, 
Alike to every one. 
CHORUS. 
For as through the park I 
go, 
The gents all want to know, 
" 
Who is that darling girl that drives so fast ?" 
They'd like to know. 
I 
live at home with dear mam-ma, 
And do just as I 
will, 
While lovers come from near and far, 
And me with nonsense fill; 
But I 
tell them all, I'll be a 
nun, 
And beg they will at once have done, 
But then they say, I'm only in fun, 
As I 
laugh behind my fan. 
Spoken.—Well, of course I 
am in fun sometimes. 'Twas 
only the other evening, mam-ma took me to a 
ball, and bought 
me this new dress from Madame Wintle for the occasion, for 
mam-ma said, I 
must put on my best smiles and graces, for I 
was getting rather old and it was quite time I 
was off her 
hands. 
Poor rnam-ma! she always has my interest at heart. 
So after the Ball was over one dear young fellow began to ad-
dress me, and I 
really thought he was going to propose, but 
another gent came in and spoiled it all, and I've many times 
heard them both remark— 
" 
As through the park I 
go, &c."

OLD HATS AND RAGS. 
As sung by the GREAT LIE CARD. 
Old hats old rags! my trouble is great, 
Could I 
be in a 
more wretched state, 
I 
feel indeed my heart it will break; 
List, and I 
will tell you of my wrongs, 
Hark and I 
will my woes unfold; 
By a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold, 
And through her I've lost all my nice gold, 
My heart and my gold is both gone. 
CB ORUS 
Old hats, old rags, my- cry is old rags: 
This bag on my back, the streets I 
drag, 
And Ruth, mine Ruth, I 
did love her so, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Sho lived down an area in Union Square, 
And every day I 
did pass me by there, 
She was possess'd of beauty most rare, 
And one day she beckoned me to come, 
She had some old hats to exchange for new. 
She melted the heart of this poor Jew, 
And how I 
loved her! A 
h, just a 
few, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Old hats, old rags, &c. 
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my lees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my dear wife and not to say nay, 
And then she agreed to be mine; 
But, oh my heart, I 
must have been cream, 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
seam, 
And gave ten dollars to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, &c. 
She said, Now, dear Slotchzein, soon you'll be mine, 
Drink my good health in a 
glass of old wine, 
It must have been poisonad, for I 
slept such a 
time, 
Which she turned it to profit it seems; 
For when I 
awoke, I 
thought I 
must choke, 
I 
was tied by the arms and legs with a 
rope, 
And Ruth had hooked it with mine coat, 
With a 
thousand dollars sewed in the seam.

BITTER BEER. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD 
The subject of my little song, 
Is one I 
hold most dear, 
It supports our Constitution, 
And it will for many a 
year; 
John 
would surely be defunct, 
Or 
look rather queer, 
If Bass & Co. should cease to brew 
Their glorious " Bitter Beer."* 
Allsop, Bass ez Co., they each deserve a monument, so give 
them while we're here, 
Three cheers for Bass and Allsop, and their glorious " Bitter 
Beer." 
I've tasted " Hock " and Claret too, 
Madeira and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid swell; 
Of all complaints from " A 
to Z," 
The fact is very clear, 
There's no disease but what's been cured 
By Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &e. 
I've lived in Scotland many years, 
And drank its mountain dew, 
I 
don't deny but what it's good, 
And a 
stimulant, it's true. 
rm far from being prejudiced, 
As many think, I 
fear, 
But give to me a 
cooling draught, 
Of Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
*Pronounced " Bit-tah Bee-ah."

Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your eye; 
For, sure there's a 
charm love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling, 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal, 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling, 
That I 
love you, sweet Norah O'Neal. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal; 
Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling, sweet Norah O'Neal! 
Oh! the nightingale sings in the wild-wood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Norah, of you; 
But I 
think, love, so often about you, 
And you don't know how happy I 
feel, 
But I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling sweet Norah O'Neal! 
Oh! don't think that ever, &c. 
Oh! why should I 
weep tears of sorrow ? 
Or why to let hope lose its place ? 
Wont I 
meet you, my darling, to-morrow, 
And smile on your beautiful face ? 
Will you meet me ? 
Oh! say, will you meet me 
With a 
kiss at the foot of the lane ? 
And I'll promise whenever you greet me, 
That I'll never be lonely again. 
Oh! don't think that ever &c.

Is it lonely ye are then without me ? 
Only wait, and I'll come bye-and-bye, 
For, meself's just entirely as lonely, 
And, Darling, I 
give sigh for sigh. 
If the glance of my eye's like the star, love, 
If my voice sweetly sounds on your ear, 
In your own looks of love my eyes brighten, 
And my voice tender grows when you're near. 
CHORUS 
Is it lonely ye are then without me ? 
Only wait, and I'll come bye-and-bye, 
For, meself's just entirely as lonely, 
And, Darling, I

Sure, the nightingale's notes are delightful, 
When he warbles, at night, in the wood, 
And if birds taught us colleen's love's language, 
He's the sweet little Birdie that could, 
But it wasn't from him I 
learnt singing, 
Not from nightingale, no, nor from dove; 
'Tis my heart in my voice makes the music, 
When I 
see the dear Boy that I 
love. 
Is it lonely ye are then, &c. 
Then, my Darling, oh! speak not of sorrow, 
To her heart's core your Norah is true, 
She knows, Dennis dear, that you love her, 
And, Dennis, you know she loves you. 
And would ye then wait till to-morrow ? 
While the moon shines in heaven so bright, 
And the lane and the kiss so convanient, 
-Won't I 
meet you, my Darling, to-night! 
And would ye then wait till to-morrow ?

But I'm busted, and can't be beguiling, 
Though I'm trying to raise a 
square meal. 
Then, Jimmy, you never must beat me, 
I 
have no more stamps to conceal;. 
Oh! I'm lonely for some one to treat me. 
And trying to raise a 
square meal! 
Oh! the lager flows free in Hoboken, 
As if every glass that was drew, 
Informed me that excise was broken, 
And reminds me of Bourbon and you, 
But I've drank, Jim, so often without you, 
And you don't know how jolly I 
reel; 
But I'm thirsty to-night, Jim, without you, 
And trying to raise a 
square meal! 
Then, Jimmy, you never, &c. 
Oh! why should I 
beat or go borrow ? 
Why should I 
let pluck lose its place ? 
Won't you treat me, dear Jimmy, to-morrow, 
As I 
smile on your rum-beaten face? 
Won't you treat me ? oh! say, won't you treat me, 
With some sugar and gin, at the lane ? 
And I'll promise, whenever you treat me, 
That I 
never will beat you again. 
Then, Jimmy, you never, &c. 
]'MET ME IN THE LANE. 
Composed by CHARLES BLA3IPHIN. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Nine, 
In ecstacy again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling. 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose: 
When evening stars are peeping, 
Oh! then will be our meeting, 
Old time too swiftly fleeting 
Our happy time away. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes nine, 
In ecsta,cy again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro' loving thee so madly,

When the clock strikes nine, 
In ecstacy again, love, 
To call thee mine, 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose. 
I'll leave thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Ten, 
And faithful will remain, love, 
Believe me then: 
Deceive thee I 
I 
will never. 
And breath from me must sever, 
If I 
forget thee ever, 
My sweet Mountain Rose I 
Thy presence care dispelling, 
All other charms excelling, 
Oh ! what to grace my dwelling 
As thee my Mountain Rose. 
Then meet me in the lane, &o.

THE FLYING TRAPEZE. 
Once I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and, to mourn— 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens. 
The girl that I 
loved, she was handsome— 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please; 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well 
Like that man upon the Trapeze. 
CHORUS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A daring young man on the flying Trapeze— 
His movements were graceful: all girls he could please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was Signor Bona Slang; 
Tall, big and handsome, as well made as Chang; 
Where'er he appeared, the Hall loudly rang— 
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below; 
And., one night, he smiled on my love, 
She winked back at him, and he shouted: Bravo! 
As he hung by his nose up above. [CHORUS_
. 
Her father and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride. 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail: she went there every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her: how he ran me down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. 
[C
HORUS. 
One night, I, as usual, went to her dear home, 
Found there her mother and father alone; 
I 
asked for my love: and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away! 
She'd packed up her box and eloped, in the night, 
'With him, with the greatest of ease: 
From two stories high, he had lowered her down, 
To the ground on his flying Trapeze! [CnoRus. 
Some months after this, I 
went to a 
Hall, 
Was greatly surprised to see, on the wall, 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him I 
4 
MARY OF ARGYLE. 
He taught her gymnastics, and dressed her in tights, 
To help him to live at his ease, 
And made her assume a 
masculine name! 
And now she goes on the Trapeze! 
CHORUS. 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease, 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying Trapeze. 
She does all the work, while he takes his ease, 
And that's what's become of my love I 
MARY OF ARGYLE. 
I 
have heard the mavis singing, 
His love-song to the morn, 
I 
have seen the dew-drops clinging, 
To the rose just newly-born; 
But a 
sweeter song has cheered me, 
At the evening's gentle close, 
I 
have seen an eye still brighter, 
Than the dew-drops on the rose, 
'Twas thy voice, my gentle Mary, 
And thine artless, -winning smile, 
That made this world an Eden, 
Bonny Mary of Argyle. 
Tho' thy voice may lose its sweetness, 
And thine eye its brightness too, 
Tho' thy step may lose its fleetness, 
And thy hair its sunny hue, 
Still to me shalt thou be dearer, 
Than all the world can own. 
I 
have loved thee for thy beauty, 
But not for that alone. 
I 
have watched thy heart, dear Mary, 
And, its goodness was the wile 
That has made thee mine forever, 
Bonny Mary of Argyle.

SWINGING IN THE LANE. 
Words and Music by CHARLES CARROL SAWYER.. 
How oft we talked of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play 
Upon each other, while at school 
To pass the time away! 
But, oh! how often have I 
longed 
For those bright days again, 
When little rosy Nell and I 
Went swinging in the lane! 
CHORUS. 
But yet I'd give the world to be 
With rosy Nell again, 
I 
never, never will forgot 
Our swinging in tbc lane! 
The boys and girls would often go 
A- fishing in the brooks' 
With spools of thread f
or fishing-lines, 
And bendcd pins for hooks; 
They, sometimes, wished me with them, but 
They, always, wished in vain; 
I'd rather be with rosy Nell, 
A-swinging in the lane. 
But yet I'd, &e. 
But soon a 
cloud of sorrow came— 
A strange young man, from town, 
Was introduced to rosy Nell 
By Aunt Jemima Brown. 
She stayed away from school next day— 
The truth to me was plain— 
She'd gone with that there city chap, 
A-swinging in the lane I 
But yet I'd, &e. 
Now all young men with tender hearts, 
Pray take advice from me: 
Don't be so quick to fall in love 
With every girl you see; 
For, if you do, you soon will find 
You've only loved in vain; 
she'll go off with some other chap, 
A-swinging in the lane 
But yet I'd, &e_ 
SLIDING ON THE CELLAR, DOOR. 
A PARODY ON " SWINGING IN THE LANE." 
How oft we talk of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play, 
Playing " hooky" from the school 
To sport the live-long day; 
And oh! how often do I 
sigh, 
For those bright days of yore— 
When Billy Brown and I 
did slide, 
Down on the cellar door. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
would give all my greenbacks, 
To see those days once more; 
When Billy Brown and I 
slid down—. 
Old Grimes' cellar door. 
Some boys would stealing apples go, 
While others used to stray, 
Down on the dock where sugar casks 
In rows together lay; 
But Bill and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us in yore; 
And side by side, together slide, 
Down the old cellar door. 
Yes, I 
would, &e. 
But at last a 
change came o'er the scene, 
When poor old Grimes he died— 
His son removed the cellar door 
On which we used to slide '•  
Our mothers they were proud of it, 
For the pantaloons we tore— 
They had to be half soled and healed, 
From sliding on the door. 
Yes, I 
would, &c. 
But since I 
arrived to manhood's age, 
The only sport for me, 
Or my ancient friend Billy Brown, 
Is to go upon a 
spree; 
Yet we never do enjoy ourselves, 
As in the days of yore, 
When careless laughing urchins we— 
Slid down the cellar door. 
Yes, I 
would, &c.

ROCK ME TO SLEEP, MOTHER.. 
Words by FLORENCE PERCT. 
1111S IC 
by ERNEST LESLTE:. 
Backward, turn backward, 0 
Time, in your flight I 
Make me a 
child again, just for -to-night ! 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart, as of yore. 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair,. 
Over my slumbers yo-_-_r 
loving watch keep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
ClioRUS. 
Clasped to your heart, in a 
loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,. 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep 
Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love, like mother-love, ever has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures, 
Faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours. 
None, like a 
mother, can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain; 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart, cte. 
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again, as of old; 
Let it drop over my forehead to-night, 
Shading my Lint eyes away from the light; 
For, with its sunny-edged shadows, once more, 
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore, 
Lovingly, softly, its triht billows sweep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep t 
Clasped to your heart, &c. 
WE PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A 
tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
would live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Oh! tell me, &e. 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride ; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
I'll love you, you, only you. 
Oh! tell me, &a

THE BIG SUN-FLOWER. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Sun-flower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my hcart is as light as the wind, that blows 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
How could she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No I 
And I 
feel, &c. 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of course she answered, yes. 
And I 
feel, &c. 
ENOCH ARDEN. 
Cheer up, Annie darling, with hopeful emotion, 
To-morrow our parting must be; 
I'll sail the seas over, I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll sail the seas over for thee; 
I'll not forget thee, oh! never, no never! 
I 
cannot forget thee, I 
know: 
Thy smile, like a 
phantom, will haunt me forever. 
And cheer me wherc'er I 
may go. 
CHORUS. 
Good-by, Annie, darling I 
I'll sail o'er the sea, 
I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll cross the wide ocean for thee. 
I 
go, Annie darling, but leave thee in sorrow; 
I 
go for thy sake far away, 
Then bid me good-bye, with a 
smile on the morrow, 
And cheer me with blessings I 
pray. 
I'll think of thee ever, and pray for thee, 
As over the waters I 
roam; 
I'll tarry not darling, and leave thee all lonely, 
Bukhasten again to my home. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, &e. 
Out, out on the ocean, away o'er the billow, 
My heart on its purpose intent, 
My brow shall find rest, when I 
seek my lone pillow, 
In knowing that thou art content. 
Cheer up, Annie, darling, break off from thy sorrow: 
'Tis sad that our parting must be: 
But give me thy smile, when I 
leave thee, to-morrow, 
To sail the seas over for thee. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, &c.

THE GIPSY'S WARNING. 
Trust him not, 0 
Gentle Lady, 
Though his voice be low and sweet, 
Heed not him who kneels before thee, 
Softly pleading at thy feet. 
Now thy life is in its morning: 
Cloud not this thy happy lot. 
Listen to the Gipsy's warning, 
Gentle Lady, trust him not. 
Lady, once there lived a 
maiden, 
Young and pure, and like thee fair: 
Yet, he wooed, he wooed, and own her, 
Thrilled her gentle heart with care. 
Then he heeded not her weeping, 
He cared not her life to save! 
Soon she perished—now she's sleeping 
In the cold and silent grave! 
Lady, turn not from me so coldly; 
For, I 
have only told the truth, 
From a 
stern and withering sorrow, 
Lady I 
would shield thy youth. 
I 
would shield thee from all danger, 
Shield thee from the Tempter's snare; 
Lady, shun the dark-eyed stranger, 
I 
have warned thee—now beware. 
Take your gold, I 
do not want it, 
Lady, I 
have prayed for this, 
For the hour that I 
might foil him, 
And rob him of expected bliss. 
Aye, I 
see thou art filled with wonder 
At my look so .fierce and wild, 
Lady in the church-yard yonder, 
Sleeps the Gipsy's only child. 
41 
DO NOT HEED HER WARNING. 
ANSWER TO THE GIPSY'S WARNING. 
Lady, do not heed her warning, 
Trust me, thou shalt find me true; 
Constant as the light of morning 
I 
will ever be to you. 
Lady, I 
will not deceive thee, 
Fill thy guileless heart with woe; 
Trust me, lady, and believe me, 
Sorrow thou shalt never know. 
Lady, every joy would perish, 
Pleasures all would wither fast, 
If no heart could love and cherish, 
In this world of storm and blast; 
E'en the stars that gleam above thee, 
Shine the brightest in the night; 
So would he who fondly loves thee, 
In the darkness, be thy light. 
Down beside the flowing river, 
Where the dark-green willow weeps, 
Where the leafy branches quiver, 
There a 
gentle maiden sleeps: 
In the morn, a 
lonely stranger 
Comes and lingers many hours, 
Lady, he's no heartless ranger, 
For, he strews her grave with flowers. 
Lady, heed thee not her warning, 
Lay thy soft white hand in mine: 
For, I 
seek no fairer laurel 
Than the constant love of thine. 
When the silver moonlight brightens, 
Thou shalt slumber on my breast, 
Tender words thy soul shall lighten, 
Lull thy spirit into rest. 
42 
THE FELLOW THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. 
In sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart is filled with woe, 
When on my griefs I 
ponder, 
What to do ? I 
do not know. 
For, cruel fate does on me frown, 
And the trouble seems to be: 
There's another fellow, in this 'ere town, 
That's just the image of me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like to catch him, 
Whoever he may be! 
Oh! wouldn't I 
give him particular fits, 
That fellow who looks like me! 
With a 
lady fair I 
started, 
To the Central Park to go, 
But was stopped, in the street, by a 
man 
Who said: Pay this bill you owe. 
In vain I 
said: I 
know you not, 
He wouldn't let me free, 
Till a 
crowd came 'round, and the bill I 
paid, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
! 
wouldn't I 
like, cte. 
The other day, while walking 
Through a 
narrow street, up town, 
I 
was seized by a 
man, in a 
rage, 
Who said: I've caught you, Mr. Brown; 
You know my daughter you have wronged. 
Though his gal I 
never did see, 
He beat me, till I 
was black and blue, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh I 
wouldn't I 
like, &c. 
One evening, I 
sat sparking 
A 
girl as dear as life, 
When a 
lady, who had just dropped in, 
Says: Brown, how is your wife ? 
In vain I 
said: I'm a 
single man, 
Though married I 
wish to be. 
They called me a 
swindler, and kicked me out, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh I 
wouldn't I 
like, &e. 
Unto a 
ball, one night, I 
went, 
And was just enjoying the sport, 
43 
'TIS HARD TO GIVE THE HAND, 
When a 
Policeman grabbed me by the arm, 
Saying: You're wanted down at Court, 
You've escaped us twice; but this 'ere time, 
I'll take care you shan't get free, 
So, I 
was arrested, dragged to jail, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, cte. 
I 
was tried next day, found guilty, too, 
And about to be taken down, 
When another Policeman then brought in 
The right Criminal—Mr. Brown. 
They set me free, and locked up him, 
Oh! he was a 
sight to see, 
The ugliest wretch that ever I 
saw, 
Was the fellow that looked like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, &c. 
• 
a, 
'TS HARD TO GIVE THE HAND. 
WHERE THE HEART CAN NEVER BE. 
Tho' I 
mingle in the throng, of the happy and the gay, 
From the mirth of dance and song, I 
would fain be far away; 
For I 
love to use no wile, and I 
can but deem it sin, 
That the brow would wear a 
smile, when the soul is sad within. 
Tho' a 
parent's stern command claims obedience from me, 
Oh, 'tis hard to give the hand, where the heart can never be. 
'Tis hard to give, &c. 
I 
have sighed and suffered long, yet have never told my grief, 
In the hope that for my wrong, time itself will find relief, 
I 
will own no rebel thought, and I 
will not wear the chain, 
That for me must still be fraught, with but misery and pain. 
In all else I 
will be bland, but in this I 
must be free, 
And 
will not give the hand, where the heart can never be. 
And will not give, &e. 
44 
NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
I, once, was foolish with my tin, but I've paid most dear, 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear, no! not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh! no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph—oh! dear, no! 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway: but ere I 
went away, 
1 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will: then let it be champagne. 
Spoken. — No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh! dear, no, not &e. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A widow only f.orty-two: go in, my boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two—well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh! dear, no, not! ct.c. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken.- -What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country! 
What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eye? What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to know: 
So, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe! 
Oh I 
dear, no, not! &e. 
THE CHA.RWEING YOUNG WIDOW 
I MET ON TIIE TRAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle; it stated: fast he was dying, 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
f.3w things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage, 
A charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing ; 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own ? 
She answered in words appearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
. 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again I 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was the charming young widow I 
met on the train, 
As the train it was stoppinp:, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry—Would I 
he so kind 
ller infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into 
The signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train without started 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror 1 
it was dead! 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note—which on reading, 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged me bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
how quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound— 
The sweet little creature rsl-ep was, she told me; 
Quite dead. asleep—so, in truth I 
found. 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain ; 
On a 
stone was inscribed—Underneath was bequeathed me 
By a 
charming young widow I 
met on the train.

LITTLE BARE-FOOT. 
Wards and Music by FRANK H OWARD. 
Sung by Miss M AGGIE M ITCHELL in the popular Drama of" Little Bare-
Foot: , 
Who has not while traversing the crowded thoroughfares 
of our different cities, been saluted, by the subject of this song, 
with the well-known appeal of: Mister: Please give me a 
penny—for, I've not got any Pa—Please, Sir, give me just one 
penny, I 
want to buy some bread for Ma. 
Standing where the bleak winds whistled 
Round her small and fragile form, 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
'Cept to jostle her aside. 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She, in tones of anguish, cried: 
Mister: Please give me a 
penny, 
For, I've not got any Pa, 
Please, sir, give me just one penny, 
I 
want io buy some bread for Ma I 
CHORUS. 
While we beg for those with plenty, 
And for them to us unknown,

'Twas down in the meadows, the violets were blowing, 
And the Spring-time grass was fresh and green; 
And the birds, by the brooklet, their sweet songs were singing, 
When I

None knew thee but to love thee, thou dear one of my heart; 
Oh! thy memory is ever fresh and green; 
Though the sweet buds may wither, and fond hearts be broken, 
Still I

Her eyes soft and tender, the viols outvieing, 
And a 
fairer form was never seen; 
With her brown silken tresses, her cheeks like the roses, 
There was none like my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but, &c. 
The bright flowers are faded, the young grass has fallen, 
And a 
dark cloud hovers o'er the scene; 
For the death-angel took her, and left me in sorrow

None knew thee but, &e. 
Oh! down in the meadows I

Where the young grass grew so fresh and green; 
But the bright golden visions of Spring-time have faded, 
With the lowers, and my darling Daisy Deane.

CHAMPAGNE CHARLIE, 
NO . 
1. 
W ords by GEORGE LEYDOURNE. 
Music by ALFRED LEE. 
I've seen a 
deal of gaiety throughout my noisy life, 
With all my grand accomplishments, I 
ne'er could get a 
wife; 
The thing I 
most excel in, is the P. R. F. G. game, 
A noise all night., in bed all day, and swimming in Cham-
pagne. 
CTIORT:S. 
For Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Good. for any game at night, my boys. 
Good for any game at night, my boys, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Good for any game at niglki, my boys, 
Who'll come and join me in a 
spree ? 
The way I 
gain'd my title, is by a 
hobby which I've got 
Of never letting others pay, however long the shot ; 
Whoever drinks at my expense, are treated all the srme, 
From Dukes and Lords, to cabmen down, I 
make them drink 
Champagne. 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, &-.
e. 
From coffee and from supper-room, from Poplar to Pall-Mall, 
The girls, on seeing me, exclaim: Oh! what a 
Cha.,,pagne 
swell. 
The notion 'tis of ey'ry one, if, it were not for my name, 
And causing so much to be drunk, they'd never make Cham-
pagne. 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, &e. 
Some Epicures like Burgundy, Hock. Claret and Moselle, 
But Moet's vintage, only, satisfies this Champagne swell. 
What matter if to bed I 
go, and head is muddled thick ? 
A bottle, in the morning, sets me right then very quick. 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, ccze. 
Perhaps you fancy what I 
say is nothing else but chaff, 
And only done, like oilier songs, to merely raise a 
laugh, 
To prove that I 
am not in jest, each man a 
bottle of Cham, 
Ill stand fizz round—yes, that I 
will and stand it like a 
lamb, 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, &c. 
CHAMPAGNE CHARLIE.—NO. 2. 
Some time ago, I 
had a 
beau, and Charlie was his name— 
A smart young fellow, fond of show, who wished my hand to 
claim; 
But frain my feet I 
spurned this swell, as I 
will now explain 
Although he loved me very well, he better loved champagne 
CIIORUS. 
Champagne Chailie, was his name, 
Champagne Chart e, was his name, 
Always kicking up a 
frightful tioise, 
Always kicking up a 
frightfUi noise. 
Champagne Charlie, was his name, 
Champagne Charlie, was his name, 
Kicking up a 
row, at night, boys, 
Always ready for a 
spree. 
One moment still he couldn't rest, he passed. whole nights and 
days, 
In drinking Madame Clicquot's best, and smoking Henry Clays, 
And then when home to bed he'd go, with wild disordered brain. 
He'd lay it to his studies, though I 
know it was champagne. 
Champagne Charlie was his name, &c. 
He promised me, of times a 
score, that he the pledge would 
take, 
But acted just like many more, and soon his word did break. 
Yes, if for one half-day complete, from drink he could. abstain, 
He'd go and resolution treat to his revered champagne. 
Champagne Charlie was his name, &c. 
He was an artist, in his way, drew herons. cranes and storks— 
Yet for all that, he passed the day in simply drawing corks. 
Though he had. a 
pallette for his paints, to use it he'd not deign, 
Because he'd, like some other saints, a 
palate for champagne! 
Champagne Charlie was his 'name, &c. 
His cash did quickly disappear, which did not well suit me— 
For, champagne's dear, had he drank beer, things different now 
would. he. 
I 
might have been his slave for life. but now 'tis all in vain, 
For, how can he require a 
wife, when wedded to champagne ? 
Champagne Charlie, was his name, &c.

'TIS BUT A LITTLE WORD. 
BALLAD. 
Composed by ARTHYR W . 
HAWTHORNE. 
'Tis but a 
little word, but, oh, 
flow sorrowful the tone, 
When losing all that life held dear, 
We say we are alone. 
When every link that bound the heart 
Has parted one by one, 
And none are by to turn the glass 
As out life's quick-sands run. • 
'Tis but a 
little word, oh ne'er 
May it be spoke by me, 
I 
only- ask for life while I 
May share my heart with thee. 
To catch thy glance, to hear thy cry, 
Till feeble be its tone, 
To watch thy latest light fade out, 
Nor then to be alone. 
The sun must set, the day decline, 
So we must fade at last, 
The strongest tree must fall before 
The storm's repeated blast. 
As pines the bird whose gentle mate, 
To other climes has flown, 
My heart would break if thou wert dead, 
, I 
could not live alone.

DIY HEART IS OVER THE SEA. 
Oh! many a 
time I 
am sad at heart, 
And I 
haven't a 
word to say; 
And I 
keep from the lasses and lads apart, 
In the meadows a-making hay, 
But 'Willie will bring inc the first wild-rose 
In my new sun-bonnet to wear; 
And Robin will wait at the keeper's gate; 
For, he follows me everywhere. 
But I 
tell them they needn't come wooing to me: 
For my heart---my heart is over the sea. 
55 
I
Repeat. 
Two summers ago, when a 
brave ship sailed 
Far away to the golden west, 
Oh! nobody knew that my heart went, too, 
For, the secret I 
ne'er confessed. 
A mother took leave of her boy that day; 
I 
could hear her sob and cry, 
As I 
followed her back to her dreary home, 
But never a 
word said I. 
But you see that they needn't come wooing to me
? 
; Repeat. 
For, my heart—my heart is over the sea. 
I 
sat by his mother, one mid-summer day, 
And she looked me through and through,' 
As she spoke of her lad who was far away: 
For she guessed that I 
loved him, too; 
She turned to me fondly, and whispered low: 
I 
was worthy her sailor-boy. 
My foolish tears they began to flow, 
Though my heart beat high for joy. 
So, you see that they needn't come wooing to me :I 
Repeat. 
For, my heart—my heart is over the sea. 
THE MERRIEST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while l'm here 1'11 do my best 
To please you with my lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me : for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with me, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
'When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &e. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, 1 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
Some mean it, I've no doubt; 
rm sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, ae. 
To balls and parties I 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And, should my partner squeeze ray hand, 
I 
know what I'm about: 
It pleases him, and don't hurt me: 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, eze.

To the war-steed adieu—to the trumpet farewell—

I'LL ASK MY MOTHER AND LET YOU KNOW. 
NEXT SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
A pretty little girl came courting me, her name was Sarah 
Broome; 
She wanted me to marry her, and thought I 
was a 
loon, 
She said: " I 
was a 
nice young man, and we might be well off 
soon." 
But I'll ask my mother and let you know next Sunday after-
noon. 
CHORUS. 
The kindness of this pretty little girl 
never can forget, 
That wanted me to marry her, but I 
cannot see that yet. 
One afternoon, Miss Sarah Broome took me out for a 
walk, 
She kissed me and caressed me, and so lovingly did talk, 
She wanted me to fly with her that night by the light of the 
moon, 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, & c. 
She made me a 
present of a 
watch and chain, likewise a 
bran 
new hat, 
For Sundays, when I 
walked with her, that I 
might cut it fat, 
But when she found I 
would not fly with her, she wanted the 
presents hack, soon, 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
Out of revenge, with one she knew, she ran away that night, 
They both came back for the watch and chain, and wanted me 
to fight; 
He said: In a 
field if he had me, that he would kill me soon! 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, Sze. 
If there's any young girl, that's here to-night, would like to be 
my wife, 
Let her step forward, and I'll do the best for her, through life; 
And if she's in a 
hurry, why, we might be married soon; 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
COTTAGE BY THE SEA. 
Childhood's days now pass before me, 
Forms and scenes of long ago; 
Like a 
dream they hover o'er me, 
Calm and bright as evening's glow; 
Days that knew no shade of sorrow, 
When my young heart, pure and free, 
Joyful hailed each coming morrow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
CHORUS. 
In the cottage by the sea, 
In the cottage by the sea, 
Joyful hailed each coining morrow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Fancy sees the rose-trees twining 
Round the old and rustic door; 
And, below, the white beach shining, 
Where I 
gathered shells, of yore ;— 
Hears my Mother's gentle warning, 
As she took me on her knee; 
And I 
feel again life's morning, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
In the cottage, ,ke 
What though years have rolled above me, 
Though 'mid fairer scenes I 
roam, 
Yet I 
ne'er shall cease to love thee, 
Childhood's dear and happy home! 
And when life's long day is closing, 
Oh! how pleasant would it be, 
On some faithful breast reposing, 
In the cottage by the sea 1

I 
travell'd about a 
bit in my time. 
And of troubles I've seen a 
few, 
But found it better, in ev'ry clime, 
To paddle my own canoe. 
My wants are small, I 
care not at all 
If my debts are paid when due; 
I 
drive away strife, in the ocean of life, 
While I

CHORUS. 
Then love your neighbor as yourself,

And never sit down, with a

But paddle your own canoe. 
I 
have no wife to bother my life,

Nor lover to prove untrue; 
But the whole day long, with a 
laugh and a

I 
paddle my own canoe. 
I

do what I 
have to do. 
I'm careless of wealth, if I've only the health 
To paddle my own canoe.

It's all very well to depend on a 
friend, 
That is: if you've proved him true ; 
But you'll find it better, by far in the end, 
To paddle your own canoe. 
To BORROW is dearer, by far, than to BUY, 
A maxim, tho' old, still true ; 
You never will sigh, if you only will try 
To paddle your own canoe 
Then love your, 
If a 
hurricane rise, in the mid-day skies, 
And the sun is lost to view, 
Move steadily by, with a 
steadfast eye, 
And paddle your own canoe. 
The daisies that grow in the bright green fields, 
Are blooming so sweet for you, 
So, never sit down, with a 
tear or a 
frown, 
But paddle your own canoe. 
Then love your, &c.

Paddle your own canoe, 
Paddle your own canoe,

There are daisies springing along the shore, 
Sweet and blooming for you,

KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN. 
Kathleen Mavourneen! the gray dawn is breaking, 
The horn of the hunter is heard on the hill, 
The lark from her light wing the bright dew is shaking, 
Kathleen Mavourneen, what slumb'ring still! 
Ah ! bast thou forgotten soon we must sever ? 
Oh ! hast thou forgotten this day I 
we must part I 
It may be for years, and it may be forever, 
Oh! why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart, 
citontTs. 
And it may be for years, and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen. 
&e. 
I 
Kathleen Mavourneen! awake from thy slumbers, 
The blue mountains glow in the sun's golden 
Ah ! where is the spell that once hung on my numbers, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night. 
Mavourneen! Mavourneen, my sad tears are falling 
To think that from Erin and thee I 
must part, 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, thou voice of my he art. 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen.

PRETTY LITTLE SARAH OR $7 A WEEK. 
My heart is like a 
pumkin, swollen big with love 
For one of the fairest girls in creation ; 
She is too good for me, though I 
am far above 
The drudgery and ill-paid of my station. 
Her father keeps a 
butcher-shop on the Harlem road; 
For this little virgin, of love I've got a 
load, 
I've spent a 
fortune on her; but of that I 
only speak 
For, what a 
fortune I 
must have on seven dollars a 
week! 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Sarah with the golden hair, 
Her beauty jealous maidens will be scorning: 
She ought to be an angel, and if only rich I 
were, 
I'd marry her so early in the morning. 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas in the pouring rain, 
I 
proffered her my arm and umbrella; 
She looked with a 
smile; I 
said I'd see her home 
She thanked me with a 
voice so low and mellow. 
When we arrived at home, she said, she'd ask me in, 
But her parents they were poor. 
Said I, poverty's no sin. 
No doubt she thought me rich, but of course I 
didn't speak— 
For, I 
was doing my heavy on seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, &c. 
She's got a 
little ankle, she's got a 
little foot, 
And pretty little fingers running taper; 
Her waist is round and small, her mouth is best of all, 
With ruby lips not twice as thick as paper; 
She's always dressed in silks, her notions they are high: 
Although her features small, her bearing's in the sky, 
When she belongs to me, of course, I 
never speak 
What lots of silks she'll get from me on seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, ttc. 
Her parents they are poor, but she's a 
milliner. 
And earns large wages in the city: 
Some she gives her mother for her keep and board, 
The rest she spends on clothes to make her pretty. 
She never saves a 
cent, though to me she says she will ; 
To pay the expense of marriage is a 
sugar-coated pill; 
And should we have a 
family—but too soon I 
must not speak, 
A 
wife and fourteen children on seven dollars a 
week! 
Pretty little Sarah, &e. 
ANNIE LISLE. 
Down where the waving willows 
'Neath the sunbeams smile; 
Shadowed o'er the murm'ring waters, 
Dwelt sweet Annie Lisle; 
Pure as the forest lily, 
Never thought of guile 
Had, its home within the bosom, 
Of loved Annie Lisle. 
CHORUS. 
Wave willows, murmur water, 
Golden sunbeam smile— 
.Earthly music cannot waken, 
Lovely Annie Lisle. 
sweet came the hallowed chiming 
Of the Sabbath bell, 
Borne on the morning breezes, 
Down the woody dell; 
On a 
bed of anguish— 
Lay dear Annie Lisle; 
Changed were the lovely features, 
Gone the happy smile. [Wave willows, &
c. 
Toll bells of Sabbath morning, 
I 
shall never more, 
Hear your sweet and holy music, 
On this earthly shore. 
Forms clad in heav'nly beauty, 
Look on me and smile; 
Waiting for the longing spirit, 
Of your Annie Lisle. 
[Wave willows, 6.7c. 
Raise me in ..-L
-017r arms. dear mother4 
Let me once more look 
On the green and waving willows, 
And the flowing brook— 
Hark, those strains of angel music, 
From the choir above: 
Dearest Mother, I 
am going. 
Truly: " God is love."

TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
I 
have wandered by the village, Tom—I've sat beneath the tree, 
Upon the school-house playing-ground, which sheltered you and 
Me; 
But none are left to greet me, Tom, and few are left to know 
That played with us upon the green, just Twenty Years Ago. 
The grass is just as green, dear Tom; bare-footed boys at play 
Are sporting just as we were then, with spirits just as gay; 
But master sleeps upon the hill, all coated o'er with snow, 
That afforded us a 
sliding-place, just Twenty Years Ago. 
The old school-house is altered some, the benches are replaced 
By new ones very like the same our pen-knives had defaced; 
But the same old bricks are in the wall, the bell swings to and. 
fro, 
The music just the same, dear Tom, 'twas Twenty Years Ago. 
The river is running just as still—the willows on its side 
Are larger than they were, dear Tom, the stream appears less 
wide; 
The grape-vine swing is ruined now, where once we played the 
beau, 
Zl.nd swung our sweet-hearts, pretty girls, just Twenty Years 
Ago. 
The spring that bubbled 'neath the hill, close by the spreading 
beech, 
Is very high—'twas once so low that we could almost reach; 
But in kneeling down to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I 
started so, 
To see how sadly I 
am changed since Twenty Years Ago. 
Down by the spring, upon an elm, you know I 
cut your name— 
Your sweet-heart i3 just beneath it, Tom—and you did mine 
the same; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark—'twas dying sure, 
but slow, 
Just as the one whose name you cut, did Twenty Years Ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, but tears come in my 
eyes; 
t 
thought of her I 
loved so well—those early brolIcn ties; 
visited the old church-yard, and took some flowers to strew 
Upon the graves of those we loved, some Twenty Years Ago. 
some are in the church-yard laid, some sleep beneath the sea; 
But few are left of our old class, excepting you and me; 
But when our time shall come, dear Tonb,and we are called to 
go, 
I 
hope they'll lay tw where we played, just Twenty Years Age.
