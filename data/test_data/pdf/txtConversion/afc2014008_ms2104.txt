Is the federal government now "the financial patron of first resort" for
 
the arts?  In Folk Arts and, I suspect, many other Endowment Programs, the
 
federal government is the financial patron of last resort, indeed, of the only
  
resort.
 
One of the three or four remaining highly skilled Haida Indian basket
 
makers of Alaska recently consented to demonstrate for a Folk Arts funded
 
film her centuries old craft.  This is the first time this craft has been
 
carefully documented; it will probably be the last.  A Haida basket is a
 
human invention as breathtakingly original, as nobly utilitarian, as creatively
 
stirring as a Greco-Roman temple, or a grand piano, or a laser-beam sculpture.
 
It is a contribution to human knowledge of the first order of excellence.
 
The private sector has had a long time to fund a film that carefully
 
depicts Haida basketry for the benefit of future generations -
-  perhaps as
 
long as 2
,000 years.  This project, however, awaited the National Endowment
 
for the Arts.
 
For another example f
rom the same section of the United States, in
 
February of 1980, the National Council on the Arts approved a grant of
 
$12,860 t
o the Chukchi Community College to help prepare ten bi-lingual radio
 
programs of Point Hope Eskimo legends and myths.  Last month, along with a
 
formal report concerning the disposition of these funds, the following letter
 
arrived from the senior Eskimo participant:
 
"I told the stories.  Tukummiq translated them.
 I did my best.  To
 
tell them, and the truth about them.
 
"I tried to please.  The papers are the proof of the work.  What is
 
in here, I did my best to tell it right.  Work about our people gets back
 
to us, and we see it.
 
"The things you have written will give you the power to show them what
 
we've done.  Three sticks can't be broken."
 
(
signed) Jimmie Killegvuk
 
Mr. Killegvuk writes not only an admirably concise and business-like
 
letter, he states a profound truth.
 In spite of the fact that, to the Eskimo,
 
these stories represent their Odyssey, their Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, and
 
parts of their Old Testament, actually broadcasting Mr. Killegvuk's versions
 
over the radio required two additional elements: a literal English translation
 
by Mr. Tukummiq, and a further translation by a brilliant young poet, Tom
 
Lowenstein, to create for Anglo ears the literary power of the original texts.
 
This is necessary because there are so few Eskimo speakers left, even among
 
Eskimos.  With those three elements in place, the sticks could not be broken,
 
stories in Eskimo could actually be broadcast over the radio.
 
It seems to me that in one sense the overall work of the Arts Endowment
  
is to help recognize the sticks that must be gathered and the pattern into
  
which they must be aligned before an artistic event of national magnitude
  
and excellence can take place.  This is the part of the job that the private
 
sector does not seem to be very interested in, strangely enough. 
The private
 
sector seems to like to follow along with the money after the Endowment has
 
made its usually very small investment and has thereby pointed the way to the
 
interesting, the exciting, the creative, the future potential.

Last week we heard that Mr. Killegvuk, a respected elder of his tribe,
 
died since sending us his letter.  One of the original three sticks is gone,
 
but its place has been taken, however partially, by the radio programs
 
themselves, now safely on tape and available for broadcast to Eskimos across
 
the top of the world.  We did our best too.  We tried to please.
 The papers
 
are the proof of the work.  Three sticks can't be broken.
 
I believe these sentences are true for the whole of the Arts Endowment.
