Introduction 
Job title Library Outreach Coordinator, employed by St. Stephen's Human Services, but 
also contracts with Hennepin County's Health and Human Services Department and 
member of their Homeless Access team; is hosted by the library; 
How Kate came to this work; had always worked in social services; studied sign 
language; while at St. Catherine's University (St. Paul) through Professor D'ann Lesch's 
course "The Global Search for Justice" volunteered with St. Stephen's Street Outreach; 
was eventually hired as an Outreach Housing Worker; 
Discussion of how outreach became part of the library; street outreach workers look for 
people on the streets, camping out, and connects them to Kate as a housing worker; 
helped people who'd been long-term homeless adjust to having a home again; worked 
with landlords; the library had many people asking librarians for resources such as how 
to get into shelter, how to get county benefits, where to go for a meal; wanted to fill the 
gap in information, started a Patrons Experiencing Homelessness Work Group; received 
funding for a full-time outreach worker in the library and hired Kate; 
Funding for position is from the Partners Fund, Hennepin County Office to End 
Homelessness, Minneapolis Downtown Council; Kate has been in this position just over 
one year; 
Description of activities; 
• weekly drop-in hours; announced via library's P.A. system and messages sent to 
all public-use computers in the library; one-on-one meetings with people 
needing help with homelessness; some need shelter, some may be living in a 
vehicle, some may wish to return to work;

• roams library and engages people; needs may be as basic as obtaining an 
identification card; 
• addresses issues/barriers that the individual identifies, but often there are other 
issues to address as well; 
• models her approach on the library's approach: offer information and 
resources, but if the individual just wants to read, don't force services on them; 
this is unlike traditional street outreach which is more intent on connecting 
people with housing; 
Clarification about alerts on public computers; 
Why people experiencing homelessness are frequent visitors; urban location, five 
shelters within two miles of library [clarification: correct number is seven: five for adults 
without children and two for families]; very few public places downtown where 
someone can be for any length of time; some people come because it's quiet and safe; 
others because they can use computers to find housing, employment; 
Discussion of other places someone can be in public; drop-in centers, community 
centers: warm places are listed in cold weather, but they're often malls, movie theaters 
requiring money, not able to be carrying bags; skyways are available if you keep moving; 
Peace House is an option, but most for most people, homelessness is not a dominant 
way they describe their lives, so they prefer not to spend a lot of time at homeless- 
specific places; the library is a more "normal", community location; 
Discussion of why people lack housing; systemic problems such as housing inequality; 
people in poverty and of color more likely to be evicted unfairly, have less access to 
legal recourse; people with felonies; story of an older lady who shoplifts for food; 
people living in crises of multiple small barriers; people released from corrections to the 
community where no one will rent to them; Kate cites Wilder Foundation Homeless 
Survey about prevalence of traumatic childhood experiences among homeless adults; 
discussion of mental illness, impact of trauma; lack of homeless prevention support; 
"survival crimes" such as trading sex for a place to stay; 
More details about making contact with people: limited drop-in hours; note that Kate 
also attends meetings and needs to stay up on resources; she is the only person in her 
role; referrals by librarians and security about people in need; story about security 
alerting her to someone in need; 
Additional activities: documents case notes and researching resources; in 2016 worked 
with about 550 individuals; about half are ongoing and the other half she sees once or 
twice; many social service or healthcare care coordinators visit library to see people but 
they don't often connect with one another, so Kate can make those connections; story 
about a woman Kate was able to locate for other providers; 
Discussion of importance of computers for people experiencing homelessness; looking 
for resources, having email correspondence; connecting on social media; 
note about Kate's office on-site; 
Discussion about new HUD-required systems, HMIS (Homeless Management 
Information System) and Coordinated Entry, and data collection; documentation and 
evaluation will help us work more systemically; the need to demonstrate importance of 
our work to others; database used by St. Stephen's Human Services is ClientTrack; Kate

also has access to Hennepin County databases to see things such as criminal history, 
benefits, some health information; discussion of five single adult shelters and different 
services provided at small or large shelters; Higher Ground of Catholic Charities, 
Salvation Army; evaluating people's need based on vulnerability to prioritize people who 
need more support; HMIS enables workers like Kate to see if someone has already had 
certain assessments, is working with someone already and so on; coordinated entry has 
been used for about six months so far; discussion of systems; 
Discussion of challenges; areas where she can't assist people (such as, rental vacancy at 
2% means less incentive for landlords to take Section 8 vouchers; vouchers will expire if 
not used in 3 months); emotional balance to prevent burnout; concerns about recent 
political changes; difficulty working with young people; story about a mom and 
domestic abuse; story about a young man getting in touch with family; boundaries; 
describes her day as a flood of interactions, complicated situations, and insufficient 
resources; 
Discussion of successes; getting someone an I.D.; story of someone who felt she was on 
a spiritual journey; getting someone to go to a hospital; getting people back into 
housing; much of her role is listening without judgment; story of connecting a man to 
adaptive technology; initially thought she'd do more case management, but her role 
doesn't have that capacity; 
Other organizations she works with: Healthcare for the Homeless, which now offers 
mental health services; Front Door, Hennepin County's phone-in assessment; definition 
of a "warm hand-off" when one provider engaged with an individual makes a 
connection with another provider while staying engaged until that relationship is 
established; Veterans Outreach [with Veterans Administration], Hennepin County's 
Homeless Access Unit; StreetWorks [coordinated by Lutheran Social Services] which 
does youth outreach; Goodwill-Easter Seals works with people on SNAP ENT 
[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Employment and Training Program] on 
finding employment; will begin to work/learn new Americans/refugee supports; Twin 
Cities Rise, Catholic Charities, many others; 
Discussion of whether a position like hers had existed in prior generations; housing crisis 
wasn't like this in the 1970s; positive developments like understanding post-traumatic 
stress disorder, stopping mental illness stigma, have changed things; discussion of 
cultural/economic biases around mental health; discussion of heroin epidemic, opioid 
prescriptions and abuse; 
Discussion of the future of her position; how we define "homelessness"; some 
communities have ended certain types of homelessness; belief in a tidal change where 
we fully end homelessness; may take generations to fix entrenched homelessness; 
Discussion of her skill set and how they would transfer to other work; expects to always 
work with people; 
Advice for people beginning her sort of work; learn target population, what services you 
can provide, how involved do you get; define what problems you can help solve because 
people will bring all kinds of problems; working with broken systems; the temptation to

want to do it all; prioritize; take time to evaluate and plan rather than go from crisis to 
crisis; story about library's new Americans center and working with colleagues to create 
effective programs; 
Discussion of how her work has changed her; prior work enabled her to see 
improvements, even slowly; this work is constant person after person; more guilt about 
her life and access to what she needs; job can be overwhelming; not usually involved 
long enough to see successes; job successes include decreased tension between 
homeless patrons and library staff; her involvement in systems change; her change in 
perspective about "hard-knocks"; the impact of becoming a mother while doing this 
work;
