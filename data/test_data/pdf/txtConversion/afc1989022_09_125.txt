DOUG \ 111 
At lunch, Louis talked about his years working for Carriage 
House foods. 
Brought in as a relative, he found it hard to win 
the respect 
of 
other employees 
initially. 
He 
described the 
processing business as a cut-throat one. 
He would ask other 
employees for help, and they would give him wrong information just 
to see him make a mistake. 
But then he started making his own 
decisions, and things started going fine. 
He also talked about his relations with the union. 
He had 
had an option to go with the union or not when the new plant was 
started, and he had decided to let the plant be a union plant. 
But he expressed disgust at the way the union representatives 
'would come in and try to make trouble.' 
His main complaint was 
that the union would try to get in the way of his negotiating 
directly with a worker. 
I asked Louis where he had learned Spanish, and he told us 
that he had picked it up from the migrant workers who had worked 
for his family. 
He described his knowledge as a great asset during 
his Carriage House years, because he had concealed his knowledge 
from the workers, and he was able to understand their overheard 
conversations. 
Louis picked up the check in spite of my attempts to do so, 
rejoining that I could pick up the check the next time. 
We said 
goodbye in the parking lot of the restaurant, and Russell and I 
made the short drive to the motel. 
By now it was around two p.m.
