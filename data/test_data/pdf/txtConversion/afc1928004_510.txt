Der mule shtood on der steamboad deck, 
For der land he wouldn't dread,

Und vacked him over der headt. 
But obstinate and braced he shtood,

A shtubborn, "shteadfast mule, 
Dhey cursed and shwore, but he vould not go

Und dough dhey dundered blow on blow,

LITTLE OLD GERMAN HOME 
ACROSS THE SEA. 
Written and composed by GEO. S. 
KNIGHT. 
Sung by THE W INNErrs. 
Copyrighted 1877 by W. R. DEHNHOFF, Washington, D. C. 
Soon I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German Home, 
In a 
new land afar off, 
A 
stranger I'll roam ; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear. 
But though fPr away, 
In mY heart ever near. 
CII0MTS. 
My old German Home, 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
I'm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German Home, 
I 
see around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since child, 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this good home once more, 
May prosperity attend you, 
As in days of yore.

THE WATER 
MILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves. 
- . 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And ,he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is Intssing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou eanst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh I 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart. take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

The Little Old House on the Rhine. 
By ALEX MCCLAFFERTY. 
Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
Sung by Gus WILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CtioRus. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, &c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
011 ! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, & c.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will nevar grind again 
With the water that has past," 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mil upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind. 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
4 
'The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
'This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic dolt& to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off inot gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest ; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
41, 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground. 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teacn your conscience thus to feet, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind arciag 
With watet that has past.

The German Home Upon the Rhine. 
Written by DAVE Rosn. 
Sung by G US W ILLIAMS. 
My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
I 
am thinking of you, and it breaks my heart ; 
I 
left you long ago when I 
was a 
leedle boy, 
I 
never thought that from you I 
would part. 
My fader used to smoke his pipe und mudder used to knit, 
Side by side dot flower- covered door ; 
But der wheel by de mill now has turned de oder way, 
Und dose happy days viii come to me no more. 
CHORUS. 
My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
Oh ! vat fond recollections you bring back to me ; 
But yen I'm old und feeble, den bring me dere to (lie, 
In my leedle German home across de sea. 
I 
remember 'en my poor old father took me on his knee, 
lie kissed me und he told me not to cry, 
Dot de place vould soon be sold, for de soldiers dey vould come, 
Und soon after dot my pafents dey did die. 
Yah vot I 
said vos true, sure de soldiers (ley did come, 
Und dey took my dear old home away from me, 
But ven I'm dead and gone, den lay me by dere side, 
In my leedle German home across the sea. 
Side by side, Scc.

DUTCH RECITATION. 
VC*len by GEORGE M URPHY, and done by him in his great ace entitled 
"

You schtand dere und laugh, und you call me a 
fool, 
Und you say dat my senses ain't right; 
You schtand dere und treat me s mean und so cool, 
While you know you are wrong, Katie Schreit. 
You know how I 
love you—don't say that I 
lie— 
Why, you even dook de ring yesterday; 
You captured und held me mit your black roguish eye, 
Go way, Katie Schreit, go away. 
You dolt me you'd wed me, und help me to share 
All de droubles und comforts through life ; 
I 
wend to my fader, und I 
thought he would snare, 
All he said, " Will she make a 
good wife ?" 
I 
dolt how good und how dearly you was, 
I 
dolt him how puty und gay, 
[Ind now you schtandklere und mock me—oh, shame 
Go way, Katie Schreit, go away. 
thought dat you meant it when you gave me your heart, 
I 
thought it, you know dat I 
dit ; 
Do you know what you're doing r 
you're breaking my 
heart, 
Und still dere dickheaded you sit. 
Well, I 
see it's no use for to speak to you brave, 
You'll regret what you've done some dark day; 
you'll shed tear after tear over Fritz Schachel's grave, 
Go way, Katie Schreit, go away. 
Go Button Your Vest. 
Words by GEORGE M URPHY, and sung by him only in the side-splitting 
comedy entitled 
Karl." 
Now if you will listen I'll sing you a 
song 
If you yust addention will pay ; 
It ain'd very shord und it ain'd very long, 
It's about schlang you hear every day. 
You've heard " Pull down your vest," " Wipe off your chin," 
Und " Go lay down " und " Give us a 
rest." 
But dc latest one out is when de little boys shout, 
" 
Say, mister, go button your vest 
CHORUS. 
Say, mister, go button your vest. 
For heaven's sake, button your vest; 
Go and bury your feet, shave de hair off your teeth, 
Und den go und button your vest. 
[REPEAT.' 
While walking along de street t'other day, 
I 
met such a 
charming young girl, 
She flirted mit me as much as to say, 
Come und speak. 
My head was in a 
whirl. 
I 
spoke, und I 
treaded to oyster und bier, 
I 
spent every cent I 
possessed , 
ask her to kiss me, when she said, oh dear, 
Then she laughed und said, Button your vest.

Do not cry, we now must die, 
For us we hope you'll pray.

Go to Sleep my Little Darling. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest ; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
Ls if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, &c. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day a 
as come again. 
Go to sleep, &c.

Farewell. 
The last tie is severed that bound me to thve, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free ; 
I 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tell, 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over. I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past ; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy— ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yore, 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my heart, 
'When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
W HEN you see a 
young couple late at night on the lake 
bank, chewing, biting, and eating each other, just let ' ern 
alone, 
They are only fooling.

A 
HUSBAND got angry with his wife and locked her up. 
At dinner time, to mortify her, he sent her a 
bone by his son. 
The little fellow knocked at the door, saying: " Mother, 
father says here is a 
bone for you to pick." " Tell him he's 
not your father, and there's a 
bone for him to pick."

A 
Cool Customer. 
A 
man entered a 
well-known restaurant the other da, and 
called for a 
dinner. 
His orders were of the most elaborate 
character, and fairly staggered the resources of _even so noted 
a 
restaurant keeper. 
He lingered long at the table, and 
finallyywound lip with a 
bottle of wine. 
Then lighting a 
cigar lie ordered, he leisurely sauntered up to the counter, 
and said to the proprietor: 
"Very fine dinner, landlord l Just charge it to me. I 
haven't got a 
cent." 
" 
But I 
don't know you," said the proprietor, indignantly. 
" 
Of course you don't. 
If you had, you Nv oul dn ' I. have let 
me had the dinner." 
" 
Pay me for the dinner, I 
say." 
"And I 
say I 
can't. 
Haven't get the blunt." 
" 
I'll see about that," said the proprietor, somewhat furious 
at the bill. 
Then he snatched a 
revolver from the drawer 
and leaped over the counter, collared the man, exclaiming, as 
he pointed it at his head : 
" 
Now see if you'll get away with that dinner without pay-
ing for it, you scoundrel." 
"What is that you hold in your hand?" said the getter-
away-with-free- dinners, drawing back. 
" 
That is a 
revolver, sir." 
"Oh, that's a 
revolver, is it. 
I 
don't care a 
pin for a 
re.: 
volver. 
I 
thought it was a 
stomach-pump." 
I DO not remember to have seen any epitaph in which a 
man's virtues are more concisely stated than that upon the 
!ate Mr. Cut Mink: 
" 
The angels to- night, hi then mansions of light, 
Are waltzing around Anthony Mink; 
He was faithful and kind as any you'll find, 
And gin was his favorite 
The Tables Turned. 
As told amid roars of laughter by D AN ComAqtrt. 
When I 
used to tend store in Baltimore, the old man came 
around one day, and says he : " Boys, the one that sells the 
most 'twixt now and Christmas, gets a vest pattern for a 
present." 
May be we didn't work for that vest pattern! I 
tell you there were some tall stories told in praise of goods 
just about that time ; but the tallest talker and the one that 
had more check than any of us, was a 
certain Jonah Squires, 
who roomed with me. 
He could take a 
dollar out of a 
man's 
pocket when the man only intended to spend a 
sixpence ; 
and the women— Lord ble3s you !— they just handed over 
their pocket books to him and let him lay out what he liked 
for them. 
One night Jonah woke me up with, " By Jove, old 
fellow, if you think that ' ere's got any cotton in it, I'll bring 
down the sheep that it was cut from, and make him swear to 
his wool ! ' Twon't wear out, neither ; wore a 
pair of pants of 
that stuff for five years, and they are as good now as when I 
first put ' em on. 
Take it at thirty cents and I'll say you don't 
owe me anything. 
Eh ! too dear? Well, call it twenty-eight 
cents. What d'ye say ? Shall I 
tear it ? All right, it's a 
bargain." 
I 
could feel Jonah's hand playing around the bed clothes for a 
minute, then rip ! tear ! went something or other, and I 
hid 
my head under the blankets, perfectly convulsed with laughter, 
and sure that Jonah had torn the best sheet from top to bot-
tom. 
When I 
awoke next morning I 
found—alas ! unkindest 
cut of all !—that the back of my night shirt was split from 
tail to collar-band. 
TONI BELL, in Dilk's bar room, fell out with Jack Hess, 
When Jack, who's a 
jovial elf, 
Anointed his brow with an axe that lay near, 
And promptly surrendered himself.

A 
GOOD FELLOW, 
A 
Humorous Recitation by En. Haaiticart. 
CHEESE pards, I'll give it out straight. 
How I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I 
was allus ripe and meller, 
I 
loved company, 'deed I 
did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller. 
Have a 
ball, no mixey pards, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
steer. 
I'm agin ' em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or In a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
There aint much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's wnen i 
was a 
good fellow, 
gother's sick, au, that's tough.. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you aint flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller. 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying, 
If you stick to being a 
good fellow, 
I've a 
few scads, aint on the borrow, 
f 
was broke, I 
struck the gang, 
They give me the old I'm sorry, 
That's charity done up in slang, 
They said that I 
was a 
good un, 
When a 
muss sprunk up I'd quell her, 
My head been as big as a 
pudden. 
It come from being a 
good fellow, 
That's all the advice I'm giving, 
You take it, I 
don't want a 
sou, 
Save money, you'll get a 
living, 
Y'mus'nt mind what they say 'bout yoti. 
What, me? I'll get long, don't worry, 
I'm bran new like a 
silk umbrella, 
walk hy a 
mil/ in a 
hurry, 
I'm done being a 
good fellow.

The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN COLLYFR. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe ; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? 
Why, she had a 
dozen—had ' em from near and fur, 
But they were _mostly farmers— none of ' ern suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome ; and tall, 
Damn him— I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He WnS the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill ; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft- tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or cifter we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, it it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

THE TURNPIKE GATE. 
As sung by REYNOLDS &: W ALLTNG. 
I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forever growing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played ' neath the Turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds me of the Turnpike crate. 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days lifive faded from our view. 
When our little hearts were filled with delight. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate, 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again ito 
more, 
When we played on the Turnpike gate. 
(Chorus.)

Petticoat Gov'ment. 
Written by J. S. 
BETBEZE. 
Dedicated to BILLY COURTWRIGHT. 
Romans, fellow-galloots, and citizens of the Third 'Ward ! 
Lend me thine auricular appendage, not that I 
charge ye as 
deaf, but that you may hear me. 
Give me—oh-oh, what are 
you giving us? 
Before I deliver my incendiary lecture, 
allow me to assure you that I 
do not advocate the blooming 
principles of the Slamnoodle Gang. I do not thrust my 
remorseless " mug" upon you for the purpose of slandering 
the fair name of wo-man ! I 
love that name. I 
wish I 
was 
a 
fascinating dark-eyed widow. 
In some instance I 
may be 
rather over- zealous than circumspect in my remarks—but 
d-o- n-t 
you- forget-it, I'm paid to do so, in U. S. lawful crisp, 
aggregating to the tune of Four Hundred dollars. 
I 
speak, 
on this memorable occasion, for the gratification of Slamnood-
lers. 
Recollect, I'm a 
susceptible tow-headed old rooster, 
married, y-o- u 
bet, and a 
father of an extensive family, but of 
healthy voracity. 
Mutual friends—martyrs of the petticoat 
government! I was feloniously kidnapped by a 
ferocious 
committee of 13 bald-headed members of the Slamnoodle 
Bamboozled Henpecked Duplex Big Boston Gang, and 
requested to so condescend, as to allow my beaming counte-
nance to shine, with eloquence, upon you. 
I 
refused to beam, 
but now, being your prisoner, apparently so, I 
see no alter-
native but to acquiesce to your dictation, and diffuse my 
opalescent luminosity. 
Fellow snoozers, solid muldhoons of the Slamnoodle B. H 
D. B. B. Gang! A5 I 
stand unblushingly sober before you in 
this ancient shanghei perforated duster, permit me to—I 
must 
venture to say, from the glacial period—before ice cream was 
discovered and patented without a 
trade-mark—Yes, time 
immemorial, the astounding questions has been propounded 
and expounded, and pounded to infinity, as to who or what is 
—woman. (Lecturer advances to foot-lights) Now, before I 
proceed further to dissect this dangerous subject, I 
solemnly 
84 
request you, gentlemen, that if you see an old pot- marked, 
one-eyed dam-sel, with brass-rimmed goggles perched on her 
arched 
proboscis, and an antediluvian " sunberrelah" 
in 
hand, and making her way towards me with hostile demon-
stration — obstruct her way ! she's my great great mother-in-
law's oldest sister, and presidentess of the notorious Grand 
Council, 9, Boston Rights and Liberty Old Maid's Association 
—organized for the purpose of prevention of cruelty to— 
hence, you all can appreciate the, my—the situation. 
Wo-o-man ! Who is she ? What in thunder do we know 
about her ? 
I'll venture to bet five copies of Secretary 
Evarts' 48 hours go-as-you-please letters addressed to John 
Bull on the fishery question, that this question embarrass you! 
It does not to me. 
I 
can explain this question, but to hazard 
such a 
gigantic matter, would absorb all my life time. 
I 
can 
thrash the air in three different back and forward ummersets, 
and claw the air by 16 double-back- action, 7 
diametrical-oppo-
site-motions, semi- rectangle, hyperbold-and-trapeziummed "on 
the fly;" also, am as long-winded, all at the same time, as 
Brother TALMAGE! 
But I'll dodge this task, and leave it to 
" 
Hurricane TAL." 
To please the Slamnoodlers I 
select one 
of my million of lectures on woman : " Petticoat Gov'ment." 
Woman, we know, is, as the vulgar hath it, of the " shemale 
tribe," 
and I muss say, 
most emphatically, 
that 
she is 
a 
most subtle, persuasive creature. 
Yes, my fellow-beings, a 
true woman is a 
daisy. 
Woman! oh-oh, woman! 
For a 
good woman I'd chew rags or undulate in a 
big sea of 
" 
Elephant Johnny's " rot-gut, paralyzing, shoot- around- the 
corner, nitric red hot whiskey, or-r-a—but where will you find 
her among you, my fellow Slamnoodlers? ' Sdeath ! Look 
t'ye! 
Catch me not I 
catch ye quick—what are you giving us? 
—taffy oa a 
wire ? Well, v-e- r-y 
well ! 
Look at woman's 
ingenuity ! Is she not the great traditional originator of hash, 
and solid shot cod- fish balls ? 
C-e-r-t-ainly ? But don't you 
forget it, she's the first in a 
gossip ; first to put a clothes- pin 
over your nose, when you snore ; first to trifle with your heart; 
35 
first to study phrenology on you, with a 
full hand; first , a 
fashion, first to hang the latest Parisian hat on her left ear; 
first to be as unreliable as a 
French clock ; first to introduce us 
to the switch ; first to give us castor— I 
solemnly appeal to 
the battle-scarred bald-headed American rooscr, that proud 
strutting, magestic bird of liberty— there I 
am again. 
I 
for-
got that I was to elucidate, with moderation, upon the 
responsibilities of our happiness. 
Well, to take another fresh 
hold of the turkey, by the nape o'the neck, I 
muss say we 
must make some exceptions, of course, we have some who are 
just as uncertain as trying to tickle—with a 
nutmeg-grater—an 
unsuspicious, but capricious, mule's hind hoof without making 
him laugh from ear to ear. 
But, let us put on the spectacles 
of inquisitiveness, and gaze back, and pierce through the cob-
webs of the period of time gone by 
There's Anna Dick, 
Kate, Mari—no insinuation as to their respective ven—youth-
ful age—Dr. Mari and other britcherloonertickS or suspender-
loonertics, it won't .do to allow them to hold the reins of 
government ! They must remain in their female sphere—wash, 
scrub, boil coffee, and expand soft-shelled doughnuts, and-a-
ain't J 
right ? Of course I 
am. 
You say that your wife proved 
to be a 
delusion and a 
snare ? 
If you my fellow-sufferers are 
situated as I 
am, I 
say, ' tis true, y- e- s, ' tis true ! I 
have been 
successfully married IS, w-e- 1- 1 
remem-m-bered, years ago. 
I 
have twent—nineteen daughters and—let me spontaneously 
arise ; 
while the tocsin or victory sounds. 
Let me not 
explode with orthodox eloquence— well, I be blowed ! I 
thought I 
was giving my Fourth of July oration, well it's 
enough to upset any one to meddle with anything pertaining 
to—even a hair pin will create a first-class riot, in two 
seconds, in the house. 
Well, love is like chicken feathers, 
stuck to a 
bar of soft soap, and—stuck again! Oh I'm bound to 
wade out to- night, and I'm going through this subject just as 
zealously as a 
bobtailed " dorg " with a 
tin pan tied to his hind 
leg flying around the corner. 
Can you tell me, why in the 
name of all that's wonderful in Mrs. Gaine's strawberry blond 
wig, don't woman get bald-headed? 
No, of course not! 
Now — gentlemen, please stop throwing peanuts at me— 
another staggerer is this. 
The daisies—sweet sixteens—sixtys, 
I 
mean, have the check of a 
1.etrified Kentucky Giant to 
regard matrimony for the future, as limited to 36 months, that 
3 
6' 
matrimony is— to educate and " paddle waxy" juvenility, the 
hope and pride of our country; study phrenology—to the very 
roots ; nocturnal debates—classic curtain lectures, of course ; 
and-a, and ultimately, divorce looming up. 
This is an astound-
ing revelation, and knocks the spots out of aspiring would-be 
Benedicts. 
Cast your eyes to the time of mother Eve .; 
she 
eat most of the apples—two quarts I 
believe—but don't she 
liquidate the debt now by giving us a 
pair ? Certainly! I 
know 
something about that, at least my—Yet, with all this, I 
think 
we are too harsh, let us be more lenient. 
Woman must have 
some recreation in life—periodically. 
What of it, 
if she 
amuses herself, once in a 
while, by tapping you over the head 
with a 
substantial and healthy frying pan, dat's her natural 
proclivity. 
Ef she at dead of night—when cock-roaches hold 
high carnival—ventures to make an inventory of your pocket-
book; or, crow-bar in hand, waits longingly for you, when you 
stagger in at two in the morning, succumb to your fate, grin 
and bear it. 
But if your wife or mother-in-law, or her sister 
and her cousins, or aunts, have the unmalleable cheek of the 
agent selling " Grants Travel Around the World on 15 cents," 
a-hum! yes, if she has the coolness to manipulate and sing 
till midnight—when the proud chanticleer croweth—yes, over 
a 
rusty, cranky, consumptive pie-an-nab, that clatters like a 
cart load of gin bottles, empty of course—with 9,999 empty oil 
cans and tin cups, running away with a yellow cock-eyed, 
blind, hairless stubby tailed-jee-whoa ! mule, d'dont stand the 
racket! Raise the yellow-fever flag on the piano! Small- pox 
flag on the chicken house! Put a 
ton of Limburger cheese in 
her Saratoga lightning-roded trunk! Put—let man be lord of 
his castle. 
Put—(commotion R. of parquet.) Gentlemen, from 
the alarming appearance of that conglomerated mass of ladies, 
to the right, I 
must say that my mother-in-law has " arriv," 
(Puts white beaver on, clutches umbrella ; on the defence.) 
and all are In secret caucus. 
I 
must postpone this lecture. 
I must place myself in ambush to save my scalp (flourish 
umbrella) Ah-h-a-a! 
" 
Before my body 
I 
throw my warlike shield. 
Lay on, Macduff, 
And 
be him who first cries, Hold, enough !" 
With a 
yell old lady leads old maids; rush to the stage, but are intercepted 
by a 
confederate, disguised as a 
drunken countryman , for a 
while 
engage in a 
dialogue; knock down and chase about parquet, and ulti-
mately to stage.

IT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED. 
COMIC STUMP SPEECH. 
BY SAUL SERTBEW. 
Fellow Iranians if. Beings. 
My discourse this evening, am in reference to the great hue 
and cry that is flying around like an auctioneer's hammer, and 
you hear the universal kicking and squealing that things ain't 
like they used to was, and the present existence should be ab-
olished. 
Eyel.yiyody x.-ants a 
new deal ; things are all wrong, the times 
rz:e upside 
the people are upside down, and eyerr.hing 
is keel up; we are drifting, drifting with that tide which is 
bound to ca-
217,T cs over the falls and drop us in the turbulent 
waters be:ew, and these that can't swim will have to walk it. 
But I 
diflOT; I 
waiver as to these Telephone Elucidations, 
and I 
stand here in absence of a 
chair, to contest and reques', 
vfiyfore this abolishment, and what are you going to do about 
it ! 
I 
will now shuffle a 
new pack of cards, give you all a 
hand 
and take One myself. 
This great hue and cry about the doubtful state of our coun-
try ,(tiiRtiv(8, hard times, bank corruptcy and cashier elope-
ments—Why should'nt it be so ? and how can it be otherwise 
For instance ; if a 
rich man owes five dollars and they won't 
let him pay it, he takes the benefit of the bankrupt act, goes 
into bankruptcy and the five dollars is abolished. 
But if a 
poor 
man sees a 
pig's head, in front of a 
butcher shop, arid his fami-
ly is starving, and lie goes in and asks the butcher for the loan 
of it, does he get it ? 
No ! 
And if be takes the pig's head on 
his own recognizance is the act abolished, does he get away 
Nv ;th the pig's head? No. 
What does he get ?—( roice behind 
" 
Six months." 
That's what maker:, 
ban: times. 
bankruptcy ac d mai:4a 
38 
elopements; they won't let the rich man pay his debts, and the 
poor man can't borrow anything. 
Again, on the other hand, it don't make any difference which 
hand; I'll shake you for the segars. 
They say people are drinking more than they ever did be-
fore, and " Murphy's" act on temperance, is drawing full luMses, 
packed " tight," standing room only, and some of them can't 
stand at that. 
Nowadays, if a man stays out late at night, to see the 
eclipse of the moon, "full moon" and he has a 
parting "smile" 
with the man in the moon, and 
comes home fully 
satis-
fied, too full for utterance and be is found dead on his own door 
step, dead drunk, then with one voice they raise the hue and 
cry; It's rum ! it's rum ! that did it, and it should be abolished. 
Now in the name of E. pinribus unum. 
If a 
man eats salt 
rattekrell for his breakfast and his tongue becomes glued to the 
ceiling of his mouth, and to way- lay his thirst, he drinks a 
bucket of water, and the salt mackrell is drownded; and the 
man dies of this hard drink, (
ice 
drinking should be abolished, 
And why for this increase of 
Because the bar tumbler's are 
water) does that follow that 
and "your water 
shut off/ 
thirst and crooked whiskey 't 
too small you can't get one 
above your nose without tipping 
it. 
Once it was "pony of 
brandy. 
Duck on the rock," now it is Rye and 1?ock; some 
take schooners, and go to beering strait. (Behring strait.) 
But 
the only way you can get ahead on these small drinks, is to join 
a 
brass band and take a 
"horn" you can "blow about." 
And again, you hear of starvation, and yet while I 
was cash-
ing a 
check in a 
bank restaurant. I 
saw a 
man come in and 
39 
order a 
five cent plate of " Hash," and while be was devouring. 
the aforesaid plate of Hash, the man's teeth came in contact 
with an over coat button, he called for a 
stomach pump and 
after pumping for an hour or two the over coat bittton was 
ejected, and the man got up and put a 
head on the waiter be-
cause it was not a 
silk umbrella. 
Now does that follow that 
the woman you board with should be arrested and Hash 
distilleries abolished. 
• 
No, my fellow students, this work of abolishment is no con-
umdrum for to be guest by every hotel or Boarding House. 
Look at the increase of crime. 
You take up a 
morning 
paper, and it is full of murders most fowl; without regard to 
spring chickens or boned turkey. There's the case of the 'Slaugh-
ter of the Inocent's," where the wretch finds a 
p:tir of twin 
kittens " Thomas and Maria," in his best Sunday Hat, and in a 
moment of passion, he seizes the poor little innocent kittens and 
drowns them in a 
tea cup. Then full of remorse for what he has 
done, he ties a 
shoe string around his neck and hangs himself out 
of a 
seven story window; the shoe string breaks, the man falls to 
the ground and escapes. 
Now does that follow because a 
man 
" 
ropes " in with a 
barkeeper, gives him " taffy" and hangs him 
up for the beer, that hanging should be abolished. 
If there's anytniug I 
like to see hanging, it's a 
woman, hang-
ing on a 
clothes line, her week's washing, or hanging on a 
man's arm, going in a 
restaurant for an oyster supper. 
One shows industry, and the other love and adoration, 
Adoration. 
Oh, how beautiful, 
to 
see a man adoring a 
woman. 
Yes I 
heard a 
man 
adori
ng 
a woman 
the other night 
tight  
next door tc me. 
lie came up stairs, knocked at the door 
.i40 
of his wife's abode with the heel of his hoot, and because she 
did'nt hear hitn„ he jerked the door frm it's hinges and to show 
his ad-door-ation flv his wife he split her over the head with 
the door and broke it in a thousand pieces. 
Now does that 
follow that the society for the prevention of kindness to mother-
in-laws should be abolished and women have no suffrage. 
'Woman's suffarage. 
Ali, there's no one knows what a 
woman suffers, she will suffer age a 
long \ 
vhile before she will 
own it. 
Yes, it's dreadful this unhappy state of " Matri-money 
and 
even our own motley, 
There's no one can tell what a 
dollar is 
worth nowadays, 
And as to matrimony now, a 
man entertain-
ing marriage, seeks for a 
wife who has'nt got a 
mind of her 
own, so she won't be forever giving him a 
piece of it. 
And then our mother-in-laws, see how they are abused, now 
when a man's wife invites her mother to come and stay a 
month or two, what does the husband (1o? Why he gets up 
the report that the neighbor next door has got the yellow- fever, 
and his wife's mother had better postpone her visit for the next 
five years. 
Then the mother smells a 
mice and comes down 
and opens a circus in the house, and (hoed voice outside.) 
Where is he, where is my son-in-law, I'll let the 
who he is, laying home drunk all day, and then 
nights preaching temperance.) 
That's the voice of my motherinlaw, and it's time I was'nt 
here. ( 'Forks fright wig.)

FRITZ VON W ONKLE, 
MCNAMARA O'D ONNELL, 
KITTY O'DONNELL. 
SCENE— Old kitchen, two chairs and table. 
Old man seated 
at table on chair. 
Low stool, Kitty sitting down on stool. 
KITTY— Oh, father, hurry rip and eat your supper, and 
don't be growling there all night. 
I 
expect company, and I 
want to wash the dishes before he comes. 
FATHER—ou do now, you don't say so. 
You expect com-
pany ? 
Ah now, look a-here, I'll have none of your carrying 
on around here, Kitty, yer divil yer. 
Whist! you young

will not swear, but—(IiNterrupted.) 
K ITTY— bit will not ! what, never swear again ? 
FATTIER — No, never in all my life ! 
KITTY—What, never? 
FATHER— Well, hardly— 
Critz enters through door R., and before he finishes the sen-
tence hits him with a 
wind bladder on the head, and chases 
hint all around the room until the old man is exhausted. 
Fritz leaves the room, and, returns shortly after with a 
big 
cow bell, and rings violently; excites the old man. 
Both 
have a 
quarrel ; and Kitty pleadingly steps between and begs 
for peace and quietness, which she obtains.) 
FRITZ—Well, 1`.1r. McNamara O'Donnell, how do you feel 
after dot fiddle exehition of Pinifivc? 
You know we don't 
have dot over here in Ireland what vas blayed in de United 
Sdates unit all de deatres.

foundry, dey all slug him right dead sure; I 
dink you know 
dot too, father. 
FATHER—What's that you called me, you auld Dutch ras-
cal of de divel ! 
Don't ever attempt to call me that again, or 
I'll kick the daylights out of you. 
Do you hear that, auld 
Fritz Van Winkle? 
Ha, ha, ye're the chip off the auld block. 
'Twas no harm to call you Fritz, you well deserve the name. 
FRITZ—Well, Mr. Mc. O'Donnell, you must oxcuse me for 
using that name. I 
speake me not much good de Irish lang-
uge, and when St. Patrick's Day comes, widout regard to 
Hick kin klux, 1 
will marry Kitty for sure. 
Ain'd dot so, 
Kitty? 
KITTY—Yes, Fritz, that is so. 
FATHER—Look here, Dutch, you see-see-see—Man over-
board! I 
swallowed the cud of tobacco, and it's resting on 
my left lung ! Hould up now, I'm all right again. You made 
a 
terrible mistake. 
You said Hick klu klux, when you should 
have stepped forward like hunchback McCarthy, and cry out : 
Widout regard to clique or clan, 
I 
am Muldoon the solid man, 
Hurrah for the Queen, God save us all. 
KITTY—Father, you will have to pardon me for keeping it 
a 
secret, you see I 
am ,
-;oing to get married to Fritz, and 
we will be happy all the days of our life. 
FATHER (coaxingly)—Will you ask the young gintleman to 
have a 
drink, Kitty, I 
am sure he needs something to 
strengthen his nerves. 
KITTY—He never drinks any strong liquor, father, so don't 
you offer him any. 
FATHER—Is 
that so, he looks pale, I 
think a 
little soothing 
syrup or some of Railway's Ready Relief would do him good; 
don't you think so, Kitty ? 
KITTY—Never mind, father; the wedding comes off to-
morrow, and Fritz will now sing his favorite song, " The 
Shamrock."

sings as follows)— 
THE SHAMROCK. 
Through Erin's Isle, 
To sport awhile, 
As Love and Valor wander'd 
With Wit, the sprite, 
Whose quiver bright, 
A 
thousand arrows squander'd: 
Where'er they pass, 
A 
triple grass 
Shoots up with dew drops streaming, 
As softly green 
As Emeralds, seen 
Through purest crystal gleamiig. 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock ! 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock. 
Says Valor, " See, 
They spring for me, 
Those leafy gems of morning !" 
Says Love, " No, no, 
For me they grow, 
My fragrant path adorning !" 
But Wit perceives 
The triple leaves, 
And cries, " Oh ! do not sever. 
A 
type that blends, 
Three godlike friends, 
Love, Valor, Wit, forever !"

and my daughter belongs to you, so now join hands, and be 
happy for the rest of yer lives ; and see here, Kitty. who' 
have you got to say about yerself? 
KITTY (sings)—

And they'll sing and dance for ye. 
whey will make yer faces smile, 
Oh, they are a 
fine odd couple, 
And with me you will agree, 
They are awful mighty clever, 
And are full of merry glee. 
FRITZ—Veil, father, I 
hope you will give us your blessing, 
and pray that we may always be able to look on the bright 
side, and when the enemy comes down on us too hard, father. 
and when you are dead and gone I 
will see th- t 
you are 
buried in a 
Jews' burying ground, for that is the last Mace the 
devil will ever go to look for an Irishman. 
(A great noise is heard outside , great excitement all around ; 
soldiers, sailors, farmers and milkmaids all come in ; the 
music plays an Irish hornpipe, and all hands take pa' 
in the dance, after which scene closes.) 
Out of Employment. 
RECITATION. 
Written by DAN SULLY for Miss DAISY REbIINGTON, and recite 1 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out of employment, starvation in view, 
Now what has a 
poor man in my place to do? 
Weary I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
The sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal ; 
Weary I 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will 
To yield to despair is womanly, I 
know ; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my thr( 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my bran ; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be doomed to such hardships while he's willing to work ? 
For months I've been wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Till my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God ! it were better, perhaps, to be dead, 
For they won't give me work, and I 
cant beg my bread , 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam, 
There's no help for the little ones starving at nome.

Recited by DAISY REMINGTON. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather, as I 
journeyed on my way ; 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid. 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rich, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch; 
Pointing to the daisies' silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered—these, she said, were gold. 
With the time departing, soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled ; 
Once again I 
wandered, with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden, vast in wealth arrayed. 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
Had been there before us and taken all our gain ; 
With his icy fingers, and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot ; 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief— 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief. 
So it is with friends, then, sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine, but leave us in the fall ; 
When a 
warm friend slights me, or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold,

O'Reilley's Billy Goat, 
A RECITATION. 
Written by SHEEHAN and AlcGtoNE. 
Respectfully dedicated 
to JOHN REILLY, 
O'Reilley owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
lie would buck almost any thing 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
he'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
And then his clothes he'd eat— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in thc c:ty pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mullig,an's underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchma._ in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
lie chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
broken heart— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried O'Reilley's goat, 
And over him raised a 
stone ; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find those words on it are wrote . 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilley's great buck goat.

BIRDIE DARLING. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT, with great succews. 
Words by V. 
J. 
ENGLE. 
Music by H. B OLIMAN. 
Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
CHORUS. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When he pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, &c. 
Let him think how once he falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me s-Ign; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sky, 
Birdie, birdie, &c.

Sweet Laughing Eyes. 
Written by 1-TARRY BURNS. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, 
Primrose and West's Minstrels. 
Air: " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Oh, I 
feel so glad, I 
-shall go mad, 
I 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
'With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget ; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains mc, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But \ 
v 1 
her love be true? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there.

Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. 
FISHER, 24 Vesey St., N. Y 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
His name was Simon Slick, - 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that mule could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
Ana greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 
micker, 
A hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Couhrever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
he'd lift you like a 
feather too, 
And stand you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
lie was just the thing to have around,. 
To tame your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
How nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Although he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
Could kick like a 
steer 
KICKING MULE. 
(Continued.) 
116 bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
lie dissected seven Chinamen, 
And inash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
CHORUS. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
His tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
he'd kick till he'd bust ye, 
He was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
57 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
He'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits) 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his thro:1' 
And kicked himself to death. 
CHORUS. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was bunkey, 
Although he was chunkey, 
No fool or no flunkey 
Played him for a 
monkey, 
Or donkey, oh, no.

Written and sung by H ENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony Pas-
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A 
man of great renown ; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch. 
As very well they know.

Never Doubt Me, Little Darling. 
Published by permission of GEO. M OLINEUX, Brooklyn. 
Never doubt me, little darling, 
When my boundless love to you I 
tell; 
Never more my heart shall wander 
From the one I 
love so well. 
Dear to me as morning dew 
To the sweet and blushing rose, 
Brighter than the radiant hue 
At the sunset's calm repose. 
CHORUS. 
Never doubt me, little one, 
For you are always dear to me, 
And my heart shall ever beat, 
Love, to your voice's melody. 
Never doubt me, little darling, 
Tho' my footsteps they may roam afar ; 
In my joy and in my sorrow, . 
Volt shall be my guiding star. 
Say that you'll be true to me, 
Tell me then that you are mine. 
Let your eyes in gladness love, 
But once again upon me shine. 
Never doubt me. & c.

courting Cards.— This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e. way as to be non-co.nmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mieht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted ny the parties to the game as th ei
r 
own, 
unless 
it 
accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary.
