Introduction. Mary Hoefferle interviewing elementary art teacher Teresa Moucha at 
Mary’s house in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on October 8, 2013. Teresa read and signed release form. 
00:00:20 
Educational Background: Teaching for 22 years, taught k-4 in Chippewa Falls, then teaching 
in Oshkosh k-5, now teaching k-5 and 7th grade. Earned a bachelors degree in k-12 from UW Eau Claire. The 
Oshkosh District offers great professional development. She finished her Masters degree and took/passed 
her National Boards. She feels like a leader because of the professional development. Works with the Fox 
Valley Literacy Project.  
00:02:18 
Typical day on the job: Arrives at 6:45. Touches base with para-professionals and kids in 
cafeteria. Check email and calendar and review lesson plans. Sets up materials/supplies: cut paper, pour 
paint, pick out brushes, cutting clay. Teach fifth grade in the morning (more independent), so she can prep a 
bit for the following class. Back-to-back schedule most days. Two days a week has a bit of prep time with 
lunch. Preparing work for an art show (labels, matting). Children arrive at 8:00, 50-minute classes.  40 
minute lunchtime changes each day. Time for her to connect to students during their lunch recess. Changes 
how much she is able to connect to them. 
00:06:50 
Travel: Commutes to a middle school every day. 10 minute drive. In the past, as little as 30 
minutes between schools. Now has time to get settled, get things set up. 
00:07:57 
Students leave at 2:43. Then she stays at the middle school until 3:15, then drives back to 
the elementary school to clean and prep. Usually, ends most days about 3:30 – 3:45. Prefers coming in early 
rather than stay late. Doesn’t bring home work during the week, but does lesson planning on the weekend, 
do emails and enter grades on the weekend at home. 
00:10:35 
Work rituals: This year is a transition year. Three best friends have retired – used to eat 
with the “lunch bunch” most days. Now, all schedules are different. Many days, she eats alone. All 
specialists feel a bit isolated. Once a month, the school has a potluck and eats together. Start the day with 
the pledge, daily inspiration/quote/meditation read over the loudspeaker.  
00:13:40 
Favorite part of the day: Has favorite classes that are very excited and love art. It is the 
highlight of their life. Love the transition for the kindergarteners. Rockstar status. Love walking from her 
room to lunch room – all the kindergarteners yell out. 
00:16:00 
Instructional tools/technology: Love the ipad classroom pack and use of the ipad with the 
document camera. Magical. Smartboard is such an amazing tool – struggle to learn how to use it and 
develop lessons with it. Try to use at least one smartboard activity per grade level per project. 
00:19:49 
Would love to have planning time with kids, and planning and collaboration time with staff. 
Balance from need to know and things we want to learn. I support the idea of year-long school. That way 
we could build in planning time. Build in time to follow our own interests rather than always being driven by 
state, national, district demands. Takes time to research and develop ideas.

Changes in education: Common Core Standards. Teacher evaluation – teacher 
effectiveness goals. It’s unclear how teachers will actually be evaluated/assessed and how it might be 
connected to pay. Merit pay. Technology initiatives and PBIS (school wide behavioral management policy). 
The norm is change. Classroom teachers need to know all the new state standards, math/literacy 
curriculum, new assessment methods. Kindergarteners have changed – across the district, they seem to be 
more aggressive, more impulsive, increased autism/Asbergers. Now have a State Fine Arts newsletter – 
helps bring people together. Need more time to connect to other art teachers and art enthusiasts. 
00:33:00 
Relationships with colleagues: This is a transition time for her. Collaboration with music 
teacher. Small group of teachers would help publicize events and coordinate the events. Now, it’s only the 
art and music teacher doing the school wide projects. Huge changes in administration, principal left, 
retirements. Good support  from current principal -- accommodates time for assemblies and programs. Her 
colleague and best friend would do collaboration and common projects during carpool. Consciously built 
relationship with custodian when she first started teaching. Custodians and secretaries are very positive and 
supportive.  
00:40:50 
Stories about practical jokes that Teresa and other teachers played on the secretaries at St. 
Patrick’s Day, Christmas, ugly sweater contests, spring break, and appreciation day. 
00:44:52 
Rituals: Christmas and spring concerts. Art classes create props for the concerts. 
Magnificent Mondays – like wear a shirt that tells a story. School spirit day. National Walk to School Day. 
Safety Dance. The teachers sing the “12 Days of Christmas.” Seasons Readings – read stories and read hot 
chocolate. Teresa acts as a guest reader. Celebrate Dr. Seuss Birthday. Fitness walks. 
00:49:05 
Parent relationships: Sometimes the parents that are artists are challenging. Sometimes 
they hog conference time – concerned about too much freedom, question curriculum choices. Teresa just 
makes sure she has research and student examples to support her curriculum. Overall, phenomenal 
parents, volunteer to hang artwork at the hospital. One parent helps with fundraisers. Parents help with 
artist residencies. 
00:52:50 
Budget issues and artist in residencies: Originally, budget for supplies was $500 base per 
school, plus $5.00 per student. Now, we have only $3.50 per student and no base, per year. It can’t be 
done, so we have a big fundraiser every other year. The cost of paper has tripled in the last 10 years. She 
asks for supply donations from families. Wrote grants for artist in residence every other year.  
00:56:56 
Stories about favorite, memorable students.
