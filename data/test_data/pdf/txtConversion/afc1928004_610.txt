WHAT I 
SAID. 
Written by A. 
P. 
KNUTT. 
Sung by binknmc LEE. 
While walking on the street one week ago to-night, 
It fell my lot to meet a 
young man so polite. 
The rain in torrents fell; then I 
was caught, you see, 
He offered his " umbrelly and kindly said to me: 
" 
I 
can really see no harm 
As the rain is pouring so, 
That you should accept my arm. 
Will you take it?" 
I 
said, " No!" 
" 
Will you take it? 
Will you take it? 
Will you take it?" 
I 
said, " No!" 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
But strolling through the rain I 
could not see the 
charm; 
He pressed his suit again; of course I 
took his arm. 
And as we walked along, chatting of that and this, 
I 
found it rather strong that he should claim a 
kiss. 
He said that he " saw no harm 
In a 
lady kiss her beau. 
And, since you are on my arm, 
Will you kiss me?" I 
said, " No!" 
Will you kiss me? Will you kiss me? 
Will you kiss me?" I 
said, " No!" 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
We've often met again, and both remember well 
That evening in the rain, beneath the same 
brell'.' 
He calls me, " Minnie, dear!" which forces me to say, 
" 
If man will persevere, he often wins tile day." 
Minds will change, as you can see, 
And I 
freely must confess 
That, when he now says to me, 
" 
Will you kiss me?" I 
say, " Yes!" 
v" Will you kiss me? Will you pet me? 
Will you squeeze me?" I 
say, " Yes!" 
it 
(Repeat last two lines)i 
Why don't I 
in a 
passion get, 
Like other people do, 
And fly around in jealous rage, 
A-feeling awful blue? 
I'll tell you why I. 
take it cool, 
And never wish to tight, 
Because the world turns around for we, 
And that'll be all right. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, that's what's the matter with me, 
PH tell you a 
story to-night, 
When my friends get angry with me, 
Oh, I 
say that'll be all right. 
A 
nice young man not far from here, 
I 
think that he loves me; 
lie wants to marry me right bad, 
But I 
think I 
will stay free; 
lie fumes and frets, and says I'm mean, 
. And calls me very light; 
I 
smile and say, my little pet, 
Oh, that'll be all right. 
Oh, that's what's the matter -with me, etc.., 
SCOTCH LASSIE JEAN. 
As sung with great success by the favorite Character Artist ani. 
Motto Vocalist, Jon 
I 
W . 
GIBBONS. 
In Scotland's fair lands of mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
A-looking at the lads and the lassies on the green, 
In that fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, she has not come out 
yet, 
The truth it seems to dawn upon me plaiu; 
/ 
They say she is false, but I 
believe her true, 
she's rly bonnie blue-eyed ScrAch Lassie Sete 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jean, my bonnie Jean, 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I 
believe her true, 
She's my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Seam. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long 
vain, 
In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep, oh, break it not, my 
Jean,. 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh, then let me not long wait, but meet 
my Jean, 
And heaven will smile upon our love, 
And when life is over we will leave this earthly , 
And our hearts will dwell in ioy and 
Oh.

MURPHY'S WOODEN WEDDING. 
As sung by-MINNIE LEE. 
I 
got a 
note the other night, 
You ought to see the heading; 
It was an invitation neat 
To Murphy's wooden wedding. 
.01 course I 
went to see the sights, 
Professionals were invited, 
And not a 
man of Murphy's clan 
Could say that he was slighted. 
CHORUS. 
'There was lots of wine and oysters fine, 
And nothing done degrading; 
The dancers, gay, all night did stay 
At Murphy's wooden wedding. 
The presents were quite numerous, 
From clothes- pins up to bedding; 
And every artist sung a 
song 
At Murphy's wooden wedding. 
Pat Rooney brought a 
hobby-horse, 
It caused quite an excitement; 
And Miner brought a 
boy to ride, 
His name it was Indictment, 
There was _lots of wine, etc. 
Ned _Harrigan and Tony Hart 
Put on the gloves with Beecher; 
And Tony Pastor made a 
prayer 
That paralyzed the preacher. 
Backus and Birch passed round the hat, 
Luke Schoolcraft thought ' twas funny, 
When Murphy and Mack they came along 
And collared all the money. 
There was lots of wine, etc. 
(Concluded.) 
Jac Aberle done a 
song-and-dance, 
Dick Parker played the fiddle; 
Tom Donaldson swung the Indian clubs, 
Fred 1.i.c ller told a 
riddle; 
McAndrews drove in with his cart, 
With his watermelons busted; 
And Niles and Evans called for beer, 
But nowhere could get trusted. 
There was lots of wine, etc. 
J. B. Donniker was there, 
Whose style is always dashing; 
He and Dave Braham done an act 
Called " Music, Wine, and Mashing;" 
John Hart and Moreland talked for booze, 
Creating quite a 
flutter; 
But Moreland's jaw was very raw, 
It laid John on a 
shutter. 
There was lots of wine, etc. 
Bob Newcomb done the giant swing 
Along with Billy Barry. 
Sanford and Wilson staggered in 
With all that they could carry; 
The wine was flowing free and fast 
The presents were presented; 
The wedding was a 
great success, 
And all went home contented. 
There was lots of wine, etc.: 
WHAT I 
KNOW. 
As gung by MINNIE LIM 
, r
I 
cave your attention—then lend me your ears, 
L., 
And listen to all I 
shall say; 
A 
Remember that I 
will sing naught but the truth 
Although it might " give you away." 
I 
feel hi a 
mood now to " tackle " the boys, 
And if you'll but give me a 
show, 
I 
faithfully promise to tell you no fibs, 
But sing about things that I 
know. 
Remember I 
promise to tell you no fibs, 
But sing about things that I 
Know. 
Now, sitting right there is a 
young married man, 
I 
know he's henpeck'd by his frau. 
Be broke loose to-night from her tight apron-strings, 
But soon must prepare for a 
row. 
For when he gets home, about two in the morn, 
His wife, with a 
broom-stick in hand, 
" 
deal with him gently, my pretty Louise," 
In a 
game that they both understand_ 
Will touch him up gently, for keeping out late, 
In a 
game that they both understand. 
Now, Just over here, this bald-headed old man, 
Yes, you with the curly mustache,. 
I'm sorry to say, I 
must give you away, 
And know you come here on the " mash." 
You've given the girls so much " taffy" of late,. 
9 
WHAT I 
KNOW.. 
(Concluded.) 
'Tis time you should take in your sign. 
Don't wink at me now not to give you away-, 
For, old fellow, I've got you down fine. 
He wink'd at me now not to give him away, 
For he knows that I've got him down fine. 
This chap over here, who has just had his beer, 
Belongs to the Temperance city club. 
Be joined it last night, and he's now getting tight, 
On the money he should spend for grub. 
Take care what you do, for my eye is on you, 
But send me a 
nice lemonade. 
I'll promise you true to say naught to the boys, 
Of the gallant " Blue Ribbon Brigade." 
I'll promise you true to say naught to the boys, 
Of the gallant " Blue Ribbon Brigade." 
That artful young dodger who seems at his ease 
While sending the smoke up in curls, 
Has a 
wonderful knack to never give back 
'What he may borrow from the girls. 
Of course he's a ' mash" always minus the cash, 
Perhaps he now owes for that coat. 
Now, don't laugh so loud, for, if we knew the truth, 
Most of you are in " the same boat." 
I 
mean what I 
say, and with truth can repeat, 
Most of you are in " the same boat."

THE WATERMTLL. 
As Recited by &us W ILLIAMS. at TONY PASTOR'S, with great 
success. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old., with a 
meaning vast— 
The tad will never grind with the water that is pass. 
"Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true; 
Golden years are fleeting by; youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last-
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till te-morrow's sun beams, upon the way, 
All that though canst call thine own lies in thy—to-day; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by; 
Oh the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word. 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, unheard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow- man, thyself consider last; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past ;...! 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And tleaveft in all its glory shines, ' midst the pure, the good, 
the true— 
Then you'll see. more clearly the proverb deep and ;Nut— 
The mill will -never trind with the water that is vait.

VIE LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Muzie published, and Copyright, 1Q79, by J. Cauacri & Co. Words 
by Wm. CARLETON'. 
Music by J. K. EMMET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland," 
Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By ey'ry nook and every brook, 
crows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green, 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil so well, 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
Oh! the shararock, etc. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc.

WHERE WAS MOSES WHEN THE LIGHT WENT 
OUT. 
Siang with great success by JOHN GILBERT. 
Musk to be had of E. H . 
HARDING 229 Bowery N. Y. 
When but r. child I 
used to go to bed at eight each night, 
The nurse girl used to frighten me when she put out the right. 
She'd talk of ghosts and goblins in a 
very awful way, 
She'd then put out the candle, and to me she used to say 
CHORUS. 
Where was Moses when the light went attt? 
Where was Moses,what was he about? 
Now my little man, tell me if you can, 
Where was Moses when the light went outi 
Now Moses being my christian name. I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Where was Moses when the light went out, etc. 
Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve, 
I 
met her in the street when she had just two days been wed, 
And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said : 
Where was Moses when the light went out, etc. 
Some twenty years passed by before I 
he-ard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
Where was Moses when the light went out, etc. 
Now when once more the light of day we saw, to her I 
said, 
As you've ' waken'd up old memories you're the girl id like 
to wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light 
Where was Moses when the light went out, etc. 
As sung by M INNIE LEE, 
When hidden by the veil of night, 
The errors of humanity, 
When fancy's freedom begs for light, 
We pierce through dense obscurity. 
With midnight's hour comes the reign 
When life's dear blessings brightbr shine, 
And music, in its sweetest strain, 
Can sing the joys of love and wine. 
For life is bright and gay 
When wine enrapts the soul, 
And love wields full control 
O'er hearts in magic sway. 
Then here's to love and wine, 
No sweeter gifts divine, 
Can mutually combine 
In play 
To drive dull care away. 
• 
When sparkling wine oterflows the glass, 
And love in bondage holds the heart, 
Life's sullen hours -fleetly pass 
Beneath the joys they both impart. 
Through love and wine our mem'ries seem 
To drive afar dull grief and care; 
While fancy builds, in happy dream, 
her fairy castles in the air. 
Dull life is bright and gay 
When wine enchants the soul, 
And love wields full control 
O'er hearts with magic sway. 
Then here's to love and wine, , 
No sweeter gifts divine, 
Can mutually combine 
In play 
To drive dull care away.

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG. 
Written for Miss Emu, H ART. 
Sung with great success, 
I 
will sing to you to-night, things that pass befOra 
my sight, 
The sad wrongs of this bad world I 
put to song, • 
These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
There's another good man who has just gone 
wrong. 
When banks do fail to pay, or cashiers run away, 
Or parsons preaching to a 
gaping throng 
Things he will not do himself, just to gain our little 
wealth, 
Why we know another good man has gone wrong. 
CHORUS. 
We daily hear complaint, of some one we thought a 
saint, 
Has turned his mind toward the sinful throng, 
Though we hear it with pain, ' tis the same thing o'er 
again, 
And we know another good man has gone wrong. 
Though Beecher does not drink, he gives each girl 
the wink,

noble rac_.;

Yes, ray love, we're growing old--
Silver threads among the gold 
In our fading locks we see ; 
But you are always young to me. 
Days may come and days may go, 
But our hearts will fondly glow; 
For the past we've no regret, 
Since the hour when first we met; 
Lay your hand in mine once more, 
Every dream of youth restore ! 
Still your words are melody; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, my love, etc. 
Down the hill of life we stray, 
Soon will come the parting day; 
O'er the river dark and lone 
We shall meet again, my love! 
Still we journey, hand-in-hand 
To the brighter, better land ; 
In your eyes my heav'n I

You are always young to me.

YOU AND I. 
W E 
sat by the river, you and I, 
un the sweet summer time long ago 
Smoothly the waters glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow ; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river as it -wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone. 
And, oh! we were saddeu'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream. 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I, 
In that sweet summer time, long ago, 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below 
I 
loDk on flip grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing s3ng, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life 
Of the river as it sing s 
and flows along; 
For, oh! how it- song brings back to me 
The shade of on- youth's golden dream; 
In the days ere we, parted you and I, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream..

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And press your lips to mine, 
While eloquent with purest love 
Your eyes upon me shine! 
You clasp me fondly to your heart; 
With joy my pulses thrill' 
But when the days of sadness come, 
Oh, will you love me still ? 
Cuonus. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
Your eyes with love-light fill, 
But when the tear- drops dim mine own, 
Oh, will you love me still ? 
My heart, responsive to your words; 
Is like some 'wakened lute, 
That, till the rapture of your touch, 
Has ever lingered mute! 
You whisper in my willing ear, 
And charm my soul at will, 
But, oh, when brighter eyes are near; 
Say, will you love me still ? 
Oh, parting hands may clasp no more, 
Though burning kisses vow 
To keep love's pure, ecstatic dream 
Forever bright as now! 
Your gentle glance, your fond caress, 
My soul with rapture fill, 
But when time fades each silken tress, 
•- 
Oh, will you love me still ?

YOU'LL MISS ME WHEN

I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray;

Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart wilt miss me, when I'm vac 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms about you, 
As I 
have often done? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But yoet'll Wks me when I'm gone.

'Twas shortly- after marriage, full of love and joy, 
I 
bought a 
baby carriage for a 
dumpling of a 
boy; 
Oh, ev'ry Sunday morning my wife ' ud fret and pout, 
Till I'd put on my 
linen suit, and wheel the baby out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along. I'd push the baby 
boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, heigh, diddle, diddle, the cat's in the fiddle; 
How are you, Mr. Mulligan? you hear the neighbors 
shout! 
The little dog laugh'd for to see such funny sport, 
I 
always was a singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
There's jealous Mister Higgins, just next door to me, 
Himself and Misses Higgins have no children, do ye 
see; 
He stands upon the doorstep, and turns his back 
about, 
He never had the luck, my boys, to wheel the baby 
out. 
CHont's. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward ; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
carriage, boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, goosey, goosey, gander, ' twas where shall I 
wander; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
It's up the stairs, and down stairs, all in the ladies' 
chamber, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
(Continued.) 
The old maiden spinster, just across the way, 
She tittivates her poodle, white, with ribbons bright 
and gay; 
While looking from her window, she said she had a 
doubt, 
Oh, if it was the proper thing to wheel the baby out. 
Cnonus. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, 
I'd push the baby carriage, boys, and sing this little 
song: 
There's/old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cup-
board; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Oh, when she got there, the cupboard it was bare, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
Now, all ye merry bachlors, when your fortune's 
made, 
Oh, get a 
wife and wagon, and go out upon parade; 
Now ornament the nation, when war it comes about, 
You've done your duty faithfully, to wheel a soldier 
out. 
ClloRus. 
Then nobly and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
carriage; boys, and sing this little song: 
There's poor Johnny Horner, that sat in the corner; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you bear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Put in his little thumb, and he pulled out a pluw, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd. wheel the baby out. 
Sung by MONROE DEMPSTER. 
I 
wandered to-day to the bill, Maggie, 
To watch the scenes below; 
The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie, 
As we used to, long ago. 
The green grove has gone from the hill, Maggie, 
Where first the daisies sprung; 
The creaking old mill is still, Maggie. 
Since you and I 
were young! 
CHORUS. 
And now we are aged and gray, Maggie, 
And the trials of life nearly done; 
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie, 
f 
When you and I 
were young! -- • 
A 
city so silent and lone, Maggie, 
Where the young and the gay and the best, 
in polished white mansions of stone, Maggie, 
Have each found a 
place of rest, 
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie, 
And join in the songs that were sung. 
For we sang as gay as they, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, etc. 
They say I 
am feeble with age, Maggie, 
My steps are less sprightly than then; 
My face is a 
well-written page, Maggie, 
But time alone was the pen! 
They say we are aged and gray, Maggie, 
As sprays by the white breakers flung; 
But to me you're fair as you were, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, etc.

If I'm any, of the many—

None completer, none is sweeter

In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how.

If you only try: 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen

Now I

She is very sly and merry 
In her rogueish way;

For her heart's divine;

Oh, she must be mine.

As sung by MURPflY & MAC*. 
It's very strange indeed in Me, 
That go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear 
About me ev'ry day; 
'Twa.s but last night upon the street 
My style the boys did mil; 
And one says " you can have 
parda, 
If you guess what it is!"

"Here it collies!" and as 1 
approached they all begar

Does it live, do you know? or is it a 
chromoi 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out? 
Oh! for heaven's sake, what is it? 
'Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
"I wonder if it's loaded, 
And if that's all its own hair." 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, 
"It's pulse is all serene," 
Approaching me, " Old Krank," says 11P. 
"I'll see that you're kept green.!" 
SPOPEN.—Yes, and when I 
say a word back, :bey 
shout: " Look out for it, it' eethin'!" and then 
again comes the conundrum— 
What is it? eta. 
They ask how long I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned?" 
And hint I'd look much better, 
If upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, 
With glove and cane and pipe, 
hear them whisper ev'rywhere,

THE WIDOW'S MESSAGE TO HER SON. 
By ELLEN FORRESTER, and recited by C. P. 
HYLA.ND. 
Remember, Dennis, all I 
bade you say, 
Tell him we're well and happy, thank the Lord; 
But of all our troubles since he went away, 
You'll mind, avick, and never say a 
word. 
Of cares and troubles sure we've had our share, 
The finest summer isn't always fair. 
Tell him the spotted heifer calved in May, 
She died, poor thing, but that you needn't mind, 
Nor how the constant rain destroyed the hay; 
But tell him God to us was ever kind, 
And when the fever spread the country o'er 
His mercy kept the sickness from our door.' 
— 
Be sure you tell him how the neighbors came 
And cut the corn and stored it in the barn; 
'Twould be as well to mention them by name--' 
Pat Murphy, Ned McCabe, and James McCarn, 
And big Tim Daily, from behind he hill; 
But say, agra, oh, say, I 
missed him still. 
They came with ready hands our toil to share, 
'Twas then I 
missed him most—my own right hand. 
I 
felt, although kind hearts were round me there, 
The kindest heart beat in a 
foreign land. 
Strong hand, brave heart, oh, severed far from me 
By many a 
weary league of shore and sea. 
(Coitel tared.) 
And tell him she was with us--he'll know who— 
_ 
Mavourneen, hasn't she the winsome eyes? 
The darkest, deepest, brightest, bonniest blue 
I 
ever saw except in summer skies; 
And such black hair, it is the blackest hair 
That ever rippled over neck so fair. 
Tell him old Pincher fretted many a 
day, 
And moped, poor dog, 'twas well he didn't die; 
Crouched by the roadside he watched the way, 
And sniffed the travelers as they passed him by; 
Hail, rain, or sunshine, sure ' twas all the same, 
He listened for the foot that never came. 
Tell him the house is lonesome-like and cold, 
The fire itself seems robbed of half its life; 
But maybe 'tis my eyes are growing old, 
And things look dim before my failing sight; 
For all that, tell him 'twas myself that spun 
The shirts you bring him, and stitched them, ever/. 
one. 
Give him my blessing morning, noon, and night, 
Tell him my prayers are offered for his good, 
That he may keep his Maker still in sight, 
And firmly stand, as his brave father stood, 
True to his name, his country, and his God, 
Faithful at home and steadfast still abroad.

Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of bygone happy days, 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would 
roam; 
No one's left to cheer me now within that good old 
home. 
Father and mother they have passed away, 
Sister and brother now lay beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain to cheer me I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave.

Come, for the day was long

Oh, nightingale, sing sweet, 
To guide him to me, waiting,

By Elosn NrwooNS. ' 
tip at Harlem every Sunday, 
Johanna keeps the parlor full; 
With the Tammany braves they tell 1216 
That they've always got a 
pull. 
Stars and stripes, and faithful George, 
Are always falling on their ear. 
Kiss me if you want to, darling, 
But not before my papa, dear. 
Squeez( me, Joe, is an invitation, 
Judgi not a 
man by the clothes he wears, 
The gar-house terriers skip tra-la-la-loo, 
In the old arm chair, with apples and pears, 
On ou; front stoop sits pretty Peggy, 
With Roger O'Malley on Dorkins' night,

I've only been down to the club to get tight. 
TILE WIND AND THE ROSE. 
By BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
The wind one day ; it a 
wild, wild way, 
Flew sportively ovei the plain; 
It carried the sheave: ,;nd toy'd with the leaves, 
Of victims in mirth it had slain. 
On, on it rushed, the ilowers they blushed, 
Like a 
maiden at rudeness afraid; 
But the wind, heeding ' lot, bore a 
rose from the spot, 
As a 
robber on a 
plunderous raid. 
The rose very meek, felt the wind kiss her cheek, 
As he tore her from flow'ry kin; 
But he quickened his speed, her cry would not heed, 
While she blushingly whispered the sin! 
Still upward they rise, the tears front their eyes, 
Fell fast to the earth as they flew; 
And so from that day, all flowers they say, 
Each morning are sprinkled with dew.

I've just been learning the lesson of life, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving; 
And all that's left of the bright, bright dream, 
With its thousand brilliant phases, 
Is a 
handful of dust in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy dais',es. 
And thus forever throughout this wide world, 
Is love a 
sorrow proving, 
There are still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the saddest of all is loving , 
The life of some is worse than death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
And far better than life with two hearts estranged;' 
Is a 
low grave starr'd with daisiaa, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And so ' tis better we lived as we did, „ 
The summer of love together-, 
And that one of us tired and lay down to rest; 
Ere the coming of winter weather, 
For the saddest of love is love grown cold, 
And ' tis one of its surest phases, 
So I 
bless my lot, tho' with breaking heart, 
For that gm:1,e 
eustared with daisies.

THE evening bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone bright on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight at hand.

How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn theatre is burning! 
Alas! burning fast to the ground.

Them that had got seats they were happy— 
Outside they were mad that were late.

For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God, let their souls rest in Heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er can, eta,

Upon such a

Or, what means this long line of hearses,

Your attention I 
ask, I 
will not keep you long, 
My subject for song is a 
new one I'm sure, 
For I'll sing about men that were true to the cork, 
Let me first sing of one whom all Ireland love; 
Who gave up his life his devotion to prove, 
He died for his country, he cared not for fame, 
And each sons of Erin rejoice at his name ; 
I 
mean not the brave Dan O'Connell of old, 
I 
mean not the brave Dan O'Connell the bolC;; 
Nor Ireland's sweet poet, the warm-hearted Moore, 
But brave Robert Emmett was true to thz core. 
And now let me sing of America's friend, 
Who gave up his life for liberty's end; 
Hand in hand with our Washington, noble hero, 
He fought ' neath cur banner, the red, white and blue ; 
From his own sunny France, from his kindred and home 
Across the broad ocean he feared not to roam, 
Let the battle field, echo the old days of yore, 
That dear Lafayette he was true to the core. 
Another name dear to us all hear to-night, 
Who loved his own comrades, who tried to do right ; 
When the fierce storms of war was overwhelming or lattd. 
To his country he offered his heart and his hand; 
Though some misconstrue him and others complain. 
They never can tarnish his honor or fame, 
Yet the red battle fields on Virginia's shore, 
Prove that Abraham Lincoln was true to the 
Let me sing now of one whom the whole world ‘ash.srat. 
Whose name is revealed upon all foreign shores; 
America's hero, Columbia's star, 
A 
statesman in peace, but a 
lion in war, 
From the red battle- fields of Lundy's Lane, 
From Princeton, from Germantown arises again, 
The echo of voices to sing evermore, 
That Washington always was true to the core.

SONG OF YE OLDEN TIMES. 
As sung by Ye Old Folks Coacert Troupe. 
As I 
look around about, 
My head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see this world so greatly changed 
Since I 
was but a 
girl. 
Old notions, out of date, 
They're all made over new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
Cumin& 
Yes, times are changad about, 
And everything goes—askew ; 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
Once on a 
time young men 
Were steady and upright, 
But now in sporting spend their times 
And in it much delight; 
They drive about fast teams, 
On the governor's money, too, 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how, 
They do it, but—they do. 
Yes, times are changed, etc 
Iowa ,/ 
ladies now are not 
Like those I 
used to know; 
When I 
was young we waited. 
Till sought after by a 
beau. 
But now things are reversed 
And going all—askew:
