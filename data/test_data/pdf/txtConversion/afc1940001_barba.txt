Barb'ry AllenIt was in the merry month of May,And the green buds were a-swelling;Young Jimmy
Grove on his death bed lay,For the love of Barb'ry Allen."Had I a man, a man, a man,A man within
my dwellingThat could write a letter with my bloodAnd carry it to Barb'ry Allen!"*Then he sent his
man to Scarlet Town,To the place where she did dwell in"Oh, come unto my master dearIf your
name be Barb'ry Allen."*Then slowly, slowly she rose up,And slowly she drew nigh him,And all she
said to him was this,"Young man, I think you're dying.""Yes, I am sick and very sick,And my heart
is at the breaking;One kiss or two from thy sweet lipsWill keep me from the dying.""Oh, mind you
not, young man," said she,"When we were in the tavern,You drank to the health of the ladies all
around,And you slighted Barb'ry Allen'"Then he turned his face unto the wall,And death was with
him dealing."Here's adieu to my friends all around,But a woe to Barb'ry Allen!" *Then slowly, slowly
she rose up,And slowly, slowly left him,And to his friends she only saidThat death of life had reft
him.**As she went slowly on her way, ***She heard the death bell tolling,And every stroke it seemed
to say,"Oh, cruel Barb'ry Allen." 2 2 of 2Barb'ry Allen"Oh, mother, mother, make my bed.Oh, make it
soft and narrow.Young Jimmy died for me today,I'll die for him tomorrow."No chain shall go about
my neck,No ring go on my finger,No fire bright, no candle light,I can no longer linger."*A great
procession from the village goes;In the church yard side by side they lay.Then out of her grave there
grew a red rose,And out of his, a green briar.*They grew and grew to the church top high,Till they
could grow no higher,And there they tied a true lovers' knotFor true lovers to admire.*
