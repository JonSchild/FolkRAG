EMILYE CROSBY: This Is Emilye Crosby on December 9, 2015, with 
Judy Richardson, and we’re in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland, outside of DC. And 
we’re here with the Civil Rights History Project, co-sponsored by the Library of 
Congress and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and 
Culture. And also with us are John Bishop and Guha Shankar. Judy, thank you so much 
for doing the interview with us. 
JUDY RICHARDSON: Thank you. 
EC: Can you start by telling us when and where you were born, and about your 
family? 
JR: Mm-hmm. I was bom on March 10, 1944, in Tarrytown, New York, 
which is about forty-five miles north of New York City. My mother, May Louise 
Richardson, initially Tucker, was first a seamstress and then a homemaker. [She got] 
Judy Richardson 
1 
married to my father, and my father was a—oh, and also, she was a jazz pianist, but I can 
get to that in a minute. Yeah. Oh, honey, played a mean jazz piano. But, my father was 
William King Richardson, and he grew up in the house that I grew up in, and that he 
married and took my mother to in Tarrytown, in the under-the-hill section—it’s called 
that—of Tarrytown, which is where all the blue-collar folks lived, right near the railroad 
tracks. 
My father had helped to organize the United Auto Workers Local in what was 
called “the plant,” which was the Fisher Body Chevrolet Plant, where my father and the 
fathers of everybody I knew worked. And you could tell time from the shifts changing at 
the plant. And I found out, only after my older sister saw one of the many documentary 
series that Blackside had done, after Eyes on the Prize, and it was on the Depression. 
And the beginning segment of that was on the beginnings of the Ford factory. That was 
the first segment. 
And she saw all of the archival material from that, and what it looked like in the 
plant. And she called me and she said, “Oh, I just saw, you know, Blackside’s—and it 
reminded me of when Daddy was organizing the Local.” And this is news to me. So, I 
said, “What?” And she said, “Yeah. Daddy was working in the plant, and,” she said, 
“There were times when he had decided he wanted to organize a union, and the UAW 
Local there. And so,” she said, “What I—.” What she, my sister, remembered was that 
when the guy from the National—he was a white guy—and so, he would come up and sit 
in my kitchen, talking to my father. 
And what my sister said was that my mother would immediately close the 
curtains. Because we were ground level. We had a little, teeny-tiny little house, right on 
Judy Richardson 
2 
the ground there. And she said she would immediately close the curtains so that nobody 
could see that my father was talking to somebody from the Local—from the National. 
Because she was afraid, of course, with good reason, that he might lose his job. 
EC: Do you have a sense of the timing of this? 
JR: Not really. I mean, I have no memory of it. And so, it would have had to 
be when he—so, he dies on the assembly line when Em seven years. He dies of a heart 
attack. And so, that would have been probably [19]53—four and seven is eleven—[19]51. 
Fifty-one. So, I was seven years old then. He—. 
Oh, and the other thing she remembers about this is that sometimes, people would 
leave bags of groceries on our porch, because they would be too afraid to overtly say they 
were supporting the Local, and the building of the organizing of the Local. But the way 
they did that was to then give my family some groceries, you know? And so, my sister, 
Carita, said, you know, you would come outside, and you would find these bags of 
groceries on the porch. And the result was that, as one of the white guys in Tarrytown 
mentioned to me, when we were protesting segregated housing, “Why are you doing 
this?” He said. “We loved Billy,” my father. Which they did. They loved Billy. 
Now, they wouldn’t allow him inside— [laughing] some other stuff, but they loved 
Billy, because he had—you know, he was treasurer of that Local when he died of a heart 
attack on the line in [19]51. So, yeah, there’s all of that. 
EC: So, your dad’s helping to organize a union that’s mostly white? I mean, is 
he one of the few—? 
JR: No, there were—no. 
EC: No? 
Judy Richardson 
3 
JR: No, because Tarrytown had a—I would say about a ten percent black 
population. And like all of the white ethnics on our block—because my block—there was 
the projects down the road. And that was just about all black. And then on our block, 
[5:00] which again, was under the hill, so we—nobody had any money. But they were all 
working-class—my family, and then the working-class white people on the block; Italians, 
Polish, and Irish. 
And so, in addition, though—and I should mention, by the way, that Tarrytown 
was steeped in tradition. So, I went to Washington Irving Junior High School. This was 
Washington Irving territory. Washington Irving Junior High School. Sleepy Hollow 
High School. [Laughter] Yes. Our mascot was the Headless Horseman. A horseman 
[goat?]. It was all of that. I mean, we had—but I didn’t see any middle-class—certainly 
no middle-class black people, but no middle-class white people, either. Because it hadn’t 
become that kind of suburban thing. There were white people who lived in Sleepy 
Hollow Manor, and Tappan Zee Manor— something like that. But most of the people I 
knew, and certainly all my friends, were white kids. Some black kids, but mainly white 
kids, whose parents—whose father worked in the plant. The black people I knew, their 
mothers, mainly—their fathers worked in the plant, too. And their mothers oftentimes 
worked out. So, they were domestic workers. 
EC: Well, I would just assume, when people were saying to you, “We love 
Billy. Why are you doing this,” kind of thing, that’s because you’re protesting 
segregation, you mean? 
JR: Segregated housing. 
EC: Segregated housing? 
Judy Richardson

JR: But also, on my block—at the end of my block, was a fire department. 
And it was all volunteers. I mean, it’s Tarrytown, it’s—you know. And so, they had no— 
none of the fire departments had any black people. So, when I come back from SNCC, 
that first summer, which would have been sixty—I guess the summer of [19]64, 
somewhere in there—not only have we already started a Tarrytowners for Civil Rights, 
but also with this wonderful black couple. Oh, golly—who was a doctor—oh, I may or 
may not remember her name. She and her husband—both black—she was the doctor. And 
he was an architect. And they moved on Broadway. And that was major. I mean, when 
I went back to speak at Marymount College in Tarrytown, they came, as did a number of 
former folks from Tarrytowners for Civil Rights. And I went up to her husband, and I 
said, “Oh, my gosh, you were the first black couple to actually make it to Broadway.” 
And he said, “All the black people told us that.” [Laughter] So, that was great. Yeah. 
So, we’re doing stuff around residential, but it’s also specific to that fire 
department. Now, when we pull a picket line—it’s on the end of my block. Right? One- 
thirty-three Franklin Street was my town, right? It was my address. At the end of that 
block, we had a picket line. And it was at a corner where all the commuters—because 
there were commuters. I just didn’t know any of them, because they were white and 
middle class. But they would come through that when they got off the train. Because 
we’re right across from the train, right? So, they would see the picket line. And we had 
thrown it up, because—you know, they blackballed. And they said that. “We 
blackballed—.” And I remember one guy coming—oh, what? 
EC: What does that mean for—if some people don’t know what blackballed—? 
Judy Richardson 
5 
JR: Yes, good point. “Blackballed,” and during certain times when we were 
trying to rearrange the language, we started calling it “whiteballed.” But blackballed 
meant that you did not—one blackball. It was kind of like you would put—well, I guess in 
terms of the fire department, it meant that, if there was any nay vote on a proposed person 
who would be invited in, to be part of this volunteer fire department, then somebody 
would either put a black ball, or put a black piece of paper—something to indicate “nay.” 
But the ball, it was—oftentimes, I guess how it started, was that it would be a ball. It 
would be a little black ball that would mean that was a “no” vote. 
EC: And they did that automatically with any black applicant? 
JR: Yes. And what they reminded me of—and this was while I’m on the picket 
line. They reminded me that, first of all, “Yes, we loved Billy.” But also, that when our 
house caught fire Thanksgiving Day, and we had gone out of town to my father’s family 
in Yonkers, nearby. [We] came back, and found smoldering. I mean, they had—it was 
just—. And one of them said—my mother reminded me of this—she said that one of the 
firemen, who loved Billy, said, “I stopped one of the other firemen from using a hatchet 
on the door, because I said, ‘No, this is Billy’s house.’“ And I’m sure he did that. 
Because that was separate. You know? 
So yeah, it was smoldering. [10:00] I remember we all were in there. It was cold, 
because we couldn’t put any heat on. But eventually, it got back to whatever. It didn’t 
burn down, it just was very smoldering, and we couldn’t have any heat, and it was 
Thanksgiving, and cold, and stuff. 
So anyway. There were fond memories of my father. And we also picketed— 
again, after I come back from that first stint at SNCC, so I’m taking a break. We’re 
Judy Richardson 
6 
fundraising for SNCC. And it must have been—I can’t remember if it was before or after 
the [19]64 summer project in Mississippi. But certainly, we’re doing some kind of 
fundraising. And so, I bring Stokely, the Freedom Singers—so Bernice, and Chuck, and 
Rutha—and I don’t know who the other—who was the other—? In that original group. It 
wasn’t Matthew. Who was the other guy? Oh, and Cordell! Yeah, Cordell. Hello! 
[Laughs] So, yeah. 
So, they come up, and they—so, Stokely Speaks—now, this is before Black Power, 
so it’s [19]64. Stokely speaks, the SNCC Freedom Singers sing. And it’s in Patriots’ 
Park, in front of the library. There was a woman, Mrs. Kenney, who was as right-wing as 
you could get her. And so, she protested about how, “In Patriot’s Park, there were these 
communists, you know, singing these songs. And we all know they were communists.” 
She had written a letter saying that SNCC was a communist—well, basically, what did 
they used to call them? Not supporters. 
EC: Sympathizers? 
JR: Sympathizer, yeah. And so, she put this in the Tarrytown Daily News. 
Now, my mother wrote—I mean, she had a beautiful handwriting. I mean, it was 
gorgeous. My mother had, like, an eighth-grade education, right? She read everything. 
Every Sunday, it was Meet the Press on the television. It was—, I remember her—she had 
stacks of the New York Post, which then was a real newspaper, right? And she would 
love Murray Kempton’s articles, because he was a little left of cent—he was a liberal, 
basically. And so, she had all of these stacks in her bedroom. And she would write back 
to Mrs. Kenney in the Tarrytown Daily News, and say, “No, I—you know, da-da-da-da.” 
And very rational. Mrs. Kenney at one point said something about—which I had to 
Judy Richardson 
7 
respond to—but had said something about, “We know that they are communist 
sympathizers because it was read into the congressional record.” And it’s like, you could 
read the phone book into the congressional record. But she didn’t know any better. 
So, there was always that kind of—like the Tea Party now. But my mother would 
respond. And then, I have letters from her, where she’s saying that I shouldn’t—I should 
be careful, and not be around people because I’m going to be—I’m going to get a cold. 
And she said, “Stay away from anybody who’s sneezing, because—” I’ve just realized 
that’s part of what—oh, got lost at that Duke interview. Gosh. Anyway, but I have the 
original letter from her, where she talks about staying away from anybody who has a cold 
and is sneezing. And then she says—now, of course, this is—I’m in Mississippi. And it’s 
1964, and she’s talking about worry about the people who are sneezing because they may 
give you a cold, right? 
EC: She’s really thinking about—. 
JR: Well, then her next line is something about, “I’ve got to get to bed now. I 
haven’t been sleeping well.” And it was only after I got grown and looked at this letter— 
not back then—that I realized, she’s not sleeping because she’s worried sick about me. 
But she’s not saying any of that in the letter. And she says in the letter, something about, 
in key to my sister, Carita, “It’s cooking—[she] can’t do Thanksgiving dinner, because 
she’s organizing parties.” 
Now, the parties were that I had brought my sister in, and my sister was now 
organizing the Harry Belafonte parties in [19]64 on Long Island, out of the SNCC 
fundraising office in New York City. And so, my sister—who could really cook, unlike 
my mother—excuse me. My sister could cook. And so, she was going to—usually, could 
Judy Richardson 
8 
do the turkey, but no, she’s doing the Belafonte concerts. So [laughter], yeah. 
[Discussion with tech crew] 
EC: So, I want to go back just a little. I took you on a side tour—. 
JR: Sorry, no, I go off, yes. 
EC: —with—. So, you found out later from your sister that your father was an 
organizer. 
JR: Yes. 
EC: And he died on the line when you were seven? 
JR: Mm-hmm. 
EC : And what was your mother doing? 
JR: Yes, good point. So, my mother—at some point, my mother—well, my 
mother could play piano. I mean, she could hear something, [15:00] and could just do 
chords. And so, she had written music. She certainly read scores, and stuff, but sheet 
music. And she loved Porgy and Bess. She had all that sheet music in the [piano] bench. 
But, in addition, she could play all kinds of things. And she loved, you know, Oscar 
Peterson, and she just loved lots of people. So—mm-mm. Not Oscar Peterson. Art 
Tatum. She loved Art Tatum. 
So, for her own amusement, she is doing this. But before I’m bom—I think before 
I’m bom, she was the pianist in a little jazz combo in Westchester County, which is 
where Tarrytown was. And so, she was going around playing as the pianist with this 
Teddy Whiteley Orchestra, until my father stopped it. [Laughs] I guess he didn’t want 
his wife going off when he was not there, on-site, you know, and off to these little clubs 
and stuff. So—. 
Judy Richardson 
9 
EC : And you know j azz, I mean—. 
JR: You got it. A little free, yes. Although my mother was so prim. But 
anyway, [laughter]. So, in any event, she’s not doing that, but she still always played. I 
always remember my mother playing, to the point that when I come back from—oh, and I 
got to tell you about the numbers, because she also booked the numbers. But when I 
come back from—[19]64, from Mississippi, she’s sitting in our little living room, on the 
bench in front of the piano. And it was a Lester, little small piano. And she said, “Come 
here, come here, come here!” And I go over, and I sit next to her on the bench. And she 
started playing “We Shall Overcome,” with these blue chords. I still remember it. It’s 
like—it brought tears to me. It was like, “Oh, my little mommy.” You know, something 
like that. It was so cute. [Laughter] It was so cute. And they were so gorgeous. I mean, 
I had never heard “We Shall Overcome” that way. It was just gorgeous. And she had 
heard it. It wasn’t like she was reading sheet music. She just heard the chords. 
Also, though, what my mother did was that she booked numbers. So, since she 
wasn’t playing in the orchestra anymore. And she booked numbers including—well, for 
everybody. Now, I’m in an ethnic neighborhood, right? And the mayor is Italian, Mayor 
Vetrano. Well, his mother used to come down from up the hill, and she would come 
down, and she would book the numbers—not every day. Some people did it every day. 
But she booked it every so often. And then, walked back up the hill, and stuff. And a lot 
of the people booked numbers with my mother. Or, my father also booked it, at the plant. 
And then, Trippy, who was this tall, white guy—Trippy was the runner. So, he would 
bring in the slips. He would take the money. And I think people felt comfortable doing it 
with my mother, because she was honest as hell. As was my father. 
Judy Richardson 
10 
Now, my sister told me that my father once got arrested and had the numbers slips 
on him. And my sister said she was so embarrassed, because it was in the Tarrytown 
Daily News. [Laughter] Yes. And now, what was funny about that was, everybody 
booked with my father. So, somebody must have wanted something—somebody didn’t 
get a payoff, something. Because it was the Italian folk, the Irish folk, the—Italians, Irish, 
Polish folks. Everybody booked with my father. Youknow, so—. 
EC: And this is gambling? 
JR: Oh, Em sorry. Now, the numbers—I just found out recently that it was 
otherwise known as the—what did they used to—? The Italian lottery. [Laughter] So, if 
you look it up—and some people suggest that it came in through the Italian immigrants 
who first come in. So, it is otherwise known as that. But the numbers were based—the 
ones I knew—were based on the race, and certain races that were being played that day. 
And so, it was a three-digit number. You could combínate it. You could do, you know, 
four-five-three, three-five-four, however. And it was called boxing it. And it was simple 
enough so that people could understand it, but I didn’t quite get all of the stuff around it. 
I just knew it was based on that day’s race. Didn’t know how— which in that day’s race. 
And people would then come to collect, if they won the numbers. 
And then, you know, my mother would get a cut off [of] whatever, particularly if 
somebody won who had bet with her. And then people would tip you, and all of this 
stuff. One time, my mother bet. And I always remember this, because she told me this 
story. She said she won. And she then called my Aunt Helen, her sister, who lived in the 
Bronx. They were close. I mean, they were so close that every day, I would call my 
Aunt Helen—Olinville [20:00] four, four-nine-eight-six. I would call her every night, 
Judy Richardson 
11 
because my mother would say, “Call Helen.” And I’d go, “Okay.” Close, close. My 
mother wins. And she then calls my Aunt Helen, and says, “Helen, get ready. I’m going 
to pick you up. We’re going to go buy some fur coats.” [Laughter] So, she and my 
mother got these fur coats from whatever my mother had played and won. So, yeah. 
[Break in audio; discussion with tech crew] 
EC: What kind of work did your mother do, after your father died? 
JR: Well, it was great, first of all. When my father died—[interruption] after 
he died, what was great about the unions, of course, is that there were pensions for the 
family. So, my mother has a modicum of—a small amount, but she also knows she has to 
work. 
Oh, as a matter of fact, let me tell you what she does with that small amount of 
money. Because she realized she needed a car. And so, she was going to buy a car, and 
pay for it over time. The only—one of the two times that I have ever seen my mother talk 
about race was this time, when she goes to buy a car. It was going to be a Valiant. She 
buys this—she goes, and comes back, and she is huffing mad, because the man is 
obviously—the white salesman has obviously disrespected her, and suggested that she 
does not have the money to buy this. She comes back. She takes all of the money out— 
for not just a down payment, but to pay for the car outright, and gives it to the man. 
So, that—it was an inroad in whatever might have been there. But that money was 
there because—you know, they didn’t spend much money on stuff. But also, because 
there was a UAW pension that just went to her. However, that wasn’t enough. And so, 
she then gets a job—. 
Judy Richardson 
12 
Oh, well, first of all, she goes for—you had to get on a list. So, you had to take an 
exam. Now, my mother was very smart. She had an eighth-grade education, but she was 
really smart, and corrected my grammar. Because I mean, I would say, “Well, he went 
with Henry and me.” She said—no, “With Henry and I.” She said, “Me. Henry and me.” 
She always—it’s a preposition. She knew the parts of the—it was all of that. Even now, I 
correct my grammar based on my mother standing over my shoulder, right? 
So, she knew all this stuff, but she kept getting low marks, and you had to be in 
the top whatever number, to be considered for a County job. She goes to Mr. Slaven, 
who ran the drug store, and says to Mr. Slaven, “You know, I can’t seem to get hired.” 
She said, “It seems to me that I’m coming up at the top of the exam, but nobody’s calling 
me for work.” He says—Mr. Slaven says, “How are you registered?” And she says, 
“Democrat.” [He says], “Mm-mm. You’ve got to change your registration. Be a 
Republican.” And she does. And—I always remember this—immediately, she gets called. 
She goes. And so, then she becomes a County worker as a secretary at the County office 
building in White Plains. So, she’s doing that every day. 
EC: You said one of only two times your mother talked about race? 
JR: Oh, good pick-up, yes. Which I would not have remembered, so thank 
you. The other time was when she mentioned going to see Birth of a Nation in whatever 
that would have been—1915, or something, during President Wilson’s presidency. And 
she said that she went—and for those who don’t know, Birth of a Nation was based on the 
book—should I go through all that? Or—? 
EC: You can do a quick—. 
Judy Richardson 
13 
JR: Okay. [It was] based on a book written by a Klansman. And it valorized 
the Klan, and just said, basically, they were the protectors of white womanhood, after 
reconstruction, and that’s the reason the white people were safe in the South. And they 
absolutely make horrible—they make the—it’s the whole coon thing, and ignorant, and 
rapists, as the former enslaved people. But what film courses do with this film is that 
they teach it for the technique, because it was a new technique. And sometimes they 
don’t even mention how racist it was. Okay, so I’ve gone to film departments and—Okay, 
so I know about this. 
But what she remembered was that she had gone with a friend of hers. And she 
said she saw the way that black people were portrayed. And by the way, I should 
mention that—well, I’m sorry. The way they were portrayed—and she said, “I couldn’t 
even lift my head.” She said, “We came out of that theater, and all I could do was look 
down at the pavement, I was so ashamed.” Never talked about the larger issue of racism, 
or any of that. Just, “That was the incident. That’s what I learned.” 
[25:00] Now, I later find out, when we’re doing Eyes on the Prize, and I mention 
to John Dittmer, I said, “I saw this—when I was the only black person in my AP history 
course—.” at Sleepy Hollow High School, right? And I loved the course. But we were 
doing something on Reconstruction. And I said, “The only—.” Of course it was just a 
short piece on Reconstruction. But it was so negatively portrayed. And in fact, the only 
illustration was the one that came from Birth of a Nation. Which I find out, but I didn’t 
know what that was. I just knew it was an illustration, and it showed what was supposed 
to be a white scallywag, and they were—the black guy was disheveled, and he had his feet 
on the desk of what was supposed to be the state legislature during Reconstruction. And 
Judy Richardson 
14 
you see the white guy, who’s come down from the North, and he looks horrible. And the 
whole framing of it was as a really negative thing. So, you didn’t get anything about 
South Carolina, first time you get free public education for poor whites as well as black 
people. It’s all that. 
So, I mention to—it’s Kyes on the Prize school; it’s say, Eyes one would have been 
somewhere around mid-[19]80s. And one of our advisors was John Dittmer, who does 
local people, but hadn’t done it yet. And so, I say to John, “You know, John, I remember 
this book. And it had this illustration in it of what was supposed to be Black 
Reconstruction.” And I said, “When we looked at it, and you saw that horrible 
caricature, all I remember is the white kids in my class kind of looking back at me, kind 
of trying not to look, but always looking back. And I felt really ashamed. I mean, as my 
mother had with the same—. 
EC: Imagery. 
JR: Same imagery. That’s it. So, I say—and the thing is, what they were 
denied was the same thing I was denied, which was the reality of what Black 
Reconstruction really was. And the sense that I got coming out of that, which was, this is 
what happens when black people are put into any positon of authority or control. So, I 
get that message, all my white classmates get that, and that’s—so I asked John—John 
Dittmer, “What—? Am I remembering this?” And he said, “Oh, yeah. That was—.” And 
he remembered the authors. And he said, “That was a nationally prescribed textbook, at 
the time.” So, other people are getting this. [Laughter] So, anyway. 
I can’t remember how I started out. Oh, because that’s the other part of that, was 
that imagery. 
Judy Richardson 
15 
EC: ( ) 
JR: So, it’s never just a film. People will tell me, “Why are you getting so 
upset?” Like with Mississippi Burning. “Why are you getting so upset? It’s just a film.” 
It’s never just a film. [Laughter] 
EC: So, you’ve covered a lot of different things about growing up. But I 
remember talking once, and you telling me you wrote a Letter to the Editor about the 
Little Rock de-segregation? 
JR: Yes, I did! I forgot that. Yes! Okay, so I’m in high school. So, 
somewhere between tenth grade and twelfth grade. So, wait—[19]57. Okay, so fifty- 
seven, forty-four—what is that, thirteen? ( ) [something weird?]. Okay. And I 
remember writing a letter, which was to tell the Tarrytown Daily News, “I don’t know 
why these students in Little Rock are trying to get into this white school. They are better 
off just pursuing their education however they want, because it’s really about education, 
and we will progress through that” [Laughter] Oh, how far we’ve come. 
EC: You who are de-segregating your school in Tarrytown, right? 
JR: Yes, exactly. [Laughs] That’s right. Exactly. That’s right. 
EC: Interesting. 
JR: Yup. Mm-hmm. So, it was—I mean, until I get to SNCC—. 
EC: Do you know where you’re getting that attitude from? 
JR: It could have been my mother. You know, it could have been. But I 
should not blame my mother for this. It could have been other folks in the school. I 
mean, since that’s what I got when I’m at Swarthmore, a good Quaker college, when we 
are doing the de-segregating. And good Quaker children are saying to us, “You’d be 
Judy Richardson 
16 
better off not doing any demonstrating, but staying on campus, and just pursuing your 
education.” As one of the students said to somebody else, “They would be better doing 
that, because they’ll be—,” oh, no. How did he put it? “Because they will be able to 
contribute more to their race.” [Laughs] That was the thing. Yes. So, I mean, that was 
the general line of thinking of most people—most white people. And some black people, 
too. But most white people. So, I can see that I would have incorporated that, given that 
I’m sitting there—yeah. 
EC: Do you ever want to look him up, and compare how much you’ve 
contributed and he’s contributed? 
JR: Oh, that one? No. [30:00] [Laughter] No. Forget him. [Laughter] 
Exactly. 
EC: So, let’s jump ahead, and you just mentioned you go to college at 
Swarthmore? 
JR: So, how do you end up at Swarthmore, and what’s it like? 
EC: Yes. I was one of eight black students, who come into Swarthmore that 
year. So, that was [19]62. Now, I was in the top three. I mean, there were three of us 
who were in the top, as we graduated. It had small graduating class. And I applied to 
Bennington, where my sister had gone. Bryn Mawr, I think Antioch, and Swarthmore. 
And Bennington, actually—because my sister had not done that well at Bennington. And 
so, Bennington says, “Well, we will admit you, but we’re not going to give you the 
money that we understand Swarthmore is giving.” And that, “We understand they really 
are going to be doing—.” However, they said this in their letter. 
EC: So, they’re colluding? 
Judy Richardson 
17 
JR: You got it. And then I get the Swarthmore letter. And the Swarthmore 
letter says full freight for four years. Now, my mother obviously had no money. So, I’m 
thinking, “Oh, okay. I guess I’ll do Swarthmore.” So, I come in as one of eight. Four 
boys—four black kids. This is all incoming freshman class. Four black men, four black 
women. I assumed it was so that we would not have to date outside our little group. All 
eight of us—. 
EC: Did you immediately pair up? 
JR: Oh, yeah, immediately. Yeah., of course. [Laughter] But the main thing 
was, we were all housed with Quaker children. The assumption being, I think, that the 
Quaker children would be more accepting of us, right? 
So, I got Meg—I can’t remember Meg’s last name. Let me just say, that was not 
automatically true, once we started doing demonstrations. But when we come in, it’s 
eight, and it’s four and four, and when I come in, there may be two other black students 
there. One was a senior, and one was a sophomore, to my remembrance. At least my 
memory, that’s what I’ve got. 
Somebody, when I said this—we had an all-day meeting, when we did our Hands 
on the Freedom Plow all day at Swarthmore. And I think the president, or somebody 
may have said they thought there was a third, and that that was an African student. But 
I’m not sure, because I’ve never checked the records. 
So, we come in. And I had been—I mean, as senior year always is. You know, 
you’ve been sliding through. I come into Swarthmore, and it’s like, oh my God. And not 
only is it academically really pressurized, but it’s also that most of these kids have come 
out of, you know, Sidwell Friends. I mean, Quaker schools; come out of private schools, 
Judy Richardson 
18 
which now are called independent schools. I’m coming from a good public high school. 
But they’ve also come from families where they wintered in Paris, you know? And I had 
been to Albany. [Laughs] That was—. 
EC: New York. 
JR: New York! New York, excuse me. Albany, New York. And that was my 
one and only plane ride before this. And that was only because I was part of the All-State 
Youth Orchestra, which went to—or was that Buffalo? We went to Buffalo. Sorry, 
Buffalo. 
So, these were worldly young kids. Which was why I was so amazed when we 
did the demonstrations, and they turned against us, but—some of them. Not all of them. 
So anyway, I come in, and I’m, as usual, very good in English. But it’s like, even 
poli-sci, which was an eight a.m. on a Saturday course, [laughter] with a professor who 
was phoning it in. I’m not a morning person. Eight a.m. on a Saturday, and it’s like he’s 
reading from his notes. Please. But it was in that poli-sci class that I got to respect this 
one young guy, who knew about Lenin, and Trotsky, and all this stuff that I had never 
heard of before, right? He’s the one who says—I overhear him saying, once we do the 
demonstrations, “They’d be better off sticking to education.” 
EC: Oh, really? 
JR: Oh, yeah. 
EC: Your little theorist. 
JR: Yeah, my little theorist. Who I just thought was so amazing, because he 
knew all this stuff, right? Yes, “Because they will be a better credit—they will be able to 
do more for their race.” Yes. 
Judy Richardson 
19 
EC: Be a credit to their race? 
JR: Mm-hmm. 
EC: And do--. Yeah, [break in audio; interruption from crew] Were you 
aware of the sit-ins and the Freedom Rides, before you go to college? 
JR: I was not. And that’s so surprising to me. It’s like, I probably even knew 
maybe Emmett Till. But I don’t remember it. Because I’m sure, given my mother— 
although we had a weekly subscription to Jet Magazine—but I don’t remember seeing that 
then. Unless I just blocked it out, or she made sure I didn’t see that issue. I don’t know. 
Because I do remember reading the Jet. 
EC: The Jet had plenty [35:00] on the sit-ins and the Freedom Rides, too. 
JR: It did. But I don’t remember any of that. 
EC: Huh. 
JR: I don’t remember any stuff. And then, I guess, so that’s why—I’m not 
really sure what, really, what draws me to the SDS meeting, but I don’t know if you want 
to get to that yet. 
EC: Yeah, tell us. So how did—? 
JR: Okay. 
EC: So, you were in your first year at Swarthmore. 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: And you end up at an SDS meeting? 
JR: Yes. And the SDS chapter was called SPAC, the Swarthmore Political 
Action Committee. And the co-chairs of that were Mimi Feingold and Carl Wittman. 
Now, Mimi, I did not know until 2010, when I go back to Swarthmore for this all-day 
Judy Richardson 
20 
Hands on the Freedom Plow meeting—conference. Whatever, event. And I go back, and 
I decide I need to look up who Mimi was. And I found out that she had done six weeks 
in Parchman Prison on the Freedom Rides. Before she comes back to be co-chair of 
SPAC. 
EC: You didn’t know that? 
JR: I didn’t know that! When Fm looking at her, I knew nothing about her 
background. 
EC: Huh. 
JR: So, she was a CORE person. She was on CORE staff. She later goes into 
Plaquemine County—deadly. Plaquemine County, Louisiana. Didn’t know any of that. 
But mainly, I did not know that she had done the six weeks in Parchman before I see her 
standing up at a SPAC meeting. Her co-chair, Carl Wittman—later, after he leaves 
Swarthmore, they get married. That didn’t work out too well; he was gay. And then, he 
then becomes big in the gay rights movement. And he does this big treatise that people 
use. 
So, they were leaders then. And at this point, they were really doing a lot around- 
-well, SPAC had three main things. One was organizing the all-black cafeteria staff for 
better working conditions, better pay, health conditions, all that stuff. And then I’ll get 
back to that. Second was doing tutorials in Chester, Pennsylvania, which still has the pits 
school. I mean, just horrible, primarily black schools. So, they were doing tutorials. 
And then the third thing was helping Gloria Richardson and CNAC, the Cambridge 
Nonviolent Action Committee, a SNCC affiliate, with opening up the segregated public 
facilities. Cambridge black folks had had the vote since the [19]40s, but now they were 
Judy Richardson 
21 
opening up the—trying to de-segregate the public facility. So, it was those three things. It 
was the black cafeteria staff, and the tutorial in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Cambridge, 
Maryland. 
So, all-black cafeteria staff—I’m work-study. So, Fm—. See, it’s hard, 
particularly for young people, to understand what something like Swarthmore was like. I 
mean, it was gorgeous. So gorgeous. So, the dining hall was this gorgeous dining hall, 
with these big, old, wooden tables. And we all sat around it. And we were served. 
Nobody had to bus their own tables. You never thought of that. So, the waitresses would 
come in, and they would not only serve you, but they would take the stuff back, the plates 
back. 
Well, I was one of the waitresses in the evening. I think maybe two or three 
nights, because I was work-study, as part of my four-year all tuition paid. So, one of the 
things that the black cafeteria staff had been trying to get was covering on this open—it 
was a big hot-water pipe that was right on one of the walls. And so, they would—in the 
rush to go back and forth in the dining hall, they would sometimes back into it. And they 
would get singed, on their leg. Swarthmore never did anything about it. So, that was one 
of their—one. Just one of the grievances they had. Okay. F m moving back and forth. I 
hit it. And I swear to God, I had “H20” backwards on my inner thigh—oh yeah. 
EC: Oh-. 
JR: For years. 
EC: Ouch. 
JR: Oh, it was amazing. Now, of course, the college is really worried about 
me. 
Judy Richardson 
22 
EC: Right? 
JR: So, when it happens, I remember Mimi saying—. 
EC: Because you’re a student. 
JR: You got it. I’m a student. And I don’t have to worry about whether I sue 
them, because I’m not working—you know, it’s like—. 
EC: Yeah. 
JR: Okay, so I remember Mimi saying to me, “We’ve got to figure out—.” She 
was really concerned that I was okay. There was that. But the other thing was, “How 
can we use this to open up stuff for the rest of the really-working [40:00] cafeteria staff?” 
So, I remember being called into some—. 
EC: Are already going to the SDS meetings, by now? 
JR: Yes. I’m sorry. And I’m sorry, I should have mentioned that before, 
because it’s how I get there. But anyway, yes. And I’ll go back to how I get there. 
So, she says, “This is what we’re going for. Da-da-da-da” And there was this 
wonderful woman, whose name I can’t remember, from the black cafeteria staff, who— 
and it’s like I’m doing trays—who would come to our meetings, and she often brought 
some other black—usually female workers, because I think it might have been all female. 
I don’t know who was in the kitchen, but in terms of the waitstaff, I’m pretty sure it was 
all-black female. Anyway, she was amazing. Because I had, in one of my old diaries, I 
had that she had—she was commenting on how amazing she was, and stuff. And just 
smart as a whip. You know, it was just—so anyway. 
So, I remember being called into some administrative office. The Dean’s Office. 
Somebody who is clearly very nervous about the fact that I have gotten this thing. 
Judy Richardson 
23 
EC: Injury? 
JR: Yes, this injury. And they want to know what I want. And so, I had been 
schooled by Mimi about, you know, “Well, this is what we need, and da-da-da” And if I 
remember correctly, we got some of it. But it was also because this waitstaff really was 
strong. I mean, they were really amazing, and stuff. And I’m sure Swarthmore was 
aware of its Quaker heritage, and the—you know, it looked bad. 
EC: Felt a little pressure? 
JR: A little pressure. 
EC: In the right way? 
JR: That’s right. Exactly. 
EC: Make a move. 
JR: Yes. That’s it. 
EC: Yeah. 
JR: And so, but the reason I first started going to the meetings is that, it really 
is because—I sometimes say it’s because my mother’s not there to stop me. I’m sampling 
everything. I’m a freshman. It’s like, “What can I get into? What’s going on?” You 
know, all that stuff. [Laughter] 
So, I happen to—I don’t know who told me about it, but somebody mentions it, or 
I see a leaflet. And I said, “Let me just try this.” And I get deeper and deeper into it. 
That’s the thing. I have no idea what draws me. But for the first time, I see somebody 
actually protesting some of this stuff. I mean, I think in the back of my mind, I always 
knew there were things going on. But it’s not something my mother would raise, it’s not 
something I was talking about when I was at Tarrytown. And maybe it was cumulative. 
Judy Richardson 
24 
You know, finally, at this point, at sixty-two, sixty-three, maybe I’m actually waking up 
to some of the racial stuff. I don’t know. But I go to this thing, and they are so amazing 
to me. I mean, Mimi was just amazing. Carl somewhat but it was Mimi who I really— 
because she was just energetic, and it was amazing. 
So, we do whatever we do with them. I go to this meeting, I find out what their 
agenda—what programs they’re working on. And then, through them, I go to that first 
bus ride, going down to Cambridge, Maryland. So, I sign up for the bus ride. 
EC: Is this a weekend? 
JR: It’s a weekend. That’s right. Because the guarantee was that you would 
go down on a Saturday, and you would come back Sunday night. And you would do 
picket lines. And the guarantee was that you would come back Sunday night, so we’d be 
there for Monday classes. 
EC: And this is going to Cambridge, Maryland? 
JR: Cambridge, Maryland, which I think was maybe about two and a half 
hours away. Yeah. 
EC: And were Swarthmore students doing like Howard students and diverting 
student money into supporting the movement with buses, and the like? 
JR: Oh, that’s interesting. I don’t know. 
EC: Okay. 
JR: You know, because I really am new. So, I don’t really know what Mimi 
was doing. 
EC: You just get on the bus. 
Judy Richardson 
25 
JR: I just get on the bus. That’s exactly it. I get on the bus. And we were one 
of many colleges from the area, who were going down. So, you would get there, and it 
wouldn’t just be Swarthmore College students, it would be—because I remember Mark 
Suckel who later goes down to the national office. He’s coming from someplace. You 
would see Morgan State folk. And I don’t remember the Howard people, but I remember 
some of the other nearby—Goucher, I remember, was coming down. 
EC: And so, this is spring? Fall? 
JR: No! Oh, I see. Okay, I get in—. 
EC: So, it’s-. 
JR: So, it would be fall. Probably late fall. 
EC: Fall of [19]62? 
JR: [Nineteen] sixty-two. That’s right. 
EC: Okay. 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: And what was it like, to go to Cambridge and participate in the picketing? 
JR: I have certain memories. And so, that’s really it. What I remember is the 
first—one of the first demonstrations. I’m not sure if it was the first. And I remember we 
were trying to integrate the Choptank Inn. And I remember being enough close that I 
could see inside the Inn. And it was an old bar and grill. It was dirty. [45:00] It was 
dank. It smelled, I would say, of rotgut liquor. I mean, it just—nasty. And I’m thinking, 
“Why am I trying to get in here? [Laughter] This is a nasty place.” 
EC: “I do not want to be here.” 
Judy Richardson 
26 
JR: No! Exactly. Under normal circumstances, you—yes. Okay. [Laughter] 
But it was like, I see this big, burly white guy, who’s telling me I can’t come in because 
I’m black. And I see him, and it’s like, “You’re telling me? I can’t—!” You know, it 
was stupid. [Laughter] So, at a certain point, we start getting arrested. 
EC: You didn’t have a confidence issue, did you? 
JR: No, right? [Laughter] Right. Well, in many ways, I did. But with this 
thing, no. It was clear. That was clear. 
So, I then—either there, or we were also trying to integrate the skating rink. 
Which, you know, and everybody ice-skated at that. And it was a roller rink, too. 
EC: Is that in Cambridge? 
JR: In Cambridge, right. In Cambridge. And that was the source of it, 
initially. Because the reason Gloria Richardson, who is, at that point, the overt leader. I 
mean, she’s the one who most of the media knows. But as she often said, this was a—you 
know, this was group leadership, in Cambridge. And so, there were a lot of people who 
were part of the main committee and stuff. But Gloria, it’s her daughter, and the young 
people in Cambridge, who decide they want to integrate the roller—I used to know the 
name of it. But the rink, the skating rink. 
And so, Gloria and one of her, maybe relatives. It might have been her cousin-in- 
law, as a matter of fact. But in any event, the two women go down to SNCC, because 
they decide they need help, in terms of how to organize demonstrations. And Gloria 
says, you know, she put on little white gloves, and they had heels and stuff. And of 
course, they walk into the national office, and everybody’s in jeans and overalls. 
[Laughter] But they had their [work?] gloves. So, who gets sent as a SNCC field 
Judy Richardson 
27 
secretary is Reggie Robinson. And he’s the one I first meet as a SNCC person when I go 
in. 
But the reason they choose the roller rink is because it’s the young people. And 
Gloria said—it was her daughter who said, “We’re tired of this.” But the older people 
knew, “We don’t know how to quite do this. We don’t want the young people going 
crazy. And so, we need to figure out how to organize this.” But also, Gloria was—you 
know, her family was well-known, both among the black people and the white people. 
She and her family had the drug store. They had various businesses. Pop Herb, whom I 
stayed with overnight, when I would come down, Pop Herb was [at] the funeral parlor. 
EC: So, would a lot of people be there? 
JR: I remember a lot of people. But it went off and on. You know, it wasn’t 
always that. But in terms of Pop Herb, as the funeral director, he would put up bail for 
us. There would be people who would stay in his attic, because I remember staying 
there. Mark, I remember, was there. There were other people. You know, we would be 
housed up there. And yeah. So, that—yeah. 
EC: Can you—you said Reggie Robinson was the first SNCC person you met? 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: And Gloria’s the visible leader here in Cambridge. 
JR: Mm-hmm. 
EC: Do you remember what your impressions were of them, or of—? 
JR: Yes, and before I forget, what I meant to say, before I got into who was 
staying there. One of the things that was clear with Gloria—and we can get into this later, 
but I want to, while I’m thinking about it—was that she was never philosophically 
Judy Richardson 
28 
nonviolent. And in fact, when her daughter said—when she’s bringing people in and 
stuff, her daughter said specifically to Gloria, “Ma, you can’t come on the picket line, 
because you’re going to hit somebody.” [Laughter] And Gloria said she knew that was 
true, and said, in fact, that one time, she said they—she saw white guys, whom she knew. 
She said, “I knew these guys! I grew up here. They grew up here. They’re calling me 
names.” She said, when the picket line ended, when they started leaving, she said, “I 
tripped one of them.” [Laughter] So, that was Gloria. 
EC: So, it’s not only that she wasn’t philosophically nonviolent—. 
JR: She wasn’t even tactically nonviolent. [Laughter] Mm-mm. No. Except 
on the line. She understood that, “On the line, I will be tactically—.” But her main thing 
was, when the demonstrations are gone, all bets are off. And she said, “If they come on 
our side of Race Street—,” because Race Street was the dividing line between white and 
black in Cambridge, Maryland. She said, “I can’t guarantee one way or the other their 
safety.” Yeah. 
EC: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and Cambridge, of course, became kind of notorious for 
some of the battles. 
JR: Yes. 
EC : But you weren’t there for that. 
JR: I was not there for that. [50:00] And I sometimes resent the way the 
history says it, which is, you know, it’s when Stokely goes in that suddenly, or Rap goes 
in, that suddenly everything goes—. Those people were never philosophically nonviolent. 
And so, yeah, mm-hmm. 
Judy Richardson 
29 
EC: And they were always protecting the black community when whites would 
come on rampages through—. 
JR: Yes. 
EC: Driving down the street, and shooting, and—. 
JR: That’s correct. They were like Birmingham, on Bombingham Hill. Same 
thing, which was, the black community protected its community. If you come in here—. 
And so, Cambridge did the same thing. When people, when the white vigilantes, the 
white domestic terrorists came through, then you would find that black people—and white 
people knew that—that black people did have their guns, and they would shoot them. I 
mean, shoot at them. 
EC: So, you said that you’re trying things out, because you’re away from 
home, and do you remember how you felt, participating in the sit-ins? 
JR: I felt amazing. I mean, I really did. It was such energy, to me, to be part 
of—. I mean, if I had done it by myself, it would be one thing. But it was like, I was part 
of this group, these young people who were my age, and a lot of them were black. I 
mean, that was the thing, when I get into SNCC, that—well, anyway, a lot of them are 
doing something about the stuff that I have sublimated, all of my life, in Tarrytown. I 
mean, I knew black people couldn’t move anywhere on Broadway, or the other side of it. 
I knew that. But it was a given. I knew that I didn’t see any black businesses. I didn’t 
see this. You know, I didn’t see anything, in terms of Tarrytown, aside from my father, 
and other people, going to the plant. There was no black middle class in Tarrytown. 
The one time we got somebody who actually had money was when Chris 
Calloway, Cab Calloway’s daughter came in, and she was in our senior class. Or maybe 
Judy Richardson 
30 
our junior class, because she didn’t last long. They eventually moved her to a private 
school, I think. But that was the first time I saw anybody who was middle-class. So, 
even seeing people who were running their own businesses, as I saw in Cambridge, and 
other black communities in the South, I didn’t see any of that in Tarrytown. 
So, this was amazing. It was, first of all, I see black young people. And white 
young people, who were fighting this thing. We are so tight. You know, the camaraderie 
is so amazing. I’m going to these mass meetings, where people are singing these 
freedom songs, and it’s like, you lift up to another place. And I’m not religious, all right? 
My mother read the Bible every Sunday, but she hated organized religion, so I never 
went to church, except once, which we can mention. 
Well, let me just divert. I started going to the Baptist church—the white Baptist 
church in Tarrytown. Mm-hmm. Didn’t last long. [Laughter] I go one summer. And I 
think I came through maybe the camp. It might have started that way. My mother was 
very pleased, because even though she could not handle organized religion, for whatever 
reason, she never mentioned it. She was pleased that I was going to church. 
EC: So, this was probably like Bible camp, or something? 
JR: Yes, that’s what was it. 
EC: Vacation Bible school? 
JR: It was Bible camp. Because—it must have been, because I remember—I 
got a dollar for memorizing the books of the Bible. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, 
Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth. First and Second Samuels, First and 
Second Kings—, 
EC: Did you get extra money—, 
Judy Richardson 
31 
JR: —okay—. 
EC: —if you said it fast? 
JR: Yes. Well, that was the only way I could remember it. [Laughter] That’s 
exactly—that’s it. Yes! But I got this dollar, and my mother was very pleased. And I 
did—anyway. 
But then, I overheard some of the—because it was all white. You know, I think I 
was the only black child. 
EC: Little speck of dust. 
JR: Yes. [Laughter] And I hear some of the white people in the church—I 
don’t know, I happened to just overhear this. And I hear them saying that, you know, 
“We have to be—,” they say, “We have to be careful, because we don’t want too many 
black kids coming in, because then we’ll get overrun.” Okay. That was the last time I 
ever went to camp. I never went to church. My mother never said anything. That was it. 
So. 
So now, I’m in Cambridge. It’s this mass meeting. It’s a black church. And it’s 
like, “Oh! Okay, you know.” Because it’s the songs. It’s the songs. And what they’re 
preaching about, of course, is freedom, and liberation, and—I mean, it’s all that stuff. So, 
when I go back to Swarthmore each Monday, and then it becomes maybe—each Sunday. 
Then sometimes it becomes Monday, because we get held over. Then—[pause] well, 
when I go back, I’m taking all of this back with me, to campus. And that energy, I’m 
taking back with me. 
EC: So, you get church without religion. 
Judy Richardson 
32 
JR: Yes, exactly. The best part. It’s wonderful. [Laughter] [side discussion; 
not transcribed] [break in audio] 
EC: [55:00] So, you’re getting increasingly involved with the protests, the 
demonstrations, related to campus and in Cambridge? 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: And what makes you—I know you decide to take a year off school. How 
do you make that decision? 
JR: Ah, right. Okay. Well, Penny Patch, who had been in her sophomore 
year. White student. She had gone down to Southwest Georgia. And I’d heard about 
her, but she wasn’t on when I first come in that first semester. Second semester, she 
returns from Albany, Georgia, and the SNCC project. And she hears that I have been— 
from the SPAC people—that I have been going to the meetings. And so, she comes into 
my dorm room. And she said, “Look, I hear that you’ve been going to the meetings and 
the demonstrations, and you might want to think about taking off the next semester,” 
which would have been the first semester of my sophomore year, “and working full-time 
with SNCC in Cambridge, Maryland.” And so, you know, I start thinking. She said, 
“However, if you do decide to do this, you’ve got to apply.” Because I’m coming from 
the North. If I were Southern and black, it wouldn’t have been a problem. But so, she 
said, “If you do decide to do this, you’ve got to go by Ruby Doris.” And that’s what she 
meant. Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson, the amazing administrator in the national office in 
Atlanta. 
Judy Richardson 
33 
I didn’t know anything about Ruby Doris then. So, I said, “Okay, well, let me see 
what happens.” So, I think I went ahead and applied, and then got confirmation that I had 
been accepted for this next—you know, for the—. 
EC: And you’re specifically applying to work in Cambridge? 
JR: Yes. 
EC: And so, you’re going to live with the Richardson family. Not your kin, 
but ( )-? 
JR: Right. And actually, probably not them. Probably Pop Herb, because 
that’s where I used to stay. And so, I get that I’ve been allowed to do this. Because I’d 
gotten back from SNCC that there’s confirmation. And so now, the point is, how do I tell 
my mother that I’m thinking about doing this? So, I go to the hall phone, because of 
course it’s before cell phones. I go to the hall phone. I call my mother. And I tell her— 
you know, I frame it in the sense, which I had done, I contacted the administration. I was 
guaranteed that I was going to continue—I would maintain my full four-year scholarship. 
Nothing would change. I could come back in again. They were kind. They were cool 
with it. 
So, I tell her all this. And to me, she was amazingly calm. She had some 
questions. But then, I hang up, and I go back to my dorm room, and I’m thinking, “I’m 
over. I’ve made it through this.” And I had been so worried about it, right? I don’t make 
it more than, in my mind, I’m thinking twenty to thirty minutes, and I get called back to 
the hall phone. Somebody picked it up, [and] calls me. I get to the phone, and it is my 
older sister, nine years older than me, Carita, who we call “Kita.” And she is screaming 
at me over the phone, like, “What are you thinking of? You can’t do this! Da-da-da-da- 
Judy Richardson 
34 
da-da” And at that point, I think she was working for Columbia Records in the A&R 
division in New York City. And she said—you know, her main thing was, “You can’t 
sacrifice your education for this.” Okay? 
But then, somehow, I convinced her. And I told her, “I really have guaranteed 
that I’m coming back. It’s going to be okay. Da-da-da-da” And it somehow convinced 
her. And so, everybody’s agreed. I can do this now. So, I finish out the rest of that year. 
And then, I had already accepted to be a student—not intern, but a student worker at the 
nearby kind of halfway house. It was for foster kids. And so, I was a counselor, a 
student counselor there. That’s how I made my money. I wanted to not do it. But then, 
the person who had hired me had said, “Look, it’s too late for me to get somebody else 
now.” So, I made it through that. And then, I took the bus. I took the bus with the—in 
the fall, September and—no, it was October. Because I remember I still had the stub, bus 
trip and I went down and went to Cambridge. But before I tell you that, I should say— 
because it reminds me of my mother driving me with my sister down to Swarthmore that 
first time. And she had never gone to Bennington. Right? But I could see through her 
eyes that this was just amazing. This was—she had no sense of what Swarthmore meant, 
that it was an elite college. She had no sense of that, but she did have a sense that this 
was prestigious. [01:00:00] Rolling hills and, and they let me drive. 
Now had I known how I’d—if I had been them, I would never have allowed me to 
drive. Okay? [Laughs] Because, at that point I was—I have always driven fast. But I 
was eighteen, nineteen years old at that point and I remember driving through the, either 
the Holland or the Lincoln Tunnel. And at some point, I changed lanes. [Laughter] And 
I remember my sister saying, “No, you can’t change lanes in the tun—,” it was like, 
Judy Richardson 
35 
[Laughter] and I’m—okay—so we get down there, and my sister was absolutely 
wonderful. Because my sister could talk to anybody. I was very—I was shy in my own 
way. I mean, I didn’t know how to deal with strangers. I worried about talking to people 
and stuff. 
My sister didn’t worry about any of that. So, she could talk to anybody anywhere, 
whoever they were. So, she talks to everybody in the dorm. She gets to me, she 
introduces me, “This is my sister,” you know, she’s a—maid comes in. She’s—my sister 
was the life of the party wherever she was, so I feel easier because she has kind of paved 
the way for me. And my mother, my poor mother. Because see, my sister left and so it 
was really my mother and I growing up for those last years, and I was the baby, we were 
like this, my mother and I and so I don’t know how she made it. 
For me it was like, oh, Fm in this strange world and—but she’s going back to an 
empty house and I think about that now. It was just, it must have been hard. Yeah. So 
anyway, so she goes back with Kita and my sister Carita and Fm there and then my—get 
in and during the school year SPAC organizes not only this other stuff, but they decide to 
run a slate for the June, the May Queen. We did a May ceremony. That’s right, it was 
the May Queen. 
And so, it usually was the girlfriend of the football players. Or, no—no, not 
football because they had outlawed football at that point. Frats, all the frat boys, okay. 
So, it was somebody’s girlfriend, it was a sorority sweetheart, it was somebody. But it 
would split the vote. Well, with us, we ran a slate, the SDS slate and we all block-voted. 
Right? So, Mamie, [Laughs] head of SDS, you know, just got out of Parchman, becomes 
Judy Richardson 
36 
the May Queen and I become one of the princesses, because that’s what we were. And 
we had a little crown of little roses and stuff. 
My mother comes down for it. She is so proud. She does not know that a number 
of the firat boys and stuff are boycotting the ceremony. She doesn’t know that some of 
the people in the newspaper have mentioned, have really, first of all, been absolutely deaf 
on our demonstrations. And their editorial policy and some of the reporting, including 
from one of the people, Elsa, Elsa, who was sixteen when she comes on campus, was a 
friend of mine, had a total photographic memory. She was on my hall. Let me just go 
back and say, the demonstrations really split the campus. And so—. 
EC: And these aren’t demonstrations on campus. 
JR: No. 
EC: These are the demonstrations that you’re going to away from campus. 
JR: That is correct. 
EC: Okay. 
JR: So, these are the demonstrations in Cambridge, Maryland and these are the 
demonstrations where I hear this, you know, person from my Poli-Sci class who says, 
you know, these black students would be better off doing. He’s part of a group of folks 
who normally liberal, I thought. And so, that’s really coming out in the newspaper, in 
comments, because they’re interviewing students who are saying, again, the Negro 
students would be better off concentrating on their education. That’s right. 
So, when it gets to the point where—and we’re getting arrested and all that stuff, 
but now it’s getting to the May Queen and we have taken over the ceremony. So, a 
number of them don’t come. Of course, all of the kind of lib—progressive kids come and 
Judy Richardson 
37 
we do this. But the main thing is I’m thinking about my mother and she’s just proud as 
she can be that there’s her daughter with her little—the roses and the—and I introduce her 
to everybody and she had, she had remembered it from being down there, but it’s like, 
my mother was not traveled, and so she had gotten on the train, [1:05:00] come down, by 
herself. 
Now she was used to going to the city and to New York, but she knew the city and this 
was, this was new. And so yeah, she was very proud. 
EC: So, you gave her a nice memory before you quit school. 
JR: Yes, exactly, that’s right. Yes, I did. And she didn’t know that that’s 
what I was going to do, so it was okay. [Laughter] That’s right. So anyway. So, she 
goes back. We continue to the rest of it. 
EC: Mm-hmm. Can I ask you, so you mentioned Mimi and how important she 
is, Mimi Feingold, and that she had been on the Freedom Rides in that spring, [19]61, 
summer of [19]61 and then she’s one of the leaders of the SDS chapter when you’re 
there. She ends up in Louisiana with CORE. 
JR: Plaquemine Parish, that’s right. 
EC: And so, do you have a sense of sort of how she ends up in CORE and you 
end up in SNCC, sort of you two going in different directions? 
JR: The thing is see, when she came back from the Freedom Rides she was 
already CORE. When she comes back from Plaquemine Parish, no, I’m sorry, when she 
comes back from Parchment she is already CORE, I think. 
EC: Because of the Freedom Rides? 
JR: Freedom Rides. 
Judy Richardson 
38 
EC: That connection? 
JR: I think it’s the Freedom Rides. I don’t know where she first hooks up with 
CORE, because she’s from Brooklyn. I don’t know whether she’s doing stuff with Amie, 
whatever, I can’t remember his name, but the Brooklyn CORE chapter was major. 
EC: I just kind of find it interesting that you’re on the same campus and you 
end up in the field with different civil rights organizations. 
JR: It is except that I’m coming through Cambridge and she’s not necessarily. 
She’s already an activist before we go into Cambridge. 
EC: But she’s still going to Cambridge, right? 
JR: Absolutely. 
EC : I mean, but that’s not her introduction. 
JR: That’s it. 
EC: Okay. 
JR: Yeah. So, she—and I didn’t even know about CORE, but she was already 
that when I see her, yeah. 
EC: I wonder, you don’t know when she goes into the field, do you? Does she 
go the same year you do? 
JR: No. No, I don’t know wheth—you see, I’m pretty sure that she continues 
her, well, she was a senior, so I think she leaves Cambridge. I mean, I’m sorry, when she 
graduates, I’m pretty sure that’s when she goes into Plaquemine County in Louisiana. 
EC: I’m just kind of trying to think about those. I’ve been interested, 
personally, just in how people get into different organizations and so, sorry about the 
distraction. 
Judy Richardson 
39 
JR: No, no. Mm-mm. 
EC: So, you have a commitment to a summer job so you go home and you do 
your summer job and then it’s October and you head into Cambridge? 
JR: Yes. And I continue doing the Cambridge work. 
EC : What i s your work? 
JR: Truthfully, I have no real memory, except demonstrations. 
Demonstrations, getting arrested, you know. It wasn’t voter registration, obviously, 
because they had the vote already. So, Em pretty sure most of that was demonstrations 
and organizing around that and getting adult community involved as much as the 
students, although they were pretty much already involved, adults at that point. So, I 
don’t really remember, because see, I don’t stay that long. Because then by—as a matter 
of fact, I hadn’t thought about this. I go down in October. By November, I’m down in 
the Atlanta office. Because what happens is that Reggie Robbins, who says, “Look, I’m 
going, I’m taking the train to—,” either Cleveland or Cincinnati, I can’t remember which. 
EC: Cincinnati. 
JR: Cincinnati. Okay. Because—what’s his name from Arkansas? 
EC: Bill Hansen. 
JR: Bill Hansen. And wife, from southwest Georgia. Oh God. No, not from 
southwest—it’ll come to me. They’re getting married. Right. Yeah, it—. 
EC: Ruthie? 
JR: Ruthie. Ruthie Harris. 
EC: No. 
Judy Richardson 
40 
JR: Mm-mm. Ruthie, well, Ruthie. We’ll leave it at that because I’ll get 
totally off. So, Bill Hansen and Ruthie are getting married in- 
EC: Cincinnati. 
JR: Cincinnati. And Bill Hansen was a white field secretary working in 
Arkansas, which is where Ruthie was from. Right? And they’re getting married. Reggie 
knew Bill and so he says, “I’m going to take the train from Cambridge. Come with me 
and on the way back we’ll go through the national office and then come back up again,” 
okay. So, we take the train to Ohio. I meet Ruthie. Now either his or her family was 
boycotting the—because it was interracial, so Ruthie was black, Bill was white. I just 
remember that Ruthie said she had nobody to be her maid of honor. Now I had never 
seen either of these people before. They pour me into some little black dress. 
They put heels on me. And now I’ve been in jean skirts all this time. I’ve been in 
sneakers, right. So, I have to fit into this little dress and then walk in these heels and I’m 
the maid of honor for this person I’ve never met before and then we go through the 
ceremony and then on the way back we get to the national office. So, [1:10:00] I get to 
this office, which in my mind I’m thinking is going to be like Urban League. With rugs 
on the floor and people dressed in little suits and stuff and okay. Well, maybe not the 
suits. Because I mean, I had seen what the field workers looked at, but see, in my mind 
I’m thinking also, this is a national office so they’re probably dressed differently. Okay. 
So, I get to the—the office was at 8 U—6 and 8 U Raymond Street, I think, but 
anyway 8 U Raymond Street, which was a side street off Hunter—not Hunter Road. God, 
what was the main drag? It’s now Martin Luther King Drive. 
EC : Y ou sure it’s not Hunter? 
Judy Richardson 
41 
JR: Oh, maybe it is. It’s Hunter, yeah, it’s Hunter. Which is now Martin 
Luther King Boulevard. Okay. So, you went down, it was right near the Atlanta 
University Center and you’d go off to the right if you were coming from downtown and it 
was a small, small street. And it was right next to either a beauty parlor; I think it was a 
beauty parlor. And it was like a door—what do you call it? A glass door and I see Reggie 
get to the door and there’s this guy at the top of the stairs and he’s sweeping the stairs. 
He’s in overalls. I hear Reggie hollering and whoop and holler and either he or the guy 
says, “Hey, captain, how you doing?” and they hug like long lost brothers, right? 
And I’m thinking, how egalitarian. Egalitarian is SNCC because this is the, you 
know, the custodian. Right? And then I find out it’s Jim Forman, the executive secretary 
of the organization. And he is sweeping, as he often did, because it really was a lesson 
for him. It was everybody in SNCC needed to see him sweeping so that they knew that 
every job was important and yeah, you were supposed to keep it as clean as you could, 
the office and secondly, that no job was too lowly for anybody in the organization to do. 
So, he would periodically, you know, sweep the stairs, not very well, let me just 
say. But he would do it. Okay. So, then I come up. Reggie says to him, “I’m coming 
from Swarthmore; we’re on our way back to Cambridge,” Forman finds out that I can 
take shorthand, which is like, I try and tell people it’s kind of like texting, but with 
symbols. So, everything had a symbol that we did. And I knew, I had learned this and 
could type 90 words a minute; both of those because—Tarrytown public schools, when 
I’m at Washington Irving Junior High School in seventh grade, because I’m black and it 
really was that, because I was at the top of my class. They shift me in secretarial, 
assuming that I’m going to do the secretarial route. Okay. 
Judy Richardson 
42 
Now at that point my sister, hello, was at Bennington, but that’s okay. And so— 
and also, I’m under the Hill, you know, it’s all stuff. So. My mother makes sure that it’s 
only that year. She—I do remember her being very upset when she heard that I was being 
shifted into this. So—I either took the whole semester in the seventh grade or the whole 
year, either way, I now can type ninety words a minute and I can take great shorthand. 
So. 
EC: I wonder, somebody should like make a keyboard with shorthand. 
JR: They should. And there are older—well, let me not get, okay, so, yeah. 
And I’ll get to Joanne Grant in my shorthand notes when I’m taking it at SNCC, but—so 
Forman finds this out and then decides I’m going to be his secretary. So, Reggie goes 
back to Cambridge alone. 
EC: So much for Cambridge. 
JR: So much for Cambridge. I leave my clothes there. I don’t remember what 
happens with the clothes. They probably stay in Pop Herb’s—I don’t know what happens. 
And then I go into the Freedom House, which is where the female staff, some of the 
female staff from the national office lived. But my first image was—. 
EC: So, this is like fall [19]63. 
JR: That’s correct. And the reason I remember it was November was because 
the first staff meeting I remember was, and we had called in, it wasn’t just the Atlanta 
national movement staff; it was also the—the field staff. And Kennedy had just been shot. 
And so, there’s this whole discussion about how we’re going to respond to it, particularly 
given that the federal government hasn’t done diddly-squat for us and stuff and I 
remember Forman saying, “We have to be very careful about this,” I remember Dinky 
Judy Richardson 
43 
crying. Dinky, who was Forman’s second, becomes later on Forman’s second wife. But 
I remember her being the only one who was crying, actually. Fm sure there were others, 
but most of the people were really trying to figure out, how do we respond to this 
strategically? So yeah, that’s how I remember I was there by November. [1:15:00] 
EC: I remember something about that wedding. Buffington? 
JR: Buffington. 
EC: Buffington? Is that Ruthie’s name? 
JR: Ruthie, that might be. I don’t remember. 
EC: I don’t know. Seems like I remember you telling me something about that 
wedding, like was something illegal or was something—do you remember anything? 
JR: No. 
EC: Okay. 
JR: I might have once remembered it, but I don’t now. 
EC: I don’t remember either. So—. 
JR: Because I don’t think there was any miscegenation law there. So, yeah. 
EC: What was your job with Forman, as Forman’s secretary, what is that—? 
JR: Well, I’ll tell you, before I get to that, let me tell you what—when you 
came into the Atlanta office, okay, when you first came in you came up the stairs from 
the, with the plate—with the window behind you. Come up the stairs. You came into the 
kind of reception area and that would have been, you would have seen, oh gosh, I 
remembered his name before. 
EC: Jimmy Bolton? 
Judy Richardson 
44 
JR: Jimmy Bolton, thank you, yes. Jimmy Bolton was there and he was one of 
the few guys—now Jimmy was the only person who was overtly gay. I’m sure there were 
other people, male and female, but he was the only one who didn’t really try and hide it. 
And then there were other people at the two desks and Jimmy, by the way, eventually 
goes off with his mate to Australia. But at that point he is Jimmy and it’s—maybe Nancy 
Stern, other people, other people, because we took turns being reception at the reception 
area. If you went off, if you looked to the left you would see Julian Bond and he was 
Communications Director. When I get there Mary King is his assistant. Then, yeah—we 
didn’t have titles, but she was, Julian was the Communications Director, so—. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
JR: So, when I get there Dottie Zellner had already left, who had been the 
previous person assisting Julian in Communications, but so it’s Julian and it’s Mary 
King, it’s Bobby Yancy, who becomes the second in command at the Schaumburg later 
on and stays there for twenty-five years but is at that point she’s head of, I think 
relationships with the—what now is known as the HBC, it was the black campuses. There 
was Billy Stafford. 
EC: Campus Travelers. 
JR: Campus Travelers, that’s right. And so, she’s head of that, the Campus 
Travelers, thank you. And then there is Billy Stafford, who was doing some other work 
with black campuses and Billy later goes to, is wonderful, social, urban planner at City 
College in New York, but at that point is doing work something around black colleges, 
but I can’t remember exactly what. And then there is Jack Minnis, who was the main 
person, he was the head of our research department and we had this incredible, I mean, he 
Judy Richardson 
45 
was incredible. He is this crusty old white guy who, excuse me, drank too much, smoked 
too much, you would go in office, it was like a fog, it was like China. And yet he could 
pull research from a stone. 
So, can I mention the thing? Okay. There was something he did which became 
a—this is the Mississippi chronology and it’s a chronology of—it’s called the Mississip-, 
Chronology of Violence and Intimidation in Mississippi since 1961. And what Jack did 
was he compiled all of these pages with photos and what was called WATS Line, so that 
was the Wide Area Telephone Service; that was like the eight hundred number, that 
people could call into at any hour, either at, to our national office or to one of us in the 
national office. If a church were being bombed or somebody had been arrested. Some 
violence to voter registration workers; they would call in. And the WATS Line meant 
that it was—somebody—and this is when you still had operators. So, somebody say it’s— 
Emma Bell and Emma Bell calls and says, “Hollis Watkins has just been arrested,” but 
she can’t say that. 
She calls and calls person-to-person for Hollis Watkins. Okay. And so, Hollis 
Watkins we know, oh, so that’s Hollis Watkins, he’s in the second CD, Second 
Congressional District; we know the number. We know it’s about—oh, no, no, I’m sorry, 
mm-mm. She would say, “Em calling for Emma Bell,” okay, she would call for herself 
and then she’d say, “Em calling person-to-person to Emma Bell,” we would say, “Miss 
Bell is not here right now,” “Is there a number where can reach her?” and then we would 
know to call her back. What happened is that at a certain point the all-white operators, 
telephone operators in Mississippi [1:20:00] realized what we were doing. They would 
then cut off when the person tried to give the number. But until that, we at least always 
Judy Richardson 
46 
had the name. Okay. So, then we would hang up and then on this eight hundred line, the 
WATS Line, we would call back for free and find out that Hollis Watkins was in jail or 
somebody had been a church had been burned or whatever. Those WATS Line reports 
are the reports that are compiled for that Mississippi chronology and ITl—. 
EC: Go ahead. 
JR: Okay. The reason that was so important, having a chronology was that it 
showed the pattern of racial, of white supremacy. So, nobody could say, well, it was just 
Governor Thompson. He’s particularly racist. Or it was this sheriff in Greenwood or in a 
sec—it’s the system of racism and you show that through the pattern of all of these 
churches, all of these people being beaten for voter registration; the systemic nature of 
the white supremacy. And then what they’ve done to basically, supposedly, federally 
protected rights, just run roughshod over them, right. I will say I used that. I used it not 
only to give a chronology when we’re doing the films, but more particularly when I leave 
Boston the first time and its LA and there’s yet another case of police brutality in LA. 
And I’m working for a film company; Rainbow TV Works. This was [19]80 to 
[19]81-[19]82. I know from Jack Minnis’s chronology. So, I say to the people who were 
working on this, “We need a chronology, so that we can che—” and I say, “So that we can 
show the pattern of it,” and to them it’s like, oh, what a good idea. I would not have 
known it, had it not been for Minnis. Okay. When I’m working as the Director of 
Information of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice and there’s 
this spade of police brutality. You know, it’s Howard Beach racially motivated violence. 
It’s Eleanor Bumpers is sixty-nine years old, gets off by Officer Sullivan with a shotgun 
Judy Richardson 
47 
on an eviction notice. It’s Michael Stewart, twenty-three years old, gets beaten to death 
in a, for doing graffiti in a New York City subway—it’s all of that. 
But what I say to the committee that we’re working with is, “We need a 
chronology,” Minnis, right? We need a chronology to show it’s not just the cop hasn’t 
had enough sensitivity training is because he’s in the midst of a systemic, racist police 
department. Right? It’s like what they’re doing—but anyway, so. 
EC: Like what The Guardian is doing now, trying to log all of the police 
murders in the U.S.? 
JR: That’s right. Because the NRI wouldn’t let us keep any stats in this 
country. Right? So, the UK is keeping the best stats, hello. Which is why I’m glad, by 
the way, that in Chicago—I’m going to far field. But I’m going to say this. Why in 
Chicago, they had gone back to that brutal man who tortured black citizens in the [19]80s 
and then got finally put up for charges and I think may have spent some time, I’m not 
sure, but he’s legend. And people kept talking about him because he was brutal. He 
tortured people. That ( )—got guilty pleas from them when they weren’t guilty. We 
did an Eyes on the Prize, the Hampton and Clark. 
Fred Hampton and Mark Clark assassinations in the second series of Eyes on the 
Prize, which people are now harkening back to because that’s another case where, you 
know, the cop said, “Oh, we had to protect ourselves,” and they found out that all of the 
bullets were going inside the Black Panthers’ Chicago office, all of them, because the 
cops were stupid enough to leave the office open. So, people of the communities walking 
through, the media’s walking through, right, anyway, the main thing—. 
Judy Richardson 
48 
EC: And this is the, from Eyes on the Prize second series, the episode, A 
Nation ofLawl About the police murder of Fred Hampton and—. 
JR: Mark Clark. 
EC: Mark Clark in Chicago? 
JR: That’s correct. 
EC: All right. You were going to say, and this is important because? 
JR: And so, this is important because one of the things you get is the pattern of 
it. People always wonder, well, why are they going off? It’s like in Detroit. Why would 
they go, why would the black community go totally berserk because some cops are 
closing what’s called a, what’s called The Blind Pig there; an after hours joint. That 
makes absolutely no sense. Well, if you go back and you find out there was the Big Four; 
two white and two black cops, which would stop all of these people, even if they were 
just singing doo-wop, this is Detroit, right? Doo-wop, we have to explain all that in Eyes 
on the Prize, because otherwise it makes no sense. It’s the pattern, the systemic pattern 
of police brutality that always exists in any of these cities and it’s always, always the 
jumping off point. Always. 
It’s something Steve Payer, who was the white writer and just a great guy, I mean, 
we clashed sometimes, but he was really serious [1:25:00] about his stuff and a great 
writer. So I remember at one point we’re doing Malcolm X: Make it Plain, right, for 
American Experience, PBS and I say, “The point is that, you know, when you’re doing 
Malcolm, what happens in LA, what happens in New York with the Muslim guy from the 
Fruit of Islam guy from Number Seven Mosque that’s part of the pattern and he said and 
he actually said, because he was interested he said, “What are you talking—?” I said, “The 
Judy Richardson 
49 
police are an occupying force in these communities,” and I said, “Now I know you can’t 
say that in there,” and she said, “Why not?” and it’s a line of narration. Right? 
EC: And you say “we” that’s Blackside. 
JR: Blackside and, yeah, Blackside and also, I wasn’t sure whether Orlando 
would be okay with that because it’s enough that we’re doing just the thing, enough that 
we’re doing Malcolm X: Make it Plain. 
EC: Sorry, I mean when you said “we were doing the film,” I meant it was 
Blackside that was doing the film. 
JR: Right. No, I thought you were going to say something else in the middle. 
No. And yes, it is Blackside, but it’s—Henry was not that much involved mMalcolm X: 
Make it Plain, so it really is, Orlando was the producer/director, I’m the co-producer and 
Steve is the series writer along with Orlando. So, it really is, you know, what Orlando 
and Steve feel, well, we can get through American Experience at that point. So, I was 
very happy that people could see, yeah, it’s an occupying force. And actually, I think I 
said “occupying army,” it’s like an occupying army. Yeah. 
But that has to do with back to this, chronology and the fact that it’s systemic and 
that you have to show that. And so, in fact, when we’re doing the police brutality, I did a 
chronology, right? And I’m saying to the groups that are there, “We need to do a 
chronology, so people see us. Not just Eleanor Bumpers. It’s not just Michael Stewart. 
It’s not just—.” And so they give me early stuff, because this is now the mid, this is the 
mid [19]80’s, so they go back to the [19]70’s, the [19]60’s. I draw up a chronology. 
I remember sending a packet out to a journalist, a reporter, black journalist who 
was with New York Newsday, because they were based in Long Island, but they then had 
Judy Richardson 
50 
a New York edition and they were really good. It was a great paper. And the reporter 
calling me and saying, “I’m getting this packet,” and it was not only the press release, but 
this chronology and he said, “Are you a reporter?” and I said, “No,” I said, and what I 
said was, “I was trained by the movement,” I didn’t say SNCC because I figured he 
wouldn’t know what SNCC was, but I said, “I was trained by the movement.” And so I 
said, “And one of the reasons I did the chronology was because—,” da-da-da, I didn’t say 
because Jack Minnis told me how to do this. 
But it’s always good and I was meeting with some young people, oh, BSO, 
Organization of Black, oh my goodness, OBS, not Organization of Black Survival. 
Organization of Black something, it’s OBS and it’s a group that’s been going on for the 
last twenty some years and they were involved also in the Ferguson responses. But they 
do grass roots community organizing. Struggle. Organization for Black Struggle. 
So, I had been showing our Orangeburg Massacre film at Washington University. 
This is right after Ferguson, so it was this year. And I’m showing the film and one of the 
professors, a young, black professor who was there in post-doc and he came up, he 
intro’ed me and then he said, “Would you be interested in speaking with some of the 
young people who are part of this organization of—,” what did I just say? 
EC: Black Struggle? 
JR: Black Struggle. And I said, “Oh, yeah,” so the day that I’m, the next day 
he brings some of them by WashU and we sit in the cafeteria and we’re talking and it’s 
clear. I said, “Look, I know that the stuff that we get in SNCC is not really, some of it 
will be useful, but it’s a different time,” and I know that it’s not just the technical stuff, 
Judy Richardson 
51 
it’s you’re dealing with a community that has seen all the stuff; it was supposed to change 
stuff and it hasn’t it. 
And the other thing they told me was, they said, “Well, the other thing is,” and 
actually the young professor said, he wasn’t a professor but anyway, the young faculty 
person said, and the other thing was that the movement kind of bypassed St. Louis, so the 
kind of folks you talk about with, you know, with Amzie Moore and Fannie Lou Hamer 
and— he said, “That didn’t really happen here,” and one of the people from OBS says to 
me, “Look, every King Day they have the usual Dr. King ceremony and the black 
glitterati come past,” you know and he said, she said, as a matter of fact she said, “And 
they get out of their limos,” and she said, “I call them the fur-coated ones.” [Laughter] 
And she said, “They come out with their fur coats. They go into whatever big black 
church and then they come back and they go back to the suburbs or wherever,” and she 
said, [1:30:00] “and so we don’t have that grounding that maybe you guys did at that 
time.” 
Now I’m sure that there are grass roots leaders they had there, but—and they’ve 
been working with them, but it made me realize, not everybody had the kind of stuff that 
we had. Nor the kind of cohesive communities that we had because for whatever, I made 
not churched, but I know the role that the black church played in the southern 
communities where we organized and you could go up on somebody’s porch and sit for a 
while and have some sweet tea and talk before, so they could get to know you. You can’t 
do that at Cabrini Green, when it was existed in Chicago. So, all of that stuff I know is 
different. But I showed them Jack. I showed them the chronology, right, and I said, 
toward the end—. 
Judy Richardson 
52 
EC: These are the kids in St. Louis now—? 
JR: These kids in St. Louis, young people in St. Louis and one older, because 
she was like forty, so she said, “Lm the older person here,” I show them this, they were 
so, it was like, we could use that. Because I said, you know, once these people see, it’s 
not just this and it’s not just that and it’s not just for any grade and I said, “History of it.” 
And it’s like when they’re finally now saying that, like ninety-nine percent I’m making 
this up, but certainly over ninety-five percent of the cops that have been put up on 
charges never go to trial. Because they just, it never goes anywhere. So, to know that 
kind of stat from the [19]60’s and the [19]70’s, how many cops get put up? How many 
cops, how many judgments are found? And when somebody said, “Fifteen million 
dollars has been put out to victims,” all that stuff, those stats are important. Yeah, you 
can have the protests and that’s important, too. 
But those stats are, you can’t, you can’t deny that kind of stuff. That’s Jack. I 
learned that in, in SNCC. So, he’s doing the Research Department. Back to the national. 
We get, we have a printing press and so, oh my goodness, I can’t remember the guy—. 
EC: Wilson Brown? 
JR: Wilson Brown, he was one of them and then there was another one who 
married and they went to Antioch. Oh, my goodness, who also ran it? But I’ll do Wilson 
until I can remember any—we had our whole printing press in the basement, right? So, 
that we didn’t have to depend on anybody, saying they wouldn’t print a certain leaflet. 
Had our own printing press. And then we had, so communications were also sending out 
the Student Voice, because we knew that the mainstream media wasn’t going to print the 
stuff that we wanted. So, we would send that out to the SNCC offices and so I forgot, we 
Judy Richardson 
53 
also had a Friends of SNCC, which was like Philadelphia, Mimi Shaw’s mother, Mrs. 
Shaw had a Friends of, is part of Friends of SNCC in Chicago or they’re all over the 
country. And so, if somebody got arrested, for example, then we’d get that WATS Line 
report, then we would call the Justice Department in the national office and then we 
would call a Friends of SNCC person. 
So, for example, you would call Mrs. Shaw in Chicago and she would then call 
the sheriffs office, if we had it. Well, his home at night, if we had his number. Or the 
office and then that person would say, Mrs. Shaw would say, “Look, we know you got 
Curtis or Hollis or, Mrs. Fannie Lou— Mrs. Hamer and they better come out of the jail the 
way they went in,” so you, for the first time, the white supremacists in Mississippi know 
somebody outside Mississippi is actually looking at this. Even before the summer of 
[19]64, we’re connecting people to this. So, we have somebody coordinating Friends of 
SNCC and that was Dinky Constancia Romilly and then there was, she was also doing 
Campus Friends of SNCC until Betty Garman comes in and she does the Campus Friends 
of SNCC and that was all the campus chapters; UC Berkeley, NYU, University of 
Chicago, all these campus things. So, we can call them. 
So, they’re being used as points where we’re getting information about the 
struggles that we’re doing. We’re getting photos out; we’re getting The Student Voice 
out. Press releases are going out. They’re trying to get it published in their school 
newspapers, information about it. If they have any contacts with the local media, they’re 
trying to get that in. So, it’s this network. Out of the national office are these networks 
of people all over the country whom we’re using for fundraising, for communications and 
for, yeah, fundraising, communications and whatever else. 
Judy Richardson 
54 
EC: What’s your contact like with people in the field in Mississippi and 
Georgia, Arkansas, [1:35:00] Alabama? 
JR: Yeah. They’re calling in. So when, for example, Emma Bell calls in, she 
calls into us. But also we have—or Margaret Block, for example, she said to me, “Do you 
remember, I had to call into you,” she said, “every day,” and during the summer of 
[19]64 they’re calling into the Jackson office, but before that they’re calling into the 
national office.” And I think we might have done it once a day, until [19]64 when it’s 
twice a day and going into the Jackson office. But once a day into the national office to 
say, “This is what happened,” to make sure we know they’re still there. And the main 
thing is, this is before cell phones, so if somebody didn’t have a dime for the coin box on 
the phone, you wanted to make sure they could get to you. 
So, they’re calling in, they’re telling us, maybe something incident that’s 
happened. But the other thing was Ruby Doris was serious about, “You will get me your 
monthly field reports and unless you send those to me, you will not get your little ten 
dollars a week,” which was of course, $9.64 after taxes. So, she was, I mean, Ruby, and 
the thing is, people really respected Ruby because I remember Ivanhoe saying, he said, 
“Yeah, people respected Forman for what he brought,” which was that administrative 
sense, knowing about history, collect everything, knowing how to construct an office and 
also just that long-range thinking. But Ruby, he said, “We knew she really, really cared 
about us,” and Ivanhoe once said to me, he said, “You know, when I was in jail,” and that 
was probably in Parchman, he said, and I guess it was Ivanhoe in Parchman? I’m trying 
to remember. Or was it a local jail? 
EC: When he went in with the truck of stuff? 
Judy Richardson 
55 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: That was in Cleveland, Mississippi. That’s where Amzie—. 
JR: Cleveland, Mississippi and Amzie, that’s right. 
EC: No, no, no, no. He was with Clarksdale. It was Aaron Henry. He was 
outside— 
JR: Yes. With the drugs and the pharmacies. That’s right. Was that the only 
time he was in? Maybe it was—. 
EC: Probably not. I mean—. 
JR: One of the times he was in he said he was in for however long and that he 
would get letters, Ivanhoe said every day and I said, “How did you get them every day?” 
He said, “I don’t know but I was getting,” he said, “letters from Ruby Doris every day, 
asking how I was doing. Just making sure that I knew somebody was taking care of me, 
was thinking about me and stuff.” And so Ruby would do that stuff and also because you 
know, she had such an amazing history. I mean, yeah, Jim Forman had been just 
brutalized in LA and he had been in Monroe and he’d been this and that. 
But Ruby had been in Parchman and Ruby had been in Rock Hill, South Carolina 
in those thirty days jail, no bail. And also just Ruby was just—Ruby had a presence. I 
mean, when Penny Patch says to me at Swarthmore, “You got to go by Ruby Doris to get 
your application accepted.” I didn’t really know what she meant, but I know that a lot of 
people were scared to death of Ruby Doris. I was. It was just, she was nice, but she was 
kind of like Miss Baker. She did not suffer fools gladly. 
EC: Was she still a Spellman student when you met her? 
Judy Richardson 
56 
JR: No, she was totally off that. She was fulltime in the office at that point. 
She had not yet married Cliff and had not yet had the baby. And that was funny, too. I 
remember we had a shower for Ruby when she was pregnant and the thing is, and it was 
all female, right? And normally, I mean people, women know what to do at showers. 
You have little chitchat and baby and so and so. We were SNCC women. All our 
discussions always had to do with politics and what was going on in the field and who 
was doing what. And so, I remember whole periods of silence. It was like, okay, so how 
do we talk about this? It’s like the kind of informal, it wasn’t like we weren’t friends. It 
wasn’t like we didn’t party. 
We knew how to party. But to have small talk, we didn’t do small talk too well. 
And we didn’t do baby stuff. It’s like, Julian was a family member, but he had his kids 
and Alice was off somewhere, she wasn’t part of the staff. I’m trying to think, Minnis 
was married, I’m sure, but they would—there were no babies. [Laughs] 
EC: So, was it different when the men are married and have their families, the 
men and the women? 
JR: Right. But also, I don’t remember ever seeing Ruby’s baby. I’m sure she 
brought him in at some point. But Chris took care of the baby. When she was away, but 
when she was away, [1:40:00] when she came into that office she was in the office. So, 
the shower was not—and she hadn’t had the baby yet and it was like—and none of the 
women that I remember had any babies. Nobody had any babies. [Laughs] How could 
you have babies when you were on call twenty-four/seven? It was like, anyway. 
So, I just remember the silences at the shower, yeah. So anyway, Ruby. Yeah. 
Was—she was just like a major force in that office and she’s saying, “I need your 
Judy Richardson 
57 
reports,” which is why, I remember you saying how interesting it was that you got, that 
there was so much documentation with SNCC and that’s because you had Ruby Doris 
saying, “You’ve got to write it down or you’re not going to get—.” Oftentimes we didn’t 
get the little $9.64. But at least you could expect it. Because I remember when I was in 
Cordele, Georgia, I didn’t get it one week and I had to go to the NAA guy, who really 
didn’t like my being in town, Cordele in southwest Georgia. 
And he ran the restaurant. And I had to say to him, “Could you just, I don’t have 
enough money for a hamburger, but could you just take this,” whatever little bit I had, 
and he said, I remember saying something about, “I’ll expect the rest when you get paid,” 
he was not pleasant. But I also remember putting a dime in—I spent thirty cents on his 
jukebox to play Walk On By, Dionne Warwick. But anyway, so. 
EC: [Laughs] It’s like a theme here. 
JR: Yes, there is. That’s right. [Laughs] That’s right. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: So, what is your day-to-day work like in the office? What’s your job with 
Forman? 
JR: Okay. So. What’s interesting to me is that Forman had a way of giving 
you as much responsibility as he thought you could take and more than you thought you 
could take. I mean, there were times that he let me do things and I thought afterward, 
hmm, it’s amazing that he let me do this. But what happens is when I come in I get this 
bird’s eye view of the whole SNCC organization; the Friends of SNCC, the Campus 
Friends of SNCC, the field offices, the daily who’s in the field offices. 
Judy Richardson 
58 
Who’s responsible, who’s not responsible. I’m taking minutes from the exec 
committee meeting, so I know who’s in trouble. I get a real sense of the field and all of 
the operation and so I remember—. 
EC: Have we said what Forman’s job is? ( ) 
JR: Oh, I’m sorry, no, I may not. 
EC: I think you did. Well anyway, you said when you met him with Reggie—. 
JR: And he was the executive secretary. That’s right. So, Jim Forman, yeah, 
he’s the executive secretary. And he’s in an office, I’m right outside his office with, 
along with this teeny, tiny little area and Dinky Romilly is the Friends of SNCC and 
Campus Friends of SNCC and I’m, we’re back-to-back and I’m at this little, little desk 
and Forman’s office is over here and I think Shessie, Shesslonia Johnson who was the 
bookkeeper, poor Shessie; I mean, that was a thankless job. I mean, it is thankless 
anyway with a nonprofit, but we’re—it’s the field staff saying, “I don’t have to give you 
anything. I’m putting my life on the line.” Okay, so it’s all of that coming out. So, I’m 
sitting there and I have—I remember letters to Mike Standard, who was one of the lawyers 
in our pro bo—one of the many pro bono firms, Rabinowitz and Boudiné and we had this, 
I mean, we had this chatty relationship and part of it is all these people are making me 
feel that I really belong to this thing. 
I mean, this is like this family of people. And so, when I call Mike Standard, it’s 
not like Attorney Standard, it’s, “Hey, Mike, how you doing?” da-da-da-da and I had 
these things I sent something to him where, to him or somebody where I said, “And we 
could not do what we do.” And it was in fun. I mean and they knew, I knew they would 
get it. “We could not, we here in the South fighting for our freedom and our civil rights 
Judy Richardson 
59 
could not do what we do without you doing what you did there.” And it was the kind of 
thing that you send to a contributor. And “Freedom now,” and then I would sign 
Forman’s name and then he would always know I was the one because it was the typical 
steno thing. So, you would put Jim Forman, J.F. up, all upper case, initial caps and then 
colon and then lower case “jr” so I was the person who was typing it, but oftentimes Fm 
the one writing it, too. So, which was amazing. 
I mean, he’s given me this responsibility to write these letters, so Fm writing 
letters to the so and so, or to the so and so, or you know. And then sometimes Fm 
transcribing as well. [1:45:00] So. I remember transcribing a speech by, oh, d-d-d-d-d. 
EC: PrathiaHall. 
JR: Prathia Hall, thank you. Prathia Hall, who could, I mean, she could just 
lift you up. So, it’s on a reel-to-reel recorder, right, and I’m typing on this IBM Selectric 
II, which I love because—. Anyway and—she’s doing—it probably was not southwest 
Georgia, it was probably Selma, but Fm not sure now. And I swear to God, Fm typing 
on this typewriter and tears are just streaming down. Fm, it’s like, she’s so captured me. 
She just lifted up, you know, she just, she brought you to the place where you would go 
through hell to get your freedom. She [Laughs] would follow her anywhere. Somebody 
said to, about Prathia that even Dr. King once said, when both of them were at a mass 
meeting, that he did not want to fol—he did not like following Prathia, because [Laughs] 
it’s so—. 
EC: High praise. 
JR: High praise. Very high praise. And Prathia, you know, Prathia’s parents 
were Pentecostal or Evangelical, whatever. Ministers in a small black church in 
Judy Richardson 
60 
Philadelphia. So, she came out of that and then when she passed, she had just taken the 
Martin Luther King chair at Boston University. And, she was very religious. But she 
never let religion get in the way, so she, in Selma, really, well, she never cursed but, 
really points her finger at some of the SCLC people who say to the folks after Bloody 
Sunday. And there’s—and she talks about that in her Hands on the Freedom file section. 
She says, “I told the SCLC, Dr. King’s organization,” Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, they had, some of the field staff had said to the local people, “You can’t 
come on the demonstration unless you’re philosophically non-violent,” not just tactically, 
but philosophically non-violent. And in fact, you are not really in the movement unless 
you can do this and she said, “I had to really get on their case because,” she said, “that 
was like blackmail.” And she said, “And it wasn’t true and you don’t do that to people; 
you don’t use the movement in that way.” 
Now she was philosophically non-violent, but she understood that you separate 
that stuff. But no, I remember, so I’m sitting there in the national office just typing this 
stuff and the tears pouring down. And I would also transcribe, I would take the minutes 
for like exec committee meetings, executive committee meetings. We would bring the 
field staffln from Mississippi, southwest Georgia, Alabama, you know, Arkansas. I want 
to say it was quarterly, but I’m not sure. 
So, they would come in quarterly and we would always meet, normally we 
couldn’t meet, I don’t think, at our offices, because they were too small. The workroom, 
because that’s what I neglected to say, there was a workroom and so there’s all this other 
stuff going on and then you would go into the workroom. I’m going to just divert for a 
second. You would go the workroom and there would be where you would put together 
Judy Richardson 
61 
press releases and staple them and, because at that point the mimeograph machine didn’t 
have a collator so it wouldn’t automatically collate and staple. 
Later we get that, but right then, it’s pumping off the mimeograph machine and 
the stencil and we’re taking and Wilson Brown is taking it up so we have, it’s a—it’s a 
group of people and they’re in the workroom and you have all this stuff on the table—on 
the work table. And somebody would take it off and hand it to the second person; 
somebody’s stapling, somebody’s collating, stapling, putting it, folding it, putting it in the 
stuff, stamping it and so there’s a relay, it’s a thing. 
EC: An assembly line. 
JR: Assembly line, that’s the word I’m looking for. So, it’s an assembly line. 
So now we also have water bugs. And they were the flying water bugs that you get in the 
South. So, I say that just, oh, and also by the way, if you were on the assembly line you 
were always singing freedom songs, because the work really does go quicker if you sing 
something. And so, you know everybody’s singing and we’re working and we’re doing 
the stuff. Okay, now on exec committee meetings I would—but the workroom was not 
large enough, usually, to hold the staff. So, we would then, we could get sometimes 
[1:50:00] Paschal’s, although Paschal’s really was a black businessman and so he would 
charge us. 
So, we would go to Frasier’s, who really, he was so lovely. Frasier’s basement, 
we would go down and have our meetings there sometimes. And he would feed you if 
you didn’t have money, unlike Paschal. 
EC: Is that why Paschal’s in the Atlanta Airport now and Frasier’s not? 
Judy Richardson 
62 
JR: Well, that could be. That’s true. [Laughter] One made money and one, 
yeah. But Frasier’s was wonderful, they were just lovely and you would go to Paschal’s 
for the—they had the birdcage and so they would have, what’s his name and the Pips, and 
they would have all the R&B people come in. And sometimes you would get to meet 
them and they would be so excited to meet the SNCC kids and all that kind of stuff. But 
it was a birdcage. That was at Paschal’s. 
But anyway, so I would be taking, no, it’s in shorthand. Well, the first exec 
committee meeting I take, it’s thirty-three pages and it’s thirty-three pages because Fm in 
awe of all these SNCC people, right? They are—. 
EC: This is thirty-three pages typed or—? 
JR: Typed. 
EC: Thirty-three pages shorthand? 
JR: No, thirty-three pages typed. 
EC: So, after you took it in shorthand, then you would type it out longhand. 
JR: That’s right. I would take it in shorthand and then I would transcribe my 
notes. I would type it onto the long green stencils and, which was a problem because of 
course, the stencils you couldn’t correct except with this little green fluid. So, you had to 
take the film up, the screen up and then put the little green on and then wait for it to dry, 
[Laughter] put the film down and then hope that you hadn’t put too much of this green 
stuff on because if you did, then when you put, type over it, it would smudge it. And 
you’d get these smudgy letters all over the place. So. So, I was fairly accurate. 
That was the other thing. I could actually type ninety words a minute with pretty 
good accuracy. Anyway, so I had thirty-three pages of notes, of minutes, pages of 
Judy Richardson 
63 
minutes typed out and then I had to run them out. Now the problem was, I was there late 
at night, so I would sometimes be there, during this period that I’m getting these minutes 
out and again, I’m really in awe because these people know more than I had ever heard 
of. Not only do I never talk in staff meetings, but I’m also just in awe of all these people 
who, who are talking about organizing in ways that I never thought about. They’ve been 
through stuff I’ve never thought about. You’ve got, the Howard, the NAG people who 
are talking about, Nietzsche. You know, I mean it’s—[Laughs] 
Going through that. And also, Byron Weston and this other, but who have 
organizing techniques and then you’ve got the Southern young people who know black 
history in a way that I don’t know, so it’s all of this, all of this is combining to say you, 
shut up and take the minutes. [Laughter] Right? So, I’m taking the minutes, okay, get all 
these things. But I have, it takes about a week and I have it in my diary, still taking the 
minutes. I mean still, still typing the minutes, still typing the minutes. Now the meeting 
has since disbanded, right? And I think this was the one that we did at ITS, 
Interdenominational Theological Seminary, ITS, which was part of the, what becomes the 
Atlanta University System. Interdenominational Theological Seminary, okay? And so, 
okay, typing it up, I’m about to run it off and I’m by myself. So, I have to go by myself 
into the workroom. Now the workroom really does have these flying water bugs. 
They’re big. 
EC: Is that a cockroach? 
JR: It’s like cockroaches, but I thought they were water bugs. Maybe they 
were cockroach. They were flying cockroaches. 
EC: I mean, I don’t know if they might be the same thing. 
Judy Richardson 
64 
JR: Okay, but they flew. That was the main thing, it was operative. 
EC: Well, cockroaches fly. 
JR: Yes, that’s true, but that’s the main thing for me was that they flew. What 
they were, it was that they flew. And so they would be, you would come in and they’d be 
all on the floor. They’d be on the wall. And so, you would have to steel yourself for, I’m 
going to go in here; I’m going to run this off. I’m not going to pay any attention to these 
things. [Laughter] I’m just going to run this thing off. 
EC: Get ready to duck. [Laughs] 
JR: Yes, if you had to, that’s it. And you tried not to crunch anything. You 
see, that’s the other thing because, okay. So, doing that and then I finally got it and then I 
had to mail it to the various field offices and that was the other thing. And as a matter of 
fact, the day that I mailed it off, it’s—I have in my diary, “The sun is coming up. I have 
just finished doing the minutes,” and I say, “The birds are singing, it’s a wonderful day,” 
[Laughs] and so, I get that off to whoever was going to disseminate it in the field and 
stuff. And so, I would do that. [1:55:00] 
And then I would often [take] the minutes and other people would, too. But 
because I knew shorthand, you see, and typed so quickly, it was like, well, Judy can do 
this because she does this stuff. And then I would correct things because I’ve always 
been editing things and, I wouldn’t edit the thoughts and I don’t even think I would 
actually, back then I wouldn’t even edit anything else. It would just be whatever I heard. 
That’s true. Yeah. 
Judy Richardson 
65 
So, I wouldn’t try, for example, finish a sentence or do whatever, it was whatever 
they said got into it. Okay. So, I would do that. What else? I’d support anything else 
that was going on. Yeah. 
EC: So, talking about the minutes, at a certain point you and some of the other 
women have a little protest? 
JR: Yeah. 
EC: I mean, the way I understand it—. 
JR: Well, I’ll tell you, that’s right. So, what happened is—you see, I had been 
saying to Forman, “Forman, I want to go to the field, I want to go to the field,” okay, 
which meant I want to go into Mississippi and in my mind, it was Mississippi, because 
that’s where all the action was. I knew about Alabama, I knew about southwest Georgia, 
but most of what we, where I was getting information about was, because it was Bob and 
it was that whole Mississippi thing. 
EC: Mississippi, you mean Bob—. 
JR: Bob Moses. And that’s where it was. Okay, so I keep saying, “I want to 
go to the field,” and he was saying, “No, wasn’t going to happen,” I mean, he did not 
want to lose a good secretary, right? So, at one point I end up, oh, I know. He goes 
someplace and Dinky got me a ticket for the first Freedom Day in Hattiesburg, that’s 
right. So, January [in] Hattiesburg, it’s [19]64, Hattiesburg. I’m down there. And I 
come back, Forman was livid. But then at some point in here I get tired of taking the 
minutes. There were other women who got tired of the minutes, but also, they kind of I 
think, wanted to be in the field, too, but also it was like we get the secretarial stuff. 
Judy Richardson

Now aside from Jimmy—Jimmy Bolton, the guys—see the thing is, the field, the 
national office was where you put white people. Because white people really risked the 
lives of the local communities and other SNCCs, black SNCC’s staff people if they were 
working in Mississippi. Sherrod wanted an integrated staff in southwest Georgia, right, 
because he wanted to model what this thing could be. 
And philosophically, he absolutely believed that and he believed that it was based 
on his, his theological understanding of what was supposed to—so “beloved community” 
meant you did it in your project as well. Other folks were not playing that. And because 
it really did risk lives. So, what it meant though was that for white people who want to 
be involved, oftentimes, particularly white women, who could get black guys killed in the 
field, they were then in the office. So, Mary King’s in the office. Casey’s in Jackson, but 
she’s in Jackson. 
EC: Casey Hayden. 
JR: Casey Hayden is in Jackson. But mainly, you didn’t really have any white 
women in the field, except for southwest Georgia and so Dinky’s there, Nancy Steams is 
there. White women in the national office. 
EC: Mary King. 
JR: Mary King. Oh, I thought I mentioned her, yes, Mary King. 
EC: ( ) 
JR: Yeah, that’s right. And even for Mark Suckle, I mean, he’s not there. 
He’s doing some print stuff, too, later on. When Tamio Wakayama comes. Oh, and 
that’s the other part that’s part of the national office, is there’s a photo department. And 
so, Danny Lyon is there, and then Tamio Wakayama, who was Tom then, but as part of 
Judy Richardson 
67 
the nationalist thing, where people are really going back to their heritage, right? Tamio, 
then Tom, is Japanese Canadian, right? And so, he goes to Tamio. And so, that’s what 
he known now as, as a really premier photographer. Has had exhibits and wonderful 
photobook and stuff. Okay. He’s—he gets—he comes in through, he’s doing a book, and 
he says similar to Eldritch Cleaver’s Soul on Ice, he’s calling it, Tamio is calling his 
book, Soul on Rice. Yes. So, he’s doing this book, and he mentions how he talked at our 
SNNC fiftieth about how he—I don’t know whether you can use this or not. No, don’t 
worry about it. So anyway, he comes into SNCC through Birmingham, and he arrives in 
Birmingham the day that the [2:00:00] four little girls are killed. He cooks up, because 
there’s a black person in, where he lands who says, “Son, you really don’t need to be 
around here, you need to go to this hotel, and stay there. Because I don’t know what’s 
going to be happening.” He gets there, he finds Forman, and Danny Lyon, and Julian 
Bond. And Forman says, and they find out that he wants to join the movement. And so, 
they—Forman says, “Do you have a car?” And Tamio says, “Yeah I got a little Bug.” He 
said, “Fine, you can drive us down to the national office.” So, from Birmingham to 
Atlanta. 
Tamio says that, for the first week or so, Forman has him sweeping the floor. 
And finally, he gets—and for no money, by the way. Because he’s not even on staff at 
that point. Tamio says he looks at Forman, at some point, says to Forman, “You know, I 
really would like to do something else.” And so, Forman then puts him in, I don’t know 
whether Tamio already knew some stuff around photography, I don’t remember. In any 
event, he then goes into photos. And so then, he becomes part of the photo department. 
So, he’s down there as well, and how did I get off into photo department? 
Judy Richardson 
68 
EC: You were going to tell us about the minutes, the protests. 
JR: Oh yeah, so all these other people are doing, the guys are doing this other 
stuff, right? But none of the women, except for Mary King is working with Julian in 
communications. But generally, we’re not going in the field, we’re not doing other stuff. 
You know, and let me just say, I know why I shouldn’t be in the field. I’m from 
Tarrytown, New York. I don’t know anything about Southern mores, black or white. I 
don’t know this stuff. I’m not churched, it’s like please. But--. 
EC: But that didn’t stop you from wanting to. 
JR: You got it, that’s it. I still want to go to the field, because that’s where the 
action is. Okay. So—. 
EC: So much for being shy and scared. 
JR: Well, I did it in my own quiet way. So, [laughter] we decide, Forman has 
gone away, gone to—I don’t know if it was when he went to the UK, I don’t—see, he goes 
to the London for an anti-Apartheid meeting at some point. And that’s that whole 
connection that Forman brings around the South African anti-Apartheid stuff, as well as 
African liberation stuff, and Ghana, and Kenya, and all that stuff. So, I’m aware of all of 
that when I come into SNCC for the first time. But at some point, I know in my minute, 
in my diary, I have that I’m going to meet Forman, coming from an international anti- 
Apartheid meeting in London. And I’m going to meet him at the Atlanta airport, and 
how excited I am to hear about—I’m excited to think about what I’m going to hear from 
him. But I don’t know if that’s that time. Because he used to go away, he’d do 
fundraising meetings, he’d be at the Friends of SNCC stuff. 
Judy Richardson 
69 
In any event, he had gone away to some meeting. And, or fundraising party. And 
I don’t know how we get to this, Ruby Doris, Dinky, Mary King, and I, and it seemed to 
me there was a fifth person. Was somebody else there? 
EC: Well in the picture, Bobbi. 
JR: Oh, Bobbi Yancy. 
EC: And Mildred. 
JR: And Mildred and Bobbi Yancy. 
EC : And Dinky’s not in the picture. 
JR: Dinky’s not, you’re right, no, she wasn’t in that. And she wouldn’t have 
been with Mildred, as a matter of fact, now that I think about it. Okay. So, Mildred was 
Forman’s first wife. Okay. So, you’re right, it is Mildred, Mary King, Bobbi Yancy, and 
Ruby Doris, and I. And we made up little signs, little placards, that said no freedom, no 
minutes until something—what was it? Freedom comes—. 
EC: No work until justice comes to Atlanta office. 
JR: That’s it! That’s right. And freedom now, I mean, so we’re standing up 
there, and he comes back from whatever, he comes back into the office, and he sees us in 
my little area with—and we’re sitting on the floor with our little protest signs. And he is 
behind us, because clearly, I think it was Danny, I’m sure it was Danny, who takes this 
photo. So, it’s a staged photo, but it’s after Forman comes back, and sees us sitting, and— 
EC: In fact, because I think Forman’s in the back of the picture with a sign too. 
JR: That’s—oh, I don’t remember him having a sign. But he is, that’s why I 
was saying, he’s in the back, but I don’t remember him having a sign. But I’m not sure 
about that. 
Judy Richardson 
70 
EC: I’m not sure either. 
JR: Yeah, I don’t know that we would have let him have a sign. But I don’t 
know about that. And I actually have a copy of that, but so, we do that. Now, what’s 
interesting about that is that when Forman does the second edition of Making of a Black 
Revolutionary, in his second edition, he says that [2:05:00] his editor, and I can’t 
remember, she was a SNCC staff person, I can’t remember who. 
EC: Martinez? 
JR: No, not—white female, I can’t remember who it is. Yeah, I may or may 
not remember it. Anyway, says to him that he should do more on the women’s liberation 
movement. And so, he does a section. And in it, he says that, this woman says, you 
should talk about this, and talk about the sit-in in your office. And he says, in this intro, 
“So, I talked to the women in the office, and I”—and no, no! I’m—mm-mm. He said, 
“The women in the office came to me, and asked me what I—about how they could best 
do this, get—come to the attention of the men in the organization. And I suggested to 
them they do a sit-in in my office,” says Forman. And usually when I’m saying this, I 
actually have the book, because I read from it. And what he says is, “So I suggested they 
do a sit-in, and that they do placards, and that they do this sit-in, and it will come to the 
attention of the guys.” Okay, now he comes out with this next edition while I’m in 
Boston, working on the second—working, let’s see, that came out in the [19]80’s, I guess, 
mid-[19]80’s. So, I’m working, I think, on the first series of Eyes on the Prize, I think. 
And I’m reading this on the train. And I see this section, and I still have in my 
copy, “What?” And exclamation point, exclamation point, in blue highlighter. So, I get 
down there to the book party, and I wait until the end, and it’s just he and I at the end, and 
Judy Richardson 
71 
he’s signing my book, and I said, “Forman, what are you talking about, that you 
suggested the sit-in? You know that we’re the ones who did this.” He said, “Well that’s 
not what I remember.” [Laughter] It’s like, so what do you say behind that? You know? 
It’s like, now fast forward, we’re at the SNCC fortieth in Jackson, and was that—I think it 
was at Jackson, wasn’t it? 
EC: The fortieth was at Duke. 
JR: Duke, it was at Duke, we were at Duke, you’re right. And I’m on a panel 
with Ivanhoe, and Forman, and somebody else. And I’m sitting next to Forman. And 
Forman starts talking about this, and he looks over at me, and he says, “And I know that 
Judy has another interpretation of this.” And I said, “No, I have the facts.” I said, “But 
you’re telling the story now, so you get to go.” You know? It’s like, what? So, it was 
interesting, because at the same time that this is happening, I also felt the most powerful 
I’ve ever felt. I always felt that I had no limits. That people let me do—and it really was 
let me, because I had no real power in this, it was like they let me do stuff that, well like 
the Residential Freedom School, right? I come up with this idea after [19]64. Let’s do a 
residential freedom school. Now it means that it must have been—actually, it must have 
been sometime in [19]65. Because I had already been to Cordele southwest Georgia, and 
had been the staff person there, and so anyway, come back with this idea. We’ll get, and 
my thing was okay, we’ll get the energy of the southern kids, in the sense that you really 
can change things, and together with some of the young people who are associated with 
the Friends of SNCC offices. And so, we ended up going through Monroe Sharpe, who 
was head of the Chicago SNCC office then, and so we based it out of Chicago for the 
Northern end, and then we were going to go back to Cordele for the southern end. We 
Judy Richardson 
72 
were going to do three weeks in one place, and three weeks in the other. And the idea 
was that we would have a whole curriculum. And okay, I had this whole idea about what 
would happen. And the northern kids, the advantage of putting these together, is that you 
get the energy of the southern kids, and the northern kids’ reality of this is just up South. 
And there would be this kind of inter—you’d have this, there’s a word for that. 
EC: Interaction? 
JR: Interaction, yes. So, I come up with this idea, and I remember Ivanhoe 
saying to me, yeah, that’s interesting, he said, “Why don’t you put it down, let me see a 
draft of the proposal, maybe I can see if I can get it funded.” And he says the same thing 
also that Stokely says. Stokely says, “Yeah, let me know when you want me to come, 
[2:10:00] and I’ll come up.” Charlie says the same thing. Nobody says to me, you have 
never done this before in your life. What the hell do you think you’re thinking of? If I 
had been those other people, I would have said, no, no, no, no, mm-mm, we’re not giving 
this to you, you know? [Laughter] Nobody says this. Nobody ever said this to men or 
women. There was a sense that if it seemed like a halfway decent idea was part of the 
agenda of the organization, that, go for it. And so, Ivanhoe somehow got this funding. 
Because I know I didn’t. I knew how to write a proposal. And—or I knew, I must have 
seen proposals written, because I certainly didn’t know, coming off Swarthmore’s 
campus. So, I learned all this stuff in how you do this in SNCC. And I do this, but again, 
it was go for it. 
EC: And this is Ivanhoe Donaldson, and Charlie Cobb? 
JR: That’s right, and Stokely Carmichael, that’s right. So, yeah. It was this 
sense of being limitless within the agenda of the organization, the philosophy of the 
Judy Richardson 
73 
organization, that—and if you got people to support you. I mean you couldn’t just decide 
to do this. Clearly, there was some support that had come through somewhere, probably 
honchoed by Ivanhoe, that had allowed me to go ahead and move with this, yeah. 
[Camera turns off and on again]EC: So, I know that at a certain point, you’re in 
the Atlanta office, and you participate in a couple different sit-ins. 
JR: Oh yeah. 
EC: One’s at the Toddle House, and then there’s another one where you get 
arrested, and get some publicity? Or you just get some publicity. 
JR: See, I got arrested several times in Atlanta demonstrations, that’s the 
thing. So, I’m not sure which one was associated with arrests, but the one, if I remember 
correctly, and I’m pretty sure this one was right, the one at the Toddle House, the Toddle 
House was like a Shoney’s Big Boy in Atlanta, or Wendy’s. It was a restaurant chain 
like that, like IHOP. And so, we were trying to get them to integrate. Well, that 
particular day, Forman had found out that Oginga Odinga, who was at that point, I think 
foreign affairs officer from Kenya, may have had other things, but under I think Jomo 
Kenyatta. And so, this is newly independent Kenya, and so he’s this high-ranking 
diplomat, and he’s now in Atlanta. And Forman finds out, because Forman really kept 
aware, was very much aware of the international relations part, when it came to African 
affairs. So, he finds out Oginga Odinga is going to be staying at the Peachtree Manor, 
which had only a year before been integrated. Because it was that whole thing about 
Atlanta, the city too busy to hate, and it had become really embarrassing for the federal 
government in this Cold War time, for these newly African nations to send diplomats into 
the South, and they couldn’t eat at restaurants, right? Really bad publicity. Particularly 
Judy Richardson 
74 
because this was the time when Russia really was major, so major force, it’s the Cold 
War. This country wants these newly independent African countries to go onto the side 
of the United States, and not on the side of Russia. So, how the U.S. looked with all of 
this horrible segregation and stuff, was, it was a black eye. And of course, Russia was 
taking, as Vestía would put headlines when the Birmingham bombing, church bombing, 
everything. Okay. 
On top of which, the African diplomats are coming, driving down Route Forty, 
before there’s a Highway Ninety-five, and Route Forty was the direct line between New 
York City, their chanceries, and the embassies in Washington, DC. So, they would come 
down, they would not be able, once they left, really once they hit Delaware, they couldn’t 
really—and actually they couldn’t eat even in Chester, Pennsylvania, because Chester 
Pennsylvania was segregated, too. But, they get down, and they can’t stop anywhere. 
Right? So, the US is really, the federal government is not happy. And so, that whole line 
of, particularly Route forty, and then going into Atlanta, is not looking good. 
So, somehow, the Feds get the Peachtree Manor to integrate the year before. So, 
Oginga Odinga, [2:15:00] the foreign minister, whatever he is, of Kenya, stays there. 
Forman finds out, Forman—now the State Department would take foreign diplomats to 
SCLC, which was on the other side. They were on the Alban Avenue side. They would 
never bring them to us. Forman finds out though that Oginga Odinga is in town, he 
somehow makes contact with Oginga Odinga. It was also a time when the executive 
committee meeting was going on. So, people were coming in from the field, and we’re— 
we all go over. Okay? So, we go over to meet with him at the Peachtree Manor, and I 
remember we, this was one, I mean we’re talking old line, colonial hotel, you know? 
Judy Richardson 
75 
This is the place with white dowagers, you know? I mean this is, you can take this right 
out of, what is it? Oh, Miss—. 
EC: Gone With the Wind? 
JR: Gone With the Wind, yeah, I was about to do—“Oh Miss Scarlett, I don’t 
know nothing about birthing babies.” That was the other one that got me, but anyway, 
okay. So, it was that. And we go into this thing, and you could tell it was almost like, 
stop action with some of these white people. Because it’s—we’re talking not just well 
dressed black middle class from Atlanta, we’re talking overalls, we’re all in—the guys are 
in overalls, blue jean overalls, all the women are in our usual uniform, which is denim 
skirts, right? And sneakers, and probably we had our denim jackets on too, our little 
denim jackets. So, and a lot of us, you know? So, we’re coming into this prestigious 
Southern hotel. And Oginga Odinga comes down. Now for me, see, the only image I 
had of anybody African was in Tarzan movies. Right? So, I often, talking about for me, 
it was like I expected him to come down and say something like, “Ooga booga,” you 
know? He comes down, because you had nothing, when I’m growing up, there is nothing 
about Africa that says anything other than Maasai warriors, and they cannot speak 
English, and they’re ignorant. That’s all I know, coming out. It’s like basically the way 
they frame us, because of course it’s all related, hello. 
So, he comes down, he is in flowing robes, he is grandiose, he has this hat on, and 
of course he speaks four or five languages. Do I speak one? Yes. Hello. So, it’s like 
he’s doing all of this, and he sits down in the lobby with the rest of us. And we’re 
talking. And he’s talking to us about what’s happening in Kenya, and rural education. I 
remember this was a time when we had bumper stickers that said, “One man, one vote.” 
Judy Richardson 
76 
So of course, we had taken it from the African liberation struggle, and we show him that, 
and we’re talking about what we’re doing with freedom schools. And so, and we hadn’t 
done—it wasn’t [19]64, so we hadn’t done all of the freedom schools, but we had, the idea 
was already, we were talking about that. And—. 
EC: Were the Freedom Singers with you all? Are you all singing? 
JR: Chuck is. So, it must have been, I don’t remember in that thing whether— 
so no, yeah no, well I’ll get to the singing for a minute. Hold tight just a second. But, so 
he walks down, he sits down, and we’re seated on the couch, and we’re doing all this 
talking and stuff. And then, at some point, he says, “I have to get back, I have another 
appointment.” And Forman says, “Well, before you leave, let’s sing a freedom song.” 
So, we start singing something like, “Ain’t Going to Let Nobody Turn Me Around,” and 
he’s rather delighted, actually. But the, not the maitre’d, the guy who’s the bell, the head, 
what do you call it, the person at the hotel. 
EC: Bell captain? 
JR: Bell captain, yeah. But not the bell captain, he’s kind of the head honcho, 
the manager, we’ll say the manager, yeah. The manager comes over really in a tiff, 
because I could see the other white people, the white people in this are floored. I mean, 
they are, like this. And so—. 
EC: An invasion. 
JR: An invasion, that’s exactly what it was like. So, the manager comes over 
and says, “Fm sorry, you will have to leave.” Okay. So, we walk out, and then Forman 
says, “Well, since we’re here, let’s go down the street to the Toddle House and sit in.” 
So, we all go over there. We occupy the seats. And there’s this photo where—[2:20:00] 
Judy Richardson 
77 
that Danny Lyon takes of all of us. And one of the frames is of me sitting there with my- 
-because I always had a clipboard, so I could take the names of whoever was arrested, 
and stuff like that. And then, next to me is Chuck Neblett from the Freedom Singers. 
You’ve got Joyce Ladner, I think there’s the head of John Lewis, Ivanhoe was sitting by 
the window, evidently standing guard, I think we talked about this. And I think he 
probably was—to see what else was going on. I’m trying to remember if Julian was in 
there. But if you see some of the other frames from this shoot, from —. 
EC: You get different angles? 
JR: Well, I’m sorry. If you see different frames from it, from the same event, 
then you see also Stokely and Marion Barry, and Charlie Cobb, and I think somebody 
else. I’m trying to think, I’m thinking there were four people in one of the frames. And 
then you see one of the other booths, where you see somebody else in the frame. And so, 
there—at the same time that we’re seated at the counter, you also see some of the other 
people who were seated, because we’ve occupied basically the restaurant. So, and then at 
some point, they do come and arrest us, I’m pretty sure that’s the arrest. Now at one of 
these arrests, because there’s another one that’s Grady Memorial Hospital. And actually, 
Ithinkthat’s—no, it isn’t. Because, can I just—okay. There is—oh no. There’s another, 
there’s another—oh gosh, see now, I’m confusing the two of them. Because, I think 
actually in that demonstration—. 
EC: Toddle House? 
JR: Toddle House, I think in the Toddle House demonstration, that’s the one 
where we spent so much time, I think that’s the one, we spent so much time in jail, and, 
well so much for me, because I hadn’t been usually more than overnight. So, it’s not like 
Judy Richardson 
78 
six months, like a lot of other people. But I come out, and I’ve only been there five days. 
But it was over Christmas. And that was the one where they’d also put us in solitary, and 
so I’d been by myself, and they put us in the hole because we wouldn’t do something that 
they wanted us to do. So, the hole was a bare cell, and you were in there by yourself, and 
it was the hole because there was no bunk bed, and there was a toilet, but that was it. 
There was a toilet, and then the drain. And yeah, and no bunk beds. So, you slept on the 
floor. And then they opened the windows on us, and we were on a hunger strike, and the 
trustees, the black trustees would sometimes give us candy bars and stuff. But anyway, 
so I came out of that, and I came with all of the other people who were part, who had 
been jailed with me. 
And so, I remember coming into this church, and it was like, filled with freedom 
songs. I mean it was a black church with, I mean it was alive with song. And it was 
filled with parishioners, and community people, and it was just, and they’re singing, you 
know, whatever, “Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Set on Freedom” or whatever. 
And just singing, and harmonizing, I mean it was just the glorious, it was just so glorious. 
And I came in and was like, whoa! Because I’d gotten a little frightened. 
And actually, I should say about Annie Pearl being in the cell next door. But, I 
had been frightened in that way, because I was by myself. And other jailings, I had been 
with other people, other women, and stuff. But, that one I was by myself. And I really, 
that one also, that was the one where I—Annie Pearl Avery, who was fierce, Annie Pearl 
was from Birmingham. And it was like, [laughter] no—I mean you knew Annie Pearl 
carried. I mean, she, you had to tell her to leave her revolver at home, or at the office, if 
she was going to be on the picket line. Annie Pearl, but you also knew that if Annie Pearl 
Judy Richardson 
79 
had your back, nobody would touch you. Now, that might have only been in your mind 
that—because of course if there were cops and they were going to bludgeon her, they 
could have gotten—but in my mind, I thought if I’m with Annie Pearl, nothing can happen 
to me. So, I’m in the cell, in the hole, and she’s somewhere near me. And she—and it’s 
like two o’clock in the morning, right? And I hear Annie Pearl, and she’s whistling, and 
I’m wondering if I can do this, hmm, I’m going to try and do this and not look at you. 
[2:25:00] “You Made Me Leave My Happy Home,” and it’s—[whistles tune]. 
Now, I’m hearing her. It’s cold, they’ve opened the windows, and I hear her 
whistling this thing. And it’s like, they can’t touch me, you know? I go, I lay back down 
on this, the coat that I had, because even though I didn’t say anything to her, I didn’t say 
“Annie Pearl, I’m here,” it was like, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be fine. So, 
having had that experience, and now I’m coming into this church, it’s like what? It, the 
community thing is so important. It’s like you can’t move without community. And it’s 
not just the organizing that you’re doing. It’s whatever you build in your own 
organization, you’ve got to have community. It’s one of the things, like when I was 
mentioning it to the St. Louis people, I said, what got us over, we had petty stuff, I 
remember when I used to do lecturing on campuses, right? And young people, this was 
when Bush was about to drop the bombs for no reason, on Iraq. And I remember going 
to campuses, Minnesota, wherever I was. And I remember young people coming up to 
me, that just happened at Exeter too, as a matter of fact. And they said, “How did you get 
all those people? Because he said, I’m trying to get my classmates organized to protest 
this upcoming war, to stop, to make sure he doesn’t drop the bombs, and I can only get 
me, the only people in my meeting is my roommate, and somebody else, and myself, and 
Judy Richardson 
80 
that’s it.” So, my usual thing is first of all, if all the people who say they were in the 
movement were in the movement, we’d be free now. Hello. But the other thing is, you 
never, you don’t know what’s going to set it off. You don’t know, it could be a year from 
now, you don’t know what’s going to happen. When I was in Cordele, I didn’t know that 
the little bit of organizing I was going to do meant that a month later, they were going to 
protest the unfair jailing of somebody. You never knew what was going to happen. But, 
oh God, I’m trying to think why I got off on that though. Because there was something I 
said--. 
EC: You were going into community. 
JR: Oh, community. That’s right. However, you also knew that yeah, there 
were people you didn’t like in the organization. Somebody, and that’s what I was trying 
to tell this young person. I said, somebody might be going out with your boyfriend, and 
you found out about it, and you were pissed, but the bottom line was, they’re trying to kill 
you. So, you have got to make sure that you are tight enough that they can’t get through 
that. Yeah, this other stuff is going on. Yeah, you may not be happy with somebody. 
You might be pissed as hell with them. But bottom line is, you’ve got to get their back. 
You’ve got to have their back, and they’re going to have yours. And you know that. No 
matter how mad they might be at you about some personal little stuff. Because they’re 
trying to kill you. 
So that for me really, that culture, and that culture of purposefulness, I mean we 
were so—we really, I mean the fact that we had four day meetings, and we had those four 
day meetings because you had to come to consensus about any particular major action of 
the organization. And consensus meant that you argued forever about it, until the people 
Judy Richardson 
81 
who really opposed it either stopped opposing you, or at least said, “We do not agree with 
this, but we will abide by the decision of the majority.” And at that point it went to 
basically majority rule. But before that happened, you talked a blue streak to argue your 
position, and see if you could convince people. So, all of that is coming to make a 
culture. And then, you have all these local people who are amazing, I mean I knew 
strong people in Tarrytown, strong black people in Tarrytown, but the kind of stuff I’m 
seeing in local communities is like, where does this come from? It’s all this stuff that’s 
surrounding you, and then your fellow workers in the community are living with these 
local people, and it’s—there’s this culture that, yeah. 
EC: A lot of people think about the movement, and they think about getting 
arrested, right? That’s one of the big things. And you just talked about people being 
pissed off at each other, and irritated. You got in trouble a couple of times with getting— 
with demonstrations in Atlanta, didn’t you? 
JR: Yes! Thank you, oh thank you, yes. That’s what I started with, thank you. 
EC: [2:30:00] It seems to me that you told me that one time, Dinky was upset 
with you, because —. 
JR: Yes. That’s right. I got—that’s actually true. I got arrested, and it really 
was at a crucial time. I mean we were in the middle of something, in that the national 
office was supposed to be responsible for, and I was secretarial stuff. I was supposed to 
be typing something, or doing—getting something out. And I go ahead and get arrested, 
right? So I call in with my little dime from the jail phone, and Dinky was pissed, she 
said, why on Earth would you get arrested like that? You know what we have, and now, 
she apologized afterwards. She understood what it meant for her to be on the outside, 
Judy Richardson 
82 
that I had been on the inside for however, a day, two days, whatever, and that if she’s 
talking about, she’s mad at me. And, but for me it was like, I really didn’t need this. But 
sometimes it would come through. Because she is thinking about, I’m being left with all 
this work, and you decide—because they didn’t need me on this demonstration. They did 
not need me. They did need me in the office. But I chose, because it was—it was a 
demonstration, and I’m going to get arrested, [laughter] So. 
EC: I want to be in the field. 
JR: Yeah, I want to be in the field, and the closest I can get is this 
demonstration in Atlanta. That’s it. Now, another demonstration was in the New York 
Times, and it was like— I got a picture, a thing of this. And it’s like this extensive article 
that starts, and it goes on and on, and it starts with this. And the headline is, “Negros to 
Step Up Pressure in Atlanta.” And it’s January 1964. Well, it mentions that we are 
trying to integrate the Crystal hamburger stand in the heart of the city, it says. It says, “A 
youthful biracial group of men and women belonging to the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating Committee lined the sidewalk outside the restaurant this afternoon, after 
robed, hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan had jammed the counter in an apparent 
move to prevent a sit-in demonstration.” Okay. So, we go in, John gets put into a patrol 
wagon, Forman says, “On the ground.” And so, then it says, “Mr. Forman dropped to the 
sidewalk when the police sought to seize him, screaming, “Image of Atlanta! Great 
Atlanta! ’” Okay. “Then, Judy Richardson, Mr. Forman’s”—this is in the New York Times 
article, right? “Judy Richardson, Mr. Forman’s secretary and a Swarthmore College 
student from Tarrytown, New York”—now I saw an early version of this, and it said 
Judy Richardson 
83 
“Barrytown” but they corrected it to Tarrytown—“kicked a policeman in the stomach as 
he and four others struggled to put her in the wagon.” In the Times, right? 
EC: Five cops? 
JR: Five cops. So, this, and now I realize what this was, okay. So, this was 
one where I had seen John get—being manhandled in front of me. And they had two cops 
in front, or one cop in front had his feet, one cop had his back. So, they had him off the 
ground. And so, I got pissed, right? So, I’m—they have me up, but Fm struggling, 
because Fm trying to get to John, and it’s like, you don’t treat him this way. Okay, so 
Fm struggling. I will say, inadvertently, my toe landed in not actually the stomach, a 
little lower than this, a little lower than the stomach. And they get me into the paddy 
wagon, and I serve whatever, Fm in there a few days. I come out, and Forman calls me 
into the office, into his office, and he shows me this article. And he says, and he’s very 
serious, and he says, “Did you really kick the cop?” [laughter] And I said, and really, I 
really have no memory of this, okay? And he says, I said—yeah, now Fm frightened that 
I have done something horrible. And he says, “This does not look good for our 
fundraising.” It’s not that I have gone, I’ve done this thing, it’s that it does not look good 
for our fundraising. And he said, this is the New York Times. And truthfully, I don’t 
remember him saying that. It’s just because Fm looking at it. What he does say is, “This 
is not good for our fundraising.” And he said, “We can’t have this.” 
Now for me, now I had just gotten there in October, it is now January. Of the 
next year. And Fm thinking oh my God, what have I done? Because this is my beloved 
organization, I am in—I love these people, I love what we’re doing, it’s like, [2:35:00] for 
me to put this in jeopardy in any way, I just feel so bad. So, I remember walking out of 
Judy Richardson 
84 
the—I really assured him, I didn’t know, I didn’t know I was doing this. Okay. But I felt, 
I really did, I felt like I had let the organization down. Okay? Now, let us just fast 
forward. We’re working on Eyes on the Prize, Julian Bond was the narrator for the 
fourteen hours, our communications director, right? And so, at some point I remember 
over the phone, talking to him, and I said to him, “Julian, you remember when I kicked 
that cop?” [laughter] And I actually said the groin. And he doesn’t wait a beat, I mean 
Julian is so funny. So, Julian says, “Oh yeah, I remember that, and he talks like this 
now.” Okay. 
So, I say, because I’m really gullible, I said, “Oh my God Julian, you’re kidding!” 
[laughter] He said, “No, I’m kidding, I’m kidding.” He said, because Julian knew 
everybody too, right? So, he said “No, as a matter of fact, he’s now retired.” He knew 
who he was. He said he moved up, he became whatever, captain of the so and so. He 
said he often eats at Paschal’s, which they often did. White cop, but they’re all at 
Paschal’s. And he said, he recently retired. He even knew that he had however many 
grandkids. I mean it’s like, he knew all this stuff. So, in no way impaired the officer. 
EC: He survived your attack? 
JR: He survived, he—yes, intact. Intact, [laughter] 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: So, I know that at some point, you get your wish and you get into 
Mississippi as part of Freedom Summer, and SNCC moves the national office to 
Greenwood, Mississippi. What was it like for you to be in Greenwood? 
Judy Richardson 
85 
JR: I liked being in Greenwood. I liked—we had, the SNCC national office 
was in Greenwood, and then the Freedom Summer office was actually in Jackson. So, 
I’m in Greenwood. And so, doing some of the same stuff I did in Greenwood. 
EC: In Atlanta? 
JR: Oh, I’m sorry, in Atlanta, yeah. Still getting lots of reports, they would 
call into Jackson, but if Mary—since Margaret Block remembered calling me, that means 
she was also calling the Greenwood office twice a day. And then I remember, at some 
point Julian came down with his brother James, James Bond, in a VW Bug, because 
James taught me how to drive stick shift. And I almost stripped all his gears, in his VW 
Bug car. And, but James and Julian, at a certain point, they came through Mississippi. 
And see, what was great, and I know Dottie probably told you about the whole 
application process and stuff. But what was great about the application for the 
volunteers, when they came into Mississippi in [19]64 was that in this voluminous 
application, both the written and then the review process they had to go through. What 
was good about it was that among the many things we asked them was, what are the 
media outlets in your location? In your home town? And with that, that meant that we 
also could, if something happened to them, if you—happened to them, or happened in 
their area, that we could go back to whatever the local newspaper, and get back to them. 
Well what Julian and his brother James did was that they would go to certain 
locations, and they would do little, four or five minute stories, tape them, with the 
particular volunteer who was on site. And then, and it might not have been, because that 
seems too long to me, but little stories. And then they would send that tape back to the 
Judy Richardson 
86 
local outlet, media outlet, from that child, from that young person. And hoped that really 
encouraged the outlet to play it. 
Because the main thing was, how do you get the rest of the country to care about 
what’s going on, and the killings in Mississippi? And how do we get, basically black 
people registered to vote without getting them killed? So, with that as the main thing, 
then how do you make anybody in the rest of the country care about what’s going on? 
So, that was of course the point of Mississippi Freedom Summer, but it’s also the point of 
what James and Julian were doing, and Julian particularly, and so he would do this 
around the Delta. I don’t know how long he did this for, I don’t know how many stories 
he sent back. But he certainly, that was one of the ideas. Again, keeping the rest of the 
world, the rest of the country connected to what we were doing in Mississippi. And so, 
there was that, that was going in. And it was, we did get—I got, Dottie and I got shot at 
once. Although I refuse to believe it was that, I kept saying, “It’s a backfire!” [2:40:00] 
But she was right, they actually were shooting at us. 
EC: Want to tell us about that? 
JR: What I remember, truthfully, I now remember, I can’t remember whether I 
actually remember this, or that, because I’ve heard Dottie tell the story, I now remember 
Dottie’s. I mean it doesn’t, it’s—when she first told, when I first heard it from her, I got a 
feeling, I did have this memory, but it’s hard now for me to know whether it’s really my 
memory or her memory. But in any event, what happened is we were coming back from, 
we were walking back to the house that we shared in Greenwood, Mississippi, that 
summer. And until Bob, her then husband, Bob Zellner, came, I think they—he came 
back to Mississippi, whatever, then they stayed together. But at that point, she and I were 
Judy Richardson 
87 
staying together in this local house. And they were always poor—I mean it was amazing 
to me that these local people, whose home this was, I could go back to Tarrytown, right? 
These people lived here, you know? It was their whole community that they were putting 
in jeopardy. And they just did it anyway. And they knew a whole lot more than I did 
about the history of violence that came to the black community. 
So anyway, we’re staying in this local house, and we’re walking to it from having 
worked all day at the SNCC office. And at some point, there are these sounds. And so, 
Dottie says, “They’re shooting at us!” And we hit the ground. Now I don’t know 
whether I said hit the ground, or she said hit the ground, but we hit the ground. In my 
mind, I actually do remember hitting the ground and getting up. And then running to 
where we were staying and stuff. 
Now, so that was one. Then another time, and I hope Dottie told you about this, 
the McGhee brothers were these young kids who, brothers, who Mrs.—was it Laura 
McGhee? Yes, the mother, who was fierce. I mean this is another non-nonvioient 
person. Who was known to have kicked a cop, and gotten mad, and so, and was just this 
wonderful person in the community. 
EC: She kicked a cop too? 
JR: Yes. She kicked a cop, too. Yes. If I, I think she was in John’s—was that 
Mrs., or was that another person? I thought I saw that as part of her story, yeah. So, she- 
-okay, so— 
EC: Hersons? 
JR: Her sons. So, her sons had decided it was June, and so the Civil Rights 
Bill is now law. So, it’s a real act. And so, you’re not supposed to have any segregated 
Judy Richardson 
88 
seating or anything in public accommodations, including this movie house. So, the 
McGhee brothers decide that they’re going to go in and not sit in the crow’s nest, which 
was where black people often had to sit, or you had one day when you could sit as black 
people in a movie house. But, they decided they’re going to sit on the regular downstairs. 
And so, they sit, they’re coming out, and I don’t remember the first part of this, Dottie 
was involved in the first part, where the McGhee brothers come out, and they are, 
something happens, I can’t remember what happens the first time around. When I get to 
the story, it’s that somebody has tried to pick them up, it hasn’t worked, so now I’m 
sitting in the SNCC office, and June Johnson—I’m sorry, what happens is that they go in, 
they come out, a small white mob amasses outside the theater. And so, some stuff, we’re 
told that we need to rescue the McGhee brothers, and one attempt is made, but that is 
unsuccessful. So now, I’m in the SNCC office, and there’s now a second attempt to 
rescue them. June comes in, June Johnson, from—who at that point, probably was maybe, 
she was fifteen years old in [19]63, when she gets beaten at the Winona Mississippi jail 
with Mrs. Hamer, and Annell Ponder, and then Guyot. So, whatever she was—so this is 
now [19]64, so I guess she’s sixteen. And she comes running in, and I always had the 
keys to the SNCC Plymouth, the Sojourner fleet cars. So, I have the keys. And, which is 
the reason, by the way, I’d gotten James Bond to teach me how to drive stick shift, 
because I had this image that I was going to have to be in the SNCC car driving away 
from some mob, and I was going to be in a stick shift, and I wouldn’t know how to drive 
it. So, he had taught me. 
Okay, so now, June has run in, I have the keys, she says, “Judy, we’ve got to go to 
the hospital, [2:45:00] the segregated county hospital in Greenwood. The McGhee 
Judy Richardson 
89 
brothers have been taken there.” What had happened was that Silas McGhee had been 
seated in the car, in a car, and some—one of the white mob had thrown a rock through the 
window, and that glass had gotten all in his eyes. So, he had been taken to the hospital, 
and he’s now in the hospital, June has come, we go in the car. And so, I’m driving, and 
it’s nighttime. And I remember the car, there was a car that came up slowly, with a white 
couple, who give us this evil eye, and kind of track us, alongside us. And then somehow, 
either they pull up or they move behind us. And we’re very aware of the couple, I’m 
driving, but in my mind, I always kept in mind that people always said, don’t drive over 
the twenty-five miles per hour speed limit, because they will arrest you. So, I’m driving 
away, and then suddenly there’s what I say is a backfire. June says, “Judy, speed up. 
They’re shooting at us.” And I say, “No, no, no, June, that’s just a backfire.” [Laughter] 
And I drive, and I said, “We can’t exceed the speed limit.” Now I’m from Tarrytown, 
right? She’s from here. You would think I would believe her, that she knows whereof 
she speaks on this, right? 
EC: You would think, even self-preservation would kick in. 
JR: You would think! It did not. I continue driving twenty-five miles an hour. 
And so, we get to the hospital, and there’s a little small white mob. And they have some 
kind of brickbat, they have something that’s like, actually it probably was baseball bats, 
is what they were. And it’s a parking lot in front of the hospital, and there’s a picture 
window into the reception area. And so, I and June, and I think there might have been 
other—one or two other people in the car, we had to hightail it into the reception area. 
And I see what I remember as like, four white FBI agents, and they’re milling around in 
the reception area. So, I immediately do as I’d been taught to do. I take my dime, and I 
Judy Richardson 
90 
always brought dimes with me, so I put the dime in the phone, in the reception area, to 
call the Justice Department. First I call the SNCC office in Atlanta, and I don’t know if I 
talk to Forman, I might have. But I certainly talked to somebody. And then I 
immediately start calling John Dear’s office at the Justice Department. So, I’m doing 
that. And then suddenly, this —, 
EC: Do you try talking to the FBI right there? The ones that are right there? 
JR: Yeah, I’m sure I did in my mind I’m not thinking about that, because they 
never did anything. So, I’m trying to think, what—certainly they don’t engage me. But I 
don’t remember what I did with them. Except for a minute later. But at that point, I just 
remember them milling, yeah. And so, I mean there’s a reason why I’m now calling the 
Justice Department, I think, because obviously, the FBI under Hoover was doing 
diddlysquat. So, and I leave messages at the Justice Department office about what’s 
happening. And then at some point, the rock comes through the picture window. And 
we all scurry into the hallway, because there’s a wall off—the reception area’s here, the 
wall is there, and then we go behind the wall. And I come by, and I see they’re like the 
three monkeys. Except there are I think four of them. And they’re seated on the ground, 
like this, and all I could think of was see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. It was like 
they’re just there. So, I go off. As much as I knew about the fact that the FBI would do 
nothing in the face of this kind of violence, I said, “What are you doing? You know 
you’re the federal government,” I mean I go da-da-da. And of course, when I get 
excited, I talk more quickly. So, I’m sure on their end, they are seeing this lunatic 
woman, who was speaking like a turn up toy or something, a windup toy. Because I’m 
just going off, like why don’t you do something? You see these people, and he’s in the 
Judy Richardson 
91 
hospital, and, you know. So, they really do, it’s like they blank out. They make no 
response, and finally, I keep peeking around, and June reminded me of this, because ITl 
tell you the end of this. So, I keep peeking around, and finally I go back to the hall 
phone, and I put another dime—I finally start doing that again, and then, I find that 
somebody comes and rescues us. 
Now, let me just say, [2:50:00] I had told this story to the Eyes on the Prize 
production team, I had told it when I was on the circuit. It’s not until Mississippi Burning 
comes out in, what was that, mid-[19]90? 
EC: Eighty-eight. 
JR: Eighty-eight, [19]88. Okay, so this is I'iyes /’vro, okay. And Mississippi 
Burning comes out, and I had written an article about it for the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation, and how they had made the heroes, they had made the enemy the heroes, 
it was like Vichy France, and putting the Vichy government as the freedom fighters, and 
the resistance, you don’t do that. And I had argued this with the co-executive producer of 
Mississippi Burning at a Harvard Law School debate. Okay. So, I’ve been doing all this 
old stuff and local programs around Mississippi Burning. Okay. So, I get called, invited 
down to the NBC affiliate, WRC in DC. And we’re doing, because of course, a lot of 
SNCC people are in DC, and so I’m on this program, where they’re discussing 
Mississippi Burning. And I’m on it with June Johnson. And we’re in the green room 
before the program shoots. And I said, “Remember June, when the cops, and we were in 
the hotel and the McGhee brothers, and—.” 
EC: The hospital? 
Judy Richardson 
92 
JR: The hospital, I’m sorry, the hospital. And we’re in the hospital, and the 
McGhee brothers were there, and finally Forman and Ivanhoe and Stokely came and 
rescued us. [laughter] And she looks at me, she said, “No they didn’t.” And I said, 
“Yeah, you don’t remember it?” She said, “No, no, no they didn’t.” She said, “You 
remember you came around, finally, you started calling again,” she said, “on the hall 
phone, and you finally got through to somebody.” But then she said, “Forman evidently 
also got through,” and she said the person who rescued us, she didn’t say rescued, but the 
person who came for us was the sheriff. And I said, “The sheriff?” She said, “Yeah, it 
was sheriff whatever his name was.” And she said, “You said to them,” and it’s actually 
in my deposition, but I had not seen the deposition at that point, you gave me the 
deposition, so Fm reading what I said—okay. She says, “Yeah, you said in the deposition 
that it was the sheriff, and he came, and that you had demanded that he escort you to the— 
back to the SNCC office.” Because I said, what are you going to do about the mob here? 
And she said, and I think I also put it in my deposition, he refused to respond to me. But 
she also reminded me. So, I said oh my God, and I said to June, I said, I’ve been telling it 
wrong all this time. Okay. 
But then, I had second thoughts. So now, fast forward, Fm writing my piece, so 
it’s now early 2000s, Fm going into the final draft of my piece in the SNCC women’s 
anthology, Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC. And I 
want to fact check. So, I had forgotten, I remembered what June said, but in my mind, 
I’m thinking I wonder, I even called Ivanhoe. I said, “Ivanhoe, Fm doing the final thing 
on this, but Fm not sure, I think, that it was the sheriff.” He said, “Oh no, I can’t imagine 
it would be the sheriff.” He said—but now by that time, June has died. So, Fm thinking 
Judy Richardson 
93 
about okay, who else can I—and then, you sent me, or had given me already the 
deposition that I did at that point. And I’m looking at the deposition, and there I say, the 
sheriff came, and got us out of the hospital, and brought us back to the thing. But it was 
like all these checks, how your memory can play—which is why the documents are so 
important. But anyway, yeah. So, yeah. That was the other time we got shot at. 
EC: Wow. Okay. So, well we’re moving ahead a little bit—oh no, you were 
going to tell me something about your sister Carita, and—. 
JR: Oh, should I do that? 
EC: Yeah. 
JR: Oh, okay. No, just that my sister, the one who tried to convince me not to 
leave Swarthmore, she then gets put into the fundraising office in the New York office of 
SNCC, and she coordinates the Harry Belafonte concert. So actually, there is one story 
out of that I could tell you. This is in [19]64, it’s the summer, there are all kinds of things 
going on. And at that point, the three, those three particular civil rights workers, Chaney, 
Goodman, and Schwerner, were missing, we all knew they were dead, as we knew as 
soon as they were missing. And Belafonte was going to do, come down, and I think this 
was a time he was coming down with Poitier, Sidney Poitier, to do a concert. Now my 
sister had been coordinating the Belafonte concerts that he had given—he had given us 
five concerts on Long Island. And so, these, he was just giving of his time, his talents, to 
five different events on Long Island, as fundraisers for SNCC. [2:55:00] So, she had 
coordinated that out of the Atlanta office. Out of the New York office of SNCC. Now, 
she’s calling to say we were all getting ready for Belafonte’s arrival. And she says, she 
calls me, in the Green—. 
Judy Richardson 
94 
EC: In the Mississippi Delta. 
JR: In Mississippi, in Mississippi, in the Greenwood office, and I get her on 
the phone, she’s on the phone, and she says, “Judy, Belafonte is about to miss his plane,” 
and you’ll know how long ago this was, because it wasn’t LaGuardia, it was Idlewild. 
And so, she said, “He’s about to miss his plane at Idlewild, can you see if there’s, if you 
can hold the plane?” And either she said this, or I said, “Let me see if I can hold the 
plane.” Either way, I hang up with her. I actually call the airline, I said, “I’m calling 
from Greenwood, Mississippi, Harry Belafonte is about to come to us to do a fundraising, 
he’s late, can you hold the plane?” Okay. First I get the ticket counter, whatever. And 
they actually said, “Oh my God, let me put you”—they put me through to the tower. So 
everybody was focused, because the three are missing, right? So now, people are focused 
on Mississippi. They put me through to the tower, I get whoever’s in the tower, and I 
explain, “He’s on his way, if you can just hold the plane a little longer.” And the guy on 
the line says, “Oh my goodness,” he said, “let me see what I can do.” And he’s not 
playing. He’s not just, he really, he gets off, I can hear him, he comes back, and says, 
with true sorrow, “Em sorry, ma’am, we just can’t hold the plane. We just can’t.” And 
he, you could tell, he’s unhappy about this. I hang up with him, and I call back to my 
sister in New York. And now, I am somebody, just to preface this, who would get angry 
at FBI agents, right? Little Tarrytown person, Mr. Policeman is your friend, meet the 
hostility on the phone of these racist FBI agents, right? And get a—go from Mr. 
Policeman is your friend to you will listen to me. I could do that at nineteen. However, 
now my sister’s putting Harry Belafonte on the line. She turns the phone to him, I hear 
his dulcet tones, and I swear to God, I open my mouth, and nothing would come out. 
Judy Richardson 
95 
There was no tone, there were no words, and it was like watching myself in a movie. 
That this really does happen. Tm trying to say something, I hear Belafonte say to my 
sister, “Carita? There’s nobody on the line.” [Laughter] And finally, I get back, so then 
he hands the phone to her. 
EC: You can talk to her. 
JR: Yes! So, I say to her, I hear her say, “Judy?” And I said, “Oh my gosh, I 
couldn’t talk to him. I couldn’t talk to him.” And it’s like, she’s too through, she said, 
“Oh, all right. Well look, see if they have another plane, a later plane. Okay.” So, I 
hang up, and I call and see, there is no later plane. And I call her back, she never puts me 
back on with Belafonte, okay? And she says—. 
EC : F or good reason. 
JR: Yeah. And I say, okay, so no, there’s nothing, but this is the first plane in 
the morning. And so, we get that done, and I hang up. But it was like, how could I be so 
stupid? It’s like, [laughter] yeah. So anyway. 
EC: Star struck, not stupid. 
JR: Star struck. No, star struck, that’s true. 
EC: So, can you, I know that we’re skipping some things—. 
JR: That’s fine. 
EC: —that are important. But can you talk about SNCC and black power? 
JR: Yeah. By the time SNCC gets to black power, I have left the organization. 
So, I’ve gone through Julian’s campaign, I left out of Lowndes County, I’ve already done 
Cordele Southwest Georgia, I went in, in that first foray, off the Selma to Montgomery 
march, with Jim—with Stokely, with Stokely and Ruth Howard. And oh God, what—oh, 
Judy Richardson 
96 
it was Preacher, Preacher, I can’t remember what his real name was. But anyway, we 
were the first group going into Lowndes County, and Wilcox County. And building an 
all-black political party in Lowndes. 
EC: Did you go in with that intent? 
JR: Yeah. Yeah. And because it was different. We had seen what happened, 
I mean I had gone to Atlantic City, and so, we were really, I mean we were really 
sophisticated. It was amazing to me, I’m looking at nineteen, twenty year olds, and 
because it was Baker and Thelwell, and folks who were running Atlanta, I mean the DC 
office of the Challenge [3:00:00] and stuff. I remember having lists of the delegates from 
the delegations at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City that year, August 
of [19]64. And knowing whom I should talk to, and how we—what the approach was, 
what the line was. We knew who the sympathetic delegations were, we were just, as you 
know, trying to get it out of the credentials committee. That’s all we wanted, and to get it 
into the floor, as a debate. So, but what was amazing to me is that we were so politically- 
-so we knew all that stuff, and I’d gone through that, I had seen what the Democratic 
Party had done, so it made perfect sense to me that we were now building an all-black 
political party in Lowndes County. And it was being done as, it wasn’t just, it was 
groundwork. It was organizing the way that we always organized, SNCC always 
organized, grassroots community organizations. I did not know until Hasan’s book that 
there was this existing organization that had recently formed, that they, and who those 
people, those local people were. I knew about Mr. Hewlett, I knew about Johnny 
Jackson, I knew, oh, and the SNCC person, who in Eyes on the Prize says, ‘TT1 be clear 
Judy Richardson 
97 
with you, you know, we were just about to— we wanted to take his body back to, you 
know, in the casket.” Oh, who says—. 
EC: Orange? 
JR: Not James Orange, no. 
EC: No, no, no, it was—. 
JR: Yes, a SNCC person. I know, that’s all right, we’ll not get—so, there were 
other SNCC people in Lowndes County, but truthfully, what I most remember is that 
waking up in Wilcox County, and thinking I am in the most gorgeous place I’ve ever 
been in my life. It was the prettiest place, and I’m not a morning person. And so, what I 
remember also, and this is the northern thing. But no, it’s also, it’s specific. It’s specific 
to Judy. I’m waking up, and somebody comes in at about seven o’clock in the morning, 
the woman of the house, right? And it’s their land, I mean we’re on their land, because 
Wilcox and Lowndes had black landowners still. And so, we’re in their house, the house 
on their land, their farmhouse, and she comes in, and it’s about seven in the morning, and 
she says, “Oh, I just wanted to let you know, breakfast is ready,” and she said, “and we 
didn’t want to wake you up too early, so we let you sleep late.” This is seven in the 
morning! [laughter] So, it’s like I had to kind of adjust to a whole different thingamajig. 
But it was really, I loved it. I loved the organizing, I loved, in Greenwood, that 
was a little kind of town. This was rural. And it was just, I loved it. But then, Ivanhoe 
calls, I end up leaving Lowndes County, I got to work as the head of the office for Julian 
Bond’s first, what becomes successful first campaign for the Georgia House. The only 
staff person, too. But, the staff person. So then, after that, Julian goes, I become the 
Judy Richardson 
98 
temporary head of communications, only because he has told me exactly what to do, I’m 
doing pro forma stuff. 
EC: I didn’t know that. 
JR: Yeah. Mm-hmm. But it’s because he’s set everything up for me. And he 
goes off to take his seat. I become that before I leave. And then, I’ve gotten a full 
scholarship to Columbia, general studies, so I leave, and then do that. And then we’re 
doing, I remember Forman getting me into a demonstration in front of the South African 
embassy, I’m still in touch a lot with the SNCC people. And then I leave that, because it 
really was, it’s like, when veterans talk about coming back to the world, that’s what it 
was like. It was unreal. I mean, coming back to New York City, and what I was— 
anyway, and studies, and okay. So, I leave there after a year and a half, and I get a call 
from some SNCC people. Actually, Hayes. Curtis. 
EC: Curtis. 
JR: Curtis Hayes, Curtis Hayes calls me, and says that Charlie Cobb and 
Courtland Cox are doing this bookstore. And so, do I want to come down and 
administrate the parent organization? And I say yeah. So, I pack my mattress, put it on 
the car, Curtis and I drove down, this was, I had just come back from a one-month road 
trip through Mexico with Maria Varela, where her car kept breaking down, and da-da-da. 
But anyway, so now I’ve just come back, I’m now going to D.C., and they had named it 
Drum and Spear Bookstore. And it was drum for communications, through education 
and books, and spear for whatever else you need for the liberation of your people. Okay. 
So, [3:05:00] we had that Drum and Spear, and we had a big drum and spear as a sign 
above the door. And it was right in the middle of the black community. At Fourteenth, 
Judy Richardson 
99 
between Fairmont—Euclid and Fairmont. And when I first get there, the first day, I come 
to look at the store, it had just been tear gassed. That was the end of—and it was unusual, 
because by that time, most of the rebellions had been finished. I mean, that was April 
[19]68, now it’s June [19]68. But, everything was, you know, you could see burned out 
hulks of buildings and stuff. And—. 
EC: When you say most of the rebellions? 
JR: Oh, what they—riots, rebellions. What happens on the day of the 
assassination of Martin Luther King, on April 4, 1968, is that everything goes sky high in 
many cities. So, among those cities was Washington, D.C. And so, there were just 
wholescale burning of the black community, everywhere. And it took really up until 
now, I mean it took a good fifty years for money to move in, and gentrification to come, 
and all the black people to be evicted from their homes, and all that stuff. But, for a long 
time, there were just lots of burned out places. When I come in, because they have now, 
that day, they—the cops are tear gassing, something has gone on, on Fourteenth Street that 
day. So, I come in, and it’s tear gas everywhere. I could barely breath. When I go into 
this new store, which has nothing in it at this point, it’s full of tear gas smell. And so, 
then we have to—but our main office was around, on Eleventh Street, Eleventh and Ninth 
Street, African American Resources. AAR. And we’re above Bohemian Caverns, which 
was the jazz place. And—or were we? Anyway, so that’s what I do. And it becomes 
actually, the largest black bookstore in the country. Because at that point, all of these 
new black studies departments and programs, not departments, but programs, are—James 
Turner is ordering humongous numbers of books for Cornell. You’ve got Thelwell and 
Strickland up at UMass Amherst, humongous numbers of books. We’ve got San 
Judy Richardson 
100 
Francisco State, we are sending everywhere. Because at that time, there was not any 
central agency on the campus that they had to order through. So, they could just order 
from us. 
So, we’re sending all this stuff out, we’re doing displays at the black caucus of the 
so and so, ALA, the American Librarians Association. Or the so and so, all of these 
black caucus things. And our first manager was Tony Gittens, who had just been one of 
the two leaders with, I won’t remember her name, a female. Leaders of the takeover, 
student takeover at Howard University. Which was a five day thing. Just before we 
opened the bookstore. We opened the bookstore June of [19]68, they had done it that 
spring. And the takeover was around making Howard University a black university. And 
in fact, the reason it’s in the second series of Eyes on the Prize as a segment is because I 
proposed it. Because I said to Henry, and mainly Henry was the one you had to 
convince, so I said to Henry, you know, we’re talking about—. 
EC : Thi s i s Henry Hampton? 
JR: Henry Hampton, who was the founder and head of Blackside. And who 
was the initiator of Eyes one, the six hours of Eyes on the Prize one, and then the second 
eight hours, which starts in 1988. So, in 1988, we’re doing the second series of Eyes on 
the Prize, which starts with Malcolm X, and ends with the election of Howard 
Washington as the first black elected official from a major city. Between Hatcher and 
Washington. Anyway. So, wait, I’m sorry. So—, 
EC : Y ou were talking about the Howard takeover. 
JR: Okay, so the Howard takeover, I proposed as a story, because I said, 
sometimes we’re not trying to convince white people. Sometimes, trying to convince 
Judy Richardson 
101 
ourselves that we’re good enough, and that we’re trying to change ourselves. And at 
Howard, we’re not trying to say to white people let us have black studies, we’re saying to 
black people, let us have black studies. You couldn’t play jazz in the music room at 
Howard, the Capstone, because it was considered low music. Only classical. Right. 
Sterling Brown was there, who was amazing, and so all of the NAG people, the SNCC 
affiliate on Howard’s campus, loved Sterling. Because Sterling was imbuing the 
literature department with black poetry and not just Lawrence Dunbar, which everybody 
got. [3:10:00] But he would talk about DuBois, and you had Sterling. But generally, not 
a whole lot. And then one of the people I tried to get to talk to us, unsuccessfully, was a 
classics professor who enjoyed walking around Howard’s campus with his Yale 
baccalaureate robes. So, it was all of that. So, Howard University had this takeover. 
And it became a story. But, this—one of the two, oh I almost remembered her name. 
Anyway, Tony Gittens was the—oh, huh? 
EC: Robin? 
JR: No. She’s the first black—yes. But, remember that. So, Tony Gittens is 
the leader, one of the two leaders, of the takeover that had just happened that spring, 
we’re opening in June, Courtland and Charlie tap Tony to be the first manager of this 
new store, Drum and Spear Bookstore. Now, this was the time when Muhammad Ali had 
just been to campus, and one of the things the—well I won’t go through that. Anyway, 
one of the other things that happens during this, just before the takeover, is that they get 
the first homecoming queen with an afro. And we tell that story in Eyes on the Prize, too. 
And it’s Robin Gregory. And Robin and, yeah, it’s a wonderful story. 
Judy Richardson 
102 
But anyway, so Tony comes off, he’s the manager of the bookstore, and we really 
survive. And it’s—but it’s the diaspora. It’s the African diaspora. So, it’s not just 
African American literature and Langston Hughes, and Zora Neale Hurston, and that was 
my first contact with Zora Neale Hurston, and Their Eyes Are Watching God, and I’m 
giving it to every woman who comes to the store, right? And, but it was also black comic 
books, I developed a big children’s section. 
So, I’m going up to Bookazine, which was the big distributor in New York City, 
and we would drive up, usually Curtis and I would drive up, there was a black person 
who was, who knew all of the—he was the guy on the warehouse floor, he knew 
everything. Not just the black literature, but—all we wanted was that. He was so happy 
to see black folks who wanted some of this stuff, he knew where stuff was, we would 
send him an invoice and stuff. But even, he would say, “Well, you might be interested in 
this too.” We’re going through the Bookazine warehouse, finding all this stuff, it was 
great. But then, I don’t know why, I think because there’s always been that education 
thing with kids, and so it was like the residential freedom school, and da-da-da. And so, 
I said well, we need to really bulk up the children’s section. It became one of the best 
sellers within the bookstore. We had the best children’s book section. And I 
subsequently did a thing for Howard, their journal, Howard Journal of Negro Education, 
the Howard University academics—. 
EC: School of ed? 
JR: —academic journal, whatever their, was called the Chronicles of Negro 
Edu—no. Journal of Negro Education, that’s what it was. And I did a piece on racism in 
black kids’ books, because I was doing a study for their education school at Howard. 
Judy Richardson 
103 
And so, I made it into an article, and they did that. But that became my real focus, was 
the children’s section. And what was great is that there had been, the federal government 
had just recently come down with ESA. And it was whatever that federal law was, that if 
you, as a school system, wanted to continue to get federal funding for your schools, you 
had to have representative literature. Literature that represented the community that you 
were in. So, if you had, like a large Latina population, you had to have some Latina 
literature. So, we had all of that. We were bringing, and we were bringing the African 
writers series in. We even had Mao’s Red Book. We got written up in the Washington 
Post, because two FBI agents came in, and of course we knew they were FBI agents, 
because not too many white people came into Drum and Spear at that point. And they 
had those funny little shoes, and they had—but anyway, so we knew who they were. 
They got, I mean a load of our books. And then the next thing we knew, we were written 
up in the Washington Post, selling Communist literature, and revolutionary literature and 
stuff, [laughter] So. 
EC: If only. 
JR: If only, that’s right. But we had—well actually, wait. So, yeah. So, we 
had all of this, Caribbean writers series, we had the children’s books, we had magazines, 
we had—and then literature, [3:15:00] lots of literature. Because Charlie was a poet, 
Charlie Cobb was a poet. So, we had lots of stuff. You could come in there and we had 
one, Fletcher, Fletcher Robinson, who was a skin doctor—. 
EC: Dermatologist? 
JR: Dermatologist. And who would buy his Christmas presents from us. I 
mean, Fletcher came in for Christmas and was like, oh come, Fletcher, just buy—because 
Judy Richardson 
104 
he bought the big picture books and stuff. And then we were going to fairs. We would 
make more in a day sometimes at a black caucus fair, or oh, than we would in a week 
through the traffic, yeah. 
EC : Traffi c through the door. 
JR: And then Charlie Cobb’s aunt, his mother’s sister, was superintendent of 
English for the DC public schools. So, when we did our first children’s book with Eloise 
Greenfield, and I was the children’s editor of the press at that point. So, I moved over. 
We had a Drum and Spear Press, and we had three floors of a big brownstone. And I had 
gotten her piece, she had been rejected by a number—this was the first time she had been 
accepted. 
EC: Eloise Greenfield? 
JR: Eloise Greenfield, oh I thought I said her name. But anyway—. 
EC: You did, but then you talked about Charlie’s—. 
JR: Oh okay, fine. And so, Eloise Greenfield sent us a manuscript. And I 
loved it. And it was called—but, well, it was about a little boy who learns his first three 
words. And he sticks it down, he crumples the, puts, folds it really carefully, and puts it 
down in his sock. And so, he can’t wait until he tells his mother these first three words 
that he’s read. And so there are no illustrations, but it’s so cute, and so she—and so, he 
goes, and he gets his first three words and stuff. So, I read this, and I call her almost 
immediately, and it was at night. And I said, “I didn’t mean to call you so late, but I love 
your book. This is a—we want to publish this book, and it’s”—so we did. And it’s, I 
mean Eloise is now the foremost children’s book author. She’s gotten umpteen awards, 
Judy Richardson 
105 
and she has, I think, probably thirty-five titles now on major publishers. Da-da-da. 
Okay. 
[break in audio) 
JR: Charlotte, we get all of these school system people coming in. And I think 
we did it at her house, I can’t remember. But it was in DC and I had this bright idea, 
because it was called Bubbles, because one, we got this illustrator from—Topper Carew’s 
New Thing Art and Architecture Center. Because it was—there was a whole thing. It was 
the black bookstore was on one side. Then there was the Center for Black Education, 
which was across the street, that Charlie and Courtland taught in, as did Jeriva Gusto, and 
all these people. Then Jeriva Tate. But anyway. And it was—we had a clinic in there, in 
the Center for Black Education, there’s somebody in DC, Kojo Nnamdi, who now has a 
big time radio program. He learned his stuff at the Center for Black Education. We had 
this, a lot of stuff going on. And then down the street, we had aligned with us, was a 
cultural center and stuff. So, there were all these things going on. Then there was a 
graphics place. The New Thing Art and Architecture Center. So, we pulled this black 
illustrator who did the illustrations for Bubbles. And so, what I remember is this cute 
little boy, and he has his bubble, and the first three words and stuff. And it’s just too 
cute. 
Okay. So, we have this book party. Eloise comes, it’s, I think it is on Charlie’s 
house. But certainly, it’s at somebody aligned with Charlie. And it’s in one of the, you 
know, the row houses, and it’s original wooden floors. I have this great idea of doing a 
bubble machine, right? So, the bubbles come out, and they’re soapy. So, I swear to God, 
people are having to hold onto the walls in order to walk down these halls, because 
Judy Richardson 
106 
they’re slipping on these wooden floors with the bubble machine. Yes. But it was great, 
and Eloise was so pleased and stuff. And then, we did the Palestinian poetry book, oh 
God, I almost remembered the name of it. Something about the mask, I can’t remember, 
but it’s a Palestinian poetry book. 
EC: Do you have a sense—. 
JR: Oh! And Pan-Afiican Revolt, History of Pan-African Revolt, yes, mm- 
hmm. 
EC: Do you have a sense of how come so many SNCC people ended up in 
DC? 
JR: Well, because it really was Chocolate City at that point. I mean, and we 
had had an office there, there had been an office from the Challenge on. And then, you 
know, Marion and Betty Garman were working in trying to get, still, and still is, trying to 
get a vote for the District. And so, there was a lot of kind of things, but also, because it 
was so heavily black, and people knew it, and I think that was part of it. I mean folks had 
gone to Howard, they knew everything about DC. Charlie was born, well, I mean 
Charlie’s folks were here, [3:20:00] there were just a lot of things going on, I think. And 
Ivanhoe, there was the Institute for Policy Studies, where Ivanhoe was a fellow, and other 
people, there was—it became a nexus, I think, for I think a variety of reasons, yeah. And 
then it was the DC—the federal government was here. And so, you could have some 
impact in some ways. But mainly it was that it was Chocolate City, yeah. 
EC: So you talked already some about Eyes on the Prize and some of your 
work with the Committee for Racial Justice, the national council ( ) no. 
JR: United Church of Christ Commission of Racial Justice. 
Judy Richardson 
107 
EC: Commission for Racial Justice. But can you talk about sort of how the 
movement’s influenced you in some of the work you’ve done over the years? 
JR: See, I mean when I went to Swarthmore, I was going to be a social 
worker, okay? Which is good. You need them. But, one of the things that took me off 
was I found out, when I got to Columbia and still thought I was going to do that, that you 
had to take chemistry, because then you had to do all the sciences. But in addition, I now 
had this thing that I liked community. I liked the community I had in SNCC, and so, a lot 
of what SNCC taught me about what you were supposed to be about, and whom you 
were supposed to do it with, and the general politics, I mean the politics of stuff, I then 
have carried with me through the rest of my life. So, yeah, it’s at the bookstore, and then 
when I leave the bookstore, I work as the assistant and then the director of the Black 
Student Fund. And one of the founders of the bookstore, Anne Holloway, and Marvin 
Holloway, were part of that, but it was Anne Holloway who was the director of that. And 
she subsequently becomes staff director for the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, and all 
this other stuff, but at that point, she was director of the Black Student Fund. Which gave 
funding to black kids who wanted to go to any of the private, otherwise known as 
independent, schools in the Washington area. So, it’s Sidwell Friends, National 
Cathedral, and Georgetown Day. And Holton-Arms. And so, I then go into that. And 
then finally, got my degree, because I certainly didn’t get it at Columbia or at 
Swarthmore, and a SNCC person at Antioch, the Baltimore extension at that point, says 
to me, “Look, I am director of admissions now, if you want your degree, you need to 
come quick, because I don’t know how long I’m going to be here!” [laughter] So, I went 
through, and I did a lot, I had already done a lot of work around children’s literature. 
Judy Richardson 
108 
That’s right, so I write my paper on racism in black kids’ books. That’s what 
subsequently becomes the Journal of Negro Education article for Howard University. 
And so then, I’m trying to think. I get into film because Henry, while I was down 
there, knew a good friend of mine, Mimi Hayes, who had married Curtis Hayes, she was 
from Chicago. She was in broadcasting. She was the only black person I knew who had 
actually gone through Annenberg, the premier, one of the premier broadcasting schools. 
And so, she had gone through that, and I think she was actually the first black female to 
go through Annenberg. Anyway, she’s now working with us at Drum and Spear, she 
knew Henry Hampton, founder and head of Blackside. At that point, he was thinking of 
doing what was then going to be either a one or two-hour documentary on the movement. 
She puts me in touch with him, I’m still in DC, he asked me to do a chronology. And I 
think others may have been asked, too. But I do, and I found that in my papers, I did like 
a five page with all these citations and stuff like this. Okay. So, was somewhere in the 
mid, when did I move? I moved up in [19]80— Okay, I moved up to, yes. Somewhere in 
the [19]70s, mid-[19]70s, I do that for him, for Henry. Then I move with my new 
boyfriend to Boston. And so, I move with him, Henry says oh, good, because I’m just 
about to get money from Capital Cities Communications. He had put in a proposal to do 
this one or two-hour documentary, Henry had been himself on the Selma to Montgomery 
march. And so, and had, in that, had been there in the position of communications 
director for the Congregational Church. So, and there’s a photo of him, as a matter of 
fact there. And so, he had wanted to do something on this early movement. Basically, 
the modem Civil Rights Movement. 
Judy Richardson 
109 
So, he hears I’m coming up, that’s why he had done the chronology with me, 
hears I’m coming up, great. You can be the associate producer on this piece. “I’m about 
to get funding,” he says, “but it hasn’t come in. But, we’ll do something else,” I can be a 
receptionist. Okay. So then, and Cap Cities at that point [3:25:00] had been a funder, 
they had small stations, TV stations, and wanted to do more, quote, “minority 
programming.” So, this is one of their things. Henry submits a proposal, and he could 
really write a proposal. So, I come up, I stay, we start what becomes Eyes on the Prize. 
Except it’s not known as that then. Because Henry had this other wonderful title, which 
was, America, We Loved You Madly. And he loves the play on words, and it’s madly 
because we love you madly, because that’s what Duke Ellington, the big bandleader, used 
to say at the end of a concert, and he would throw his arms open and say, “I love you 
madly” to the audience, right? Henry loved the play on words of madly. I hated it. And 
so, from jump, I’m saying I hate it, okay? But I’m the only staff person for a while. For 
really six months. And I’m looking at all the research, da-da-da, I find Jo Ann Robinson, 
I do this, I do that. Then we get the staff in. And I, because Steve Payer, the writer, 
recently sent me a memo of my, of what I said about the title, it’s October [19]79, and I 
say, “Dear Cap Cities team, y’all know how much I hate the current working title. Below 
are freedom song titles, they’re in no order, peruse, you know, do whatever you want.” 
And I have this list. And number six was Keep Your Eyes on the Prize. Now up until 
broadcast, Steve Payer, the writer, said to me, he said, “Up until broadcast, I was telling 
Henry, ‘You picked the wrong title.’ They’ll never get it. They will never understand 
what this—they’ll make jokes about it, they’ll says ‘Eyes on de Prize.’” 
Judy Richardson 
110 
Okay, so anyway, I do that, then I continue on film. But then, I come back with 
my then boyfriend to New York. Don’t have a job, Charlie’s daddy, Charlie Cobb’s 
daddy was reverend, the Reverend Dr. Charles Cobb, head of the United Church of Christ 
Commission for Racial Justice. He founded it, he was the head of it for nineteen years. I 
come in first as a secretary, then I become director of information, and the first series, 
I’m going back and forth with Eyes on the Prize. Stay up for a few weeks, I’m writing 
the weekly commentary for the executive secretary. And then I’m going back and forth, 
the second series, I stay up. That starts in [19]86,1 think. And the idea is that I’ll go 
back after the two weeks, after the two years. After my stint on Eyes Two. We don’t 
know it’s going to be two years. But I’m still keeping up with things. I’m writing the 
commentary, I’m doing this, I’m doing that. And then, at a certain point I say no, I really 
have to stop this, but I will be coming back. 
But in the meantime, the United—the whole United Church of Christ, which had 
three whole floors at this big building in midtown Manhattan, at 31 and Madison, decides 
that they want to get away from midtown Manhattan. As a matter of fact, they want to 
get out of New York. Part of that has to do with the fact that Ben Chavis at that point, 
who is the new executive secretary, is pictured on the front page of the Daily News, 
stopping the subways, because around the police brutality, there’s real direct action going 
on. And so, there’s—we’re very involved in that, and there’s some more conservative 
churches within the UCC around the country who want to—who think if we can get the 
national church out of New York City, we’ll bring it back to more our politics. 
So, I know, while I’m up there, that it’ll either go to Cleveland, or Chicago, or I 
think they were thinking of somewhere in the South, I can’t remember, probably North 
Judy Richardson 
111 
Carolina, because they’re black. Anyway. I find out while I’m working on Eyes Two 
that they’ve decided on Cleveland. And I tell Ben, I’m not going to Cleveland. Henry 
wants me to stay, so I stay there. So, I stay with Eyes, I stay through Eyes, I become 
education director, people want—we get a grant to do PD, the professional development 
workshops for teachers. 
I start doing that, somebody calls and says they need somebody as part of their 
lecture series, Steve Payer says gives it to Judy. I, at that point am frightened of talking to 
more than three people in a staff meeting. But, I learned how to do it. Because I’m 
talking about the movement, so then I do all this stuff around the movement, and then I’m 
talking about Iraq, and then I’m talking about affirmative—but all this stuff, again because 
of the grounding I get in SNCC. I know nobody’s going to believe me when I say Iraq is 
a war of choice, but I’m going to show them a quote from the Wall Street Journal, and 
they’re saying it’s a war of choice. I’m going to show them an editorial [3:30:00] from 
the New York Times. I don’t use the Village Voice, I’m going to use paper of record, I’m 
going to use this. Of course, it wouldn’t work now, because Trump can say any stupidity, 
and it doesn’t matter that it’s not true. But then, it really actually made some difference 
that I could show real traditional media saying stuff. You know, I even quoted four-star 
Marine Corps Major Anthony Zinni, from the Washington Post, saying “What are they 
talking about? It didn’t happen from Iraq,” I mean so it’s all of that, right? But I learned 
that from the fact that I knew you were supposed to really have hard evidence when you 
said anything, right? 
So, I had been doing all this stuff, I decided I can’t do this anymore, but I always 
had stuff with me when I traveled to lecture and do all this stuff. So, I was doing 
Judy Richardson 
112 
sometimes three and four lectures a month through the lecture bureau. They love 
Pennsylvania, they love Minnesota, they love—so I was going—I even went out, oh yeah, 
it was hard. I went out to Alaska, and that was during, again, it became hard for me 
during the up—the move up to the Iraq War, and during that whole period, because I used 
to really enjoy it. Because I would talk about the movement, and who was really in the 
Montgomery bus boycott, and finding Jo Ann Rob—. 
(break in audio) 
JR: But with the Iraq stuff, I mean I was almost booed by 4,000 right-wing 
students at Pepperdine. So, it’s like, it was no longer fun. But I also knew you’re 
supposed to do that. So even at the NSA, National Security Administration, five layers of 
security, I ended up still talking about that. But I always had the goods. Because I 
learned it from SNCC and Minnis and stuff. Like, so. 
EC: Can you talk about what you’re doing now with the SNCC legacy project, 
and Duke? 
JR: Yes. 
EC: And maybe we can close on that? 
JR: Oh yes, please, yes. So, now we have—mainly because of Courtland Cox, 
who was Drum and Spear Bookstore, too. We have a SNCC legacy project, which has a 
few programs with Duke University. And it’s because there’s institutional will at Duke. 
When it comes to Wes, Naomi, and a number of people at Duke, Bill Chafe. And John 
Gartrell, I have to make sure I remember everybody. And that there is that will, so they 
wanted us there, and what we’re doing with them is a wonderful website called One 
Person, One Vote, and it’s onevotesncc.org. And that is a website which we’re now 
Judy Richardson 
113 
expanding on for the three years, and will have not only SNCC folk on it, but also like, 
local people. And people are doing interviews. Charlie Cobb’s doing interviews, we’re 
getting interviews from other sources, because of your stuff, we’re getting the Trinity 
SNCC papers. 
EC: What do you hope people will get out of this? 
JR: That first of all, we were young. We were their age, particularly young 
people, that we were their age, that we weren’t just talking about desegregating facilities, 
that we were talking about economic justice, that we were talking about the growing gap 
between rich and poor, even then. That we understood about grassroots organizing. We 
were organizing not the—even the middle group of black folks, we were organizing the 
lower group that did not have a voice. And so, it’s who we were organizing, why we 
were organizing them, and it was for systemic change. It wasn’t just so more black 
people could get the vote. It was, what is that vote? We had a thing that I think 
Courtland talked about, which was that the vote was necessary, but not sufficient. And 
so, that’s what you see all the way through this. So, there’s—the website is the ongoing 
program, we’re doing other programs at Duke, bringing SNCC people in as archivists, as 
visiting activists and stuff, and then we’re also, we just did a voting rights conference 
where we brought in young people from Black Lives Matter, the larger hashtag Black 
Lives Matter group, and oh, this wonderful child from Dream Defenders. United We 
Dream. Which is the group of young people who are immigrants and undocumented. 
And as well as the Dream Defenders out of Florida, everybody. Young people together 
with SNCC people, talking about what can we, SNCC people, learn from you. And then 
what can you young activists learn from what we were doing back then, and maybe 
Judy Richardson 
114 
adapt? Not always transferrable, but where it is, let’s talk about this, and how can we 
support you. 
For me, I’m not passing the baton. I always remember Amzie and Miss Hamer, 
they did not pass the baton. Their thing is, we will walk along with you, Miss Baker, and 
we all know Miss Baker, okay. Miss Baker, you never got a sense she was passing the 
baton. She was helping to guide us when we needed it. And so, for me, it’s like you 
know, use me where you can, and I’m doing some film stuff, like [3:35:00] Chloe 
Murray, we hope to get a doc. I’m still in film, but a lot more with the education pieces 
now. 
EC: So, what are, so do you have any kind of final thoughts on what you think 
is important about the movement? What you want people to know? 
JR: I think what the movement, I will talk personally. I think what the 
movement did for people, for people, not just the country, but for people, is it 
transformed them. It made them realize, they really could affect systemic change. Now, 
it wouldn’t be everything. And I keep remembering what like, Evie Nixon and them said 
about how you may never see the change that you’re working for, but if you do nothing, 
nothing changes for the better. It’s going—your grandchildren, and your grand- 
grandchildren, they’re all going to be sitting in the same doo-doo that we are now. So, if 
you don’t do anything, it stays that way. 
Part of it is that, but part of it is also what it does to you. I mean the fact that I’m 
coming out of Tarrytown New York, don’t know diddlysquat about anything, right? I 
come in, I see Gloria Richardson, I come in and I see young black people as part of 
SNCC, and white people, but for me, young black people my age and they’re changing 
Judy Richardson 
115 
the world as I know it. And it’s like, it changes everything for me. It changes what I 
think I can do myself. It’s not just what, how the country changes, because that’s major 
too. The fact that you’ve got all these—and you really want people to know the women’s 
rights stuff, the handicapped people’s rights, all these rights stuff, Gray Panthers, LGBT 
rights, all of that stuff, the impetus for that is helped by what we were doing in the local 
movements. The way we expand the Democratic Party, the reason you can look at the 
Republican Party now, and their conventions, and it’s all white, except if the camera 
finds one black person on the floor, the reason the Democratic Party is different is 
because we forced them to say that in the next, in the Church amendment, two 
conventions down, the Democratic Party now, the delegations now have to represent the 
districts that they come from, in terms of the ethnic makeup of those people, the class 
makeup of those people. So, you don’t—we did that. Mississippi people did that, SNCC 
did that. CORE did that. We changed fundamental stuff in this country. Didn’t mean 
that you got rid of some of the endemic stuff. Which is systemic racism, and systemic 
economic disparities. But we did a lot. And what I learned is that I could do a lot. That 
was major. Yeah. 
EC: Thank you. 
JR: Thank you.
