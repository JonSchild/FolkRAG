The Irish Emperors. 
'Written And sung with great success by FAVOR and SHIELDS, at Harry 
Miner's Theatre, 
here we are, a 
pair of Irish Emperors, 
From the Emerald Isle, across the raging sea : 
in a 
steamship we crossed the briny water, 
And sailed here to America. 
When we landed down at Castle Garden, 
There was no one there to take us by the hand ; 
But now sure we don't care a 
farthing, 
We're the happiest little Paddies in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Here we are, a 
pair of Irish Emperors, 
From the Emerald Isle, across the raging sea ; 
In a 
steamship we crossed the briny water, 
And sailed here to America. 
We sailed from the'town of Tipperary, 
In the land where the shamrocks grow ; 
Mighty soon we got up and dusted,' 
For we knew very well we had to go. 
We came here to get a 
situation, 
And you bet your life we got one mighty soon ; 
For they found that we could do almost anything, 
So tilt.y 
called us the Irish Cocoons. 
Here we are, & c, 
Written and sung with marked success by K ANE and FAVOR. 
Kind friends, your attention we ask for awhile, 
And we'll tell to you a 
story very true ; 
Sure we looked for work almost everywhere, 
We searched this city through and through, 
But at last we got a 
sinecure 
Over here in the gas-house, wheeling smoke ; 
They say that we are tart, 
Though we think we're very smart, 
Especially when we crack some dizzy joke. 
CHORUS. 
For we're so glad we will go mad, 
Sure we don't know what to do at all ; 
It is plain for you to see that we're as happy as can be, 
For we're going to run for Alderman — next fall. 
'When we sit down for to eat our meals 
You can bet that we sail into our hash ; 
With the girls we make free, 
We're their favorites, you see, 
Sure they say we're bang up on the mash. 
If we should get elected, 
We'll invite every one of you to call, 
We'll have corduroy stew, and mashed potatoes, too, 
And a 
ball down at Wallahalla 
For we're so glad, & c, 
The Irish Couple. 
Written and sung by the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, an 
couple, from the County of Kildare, 
And we ask your kind attention for awhile ; 
And before we go away you will be sure to say, 
There is not an Irish couple with our style. 
We landed in America in the year of ' 62, 
We're both very proud to let you know ; 
So just keep your eyes upon us, and you'll say that we have 
manners, 
And we'll show you what an Irish pair can do. 
CHORUS. 
From morning until night to sing and dance is our delight, 
We're both very proud to let you know ; 
And for singing and for dancing sure we think we have no 
peers, 
As we'll plainly show to you before we go. 
C. now we must be moving, or you'll think that we're in-
truding, 
(11) another step before we go 
And when we're gone away we know that you will say 
There was none so neat upon their heel and toe. 
We .re going to Kalamazoo, in the County of Tralu, 
We may never see your dear old faces more ; 
So now we bid adieu to every one of you, 
But it makes our poor old Irish hearts feel sore. 
From morning until night, & c. 
Summer Flowers. 
Sung with immense success at Harry Miner's by ED. FAVOR, of FAvolt 
and SHIELDS. 
See how fast from Heaven, mother, 
Falls the feathery flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below. 
Ere they melt I 
leave you, mother, 
Leave for ever this world of pain ; 
For something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flowers again. 
CHORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flowers again. 
How I 
loved alone to wander, 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field:, and meadows fair to gather 
Eright-lmed blossoms freshly blown. 
Soon beyond the rirrdling river, 
onwards o'cr the

Cather them for you again.

Pretty Kitty. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIRLDS. 
Oh, I 
come before you this evening, 
To sing to you for awhile, 
Of a 
lovely girl, a 
pretty pearl, 
I 
met down by the stile. 
She promised to meet me this evening, 
I 
wonder where she can be ; 
Pretty Kitty, darling Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Lee. 
CHORUS. 
She's as lovely as the rose, 
In summer time, while the moon doth shine; 
She's the sweetest flower that grows, 
She's all the world to me. 
Oh, if you listen for awhile, 
I'll try and sing to ye, 
Of my Kitty, pretty Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Lee. 
It was in the peaceful evening, 
'When all wps fair and bright, 
I 
met my darling little daisy, 
And my heart beat v. ith delight. 
Oh, she told me she would wed me, 
And how happy I 
will be, 
With my Kitty, pretty Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Lee. 
She's as lovely, & c. 
Oh, I 
have a 
pretty cottage, 
And in it both of us can dwell ; 
In a 
little nook, by a 
running brook, 
Down in a 
shady dell. 
In the still and silent evening 
I'll sing and dance with glee, 
With my Kitty, pretty Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Lee. 
She's as lovely, & c. 
The Solly Irishmen. 
Written originally by W ASH. FAVOR: 
v‘e are two jolly Irishmen, 
Fre. h 
from across the sea; 
eamship we took a 
trip, 
And sailed to America. 
When we landed at sweet Castle Garden, 
There was no one there to take us by the 
But now we don't care a 
farthing, 
We're as happy as there is in the land. 
CHORUS. 
We're as happy as can be, 
In America we intend to stay ; 
And we'll run for Aldermen 
When were solid with the gang. 
For we're two jolly Irishmen, 
Just from across the sea ; 
In a 
steamship we took a 
trip, 
And sailed to America. 
We were working for the city, 
On the Boulevard, laying pipe, 
And a 
dollar a 
day, that was our pay, 
But now we're on a 
strike. 
And we'll work no more for the city, 
Not for a 
dollar a 
day at all ; 
But we both will open a 
gin mill, 
And run for Alderman next fall. 
The Beaute. 
Originally sung by the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS, at the 
Theatre Comique Providence. 
Your attention now we ask for a 
couple of years, 
To a 
story we will relate, 
It's about a 
purty Irish girl we met while we was walking, 
She was hanging on a 
slaughter-house gate. 
She was as purty and as sweet a.; a 
cow, 
Such clothes you never did 
hand, 
She had a 
darling little bonnet with a 
poodle dog upon it, 
She's the Irish girl that winked at me. 
We're as happy, &c, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute, 
Tra la le, skip the gutter, the baby's got a 
tooth ; 
Wrestling pots, that v.-a.; her du!v, 
And her sister was a 
b9arding-house cook. 
My name is Patsey Marley, and the daisies call 
inc 
Charley, 
I'm 
double-breasted acrobatic 'Mick; 
My name is Patsey Marley, and the daisies call 
inc 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-br...asted acrobatic Mick. 
The other day v,e thought we'd take a 
little walk, 
For to try and see the daisy ; 
While walking down the street, by chance we her did 
meet, 
With a 
man about six foot eight. 
Says I : " Excuse me, my dear, 
But isn't your name Arabella?" 
She hit me such a 
poke that my neck she nearly broke, 
And she knocked me head and heels in a 
cellar. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute. & c.

Major Magoozimn. 
Written by WA:i14. FAVOR for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and StnEmps. 
We are two gallant soldier boys 
That you very seldom meet ; 
And though we never refuse a 
drink, 
We were never known to treat. 
We work the lunch routes every day, 
And get taffy on a 
stick, 
From the fellows that's fly, they give us the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major .'.', IagoozIum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight ; 
They call us two guagers, bc judge and the Major, 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
'Told us it was a 
sin ; 
We never do fight, if ever we're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from titt(ler our coats, 
And drain the kegs Lr beer ; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear.

The Lackawanna Spooners. 
Driginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the " I
rish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
STOLEN BY EVERYBODY. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us ; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden ; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop ; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, &c., 
The Bummers' Hotel. 
Written by WAsH. FAVOR for the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
We're the two Murphy Brothers, and just from Gillore, 
We sailed to America from Erin's green shore ; 
We have here a 
ditty we warble so 
It's about all our boarders in the Bummers' Hotel. 
CHORUS. 
It's two cents for coffee, and three cents for bread, 
And four cents for corned beef, and five for a 
bed ; 
We form into line at the sound of a 
bell, 
And sail into our hash in the Bummers' Hotel. 
Oh, there's our new boarder, he's a 
very tough man, 
lie has a 
regular route where he carries a 
can ; 
He drains all the beer kegs, and slugs it as well, 
And comes home boiling drunk to the Bummers' IIotel. 
It's two cents for coffee, & c. 
Now, there's Kitty Riely, who always is lush, 
She's cook in the house, and she deals out our mush ; 
She has a 
nose like a 
beet, and she's cock-eyed as well, 
And she's mashed on his Nibbs in the Bummers' Hotel. 
It's two cents for coffee, & c. 
We're Going Home. 
Written and sung with marked success by the" Irish Emperors," FAvox 
and SHIELDS. 
We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grow, 
Way over across the ocean, 
In the County of Sligo. 
We left our wives, God bless them, 
Which made our hearts feel sore, 
But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more. 
CHORUS. 
We're going home, 
We're going home, 
For now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home again. 
[Repeat Chorus 
Oh, take us back to Ireland, 
Where we were bred and born, 
Way out among the shamrocks, 
So early in the morn. 
We think we see the dear ones 
Coming down the lane ; 
When we get back to Erin's Isle, 
We'll never roam again. 
We're going home, &c,

And what I'm going to relate 
It happens to me almost daily, 
In this unfortunate unlucky State. 
have a 
large family of children, 
And they never wore shoe nor a 
sock, 
But they all kick up the very divel 
With the neighbors that's on the same block. 
There's Cornelius, the youngest of eleven, 
He's a 
twin to his big brother Gile 
That's left him and went off to heaven, 
To spend six years up on the Isle. 
And Patsy, the Bum, as they call him, 
Was haulcd in for picking a 
lock, 
And Mickey got licked like the divel 
By the neighbors that live on the block. 
Now there's Polly, my only daughter, 
Who's just turned twelve years of age, 
She's skipping and dancing the trala lu, 
The same as they do on the stage. 
But the rest of the boys have me crazy, 
For on every one's door they do knock ; 
And I'm sure they'll be sent to the Island 
By the neighbors that's on the same block. 
A 
Parody on " Baby Mo." 
Written expressly for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
by BILLY ROBINSON. 
Oh, my wife she is a 
slugger, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Like a 
trotting horse we rub her, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Oh, she hit me with a 
brick, 
But my head it was too thick, 
So you see I 
broke the brick, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
But I'll hit her and knock her sick, baby mine. 
Oh, the babies on our block, 
How they bawl, how they squall 
For thelr fathers and their mothers 
At the Skidmore's fancy ball. 
I'll meet you in the hall-way door, 
Something I 
never done before, 
But the villain still pursued her, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Get thee gone, get thee gone, baby mine. 
She has chin whiskeys on her nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Oh heavens ! how it grows, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
She wa3 a 
pastry cook, 
Her mother and me she shook 
For 13 dance in the Black Crook,

Forty ('. ollars from me she took, baby mine. 
A RECITATION . 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
As I 
walked down the st
reet, Ly chance I 
did meet 
A man who was riding a 
donkey, 
On his back was a 
card offering a 
reward, 
Which sed that he'd lo:t his monkey. 
Then the crowd, don't you see, gathered round him and me, 
And the street then it couldn't be crossed ; 
He pulled out a 
big key, and pointed at me, 
And sez " There's the monkey that's lost." 
I 
sez " Get out you old lump, sure you're off of your chump, 
And look out, for I 
give you fair warning." 
to I 
up wid me stick, and I 
kit Lim a 
lick, 
I 
sez " I 
landed in town this morning ;" 
He threw a 
rope on the fly, and rie neck he did tie ; 
Tho end to the gang then 7:e to::;eJ. 
Then he se.: in a 
rage, " haul bi:n into the cage, 
For he is the monkey that's lost. 
So they pulled me along, yes, forty-five strong, 
Till they got me to the door of the jug. 
P. 'F. Barnum sez " Punk, sure you have the wrong monk " 
As soon as he looked at me mug. 
But he sez " I'll engage you to sit in a 
cage, 
And say fifty thousand you cost." 
I 
sez " Get out you old bum, Mr. P. T. Barnum, 
I'm not the poor monkey you lost." 
What Do You Say? 
Originally sung with immense success at the Grand Central Theatre, 
Troy, N. 
V., by the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Our name is Fillemaclink Magooze Maginnis, 
We're two hunkey-dory little Irishmen ; 
If you listen to us for about three minutes, 
We'll very quickly tell you who we am. 
Our uncle's name is Misther Peter Cooper, 
We're two brothers to Muldoon the solid man ; 
We used to go to school with Samuel Tilden, 
That's the kind of two hairpins we am. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh my ! (Symph.) What do you say ? (Symph.) 
Bcssy Turner will never be my bride. 
We was a 
witness in the Beecher- Tilton scandal, 
That's the reason that we never tell a 
lie. 
Our sister's name i:, Doctor Mary Walker, 
'We have a 
cousin by the name of Nancy Pat ; 
She is a 
wet nurse in a 
private family, 
Taking care of a 
sick Fhornal> cat. 
Oh! we used to sing and dance in 011ey Geoghan's, 
That's where we used to skip the tra la la lou.

As sung by TONY PASTOR, with :great success, throughout the United 
States, 
There's many maxims in this world, 
And practice makes them true ; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new; 
Man may be likened to a 
boat, 
Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam. 
Then keep the fires a 
burning, boys, 
You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
If the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and dream, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
Makes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
Where all is dark at night. 
YOU'LL NEVER RUN THE ENGINE UNLESS YOU 
HAVE THE STEAM. 
Continued, 
His wife lies dying on the straw, 
For bread his children scream, 
'Tis hard to run lire's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main •, 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen ; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then keep the tires, &c. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land, 
But soon found out ' twould never fit 
That brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam. 
Then keep the fires, &o. 
Rules and Regulations for Bummers, 
By HON. TOMMY DE TANGLEFOOT W HISKEY, X. 
G. ( Bull Driver), 
President of the Bummers' Aid society. 
No Bummer must eat more than one hot meal a 
day—and 
that to consist of crackers and pepper sauce. 
No Bummer shall abuse his fellow-bummers, or cast insinu-
ations upon their character, by hinting that they can't drink 
much. 
No Bummer vill refuse to drink when asked at any time, 
unless he receives a 
wink from the barman, denoting the be-
verage to be fourth-proof camphine, which is liable to affect 
the breath. 
No Bummer will be allowed to sit around the stove over 
fifteen minutes without drinking. 
The meetings of the Bummers are held nightly. 
Any Bum-
mer absenting himself will be fined a 
dozen drinks of " tangle-
foot whisky." 
No Bummer must get too drunk to think every round, 
under forfeiture of his next morning's " eye-opener." 
No Bummer must leave the house until it is closed for the 
night. 
Any Bummer caught drinking alone will forfeit his next 
night's privileges, and be compelled to drink nothing but 
water for twelve hours and a 
half. 
No Bummer must take over " three fingers " deep at a 
drink. 
No Bummer \VW 1 permitted to say any thing derogatory 
to the character and high standing of his fellow- bummers. 
[Note.—This rule will in all cases be rigidly enforced, as 
nothing will be allowed to affect the respectability of our su-
blime organization.] 
All played- out and indigent Bummers, having become un-
able to " stand up to the rack," will immediately proceed to 
the nearest cemetery and resign. 
No Bummer must so far forget his honorable position in 
the community as to ask the presldent to treat.

See the wenches, now they shake 
To see who'll take that big pound cake. 
There is Jasper Green and Liza Snow, 
Pompey Moore and old aunt Chloe, 
Misses Pink and Misses Brown 
With Dandy Coons are coming down. 
Oh, how them niggers they will roar 
When they see us take the floor,

Wc ,n7 bound ..or to take that big pound cake. 
ilay the music, &c. 
Written by M. J. ENNIS and sung by BONIFACE and ENNIS, the funny 
Irish Comedians. 
Our name it is McCarty, we are six months in this country ; 
When we reached New York there was great talk of O'Leary, 
the walking man, 
And as soon as ever we did land our friends they took us by 
the hand, 
And they said they'd back us while we could stand to walk 
the great O'Leary. 
They put us into training then, and off our backs rubbed all 
the skin, 
They made us run, walk, jump and swim, till our hearts were 
sick and sore ; 
Those training days we'll never forget, for they are fresh in 
our memory yet, 
For our undershirts were soaking wet the day we walked 
O'Leary. 
The day arrived—we went on the track, but O'Leary left us 
far behind, 
And then our friends began to growl and ask if we were blind, 
They told us that we sold the race, and that it was a 
great 
disgrace, 
And they nearly ate of us the face when we didn't beat 
O'Leary. 
Our defeat was all the talk, so we challenged him again to 
walk, 
We made up our minds we'd make no balk, but beat bins sure 
this time ; 
Six days we stayed upon the track, to do our best we were 
bound to try, 
'flut they made us sin!!,- Cie " Sweet By and By " when we 
couldn't beat O'Leary. 
Of the gate-money we expected half, but O'Leary he gave us 
a 
laugh, 
And he said we had the cheek of a 
big giraffe to expect any-
thing like that. 
And our backers told us to take a 
rest, and for to take a 
trip 
out WeA, 
To wipe off our chin ; and pull down our vest, and never walk 
O'Leary.

My Darling Sarah Aim 
Published by permission of Gito. MomNEux, Brooklyn. 
I've got the sweetest charmer that ever you chanc'd to know, 
She's just my style and fancy, and plays on the piano; 
Her voice it is soprano, her brother his name is Dan, 
She's very high ton'd, I 
assure you, is my darling Sarah Ann. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, 
My peach, and my currant jam ; 
My lolly pop, my gum- drop, 
My darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's the sweetest dancer that ever a 
toe could shake, 
You ought to see her features when tackling a 
sirloin steak; 
Her French is most exquisite, ' twould puzzle a 
real French-
man, 
She talks like a 
big dictionary, does my darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, &c. 
She wears a 
train and flounces, a 
hat with a 
feather, too ; 
There's nothing mean about her—she wears an eleven shoe. 
I

stew in a 
little can ; 
She calls me her duckie and dearie, does my darling Sarah Ann. 
Oh, she's my oyster patty, &c. 
Her eyes they look so charming, with such a 
decided squint, 
Her father's very wealthy, I

mint. 
Whenever I 
try to kiss her, she always cries out, `
I Go an ;" 
I've popped ! and I'm going to be married to my darling 
Sarah Ann.

MALONY'S WIDDY. 
Written by E. D. Goonmt for JOHNNY QUEEN, and done by him 
in SAM NORMAN 's sketch, "Are You Working?" 
No doubt you've all heard about apples and pears, 
My father sold charcoal and things ; 
But while I 
am here you can banish dull care, 
And mind the poor widdy that sings. 
Once happy as any, and the times they were many, 
When all the boys came to court me; 
But sorry a 
one now has a 
nod or a 
bow 
For poor old Molony's widdy. 
CHORUS. 
Yet I'll sing and dance for ye; 
P11 do, to please ye, whate'er ye bid me. 
Now I've a 
chance, ye see, 
has any a 
job for Afalony's widdy ? 
[Sym., 
[Sym.1 
Sure, I 
married a 
builder a 
few years ago. 
And a 
very fine man, sure, he was; 
But for all that he died, I 
would have you to know, 
If you list I 
will tell you the cause. 
One day he did think that he'd just take a 
drink, 
To nerve himself up, don't you see ; 
To think makes me sadder, for he fell down the ladder 
And left poor Malony's widdy. 
Yet I'll sing and dance, etc. 
Now I'm looking around me to marry once more, 
I 
can wash, I 
can iron or scrub ; 
Is there any one can this poor widdy adore? 
I'll give yez no end of good grub. 
If I 
can't get a 
match, sure the first man I 
catch 
I 
will ask him right out to wed me! 
But by the old sod he shan't carry a 
hod 
And lave me another widdy. 
If ye want to write to me { Slim] 
I'll tell ye my first name, and that is Biddy; 
Now take the last sight of me, { Synil 
And say a 
kind word for Malony's widdy.

MY MARY ANN. 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS. As sung by him with great 
success. at Harrigan & Hart's, Theatre Comique. 
EvE got a 
sweet- heart, she looks like a 
queen, 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen, 
She sings " Eilleen Allanna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney" 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy, 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperary, 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy, 
She's never contrary, my own Mary Ann. 
took lovely Mary one niglit to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to \Valhalla Hall; 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them all, 
But get her to dance, faith I 
7,ouldn't at all. 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you waltz the next quadrille? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoo, 
And in two minute's time she had the ball to herself. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, some man sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
lie shouted out fire, and she flew straight along. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought she was gone; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for supper, 
She sat down to the table, and done it up brown, 
The fruit that she eat was onions and garlic; 
The perfume from her breath would knock a 
man down. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
MARY ANN HASLETT. 
AIR.—Dark-eyed 
Written by W. J. GROGAN, and sung by him, with tremendous 
applause, in his version of the sketch " W HO 
OWNS THE ASH BARREL." 
A VERY sad occurrence I'll endeavor to relate, 
That befel a 
pretty female in Jersey State, 
Which neither judge or jury e'er did investigate: 
T'was the collapse of the female smuggler,— 
The assassination of the female smuggler, 
Vivo Vivimus O'Reilly. 
This Mary Ann Haslett a 
true lover had, 
Who's occupation was selling shad; 
On poor Mary Ann he was clean gone mad, 
Mary Ann's dilapidated lover,— 
Mary Ann's " Nom Comptis lanais" lover, 
Patriae pietatis, imago Maarlana. 
lie asked Mary Ann to become his wife, 
She answered in the negative, which caused great strife; 
Ho swore by the Court House he would take the life 
01 the infatuating female smuggler,-
01 this heart-breaking female smuggler, 
Detectundo pariter, que Monendo Cusick. 
Her lover went down stairs to the very house-top, 
And from beneath a 
linen Ulster drew forth a 
pop, 
And pegged forty-seven shots out of this one barrel revolver, 
And stained the female smuggler,— 
A 
ad utterly annihilated the female smuggler,

Jonathan Joseph Jeremiah. 
Some men are so anxious for honor and fame, 
They'll work for a 
lifetime in making a 
name ; 
But too much of a 
name is a 
possible thing, 
As you'll say when you've heard what I'm going to sing. 
My father and mother wei-e 
excellent folks, 
But both had a 
weakness for practical jokes; 
So when I 
was born they were both of one mind, 
And said I 
should have all the names I 
could find. 
CHORUS. 
Jonathan, Joseph, Jeremiah, Timothy, Titus, Obadiah ; 
William, Henry, Walter, Sim, Reuben, Rufus, Solomon, Jim ; 
Nathaniel, Daniel, Abraham, Roderick, Frederick, Peter, Sam; 
Simon, Timon, Nicholas, Pat, Christopher, Dick, Jehosophat. 
I 
was sent to be christen'd before I 
could speak, 
So I 
couldn't object to this clirious freak ; 
There were two other voungs:ers that morning as well, 
But for these poor children it turn 'd out a 
sell ! 
When the clergyman came I 
was first of the three, 
So of course he commenced operations on me, 
And it took him so long all my titles to call, 
The other two babies got no names at all. 
Jonathan, Joseph, 8,:c. 
When I 
went to be married the case was as bad, 
The parson stared at me and thought I 
was mad. 
However, he started, but found very soon 
The task was too great to be finished by noon ; 
So he said, " My dear sir, it's a 
very great shame 
\Tour parents denied you a 
sehsible name; 
But thro' this strange freak without reason or rhyme, 
You'll have to be married a 
bit at a 
time." 
Jonathan, Joseph, & c. 
It appears that a 
gipsy a 
year or two since 
Told my wife that some day she would marry a 
prince 
With a 
long roll of titles, and she woula be bless'd 
With a 
boy for each name that her husband possess'd 
She often declares that the prophecy's right, 
But I 
am no prince, so I 
don't see it quite ; 
For if the last part of it ever comes true, 
I'm sure I 
don't know what on earth I 
shall do.

OH, MOODEMUS, 
Sung by the For SISTERS. 
My lover he is going to sea, oh. Nicodemus ! 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes swimming in the sea ! 
But he will soon wish for home, and to be back with rae— 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus ! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Nicodemus, Nicodemus! don't you go away? 
I 
love you Nicodemus, and I

I

Don't leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler bursting boat? 
Salt water you know is very wet, oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt '• junk." and nasty soft boil'd peas. 
Think of this well, Nicodemus, 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those watery seas. 
Oh, Nicodemus, 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, oh, NicodemnA ! 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away, there's no Lack door ; 
" 
Reef the anchor, Nicodcinu ,

You'll have to hold on very hard, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay. 
Oh, Nicodemus, 
" 
It's no use you talking to me ?" said Nicodemus, 
"For I 
intend a-going to sea, 
Out to China, for Souchoug and Congo tea; 
That's a

BA.P,Y bye, here's a 
fly I 
Let us =itch him, you and I. 
how he crawls 
Up the walls, 
Yet he never falls. 
I 
believe with six such legs 
You and I 
could walk on eggs. 
There he goes, 
On his toes, 
Tickling baby's nose. 
Spots of red dot his head ; 
Rainbows on his back are spread. 
That small speck 
Is his neck . 
See him nod and beck. 
I 
can show you, if you choose, 
Where to look to find his shoes; 
Three small pairs 
Made of hairs, 
These he always wears. 
Black and brown is his gown; 
He can wear it upside down. 
It is laced 
Round his waist ; 
I 
admire his taste. 
Yet though tight his clothes are mad*, 
He will lose them, Pm afraid, 
If to- night 
lie gets sight 
Of the candle-light-
In the sun webs are .;pun; 
What if he gets into ono? 
When it rains 
He complains 
On the wi ndow-panes. 
Tongue to talk have you and I • 
God has given the little fly 
No such things, 
So he sings 
With his buzzing wings. 
He can eat bread and meat; 
There's his mouth between his fest. 
On has bacl-
Is a 
pack 
Like a 
peddler's sack. 
Does the baby understand ? 
Then the fly shall kiss her hand; 
Put a 
crumb 
On her thumb, 
Maybe he will come. 
Catch him I No, let him go, 
Never hurt an insect so. 
But no doubt 
lie flies out 
Just to gad about. 
Now you sec his wings of silk 
Drabbled in the baby's milk; 
Fie, 0 
fie, 
Foolish fly ! 
How will he get dry ? 
All wet flies twist their thighs, 
Then they wipe their heads and eyes. 
Cats, you know, 
Wash just so, 
Then their whiskers grow. 
Flies have hairs too short to comb, 
So they fly bareheaded home; 
But the gnat 
Wears a 
hat, 
Do you believe that ? 
Flies can see more than we, 
So how bright their eyes must be 
Little fly, 
Ope your eye, 
Spiders are near by. 
For a 
secret I 
can tell— 
Spiders never use flies well 
Then away, 
Do not stay; 
Little fly, good-day. 
Some say that I'm a 
banker, 
Or deal in foreign wares, 
Some say that Pm a 
broker, 
Among the Bulls and Bears. 
Some say that I'm a 
lawyer, 
But all the maidens pretty, 
Think that I'm a 
preacher, or do 
Something in the city. 
Something, etc. 
Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, 
We talk about the weather, 
lip comes Brown (you all know Brown), 
We have a 
drink together. 
When I 
am gone, Brown says " who's her , 
That's Johnson, very witty," 
" 
What does h do?" " Bless me if I 
know, 
Spoken— Oh, yes! he does— 
Something in the city. 
Spoken— It's been remarked in my neghborhood that I 
was 
in the lottery business, and the young ladies they all say I'm 
on the press. 
But they are all wrong. 
Now I 
tell you confi-
dentially what I 
do f
or

li ving. Every 
time 
I go 
down 
town, 
I 
do—well— 
SOMETHING IN THE OITY. 
Sung with great success by WILL II. 
MORTON, with Harrigan 
and Hart's Combination. 
I 
live up town in Harlem, 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to town, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity, 
For they would like to know quite well, 
What f

Sweet visions of childhood, how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'erclouded with care; 
How fondly we dream of them year after year, 
And how lovely they are and how fair. 
Oh, bless'd are the scenes I 
ne'er can forget: 
Dearest mother so kind and so true; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
How my heart fondly turns unto you.

Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss and her hand on my brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last. 
Sweet visions of childhood, how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a 
fair mother's knee 
I 
linger while fast welling tears fondly start, 
And the past comes in beauty to me. 
Oh, time may destroy all the bright joy of life, 
But this bosom will ever retain 
Lovely visions of thee, 'mid the world's busy strife, 
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again. 
Sweet visions. Rm.

For love walks in the busy streets

She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not I

happy day 
And something that I

And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called—

For truth, I'm known both far and near. 
A 
story yet I'll tell; 
A 
little white one, done in black, 
Of a 
girl that I 
know well ; 
Her charms—no matter — they're beyond 
All words that I 
can find ; 
For where I 
am. do what I 
can, 
She's always in my mind. 
And she says she loves a 
young man 
That wore a 
light moustache, 
A 
pretty little goatee, 
And also lots of cash. 
His hair was light and curly, 
He'd whiskers on the side ; 
And that's the kind of chap you kno 
Could have her for a 
bride. 
Now, I 
don't wear a 
light moustache, 
A 
goatee I 
can't sport; 
If I 
wore whiskers on the side 
Of course they would be bought; 
And how to raise them I 
don't know— 
Or information find. 
That girl will drive me crazy, yet, 
She's always in my mind. 
And she says, !se. 
I 
called on her the other day, 
I 
begged her for a 
smile ; 
She said, Oh no I 
my youthful friend. 
You are not quite the style! 
But still, with all, it is not right, 
That I 
should be unkind. 
That girl will some day. sure, be mine ; 
So I'll keep her'in my mind. And she says, ke.

My fair one, my Pet of the Swells! 
She is haughty and proud they all say, 
But that's just what I 
like the best; 
For she knows she's the Belle of Broadway, 
When she is in her prettiest dress'd ; 
Gents say that she is a

My Heart has Room for Thee. 
As sung by HARRY BEcKwrus in his original operatic sketch, " just by 
Chance." 
I 
never loved till I 
saw you 
No fickle heart have I; 
rye seen the sights of many lands, 
I've wandered far and nigh. 
I've never been so wild but that 
From vice I've kept me free; 
My love for you is pure and strong, 
My heart has room for thee. 
My heart has room, my heart has room for thee 
I've seen bright eyes in stranger climes. 
I've heard sweet words divine, 
I've looked upon their beauty oft, 
But none I've seen like thine. 
Come, say that you will be my love, 
Say that my bride you'll be; 
In year: to come you'll find that yet 
My heart has room for thee, 
My heart has room, my heart has room for thee.

applause. 
Air.—" Eileen Alann.a." 
My name is Pat Delaney, I 
came from Tralee, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house, way up in Avenue C; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
tegrible roar, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
Men I 
get home at night, boys, I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge, and have him push their case quite 
strong. 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their aufzus asthore. 
Working hard, eta.

expressly for Miss Fi.oitA. MounE. 
I 
came from dear old Ireland friends, 
A few short. weeks ago, 
In a 
great big ship I ( rossed over, 
To Castle Garden below, 
And feeling very home- sick, 
With my friends so far away, 
I 
sat on my chest to take a 
rest, 
'When I 
heard some young lads say, 
Cuonus. 
Oh pipe her off, just pipe her off, 
She has got a 
regular tarrier's face, 
Oh pipe her off, just pipe her off, 
Now ain' t 
that a 
disgrace. 
In Fifth Avenue I'm working, 
In a 
yankee family, 
I'm going to save my wages up, 
And bank them all you see, 
I'll go back to old Ireland, 
And it's there I 
intend to stay, 
For here the blackguards drive o mad, 
When e' re I

Oh! say, can you see by the dawn's early light. 
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming ? 
'Whose broad s+ripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, 
O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming? 
And the r,cket's red -Iare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave - roof thro' the night that our flag was still there. 
Oh! say, does that star spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave ? 
CHORUS. 
Oh! say, does that star sangled banner yet wave, 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
On the shore, dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep, 
Where the foe's haughty host it dread zilence reposes— 
What is that wisirt,11 the breeze, o'er the 
wring steep 
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses— 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam; 
In full glory reflected, now shines in the stream?

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

'Mid the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,

Their blood had washed out their foul footsteps' pollution! 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave.

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
Oh, say, & c.

SUNDAY, WHEN THE BELLS BEGIN TO 
RING. 
Song and Dance, written and sung by MAY FLORENCE only. 
IT was summer and the merry birds were singing, 
I 
was strolling by a 
brook on.Sunday Morn, 
And wishing then to hear the Church bells ringing, 
When I 
met the sweetest darling ever born, 
With a 
jaunty hat and saucy laughing eyes, 
As lovely as a 
queen she was dressed, 
When she smiled on Inc I 
was struck with surprise. 
And thought if she were mine I 
would be blessed.

She's an Angel from above, 
To my neck I 
fell in love ; 
She's as pretty as the picture of an angel, 
And sweeter than the birds she can sing, 
I 
met her by the brook last Sunday morning, 
It was just before the bells began to ring. 
(break)

stepped up to her side and raised my hat. 
For my heart was in a 
flutter of delight, 
i 
scarcely knew what compliment to pay her. 
So I 
told her that her eyes were sparkling bright. 
Then she took my arm, in such a 
stylish way, 
And seemed to be so happy all the while; 
When I 
asked her to be my wife, said I'd stick to her 
through life. 
She sweetly answered yes, and then she smiled. 
She's an angel from ala.-

GIVE A 
THOUGHT TO THE HON EST WORK-
INGM AN. 
An original song sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Grand Central 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
This is a 
world of luck and chance, of losses and of gain, 
Some lives are filled with pleasure, while others naught but pain, 
If yours is filled with comfort enjoy it while you can, 
But sometimes try and give a 
thought to the honest workingman, 
There's many a 
mighty millionaire who now sleeps in his grave, 
Who never gave a 
single dime the laboring man to save, 
Of such as these to sing about 'tis not my aim or plan, 
For I'll sing of men who gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There is one, who though in wealth he rolled, whose charity 
was sure, 
And the clink of his bright yellow gold was music to the poor, 
And many a 
cheerless hearthstone by his kindness was made 
bright 
In noble deeds of charity that never saw the light. 
By some beloved, by some adored, by others fawned around, 
He turned not to the right or left but nobly stood his ground, 
In every m;ghty enterprise each project or each plan, 
George Peabody always gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There was a 
man who rose to fame and fortune, swift and sure, 
Whose name will be remembered in our hearts forevermore; 
Though wealth rolled in his coffers for years on every hand, 
He shared it with the hungry and the poor of this bright land. 
He was a 
Nature's nobleman if ever there was one, 
A 
tender, loving husband, a 
kind and gentle son; 
His bright face we will see no more, forget him now who can? 
A.be Lincoln always gave a 
thought to the honest workingman

GIVE BREAD TO THE POOR. 
57 
As sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of tle many poor families who had nothing in store. 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, " Give bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the dor, gave his office for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at their ease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
Stood Governor Wade '
Hampton giving bread to the poot

like them best of all, my friend, 
When they are young and new; 
Just give to me a 
dozen or so. 
Most any time of' day, 
And I'll show you how an Irishman 
With them will get away. 
Then move not, &e. 
Now you may like biled oysters, 
And others, quail on toast, 
And some they like good pork and beans, 
And others a 
good beef roast; 
Well you can take them all, my boys, 
In welcome, too, at that; 
But leave to me the praties, for 
They always suit poor Pat! 
Then move not, 4te.

I 
TRUST YOU WILL EXCUSE. 
(Companion to " I 
Hope I 
don't Intrude.") 
Words and music by the same author—W. H. DELEHANTY. 
You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while ; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of Ambetisle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw mycelf away; 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keen from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shallte'er forget the moonlight picnic 
They gave at " Amberisle;" 
How the pleasures were ,ecstatic for 
The best of ' • bon ton" style. 
It was there I 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I 
asked to see her home 
She said " I 
can't refuse." 
(Sym.) 
(SYm.) 
Oh, when I 
hear, etc. 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline," 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse ; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
Oh, when I 
hear, etc.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, v.hich might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of CArds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with. 
the state of their affection-, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
