SPEAKERS
Kate Lott, Jared Schmidt
Kate Lott 00:00
As ready as you can be on Monday morning, right?
Jared Schmidt 00:10
Right. Well, this is Dr. Jared Schmidt, once again with Dr. Kate Lotte, um, part two. And I want
to make sure on this blustery, storm-ridden, Monday morning, February the 28th, that I have
your consent to record this part of the interview as well.
Kate Lott 00:16
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 00:22
Great. So, last time we spoke, we were talking about the cheesemaking, like biology of the area
and what makes it distinct. And I was, and we're also talking a lot about you performing C-
sections on, on cattle. And I was wondering if you had any more fun experiences, since we
talked last night you might want to share given, you know, thinking of the weather, you talked
about having to give a C-section in a rainstorm, if you have anything like that?
Kate Lott 00:33
Well, I don't mean I don't practice much anymore.
Jared Schmidt 00:35
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 00:35
Right.
Kate Lott 00:35
So, I don't do a lot of fun stuff anymore.
Jared Schmidt 00:36
[Laughs]
Kate Lott 00:36
Unfortunately. Especially surgery, I can't even remember the last time I did surgery. So...
Jared Schmidt 00:39
Oh, okay.
Kate Lott 00:42
It's a little less exciting, but I've definitely done some with no power. You know, we've had
some flooded situations, even probably since we talked.
Jared Schmidt 01:07
Mhm.
Kate Lott 01:09
Where we're trying to get milk hauled out of farms that are flooded. And we had one not too
long ago, you know, the farmer is on his tractor
Jared Schmidt 01:28
Mhm.
Kate Lott 01:29
guiding the milk truck out of the farm so that they know where the road is because, you know,
water's two feet deep and it's dark.
K
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 01:37
Yeah.
Kate Lott 01:38
So that, that was a, you know, a case that we did, whenever it flooded. I don't remember when
that was the last two months.
Jared Schmidt 01:46
Right.
Kate Lott 01:47
A couple farms that were flooded, a couple of we actually dumped milk because we can't get in
there and get them out. It's too, it's too flooded.
Jared Schmidt 01:54
Yeah.
Kate Lott 01:55
So we did that recently.
Jared Schmidt 01:59
Yeah.
Kate Lott 02:01
I, I generally, now, talk to people about animal health events more in a consulting way.
Jared Schmidt 02:08
Yeah.
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 02:09
So, you know, last week, a farmer called, just frustrated with with his bacteria counts in his
milk.
Jared Schmidt 02:16
Mhm.
Kate Lott 02:16
So we went through a lot of the stuff he's, you know, upgraded his cooling system, he's
upgraded his hot water so that is his milking system washes really well with really hot water.
Jared Schmidt 02:28
Mkay.
Kate Lott 02:28
And so it was just a matter of he's kind of getting down to the really fine detail points about
how can he make his bacteria count even lower.
Jared Schmidt 02:36
Mhm.
Kate Lott 02:37
So I went out, I had time that day, I went right out and just watched his guys in the parlor. How
are they milking cows? How are they prepping cows? How are they drawing teats, you know,
and then I check the teat ends to make sure they're healthy.
Jared Schmidt 02:51
Mhm.
Kate Lott 02:52
You know, what is that? It's you know, it's like having chapped hands in the winter, right? So,
you want to make sure it's nice skin, there's not chapped cracks. And then that the, that the
cleaning process is actually cleaning that teat before the milking unit goes on. So I went and
K
K
K
K
K
checked some of that. And I felt like there were some dirty teat ends. And so he was going to
work on prep. Sometimes it's just slowing down. You know, it's just making sure the guys take
their time, detail oriented.
Jared Schmidt 03:24
Mhm.
Kate Lott 03:24
The other thing that, that I did, and we do this routinely, most guys are using cloth towels.
Jared Schmidt 03:32
Okay.
Kate Lott 03:32
So they, they prep the cows, they clean the teats, and then they dry them with a cloth towel.
And every, every teat gets dried with this towel. Usually one towel per cow. So some people
still use paper towels, but most people have gone to cloth, which means then they get washed
and dried in a washing machine and a dryer. So we generally look at that process as well. It's
something that people don't think about.
Jared Schmidt 04:01
Right.
Kate Lott 04:01
But people tend to put too many towels in the washer and in the dryer and they don't clean
very well
Jared Schmidt 04:09
Ooh!
Kate Lott 04:09
if you have packed the washer completely full and then started the dryer. And if you're getting
damp towels out of the dryer and using them on the next set of cows, they're not always clean
or dry, and they're actually putting more bacteria on the teat, then you're removing.
K
K
K
K
or dry, and they're actually putting more bacteria on the teat, then you're removing.
Jared Schmidt 04:26
Right.
Kate Lott 04:27
So, we will actually sample the towels, bring them back to the lab, and have them cultured for
bacteria and find out, and I had his culture the other day and the towels were actually clean
and dry. Very low bacteria counts. So that's what we want. But, we do that quite a bit and we
find that they need to put less towels in so they get washed, they get dried. And then they're
actually clean when they're using them on the cows. So there's, there's all these things that
people potentially don't think about that we have to look at all these little details in order to
have quality milk,
Jared Schmidt 04:59
Right. Yeah, I mean, as somebody who literally just started a load of laundry, like, it makes a lot
of sense, right? Like, not to be stereotypical man but overloads the washer pointing fingers at
myself. Right, but I guess I didn't think about that aspect of, of dairy. Do you, does that mean, a
lot of your job does it entail some, like, education as well, or more of like, a cup of coffee
conversation kind of situation.
Kate Lott 05:28
It can be all over the board. I mean, sometimes people are just calling me on the phone. A
couple of weeks ago was about calves that were sick, had diarrhea.
Jared Schmidt 05:35
Mhm.
Kate Lott 05:35
You know, they're, they've worked through a lot of things, generally, by the time they call me.
You know, they've, they've thought through some things on their farm with their employees,
with their family, potentially even talked to their, you know, either their nutritionist that comes
to their farm quite a bit, their veterinarian that does, you know, their herd health work now. But
they'll call me and kind of second opinion type of situation like, "hey, what else? You know,
what am I missing?" And a lot of it, I mean, these things can seem simple.
Jared Schmidt 06:07
K
K
K
Right.
Kate Lott 06:08
Milking a cow, or whatever, washing something, you know, washing and drying something. But
sometimes you just needed that kind of second set of eyes to just question, are you doing it the
best way? And then, yeah, so I'll I'll talk through training, either with them like, "Oh, have you
thought about this, and maybe you should try this, or maybe you need to do it this way." But
then also training of their employees. And so we actually have a training next week in Spanish
here at the Creamery.
Jared Schmidt 06:35
Oh cool.
Kate Lott 06:36
For, you know, farm employees to come and have that conversation in Spanish with someone
who has, you know, good Spanish speaking skills, which isn't me. But, you know, we'll come
and go through that training, you know, why do we do training? Why do we have to continually
do training? Some people, you know, get their feelings hurt, when we talk about, "Well, we
have to retrain you," and they're like, "What do you think I'm stupid?" And you're like, "No, we
just need to continue to think about this."
Jared Schmidt 07:03
Right.
Kate Lott 07:04
Continuous improvement means continuously educating yourself, and continually looking at
how we do these protocols. We don't want procedural drift.
Jared Schmidt 07:14
Yeah.
Kate Lott 07:15
Sometimes things need to be done a certain way, and people just tend to start doing it a
different way, right. And sometimes that's cutting out steps. Sometimes that's changing the
steps. So we try to work with people so that the things that need to not change, you know,
K
K
K
K
don't change. And then, when it comes to, you know, treatments, or feeding, or some of these
things do change, right? Someone decides to change the protocol, but then they don't tell
everyone or they don't train people to do it different.
Jared Schmidt 07:46
Mhm.
Kate Lott 07:47
You know, and we've had a lot of that with animal health products. Because of COVID, I mean,
supply chain has been challenging to say the least. And so some products that just, you can't
get a certain product that you were using, and so you're changing it out with something else.
But if you're not telling people, making sure that everyone knows there can be issues on the
farm with, with protocols. And so, that's one of the big things that we work on, my whole team.
My parts, obviously, focused around animal care, but, you know, I have, I have someone on my
team who looks at the milk cooling and the washing of the pipeline, and, you know, rubber
gaskets that are part of that system. And so, that's what he's, he's looking at, and then
someone else on my team is looking at soil samples and manure records. Are we applying
manure? I mean, hopefully not today, right? It's raining. And so...
Jared Schmidt 08:39
[Laughs] It'll wash out really quick.
Kate Lott 08:42
Yeah, just thinking about those things. And are we doing the right protocol for the right
situation across the board for, for multiple technical things, whether it's manure and soil, or
cow health, or you know, milking procedures.
Jared Schmidt 08:56
Right.
Kate Lott 08:57
All, all of those things are important. And, and a lot of them have pretty mundane, you know,
protocol tasks that have to be done every day. And it's just making sure everyone's on the
same page.
Jared Schmidt 09:08
K
K
K
Yeah. So what you're saying is, there's no such thing as a normal day?
Kate Lott 09:13
There is not and [Jared laughs] we've talked about that. I mean, I educate employees here at
Tillamook in the company to about...Most of them don't understand what we're doing in farm
services or on farms, you know, they're salespeople, or they're making cheese, or, you know,
their finance, accounting people are whatever it is. And so, we try to do those education things,
or we're working on that, what's, like, what's a day in the life for a cow?
Jared Schmidt 09:37
Yeah.
Kate Lott 09:37
What's a day in a life for me. What's a day in the life of, you know, a farmer, or a nutritionist, or
a milker on a dairy. And so, we're trying to put that together for 2022. Like, that's our education
packet kind of for this year.
Jared Schmidt 09:51
Oh, that'll be cool.
Kate Lott 09:52
So people have that understanding, you know, what's going on on a daily basis, which is not
just a list of things every day.
Jared Schmidt 10:00
Right. You mentioned a second ago about the supply chain shortages we're experiencing, as
were compounded by, you know, the ongoing now, war between Russia and Ukraine...
Kate Lott 10:14
Oh! They could get a lot worse!
Jared Schmidt 10:15
What was that?
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 10:17
Things could get a lot worse, right? It's not just COVID!
Jared Schmidt 10:19
Things could get a lot worse, yes! Yeah. So how has all of these factors impacted your work
with, itn getting grains to farmers or supplies? How was that all impacted you? And maybe the
county in dairy more broadly?
Kate Lott 10:39
Yeah. So, I mean, for the pandemic, for sure. Obviously, there was, there were supply chain
issues, right? And early on, it was the hoarding, and then some of it was, you know, various
distribution issues.
Jared Schmidt 10:52
Mhm.
Kate Lott 10:53
Some of it was actual production issues. So, one of the things for cattle is that vaccines, you
know, other medicine, either the active ingredient was actually short, somewhere.
Jared Schmidt 11:08
Hmm.
Kate Lott 11:08
Some of that was because a lot of those plants were actually transition. You know, if you think
about cattle vaccines, some of those were transitioned to COVID supplies, vaccines, etc.
Jared Schmidt 11:20
Ooh.
Kate Lott 11:20
And so, there were places that those plants generate human products and animal products.
K
K
K
K
K
And so, there were places that those plants generate human products and animal products.
And so, those things were in short supply, so cattle get the short end of the stick, I mean,
basically.
Jared Schmidt 11:35
Right.
Kate Lott 11:37
So, those, those kinds of issues impacted manufacturing of cattle antibiotics, vaccines.
Jared Schmidt 11:48
Mhm.
Kate Lott 11:48
And then obviously, you know, like, if you think about latex gloves, right? We use those, milkers
wear those every day to milk cows for hygiene. But, at the early, you know, everyone was
wearing gloves, you know, there were, there was a shortage of chlorine, you know, cleaning
products that, that went to COVID you know, use.
Jared Schmidt 12:10
Right.
Kate Lott 12:11
And so, therefore, we were a little worried we would not have those things for, for, for dairies.
And our farm store tried to source those things, cleaning products, and make sure that we
would have that inventory for farmers.
Jared Schmidt 12:27
Mkay.
Kate Lott 12:27
And I think we've done a pretty good job of either substituting, or keeping those products on
hand so that we haven't had a shortage of, you know, chlorine, which we use every day to
clean milk tanks, you know, after the milks picked up.
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 12:44
Mhm.
Kate Lott 12:44
And so, those things are important. And we've, we've been, I guess, lucky, because we haven't
had such a shortage that we can't, can't clean those things.
Jared Schmidt 12:53
Yeah.
Kate Lott 12:54
Same thing in the plant, I mean, we, obviously, need to clean all those surfaces in the plant
every single day.
Jared Schmidt 13:01
Right.
Kate Lott 13:01
So, a lot of stainless steel pipes and silos and, and all of that's got to be cleaned. And so, the
supply chain team did a great job. Now, it's really, between inflation, obviously, a lot of other,
you know, global issues, fuel, you know, fuels up.
Jared Schmidt 13:18
Mhm.
Kate Lott 13:18
So, for these guys, you know, that means their bills are increased in terms of using tractors and
trucks, hauling of everything. So,you know, milk hauling, feed, hauling, manure hauling, a lot of
other supplies, all of that's increased, a lot of it, because of the hauling costs, which is also fuel
related. And then feed is also increased. And so, a lot of our farmers are experiencing feed
increases of 20 to 40% inflation right now.
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 13:48
Really?
Kate Lott 13:50
Some of that's drought shortages.
Jared Schmidt 13:53
Mkay.
Kate Lott 13:53
You know, last year was a drought year. And so, we're still on feed from 2021 harvest season.
And so anything that was short or drought is still causing an issue for feed until we get this
year's crop, basically, you know, grown and harvested.
Jared Schmidt 14:11
Right.
Kate Lott 14:12
So those all those issues. The other thing is, is obviously exports, which are great if we could
sell stuff, export it and sell it. But if we don't have enough here, and we're selling it because the
export price is more than that's, that's creating an issue for farmers. So yeah, all across the
board, inflation's definitely the talk of 2022.
Jared Schmidt 14:33
Okay. Yeah, I guess that makes a lot of sense. So, is that going to impact, like, potential
viability of farms in the area and maybe the cost of let's say, like a block of cheddar as well? Or
how is that all gonna interplay, or?
Kate Lott 14:51
Yeah, definitely concerns about that. And some farms could be, you know, really, really tight,
looking at what they, you know what they can do in terms of managing those costs. They don't
get to set the price of milk.
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 15:09
Okay.
Kate Lott 15:10
You know, it's a federal, it's a federal order set, you know, commodity based pricing.
Jared Schmidt 15:16
Oh! Okay.
Kate Lott 15:17
So, you know, Tillamook can decide how much we're going to charge people for cheese.
Jared Schmidt 15:21
Right.
Kate Lott 15:22
But the milk price is based on nothing that we have any control over. And that's, that's how
farmers are paid for milk.
Jared Schmidt 15:30
Mkay.
Kate Lott 15:31
We can obviously pay them in the ones that are owners of Tillamook Co-Op. They get, you
know, additional money because of the sale of the branded products. So that helps a lot. But
obviously, even us asking for price increases on cheese and ice cream at the store level, right?
Jared Schmidt 15:51
Mhm.
Kate Lott 15:51
This may not be the year, you know, to do that. And there's a lot of discussion other places in
K
K
K
K
K
This may not be the year, you know, to do that. And there's a lot of discussion other places in
the company about, you know, do we increase our cost of production is up across the board. So
it's at farms, it's up, milk is going to cost more to produce.
Jared Schmidt 16:06
Mhm.
Kate Lott 16:07
It's going to cost more to produce cheese, right, because of all the same things, hauling, labor, I
mean, everything's, you know, inflationary pressures on a lot of things.
Jared Schmidt 16:16
Yeah.
Kate Lott 16:17
And so, then, we have to decide, like a lot of other products are going to have to decide, right?
Do you increase your price and hope people are going to pay for it? Or do you try to hold the
line and not lose too much money.
Jared Schmidt 16:28
Mhm.
Kate Lott 16:29
So, farmers are just always a little bit stuck, because, for the most part, they, they have to take
whatever price is put out there for their products, whether it's wheat, or corn or milk.
Jared Schmidt 16:41
Mhm.
Kate Lott 16:42
It's kind of the price that's, that's out there. They don't get to say, "Hey, I'm gonna sell it to you
for X dollars more." It just doesn't work that way with commodity pricing. So...
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 16:52
Okay, so that set at the federal level for milk, and then the creamery pays at that price for the
milk, or how's that work?
Kate Lott 16:59
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 17:00
Okay.
Kate Lott 17:00
So we pay based on that price. And then we have other, other pricing structures that we put
into place for our Co-Op, and a lot of other coops do the same. Whether its for milk quality, we
pay premiums for milk quality. And we pay, like I said, basically a brand premium. So the
people that own this company get, get, you know, basically profit sharing for that. So our
farmers get additional money beyond the milk price.
Jared Schmidt 17:27
Okay.It's interesting. Yeah, it'd be, I guess, intriguing to watch how this...
Kate Lott 17:33
But there's, there's a lot of years for farmers. I mean, I grew up that way, as a kid, where you're
gonna have years that are a loss.
Jared Schmidt 17:41
Mhm.
Kate Lott 17:43
It was kind of always a joke, or maybe it's real, like a five year cycle. You know, you might
make money one or two years,
Jared Schmidt 17:49
Mhm.
K
K
K
K
Mhm.
Kate Lott 17:50
you might lose really bad one or two years, and maybe you break even the other year.
Jared Schmidt 17:56
Mhm.
Kate Lott 17:56
And, I mean, that's really the farming cycle, unfortunately. And so the really good years have to
get you through some pretty bad years.
Jared Schmidt 18:04
Yeah.
Kate Lott 18:04
The other thing is that, during the bad years, people take out operating loans. And so, then
there, they have loans that they hope they can pay back on the good years. But that's, that's
really the farming cycle.
Jared Schmidt 18:16
Right.
Kate Lott 18:16
And it's hard for some people to continually have to take out operating loans, especially if
you're close to retirement, you know.
Jared Schmidt 18:23
Oh yeah.
Kate Lott 18:24
You may just decide to retire early, which is what some of our farmers are definitely thinking
about because of the prices.
K
K
K
K
K
about because of the prices.
Jared Schmidt 18:30
Mkay. Yeah, growing up in rural Minnesota, that sounds very similar to what I grew up hearing.
And my father was a car salesman. So those narratives were very constant with...
Kate Lott 18:42
He knew what years to sell cars and what years nobody was gonna buy.
Jared Schmidt 18:46
It would be interesting to see, going back through my father sales records, how, if there was a
correlation between the previous year's success or good years and lean years, that'd be
interesting. Yeah, now, now we're just giving me more research to do. Thanks.
Kate Lott 19:01
More data nerds stuff, right?
Jared Schmidt 19:03
More data nerds stuff. [Sarcastically] Oh, no, not that. You also mentioned about, maybe ten-
minutes or so ago about, you're working on putting together a program, education program in
Spanish. I was wondering if you could maybe speak to the Spanish speaking population that
work with the dairy farming in Tillamook County, like the percentage of farm hands that are,
you know, Latinx immigrants, the dynamics of working with this community in our county,
what, how that looks.
Kate Lott 19:40
Yeah, um, a lot of, a lot of our farm workers are, you know, Hispanic descent. Some have been
here for a long time. I mean, obviously dairying in Tillamooks, you know, 115 years old or
something.
Jared Schmidt 20:00
Mhm.
Kate Lott 20:01
There's a lot of workers here that have worked on farms, 15, 20 years. And so, whether they're
K
K
K
K
There's a lot of workers here that have worked on farms, 15, 20 years. And so, whether they're
from Mexico or somewhere else in Central America, or whether they're from Tillamook, a lot of
long term employees on farms. Which is a benefit, I think, in general, for cows, for the farm.
When we don't have constant turnover of people trying to learn the farm and how things go,
Jared Schmidt 20:28
Yeah.
Kate Lott 20:28
is always better. We do have a lot of people, obviously, where Spanish is their first language.
And so we're always, we're always thinking about how we can train people,
Jared Schmidt 20:41
Mhm.
Kate Lott 20:42
both in English and in Spanish, and how we can also bridge the cultural barrier, which is
sometimes, I think we have to understand, you know, especially Mexican culture can be
different than American in terms of, you know, machismo influences. I mean, I ran a herd and a
group of guys that really didn't potentially want to listen to me. And it was their culture, it
wasn't that they were necessarily, didn't think I knew what I was talking about. They're just
used to men, leading business, men, leading companies, men, you know, doing, doing those
things.
Jared Schmidt 21:26
Mhm.
Kate Lott 21:26
And so, it's just something that we have to think about.
Jared Schmidt 21:28
Yeah.
Kate Lott 21:29
K
K
K
K
And how do we, how do we teach them. A lot of times people tell them the protocol, or how to
do something. We have to understand that the why of why we're doing it that way is important.
And sometimes that's easy to explain to someone who English is their first language, it's harder
to explain it to someone who English is their second language, and you don't know much
Spanish. So, we just try to think about those things.
Jared Schmidt 21:55
Mhm.
Kate Lott 21:56
And you use people that we have in the industry that can help us. I speak a little Spanish, but
not enough to do an hour long talk.
Jared Schmidt 22:05
Right.
Kate Lott 22:06
But we have some people, consultants, and various other groups we work with that have, you
know, bilingual dairy experts that can help us on that training aspect.
Jared Schmidt 22:17
Oh, cool.
Kate Lott 22:18
So that people can really know like, why are we asking you to milk cows this way? And why are
we doing things, you know, in a certain way, that I think helps the cows, it helps the milk
quality, it helps the farms in general. And so, I think, you know, across the board, however, we
can understand people.
Jared Schmidt 22:39
Mhm.
Kate Lott 22:41
One of the things I think that, that often happens, to, is there something on piece paper, you
K
K
K
K
One of the things I think that, that often happens, to, is there something on piece paper, you
know, and everyone's like, "Well, you just need to translate it to Spanish." But, I mean, some of
these, some of these people can't read in Spanish either. And so, we have to understand that
it's not always just translating it.
Jared Schmidt 22:57
Yeah.
Kate Lott 22:58
It's, you know, they can't read in English or in Spanish. And so, a lot of documents aren't
necessarily helpful.
Jared Schmidt 23:06
Right.
Kate Lott 23:07
How do we do it in videos? Or, how do we do it in person training, instead, and so that we're
just always trying to think about it. I think people sometimes use the language barrier as a, you
know, as an excuse, maybe, in terms of understanding where we just need to do a better job
training people.
Jared Schmidt 23:25
Mhm.
Kate Lott 23:25
You know, I learned by writing stuff down and so, I want to have a written document but there's
a lot of people who don't learn that way, right?
Jared Schmidt 23:32
Right.
Kate Lott 23:32
And they would just assume learn in person or watch a video. And we have to think about
learning styles as well as language and cultural, you know, differences. And so, it's just thinking
about that. I think the interesting thing in Tillamook, there's a lot of, there's a lot of old family
K
K
K
K
about that. I think the interesting thing in Tillamook, there's a lot of, there's a lot of old family
Tillamook dairymen, I guess, that have been here for, you know, generations, 100 years. A lot
of Swiss immigrants came here. So there's that influence.
Jared Schmidt 24:02
Mhm.
Kate Lott 24:03
But there's actually a lot of Portuguese dairy farmers that have come from California. And so,
there's a Portuguese influence, and they dairy, sometimes, in very different ways, very
different personalities and cultures. And so it's interesting to see all the different, you know,
ways you can do it and how we can, you know, be I guess, that melting pot of the United States
and really use all those different things and, and have a really good so...
Jared Schmidt 24:07
Hmm. That's cool. Do, when you, you mentioned these different cultural ways of dairy, dairy
and cattle, or milking cows and everything. Do you help them embrace that, those differences
between, you said, mentioned the Portuguese and the Swiss? Or is there more of a
standardization across the board effort, or how do you balance that identity versus, "Hey, this is
how we have to do things for the FDA."
Kate Lott 25:03
Well, yeah, I mean, there's things you have to meet, right? Everyone has to meet a standard.
But there's, I mean, we joke a lot, there's 70 different ways to do that.
Jared Schmidt 25:11
[Laughs]
Kate Lott 25:12
And there really is. There's a lot of different ways. I mean, I'll say that, there's a lot of ways to
do the right thing, you know.
Jared Schmidt 25:18
Mhm.
K
K
K
Kate Lott 25:18
And so you can do that, as long as you're getting to the expectation, whatever it is, milk quality
or manure hauling. I mean, we have regulation and expectation, there's a lot of ways to get
there. And some of that's different personalities, it's different experience.
Jared Schmidt 25:33
Mhm.
Kate Lott 25:36
And I, you know, it's really, learning, obviously, you know, guys that have come from California
or somewhere else to dairy have to learn what Tillamook County is like. You know, when it's
raining a lot or [Jared laughs] not warm enough to grow certain crops, they think, you know,
should grow, there's things that you have to learn about this unique environment.
Jared Schmidt 25:45
Mhm. Mhm.
Kate Lott 25:55
But there's also a lot of great things that have come from those people coming from
somewhere else and, and bringing different ideas. And so, I think that's, you know, for me, I
didn't grow up in the dairy industry. So I bring different ideas to, to them all the time, because I
didn't grow up in it. My grandpa didn't do it. My dad didn't do it.
Jared Schmidt 26:14
Right.
Kate Lott 26:14
And so, I don't have those kind of ingrained things that we always did. And that's, I think, that's
the benefit of having people from different, different educational experience, different
locational experience, different cultures even and how do you get it done, to a great standard,
but it can be different ways.
Jared Schmidt 26:37
Yeah. I like that idea. There's a lot of ways to do the right, to do it right, or you said it, yeah. Do
you have an example, perhaps, of, of a way that, I keep drawing on the Swiss and Portuguese,
and even the, the Mexican approaches to dairying that you've seen, like, a, maybe like, one
K
K
K
K
and even the, the Mexican approaches to dairying that you've seen, like, a, maybe like, one
example to speak of that's like, "Oh, they do it this way because they're from here, or they do it
this way because they're here, but they're all doing it in Tillamook."
Kate Lott 27:04
I don't know that, I can't think of any example like specific procedure.
Jared Schmidt 27:10
Right.
Kate Lott 27:10
I think a lot of its personality, there's a lot of, a lot of Swiss farmers very introverted, I would
say.
Jared Schmidt 27:19
Mkay.
Kate Lott 27:19
Stay home, farm, quiet, you know, family people, but stick to themselves. Portuguese tend to
be a little bit more, you know, extroverted, out socializing. And so, I see it more that way.
Jared Schmidt 27:35
Okay.
Kate Lott 27:35
I've had clients of, you know, very Swiss heritage, just a different, just a different way,
perspective, you know, personality than some Portuguese, kind of more, I guess, gregarious, or,
you know, bubbly,
Jared Schmidt 27:53
Yeah.
Kate Lott 27:53
K
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 27:53
type personalities. And so you, you run your business different. And I think that's just, that's
just personality differences.
Jared Schmidt 28:01
Mhm.
Kate Lott 28:01
And it's not across the board, right?
Jared Schmidt 28:02
Right.
Kate Lott 28:02
It's not every single one. But it's definitely interesting to see, to see those differences.
Jared Schmidt 28:09
Mkay. That's cool. And bringing us back to that broader idea, then, of community, right. I was
wondering, what impact does this Creamery, the Tillamook Creamery have on the Tillamook
community, more broadly that you've seen?
Kate Lott 28:25
So we are the largest employer in the, in the county. And so, I think, I mean, we have a lot, a lot
to offer.
Jared Schmidt 28:36
Yeah.
Kate Lott 28:37
Not only for employment at the company, but also because then the dairy, the dairy farm
aspect, is also a big driver of economic success and prosperity here.
K
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 28:51
Mhm.
Kate Lott 28:52
So it's not just the employees that we have, right, in the company that make cheese and work
at our farm store and work here in the office. But then there's dairies, and dairy farming, and
milk hauling, and equipment dealerships, and feed, you know, feed companies, and
veterinarians and nutritionists. And so, there's a lot of economic, you know, generation of
activity that's basically happening because of the dairy industry.
Jared Schmidt 29:18
Mkay.
Kate Lott 29:19
And so, it's significant in the county, and I think it's something that we've also talked about
internally is how, how do we offer economic stability, leadership, you know, roles in county
stuff, in city stuff, and in other things in the, in the county. And, and then how do we also help
solve some of the issues that we have here, right?
Jared Schmidt 29:43
Mhm.
Kate Lott 29:44
Housing, you know, housing issues, lack of housing.
Jared Schmidt 29:48
Yeah.
Kate Lott 29:48
How do we, how do we, you know, take care of, you know, houseless people, veterans, food
insecurity, which is, it was, you know, I think it's a pretty, it's a rural county that has some food
insecurity issues for sure.
Jared Schmidt 30:04
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 30:04
Yeah, yeah.
Kate Lott 30:04
And so, we've made that one of our, you know, one of our biggest kind of community giving
things, whether it's cheese, you know, to the food bank or money to those things, we've, we've
tried to really see how we can help with some of the, you know, the community issues.
Obviously, some of it is also infrastructure, right?
Jared Schmidt 30:27
Yeah.
Kate Lott 30:27
Internet, we've put a big, a big push towards broadband, and easier access, and better access
to, to internet, you know, capabilities.
Jared Schmidt 30:38
Mhm.
Kate Lott 30:38
And then, also, the roads. I mean, obviously, we need, we need Highway 6 to get
Jared Schmidt 30:43
Yeah.
Kate Lott 30:43
to get milk, and cheese, and employees, and other products moved back and forth. And
obviously, we're, we're a little bit isolated in Tillamook County based on geography.
Jared Schmidt 30:54
Yeah.
Kate Lott 30:54
K
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 30:54
And then lack of really good roadsm, right? And so, a lot of those things we try to, we try to be
part of the solution, part of the economic drivers, and also part of the leadership, you know,
support, I guess, of those community things.
Jared Schmidt 31:11
Right. Yeah, bringing up with Highway 6, because that leads to Portland. Right? Yeah. Being
the, as my partner calls it, a twisty, windy, and very dangerous road, I'm sure that, that's a
factor with negotiating everything, especially now with gas prices and supply chain. And, it's
just interesting that living here, it makes you go, that makes me think about how that all plays
together, I guess.
Kate Lott 31:40
Yeah. And even, I mean, even bridges and other infrastructure right here in Tillamook County,
you know, there's been recently some bridges that were, you know, downgraded in terms of
weight. And that affects, you know, milk hauling routes.
Jared Schmidt 31:54
Right.
Kate Lott 31:55
That affects feed hauling from trucks that potentially are larger than those weight restrictions.
And so we're always kind of paying attention to those kind of engineering structural things.
Jared Schmidt 32:06
Mhm.
Kate Lott 32:06
But also what, you know, in emergency situations, whether it's flooding or tsunami, you know,
there's all these things that could potentially happen on the coast that, that we also have to
think about. And then we've recently as a, as a company, you know, we're looking at our
stewardship plan, our climate plan.
Jared Schmidt 32:26
Mhm.
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 32:27
You know, how do we participate in also mitigating some of those risks, right?
Jared Schmidt 32:32
Right.
Kate Lott 32:33
And whether it's sea level rise, and what that's going to do to, to the community here locally.
But also, you know, what, what can we do globally, in terms of reduction of greenhouse gases,
and climate mitigation is something that, you know, the dairy industry has to participate in, and
we definitely are looking at strategies, and how can we do the best thing going forward?
Jared Schmidt 32:57
Yeah.
Kate Lott 32:57
So, those, I mean, there's a lot of things that, that we talked about as a company that we're
working on, and, and it's it's no easy feat, that's or sure.
Jared Schmidt 33:07
How is your job...Does your your work align with trying to figure out what to do with climate
change, and on the farmers? And how was that discussion working with the farmers?
Kate Lott 33:22
Yeah, so farm services is part of the Stewardship Team at Tillamook. And so, we are a major
part, and a major player in our environmental work, and, and how that, how that crosses, you
know, our plants, our transportation, and our farms. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of pieces of
that puzzle. And so, we have an environmental team, that, that works on, you know, energy
savings in the plant in those, you know, waste and things in our plants. And we also talk about
transportation, right? We're looking at trucks that use natural gas, and those types of things.
And we have to take all those things to the farm as well.
Jared Schmidt 34:06
Yeah.
K
K
K
K
Yeah.
Kate Lott 34:07
A lot of the same things that we've done at the plant, we're working on in the farms.
Jared Schmidt 34:11
Okay.
Kate Lott 34:12
And that's energy savings, right? LED lights, temperature, you know, we're heating water, we're
cooling milk, can we use that energy both ways? And how do we efficiently do that? How do we
use our digesters, you know, that are producing electricity? How can we use more of them?
How can we use manure to, to, you know, generate energy?
Jared Schmidt 34:21
Mhm. Mhm.
Kate Lott 34:36
Is there an option for, you know, solar, wind? Obviously, we use a lot of hydroelectric electric
power in the Northwest in general. And so, that's where most of our power is coming from
anyway.
Jared Schmidt 34:49
Mhm.
Kate Lott 34:49
But, what are all the other options, right?
Jared Schmidt 34:52
Yeah.
Kate Lott 34:52
And how do we, how do we work on those things? I think in terms of cows, you know, cows get
K
K
K
K
K
And how do we, how do we work on those things? I think in terms of cows, you know, cows get
a bad rap. So, we have to, we have to manage the methane coming from cows. It's also a
biological system.
Jared Schmidt 35:05
Mhm.
Kate Lott 35:06
Right? It's not, it's not an engine. It's not burning fuel. It's, it's a biological system that's been
that way for 10,000 years.
Jared Schmidt 35:14
Mhm.
Kate Lott 35:14
So, we have to, we have to understand that, that its physiology.
Jared Schmidt 35:18
Right.
Kate Lott 35:19
And it's not just an engine, or some machine that we can, that we can alter or stop.
Jared Schmidt 35:26
Yeah.
Kate Lott 35:27
And so that's, that's something that, that people, I guess, I want them to think about, you know.
Jared Schmidt 35:32
Mhm.
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 35:32
And we could say, "Okay, no, you know, no cows in the world." But that's not necessarily the
best thing either.
Jared Schmidt 35:40
Right.
Kate Lott 35:41
Manure has a lot of great uses. And you can't have a lot of vegetable crops, especially organic
ones, without manure.
Jared Schmidt 35:50
Yeah.
Kate Lott 35:51
It's the only fertilizer that they can really use. And so, just thinking about the whole system
holistically, and how we can, how we can improve all parts of it.
Jared Schmidt 36:02
Mhm.
Kate Lott 36:02
So that's, that's what we're looking at. There's a lot of great things that our farmers are doing in
terms of carbon sequestration.
Jared Schmidt 36:09
Hmm.
Kate Lott 36:11
Growing grass is, is hugely beneficial. Obviously, growing trees is, as well. And so, our forestry
industry here in the county is also a big player in that and one that should be celebrated,
probably more than, than it is.
K
K
K
K
K
probably more than, than it is.
Jared Schmidt 36:25
Mkay.
Kate Lott 36:26
But the Ag ground to, a lot of, a lot of perennial grasses growing with really great soil health
and carbon sequestration. And we're not getting credit for it, you know, we're not, we're not
hearing that that's the benefit that we're going to be able to provide. And I think agriculture is
only now kind of risen to the top of like, it can be part of the solution.
Jared Schmidt 36:49
Yeah.
Kate Lott 36:49
And we are part of the solution. We just haven't measured all the parts that are, you know,
people are just trying to stay in business.
Jared Schmidt 36:56
Yeah.
Kate Lott 36:56
So as we start to measure that more, and I think there'll be this huge credit, carbon credit
market and money for that, and money for people that are farming that ground
Jared Schmidt 37:07
Mhm.
Kate Lott 37:08
well, and people that are growing trees and those kinds of activities. It's a big thing, it's not
something we're going to solve, like in one year. So...
Jared Schmidt 37:17
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 37:17
No. On top of, you know, the handful of things you mentioned already,
Kate Lott 37:21
Right. I mean, and that's the thing. Like, we're trying to make super delicious, safe, you know,
dairy products, and take care of cows, and you know, keep a 24/7-365 business going every
day.
Jared Schmidt 37:36
Mhm.
Kate Lott 37:36
And then, yeah, also save the world's climate.
Jared Schmidt 37:39
[Laughs] No big deal. Nothing, nothing going on.
Kate Lott 37:45
Right. I work a lot.
Jared Schmidt 37:48
What was that?
Kate Lott 37:49
That's why we work a lot.
Jared Schmidt 37:50
That's why you work a lot, right? Then I only have two more questions, and I'll let you go. When
you see Tillamook Cheese outside of the county, right? If you're traveling around the state or
wherever, and you see, like, a block of Tillamook Cheddar, what, what do you think? What
comes to mind when you see those products out and about?
Kate Lott 38:16
K
K
K
K
K
Kate Lott 38:16
Yeah, I think it's been amazing for me. I mean, I'm an Oregonian, grew up here, you know,
eating Tillamook. And, once I started working here, and definitely as we've gone national in the
last couple years, you know, just flying on a plane with some Tillamook shirt, or coat, or
whatever, and more and more people know, know the brand and know the products.
Jared Schmidt 38:39
Mhm.
Kate Lott 38:39
And, I mean, I was at a conference a month ago, you know, check into the hotel, and they're
like, "Oh, my gosh! The ice cream is so amazing!" And people just, it's part of the thing that I
think it makes it easier, maybe, to do all this work, and come to work when you realize people,
you know, we provide joy to people, with, in the form of ice cream, and really good cheese that
people talk about, and they love, and they've used, you know, with a family celebration, or. And
so, you know, I've never worked for a company that sold consumer products before, right?
Jared Schmidt 38:49
Mhm. Okay.
Kate Lott 39:16
And so, for me, that's the only experience I have, but there's people that work here that have
sold a lot of other stuff that's maybe just stuff.
Jared Schmidt 39:24
Yeah.
Kate Lott 39:24
Right? Or it doesn't bring that same level of joy to people.
Jared Schmidt 39:30
Right.
Kate Lott 39:30
K
K
K
K
K
And so, that's one of the things that I guess I notice every time I go somewhere else, or hear
from other people, "Oh, you know, I bought whatever ice cream or new flavor or I had cheese,"
or "Wow! You're aged cheddar" or whatever it is. It's, I mean that, that's what makes this job
really great. I think, a lot of the time, is just remembering that we're, we're providing food for
people which is important, and something I've been a part of my whole life. But, to have that
brand with that amount of happiness, I guess, attached to it is something definitely unique and
awesome.
Jared Schmidt 39:44
Mhm. That's super cool. Yeah, that's, my parents will send me picture messages from when
they're in the stores back in Minnesota and they see Tillamook Cheese,just like a, little like,
"Hey, look what we found!" or everything. That's super cool.
Kate Lott 40:25
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 40:26
And then one final question for you - What is your favorite cheese?
Kate Lott 40:34
That's hard. I mean, people ask me my favorite ice cream, too. Like, I am really not that picky. I
think I have about four different cheeses going in my fridge right now. I mean, so, just for
different stuff.
Jared Schmidt 40:47
Sames.
Kate Lott 40:47
Like, I love just a good medium cheddar for something. But I love sharp. I have a Habanero Jack
open. I mean, I'm, I like spice. So, it's really hard for me to choose. And the same on ice cream.
You know, I, it depends on the day. I had, I had vanilla on a brownie this weekend, you know
that was just perfect. But I love the chocolate peanut butter. I love Marionberry pie. I love
strawberry in the summer, you know, with fresh strawberries. So it's just, I guess I'm not picky
on our stuff. I, I love most of it.
Jared Schmidt 40:50
K
K
K
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I'm glad that I'm not the only one with multiple blocks of cheese open
in the fridge right now because.
Kate Lott 41:30
Oh, yeah, I'm, I'm ridiculous.
Jared Schmidt 41:33
[Laughs] I like it.
Kate Lott 41:36
You just never know what you're gonna want to, you know, use! Right? Yeah. Today could be a
pepperjack day and tomorrow could be a Swiss day. You don't know.
Jared Schmidt 41:46
Yeah.
Kate Lott 41:47
That's funny. Well, with that... You don't have to feel bad about not having a favorite. That's
what I think.
Jared Schmidt 41:51
What was that?
Kate Lott 41:53
You don't have to feel bad about not having a favorite, or one that you're always, like, is your
go to.
Jared Schmidt 41:58
Yeah.
Kate Lott 41:58
I think you should have, have them all!
K
K
K
K
K
I think you should have, have them all!
Jared Schmidt 42:00
Well, there we go. I like that. On that note, I will...I want to say thank you for your time, again,
for part two. And let's see if anything else I'll conclude the recording.
Kate Lott 42:14
Oh, you're very welcome.
Jared Schmidt 42:15
Thank you.
Kate Lott 42:15
It's been fun.
Jared Schmidt 42:16
Absolutely, thank, glad to hear it. Alrighty, let's stop this.
K
K
