Interviewee: Jeremy Purser [Kitchen Worker/Farm Worker/Graphic Designer/
Experimental Sound Artist/Musician] 
Interviewer: Jess Lamar Reece Holler 
Date of Interview: Sunday, July 23rd, 2017 
Location: Front Porch of the North Market, Columbus, Ohio 
SOUND QUALITY NOTE: The interviewer takes place outside, on the bustling “front porch” of the 
Historic North Market. Our interview is long; and, as such, the North Market shuts down around us mid-way 
through the interview. There are sounds of other patrons, general traﬃc from High Street, and sounds of trash bins 
being changed out by North Market maintenance and janitorial workers. It rains heavily during the middle hours 
of the interview. Two men begin a shouting altercation near the interview location half-way through the second 
recording. 
INTERVIEW NOTE:  Fellow kitchen worker Jacob Warren Reece Holler is present for the ﬁrst part of the 
interview, to shadow the interview process. 
Interview Index 
00:00:00 -- Introductory Slate // Interview Lede 
00:01:20 -- Early Life & Childhood: Goldsboro, North Carolina // Early Family Foodways 
& Inﬂuence of Mom’s Korean Heritage 
●
Born in Homestead, Florida; dad was in the Air Force and family relocated to South Korea 
brieﬂy before settling in to Goldsboro, North Carolina, where Jeremy went to school K-8
●
Family foodways: mostly chain restaurants around; mom made most of the meals -- she tried 
to make American food to suit Jeremy’s dad’s palette; but also made Korean food for herself; 
“it would be almost kind of like a little … a little self-assembled platter of picking from the 
two”; dad’s reaction to Korean food during Jeremy’s childhood; “now … this food is kind of 
fetishized”; food culture in Goldsboro
●
00:07:00 -- Early childhood interest in art (cartoons); playing baseball; piano and pursuit of 
music later on in high school
●
00:08:00 -- Initial interest in cooking/preparing food, in high school -- cooking eggs and 
omelettes; narrative about “making something really gross” (banana omelettes)
00:09:00 -- Late High School: Career Visions and Expectations // From Chemistry to 
Design 
●
00:09:00 -- Doing good in school and expectations of heading to college; service industry/
trade-oriented work was pretty much oﬀ the table; excelling at math and science in high 
school and got suggestions to go into engineering; discussion of the excellence of North 
Carolina state schools for engineering; Jeremy went to UNC instead, with the intention to 
study chemistry -- but this felt inﬂuenced by pressure from his parents and conversations 
with other people in the community; “once I was in school, I learned that it wasn’t really 
something I wanted to commit four years to ...  over even, like, looking at my week, going to 
classes … it just didn’t feel like something I wanted to do.” 
●
00:14:00 -- By junior year, got into classes speciﬁcally for the chemistry major; “it became 
obvious I didn’t want to do it … I stopped going to my classes … and I felt this terror of 
ruining my GPA … feeling the pressure of being locked into something I didn’t want to do”; 
took a medical withdrawal from the semester and took incompletes in all the classes; had to 
reapply to UNC for the next semester; interest in his studio art classes and consideration of 
transferring elsewhere or “just getting away” but dad was not super supportive of this; went 
back to school under pressure of not getting too far behind, but also because he had great 
friends at UNC and wanted to stay “on pace with them”
●
Didn’t work during undergrad; but did work at a Jersey Mike’s sub shop in Goldsboro at 
seventeen; and then also the summer after his freshman year at UNC
00:18:00 -- Flashback to First Kitchen Experiences: Working at Jersey Mike’s 
●
00:18:25 -- Working culture at Jersey Mike’s in Goldsboro; had started working there because 
other friends worked there; seventeen is too young to legally use the deli slicer, so underaged 
workers worked “down the line … putting the stuﬀ on the sandwich,” or running the cashier 
till or ﬂat-top grill for the hot sandwiches (cheesesteaks); enjoying working on the grill and 
“sort of developing my own style … or feeling very familiar with the motions, or the way the 
tools feel in my hand, or the diﬀerent moves”
●
00:21:00 -- Skill at Jersey Mike’s; making oﬀ-menu custom items on the grill during breaks 
from Jersey Mike’s; Jeremy’s self-reﬂection on holding that sub shop job, vis-a-vis his college 
career and larger self-conception; “... it just felt like this little compartment of my life, where 
I just show up to make money”
●
00:22:20 -- Discussion of minimum wage work ($5-something); moved his way up to 
something like $8/hour
00:23:00 -- Encounters with Food Culture in Chapel Hill (2004-2008) 
●
Jeremy discusses life in a college town just before “farm-to-table” went mainstream
●
Discusses being exposed to diﬀerent types of cuisines; Indian food
●
Favorite places: Pepper’s Pizza -- “the kind of place where, basically, all the local hipsters 
worked … and where they had, kind of, novelty pizza … [like] pulled pork barbeque, on a 
pizza”; Cosmic Cantina burrito place -- cheap, tasty, lots of food, close to the art building
●
00:25:00 -- Feeding himself during his college years; “I’m probably one of the weird people 
who still had a meal plan, even when I lived oﬀ-campus … I just didn’t want to bother with 
grocery shopping and cooking food at home; I just felt too consumed by school work to feed 
myself that way … and it just seemed nice to have a meal plan here I can go, you know … 
swipe myself in, and basically eat as much as I want.”
●
00:26:00 -- Eating habits in college // on the meal plan; the omelette station; “being very 
utilitarian and pragmatic … as far as nutrition”; eating a big bowl of “plain, unsalted, 
undressed spinach”; “eating with the idea of nourishment … not what was satisfying my 
palette, I guess.”
00:28:00 -- Coming Back to UNC: Switching into the Art Department 
●
Took classes through the journalism school (had some design elements) for a week; but 
quickly switched to the studio art department, where most of his friends were enrolled
●
Discussion of making the choice and having that conversation with his parents; “... maybe I 
realized alot of that pressure was just my perception; or my thoughts getting carried away 
with certain things I’d been hearing … they expressed they were supportive, whatever I 
wanted to do”
●
Parents paid for his college, with the aid of a small scholarship
●
00:31:00 -- Last year-and-a-half of college; impact of switching to the art program; drawing 
portraits with friends in the program; getting into printmaking (UNC had a wonderful 
printmaking facility)
●
00:32:30 -- Studying abroad his last semester, at the Glasgow School of Art; “... just put in a 
studio space, and expected to produce work”
●
00:33:00 -- Starting to Cook for Himself // Friends -- Moved oﬀ-campus with two friends, 
Will and Hunter; the trio ended up cooking together, “without much planning or 
scheduling”; narrative about trying to learn how to cook chicken all-the-way-through, so they 
wouldn’t get salmonella
00:35:00 -- Next Directions After College: Moving into Graphic Design // Getting a 
Second BA 
●
Jeremy started dating someone who was in the Design Program at NC state, and who was 
producing work at a larger scale (he was making small-scaled editioned art prints, etc.); 
interest in typography classes, etc.
●
Planned to get an MFA in graphic design; but talked to someone at NC State who suggested 
doing a “lateral transfer,” which essentially meant entering the school of design, and doing a 
second BA; design school at NC state is hyper-competitive; usually, to get the studio classes 
and their sequence, you’d have to do four more years. Jeremy applied for three more years, to 
do a BA in graphic design
●
Inﬂuence of his previous studio art training at UNC; being super-focused; “... there were a 
few of us who were very much, like … wanted to be the best … there wasn’t anything mean-
spirited about it; those people, we were drawn to each other. And that was fun.”
●
00:38:30 -- Why graphic design? Interest in objects and “creating a visual language”; and 
graphic design also answered the question of what Jeremy could do after college; lots of jobs 
in graphic design and lots of employable skills (-vs.- his studio art degree/experience; 
“...operating a printing press … it wasn’t really clear where I would go from there.”)
●
00:40:00 -- Description of the coursework in design at NC State; pursuit of internships and 
freelance projects; working on Windhover, NC State’s literary magazine, as the school’s junior 
designer; and then inheriting the role as the senior designer; directing the design of a very 
well-funded literary magazine (~20,000 copies); “... that, as a designer, gives you alot of 
leeway in what you can do with it … that’s sort of a dream come true.”
00:41:40 -- Changes in Personal Food Culture, Post-2008: Finding Farming in Raleigh 
●
Jeremy discusses he and his girlfriend’s increasing exposure to local foods movements in 
Raleigh; narrative about ordering their ﬁrst CSA
●
00:42:42 -- “shift in my eating paradigm” via going out to eat diﬀerent places; pushing against 
the way he was raised to eat (e.g., all meats had to be cooked all the way through, or yolks 
had to be cooked); realizing that “food can be diﬀerent, than what I had growing up.”
●
00:44:00 -- Description of that moment in North Carolina food culture; before the big rise 
of food journalism; Jeremy describes becoming more active in food organizing in the 
Triangle, via work with “Crop Mob … a network of land-less farmers”: donating labor to 
small-scale farms to help achieve big projects in a day, in exchange for a big dinner; “...it felt 
fun to do that work; to be around people who share these ideals … and have that community 
dinner at the end of the day, after all that hard work. It felt like a nice relief from my regular 
day-to-day … which was sitting in front of my computer, working on graphic design 
projects.”
●
Exposure to permaculture and alternative agriculture came largely through his girlfriend; 
many other design students just liked eating at the Taco Bell on campus
●
00:47:30 -- Labor culture in graphic design; more about “being the best” than about being 
compensated for labor; working on a farm felt more “vital and necessary”; this exposure to 
farming gave him “cold feet” about ﬁnishing the graphic design degree, but he thought it was 
necessary to “follow through and ﬁnish”
●
00:50:00 -- On watching the food network/food television, and being motivated to learn 
cooking particular types of cuisine; narrative about new dishes in Jeremy and his girlfriend’s 
repertoire -- “a portabella mushroom dish, just with … tomato sauce, and cheese”; making 
risotto
●
00:52:30 -- Mom’s reactions to Jeremy’s interest in cooking, and her “reinvention of herself” 
after Jeremy was out of the house: started cooking and seeking out other recipes and making 
new meals
●
00:53:00 -- Jeremy describes “going in and out of being vegetarian, at the time”; his parents’ 
reactions to this; discussions with his family about what vegetarian alternatives would be; 
mom’s interest and growing “obsession” with gardening, since her retirement; volunteering 
with other “food rescue” organizations and sharing, with his mom, about his CSA 
subscription
00:55:30 -- Moving On From Raleigh: “Perma-Lancing” in Graphic Design // Food Work 
in NYC 
●
Jeremy describes wanting to move on from North Carolina after his graphic design work; 
taking “food trips” to cities like Portland and NYC; visiting David Cheng’s restaurants in 
NYC when he was an up-and-coming-restaurateur
●
Worked one day of an internship; and then joined up with a temping agency in graphic 
design; got a “perma-lancing” gig at Practical  Law Company on an indeﬁnite contract for 6 
months; then was oﬀered a full-time position; “... the work, at least, was related to print, 
which was what I was trying to do … but I really didn’t like the job; the only reason that I 
took the job was it was the job I needed to survive; to pay my rent …”; working on a monthly 
magazine and supplement magazine on particular branches of law [Recording paused due to 
trash bins being cleaned out in the location of the interview]
●
01:00:00 -- “My experience in the workforce … wasn’t what I imagined it would be like”; 
discussion of “boutique studios” and boutique graphic design culture; “... those jobs are 
relatively few and far between …”; discussion of how more people are hired for web/
interactives, or as in-house designers for certain ﬁrms; good portfolio, but didn’t have any 
networking or connections in NYC, which, for Jeremy, seemed like what was helping people 
get jobs; discussion of diﬀerences in graphic design degree programs in NYC (faculty work 
full-time in NYC and teach part-time; Jeremy’s professors, at NC state, were full-time 
faculty)
●
01:02:04 -- quitting the design job; and becoming a producer for a comedy podcast via a 
friend, with a little bit of graphic design; mostly lived oﬀ savings, “... knowing I needed to 
ﬁnd a job”
●
01:03:20 -- Began looking under Craigslist under the Food/Beverage/Hospitality section; felt 
like this was something that other young people were doing, and that might relieve him from 
the feeling of being trapped doing work he didn’t want to do; applied at Court Street 
Grocers -- “to me, it just sounded like a neighborhood grocery store”; ended up being an 
artisan grocery owned by two art-school grads; “they sell more boutique items … but also, 
they get pastries from diﬀerent bakeries in the city … [and] they make most of their money 
selling sandwiches”
●
Description of the interview with the chef; “it was probably one of the best interviews I’d 
had”; much more concerned about the food Jeremy was making at home and what he grew 
up eating, more-so than what his resume was; beneﬁts of being able to be taught to work in 
the kitchen … narrative about remembering the Jersey Mike’s job at the very end of the 
interview

workplace -- “I feel like I spoke more Spanish there, than English.”
●
01:08:00 -- Making breakfast sandwiches; getting to know regulars at the shop
●
01:09:00 -- “It felt like I was doing work that was ten times harder … for like half the pay; 
but the money part didn’t really matter that much to me … but I felt happier; the fruition of 
my work was someone putting in their order, and me making their sandwich they were gonna 
eat. And it felt nice that it was that simple, to see an emotional response to it, too … I mean, 
alot of these people looked very happy …”
●
01:11:00 -- Sense of pride in being able to conquer a big line; “it just felt good, to be able to 
do something well … like, I didn’t need any acknowledgement … just the fact that I was 
getting it done: it felt like its own reward.”
●
Discussion of fastness and speed as a critical part of being good at the job; perfectionism; “... 
there’s something mesmerizing about seeing them work with their hands”; discussion of the 
grace of watching his co-workers’ sense of coordination and working steps ahead; discussion 
of “work with tongs” and the skill of his co-worker Ruben; Spanish nicknames in the

●
01:18:00 -- Accommodating substitutions at Court Street Grocers [short pause]; common

that”; innovating specials to get rid of extras
●
01:21:00 -- Management styles and getting along at Court Street; wages and tips (Court 
Street was in a nice neighborhood and people tipped pretty generously); getting mugged -- 
Court Street fronted Jeremy some cash; avoiding talking about money in the workplace -- 
awkwardness of not knowing what other co-workers were making [quick pause]
●
“I had this background in graphic design … if I wanted to make more money, I guess I could 
…”; Jeremy sort of expected that the low wage came with the territory

City 
●
01:25:00 -- Networking and socialization outside of work; getting involved in comedy and

Street; feeling seen as a full person at work: “it felt like I could be myself”
●
01:27:30 -- Moving to a diﬀerent neighborhood, because he wasn’t able to aﬀord it on the 
wages; had been living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn; and then abruptly moved into a cheaper 
place
●
Diﬃculties in holding a diﬀerent schedule than friends with 9-5 work schedules; Jeremy 
worked every weekend and couldn’t be a part of weekend activities with friends
●
01:28:50 -- Discussion of work day and shifts at Court Street; always 8-hour shifts; typical 
shift was 10-6:30; morning shifts were called by people who had worked there longer.

01:33:00 -- Jeremy’s home meals during his Court Street Grocers days
●
01:34:00 -- Working in comedy in New York City; and aspiring to make it to a writers’ room 
for a comedy TV show; kitchen work started out as something that paid the bills, but it 
became, for Jeremy, “something more than that … I got a lot more out of it than just paying 
the bills”; brief discussion of the prestige of working at a known and popular food 
establishment
●
01:35:25 -- Leaving New York City: dating someone living in the Hudson Valley; anxiety about 
safety in NYC following being mugged; “feeling drained” from the work, commitments to a 
comedy group and comedy shows; and being in a band
01:36:00 -- Moving to the Hudson Valley: Farming and Modern Farmer // Hudson Valley 
Food Culture 
●
Visiting the Hudson Valley on his days oﬀ, to visit his new girlfriend; Jeremy really liked the 
Hudson Valley and being around where food was being grown
●

signed a lease in the Hudson Valley; was oﬀered a job in graphic design
●

… their aesthetic was totally up my alley … I was really excited to work there.”
●
01:40:00 -- Explaining kitchen work to a new graphic design job; how to position this work, 
while moving between kitchen work and design work as careers? Mostly, Jeremy described 
freelancing and doing creative work during that time period
●
01:43:00 -- Co-workers’ comment: why work a low-paid job, with a college degree? 
Continuing to work this kind of a job -- “what keeps you?” // “I think I’ve just decided for 
myself that money doesn’t matter enough to put me in a job I don’t like; and I feel like I’ve 
met enough people that just will … they’ll just work jobs they don’t like, and spend alot of 
their time talking about how much they don’t like their job. But I feel like … I could go do 
something that makes a lot less money; and maybe that’s a job I don’t like, but it at least has 
alot less impact on my life. Because I think these sort of oﬃce jobs, where the sort of 
fruition of the work takes a lot more time … it’s really hard to separate from your time 
outside the oﬃce …”
●
01:44:30 -- Work culture at Modern Farmer; “this was literally work I was taking home”; 
discussion of long days and project-based work
●
“I think my time’s just more valuable than any salary could be, if I’m interested in other

and other groceries to stock up for the home kitchen
●
01:51:50 -- Receptions of Modern Farmer magazine in the Hudson Valley; relationship between

of “schism … between my personal life … and what the magazine is actually trying to portray”
●
01:53:55 -- Narrative about conversation over drinks with a co-worker, about how the staﬀ at 
Modern Farmer is “doing something ancillary,” but making way more money than actual 
farmers; Jeremy’s feeling that journalism/hype work about farming (like restaurants) proﬁts 
oﬀ the backs of the farmers; comparison of this to the restaurant industry; role of 
storytelling vis-a-vis the actual work in the food and farm movement: “ … is everything we’re 
producing necessary?” [sounds of rain! Lots of pausing due to intense rain]
●
01:57:00 -- “If I’m interested in food, what would be better?: for me to do graphic design 
about food, or to actually just work with food? Like, why am I putting up a buﬀer, or doing 
this circuitous path to being involved with it?”

II // Brassica Interviews // Baking Work at Dough Mama // Natalie’s Coal-Fired Pizza  
[heavy rainfall] 
●
Planned to move to Columbus without a job lined up; expected he could just ﬁnd a job in the 
food industry, given his experience at Court Street Grocers
●
Initial impressions of Columbus: had visited a few times to see his girlfriend’s family; had 
visited the North Market, and Northstar Café; his girlfriend had pitched Columbus’s food 
scene as a reason to move there; “... new and interesting restaurants opening, so I had this 
very loose idea what it was like: a city, with alot of people opening restaurants all the time”
●
02:01:33 -- What he found when he got here; disingenuous employment of “farm-to-table”; 
many restaurants still have a “corporate feel … or corporate way of operating”; not the same 
as his experience at Court Street Grocers, even though they owned multiple establishments 
●
02:03:13 -- Discussion of Northstar Café and their signiﬁcance in the Columbus food/
restaurant ecology; applying for work at their sister restaurant, Brassica -- “a fast-casual 
Mediterranean place” [end of Pt. 1 of the recording]; attending an open interview
●
00:00:18 (Pt. 2) -- open interview process at Brassica; owners were impressed by Jeremy’s 
resume and experience at Court Street, and he was oﬀered a position as an opening team 
member of the restaurant; opening was delayed and he was “very turned oﬀ” by the 
orientation: “... way more regulations than I would expect for a place where I’d be going to 
work and making eight dollars and ﬁfty cents: they would have some say that I should be 
clean-shaven everyday, or that I should have no visible tattoos; it just didn’t seem like that 
kind of job, or that amount of money, warrants that restriction in my life. So I just decided, 
after that ﬁrst orientation, that I wasn’t going to work there.” 
●
00:02:14 -- Befriending Perry, from NYC, who was in the process of opening a brick-and-
mortar storefront for Dough Mama; got called to work for her right before she opened the 
storefront; hired to work for her as her assistant at her house; “trickiness” of that experience 
-- impact of working/baking at the owner’s home: “the distinction of workplace and her 
personal life felt precarious to navigate”; navigating management styles for new/upstart 
business-owners; gaining baking experience and learning new kitchen skills [even more rain]; 
no set schedule -- “it was very unpredictable”; diﬃculty of learning without being able to get 
into repetition/a workﬂow; “... I didn’t really feel like I was being set-up for success, you 
know?” 
●
00:06:24 -- Negotiating work with/for a friend; handling wages in those situations -- initially 
oﬀered $10/hour to bake with Perry; “I remember, I was making $10/hour in New York City 
… so, it seemed to me at the time, at least as a starting pay, pretty decent.”
●
00:07:30 -- Navigating getting enough hours to make enough money to survive; taking a 
second job working at Natalie’s Coal Fired Pizza, in Worthington; becoming their new 
“dough-shift person”; making pizza dough; discussion of being trained by the person who was 
leaving in that role -- was let go from Dough Mama baking position close to the opening of 
the brick-and-mortar. Jeremy felt some relief, but also “a little bit hurt, and a little bit 
bothered … it felt like, for her to call me and ask me to work for her, I thought there was the 
sense of commitment that there was going to be a job for me, once she opened her store; and 
I just felt, sort of … kicked to the curb … it just felt, kinda surprising, really. I felt kinda 
surprised that that happened. And I guess it just put a sour taste in my mouth … because … I 
think alot of people just think of their business as their product; but, I think the way you 
treat your employees is a huge part of that.” 
●
Discussion of rapport between workers and restaurant/business owners, and comparison of 
these relationships in Columbus to Jeremy’s experience at Court Street Grocer; discussion of 
Zingerman’s Lapsed Anarchist’s Approach to Building a Business; importance of both employees 
and customers feeling a sense of ownership in the business; importance, for customers 
(Jeremy thinks) of seeing the same employees every time, and allow for relationships to be 
built between customer and worker

smoking/vaping culture amongst kitchen workers at Natalie’s; discussion of inﬂuence of 
orders coming in through a computer system, as compared to face-to-face (like at Court 
Street) -- discussion of how face-to-face ordering, at Court Street, builds rapport with 
customers and sense of satisfaction in the job; “... this [Natalie’s] was my ﬁrst time working

Natalie’s -- “it was kind of structured so that we’d just take turns doing dishes”; role of the 
manager/chef back-of-house as “the last eyes on the food”; training culture at Natalie’s
00:31:46 (Pt. 2) -- Transition to Paulie Gee’s: From One Pizza Place to Another; And: 
Wages 
●
Reasons for leaving Natalie’s: didn’t like the music venue part of it; a diﬃcult co-worker who 
didn’t put any work in; depressing atmosphere
●
Description of the history and origins of Paulie Gee’s in the Short North (a franchise of a 
popular Brooklyn pizza place -- the ﬁrst to open outside of New York)

Excitement about working in the Short North; “seemed a lot more of the place to be”; 
discussion of the “coolness factor” of going to work at a place like Paulie Gee’s
●
00:33:21 -- joining the opening team at Paulie Gee’s; ﬁguring out the inexperience of the 
owner (very young; had met Paulie’s in Columbus after graduating with a hospitality degree 
from OSU and decided to open a restaurant, after going to NYC to work at the original 
Paulie Gee’s for a year); diﬃculty in working with an inexperienced owner; narrative about 
owner’s emotional outbursts in the workplace
●
00:35:00 -- wages at Paulie Gee’s: promised $13/hour in the interview, plus hourly food bonus, 
as a way to compensate for the fact that front-of-house takes home alot more money from 
tips: “someone working front-of-house on two busy nights could probably take home what 
someone back-of-house could make in a week”; paycheck was broken down into prep and 
service … and Jeremy was only getting paid $10 and $11 an hour, for prep and service; was 
promised that this would be “ﬁxed,” or was given extra cash some weeks; “... eventually, it 
became $12/hour; but there was still a diﬀerent with the prep hours … then eventually, I was 
getting paid $12 for all the work. And it wasn’t until April, four months in, that I was getting 
$13 an hour. And I was told that would be my starting pay. And it was pretty frustrating to 
work there that whole time, and, basically: being lied to.”
●
00:39:37 -- Conversations about pay with Paulie Gee co-workers; wages were something that 
could be talked about at Paulie Gee’s; but Jeremy felt that other co-workers were more 
“pushed over” and wanted to wait it out and see if it would get better
●
Oﬀered an opportunity to work in the graphic design world again via a short-term contract; 
“I could go somewhere that would pay what they tell me they’re going to pay me.” Made 
“almost quadruple” hourly, as compared to work in Columbus kitchens.

●
Comparison between Columbus food ecologies and the food ecologies in the Hudson Valley; 
“hobby farms” in the Hudson Valley, -vs.- intense competition facing small-scale Columbus 
farms; “real” farms competing with grant-funded non-proﬁt farms at farmers’ market with 
radically diﬀerent access to funds; diﬀerences in wages between non-proﬁt farms and for-
proﬁt farms; apprenticeship work on farms
●
00:45:00 “My impression of it is … this was very much the wild west: frontier, no holds 
barred; people were just kinda making up their own rules … [whether] they were actually 
good for the community, or not. But of course, it’s all put forth with the rhetoric that it is 
good for the community … but I feel like what I ﬁnd alot of is farmers who want to do it the 
right way feeling frustrated”
●
Connections between wage/branding concerns in the agriculture scene and the restaurant 
scene; discussion of “locavore” branding; critique of out-of-state gourmet grocery empire 
Lucky’s Market and their role in putting the Clintonville Co-op out of business (yet claiming 
to be “local”)

graphic design contract (2016); work for Great River Organics farm co-op warehouse, 
packing and delivering wholesale and CSA orders
●
00:48:45 -- Work at Great River Organics (GRO) Co-op; discussion of the co-op model; 
“collection of farmers who came up together in the same farmers’ markets in Columbus; they 
wanted to be able to have a bigger thumb-print on Columbus, and they saw the co-op model 
as a way to do that … individually, none of them would have been able to have any kind of 
contract with, like, Whole Foods; but, by pulling their resources together, they’re able to do 
that; they also share costs and materials … the cost of the warehouse, where they’re storing 
their food and its being delivered from … so, it seems like an initiative they took, to be able 
to play ball with the local food economy … GRO sort of positioned themselves as their own 
food distributor.”
●
Workplace environment under a co-operative economic structure? As a non-worker-owner; 
company was designed as a co-op, but that didn’t necessarily impact Jeremy’s role as an 
employee [Pause because some dudes are having a dispute by the ATM nearby]; taking initiative in 
negotiating for higher wages in the GRO work -- was advertised as $10/hour; discussion of 
cultures of navigating for higher wages; discussion of externalization of having to ask for 
raises to the kitchen worker (not part of a structure of the industry, from management/
owners)
00:55:00 -- Kitchen Labor Ecologies Under Capitalism:  Workers’ Rights & the 
Restaurant Industry 
●
00:55:00 -- Discussion of Jeremy’s rising consciousness re: the politics of kitchen work and 
wages under capitalism; “... I feel like, I mean, I guess, especially now, having ﬂipped between 
jobs: it’s like -- … it’s not really clear to me why, if I do labor as a graphic designer … why it 
somehow warrants alot more pay … I mean, I guess there’s training involved …”
●
00:57:40 -- Leaving Great River Organics; “it was, truly, back-breaking work”; discussion of 
warehouse job culture; narrative about working with a psychologically unstable co-worker, 
who came back to work at the workplace after several psychological episodes at work; Jeremy 
was assigned all shifts with this person without being consulted; ultimately, he left the job 
without notice
●
01:01:15 -- Narrative about leaving the job at Great River Organics; discussion of the two-
weeks’ notice as “purely courtesy” and courtesy between employees/owners in the food 
system workplace
●
01:02:00 -- Encountering discourses around worker rights in Jeremy’s time as a kitchen 
worker; “I think I could accept that the wages are low and the work is really hard; but when 
there are incidences that exceed that tolerance, I’m not willing to stay in the job. If 
someone’s going to lie to me about my pay rate or be complicit with unstable co-workers … 
but, yeah: the idea of workers’ rights: I feel like that has never come from the work 
environment itself or from co-workers; it’s stuﬀ I’ve had to seek out or ﬁnd on my own.”
●
01:03:40 -- Inﬂuence of the 2016 election; “... understanding that all these modes of 
operation stem from capitalism”; move into anti-capitalist politics and research into “what 
exists to help workers” in the kitchen industry
●
01:04:52 -- Post-Great River Organics; connection to Little Eater food stand inside the 
North Market; didn’t need to interview because he knew other people who worked there
01:05:55 -- Kitchen Cultures at Little Eater // The North Market; Economic Injustices in 
Kitchen Work & Attempting to Organize the Workplace through ROC (Restaurant 
Opportunities Center) United 
●
“They were very empathic about the type of work, that might be diﬀerent than what I am 
used to or what I have seen, because it’s like: very long, process-oriented projects”
●
01:06:30 -- Description of Little Eater (“produce inspired”): vegetarian food, but without 
“vegetarian” in the branding; “showcasing the work of farmers”; “trying to get as much 
organic vegetables as they can … as close to Columbus as they can”; fast casual/grab-and-do 
style: “ … sort of set out deli-style, where you’re getting a scoop of a quinoa salad, or a kale 
salad …”
●
01:08:02 -- Description of work at Little Eater; lots of long prep tasks
●
01:10:25 -- Wanting “the type of work I was doing … reﬂected in the compensation”; started 
oﬀ at a base pay of $10/hour plus tips; but the tips were minimal, because of the style of 
service; other people were started out with less
●
01:13:00 -- Changes in culture of shift meals ($12 credit) at a meeting with the owner 
recapping 2016 victories, partnership with Local Matters (local non-proﬁt) encouraging 
employees to volunteer with them, opening of new store, and revision of policy and beneﬁts 
… including; removal of vacation and sick day policies; and revision of the shift meal -- could 
no longer get quiches, etc.; “I perceived this as my compensation being degraded; I saw that 
$12 meal credit as sort of rounding out the $10 I was making per hour …”; insurance in 
kitchen work // surviving oﬀ Medicaid

workers in the restaurant industry for economic justice in the workplace

other co-workers were afraid and didn’t want to risk a bad recommendation, or losing future 
opportunities with the company
●
01:20:20 -- “Honestly, I don’t think what I wanted was very much: if we could restore that 
food credit … and honestly, what choice would they have? Like, if they saw this letter, with all 
our signatures, that was poignant about what we wanted, and why we wanted it? And just to 
make it clear that the relationship between employers and managers is … we understand 
what we do the best; so we should have some say in our compensation.”
●
01:22:40 -- Discussion of the Fight for Fifteen; “Bernie Sanders says it all the time … if you 
work forty hours a week, you should be able to live.”
●
“As that letter says, it is alienating to be putting your work behind food … that you’re not 
able to have.”
●
01:23:42 -- Continuing to work at Little Eater after fellow co-workers declined to organize; 
impact on his work ethic and sense of camaraderie; “I think it was a form of micro-protest to 
be less productive, after that … I just could not tolerate … can I say bullshit?”
●
Narrative about conversation following a co-worker’s derisive comments about the eﬃcacy 
of a Columbus demonstration against Trump’s Muslim ban
●
01:26:25 -- Second narrative, about owner Cara Mangini’s book, The Vegetable Butcher, being 
nominated for a James Beard Award, and the diﬃculties of workplaces that expect that 
renown will make up for low wages; “ … management does expect the workers to kind of 
share in the prestige; and that’s sort of making up for not making much money. But I feel like 
that … does not work on me at all … and my co-worker was like, ‘Well, maybe that’s 
something you could put on your resume.’ And I was like, ‘For what? To get another job, 
where I’ll get $10/hour?’ My boss having a James Beard nomination does not give me any 
upward mobility; it doesn’t help me at all.”
●
01:28:34 -- On learning to communicate/speak clearly in the workplace; discussing concerns 
with his assistant manager after the main Little Eater meeting; was told he was heard, but 
follow-up meeting made it feel ineﬀective
●
01:28:57 -- Narrative about discussing workplace concerns with an assistant manager: “She 
was like, ‘If there’s anything we can change, let me know.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I feel like I 
have let you know: that I want the food credit to be restored. I feel like I have let you know, 
that we should all be paid more. These are … that’s exactly what I’m doing. I’m letting you 
know.’ And she’s like, ‘Oh, if we went back on the food credit, we’d be going backwards.’ And 
I was like, ‘No, actually what you did to take away the food credit -- that’s going backwards. 
Like: you’ve already said it backwards. You’re taking away things. That’s going backwards. 
What I’m proposing is a step forward.’”
●
01:30:08 -- Discussion of Jeremy’s meeting with Little Eater owner Cara Mangini, who 
wanted to know the story of his “arc” that got him to Little Eater; on managing to “shift the 
conversation to the things I wanted to talk about … if part of her business plan or brand or 
mission statement … part of it literally is, in documents, saying that the employees take pride 
in their work, and oﬀering good customer experiences to people … [but]: I basically told her, 
you can’t just wish for those things, and make unilateral decisions that are depriving people 
of the opportunity of having a say in what our compensation is here”; discussion of the 
owner’s response and reaction; discussion of the owner’s more privileged background: “... and 
she somehow still looked at me, and said the words: ‘The struggle is real.’” Socialist analysis 
of this encounter. 
●
01:34:00 -- Continued working there from February until June; but his performance 
degraded as a result of these encounters, and not feeling heard; second meeting -- being 
oﬀered a potential position at the soon-to-be-opened second restaurant; “What she had to 
oﬀer me was something that didn’t exist … the question she asked me, was: ‘Are you ready to 
commit to growing with this restaurant?’ … and my response was, ‘You haven’t show me 
anything to commit to. Because what I’ve sen, is compensation being taken away.’”
●
01:36:00 -- On positivity/negativity in the workplace [short pause]
01:37:22 -- Learning to Organize/Considering Workplace Justice; and the Larger Work 
Environment of the (Historic) North Market 
●
01:38:38 -- Comparing wages/culture across diﬀerent North Market stands
●
Being stuck in the kitchen; not interacting with customers
●
Little Eater’s justiﬁcation on the food credit reduction was going around and surveying other 
stands at the North Market about what their food compensation policy was (50%)
●
Discussion of solidarity in kitchen work; and epidemic of economic justice and low-wage 
issues in workplaces; “... it seems like, most places, their aspiration is not to do the one thing 
and do it well; it’s to expand.”
01:42:06 -- Reﬂections on His Time in Kitchen Work: Identity, Organizing, Access to 
Alternative Work // Visions and Provocations for Columbus Restaurant Industry 
Futures; Affordances 
●
“I’ve never been one to identify myself with my occupation … for one, I’ve changed it pretty 
often”; Little Eater was his longest job, in Columbus
●
Self-identity as working class; “even doing graphic design, I’m still selling my labor.”
●
“In terms of a stranger asking me what I do, I don’t think my job at Little Eater would be the 
ﬁrst thing I tell them … I feel like other things are more important to me, like making music, 
or making art; expressing my interest in food beyond any sort of wage job.”
●
01:44:48 -- Learning how to organize and stand up in the workplace; how did Jeremy learn 
how to do this? Any inspirations or models?
●
“I’m not sure I’ve learned to organize yet. I mean, I attempted to …”; mentorship from ROC 
United; “and, I think, just hearing about workers’ rights”; connections thru Twitter and via 
involvement of the Columbus Chapter of the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and 
their series for prospective members; good venue to “express these feelings, and understand 
them in the context of people who can imagine a society where people are paid enough to 
live.”
●
01:47:00 -- Wishes for the future of the Columbus restaurant industry; “I don’t know if it’s 
better understanding or more honesty; but it’s -- if you’re speaking about your restaurant or 
business, like it’s for the community? I really hope you understand that, your employees? 
That’s community, right. And to keep them at a poverty wage, is causing the community to 
suﬀer …” 
●
Not a problem of there not being models for this sort of restaurant; it’s just about “whether 
the other ones choose to follow it, or not”
●
Discussion of complicity of customers/diners in low wages for back-of-house workers; “... and 
obviously, it’s cheaper for them to buy it, when the employees don’t make very much money.”
●
Wanting to see people go out to eat less; distrust/dislike of Columbus restaurants seeking out 
to build empires of several restaurants
●
01:49:59 -- Skepticism about the hype around restaurants using organic/local produce: “And I 
guess that’s great; but who’s it for, though? It’s for people who can aﬀord to pay other people 
to make their food. It’s not for someone like me. And least not in my current moment …” 
●
“If every person who came to this restaurant to buy salad -- if they spent that much money at 
farmers’ markets, they’d be getting way more food; and the farmers would be getting way 
more money.” 
●
01:52:40 -- “I’ve been lucky in that I’ve been able to create these escape routes for myself … 
for when I do want to hit the eject button; but for alot of people, that’s just not the case. 
They have to get a job somewhere else, for a similar amount of money.
●
01:53:00 -- Discussion of the invisibilization of worker’s lives and struggles, vis-a-vis the 
celebrity and wealth aﬀorded to Columbus restaurateurs 
●
01:54:50 -- Aﬀordances of kitchen work and why he sticks around; “I think the aﬀordance is 
just being at a place where part-time is an option”

North Carolina 
●
Deﬁning aspects of the Columbus kitchen community

“Several jobs … I felt very exploited, in that: I’m not necessarily treated like a person. I’m 
just the amount of labor I produce, for the price they name”; comparison to the job at Court 
Street
●
02:02:00 -- “I feel bad … because I think I did have a bad reaction to the city; and I had a 
hard time adjusting”; praises the good people in Columbus; but “I’m not from here.”
●
Corporate supremacy as “... a huge ghost, that’s haunting this town.”
●
Parallels with his wider history of work within the restaurant industry; things restaurants 
claim about themselves (local, organic, etc.) “... is not something they feel motivated to give; 
it’s something they are taking”
●
00:00:00 (Pt. 3) -- reﬂections on changes in how Jeremy thought about and pursued food 
culture;
●
Inﬂuence of Instagram, social media, etc., on kitchen culture; complicity in keeping the 
work behind-the-scenes invisible
●
00:02:15 (Pt. 3) -- Aﬀordances: kitchen work as craft; learning and marking his own learning 
and growth in skill; kitchen work as an educational experience; “such a tiny victory … 
compared to the other stuﬀ”
●
“I’m not sure I believe in the worth of a restaurant … that’s what I’d like to see more in the 
real food system; feeling like Columbus is at capacity for restaurants
●
00:04:30 -- Would like to see an antidote for feelings of ineﬃcacy in the workplace re: 
kitchen organizing; “I guess I would like to see some sort of awakening … not even just 
kitchen workers, but all workers: they have power, you know? You’re selling your labor for a 
wage. And you have the power to withhold that labor. But as long as you keep producing it … 
within the terms that are given you … things won’t change if you don’t do anything. That’s a 
guarantee.” 
●
00:07:00 -- On the maintenance of a system where kitchen workers feel like things won’t 
change; managing feeling “adversarial”; and relief in putting in his notice to Little Eater
●
