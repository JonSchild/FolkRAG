SHINE ON. 
As originally Fling by Luxt SenooLenArr, 585 Broadway. 
MONKEY dressed in soldier clothes, 
All cross over to Jordan, 
Went out in the woods to drill some crow* 
Oh I 
Jerualem; 
Jay bird sat on a 
hickory limb, 
All cross over to Jordan, 
I 
up with a 
rock and hit him in the tilitn, 
Oh! Jerusalem. 
Cum-x.

Ohl Jerusalem. 
Shine on, &c. 
My old master lived in clover, 
All cross over to Jordan. 
When he died he rolled right over, 
Oh! Jerusalem;

All cross over to Jordan, 
lie '
sired these niggers half to death, 
Oh I 
Jerusalem. 
Shine on, tte. 
JUST look of dot gal, she's as sweet as the honey bee. 
And her voice is as pure as the sound of a 
bell; 
Her eyes are like stars and twinkle so gently, 
She's as beautiful as the violets that bloom in the dell. 
With a 
blush on her cheek 
Precious words she did speak, 
The smiling love-light o'er her features played merrily. 
In happiness we'll dwell 
Now down by dot dell, 
Well sing songs of love and dance away cheerily— 
She's a 
gay young deitcher gal and is fond of variety, 
She can dance, she can sing, and is merry you see, 
My Louisa is handsome !Ind I 
like her society, 
No other young gal is more happy than she, 
As sung by L. SCHOOLCRAFT.

I'VE been walking around this big city, 
I'm so tired I 
scarcely can jag, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
When ever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order me out there and then, 
And say that I'm drunk and h2d my El, 
And they've nicknamed ma Old Snooner ren. 
Once I 
was in good eii•camstnace.,4 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
last all by t:'..king the chances, 
And bad Lck t,•:ruck Cid Snoczcr Den. 
I'm ralting--I'm 
I'm locking for scare friends to corn; 
It's 1;roval:In:,---I .in 
Um shaking fcr one class cf rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
tat they ncycr do so any mc,..:;_%. 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
is they had many poor fools they meet, 
S 
9 • 
But now-a-days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I 
ve noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and aint any dimes now, 
He's as bad off as 01(1 Snoozer Ben. 
CHORDS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
In hopes that some old frkirl I'd meet., 
Only think now—One drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat. 
I 
feel that I'm fast growing weaker. 
If only I 
had just a 
drop, 
My poor wife, oh ! how can I 
seek her, 
Oh ! rum—rum, oh ! why can't I 
stop.. 
What figures are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and child, 
They are starving at home—oh! dear me, 
Give me Brandy or I 
shall go wild--
But no, I 
must banish this madness, 
And try he a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladness, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
Cuonus. 
I 
must bear it—I 
swear It, 
No liquor fcr me e'er again, 
No slit-inking—or drinking, 
So pattern from Old Sncozer Den. 
STUMP SPEECH, 
Written by E. MoNTAGUE for L. SCII0OLCnAFT. 
LADIES AND GENIEN: 
Dis yer world wasn't made in 24 hours! was de las words of 
the greatest man dat ever lived—Daniel Lambert 
He weighed 
800 poun:ls, and on his death bed vented himself of these words, 
that will live long after the English language shall be forgotten 
and watermelons cease to grow in Jersey: " Dis yer world 
wasn't made in 21 hours." I 
tell you ladies und gemmen, dares 
a 
heap of wisdom in dat yer little centence! we is told we must 
have faith; so we does, but don't we all on us reason by analy-
gy ? you all knows, of course, what that is, don't yer? well, if 
yer don't, Pse sure I 
can't tell yer; but we reasons by analygy, 
dat is by comparison. 
Now we sees things every day, and we 
compares wot we see und what we hears, and dat's analygy. 
Don't we all on us read what Geo. Francis says, und is dare 
any analygy between dat and sense ? 
I 
guess not. 
When we 
sees a 
Circus bill, don't we read it? mid when we gits inside de 
show don't we compare what we sees with wot the bill said dar 
was to see, und ain't that 'nalogy? only dis tune ' nalogy gets 
the worst of the trade. 
Feller citizen, can L
-ou make an actor 
like Monte Chiste in 24 hours? 
No sir-ee, you know you can't; 
you couldn't pick up so much broken English in 24 weeks— so 
dat it goes to prove conclusively dat the world was not made in 
24 hours—by analygy. 
And yet, he is not happy, but wants a 
Theatre on 11th Street. 
Ilic jacket sock resque at in penean-
dim. 
Once ; nom, can you finish a 
Post Office, a 
Boat House, 
or even an East River bridge in 24 hours ? 
Can you git quick 
transit up town in less than 21 hours ? 
1 
tell yer, feller suffer-
ers, that yer can't do it. 
Haven't yer had the wisest heads in 
the country try, even down to Gaim with his stickin' plasters, 
and Gayety with his medicated paper. 
And is there no relief ? 
None but nadway'sc at least that's ready; and don't this all go 
te show dat this world was not made in 24 hours? if don't, 
• 
10 
what on earth does it show? 
Fellow elbow crookers! can you 
even wish the new Charter and the Civil Service Reform make 
an honest man in 24 hours? 
No! yer know yer can't. 
But let 
an honest man be elected to any office, I 
don't care how little 
one ' tis, and he's a 
dishonest man in less than 12 hours. Don't 
yer knew it? don't yer see it every day? which all goes to 
prove:de tex dat (his world was not made in 48 hours. 
H011i 
soit que mally pense! 
My beloved friends, can you become 
great in 24 hours? yer know yer can't. 
Was A. T. Stewart a 
great man when he was peddling shoe strings in Baxter Street? 
Was Bill Tweed the great man he turned out to be when he was 
foreman of big 6? 
Was Grant a big man when he drawed 
wood for 40 miles for a 
nip of benzine and a 
penny grab? some 
says he's left off the benzine, but he sticks to the grab ! Stabat 
mater dolerosa. 
Gen. Grant lachromoso I Was Buffalo Bill 
great before he came out at Nita's'? 
Was Captain Jack a 
great man afore Uncle Sam, with all his forces, commenced to 
run him down, and didn't catch him. 10,000 Uncle Sams against 
one little Injun, and the little Injun still ahead and going to 
fight it out on that line as long as Nasty Jack and Gashed 
Charlie '1 
stick to him. 
I 
tell you, my beloved hearers, if de 
world was made in 24 hours dare was better generalship 
displayed about it than there has been in dis yer Modoc busi-
ness. 
Red Jacket—Tecuinseh—Logan.—Rest cat in Lava beqs 
in peace oh I And still we do not reach the highest pinnicle of 
earthy enjoyment. 
But brothers and sisters, I 
find I 
am ramb-
ling. 
The partner of my joys said to me before I 
left home— 
Henry Ward, said she, don't ramble, whatever you do. don't 
ramble. 
Cady-Woodhull-Manstield, I 
said, nary a 
ramble, old 
gal! 
She followed me 27 miles on my way and said, I've 
knowed you now goin' on 30 years, and I 
knows yer weak 
pints when yer git to New York, don't yer ramble. 
I 
said, 
old gal, this yer world was not made in 21 hours. 
I 
hadn't no 
sooner set fort in that watermellun patch at the bottom ot 
Broadway, where I 
landed from one of the non-explosive, 11011-
damage paying boats, that run to Staten Island, before a 
most 
innruciating gal she tackled up alongside of me, took me by 
the arm and sighed. 
Where (lost thou rambl 
Ephreham? I 
said, ;ook yer, young woman, you is made a 
mistake. 
I 
ain't 
no rat:11)11st; I 
never was a 
success as a 
rambler; vanish, get 
the gone—I 
am a 
lecturer; I 
am a 
married man—very much a 
married man! 
Oh, I 
see, she said, you is Brigham Young, 
and she left me to my meditations. 
Ladies and gemen, I 
leave 
it to you if I 
looks like Brigham Young. 
I 
golly, I 
guess not, 
dis chile got one wife, that quite enough. 
But I 
tell you, my 
friet.ds, even Brigham Young didn't get his family as big as it 
is 21 hours. 
No. I 
tell you, beloved sinners, he had to work 
hard and for a 
heap more time dan 21 hours to get em, and 
it proves—that dis yer world couldn't have been made in 24 
hours. 
Fellow wayfarers, I 
trust you will none of you be dis-
crimaged by my remarks— you must have patience. 
Sheridan 
Shook ain't a 
Police Commissioner yet and he's tried it for 
many a 
24 hours. 
To the young men I 
say be ambitious. 
To 
the young ladies, wear tugger bustles and higher hats. 
Young 
men of de risin' generation, dis is a 
great country and a 
free 
country, and dare's a 
future afore you if you gits up and grabs 
time by the fetlock. 
It won't be many years afore if you are 
born in America you'll have just as good a 
chance to get into 
public office as if you'd been born in some foreign clime. 
You 
may be made President; have your salary raised; go into office 
a 
poor man and come out with a 
million; or go into Wall street 
and become a 
bull, that's if you can bear it. 
But fellow sin-
ners, perservere, and never forget wot Zantippe said to her 
husband: Im tumult° parvo-gloria in your extemtus, which 
translated means, This yer world wasn't made in 21 hours.

'END- g-ON_G: 
'Atm — Joe Bowers-7 
As sung by I,. ScnooLcnArr. 
OLD Mother Proctor, she went to the doctor, 
To save the poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it in yourself. 
The boy that would a 
wooing go, 
Was in the level ground laid, 
Johnny I 
hardy linew you, 
Since you joined the lunch brigade. 
(Repmt last four lbw 
for Monts., 
Supposen now that I 
was you. 
And supposcn you were me, 
Supposen I 
was somebody else, 
I 
wonder whose brother you'd be. 
Oh ! Put me in my little bed, 
I 
just want I)-ty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother croaked, 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
! 
Mary had a 
black and tan. 
As white as Pittsburg- snow, 
He'd stand on his head for a 
peck of bread, 
And whistle not for Joe.. 
Old mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard, 
To draw a 
pail of water, 
When she got there the cupboard was bare, 
And so was the ratcatcher's daughter. 
BIG LONG JOHN, 
As sung by L. SmooLcuArr. 
BIG long John was a 
Chinaman. 
And he lived in the land of the free, 
He peddled cigarettes on the upperland. 
Way out in Milwaukee. 
He could eat more hash than a 
free lunch cadet, 
And he never was late to his meals, 
He wore a 
long tail Loin the top of his head, 
Which hung way down to his heels. 
Cnortus. 
Ching, cluing, chum, chow cluing a 
ring a 
rue, 
Long John was a 
Chinaman, 
He 13 a 
barber by birth and a 
butcher by trade, 
I 
tell you he oil from the can. 
He went to San Franc:se° for a 
Chine° gal to see, 
Feeling tired, he laid down to rest 
Beneath the shade of a 
huckleberry tree, 
He feeling very warm soon feel asleep, 
And he laid his head on a 
plank, 
Along came an Indian with a 
big tomahawk, 
And chopped off a piece of his scalp. 
Ching, Ching, Chum, tt c: 
Now when he awoke he felt so bad, 
That he hollered with all his might, 
Put his hand to his head and it made him so sick, 
That he died that very same night. 
He was found next day about 12 M. 
By the captain of a 
Hong Kong crew; 
He wrote to his sweetheart, Chum Chum Fee, 
That he died from loss of his cue.

SADDLE ROCK OYSTER, 
Written by Gno. H. Cor.s, expressly for Luxn ScnooLcrurr. 
I 
WAS as happy as a 
Saddle Rock oyster, 
What's made up in a 
stew, 
And as merry as quail on toast, 
The reason I 
will tell unto you— 
I'm a 
going to see my little Katrina, 
Mit her I 
am in love, 
She's as pretty as a 
big sunflower, 
And as fascinatin7 as a 
turtle dove. 
We met, ' twas in the Bowery. 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
The weather it was showery, 
So we stepped into a 
lager bier saloon; 
It was there we told our tales oi love, 
She said she would be mine, 
was a 
happy little Dutchman then, 
As ever came from Bingen on the Rhine. 
You talk about your fascinating Dutchmen, 
Now just observe my style, 
Mit dis hand-me-down coat of mine, 
I 
wear dot all the while; 
Do ladies dey are all hi love mit rue, 
Whenever I 
go out, 
Dey wink and make dere eye dot way_ 
My gracious, I 
don't know what I'm about 
On Broadway I 
was walking 
The other afternoon, 
One pretty girl she passed me by— 
She vos lovely as the flowers in June, 
She wore a 
hat just three feet high, 
And two curls down her back dat long, 
She had buttons all over her dress, 
Just as big as a 
Chinese gong.

Origtnally sung by LtKs ScnooLcuArr. 
OLD Jane Bradley looking out the window, 
To see Mrs. Stratton, 
Great big horse is a

With the little dog under the wagon. 
Cuorics. 
Then I

I 
ain't going home any more, 
I

Down on de peach blow farm. 
Then it's balm o' gilead, 
Balm o' gilead, 
Balm o' gilead 
To soothe the sin-sick soul.

For building up the chimney 
A great big brick- hit him on the head, 
And knocked him all tojelly.

Add Ryman's Celebrated 4th of July Oration, 
It is useless and more than foolish to ester into prefatory 
remarks explanatory of the origin, growth and pedigree of the 
Fourth of July. 
That it was born of poor and honest parents, 
is a 
fact known to us all. 
That it's birth gave us freedom there 
can be no doubt. 
That that freedom inspized us with enter-
prise and industry make no blooming error 
That industry 
and enterprise has made us the greatest nation the sun ever shone 
on, you can bet your bottom dollar. 
And in how short a 
time? 
How rapid have been the strides of improvement. 
Rivers that 
bat yesterday rolled from the icy north to the tropical south, 
whose surfaces were only disturbed by the, Indian's canoe, to-
day are full of flat-boats and stern- wheel-steamers. 
In the lan-
guage of the Poet— 
Behind the redman's bark canoe, 
The steamboat puffs and raves, 
And city lots are advertised for sale, 
Above old Indians' graves. 
Hey! 
Where was this city two hundred years ago? 
Where was it? 
Was it where she now stands ? No, my hearers, it was not. But 
on this spot the war-whoop of the Indian chief might have been 
heard to echo and reecho from Woodbine Cottage to the Jersey 
Ferry. 
But where is the war-whoop now ? 
It has passed into 
the dim distance, and to-day as you walk down Broadway 
instead of being greeted with the war-whoop of the Indian 
chief, all you hear is: 
How is the old thing working? 
But 
we know how it is ourselves. 
We know that as a 
people 
we are huge. 
We have everything to be proud of. 
We have 
a 
President that can smoke more cigars, make longer excur-
sions and shorter speeches, catch more trout and allow the 
American Flag to ask more apologies than any other ruler on 
the face of th3 earth. 
We have men in our halls of Congress 
who would sacrifice their lives rather than rob the government of 
18 
anything 
They couldn't get away with, and if we keep on 
progressing as we have been in the last few years, there will be 
nothing left of the Old Constitution but the Freedmen's Bureau, 
Woman's Suffrage .and the 15th Amendment. 
Ain't we huge? 
I 
tell you we're business. We're the most peaceful when abused 
and the most warlike when let alone of any people on the earth. 
We had a 
standing challenge in the Clipper for years and years. 
No nation took it up, so we took it up ourselves. 
We had a 
fight in our own family just to show outsiders how we could 
make the fur fly. But the cruel was is over and how our hearts 
beat with joy, our bosoms heaved with emotion to see our 
brothers and friends after their long, tedious marches and hard 
fought battles, returning home -from Canada. 
Yes, my friends, the war is over and the Star Spangled Banner 
still floats triumphant. 
We still celebrate the Anniversary of 
the Declaration of Independence. 
And the bald-headed eagle 
bls perched himself on the snow-capped summits of the Mocky 
Rountains, flapping his wings, spreading his tail feathers, bid-
ding defiance to the world and spiling for a 
muss. 
But he'll 
never spile, he's not long to wait. 
We are on the eve of a 
great war, which if not stopped will cause rivers of blood to 
flow. 
I 
fancy I 
hear you asking yourselves, what will cause 
this war? I 
will tell you. 
During the last three years there 
has been more emigration to this country than there has been 
during the last three years. 
Scarcely a 
ship arrives but that 
brings from twenty-five to one hundred Italian organ grinders. 
sent to this country by Italy to make harmony between the I 
WO 
great nations, hut how are they treated, how are Italians treat 
ed in this country ? Calumniously. Have we commissioners ap• 
pointed to show them around, to take them by the hand and 
guard them against the pitfalls and allurements that beset their 
path to lead them astray ? 
No, in Italic, No 
Why it was only 
two days, three weeks and four months no that an Italian 
friend of mine, an organ-grinder by profession, landed in this 
your beautiful city of New York. How was he received? Who 
was there to take him by the hand and show him round among 
19 
the) gang? 
Noboby, not even " Nobody's Daughter ' 
What 
was the consequences? 
He stood grinding his organ three 
days and three nights, in front of a 
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. Its 
enough to bust up any business. 
And it is likely to cause war 
between this country and Italy. 
Let us prevent it, " Let In 
have peace," for, as Gen. Grant says, the country is in no con-
dition to fight and he wouldn't say so unless he was paid for 
It.. 
But I'll detain you no longer, hoping you may all live for 
many years to fire your crackers and shout for the " Star Ban-
gird Smasher." The Fourth of July and the Dec—le—pru—dence 
of In—dig—na—tion. I 
bid you a-jew, a—street jew.

There's a

THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN, 
Written by OSCAR W ILLLIS for LUKE SCLIOOLCRAIT. 
I 
AM a 
jolly Dutchman, 
From Yarmany I 
came, 
And if you wants to find me out, 
Fritz Donderbeck's my name. 
The reason I 
came of this place, 
Is to told you of a 
spree 
Vot happened to a 
fellow called Hans, 
And an another one—dots me. 
Hans and his gal was married, oh, 
I 
bet you five dollars dat was so, 
And all dem fellows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree, 
There was Gotleb and Mike, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake, the fool, 
An 1 
Openheitner and me; 
Openheimer he got drunk, 
And come down on his head ker.plunk, 
Just as Gotleb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch cheese, 
Hoop la, set 'em up again, 
Knock ' em down again. 
Set 'em up again, 
Dander redder set !cm up again. 
Drunken Dutchmen was we. 
25 
I 
tell you we had lots of fun, 
And plent 
lager bier. 
Fritz Heuzenbatun, oh, he got maxi, 
And tried to bite off my ear, 
I 
got so mad like everyding, 
Ond I 
grab him by the head, 
Ond I 
stab him with a 
pretzel 
'Till I 
thought he was gone dead; 
We kicked up a 
devil of a 
row just then, 
flow just then. row jut thee, 
When in come four big policemen 
And wanted to take me. 
I 
said all right. 
We wa.s only fooling because he was tight, 
When they s:ty go ahead 
And give us a 
glass of beer, 
The policemen then, youst for spite, 
Eat so much switzer they all all got tight 
I 
tell you it was a 
hunky old night, 
And we didn't go home 
'Till they put out the light. 
Each mock, neck. set 'em up again, 
Knock ' ern down again, set 'em up again, 
Dunder blitzen, set ' em up again, 
Swy glass of bier for two. 
I 
danced with a 
gal 
At the ball that night; 
Her name was Katarine, 
The reason dat I 
like dat 
27 
Is because she likes benzine. 
She has a 
gum bile on her nosc 
And a 
bunion on her ear, 
And a 
mond so big, I 
take my oath, 
She can swallow a 
keg of beer. 
Oh, I

And she's going to marry me.

For she only weigh three hundred pound.

AS I 
walked out one morning, 
The sun was shining bright, 
And for a 
time I 
felt my eyes 
Were dazzled by its light. 
When just as I 
was going 
To step across the street, 
met a charming creature, 
The sweetest of the sweet. 
Oh her eyes were bright, 
her step was light, 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet; 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet. 
said, Oh charming creature, 
Will you accept my arm; 
I'll see you safe across the street, 
She looked up in alarm: 
Young man, she said, and then she smiled, 
Oh, 10r, ' Mils such a

'Twas sweetest of the sweet.

Ere many weeks had passed away,

And now she is my only joy,

The busy crowded street, 
I 
feel my wife most surely is 
The sweetest of the sweet.

To see the girl I

She lives in yonder little cot,

I'm the gayest colored gentleman in the land, 
With the pretty girls I

I'm a

Oh ! my name is it is Josephus Orange Blossom,

One evening sweet thoughts were over me creeping, 
I 
thought upon my sweetheart I 
would call, 
And while in her window sI)ly peeping, 
I 
saw Something that did my heart opal, 
Her teeth and one eye laid upon the table. 
Her pretty curls hung on a 
wooden peg, 
So I 
laughed as hard and loud as t 
was able, 
To see her taking oil a 
wooden leg.

SLIM AND SLIPPERY SOUTHERN NIG. 
Words by ANDY M CKEE. 
Music by J. ARXSTRONG, 
OF all the lively colored folks 
That's in this country round, 
There's no one half so handy 
As this nigger you be bound, 
I 
dance from dark till daylight, 
And my cognomen is Sam— 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
CITORUS. 
See me dance and slide about, 
I 
turn myself near wrong side out, 
I 
hope that you are satisfied, 
For I'm the ladies' man, 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
Singing is my chief delight, of dancing never tire, 
The way I 
throw myself around 
You'll say I'm hung on wire, 
I'm my mother's only joy, 
My father's name was Ham, 
So watch the Antic tricks 
Of this Nig from Alabama. 
See me dance &c. 
LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh ! its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though she says on her life she'll ne'er be my wife, 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
Cnonus. 
Ohl beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morniAg 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the spell of a 
charmer; 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled; 
What care I 
for life if she'd by my wife, 
tIy own little darling Patchoula.

The love within my breast!

THE HAPPY HOTTENTOTS. 
Written by W. IL DELEHANTT. 
WE 
are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name; 
We used to gather Buchu leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same. 
CHORUS. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu; 
We are happy Hottentots. 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name. 
Every night when work is done, 
Day time, night time, always full of fun. 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We send them down below. 
That is what, &c.

The New

A 
little book has lately appeared In print at Messrs. Psher 
Denison's, 98 Nas-au street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
sa:. that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readerot, 
as we think i 
t 
would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any fnrther neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
Is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, co0;ing 
25 cents, ca lt.d " The Little Flirt," pubiished by Messrs. 
Denison, 08 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi o flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford i-ome innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and genCemen readers.

Te those who have never perused the sad story of CEWIL01111 
TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept witb her in her sorrows, a.id glowed with indignation at the 
wronyt,e which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of ths unfortrnato 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind. 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ahl the cruel spoiler came— " 
This book, in the lang-age of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in th.s 
sad leads only to misery and shame.
