Aaron Paige (00:00:00): 
Today is Friday, September 24th, 2021. My name is Aaron Page spelling, A A R O N. Last name 
Paige, P A I G E and I am here today with fellow interviewer and folklorist Elinor Levy, spelled 
E L I N O R. Last name Levy, L E V Y. Sorry, Eleanor. Today I will be interviewing Edward 
Frederick as part of the Archie Green Fellowship project titled Community Health Workers in 
Downstate New York. Ed, would you please state and spell your full name? 
Edward Frederick (00:00:43): 
Edward Frederick, E D W A R D F R E D E R I C K. 
Aaron Paige (00:00:48): 
And where were you born? Where did you grow up? 
Edward Frederick (00:00:51): 
Well, I was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania. It was my mom's, not really our hometown, but that's 
where all her kids were born. She was from Crescent, Pennsylvania. My dad was from Lilly, 
Pennsylvania. I was born there, but certainly after that, moved to Southern Pennsylvania, a place 
called Greencastle. And then from there, to Maryland, where I went to school, high school and 
college. I went to Montgomery college and then University of Maryland. Shortly after I 
graduated, I went into Peace Corps, so never really went back to Maryland after that. But I'm not 
sure if I've ever come back to the same world after that, you know. That was a big influence on 
my life for sure. 
Aaron Paige (00:01:51): 
I think we'll return to that later in the interview. Where do you currently work and what's the 
general location of where that work is based? 
Edward Frederick (00:02:03): 
All right, I live in Amenia New York or work in Amenia, New York. I've been here 18 years. 
That's in Northeast Dutchess County, five miles from the border with Sharon, with Connecticut. 
It's really a tri-state area with Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. It's 110 miles north of 
New York City. I live in Columbia County in Hillsdale, New York, which is 30 miles a little bit 
further north, on route 22. 
Aaron Paige (00:02:41): 
And your current job title? 
Edward Frederick (00:02:44): 
Community Outreach Worker. It's changed over the years. Basically it's a Community Outreach 
Worker and I work with the farmworkers. Started originally with the Farmworkers Health 
Program, and that's still basically the population I work with. 
Aaron Paige (00:03:06): 
Along those lines, would you please provide a brief synopsis of your job, and how that position 
relates to, or engages with migrant farmer outreach workers? 
Edward Frederick (00:03:21): 
Okay. When I started, Hudson River Health Care was a little smaller. Didn't have as many sites, 
back in 2003. And, my initial job was just to build up the Farmworkers Health Program here in 
Northeast Dutchess county. So I visited all the counties and within a 40 mile radius anyways, and 
introduced the program to the farmworkers that I met, and try to just let them know what we 
offered as a program. That we, you know, if they didn't have a primary care doctor, a family 
doctor, that we would be glad to provide that service for them. So I started there and basically, 
you know, what we offered was transportation, because that's pretty important in this area. And a 
lot of people because they're, maybe don't have their own license, or they're working, 
Edward Frederick (00:04:31): 
so the program applied to the family members as well, like the wife and children. So that was the 
first really essential service we provided. And then we have interpretation service. And 
particularly in this area, especially back then, there wasn't a lot of concern about interpretation. 
So it was often a real obstacle to getting health care. And then we had a few free services like 
you could get an x-ray and ultrasound at a local hospital. You could get lab work done for free or 
for a discount. And we would help with, if possible, to apply for insurance, apply for financial 
assistance, if they needed that, if they needed it for their health care. A lot of times they couldn't 
get insurance or they could only get emergency Medicaid, which is not very comprehensive. So a 
lot of the people I work with are undocumented. I don't think that's a secret, I don't think. And 
they just, it just really, there's a lot of barriers to getting into the health care system. And so my 
job is to help them overcome those barriers and make sure that they get the health care that they 
need. 
Aaron Paige (00:06:14): 
You started to talk about how you began at Sun River, formally Hudson River Health Care. How 
did you enter the field of health outreach to begin with? Was there, what sort of led up to it? 
Edward Frederick (00:06:31): 
That's funny, you know, I mean, it has to go all the way back to my Peace Corps days, I'm sure. 
My wife is from El Salvador, so we married. I met her in El Salvador. She's a Salvadorena for 
sure. And I just became part of that community. We were married and came back to the United 
States. I was in Central America for probably about 10 years of my life in El Salvador and 
Belize. So we knew a lot of people in the Hispanic community in our area. At the time, because 
I've done a lot of different jobs, I was working in construction and I got a call one day from a 
person here at Hudson River Health Care who actually was here when they opened the office and 
he was leaving and had heard my name mentioned by some people, and asked me if I was 
interested in a job. And yes, I was. But it was a big change because I mean, it was, it didn't pay 
very well to start with, it was like, I'm not, I'm not sure I can afford this. I got three kids and two 
of them are going to college and, you know, it was uh...So I had to juggle my construction and 
my work here at Hudson River for a number of years, especially while the kids were in school. 
And of course they started raising my salary, yeah right. But I started to get paid a little better 
and I just got more familiar with the job and was, I'm just really glad I took the chance and took 
this job because I've even found people in the community who are from the village I worked in, 
in El Salvador. They were kids back in those days. They weren't even born yet. Cause I'm talking 
about 1971, 1972. And I worked with farmworkers. That was my job in El Salvador. I was an 
extension worker for the Ministry of Agriculture. And it just seemed too coincidental, you know, 
for me to pass up. I had to, I had to see what this was about. 
Aaron Paige (00:08:58): 
What was the health care outreach like when you were in El Salvador? Did your experience of 
that, of health, of health care and health care outreach there influence any of your work here? 
Edward Frederick (00:09:17): 
Well, you know, I mean, certainly access to health care, even there was, you know, if you're low 
income and you're a farmworker, most farmworkers are low income. They did have a clinic. 
Every village would have a clinic and the doctor would be there a couple of times a week 
anyways. So if they had any major issues they could use the clinic. And I don't think it was, I'm 
not sure what they paid. I wasn't real involved with the clinic itself, but I know it was there. And 
I knew that's where people went to get their health care. And certainly, you know, most younger 
people, they don't have health care problems, right? Yeah. Except they do. Emergencies come up 
or they start to have a family and the wife needs help when she goes to the hospital. 
Edward Frederick (00:10:23): 
But there's, there's a lot of...in El Salvador, in Central America, there were a lot of people, there 
was a lot of self-help. People would take care of themselves. Families, you know, the relatives. 
It's funny because there's a book called "Where There is No Doctor." And it's in Spanish. And on 
the cover of the book there's a picture of these guys carrying someone across the river in a 
stretcher. And one of the families I was working with here saw the book and they said, oh, that's 
my uncle and that's my neighbor, that's my... And she had known this doctor that had put this 
book together. So, uh, was pretty interesting. 
Elinor Levy  (00:11:14): 
Did you find, did you find that in El Salvador, they might turn to local healers? Traditional 
healers as opposed to Western medicine? And how did you, did you have a good relationship 
with that healer? Were you able to work together? 
Edward Frederick (00:11:33): 
You know, I was a pretty young kid at the time. I didn't have health issues to speak of. I knew 
people that did, and I know they talked about their health needs. Right. I wasn't that involved 
with that. But I know they had, I know they had, they had healers there. 
Elinor Levy  (00:11:56): 
No, I meant more as a medical person, not you personally, but were there times when the 
medical personnel would try to work with the healer to help? 
Edward Frederick (00:12:05): 
They had their home remedies and they had their own beliefs about health care. Some of them 
involved spiritual battles, you might say, with uh, I guess they call it brujer√≠a , but it's not in a 
pejorative sense, you know? It was one of the resources that they would turn to, for sure. And of 
course there were midwives and there were people out in the community. 
Aaron Paige (00:12:41): 
Would you say that there was a community health worker kind of system in place, even if, 
whether formalized or informal. 
Edward Frederick (00:12:49): 
I don't think there was much in El Salvador. Later on I went to Nicaragua and it was particularly 
after revolution, in Nicaragua. They had brigades that would go out into the countryside and 
meet with people and take care of their health care needs. But when I was in El Salvador it was 
still pretty conservative and pretty much, um, I don't think they had that much of an outreach into 
the country.  
Aaron Paige (00:13:19): 
I'm curious about the evolution of the terminology around the work that you do. You referred to 
...you're an outreach worker, but you said that the title has changed over time. What has the title 
been? How has it changed and how has the thinking around and the language around the title sort 
of shifted and why? 
Edward Frederick (00:13:42): 
Well, I mean, when I first started, they said I was a community outreach worker, but it wasn't 
very well defined what that meant at the time. But it was connected with the Farmworkers Health 
Program. I don't suppose I really knew what I was getting into to start with because, um, but I 
had the freedom to sort of help define my role and help to develop the role as a community 
health worker. As we made connections into the community, it would mean that I would meet 
people in the hospitals, I would meet people in the doctor's offices, the specialists' offices, where 
if they needed something beyond primary care, it was important to get them in to see the 
specialists. Or we developed what was called the Rural Health Network here. 
Edward Frederick (00:14:50): 
And so we would have meetings with all the service providers in this area, maybe to help. They'd 
come from the hospitals, from the Department of Health. They would come from community 
organizations in the area, to try and address some of the concerns and the needs in the 
community. That was really helpful too, to be able to make all the different connections. The 
outreach was important into the farmworker community, but also into, overall the community, 
like town hall and the hospitals, and the different doctors that provided services and other 
services that were available, like social services. So, as I learned my way around, I guess, it just, 
you could see that there were a lot of people that were doing similar things, trying to help people 
with the, and some of them are government programs and some of them are community 
programs, and we started a group here called Somos La Llave Del Futuro, which is a 501c3, 
which is a not-for-profit, that we, we could extend our outreach into the Hispanic community 
with that. 
Edward Frederick (00:16:29): 
So it wasn't as much the title that changed over time, it was more my awareness of what we 
could do as outreach workers. It was a lot of just, uh, you know...Providing transportation is a 
time-consuming job, but it's very important in a rural area like this one. And I would end up, at 
times, going to Springfield or Albany or New York City, with patients, if they had special needs. 
Maybe Memorial Sloan Kettering, you know, people, if they had cancer, that was more than 
maybe the local systems could handle here, if they needed special help. It was just a way of 
identifying the resources and making and helping people get access to those resources. A lot of 
times it was helping them enroll their kids in school, or it was helping them get the birth 
certificate that somehow fell through the cracks, connecting all the dots, just getting out into the 
community, getting invited to a lot of good parties, birthdays and quincea√±eros and just getting 
to meet people. And, I don't know, just by providing service and by making myself available, 
just gaining the trust and sort of a name in the community that they could recognize, and turn to 
if they needed help. 
Elinor Levy  (00:18:09): 
Did you find that those transportation, during those transportation trips that...I'm trying to word 
this as not a yes or no question. What kinds of information were you able to get from the clients 
in those long drives that enhanced your ability and the doctor's abilities to care? 
Edward Frederick (00:18:30): 
Oh, well, I mean, first of all, part of our job is to educate about certain things like diabetes or 
high blood pressure. So we do have some training in that. And then working with the doctors and 
interpreting, I continued to gain more knowledge as far as, you know, about health care. We'd 
share stories. I'd share my story and they'd share their story and how they got here and about 
their family back home and also of course, what is ailing them and what preventative medicine 
really meant and how they could maybe...okay, this is a chronic thing right now, or an acute 
problem right now, but how can you prevent this in the future? 
Edward Frederick (00:19:23): 
Just really trying to emphasize that sort of thing. But helping with paying the bill, if it didn't get 
covered by Medicare, which a lot of times it doesn't because it's emergency Medicaid. So we'd 
have to apply for financial aid at the hospitals. But still, they'd get bills and so you gotta call the 
billing company and try to give them the information. But the most important thing to me was 
just to hear their story, how they got here. And sometimes they'd open up with you and over 
time, if I got to know them well enough, and a lot of times, if it was a, if they had, if they needed 
extra health care because of this, the health, whatever their problem was, I'd be taking them to a 
lot of different appointments. So we'd get to know each other pretty well. I'd see where they lived 
and they'd just open up more and we'd be able to get to know each other pretty well. We had a lot 
of good conversations. The trips sometimes would be long enough that you, sometimes they just 
wanted to relax, and I'd put the radio on or play some music or something, but if they were 
willing to talk and wanted to talk, I enjoyed listening to their stories. Yeah. 
Elinor Levy  (00:20:54): 
So I know that you speak fluent Spanish, so obviously you're translating Spanish. How often do 
you think that you are also translating issues about culture between the client and the doctor? I 
guess I'm more interested in how to get the doctor and to understand the client's culture so that 
they understand why someone may be reluctant to take their diabetes medication, or if you're 
talking to a male, impressing on the doctor, that if you want to talk about the male's diet, you 
really need to talk to his wife or his mother. You can talk to him until the sky turns whatever, but 
it doesn't matter because they don't do the cooking. 
Edward Frederick (00:21:45): 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's funny because it starts with interpretation and of course doctors will use 
medical terms and stuff. My wife was also an outreach worker for a number of years. She just 
retired. She end up with the same sort of ...we'd have interesting discussions later. Sometimes 
you can convey what the doctor just said in a few words. And sometimes it takes a lot more 
words. And we would simplify the terminology as much as we could without distorting what the 
doctor was trying to say to the patient. Sometimes the doctor would say, especially if they didn't 
know you very well...if he gave a longer explanation of something and you kind of shortened it, 
they'd want to know why did you do that? 
Edward Frederick (00:22:41): 
And sometimes vice versa. They would use a word that you knew the patient wasn't going to 
understand or really know what to do with so you would explain it to them. Instead of just using 
one word, it would be more like an explanation. The doctors get used to you after a while. One of 
the things that I don't think the doctors fully appreciate, but they are aware of it is if the patient 
leaves and they haven't given him any medicine or they haven't helped them with what they think 
their problem was, cause they will call home and they would say, because you don't need a script 
to go into the pharmacies in Central America, they would say, ‚Äúfulana de tal has this the same 
problem. 
Edward Frederick (00:23:39): 
What medicine is he taking?‚Äù And then they'd say what it was and they'd say "well, send me 
some." So they'd get medicine in the mail and they weren't necessarily telling the doctor about it. 
And we'd have to explain to them, look, you gotta at least tell the doctor that this is what you're 
doing so that they don't conflict or they don't...you're not getting the wrong message here. That 
was one of the things that was fascinating to me because when I started out in Central America, 
there was very poor communication. A telephone, there might've been one for the whole town. A 
phone line was very difficult to use. And now I'm riding with people in a van and they're talking 
to their family member, maybe even FaceTiming them back in Guatemala or El Salvador. That 
just still blows my mind, that they're able to do that. But it really makes their life easier here 
because that separation from family is really difficult for them, so they feel that they have a good 
connection still with their family, and that's important. 
Elinor Levy  (00:24:54): 
Do you feel like the doctors have improved their knowledge or their willingness to listen to the 
patients in terms of, as I said, the cultural aspects of the things that are not necessarily medical, 
but certainly are meaningful in discussing medical issues? 
Edward Frederick (00:25:16): 
Yeah, I think they are. When I first started here, it was pretty, it's a pretty small health center, but 
we do have five providers here and staff. But in the beginning it wasn't a very diverse staff. In 
this whole area, there was not much diversity. Diversity was something that was kind of difficult 
and in some cases still is difficult for people to accept here in the rural area. I mean, it's been 
going on now for 20 years, my job here almost. So we try to find doctors that do speak Spanish 
and staff here that are bilingual. We've really gone from one person that speaks Spanish in the 
office to maybe ten. I'd say like four of our doctors do speak Spanish here. 
Elinor Levy  (00:26:19): 
Are they are of Latin descent or are they Caucasians who speak Spanish? 
Edward Frederick (00:26:24): 
Caucasians who speak Spanish, who maybe have a spouse in one case, or just connections with... 
Elinor Levy  (00:26:33): 
So they still have some of that cultural fluency as well. 
Edward Frederick (00:26:35): 
Yup. And that's important. And they really get to know their patient a lot better that way, for 
sure. The patient is more comfortable with them and they do understand a lot of these issues that 
we're talking about. And we talk, I talk with the providers and we discuss different things. It's 
amazing how the lack of housing or the lack of stability in someone's life effects their health 
healthcare, but it certainly does. If you're out of work for the whole winter and you can only, and 
people, they don't migrate at this point, they stay in one place. They save up their money or they 
live together and they get through the winter. Being able to connect them with social services at 
that point, with maybe a food pantry or ways to pay for their heating. There are different social 
services that they...They can get a prescription assistance. Helps them pay for the medicines. 
Edward Frederick (00:28:00): 
And housing is a big issue. It's a big issue for everybody in rural communities, especially for the 
undocumented. So you get involved with affordable housing in the community because they 
need a voice on that committee that is familiar with the Hispanic population. So that they have a 
voice in that conversation too. No real solutions yet. Housing is a real need. Affordable housing 
is a real need in this area. 
Elinor Levy  (00:28:39): 
It's worse now. 
Edward Frederick (00:28:43): 
It is. It certainly is. So it's interesting to talk to the doctors about all these different issues and 
how it might affect their health care and their needs and their health. 
Aaron Paige (00:28:56): 
For those workers who are working on a seasonal basis and who are moving from location to 
location or traveling back home, what kind of challenges does that present for you as an outreach 
worker in terms of maintaining a relationship and continuing to know someone, and be in touch 
with someone and their health care needs over time? 
Edward Frederick (00:29:24): 
A lot of the farmers, especially in Columbia County and I do go into that area quite a bit, have 
H2A visas. And so they do go home for the summer. Some are from Jamaica. Some are from 
Guatemala. But a lot of times they're back the next year and so you get to know each other. You 
still have their phone number. They call you and you recognize their phone number. Over time, 
you just are able to maintain those relationships, which is important. And when they go back 
home, their needs don't change. If they have diabetes or they have high blood pressure or 
something, they need to keep up with that. 
Edward Frederick (00:30:19): 
Like right now, especially with COVID, they want to get their COVID shots before they go back 
home, because sometimes they're hard to get back home. Or even to travel you need to have the 
vaccine. With COVID, it's really changed a lot of things. It just seems that people do come back 
to the same farms because they have the connections. You just meet up again with them in the 
spring. But a lot of the people now are here. If they're undocumented and they don't have that 
visa, they're not free to travel back to their home country. So they stay here and they find a way 
to get through the winter. 
Aaron Paige (00:31:15): 
Have you found yourself in the position where you were helping an individual navigate their 
health needs when they were not in the area, when they were back home, for example. You 
already have this relationship that you've developed where they might come to you. I'm just 
wondering if that has ever happened or if that happens. 
Edward Frederick (00:31:43): 
Maybe not so much with health care per se, but maybe they just need help making a connection. 
It could just be a matter of interpretation sometimes. Speaking with their boss. Something that 
they need to help them get back next year or something like that. So it's just being a voice there 
that they can call that can help them with whatever might come up. It might be an immigration 
issue. I mean, that is a big topic of conversation. I mean, I thought, a long time ago, like 20 years 
ago, we were going to have an immigration reform bill passed by now and every year I kept 
thinking the same thing, oh, this will be the year, this will be the year. It just hasn't happened and 
it's gotten worse over the years. 
Edward Frederick (00:32:36): 
It's even gotten to the point now where I don't think it's, well, you know what the political 
situation is now. It's just very difficult. And very disappointing. But on the one hand, people, 
they just accept it. It just makes it difficult because sometimes they are separated from their 
families for 20 years, you know, 15 years. Whereas when earlier, before 9/11, they were able to 
travel to see family back home and then come back here and it didn't have to cost them a fortune 
to get back here. It's sad. It's very sad. That part of it. 
Elinor Levy  (00:33:19): 
I wanted to go back to where you commented that sometimes they'll call home for medication 
because it's easier to get there. Are there healers here that travel, that are also farmworkers here, 
that they might go rather than to you or to Sun River Health, that they're still seeking home 
remedies as well as medications from home? 
Edward Frederick (00:33:43): 
Oh, I'm sure there are. They just don't always talk about it. But I'm sure there are. There certainly 
are people that, um, again, not in a pejorative sense, but the brujer√≠as right. The brujos will 
identify somebody that's causing their illness and they'll look for a remedy for that, whatever it 
might be. They have their way of diagnosing things and, their cures. So yes, they certainly still 
turn to that. Yeah. Especially when something seems inexplicably or something that just won't 
go away, you know? They look for causes in their own way and it's not always traditional 
medicine that they turn to for sure. Causes and cures. Yeah. And in a sense that's where 
behavioral health and our social workers have more contact and experience with that, because 
that really becomes part of the conversation for sure. 
Elinor Levy  (00:35:01): 
Right. Because I can imagine, how many times have we heard, with ourselves or with a doctor or 
a friend or a relative, they just can't figure out what's going on. They just don't know. It would be 
really comforting, in a sense, to go to a healer. Whether it's right or wrong, it's that yeah, you 
know, you're not imagining this. 
Edward Frederick (00:35:25): 
It's another resource that they use for sure. Also spiritually, they do believe in prayer, very 
strongly. And they are not afraid to ask for miracles. They believe in miracles. They've heard of 
miracles happening and the word spreads and they do pray and they find a lot of hope in their 
faith that they will get better or whoever their family member is will get better. Yeah. That's an 
important part of their healthcare, for sure. And it's mental health, I suppose, but I mean, where 
do you separate mental from physical. 
Elinor Levy  (00:36:19): 
And who is to say it doesn't work? 
Edward Frederick (00:36:26): 
Of course, we don't have all the answers. We know that. I think it gets more complicated now 
with COVID because now you get the political interference, in a sense, with health care or 
misinformation about health care. 
Elinor Levy  (00:36:46): 
So that's a really good segue into talking about the COVID pandemic. Where are the 
farmworkers getting their information? Of course they're getting it from you. But where else are 
they getting information and misinformation and how are you able to counter the 
misinformation? 
Edward Frederick (00:37:12): 
They certainly listen to TV in their own language. So they listened to whatever broadcast. 
Probably Univision or something like that. They also use social media and they use Facebook. 
They are definitely on Facebook. They use Mensaje. They use the different apps and there's 
certainly a lot of discussion about COVID. It affected people's ability to get work. It affected 
their ability to, just like everybody, during the shutdown. So there was the political aspect to it 
that the people were listening to and trying to understand, you know, how to get through this 
whole thing. And also connecting with people back home and seeing what was going on in their 
home country, in their village. People that might've been dying or something. 
Edward Frederick (00:38:20): 
The sort of mixed messages we all have to deal, about whether to wear a mask or don't wear a 
mask, the people that I work with in the Hispanic community, at least, are certainly not opposed 
to wearing a mask. They understand social distancing. Although, in their own situation at home, 
maybe they're overcrowded and they don't really have a way to distance that way socially. And I 
think a lot of times, if they do come down with COVID, they think, well, I don't need the vaccine 
now, because I've already had COVID. And I think a lot of people believe that, at this point. That 
if they've already had COVID, they don't need the vaccine. And I'm not sure all the evidence is 
in on that yet either, as far as that goes. 
Edward Frederick (00:39:17): 
But we still encourage people to get their vaccine, regardless if they've had COVID or not. And 
in the beginning, of course, when we started giving the vaccine in January-February, people were 
calling, asking for appointments. And now, probably the beginning of the summer, it was a little 
harder to get people to come and get their vaccines. So we were calling them. Do you want the 
vaccine? We're giving it on such and such a date. So I think if we make it easy for them to get 
the vaccine, if we make it available and they don't have to miss work, or they don't have to travel 
a long distance, they'll get their vaccine. They'll listen to their doctor for the most part, but not 
everybody. 
Edward Frederick (00:40:08): 
There is some resistance. But I think a lot of the fear, you know, I don't think they believe all the 
conspiracy theories out there. But sometimes it's just a matter of access. So we try to provide that 
for them. And we try to make sure that they know when we're giving the vaccine here. And have 
them talk to their friends and do that outreach as much as possible. Just try to get the word out. 
We are going to have a, I guess it's part of the Spanish heritage month coming up. We're going to 
have a day where people don't need an appointment. It's a community day, community affair, 
Latin festival in Millerton. So they can come in without an appointment and get their vaccine. 
Edward Frederick (00:41:10): 
And we have an ice cream truck there and they can get a free ice cream and, and all kinds of 
good information. And it's kind of like a festival in town. We hope we get a lot of people in 
through that as well. So I think it really is just making it as easy as possible for them to get their 
vaccine and just encourage them and give them the right information, as far as we know 
anyways. This is what we know. And do you trust us? I think it's part of the job, between a 
doctor and their patient, it's just to win their trust. I think our doctors do a pretty good job with 
that. And they look to their home countries where maybe they don't have access to the vaccine 
yet and they are aware of how serious the problem is everywhere. It's not just here. 
Aaron Paige (00:42:15): 
And farmworkers were not prioritized at first. Is that right? When the vaccine was 
Edward Frederick (00:42:22): 
As essential workers you mean? 
Aaron Paige (00:42:24): 
Essential workers, yeah. 
Edward Frederick (00:42:27): 
I don't think they were. That was the other thing. I even forgot about that. In the beginning, it 
was prioritized, and not everybody could get their shot until they went through the list. I think 
you're right. And of course in the early months, in a lot of cases, they weren't working on the 
farms yet, until March, April, May, then they started to work more on the farms. The kids are 
back in school now and that was a big problem. Because for the kids to miss school, especially if 
they've just arrived here recently and they still don't know the language that well. If they missed 
a whole...and I don't think a lot of them had access at home to a computer to get their school 
lessons. 
Edward Frederick (00:43:34): 
We still don't know just how serious that problem is, with the children. We have a lot of families 
coming up from Guatemala now and they speak Mayan and K‚Äôiche. And sometimes the children 
don't even speak Spanish and they went to school and that's their only language. I'm fascinated 
with how quick they learn English and the alpha. If they are given a chance, they, they learn 
English. 
Elinor Levy  (00:44:13): 
Children are actually born with the capacity to speak any language, and the noises they make as 
babies, have all the elements of every language in the world, but they almost immediately start to 
filter out what they don't need, but they can, as a young child. I had a professor who lived in 
Iceland for a year on a fellowship and their seven-year-old son was more fluent than they were, 
and actually translated for them. But the minute they moved back to the US he lost it. 
Edward Frederick (00:44:45): 
Yeah, that happens. I heard a story. I don't know how true it is. It was one of the language, I don't 
know if it was Berlitz or what. It was one of the guys who started that program. When he was a 
child, when he was infant, his mother spoke one language, his father spoken another one, his 
caretaker spoken another one. He said, his only problem was he thought everybody in the world 
spoke a different language. 
Edward Frederick (00:45:12): 
And he was going to have to learn all these different languages. But it was certainly something 
that gave him the ability to learn languages and to teach other people languages. Children are just 
amazing how they...And if they don't do well in math or they don't do well in a lot of other 
subjects, if they can at least learn that language, and they learn English, that's such a...And in 
some cases, they'll speak three languages. You really want to encourage that and not let them 
lose their native language. It's not something that our schools prioritize, unfortunately, but boy, 
what a gift that is, if you can speak three languages. I don't think a lot of times they understand 
how special that is and they'll be shy about speaking their own language, even amongst 
themselves, their friends that maybe speak K'iche or Spanish or something. 
Elinor Levy  (00:46:19): 
I think unfortunately, for some of them, it's a burden. Once they learn English, the expectation is 
that they're going to be translating for mama and papa. And so knowing those languages is not 
the joy that we see or the benefit. It's the burden of having to discuss adult matters, way before 
they need to. 
Edward Frederick (00:46:45): 
That's very true. Yeah. And it's very hard, particularly if you have to deal with healthcare. Kids 
shouldn't have to do that. They just shouldn't have to do that. In my own family, my father, he's 
Polish. My grandparents were Polish, but they never spoke English. I unfortunately never learned 
Polish. And he was not encouraged to speak Polish in school. And he, he basically lost that 
ability. 
Aaron Paige (00:47:19): 
Sounds like my father with Spanish. He grew up in a Spanish speaking household. His 
grandmother and his mother only spoke Spanish in the house. He went to school. His classmates 
made fun of him because he was more comfortable in Spanish than English. And he made a very 
quick decision at a very young age that he would no longer speak Spanish and that he only 
wanted to speak English. Then started to only speak with his father, who only spoke English. It's 
sad how that can happen. 
Edward Frederick (00:47:51): 
It is. My kids had that similar thing happened to them. I have three. They're all grown up now. 
But nobody spoke Spanish in school with them. So they, I mean, they're not fluent, but they can't 
speak Spanish. And one of my daughters was also in Peace Corps. She was in Africa. She went 
to Niger. My uncle was in Peace Corps, in Ethiopia, way back in sixty-one, when it first started. 
So it's a generational thing here. But she learned how soon she can speak French and she can 
speak Spanish and Portuguese. Whether they ever use it on a practical day-to-day basis, if you 
have that ability, it opens up pathways in your brain and gives you access to the culture of that 
person. 
Aaron Paige (00:48:53): 
For those patients who are more comfortable speaking an indigenous language, or maybe only 
speak that language, do you work with an interpreter? Do you have access to interpretation 
services in your role? 
Edward Frederick (00:49:08): 
Not for K'iche, we don't. We have a line here, a translation line. But it's very recent, I would say 
within the last two or three years where K'iche has been an issue. We do have people from 
Bangladesh or China or whatever, where the language line can be used. But K'iche, I don't think 
that's on our language line yet. 
Elinor Levy  (00:49:33): 
You might want to connect with the Kingston Land Trust. I'm trying to remember. There were 
some K'iche language classes happening up in Kingston. They may have been virtual. If you 
check with the Kingston Land Trust, they'll know who was doing it. 
Edward Frederick (00:49:53): 
It is such a different language. It's like, wow! I'd love to, but boy... 
Elinor Levy  (00:50:00): 
Or if anyone else there wants to. 
Edward Frederick (00:50:02): 
Yeah. It is something that would be very interesting, I would think, for some younger people to 
try and pick that up. And to have the access to people who actually speak that language would be 
great. Because you could learn so much. We lived in Belize for seven years as well. And there 
were two villages, I remember specifically. And they were twenty kilometers apart. But one 
spoke Mopan Maya and the other one spoke K'iche Maya. So there's a lot of different dialects. 
But people in Belize, a lot of them with very little education, maybe sixth grade could speak six 
languages. 
Elinor Levy  (00:50:46): 
Then there is Garifuna too. 
Edward Frederick (00:50:48): 
Yeah Garifuna. We lived with the Garifuna. We lived in a village with them. 
Elinor Levy  (00:50:53): 
Did you live in Dangriga? 
Edward Frederick (00:50:56): 
No, We lived in Barranco. 
Elinor Levy  (00:50:58): 
I spent some time in Dangriga and it was beautiful. I tried to get back there to teach and I just 
never could work it out. 
Edward Frederick (00:51:07): 
Yeah. Barranco is the last stop before you get into Guatemala, Livingston. It's on the bay there. 
The Bay of Amatique. 
Elinor Levy  (00:51:23): 
Anything else Aaron? 
Aaron Paige (00:51:26): 
Ed, I was wondering if you might speak a little bit about your relationship to the growers. 
Edward Frederick (00:51:33): 
Well, that's important because if you get off on the wrong foot with the growers that can really 
make your work a lot more complicated. Because if someone's going in to see the doctor they're 
not working that day. Because on a farm there's a right time to do things. You got to get the 
harvest in or you got to get the planting in or you got to get this done. So sometimes it can be 
difficult for the worker to get permission to go to see the doctor. So it really helps to be able to 
meet the... Sometimes you can't meet the owner, but the supervisor or whoever is supervising 
them. But the owner as well. In Peace Corps and growing up, I've always known farmers. It's 
important to understand that culture too and what the pressures are on them. 
Edward Frederick (00:52:40): 
I always would try to explain the program to the farmers so they understood what it was. In a lot 
of cases, they can't afford health insurance for their workers. H2a visa people can get insurance. 
So, if they can't afford health insurance for them, but they know there are times when people 
need to see a doctor that we provide a service. They learn to appreciate that. It's not really a 
benefit that they're giving their worker, but in a way, it feels like that because they're given a day 
or the time to go to see the doctor. Sometimes it actually means that they have to find somebody 
else to work that shift for them or something. 
Edward Frederick (00:53:33): 
So it really is important to know that farmer. And they're not the easiest people to work with 
sometimes but I enjoy them. Once they get to know you and know who you are, which is 
important. That's an important part. And it's funny because when I first started working and I'd 
drive up to a farm, the first thought was, oh, it was immigration. Because I didn't have any 
signage on my van at that point. I have the signage on it now that says Hudson River, still says 
Hudson River Health Care. They haven't changed it to Sun River Health. So it sort of identifies 
who I am. But in the beginning there was no way of knowing who I was. A similar experience in 
Peace Corps where they just assumed I worked with the CIA. Clearly this guy is working with 
the CIA, you know, why would he be here? 
Edward Frederick (00:54:25): 
But once they got to know you, it didn't seem to matter. They probably still thought I worked 
with the CIA, but it didn't bother them after a while. But immigration was and still is an issue. So 
it really helps to know the farmer. They don't want to run into problems with immigration either. 
So you learn. I think you just have to make those efforts to know the farmer, the owner, the 
supervisor so that they work with you and don't make your job harder. Farmers in this area are 
under a lot of pressure. Financially, it's really hard. Especially small farmers. Corporate 
agriculture is really changing the way we grow our food. There's a lot of organic farmers and 
small farmers in the area and labor is always a big issue for any farmer. Being able to afford...If 
you can afford housing, if you have housing for people that really makes a big difference. 
Edward Frederick (00:55:43): 
I try to work as closely as possible with the farmer's markets. Sometimes you can actually help 
people find a job or somebody who needs help. You can help them connect with people that are 
looking for work. We started a little farmer's market here at the health center too. We have a 
community garden project, we call it. We have a community garden right here at the health 
center. And we have another farm up the road that gave us space to grow things as well. So I've 
invited some of the families to grow their own vegetables, and we have a market on Tuesdays 
here. We started out, particularly with the WIC program, where they have the farmer's market 
nutrition program, where they would get checks that they could use at the farmer's markets. 
Edward Frederick (00:56:37): 
So it's a way of collaborating and trying to support farmers in the area so they could use their 
farmer's market nutrition program checks right there at our market on Tuesdays. It was important 
for us. And it's also a way of getting information out about events that might be going on or 
services that are available to people. Or if they have questions, someone was there to answer 
questions. But also just to make available fresh fruits and vegetables for people. That's of course 
what the effort behind the farmer's market nutrition program. It's just really the most important 
part of health care, good nutrition, good diet. 
Edward Frederick (00:57:34): 
And you get to talk about recipes. How do you use cauliflower? How do you guys use the 
tomatillo. If they're not Hispanic and they don't know what a tomatillo is...they might've seen it 
at a restaurant, but they don't know what a tomatillo actually looks like, so you can explain that 
to them. It's been fun because I like gardening myself. It's a nice outlet for me. It really helps me 
to deal with some of my... You are dealing with people's problems all the time. It can really 
begin to overwhelm you sometimes and it just not a very smooth process. 
Edward Frederick (00:58:28): 
And that's part of the effort we're making. To try and coordinate more with the hospitals and the 
doctors in the area, just so that it doesn't seem like it's such a big task every time you get a new 
patient or someone, to just open those doors again and get your foot in the door, basically is what 
you need to do in some cases, so that they can get their health care. Because it can be 
overwhelming. Certainly for the patient, it's overwhelming. It's just amazing how complicated it 
can become sometimes, especially if they have cancer or if they have some really complicated 
disease. 
Edward Frederick (00:59:11): 
It's just interesting to be able to work with people. It helps you become more part of the 
community too. Because this area was built around farming back in the day. And dairy farms in 
particular have been closing up for the last...Family farms are really hard to keep going. And if 
they're going to keep going they have to get bigger, in some sense. So maybe two farms shut 
down and somebody else has the resources that buy up whatever equipment and cows they can 
from that farm and get bigger. In a rural area, it's important to have that base of income. And we 
need our food to be grown locally, as much as possible. 
Edward Frederick (01:00:09): 
So you get into areas of ecology and you get areas of climate change and all the different issues 
that affect us all. What's interesting is the guys from Central America, it's fun, because I worked 
with guys, they were still plowing with oxen back then, when I was back there. Or they didn't 
even use oxygen. They used a stick, a machete. They did the Milpa system. But they understand 
the relationship with the earth, in a way that I don't think if you're up on a tractor all the time, 
you really appreciate. Because you're depending more on the machine and you have to. The 
pressures of agriculture are just.... 
Elinor Levy  (01:00:58): 
I imagine for some of the families, the ability to grow the vegetables that are not available to 
them in the grocery store that they're used to getting. 
Edward Frederick (01:01:09): 
Yeah. And they try some exotic things. There's a family from Ecuador. They like to grow 
potatoes. That's their big thing. They love potatoes. Who doesn't? Digging potatoes in the end of 
the season...It's so much fun to dig those potatoes. I wouldn't want to do a whole field. But they 
grow some exotic things and sometimes the summer is not quite long enough for them to get the 
fruit at the end of the summer, but they still want to grow that thing that they grew back in 
Ecuador, just to make them feel good. So yeah, they grow their tomatillos and grow their 
different peppers that they like or their corn. Beans and corn are big to them. 
Edward Frederick (01:02:03): 
And they try to get their kids involved. And it's an effort. Particularly with obesity. Childhood 
obesity is an issue. Always trying to get your kids to eat vegetables, that's never easy. But if 
they're helping to grow them, they might have more of an appreciation of what a vegetable is and 
why they should eat it besides the fact that it makes them healthier. But they understand the 
whole process from beginning to end, and it makes more sense to them. I'm always trying to 
encourage that. Getting young people involved with it too. And the parents try to get their kids to 
come and help them. Weeding is never fun, but... And they're working, so they don't have big 
plots, but they have enough space that they can grow some of their own vegetables, which is fun. 
Aaron Paige (01:03:04): 
That your work puts you in this position where you're thinking about the intersection of housing, 
transportation, food, and of course all connected to health and wellbeing.... I just feel like this is 
the power of the work. In thinking about all of the social determinants of health... 
Edward Frederick (01:03:24): 
The spiritual aspects of it. Other than the fact that there's an artificial border between here and 
Mexico, or between countries, between nations...it's a way of sort of overcoming those barriers 
too. Working with people, even though they don't have the same rights we do or the same access 
to certain things. They don't let that stop them. They keep...they're resourceful. In a sense, they're 
just like American farmers. They're willing to make these huge sacrifices and devote a 
tremendous amount of energy and time to getting through the day and trying to help their kids 
have a better life. And they maintain their families back in their home country, as well as find a 
way to get through the winter here. 
Edward Frederick (01:04:26): 
It's amazing to me how they're able to juggle those two. They probably have kids back in 
Guatemala, El Salvador, or somewhere. They're sending money home so they can go to school. 
Unfortunately, a lot of times it's to pay off the Coyote, because that's getting more and more 
expensive. But they're resourceful. They're just looking for whatever way they can help 
themselves. And they're not afraid to, they're not shy about using services when they're offered to 
them. And I think that's important. The services may have been limited back in their home 
country too. So it wasn't always available, if you were low income. You didn't expect that the 
government was really going to be that helpful. And they just adapt and they adjust and they 
make life better. They have a good attitude towards life, the people that I work with. They can be 
a little fatalistic sometimes. It's easy to get discouraged, but they don't stay that way long. They 
keep moving, you know. 
Aaron Paige (01:06:06): 
Ed, in your work, would you share a moment or a time in your work as an outreach worker 
where you really felt the importance or the rewards of what you do? I'm sure there are many, but 
if there's an example of a particular experience or time in the field where you really felt the 
rewards of the work that you do. 
Edward Frederick (01:06:34): 
There's a lot of small ones for sure. But when someone has cancer, especially, if you're able to 
help them navigate the system and get the services that.... It's funny, because doctors really do 
want to help the patient, but you got to get past the gatekeeper somehow first or you gotta figure 
out how you're going to pay for this. And once you can resolve that issue the doctors really are 
there to try and help people overcome their disease or get healthy again. With cancer, I've taken 
people to Memorial Sloan Kettering because maybe the services here just couldn't deal with the 
complexity of the case. In one case, in particular, and it's been successful up to this date, he 
needed to stay in the city and somebody had to be there with him. Memorial Sloan Kettering 
would provide the housing, but somebody had to stay with him. And he wasn't able to work. 
Edward Frederick (01:07:53): 
So he had to find somebody who would be able to stay with him. What we ended up doing was 
we set up a GoFundMe page and raised some money so that we could actually pay someone to 
stay there with him in the city. That was fun just to try and, you know, because you involve more 
of the community and they were able to support someone. And so far he has done quite well. He 
had a good outcome. He's back working now and he's not had any setbacks. When I first met him 
he was in pretty bad shape. And it was fun to get to know him. And it was just really fun to help 
him navigate that whole system and just really have a good outcome that he's had. 
Edward Frederick (01:08:52): 
And unfortunately I've worked with another family where he didn't make it. But I was able to be 
there with the family and help them through. Again, we went to Memorial Sloan Kettering, but 
has a condition that...they couldn't save him. And that's hard because now you get involved with 
hospice. And there's cultural things there as well. And, there's always the hope for a miracle. And 
that was a young family too. So the wife is now left to fend for herself. But she has friends and 
she has people in the area that...she's been able to carry on. But what a hard thing to lose your 
spouse when you still have young kids at home. But to be able to be there with them and help 
them through that whole process was important. It was a little sad, but I was really glad I could 
be there to do that. Yeah. 
Edward Frederick (01:10:14): 
It's hard. And I guess you just have to accept that when you're working in health care. Not 
everybody makes it. But you do the best you can. Particularly working with younger, and most 
of them are younger people, there's a real good chance that they will get through and they'll be 
able to deal with their issues. And to be able to help them navigate that and be able to continue 
working and raising their family is important. And that happens in a lot of different small ways. 
Just being there. Just being. I think it's important. I don't know. I suppose there's a lot of other 
things I could have done, but I decided 18 years ago, this is it. I'm going to do this. And I've 
stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. Sun River Health has just given me the opportunity to work 
with the community this way and I've enjoyed it. It's something that I wish we had more of in our 
health care system. I just wish the importance of having someone help you navigate this 
complicated...It is a complicated system. And it's an expensive system. And just like immigration 
reform, I'm not sure we are ever we're going to get real health care reform either. 
Elinor Levy  (01:11:47): 
But we have Sun River. At least here. And that's one of the reasons I've stuck with Sun River 
because the mission hasn't changed in 40 plus years. They so easily could have lost its way and it 
didn't. And especially in this big change in the merger, it's been really impressive to see that it 
goes on the way it started. Sorry, Aaron. 
Aaron Paige (01:12:13): 
I was just going to say Sun River and individuals like yourself, Ed, who are doing this work. 
Elinor Levy  (01:12:21): 
For those of us who can't do medical work or haven't chosen that path, it's a comfort to know that 
there are people. 
Edward Frederick (01:12:32): 
Yeah and it's important to be that that person. It's rewarding. I had a friend who passed away a 
few years ago. He was kind of a mentor of mine. His specialty was philosophy of kind of 
theology. And he gave me access to his library. So I do a lot of reading of philosophy and 
theology and whatever. Just trying to figure out the big questions in life, you know. I think 
relating with people and working with people and being able to have that real person-to-person 
experience and contact is really important to help answer those big questions. What is it all 
about? What does it all mean? Where do we go from here? 
Elinor Levy  (01:13:40): 
Sometimes I wish I had a community health worker. 
Edward Frederick (01:13:45): 
I just enjoy working with people. That's what has kept me in this. I work construction. I enjoy the 
physical work of it and all, but the business aspect, I was not a good business person. I'm not a 
good business person. It was interesting and it kept me going for many years while my kids were 
in college. I enjoy this kind of work a lot more. My boy is a physical therapist. One of my 
daughters...I have four grandkids now. My wife finally retired, so she can be with the grandkids 
more. And they all live in the area, which is great. One went to Smith College. One went to 
Northeastern in Boston and the other one went to Ithaca. One became an educator and was in 
Peace Corps. The other one has worked with Simon's Rock College and has done a lot of 
different things with her in that area. And my son's a physical therapist, a doctor of physical 
therapy. 
Aaron Paige (01:15:07): 
All involved in their own forms of service work. 
Edward  (01:15:12): 
Yeah, exactly. 
Aaron Paige (01:15:15): 
Thank you so much. 
Einor Levy (01:15:19): 
Yes, thank you.
