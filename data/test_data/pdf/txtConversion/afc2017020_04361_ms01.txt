00:00:00 -- Introductory Slate // Interview Lede 
00:01:00 -- Early Life & Childhood: Growing Up in Laos & Saigon //  Seeking Asylum & 
Refugee Experiences 
●
Amp shares his story of growing up in Laos, and his family’s journey to seek political asylum 
in 1978; and living in a refugee camp in Thailand until 1986
●
Phuong Mai was born on March 8th, 1968; her family escaped Saigon on April the 30th at 
noon, when the communist ﬂag began to ﬂy over the embassy in Saigon. She describes her 
family’s “lucky” journey of being able to leave, immediately, via a Navy boat from Vietnam to 
the Philippines, then to Guam (via an American merchant boat); and then arriving in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania before moving to Columbus, in September of 1975. 
●
Amp discusses ﬁnally getting to move from Thailand to a refugee camp in the Philippines, 
where his family was prepared for life in the U.S.
●
00:05:00 -- discussion of culture and foodways in the Thai refugee camp, for Amp’s family; 
he recalls that the food sources and UN “care package” wasn’t especially matched to Laotian 
or Asian cuisine; it included things like tuna and SPAM in a can; Amp describes the 
separation of diﬀerent cultural and ethnic groups at refugee camps; “we’re talking 
30,000-40,000 refugees, in one camp; of course you’re going to have problems.” Amp notes 
that refugee camps were settled in the poorest places in the country, and used to help build-
up and develop those parts of the country; and once those cities were developed, they would 
move the refugee camps to other regions. 
●
00:06:50 -- Phuong Mai describes why the process was much easier for her family; “because 
we left right after the war”; she describes getting onto the boat because a priest hanged up 
his white undershirt to the communist leaders. She describes how her dad has been captured 
in 1954 after her dad sold him out to the Communist Party (her grandfather was a landlord) -- 
“When you are an elite or family, one of the family members have to be captured, to be 
punished. People did not understand that. American people didn’t understand that concept. 
Communism is not a great thing to have.”
●
00:08:20 -- Amp describes the Communist takeover of Laos, that had been a monarchy; his 
dad had been a high-ranking oﬃcial in the former Laos government. His father was tortured 
and sent to a labor camp, and had been beaten mentally and physically.
●
00:09:00 -- Phuong Mai shares similar experiences from her family; her dad was captured 
and sent inside a red ant hole to be tortured; Amp shares his father’s experience with 
lymphoma cancer after having so many terrible experiences; and very little care was available 
in the refugee camp
●
00:09:50 -- Phuong Mai describes how her mother sent her uncles and dad with their oldest 
sons to go to the harbor, and ﬁnd an escape route; and her sister connected them, and they 
all left, and piled into a Jeep, and went to the harbor; otherwise, she said, her mom had 
prepared to kill the family with rat poisoning in the soup.
●
00:10:40 [Amp shows his identiﬁcation photos from the refugee camp.]
00:11:26 -- Arrival in the U.S.// Moving to Ohio (Phuong Mai); Waiting at the Thai 
Refugee Camp (Amp) 
●
Phuong Mai describes growing up, as an elementary-schooler in Harrisburg, as a part of an 
Army camp for Vietnamese refugees (for six months or so); then, her family was sponsored 
by Father Burns at a Catholic Church in Worthington -- her family had ten kids, and had to 
wait for a sponsor that would take everyone and not break up the family unit 
●
00:13:25 -- Amp describes scarcity of water and diﬃculty of living conditions in the refugee 
camp in Thailand; and waiting for sponsorship from a desirable country -- two of his 
brothers escaped to Thailand and got admitted to America faster, because they had been 
selected by the Communists to go to Russia to study, and they escaped instead; the rest of his 
family got stuck in a bottleneck for over a decade, with many other refugees from Laos, 
Vietnam, Thailand, Burma
●
00:15:00 -- Amp & Phuong Mai describe how much they love the U.S. and losing all of their 
family wealth, savings, clothes, in 1975; “everything you ever owned, that’s been wiped-out, 
and state-owned.” Phuong Mai describes the precarity of her family, going from extreme 
wealth (having a chauﬀeur that picked her dad up to work) to extreme poverty -- her dad was 
Assistant Chief of Police in Saigon before the Communist victory; and became a janitor at 
the Catholic Church that sponsored her family. Amp’s dad was a police commissioner, and 
the family had a maid and a chauﬀeur; “they took away everything that you own. Forget 
about having an occasion; the dream is just about having enough food to eat.”
●
00:17:20 -- Phuong Mai describes that the ﬁrst-wage of refugees were mostly bureaucrats and 
the educated class “who knew what Communism was going to be like,” ﬂeeing for fear of 
torture; (Amp: “people who work for the federal government”); he describes the second wave 
as being “peasants” and others looking for economic opportunity, not fearing immediate 
political asylum for fear of harm
●
00:18:30 -- Amp’s family was not able to escape, because his father was captured in 1975; his 
mother had to run around the country trying to ﬁnd his father and write letters to get him 
released; his family did not ﬁnd him for three years
●
00:19:00 -- Phuong Mai’s family had the sense that the Communist Party leadership would 
not be good for her family; “they don’t care who you are. They just do it for their own glory. 
Communism is not to share … they just do it for their own glory. It’s not for the common 
people.”
●
00:19:49 -- Amp and Phuong Mai discuss why they don’t go back to visit Vietnam/Laos; “I 
grew up in the states. This is my home, right here.” Phuong Mai has been here for forty plus 
years, Amp for thirty-two; they have never gone back. Phuong Mai says, “My aunt and uncle, 
whoever … they’re strangers to me. I know them just by name.” Amp’s older sister and 
brother stayed in Laos; but they don’t know each other that well; when his family left Laos, 
he was eight years old; “I don’t even know much about the place I was born. People always 
ask me crazy questions, ‘You been there? I been here …’; and I’m like, ‘Good for you. I don’t 
really even know much about that place.  You ask me about the United States; I’ve been to 
over forty diﬀerent states …” (00:20:00)
00:21:40 -- Phuong Mai’s Family’s Life in Columbus // Amp’s Family’s Eventual 
Migration to California 
●
Phuong Mai discusses her family’s arrival to Columbus and starting school at St. Michael’s 
Catholic Church; she and her siblings were pushed back a few grades because of the language 
barrier; she discusses her family’s move to Neil Avenue, alongside 5th Avenue, close to Ohio 
State University campus; and then they moved to an old house across from the Josephum on 
23rd, by Worthington; family rented the house until 1981
●
00:23:50 -- Navigating the family’s Buddhism while being sponsored by a Catholic Church; 
her father was going to have the family convert, but Father Burns at the sponsoring church 
told the family that they should keep their religion. Phuong Mai describes how her family 
would visit Father Burns every day that he was still alive, even at the retirement facility, until 
he passed away.
●
00:24:50 -- Amp shares about how his family was similarly sponsored by a Church group in 
San Francisco, and then migrated to San Diego; Amp describes growing up Buddhist and 
with an open mind about religion; “I don’t believe that Catholic is better than Buddhism, or 
Buddhism is better than Christian, or anything; as a person, I’m just open-minded.” Amp 
describes studying the Bible and picking up “an additional education … along the way.” Amp 
describes his equanimity and being with people from all backgrounds; but being “prejudiced” 
against “idiots,” regardless of their race, gender or background. 
●
00:28:40 -- Amp describes meeting Phuong Mai
●
00:29:44 -- Phuong Mai & Amp describe some of the pressures of being (almost) ﬁrst-
generation immigrants/refugees to the U.S., and being asked to go to school and do 
something with their lives; “education will always be the backbone of everything”; both grew 
up with hearing that becoming a doctor, lawyer or engineer was to be successful; but Amp 
describes some of the diﬃculties, because it’s such a diﬀerent place and culture in the U.S. 
than where their families came from; “When in Rome …”; Amp discusses “natural selection” 
and the importance of adapting to culture in the U.S.
00:32:00 -- Family Foodways & Adjustments to U.S. Foodways 
●
Amp describes that his mom and sisters did most of the cooking growing up, even at the 
refugee camps; his mother was Vietnamese, and his father was Laotian, so he got to enjoy 
both cuisines; but mostly they ate Vietnamese food.
●
Amp and Phuong Mai discuss alot of the diﬀerences between Vietnamese/Laotian food (“it’s 
a very lean cuisine”) and American (“very fatty”); Phuong Mai discusses her family’s early 
challenges ﬁnding Chinese and other grocery stores that would have critical ingredients they 
needed for their family cooking -- including taking road-trips with family friends to D.C., to 
get the ingredients that they need; and purchasing seeds to garden and grow Vietnamese 
vegetables at the old house across from the Josepheum -- mints, gourds, tropical fruits, etc.  
Phuong Mai and Amp go on to discuss the wider variety of fruits available, including lots of 
varieties of mangoes, and bananas; and the poverty of seasonings available in the U.S.: “in 
America, you have mayonnaise, you have ketchup …”
●
00:35:50 -- Finding/sourcing Vietnamese & Laotian ingredients upon their families’ arrivals in 
the U.S.; Amp’s family had more selections because they moved to California, where there 
was a bigger Southeast Asian population
●
00:37:00 -- Adjusting to U.S. diets; not eating as much fatty food or fermented foods; critical 
importance of proteins for Vietnamese cuisine; observing diﬀerences between diﬀerent 
cuisines in the U.S. -- beans, for example, aren’t eaten as a savory dish; instead, they’re for 
desserts, except in a rice cake; discussion of diﬀerences in U.S. -vs.- Vietnamese dessert 
cultures (not liking chocolate)
●
00:40:37 -- Discussing Amp & Phuong Mai’s personal foodways as kids/teenagers, newly-
arrived in the U.S.; Amp describes how much he loves McDonald’s and loving the free meal 
program at his school; Phuong Mai: “after forty-three years, I still don’t like American food 
that much .... I hate cheese.” Amp says he loves cheese. Phuong Mai says she loves to cook 
Italian food. Amp says he doesn’t like Italian food. 
00:42:30 -- Planning Lives & Careers in the U.S.; The First Business: A Sewing Company 
●
Phuong Mai knew she was going to Ohio State University, and planned on studying business, 
but thought the course of study looked too easy; so she decided to study operations 
management. She knew she didn’t want to work for anybody else, so had her goal set in mind 
from the time she was nineteen.
●
Amp (00:43:30) knew he wanted to make money to buy a car; he didn’t have a plan, but 
wanted “to make something out of my life” -- he became a programmer. 
●
After college (00:45:00), Phuong Mai becomes an ESL teacher in Columbus Public Schools, 
working in elementary schools, following a curriculum and did one-on-one tutoring; she 
decided she couldn’t do it forever because it wasn’t her major, so she went to work at a 
pharmacy and became a pharmacy tech and did operations manager; she was oﬀered a 
weekend supervisor position and did that for a year, and then was looking for an oﬀering for 
a full-time job there; at the time, her father-in-law had cancer, and Phuong Mai wasn’t able to 
use her comp’d time to be with Amp’s father as he was dying from cancer; “why do I have to 
be there to manage people in their 20s and 30s?” So, this other worker was promoted over 
Phuong Mai. 
●
00:49:00 -- Amp’s sister had been trained in sewing by the communists; so Amp and Phuong 
Mai decided to launch their own sewing alterations company, and to work with large-scale 
Columbus-based corporations like the Limited and Victoria’s secret; these garments, Amp 
explains, are purchased by these U.S. companies in bulk from lots of diﬀerent distributors 
from diﬀerent places (with diﬀerent labels); and then they outsource, to companies like 
Phuong Mai and Amp’s, who do “corrections” and “quality control” to put in consistent 
labels. 
●
00:52:00 -- Discussion of changes in the corrections industry and the rise of competition in 
the retail industry
00:53:20 -- Origins of Indochine Café & Establishing Indochine’s Kitchen Culture 
●
Phuong Mai discusses that she’d wanted a restaurant for a long time, before, even the sewing 
business began, because she loved to cook; there weren’t alot of Asian restaurants around in 
the 1980s-1990s, and she knew she could make better food
●
Amp interrupts and discusses, “long story short,” that they found an old Vietnamese 
restaurant called Little Saigon; Phuong Mai describes holding out on a price and eventually 
getting the business after a year -- “just for the place, because they had the kitchen and 
everything”; and because they purchased an established building, they already had customers 
and everything
●
Neither had worked in the restaurant industry before; Amp shares that he never was a cook, 
and grew up in a family with alot of sisters, and never had to do the cooking; Amp declares 
himself the head chef (Phuong Mai and Jess debate this.)
●
00:56:00 -- Building up a menu for the new Indochine Café from the ground up; Phuong Mai 
created the whole menu from scratch. Shares about the origins of her recipes, largely from 
staples they cooked for their family at home. She was especially excited to put some Lao 
dishes on the menu, because there weren’t any Lao dishes available in Columbus at the time 
-- for example, the papaya salad. Amp describes how there aren’t alot of “mixed” salads 
available on menus in the U.S.; it’s largely about dressed salads. Other additions were the 
home-made noodles, that they use in a Lao vegetable soup; the beef salad is another Lao dish 
on the menu, which is diﬀerent than a Thai or Vietnamese version -- “we do three diﬀerent 
versions!” 
●
00:59:00 -- Discussion of pho as something that is eaten at all times in Vietnamese culture, 
breakfast, lunch and dinner
●
01:00:00 -- Learning how to run a scratch kitchen; going shopping for the restaurant every 
single day to make sure all produce is fresh, and even going through the palettes of produce 
in the back before she selects it for the restaurant; Amp describes how every order is made 
fresh for each customer’s order; “if you order wrong -- I can’t sell it to other customers, 
because it’s for you!”
●
01:01:40 -- Amp describes his attitude towards customer service; “you don’t own me”; it’s his 
job to serve his customers, but not to bow to them; “Make no mistake, we are very nice 
people!” But, the menu does say: “DON’T PISS AMP OFF :)”
●
01:02:00 -- Phuong Mai discusses working with and bringing on back-of-house kitchen staﬀ, 
learning to standardize recipes, and working to ensure that everyone in the kitchen makes 
recipes the way she does … not the way they already do
01:03:00 -- Indochine’s Staffing Situation: Running a Family Business // Menu 
Specialties & Vegetarian/Vegan Versions of Menu Items 
●
Phuong Mai describes working with her (college-aged) daughters and their friends, during 
their summer breaks
●
Phuong Mai goes back-of-house to cook particularly challenging dishes for customers; “I 
cater to customers with particular palettes”
●
01:04:20 -- Phuong Mai describes how her Buddhist religion and her mom’s decision to 
become a Buddhist nun made their family cook a ton of vegetarian food; “it was like second 
nature … you didn’t have to change anything, you just substitute … so you had to season it 
well, learn how to cook it well, so it tastes good. So you want to mimic real food …”; Phuong 
Mai takes on making alot of the dishes into vegetarian versions
●
01:05:00 -- Phuong Mai discusses running the catering side of the business; and making 
dishes oﬀ-the-menu, and Asian baked goods; “nobody [else] knows how to do that”
●
Everyone else back-of-house cooks the same standard menu items
●
Current business has been open over 13 years; and Indochine moved to this location in 2008
●
01:07:50 -- [Amp shows photos of the original building that became today’s Indochine; and Amp and 
Phuong Mai discuss the renovation and rehab of the building, when the business moved in 2008] -- it 
took the family nine months to reopen the business, after rehabbing the building from 
scratch, rebuilding the kitchen, etc.; “we almost ﬁled bankruptcy!” -- Phuong Mai
●
Amp shares about the diﬃculty of being an entrepreneur; “Your friends will leave you, 
because you won’t have any time for them; and you can’t go to the bank either … because you 
lost nine months of income. And we all have mortgage payments, credit card payment …” 
01:10:00 -- Wages & Making It Work, as a Family Business // Mom-and-Pop Restaurant 
Culture  
●
Phuong Mai discusses bringing in other non-family workers as family members; “treating 
them as older sibling”; and she notes that everyone they hire has historically had a 
connection to the family
●
Amp: “The mentality is, you have to treat people right, if you want them to stay long …”
●
Phuong Mai notes that the structure is kind of ﬂuid; they have cooks who are friends and 
family members come in to help them out, and then go work elsewhere; both discuss loyalty, 
and maintaining an open kitchen culture (“they eat whatever they want)
●
Amp notes that “it’s not your typical corporation job, 8-5; it’s the hardest job … and the 
compensation is never there; when you start out, it’s really hard, you have alot of overhead.” 
He discusses how he and Phuong Mai don’t pay themselves; whatever they make, they invest 
back in the business, to try to pay their debts. Amp notes that many small businesses fail, 
because alot of friends start businesses and want to pay themselves; Phuong Mai notes that 
they are able to manage because their mortgage is low, and “we don’t have to pay other 
people”
●
01:15:00 -- Phuong Mai & Amp discuss cutting down their hours now that their daughters 
are in college, and don’t have as much time to help out; now, the restaurant is closed two days 
a week; “I told him … it’s not the same, and I’m tired; and we’ve got to be able to just work, 
make a little money … enough money to send the kids to college; less money, but more 
happier. More content with your health. Because, when you die: what can you do with the 
money?” 
●
Amp describes that one of the best parts of owning his own business is getting to spend time 
with his family (nieces and daughters’ friends work at the restaurant, as well); beneﬁts of 
growing up in the restaurant teaching their daughters people skills, and helping them build 
connections in Columbus and in the world; Amp: “this business is sentimental value to us”
01:17:00 -- Front-of-House: Service Industry, Relationships with Customers, & 
Navigating Respect 
●
01:17:15 -- Phuong Mai & Amp discuss their personal connections & friendships to 
customers, and the relationships they’ve built through the restaurants; and watching 
customers’ friends grow up; Amp claims that he is too “busy” with the production side of the 
restaurant, and Phuong Mai is more “sentimental” 
●
01:20:00 -- Wages & family labor: daughters are paid in allowances, but don’t necessarily 
make wages; Amp reiterates that he & Phuong Mai don’t draw a salary; there’s one other 
cook, and this cook is on salary -- “There’s only three of us, and that’s it.”
●
01:22:28 -- On customer complaints, service, and operating without a big staﬀ when 
daughters aren’t home on break; managing expectations; Amp reﬂects on how American 
customers think, “if I have money to buy your food, I own you”; and expectations of paying 
less and treating workers worse at Asian restaurants because they expect food will be cheap/
fast; Phuong Mai reﬂects on demanding respect in the restaurant industry
●
01:26:00 -- Amp discusses reviews on platforms like Yelp, etc.; both reﬂect that, because 
Indochine is a more established restaurant, bad reviews and complaints do not hurt their 
restaurant as much as a new place -- Phuong Mai: “don’t ever do that to a business. You’ll 
hurt them. If you don’t like that business, walk away.”
●
Amp: “Advice to new restaurant owners -- try not to pay too much attention to criticism … 
I’ve become more content … now that I care less about what people think. Believe it or not, 
if I care too much, I can’t sleep at night.”
01:29:00 -- Amp Makes a Pitch for Indochine // Final Reﬂections 
●
Amp wants everyone in Washington D.C. to come & visit Indochine; please do!
●
Phuong Mai: “This place I started  … my husband and I started with my family? It’s just a 
family environment. You don’t have to be rich, you don’t have to be poor. Just come as who 
you are; and enjoy simple food that other places might not give you, with reasonable prices. 
We come from both sides, a big family; we both understand -- incomes are hard to come 
[by], with big families; so sharing this with people, the community, is more important to me 
… and more rewarding.”
00:01:30 -- Concluding Slate, Thanks & Goodbyes
