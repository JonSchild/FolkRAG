BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF 
MESSRS. CONNERS AND KELLY. 
The following brief skfatch of the career of Messrs. Conners and Kelly 
will lie read with interest. 
I 
take it from a 
Sheffield contemporary— 
The Era—of March 29th: 
"Those gentlemen are two of the greatest song and dance artists the 
world has over produced. America has the privilege of claiming them, 
Plashing, U. S.. being the place of their birth. 
After a 
series of un-
parallele,i triumphs in America they came to England, and made their 
first appearance at the Oxford Music hail, London, on the 24th ofJune, 
IS7S. where they achieved a tremendous success. 
During tile four 
months they remained in the metropolis they were engaged at all the 
priricipal Music Dans, and were pronounced unanimously, by press 
and public, to be the best American artists that had crossed the At-
lantic. 
‘• Leaving. London. they went on a 
provincial tour, appearing in most 
of tha principal cities and towns of Great Britain and Ireland with un-
deviating success. 
-Then they fulfilled an engagement of one month in the city of Tou-
louse, France, that being the place where they first appeared before a 
French audience, who were not slow to appreciate their talents and 
abilities. Their next engagement was at Bordeaux (also for one month), 
after which they went to the Foiles Bergere, Paris, for another month, 
where 1 
hey met with a 
most gratifying recep*Ion. 
"Oa th2 termination of their engagements in France, they returned 
to Eturlan(1 to fulfil contracts previously made with Mr. J. Stansfield, 
of Deeds and Halifax. at the termination of which they came to Shef-
field to take parts in Mr. William R. Younge's most successful panto-
mime of Robinson Crusoc. , Mr. Conners playing the part of Friday, 
alai Mr. Kelly that of Saturday — each with unbounded success. 
In 
their knock-about business it will be universally admitted they are 
unrivaled. while as dancers and vocalists they are firat elasa. 
"Those who have seen the pantomime will remember Messrs. Con-
ners and Kelly. as Saturday and Friday, for many a 
longday to come. 
Singing or dancing. these two gentlemen were always seen to advant-
age, while in their knock-about business they invariably brought down 
the house: and we do not hesitate to remark that without them the 
pantomime would not have been so successful as it has been. 
"We have much pleasure in quoting a 
critique from our issue of 
February 2d: ' One of the chief features of the pantomime is the su-
perb knock-about business of Messrs. Conners and Kelly, who play the 
parts of Friday and Saturday. 
The antics of these gentlemen are 
laughable in tile extreme, besides exciting the wonder and admiration 
of all who have had the good fortune to see them. , 
'• Owing to the enormous amount of success they attained during. 
their last visit to France, they return to Paris on the first of May next 
to fulfill an engagement of three months, after which they will return 
to England again for twelve months, previous to going back to Amer-
ica. 
We understand that during their forthcoming English tour they 
will pay a 
visit of two weeks to the Alhambra, in this town, next Sep-
tember. when their many admirers will again have the plea.sure of 
seeing them. Wherever they may go, we are confident they will be 
accompanied by the good wishes of all who know them; and it is our 
earnest wish that their abilities will always meet with the same grati-
k
eirag
.nreward that has distinguished their visit to our town of Shef-
RAMBLER.

Pray give us your attention, 
And we will try and show to you, 
We put the rest all in the shade, 
When we put down the shoes.

Swells, swells, two colored swells, 
Look at our figure we are two high-toned.

Swells, swells, two colored swells, 
The ladies admire us two colored swells. 
We have danced to every nation, 
To the Dutch and the Chinese; 
We have danced up hill and down again, 
We have danced upon the seas, 
We know two pretty yeller girls, 
To win them we will try, 
We will dance into their affection, 
We will until we die.

She's as sweet as sugar cane, 
This cream colored queen; 
She was the sweetest creature 
That ever you had seen. 
She has a 
roguish eye, 
And ber features they were fair, 
Her lips were like the roses, 
And coal black was her hair. 
CHORUS. 
For they all did say she was so mighty gay, (Brea.) 
There was many a 
lovely creature who made 
the people stare, (Break.) 
But the lovely one among them all, 
Was the girl with the coal black hair. 
When the ball was over, 
In the carriage we did hop, 
And as we drove along the streets, 
The question I 
did pop. 
She said, go way, you nigger, 
How dare you ask me, 
For I'm a 
female buffer, 
And colored aristocrat.

Oh ! yet, we are'two senators, 
Swells of the fashion, you see, 
For you seldom find two figs,

Since our emancipation; 
Although we had our fun at times, 
We can't forget our station. (Break.) 
Now everything is settled right, 
To each one's satisfaction, 
And as it's settled, we will not fight, 
It would surely cause distraction. 
Chorus.. 
I 1FONG BY CONNORS & KELLY. 
Keep your eyes on us children from the south, 
We are as happy as the little birds in the tree; 
Hair so tighht that we can't sut our mouth, 
And we are are just as happy as can be, oh 
CnoLue. 
Dancing, singing, shouting all the day, 
Music makes us feel so good, as chickens in the bay, 
Singing, dancing to pass the time away. 
Happy little children from the south. 
When the coons they give a 
fancy ball, 
How they watch us niggers promenade the hall, 
For singing and for dancing, we can beat them all, 
We are the happy little children from the south. 
Chorus. 
I 
thought I 
heard some one singing, 
Dey are waiting, waiting; 
Dem Christian bells are ringing, 
Dey are waiting dar for me. 
I 
thought I 
saw deni coming, 
Dey are waiting, waiting, 
Wid all de children running, 
Dey are waiting dar for me. 
CHORUS. 
My ole Aunty Caroline, 
Isaac, Bob and Lee, 
A 
standing on de hillside, 
A 
waiting dar for me. 
De time will not be very long, 
Dey are waiting, waiting; 
When we hear that mighty song, 
Dey are maiting dar for me. 
Den you will be up in de sky, 
Dey are waiting, waiting, 
The people on the mountain cry, 
Dey are waiting dar for me. 
Saddle up my old grey mare, 
Dey are waiting, waiting, 
Ise gwine dar to meet my boss, 
Dey're waiting dar for me. 
I 
will bid you niggers all good-bye, 
Dey are waiting, waiting, 
I 
will meet you all up in de sky, 
Dey are waiting dar for me.

If you will listen unto me; 
I

friend to Michael Murphy, 
And to Johnny Dockertee. 
And should you meet me out, 
Wherever you pass me by. 
The little boys are bound to shout, 
And grown up people cry.

Who appears in the best of attire;

Take this in bed to-night; 
You will wake up in the morning sure, 
And find yourself all right. 
Spoken; Yes, and then they say to themselves,

THE WORKING MAWS APPEAL/ 
OR THE TIN BUCKET BRIGADE, 
1.13 RECITED WITH TREMENDOUS SUCCESS,-
BY BABY HART. 
OOPYRIGHT 1881, n 
Y 
WM. J. A. LIEDER. 
ALL BIGHTS RESERVED. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near, 
The columns are marching, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. tho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor doth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigade 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten ard stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigade. 
THE SOLDIER BOYS. 
IR DONE 33Y CONNORS & KELLY AT THEATRE BOLT, 
SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND, 
When we were ordered off to war, 
We shook again- with fear; 
And every one but Con and I, 
Gave a 
hearty ringing cheer. 
We tried to belt but soon were caught, 
In the guard room we were stack, 
We had to live on jelly, 
Till we could find our pluck. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's three cheers for the army, 
And God save the queen; 
If it wasn't for the army, 
Why in jail we would have been. 
We were never made for work, 
When they would fight we would run:away, 
Then three cheers for the army, 
And our little Bob. 
But now we have returned you see, 
With honors more or less; 
He got his from a 
dead Zulu, 
I 
got mine from the mess. 
They're going to make us serjeants, 
For our bravery on the field, 
We seiged two fields of turnups, 
And then we wouldn't yield. — _ Chorus. 
THE WORK-HOUSE DOOR. 
WRITTEN BY JAMES SF,T.TS 
One day as I 
walked through the streets, 
Not knowing where to go; 
My eyes fell on a 
little boy, 
Close to the work-house door. 
He was crying so, I 
went to him, 
And scarcely could he speak; 
And I 
thought that very moment 
His little heart would break. 
He said his mother, she was dead, 
His father could not work, 
No shoes had he upon his feet, 
Nor had he any shirt; 
So I 
took him to my home, 
He thanked me o'er and o'er. 
And some more strange sights I 
saw, 
As I 
stood by the work-house door. 
The next I 
saw was a 
woman, 
For relief she came to look, 
Two children she had in her arms, 
Wrapped in a 
ragged cloak; 
And she turned round as though 
She knew not the way to go in; 
My heart it bled to see her, 
The state that she was in. 
She said that she had lost her husband 
He'd been killed upon the line; 
And now she had to beg for bread, 
Or else to starve and pine, 
As the tears were rolling down her cheeks, 
I 
thought God help the poor; 
She turned around and then went in, 
As I 
stood by the work-house door. 
The last I 
saw was an old man, 
Who oonld hardly crawl or stand; 
And he looked to me as if his time 
Was very near at hand. 
He asked me could I 
spare a 
coin, 
I 
gave him all I 
had; 
And he thanked me many times for it, 
lie seemed so very glad. 
He said he'd been a 
soldier, 
That had fought for his country; 
But now the times are very hard, 
His brightest days he'd seen; 
He had served almost five years, 
And now he's old and almost wogs, 
It was a 
disgraceful sight to see him 
Standing by the work-house door,

THE OPINIONS OF AN HONEST 
WORKING MAN. 
RUNG T.SY CONNORS it KELLY. 
I 
stood beside a 
factory when the mid-day 
meal was o'er, 
And the workmen were awaiting the recall to 
toil once more, 
I 
saw one honest fellow who against the gate did lean 
With a 
pipe between the finger of his honest 
and brawny hand; 
A 
gentlemen approached him, and said your 
pardon, pray, 
I 
should like to hear a 
workman's view on the 
question of the day; 
Said the workman to the other, I 
will tell you If I 
can 
The straight forward opinion of an honest 
working man. 
Said the gentleman, come tell me, don't you 
think the school board grand, 
And the sort of institution that will benefit the land, 
The rising generation they will properly be taught, 
And receive an education of a 
sound and proper sort.. 
Said the workman you are excellent at feeding 
of the minds, 
—15— 
THE OPINIONS OF AN HONEST 
WORKING MAN. 
CONTINUED, 
But a-feeding of the bellies you are a 
rare long 
way behind.. 
You fill their heads with knowledge while 
sometimes they starve for cran, 
And these are the opinions of an honest working man. 
Said the gentleman now tell me do you really like 
To hear the cembinations of workmen on tho strike, 
There's the agricultural laborers grumbling at 
their pay. 
And threatning to strike again, we read the other day, 
Said the workman, strikes are very bad, but if 
I 
the truth must speak. 
You cannot keep a 
wife and family on seven 
dollars a 
week, 
To combine for better wages seems their only plan. 
And these are the opinion of an honest working man. 
Said the gentleman, pray tell me now about the 
state of trade, 
Don't you think that these war rumors, great 
depression they have made. 
And would not it be better, and all our joys increase, 
If for a 
lenghtened period the world could be at peace 
Said the poorman all I 
know sir, is whenever 
we have war, 
It always presses hardest on the lowly and the poor, 
But if enemies attack us, I 
myself would lead the van 
And these were the opinions of all honest working man 
BONO BY NILES & EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
% 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Ovalle a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chow :lilt day.

THE BLUE AHATIAM MINIMS 
BY CLARABKLL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADAM& 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
bagel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A- de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway ! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed. 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait al way, 
A-de, A- de, A- de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian wountains, 
Caine a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known. 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A- de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
PARODY ON 
ON EMPTY CRADLE, 
WRITTEN AND STJNG BY CRAB. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenns, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseiug milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grounds 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
! 
how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Cnoaus. 
Be has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

There is a 
lad lives upon our floor, 
He sings a 
song called the Hallway Door; 
He can beat Levy's Cornet; or Gihnore's Band. 
When he's singing The Sheeneys in the Saud, 
With my daughter Mary he cuts a 
dash. 
She told me last night he was her " mash;" 
She says to him, Tommy you son of a 
gun, 
Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some ton. 
Last Sunday when I 
came from mass, 
Re asked me over to have a 
glass; 
Says I, I'll take a 
drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again. 
I 
sang a 
song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the taw& 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fun. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
GreacoRoman fall. 
It he comes to the house next Sunday night 
I 
will fire him down a 
a 
couple of flight, 
And get the police to give him a 
run, 
For setting me drunk to have some fun.

Sure we thot' we'd make a 
call, 
And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, • 
And invited all the young fclks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police,

pol-i-tic-al party. 
Ile came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty.

Ahi the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six- day walke-4. 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin-a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called him witty, 
And MoGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Flood sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and 'Ilia Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's parry. Cho.. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we thol was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the slipper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGni-iness swore the whiskey was all waters, 
All around 'twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

BURLESQUE ON AILEEN ALANA. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS GLIDDEN. 
Aileen Alanna, Aileen asthore, 
Was born in the country, 
Along with Barnum's Show; 
They cut her eye teeth with a 
brick, 
And raised her like a 
calf; 
And she done flip flaps on a 
baulkey horse, 
And made the gillies laugh. 
Ceonus. 
Oh! yes, she was a 
crusher, 
And she used to grease her musc!e, 
She wore a 
patent corset, 
And a 
double breasted bustle. 
She'd throw her eye at all the guys, 
As round the ring she went, 
And she chewed plug tobacco like a 
horse. 
Aileen Alanna, oh! how that girl could mil 
She had a 
mouth like a 
railroad crossing, 
Teeth like a 
cross cut pile, 
Her favorite dish was cross-eyed fish, 
She said it gave her brain; 
She went to a 
dentist, he pulled her breath, 
And she liked to went insane. 
Chorus. 
I 
wonder where her daddy is, 
If he only found it out, 
Perhaps he swallowed a 
porous plaster, 
Or else he's got the gout. 
Perhaps he's doing a 
song and dance, 
Way up in that back room, 
Oh! daddy, dear daddy come home. 
Cher 
Aileen Alanna, some one set her drunk, 
Tony Pastor found her, 
And held her under a 
pump; 
Brother Beacher took her home, 
And sent her off to bed, 
And old John Robinson, 
Rubbed blue glass on her head.

It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sun, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
Pram all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ah I 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was ligh‘ 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me. 
Rayless without a

Grim death I 
thought I

And every evening I 
would go, 
Her lovely face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow,

saw no harm, 
And lots of fun I'd always have, 
Before I'd left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'll own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness,

-I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild. 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blew 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow„ 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled 1, i.h delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

They are set in tears, and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Chorus. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad wild dream, 
Cherished and loved yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts ainoE.g, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kiss'd by :death. 
Oh sorrowful songs unsung.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's 01;rien with his high water pugs. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
eager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Obo• 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brock, 
We filo t 
we'd just drop into Geoghan's. 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gan b

all cried, there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar- tender shot me a 
glance, 
flowld your tongues," then said he to the !
Dames, 
That's O'Brien with his high•water pants.

Oh ! I'll tell you of a 
party, boys, 
I 
attended here last night, 
It was down at Casey's in the old sixth ward, 
Now it was an elegant sight. 
There ww, singing. yes and dancing, 
And , hiskey there, galore 
And the boys would smile, and the girls put on stylo, 
A.e they danced and welt the floor.

Wid me thah-sha-shin-go-mis-ka Joe, 
And around on their toes they danced jost so, 
At Casey's ball, last night. 
Oh ! we kept the ball a- rolling boys, 
'I ill the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey. swallowed glass and a, 
With the laughing I 
nearly died, 
Then we all flew for the kitchen, 
Put the turkey out of sight, 
Little Widow Dunn by the whole crowd was mug, 
Aad they kept it up all night.
Ciior 
-IT DOW BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
Cnoatis. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
'You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown., 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh 
what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to mft.

Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar,

Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,'

Firm in our hearts all the wide world

Of a 
pretty Irish girl, her teeth as bright as pearls, 
And such rosy cheeks, I 
never saw before; 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night. 
Sure she is the only girl that I 
adore. 
She is like the birds of May, singing all the day, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lane,' 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen, 
for eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night. 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen that's her name, and she lives down 
in the lane, 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the wetl. 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
ru present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will away, 
And I'll marry my pretty Irish Queen. 
Chorus. 
MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
- 
EVERY DAY, 
I've ft nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meek 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORrs. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid MA, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurIc, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, • my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

And ha swallowed it with glee,

THE TRAMP. 
RZCZTELD BY FRANK Mac. 
!Ammo sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we - 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothe; 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I

lie was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, ' 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
lie was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
Ile'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day,

01.0 AND ONLY IN THE WAY, 
I 
BOLD IRISHMEN TO THE FRONT, 
AS SUNG BY FRANK LUM. 
The Music of this song is published at M N. Paulte 
Lieder's Extensive Music Publishing House, No. 60 
Chatham Street, N. Y. and will be :- ent post 
paid. to any acid COSS, 0 receipt or piles, 
35 cents in postage stamps. 
As we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent, 
And for shelter he knows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the dem, 
And meet him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way. 
Cnonts. 
So let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long, 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
us may coma, 
When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strika 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spurs 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
CL 
My little song I'm sure is for rich as welt as poor, 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stand, 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power, 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the last, 
To say when old that they are only in the way.. 
Chorus.

eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
Chorus. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you, 
With a 
warm and welcome hand. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her riOats, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the stars and Stripes.

No matter where I

My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I

And if you want a

Why Maloney is the man, 
CHORUS. 
He's well educated and toney, 
His influence is great, 
Shure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Malong. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
but if the boys make fun of me. 
They'll find that I'm no fool.

There's no better in the land,

While strolling through the avenue, 
A 
cottage neat I 
saw; 
A 
maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so sweet, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said, 
That made my heart feel good. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
she's the sweetest flower here. 
And she's the dearest of the dear; 
She's a 
lilly Ore and true, 
A 
fragrant mignonette, 
A 
morning-glory dipped in dew, 
A 
purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and rare, 
My tose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her aide, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my vrifa. 
My rose perfumed bouquet 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone, 
Mtn& 
With my rose perfumed bouquet.

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your griefi 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised, 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chort1C 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old.
