ALC: Sorry, I have to do a little introduction before I do this because I’ve done so many of these.
So this is, I am here with Delores Hardiman Casey in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is September one,
two thousand nineteen. Great!
DC: Is that on?
ALC: I think I’ve turned it on, don’t worry. It’s just making sure the sound levels are right and
stuff like that. Wonderful, thank you so much. And thank you for having me in your lovely home
today, I am just so thrilled. So, okay so what else do you want to show me? Oh good, you kept
them.
DC: Have you seen that?
ALC: Yes, I have.
DC: Okay, okay.
ALC: Stanley keeps all of those so he’s been showing me.
DC: Before we start that, I have a whole box of things.
ALC: Oh good, and thank you so much for this article that has your parents’ names. So Karl and
Anna-
DC: Anna Mae.
ALC: Anna Mae, oh so she went by Mae.
DC: Uh huh.
ALC: Okay. Alrighty. I love this, nineteen forty-two… Eight of July.
DC: Here is something that was in a magazine, February nineteen fifty. From the USDA
newsletter. A very successful negro farmer in Indiana.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh great. Oh thank you for letting us see this. Wow! February nineteen, Karl V Hardiman.
Now, I thought you said he was in Owensville?
DC: That’s where we did, uh huh.
ALC: So is that in Montgomery Township?
DC: Montgomery Township. Alright, see Princeton is in Patoka Township-
ALC: I know. Right.
DC: But when he bought this farm, it was in Montgomery.
ALC: And how many acres did he have?
DC: One- he started out with one hundred acres.
ALC: Oh, my gosh.
DC: Wait a minute.
ALC: This is wonderful. Mr. Hardiman operated his farm of eighty acres under lease, and later
secured a long term loan from Farmers Home Administration. And purchased through Good
Management a hundred acres. He was able to pay off the loan several years ahead of schedule. In
addition to this success, Mr. Hardiman struck oil on his farm, and his royalty plus farm income
has permitted him to build a modern brick residence with all the conveniences, and also a good
barn. Mr. Hardiman has been farming for almost twenty years. He is married and has two
children. That’s-
DC: That’s right.
ALC: One of them is you? Mm hmm. Mr. Hardiman says that the farm programs have been the
salvation for farmers. The Hardiman’s are members of the Wayman Chapel Church. Was that the
one-
DC: Right there at Lyles Station, Wayman Chapel-
ALC: Oh, right! So you went all the way to Lyles Station for church. ‘Cause at one point there
was a little chapel in Montgomery Township, by Antioch Cemetery.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Oh, okay.
ALC: That I know some early, a different Greer family was attending.
DC: Okay.
ALC: But they stopped, I think things changed at that church by like the eighteen fifties.
DC: Okay. Do you know about where our farm is?
ALC: I don’t.
DC: Alright then, alright.
ALC: Can you give me the roads it was on?
DC: Sixty four, going towards Owensville. Oh, wait a minute. Sixty four and then you make a
left on, from sixty four, where it says, there’s a light down there that says “Mount Carmel.”
ALC: Yeah.
DC: Alright, then you make a left there and we’re two or three miles there.
ALC: Okay, okay. That is really-
DC: Before you get to Owensville.
ALC: ‘Cause there weren’t that many in Montgomery Township. There weren’t that many.
DC: No. We were the only… Well-
ALC: But I mean the first, you’ll see from my book, some of the earliest-
DC: Okay.
ALC: Who came out, this is a different Grier, G-r-i-e-r, was out there buying land in eighteen
fifteen before statehood.
DC: Okay!
6
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: And he started with forty acres and grew it to over two hundred fifty. But he and his wife
Keziah died in… the eighteen seventies.
DC: Okay. Next-
ALC: Yeah. Wow, oh my gosh. This says the US Department of Agriculture war food
administration farm security administration from March, nineteen forty four. So where did this
come out from? ‘Cause you’ve got this-
DC: From the USDA somehow. What does it say there at the top-
ALC: Operates a hundred acre Wabash River bottomland farm near Princeton, Indiana. Is
watching carefully over the forty odd shoats out in his pasture.
DC: We had a picture that went with that, mm hmm.
ALC: And this is an article that came out?
DC: Mm hmm.
[5:00] ALC: Wow. And he got it under the provisions of the bank head Jones farm tenant. I’d
love to get a copy of this, this is amazing.
DC: And, he wanted another farm but they would not sell him that farm. And daddy always said
they held that, that farm was for the white farmer. And so there in Princeton, do you know going’
West there’s a Bob Evans.
ALC: Yep, I can picture that.
DC: Right in back of that there’s where the farm was that daddy wanted.
ALC: Oh…
DC: But see, years ago that was all farmland.
ALC: Right, and he wanted that.
DC: He wanted that, that’s the one. When he was getting ready to apply for a loan for a farm,
that was the farm that he wanted.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh…
DC: And they-
ALC: He couldn’t get it.
DC: He couldn’t get it.
ALC: Wow. Back in nineteen forty-two the Hardiman family produced only seventy-two hundred
gallons of milk from their six dairy cows. Oh my gosh. That’s an amazing amount of milk.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Wow, and his nineteen forty-four milk production from seven cows now being milked
promised to double his nineteen forty-two… That’s so much work.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Oh, this is amazing.
DC: Milk by hand, too.
ALC: Oh my gosh. None of the machines.
DC: Nope, my mother and my father-
ALC: He says, Mrs. Hardiman’s record book shows that only a hundred and three dollars were
spent in nineteen forty-three for food for a family of four. All the rest of their food was raised on
the farm. To do this she canned approximately a hundred quarts of fruits and vegetables per
member of her family.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Oh, I would love it. Oh, my gosh. I’d love to get a copy of this, this is beautiful.
DC: You can, you can.
ALC: This is amazing. Thank you so much.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: That’s all. Now the story that, what’s her name, Quiche, she’s with the Princeton Clarion
News now.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Alright then. I took parts of this and I gave it to her.
ALC: Okay, good.
DC: And that’s how we put that story together.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: Yeah.
ALC: Good, good, good. Yeah. ‘Cause I think these stories, they’re getting lost.
DC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
ALC: They really are, they really are.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: But, so, tell me… ‘Cause you were raised on that farm. Tell me a little bit of what you’d
like people to know about being raised on that farm. Just your memories. ‘Cause there are all
newspaper articles and stuff like that but I’d like your perspective.
DC: Alright. Really and truly, we had, that’s the only life that I knew was being around farming
families. Because my grandparents farmed, and then all two of daddies brothers had farms, and
as far as being in activities in town, in the city, we knew nothing about it because it was all on
the farm. But then, it was a good experience and even though at times I thought, “Why are they
making me do all this work?” But there was a reason for it and I appreciate it now but I
appreciate it later. But then, what I saw, I saw the work ethics that my parents had. And both of
them worked together.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: And my mother, she could drive the tractor and do some things just like my daddy could.
ALC: See, now that’s intriguing to me because I was talking to Mrs. Nolcox, she was visiting
from Ohio-
9
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Maxine, Maxine.
ALC: Maxine, yeah. Travis’s mom-
DC: Mother, yeah.
ALC: Right. And she was saying that your mother, Mae, was really known for being an
incredibly good farmer. ‘Cause I think that people had, I don’t know… It seemed like people had
strict notions about what farming was and what farming wasn’t. But I think that all the women
who lived on the farm were doing a lot of the farming work. It’s just that canning and working in
the vegetable garden wasn't always considered farming.
DC: Right.
ALC: Would you say that was the case? I don’t know. How was farm work defined?
DC: Alright, how was farm work- It came in two phases. There was working on the farm, and
then there was things that had to be done for the family in the house. That’s what I would say.
ALC: Okay, okay.
[10:00] DC: Because there was a time when, after the crops were out, in the meantime we had a
garden. And so when the vegetables were ready from the garden, then that’s when we went to the
phase of mama being’ in the house and providing food for the family.
ALC: Right, right. Right, right.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: But your mom was known for being on the tractor. Right.
DC: My mother would rather be on the tractor than doing things in the house. And she was an
excellent cook, and excellent cook. But she… that’s what they grew up, they kind of, they grew
up together and they started working together, and she worked alongside with him.
ALC: Wow, wow.
DC: Mm hmm. And when he had his accident-
10
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: When did that happen?
DC: Alright, let me see. My father had three accidents. The first accident was he was on the
Brazelton farm and he was picking corn, he stuck his hand in the corn picker, and he lost part of
this thumb, this finger, and this finger.
ALC: So you’re pointing to part of your thumb and then the index finger and the next finger.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Oof. On his right hand?
DC: On the right hand. And he was right handed. And so anyway he was there alone. He didn’t
have anyone helping him. And so mama was home preparing dinner. And so then he got in the
truck and drove to the house and said mama I’ve, mommy I’ve hurt my hand. And so then she
took him to the hospital. And at that time they could not attach the fingers. That was the first
time, and then the second time was… They were, I think they had put in, there was a load of
soybeans, and they were putting the soybeans in the grain bins. And so somehow his clothes got
caught in the auger.
ALC: Wow, oh dear.
DC: Yeah. His jacket sleeve got caught in the auger and that’s when he broke his arm. That was
number two. And then the third thing, daddy had to bale some hay. And the bales of hay were on
the wagon. And so then the wagon was up on what we called the sand farm. And mama, daddy
that morning he had, his mother was in the hospital, so he had gone to the hospital in Mount
Carmel and brought her to her home. And so he told mama, “You stay here with Mommy, and
I’m going’ home and I’m going up to the other farm and I’m going to throw some bales of hay
off the wagon so I can pull the wagon out.” That’s when we think that he was doing that, and he
slipped or what have you and he fell off the-
ALC: And he hit his head.
DC: He hit his head.
ALC: And he died.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Oh, boy.
11
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And see, while he was there mama was over to Grandma Lou’s taking care of her, ‘cause he
told her, “I’ll be over there, I’ll come back and get you at a certain time.” And so when he didn’t
come, then she waited maybe thirty or forty minutes. He didn’t come so she had somebody take
her home, and so she found out that he was not at the house. And then she said that, “Well, he
said he was going up on the sand.” And so that’s where she found him.
ALC: Oh, oh dear.
DC: And so that was it.
ALC: How old were you when that happened?
DC: I was thirty.
ALC: Okay, okay, okay.
DC: And he was sixty-nine.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Sixty-nine.
ALC: Alright, alright. Woo. But even before he died she was working the farm as well.
DC: Yes, yes. She could do everything. She could, she didn’t run the combine, but she could
drive the tractor, plow, disk, do things like that.
ALC: And she did it a lot.
DC: And she did it, yeah.
ALC: How did, obviously your father was okay with that?
DC: He had no problem, they worked together.
ALC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
DC: They worked together, mm hmm.
12
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: But it was, from what I’ve talked to some of the older farmers from that generation they
remember this. They noted it, and they said “She was a really good farmer.”
DC: Right, right.
ALC: She was known to be, yeah.
[15:00] DC: And so when he passed, of course, she had to get someone to farm the land because
she couldn't do it by herself. And so then we had farmers, several farmers, to come and ask, “I
know this is, you know, Karl had just passed and I know you need to do some thinking about
this.” But, they would say, “I would really like to farm the land.” And I remember this is what
she told one person, “Well, whoever farms the land is going to have to farm like Karl.” And so
this farmer's name was Couch. Mr. Couch had told my mother, “I know Karl was a good farmer.
I’m not going to say I can farm like Karl, but I will try.”
ALC: Huh, wow. Wow.
DC: And so then she did keep him for several years, until he retired. And then she got daddy’s
nephew, great nephew. And so she kept him. Now when Mr. Couch was farming, she just sort of
had to be there because she knew what he was doing. But then with the great nephew, his name
was David, when David came she almost had to work alongside David. He was younger and he
wanted to farm, and you know.
ALC: But you sort of had to train him.
DC: Yes. That’s what she had to do, she had to train him.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And then she kept David there until about the year two thousand.
ALC: Wow.
DC: Two thousand. And then she got Tim Chamberlain who was a farmer in the area and lived
nearby, and he did a lot of farming. And she kept him until she had her stroke which was in
twenty-oh-two.
ALC: How old was she at that point?
DC: Eighty-three.
13
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Wow, wow, wow.
DC: Eighty-five. She was eight-five, I’m sorry. She was eighty-five.
ALC: Wow, wow, wow.
DC: And she had her stroke, and then that’s when I come into the picture. So then I just take over
the farm.
ALC: So do you still have that family ground?
DC: Yes, I have the family ground. And, alright then. See, I have a son. He’s in Houston. He
graduated from IU and he’s in business. That’s his major, business and finance. And so he is
working in Houston, and so then when mama… Mama had a trust, so when she passed, then the
trust was divided between my son and myself. And so then, when she passed he got so many
acres, I got so many acres. He had no interest in farming so you know what he did. He sold the
farm.
ALC: Mm, yeah.
DC: But he sold the farm to Tim Chamberlain. He sold his part of the farm to Tim Chamberlain.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: And so then, after that, I kept Tim until… You probably heard about the watermelon
problem?
ALC: No, I didn’t. I’d love to hear this.
DC: Tim Chamberlain sold watermelons. A good watermelon farmer, I thought. And then about
six, seven, or eight years ago, somehow his melons were bad. Especially the cantaloupes. We
don’t know whether it was because of the fertilizer he put on them or what. But anyway, there
was something that they had and people were getting sick. He was selling melons and they were
getting sick.
ALC: Oh, no.
DC: And his melons went all over the country.
14
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh dear.
DC: But then there was a family in Michigan who, no one died from it, but they were deathly
sick. And so then he got into it.
ALC: Oh, the listeria. I remember this, yeah. Right, the listeria outbreak.
DC: That’s what it is.
ALC: Oh my gosh.
DC: And so then for that particular year he had no luck in selling his watermelons. He couldn’t
give them away. And so from this illness, from several other people, he got into a lot of lawsuits.
ALC: Oh dear.
DC: And so that affected his farming.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And so then I had to find me another ringer.
ALC: Yeah, okay.
[20:00] DC: And so there’s where we are now. I have a new ringer now, we’re doing fine.
ALC: Okay, okay. But that, I mean this is, but you also have to know about farming. Did your
mother ever encourage the idea that you could become a farmer? Or did she want you to go to
college?
DC: Both of my parents wanted me to go to college and daddy used to tell me, “I don’t want you
farming here. The farm will probably go to you, but you can get the rent from the farm and that
will be income for you.” But he would tell me, “You need to go to college and get an education.”
ALC: Wow.
DC: And at that time when I graduated from high school in nineteen fifty-three, black girls, there
were only two things they could do if they went to college. Either be a nurse, or be a teacher. So I
chose teaching. And so that’s what I did, I went to Ball State and after I graduated from there in
nineteen fifty-seven, my first job was in Milwaukee. And the rest is history.
15
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Okay.
DC: And I taught in Milwaukee for eight years and then I came back to Indianapolis and taught
twenty-eight years. And so then I retired with thirty-six years.
ALC: And you lived out your parents dream for you.
DC: Mm hmm, yes.
ALC: Wow, that is wonderful.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: My god.
DC: And so, mama, they used to, in fact when mama was sick, she would tell me, “Delores, I
don’t know what’s going to happen to the farm but you do what you think is best.”
ALC: Mmm.
DC: Because my son, that’s the end of the line for us. Because he doesn’t have any children, and
he has no interest in farming. And so there’s where we are.
ALC: Mm hmm. And I know a lot of-
DC: And I hate that but there’s nothing we can do.
ALC: What do you see being lost?
DC: It’s going to be, alright, this is what really bothers me. The legacy that my parents built from
their work ethics is going to be gone. When my son, alright, when something happens to me
everything goes to my son. And then from him, there’s nobody.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: And I hate that, but there’s nothing that we can do.
ALC: Yeah.
16
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Right now there’s nothing.
ALC: Yeah. ‘Cause I see a lot of farmers, right now Glenn Morris was saying that to me. Eddie
Harris and a few others, they were saying they see this dying out and it’s really breaking their
hearts.
DC: Right, mm hmm.
ALC: Because the legacy of African descended people farming in the Wabash River Valley goes
way back. It goes way back. And, did you have a sense, ‘cause your father was a Hardiman and
they go way back… Did you have a sense of roots? Was the history talked about with you much?
DC: Not that much. Not until, I would say, not until what’s his name came out with “roots.”
ALC: Oh, right. That television series, that novel.
DC: Yes. When that came out then that was… we talked about it as a family.
ALC: Oh, interesting.
DC: Even Grandpa Jim talked about it. And see, Grandpa Jim started out with the-
ALC: That’s James Hardiman?
DC: Yeah, James, my grandfather.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: Okay. Now he would say, “Eventually all of my land is going to whites, because there’s not
going to be any blacks that will be able to… If the sons don’t keep it and their children don’t
keep it, then it’s going to whites.” And because there’s no blacks that are able to buy the farm.
ALC: Right, right, right.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: And that was, that was bothering your grandfather at the time.
DC: Yes, yes. But then he said there’s nothing he could do about it.
17
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Mmm.
DC: Nothing he could do about it.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: And see that happened with, daddy had a brother. Alma and then probably told you about
Uncle Clarence and his farm?
ALC: I heard a little. I didn’t hear much about him.
DC: Oh. And then, daddy’s baby brother Uncle Gleetis [sp?] has four children.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: Are they on the farm?
ALC: No.
DC: He has passed.
ALC: Yeah. He had a lot of ground.
DC: Yeah. About five hundred acres.
ALC: Yeah. He was a major millionaire, yeah.
[25:00] DC: Uh huh. Five hundred acres. And what has happened is they have four children, and
he has the ground rented out to the Marvel family, that’s who has mine now. Marvel family. And
then the kids just get the rent from the farm.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: And so then, Uncle Gleedis only has one grandchild. And he’s in Evansville, he shows no
interest in farming right now.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: It’s sad to think about that but that’s the way it’s going.
18
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: I mean, I know Norman Greer has a grandson D’Anthony who’d like to get into farming.
DC: Okay, alright.
ALC: But he’s interested in a different kind of farming. He wants to do the organic and the
vegetable farming and stuff like that.
DC: Okay, alright.
ALC: Not the big corn and bean production.
DC: Right.
ALC: So I just wonder, Travis Nolcox and I were talking about that and he said he doesn’t know,
‘cause these big big conglomerated farms are the way it seems to be going. But then the younger
people, especially those coming out of the cities, they’re interested in the smaller niche farming,
he called it. I hadn’t heard that phrase, but I just… Yeah, I don’t know. But I want to get back to
your childhood on the farm. Now you said your parents had a lot of dairy cows.
DC: Yes, mm hmm.
ALC: So who milked them?
DC: My mother and my father milked them.
ALC: Not the kids?
DC: No. My brother and I never did do that. By the time that we were teenagers they had gotten
rid of the dairy cows. See that, milking the cows was income. That was extra income for the
farm. And so what I did was, I was probably eight, nine, or ten years old. We had, my brother
and I had to get out of the bed at five o’clock in the morning. Maybe four or five o’clock in the
morning, and that’s when they would go out and milk the cows, because the… And we’d put the
milk in milk cans. And in order to cool it in the summertime we put it in a horse trough, and we
had to pump water. Cold water in order to keep it cold. Because the milk truck was coming to
pick the milk up about eight or nine o’clock. And so my job, my only job, when they were
milking the cows, the cows would be in what they called their stances or what have you. And so
I would have a can about that tall-
ALC: So that’s about a foot and a half.
19
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Yes. And there was feed, special feed. And before they started milking the cow I’d have to
put that, give each cow that container of feed.
ALC: Okay. But there were a lot of them… a lot of cows. I mean like, what, you said-
DC: I mean at first we had maybe five or six and probably had, probably ten or twelve at the
most. But daddy would start on this end milking, mama would start on this end milking. And so
then, my brother and I, he would be at one end and I would be at the other end. You know how
the cows, when they would eat some of the grain would go beyond their reach, and so then we
had to take a broom and sweep it up so that my parents could milk.
ALC: The cows would be-
DC: The cows would not move.
ALC: And they would be content. But you would have to help with that.
DC: Yes. Uh huh.
ALC: Oh, wow.
DC: That’s what I did for years. For years until they sold the cows.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: But according to that article, it was the milk from those cows that helped your father-
DC: Yes!
ALC: Pay off his loan.
DC: That was the extra income. Uh huh, extra income. And then we had pigs, too.
ALC: How many?
DC: Alright we had a lot of pigs. Uh, he had, alright. What he would do is he would start out
with the female pigs. Maybe he’d start out with four, five, or six, and then he kept enlarging
his… the pigs.
20
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Okay.
DC: And then at one time he had, we had a chicken house and they had those steel stances or
rods. And each big pig knew where her place was. And then she, after she had her pigs she
would keep her pigs in there.
[30:00] ALC: That was her farrowing, that was the farrowing house.
DC: Yeah. It was the farrowing house. Thank you.
ALC: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DC: And so, I noticed then, by then we had probably eight or ten on this side. Eight or ten on this
side.
ALC: Who were farrowing?
[30:00] DC: Yes. But they would have their pigs at different times and different months.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: And so then another job that I had was the pigs would be in there, the mother pig with the
babies. I’d have to open the little door and take them outside, and there was a fenced-in area
there with grass and whatever. Some kind of grass. And I’d exercise them.
ALC: Really. And was it fenced-in? Or not?
DC: Yeah. The outside was fenced-in.
ALC: How would you exercise them?
DC: Letting them walk.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Letting them walk and I had a stick. I had a stick, and when they’d want to stop I’d hit the
pig and just let them walk around that area.
ALC: Okay.
21
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And then I’d open the door back up and they knew where to go, and the pigs would be with
them.
ALC: Oh my gosh. So they didn’t just stay-
DC: And they had to do that one by one. Because otherwise we’d get the pigs mixed up.
ALC: Oh, my gosh. So every day if you had saddles in the farrowing house, you’d exercise
them.
DC: Yes.
ALC: That’s amazing because today with these big production farmers they just leave those-
DC: I know they do.
ALC: Right. Why do you think your dad wanted them to exercise?
DC: Probably because they were in this small area in the, what I called it the chicken house, in
that building. And I guess he thought they needed exercise, they needed movement.
ALC: Right. Yeah, yeah. Were they pretty healthy?
DC: Yeah, yes.
ALC: ‘Cause I know a lot of farmers today are raising pork to give them antibiotics all the time.
DC: No, we didn’t have anything, we didn’t even know anything about that. We just gave them
special feed, and we knew to feed them in the morning then feed them some time in the
afternoon. And there was water in there, and we had a pump. And we had to pump buckets of
water and carry the water from the pump to the farrowing. To where the pigs were.
ALC: Wow. And that’s in the winter, too.
DC: Yes.
ALC: And it would freeze, it must have frozen. How did you deal with it when it froze?
DC: You know what, I don’t remember that.
22
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Uh huh.
DC: I don’t remember that. And I know that in the wintertime, see daddy was not farming, and
so then he and mama could do that. I don’t remember doing that so much in the wintertime.
ALC: Okay, okay. ‘Cause he had a little bit more time.
DC: Right, more time.
ALC: But they were also doing it together.
DC: Right.
ALC: What was the springtime like?
DC: Springtime was getting ready to plant corn and plant beans.
ALC: Mm hmm. Okay.
DC: And then in the evening we had an area, and there was a garden. We planted every kind of
seed plant in that garden that you could think of.
ALC: Now you say every, but somebody from the city might be listening to this in fifty years
and they don’t even know what it looks like. So can you just make a list?
DC: I remember peas. I remember green beans. I remember green beans, and then we had
something called pole beans. I remember carrots. I remember lettuce. I remember kale. I
remember sweet potatoes. I remember white potatoes. Sweet potatoes, and white potatoes. I
remember corn, of course.
ALC: Sweet corn?
DC: Sweet corn. And then we had a strawberry patch.
ALC: Oh, nice. Oh wow. Not every farmer I’ve talked to had a strawberry patch.
DC: Alright, we had a strawberry patch. It was at the end, and see strawberries had to be grown
in a little heel like.
23
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Mmm. So that was some work.
DC: Mm hmm. And then I remember, see this is what we did in the evening. Daddy would get
the soil ready and then we had a hole or something that would make the path. And then for
dropping peas, I was barefoot and this is what I would do. I would drop two peas here, here. Two
peas. Two peas.
ALC: Oh my gosh, show me that again. So you’re doing this, you’re putting your foot right in
front in a line.
DC: In a path. He made a little path. A little path there.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: I’d put my foot here, and drop two peas.
ALC: And then you’d cover it up with the heel of your other foot?
DC: No, he did.
ALC: He did it?
DC: He came back and covered it up.
[35:00] ALC: Oh. And you’d walk in that line. Wow, that took some balance. And you were
barefoot in the mud. That was a lot of planting.
DC: And I remember this… In that area-
ALC: Oh, I’ve got my camera ‘cause I’d like to get some photos of you doing this if you don’t
mind. ‘Cause this is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Just a second. Okay, hang on. Okay, so show
me again how you were walking.
DC: Put my foot here, and drop two peas.
ALC: Okay, alright.
DC: Put my foot here, drop two peas. Put my foot here, and drop two peas.
ALC: Okay, got it.
24
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Did that also for beans. You would also for the beans.
ALC: Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
DC: And my foot, see they had to be spaced between. Now when we planted lettuce and kale-
ALC: Oh and that’s how you measured out the space between the seeds.
DC: Yes.
ALC: I get it.
DC: Yes.
ALC: Okay and with that, you’d have been five or six years old? How old?
DC: Maybe I was seven or eight. A little older. I wasn’t ten, I know that.
ALC: Okay, okay, okay. And that’s how you measured the space between the peas and the beans.
DC: Yes, yes, yes.
ALC: Oh, my gosh.
DC: But then for the lettuce, we had a little bucket and I had seed. And I knew how to just walk
and how to just sow seed there. And he’d come along and pit. And then for the potatoes, you
know, we would have, I guess potatoes from the year before. Mama would cut potatoes up, and
each potato had to have an eye on it.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: And we’d do the same thing there. But for the potatoes, we had to do two feet.
ALC: Oh, okay.
DC: And then, two feet.
ALC: Okay, so that’s how you measured.
25
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: That’s how we measured.
ALC: And you had to, which way did the eye go when you put the potato?
DC: The eye went up.
ALC: The eye went up.
DC: It went up. And the skin part, the white part of the potato had to be in the ground.
ALC: Okay, okay, okay. So you saved, my gosh, you saved your own seed potatoes then.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Wow, that’s wonderful. That’s just wonderful. Oh my gosh, that’s so much work. That’s so
much work.
DC: And so, I never will forget. I was planting peas or beans, and so the- it was a long, about
from there to probably outside to the end of the garage.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And I was doing this. I was doing this, I’d plant the peas and I was about halfway through,
and then I just stopped and I looked around to see how much farther I had to go. And daddy said,
“What’s wrong with you?” I said, “I just want to see how much farther I have to go, how much
more I have to do.” He said, “That’s the sign of a lazy person.”
ALC: Oh no! Oh no. [laughing] But it was hard work, you’re bending over like that.
DC: That stayed with me when I was young.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: But anyway-
ALC: Aww.
DC: That’s what we had to do. And then we had a blackberry, blackberry vine. And, you know,
the blackberries were on a trellis. And so then we would go out there when they were ripe, we’d
go out there and we had to pick the blackberries.
26
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh, and what would you do with them?
DC: Can them.
ALC: Okay.
DC: We did not freeze that.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: Everything was canned.
ALC: Was it blackberry jam?
DC: She did make jam, yes.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Blackberry pies.
ALC: Oh, wow. I bet that was good.
DC: And then also we planted rhubarb.
ALC: Really?
DC: Rhubarb. We had a rhubarb patch.
ALC: Not anybody I’ve talked to did rhubarb-
DC: And the rhubarb patch was next to the strawberries.
ALC: Okay, okay. So would you-
DC: And I think that had to be in a little heel too, that rhubarb.
ALC: Okay, okay. And that, I’ve got a bit of rhubarb myself, but it takes a long time before you
can harvest it. You have to wait two or three years. Yeah.
27
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Okay. Well I don’t remember that.
ALC: Well did you have, did you have fruit trees?
DC: Yes, yes, yes. Alright. Where the chicken house was out there we had, I remember apple
trees and I remember peach trees.
ALC: Wow. And your mom canned-
DC: She canned apples and peaches.
ALC: Wow. Did she make applesauce first? Or just-
DC: You know what, she didn’t make, we did not have applesauce. I don’t know for what reason
or what-
ALC: Yeah. Now I was talking to somebody on a farm outside of Evansville and he said his dad
was very good at making wine with some of the fruit.
DC: My grandfather made wine.
ALC: He did? Do you know how he learned to do that?
DC: No.
ALC: Wow, ‘cause that takes some skill. I mean, that takes some real knowledge of chemistry
and stuff to make it work.
DC: Okay.
ALC: You know?
DC: Grandpa Jim.
ALC: Grandpa Jim. That’s Jim Hardiman.
DC: Yes.
ALC: And what would he make wine out of? ...You don’t know.
28
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
[40:00] DC: I have no idea, he just made wine. What do you make wine from?
ALC: Yeah. Fruit. Grapes.
DC: Yeah, see I didn’t know that. This is what I remember, alright. Grandpa Jim, see we always
had a family reunion.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Every August.
ALC: Okay. What time in August? Early August?
DC: Around his birthday. His birthday was the twenty-third.
ALC: Oh okay, interesting.
DC: And so, this is what I remember about the wine. He and some of the other people in the
neighborhood would make wine. They had a basement in their house, alright. Grandpa Jim had
this wine in the basement.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: And so anyway, no one could go down there, he thought, except the adults. And so when we
had homecoming, family reunion, the men would go down there and then the teenagers would be
outside. And so one year when we were getting ready to eat, you know the adults ate first-
ALC: Mmm, I didn’t know that.
DC: Oh, yes.
ALC: At the family reunions, or all the time?
DC: At the family reunions, at the family reunions.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Otherwise we’d all eat together. But at the family reunions you had the preacher there-
ALC: Okay.
29
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And then the older family members. And so anyway, now I remember this as teenagers.
Probably fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years old. Now I remember they were eating, and we were
supposed to be outside. Some of the teenagers went inside and got into Grandpa Jim’s wine.
ALC: Uh oh.
DC: He didn’t find out until after everyone left.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: After that he never had any more wine at the family reunions.
ALC: It was done.
DC: Because the kids went in and got into his wine.
ALC: And he figured it out.
DC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
ALC: Oh my gosh.
DC: And so that was the end of that. Now when we had a family reunion everything, just about
everything came from the garden. And all of his daughters and daughter in laws would go to the
house two or three days before and start cooking.
ALC: Wow. And what would usually be served at the main meal?
DC: A lot of fried chicken. A lot of mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn on the cob, and then
fried corn. And then-
ALC: What’s fried corn?
DC: Uh, okay. You take… Fried corn is just what it says. You take the, cut it off of the cob-
ALC: Okay.
DC: And you fry it. Put butter on it, and put some bacon grease in it, and put all kinds of
seasoned peppers and what have you.
30
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: That sounds so good, I’ve never heard of that.
DC: Ooh fried corn. Ooh fried corn. Ooh fried corn is good!
ALC: It sounds wonderful!
DC: In fact, last year, what was it… A couple years ago someone gave me, I bet they gave me
two or three ears of corn. And so then, this family wanted fried corn. And so I said, “Okay. I’ll
do the fried corn. I’ll keep half and you keep half.” That was two or three years ago.
ALC: Mmm. So it’s corn, I’m just really curious ‘cause this is the first time I’ve heard somebody
tell of it.
DC: Alright. Grandma Lou would have this big black skillet, and at that time we would put
bacon grease in it.
ALC: Alright.
DC: But now you put bacon grease, or butter. And take your kernels of corn, salt, and pepper,
and put sugar in it. You can put red peppers, green peppers, onions, and fry it until it’s kind of
brown.
ALC: Wow, that sounds like Heaven.
DC: It’s good. Fried corn is good.
ALC: Wow, and all that’s from the garden. Everything except the sugar and salt would’ve been
from your own garden.
DC: Right. And then for the bread they made yeast rolls.
ALC: Yeast rolls, wow.
DC: And then all the cakes were made homemade from scratch.
ALC: So then what were the cakes and desserts you remember?
DC: Angel food. Angel food and I remember Grandma Lou used to make banana pudding.
31
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh, wow.
DC: Angel food, and then I remember Aunt Gladys liked chocolate cakes. And then I remember
somebody made a caramel cake.
ALC: Oh wow, that sounds so good.
DC: Caramel cakes.
ALC: Did you ever make homemade ice cream?
DC: Yes.
ALC: Oh, okay. With the hand crank.
[45:00] DC: Yeah. I didn’t know what store-bought ice cream was. Because we had the milk
there and we made, mama made ice cream. Because, let me see, I would stand on the freezer, you
could turn it. We’d put that in, whatever you’d call it, in the case. My brother would put the ice
and then we had to put salt in it. Alright then. My brother would turn it, and when it would start
getting hard I had to stand on it.
ALC: That’s what my daughter will stand on it when I’m cranking because it gets stuck.
DC: When you’re cranking it, right.
ALC: Right, right.
DC: And then the reason mama made angel food cakes is because we had chickens.
ALC: Oh, right.
DC: We also had a brooder house, and she would get baby chickens. Go to town and buy baby
chickens, keep them in there and feed them and what have you, and when they got a certain size
she would sell some and then we had chicken every day.
ALC: Wow! That’s really amazing.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: So you had a lot of chickens. And also for the eggs.
32
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Yes. And from the hens we had lots of eggs. That’s the reason why we made angel food
cakes.
ALC: Okay.
DC: I will not eat an angel food cake to this day because of that.
ALC: Because you don’t like it.
DC: I don’t like it.
ALC: You had it too much.
DC: I had too much.
ALC: What would you do with the yolks? Because with angel food cake you just do the whites.
Did you make custard, or?
DC: I don’t remember her making custard. When she put it in a lemon pie, she put the yolks in.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: Let’s see, she made lemon pies…
ALC: Mmm I bet that was good.
DC: Good question, I don’t know what she did with that.
ALC: So, sorry we got off on the family reunion.
DC: That’s alright.
ALC: So, so for the feast for the family reunion you’d have all the, you’d have fried chicken,
you’d have the mashed potatoes, you’d have the fried corn, all that. And for dessert you’d have
all those? And would you have homemade ice cream at that family reunion as well?
DC: Yes, yes, yes.
33
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: What flavor was the ice cream?
DC: Alright. Many times it was just vanilla. But then my mother would, I remember her making
peach ice cream, and I remember her making strawberry ice cream.
ALC: Ooh. Wow.
DC: And when we were freezing the ice cream, when it got to a certain consistency then she
would take it out, open it up, and then she would put her strawberries in or her peaches in.
ALC: Oh, it didn’t start from the beginning.
DC: Mm mm.
ALC: Oh, okay. Wow, wow. Oh that sounds like it must’ve been delicious, though.
DC: Yeah. And I remember my mother made the best chocolate pie. I have never had a chocolate
pie that good since I left home.
ALC: Would it have meringue on the top?
DC: Yes, yes. And just like the lemon pie, the meringue, and just it would be like a mound on
top.
ALC: Mm, mmm. And then that must’ve been homemade, that wasn’t from a box.
DC: No, it was homemade. Everything was homemade. We didn’t know what boxed cakes and
things were.
ALC: So that was your favorite that she would make, was the chocolate cream pie?
DC: Mm hmm, mm hmm. And then she made a rhubarb pie.
ALC: Oh, wow.
DC: I wasn’t too particular for rhubarb. But she would make, when the rhubarb was ripe and
what have you, she would make a rhubarb pie.
ALC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
34
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And then in the wintertime, daddy had pigs. And this was when we lived in the original
house and we had a smokehouse. He and his brothers would, daddy had this pig, or maybe he
had one pig and Uncle Gletus had another pig or what have you. Anyway,  it was butchering
time. And I believe this was in the fall or the wintertime. And I remember they would come to
our house in the backyard there, and there’s where daddy would shoot the pig. He got his pistol
out and he shot the pig, killed the pig, and then mama had big pots of boiling water.
ALC: Okay. Outside?
DC: Uh huh, uh huh. And I guess, I don’t know how they’d, I don’t remember them putting the
pig in there but they had to take the skin off of the pig.
ALC: Mm, mmm. Yeah. Scold it.
DC: Scold it. I don’t remember that part, but I remember that for the hams and what have you
they brought those into the smokehouse, and they would put a lot of salt and stuff on it and then
put it in a bag and hang them up around the smokehouse.
ALC: Oh, and they’d actually smoke it?
DC: Yes.
ALC: Because some farmers I talked to they said their families just packed it in salt. And other
families actually smoked it.
DC: No. They just packed it in salt, ‘cause we didn’t know anything about smoking.
ALC: Oh, okay.
DC: It was in a smokehouse. Oh, the house we called that the smokehouse but there was no-
ALC: It didn’t actually smoke.
DC: It didn’t actually smoke, right.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: And I remember the hams, or what have you, were hanging up there.
[50:00] ALC: Okay.
35
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: We would have that to eat during the-
ALC: Winter months.
DC: During the winter months. And then I remember my mother made soap.
ALC: Wow, from scratch? How would she do that?
DC: She made soap, and the only thing I know is that it would be in big bars. She had a big
wooden… something there. She would put, somehow she, I don’t know what she did. But
anyway, it ended up being soap.
ALC: Wow.
DC: And then she would cut it up. And that’s what we took a bath in.
ALC: Wow! And that was, was that for laundry too? Or just for the bodies?
DC: Mm hmm, no.
ALC: Okay, that was for everything.
DC: Mm hmm. That’s how come I have allergies to this day.
ALC: You think so? Because of that soap? It must have been pretty harsh.
DC: We used it on our bodies.
ALC: And, bath time… I was just talking to another family, because they didn’t have running
water in their house, so bath time was once a week.
DC: Right, Saturday night.
ALC: Saturday night, before church.
DC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
ALC: And who would get to go first?
36
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: I don’t remember that, but I remember that in the first house, when daddy and mama bought
the farm there was a farmhouse. No running water, nothing. No… nothing, nothing. We had
outside, and… Anyway, Saturday night was bath night. And so then we had a stove, and she, the
stove in the kitchen there, there was a big area there where she would put either coal or wood.
And that would not only, she’d use that for cooking, but also to heat the house. And so for bath
time she would put a big bucket of water on the stove, and that’s what we took a bath in.
ALC: Wow, wow.
DC: And I remember then I went into the living room and we had a potbelly stove in the living
room. I took a bath there, and one time I was standing up and mama was washing me down or
what have you, putting soap on my body. I fell and hit the stove.
ALC: *Gasps* Oh my, oh no. With your hands? Oh, that must have burned them so bad.
DC: I remember, I know I burned them but I don’t think it was that bad. But anyway, she put
cold running water on it, and then I remember putting Vaseline but I didn’t go to the doctor. It
wasn’t that bad.
ALC: Yeah, well it must have blistered up.
DC: Yeah, it did. Yeah it blistered. And I remember that.
ALC: I bet you do, I bet you do.
DC: But I don’t remember the pain right now. I don’t remember the pain but I remember doing
that. And then after that they had a metal tub, a galvanized tub. That was where I took my bath,
and the next time after that they pushed it sort of away from the stove.
ALC: ‘Cause of course you wanted to stay close to the stove so you can stay warm, but she
didn’t want you getting burned again.
DC: Yeah, right.
ALC: I bet she felt terrible after that. ‘Cause as-
DC: But I mean, I don’t even remember crying. I don’t, I don’t remember crying- I don’t
remember that but I remember that I did burn my hands.
37
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Right, right. Oh my, oh my. So this is a funny question but I’ve been really curious ‘cause
a lot of the farmers I’ve talked to they had one or two cows or more. And they would drink the
milk, and eat the cream- drink the cream. Sometimes they’d make butter, did your family make
butter?
DC: Sure did, yes.
ALC: Uh huh, how would you do that? Was it in a jar?
DC: No. They had a big crock, mama had a crock.
ALC: Oh, okay.
DC: It was about this tall, and it had a wooden paddle in it. And all we had to do is you’d put the
cream in there, and-
ALC: And it wasn’t a crank, it was an actual stick?
DC: No, no. It wasn’t a crank. We stood there and did this.
ALC: Wow, wow.
DC: And then, alright then… In order to get the cream, she had to save the milk for a couple of
days.
ALC: Okay, yeah.
DC: Because, so the cream would all go to the top.
ALC: Rise, it would rise.
DC: I remember.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And we did that, and then she put it- had the little wooden boxes there. And there’s where
she would put the… after she, after it turned to butter, she would put salt in it. And then she’d put
it in this little box.
38
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Would she kind of press it out?
DC: Yeah, press it.
[55:00] ALC: Yeah, yeah. Did… I had buttermilk pie the other day at the Lyles Station barbeque,
church barbeque. And I’d never had that before, did you have that?
DC: I’ve never had that before, but I’ve heard that it’s supposed to be good.
ALC: It is good, it was good. Now I’m curious. But, so, and here’s a question. When you had the
milk just for the family, was that cooked or pasteurized first? Or just raw?
DC: At first we’d drink raw milk, and then they came out and said that it needed to be
pasteurized. And so my parents bought a pasteurizer, and so that’s what we used after that.
ALC: And how old were you when you started doing that?
DC: I was probably a teenager.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Probably a teenager. Thirteen. Twelve, thirteen.
ALC: Mm hmm. ‘Cause one of the things, there’s so many things and I know people are going to
hear this in fifty years, a hundred years’ time, or whatever. They’re going to have so many
questions so I keep trying to think, I’m trying to make sure I’m asking the right questions. But
one of the things I’ve noticed is that a lot of your parents' generation, your grandparents'
generation, lived a long time. They lived a very long time. And I interviewed Harry Anderson,
he’s ninety-one, right?
DC: Okay.
ALC: And I’m just wondering if you… if you think, why do you think that is?
DC: I don’t know. You know what, I have asked, I’ve talked to others about this. My grandfather
lived until he was ninety-eight, ninety-nine or something. And he was, all the food that grandma
cooked was fried, it was in lard, and all those things that are supposed to be bad for us today.
ALC: Wow.
39
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Yeah. Fried chicken in lard.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: Mm hmm. And, but then they worked, they exercised, and I don’t know. And now they say,
“You have good genes,” or “He has good genes.” You know, like that. Now my father’s baby
sister just passed last year, she was one-oh-one.
ALC: One hundred and one?
DC: Yeah. And her sister passed two years before and she was ninety-nine and would have been
one hundred the next day.
ALC: Wow. And that’s some serious age. Because, of course, we think of farming as being really
hard and people nowadays not living as long but that’s not what I’m hearing, that’s not what I’m
hearing from these farmers.
DC: Yeah, yeah.
ALC: So yeah, wow.
DC: And I remember the time when we had an ice box, and the ice man came by every day or
every other day. We bought a block of ice and had to put it in the ice box. And then I had to, you
know, the ice would melt. And so under the ice box there was a drain, there was a pan, and so I
had to keep that empty.
ALC: That was one of your chores?
DC: That was one of my chores, yeah.
ALC: Was to dump the ice box water. Wow.
DC: And then another chore was we had lad- is it Aladdin lamps?
ALC: Oh, like the oil lamps?
DC: Oil lamps. And so I guess I had to put the oil in the lamp and then, I had to keep that full.
40
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh, wow. And did you have to keep the wicks trimmed?
DC: No, I didn’t do the wicks. But-
ALC: What was, what was burnt in those? What kind of oil was burned?
DC: I don’t remember, but it was a clear oil I know that. Something clear.
ALC: Wow. And you had that until you moved to the newer home?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And then we built the new home in nineteen forty-eight.
ALC: Okay, okay. And according to that article your dad and your mom had ideas about how
they wanted that to be. They wanted to have electricity-
DC: Yes.
ALC: And inside plumbing, right?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: So they must’ve done some research into that, to know how to do that.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Yeah, wow. That must’ve been a big change for you.
DC: It was a big change!
ALC: Yeah, oil lamps and bathing by the wood stove and everything else-
DC: Sure, mm hmm, mm hmm.
ALC: How’d you feel about it?
41
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Well, I guess then, alright. As long as, just like we never had air conditioning and at night
you’d put the window up and put a screen. Yeah, there’d be screens in the window and that’s
how you kept cool at night, you didn’t complain.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: You went to sleep. My brother and I slept- in the old house, the original house, our
bedrooms were upstairs.
ALC: Oh that would get hot. Oh, that must’ve gotten hot.
DC: We’d open the windows on this end and on this end, and we’d keep the screen there.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: And then I remember when we had what they called blackouts-
ALC: Okay-
DC: You know anything about blackouts?
ALC: No.
[1:00:00] DC: Something about the army was in war time or something, and we had to…
Somehow the word got out that your whole house was supposed to be black. Lights were not
supposed to be shined through the… You couldn’t open your curtains and things.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And I remember daddy would come in and say you know, “Today we have to close all the
curtains.” We had to close all the curtains or pull all the blinds down, that was it… Pull the blinds
down. And sometimes we took, that did not, you could still see the lights from the outside. And
so then mama would take a blanket and cover the window.
ALC: Wow, wow. But what would you do in the summer? That would make it so hot.
DC: This was just at nighttime.
ALC: At nighttime.
42
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: Just at nighttime.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Then I guess we went to bed and got up the next day.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: And just took the blinds down.
ALC: Yeah, yeah. That is really... I’ve never heard of people doing blackouts.
DC: Blackouts.
ALC: So your, according to this article, your dad was farming land close to the Wabash River. Is
that correct?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: That wasn’t his first choice, his first choice was land near Lyles Station.
DC: No, near Princeton.
ALC: Near Princeton.
DC: Near Princeton.
ALC: But he couldn’t purchase that, no. And he later said it was, you said it was because-
DC: He was black.
ALC: He was black.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Okay. Even though he had the money.
DC: Yes. Well, he was getting the loan but they would not give him the loan for the farm near
Princeton. But they would give him the loan for the Wabash Valley. It was a farm that nobody
43
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
else wanted.
ALC: Oh my, wow. ‘Cause I bet it flooded.
DC: It did. It flooded.
ALC: How did your father deal with farming in a flood zone?
DC: You know what, I remember as I got older that did not bother my father. Because he could
make lemons, like it said in that article, and come up with lemonade. He built the land up, I
guess he knew or was learning how to build the land up and everything. And then the farm, the
hundred acres that we have now, it belongs to me. That is the best hundred acres in Gibson
County.
ALC: Wow. ‘Cause of the way your dad built it up.
DC: Everybody wants it now.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: When my mother passed, farmers came to me and they said, “Delores, what are you going
to do with the farm?” And I said, “I’m not selling it.” They wanted it. They wanted it.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: And I had two farmers to tell me, since sometimes I would go down there when the renters
were working the ground. And they would stop by, and they remembered me as a teenager, and
they would say… One farmer said, “You know you got the best farm.” This is the best land in
Gibson County.
ALC: Wow. Wow.
DC: He told me that. Because it’s all black.
ALC: Wow, wow. And it’s all really good soil.
DC: It’s good soil. And he built it up, he knew what to do. And I don’t remember… It was
supposed to flood a lot, but I don’t ever remember the farm flooding when I was there at home. I
don’t remember. I remember sometimes the ditch would break. There was a ditch on the West
44
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
side, and on the North side. And sometimes the ditch would break and of course it would flood
then, but it would drain off.
ALC: Hmm. Now out there in Montgomery Township by Wabash you were a fair ways away
from some of the other African American farmers.
DC: We were the only black farmers around. We were raised, I was raised up around white
people.
ALC: What was that like? ‘Cause I did talk to another, I think was it Dennis-
DC: Dennis Hardiman? Yeah, he lives farther in the bottoms.
ALC: Yeah. And he was saying that one of the first real arguments he got into with his
grandfather was about whether to build a barn. ‘Cause his grandfather said, “We don’t build
barns. If we build barns white people will burn them down.” Did you ever hear anything like
that?
[1:05:00] DC: When we moved there and then the Brazzletons were there, the Robinsons were
there, and the Bairds were over here. Visualize this. And the Robinsons had children, oh and then
the Brazzletons had children. And so we, somehow we played together, and at that time when we
first moved there we were going to Lyles School which was all black.
ALC: Oh wow, okay.
DC: But then when we came home and our neighbors, the Robinson kids, Charlie Robinson, the
Brazzleton kids, we’d play together. I mean, at the time, you know in the evenings when the
parents would come and talk to daddy or something, then the kids came and that’s how we
played together. We met the kids.
ALC: So you weren’t allowed to go to the same school-
DC: Mm mm.
ALC: But you played together in the evenings sometimes.
DC: Yes! I had no trouble. My brother and I had no trouble. We were never, I’ve never been
called the “N name” or anything around those kids. And-
45
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Was it different if you went somewhere else? Like if you went to Princeton or anything
like that?
DC: Well, when we went to Princeton I knew we had a root beer stand there, and I knew that we
could go there for root beer. We wanted root beer in mugs, but if you were black you got paper
cups.
ALC: Yeah.
DC: And, you know, we were discriminated that way. But as far as… Alright. The people that we
associated with when we lived there on the farm, and I never saw black people until I went to
Lyles Station. Until I went to church or went to something that was at the school there.
ALC: Right, right, right.
DC: But I know that my father, alright Owensville is two or three miles down the road. And so
daddy was, he had to go to Owensville for something, to pick up something or something. And
so he told me this. He got out of the truck, and he was just walking around into the hardware
store or something, and a little white boy says, “Oh mommy, that man works in the coal mines.”
ALC: Oh… Oh, because of the color of his skin.
DC: Because the color of his skin. I guess they’d never seen a black person. Knew nothing about
a black person
ALC: Oh my.
DC: But if he was brown, black, or what have you, he worked in a coal mine.
ALC: Wow. That must be- that’s so interesting, I mean that’s really interesting for me to hear that
story and I’m glad you shared it. Because what I know is that one of the first settlers of
Montgomery Township was an African American family… back before statehood. So these
must’ve been white families that arrived after, like later, that weren’t aware of that history and
those families. Because those were really early and hardworking families that bought land
directly from the federal government when land was being endowed. You know, we’re taking
eighteen thirteen, eighteen fourteen. Really early. And it’s interesting how those, how those
histories got lost.
DC: Right. And you know at Christmas time and New Year’s time, I was older, probably a
teenager… the Brazzleton’s, that was supposed to be a prominent white family, college degree
46
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
and what have you, nice as they could be. And they would have, they would invite families in,
their neighbors in for a Christmas party or just Christmas dinner, Christmas snacks. And my
parents always went, and we went.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And there was no problem. And the people there, after we moved there and after daddy
started farming, then because he would go to Owensville to buy corn seed or what have you, he
gave them business buying fertilizer or whatever. And they got to know him. They respected my
father, and then when they found out and saw the type of crops that he raised, they respected him
more. And they were wondering, ‘cause I know several times people would ask him, “Karl how
do you do this? Why does your corn look so much better than mine? Why do your beans look so
much better?”
ALC: Mmm, wow. So he was really good.
DC: Mm hmm. Daddy was good at farming.
ALC: Mm hmm, mm hmm. And your mom was good too ‘cause she was farming right alongside
him.
DC: Yeah, she was. See she did everything daddy did. She knew everything, whatever he did,
she knew what he did.
[1:10:00] ALC: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you think he was doing that was… I was
talking to one family and they said they went by the almanac. One family said that.
DC: Okay.
ALC: But, why do you think he was better?
DC: Daddy used to tell me in farming you have to use common sense. That’s what he told me, he
said, “You have to use common sense.” He said some of these farmers would go out here and
they’ll buy the best seed corn, the best fertilizer and all that, I never will forget that. He said,
“Fertilizer can only be so good. Seed corn can only be so good.”
ALC: Mmm.
DC: And so I think that with the combination of chemicals that he put into the ground, he found
out what would work and… that’s what made him successful.
47
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Yeah, yeah. He had to be really smart to do that.
DC: And just to think that he went to Indiana State to be a teacher.
ALC: Really?
DC: And see, at that time you could only go to Indiana State to be a teacher in two years. He
stayed one year.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: And so he came back, now I think he taught at Lincoln High School one year. And he told
me, now I don’t know if this is the truth or not, but this is what he said.
ALC: Alright.
DC: He said that he taught and he made only fifty dollars for the whole year. I don’t know if
that’s the truth of it, but that’s what he said. And he told me because, I asked and I said, one time
I asked, “Why’d you go into farming when you went to college?” And so he said, “You know,”
he said, “I never thought,” he said, “I always thought that if I taught, I would never be rich.”
ALC: Mmm, mmm.
DC: Those were his exact words. “I would never be rich.”
ALC: And so he wanted, he wanted better.
DC: He wanted better, yeah.
ALC: Yeah. And farming was the way to do it. And as you said, he wanted you to go to college.
DC: Mm hmm. He would tell my brother and I, my brother started at Purdue. And he was there
for one year, and then he came home and started working with daddy.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And then, when International Harvester was seeking workers then he went to International
Harvester.
48
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Okay.
DC: My brother worked there until he went into the army.
ALC: Okay, okay.
DC: And, but daddy always said, “I don’t want you to stay on this farm. I don’t want you to stay
on this farm.”
ALC: Wow.
DC: He would say that.
ALC: Wow.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: So he saw it as a way for his family to get ahead, but he didn’t necessarily want them to
become farmers.
DC: Right.
ALC: Interesting. What do you feel like are some of the best things you’ve learned from being
raised on a farm?
DC: Work ethics. I have some good work ethic, I know. I can, I don’t know. I… Anything, and
daddy used to tell us, “Whatever you do, do it the best… Give it your best. Give it your all.” And
he said, “That’s the only way you’re going to be successful.”
ALC: Mmm. Now, maybe it doesn’t seem that unusual because it was in your family, but I’ve
been hearing a fair number of families in Lyles Station talk about your mom and her farming.
DC: Uh huh.
ALC: Did it strike you as unusual? When you would see her go out on the tractor and stuff like
that?
DC: No, ‘cause I saw other women.
49
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Oh, you did?
DC: Uh huh, there were white women who did that-
ALC: Too.
DC: Uh huh. One was Jacobis. Mrs. Jacobis. Yeah, Jacobis. There were other women who did
that.
ALC: Okay, so your mom’s not the only one.
DC: Uh huh. She was probably the only black woman doing it, but the other white women were
doing it.
ALC: Why do you think there might’ve been that difference? That some of the black women
wouldn’t do it? Do you think there were sort of ideas about what people should do? I’m just
curious.
[1:15:00] DC: You know what, I hadn’t thought about that. ‘Cause just like, alright now… Aunt
Ruth would not do that, but Aunt Ernestine worked along with her husband who was Uncle
Gletus. She did it. And Aunt Helen, that was Uncle Al, she did not do it. So it could’ve been that
maybe their husband thought the women, the wife’s place was in the home, I guess. Alright then,
now they did have gardens. And they canned and what have you, and cooked and took care of
the children, okay. But I guess that was it. But my mother has no, she would rather go out there
and drive a tractor than stay in the house.
ALC: That was really her love?
DC: Uh huh!
ALC: Was to be out there, working out there.
DC: Uh huh, mm hmm. And she, just like after she started renting the ground out, this is what
she told Tim. She says, “The corn looks good, but I want my corn to look better than anyone
else’s corn in Gibson County.” Tim told me that.
ALC: Oh, that’s amazing.
DC: She didn’t want to see any weeds in it, and what are… horse weeds. Sometimes you’d have,
oh there’s some Johnson grass. And I know that she, daddy would, there was one area on the
50
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
farm… On the Woodson farm, an area that had Johnson grass. And it got so tall, and he and
mama would go out there in the evening and dig it up.
ALC: Wow.
DC: Dig it up, pull it up.
ALC: That’s so hard. So did they always use tractors or did they start off with a team?
DC: They… When daddy bought the one hundred acres he bought a Farmall tractor. Now before
then, we had horses but I don’t remember horses plowing the land or anything. Grandma Lou
would tell you that’s what they did when she was helping Grandpa Jim.
ALC: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DC: But daddy had bought a Farmall, a red Farmall tractor.
ALC: As soon as he got that hundred-
DC: As soon as he got the farm.
ALC: Right. But before that he was using horses-
DC: He may have when he was renting, because before he bought the farm he was what you
would call a tenant farmer.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: And so then he may have done it then, but you see I don’t remember that.
ALC: Okay. You were pretty young. And your mom, did she keep farming the land after your
dad died? Herself, on the tractor? Or did she rent it out?
DC: She rented it out. But if mama saw something that needed to be done she would do it.
ALC: She’d get back on the tractor.
DC: She’d get back on the tractor and do it. I think that’s what Stanley was talking about. Now
see, he had other ground, and mama after daddy passed, mama didn’t keep some of the tractors.
51
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
Some of the machinery. And so just like, if she saw a field that needed to be disc, and Couch
hadn’t gotten to it, she’d go out there and do it. Yeah, that’s what he’s talking about.
ALC: Wow, okay. Even in her sixties.
DC: Mm hmm. Alright, yes. Fifties and sixties, yes.
ALC: Alright. So I know this sounds like a weird question to ask, but I ask everyone this. ‘Cause
I grew up in the country but I don’t know a whole lot about this, is there a question or questions
that I haven’t asked that I should be asking?
DC: Alright. Alright, this is… Alright. I want to let you be aware of this. When daddy bought
this farm, alright then… They thought that he was, that they were giving him a river bottom farm
that he would never be successful in anything. He once told me that. Alright then. And then he
found oil on the farm, and then it has been leased twice for coal. And so then on the fifty, on the
hundred acres they gave him, he leased it with Superior Oil Company for fifty thousand dollars.
And so they came up and drilled one, two, three oil wells. And one oil well was making a
thousand barrels a day.
ALC: Holy cow!
DC: That was the one that was closest to the house.
ALC: Wow, wow, wow.
[1:20:00] DC: And so, on this river bottom farm. And then mama leased the farm for coal. And
they never drilled. And then after she passed, I leased the farm for coal and they drilled. They
found coal, they mined the coal. And then see daddy had the hundred acres, and he always
wanted… He knew he wanted, if he could, he wanted to buy other ground. And so the Woodson
farm across the road, Mrs. Woodson was a teacher in Evansville. She and her husband... there
was a house on the farm. I don’t know how she got that farm, it was eighty acres. And so she had
somebody else farm it for her. But, Mrs. Woodson saw that daddy’s crops looked better than her
crops. And so anyway, but before she asked daddy if he would farm her ground, daddy went to
her and asked her, “Mrs. Woodson, if you ever need a renter,” he said, “I’d be glad someday to
rent your farm.” Mrs. Woodson looked at him and said, “Karl, I would never rent my farm to a
nigger.”
ALC: Huh, oh my gosh.
DC: And daddy said, “Well, if you feel that way, that’s alright.” I was there, I was standing there
52
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
with him. And we never, that didn’t bother him. And so anyway, he went right on and kept
farming his ground. And so then one day she caved in and said, “You know, my renter is not
making me any money. Do you think you could make me more money?” And daddy said, “I
don’t know, but I’ll try.”
ALC: So he was willing to forgive and forget.
DC: He never thought nothing about it.
ALC: Wow.
DC: Never though nothing about it. And the thing about it… Alright then, and so anyway he did
get his chance then to rent her farm, the eighty acres. And then when she got sick, she was up
there in age, he asked her and he said, “Mrs. Woodson,” he said, “If the time ever comes, I would
like to buy your farm.” And so she said, “If I ever decide to sell, you’ll get first chance at it.” She
had no children. She had just nieces and nephews. And so, they would come down, they’d spend
their summers there on the farm. And so anyway, daddy farmed it until she got sick, and then
when she got sick she went to the hospital in Princeton and who did she ask to take care of her?
ALC: Who?
DC: My mother.
ALC: Really? And your mother said yes?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Holy cow! Now. Did Mrs. Woodson your dad fair terms for the rent?
DC: Evidently. Because he was three-fifths and two-fifths, that’s five-fifths. Alright, he got
three-fifths and she got two-fifths. And so seemed to be pleased.
ALC: Did he end up getting the land though?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: He did?
DC: He bought the land. Alright then, after she passed she had two nephews and they lived in
Marion, Indiana. And daddy knew that. And so then daddy somehow contacted them and told the
53
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
two nephews that he would like to be the farm if it was for sale. They didn’t want the farm and
sold it just like that.
ALC: Wow. ‘Cause that would’ve been, the fifties at some point?
DC: It was nineteen sixty-five.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Sixty-four or sixty-five.
ALC: Wow. And he saved up for it or did he get a loan?
DC: He saved up for it. He bought it for… eighty acres for twenty-seven thousand dollars.
ALC: Wow.
DC: And um, alright. My father, the only time he got a loan was when he bought the farm… the
first, the hundred-acres for either eight thousand or eighty-five hundred dollars. I don’t think,
alright… After that, I don’t think he had to get a loan for nothing. He never had a charge card
except for a gas card. And they only used that when they went on vacation.
ALC: Okay, okay. Yeah.
[1:25:00] DC: And… then, there was something I was going to say and it just left me right like
that. Then after he bought the farm, alright then. And then Haven Armstrong, Paul Brasten... they
didn't find out that he had bought the farm until six... three, or four, five, six months later.
ALC: Wow.
DC: And they came down. Then, you know, they were at the house and they were just talking.
They said, “Karl, I understand you bought the Woodson farm, how’d you get that?” Daddy said,
“I bought it from the nephews.”
ALC: Wow, wow. How did they respond?
DC: They couldn’t believe it. They couldn’t believe it. And so then, that was the Woodson farm.
And then the Thompson farm was up on the hill, and it’s sand. And then Mr. Thompson died, and
guess who bought that? Daddy did.
54
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Your dad. Wow, wow.
DC: And see, he had beef cattle. He was going, he had some beef cattle. And then he wanted to
enlarge his herd, and so by that being up on the sand that was a good place for him to grow
alfalfa. And so he bought that for his beef cattle. And so when he died he had about a hundred
fifty head of beef cattle.
ALC: How many acres did he have by the time he died?
DC: Two hundred thirty-four.
ALC: Oh my gosh, Delores. And he started with nothing.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: That’s incredible. Well, and it’s obviously your parents working together and working hard
on it.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Wow.
DC: And then in the meantime, alright, he had the pigs. Alright then, and he had the baby pigs.
Alright then, that was extra income ‘cause he would sell that.
ALC: Right, right, right.
DC: And then across the bridge there, there was this bridge, all of our farm is on this side of the
bridge. But on the other side of the bridge there was some farming land there that someone was
renting, and their renter had given it up. They asked daddy if he wanted to rent it, and so daddy
rented that. It was close to it, just on the other side of the bridge.
ALC: So he was farming a lot more than the two hundred thirty acres.
DC: Yeah, yeah.
ALC: He was farming… Wow.
DC: Uh huh, ‘cause that was extra income.
55
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: That was extra work.
DC: Uh huh. I know it, but it was extra income.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And then finally he started out with one tractor, then he got two tractors. And he would be
on one, and mama would be on the other.
ALC: Wow, wow. And they’d be farming side by side.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Did you ever think after your college degree that you would want to come back, or would
he not let you?
DC: He, I probably could have done that but I did not want to, I just did not want to come back
on the farm.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
DC: And a classmate of mine, her name is Shirley. She was an only child and her family had
farms. And so Shirley stayed right there, I think about her. She stayed right there on her parents
farm and she still... she isn’t farming now it’s rented out now, but she’s still right there on the
farm. But I just did not want to do that.
ALC: What was it like… You said you went to Ball State.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: Did, how did you decide on Ball State?
DC: Well, I went to Indy… Alright. When I graduated from high school, alright. Most of the
black, alright in daddy’s family his sisters went to Ball State. My mother’s sister went to… I
mean, sorry not Ball State. Daddy’s sisters went to Indiana State, and mama’s sisters went to
Indiana State, and that’s all that I knew.
ALC: Right.
DC: And so then after I stayed in Indiana State one year, I just did not like Indiana State.
56
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Why not?
DC: And so I went to Ball State’s homecoming one year, I liked it so much better. The kids that I
met were from all over, and the black kids that I met were from all over and they just seemed to
be so nice. I transferred to Ball State and the rest is history. And when I did that my parents
didn’t say one word. They didn’t say “You aren’t going.” They didn’t say it, I did it on my own.
ALC: And they paid for you to go?
DC: Uh huh.
ALC: With the money from their farm.
DC: Uh huh.
ALC: Where did you stay when you were at Ball State.
DC: Alright. When I went to Ball State, the only way a black girl could stay in a dorm is you had
to have a black roommate.
ALC: Wow.
[1:30:00] DC: So when I went, there was no black roommate. And so then they had a list of
families, out in the city… in the town, that was keeping college black girls.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And so I found the nicest family, the Rift family. And she was formerly from Marion
Indiana, and her brother taught here in Indianapolis.
ALC: Wow, wow.
DC: And I stayed there three years and they accepted me just like their daughter.
ALC: Wow. Were they white or black?
DC: Black, mm hmm.
ALC: Black, yeah.
57
Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And then the black kids, they stayed out in the city. The boys and the girls stayed out in the
city with families.
ALC: Mm hmm.
DC: And so I could have gone into the dormitory, but the Rifts were so nice to me I just couldn’t.
I could not.
ALC: Right, right.
DC: Mm hmm, mm hmm. And at that time Muncie was very prejudice. Ooh they were very
prejudice. And there was a restaurant there black kids couldn’t even light at. But as far as
campus, see like the campus was sort of a little town within itself. And the teachers, instructors
took an interest in the black kids.
ALC: Okay.
DC: And if you were having trouble, if you went to them they would get you a tutor. They would
help you.
ALC: Okay.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: But there was already a history in your family of people going to college.
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: And it’s going to, I think that might surprise people to hear that.
DC: ‘Cause his two sisters, Aunt Ferna and Aunt Erna, both went to college at Indiana State, and
they taught here in Indianapolis.
ALC: Wow, wow.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Okay.
DC: And she was the first black teacher in the Peoria school system.
ALC: Wow, wow. She was brave.
DC: She was the first black-
ALC: Well actually I think all of these farming families were very brave. ‘Cause they had to be
pioneers to start with-
DC: They had to, that’s right.
ALC: I mean, I hear your dad’s story and it sounds like a lot of the stories these pioneers I’ve
been hearing about, these pioneers from a hundred years before that… You know?
DC: Mm hmm.
ALC: It’s just incredible. I ask everybody I interview this question, and you can take your time
or you don’t have to answer it at all. But, how would you describe yourself? ‘Cause like, you
know, if somebody’s listening to this in fifty years or something like that we have a lot of ways
in which we talk about racial identity in this nation. And a lot of the people don’t get to choose.
And I just want to let you, not let you, but it is your right to choose how people would describe
you. How would you prefer to be described?
DC: Hm, let me think… I think of myself as a very giving person. And I always look at, if
someone is having a problem, if I am aware of it then I am there to help that person. I look at the
person who is failing in something and I do not look down upon them but I look at them, and I
think to myself, “How can I help them if they will accept help?” Here I do a lot of volunteer...
volunteering. I don’t care whether it’s at, I used to volunteer at the hospital. I used to, and then at
church. I work on committees. But I like to be, if I see myself as coming up with a better idea,
I’m going to let them know and if they let me do that then I’m going to do that.
ALC: Mm. You’ve got your dad, some of your daddy in you.
DC: But I try to make it better, just like in my sorority. If we were working on a special project,
and if I think that I have a better way to do it, I’m going to let them know. I’m a visionary
person, and I can… Somehow I can just visualize things up here. And, oh we can do that, there’s
another way we can do that, and maybe an easier way to do that.

[1:35:00] ALC: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
DC: I’m an organized person. I can organize anything. You give me something, I can organize it.
ALC: Well, you put me to shame because I am not a terribly organized person.
DC: I’m a good budgeting person. I can budget-
ALC: Did you watch your parents do that when you were growing up?
DC: I guess. And I listened to them. I listened to them.
ALC: What are some of the things they said about budgeting?
DC: If you don’t have the money, don’t buy it.
ALC: Mmm.
DC: That was it, if you don’t have the money then don’t buy it.
ALC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
DC: And they always talked about saving. It’s not about how much money you can make, it’s
about how much money you save. And that was instilled in us, they drilled that into us. And if
you were working, my first year teaching I didn’t know a thing about a charge card except my
parents had that gas from Standard Oil charge card. So I went to... my first job was in
Milwaukee. And there was a store called Boston Store. Anyway, we got our teaching contracts,
and they found out who the new teachers were, and they sent everyone an envelope. And in that
envelope you could apply for this charge card. I applied for a charge card for the Boston store. I
wanted a coat. And I made… my first year teaching I made four hundred dollars a month. I
brought home two hundred ninety dollars. And I stayed with a family, and so I gave them… she
charged me ninety dollars a month. So anyway, I had this charge card and I wanted a new coat.
So I went to the Boston store and I bought a coat that cost… what was it, two hundred dollars.
Two hundred thirty dollars. And guess what, they told me I could pay ten dollars a month. I
could pay it off that way. Anyway, at the end of the year, I had this charge card. My father saw it
at the end of my first year of teaching. I went home for the summer, and I had this bill from the
Boston store. And, I just had it in my room or on the table someplace, and daddy said, “What is
this?” And I told him that’s where I bought a coat, and they sent me a bill and I had to pay ten
dollars a month for it. And he said, “Come here.” He looked at it and he said, “Come here and sit

down.” He said, “What did you buy?” I bought a coat. How much was it? I think it was two
hundred thirty dollars. He said, “How are you going to pay for it?” He said, “Now wait a
minute… you’re making four hundred dollars a month, and you bring home two hundred ninety
dollars.” He says, “And you’ve got to pay for your room and board.” And he says something like
this, “This coat will be worn out before you get it paid for.” And then he said, I don’t know
anything about interest, and he said, “See how much interest you’re paying?” And so this is what
he told me. “I’m going to pay this off for you, don’t you ever do this again.”
ALC: Mm, mm, mmm. You learned your lesson. You learned a lesson.
DC: I learned a good lesson. I didn’t know anything about a charge card, and I didn’t know
anything about interest.
ALC: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
DC: So he helped me out that year. I’ve been able to stay out of trouble since then.
ALC: But he knew a lot about business. He knew a lot about business.
DC: Oh, yeah.
ALC: That’s the thing I was talking to one of the other families about, I said there’s a lot of sort
of myths about farming. You know, people are, it doesn’t matter about race, but all these people
are backwards or hicks-
DC: Uh huh.
ALC: It’s all about “country.” But I hear these stories about your parents and they sound like
business entrepreneurs.
[1:40:00] DC: Daddy had a good business head on him. Mm hmm. Had a good business head.
He could look at someone. Someone came from the... they were talking about beef cattle. And so
I was with him and so he was looking at daddy’s cows, and so he said, “Karl, how much does it
cost you to raise a calf from the baby calf to the time you sell it?” He came up with it just like
that.
ALC: Wow, he knew it.
DC: He had an answer. Mm hmm, mm hmm.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
ALC: Well, I am honored that you have shared this with me, and-
DC: I could go on and on. I know, but I understand, but if you need some more information all
you have to do is let me know.
ALC: Well, you know I do, and I don’t want to cut this short but it has been a couple of hours
and I don’t want to exhaust you. I don’t want to exhaust you. But before I turn it off, is there
anything else you would like to say? ‘Cause I don’t want to cut you short. Or we can take a quick
break, I can just pause it, we could each get a cup of water and come back for another twenty
minutes or so.
DC: Okay! ‘Cause I-
ALC: Let’s do that, let’s do that. Let’s take that. Okay, so you’re talking about going to JC
Penney in Princeton.
DC: I was in high school, and you know the other girls in my class would talk about how they
could go to a fast food place and they had a job during the summer, or what have you. And so
then I asked my mother, I said, “Why can’t I work during the summer?” And I can buy school
clothes or what have you, and so anyway she took me to Penney’s… JC Penney’s there in
Princeton, and a gentleman talked to us, and at the end he said, “I’m sorry but we do not have
any openings right now, we’re not hiring anyone right now.”
ALC: Mmm.
DC: And so anyway, my neighbor, I found out about this… And so then two or three days later
he took his daughter there, to JC Penney’s. He wanted to know if they were hiring. They gave
her a job.
ALC: Oh.
DC: And so then he came back and talked to my parents about it. And so daddy told me, “You
know, now that’s beginning a part of life that you’re going to have to go through. You’re going to
be denied things and you might as well just accept it.”
ALC: Woah.
DC: That’s what he said.
ALC: But he didn’t always accept it. He didn’t always accept it. Hm. Wow.

Interview with Delores Casey, September 1, 2019
DC: And so I never worked. I never had a job during the summer.
ALC: Mmm. Even though you would have liked to.
DC: I would have liked to!
ALC: I’m sorry, I’ve got to pause this. I just realized both my computer-
