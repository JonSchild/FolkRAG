Dear Sir:
 
It takes a lot to get me to put my feminist hat on these days
 
-- there are so many other things to get outraged about --
but the February 1996 issue of the SMITHSONIAN has finally
 
done it.
 
The cover is sexist and condescending,  the photographs
 
illustrating the lead article  (
pps.94-99)  no better.  I was so
 
irritated,  I almost didn't read the article itself. When I
 
did,  it turned out that Maggie Steber had done a professional
 
piece on a complicated situation,  but those cutesey
 
illustrations distorted her research and didn't suggest a
 
truly serious conflict that is going on.
 
The fact is that the National Square Dancing Convention has
 
dedicated itself to a cause that has engendered nation-wide
 
concern:  to make the square dance  (
their version,  complete
 
with baby-doll skirts)  "the national dance of the United
 
States".  I myself,  along with folklorists from the
 
Smithsonian and the Library of Congress. have,  in several
 
previous years,  testified before Congress in opposition to
 
their bill. Our view was and is that no single dance form can
 
at present represent our complex national unity.  The
 
selection of national symbols is a complex task:  consider the
 
polka,  tap dance,  round dance,  hip hop, mambo,  hula,  etc.,
 
each identifying varied American populations.  Is the square
 
dance to be elevated above all these others to the status of
 
the national anthem,  the American flag?
 
Don't you folks ever consult your own experts within your own
 
institution?  Any folklorist at the Center for Folklore
 
Programs and Culture Studies could have filled you in on the
 
complex issues involved in this "amusing" little article.
 
And frankly,  had you shown me the entire issue,  I would also
 
have pointed out the equally irritating photographic
 
portrayals of southern life in your story on the Irwin Museum
 
(which is simply one more of the myriad "old-timey days"
 
collections that dot our landscape).  You have actually
 
outdistanced most other magazines by simultaneously featuring
 
the two major caricatures of southern womanhood -- the
 
impoverished,  out-dated,  helpless,  uneducated old mountain
 
woman  (
p.  47)
 and the cutie-pie, middle class,  out-dated,
 
uneducated baby doll  (
cover; p.  93-99).  Good grief.
 
In the same mailing,  I received several requests for
 
membership renewal.  You know,  people across the country
 
believe in things that reach them that say "Smithsonian";
 
they think that means that they're reading as close to the
 
truth as we can get these days.  So you have a responsibility
 
to publish a magazine with a lot more in mind than just
 
competing with the other covers on the drugstore display
 
racks.  You ought to make sure your articles and their
 
pictures are edited by someone who knows something about the
 
subject.  I
' m going to hold off resubscribing for a while.
 
Very truly yours,
