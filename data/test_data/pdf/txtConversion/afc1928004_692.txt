A 
Question I 
Would Like to Ask. 
Written and snug witla electric success by the great Frank Lewis 
Each day you will hear of things that are queer, 
I'm puzzled quite often, ' tis true; 
Though you will not be able to answer I 
fear, 
I'll put a 
few questions to you. 
I 
have not come here conundrums to give, . 
Or to set you a 
very hard task, 
If the reduced tivercent fare Jay Gould did scare, 
Is a. question I'd like to ask, 
CHORUS. 
It s 
a 
question I'd like to ask, 
To answer it may be quite a 
task, 
now Freddy Gebhardt won the Jersey Lily's heart, 
Is a 
question I'd like to ask. 
Can you tell why Sullivan and Coburn fell out, 
And what's the weight of the big giant Slade. 
And if Sullivan should meet him in the ring, 
Would the big fellow feel quite afraid. 
Can you tell why John Hart is getting so fat, 
He look§ like a 
walking beer cask, 
If Mary Walkers new pants were impOrted from France, 
Is a 
question I'd like to ask.

A QUESTION I 
WOULD LIKE TO ASK. 
Caul-it P,. 
It's a 
que‘tion that I'd like to ask, 
It may be a 
very bard task, 
How Bob Ingersoll can tell if the fire's out 
is a 
question I'd like to ask. 
A man that is wealthy can gamble in stock, 
And still a 
good church member be: 
But if caught playing earls he'll have to explain, 
Or in prison soon lock , d 
up he will be 
Can you tell me why some people religion use, 
Just for a 
a 
hypocrites mask, 
Why they say good preachers kiss the Sunday 
school teachers : 
is a 
question that I'd like to ask.

It's a 
question that I'd like to ask, 
To answer it is qu te a

What makes the girls faint, or their faces paint,

Meet Me Darling. 
By CharlesStokes. 
Sung by Frank Lewis. 
Meet me, darling, meet me, 
While the moon's soft silver light, 
Falls on the fragrant roses 
At the eventide of night 
Oh ! meet me at the elm tree, 
The spot we love so well, 
Oh meet me, darling, meet me, 
I've something there to tell. 
Cuortus. 
Meet me, oh ! darling meet me. 
While the moon a 
soft silver light, 
Meet me. darling, meet me, 
At the eventide of night. 
Beneath its spreading branches, 
Meet me, daring, meet me there 
And pledge to me thy maiden love, 
Thou innocent and fair. 
Within the casket of my heart, 
That gem I'll softly lay, 
And vigils o'er it I 
will keep, 
Till life has passed iway.

of the topics, events of the day, 
But now for the present, 
something new say: 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seer 
Whose name in our memory %% ill always be green. 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand, is a 
true friend indeel 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet, 
He's one of the men we cannot forget. 
New York in her day has produced some good names. 
Of men who have climbed up the ladder of fame, 
Who have shown a 
good record, brilliant and grand. 
Au honor to the state, and,also our land. 
There is one from our midst who has just passed * ay, 
He will be remembered for 11;ally a 
day. 
Though he's gone from this world, tho' gone 
we find yet, 
Ex-Governor Morgan we can't soon forget. 
The stage it has likewise had many bright lights, 
Whose faces we miss from behind the footlights. 
There's Sothern, Charlotte Cushman, 
Dan Bryant as well, 
Ed. Adams and others, ton numerous to tell. 
New York here of late had one to admire, 
An actor of who's praise we never can tire, 
His career was a 
great one his loss we regret, 
Oharles R. Thorne Jr,. we can never forget.

A 
Up the Ladder Round by Round. 
By Arthur W. French. 
Sung by America's greatest/topical 
vocalist, Frank Lewis, 
The world's a 
school where men learn wisdom, 
As we journey on in life; 
Better far than school or collage, 
For its struggle and its strife. 
And we find that rank and station, 
Wealth and honor upward lies, 
They're not gained by contemplation, 
We must climb to win the prize. 
CHORUS. 
Life's a 
ladder, and when lowly, 
Rests its foot upon the ground, 
We must step by step climb slowly, 
Up the ladder round by round. 
Ye who toil at honest labor, 
In life's lower path to-d 
Envy not a 
richer neighbor. 
Who has passed you on the way. 
He has stood where you are standing, 
Yet by perseverance he 
Now success and wealth commanding, 
May look down on such as we. • 
Look around you, see the many, 
Who by toil the prize have won; 
This be your motto, best of any, 
I 
can do what they have done. 
Day by day your way pursuing, 
At the foot you must begin, 
Time and courage fortune conquers, 
In the end you're sure to win, 
Chi 'raft. 
Chorus. 
What we Need in America 
To-Day. 
Written and sung by the great vocalist Frank Lewis, 
We have all read the story of our forefather's glory, 
And how under Washington they nobly fought; 
By their great bravery, they freed us from slavery, 
And with their lives they our liberty bpught. 
The rights we inerit they won by merit, 
And the free constitution that should hold sway, 
Honest men, true and bold, like those patriots of old, 
That's what we want in America to- day. 
Our political robbers like the star route fraud jobbers, 
Millions have made by knavery and stealth 
Our laws they defy, and justice can buy, 
And from prison escape because they have wealth. 
The corrupt politician's who hold high positions, 
Let into office by tricks and foul play; 
Men honest in action, free from party faction, 
That's what we want in America to-day. 
Our modern young.ladies are duckies and daisies 
And look fascinating in their fine clothes; 
Those rosebuds of fashion turn out very dashing, 
But how they can do it, nobody knows. 
Our young men don't marry, the reason they tarry, 
Their wife's toys with their stamps would 
soon skip away, 
A 
dear little honey who won't squander your money, 
What's what we need in our country to-day. 
its 
Tried and True. 
A TOPICAL SONG. 
written and sung by the great vocalist Frank Lewis, 
To this land of freed in from far across the sea, 
Come men of every nation to enjoy its liberty. 
For here we all are equal in the race of life, 
The rich and poor all stand a 
chance 
to conquer in its strife. 
On our country's roll of honor some names 
are wrote in gold. 
Of their deeds of bravery history has told, 
We owe a 
debt of gratitude to our brave boys in blue. 
Who in the hour of danger, when tried were found true. 
In poor oppressed old Ireland the whole world 
now can see, 
Her sons long held in bondage are struggling to be fre., 
Old Erin has her heroes their names we do know well, 
The martyred patriots, Emmett, Dillon and Parnell, 
To free his native country brave Emmett lost his life, 
And now the gallant Land League, for 
Home Rule raise a 
strife, 
Those gallant sons of Erin their duty tried to do, 
And in their fight for freedom were tried and found true 
At the head of our great nation to guide our 
ship of state. 
Stands him who shapes our destiny, and shapes 
our country's fate, 
On his deeds in office we look with anxious eyes. 
And hope he'll prove a 
statesman honest, 
true and wise, 
Let him follow in the foot steps by martyred 
Garfield made, 
To fight for just and honest laws let him not oe afraid. 
Then like a 
glorious patriot his duty he would do, 
And we can say of Arthur, when tried we found 
him true.

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG. 
Written and sung with immense succPsg at Olympic Theatre, Chicago. 
by FRANK LEwts. 
Also the Great Hit in New York. 
This world is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, distinction and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in way behind, and you'll very often find 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
I 
will tell you here to- night, things that pass before my sight 
The mistakes of many folks I'll put in song, 
'These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
They say, another good man has gone wrong. 
In days that now are past, there is. one whose name will last; 
As a 
warning strong to hundreds in our land; 
He wa;: once the Tammany boss, and New York feels his 
loss. 
A 
true friend to the honest workingman .; 
Though he robbed our city sure, still he helped our starving 
poor, 
And comfort brOught to many a 
pitiful throng; 
'Tis of poor Tweed now I 
sing, but remember just one thing 
He was but another good man that's gone wrong. 
Throughout this glorious land. you will often find a 
man 
Who has fallen and weaved in a 
depth of crime; 
He possesses manly traits, but is working against fate, 
To a 
life of degradation seems resigned; 
I 
am not out here to preach, but a 
lesson T 
would teach, 
A 
motto I 
would give you in my 
Do song:
not pass him with a 
frown, lift -him up when lie is dowx 
He may have been a 
good man that's gone wrong. 
Our preachers now so meek, they took a 
sudden freak, 
By denouncing an actress of great fame; 
From their pulpits now they preach, and their congrega-
tion teach, 
Sarah Bernhardt is a 
woman of bad name; 
In the town of Montreal, the clergymen there all, 
Denounced her in language loud and strong; 
But if they'd look more to home, they would find a 
mom: 
their own, 
There is many a 
good old preacher that's gone wrong. 
HAVE YOU SEEN BERNHARDT? 
Sung with great applause at Colisseum Theatre, and Vine Street 
Opera House, Cincinnati, by FRANK LEWIS. 
ve been to the North Pole, I've sat me down upon it, 
f've swung around this great, big world, on the tail-end of 
a 
comet, 
l've seen Salvmi on tile stage poor Desdemona smother, 
Heard Beecher preach, and Talmage screech, and kick up 
such a 
bother; 
I've also been to Salt Lake Town, where poor emigrants 
are wheedled, 
I 
had a 
patch put in my pants by Cleopatra's needle;. 
I've seen the pyramids so large, they say was built by Pha-
roalt, 
But still I'm behind the times, because I've not seen Sarah. 
CHORUS: 
Have you seen Sarah, none thinner and sparer, 
She can parlez-vous francais with a 
comical squall; 
There's no one can scare her, she is such a 
teaser, 
If you've not seen Sarah, you've seen naught at all. 
I've also been to -Washington, with treasury girls been frisky 
With Mr. Haves in the White House, I 
have drank sone , 
good old whisky; 
I've seen the Passion Play produced, and nothing could 
fi net., 
I 
have a 
pig tail from the head of the Emperor of China; 
I've also heard Bob Ingersoll preach there is no hereafter. 
I've seen the great Hobson & Crane, and they caused me 
so much lau(thter; 
I've been with Grant around the world, dined with the 
Shah of Cairo, 
But still I 
am behind the times, because I've not seen Sarah. 
CHORUS: 
Have you seen Sarah, none thinner and sparer, 
From clay with 1

hands she makes babies with 
wings; 
There's no one can scare her, she is such a 
teaser, 
This damsel called Sarah, who does such funny things

Eminent Men we Have and Have Not. 
As Sung Originally at the Olympic Theatre, N. Y. 
By Pi:term LEWIS. 
Sow a 
few days ago while on things ruminating, 
I 
thought of the present, I 
thought of the past. 
I 
thought of the strange things we're every day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom ; 
We have Lot Lafayette, who from France came to fight— 
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third term, just to set matters right. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Gettysburgh's Hero, 
But we have the brave Sherman, wno marched to the Bea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend— 
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago. 
When the fire fiend upon them made such a 
great raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send 3 
ou to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom! 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's great Hero. 
He strove for his countrj bright laurels to win 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have pliant Little Mac, who at Antietam fighting, 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also; 
Ben Butler's stirs with us, one eye on the spoons— 
And :3::!,1,saam Young still keeps a 
getting new wives Sir, 
And his. 1!fa he's still s-oending in sweet honeymoons. 
we'vo I sho hz'...v3 leaders who won for us Freedom, 
And f...4 stare in our banner so firmly did 
Yet, in ',is year's Centennial, we .proved to the nations, 
we ramembered the Heroes of 014 '76 
Prank Lewis's Great Local Statue Song. 
As sung by him at the different Theatres with success. 
WE are erecting many statues to great people in our land, 
And well I 
love to honor them, a 
noble gallant band. 
In Union Square stands Washington, the chief who made ow 
name, 
And honest Abraham Lincoln, almost of an equal fame. 
And in the centre Lafayette beholds the noble work, 
And fifty others proudly stand, in the City of New York. 
So I 
myself have made a 
list of men who fame have won, 
That should have statues made for them, for things which they 
have done. 
So now I'll open out my list, and tell you in my song, 
The position that each statue holds, as best to him belongs. 
I'd have Belknap cheating soldiers out of rations every day, 
And Mr. Schenck slipping the cut, when poker he did play. 
I'd have a 
crucible fast tied on the back of Oakey Hall, 
And Grant a 
smoking a 
cheap segar, with two bull-dogs great 
and small. 
I'd have Harriet Beecher Stowe, P4st tied on the back of Byron' 
Ghost, 
And Sankey's hundred sheep, served up in one big mutton roast. 
I'd have an Alderman in great surprise, putting on a 
nice clean 
shirt, 
A 
Policcman seeking danger, where there's no chance to be hurt. 
A 
Ballet Girl with nothing on, wlairlinr- round upon her toes, 
Each Politician sal: in jail, playing chequers with hic nose. 
I'd have Pc:tor 'Z'ooper'z Grilbaclis, spread around like the 
suns' ray 
And every workingman shouh-:

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
As sung by FRANN. LEwts at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn 
I. have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed 7 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whol3 nation still wish he was here: 
A. Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in Washing7on some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Tine& 
never forget. 
New York in it 
day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men: 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life Nra'; a 
warning', ft history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret. 
These are som3 of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too nunie:ous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a little maiden tif , stage ha; had yet, 
Maio's sweet face we simull iico7' forget.

Afilit,d4a,••••, 
GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. 
E. 
DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEVas, 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
DI this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our dew 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick ori? 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away., 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat. 
The boy descended to the deck. of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our den 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hen; 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty vomit: 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wasdtriftirl'd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric'sbburniQiclime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds. from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinksitt 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they_cried,_God bless that dear old flag'

CAN'T UNDERSTAND, 'CAN YOU? 
Written and sung at Harry Miner's Theafre. N, Y., by Faerra LEWIS. 
with unbounded applause. 
I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
I 
can't understand, can you?

I

Why Russia's great Czar was blown from ht R

Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's been married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six b 
tides his life to encumber; 
While there is i)oor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me,

' 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND, CAN YOU?—CONTINITED 
Now there's General Grant, our Ex- President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a 
Tanner; 
He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS; 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who sap; 
Grace every day, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her bead, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I

DON'T FLY YOUR RITE Too high, 
THE KINGDOM IN THE SKY. 
A Dream LEWIS had one night. 
Sung by him with the Comedy and 
American Four Combination, Murphy & Shannon, 
Murphy S.: Mack and Company. 
While thinking of a 
subject for a 
song the other night, 
While seated by my cheerful fire which then was blazing 
bright; 
I 
fancied I 
was roaming in a 
kingdom in the sky, 
And I 
really saw curious sights, to sing you them I'll try; 
I 
found myself surrounded by all people of renown, 
Who acted as if crazy, and their tricks I've noted down; 
So if you pay attention, while the moments they pass by, 
I'll tell you all the sights I 
saw in the kingdom in th e sky. 
Our railroads they stood firm again, our companies took 
more care, 
Politicians they were honest, and acted on the square; 
Olive Logan she went on the stagb, in the ballet she was set 
Jake Aberle was looking for a 
place in Garfield's Cabinet; 
Little Lotta played a 
jewsharp, John McCullough danced 
a 
jig, 
Harry Miner shaved his moustache off, because it grew so big 
Kate Claxton was a 
fireman, for fame she soared most high 
And Beecher preached for a 
dollar a 
day in the kingdom 
in the sky. 
Mr. Hayes gave up the President's chair, and temperance 
lectures gave, 
Sammy Tilden said the Wh1te House was the only thing 
he craved; 
Garfield he was trading mules through the country far and 
n ear, 
Francis Murphy and Moody and Sankey they played seven 
up for beer; 
Joe Emmet joined a 
circus and comic songs he sung, 
Senator Conkling he was getting away from Sprague's 
barreled gun; 
Tony Pastor was dressed up in tights and playing the 
French Spy, 
John Hart was Barnum's skeleton in the kingdom in the 
sky.

For he's happy when cutting a

But of one thing I 
wish to remind you, 
When for sporting and drinking you sigb, 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket 
And don't fly your kite up too high.

Then don't fly your kite up too high, boys;

If you go to a 
friend to assist you, 
He'll say that his money's play'd out, 
But when he was-down, you to help him, 
Put your hand in your pocket, no doubt. 
But this world it is cruel and cold, boys, 
Though good times may come by and by; 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
Then don't fly, etc. 
There's many a 
good-natured fellow 
That's been ruined by just what I

For if he'd a " Five" in his pocket, 
He'd feel like a

Just. listen to me what I

REEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
Ifticeess, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about HOI in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps lie will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum.

LION BREWERY BEER. 
• A 
comic effusion sang by FRANE Linn's, at Harry Minetv 
Theatre, New York. 
.•••••=110 tmoneme 
The other night while feeling blue, 
I 
thought I'd stroll around; 
And see some of the famous sights 
With which this town abounds, 
A 
strange sensation thrilled me, 
And my throat felt dry and queer, 
So I 
stepped into a 
beer saloon, 
To get a 
glass of beer. 
I 
found it so refreshing, 
I 
thought I'd try one more; 
And liking the experiment, 
I 
repeated o'er and o'er; 
Some very funny fancies 
To my mind did soon appear, 
I'll tell you some of the sights I 
saw, 
Pull of Lion Brewery Beer. 
I 
saw the waiters in this house, 
When schooners they did bring; 
Peep slyly through the door to see 
If the Cap was on the wing; 
I 
saw spy Kimball on the train 
Where Whitney round did tear; 
Because he'd not appear in Court, 
And bring the gamblers there. 
Captain Williams in a 
garbage box, 
Was sentenced there to dwell; 
And stay until the Judgment day, 
And live upon the smell; 
The Salvation Army the other night 
Were off upon a 
tear, 
They were found up at Flarry 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer.

I ON BREWERY BEER—CoNTI:\-urau 
We had no railroad accidents, 
And stocks were above par; 
Beecher kept a 
beer saloon, 
John B. Gough tended bar; 
I 
saw Conkling commit suicide, 
When Jim Blaine won the race; 
When they both ran like Garfield's mul 
In his Cabinet for a 
place. 
Steve Taylor and George Hooke I 
saw, 
Fight the other day; 
That is, I 
would have seen them fight, 
But Taylor ran away; 
I 
saw the exhibition start, 
Which Grant is trying to stew; 
I 
saw our dirty streets kept clean 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
But there's one thing I 
will say; 
I 
hope I 
have amused you with 
My quiet little lay; 
I 
book it for a 
topic, 
To pass the time along; 
And try and sing you something new, 
In the way of a 
comic song. 
There's many times that l've appeared 
Before you one and all, 
A warm and loving welcome 
I've received from great and small; 
So to my New York friends 
I 
now return my thanks again, 
I'll drink your health in a 
social glasa 
Of Lion Brewery Beer.

KNEW THAT I 
WAS DREAMING. 
Written and composed by FRED ALBERT. 
Music published by E. H. TT 
—ARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price 10 
cents. 
Dreams are the strangest things in life, 
So fanciful, yet real, 
Sometimes depicting scenes of strife, 
In others they reveal 
Such happiness, that were it not 
Some sign the spell was breaking, 
That we were sleeping we'd forget, 
And fancy we were waking. 
Some strange dreams I 
have had of late, 
My brain with thoughts been teeming, 
And if you'll listen I 
will state 
What I've seen when I've been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
race- course, 
And a 
crowd assembled there, 
To watch each noble race-horse, 
As towards the post they tear; 
I 
dreamt there was no welching— 
But all were acting fair, 
And I 
thought there was no filching, 
Or card sharping I 
declare. 
Well soon the race did begin, 
The colors they were streaming, 
And I 
thought each jockey tried to win--
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
postman, 
Who was hurrying on his round, 
Of letters he'd a 
host, man, 
And so nimbly on he bounds; 
I 
thought it just struck eight o'clock, 
The maid the steps was cleaning, 
And I 
thought he gave a 
gentle knock, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
He was so curiously arrayed, 
The buttons bright were gleaming, 
Then some one said he was well paid, 
Then I 
knew. I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw an area gate, 
And a 
bobby standing near, 
A 
servant maid with mincing gait, 
Come forth to fetch some beer; 
I 
saw him kiss her on the sly, 
So life-like it was seeming, 
But when lie refused some rabbit pie— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
A row commenced close by there, when 
For police they loud were screaming, 
He came when he was wanted, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
music hall, 
And a 
waiter on his way, 
To serve some gent within the stalls, 
With something on a 
tray; 
I 
saw him hand politely 
The glass with liquor streaming, 
But he went away without the fee, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
thought that every comic song 
Was full of wit and meaning, 
I 
felt convinced that I 
was wrong— 
And knew I 
must be dreaming. 
THE PATRIOT'S DREAM. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music Pub. E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. 
Written and adapted by FRANK LEW/S, 
One morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
On a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate; 
When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A 
dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes! 
I 
raised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pass'd, in strange array, 
A 
great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notie'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Thm e 
shone a 
rainbow bright 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft — she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
Unt ) the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men cf Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack C'dd droop, 
By Freedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main; 
Few Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steed 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift ! 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn; 
And still their hearts with patriot fire 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold. 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die ! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more 
Our glorious Constitution, boss! 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales. 
Defy the invading foe ; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling ! 
I 
saw old Independence Ball, 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
"'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag. and proudly said—

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE, 
Motto Song. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
This world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power. 
All others to throw in the shade. 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun. 
To gain great distinction, he really must try 
To do something that's never been dtme. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss, 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clew. 
My idea for improvement is this. 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
They are willing to toil, let us give them the chancr 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too. 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue. 
There is only one way to p:osperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our laud.

Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the 13ootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen.

He'd gone away and left 'set without a

Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink.

WHAT legions of friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh! if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down? 
CHORUS. 
So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do) 
Sickness and sorrow way fall unto you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down 
What if, when you had not a 
sorrow 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wantQd to borrow 
You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a 
friend you ne'er slighted 
You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down. 
CHORUS.—So 
let all your, 4to. 
Then give me the heart that for ever 
Is free from the world's selfish rust, 
And the soul whose high, noble endeavor,

A 
victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift up a

Many Things that Ought not to Be., 
Original Song by Fax LEWIS. 
As snug by him 
at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
There is not a 
day as we pass thro' this life, 
And I 
think you will with me agree, 
There a 
re many mistakes in this world we do meet, 
And things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that a 
soldier who fought in the war, 
And lost, perhaps an arm or a 
leg, 
Should grind a 
hand-organ to please passers by, 
And for food, on our charity beg ? 
CHORUS. 
These thin a 
should be stopped in this great land of ours' 
Where every man boasts he is free; 
So I 
thought I'd tell you, by words in my song, 
Many things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that each Savings Bank always should break. 
And the depositors receive not a 
dime; 
Is it right, the ladies, striped stockings should wear, 
Ard knock us poor men out of time. 
Isit right a 
poor workman should wear out his life, 
And earn but one sixty a 
day, 
While some roll in ri hes, big sinecures hold ? 
These are thlngs that ought not to be. 
Thea,e things should be, &c. 
Is it right that our army it should be cut down 
To save but a 
dollar or two; - 
Was it right to send Custer and a 
few hundred men. 
To ba ki:led by the wi'd Indian foe; 
Is it iht to mix silver with copper and brass, 
And give it to us to make change; 
Is it right to let Spain still give us the laugh. 
When the Virginius we've yet to revenge ? 
These things should be, S
E41. 
Is it right that the White House should bear the name 
Of Headquarters! where swindles are done; 
Where they steal all they can from a 
poor soldier's food, 
To a 
barrel of whis. ey or rum; 
Is it right, when we've millions of acres to spare, . 
And all the whole world we could feed, 
That a 
man should be poor, in this great land of ours, 
For which our brave fathers did bleed ?

RIDING ON THE. RAILWAY. 
Written by D. A. KELLY. 
Sung by COLLTER & LILLY. 
While riding on the railway cars the other day, 
A. very funny incident happened by the way; 
A 
woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
Got on at a 
way station, convenient to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her vall, 
And turning to me, asked Is this the Morning Mail? 
I 
told her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When suddenly in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loafer I 
she says to me, Its very well you knows; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady so. 
Says I, Madam. what I'm guilty of I'm sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose again in haste, 
And says, Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for 
-tickling of my legs. 
In the railway stn. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her—she was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
Her great big market basket, and then, how very shocking! 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
CnoRus. 
In the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not de 
Is certainly very hard, as I 
now have shown to you. 
PENNSYLVANIA'S FAVORITE SONS. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, with great success. 
I'll sing to you of men so great we lost with deep regret, 
And men whose present deeds are such we never shall forget, 
Whose names are written boldly on the title page of fame, 
That our children in the future might seek for such a 
name. 
To lead an honest, upright life some people think it hard, 
It is the sure and only way our future peace to guard; 
Look always on the brighter side as the sands of life it runs. 
You may be numbered e'er you die with Pennsylvania's favor-
ite sons. 
Ned Forrest formed the actor's home, a 
rest for poor old men, 
Whose life was passed upon the stage, a 
horn; he made fot 
them; 
Great Curtin, our war Governor, each regiment well manned, 
Stephen Girard he won a 
name when he our college planned, 
Sam Randall, now our Speaker, in this State first did live. 
And the patriots in the days of old did freedom to us give; 
Our library stands supreme, more thanks to Dr. Rush, 
Who left a 
million dollars cash that none its power could crush. 
In this State John Morton lived, in it " Thad." Stevens died, 
From here brave Hancock went to fight when he the foe defied; 
Within this town Ben. Franklin lies, the glory of all men, 
I 
glory when I 
sing to you ye sons of William Penn.

THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL'. 
An Original Song by FRANE LEWLS. 
As snug by him 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both toe great and the small; 
It's about some good inn I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's P:edessional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced by Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you eau bet at the Actor's .frre it Bain 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham s 
kiss from Miss Neilson he took! 
Lester Wallack. he shaved off his whiskers, and gave theb • 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her tl gs used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's 1: ew dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his b iler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Braharns to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing, 
'Which gave to t 
tie critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett & Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boueicault came in with a 
play he bad stolen, 
And closed up the daN lights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ' gainst the wall. 
Harrigan & Hart then appearedin their unequalled effusion*. 
And that put an end teel,ors Great Ball! • 
THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
I 
Mn. FRANK LEWIS' Great Original Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
Wonderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free, 
The stars and stripes which brightly wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
It floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mire, 
It filled brave men in every clime with patr.otic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Green! 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen. 
It stood on Bunker's Mountain Coast, where Warren nobly died, 
And in the cause of Freedom boys, it all the world defied. 
It spread its folds at Valley Forge, 'mid storm of rain .
and snow; 
It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washington it placed its wings, as in the boat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flood. 
It brightly waved at DiAlymount; when Gildersleeve he shot; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden Prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down 'mid screams of wild despair, 
It prou4ly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there. 
ts folds protected Sheridan when he did swiftly ride; 
Tit went with Sherman to the sea, when he to conquer tried. 
Defending it young Ellsworth fell, and free without a 
stain. 
It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott a 
t 
Lundy's Tana  
It went with Rough and Ready against a 
foreign foe; 
Its shadow spread destruction o'er the plains of Mexico: 
And down with Jackson, in the South, behind his cotton balea. 
That starry emblem was unfurled ' till victory prevailed. 
It floats on every foreign shore, our own beloved flag! 
And curses light on him, my boys, who low its folds would drag; 
On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped by our tars; 
On land each Freedom's loving on does bless its Stripes and Stars! 
But brighter, boys, it ne'er did shine, than when the people all, 
Met on the Founh of last July, in Independence Hall— 
And raised that banner to the clouds with loud triumphant cry— 
Dist just eate hundrod years had passed, singe it did the world dotas,*

There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
And it's looking o'er at me, 
Till its glances soft and loving 
Fills my soul with ecstacy, 
And its pretty eyes are blending 
Like the moon-lit sky when blue 
With its radiance transcending 
lake the rainbow's lovely hue. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
Bee it glancing through the pane. 
And my heart is sadly waiting 
Till I

2bere is music softly flowing 
From those sweet lips thro' the air 
And my heart with love is glowing 
For that sweet faze over there, 
And its melody is sounding, 
Till I 
feel its joyous thrill, 
And my spirit quickly bounding 
To its music sweet and still. 
There's a

You who are so handsome, dashing,

Finding life not what it seems.

That is ever in my view, 
And it fills me o'er with gladness,

Charactar So g 
written and sung by-C. H, Hughes. 
Behold a 
fib le minded chap, 
I've been jilted twice or more, 
I 
don't see why I 
ne'er can wed, 
The girl that I 
adore. 
I 
always was quite nobby, 
At least that's what I 
tho ght, 
They all seem to dislike my shape, 
And they know it's not my fault, 
They know, they kno , they know ! 
And they know it's not my fault. 
When fi st I 
loved you've no idea, 
How my heart went pit a 
pat, 
I 
fed my girl on caramels, 
Gum drops and things like that; 
She filled me full of flattery, 
And called me darling dear, 
But when I 
popped the question she said, 
Go slide off on your ear go slide, 
Go slide, go slide, go slide, 
Go slide off on your ear. 
My friends said don't discouraged be, 
But try your luck again, 
I 
think it was a 
pot up job, 
For the next was just the same. 
She drained me of my fortune, 
At least of all I 
bad. 
And when I 
asked her for her hand, 
She said go ask my dad, 
She said, she said, she said, 
She maid go ask my dad, 
THE BUSY B'S. 
Az Original Song, as Sung by FBx LEWIS, with iza• 
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy E's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name ; 
*So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, sir. 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sic, 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
lie is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see.

A 
companion song to the Minstrel Band, an original song, 
as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athenwum, Boston, Mass. 
I 
HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Unsworth, 
And Eph. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a 
token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on these boards, 
But whose memory shall never be dead. 
C
HORUS. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall Ism 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to tie land of the bleak 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has worn.

THE WINNER IN THE END. 
Written and sung with success by FRANK LEWIS at Buckingham 
Theatre, Louisville, Sy., and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N. Y. 
As new songs are all the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
There is many a 
glorious maxim you will find; 
But there's one more than the rest, seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often it comes stealing o'er my mind; 
So this advice I'll give you all to-night, 
Endeavor to look manly, strong and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's battle's 
fought, 
You'll find you'll be the winner in the end. 
They are killing Kings and Queens, and tramping down 
the green, 
In Europe all the Monarchs feel afraid; 
That the people they will fight, and stand up for their right, 
And on the great nobility they'll raid; 
But why don't they come here, where men can live, 
Where freedom unto all we freely give; 
Where the whole world finds a 
home, leaves Kings unto 
their doom, 
Uncle Sam is always winner in the end. 
In the papers we oft read, of peculiar things, indeed, 
And many changes that we see in life; 
It is custom in this land, for each and every man, 
To take unto himself a 
little wife; 
If there's any lately married here to-night, 
May your fireside be always cosy, bright; 
And if in your future days, a 
flock of boys you try to raise 
I 
hope you'll come out winner in the end. 
,,bout every week or so, we have walking matches, true, 
And one city patronizes them quite free; 
How each pedestrian tries, to gain the given prize, 
And sometimes they succeed most manfully; 
There's Hughes who made the best recorded time, 
And others have shown a 
record fine; 
But what seems to me so queer, when Rowell does walk here 
We never come out winner in the end, 
WE WANT A 
PRESIDENT. 
As sung by FRANK LEwts, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates. 
Now I 
show no partiality, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present- taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
man who'll bring us back, the good old-times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land. and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe. for our next President. 
Our Country is a 
glorious one, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions. last September at Creedmoor 
But to make our rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in office who will violate their trust, 
By shieliiing " Crooked Whiskey Rings," or doing things unjust 
We care not for their politics, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
We want a 
true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want no men who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And trieh to tL0-.7 our hr- pct name forever in the shade.

OUR ACTORS OF THE PAST. 
As originally sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Howard Athenzenes, 
Boston. Mass. 
I 
have told you of the minstrel of our past and by-gone day, 
I 
will sing you now of actors great who from us have passed 
away, 
Of men who trod the mimic stage, our glory and our pride, 
Of women who have shown so bright, and all the world defied. 
No more will Burton's merry laugh. as ' Toodles," greet our ears, 
No more George Holland, in " Rosedale," awake our smiles or 
tears; 
No more will Mrs. Conway her brightest comedies play, 
She was an actress of the past, one of the by-gone day. 
No more as " Sir Giles Overreach" will our great Davenport 
stand, 
Nor yet matilde Heron as - Camille " entrance the land. 
No more will Lucille Western as " Poor Nancy Sykes" defy 
The Brutal husband she still loved and yet not fear to die. 
No more will dear old Ben de Bar with joy the footlights see, 
Nor 0, L. Fox. the king of clowns. " Humpty Dumpty" act far 
And Charlotte Cushman we will love while life itself shall lent, 
Though as " Meg Merillies" she has gone a 
bright actress of the 
past. 
No more Claude Burroughs speak his lines, our hearts with 
love inspire, 
He fell wilh Murdock 'midst the flames a 
victim to the fire. 
No more will Barney Williams as the " Connie Soogah 
stand. 
Within the fairy circle with his, Colleen hand in hand. 
No more will Mark Smith tune his note to sing his jovial SOB& 
Ned Forrest face the footlights where his gloricus fame ire. 
longs; 
No more will Edwin Adams hi ,; " Enoch Arden" play, 
A 
brilliant actor of the past from us now torn away.

And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank, 
They are hubbies on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not honest be.

It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man.

LATE TELEGRAM SONG. 
As Sung Originally by Mr. FRANC LEWIS, 
GIVE A 
THOUGHT TO THE HONEST 
WORK. 
INGMAN. 
An original song sung by FRANK L
EWIS, at the Grand Quint 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
This is a 
world of luck and chance, of losses and of gain, 
Some lives are filled with pleasure, while others naught but palk 
If yours is filled with comfort enjoy it while you can, 
But sometimes try and give a 
thought to the honest workingman, 
There's many a 
mighty millionaire who now sleeps in his grave, 
Who never gave a 
single dime the laboring man to save, 
Of such as these to sing about 'tis not my aim or plan, 
For I'll sing of men who gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There is one, who though in wealth he rolled, whose charity 
was sure, 
And the clink of his bright yellow gold was music to the poor, 
And many a 
cheerless hearthstone by his kindness was mad* 
bright 
In noble deeds of charity that never saw the light. 
By some beloved, by some adored, by others fawned around, 
He turned not to the right or left but nobly stood his ground, 
In every m:ghty enterprise each project or each plan, 
George Peabody always gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There was a 
man who rose to fame and fortune, swift and sure, 
Whose name will be remembered in our hearts forevermore; 
Though wealth rolled in his coffers for years on every hand, 
He shared it with the hungry and the poor of this bright laud. 
He was a 
Nature's nobleman if ever there was one, 
A 
tender, loving husband, a 
kind and gentle son; 
His bright face we will see no more, forget him now who can? 
Lb. Lincoln always gave a 
thosigit to the honest workingman. 
I 
en going to sing a 
little song, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches that have come o'er land and sea: 
There are some will make you sob and cry, and others make you laugh 
The many funny messages sent threugh my telegraph. 
The Fenians have conquered Holland, old Turkey's taken sick; 
They've made an Indian Princess of our good old friend Queen Vie.

WHAT I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO. 
Written and Sung by MR. HARRY WHALING With great success M 
'rONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
If you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as it moves round, none of us can tell, 
How soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, when too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Chorw—So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
If your wealthy why stretch out your hand to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-off and greet., 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old: 
Had they but their time to live over again. 
They freely would give up their gold. 
Chorut 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard, 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in heaps, 
And with it don't know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin, 
His family from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. 
Ch,ortta. 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er , 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If to-day you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're cosey and warm and not out in the storm, 
And you see a 
friend naked and bare;-  
Oh ne'er let him pass by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give him a 
share.

YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TRUE. 
Written by MANNIE FRIEND. 
Dedicated to THEODORE ALLEN, Esq. 
Copyrighted by B. W. 
HITCHCOCK, 1881, 166 Nassau Street, New York. 
Sent by Mail on receipt of 40 cents. 
Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, 
1 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
For the sake of the past and the love you once bore me, 
Oh 'twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching, 
A. voice in my heart pleads in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
Cuoitus, 
'Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but for you? 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken. 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
But my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whate'er unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. 
(Chorus)

Good-Bye, Lovely -Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus WILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLARD, 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my 
girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thin'- of you 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, &c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Wily I 
can only say— 
Good-bye. dike.

Parody on Full Moons, 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sang with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps., 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square. 
meals: 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catehed they make 'em sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police fcr to sleep in the Station House.

As sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broad.

Price 10 cts. 
Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel, 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud if 
shabby genteel. 
A 
time was when swells who met me would say, 
! 
Harry, my boy, come and dine," 
But now when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline. 
CHORUS. 
Though poverty daily looks in at my door; 
I'm hungry, I'm foot- sore and 
I 
can look this whole world in the face and can say, 
If I'm poor,

Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse which a 
lady had dropped; 
The temptation to keeii it was strong, 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own, come what will. 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said,

The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will euffice to an ordinary under.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
t..) meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Manyeyoung ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
desti --nt4too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening partiee e .
