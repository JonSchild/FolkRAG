RECORDING TRIP March 31- June 14, 1939 John A. Lomax accompanied by Ruby Terrill
Lomax (Mrs. John A.)
We left Port Aransas, where we had spent the winter months, on March 31. At Aransas
Pass, on the mainland, we unboxed and loaded into our Plymouth the fine almost-new
recording machine, microphone, stand and converter, leaving the two heavy batteries to
be shipped directly to Houston by express. Then we headed for Austin wheere we knew a
mechanic who could check the machine to be sure all parts were there and working.
On April 4 we arrived at Houston, which we made headquarters for the next two weeks.
The engagement that set the date for this trip was a performance of a Sacred Drama,
The Good Thief, about which Sister Joan of Arc of the Our Lady of the Lake College
had written us. It was to be presented on Easter Sunday, April 9, at Guadalupe Church,
Houston, by a group of Mexican Texans led by the Gozalo Lopez Family of Sugarland.
With the help of Sister Mary Dolores an appointment to record the choral parts of this
drama was arranged for the afternoon of April 9. Unfortunately after two of the choruses
had been recorded something went wrong with the machine; there being no electrician
at call on Sunday afternoon, the recording had to be postponed and a date was set for a
meeting at the Sugarland home of the Lopez family.
John B. Jones of 1912 Kipling St., Houston, and of Hollywood, California was a student of
John A. Lomax at the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College. He became interested
in folk songs and was very helpful in bringing in folk materials. This interest he has kept.
At his home in Houston on April 10 Mr. Lomax recorded old tunes with words, some texts
incomplete, of songs that Mr. Jones had learned from various sources. His mother, Mrs.
Kate W. Jones, who had come to Texas from Mississippi in 1868, also knew and recorded
several fragments, mostly children's songs.

catch the singing parts of THE GOOD THIEF. (See Introduction by Sister M. Dolores).
The family had inte rupted their rehearsing for the evening performance of the drama to
record for us. The Lopezes were introduced to us by Sister Mary Dolores. She herself we
had met by correspondence through Sister Joan of Arc of Our Lady of the Lake College,
San Antonio Texas. Sister Joan of Arc had previously assisted Mr. Lomax (John A.) in
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
his search for folk songs around San Antonio. Early in the spring she had written that
an interesting religious drama, THE GOOD THIEF, would be presented in Spanish by
the Lopez family on Easter Sunday at the Guadalupe Church; Sister Mary Dolores of
Providence Home would assist us. Mr. Lomax arranged to meet the singers of the choral
parts of the drama at Providence Home at three o'clock on Easter Sunday. Sister Dolores
furnished him with an introductory sketch, a full text of the choral parts in Spanish and an
English translation of them.
The presenting of this play, MORIR EN LA CRUZ CON CRISTO, oDIMAS EL BUEN
LADRON, is traditional with the Lopez family beginning with their elders in Mexico. It
occurred to some one of the family, Lorenza Lopez, some fifty years ago that the drama
would be more effective if the lyrical parts were sung. As Sister M. Dolores has set down
in her introduction, Lorenza Lopez approached an old school teacher in Coahuila, Lorenzo
Flores, then a recluse, who, after pray- ing over the matter for several days, set the verses
to tunes which he taught the Lopez family. These tunes have been handed down from
generation to generation of the Lopez family without written music. The discs which John
A. Lomax has deposited in the Archive of American Folk Song in the Library of Congress
are their first permanent form.
On Easter Sunday, in Providence Home, after two of the seven songs had been recorded,
the machine broke down. As no mechanic could be found on Easter Sunday further
recording had to be postponed. The Lopez family is a busy, thr ifty farming family who live
at Sugarland a few miles west of Sugarland. Two weeks later, on April 23, we set up the
recording machine on batteries in the living-room of the Gonzalo Lopez farm home. There
Mr. Lomax recorded not only the seven songs of the drama, THE GOOD THIEF, but also
the following secular folk songs of the Mexican border: Moldita la ilusion La vida de los
arrieros Yo ya me voy- -(which Mr. Lopez had used as his courting song)
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez have twelve children, eleven of whom arranged themselves about the
room where the machine was set, the singers and the microphone being in the kitchen. Mr.

Lopez' brother, Cleofe, from Sugarland assisted, Mrs. Lopez and the daughters singing
the women's parts. The daughter who was not present is a Sister in a convent, a teacher.
One daughter is employed in nearby Sugarland; the other children who are large enough
or who are not in school assist with the farmwork.
When we drove from Houston, our headquarters, out to the Lopez farm to make the
appointment for the recording, we found Mr. Lopez busy in the field, while Mrs. Lopez,
having just finished a large family laundry, was preparing to go to the field. She apologized
further for her late start, explaining that she had to do something extra for one of the small
children who was sick. Much of this conversation was carried on in pantomime, as Mrs.
Lopez knows little English and the Lomax pair knew less Spanish. Mr. Lopez and the
children of school age, of course, speak English. The members of the family are all devout
members of the Catholic Church, highly respected in the community for their thrift and
dependability.

The Lopez Family- -Choral parts of a religious drama in Spanish, THE GOOD THIEF, or
On the Cross with Christ
Introduction by Sister Mary Dolores, Providence Home, Convent of Our Lady of
Guadalupe, 2410 Anne St., Houston Texas
In my effort to gather some information concerning the music used in the drama, "To Die
on the Cross with Christ", or "The Good Thief", I was told that the music was arranged
about fifty years ago by an old school teacher of General Zepeda, Coahuila, Mexico.
Lorenzo Flores is the name of this teacher. He lived a retired life without mixing with the
world. When this drama was studied by the seniors of the Lopez family, not having any
music for the songs used, they went to this Lorenzo Flores and he, reading the words,
meditated for a while in his secluded abode and presemtly brought the melody to the
director of the drama. He was asked, then, to teach it to the group of actors, for there were
not written notes, and the Lopez family learned iy. From that time on it has been handed
down to the actual date through memory and tradition by the Lopez family, since the music
has never been printed.
When this drama was presented in Guadalupe Church, 2405 Navigation Ave., Houston,
Texas, on Easter Sunday evening, April 9, 1939, the following singers rendered the seven
songs which occur at intervals throughout the spoken text of the drama: Cleofe Lopez,
Jose Lopez, Gonzalo Lopez, Rafaela Lopez, Paula Lopez, and Eulalia Martinez. The
singers live at Sugarland, Texas, about twenty-five miles from Houston.

We were spending a few days at the Varner Plantation, owned by Mike Hogg and other
members of the distinguished Hogg family, the plantation having been bought by the
former Governor Jim Hogg and developed by his sons, Will and Mike. It lies near West
Columbia-Texas
On Saturday, April 15, we drove over to Clemens State Farm, a few miles away to arrange
for a meeting with "the boys", Negro convits stationed on the farm. On Saturday the boys
who were working near headquarters were hauling dirt, grading, clearing ditches and
otherwise improving the grounds around a new brick and steel dormitory. A group of ditch-
diggers was working in time to the musical calls of the leader. We arranged to return to
make records on the next day, Sunday, and returned to West Columbia to rent batteries
for power, the dormitory being wired for DC current.
When we arrived at the farm the next day, the boys were ready for us. Mechanics from
the white convicts who had quarters on the second floor helped adjust the machinery.
The barber and the dentist furnished counter attractions, but our 'show' gave the boys
greater diversion. Gradually, after suggest ions from Mr. Lomax as to what kind of music
he wished to record, musicians and singers volunteered or were pushed forward by their
companions. Some of the boys, Ace Johnson and Smith Cason for examples, already
had had experience before the microphone,sine they were sometimes used on the
programs called "Behind the Walls", broadcast from the Huntsville, Texas Penitentiary on
Wednesday nights. After two hours we stopped for lunch, we being served with the white
guards, and after lunch we worked an hour or so until the time came for base-ballpractice
and preaching services.

Ramsey State Farm, Camp 4, Otey, Texas
April 23, 1939
After we had recorded the choral parts of the religious drama, The Good Thief, at the
home of the Lopez family on a arm near Sugarland, Texas, we drove to the Central
State Farm near Sugarland. The Captain had a good dinner served us and assisted
Mr. Lomax in trying to locate singers. In previous years Central Farm had "entertained"
such singers as Clear Rock and Iron Head, who had made recordings. But this trip was
fruitless. The old crowd had scattered, the new boys sang less fewer of the old songs and
in performance imitated radio artists. We did not set up the machine. We found about the
same situation at the Darrington Farm some thirty miles away,- few singers and these not
interested in old songs or the old manner of singing.
Our next stop was at Camp Four of the Ramsey State Farm, where most of the habituals
and incorrigibles stay.. With the help of the Captain and some of his guards we located
some singers, who were admitted one by one or by small groups into a small office where
the recording machine was set up. InOne of these groups included Columbus Christopher,
Alexander Hamilton and George Washington,-who sang for us under guard, behind three
sets of locks. Just outside this office we could look down on the dormitory room, where
Negro convicts were playing cards, reading, talking, singing blues, listening to an exhorter,
sleeping. One boy was standing on a barrel as punishment for some minor violation of
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
rules. We saw the boys go in to supper, in a line, both hands on the shoulders of the man
in front of him.
Among the boys whom we found there was Iron Head (James Baker) now back "in the
line", old and broken, assigned to the garden squad. He had been paroled from Central
Farm by Governor Allred, but after a few months he was sent back for burglary,- "po'ch-
climbin'". At first he was shy and stayed in the background, as if ashamed for Mr. Lomax,
who had petitioned for his parole, to find him in worse case, no longer even a trusty. But
finally he came forward, either drawn by love of music or by "pride of profession",- for he
had made many beautiful recordings for the Lomaxes and after his parole was granted
he had traveled with Mr. John Lomax through the South on a recording trip. Impatiently
Iron Head broke into a group's singing of some popular music-hall ditty, "No he don't
want that kind o' stuff. This is kindly what he's after", and he started off on an old-time
spiritual. Later he recorded it: "This heart o' mine, God's goin' save this heart o' mine,
"with this remarkable stanza: Mary had one virgin son, She rocked Him in the cradle of
number one. Another of his spirituals, "Elder, will you march down to Jordan?" includes
this couplet: Religion is somethin' like a bloomin' rose: None can tell that doesn't know.
Iron Head claims his nickname from this story: One day when he was cutting timber, a big
tree caught him and one of its largest limbs struck him down across the head The limb
broke in two, but Iron Head shook it off and went on back to work.
Two boys claimed the nickname of the famous "Stavin' Chain"; they compromised by
accepting the amended names, "Big Stavin' Chain" and "Little Stavin' Chain". Another
boy was called claimed "Jaybird", from his physical appearance. It was customary to set
down nicknames of singers along with their names, which caused some embarrassment
at Ramsey. In routine manner, "What is your name?" asked Mrs. Lomax of one of the
singers. He gave it readily. "Your nickname?" No reply, just a shuffling of feet. "Haven't
you a nickname?" Again a shuffling of feet, and then hesitatingly: "Dey calls me Monkey."
A swift glance at the boy's features stopped the usual "How did you get that nickname?"
Library of Congress

Mrs. Lomax changed to an embarrassed and especially cordial "Thank you." Supper with
the white guards closed our day at Ramsey.

Manuela Longoria Jose Suarez ("Blind Jose") Children of Blalack School Mrs. Henry
Krausse, Dolores Royes, Tito Crixell, Henry Delgado
Judge Hobart Davenport introduced us to Miss Manuela Longoria, teac her of a suburban
grade school where the pupils are all of Mexican families. Miss Long oria herself is
well-educated She is always helpful with the annual "Charro Festival" in training the
school children for their parts. Miss Longoria's own songs we recorded in her home in
Brownsville, where she lives with an older sister who does not yet speak English. Miss
Longoria's songs are traditional, most of them from her mother and her father. The Blalack
School children sang us the songs that they use at play in their own homes. It is interesting
that when Mrs. Lomax asked them how to spell certain titles they shook their heads,
saying that they could not spell Spanish words. Their written and spoken school work is all
done in the English language.
Atanacio Hernandez, a Mexican farmer came to the school house to sing old songs
which he is thought to know, but due to timidity, perhaps, before his own children or the
microphone, he sang only Nicero Leon, a tragic narrative of the "head-hunting of a man
who was afraid of nothing but God", according to Miss Longoria's interpretation.

Jose Suarez was introduced to John A. Lomax by J.K.Wells. J. K. Wells is the son of
Jim Wells,who for many years was very influential politically and socially in "the Valley".
There is a Jim Wells County in Texas, and Jim Wells was for many years "boss" of the
SSpanish-speaking people along the border. His son, J.K.Wells, is a successful lawyer
and businessman in Brownsville, himself a friends to Mexicans in need. Blind Jose
recorded his songs iin the Wells home.
Jose became blind at the age of ten months and makes his living singing and playing his
guitar on the streets, at da ces and in drinking halls. He goes everywhere about the city
with the aid of a cane. He has a wide repertoire of Mexican and Spanish songs and tunes;
in fac t he says he does not know how many he can sing, since new ons pop into his head
every day that he has not thought of for years. He keeps up with the popular songs, but he

likes best the old local and occasional ballads,- about exciting events that have happened
in the border country. Mr. Wells comments at this point:
"Whenever, in the old days, anything exciting happened, a poet made verses about it
and distributed the composition as a broadside. Musicians made up the air or tune for
the verses. Prisoners leaving on boats would make u make up verse accounts of their
experiences,- accounts of their crimes, etc., and sell them on the streets or from the boat."
See also comments on songs as listed, for special circumstances from which each song
arose.
Mr. Wells could not be so rude as to ask Jose his age. Instead, he asked in Spanish:
"Jose, when did you cut your eye-teeth?" To this Jose replied, "Forty-three years ago."

LA VIDA.
Esta vida es un misterio, Una ilusión vaporosa, Una vereda escabrosa Que conduce al
Cementerio.
¿Quß significa vivir En este mundo engañoso, Que de nada sirve el gozo Cuando es
preciso morir? En la nada va a concluir Tomándolo bien de serio, Que aunque sea un
gran imperio Viene a quedar en la nada. . . Hablando en verdad sagrada, Esta vida es un

Si acaso hay un "más allá," No lo veremos, por cierto, Porque ya despußs de muerto De
nada nos servirá. Es posible que lo habrá, Según mi creencia dudosa, Y si de algo allá se/
goza, Ir allá a gozar conviene, Porque aquí, solo se tiene Una ilusión vaporosa.
Y si el destino es morir, ¿Quß vale el haber nacido? Desde luego está perdido Todo
nuestro porvenir. Se ve que todo es sufrir, Que esta vida es muy penosa Aunque a la vista
es preciosa Nos encanta el batallar Y por fin, va uno a encontrar Una vereda escabrosa.
Todo está asi decretado Por la mano del Creador: Hay que sufrir con rigor Lo que ya está
sentenciado. Cada quien ve por su lado Y resiste al intemperio; Es duro, penoso y serio,
Hay que verlo con despecho: Es un camino derecho Que conduce al Cementerio. Por

with guitar . . . Sung in the home of J.K.WellsBr ownsville, Tex. April 26, 1939 Mr. Wells
comments: : "Prior to 1904, the date of the first railroad in this part of the country, there
was a general exodus of Mexicans picking cotton from Brownsville to Mississippi and
beyond. They moved north as cotton matured, then walked back. Due to the boll weevil
cotton prices were low and therefore so were cotton-picking wages. After the railroad
came in, the contract system was intoduced,-that is, contrac tors loaded their groups
onto the trains,-and trooping by foot ceased." This song of, five stanzas of which are
here recorded, was pr obably made or started in Gonzales, so Jose thinks. It opens with
the father's advice to his young son.. Later: "When money was good, I bought chickens,
cows, horses, etc., but at forty cents a hundred, Iam very poor, and I walk the streets of
Laredo like a deaf mule." Jose Suarez is a blind street singer, who makes his way about
Brownsville unaided except for his cane. He is a skillful guitar picker and has a wide
repertoire of all kinds of Mexican and Spanish songs.

Mrs Edward Lasater of Falfurrias told us about the fiddler, Mr. Lake N. Porter, a champion
in his earlier days. He was born in Mississippi, and is (in 1939) 85 years old. He is a
charter member of the Texas Old Trail Drivers Association. He went up the trail three
or four times, often sawing his fiddle as he rode along. For a long time he discontinued
playing the fiddle and singing, but he has taken it up again recently, and now "he doesn't
do anything else all day long", so his wife reports. The couple celebrated their sixtieth
wedding anniversary last December (1938). They live in a comfortable cottage with
their own garden and chickens. Their daughter lives across the street and a son, who
holds a responsible position with a power company in the East, flies down to see them

much pleasure by recording the fiddle tunes and to enquire whether he might get copies
of the records. Mr. and Mrs. Porter were very much pleased to be "invited out" to a public
restaurant for dinner. Mr. Porter was for fifteen years sheriff in Goliad County, Texas and
in the county where he now lives, during some exciting days of that country. He lived in
McMullen County when he was a cowboy and trail-driver. Black Jack Grove is his favorite
fiddle tune.
During their days of work around Falfurrias Mr. and Mrs. Lomax were guests at the ranch
of Mrs. Ed Lasater, of which her son Tom Lasater is manager. Her son Edward, county

old, born in Miss., is a charter member of the Texas Old Trail Drivers Association.. He
went up the trail three or four times, often sawing his fiddle as he rode along. For a long
time he discontinued playing the fiddle and singing but has taken it up again recently and
now "he doesn't do anything else all day long", so his wife reports The couple celebrated
their sixtieth wedding anniversary last December. Mr. Porter was fifteen years sheriff, in
Goliad Co., and in the county where he now lives. He lived in Mc Mullen Co. when he was
a cowboy and trail-driver. Text not complete nevermore roam, I wish I was married and
livin' at home. As a boy I was reared in a beautiful home, But the taste of red liquor caused
me to roam; But now I'm an outcast and destined to roam Because of red liquor I've ruined
my home. I've traveled the country from Texas to Maine; I've drunk old red liquor and
sometimes champagne. And now I'm an outcast and destined to roam, But I'll eat when I'm
hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry, If a tree don't fall on me, I'll live till I die. I'll play my old fiddle
and rosin my bow, And I'll make myself welcome whenever I go. My parents they begged
me from whiskey to abstain, But the taste of red liquor with me did remain. And now I'm an
outcast and destined to roam, Because of red liquor I've ruined my home. Coe all ye young
men, take warning from me, Be a modest user of whiskey. For overindulgence will cause
you to roam, Too much of red liquor will ruin your home.

28-30, 1939 Frank Goodwyn
Miss Frances Alexander, professor of English at the College of Arts and Industries at
Kingsville, Texas, first told us about Frank Goodwyn. He was at that time a student of
the college interested in the study of English literature, in music and how to write English
compositions. We were told that Mr. Goodwyn was surprised to learn that music had
a notation by which it could be written down. He lost no time in setting down on paper
some of the tales that he had heard all his life; for he was brought up on the King Ranch,
where his father was once a foreman and where Frank himself had learned the arts of
the cowboy. there he had learned the many tales current among the Vaqueros and the
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
English-speaking cowhands, and he had also picked up their traditional and local ballads
and dance tunes. He learned to play the fiddle and the guitar with enough skill to give
himself, his family and friends some pleasure and amusement. He is a distant cousin of J.
Frank Dobie and through his friends of the College faculty and through Mr. Dobie Frank's
written versions of Mexican Border tales came to the attention of the Texas Folk Lore
Society, in whose publications Mr. Goodwyn's tales and song texts appear. In 1940 Mr.
Goodwyn is instructor in English and graduate student at the C and I College.
At the time the Lomaxes met him, Mr. Goodwyn was married and was teaching in the La
Gloria School, a rural school in a Mexican community, near Falfurrias, Texas. There we
found him and arranged a meeting.
Many of his songs Mr. Goodwyn learned from his mother and from Blind Eddie,
fiddler, who used to hang around Mr. Goodwyn's uncle's country store. Many tunes he
learned from cowboys, but often he had to get full texts later from books, such as the
Lomax:Cowboy Songs. One night he played for two hours in our tourist camp room, mostly
American cowboy songs and "funny" songs that he had learned from his m mother. We
found that he knew a great many "concert hall" and other popular songs that had been
printed for sheet music sale. The next day, being Saturday, he took us to Sarita, Texas on
the edge of the great Kennedy Ranch. We were searching especially for a certain Mexican
feud ballad which a blind store-keeper in Sarita knew. Mr. Goodwyn had formerly taught
school there and knew all the boys. Mr. Lopez, proprietor was not in; but other musicians
were around, and so we set up the machine on a store-counter. Manuel Salinas consented
to second Mr. Goodwyn with the guitar, and they played Chinese Breakdown.
This was the usual bare, dusty, poorly equipped general merchandise Mexican store. One
glance around took in a few cotton dresses, bandanas, belts, dried oranges, boxes of salt,
sheet-iron stove, a dozen Irish potatoes, a few cans of milk, tobacco, an old phonograph,
bottles of patent medicine with faded labels, a pair of rlk horns, a dusty violin.
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
After a while Mr. Lopez, blind poet and musician, came in. He acknowledged that he knew
the ballad, "Don Benefacio e Don Coy", but he refused to sing it into the microphone on
the grounds that it was unworthy literature, and he would not degrade himself by going on
record with it. He was perfectly willing to declame or sing his own compositions.
He refused even to repeat or to write out the words of such a lowly ballad, but finnaly
Mr. Goodwyn, taking him aside, persuaded Mr. Lopez to whisper the words to him, and
in trying to recall the words in spots he hummed the tune two or three times. This was
sufficient for Mr. Goodwyn's quick ear and retentive memory; from this humming he
caught the tune, practiced the song with his guitar over night, and sang the ballad into the
microphone the next day.
The ballad gives the story of a feud between two bad gunmen, one of whom lived in a
camp a few miles below Falfurrias. In the fight in 1900 both men were killed.
Another interesting vaquerim ballad, The Purple Bull, Mr. Goodwyn learned from Manuel
Hervandez of La Changa cow camp. It is the story, perhaps embroidered, of Manuel's
own adventure with a real bull, composed by Nigel La Luna The words and melody are
published in a volume of Southwestern Lore: Folk Lore on the King Ranch.
The Wet Back, another Mexican Ballad of the Border, was sung and played at Sarita
by Omero Lopez and Manuel Salinas. The text is not complete, as the boys could not
remember all of it. The wet-back is a Mexican who has come across the Rio Grande River
into the United States without required credentials. This ballad tells of some of his trials.
Allegedly he is called Wet-back because he leaves the wet Rio Grande behind him as he
faces the dry streams of Texas.
Comment from Lomax note-book on Sarita trip: "75 miles travel, 2 hours talk, 1 folk song
with a possible lead to another."

On the evening of May 3 Elmo Newcomer recorded fiddle tunes and words in his home
on the San Antonio-Bandera road, near Pipe Creek. He has he reputation of being the
best dance caller in the county; the next night, while his wife attended a Pipe Creek
school trustees meeting he and the children came to the Lomax tourist cabin, where C. W.
Saathoff, fiddler, and J. O. Evans, guitarist, played for his calls, using the tune WAGNER.
For fuller account of Mr. Newcomer and family, see notes to his recordings. His Rye
Whiskey, known in some parts as Drunken Hiccups, is famous in the "Hill Country" of
Texas. His son, Bill Newcomer, later sent additional dance calls used by his father.
On the afternoon of May 4 Mr. Saathoff and Mr. Evans recorded their rendition of the Fox
and Hounds, with Charles Eckhardt blowing the horn and calling the dogs; using an old-
fashioned cow-horn which he had polished himself and had used on his ranch for many
years. He recorded other ranch calls made with this horn. These men are all Hill Country"
ranchmen (sheep). Mr. Eckhardt is a skilful tanner, leather-tooler, hunter, fisherman. When
he visited the Lomaxes' cabin he was wearing his "new" buckskin shirt, which he had
shot, dressed, treated and sewed himself, and which he had been wearing five years.
He has a complete Indian outfit which he made by the same process. At Bandera County
celebrations he assists the director, Mr. Hunter, by exhibiting his treasures and shooting
arrows and otherwise "playin' Injun".
On May 5 Mr Lomax called on Mrs. Fletcher Layton at her home near Medina in Bandera.
Mrs. Layton is chairman of the National Music Week celebration in Bandera Co. She
assisted Mr. Lomax in interviewing singers. At the home of Beal D. Taylor recordings were
made by mr. Taylor, E. A. Briggs and Mr. and Mrs. Braley See notes on records, and texts.

mother died when he was four. He has "always" played these tunes and is a favorite
caller at dances. His Rys Whiskey with antics is a general favorite at fiddle contests. Mrs.
Newcomer is a member of the school trustees of Pipe Creek.
His gr eting to Mr. Lomax was "Shake, boy. I8ve heared about you all my life. Me an' a

in the home of Judge and Mrs. Oscar Callaway, at the Callaway Ranch, Comanche Co.,
Texas, of children's songs and lullabiesb which she learned in her childhood from the
singing of her mother, Mrs. Bess Brown Lomax. Mrs. Lomax learned many of these songs
from her mother who came to Texas from Virginia. Mrs. Mansell sings these songs to her
own two little girls. She is the daughter of John A. Lomax, who made the recordings.
Mrs. Mansell's songs are scattered over several different discs.: 2590, 2591, 2631, 2633,

ALL THE PRETTY LITTLE HORSES
Shirley Lomax Mansell, who writes the following note, not only speaks for herself here,
but for practically every other Southern girl who has ever been rocked to sleep or who
has ever sung to her own babies. For "All the Pretty Little Horses" can be found in the
repertoire of every southern family, Negro and white; it is the classic of southern lullabies.
It is sung in a thousand different ways by as many singers; the "pretty little horses" may
be "blacks and bays" or "dapples and greys" but, whatever their color, they have carried
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
almost every southern child off to sleep at one time or another. Here is what Shirley says
about the way the song was sung in our family:
All the Pretty Little Horses is a family song. There is not a time when I do not remember
it. I am sure it was Grandmother Brown's song; from our mother it now belongs to her four
children. Grandmother did not often sing anything but hymns, and those mostly on Sunday
afternoons when she rocked back and forth in her little straight, cane-bottomed rocker,
alone in her room. Grandmother did not believe that on Sunday people should do anything
but attend Sunday School, then church, then read the Bible until time to go to evening
services. Her disapproval of our Sunday afternoon walks, when the children from all the
neighborhood gathered to explore the woods, or "walk through to the Dam", caused her to
shut herself into her room and rock and sing, and I am sure, pray for forgiveness for us all.
Her lips would shut into a thin line, and her eyes fill with tears.
But Grandmother Brown loved babies, and she sang to us all, and rocked us, hours and
hours, in that same little chair. All the Pretty Little Horses is a wonderful lullaby. The
phrases can be changed, a line or two of hums can be put in at will instead of the words,
at will, and the baby drifts off into sleep, floating with the little horses the song blends with
the squeak of the rocker and the pat of the foot on the rug. The horrible verse about the
"bees and the butterflies" was not sung in our house, and should never be used- -what
baby could sleep with such a pitiful and ghastly picture stamped into his dreamy little soul?
I still sing it to my girls when they are ill, but they always request that that verse not be
sung. And I don't blame them."
Dorothy Scarborough in her book On the Trail of Negro Folk-Songs says that this is one of
the lullabies Negro Mammies sang to their little white charges.

May 9, 1939
No recordings were made in Austin. The machine was tested by an electrician and radio
man.
Alex Moore, cowboy singer, and members of the Gant Family, mountain ballad singers,
could not be found.
Mrs. Clark, matron of a boys' dormitory at the Texas School for the Blind, was not at home
when we called. She talked with Mr. Lomax by telephone and promised to send him the
titles and texts of some folk songs handed down in her family. Her name was suggested to
us by her brother, Professor Bass, of the Texas College of Arts and Industries, Kingsville,
Texas.
From the School for the Blind we drove on to Taylor, Texas in search of "Clear Rock".
Section 11: Taylor, Texas; May 10
JAS'39 Recording trip Taylor, Texas.
Mose Platt ("Clear Rock") May, 1939.
About "fust dark" of a May evening Mr. Lomax stopped his car on the outskirts of Taylor,
Texas and enquired of some Negores, who were sitting on their cabin stoop, whether
they knew "Clear Rock," a singin' Negro who had been released recently from the state
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
penitentiary. They did not know "Clear Rock," but Mr. Lomax's description fitted a fellow
called "Wyandotte" (pronounced "Winedot") who usually hung around a barber shop on
the other side of the railroad. An eat-shop Negro confirmed the belief that Clear Rock and
Winedot were one and the same Negro, namely Mose Platt. Now Clear Rock on earlier
recording trips had been one of the most fruitful sources of Negro stories and songs,
especially work-songs and other secular songs. And so the search was on: on the promise
of a dime a boy conducted us to Clear Rock's home, only to hear from neighors that Clear
Rock and his wife had been seen going up the tracks towards town just ten minutes ago;
twenty-five cents was to be the reward for bringing him to our hotel. No word had come
by breakfast time, and so Mr. Lomax started out afoot in earch. When he returned to the
hotel two hours later, there he found Clear Rock, sitting on the running board of the Lomax
automobile; with him was his two-hundred-fifty pound wife, his "seventeen wife," as he told
Mrs. Lomax later. They had been waiting at the car from six o'clock. The wife, looming too
large for our small hotel room, was dismissed with breakfast money.
Clear Rock himself was ready and willing to do anything the "boss" asked, except to
stop talking. To unwind him somewhat, Mr. Lomax let him record some stories first. The
two had met previously at Central State Farm, wherein John A. and Alan Lomax made
some recordings. But Mr. Lomax wished to re-record some of the Negro's best songs
with the improved machine. At first Clear Rock was slow at entering into the spirit of
the old work-songs, "disremembering" the words of some of them, because perhaps
of two circumstances: Clear Rock was now "The Reverend Mose Platt," devoted to
hymns and spirituals, and what secular songs he indulged in were mostly modern jazz,
sung for the entertainment of his white friends. But Mr. Lomax's cajoling words and a
substantial contribution to the next Sabbath's collection helped Clear Rock to overcome
his handicaps, and he was off. For four hours he told stories and sang and preached and
prayed.
Clear Rock's "off the record" stories are rich in themselves. He is on relief, but occasionally
gets an extra tip for services around the county Court House and the Post Office. He
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
complains that "relief hardly dont give us nothin' to eat except grape-fruit." And his
pastorate does not pay much, though he has added four women to his board of deacons
"to take keer o' de money, 'cause de mens mought take de collections and lose 'em all
at playin' craps." He claims to be well and strong physically; "de doctor health man says
I aint got a sickness nowhere; he says my whole body is as clean as de pa'm o' your
hand." Asked about his release from the penitentiary, he explained: "One day some o'
my white friends in Taylor heard dat Miss Ferguson (Gov. Miriam Ferguson) was goin' to
be down at Central a-visitin; and they sont a car down there wid a letter signed by thirty
thousand peoples; they was de names o' all de promnent layers an' officers an' all the
other whichocrats around Taylor, and Miss Ferguson let me go free."
When Clear Rock first returned to Taylor after his release he solicited contributions from
his white friends, presenting the following plea; evidently dictated by him.
"We certifies that we knows Mose Platt and that he has been up to this time a good hardly
working man. He is sick and his wife is sick, he is unemployed and aint got no job, and not
able to demand no job whatever and his doctor is Mr. Doaks and Doaks, and the judge

Bryan and College Station, Texas
May 10,11,1939
As we drove through Texas we were on the lookout for rural and village Negro schools,
where we might record game songs. These are nearly all short-term schools and they had
closed for the summer. The Dean of the Prairie View College, state college for Negroes,
had referred us to the county supervisor of Negro schools with headquarters at Bryan,
Texas. We stopped at Bryan to confer with her. She conducted us to a rural school still
in session, with only seven pupils in attendance that day, the school being scheduled to
close the next day with a community gathering. The pupils played and sang "Little Sallie
Walker" and "Seed tick's a-bitin' me", but most of their games were copies of the white
children's. We did not set up our machine.
We spent the night at "Aggieland", an inn maintained by the Texas Agricultural and
Mechanical College (Texas Aggies). Our machine needed adjustment, for which we called
on an Aggie instructor, William Owens, who has had much experience with recording
machine while collecting folk materials in the South with a machine furnished by the
University of Iowa, in which institution he is pursuing graduate. Mr. Owens is also an

Hattie Ellis is a blues singer who is very popular on the radio program sent out from the

for killing a man. Another Dallas, Texas Negro girl who "come visitin' in Arkansas and got
took up for somethin' I didn't do", told us that Hattie wouldn't have got such a long term if
she hadn't sassed the judge when he brought her boot-legging activities into the murder
case. Hattie's singing is fast becoming "throaty" as she strives to imitate the professional
"blues" singers.
Later-Fall 1940: Officials of the Old Fiddlers Contest, held annually at Athens, Texas,
announced that Hattie Ellis would not keep her engagement to sing with the group of
musicians from the State Penitentiary, because she had recently been paroled and was
back at home in Dallas.

May 15, 1939
Reverend J. R. Gipson, "Blind Gipson", was introduced by H. R. Weaver. He is a well-
known Negro Baptist evangelist who supplements his sermons with the singing of "jazzed"
spirituals, playing his own accompaniment on the piano. His loud chords topped by loud,
husky singing, made an interesting combination, but one difficult to record. Some spirituals
he sang without piano accompaniment. His wife and two neighbor children came with him
to the Weaver home, where the recordings were made. They assisted him with some of
the spirituals, and the children sang two game songs. Though Rev. Gipson makes his
home in Louisiana he is pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church at Buna, Texas.

Alan Lomax had urged us to go back to see Henry Truvillion and get all he had this time.
We found that an order impossible to fill, so versatile is he and so varied his experiences.
It was Henry Truvillion, then, and Mr. H. R. Weaver of Merryville, La., across the Texas
line, that took us to East Texas.
We made Newton our headquarters for sleeping. We found Henry Truvillion's farm home
on the main highway between Newton and Burkeville, closer to Burkeville though Newton,
R. F. D., is his postoffice.
A few miles our from Newton we saw a neat white schoolhouse with Negro children
playing in the yard. Several little girls were singing a ring game. We stopped and watched,
looked up the principal and asked to interview the children about songs. The principal
quickly understood our mission and soon had the entire school assembled in the largest of

Wiergate is the headquarters of the Wier Lumber Company, which employs many Negro
workmen. While we were waiting to see some the Wier officials, we drove over to "the
quarters", or Negro settlement; on the school grounds we saw a group of small girls
circling around and singing. We could not catch the words. Recess was soon over. As
the children were marching in, Mrs. Lomax asked one of the girls what they were playing.
"Seed-tick", she replied. With the permission of the principal and his wife, Mr. and Mrs.
Mack, an assembly was called. The same group of little girls sang and played Seed-tick
into the microphone. This was followed by others in rapid succession before the buses
came to take the children to their home:

Herman R. Weaver
Mrs. Alan Lomax had told us that her uncle Herman Weaver knew many old songs
and that he also knew all the old Negroes in that part of the country, ha ing been a
representative for many years of lumber companies that had flourished there at the height
of their prosperity. We therefore presented ourselves to Mr. Weaver, who offered us the
hospitality of his home and helped us in every possible way to find singers. We used his
home as our "studio". Mr. Weaver himself recorded two songs: one of special interest is
the ox-driving song which he had heard his father sing. He could not recall all the stanzas
for the recording, but later he sent into the Library of Congress the full text as it appears in
Our Singing Country (John A. and Alan Lomax).

Henry Truvillion R#1, Newton, Texas- -May 16, 18, 1939
"Yessir, I knows you", said Henry Truvillion as he greeted Mr. Lomax on the porch of his
East Texas farmhouse. "You come here once with your son. Yessir, I got your letter, but I
didn't see no use to answer, 'cause everything's changed now; I done took to preachin'. I
don't sing none o' them songs like you want no more."
"Don't you work at Wiergate any more?" "Oh, yessir, I works on a week days and I
preaches on Sundays, first an' third Sundays." "And you quit singing those pretty work
songs and calls?" "Oh, no, sir, they's part o' my business. I has to call de track an' all dat
to git de work done. But them others, them old-fashioned plantation melods, I done had
a complete change an' I don't sing dat kind no more. Us sings spirituals now, an' church
hymns,- short meter, yessir, common meter an' long meter, mostly long meter."
It was late afternoon, almost dusk, "fust dark". Henry was exhausted. He and his family
had just returned from the funeral of his wife's sister-in-law, her brother's wife who had left
a tiny baby girl for the Truvillions to "tend". There had been sleepless nights of sitting up,
with the sick woman and then with her lifeless body, and everybody was exhausted further
by the long exciting funeral service.
And so Mr. Lomax did not press Henry Truvillion to promise him "worl'ly" songs, but let
him relax in the cool of the front porch and ramble quietly from snatches of spirituals to
comment and miniature sermon.
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
"'When de roll be's called in Heaven', dat's one o' my favorites," he began. "Dat's come
a long way down in our family. Dat's one o' old Colonel Steppin's (Stephen?), my great
grandfather on my mother's side. He used to sing it, and also my grandfather independent
back in Mississippi. Did you ever hear it? It goes 'When de roll be's called in de Heaven I'll
answer to my name'.
You see, God's got a sec'etary dat keeps a list de way folks has got to go. I don't care how
far down de (the) list my name is. In fact, I ain't homesick yet, an' he can jes' skip my name
when he comes to it."
There was no writing down the words of the song without dispelling his mood and only a
phrase here and there was caught:
"'Well, he set so high and he was so low'", and Henry commented, "He knows what
he gwine do 'fore he starts." Two other spirituals he sang before we left, Ride on,
Mighty Rider, and Shout on, Israelites. These songs he promised to try to sing into our
microphone if we would return some evening later in the week after he had caught up with
sleep and farm-work.
Henry informed Mr. Lomax that he had not spelled his name correctly on the recent letter.
"It's Truvillion, not Trevillion. My father and mother couldn't read or write and they didn't
know how to spell their name, but I looked it up in some kind o' dictionary and found it
spelled T-r-u-v-i-double l-i-o-n,- maybe a French name, somebody told me. But I reckin I
ain't no sure 'nough Frenchman, ha! ha!"
Henry Truvillion is foreman of a work gang for Wier Lumber Company, whose
headquarters are at Wiergate, Texas. He was born in Mississippi where some of his family
still live. He has been twice married. His only living child by his first wife is a man grown
who lives in
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
Mississippi. His present wife, a young woman who calls him "Mr. Henry", and five children,
from eleven years down to one in 1939, help make his home on his farm on the highway
between Newton and Burkeville, Texas, some eight miles from his work which he reaches
in his substantial-looking green Ford car. Henry thinks that East Texas lumber may play
out some day, and so he has "bought a little place to work and lay something by." He has
a neat white house of four rooms, comfortably furnished, and he and the children cultivate
vegetable garden, flowers in the front yard and an orchard. Cotton, corn and peanuts are
his best crops. He keeps a good cow and raises pigs and chickens. His mules look well-
fed.
And now, to supplement his regular Wier job and his farm, he has taken to preaching.
Some Sundays he gets as much as seven dollars from the collection plate. When we
bade him goodbye at the end of the week he requested us to send him a "Breeze-case,
to carry my Bible in to church and to Conference". His wife, Oneal, is a faithful helpmeet
in the church as well as at home. She is better educated than "Mr. Henry", and she and
the children, as they get old enough to go to school, are fast ridding Henry's vocabulary of
many of his most picturesque phrases and pronunciations. The children's names are: Jim
Henry, Ruby Lee, Garfield, Dora Ruth and Modistine.
One evening later in the week we returned and set up our machine with batteries in the
Truvillion living-room. We tried to persuade Henry to go with us to our hotel in Newton,
where we could hitch on to electricity, but he refused. He said frankly that he was afraid, -
afraid that such a visit to a white people's hotel might cause trouble for him after we were
gone.
Henry gave us his spirituals very readily. We found that his
wife served as a second line of defense for his conscience in the matter of singing "worl'ly
songs". But after she heard the spirituals played back, she made no objections to Henry's
recording his everyday work songs. Then she could see no harm in his singing the
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
inoffensive children's songs, especially when he took Ruby Lee into his lap to help with
"Mary had a red dress." Hadn't he sung her to sleep with it many a night? "From then on
out" Henry relaxed and let his mind slip back, "way back yander", to his childhood days in
Mississippi on through his varied experiences of work and amusement, prompted now and
then by a discreetly quiet but leading question from Mr. Lomax. Some of his explanations
and comments which we tried to record are as interesting as the songs. There had been
some battery trouble, calling for a trip to Wiergate for a mechanic, and midnight overtook
us with Henry still recalling fresh songs and fresh stories.
In his early childhood Henry followes the plow, cut and hauled wood, chopped and picked
cotton. But for forty years, since he was thirteen, he has worked mainly on the railroad.
The first railroad that he worked for "regular" was "the I.C. mainline". His first boss on the
I.C. was W.L. Renfrew; "For I-couldn't-hardly count-the-years, I stayed bent down with
a white man over me." He has done all kinds of railroad work in his time, and he can tell
them off on his fingers: "first, gradin' in the levee camp, now called gradin' camp; then up
an' down the river on a cotton boat, cuttin' willow an' makin' mats for holes in the levee an'
placin' 'em. Made a dollar a day cuttin' willow, a mean, tedjous job." After that he did "river
world, a little too killin'", he said. Then s ome work around town. "Spent twelve years, 'bout,
wid de shevil (shovel)". When he quit the mainline, he "went on the Northfield Lumber
Company."
For the past twenty-four years, he estimated, "or a little wusser", he has worked in East
Texas and Western Louisiana. He has worked for the Wier Lumber Company nineteen
years, "track-layin', steel-layin', (spikin'), track-linin' (straightenin')". He became lead-spiker
and later boss. He and his gang spend most of their time building temporary track for
timber-cutting gangs and timber-hauling trains.
Henry Truvillion's mind is stored with facts about his experiences, his work- and play-
mates, his bosses, from which he draws the many details of fact and incident that come
out in his songs. For a half hour at a time he can reel off names and characterstics of
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
bosses, engineers and other railroad and company officials of present and past decades.
He did not make it clear just when he helped load cotton on river-boats, but details of the
work show up in his songs that only a roustabout would know.
Texts of his songs and calls, as well as his recorded conversation, are very scrappy and
incomplete; first, because the vocabulary of gang work songs is foreign to the uninitiated,
and, again, because Henry's amazing performance fascinated his listeners and made
them forget the mundane task of writing down words.
Like many another Southern Negro Henry claimed to have "Made up" John Henry. "You
made it up yourself?" questioned Mr. Lomax. "Well, no, sir, not 'xactly by myself. Some
other boys holp me put it together."

Riley Miller (Bad Man or Hero?): Henry says that Riley Miller was not really a bad man or

Mr. Weaver brought Will Lee into Merryville from his farm home near Rose Pine, La. Will
Lee is old and worn and toothless, formerly a successful preacher, hence his nickname
"John the Baptist". In his phrases and quaint manner of singing he is as primitive as Uncle
Rich Brown of Alabama. When he heard his first song played back to him, he looked
doubtful and mystified at first, then pleased, and he exclaimed: "I called dat:" Later: "Dat
machine got better voice than me. Lost all my teef outa my mouf." When his prayer was
played back to him he commented: "It act jes' like me." Two of his phrases are especially
interesting: "Land of purple day", equally as desirable to in prospect as "land of perfect

JAL '39 Recording Trip
Varner, Arkansas
Cummins State Farm
May 20-21, 1939
Superintendent Reed of the Cummins State Farm was busy receiving new inmates,-
white men who crawled out of the "bus" under guard just as we drove up to the office.
Mr. Lomax's conference with the office was only long enough to explain his mission, and
present his letter of introduction from the Governor of Texas, get permission to proceed
and get necessary information about the location of camps and the names of some of
the captains. Captain Acklin, who, it seems was in general charge of the Negro farm
workers, offered us a bed for the night and breakfast. We went at once to Camp #6, where
Mr. Lomax had previously found some songs. There we found Captain Allen in charge,
who came riding up from his inspection of the fields and recognized Mr. Lomax at once.
Cap'n Allen had formerly been in charge of a camp near Little Rock where Mr. Lomax had
recorded previously. It was he whose wife complained that she was kept busy repairing
the right armhole of his shirts, which tore loose when he flogged the boys in the field when
they slackened work. On this occasion Captain Allen seemed glad to see somebody from
Texas and his family also seemed glad of a diversion. After a bountiful supper we, the
Lomaxes, the Allens and some guests adjourned to the Negro barracks. By the aid of
kerosene lamps and flash-lights we set up the machine. Through the bars, Mr Lomax
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
explained to the boys the purpose of his trip and what kind of songs he wished to record.
He asked for volunteers. After several rejections, big fellow timidly offered a children's
song, which proved good enough to start on anyway: Mary Mack. This Mary Mack proved
to be was entirely different from other Mary Macks, at least after "buttons up and down her
back.", and even there she had only "three or four" instead of 24.
JAL '39 Recording Trip Cummins State Farm
At any rate "Mary Mack" had opened the bars of the barracks for Willie Williams, and we
saw that he was doing his best to think up other songs that might delay his recommitment
to the barracks. "Yes, he knew other songs, but couldn't git 'em togather just then." Mr.
Lomax appealed to the other boys, "What have you boys heard him sing? Help him out
here." "Sing Jody Grand, Garmouth", one of the boys called. He grinned, nodded his head
opened his "garmouth" and sang: "Oh-oh, dey calls me Jody Grand",-a first-class mule-
driving song which Garmouth uses in the field, though it was-perhaps originated on the
levee. Garmouth said he was brought up on a farm, has a wife and one child, was given
three years and seven months for shooting a boy.
After the songs of Willie "Garmouth" Williams were played back with the announcement of
his name, other boys crowded up to the bars to offer their songs.. Blues were particularly
popular, "sorrow songs", as one of the boys called them,- Milk Cow Blues, Corn Field
Blues, Osceola Blues, Levee Cap Hollers,, even Po' Laz'us and Boll Weevil, and &
spirituals The Captain had been generous in letting us stay past nine o'clock. It was
Saturday night and the boys could catch up with their sleep the next day, but the kerosene
lamps were burning low and we were packing up to go when a big fellow, one of the
quartet who had sung a lined hymn, offered to sing John Henry hesitatingly "I don't reckon
you'd want John Henry, would you? I guess you already got that."/Mr. Lomax asked for a
sample of his version; this head-rider, Arthur Bell, had sung only threelines: Well, every
Monday morning when the blue birds begin to sing, You can hear those hammers a mile
or more You can hear John Henry's hammer ring- when Mr. Lomax called excitedly, "Wait
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
there! Get you a hammer ready, and start back at the beginning." Obediently and quietly,
Arthur picked up a "billy", which as a "trusty" head-rider he was allowed to use in the field,
tried it out on the barrack bars, nodded, and at Mr. Lomax's "Ready", started in agains"
"Every Monday Morning when the blue birds began to sing"-and on through an interesting
version of John Henry, which appears in full in Our Singing Country. The closing stanza
sings:
"They taken him to Washington and they buried him in the sand People from the East
and people from the West Come to see that steel-driving man. Some say he come from
England, some say he come from Spain, But I say he wann't nothin' but a Louisiana
Nigger Just a leader of a steel-driving gang.
Just a week or so after we made these recordings a storm blew down the barracks of
Camp #6 5. We read in a newspaper that two of the boys who tried to get away in the
darkness were overtaken by the hounds and were shot when they refused to surrender.
Others were captured. We hadn't the heart to enquire whether Arthur Bell and "Garmouth",
the are among the dead or the missing, or are still singing their JohnrHenry and shouting
their "Git up, Red" and "Gee, Bill" in the fields.

Cummins State Farm, Camp #1
May 21, 1939
After we had packed up our machinery in the barracks of Camp #6, we drove to the home
of Captain Acklin, about four or five miles away. There we spent the night. After breakfast
the next morning, Sunday, we talked to Captain Miller who had charge of the Negro
barracks of Camp #1 nearby. Trusties sat on guard with guns ready in case of a break.
Other trusties helped get the men together. One trusty took our car to the farm garage
to repair a tire. The convicts were very poorly dressed; in fact, proceedings had to wait
until some of the men could get on more clothes when they saw a woman in the car. The
Captain said that some of them had better clothes; "but", said he," Sunday is the day when
the trusties in charge of clothing go around among the groups and pass out cleaner or
better garments to those who appear to need them most. Some of the fellows try to look
their worst. No, they don't have stripes or any other kind of uniform." Later Superintendent
Reed boasted about the large balance that he had built up for the state prison system.
We heard no complaint from the boys about food, and we made no comment to Supt.
Reed, but we thought privately that some of that surplus might well be used for soap and

for clothes to replace the rags that the boys were wearing that Sunday morning. The boys
seemed fond of their immediate supervisor, Captain Miller, and requested that we let him
have a six-inch record of their songs of his choosing The sons of Capt. Acklin and of Capt.
Miller were interested spectators.
"Father", a big fellow who had been on the farm for several, a favorite among the boys,
helped line up the singers, a bunch of whom claimed to know Rock Island Line. After
several experiments with shovels and picks in an effort to get the right sound effects, a
group finally recorded Rock Island Line in the mess hall where the machine was set up.
For text and list of singers see later pages.
Laroy Martin, a cripple, volunteered to sing Crawdad, with a small group of assistants.
When Mr. Lomax asked for game songs or children's songs, Virgil Lamb offered Long-
tailed Rat, amid great guffaws of his fellows. Then Willie Johnson tried to recall a
version of the Ram of Darby, though he called his version Didn't he Ramble? which he
used to hear his grandfather sing. Willie, known as "Little Life" because of his sluggish
movements, could not "get together" many of the stanzas. Three or four field hollers and
other work songs were recorded and a quartetled by Joe Green sang some spirituals
arranged by C. W. Smith, a "Reverend", who when he saw that I was writin down the
names of the singers whispered to me privately: "If you goin' write down our names, write
mine down' Nathaniel Hawkins! That other name, 'C. W. Smith' is jes' my hideous while
I'm servin' my time out here." The quartet gate an interesting performance with the bass
running up and down the whole scalewith a line while the rest "worked it over" more slowly
and in greater detail. The only Bad Man Ballad was offered by Willie Rayford.

we packed up to move on; finding Supt. Reed at home, we received his permission to
interview the Negro women who were housed in the rear of the superintendent's residence
under the supervision of Mrs. Reed. The girls who were interested or curious gathered
into a large room which serves as a sewing room and a laundry. At first nobody knew
anything. Then Mr. Lomax told them about the girls of Goree Farm in Texas. One of these
Arkansas girls, who "lived in Texas but got into trouble in Arkansas for something didn' do',
knew Hattie Ellis and her singing. Then the girls began to "tell on' each other. There were

the five o'clock bell rang, and the recorders had to hunt up lodging for the night. Some of
the songs offered, we felt sure, came from the radio or from the phonograph, but in most
cases these girls had changed them and improvised them to suit their own fancy and to
make them their own.

ones in which we set up our machine to work. We are not sure whether it one of the three
in which we worked. Twelve convicts escaped in the confusion and two, at latest account
that we saw in the papers, were killed in trying to escape. We made some pretty good
records, but even in the past two years the death rate of old songs has risen. Two or
three "blues' that we recorded from Negro girls at Cummins are better than those of the
farfamed Hattie of the Texas "Thirty Minutes behind the Walls' program. At Parchman we
found the superintendent harrassed by personal and political problems, so that we did not
tarry very long after working with two camps. Fortunately for us, rain kept the boys out of
the fields so that we were able to do our work by day instead of at night.

May 22, 1939
We left the headquarters of the Arkansas state farm as soon as the women convicts had
been ca led to their dormitory and we had told Supt. Reed goodbye. He gave us directions
for finding a new camp, Number 9, out from Arkansas City. We bought some supper at
the nearby town of Varner, but we could find no place to sleep. We followed the rough and
winding highway to McGehee, Arkansas, where we found a comfortable hotel. Early next
morning we started out for Camp #9. At Arkansas City we stopped for further directions.
This formerly prosperous town is all bu but dead now. Newly made red-clay roads led to
Camp #9 and we were thankful that it had not rained recently. Captain Burt Clayton, in
charge of the camp and his wife were very gracious, inviting us to dinner and extending
the noon rest period so that the boys might sing for Mr. Lomax. This camp was at that
time only three months old; it was surprising how much land had been cleared and what
good crops were on the way. The men were betterdressed than the men at Camp #1.
They gathered under the large trees in the dormitory yard and sang and joked. One of the

Parchman, Miss. - State Farms, Camps #10 and #1. May 23, 24, 1939
We left Camp #9 of the Arkansas state farm about 2 o'clock and spent the night at
Greenville, Mississippi, across the Mississippi River. It wasma stormy night; much damage
was done by the wind and rain, but the next morning we had clear weather for our drive to
Parchman. Mr. Lomax had made his first recording visit to Parchman in 1933. We could
not see the Superintendent when we first arrived, but his assistant gave permission for us
to visit Camp #10. Rain had set in and the boys could not work. We set up the machine
in the wide hall of the barracks, that separates the white dormitory from the Negroes.. (A
high barbed wire fence surrounds the barracks.) Singers were not plentiful or enthusiastic,
but we recorded a few tunes before the rain subsided enough for the boys to chop wood
and do other light jobs around the barracks. In the evening we tried again with fair results.
We discovered that one barrier was the idea that we were there to make money out of the
boys without "divvying-up". This they were told by one of the boys who had made some
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
commercial records. After Mr. Lomax made it clear to them the prupose of the recording
and the use to-which their songs would serve, they were more generous, and helpful.
The next day, Sunday, after lunch we visited Camp #1. Several of the there remembered
Mr. Lomax, among them Big Charlie Butler the gateman. They were all more willing, but
they had very few interesting songs of which we did not already have more interesting
versions. Monday morning we kept an engagement at the women's camp, but the women
were at their laundry work and we made no recordings.. After bidding Parchman officials
goodbye, we set out for Livingston, Alabama. While working at Parchman, we made our
headquarters at a small hotel in Drew, a few miles down the highway.

kindling and spread oil around an outhouse which was insured for $250.00. Neighbors
discovered the fire from the smoke. Burndown and his employer set to work to help put out
the fire. Burndown was convicted of arson; his white employer's trial was postponed on an
insanity plea. Burndown said he knew he oughtn't to do it, but he thought he had to obey
his boss.

Livingston, Ala.
May 25-30, 1939
This was our second visit to Livingston, Alabama. Hard as we had worked ourselves and
Mrs. Tartt on our previous visit, we realized that we had barely scratched the surface,
so far as recording the songs of the region was concerned, though Mrs. Tartt had reams
of Texts written down. Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt was again our chief assistant, guide and
ramrod. In the few days that we were working around Livingston she drove her car nearly
two hundred miles, looking up singers, and bringing them to the microphone, from far
and near, over hill, over dale, through mud and stream. She has the confidence of the
community including the Negroes whom she has never refused help, and this was an
opportunity for them to show her their appreciation. Doc Reed and Vera Hall, cousins
who havesung together for many years, are her most dependables. They are good
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
singers of the old style spirituals, are perfect in "seconding"- "following after" they call
it,- and they know many songs. Not having book-learning they store in the back of their
heads innumerable tunes and stanzas. Vera Hall is especially quick to "catch up" a new
tune. And if they do not understand completely the text, they are ingenious in supplying
substitutes, either from other spirituals or from their own feelings of the moment. These
two, however, unlike old Uncle Rich Brown, do not substitute jargon; their texts mean
something, if not always what the original words meant.
We missed some of the singers who had recorded for us before. Some had moved
away; Richard Amerson, the unexstinguishable, was in Mississippi working in strawberry
beds; Blind Jesse had "gone to his reward",-wherever he is we hope he is allowed a new
"macordium" to replace his old wheezy one. Somehow a golden harp would hardly give
the right background for Blind Jesse's favorite songs. Uncle Rich Brown could not be
reached, out in the clay hills.
But Mrs. Tartt's new "finds", the McDonalds, Jeff Horton and the Sims Tartt group from
Boys, together with our old acquaintances who were available, kept us busy for the six
days.

From letter of R.T.L. to family
Livingston, Ala. - May, 1939.
Our objective in Alabama was Livingston, where we found our singers of spirituals still
going strong and where our friend Mrs. Tartt, though just recovering from a siege of
streptococci-throat, had rallied some new "songsters" with new songs or new versions.
This time we recorded a gratifying number of play-party songs and lullabies. We could not
reach the Negro church to which we started, but found another closer in, where we found
the preacher holding forth on Moses. I don't know how long he had been preaching, but
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
after about fifteen minutes he said, "I can't fool around with Moses all day, I must pass
on to Jesus." About two-thirty he stopped, and then we set up our machine and caught
some "mournin" songs." Next day we got a dandy record from Aunt Florida, who after
singin' spirituals started on a "reel", but, breaking off in the middle, began to explain how
she could not go on in sech sin. "I told de Lord that I wouldn't sin no more. Course de Lord
he know I gwine sin some mo', I jes' couldn't hep sinning a little, but He know too I aint
'bleeged to sin by singin' no reels. See dem clouds? Dey's jes' a-gatherin' this minute to
send fo'th de Lord's light'nin' an' strike me down. An' Miss Ruby (Mrs. Tartt) you done sin
agin de Lord, too, for 'suadin' me into singin' dis reel". In reality it was no more than a ring-
game song. The machine was going and as a result we have a dandy introduction to a
chapter on Negro secular songs.

Vera Hall- -"sinful songs", "worl'ly" songs, "reels"
While Vera Hall seemed to be as devout a Christian as Doc Reed, her cousin, and
sang the old spirituals with as much sincerity and feeling, yet she did not refuse to sing
seculsr songs that she had learned from her mother, her husband,- at this time in the
penitentiary,-, from Richard Amerson, and especially from UBlind Jesse" Harris. If Vera
can hear a song sung through once or twice, she can sing it again herself, with per haos
a variation or two of her own, always an improvement. When we were hunting Blind Jesse
and his songs, Vera furnished us the best list of his old songs. We would say, "Vera, do
you know (for instance) Railroad Bill?" And Vera would reply, "No, sir, I can't say dat I
knows it. I used to hear Blind Jesse sing it." "How did it go, Vera?" "Le's see. I don't knows
as I can put it together." But a gleam of remembrance would come into her eyes, she
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
would shift her feet, throw her head back, open her mouth and throat, and out would come
"Railroad Bill is a mighty bad man, I'm skeered o' Railroad Bill" and away she would go.
This time we asked her for playparty or game or other children's songs: She hesitated:
"It's been a long time". Then she smiled, "We used to sing 'All hid?' May be I can put it
together." Looking about her as if she thought that Mrs. Tartt's yard would be a very good
place to find hiding-places, she started off? "Is it all hid?-No, no". With this song her mind
had slipped back into its play groove, and Vera, at this one sitting, gave us fiv five more
children's songs: Come up, Horsey; Rosey; Carrie: Little girl, yes ma'am; Candy gal; and
What a pretty piece o' meat, - a "hold up the gates" game song.

Caroline Horne and family
May 28, 1939
It was Sunday and we had started out to Doc Reed's church for services. Mrs. Tartt
suggested that we stop at Aunt Ca'line Horne's house off in the cotton patch a half mile
or so from the road. There we found Aunt Ca'line, two daughters, Frances and Aurilla, a
son, Jim (Duck), two otr three frineds of the family and a bunch of "grands". It was a giggly
group, the boys given to wise-cracking. Mrs. Tartt previously had got frm from Aunt Ca'line
thw words of a lullaby, but on this occasion Aunt Ca'line disclaimed all knowledge of the
song. While we were talking with her, a hey heavy shower came up; we had our machine
and batteries set up on the porch; the roof leaked and we had to move our apparatus
about to avoid the drippings. Finally one of the daughters suggested a church song, which
she and her mother sang,- I got to stand there by myself; then the two daughters recorded
another spiritual, All my sins been takened away. Then Aunt Ca'line recalled the children's
song and recorded "Little Red Bird in the tree. Then the son Jim, "Duck", sang a cotton
song, Cotton needs plowin' and a filed holler, Say, she brought my breakfast. His friend,
B.B. Powell sang, CanT make a livin' in sandy land. We had overstayed our time, the rain
had let up a bit, and we packed up to leave.

Johnson Place Baptist Church-4 miles from Livingston- May 28, 1939
After we left Aun Ca'line Horne's house we had driven about two miles when on our way
up a long steep red clay hill the rain came down in earnest. Mrs. Tartt was driving her car
ahead of us to snow the way and to pick up Doc Reed who was to meet us at a certain
cross-road. Vera, we discovered before we left town, had gone otu the night before with
some friends. Mrs. Tartt would not turn back, even though we passed two cars in the ditch,
until at the top of another long red-clay hill where tye road curved at the top, her carnot
only took the curve but made a complete circle and stood facing homeward. Then at last
she consented to go back. It was then after twelve o'clock and by the time we could have
have reached Doc's church even those late-beginning and long-drawn-out services would
have closed. On our way in we noticed that the Johnson Place Baptist Church was holding
service, and so we stopped there. While we were trying to decide whether to unlaod the
machine, one of the deacons came out and 'buked us for disturbing the service. And he
was justified. We apologized, explained what we were considering, received enthusiastic
permission to record some of the service, and unloaded and set up the machine as quietly
as possible. The preacher and brethren obligingly continued the service, even repeated
some of it including the offering, so that the "white friends" might rightly participate by
marching up to the pulpit with their dimes and quarters.
The preacher, as we judged, had probably been preaching for an hour, when we arrived;
after about twenty minutes or a half hour, he wiped his brow and said, "I can't fool along
with Moses all day; I got to pass on to Jesus now", and he proceeded witha discourse
based on a New Testament text. When he had finished his sermon we asked them to sing
some of their
spirituals for us to record. We recorded four spirituals and two prayers with congregational
"moanin'".

in the town of Livingston were made on the spacious back "gallery" or in the flowere-

of the community and they love and trust her to such a degree that they rarely fail her.
And so Aunt Celina, even though it was Monday morning, changed her dress and came

Sim Tartt and group from Boyd community- May 29, 1939
Mrs. Tartt had told us about the Tartt family of Negroes that lived in the Boyd, Alabama
community. She had heard the group sing together with beautiful effect. Because of the
rain she thought they would not be working in the field and drove the seventeen miles or
more to their farm home to bring them in to sing. She was told at their house that "Sim an'
them is huntin' fish". Mrs. Tartt walked through the mud down to the river, calling as she
went, to locate them the sooner. Finally she heard a startled whisper, "Dat's Miss Ruby
Callin'! Hear her? Reckin what she want?" Then Mrs. Tartt, "Sim, Mandy, you heard me.
Where are you?" They came forth, bare-footed and thinly clad; for they really had been
fish-hunting. The high water, receding, had left live fish far up on the bank. These the
Negroes were spearing and catching with bare hands. But at "Miss Ruby"'s bidding, they
left the river, hastily made themselves reddy and were on their way. Every foot of the long,
winding, still-muddy road they sang spirituals, some of them new even to Mrs. Tartt. who

Joe perched themselves in the cornerron the rounded top of a hair-covered trunk. It was
evidently used often for a settee, as it had a scarf on top of it and a rug in front. Jim and
Janie, their children, stood behind the trunk when they helped with the songs. Aunt Molly
was the principal performer. She was in good humor, although she claimed to have a cold,
and she laughed gleefully, joking with Mr. Lomax and Mrs. Tartt as well as "ribbing" her
husband, Uncle Joe. They had been "raised with white folks" and from them learned some
of their songs. They had had the reputation of being good songsters, and probably good
clowns, and were often invited by their "white folks" to entertain guests. Their repertoire
is extensive, and, although Mrs. Tartt had interviewed them several times and had made
a long, list of their songs, they sang some that afternoon that she had never heard, They
know many playparty and game songs, and in getting these we spent most of our time. We
had time to record only three spirituals.

Enoch Brown
"There's ole Enoch", Doc Reed said as he sat on Mrs. Tartt's back "gallery" ready to sing.
We listened to the "hollerin"' as everybody calls it, though that is too harsh a word for such
a rounded-tones. He was crossing the bridge over the Sacarnatchie that runs at the foot
of Baldwin Hill. He is artist enough to know that from just there his calls will sound most
effective. It is a sort of "hallo-ing", perhaps a form of yodeling, though the words are those
of field songs, with always a weird lonesomeness. We could never quite get the effect into
our microphone. Usually he would call "oh-oh-oo-oo, I won't be here long", with variations
on that theme. Enoch is a strange person, the kind of person that we are tempted to call
"a strange creature", for he seems "other-worldly", a wraith that appears suddenly out of
darkness- we have never seen him in daytime in two visits- His sentences in conversation
are condensed. "He come?", when expanded means "Has Mr. Lomax arrived?" If the
answer is "No", Enoch turns away with a mere "Back again". His laugh, too, is not of this
earth. Enoch's clothing consist mostly of rags pinned together; he does not keep himself
clean; he works only when he is hungry, and not then if he has some excuse to walk up
the hill to Mra. Tartt's home about mealtime. He ought to be repulsive, but he isn't; rather,
he stirs deeply the pools of tenderness in the heart. The texts of his calls are not set down.
It is almost impossible to remember to set them down as he hollers.
Livingston, Ala., - 1939 The American Folk Song Archive written by Ruby Terrill Lomax for
newspaper reporter.
For five days of the past week the banks of the Sucanotchie have rung with echoes from
the Old South, as tune after tune of old songs that would will soon be forgotten were sung
and put on record in the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. P. Tartt by John A. Lomax, Honorary
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
Curator of the Folk Song Archive of the Library of Congress. The Negro "songsters" were
discovered and introduced to Mr. Lomax by Mrs. Tartt. Twenty full twelve-inch discs were
filled with more than a hundred songs, many of them "new" to Mr. Lomax and probably, to
musicians of America.
The Library of Congress is convinced that, as old books and manuscripts should be
preserved, so old tunes should be caught from the lips of the fast disappearing "songsters"
of folk songs and saved for the pleasure and the study of musicians in future days; for
many influences are driving these old songs of the folk out of the minds of even the
older generation of people who know them. Mr. Lomax's interest in preserving old songs
reaches back many years to the nights when he listened to the cowboys as they soothed
the "little dogies", bedded down for the night near his Texas home. He began to write
down the words of these cowboy songs and kept many of the tunes alive in his head.
Later through the influence of his Harvard professors he was given the Sheldon Travel
Fellowship and started out for the West with an old-style dictaphone to gather cowboy
songs and
other frontier songs and ballads. These he later included in his COWBOY SONGS, which
has recently been enlarged and revised with many more tunes than the first edition gives.
This first edition, so scholars claim, was the first volume of genuine American folk songs
ever published and a copy of the 1910 edition is classed among the "rare" items on a
collector's shelves.
For several years Mr. Lomax, as an officer of the University of Texas and later as a
business executive in Dallas, Texas, was too busy with routine work to collect songs in
the field. But his interest never waned and during the past six years he has criss-crossed
the continent many times with his recording machine, lecturing to colleges and gathering
tunes from every state in the Union except North Dakota. His first lengthy recording trip
with an improved modern machine was sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, directed
through the Music Division of the Library of Congress. He and his son, Alan Lomax, visited
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
every penitentiary of the South, where they found Negro folk-tunes least "contaminated"
by "White" and other modern influences. Here they found also a great variety of folk tunes.
In Lousiana prison farm Lead Belly sang into the microphone many of his stirring songs,
accompanying them on his twelve-string guitar. He was later paroled by the Governor to
accompany the Lomaxes, and his dramatic story they tell in their NEGRO FOLK SONGS
AS SUNG BY LEAD BELLY.
In their travels the Lomaxes have recorded remnants and widely differing versions of old
English ballads, fiddle tunes, hillbilly songs, lulabies, play party and dance tunes, work-
songs as varied as the tasks they lightened, cowboy songs, field hollers, Mexican border
ballads, from widely scattered ups and downs, ins and outs of the United States. But their
favorite source of material is the Negro of the South, whose work songs and spirituals
attract the attention of musicians everywhere they are played. Two years ago, while Mr.
Lomax was supervising the gathering of folk materials for the Federal Writers Project,
Mr. Lomax and his wife worked in Livingston, Alabama with Negro "Songsters" who
were introduced to them by Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt. On that visit more than a hundred
songs were recorded. The names of some of these singers are well-known in the Music
Division of the Library of Congress, particularly Doc Reed and Vera Hall, whose records
of spirituals are the pride of the Folk Song Archive. And the fame of these singers is
not limited to the Library staff. On Christmas Day the British Broadcasting Corporation
opened a series of programs which undertook to acquaint the British people with folk
music of America; included in one of these programs was a spiritual sung by Vera Hall
of Livingston. When Mr. Lomax records, he tells the musicians that they cannot expect
returns in money for their services, that they too are making a contribution to the country:
but not even Mr. Lomax foresaw that the clear-voiced singer from Livingston would be sent
through the twenty-two millions radios of the British Empire.
Adopting the conviction of Mr. Lomax that Livingston, Alabama and its vicinity has the best
singers of Negro spirituals in the country, the Library of Congress asked
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
Mr. Lomax to include Livingston again in his itinerary with an improved machine which
makes almost perfect reproductions. Once more through the help of Mrs. Tartt the songs
the "songsters" were rallied and filled twenty records with beautiful spirituals, playparty
songs, work-songs, lullabies. Some of the old favorites, such as "Job, Job" and "John"
Saw Dat Number", were re-recorded, but a large number of "brand new" tunes were
sung. Most of the recordings were made in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Tartt, though for
a few songs the machine with batteries was taken to the singers' homes. One set of
congregational singing was recorded in the Johnson Place Baptist Church near Livingston.
Besides the COWBOY SONGS and the Lead Belly book mentioned above, Mr. Lomax
is editor and compiler of the following collections: SONGS OF THE COW CAMP AND
CATTLE TRAIL: and, in collaboration with Alan Lomax, of AMERICAN BALLADS AND
FOLK SONGS, VOL. I. A second volume of American Ballads Our Singing Country is in
preparation and will appear this fall.

four songs, she invited us to dinner; there was no excusing ourselves, and we stayed. The
food was coarse and poorly prepared, but Mrs. Griffin's courteous hospitality made up for
any deficiencies in the quality of the food. She had chickens, all of whom she called by

Professor Morris invited Mrs. Griffin to sing her ballads to his classes in the University of
Florida, Mrs. Griffin has had an ambition to hear her name mentioned on radio. She was
beginning to look to her shekels, too. It seems that some of her friends or her family had
suggested that the men who were getting her songs were making money from them, of
which she should have a large share. She at length seemed convinced of Mr. Lomax's
sincerity of purpose, and she recorded several songs that she had thought up since Mr.
Lomax was there with Professor Morris. I set down here some interesting remarks that are
not included in the excerpts from a letter, a copy of which is attached.
*She kept her jewels in a girly-perchy box."- -" That song? why, I ain't thought o' that song
since I used to go to the cowpen and sing." Requesting to hear her recorded song played
back: "Set that off and see what hit caught." "My father was always singing songs; taught
singing schools."
*"When I was a girl, somebody brought me a box, smelled like rubber, called hit a 'girly-
perchy box."

down you will find Newberry where we spent yesterday with Mrs. G. A. Griffin, a white
singer. The Library already has seventy of her songs which John Avery and a University
of Florida man* got two years ago. Mrs. Griffin is much feebler and has lost severl more
teeth ("I caint sing no more, fer my lips git sucked in the holes between my teeth", giving
thereupon an exhibit as proof); nevertheless Mrs. Griffin added six or seven songs to her
list of recordings. She must have had a repertoire of two hundred in her prime, for there
is mentioned hardly an old secular song of which she did not know at least one couplet
or stanza. She calls herself a Georgy Cracker. "How did you happen to leave Georgia,
Mrs. Griffin?" "Well, my Ma had a sister down here she wanted to see, so her an' five o'

us kids jes' come. We lef' Pa at home an' he come later." "How did you come?" "Walked
hit. A hundred 'n' seventy eight miles, ever step of hit. Tuck us three weeks. But when we
wuz bigger me an' my brother walked hit agin in seven days an' nights". She had twelve
children all brought to maturity and eleven of them living now. "my children all had the
same father. I haint never been that way except fer one man, an' as the Lord's my witness
I haint never knowed but two men in all my life, an' them two wuz my husbands. An' I've
been thowed with men in every way. I've worked in the fields with 'em, rid horse races
with 'em-why I run a horse race right over thar, ridin' barback, made some money too,
not bettin', but jest the prize money; an' I've built a house with my own hands, an' when I
married Mr. Griffin I wuz runnin' a sawmill o' my own, an' had twelve men a workin' for me."
Explaining that she was not on good terms with one of her daughters who probably could
remember some of the song words that she had forgot, Mrs. Griffin said: "Will Brown, he's
my daughter's husband, told me he'd kick me off the place if I ever come near his house.
An' d'ye know why? Well, I told 'em plain out that Nellie, that's their daughter an' my own
grandchild, too, I haint a-denyin' that, but I told 'em she wuz goin' to burn in hell fire fer
breaking up another man's home. She went in an' got a man to fall in love with her, then
she tuck an' divorced her own husband an' made this other man divorce his wife an' then
they wuz married. Twarnt nothin' but plain adultery an' nothin' caint save her from hell, an'
I told 'em so an' they don't like hit." "Anyhow my daughter caint sing any better than I can,
fer she's snaggled toothed too, Mrs. Griffin used to work large farm, but once had $22000
in bank. Lost most of it in bank failure. Mrs. Griffin calls a spade a spade. She can't write,
"never went to school a day in my life". This came out when she complained that she had
difficulty in shopping: "I have to send my grandson here, an' he caint remember but one
thing at a time; so I have to send him fer meat, an' then when he gits home with the meat,
I have to send him back for beans." "Why dont you write out a list for the grocer?" Then
came the explanation. But Mrs. Griffin is wise in many ways beyond "book-larnin'". Wish
we could hear her husbands' side of this story.

Mrs. G.A.Griffin - Further notes on Mrs. Griffin-
June 1,1939
"My father was a fiddler. I learnt most o' my songs from him. We still got his fiddle. The
children all bid for it, and I bid it in for $92.00".
Mrs. Griffin's version of the lullaby, "Go to sleepy, little baby", concludes: "When you wake
up, you shall have Some cake an' all them pretty little horses."
She tells about her reluctance to sing a certain song for Mr. Lomax and Professor Morris:
"I looked over an' saw Mr. Morris a-look-in' down, an' I knowed he was thinkin' evil. An' I
tried to keep from laughin' till my jaws hurt."
Her father had fifteen guns, called by name: Bull-tyre(?); Scooter-plough (made from
scooter plough); Spike barrell; Holt- -; Meat-in-the-pot; Betsy, etc.
About her and her brother's trip back to Georgia when she was 15 years old, she says:
"When I was 15 years old, brother an' me walked back to Georgy in seven days an' nights.
Sometimes at night we stayed in people's houses; we always told 'em the truth, never
lied; I told my brother to always tell the truth an' we'd be all right: jes' brother an' sister
makin' our way back to Georgy. One night we come to a church, with the door open; it was
empty, a space so-high where the roof come down to the walls was open, not boarded-
up; don't know why; may be they didn't have 'nough plans or may be cooler that way. We
pulled some benches together and I put my bundle under my arms and laid down. Now my
brother found a path leadin' down to the well,-he was older and been about more and saw
sech things. We went down to git some water and we had to pass a graveyard There was
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
a cow that just had a calf and she was groanin' and carryin' on, an' I got scairt. An' when I
was layin' on them benches I kept nearin' them noises in the graveyard an' 'bout that time
I heared the awfullest Flop-flop-flop, an' I knowed it was sperits. I called my brother an'
he said it wasn't no sich, go, on to sleep, -but the floppin' kep' up till I couldn't stand it no
longer. Then my brother got up a-cussin' me an' said hit warn't nothin' but buzzards. They
was some straw an' dry leaves outside an' he set 'em of fire an hit blazed up an' he said
they was seven buzzards an' a owl come out from that big crack, but I didn't see 'em, an' I
still believe they was sperits."
When Mr. Lomax mentioned to her the ballad, The King wrote a love-letter, which she had
recorded previously, she said she learned it from her father, and proceeded to relate this
incident: "Once my father stood on top o' the shed and sung The king wrote a love-letter,
and he sung it so loud that the neighbors three mile away said they heared him. They was
a creek and I guess his voice went down the creek." She was sixteen years old the last
time she heard him sing.

Raiford, Fla. State Penitentienary Letter of RTL to family
Dear Jim,
Having escaped from Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi penitentiaries, we are caught again
in Florida. From where I am sitting we see only beautiful lawns and trees, and would never
guess than a few yards away there are many hundreds of prisoners confined. Florida has
a very fine superintendent, Mr. Chapman, who believes that every man should be at work,
and here even the cripples have their jobs, every man who is not in the hospital. I have
not been inside yet, but I imagine it is cleaner than some of the state prisons that we have
visited, not to mention the name of our, or my native state! Our host was away yesterday
when we arrived, but Mr. Chapman had left word and the trusties who seem to run the
house took us in charge. John Avery has gone scouting this morning and my work begins
again when he spots the singers.
Later
With the help of the recreational director and band leader Mr. Lomax found some singers.
We set up the machine in a room that had had been used for an exhibit of arts and crafts
of convicts. We set up our machine and worked several hours with a quartet who sang,
with guitar accompaniment for some of the songs. James Richardson who sang Home on
the Range said he had sung it for radio on some state official occassion. Next morning
as we started out, Superintendent Chapman called me back and said he didnot want me
to go into the men's dormitory; he did not want to take any chance of the men's trying
a break with me as hostage. So much for Sunday morning and afternoon. Some of the
convicts had training as electrical engineers helped with the recording. I was allowed to
visit the women's ward. They had church service early after which we set up our machine

for as many as wished to stay. The women were slow getting started and had to urge one
another.
Raiford, Fla. June 5.
At my most recent writing to you, I believe, I had just been forbidden admission to the
men's ward of the Mississippi prisons. On our last night there I helped with the recordings
in the women's ward,-blues, bye-baby songs, spirituals etc. The girls were allowed to stay
up till 1 o'clock, which added to our popularity with them. I dont know how they felt about it
next morning at four o'clock. Several of the best singers had gone,-served "they time" and
now in the free world, or paroled; one of the best is incapacitated, in the t. b. ward for two
years; he wept when John Avery visited him, because he could not sing any more.

JAL '39 Murrells Inlet, South Carolina
June 6-8, 1939
Excerpt from letter of R.T.L. to family
From Raiford we went up the coast highway through Brunswick, Savannah, Charles where
we spent the night, though I think we should not have stopped, had we known about
the polio epidemic, the worst in S.C. for many years. For that reason we had to forego
gathering little Negro children together at Murrells Inlet, as we had planned, for playparty
songs, - twenty-five dollar fine for such. Tourist camps and houses were not allowed to
take in children under twelve years without some kind of statement from a doctor. But we
did get some good individual singers, among them our old friend Mrs. Floyd who learned
to read when she received her first love-letter.
If you or any of your family travel along Route 17 between Georgetown and Myrtle Beach
(through Murrells Inlet), dont fail to drive into Brookgreen Garden, which is developed

1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
by Huntington, one of nine gardens which he has given to various regions of the United
States. His wife is the sculptor of the Diana which reposes in the Univ. of Texas library, a
copy of which is in Brookgreen Garden, among nearly a thousand fine pieces of American
sculpture. Our friend, Mrs. Chandler, is curator of the museum on the grounds. The best
part of the whole garden is the natural beauty grand old live-oaks with silvery moss, restful
and quiet and dignified. For the flower gardens Mr. Huntington has specialized in native
South Carolina flowers. Our trip all the way from Texas was made, most of the way,
through canyons of green woods, with various sorts of wild flowers, and magnolio trees;
the last day through the Blue Ridge our road was lined with azaleas in higher spots, and
mountain laurel and rhododendron in addition to the gayer-colored smaller flowers. Wild
honey-suckle and roses were profuse too.
Further notes on Murrells Inlet:
We had not seen the Chandlers since January 1937. On our way to their home three
miles north of the post office, we stopped at Brookgreen Gardens, eight miles south, to
see Mrs. Chandler and make arrangements for recording. She did everything possible
to help us in the short hours of leisure; besides her work at the Gardens, she has a
family of five children to support and look after. She had already arranged for Mrs. Minnie
Floyd to come sing. She tried to arrange for a trip over to the Island, where the people
live in very primitive style and sing tunes that go back to slavery and earlier times. But
transportation for our machine-was-and the heavy batteries needed for supplying the
power was a problem that we did not so ,as only row-boats were available. Another snag:
Mrs. Chandler's maid, Lilli Knox, was not well and was having family troubles; she was
in a "not appreciated" mood and would not sing her spirituals for us in, as she had done
previously for us in her own delightful and impressive way. And her cousi Zackie, also,
refused.. We set up our machine in the center of lovely mose hung liveoak grove, in the
home of Mrs. Chandler's father, where we could get electric current. Mrs. Floyd came

and sang, as did a Negro schoolteacher Annie Holmes, who brought two or three small
children with her to sing game songs.
We had been introduced to Mrs. Genevieve W. Chandler through Miss Montgomery of the
WPA Writers Project. Mrs. Chandler had sent in interesting stories and texts of songs that
she had gathered in her community, which is the setting of Julia Peterkin's novels about
Negroes of S.C. Mrs. Chandler herself has stories rpinted in Scribner's and Ma'amoiselle

And he could see the light no more. For seven long months he lay, liminated in iron bands
Till he saw the brisk young lady, set him free from iron bands. The jailer had one only
daughter, and she was a lady of high degree As she passed the prison door She chanced

Clemson, S. C; Anderson County, S. C.; Toccoa Falla, Ga.- -June 9-12, 1939
It is a good day's trip from Murrells Inlet to Clemson, South Carolina. The name on the
map is Clemson College, S. C., the site of the state college by that name. We had been
invited there by Ben Robertson Jr, who thought that Mr. Lomax might be interested in
seeing the throngs of people who gathered to such a "singing" as is advertised to be held
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
at Toccoa Falls, Georgia, described on the attached folder which Mr. Robertson sent us;
he thought also that the Library of Congress might be interested in recording this type
of religious song and its style of singing. As indicated later the size of the crowd and
other physical conditions made it impossible to get a representative group. One of the
two numbers sung into the microphone by the men's quartet invited to record proved to
be a "joke", unintentional. The men were asked to sing one of their favorite hymns, as a
second number. Because of noises the door between the singers' room and the hallway
where the machine was set up had to be closd closed after the "ready" signal was given.
When the song was played back Mr. Lomax heard to his amazement an imitation of a
Negro spiritual.' And on this trip he had just recorded hundreds of genuine spirituals from
Negroes themselves.
For the three days of our visit we were guests in the Robertson home, where Ben
Robertson Jr. lives with his father, Ben Robertson Sr., a professor in Clemson College.
Their Negro maid, Mary Lee, runs the househod under the guidance of Ben Robertson
Jr. The home has a very fine library and there were evidences around of Mr. Robertson's
activities as a writer.
In the evening of the first day, Friday, Mr. C. F. Adams, a moving pow power in the
"Singing Festival", called to make arrangements for our Sunday recordings. He invited
us to his broadcast early Sunday morning at Anderson, S. C. Mr. Adams himself has
a furniture and funeral service busi- ness with headquarters in Seneca, S. C. With his
broadcast of religious music sung and played by various quareets, trios, duets, church
choirs, Sunday School choirs and classes, family orchestras, he has an opportunity of
advertising his principal business but also the song book business of which he is an
unofficial, if not official, agent.
On Saturday Mr. Robertson gathered to his home some of his Negro friends, a quartet
of working men, and a quartet of young people from the Owens family. Their songs are
listed later. After the visit to Mr. Adams's broadcast Sunday morning, we stopped at the
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
Anderson County Convict Camp, for a road gang. Our experiences there are related
elsewhere. The afternoon we spent on the Toccoa Falls Singing Festival project.
For the evening Mr. Robertson had investigated Negro rural servics We were told that the
Little Hope Baptist congregation would have services. It looked like rain, but we started
out. On the way we learned from Negroes on foot that the group was gathering at the
school-house which was nearer than the church house. When we arrived some fifty people
of all ages had gathered. The house was dimly lighted but we set to work as quickly as
possible, since lightning was beginning to flash. Perhaps the congregation did not feel
at home here, but response came slowly. Finally we did record several lined hymns and
spirituals and one very pretty cradle song. By the time we had packed up ready to go,
the rain was coming down in sheets. Mr. Robertson braved the storm to back the car as
close to the door as possible; with the help of the deacons we loaded up and with the
careful driving of Mr. Robertson we slid safely along the clay roads home. I couldn't help
wondering what the "Sunday Best" of those faithful church members looked like after they
had waded through the rain over the several miles that many had to travel. They are a very
patient, fine-spirited people.
The next morning we bade the Robertsons and Mary goodbye and started on our way
again.

2727B1 What a morning that will be and
2727B2-Ready when the great day comes-sung by Paul and Clarence Elliott, Horace
Sumney, Floyd Christian
These two quartets were contestants in the Georgia-Carolina Singing Festival, announced
of the attached folder. Ben Robertson and a young college reporter friend drove us on
Sunday, first to Anderson, S. C. where C. F. Adams conducted a broadcast of church
singing by selected groups. On the return from Anderson we stopped at the Anderson
County Convict Camp, where we recorded the songs described on the prededing pages.
After lunch we drove to Toccoa Falls, Georgia where a huge crowd had gather from three
states, about twenty thousand. It was a hot day and the building of the main session was
steaming, liverally. Loud speakers made the singing audible over several acres. It was
a great social gathering, a veritable reunion. It was impossible to choose wisely. After
listening for a long time on the outside, Mr. Lomax chose two quartets, one of women, one
of men, for recordings. They were conducted to a building where the machine was set up.
The records were made in the midst of much noise and confusion. The songs are not folk
songs, but the records illustrate a manner- kind of religious song and a manner of singing
them that are currently popular in some small town and rural districts. It is not the same as
the Sacred Harp.

The author, Ben Robertson, was our host at Clemson, S. C. for several days. He was once
a crack AP reporter in foreign parts. He has just returned from a trip to an oil island, whose
name I "disremember", off the coast of South America, a Dutch island where are American
oil fields. An article about his trip will appear in July or August in the Satevepost. On a
trip to Australia he stopped at Pitcairn Island; at least the boat stopped, and some of the
islanders, men, came aboard his boat. He saw none of the women and was not allowed
ashore. Mr. Robertson says the people are in need; he gave me a basket which was made
by a grandson of one of the originals, - I know that's true, because Pitcairn is woven into
the basket! What better proof could you ask? He is an interesting young fellow. I thought
how much Allen J. would enjoy him. He took us about, among other places to a white
singing festival at Toccoa Falls, Georgia, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., though we
played hookey part of the time. At least twenty thousand people were milling around, if not
"attending". At a county road camp we saw a sight that shocked us all, - eighty Negroes
tied by ankle chain to a long large common chain. The fellows were very good-natured
about it, and when the singers moved, the whole group made no complaint at having to
move too. When a singer would say, "This is as clost as I kin git to the mike", the other
fellows would shuffle their leg-chains along the big chain until the singer could reach the
mike. This was in group singing, where the mike could not be moved to one singer. The
boys enjoyed the diversion and invited us back. Mr. Robertson and a young reporter
who was with us did not know that such a custom existed in S. C. and they immediately
made resolutions. As guests of the state, John Avery and I, of course, can make no public
statement about our reactions. We came by Galax, Virginia, but could make no records
because one of our principals was ill with duodenal ulcer, but the beautiful trip through the
mountains was worth the additional mileage, at least to us, if not to the library budget.

Dear Mr. Lomax: Mary found the pen in the yard and was very pleased to know that
it was yours. She become a great admirer of you and Mrs. Lomax. I wish you would
write our Governor - he is Burnet R. Maybank - about the Negroes. I am sending you a
copy of a statement by Judge Featherstone about the Greenwood County situation - the
county below Anderson. I have written to him about the Anderson gang. I have been to
Philadelphia to see the Post editors about some more assignments and my father says
while I was away a Mr. Piesee from near Anderson came by with a hundred year old song
book, written with a goose quill pen. I don't know what it is like but when I see it I'll let you
know. It was a great pleasure to have you and Mrs. Lomax here and I hope you'll come by
here often. Give my regards to Alan. As ever, Ben Robertson. I am mailing the pen.
Honorable Burnet R. Maybank, Governor of South Carolina, Columbia, S. C.
My dear Governor:
Since 1934 I have spent much of my time travelling throughout the south making records
of folk songs. In this work I have visited Negro convicts in all Southern penitentiaries, and
in many of the road camps. In making my reports to the Library of Congress I have found
so much unjust criticiam and misinformation about the treatment of Negro convicts in the
South that a year or so ago I wrote a news article explaining the widely misunderstood
term "chain gang". In this story I stated that I had never soon convicts chained together.
(As a matter of fact no instance of physical brutality in all my experiences have come
under my personal notice). I can no longer make this claim.
A few Sundays ago I visited the convict road camp in Anderson County, South Carolina,
near Clemson College. There I saw a hundred negroes resting in their quarters, all
fastened togother on a single long chain, so that when a small group agreed to sing for
me, the entire bunch had to move out of the tent and stand in the open.
Library of Congress
1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1939001.afc1939001_fn0001
I do not know of the special reasons that make it necessary for these men to be chained
together on their rest day. I only know that I have never before seen a practice which
seemed to me unnecessary and inhuman.
I am writing to you, Governor, only in the hope that, through the power of your office
and the high esteem in which you are held by your people, you can have this situation
corrected. I am a Texan and I was for years on the Faculty of the University of Texas, but
my father, James Avery Lomax, was born and reared in Abbeville/District, South Carolina,
while my mother came from Alabama. By inheritance I hold dear the righteous ideas of a
Southern man.
I wish to add that I was most courteously received by the guards at the Anderson County
Prison Camp, and I was touched by the cheerful acceptance of their hard fate shown by
these black boys as they slowly dragged themselves about with their legs manacled to that
long chain.
Sincerely and respectfully yours.
P. S. Without their permission I refer you to Ben Robertson, Jr. of Clemson, S. C. and
to Professor Read Smith, South Carolina University, whom I have known somewhat
intimately since we were students together at Harvard University.

From Clemson College, S.C. we made a leisurely trip to Galax, Virginia, making brief
stopa at Brevard, N.C. and Ashville. Road repairs through the mountains called for some
detours.
We arrived at Galax, Virginia late in the afternoon of June 13 and at once communicated
with Dr.W.P.Davis, the director or chairman of the Bogtrotters Band. He was ill at his
country home. Mr. Lomax found Uncle Alex Dunford and Uncle Crockett Ward and invited
them to dinner. After dinner we all drove otu to the doctor's home. We had a pleasant visit.
Realizing that we could make no recordings on this trip, we started next morning on our
last day's travel on our 1939 recording trip and reached Washington in the late afternoon
of June 14.
Our speedometer snowed 6502 miles since we started out in Texas on March 31.
