Karl Knorr and hay crew "haying11 at Knorr Brothers Ranch lower hay meadow 
near the ranch, on Green Mountain Reservoir, c. 5 mi. north of Heeney 
road junction with Colo. 9. This family operation continues using 
"traditional" equipment, techniques developed for this kind of uneven, 
boulder-strewn rolling hay meadow. Principal pieces of equipment are 
"hay stacker" (frame of poles for makng loose hay stacks inside "stackyards" 
in the meadows...); "plunger" (metal pusher device mounted on front of 
c. 1952 Chevrolet stock truck called "plunger truck") which pushes heaps 
of loose hay up over the top of the inclined front of stacker; "buck rake" 
("bull rake") made from old auto or truck chassis with running gear turned 
around that scoops up windrowed hay and pushes it into piles in front of 
the plunger truck to be further pushed over the stacker onto growing 
haystack; a regular tractor (here, old John Deere) and wide hay rake / 
windrower that collects mown hay into rows for the buck rake to pick up; 
regular tractor (pair of c. 1970 Massey-Fergusons) with attached mowers 
(sickle-type, also M-Ferguson) that cuts ripened hay in hayfield as first 
step in haying process in August.... 
Karl Knorr (67), plunger truck operator, "cat" (Caterpiller, used to 
move the hay stacker and mi sc. jobs) operator, senior partner though younger 
brother in Knorr Bros. Ranch. Mustache, hat, dark glasses. 
George Knorr (68h yrs.), bull / buck rake operator, also seen forking 
loose hay into proper distribution on top of stacker/haystack. Now lives Kremmling.

Deere and hayrake/windrower. Senior in high school. 
Mrs. Robert D. (Pat) Enders, driving buck rake; lives on rented 
Knorr land, house across road from Karl and Jean Knorr.... Has helped with 
haying for six years, likes driving the buck rake and the outdoor work....

McKee ranch, contd., architecture 
"the old Dave Doig place" — log I house on former Doig homestead now 
at edge of high hay meadow on Knorr Brothers property, near Gr. Mt. Reservoir 
and Heeney road, Summit Co. Fine dwelling; now vacant, but Jean Knorr says 
they intend to fix it up. Log outbuilding behind. Both bldgs, recorded by 
ED, with HM. 
the Pullians — mowing hay at same place, for Knorr Brothers. They operate 
the Massey-Ferguson tractor/mower outfits moving in advance of the Knorrs1 
hay crew working along a day or so behind on mown meadows putting up the 
cut hay. Mowing very difficult, slow here, due to steep hillsides and 
outcrops of granite boulders (this is glacial drift area...). 
— Dale Pullian, father, working with son Allen Pullian. Both live on 
Knorr ranches nearby, and are employed as "ranch hands" by Knorr Bros. Dale, 
c. 50 yrs old, from near Tabernash (Grand Co.) and has worked all over West 
as cowboy, ranch hand; would like his own outfit, and has registered cattle 
krand etc. (see address sheet).

Holzworth Homestead, in Rocky Mt. National Park, near Grand Lake entrance on 
western slope of Continental Divide. This a famous dude ranch of the 
classic period (c. 1900-1930s, and on), founded by German immigrant John 
Holzworth.... Rocky Mt. N. P. operates part of the original ranch as a 
"living history" site (see brochure in misc. notes), but with little 
budget support, no interpreter training, etc. ED, BO notes include critique 
of presentation; this site is only one near to Summit Co. that intends to 
do living historical presentations. 
Grand County Museum, Hot Sulphur Springs. ED, BO critiques. Museum displays 
in old schoohouse; very nice static displays.
