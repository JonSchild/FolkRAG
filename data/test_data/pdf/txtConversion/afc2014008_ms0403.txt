Deaf J01 m:
 
You'll be bappy, I hope, to hear that your grant has already
 
been e
lpt e
nded until April 30, 1978.  All we needed was a
 
letter requesting that action; there are no forms to fill
 
in for a time extension.
 
You might also want to know that the Arts Endowment chairman
 
has the authority to add funds for expenses that were un-
foreseen at the time an applicationawas made, up to 2
43;  of
 
the total grant amount.  Again, what I would rued to initiate
 
this action would be a letter, detailing the f
ees anti just
 
what they were for, we try to keep. forms down to a a
rinJmilka.
 
Anyway, you should feel free to request such additional funds,
 
thougis you might want to wait until closer to the end of the
 
grant period so that you could be sure you had included all
 
unforeseen costs.
 
I hope this helps out.  All the best to you, always, and
 
have a happy New Year.

Dear Alicia,
 
I am very sorry to have kept your paper so long.  It got
 
butied on my desk.  It is a good paper and a good idea.
 
As I said on the phone, its major problem is just organization.
 
How are you coming along anyway?  And all your friends?
 
Please give them all my best, and my wishes for a very happy
 
New Year for you all.  I spoke with your brother, Joe. the
 
other day.  He wanted a reference letter from Ralph Rinzler
 
and I phoned the request over to Sarah.  I hope it got c
lone
 
And in time to be of some helV.

Dear Norm:
 
Enclosed is my ,
proxy.  You will note Uiat I did not vote for
 
myself.
 It seems to me that there might be some appearance
 
of a conflict of interest, if I were to remain on the JEMF
 
Board, since I am now working for an active granting agency
 
to which JL

 I
 
therefore regretfully tender my resignation.
 
On a cheerfuller note, I enclose a copy of the Folk Arts
 
Program which I a

 It's an extre mly inter-
esting job, and I'm enjoying myself thoroughly, so much so
 
that I think I will extend my absence from California yet a
 
while.
 If you have any reactions to the brochure, I would
 
appreciate hearing from you.  In the meantime, please give
 
my best wishes to all my goad friends at UCLAaaEnd to Anne,
 
of course.

l

already used it in a brochure.
 I find it's very effective
 
as a kind of takking-paper, to help tribal people assess
 
just ;

I also enclose several copies of our Folk Arts ,

effort to be responsive to the field, so we can take app-
lications in March, June and September.
 (The official dead-
lines for the next fiscal year will be published in the next
 
couple of monthe).
 
Since we'll be rewriting the guidelines slightly for 1979,
 
if you have any comments on their substance or style, I

would appreciate your giving r

Dear mr. Mannenbach:
 
I am enclosing, for your files, a copy of the letter I sent
 
the Colville tribe upon re--enstating their (rant to active
 
status.  You will notice it includes t
l,e feference to your
 
problem that we agreed upon in our last telephone conver-
sation.
 
Let me assure you t
h at your Indian friend is mistaken.
 I
 
have had only one conversation with
. George Mavis to the rest
 
of my recollection.  This was during the period when I was
 
trying to determine whether or not to hold up the Colville
 
grant, and I simply enquired whether or not you were still
 
on the reservation and still active in the ,
project.
 
Barre `
i
'oelken dic3 raise your problem with we on his return
 
from the site visit he made to Colville.  My co, cent at the
 
time was that I hoped the dispute could be settled locally,
 
since there was little way that I could determine the rights
 
or wrongs of the issue from the east coast.
 I still feel
 
that way, and hope that justice will prevail.  All r
ry c
 onimu-
nications from the Colville tribe have been perfectly ra-
tional, and Barre assures me they are unusually cooperative
 
and fair-minded people as a group.
 
I hgpe your problem is on the way to being settled.
 T ease
 
keep r
ae informed.
 In the event that it r
ai.ght beco w
- nec-
essary for us to enter this situation more actively, I shall
 
forward a copy of all the relative correspondence to our
 
legal office.

written Sra. Nunez that this would be done.  If it takes

Dear Mr. Possumato:
 
As i :
mentioned to you over the phone this morning, the Folk
 
Arts panel reviewed your proposal for the Kiltie Band of
 
York at their recent meeting.  They were interested in the
 
proposal and will be willing to consider an application
 
from you.  This is not a definite c
+as W
 ttment from them
 
that they will be s
tilling to support the funding of your
 
project when it appears in application form, but just an
 
expression of interest.  The panel discussed your proposal
 
in tcras of the more general issue of bri
ng exceptional
 
traditional artists from other countries to the United
 
States to work with artists maintaining the same traditions
 
here.  This has been an interest of the panel in the past,
 
but they have never had an application of this kind to
 
consider.
 
We look forward to getting your application,aad, as always,
 
if you have any further questions, please feel free to call

Dear Srs. Arvizu I
F Camacho:
 
'
hank you for your s
ods
 ly interesting proposals.  I
 
enclose a brochure d
sfbing the focus of the Folk Arts
 
Program and two copies of our application blank . Should
 
you decide to apply to the Folk Arts Program, our next
 
dpplication da dline is January I for projects to be
 
started during the fall.  Please return each application
 
in triplicate, with one copy
 in original typing and siggst�
 
in inks the other two may be carbons or xerooces.
 
I s
hould warn you, x think, that Folk Arts may not be the
 
most appropriate place: for you to apply.  I am not really
 
sure that our advisory panel will feel that the Chicano mural
 
tradition is a "folk" art.  At any rate it should stimulate
 
an interesting d6scussion among the panel mwdx rs.  They may
 
recommend that it go to the Visual Arts Program, whose guide-
lines I also enclose for your use.  Frankly, I don't know
 
what to recommend to you.  Perhaps you would want to take a
 
chance with us and , if our panel turns it down, I could
 
transfer the application for you to the Visual Arts Program.
 
-2-
The Micoonesian film plan is exciting , but I a
n
te unclear as
 
to the traditio
lity of the art form itself.  Please under-
stand this is due to my ignorance of Micronesian culture.
 
Your sentence "The legends will be animated in the style of
 
the traditional art fosto• is unclear to me, I an acquainted
 
with the "story-knife" tradition among the, $akimor do
 
Micronesians tell stories that way?  if s©, I as sure the
 
pane would be especially interested in this idea.
 
Though I think our panel will be extremely impressed by the
 
anthropological thoroughness behind your proposal, they will
 
need to see a s
ample of the film work of your cinematographers.
 
This can be sent in towards the and of January.  Photographs
 
of the murals you intend to document and of the Palauan story-
board artisans would also be helpful backup material.
 
Lastly, Our panel is particularly concerned with dissemination
 
of doctaa ntsl materials.  You should include some indication
 
of how you intend these films, particularly if you can indicate
 
their OutZOSCh beyond the school system itself. The Arts
 
SaM�IM1NIM t t
+ nds to shy away from curriculums development pro-
pp Nels because of the involv ement of both HEK and the Humanities
 
lndowmat in such funding . As a matter of fact, I wonder why
 
you didn't send these proposals directly to the Education
 
Depart m
ent at '
unities?  They certainly would fit there.
 
if you would like to discuss these problems directly, or if
 
any further questions occur to you, please feed,
 free to tele-
phone me or my  associat

Dear Anna:
 
1 am sorry it has taken me so long to get around to a
 
perfectly reasonable niecely request.
 
In the first place, I have enclosed our new guidelines
 
for your interest.  Please let me know what you think
 
of them.  In the second place, Ellen Stekert's address
 
is c/o the Minneapolis Historical Society, 694 Cedar Street,
 
St. Paul, Minnesota  55101.  She wants a resume on you
 
since she is looking for folklorists/anthropologists to
 
work in the Iron Mountain Range in northern Minnesota this
 
next summer.
 I have no idea for how long or how much, but
 
I have been feeding her names of people skilled in working
 
with the particular ethnic groups resident there.  One of
 
them is Italian, so voila.
 
Finally, the name of the man at the 20th Century Fund is
 
John Booth.  They are interested in one year grants for
 
the production of books about American issues.
 I
'm not
 
sure your project would qualify, since you're still basically
 
in school, but you might want to drop him
: a line at least.

 I said I was making up a list of

If you'd enjoy working on such projects, send me a vita 
and indicate in a covering letteriif you'd be interested
 
in being recommended on a short-term basis as well for
 
long-term positions.  We often get requedts for people

Dear Ms. Steinfirst:
 
Thank you so much for inviting me to the School of Library
 
Science's Colloquium, and I accept with pleasure.  I spoke
 
this morning with your associate, whose name,  I regret to
 
say, I forgot to write down.  In any event, she asked
, me
 
to send along a title for the talk and a vita sheet.  The
 
vita is enclosed (
it's Much too long for your use, but I
 
hope you don't mind abstracting what you find most inter-
esting).
 
As for the title, I could give you two depending on which
 
kind of talk you think would be the most interesting.  The
 
film shows traditional black games being played by a group
 
of children on a Los Angeles playground.  I could discuss
 
the poetics or the behavior or both.  One of the striking
 
things about the film is the ease with which the children
 
organize themselves into the activity -- how well they
 
understand and work within their own self-imposed rules.
 
I've written an article on rule behavior in games and titled
 
it "Law and Order on the Playground".
 So that might be one
 
title.  The other suggestion might be "Poetry on the Playground".
 
In that case, I'd talk some about the game behavior but more
 
about the rules of poetics.
 
One final thing that occured to me after I spoke with your
 
associate this morning.  You should send an invitation to
 
your state folklorist -- I bet you didn't know you had one -
--
George Holt.  He can be addressed at the Department of
 
Cultural Resources, 149 East Jones Street, Raleigh, North
 
Carolina  27611.  I know he'd like to comae, and he might
 
have some ideas for that last speaker you wanted to invite.

Dear Alan:
 
In my travels through the wilds of Oklahoma after leaving
 
the Seeger celebration at Berkeley, I somehow managed to
 
misplace the reprint you so kindly gave a
te concerning your

with the various ecumenical types that took you on.  And --
dammit -- I hadn't finished reading it.  Also Sally Yerkovich
 
wants very much to see it.
 
So, could you possibly send n
ee another copy?  It would get
 
to me about three weeks sooner if you addressed it to my

Dear Roland:
 
It so me life every time I sit down to write to you about
 
my trip to Mississippi, you walk in the door and we sit
 
down to talk and I forget for a while that I still haven't
 
gotten the letter out of my typewriter.  I just saw Paula
 
Tadlock this weekend and she told me that you would be in
 
Jackson today.  So I decided to sit down to write that
 
long overdue letter when I was fairly certain that you
 
wouldn't walk in.
 
I
've found that since I
've been traveling a lot this year,
 
often when I return to Washington, the places I
've been,
 
the things that I have se er and the people that I've been
 
with seem so very long ago and far away.  Even though it
 
was a little more than one mouth ago that I went to Jackson
 
for the opening of FOU
MO  . the trip is still very much
 
in my mind.
 
The evening was by far one of the most memorable that I have
 
ever had the privilege of participating in.  From the first
 
glance at your exhibit as I stepped into the Miss. State
 
Historical Museum to the last note of mimic it writ all so
 
very elegant and beautiful.  Every photograph and item in

Thanks very much for your land warm letter.  I wish I had

Dear Holly:
 
in the inter*st of clarifying the project description on
 
your gri tt af
t. R70-54-150), I thowght that I
'd expand on
 
the Polk Arts Panel's intentions babind the wording of
 
your w ard letter.  glee Panel's main concern is that the
 
expertise of the folklore coordinator be up to their stan-
dards.  As such, it is not so vital that Tim Lloyd be that
 
person, but that so MOaa of his calliber hold that position.
 
In the event that Tim s kald be unable to complete the
 
project as folklore coordinator, the grant could certainly
 
continue, but fundigg would be taeporarily delayeduuntil a
 
replacement of suitable
 had been appointed to
 
fill the vacant position.  Panel review would be required
 
but could be handled by telephone within twenty-four hours,
 
as it was when lira came on.  This is the wVy the Panel has
 
instructed me to administer all of our grants i6i.ch support
 
the position of a state folklore coordinator.
 
As always, the Panel's major objective is to ensure that the
 
highest possible level of folkloric expertise is present in
 
a project each as yours.  I know that you concur this is
 
vital to the success of your program.  Please be assured
 
of this office's desire to cooperate in every way in order
 
to attain our mutael goals.

Dear Mr. Dratfield:
 
This is just a guess, but I'd say the two gentlemen are
 
Brownie McGehee  (this is the way he spells it) and Sonny
 
(Saunders) Tarry.
 I'm sorry to say I've forgotten Brownie's
 
correct first name, but I am sure you can find it in one
 
or another reference book.
 
The repooduetion is too blurred to get facial details,  so
 
I am judging basically by the postures, both of which are
 
highly characteristic of sonny and Brownie.  Also I think
 
I can detect that the guitar player's right shoe is built
 
up,  as Brownie's always were.
 In any event,  I would guarantee
 
that neither of them are Josh White.
 
Is this a still from the old O.W.I. movie that included Pete
 
Seeger and Woody Guthrie?  If it is,  it confirms my guess;
 
I know that both Brownie and Son were in that film.  were
 
you the sound man on that project?
 
I hope this is of some help.

Dear David:
 
I had hoped that I would be able to get in touch with you
 
again before I left Columbia, but the pace of activities
 
at the film conferam w seemed to pick up at some point
 
and not to stop.  I feel like I really haven't had a chance
 
to breathe a private breath since I left here last week
 
(
I just returned frds Charleston very early this morning).
 
I enjoyed sewing you again last week and was glad that we
 
at least had Wednesday afternoon to sit dawn for a talk.
 
After we talked, I thought about all of the local fairs
 
that you m wtioned are held in South Carolina.  one possible
 
project you might consider (
or that Lee Knight might be
 
in crested in working on) involves getting traditional
 
artists (musicians, crafts people, etc.) from the immediate
 
area of each fair to perform in thew.  This might involve
 
some field work if Lee hasn't already uncovered the people
 
who would be interested in performing.  And in some areas
 
it might not be possible.  But it is a thought which combines
 
already existing events and the talents of traditional
 
artists.
 
Please keep in touch and let us know how things are progressing
 
in your staSe.  Saes seofs her regards and regret, for not
 
being able to att wd the conference and have a chance to meet
 
with you.  I hope that we might meet again soon.

It was so pleasant to run into you at the Folkiife Festival.
 
I suppose that is really what festivals are for, after all,

I am enclosing several copies of our new brochure.
 I would
 
certainly appreciate your reaction to it.
 You will notice
 
we have limited this program to a single task;  there are,
 
of course, a great many other things that need doing be-
sides, and I ar
, hoping, as soon as this program is firsr

underway,  to begin to address s
o me additional issues.
 in
 
the meantime, as I say,  I would certainly value any com-
ments you might care to make.
 
Should you run across worthy projects which do not fit our
 
program, don't hesitate to encourage the people concerned
 
to apply here anyway by letter or phone.
 I am always happy
 
to help refer projects to other Endowment sections where
 
they will receive a sympathetic review.

Dear Al:
 
Just a note to thank you again for your cordial hospitality

also to the chaixuan of your Arts Council, (

unfortunately neglected to write down and thus have forgotten).
 
I'm enclosing, for your interest, a trip report made by
 
Nick Spitzer, the young man that I spoke to you about.  He
 
was an intern in the Polk Ethnic program over the summer,
 
and the Programs had invited him back to the panel aeeting.
 
Since it was on his way, I asked his to stop by and visit
 
Barry Ancelet's festival in the Lafayette area, and also
 
see what he could do about finding De wy balfa sole kind
 
of local sponsorhip.
 (At the tise we made the arrangement,
 
I had not yet heard that you had arrived in Louisiana).
 
Anyway, I thought you might like to see Nick's forthright
 
and knowledgable report.  He is, it seems to me, someone
 
who you might want to think about in connection with folk-
loric activity in your state.  He knows the Cajun country
 
well, and has visited other areas also.  Just now, he's
 
completing his PhD in Folklore at the University of Texas.

Suggestions for Council session on Spanish-speaking culture
 
Last week, I had an extremely cordial meeting with Profe ssor
 
Rafael Rivera Garcia, newly appointed director of the Office
 
of Cultural Affairs in Puerto Rico.  He was accompanied by
 
Louisa D. Cerar, Intergovernmental Relations Officer of the
 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, who is stationed permanently
 
in Washington.  They were extremely interested in developing
 
folk arts program in Puerto Rico; they understood and approved
 
our program and I look forward to wor
=king with them in the
 
near future.
 
Professor Garcia is himself an artist(a painter) and a highly
 
cultivated gentle=man.  He expresse=d himself elegantly in both
 
English and Spanish.  I would certainly recommend he be in-
vited to attend the Council meeting and to speak on general
 
cultural activities in Puerto Rico.  Should he not be able
 
to arrange another trip to f shington, perhaps Sra. Cerar
 
might be asked to substitutes for him; she apparently acts as
 
his liaison in the United States.
 
R me Lopez, as you probably know, is a member of the Folk/Ethnic
 
panel.  He is of Puerto Rican descent, living in New York, and
 
is himself a leader in the developing popular Afro-Cuban-Puerto
 
Rican music tradition called salsa. I would think he might
 
be invited.
 
Bernie Lopez, director of the Arts Council in New Mexico, is
 
doing one of the best jobs I have seen in servicing a multi-
lingual arts constituency.  Folk Arts has funded several
 
projects there involving Spanish speakers of norther Now Mexico
 
(who consider themselves Spanish-Americans) and those of the
 
southern area (who consider themselves Mexican
 A mericans).
 I
 
strongly recommend that Bernie Lopez be invited to this
 
Council Meeting.

Dear David:
 
It is my fondest hope that I will be sitting at my desk

 This has
 
been a busy summer/fall-and I am tired of packing suitcases.
 
Why not give me a call i
ghen you get in town,  and we can
 
make a definite appointment?
 
I am enclosing a copy of our new program brochure for your
 
interest.  You will notice that we have no way of funding
 
a particular individual to do what he wants to do
 only
 
non profit organizations.  However,  it occurs to mss that
 
your project  (particularly the radio series and/or the
 
documentary film) would fit nicely into the Music Program's
 
"Folk/Ethnic" guidelines.  The latter are under revision and
 
are not yet ready to be mailed outs however, by the time

Thank you for your interesting letter.  I am enclosing a
 
copy of the Folk Arts ;
program description for your informa-
tion.  As you will see, we are focussed on the traditional
 
arts, rather than upon oral history projects per se, though,
 
when one deals with senior members of a traditional couraunity,
 
it's difficult to separate the two.
 
f
� further concern of our advisory panel is whether or not the
 
necessary professional expertise is available to service tradi-
tional projects of the kind you describe.  We would be interested
 
in seeing vitas of the people who mould be owrking in this pro-
gram, and p
is in helping provide you with professional con-
sultants, abould you reclyire such servi ms.
 
I would suggest that you and I try to r
_eet together with pr.
 
Roger Abrahams, of the University of Texas, who will also be
 
attending the conference at the Institute of Texas Cultures
 
in San Antonio September 30 and October 1.  I hope you are
 
planning to attend the conference, and perhaps we can si
.raply
 
connect there.  Otherwise, I shall be staying at the La Quinta
 
motel near the Institute, where you can leave a message for me.
 
I do hope you'll come to the conference, though; I think you
 
would find it interesting and helpful, and as &Sara& I know it
 
is open to any concerned individuals.
 
I shall bring your file with r
oe, and will look forward to
 
meeting you in person.

trip Report
 
Bess Lmmax hawes
 
September 14. Flight to Youngstown, m
eet at airport by Elizabeth
 
Szabo, driven to Hungarian Franciscan monastery retreat house,
 
where Szabo had arranged for me to stay; very quiet, coe
itfortable.
 
Szabo gave me script of film to read and a preliminary budget;
 
studied these materials before succumbing to jet lag.
 
Seotember 15 - 9 a.m.  E. Szabo conference at retreat.  I suggest
 
that the film is not a folk arts project, but primarily a drama-
tized humanistic introdution to concepts of ethnicity.  The
 
script and budget seem commercial.  The script is romantic and
 
simplistic but has, I think, good ideas and basically sound
 
approach.  I suggest that small modifications could improve the
 
effect immensely, for example, cut or modi fy the MGM H Ming,
 
changing the tittle at the same time, thus leaving the viewer
 
ponder the problems and draw U s own conclusions, rather than
 
trying to persuade; all wing more complex issues to be broached;
 
avoiding obviously comm mcial technical devices; cutting composed
 
sound
 k; cutting celebrity narrator; doing all shooting on
 
location, nothing in s
tudio.  Szabo seemed receptive and willing
 
to discuss and consider t
.any of these points.

12:30 p.m. - lunch at IntetTstional Institute Board meeting.
 
I am asked to address the board about NEA and Folk Arts.  Some
 
lively questions and discussion.  .
Toe Webber clarified role of
 
X YC for me; they will use clips from. the finished film and
 
develop 5 - 2 hour panel discussion shows around the
em for the
 
NBC network show "Knowledge".  WKYC will pay all costs of their
 
2
 
production, but nothing for the original film
s except one day
 
of cr ew time contributed as in-kind.  PBS arrangements are
 
similar, with no money feeding back into the project..
 
1:30 p.m. - back at T
dYSU for detailed budget discussion with
 
Szabo, Mall. and Gerber.  Budget is not out-of-line for a
 
hi
quality commercial product, but do they really need so
 
much quality?  Studio editing facility rents for about $150/hr.
 
(the such better facility at U.11a
.ss is less expensive, $70/hr).
 
I sugQ•sttd areas where the cost/quality trade-off might be
 
worth c
on sidering.  Much discussion, ugesions about appropriate
 
funding sources.  I gather that despite the clear indication
 
that Folk Arts can't fund it, they'll come in with a proposal
 
anyhow, it only to have us refer it to a more likely source.

Dear 5ister,Marguerite:
 
I i
augt first apologize for taking so very long to answer your
 
kind note.
 Frankly, the difficulty was that I haven't quite
 
known what to rasx
 d to you.  You will see, from the Folk
 
Arts program description that I enclose for your interest,
 
that we do not fund the work of independent se
 ars , unless
 
their activity is simply supplemental to a c
exa mnity based
 
project in the traditional arts.  The National Endowment on
 
the Humanities is the place to amply for an independent grant
 
and the competition there for non-university-affiliated re-
search workers is simply terrible.
 
However, I have been discussing your needs with Dennis Wilson
 
at the Maine Council on the '
Arts, as well as with Debora
 
Waldman, who has been doing research similar to yours in
 
Rhode Island for some years.
 '
hat I hope to be able to arrange
 
is for Miss Waldman or some equivalent scholar to pay you a
 
visit in Sinclair and work with you on developing a specific
 
program for Acadian studies in norther Maine for which funding
 
can probably be found, both within and outside the state.
 
in the wenatime, it would be very helpful if you could send
 
a copy of the book you told me you had edited for the bi-
lingual progr m in the Caribou schools either to me or to
 
Dennis Wilson, Snecutive Director, State douse, Augusta,
 
Maine  04330.
 
Probably it would be better to send it to 1
4r. Wilson, as I
 
think he will probably wind up co-ordinating these various
 
efforts.
 It would help us if we knew something of the sesults
 
you have already achieved.

Dear Mr. Carlson:
 
Thank
. you for your letter of inquiry.  I am enclosing for
 
your information a copy of our newly--revised guidelines.
 
I think if you read through th em carefully, you will be
 
able to determjne for yourself whether or not your proj-
ect falls into our area of i
 nterest.  The crucial question
 
for us is the make-up of your Sacred Harp groups.  If they
 
consist solely of young people who are "reviving" the tra-
dition, our reviewing panel would probably not feel your
 
project would have very high priority.
 (There has been'
 
very little docilm.-ntation of the original tradition, and
 
I believe they would feel that should be done first.)
 
However, I have myself heard of active Sacred i
iarp groups
 
transplanted froin the Ozark and deep Southern regions into
 
southern California.  If you're in touch with some of
 
-those, or perhaps want to compare then with the younger
 
groups, that might be a project of interest to this pro-
grala.
 
I w
ii further enclosing a copy of the Jazz/Folk/kthnic
 
Music program guidelines.  You will see that their grogram
 
is not as focussed on the root tradition as is ours.  You
 
might, therefore, want to apply through thew, although
 
their application dates are not as convenient as ours.
 
Tt also seems to we you should think over carefully your
 
o
c� of documentation.  Is it really essential to do
 
Mr. Patrick Carlson
 - 2 -
 September 6, 1977
 
this through a visual mediums  If so, you should consider
 
your proposed budget with great care; videotape always
 
looks as though it will be inexpensive, but we've found th
 
that a high quality videotape nearly always requires expe n-
sive processes that aren't contained in in the original
 
cost estimate.
 
Lastly, "
 t a personal recommendation, I think you
 
might do wall to consult an ethnomusicologist, before you
 
get too far in your planning.  David Kirkpatrick, a pro-
fessor of ethnamusioclogy at the University of California,
 
is a friend of nine and I an
, sure would be glad to be of
 
assistance, if you'd like to look him up.
 Please don't
 
consider this a rust: it's just a I
-ersonal suggestion.
 
if either I or my assistant, Sally Yerkovich, can be of
 
additional help, please don't hesitate to call us person-
to-person collect at 202/634-6020, and we will return your
 
call on the vented lane.  Good luck with your planning.

Thanks for your letter.  it is nice to be in touch.

Maine . M ere are :
lots of French folks in Now Eryjland, and
 
they are simply delighted to hear that their own Music is
 
still going on in so many sections of the country.  We're
 
paying for a film to be made of one of the last of the
 
old Beale Street blues singers.  We're helping one of the
 
best of the Sacred Hate song leaders to smart singing
 
schools in several Georr�ia counties.  And on and on.
 
Why don't you figure out what part of your activities would
 
come into our area, and let us help with that?  we can't
 
fund all of your many activities, but we could help out
 
with the strictly old-timey parts, especially fees to the

Dear Alice and Cece:
 
Thank you for your proposal.
 It looks really interesting.
 
i
 
I am enclosing a copy of our newly revised guidelines for
 
your information as well as some application blanks.  Try
 
to yet the blanks filled in and sack to us by our next
 
deadline, October 1.  If funded, this would mean you could
 
tart your project next spring.
 
You should return three copies of the blank, one of which
 
should be the original and oontain original signatures in
 
ink; the other two can be carbons or xeroxes.  I
'd blso
 
suggest you keep a copy for yotmr own records.
 
Now that the formalities are out of the g
ray, I see two pro-
blems:
 first, we do not have a category for individual
 
grant requests.  You need to find a sponsoring organiza-
tion which has an up-to-date IRS status letter.
 You might
 
want to consider the National Council on the Traditional
 
Arts.
 Better yet might be approaching the North Carolina
 
Arts Council (North Carolina Department of Cultural Re-
sources, Raleigh, North Carolina  27611).  They might even
 
have a bit of money to contribute, and you should ask
 
about that.
 You may find them reacting against people
 
coming in for funds from out of the state-
, I' d a Mbs- A
 se
 
Les Blan es,  (
 not tommention your) reputation in the U & M
 
in an attempt to counteract that.
 
The second problem is budgetary.
 In the first place, you
 
have very little real cash to t
aut up, and I always worry

Dear Mr. Russell:
 
I am enclosing the guidelines from the Folk Arts program for
 
your interest.
 I shall also include the guidelines from the
 
Folk/Ethnic Music program in case you decide to apply there.
 
The ppincipal distinction between the two programs is that
 
the Folk/Sthnic Program has an individual grant program,
 
while we in Folk arts require that grants come in from
 
a non-profit organization.
 
There are several things you might want to consider about
 
your proposal wherever you send it.  For one thing, you
 
really don't discuss what you will do with the material you
 
propose to collect in terms of public distribution.
 
Generally, the Arts endowment does not support grants for
 
scholarly purposes alone; such projects should be presented
 
to the National Endowment for the Humanities.
 
It further seems to we that spending a year collecting 50
 
tunes from a gentlemen who is 85 years of age is an extremely
 
poor plan.  The total cost of your project, assuming you have
 
an equal match, as you indicate, is $12,000.  Unless this
 
gentleman has an absolutely priceless repertoire, this seems
 
to me an enormous amount of money to expend for relatively
 
slight results, particularly since you include no costs for
 
distribution via recordings, public media and the like.
 
Frankly, I should advise you to cut this budget drastically,
 
speed up the time factor, and consider applying for local
 
funding through the Indiana Arts Council or through some
 
local organization such as the Folklife Center of the Ohio
 
Halley or the like.  You must remember that when you come
 
Mr. Mark Russell

to the federal government you are in competition with every-
body else in the entire nationf local projects of the type
 
you are considering often have a much better chance for
 
state or local funding.

Dear Mrs. Tannehill:
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to answer your letter.
 
As you pointed out during our pleasant conversation in
 
Jackson, your needs are not for direct funding but for
 
advice and counsel.  However, as I look over the materials
 
you sent me, the scope of the Neshoba County Fair seems
 
so vast and its activities so varied I wouldn't know how
 
to start advising you without experiencing the entire
 
operation directly.
 
I wonder if we couldn't send an observer from the Folk
 
Arts Program down to next summer's fair who might, on the
 
basis of direct experience, consult with you later as to
 
how tra "ttonal arts might be more effectively presented?
 
As I mentioned to you, I believe Joe Wilson, Director of
 
the National Council on the Traditional Arts, might be
 
the person most qualified to be of helpf however, as the
 
time gropes nearer, we can settle on exactly who might be
 
available for this service.  The Folklife Center at the
 
Library of Congress, for example, might be able to send
 
one of its consultants.
 
Perhaps, if this plan suits you, you might let s
ae have the
 
dates for next summer's Fair, so that I can put it on my
 
calendar, and we can sonsult later on as to the haws, whos
 
and whens.

Dear Mr. Smiths
 
Thank you for lasting us know that you will be applying

a copy of our application forms for you to return to us
 
for the January deadline.
 
Since we haven't received your more detailed proposal,
 
I
'd like to make a few s
 stio s based on my visit to
 
your festival last su mac.  amt. I feel, is especially
 
important since you imation than you plan to add another
 
evening concert to your schedule.  I would suggest that
 
instoa►d of a master of I -rs m
onies (or in addition to one)
 
you have a presenter for the concerts _
w
 same me who can
 
point out to the audiences some of the differences in the
 
styles of the performers and who can give them sosw background
 
information about the artists.  This person should not be
 
overly didactic, but can just help both the audience and the
 
performers themselves through a B ooth performance.  They
 
can point pout the uniqueness of styles and the ways that one
 
artist differs from another because of the area that he is
 
from or the people that he learned his art from.  A presenter
 
who knows the performer's r
"rtoire can help him decide what
 
to play (rather than leaving the decision for the last minute
 
on stage or to a piece of paper which so easily gets lost or
 
misplaced in a pocket) and both reminding the performer of
 
it and talking about it on stage.  This is *specially helpful
 
when you are dealing with tr& Mttonal performers who are not
 
used to =
living staged perfozxances.
 
If you are considering adding sole t
au musicians, you might
 
want to contact Barry Ancilet (Center for Acadian and Creole
 
Folklore, University of Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette,
 
Louisiana 7050 0  (
318) 233-3854, ext. 471) who has done a great

both in presenting and
 
and performers.

A final note -
-- the panel is very concerned that there be
 
adequate field work and presentation at festivals and they
 
welcome the addition of fees for the people involved with
 
these activities should you want to add them to the budget
 
but are concerned that they might increase your costs too
 
much.
 
If there are any questions or problems, please feel free
 
to call either Bess Lomax Hawes or n

Dear Mr. Tonasket:
 
I am in receipt of your letter of November 16, 1977.  Based
 
on the information contained in this letter and on Barre
 
Toelken's report of a site visit t
rade to the Colville Con-
federated Tribes November 20-22, I &a
, happy to give you of-
ficial notification of the reinstatement of your grant,
 
R70-54-12.
 
u
 
i
 
Since, in terms of the Folk Arts Program, yours is a very
 
large grant, and sinee we regard the project as a possible
 
model for other Native American tribal groups, I would ap-
preciate your keeping this office informed of developments
 
in your work as frequently as possible.  in fact, with your
 
permission, I shall probably smfsd
. Dr. Toelken and/or other
 
qualified observers for additional site visits as the grant
 
period progresses.
 I shall, of course, write or phone you
 
about :
such projected visits, in order that they can be
 
scheduled at convenient times.  I also hope that you and
 
Mr. Redthunder will feel free to call upon either Dr. Toelken
 
or me in case technical or other problems arise.
 
For example, in most of our documentation grants, we strongly
 
recommend that two copies be made of each tape or other sig-
nificant documents, one to be held in the tribal archives
 
and one to be deposited under appropriate safeguards in a
 
separate institution such as the Library of Congress, the
 
Mr. Mel Tonasket

Smithsonian or a local university.  Perhaps you would want
 
to consider making arrangements for protection copies of
 
material collected through this grant.
 (
Should you decide to
 
do this, you can, of course, limit public access in any s
can-
ner you wish.)
 There have been tragic cases in the past of
 
losses by dire or other accidents.  You might want to con-
sider this problem during the next months.
 
Lastly, f understand that during the period of confusion
 
that precipitated our action of holding up your grant monies,
 
certain persons who had been working on the project did not
 
receive full payment due.
 I am certain that thi
s Colville
 
Tribes, now that the grant monies are again available, will
 
a
wake early and just settlements of any monies due to indi-
vidual project workers.
 
Again, please be assured of the Polk Arts Program's earnest
 
desire to be of assistance to the Colville Confederated
 
Vribes in your attempt to document and retain your tradi-
tional arts for the lasting benefit of present and future
 
generations.

Folk Arts travel budget
 
11/22/77
 
The Folk Arts Program is in difficulties with our travel
 
budget . The fall is a particularly busy period for us, as
 
there are two essential academic meetings that must be cov-
ered , and we hove a panel meeting scheduled for l
GaMphis,
 
Tennessee , in December, requiring two staff members to
 
travel there . We have already
 s w o
ral additional
 
site visits to important confererma M M d projects.
 
I am embarrassed not to be able to give you exact figures,
 
but we have already obligated $1800, and we still must cover
 
two trips to Houston , Texas (approximate cost $890) and two
 
trips to Memphis (approximate cost $700).
 
I am quite sure we have not actually spent $1800 , since two
 
of the trips already taken were significantly s
horter than
 
originally planned.  However , Travel has been extremely slow
 
in returning our travel vouchers, and thus a lot of our monies
 
are tied up without a clue as to how much has actually been
 
disbursed . Is there anything you can do to expedite thds7  I
 
am beginning to worry that they will not get back to us before
 
the end of the quarter, and thus our funds will not be de-obli-
gated and we 'll lose them.
 
Here is a synopsis:
 
Trips taken : 10/7-15 TN, S.C.
 
11/1-6  Ohio/Mich
 
11/2-8  Mich/Ind

$1680
 
A final note:  I spoke to someone in the Budget office when
 
I first received your estimated figures, explaining that we
 
did not need the esti mtes allowed us for "Consuftan
nt travel"
 
and "Other travel" (
a
escanaetix
 together to $3,000 for the year),
 
since we have coent M at WANLIA s taken ft M program funds to
 
cover such expenses.  I was told then that I could transfer
 
that monies to staff travel, and that is why I have been
 
scheduling So many trips:.  I understand I was misinfosmedl
 
that I cannot switch between categories.  However, you night
 
as well give that money to another needy program, as we will
 
not be using it.
 
V d really appreciate anythfng you can do to help us out of
 
this hole.  Folk Arts is a yoeng and small program= we make
 
every attee Wt to use consultants to cover our essential travel
 
needs (
mhich is why a
rea set up our own consultancy fund) , but
 
there are many occasions when only staff will do.

Dear Bill:
 
Mclosed you will find the aganda for the upcoming Folk Arts
 
panel meeting in Memphis,  Plea " feel free to attend any
 
part of it you find time for.  I don't know about reimburse-
ment; if you find you can e me, why not give Rob Gordon a
 
call and see if Music can pi ck up your hotel bill or whatever.
 
if that fails, let to know.
 
We do not have as many applit
tions this go-round as I had
 
expected, so there should be aa ogh time, for once, for a
 
good policy discussion.  our n wt weet
.ing, judging by the
 
proposals that are now coming in, should be a madhouse, but
 
this go--round should be relatively calm.

Dear Mr. Mayes:
 
You will be happy to hear that the application from the Adult
 
Learning Center of the Spokane Tribe for a project to provide
 
indigenous arts and crafts class:: for adults on the Spokane
 
reservation has been
 for funding by the Folk Arts
 
panel and the National Coa eil on the Arts.
 
However, the Folk Arts grants officer, hiss Karen Sulzberger,
 
tells me that the project director originally named in the
 
grant application, your former Adult Education Director,
 
Clyne Lynn, is no longer on the reservation.
 Since that is
 
the case, I must request a letter from you, or another author-
ized official of the f
i
kokane tribe, containing the name of
 
the new project director and a resume of his or her qualifica-
tions for the position.
 
Please understand that the Folk Arts program is anxious to be
 
of service to the Spokane tribe.  However, we are also responsi-
ble for seeing to it that grant monies are administered by
 
qualified individuals who are knowledgable in the area of the
 
traditional arts.
 
I
,afor your files, enclose a copy of the grant application
 
and the supporting information written us by Clyde Lynn.  I
 
2-
will look forward to hearing from you soon, and will
 
initiate action on your grant as s
cam as 2 do.

Please fill in a d

need simply to 4

I will then take this application to our Folk Arts panel four

Dear A
ir. Dewhurst :
 
I am writing to atte
Wt sn explanation and apology for the
 
really inexcusably sloppy handling by the Folk Arts Program
 
of your application to support the exhibit "Rainbows in the
 
Sky 
The history, as I r
e
struct it, is as follows.  Our Program
 
supported the initial research phases of your work.  You applied
 
they following year for support of the exhibit phase.  The Polk
 
Arts panel looked at the research results submitted and con-
cluded that you were not dealing with folk arts in our very
 
restricted sense of the teas.  The panel has wrestled with
 
the issues of "naive" and "popular" arts for a long time and
 
W w fina&Iy concluded that, since our budget is so small, we
 
a
aast confine: ourselves rigidly to the limited definition of
 
folk arts the enclosed brochure atte
sts to explain.
 
O w pa wl, therefore* rejected your second application, and I
 
amde a m mtaj
. note (
the very worst ki wi) to suggest that you
 
apply to the f
f
itseeums Program, which has from time to time sup_
 
ported the kind of wide-ranging exhibit you proposed.
 
At our next deadline, we received another application from you
 
for the same project.  in trying to figure out why you had
 
re-applied I had our files searched and discovere d your letter
 
of en
tluiry dated May 31, 1977 which I had never seen and thus
 
had not anwasr
ead.  I do not have the l ust idea how this alir
.--
up occurred *ad can only tall you that I will make every effort
 
-2-
not to lot it happen again to anybody else.  M d Z seen
 
the letter, I would have ans wered it with the e
etplanati =
 
given abov
+*, and would have re
 WF W W  that you apply to
 
the I
mes Program, the guidelines to ~Lich I enclose
 
for your i
.nfoxmstic
an and use.
 
Your third application then arrived and thuse had to be
 
dealt with by the Folk Arts panel, which rejected it again.
 
it we simply bad stuff wozc, and I apologize.  The panel
 
c
a
 r
ated that it was an interesting application but not
 
within our guidelines t therefore I
 have this c
lay signed a
 
rejection letter addressed to Mr. Grider of Michigan State
 
tf
tivmrsity.
 
Z do b "s tbv* towdiap can be found, either locally or

Dear Miss A
d mrts:
 
Thank you for your letter.  I enclose a progr
 description
 
Of the Folk Arts Program.  You will s
ame that we comfi
.ne our
 
f
unding entirely to the most traditio m' art forms.  I
cy sense
 
of your project is that it would be m b
o wider th m our prog-
ram would be able to fund.  We are a =all progs r and have
 
therefore had to limit ourselves stsim
mtly to the =at urgent
 
problems.
 
I would suggest that you conadder applying to the Chin State
 
Arts Council which has recently set up a new program for
 
funding arts projects in ethnic and ad writy communities.
 
Tim Lloyd (
Ohio Arts Council, 50 Weft xxoad Street, suite 2640,

to you.  It is often easier for individuals to get local fund-
inf; the competition is very stiff for federal m6nies, since
 
you're going up against the ebels Country.

ran
 — -
 you.  I don't believe they'va gotten far along
 
e ux gb with the physical plant they 're putting up th

so f!Y as I know# have therefore not started interviewing
 
staff. But a W rd from Rtye Virginia has a lot of poorer.

Dear Mr. Jones:
 
I am taking the liberty of sending you, unsolicited, a
tater-
ials on the internship program at the National I
t for
 
the Arts.  Unless you intend to move straight into university
 
teaching after your dog no is completed, I sbould think three
 
months in M ahl "ton might be a usefull e
aq  A  me for you.
 
You are, of course, wildly over-qualified.
 , the
 
internship would allow you to explore the funding operations
 
of several govexonesital agencies, and it is not conducted on
 
an urAergraduate m
il.  Most interns are about your age
 
range, smatly at the M.A. stage, and the program would give
 
you an opportunity to meet a number of interesting people
 
involved with the arts and the humanities at a high level.
 
The set-up is that you vox* half-time directly in a program
 
(
such as Folk Arts or Music) and half in a series of seminars
 
designed to acquaint you with the funding operations of other
 
institutions, various issues in arts management and the like.
 
m
ay, I thought you conceivably might be interested.  I ant
 
holdl
 your resume in my file and will get in touch immedi-
ately if any position comes up that you might be interested
 
in.  By the way, it would be helpful to know if you are
 
planning to go directly into teaching or if you would prefer
 
to look for a job in the public sector.  I got so interested
 
in talking with you about your dissertation that I forgot to
 
ask youi

our guidelines confine us to the direct support of traditional

I do have a few inaomediste suggestions.  First, I strongly
 
"go you to get in touch with san#y Ives at the University
 
of !
Maine in connection with your equipment problem.  H
-M
 
might be able to give you some practical help, and he
n's
 
right on the spot.  A second possibility might be to apply
 
to the rolklife Center at the Library of Congress; they
 
have an w pipment loan
s program.
 
second. I should write or call Denny Wilson, director of the
 
Maine Arts Council, State m use, Augusta, Maine  04339
 
(
247) 289-2724.  The state a
rg me4 es are usually able to work
 
a bit more swiftly tha n the iedaral .  I do Not know if the
 
Mblue Arts Council has a program to fund ree Wwcah projects
 
vach as yours , but Mr« Wilson or his assistant, Dennis Fiore,
 
a m intelligent falks, and they can giv =
 you so n suggestions,
 
I i  sure.  It is p m ibl
 e
t, for a
m ple,  that the Maine
 
a
mities council might be the place you should go.
 
My first auggestion -- calling on San dy Ives -
-- is really my
 
best,  I think . sandy is a member of the Arts w
ent
 
l
r
'olk Arts panel and besides is tha
t asst distinguished folk-
lorist currently active in the area in which you are working.
 
Ais archives are ammag the best state collections that I have
 
seen, and you should be all means be aware of his work and
 
he of yours.

I write in haste to thank you again
, for the lovely evening
 
at your home, the delicious dinner.  Please give your
 
charming wife and daughters my warmest regards, and tell
 
them if everythey (or you, of course) come to Washington,
 
it would be my  very deep pleasure to try to return your
 
hoppitality.
 
I have been thinking about your project with the Turkish-
American center in Chicago, and recalled a similar project
 
which contained an idea you might find interesting.  We
 
received a proposal from  a small was o m in Hawaii dealing
 
with Japanese culture.  '
Their idea was to mount an exhibi-
tion of things that Japanese immigrants had brought with
 
them from their home--land -
-- those small probably strongly
 
symbolic objects that they had troubled to carry with them
 
to their new home.
 it occurred to me that you might be
 
interested in a similar exhibit from among your Turkish-
American friends -- possibly it could be contrastid with
 
articles that they had made here?
 
Anywamy & an you can tell, I am very excited about your proj-
ect and want to help any way I can.
 I cannot r
i
mer whether
 
or not I go
rge you a copy of our formal application blank, so
 
I will enclose one with this letter.  I still recommend that
 
you send us a description of the project as it actually develops
 
along with a suggested budget before you fill out the form,
 
so that Sally Yerkovich and I can c
onsult with you about the
 
details; but at least you can see what the form looks like
 
ahead of time.

Dear Norman:
 
I have two suggestions for you, one of which you nay
 
already have explored.  Relatively small grants such as
 
Yours (
I guess love really g me into bureaucracy in a
 
bi=7 way when I think of $5,3 W as a "relatively = mll
 
grant") can often be handled n
r
e swiftly and easily
 
on a state
s level.
 
Let me s
ti
nt l m call up Dennis Fiore or Danny wilson at
 
the Mains Arts agency, Stato Mouse, Augusta, Maine  04330
 
(
207) 289-2724.  they may refer you to the State humanities
 
council but they could tell you who to call there and it's
 
worth a try.  Ordinarily the state agencies move in a less
 
ponderous fashion than the federalsE.
 
if this doesn't work# I would recom mend you address a letter
 
of enquiry to Mr. Mil donnon, Research Division, National

 for the MMONnities.  That program funds independent
 
scholarly research projects.
* of course, the corpetition is
 
extrevsly stiff, but I do think you would have a good chance
 
there.  they are, however. relatively slaw.
 
I wish we could offer you direct help, but the Arts d

Dear Frank:
 
How nice to bear from you again.
 I hope all is go Wjg well

A
 thank you so much for your Rind wishes for me on this
 
VWw job.
 It is indeed exciting and :
stimulating  -- lots of
 
interesting problems every single day, and as you know, I
 
like things that are fast-moving.
 
I'm enclosing a copy of our program, description.  You will
 
notice that we've defining our area of concern very narrowly,
 
but I am in hopes of developing a program next year that will
 
take in a wider territory.  The traditional folks that we
 
are focussing on right now N O W to us the most urgent
 
pxx *lem, so we're setting up to help theca out as quickly
 
and as soon as we can.  However, there are certainly other
 
areas I hope we can eventually expand to -- especially the
 
"high" ethnic arts and the now musics that are developing
 
in the ethnic cos  unities.
 If you run across good stuff,
 
please put the folks in touch with me, whether or not they
 
fit our program.
 I might have some suggestions for other
 
kinds of support they could qualify for.
 
Please keep in touch, and especially be sure to let me know
 
where you are if you decide to a we.  You might also tell your
 
friends, the Sults, that I k= w som e people they might want
 
to get in touch with in 4regan if they carry out their plan
 
to move there.  Just drop me a line at the address on the

202)634-6424, and
 
person-to-pere m collect, and I
'll return the call on

we.

written supporting  (or opposing) the idea, and you can
 
let me know if you would like us to xerox any for you.

that you get in touch with the California Arts Council.

Dear Joel,
 
Thank you for your letter concerning a project dealing with
 
the verbal art of the Cuna.
 The Folk Arts program at the
 
Endowment does not support projects which focus solely on
 
research but instead is concerned with those projects which
 
result in the support of performance and documentation of
 
the performance of traditional arts.
 The program description
 
which I'm enclosing clearly outlines the kinds of things
 
which Uie panel has chosen to fund
..
 If your project falls
 
within our gaitdelines, we would be happy to consider a pro-
posal from you.
 For a project which c
lears primarily with
 
research,  I'd suggest trying the Bumanities Endowment (pro-
gra.m description also enclosed) .
 
Please feel free to write us again with any questions you
 
might have and also with any reactions to our program des-
cription.
 It's relatively new and Bess Lomax Hawes,  the
 
program director,  and I are interested in feedback about it.

Dear Guy and Candys
 
I am awfully sorry to have missed
 
and at the Foxfire board :m
eeting.
 
that weekend; I thought I had the
 
bed, I decided it wasn't a bug at
 
seeing you in North Carolina
 
I just plain old wore out
 
flu, but after two days in
 
all, I was just tired.
 
Concerning the proposal for the conference, it se ws to me
 
you have it a bit the wrong way round.  My feeling is that
 
the panel would be less interested in supporting a conference
 
of local facilitators than a conference of representatives of
 
ity colleges interested in initiating folk arts activities
 
on their canpuses.  This wouldn 't mean that some "facilitating"
 
t ,w shouldn't be invited, but that the thrust should be to
 
got institutional people there and try to get them to commit
 
to starting a program wben they get back l bs.  I realize that
 
this is a more difficult organizing problem, and would require
 
your, or somebody else 's doing a
gorae visiting at the various
 
u
ses to try to raise interest, but it s uns to me a sounder
 
e
1ppA-0ish . This sounds too much like just a bunch of old friends
 
getting together.
 
I
•m willing to be argued with , but, if I read the panel right,
 
I think that's what they' d feel.
 
Another suggestion:  if you still want to do this, I
'd suggest
 
working up something of a proposed agenda for inclusion with
 
your application . That would help both you and the panel
 
clarify the purpose of the conference , and would certainly
 
strengthen the application.

Dear Roger:
 
I am enclosing three batches of materials, corresponding to
 
the three stages of our adventures with the Eastern Illinois
 
University.
 Stage one:
 their original grant request, which
 
we funded.
 Str
ip; two:
 their second year grant request whie
 h 
we did not fund.
 Stage three;
 their current application
 
which the panel voted to defer until a site visit could be
 
made.
 
You are undoubtedly clever enought to figure out the series
 
of events all by yourself, but I'll sketch it in just as a
 
guide through the maze.
 
In stage one, we originally decided to fund for two reasons:
 
EIU s uns to function as a center for a significant region
 
and there was lfttle else folkloric doing on thereabouts; also
 
they planned to use field workers from Indiana, and we felt
 
that Indiana might even keep an eye out on the project ( I
 
now know better).
 Indiana simply sent a bunch of graduate
 
students over there and L
i = (via Dean Jaenecke) hired sowne and
 
put them to work.
 Whatever they turned up in the field was
 
delivered up unto Dean V. and the students went home.
 Simple.
 
We reaped the harvest of this in stage two.  The second year
 
application was turned down by the panel because of the low
 
duality of both tapes and pictures submitted as evidence of
 
the success of the project.  The notes for that meeting
 
slate bleakly that "the duality of documentation was not up
 
to professional standards and the panel felt the dignity of
 
the people being documented was at stake"/I recall Aenry
 
Glassie being particularly outraged.
 
We sent them a standard rejection letter (which includes no
 
information whatever except that you didn't make it) and the
 
grapevine began to work immediately.
 First came a ringing
 
-2-
defense of his field work from one of the Indiana graduate
 
students -- Jens Lund -- who said none of theca had been con-
sulted by the Dean about whet to include in the final report
 
turned in by the University and that Bean .
7. had make tech-
nically poor copies of A
rens' tapes and photos without his
 
knowledge.  Further, Dean J. arrived in r
ay office post-haste
 
to find out in person what the problem was.
 
I told him the documentation sent tbethe panel had been of
 
door quality and he was much embarrassed and said it had all
 
been his fault.  I tried to use this as an occasion to point
 
out to him that there
 
Mr  professional standards in the
 
field and that he should at least brine in a professional
 
consultant from an institution such as Cooperstown or the
 
like.  He got pretty defensive, said that they were putting
 
up an entire building to house their folk arts collection,
 
and that they had enough expertise on their own faculty to
 
handle all the activities (folk arts museum, folk arts do*
 
monstrations in the museum, arts festival, staal) them
isel ves.
 
I continued to suggest that exactly because theft program
 
was so ambitious, they should hire some fall-time qualified
 
help.  The ;
meeting ended with a lively discussion on the
 
differences between folk and naive art (he has, of cour se,
 
got both and tzough I personally don't care much about that
 
particular distinction one way or the other, the panel does,)
 
Next arrived packet #3 (their current application).  You rill
 
note that it contains no significant change in their method-
ology or their aims, nor did they take my hint to hire a t
 
friendly neighborhood folklorist.  Furthermore, we got an
 
unsolicited letter from an "unamed folklorist"  (actually, it
 
was Burt Feintuch, but we didn't want to include his name
 
in the panel book copy) hinting again that all was not well
 
with the project.  At that point, the panel threw up their
 
hands and said to defer until a site visit from somebody who
 
know something about something.  So I naturally called you.
 
A
shen you've had a chance to plow through all this, r
_
iive me
 
a ring and I will call Dean Jaenecke and introduce you.  You
 
can then get in touch with him yoursesld and make your own
 
arrangements for a visit.  Our only time problem is that a
re
 
need to hear from you before the panel meeting, which begins
 
Dece mber 9.  Acturally, they have clearly collected some nice
 
stuff;  our basic q
-uestion is, is it beiag well handled;
 are
 
the relations with the folks clean (releaees and the like):
 
and is there anybody at Eastern Illinois wbo is couepetent to
 
run the project? (If not, will they get somebody who is.)

Finally, the National Counciloon the Traditional Arts (the

money with which you will be paid.  The lady in charge
: of
 
money is Les Udall;
 she is competent and bright (sloe's Stuart
 
Udall's wife), and you should have no difficulty with her.  She
 
knows you are going, so she'll ex act to hear from you.  You
 
can either make all the arrangements yourself and send her the
 
bills, or, is you want a prepaid ticket, you can call her and
 
she, will make the arraggementrs (202/296-0068).1
 
Z hope this trip turns out to be a bit of fun as well an work.

Dear Jim:
 
Thank you so much for your invitation to attend the first
 
meeting of your newly established folk arts panel, if I
'm
 
describing it correctly.
 
Unfortunately, I will not be able to ba there personally,
 
but I have taken the liberty of transferring your invitation
 
to my associate , Sally Yerkovich, who is an extremely compe-
tent folklorist and is, besides, a g
ood deal prettier than
 
I am.  Seriously, I think you will find her very helpful.
 
Sally has called your office and gotten the necessary direc-
tions; she'll fly :
in early in the morning of November 1 for
 
the day.  From there, she'll probably .
leave for the American
 
Folklore society meetings in Detroit, fitting in a site visit
 
en route.
 (This is by way of assuring you that your office
 
won't have to take care of her.)
 
In case you haven 't seen them yet, I
'm enclosing a copy of
 
our nearly revised program description and application foria5.
 
?lease let me know what you think of theca.

Dear Denny:
 
Sally and I met with Betty Smith for a couple of hours last
 
week.  Unfortunately, I was called out on an emergency -- as
 
you can imagine, things are not noticeably tranquil around
 
here, being between Chai =AM3 -- so she and Sally had to
 
finish the meeting without us.
 
I thought Miss Smith was an impressive person.
 I think she
 
will do a highly competent job of assembling the necessary
 
demographic data:  she clearly is a good researcher and she
 
has a good idea of what's needed.
 
I would not
 rsCOss nui her, however, to do the actual community
 
contact work that will eventually be necessary.  She would
 
scare the folks to death, and she is so forthright that I
 
suspect she would get community leaders' backs up.  This is
 
a delicate area and negotiating skills are required.  For
 
s
t
ele, I suspect her assessment of the problem with the
 
Heritage: folks in Lewiston is absolutely accurate; however,
 
I doubt that she is the person who ought to be handling that
 
particular situation.  A good: diagnostician is not necessarily
 
a good physician.
 
if I were you, I would put her to amassing and organizing the
 
XM&*sials required in order to put together a state folk arts
 
program that would make some sense.  Then I would call in
 
specialists, as you and I discussed, to work with particular
 
ethnic groups and the like, as needed.  They could arrive
 
z
 much better prepared if they had Betty's files to consult.
 
One other point occurs to me:  sometimes it's strategically
 
valuable to have outsiders come in, and sometimes it's not.
 
There is a certain implied compliment in bringing in Prof. X,
 
that widely-known specialist in the field? on the other hand,
 
it can be intimidating.  When I talked with Debbie Waldman
 
the other day, she mentioned certain scholars in French and
 
French Canadian folk arts who are now resident in Maine.
 
I didn't write their names down, but perhaps you or Betty
 
Smith ought to find tb w out from her.
 
Finally, I
'm writing this at Betty's own suggestion.
 I
 
didn't say all this to her directly, but I wouldn't mind if
 
you wanted to show it to her.  As I say, she's an impressive
 
and obviously highly competent ladyt I'll leave that up to
 
you.
 
Please let me know if either Sally or I can be of any possible
 
further help.

Dear Debbie,
 
It was awfully good to meet you over the phone this after-
noon.
 I am enclosing the materials from the Vermont Council
 
on the Arts application which seem relevant to your visit
 
there -- some are from projected plans for this year and
 
some are information on what happened last year so if they
 
seem to be muddled, they are.
 
For travel arrangements (a pre-pain ticket can be arranged
 
in something like 48 b urs), you should call Joe Wilson
 
(or Lee Udall) at the National Council on the Traditional
 
Arts (1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.6:., Washington, D.C. 21036;
 
212/296-1168).  We will alert them that you will be calling
 
so that they should expect to hear from you.
 
As I said over the phone, the panel is most concerned that
 
there was no real input from anyone who knew about the French
 
cultures and styles involved in the festival.  They are willing
 
to go along with having Andy Wallace as the project director
 
but would really like to see someone working with Andy who
 
could handle the cultural end of things  (and who can speak
 
French) .
 
The idea of having a printed program is fine, but they really
 
need someone to present the people on stage -- someone who
 
is familiar with their repertoires and who can deal with the
 
introductions, etc.
 I think that if you just talk with Ellen
 
and Nike and react to what they ;
gay in the same: ways that
 
you reacted to the things I raised in our conversation (from
 
the basis of your experiences with the Smithsonian festival),
 
i
 
that you'll get across some of the basic points that we want
 
across.  Basically, this trip is giving theta some information
 
rather than giving us any (
although your report of their reac-
tions will be helpful).  We like the festival and just don't
 
want them to get stuck in a rut thinking that last year was
 
success ful, not quito knowing what to do to make this year
 
better, B
anc., thus, just repeating last year's program in
 
more .
places,
 
we really would like it if they would consider having you as
 
a part of the festival crew -- a consultant, presenter or
 
whatever.  parhaps, if you get a chance, you should point
 
out to them that college or graduate students with the right
 
training and: interests could be used in the areas of the tour
 
(
if they don't really want to have someone on as a consultant
 
full t
ime h
over, they should feel free to include the costs
 
for one since our panel likes to support that sort of thing).
 
Many thanks for your help with this.  I hope you have a good
 
time in Vermont.  Please call us and let us know how your
 
plans for the trip are going.  I
'll be glad to talk all of
 
this over with you again if you have any more questions.

v
-seicend.  We both deeply regret that we will not be able to

to Charleston and then retns
'aed to M
b

I then spent a good portion of the 4hy talking with Bess

!
!rude is no doubt
 
in my mind that the
, conferee me ras a success for everyone
 
who participated.  it was really a fine event.  You did an
 
especially good jab of coordinating everythA
ing and every
 
one -- not an easy task wban you are dealing with garrulous
 
anthropologists and file omOers.  I just wish that all of
 
the Folk Art; panel could have participated in the event to
 
see what a good decision they made about supporting it.
 
I
'm sure that they world have all been pleased.
 
In addition to the formal events of the week, I can't tell
 
you really how much I appreciated your hospitality.  It was
 
so kind of you and M lie to open your home to us so often
 
during the time we were in ColuMbda.
 
Bess and I discussed the state of folk arts in your state
 
and both come to the conclution that perhaps the best ray
 
around some of the problems is through the encouragement of
 
too quality folk arts projects outside of the official state
 
-a-
agencies.  There are numerous possibilities such as the
 
inclusion of local traditional artists in the activities
 
surrounding the many county fairs.  Please feel free to
 
gut anyone that might be interested in folk arts projects

This is just a quick note -- alas,  long after the fact --
to thank you for your cordial invitation to attend the
 
opening of the "Missing Pieces  -
- Georgia Folk Arts,
 
1773-1976" in Columbus,
 i deeply regretted not being able
 
to attend.
 
However, you will, I hope, be pleased to hear ghat I got
 
a glowing report on the affair from Alan Jabbour and others.
 
I am sure that it must have been splendid.
 
one of these days, I really should like to raise to Columbus
 
and have a long chat with you about Georgia traditional
 
music and art.  I was so very pleased that you arranged a
 
session **r Bessie Jones with local teachers; she is a
 
truly remarkable woman and,  like so many others throughout
 
history, has been far too long "without honor in her own
 
country" specifically, in this case, Georgia.  Did you

Dear Lida:
 
I as back in the office
: for only two days before running
 
away again for a conference in Texas, but I did want to
 
dash off a note thanking you and the Council for your
 
gracious hospitality during the recent Mississippi Governor's
 
Conference.  The whole co Wlex event was so beautifully
 
planned that everyone participating not only got a great
 
deal of business done but also had a simply marvellous
 
time.  I do hope you will pass along my
 s to
 
your efficient and cordial staff.
 
When
. I get back from Toms, if I may, I will I
ncite you at
 
greater length on the rbole question of folk arts activities
 
in Mississippi.  I to* several interesting chats with Paula
 
Tadlock, Bill Ferris, Mirth Long, Patti Black and others,
 
and they gave t
he much to think about.  You have a number
 
of thoughtful and energetic workers in you state.
 
Again, mkt sincerest thanks for inviting me to your conference.
 
It was a personal and pro I ,
 treat.
 
cordially,

 We will

 Are
 
you coming to the Detroit meeting?  Surely they have oysters
 
there,  and the month, as I recall, is November....
 
When I drooped sadly back to my office  (having mi ssed another
 
pleasant visit with you)  I found a letter from Les Blank.
 
Ha tells me that he wrote you some time back about the notion
 
of doing a film on Czech life in Texan but hasn't heard
 
whether or not your
m interested.  If you are,  I can reconnend
 
Les as a fine fits: maker.
 I hats not worked with him personally
 
so I can't say anything about his in collegial torus, b
ut I
 
am sure wither Roger Abrahams or Dick Bauman could give you a
 
notion on that dimension of his personality.
 in case you've
 
lost his letter, his address  is:

He seems to be casting about for film subjects.
 If you don't
 
think the Texan Czechs would make  a good film. phehaps
s you'd
 
have another idea for him?

Dear Mr. Wheeler:
 
I really apologize for taking so long to send you the
 
enclosed materials, but it has been something of a
 
madhouse hereabouts.
 
I
've gone over your proposal thoroughly and must repeat
 
what I told you when we met in my offices
 your project
 
really fits the Music Program's Folk/Ethnic guidelines
 
to a tee.
 However,  their 1978 funds are already expended.
 
You could, of course, apply to then for 1979; their
 
deadline is June,  and I would recommend that you write
 
Rob Gordon in the Music Program for a copyoof their new
 
guidelines  (which should be ready some time during December).
 
In the meantime,  I
'm enclosing application blanks and
 
guidelines for the Folk Arts Program
s, in case you should
 
want to apply here for 1978.
 As you will see, we are basically
 
set up to support local projects, rather than those of
 
national sc ape; h
over, we have +
funded some projects with
 
national outreach,  so you might want to try us.
 
If you should elect to try our program,  I would recawnw md
 
that you consider beefing up your number of local participants.
 
Washington has a large number of outstanding fiddlers,  and
 
a really distinctive regional sty4e.
 In view of our program's
 
concerns with supporting local artists,  an inclusion of
 
Sole Washington fiddlers might make your application more
 
appmaling to our reviewing panel,  as well as add a distinctive
 
element to your festival.
 That is,  of course,  up to you and
 
your planning .
group to decide,  however.
 
Finally,  concerning deadlines, you will see that our next
 
deadline if January 1,  for projects scheduled to start next
 
summer.
 This would mean,  I am afraid,  that we could not
 
Mr. Joe Wheeler

support the t
welve month residency you included in your
 
narrative proposals however, I see no reason why you should
 
not come to an for the other categories of support mentioned.

phone me (
or my associate, Sally Yerkovich) at 202 634 2060.

Dear John:
 
Thank you for your interesting proposal.
 I am enclosing

'd appreciate any comments
 
yourmight have, pro or con, concerning the latter;
 I tried
 
to write something that would wqalain our program a bit
 
more clearly, and I hope it works.
 
Concerning your plane, I am not quite sure how our panel
 
will react;  we normally handle smaller and leas ambitious
 
projects.  l
iowever, I certainly think the panel should
 
grapple with the problems you are raising, and I would
 
enc
baage you to submit a formal application in tim e for
 
our current deadline.  October 1 is the formal date, but
 
a week or so after that would still got in under the wire.
 
If it proves to be t!o difficult to put together an applic-
ation in so short a time, our next deadline is January 1
 
for projects to start early June.
 
It is very important in your application that you spell out
 
exactly what the Folk Arts Program will be asked to fund.
 
There is an in-house raivlation that prohibits two programs
 
from awarding separate grants for the same project.  Therefore,
 
please differentiate what you are requesting from Folk Arts
 
from the application you've submitted to the Music Program.
 
It is crucial that we avoid any suggestion of double funding.
 
Please don't hisitate to call either z

the support of traditional artists and traditional communities.
 
If you intend to use live artists in your proposed sectes,

 eatre In Progress apparently functions �
�riwarily as a cultu-
ral flow-through organization for the City of Loa Angeles.  One
 
of their major activities each year is the Garden "
z
'heatre Fes-
tival, held for 21 days in a downtown park.  This festival has
 
in the past received support from Expansion '
arts.
 
Because of a Transition Quarter z
nix-
-up, their application was
 
too late for Expansion Arta in 1977 and they applied to Folk
 
Arts.  At r
ay recommendation (in teniis of our
 Ines) , they
 
broke out a special presentation of traditional arts within
 
the festival and said they would hire a folklorist--coordinator
 
to pull it together.
 
The application was approved at the March, 1977 meeting of the
 
Folk Arts panel and awarded for a start date of June 1, 1977.
 
I made a stie visit in July, 1977, conferred with Marren
 
Christensen (iheatre In Progress director) and Barbara Rahm,
 
the folklorist in charge.  The program was going well;
 
Viristensen seemed upset because the traditional arts presen-
tation was being handled scmwWhat differently freer the rest of
 
the Festival but I thought I had gotten him cal m" town.
 
T
-
A
.s. Rahm phoned me on September 15 (a month after the festival)
 
to tell me that Christensen had not ,
paid the folklife perfor-
mers for their final day's work at the festival ; there -w e
 
outstanding bills for crafts and food .
supplies, and she had w t
 
been paid at all in spite of having worked almost full tics
 
since April.
 (She had told Christensen she would accept h a
 
fee in a lurq-)
 sum at the end of the festival because he was
 
having "cash flow problems".)  Her estimatesis that he is about
 
$25,000 in debt for the festival overall, approximately $8,000
 
of which is monies owed to the folklife section (the part we
 
funded).
 
At my request she phoned +
"gain on September 22 with a cot%3lete
 
accounting of the ;
uonies she had spent (or committed for her
 
program) , a suraraary of which is attached.  In the meantime, I
 
took up the issue with the Folk Arts panel, and they share r
ay

extremely grave concern over the situation.  We would like the
 
strongest possible action taken; most of the performers con-
cerned are non-English speaking Italians, Chicanos and Philip-
pinos: all are working people.
 It is als=tost impossible td'
 
explain the situation to the
 v
i, and they are besieging not
 
Christensen but i
-
.s. Rahm who is quite helpless in the situa-
tion and feels her professional refutation is jeopardized.
 
There are several &dditional relevant facts:
 
10  Ms. Rahn says she overspent her budget by approximately
 
$
1
.,000.  The Folk Arts program could l
auttbkrough a 20% grant in-
crease which could cover this, but I a
r
ia concerned lest the
 
i
f
ioney be spent for other festival expenses instead of going to
 
the folklife folks.
 
2)  one of the reasons the f stival is in the hole in that
 
an expected grant f
 rota the Los Angeles City Arts Council dick
 
not came through.  This seems to is s dander signal, and per-
haps mo m local enquiries should be made as to the stability
 
of the entire Theatre in Progress organization.

)  Chriastense has just received a sizeable grant from
 
HEW to train sixteen CE'T
`Es workers in festival management.  Is
 
there any way l
ie could be pre v
ented from receiving any more
 
federal monies until his debts are eleareds
 
4)  The recent Falk/Ethnic panel g
reeting received an appli-
cation from `
i
`heatre in Pr o
 pX M s which they( fortunately) re-
jected.  Since the Folk Arts panel was meeting
, concurrently,
 
it is interesting that l
ie did not apply to us.  Could that
 
organization be flanged and no further applications be processed
 
until his accounting with Folk Arts is cleared up?
 
5)  Me. Raba reports that Christense is working hard on
 
fund raising.  It se m
en to me that it should be pointed out
 
to '
him in tbo most forceful te sts that his z
^
.atching commitments
 
to Folk arts must 0 =0 first in his list of priorities.
 
6)  Please note that the monies owed for crafts supplies,
 
food and the like are expenses laid out by the folklife oerformers, 
not bills to the local grocery store.  They therefore should be
 
considered along with the perfoxtiers' fees as top priority.

Fred Lazarus
 
I referred the issues embodied in the attached grant back
 
to the Folk Arts Panel, and they continued to be strongly
 
supportive of it.  Their discussion was recorded and can
 
be transcribed, if you feel it important.
 
The following e
ribodies my scuiew
°hat down-home analysis.
 ma-
nipulating the yosyo, as Mr. Concepcion does, is as much of
 
an art as is juggling, or baton-twirling or -
-- to extend it
 
a bit -- any kind of acrobatics or t
izm
'hl
  ing.  It is a skill,
 
a feat, performed
. to aMMUM and astonish and i t a audiences.
 
It is not a game or contest; perhaps the cloosst thine is
 
street or popular theatre.
 
Baton twirling and juggling p
alates and yo-yoing do not seem
 
to me high art, but they all clearly demand discipline,
 
tradit&onal expressivity (though limited in nature), .
im-
provisation and skill.  They bear a relation to dance -
--
perhaps "pre-dance"?
 
I
 the fact which pri mrily intrigued the Folk Arts
 
panel was that here was a p
 ormance manifesting a high
 
dogree of skill and expertise which the xhilippine-American
 
coamunity could take credit for.
 (Philippinos take sorae
 
pride in l
iaveing"invented" the yoyo, originally -
-- like
 
many present-day "toys" -- a weapon.)  In fact, Sally
 
reminds me that when the panel first reviewed this project,
 
Kenny Goldstein suggested the project description be amended
 
as follows:
 
Support for the documentation of the recreational
 
and artistic use of Philippine war weapons
 
I find myself liking that one better and better.  The frequent
 
inter-relation of the "martial" arts and childre n toys has
 
long been a topic of anthropological interest; it's a
► real
 
chicken and egg problem which has yet to be resolved, but it's
 
these.

ir. C*ncwpcion (an eighty year old gentleman in fine
 
fettle who n m sr
opports himself by coaching tennis in Los
 
Angeles) is sIxVjy a focal point around which a visual stu#y
 
of Philippine traditional behavior - manifested in tea m of
 
childrenbi activities, dance and other forms of pattexi od
 
movement -
-- would be centered.  Mallie Lopez, a Philippine-
born folklorist who is one of the principals in this project,
 
tells me there ar
ia many parallel Philivpino artistic behaviors
 
which could be brought out (through child and adult participa-
tion) in this film.
 
E
Nn alternate project description thus could be:
 
Support for the documentation of M mo Concepcion
 
and Philippin
 rican children perfon.Ung tradi-
tional improvisational activities stressing skill
 
and agility.

Dear Z
Ls. Dunn.
 
Thank you for your letter.
 I am enclosing a copy of the
 
current Folk Arts Program g
=uidelines.  `
Re define our area
 
of concern very closely, anti it noes not appear to i
ue that
 
your proposed film would fit into our specialized area.
 
However, there are two other programs 4ithin the Endowment
 
where a project of this type might be reviewed; R
,edia Arts
 
and the Folk/Ethnic section of our music Program.
 I am
 
therefore enclosing the guidelines for these two progrwas,
 
in case you adcjht wish to enquire there.
 
It sounds like a very interesting film, and I wish you all
 
success in your search for funds.

Bernie Lopez, the director of the Now Mexico Arts Council
 
dropped by r
ay office the other day, and we got a bit ac-
quainted.  I
le turns out to be awfully nice fellow, and I
 
think, extremely smart.
 
Anyway, I mentioned your filrus to him, and he said that
 
there Y
�ad been s
car
ce exchange of letters between the two
 
of you.  I
le further remarked that the New Mexico Arts
 
Council woulb be extra  ly interested in working with
 
you and hoped you would drop around and talk your pro-
blems over.  Since this kind of remark doesn't get said
 
very often, I thought I
'd best pass it along pronto.
 
My experience with the New Mexico Arts people in general
 
is that they do not themselves have a lot of money, but
 
they are extromAly hard-working and ingenious.  I do
 
think you oufjht to follow-up with theca as soon: as you
 
get back from wherever it is you are.
 
Cordially,

Dear Mr. Bagwell:
 
I am sorry we missed connections during my recent trip to

I am enclosing a copy of the nearly formulated Folk Arts
 
guidelines for your information.  You will notice that we
 
define the area of our concern rather rigidly, and it is
 
difficult for r
oe to tell from your project description
 
whether your project fits into our program or not.  In
 
ease it doesn/t, I am also enclosing the guidelines for
 
out L%�ansion Arts program; it is possible that you might
 
qualify under their proglsm.
 
In either case, I wish you all possible success, and I
 
hope you will give my regards to the Pattersons when you
 
see thew next.

I don't know whther or not you r®o mber me, but you visi6ed
 
r
ay office several weeks ago enquiting about possible sources
 
of funding for your library and wAse m facility.  At the
 
time, I had very little help to offer, but on a recent visit
 
to the American Indian Historical Society, I mentioned your
 
difficulty in obtaining books for your library to the direc-
tors, Rupert Bnd Jeanette Costa.
 
Mrs. Costo suggested that you write her directly concerning
 
your needs, as she has been able to help locate quantities
 
of books for several tribal libraries.  I realize, of course,
 
that you may already have solved your problem, but I wanted
 
to j
oass this laid along just in case you haven't.  The
 
address is:  American Indian Historical Society, 1451 ?

Dear Mr. F

"
hank you for your enquiry concerning the "Appalachia and
 
other Folk" Performance.  I am enclosing for your inforis-
tion a copy of the recently revised Folk Arts guidelines.
 
Judging by the brodh
hure descriging your program, it se m
is
 
not very likely that your project fits into our particular
 
area of interest.  Since your program does, however, appear
 
to include music, I have forwarded your materials on to Me
 
Folk/Ethnic section of our Music Prograaa for thiir review.
 
I ana sure they will be in touch with you within a few w oks.

will be helpful.
 
As you will M O, M  don't give out grants to individiuxls;
 
your college or soea other non-profit group would have to
 
apply.  Vby not talc your idea over ti i
di some faculty member
 
interested in the ftaditional arts at your college?  it
 
seem s to me that MI " Minez is there; she is a fine Filip-
pino folklorist.  And then, of course, there is Hector Lee.
 
He is retired but still active, and if you haven't met his
 
yet, you should.
 
I am further enclosing the guidelines for the Jana/Folk/
 
EtImic Music program.  They are a bit more flexible than
 
our,; however, they have already committed their funds for
 
1978 and cannot accept applications before June 1
.978 for
 
funding in 1979.
 
After you've cane over these guidelines, if you have any
 
further questions, don't hesitate to write z
ee again.  You
 
might also want to talk over your ideas further with Gone
 
Bluestein.

closing a list of their names  and addresses.
 
In selecting d

of experts in a
. wide variety of fields relating to the yolk
 
acts.  Currently, we have spokialists in material culture,
 
ethno misicology, ethnic studies, Native American studies,
 
media, and visual arts on our p eal.  Panalists are nominated
 
by the director of the Program and then h eir nominations
 
are approved by the chairman of the Arts
 
t.
 Panel
 
members servo far two year terms.  since the rodtk Arts prognam
 
is a relatively nat = w at the m
int, we are just recently
 
beginning to rotate nodars off the pamsl, to select a new
 
panel members and to  hake a
fiditions in number.
 
I hope this has answered any questions you may have had.

Dear Dr. Gillis:
 
First I must apologize for not having responder: to your
 
letter of 29 1
4ay sooner.  It was on my desk amidst a number
 
of other letters and I somehow overlooked it until recently.
 
I am sorry to report that I cannot be veryeencouraging in
 
nV response.  It is almost impossible for us to support
 
work that odes not occur in the United St*tes or its trust
 
territories.  Perhaps the Brooklyn Museum would have access
 
to a funding; source for the Ra-Ra file.  An alternative
 
source might be the Haitian F
ussy.
 
Also, I should point out that your Budget is high for our
 
program.  It is double what we usually allow.  Our standard
 
rule of thumb is that a 30 minute color film can be produ md
 
in this country for approzi mtely $30,000; of that m
ama, we
 
could only provide $15,000, since ours is a matrYjAna
 avenomok-
Finally, before we support any documentation of a a rd3 a
 
community, we must have strong indications of support from
 
that c
 ni ty, and, where ayp
 ropriate , from;
. the gov*w ment .
 
Again, I'm sorry that I couldn't be r
jore of a help to you
 
and wish you success in doing your film.

'
l
thank you for your letter of 25 July inquiring about a proj-

State.  I am enclosing a copy of the Folk Arts prograxa
 
description for your information.
 
If you would like to apply for a grant from our program we
 
ask that you send us a letter outlining in some detail what
 
you would like to do for yourpproject and bow you will be
 
doing it.  This should be a nt to us about six weeks before
 
an application deadline.  At that point, we will review
 
your project, send you the appropriate application forms,
 
and advise you about the materials which you should send
 
to us.
 
At this point, the Folk Arts program does not have an indi-
vidual grant category.  All projects must be sponsored by
 
a non-profit organization.  in addition, every dollar given
 
through an Arts Eddamment grant must be match dollar per
 
dollar either by grants from another organization of by
 
in-kind services and donations.
 
You might consider getting in touch with the New York State
 
Council on the Arts (80 Centre Street, New York, New York
 
1U013).  The New York Council in the state equivalent to
 
the NationaldEndowment and you may be eligible to apply for
 
a grant directly from then or they may be able to advice
 
you about other local sources for funding in your area.

Dear Mr. Linden:
 
To confirm our conversation of August 1, 1977, historic
 
New Harmony, Inc. is being considered for a grant from
 
the National Endowment
, for the Arts, a federal a
gcy.
 
While the grant has not as yet been awarded, the a Mliea--
tion has been recommended for funding by the Folic Arts
 
Pan&l and the National Council on the Arts.  These two
 
groups act in an advisory capacity to the Chairman of
 
the ,
m
arts rml
m
o
we a
t
t, and sines they have both favorably
 
reviewed the application, it is likely that Historic
 
X w l
ta=uony will receive $5,®Q©.
 
Again, let r
ae stress that this in no way assures 3
lisboric
 
Now Harmony of the the grant, but merely reflects that
 
status of the application so far.

line (for projects starting in the Sprang of 1978); bowever g,
 
first we would like to know when you will hear about the
 
grant you applied for throu4h the American Film Institute.
 
Presumably. if you receive a grant fro m ,
'
BFI, you won't need
 
one from us.
 
The Folk Arts program dues r
iot have an individual grant
 
category, so it would be necessary for you to apply through
 
a non-profit organization.
 In a
c ei  
tion, we e by give matcnincj
 
grant&, so some evidence of mat ching funds or in-kind contri-
butions would have to be provided in the application.
 
In any case, I am encleeing several application forms for you
 
to fill out.  We will need three ccupleted farms -- one
 
should be in the original typescript with originalssignatures;
 
the other two may be carbon or xerox copies.
 
Please get in touch if you have any questions or problems.
 
Feel free to call us person-to-person collect at 202/634-6020.

Herewith s

some good.  It is a da

free to tell potential weplyers to call upon me for any
 
additional idformati
.on I might be able to offer.
 
I dry have one a
3ossible practical suggestion.  There is a new
 
cultural center being built in Temple, Texas, and they are
 
looking for a folklorist to start a p
►eogram with the various
 
ethnic groups in the as
^sa.  Not knw A
lz j you were looking for
 
a job, I have already roca
�ndod Susan Kal
.cik: however, I
 
do not know S
her a) they are interested in her or b) if
 
she is interested in them.  T do think you might send them
 
a letter with your resume, and by all means, use my name:
 
address:
 
Mr. Gary Moore
 
Temple Cultural Activities Center
 
3609 Antelope Trail

By the way, if you're planning to be in the area at the time,
 
I myself plan to d
a mp by  Berkeley and San Francisco ber
g
 
the dates of August 23rd and August 29.  I
'll be attending
 
the 1

Charlie Seeger's 90th birthday celebration from the 28-29.

Some time in there I'll prob^hly tek  a run to S

in San Franciso.  If you're going to be in the Bay area, give
 
me a call person-to-person collect at 202/634--6020 and we'll
 
make a plan to have tea (or something stronger) together.
 
Please.
 
Finally, I
've reconmended you to Joe Wilson for field work on
 
the San Francisco Folk Festival, also th the Smithsonian for
 
work on a projected Nevada festival for the swmaer of 1979.
 
So some things may possibly be coming through - not permanent

should you want to stay in California

Dear Mr. Old Coyote:
 
In reference to your proposal for the Crow Indian Music
 
?
grogram, I would like to make a few suggestions before you
 
formally apply.  `
whey essentially concern your proj
ected
 
budget.
 
The Folk Arts a
clvdksory panel has consistently declined to
 
fund purchase of major equipment such as movie projectors
 
and videot ape cameras.  You may include in your total proj-
ect costs the m ount it would cost you to rent such equip-
ment, but we will not fund purchase.
 
Secondly, I must tell you that the panel has drown in-
creasingly reluctant to fund either motion picture or video-
tapdng projects unless we have clear evidence as to a) the
 
real neceskity of such documentation and b) the technical
 
expertise of the person in charge of the documentation.
 I
 
seriously recommend your cutting these costs .back, as your
 
total project as now written is extremely expensive for us.
 
we are a small program, and our grants normally ranee
 
between $5,0©0 and $20,000.
 
Thirdly, there is no evidence here as to what matching
 
monies you have to put up, if any.  Our grants are written
 
on a 50-50 basis; that is, the applying organization r
oust
 
match their request from the .ndowment dollar for dollar.
 
Some of your match can, of course, be donated items (rent,
 
utilities, services, etc.).  These should be dhvwn as part
 
of VDur total project costs and then again as part of your
 
match.

Dear Professor Labov;
 
I am sorry it's taken me so long to get round to responding
 
to your interesting proposal.
 Certainly films such as you
 
suggest here would be useful in many educational areas.
 have
 
you thought, by the way,  of showing this to my brother Alan?
 
He would like to see it,  I know.
 
In more practical  (viz.  financial)  terms,  I gather you have
 
already approached the National Endowment for the humanities
 
with this proposal.
 Have you thought also of the Carnegie
 
Foundation?
 I also took the liberty of showing your material
 
to my assistant,  Sally Yerkovich, and to Bill Leap of the
 
Institute for Applied Linguistics, who happened to dross by.
 
Bill suggested that Dr.  Grace Holt of the Speech Department
 
at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle Campus, would
 
be someone to contact for another reading on the proposal.
 
I do not know Ur.  Holt myself, but both Fill and Sally feat
 
she might be able to give some useful suggestions.
 
In terms of the Folk Arts program at the Arts Endowment, we
 
tend to stay away from performance and/or documentation pro-
jects that are basically slanted towards an academic audience,
 
on the grounds that there are other ggencies directed towards
 
this segment of the population.
 The possibility remains that
 
we might be able to support a small portion of this project -
- perhaps that segment directed towards more general circulation
 
of good talk and good talkers via cable t.v.  and the like --
but that would seem a later stage.
 
Please accept my best wishes for the sucess of the project.

Dear Ms. Haul:
 
Thank you for your recent letter.
 
In order for a project such as yours to qualify under the
 
rolk Arts program, it must be su
'hm;tted by  a non-profit
 
organization, as we have no category for individual grants.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the Folk Arts program description
 
together with a list of our deadlines for your assistance.
 
I feel I should also tell you that the folk Arts advisory
 
,anal has been increasingly reluctant to fund  kmumentation
 
;
projects unless the applicant dives evidence of extremely
 
high technical and cultural qualifications.  Should you
 
decide to apply to our program
,, we would need samples of
 
your work to be w1bmitted well in advance of the application
 
deadlines listed.
 
You mention that your project ,
sight prove to be fundable
 
through Public Media and the Education Program's Artist-in-
Residence (
program.  I enclose the current Endowment Guide
 
to programs in case you decide to apply through them.  Our
 
Guide for 1978 is unfortunately not yet ready; I believe it
 
will be out during the fall and peehaps you r
ai

Lear Mr. Stanford:
 
Thank you for your proposal concerning a film on the folklife
 
pf Baltimore dock workers.
 
There are several pproblem  of concern.  First, you are a bit
 
late.  The July 15 deadline was for receipt of fotwnai ar
.T
.lica-
tions, rather than for narrative proposals.  The next deadline
 
for receipt of formal applications will be October 1, 1977 for
 
projects to begin in or after March 1978.
 
Second, the Folk Arts progr a
m does not now have a category
 
supporting applications by individuals.  We are considering
 
adding such a category, but, even if we do. we cannot begin
 
funding any such proposals until the October death
 tioned
 
before.  As of
 n ow, we can only accept applications
, froru non-
profit organizations from which we require i
aa
.tching funding
 
(which may be in kind) at least to the amount aske d for from
 
the 8ndowment .
 
I'd be  1
jlad to discuss this with you by phone if you would
 
want to call me person-to-person collect
. at 2
012/634-6020.  A
 
further suggestions I have is for you to discuss the whole
 
project with Charley Camp, State Folklorist at the Maryland
 
Arta Council, 15 West Mulberry, Baltimore, Maryland 212 1,
 
301/685-6740; it's possible that the Asts Council Ltrself
 
night be able to act as your fiscal sponeor and help you find
 
a match.
 If that's the case, we night be able to extend our

deadline for formal & Wlication until July 29, but that would
 
be the absolute d6wal f
it.  on the whole, it would seem to
 
■
is to be better for you to wait until October 1.
 
It's an interesting idea. and I wish you good luck.  Let me
 
know if I can be of furtb w aasistarnce.

Your letter of June 17 has been referred to me by the visual
 
Arts Prograw.  Un6ortunately, the Folk Arts Program has no
 
individual grant category; we fund only non-profit institu-
tions concerned with traditional arts.
 
I am enclosing for your assistance a copy of the Endowment's
 
Guide to Programs; if you c
oo through this, you may find a
 
specific category to which you might apply.  I might also
 
suggest that you enquire from your own state agency the
 
Maryland arts Council
., 15 '
test Mulberry, Baltimore, Maryland

 sometimes an individual artist has a

I would stror *ly recamisand, h

you file a formal application.
 we would need to have an out-

considers the entire op€arati % plan for such proposals and
 
reads all available barkiip information wits great interest.
 
I a
ru also a bit concerned about your proposed budget.
 overall,
 
it seems a bit low for the activities that you propose; for
 
instance, do you think the amount budgeted for vid x*spe
 
coverage is sufficient for adequate docunwntation7  Fa Cher,
 
our program requires that each applying organization most

Dear Karl:
 
Just a note of apology.  SoMet
•h;ng caught up with me
 
last week-end, the day before I was to come to South
 
Carolina.  At the time, I thogght it was the flu --
my back, head, neck and other attachments were aching
 
like crazy -- but I
've finally decided it was plain old
 
exhaustion.  If I
'm going to last in this job, I
'll have
 
to learn to pace myself better.
 
Anyway, I M
 truly sorry tohb "e missed the conference.
 
From what both Sally and Alan have told me, it was an
 
Unqualified success, and I am sure the panel will be
 
delighted.  Will you be able to find time to write us a
 
report on how you felt it all turned out?
 (
You have to
 
write a
cne kind of final grant report anyway; since Sally
 
and I are really the ones to read it, maybe you'd just
 
want to do it informally, with your hair down, so to
 
speak.)
 
I also hear that you are going to be a father.  How marvellous.
 
Please give your wife my very best regards and wishes, and
 
tell her I hope we'll be able to meet soon.  Sally and I
 
are debating about who will get to go tbethe AAA meeting;
 
it is awfully difficult to handle a two-person office and
 
still get to all the things we need to cover.
 
Again, my earnest congratulations on running such a fine

Dear t
ar. l
letallinos:
 
Your letter concerning funding for the Terpsichorea n was
 
forwarded to the Folk Arts Program at the Arts Endowment.
 
We have Looked over your proposal and find it interesting.
 
Unfortunately, the budget would be beyond
, our scope. In
 
addition, the Folk Arts panel usually does not fund choreo-
graphed performances of the traditional arts.
 I am enclosing
 
the Expansion Arts ,
program guidelines for your infoniiation.
 
You might be qualified to apply to that program.
 
The Folic Arts program could also consider a proposal dealing
 
wit2i interviewing older Greek dancers about their folk tradi-
tions.
 This could either be an audio or video taping
; project.
 
if you were to submit a proposal for such a project with a
 
video tape you would need to send a sample of the videotaping
 
for panel review.
 '
The Folk Arts d
el is concerned with
 
funding only high quality video projects because they feel
 
that the elegance of folk arts should be adequately represented
 
through an "& presentation.
 
You might want to consider contacting your local public tele-
vision station for help videotaping the dance perfor-mance of
 
the Terpsichoreans.
 
I art enclosing also the Folk Arts program description and

Dear Uanna Lee Smith:
 
You will be surprised to h ur me in Washington.  I
've b wde meleave
 
from California State University at Northridge for well over
 
a year now, first working on the Smithsonian's Folklife Festival
 
for the sure
r-
wr of 1976 and more recently at the national Endow--
ment for the Arts.  I
'll be back in California in the fall of
 
1975.

Vhile I was at the Smith d
onian. I met a young woman from Scotland
 
named Alison :
01
cMorland who showed me a film she had produced
 
(which f utures, indidentally, her own mother and her own skall
 
daughter).  I was so cha iv
ied by the film -- it's titled "Pass
 
It On" -- that I bought a copy from her and offered to try to
 
place it with a distributor in the U.S.
 
So, I
'm sending it to you under serrate
  cover.  I have sh un
 
it to Professor Richard Bauman at the University of Texas, a
 
particular authority in the field of children's folklore, to
 
my brotiher, Alan Lomax. and to Ur. Sally Yerkovich, my current
 
assistant he m . All agree with me that it would be an excellent
 
film to use in folklore classes; I am sure if you needed written
 
statements to the film's usefulness, they would be glad to
 
provide them.
 
Alison is back in England now.  If you're interested in handling
 
.
her filfa, you can write her at:

past week to discover he had spoken with you the day before.
 
So all is well, and I
 I   so ,
ple
ad.  I am sorry that you've
 
had such a frustrating time with our sister agency: frankly,
 
even frog the vantage point of Wkshi
 ngton, I find it difficult
 
to understand hoer they operate myself.  Anyway, your lovely
 
project is now u
rklezw°ay, according to Phil, and all your man
 
friends can now sit back and lick their lips in anticipation•
 
I too spent a happy day with Alan and Carol on their boat, and
 
tbey told me about Frank's illness.  I am so very sorry, and
 
will hope for better news to fallow.  Please let me know if
 
there is anytbJng further I can do for the two of you, either
 
in official or unofficial capacities.  You are both extre
mely
 
agar to me and have been for a long time.  New friends are
 
always exciting, but old friends are m
ow the best, aren't
 
they?

Requ est from the Japan Foundation
 
Carl Stover
 
I have several suggestions to make for persons to be invited to
 
serve on the Japan Foundation's Fell owship award committee:
 
1)  Dr. Fred Lieberman, currently serving on the Folk
 
Arts panel.  Ur. Lieberman is an ethnoun sicologist, now teaching
 
in the Music LVpartment at the University of Washington, Seattle,
 
Washington.  He is a specialist in music of the far east and
 
took most of his training at the East West Center in Hawaii. He
 
is also a consci entious and hard-working panel member.  I assur e
s
 
i
.
-is complete curriculum vita is on file in Michael Straight's
 
office.
 
2)  Ralph Rinzl.er of the Smithsonian Folkl,ife proguam.
 
Ri1ph will be going off Music's Folk/Ethnic panel after theist
 
ptembgr meeting, I bel*eve.  T
?e has a personal interest in
 
Japsni�s culture, and has made several visits to Japan in con-
nection with Smithsonian presentations of traditional Japanese
 
arts.  Ralph is interested in both the visual and the musical
 
arts, and I think could make a reasonably knowledgeable contri-
bution in both areas.  i
lia curriculum vita should also be in
 
Michael Straight's files.
 
3)  Though I realize you asked for o
rs of the
 
Endowment panels, I ;
m
eant to mention two more nanw.  Ralph
 
Sa.
~ezelson , who is now working for the JDR III Vemid in New York
 
di
al field work for the Smithsonian during a two Maur period of
 
graduate study in Japan.  f
ie is a well-trained ethncuausicologist
 
and has a wide personal acquaintanceship with Japanese scholars
 
and :
musicians.  I should think he might be a big help.
 
4)  Lastly (since I have no non--western names on this
 
list) I would like to mention Mrs. patia Isaku, currently
 
teaching at the College of Creative Studies at the University
 
of California in Santa Barbara.  Mrs. Isaku in an anglo-:m
arried
 
to a Japanese.  Her field is music, and s
ay Japanese friends tell
 
me she ginge
r their songs in an aLsolutely exquisite styles. They
 
find her amazing, and her participation in Japanese musical events
 
is sought after by the west coast Japanese community.

Dear Tom:
 
T
runk you for sending us your ,
proposal for the Delaware Polk
 
Music Festival.  11
'
'he proposal as you have it outlined looks
 
good and you can go ahead and fill in tbo appropriate applica-
tion forms.  I an enclsidreg several forms -- we'll need three
 
returned to us -- one should be in oric;3nsi tglpscript with
 
original signatures.  The others may be xexxome or carbons.
 
Bass L max Hawes and I talked over your festival and noted a
 
few things that we could sgpport if you ranted to expand the
 
festival a bit.  !
`f
irst, you might cona "er acIdi
  ng the costs
 
for editing out a mic for a one hour radio program that ©onld
 
be distributed to local stations.  This addition, of course.
 
would depend u
r n whether you know of anyone u
4ao would be
 
interested and capable of producing such a radio show.
 
Second, if you wanted to include a few cra
.ftepeople doing
 
des xnstrations of their work, the folk Arts Program would be
 
able to support this.
 
iL s
 I mentioned above, thecae are just suggestions for you
 
concerning things we could support if you are interested in
 
e
. panding your program.  The proposal as it stands is .
fine.
 
4e
,  have two deadlines that you could meet: 15 July (
for funding
 
beginning at the beginning of 1978) and 1 October (for projects
 
beginning after 1 March 1978).  -,

 rcrn

Dear Mrs. Ingebretsen:
 
I enclose for your information a copy of the Falk Arts program
 
description (which is currently being revised fat purposes of
 
clarification) .  on the basis of your letter, I as afraid it
 
does not seem your project would fit into our area of concern.
 
t
ie are a small program and are concerned entirely with supp
-ort
 
of those arts that represent the tradition of an entire c
 omnanity.
 
The paintings and sculp f
tres of those local artists id w are
 
working from a l
x-
-rsonal vision are beyond the scope of our
 
program
..
 
LAt me recommend that you examine the Visual 7
-
.rts section of
 
the Endoutimnt Guide to Programs to see if your project sight
 
q
=ualify there.
 I'd  also suggest that you get in touch with
 
your own state arts agency.  A letter to f

Dear Margot,
 
I
-
low nice to hear from nose.  .
and I am also happy to gear that
 
you are thinking of finishing up your degree.
 
As fax as my ,,
x rticipation on your coranittee is concerned, as
 
I told you -- I think -- during our last conversation, I could
 
be glad to continue if you want i
ne to.  There wAy be mdse
 
practical difficulties, :
►owever.  It does not appear t
hat I
 
will be back at Cal
.-State Northridge until the fall of 1378.
 
i
ts usual with me, there are a fete uncertainties S specifically
 
the chainz an of the Endowxant is up for reappointment or re-
placem mt in October of this year.  If this decision hasp a
 
deletexthus effect on this program, I will consider resigning
 
and returning to California for the 1378 spring semester.
 
There is also the r mote possibility that by the end of my
 
appointment I will be so enamoured of the job that I will
 
decide to resign from CSi?ty and stay in Washington.
 
Anyway, witll the above excep
tt6ons, I will be here until September
 
1378.  I don't know hoer much use I would be to you in absentia
 
(actually, I don't know how much u
s e I was to you anyway as
 
far as that goes).  maybe what you whould do is to go  out to
 
CSUN and talk with Greg Truex or Carol, who were also, as I
 
recall, on your committee.  I
've kind of last touch with the
 
department myself and don't knew for sure who is there, but I
 
am pretty sure that Carol and Greg are.  ,
anyway, I know they
 
would be glad to hear from you, as would Lynn Mason (now depart-
wont chairman, I think).

Vancouver and doing well; Na Mi and Sohn produced a splendid
 
baby boy  by  the name of Noah last August, and Nick has came
 
east and is currently in residence in Amherst * Massachusetts,
 
writing music and driving a school bus.  Barbara Rahm, as you

Dear Mr. Kuroiwa:
 
Thank
. you for your letter.  1 any enclosing for your information
 
the program description for the Folk Arts program we well ash
 
the guidelines for our Expansion Arts ;
g
,rogram, in case you
 
should wish to apply for funding through their office.
 
The F81k Arts program, as you will notice, limits its support
 
strictly to the most traditional arts and their practitioners:
 
thus part& of your proposed Festival would not be kbigible for
 
funding under our particular program.  It would be possible,
 
however, for you to apply to Folk Arts for funding for your
 
traditional activities as well as to
 j
.
>ansion (
`
trts for over-
all fektival
. support.
 
Please note that we re wire that each of our grants be matched
 
by an equivalent amount from the sponsoring organization. Such
 
r uches can be expressod in terms of donated facilities and
 
services but m olly should include some "hard" money.  if you
 
decide to apply to Folk
. 1
N
a  s
, I suggest that you think over
 
the traditional arts activities you intend to include in your
 
Festival and their costs and send us a letter detaiking this
 
information (
 including an indication of your available match
 )
 .
 
We can then go over this material and send you back application
 
blanks with full inotructions for filling them out.  A schedule
 
of future Folk Arts deac-3
lines is enclosed for your assistance.
 
In general, the Folk Arts panel has W on especially enthusiastic
 
about funding honoraria a
rKI expenses for traditional artists
 
Mr. Spencer Kuroiwa
 
- 2 -

themselves, also those expenses involved in l6cating and pre-
senting such artists.  You r
aight wish, for example, to e Wlry
 
bi-lingual
' speakers to help interpret the traditional arts to
 
your audiences, or particular experts to assist in selecting
 
the artists who will appear.  Salaries or honoraria for such
 
assistants can be included in your grant request.
 
Finally, I # wt tell you that the Folk Arts ;
grogram distin-
guishes between those arts traditional within the entite
 
community and the classical or fine arts of a particular culture.
 
we fund only the fortaer, as there are other areas within the
 
Endomment where the classical arts are supported, and we feel
 
the traditional arts wi
.tiiin the corm
-
 t
unity are every bit as
 
important.

who were responsible for helping organise those presentations

along with a sheet listing application deadlines.  We are
 
now in the process of expanding and clarifying the guide-

out for the next few months.
 
As far as a narrative proposal goes, we isk that you send
 
a short description of the kind of project you would like
 
to do.  This can be in the fort
: of a letter and need not be
 
elaborate.  r
'e would just like to have an idea of your p ins
 
so that we can give you advice: about the best ways of carrying
 
them out.
 
The su miary I
judget can also be done quiteiinformally.  You
 
should Lisst Aiat you estimate the expenses for your project
 
will be.  Things like salaries for individuals working on the
 
project, honoraria, supplies and matelialsx you will use,
 
travel expneses, etc. can be listed with approximate amounts
 
for each it em.  Since the Folk Arts program dives grants on
 
a watching basis, that is, requires that for every dollar of
 
Endowment funds s-pent on a project a dollar of funds from
 
another source or in-kind contributions be used, we would
 
also life toWLave some idea of your watching funds of contri-
butions.

Dear Suzi;
 
Thank you vary much for your nice letter.  The Astoria festival
 
sounds lovely.
 I visited Astoria ;
perhaps five years ago and
 
want to their historical society headquarters, ad I recall;
 
anyway, it was a marvelous old mansion built by a gentleman
 
ubo bad gotten the first contract to pilot ships up the river
 
from the ocean to Portland, and it was crar
. md full of marvel-
lous junk from the 1300s.
 is your festival going to be located
 
around there?
 
Concerning your request for the program, I'm naturally flattered
 
but -- as you predicted -- extremely rushed just at this z
aoment.
 
Tomorrow 1 leave for Tennessee, with later trips planned alu*st
 
every weekend throughout the sur=er.  Anyway, I was wondering
 
if you could use some excerpts fro,-: Use ,
purposed guidelines
 
I've been working on.
 I'ra enclosing a draft version describing
 
the prograrr
t (prepared for our Guide to Programs to be published
 
t
ijis fall) , and the first couple of pages from the Folk and
 
Traditional Arts guidelines draft.
 if you can find anything
 
in there worth quoting, please feel free to excerpt or re-edit
 
as you choose.  You could also add a statement to the effect
 
that the Folk Arts Programs at the Arts Endowment is proud to
 
be associated with the Forth Coast Folklife Festival and happy,
 
as well, to have been ahle to be of assistance.

Dear Ted

-
I am sorry about the communications gap.  Your earlier letters
 
had led me to believe that a more detailed proposal was en
 
route; I simply misread them.  Anyway, exile I was waiting for
 
r
aore information, your o
-111 came in and I managed to lose the
 
slip on which your phone number was written.
 (

 if you realize I sometim es get
 
t
wenty-five call-backs within a single day and r
ay d

littered with little slips of yellow paper all representing
 
telephone calls.)  Attempts to reach you at the Pittsburgh
 
telephone nux-aber on your stationary i
a
ate that that ,
phone
 
is no longer active, and no one at the Smithsonian has a phone
 
number for you either.
 
Anyway, all of this is by way of saying 2 have not intended to
 
neglect or ignore you.  Since time is now snort, I am enclosing
 
the a

budget.  W
ve'll get back to you with any questions we might have
 
but please include a phone number where we can at least leave a
 
message for you: we'll likely have to handle things by phone
 
from here on.  Fill out one application with the original typing
 
and with original signatures - (we need a clean copy of the
 
;
printers to work f
 m u) -- and send along two others, which can
 
be either xeroxes or carbons.
 
Concerning the sponsoring organization, the cleanest arrangement

ahead and file from SCAMP?  Then if the grant goes through and
 
you !till haven't heard from nts, we can always change the
 
fiscal agend at that time.

Please return three copies of the forms to us.  one copy

tures.  The ether two may be carbons or xeroxes.
 
Although the forms say that you need not include detail
 
for sections adding up to under 410,000, the Folk Arts
 
panel prefers to have as much detail as possible on each
 
application.
 
As I mentioned over the phone, please feel free to send

explain yo#r p

detail about what you %would like to do.
 
We look forward to hearing from you again soon.  If you
 
have any ,
problems or f
rutehr questions : please feel free to

Dear Bob:
 
I found your fiscal problems alit confusing, mostly in the
 
area of "overhead".  matters would clarify tbamselves, I think,
 
if you broke that figure down into rodeo or space rent, tele-
phone, food (if furnished) etc.  Then i
diatever parts of those
 
e
f
fuses the Firefighters Association is willing to donate can
 
make up past of the s
natch.  If they are willing to wake a
 
monetary contribution of any kind, that can be figured in also.
 
Bear in mind that we do not yet have a non--matching individual
 
action grant category, though it is possible v
ie s
tay by  the fall.
 
I have forgotban just when you plan to send your application in:
 
is it for the October lot deadline?  We should know about the
 
new category by then.
 
if we do not get the individual non-matching category, you will
 
have to handle the budget as I exp?ained in the first paragraph
 
Doing these things is a little like working out a personal
 
family budget.  You write dawn all costs you will have in work-
ing out a project, including your own
. salary.  Them in another
 
col mn you wiite down all the money you expect to get in, in-
cluding those parts of your budget which the Firefighters will
 
donate.  W%,at't left over is what you're asking the Endowmient
 
for.  Nor ml.ly, we want a fifty-fifty match.  If you can't
 
raise it, try us anyway; we have the authority to rive some
 
r
iartially matching grants if the project is significant enough.

I am a bit worried about the video expenaes.  As I toll you,
 
they panel is getting increasingly concerned about the amount
 
of money we pour into
 video.  Certainly, we cannot
 
finance the purchase of vi
m equigx l
ent . Are you sure that
 
the project requires visual documentation anyway?  I
zow about
 
still photographs?  Eight millimeter film?  Sixteen millimeter?
 
(Don't rule out Sin.; they are developing now processes now
 
that can blow such footage up to lbmm. without loss of clattty.
 
Fight mm, cameras are extremely portable and film costs are
 
negligible.)  Anyway, before you work out a whole complicated
 
budget on the basis of either video 2L film, I think you should
 
think the whole project through a bit to try and estimate just
 
,
,ww i
-x
uch and ghat you really need to doc =ont in this way.
 
Maybe you could do a significant portion of v&at you want to
 
do on audd&bape; it's certainly less obRrusive and cheaper all
 
round.
 
I
'd of course be  &alighted to talk further with you and have
 
Ryan either separatol.y or in tandem.  Just l
est me know a bit
 
in advance, as I shall be on the road a good bit this summer.
 
If I
'm not around, Sally yerkovich, r
ay near assistant, is up
 
on your proposal and I am sure would be glad to be of help.

.S. 
 A possibility you ought to consider is to come in to us
 
with a grant simply covering your basic sulVort for the
 
year with r
w>dest documen tation (via tape recording and
 
the like).  Then later, after you've had a chance to size the
 
whole situation up, you could ask for monies for documentation
 
purposes.  This would have to be carefully timed. but might be
 
a possible alternative.
