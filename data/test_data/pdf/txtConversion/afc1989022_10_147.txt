Dino Cinel: "Italians in the United States"

ITALIANS IN THE UNITED STATES 
"Come to California, the ideal Italy of the 
world." This was the opening statement in one of the 
pamphlets put out in 1871 by the California Immigration 
Union, a private organization promoting immigration to the 
Golden state.' The argument made in the pamphlet was that 
California offered all the geographical advantages of Italy, 
without the social and economic problems besieging the 
peninsula in the late nineteenth century. Obviously, the 
booklet concluded, every discriminating Italian should have 
known that California had a better future than Italy. We do 
not know whether the pamphlet had an impact in promoting 
emigration to California; we do not even know whether it was 
translated into Italian. But we know that by the late 1880's 
emigration to California, and especially to San Francisco, 
was a mass phenomenon fueled by the same dynamics of chain 
migration which determined Italian emigration all over the 
world. Early emigrants, mostly adventurers and merchants, 
opened the doors to relatives and friends wh❑ in turn sent 
for other relatives and friends in a cycle which continued

until the 1924's, when the policies set in place by the 
National Origins Act and the 1929 Depression brought the 
phenomenon to an end. 2 
This essay discusses Italian immigration in the 
United States in general, with particular reference to the 
characteristics of the phenomenon on the West Coast. The 
most salient aspect of the Italian experience on the West 
Coast is an elaboration on the motif orchestrated initially 
by the California Immigration Union: California was an 
exceptional place and Italians who settled in the Golden 
state considered themselves an exceptional group. This 
attitude was noticeable especially among Italians who 
settled in San Francisco. As early as 1867 San Francisco 
Italians had declared themselves through one of their 
newspapers La Voce del Ropolo, the "model Italian colony in 
the United States," perhaps because most of them came from 
the Italian north, whereas all other Italian colonies in 
North America were almost exclusively made up of 
southerners. "The Italians of San Francisco," the newspaper 
argued, " enjoy a better reputation among Americans than 
Italians in Chicago, New York and New Orleans. Besides, they 
are generally more successful than those in other cities."3

In 1911 Ettore Patrizi, the editor of the San Francisco 
Italians newspaper L'Italia published a pamphlet to 
celebrate the exceptional nature of the Italian experience 
in California. The pamphlet published in Italian had a wide 
circulation both in California and in Italy.4 
Italians in Italy too soon regarded the Italian 
experience in California as exceptional. In the two 
international expositions which were held in Turin in the 
early 1900's California Italians were the most documented 
and praised group. Educated visitors who toured the Italian 
colonies of the United States at the turn of the century 
reported to Italy on the abysmal conditions of Italians in 
New York and Chicago; but were full of praises for the 
California Italians, especially those in San Francisco.5 And 
the belief that California Italians were exceptional 
continued to this very days. Amateur historians of Italian 
background born and raised in California have extolled until 
recently the exceptional nature of the Italian experience in 
California. A couple of decades ago, for instance, Andrew 
Rolle argued that whereas Italians on the east coast were 
uprooted, those in the west were upraised.6 
Perhaps the attitude of the California's Italians 
simply mirrored the general perceptions of California by

Californians and other Americans. California has been 
consistently considered an exceptional place, the golden 
west, the last frontier, the best that America had to offer. 
A combination of pleasant climate, seemingly endless 
economic opportunities, and lack of oppressive social 
structures fueled the perception. Perhaps, this perception 
of California exceptionalism will vanish quickly, as we 
learn about financial deficits, seemingly intractable social 
problems and the setting in of economic cycles that make the 
west much like the rest of the nation. But was the Italian 
experience in California exceptional, if we compare it to 
the Italian experience in the United States? Perhaps t❑ a 
degree it was exceptional. But if study the basic dynamics 
of the Italian experience in California we discover that the 
differences were more superficial than substantial. 
From 1861 to 1940 20 million Italians departed 
from Italy for other countries. This is a staggering number, 
if we take into account that in 1901 Italy counted 33 
million inhabitants. But, fortunately, most of the 
departants were second or third time emigrants. Data 
elaborated by Antonio Bellettini show that the net loss of 
population for Italy from 1861 to 1940 was 7.7 million 
people. This indicator points out that emigration from Italy 
was a mass phenomenon and that return migration was the rule 
for a long period

highest number of net population losses for Italy with 1.43 
million people; in the previous decade of 1881-i890 and the 
following decade of 1901-1910 the net population losses were 
slightly over one million in each period. 8 Contrary to a 
commonly shared belief, it was not the Italian south which 
reported the highest population losses. Rather it was the 
Italian northeast who suffered the most. In the period 1891-
1900, for instance, 49 percent of the Italians leaving for 
international destinations were from the northeast, whereas 
only 33.3 percent left from the south, the balance coming 
from other regions of Italy. 9 Italians from the northeast, 
however, did not travel long distances. Their destinations 
were the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Germany, France, 
Switzerland and Great Britain to a lesser degree. Overseas 
destinations, especially Brazil and Argentina, attracted 
only a small percentage of the Italians leaving the 
northeast. Southern Italians, on the other hand, headed 
almost exclusively for overseas destinations. Until the 
early 1890's Brazil and Argentina were the preferred 
destinations of southern Italians. By 1900, the United 
States had become the almost exclusive destination of 
southerners for a variety of reasons. Wages in the United 
States were substantially higher than in Brazil and 
Argentina. The cost of the transatlantic crossing was 
cheaper for the United States than for destinations to South

American ports. The United States economy, notwithstanding 
some downturns, was expanding at an astonishing rate at the 
turn of the century, while the economies of Brazil and 
Argentina entered a prolonged crisis in the 1e90's. The 
types of jobs to be had in the United States were more 
appealing to southern Italians, who in general did not 
contemplate a permanent settlement in the United States. By 
the early twentieth century most Italian communities in the 
United States were southern Italian preserves. There were 
some exceptions, especially in rural America and in the 
west, especially in San Francisco, where northerners 
outnumbered southerners.
10 
Why did so many Italians emigrate? The traditional 
explanation has been that poverty forced Italians to sees; 
economic opportunities outside the national territory. 
(Incidentally, we should not forget that many Italians 
emigrated internally. The three main destinations were the 
rice paddies of Lombardy, the Roman countryside, and the 
vineyards on the province of Bari. These internal migration 
preceded the international migrations and continued unabated 
even after emigration for international destinations became 
a mass phenomenon.) Of course, emigrants were not rich 
people. But poverty does not explain mass emigration either. 
Italian peasants had been poor for centuries; yet they never

contemplated emigration. Moreover, the poorest of the poor 
did not emigrate. Data available show that the poorest 
people generally accepted their condition, perhaps because 
they were unable to generate even the money necessary for a 
first departure. Finally, if Italians wanted to escape the 
abysmal poverty of their towns, especially in the south, why 
did so many of them return? And why did return migration 
continue for so long, even when returnees realized that a 
successful resettlement in Italy was most difficult?" 
The mass emigration of Italians, and especially of 
those from the south, was prompted by the intersection 
between evolving individual expectations on the one hand and 
the economic dynamics unleashed by the growth of large scale 
capitalism in northern Europe and in the United States on 
the other. At this point our argument focus on the 
emigration from the Italian south, although at times we will 
establish comparisons with Italy as a whole. Traditionally 
southern Italian peasants had been depicted by visitors from 
the Italian north and from abroad as fatalistic, passive, 
and totally destitute. 
12 Sidney Sonnino, for instance, wrote 
in the early 1870`s: "Our southern peasants live in worse 
conditions than the serfs of the Middle Ages. Their

willingness to react seems to have died ages ago "1S Yet, by 
the early 187Q's southern prefetti reported to the central 
government in Rome that local peasants were showing 
restlessness, and some of them were joining subversive 
organizations or groups of bandits. And the prefetto fo 
Cosenza, in the deep south, added: "Peasants today have 
embraced the idea that they are entitled to a better life 
than the one they have. "14 
The new ferments stirring the southern peasant 
masses had been greatly enhanced by that same government 
which was now trying to suppress them. It was the 
Risorqimento Nazionale that opened the eyes of the southern 
masses. Following movements of national integration which 
affected all western nations in the nineteenth century, 
Italy too embraced a process of national unification. The 
Kingdom of Piedmont spearheaded a political process which 
ended with the political unification of the several Italian 
states, the Papal states included, in what became the 
kingdom of Italy in 1877. The process was supported mostly 
by the northern Italian bourgeoisie, which envisioned 
increased economic opportunities for itself though the 
creation of a national market. Of course, the process of 
political unification forced the kingdom of Piedmont into 
several wars against the Bourbon King of the Two Sicilies,

the Pope and the Austro-Hungariam Empire. The support of the 
peasant masses for the wars and the sacrifices it demanded 
was secured by promising peasants, especially those in the 
south, land properties after the wars. In fact, the new 
Italian state had access to large tracts of land: some 
belonged to the public domain of the former states, other - 
and it was the best land - belonged to the Catholic Church 
which was expropriated through a series of laws enacted 
between 1860 and 1870. 
Land, of course, had been for centuries the only 
avenue to economic well being and social respectability 
especially in the south. And as they fought in the wars, 
peasants began to envision a better future for themselves 
and their families. But the promises were not kept. Giuseppe 
Garibaldi, the general who led the army in the conquest of 
the south and the most vocal public figure in promising land 
to peasants who fought with him, was sent into exile by the 
Italian government as soon as the south was secured for the 
tong of Italy. The bitter disappointment led southern 
peasants to open rebellion and banditism, phenomena which 
threatened the survival of the new state and engaged the 
Italian army more fiercely than the armies of the foreign 
kings they ha fought only a few years before. Eventually the 
rebellions were put down and banditism was confined to some 
regions of the high Sila and the Sicilian hinterland. But 
the peasants' determination to own land was not defeated. 
14 
Overseas emigration from the south was embraced by and large 
to generate the savings necessary to buy land in Italy. 
Southern peasants were not totally alone in 
formulating and pursuing their aspirations within the larger 
frame of reference of the rise of a modern Italy. Some 
perceptive politicians and intellectuals, especially from 
Florence and Milan, advanced the argument that a modern 
state cannot achieve political and economic stability 
without the support of the masses. And the masses would give 
such support only if they had a stake in the economic, 
political and social processes of the nation. There were too 
few landowners in Italy, intellectuals argued. It was 
imperative, they recommended, that the government create new 
homesteads. The franchise to vote too had t❑ be enlarged 
from the mere 3 percent of the 1864 to a much larger 
percentage. Of course, the large landowners of the south, 
who for centuries had exercised total domination over the 
region, were able to defeat through their representatives in 
Rome every measure intended to curtail their power and to 
protect the peasants. And after two decades of national 
unity it was obvious that southern large landowners had the 
upper hand and that the Italian government was powerless in 
changing the social and economic structures of the south. 
Liberal politicians and intellectuals, who had initially 
opposed emigration as a destabilizing force, in time 
supported emigration as the only way to generate the cash 
the south needed in order to ruin the large landowners, 
11 
modernize the southern economy, and democratize the 
political process in the region. 
The spectacular economic growth of the United 
States economy in the second half of the nineteenth century 
was the objective reality which made possible the 
fulfillment of the expectations of southern Italians. This 
story is well known to Americans. What Americans do not know 
is how Europeans were taken by surprise when the American 
economy took off. Ironically, peasants and emigrants 
intuitively and through their own experience sensed the 
unprecedented nature of the American economic growth earlier 
than educated people. For instance, in 1875, when Italian 
emigration to the United States was already a noticeable 
phenomenon, La Democrazia, a Rome newspaper, ran a newsitem 
to reassure Italians that they had nothing to fear from 
American competition. After all, the newspaper argued, half 
of the American population was made up of ex convicts and 
the other half was still European. Europe, the argument 
went, had dominated the world economy for centuries and was 
going be the driving force for centuries to come. 
Incidentally, the writer of the article projected that 
Americans could become serious competitors in the world 
economy by the year 2,000 at the earliest." 
In reality, it became painfully obvious by the 
early 1880's that the European economy was unable to compete 
against the United States economy. And teams of European

12 
observers, British and French heading the list, sent by 
their governments crossed the Atlantic in fact finding tours 
to report back to their government why the American economy 
had taken off so quickly. The Italian government too sent a 
delegation headed by Egisto Rossi, a respected economist." 
In his report Rossi pointed out that the American advantage 
stemmed from a variety of factors: better transportation, 
lower taxes, protection of private property, promotion of 
property status, the absence of military expenditures, 
willingness to embrace innovation and experimentation and in 
general an entrepreneurial spirit which contrasted quite 
sharply with the much more acquiescent Italian temperament. 
In his report Rossi made some recommendations for changes 
which could make the Italian economy more competitive. ❑ne 
such recommendation was to lower tares in order to allow a 
larger number of individuals to save money and buy land. But 
it was obvious to Rossi and to everybody else who had any 
understanding of the Italian social and political structures 
that the recommended changes would not be set in place. The 
control of the traditional landed elites was too strong. The 
Italian government, besieged by so many internal problems, 
found imperative to raise taxes instead of lowering them. If 
peasants needed money to buy land, they had to turn 
elsewhere than to their government. Those savings had to 
come from the United States.

Obviously, in this scenario, the United States was 
not the final destination for southern Italians. Rather, it 
was a place where one could go and make money in order to 
invest at home. Very few Italians departed with the 
intention ❑f a permanent resettlement in the United States, 
or even in brazil and Argentina for that matter." Data 
available in many Italian towns archives show that less than 
15 percent of departing Italians declared that they did not 
intend to return. ❑f course, we cannot take a declaration of 
intention as an accurate statement of what emigrants 
intended to do. Other statistics, however, amply document 
that return migration was the rule, a phenomenon which did 
not endear Italians to Americans. 1° Americans objected to 
Italians returning to Italy on patriotic and economic 
ground. THe refusal to resettle permanently in the United 
States was interpreted as a gross disregard for the 
uniqueness and superiority of America over Europe. In 
addition the frugal habits of Italians in the United States 
and the substantial savings they channeled to Italy were

regarded as detrimental to the national economy. Money had 
to be spent where it was made, Americans argued.
19 
In Italy, however, returnees were welcome, mostly 
because of the savings they brought along. By the early 
1890's it was obvious that although individual savings were 
rather modest, their aggregate was substantial, as southern 
prefetti reported to Rome. 20 The arrival of the American 
remittances removed whatever opposition still remained among 
political and educated elites to mass emigration, initially 
regarded as a potentially distabilizing force. And the same 
elites began to envision a new south, with individuals 
converted to a modern frame of mind created by their 
American experience and with a modern economy fueled by 
investments made possible by American savings. Very few 
events fired the imagination of Italians and created high 
expectation as return migration and American remittances 
did. 21 Antonio Mangano, an American minister who visited the 
Italian south in the early twentieth century, reported in a 
series of articles which he wrote for Charities and the

the face of the south and creating what he called "the 
American fever.

Going to America to save some money 
became so popular among young males that in some 
communities, as the same Mangano reported, young men who had 
not emigrated for a time had a hard time finding a bride. 
Unfortunately the anxiously awaited economic 
renaissance of the south through returnees and American 
remittances did not materialize for a combination of 
personal and structural shortcomings. At the personal level, 
returnees were not the new men celebrated by educated 
Italians. Most returnees had lived in Italian enclaves with 
little or no contact with the larger American society and 
with menial jobs. Their attitudes had only superficially 
changed and often not for the better, as observers 
eventually discovered and reported with disappointment. 
Besides, returnees who bought land had no experience in 
running small farms successfully. In most cases these 
returnees failed miserably, mostly because of lack of 
experience and unwillingness to embrace any cooperative 
enterprise with other returnees. The ancient individualism 
proved to be the worst enemy of southerners one more time. 
At the structural level, the efforts of returnees were bound 
to fail because of the changing nature of agrarian economies 
in the western world. By the late nineteenth century small

Toritto and San Uemetrio," Charities and the Commons, 20

16 
economic operations, small farms included, were becoming 
obsolete and unprofitable. The dynamics of large scale 
capitalism was pushing economic operations in the direction 
of consolidation, integration, mass production and mass 
consumption. Besides, the opening up of new vast 
agricultural frontiers, like the American West, Canada, 
Brazil, Argentina and Australia brought about an oversupply 
of agricultural products which depressed prices of farm 
commodities substantially, especially from 1875 to 1400. 
Returnees, of course, were unaware of such vast changes. And 
they could not understand why it had become impossible to 
support a family on a small farm. 
The most puzzling aspect of return migration was 
that it continued for decades, and persisted even when it 
had become obvious that the successful returnees were the 
exception. This should not lead us to conclude that Italian 
emigrants and returnees were unable to make rational 
decisions in economic matters. Rather, it indicates that 
Italian emigration was so deeply linked to the idea of 
returning and getting established at home that return 
migration persisted even when the economic usefulness of 
returning had been proven false. Although other group of 
"new immigrants" (that is the immigrants who arrived after 
1887, when southern and eastern European outnumbered 
northern Europeans) returned in large numbers, like the 
Yugoslays, and the Polish, Italian returnees were by far the 
17 
largest number. Their mass return migration is the first 
such phenomenon in modern history. 
Mass return migration and its persistance for a 
number of decades had a great impact on the history of 
Italians in the United States. And unfortunately such impact 
has been largely negative or at least ambivalent. First, 
American remittances sent to Italy subtracted enormous sums 
which could have been otherwise invested in the United 
States. The remittances sent to Italy greatly delayed the 
economic advancement of Italians in the United States. It 
was not until the 19i0's that Italian immigration in the 
United States became increasingly permanent, as the social 
and economic problems affecting Italy immediately after 
World War I advised many Italians that there was no room for 
them in Italy. Second, mass return migration caused a 
constant turnover of population among Italian communities in 
the United States. Such turnover adversely affected not only 
the economic advancement of the community, but its ability 
to organize efficiently as well. Third, the orientation 
toward return made less pressing the need to understand the 
dynamics of American society and less compelling the 
argument in favor of assimilation. Finally, the movement 
back and forth between Italy and the United States created 
such deep ambivalence among many immigrants that their final 
resolution in favor of a permanent settlement in the United 
States was more the result of necessity than a clear choice. 
1.8 
The mass return movement from the United States, 
movement that as I mentioned before lasted until the Great 
Depression, shows that, although the great migration of 
Italians to the United States occurred at the turn of the 
century, the real Italian settlement in the United States is 
much more recent. Perhaps we should date the Italian 
immigration in the United States with the 193D's or, even 
more precisely, with World War II. And this remark is 
important. With many exceptions, Italians in the United 
States should be counted with the recent immigrants, rather 
than with the new immigrants. This conclusion has, of 
course, profound implications as we assess the degree of 
assimilation to American society and the trajectory it is 
following among Italian Americans. In many ways Italian 
Americans are a unique group. Seemingly, they have been in 
the United States since the turn of the century; in reality 
they became permanent residents of the country only a few 
decades ago. 
These basic dynamics affected all Italian 
immigration in the United States, with minor regional 
variations. Italian who emigrated to the West Coast, and to 
California specifically, shared the goals of Italians in 
other parts of the nation. Notwithstanding the distance 
between Italy and the West Coast (the overland passage from 
New York to San Francisco was as expensive as the crossing 
of the Atlantic), return migration from San Francisco too 
was the rule. A report written by a San Francisco Italian in 
19 
1897 lamented the social problems created by the constant 
turnover of Italian population in the city. 23 And the 
problem persisted well into the twentieth century. In 1913, 
for instance, the problems created by the constant turnover 
of Italian population in San Francisco became so 
unmanegeable that the California Commission on Immigration 
and Housing had to step in to find a solution to what was 
then called "the Italian problem. 1124 But, regardless of 
these problems, there were indications that San Francisco 
Italians had advantages over Italians in other American 
cities. The most obvious advantage was a capable and 
enlightened leadership. While other Italian communities in 
the United States were struggling for lack of leadership, 
San Francisco Italians benefitted from a handful of 
individuals with financial skills, who established sound 
banking institutions. In 1893 James P. Fugazi opened the 
Columbus Savings and Loan Society, followed by the Italian 
American bank established in 1899 by the prominent 
businessman Marco 
J. Fontana, who had been the prime mover 
in the development of the Italian-Swiss Colony. In 1906 the 
Italian People's Bank came into existence, soon followed by 
the Banca d'Italia established by Amadeo P. Giannini. In

the 1934's changed its name to the present Funk of America. 
It was Giannini who preached incessantly to Italians in San 
Francisco that it was more advantageous for them to keep 
their savings in San Francisco and settle in the city that 
to dream of a peace of land in Italy. 27 And many of them 
listened. Italian immigration in San Francisco became 
permanent sooner than Italian immigration in other cities of 
the United States. 
The determination common among Italian immigrants 
to buy small properties in Italy explains not only why mass 
return migration occurred, but also why Italians who 
eventually settled in the United States permanently engaged 
in specific economic activities. In general in the late 
nineteenth century the average Italian peasant regarded the 
ownership of a small land property as the ultimate solution 
to his economic problems. Small land properties had 
traditionally provided both economic self sufficiency and 
social status. This had been the case for as long as 
peasants could remember. Returnees wh❑ finally achieved that 
goal were quite baffled when they realized that by the turn 
of the century small properties no longer provided the 
economic security they had traditionally offered. Obviously 
immigrants and returnees could not comprehend the economic 
dynamics which were affecting their lives. The goal of small

land properties made economic sense in western economies of 
traditional small scale capitalism. But in the late 
nineteenth century the rise of large scale capitalism in the 
United States and northern Europe was progressively making 
obsolete the economic usefulnees of small land properties. 
The name of the game was consolidation and mass production 
for expanding urban markets. Italian emigrants and returnees 
pursued with passion a goal which they themselves 
contributed to make obsolete through their emigrations. 
But, even when they decided to settle permanently 
in the United States, Italians pursued economic goals shaped 
by the increasingly outdated perspective of small scale 
capitalism. As the American economy was increasingly 
striving toward consolidation, mass production and mass 
marketing through a corporate structure which reshaped both 
industrial and agricultural productions, Italian immigrants 
felt most comfortable in small scale operations geared to 
family ownership and control. Of course, a large number of 
Italians never saved enough money to open a business of 
their own, but those who did avoided corporate America. In 
San Francisco, for instance, immigrants with substantial 
savings bought land properties around the city, which 
provided jobs for all the family members. Immigrants with 
smaller savings opened fruit and vegetables stands, and 
eventually grocery stores and restaurants. A few energetic 
individuals entered the world of large scale capitalism, 
like Andrea Sbarboro, Marco J. Fontana and Amadeo P. 
22 
Giannini. But they were the exception even in San Francisco. 
For a long time the world of the immigrants was shaped by 
small scale capitalism. 26 And this world view had a large 
impact an the total experience of Italian immigrants. 
We can categorize the Italian experience in the 
United States in two chronological stages. The first goes 
from the early 1874's, when mass immigration started, to the 
mid 1924's; the second from the 1924'to the present. The 
first period was characterized by mass return migration, 
rapid turnover of populations in Italian communities, 
unemployment or underemployment, social dislocation, and 
reliance on regional loyalties to build networks of social 
and economic support. The second period was marked by 
permanent settlement, better jobs, the emergence of national 
Italian organizations, and a progressive Americanization 
through the political process and the progressive 
identification with national goals. World WAr II played a 
major role in focusing the attention of Italians toward the 
United States. 
The first phase was most tormented. And mass 
return migration and the consequent turnover of the 
immigrant populations were not the exclusive reasons. 
Another reason was that emigrants who left Italy at the turn 
of the century carried with them regional not national 
loyalties. Italy became a politically unified nation in 
1874. But traditional regionalisms so strongly and

effectively resisted the process of national integration 
that separatist movements kept emerging throughout the 
history of the nation. In the United States regional 
loyalties determined the lives of immigrants. They generally 
settled among immigrants from the same region. They married 
within their own group. Even jobs were controlled in the 
same way. In San Francisco, for instance, truck farming was 
controlled by the Genoesi, whereas the marketing of the 
produce was in the hands of the Lucchesi. Southern Italians 
were excluded from these activities. In fishing, the Genoesi 
controlled deep sea fishing, whereas the Sicilians were 
allowed only in land fishing. And the story could be 
repeated for countless other Italian communities in the 
United States 
.27 Even the social life of immigrants revolved 
around regional organizations. In every American city 
Italians established mutual aid societies open only to 
immigrants from a given region. In many instances membership 
was restricted to immigrants from a given town. Perhaps 
nowhere else was the parochialism of social clubs as visible 
among Italians than in New Orleans 
.211 
But even during the first phase, Italians showed 
interests in supraregional activities through local churches

and the ethnic press. The relationship Italians had with the 
Church was a tormented one. On the one hand the Catholic 
Church had been perhaps the most powerful organization in 
Italy. On the other, Italians had developed over the 
centuries a deep seated anticlericalism which made them 
quite skeptical or even antagonistic to the power of the 
clergy. Many Italians in the United States avoided any 
formal affiliation with the Catholic Church, much to the 
dismay of the local clergy which expected a quite different 
behavior from individuals coming from regions so close to 
the Vatican. But those who did, obviously embraced a set of 
beliefs and even social practices that were supraregional, 
and to a degree even universal, in character 
. 29 The ethnic 
press too played a role in establishing common bonds among 
Italians from different regions. But, unlike the Church, the 
ethnic press was a new experience for most Italians. Italian 
immigrants with some formal schooling were rare, especially 
at the very beginning. Those who had formal schooling were 
likely to be political exiles, who created the ethnic press 
to promote their political beliefs. Italian businessmen soon 
joined the venture by using the press to advertise. And 
regional societies patronized the ethnic press to advertise 
their social activities and to report on celebrations. The 
early press was rather rudimentary both in style and 
content. Eventually, newspapers were published at regular 
intervals, the style improved, and immigrants could follow

political developments in Italy through the ethnic press. 
Notwithstanding strong efforts to settle in ethnic enclaves, 
Italian immigrants too could not avoid a degree of 
geographical dispersion in America cities. The ethnic press 
provided the linkage among scattered Italians." 
The first phase of the Italian experience in the 
United States has been painful. Some historians, however, 
have argued that on the West Coast things were different. 31 
Perhaps they were to a point. But any historian who takes 
the time to chronicle the San Francisco experience realizes 
that the first phase was characterized but social and 
economic dislocations of major proportions. Unemployment was 
rampant in the 1890's among San Francisco Italians. Local 
unions rejected Italian immigrants, even those carrying 
membership cards from eastern cities. When in the 1890's 
large number of Italian miners arrived from Nevada and Utah, 
San Francisco Italians almost staged a revolt. Anarchist 
sympathies were rampant among Italians in the 1890's. The 
arrival of increasing numbers of southern Italians in the 
1890's created tensions which persisted for a long time. And 
San Francisco Charities often lamented the persistence of 
what they defined "the Italian problem," that is the large 
numbers of Italians needing public assistance. It was only 
in the 1920's that San Francisco Italians, as a group. began 
to experiment some form of prosperity. The first phase of 
so.

the Italian experience in San Francisco was coming to an 
end. 
The second phase of the Italian experience in the 
United States began with the Great Depression, matured 
during World War II and expanded in the post war decades. 
Italians set aside the dream of returning to Italy and 
invested their savings in the purchase of a house. The more 
fortunate opened their own family business. Perhaps the 
largest number of investments was made in the food industry, 
from the production of food, to the marketing of it. Real 
estate too found many converts among Italians. It is safe to 
say that investments in real estate replaced for many 
Italians the traditional investments in land. In general 
Italians avoided the corporate world of America which was 
becoming increasingly common in business and opted in favor 
of small scale capitalism. The ideal of the small farm in 
Italy was replaced by the new goal of the small and family-
owned business. That was the America of the Italians. 
World War II offered Italians a twofold 
opportunity: on the one hand it gave them a sense of 
national pride and identity they had never been allowed to 
experience before; on the other hand it led the children of 
the immigrants out of the ethic enclaves of their parents 
into the larger American and international world. By joining 
the army, the children of the Italians came in contact with 
a world that their parents had never imagined. When they 
returned from the war the children of the Italians found the 
27 
immigrant enclaves in which they had been raised suffocating 
and no longer acceptable. As they got married immediately 
after the war, they settled among "Americans." But 
invariably, on Sunday at noon the children of the immigrants 
with their small children returned to the paternal house for 
spaghetti and meatballs and for a short immersion in a world 
which they had left gladly, but which was still such a part 
of their lives. 
Today, the immigrant enclaves are historical 
Iandmarkes we preserve with devotion and nostalgia, and 
perhaps with a keen sense of their commercial value as 
center of tourism. Noth Beach, for instance, an old Italian 
enclave in San Francisco, is a must for almost all tourists 
visiting the city. Italian Americans today live intermingled 
with other Americans in cities, suburbs and the countryside. 
But Italian Americans have an identity of their own. On the 
one hand, they feel they are bona fide Americans like all 
the other new immigrants (those who arrived at the turn of 
the century). On the other hand, many of them feel they are 
now left behind by the political process which is so very 
concerned with the social and political promotion of the so 
called minorities, especially of the blacks. Italian 
Americans have an identity which is still problematic. On 
the one hand, they want to be like other Americans. On the 
other hand, they feel left behind. But in general Italian 
Americans have joined mainstram American society.
