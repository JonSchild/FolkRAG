'Road to Richmond. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
When I 
was young, and in my prime 
Labor never done, 
I 
used to work, but took my time, 
Ten to one, never done, just begun. 
CHORUS. 
All hail, all hail, for we are under way, 
Under way, under way, 
Yah, we belong to the Union army, 
Say, did you say we leab ole Belchertown 
Under way, under way, 
Ho, we're on the road to Richmond; 
Say, did you say, 
We'll do old Jeff up brown. 
De speculator tink me nice, 
Labor neber don, 
De trader sell me for half price, 
Labor Reber done. 
All hail, all hail, &c. 
(5)

The Black Star Songster. 
Do trader ride upon a 
mule, 
The hog-eye keep his temper cool, 
He gib de word to go ahead, 
Den crack his whip and say nuff said. 
All hail, all hail, &c. 
Up the hill and down the dale, 
We followed up the Union trail, 
No time to rest, nor time to stop, 
One foot rise den tudder one drop: 
All hail, all hail, &c. 
We stired him up ' twas wid a 
pole, 
For fear that he might cotch a 
cole. 
When he come to Jehosseyfat, 
Didn't we cotch de ninetailed cat, 
All hail, all hail, & e. 
Wen night came on we pitch our tent, 
Den sing dis song and let her went. 
We all got hot, de door keep shut, 
Which put de trader in a 
sweat. 
All hail, all hail, & e. 
Now from dat time we mind our eye, 
De trader blow us up sky high, 
But when we got at Richmond town, 
We'll fotch a 
thousand dollars down. 
All hail, all hail, &c. 
Nancy Fat. 
As sung by liooley' s 
Minstrels. 
0 Nancy Fat she was a 
gal, 
Fair and tall and slender, 
The fairest gal I 
ever saw, 
In all the female gender ; 
A. lovely foot I 
know she had, 
Into a 
boot to thrust, 
The Black Star Songster. 
Her ankles small were made for use, 
To keep it from the dust. 
CHORUS. 
O Nancy Fat, what are you at, 
I 
love you as no other, 
O Nancy Fat, get out of that, 
With sweetness me you'll smother. 
O Nancy Fat she had a 
mouth, 
I 
cannot now describe it. 
It open'd like a 
safety valve, 
When she wish'd to divide it; 
And well I 
know she had a 
nose, 
And every body knows it; 
The end of it just lac:Ike(' as if 
The Brandy bottle froze it. 
Oh Nancy Fat, & c. 
O Nancy Fat had two such eyes, 
Like burnt holes in a 
blanket, 
The inspiration from her soul 
I 
took it in and drank it; 
She says this darkey am so sweet 
She lovcts me like molasses ; 
Dat small machine she calls her heart, 
Goes pit pat as it passes. 
0 Nancy Fat, & e. 
If Nancy Fat does marry me, 
How nice we'll live together, 
She and I 
and all the bairns 
Like ducks in rainy weather; 
As we march unto de church 
And hear do bells a 
ringing, 
De joy will break dis niggers heart, 
To hear de darkies singing. 
0 Nancy Fat, & e.

The Black .Star Songster. 
He was not Afraid to Die. 
As Sung by Heoley's Minstrels. 
Like a 
true and faithful soldier, 
He obeyed our country's call, 
Vowing to protect its banner, 
Or in battle proudly fall. 
Noble, cheerful, brave, and fearless, 
When most needed ever nigh; 
Always living as a 
Christian, 
He was not afraid to die. 
CHORUS. 
Those who cherished him and loved him, 
Now are left to weep and sigh, 
Yet we have these words to cheer us, 
lie was not afraid to die. 
To his wounded sick companions, 
He would tell sweet words of cheer, 
Softly bathe their heated foreheads, 
Till death's chariot drew near. 
Tell them of a 
land where ne'er 
Heard the cruel battle cry; 
Comfort them and tell them they should 
Never be afraid to die. 
Those who cherish, & c. 
Little ones at home will listen, 
For his cheerful voice in vain, 
But he's gone! nor tears, nor praying, 
E'er can bring him back again. 
Those who cherished him and loved him, 
Now are left to weep and sigh ; 
Yet we have these words to cheer us, 
He was not afraid to die. 
Those who cherish, &c. 
The Black Star Songster.

I 
Am Dreaming, Sadly Dreaming. 
As Sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming, 
Of the love that once was mine, 
But the past is past redeeming, 
And in sorrow now I 
pine. 
It has left me like the summer, 
With each joy and blooming flower; 
And now winter warlike comes, 
holds ray heart within his power, 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming, 
Of the love that once was mine, 
But the past is past redeeming, 
And in sorrow now I 
pine. 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming, 
Of the joys that once were mine, 
Of loves star so brightly gleaming, 
And which now has ceased to shine, 
In the darkness now I 
wander, 
For my happiness is o'er; 
And I 
fondly, fondly ponder, 
On the days that are no more. 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming, 
Of the love that once was mine; 
But the past is past redeeming, 
And in sorrow now I 
pine. 
Susy Brown. 
A Sung by bole y's Minstrels. 
There is a 
gal in our town, 
The prettiest gal for miles arouna, 
Her weight is just two hundred pounds, 
And her name is Susy Brown. 
10 
The Black Star Songster. 
And every night when day's work's done, 
She and I 
go in for fun, 
And make the other darkies run, 
Away from Susy Brown. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Susy Brown, 
The prettiest gal for miles around, 
Oh! Susy Brown, 
Can't you come down to town. 
I 
took Miss Susy to a 
ball, 
And there she captivated all, 
A 
great big nigger eight feet tall, 
Fell in love with Susy- Brown. 
But, when he asked the gal to dance, 
I 
golly, den he had no chance, ' 
'Cause down the room I 
did advance 
To salute Miss Susy Brown. 
Oh! Susy Brown, &c. 
About the middle of the night, 
The darkies they commenced to fight, 
And the nigger wenches all got tight, 
And so did Susy Brown. 
The Police came the room to clear, 
And took us up before the Mayor, 
And all the darkies they did swear, 
Against me and Susy Brown. 
Oh! Susy Brown, &c. 
You Don't Know how We miss You. 
By Permission of SAWYER & THOMPSON'. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
You don't know how we miss you, dear, 
How long the days now seem; 
Our once contented, happy home, 
is but a 
faded dream. 
The Black Star Songster. 
Your dear old father all the day, 
Does nothing else but mourn— 
At night, dreams you're home again, 
But wakes to find you're gone. 
CHORUS. 
But again we hope to meet you, 
Then our troubles will be o'er 
Oh! how fondly we will greet you, 
When we meet to part no more. 
Yes, darling, you but little know 
how chftnged and sad is home, 
All thoughts of cheerfulness and joy, 
Have vanished, faded, gone. 
'Tis true, the birds as sweetly sing, 
And flowers bloom as gay ; 
Yet, we are sorrowful and lone, 
While you are far away. 
But again, & c. 
Coney Island. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Myself and friends went out to ride in a gallus 
horse and wagon, 
First we went to Tunison's, and then to Coney 
Island. 
We passed every thing upon the road, you'd ought 
to seen us skiting, 
We were a 
lot of gay boys going to Coney Island. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, you ought to see us going, 
Two-forty in the dust, the old horse a-blowing, 
Oh, my, you ought to see us skiting, 
We were a 
lot of gay boys going to Coney- Island. 
The Black Star Songster. 
When we got out of the wagon, we was met by the 
waiter. 
We called for roast clams, a 
little brandy and water, 
Then we got cigars, went out doors for to smoke 
em, 
I 
tell you we had a gay time going to Coney 
Island. 
Oh, my, &c. 
Then we got some flip, which made us feel quite 
funny, 
And when we came to pay for it I 
found we had no 
money ; 
The landlord began to talk, my blood it got a 
bilin', 
.Then we had a 
kind of a 
fight going to Coney 
Oh, my, &c. 
Then they took us from the house and put us in 
the station, 
They fined us all five dollars for our intoxication; 
The landlord commenced the muss and we com-
menced the fightio', 
And I 
came very near getting shot for going to 
Coney Island. 
"I Know my Mother weeps for Me." 
As sung by ilooley's Minstrels. 
'Twas on a 
balmy summer night, 
As I 
lay gazing at the stars, 
Thinking of home, and hearts once light, 
That I 
had left to join the wars. 
And of my Mother far away, 
With step so feeble, cheek so pale, 
The Black Star Songster. 
13 
My thoughts then dwelt upon the day 
I 
left her as she said farewell. 
CHORUS. 
I know my Mother weeps for me, 
When all the world is hushed in sleep, 
0, soon may we the hour see, 
When need no longer weep. 
And as the midnight hour drew near, 
I 
fell asleep, and presently, 
I 
dreamed I 
saw my Mother dear, 
With open arms to welcome me. 
She could not speak, but 0, those tears, 
That lingered in her joyful eyes, 
Bespoke much more by far than lips, 
Could utter to her darling boy. 
I 
know my Mother, &c. 
I 
thought she clasped me to her heart, 
Impressed a 
kiss upon my brow, 
And bade her sorrows all depart, 
For nought but joy is with her now. 
The daylight broke, and with it, came, 
Sadly the truth ' twas but a 
dream; 
Dear Mother weep no more in vain, 
-While we our native land redeem. 
I 
know my Mother, &c. 
I 
know my Mother weeps for me, 
When all the world is hushed in sleep, 
0, soon may we the hour see, 
When Mother need no longer weep. 
Soon may our glorious Stars and Stripes, 
That blood- bought Banner of the Free, 
Wave proudly forth from every height, 
Proclaiming Peace and Liberty. 
I 
know my Mother. &c. 
14 
The Black Star Songster. 
The Lively Flea. 
A 
dainty fellow's the lively flea, 
That creepeth over young and old, 
His choice food is fat, no lean like he, 
And he's not very fond of the cold. 
You can't be too warm when he finds you in bed, 
To please his dainty whim, 
And a 
nice little baby that has been well fed, 
Makes a 
capital meal for him. 
CHORUS. 
Creeping where no light there be, 
A dainty fellow's the lively flea; 
Creeping where no light there be, 
A 
dainty fellow's the lively flea. 
Spoken.—Oh ! 
there's one of ' em. 
Vile disturber 
of my peace—thy life for all time, even from thy 
little tleahood, is a 
successim of most disastrous 
chances, even in the jaws of death, as thou art 
now. 
Whether ' tis nobler to suffer a 
combination 
of torments or take arms against the vile intruder, 
and end them thus :—[ Kills flea.] 
How fast he travels, how lightly he springs 
On his victim unconscious of ill, 
Never giving a 
thought to the torment he brings, 
But goes ruthlessly in for a 
fill. 
When in anger we seek him how slyly he hides, 
And joyfully laughs at your pain, 
And still we are calm, in concealment abides, 
Then returns and nibbles again. 
Spoken.—[ Catching a 
fleal—Perdition catch thee! 
the chance was thine, now ' tis mine. 
Who art 
thou'? " I 
am thy father's ghost, doomed for the 
night to crawl over thy body, and nip thee most 
dreadfully, and for the day to lurk in the blanket 
where no vile finger can pounce upon me." 
For 
The Black Star Songster. 
15 
these and all other blisters thou hast raised upon 
me, down, down to Hades, and say I sent thee 
thither.—SHAKESPEARE. 
Creeping where no light, & c. 
Old blankets are searched this dread foe to rout, 
And thousands are naird d' ye see, 
All sorts of clothing turned inside out, 
But we cannot get rid of the flea. 
This brave old fellow will turn out at night, 
And fatten upon he or she, 
For the stateliest man or woman he bites, 
We are all of us food for the ilea. 
Creeping where no light &c. 
[Catches a 
flea on the cheek.] 
For thou art lovely, fairer than night's queen, 
Whose silvered beauty imaged by the sun, 
Cannot be uttered by the tongue of man. 
Spoken.—Be sure ye prove my love, a-you know 
what lago, or thou had'st better been born a 
dog, 
Iago, a 
dog! 
Put out the lights! 
Now for the 
dreadful business 1 ! 
Creeping where no light, &c. 
The Contraband from Dixie. 
As Sung by nooley's Minstrels. 
I 
used to live in Dixie land, 
And work down on the bottom, 
With dearest Dinah by my side, 
I 
used to pick the cotton. 
But those happy days have all gone by, 
And sorrow fills the measure, 
For its killing father, brother and son, 
Now is the white folks pleasure. 
16 
The Black Star Songster. 
• 
CHORUS. 
Dixie, Dixie, ha ha ha ha, 
l'se a 
Contraband from Dixie, 
Their the cotton flowers grow. 
If they'd never had this war, 
And never had this clatter, 
It would be better for the white folks all, 
And that's what's the matter. 
Niggers now when they get up north, 
They think because its freedom, 
They isn't willing for to work, 
But want white folks for to feed 'ern. 
l'se a 
Contraband, & e. 
I 
wish this cruel war was over, 
And peace throughout the land; 
I'd be a 
happy darkie then, 
And not a 
Contraband. 
But politics is all the rage, 
With musket in the hand. 
They is gwine to put rebellion down, 
Then hurrah for uncle Sam 
I's a 
Contraband, &c. 
- 
Near the Banks of that Lone River. 
As sung by lIooley's Minstrel's 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lillies grow ; 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed, and faded long ago. 
How we met, and loved, and parted, 
None on earth can ever know, 
Nor how pure and gentle hearted, 
Beamed and mourned one year ago. 
CHORUS. 
Near the banks, & c. 
The Black Star Songster. 
I 
-7 
Like the stream with lillies 
Will life's future current flow; 
Till in Heaven I'll meet the maiden, 
Fondly cherished years ago, 
Hearts that love like mine forget not, 
They're the same in weal or woe. 
And that star of memory set not, 
In the grave of years ago. 
Near the banks, &c. 
Kearsage and Alabama. 
As Sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
The Alabama's gone, hurrah! 
To Davy Jones's locker far, 
Their's nothing left of her to mar, 
Our commerce on the sea. 
The hero of chronometers, 
Was vanquished by the stripes and stars, 
He'll long remember our Yankee tars, 
On board the ship Kearsage. 
CHORUS. 
The Alabama's gone, hurrah! 
To Davy Jones's locker far; 
Their nothing left of her to mar, 
Our commerce on the sea. 
The rebel pirates sought the fray, 
And for the Kearsage bore away, 
He thought to make a 
great display, 
And all of us astound. 
He hailed us with a 
full broadside, 
But yet no Yankee shot replied, 
Until the gallant Captain cried, 
" 
Como lads, give them a 
rouud !" 
The Alabama's gone, & e. 
Then came a 
sound that echoed far, 
With cheer on cheer from Yankee tars; 
And sinking ship, and trembling spar, 
A 
scene of death soon told_ 
Down to the bottom of the deep, 
Sank many a 
traitor for to sleep; 
While Semmes, hero like a 
sheep, 
Went to an English fold. 
The Alabama's gone, 
As sung by Hooleys Minstrels. 
Oh.list to me I 
pray, sirs, 
I'll tell you of a 
row, sirs, 
That happen'd to me and my sweetheart. 
Which caused us to part, sirs. 
Oh yes it did, indeed it did, 
Well it did though. 
CHORUS. 
Tid-ev-ri, tie-ev-ri, & c. 
One day I 
chanced to meet her, 
With true love I 
did greet her 
She stopped before a 
grocery, 
And axed me to treat her. 
Oh yes she did, indeed she did, 
Well she did though. 
Tid-ev-ri, tid•ev-ri, &e. 
Says 1, "my dearest honey," 
And then I 
looked so funny, 
"I've lots of love that I 
can prove, 
But I 
aint got no money. 
Oh no I 
aint, indeed I 
aint, 
Well I 
aint though." 
Tid-ev-ri, tid-ev-ri, &c. 
The Black Star Songster. 
19 
Says she "Young man, ' tis plain, sir, 
My love you'll never gain, sir, 
Get rid of hope, go buy a 
rope, 
And you may drown yourself. 
Oh yes you may, indeed you may, 
Well now you may." 
Tid-ev-ri, tid-ev-ri, &a. 
Tears from my eyes then started, 
I 
felt quite broken.-hearted, 
I 
turned around to say good-by, 
A.nd that's the way we parted. 
Oh yes it was, indeed it was, 
Well it was now. 
Tid-ev-ri, tid-ev-ri, &c. 
Monkey's Wedding. 
As sung by nooley's Minstrels. 
Monkey married the baboon's sister, 
Smacked his lips, and then he kissed her, 
Kissed so hard he raised a 
blister, 
She set up a 
yell! 
The bridegroom put on some -court-plaster, 
It stuck so fast it couldn't stick any faster, 
Sure, it was a 
sad disaster, 
But it soon got well. 
CHORUS. 
Monkey married the baboon's sister, 
Smacked his lips and then he kissed her, 
Kissed so hard he raised a 
blister, 
She set up a 
yell! 
What do you think the bride was dressed in, 
White gauze veil and a 
glass breastpin, 
Red kid shoes, she was quite interesting, 
She cut a 
mighty swell. 
20 
The Black Star Songster. 
He bride groom put on a 
clean shirt collar, 
And red cravat dey cost him a 
dollar, 
Ruffled shirt, the fashion to foller, 
He cut a 
monstrous swell. 
Monkey married, &c. 
What do you think they had for supper, 
Black eyed beans and bread and butter, 
Ducks in the duck pond, all of a 
flutter, 
Pickled oystcr stew. 
Chestnuts boiled and chestnuts roasted, 
Onions cut and onions toasted, 
Music in de corner posted, 
Waiting for the cue. 
Monkey married, &c. 
What do you think was the tune they danced to, 
Yankee Doodle and sometimes Jim Crow. 
Swallow-tailed, coats, and some got trod on, 
'Case (ley was so long. 
What do you think dey had for a 
fiddle 7 
An old banjo with a 
hole in the middle, 
Tambourine without any riddle, 
And dats de end of my song. 
Monkey married, &c. 
" 
What will You do, Love." 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
What will you do, love, when I 
am going, 
With white sails floWing the seas beyond, 
'What will you do, love, when waves divide us, 
And friends may chide us for being fond. 
Tho' waves divide us and friends be chiding, 
In faith abiding I'll still be true, 
And 
pray for thee on the stormy ocean 
In deep devotion, that's what I'll do 
The Black' Star Songster. 
21 
'What would you do, love, if distant tidings, 
Thy fond confidings should andermine, 
And abiding ' neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes as bright as thine'? 
"Oh name it not tho' guilt and shame 
Were on thy name. I'll still be true. 
But that heart of thine should another share it, 
I 
could not bear it, what would I 
do ?" 
What would you do, love, when home returning, 
With hopes high burning with wealth for you, 
If my barque which bounded o'er foreign foam, 
Should be lost near home, ah what would you do ? 
"So thou wert spared, I'd bless the morrow, 
In want and sorrow, that left. me you. 
And I'd welcome thee from the wasting billow, 
This heart thy pillow, that's what I'll do."

Mother Would Comfort Me. 
By permission of SAWYER & THOMPSON. . 
Sung by Heeley's Minstrels. 
Wounded and sorrowful far from my home, 
Sick, among strangers, uncared fors unknown, 
Even the birds that used sweetly to sing, 
Are silent and swiftly have taken the wing ; 
No one but Mother can cheer me to day, 
No one for me could so fervently pray. 
None to console me, no kind friend is near, 
Mother would comfort me if she was here. 
CHORUS. 
Gently her hand o'er my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to free me from pain and distress ; 
Kindly she'd say to me " Be of good cheer, 
Mother will comfort you, Mother is here." 
If she were with me I 
soon would forget 
My pain and my sorrow, no more would I 
fret, 
One kiss from her lips, or one look from her eye, 
Would make me contented and willing to die. 
Gently her hand on my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to free me from pain and distress, 
Kindly she'd say to me be of good cheer, 
Mother will comfort you, Mother is here. 
Gently her hand, &c. 
Cheerfully, faithfully, Mother would stay, 
Always beside me by night and by day, 
I 
f 
I 
should murmur or wish to complain, 
Her gentle voice would soon calm me again. 
Sweetly a 
Mother's love shines like a 
star, 
Brightest in darkness when daylight's afar, 
In clouds or in sunshine, pleasures or pain, 
Mother's affection is ever the same. 
Gently her hand, &c. 
Sparking Sunday Night. 
As siang.by flooley's Minstrels. 
Sitting in a 
corner on a 
Sunday eve, 
With a 
taper finger resting on your sleeve; 
Starlight eyes are casting on your face their light, 
Bless me, this is pleasant, sparking Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Sparking, sparking, sparking Sunday night, 
Bless me, aint it pleasant, sparking Sunday night. 
Dad and mam are sleeping iu their peaceful bed, 
Dreaming of the things the folks in meeting said. 
"Love ye one another," the Ministers recite, 
Bless me, don't we do it, sparking Sunday night. 
Sparking, sparking, &c. 
Hark! the clack is striking, ' tis two o'clock I 
swow, 
And sure as I'm a 
sinner the time to go has come. 
You ask in spiteful accents if that old clock is right, 
And wonder if it ever sparked on Sunday night. 
Sparking, sparking, &c. 
Two or three sweet kisses, five or six you hook, 
Thinking that you've robbed her, give back those 
you took. 
Then for home you hurry from the fair one's sight, 
Don't you wish each day was only. Sunday night.

Retribution. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
When this cruel war is over, boys, I 
tell you what 
we'll do, 
With the greatest fighting army the world ever 
kne w, 
We'll settle up our little debts, that then will just 
be due, 
As we go marching on. 
CHORUS. 
First we'll make a 
strike at Mexico, sir, 
And then Louis Napoleon we will show, sir, 
His intended monarchy we will overthrow, sir, 
As we go marching on. 
When this cruel war is over, Jenny Bull Vial come 
in next, 
For the thrashing that we'll give him, on the very 
first pretext, 
Ho will find the Yankee eagle, is a 
team when ho is 
vexed. 
As we go marching on. 
First we'll make, &c. 
'You tried you're best, you know you have, to break

By building ships for southern traitors, 
But you'll find out that you are wry small potatoes,

When this cruel war is over, and peace restored 
again, 
With a 
million fighting heroes, from the war safe

They'll be spoiling for a

main, 
And long to go marching on.

As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Uncle Sam, wake up! wake up! sure courage never 
fails you, 
Quickly then, put forth your strength, 
Crush these heartless traitors; 
Put your foot down firmly on the necks of 
Union haters. 
CHORUS. 
Come then, Uncle Sam, wake up! since courage nev-
er fails you, 
Crush all the traitors, North or South, 
Uncle Sam what ails you I 
Confiscate their stocks and farms, 
Do it with a 
vigor; 
If it will our Union save, confiscate the Nigger! 
Confiscate all, every thing, 
Even to their whiskey ; 
they find that to rebel is getting rather 
risky. 
Como then, Uncle Sam, & c. 
Uncle Sam, we know you're strong, 
Both on land and water, 
Why then with these Rebels play 
Meet them as you oughter. 
28 
The Black Star Songster.

Nor for a

Meet them man to man, at least 
Meet them with the halter.

Oh, My Love, He is a 
Sojer. 
As rang by Hoeley's Minstrels. 
My love he is a 
sojer -boy so gal-i-ant and bold, 
He's tall as a 
flag- staff, only nineteen years old, 
To fight for the Union, he's left his own dear, 
My heart it is bus-ti-ing because he's not here. 
CHORUS. 
For his spirit was tre-men-du-ous, 
And fierce to behold, 
In a 
young man bred a 
carpentier, 
Only nineteen years old. 
His parents bounded him for to be a 
carpentier, 
But a 
soldiers' life he very much did prefer. 
For his spirit was tremendous and fierce to behold, 
In a 
young man bred a 
carpentier only nineteen 
years old. 
For his spirit, &c. 
My bosom it is tossing just like the raging sea, 
For fear that his affection don't still point to me. 
A sweetheart can be found in each port I'm told, 
Especially for a 
young man just nineteen years old. 
For his spirit, &c. 
And it's oh for my lov-yu-er I 
grieve and repine, 
For fear this young man will never be mine. 
All the wealth of the Indies in silver or gold, 
I'd give for my sojer boy only nineteen years old. 
For his spirit, &c.

Macbeth. 
As sung by Mooley's Minstrels, 
Spoken.—The ensuing Scotch history is enveloped 
in fog and mist- cry, and to plunge at once into the 
fog—and the midst of the mist be kind enough to 
imagine that my march is now playing—band con-
sists of bag- pipes ( imitation of course), as played 
by the orchestra for Forrest and others. 
[Music 
commences with March from Macbeth.] 
Don't you 
hear it ? we're just arriving at an audible pitch. 
Now we're descending the hills; now were cross-
ing the brilge; now I'm coming on. 
I 
run the 
Thane of Cowdor, and this is the blasted heath I 
sing:— 
A drum! a 
drum! Macbeth doth come; 
Three weird hags, three weird hags, 
All clad in rags, broomsticks for nags. 
They stopp'd Macbeth upon the heath, 
And told the Thane of Cowdor's death, 
And hailed him king in the same breath, 
Did these three bags. 
Spoken.—Hail! hail! hail! 
Those are the hail-
stones pouring. 
King shalt thou reign— 
That's rain in torrents roaring ; fair is foul, and 
fowl is fare 
When stolen from a 
henroost, and whirl'd thro' 
the air, 
Vanish like lightning and fill ' ern with wonder. 
[Sings.] 
Now, Lady Macbeth was a 
fiend most dire, 
Than e'er sat on a 
toad- stool or fed on hell fire. 
And she vow'd to her lord if he would mount higher, 
He must do a 
deed of note most dire. 
3o 
The Black Star Songster. 
[Spoken.] 
He screw'd his courage up by getting tight a-bit, 
And when half screw'd resolved to make a 
night 
of it; 
Go—bid thy Mistress when the toddy's hot, 
She agitates the communicators on the spot. 
[Bell rings outside, Macbeth starts.] 
[Sings.] • 
Is this a 
dagger that's before me pointing, 
Making me tremble every limb and joint in? 
Tis there ! I 
see it bee, 
Come blade, let me clutch thee! 
tSpoken.] 
It strikes me forcibly I 
did'nt touch thee. 
[Sings.] 
I 
dinna ken but I'm the waur for drinkin', 
For I'm muckle sure its gane—my eyes like winkin', 
Deceive my sense, loot, loot, I 
ken the still, 
And drops of bluid that make the feelins' chill ; 
I 
see it dancing on the Wall, 
And douts of bluid by no means small. 
Oh ! hear it not ! oh ! hear it not ! 
Lady Mac! 
Oh! Lady Mac, be dad, 
Ye've mack'd me mad! 
[Spoken.] 
Hear it not, Duncan, for that's bell's intention, 
Summoncis thee to a 
place—we never mention. 
[Knocking Beard.] 
Whence is that knocking ? it appeals to me quite, 
I've reddish hands, my heart is turnip white. 
He has turned up his toes—a 
sight most shocking. 
[Knocking Violent.] 
That turn up my bed will—will you stop that 
knocking 7 
The Black Star Songster.

1 
[Sings.] 
Stop that knocking, 
Oh! stop that knocking, 
Oh! they'll never stop that knocking at the door. 
Stop that knocking, 
Oh! stop that knocking, 
Oh! they'll never stop that knocking at my door. 
[Spoken.] 
For the sake of brevity, we will now assume that 
Duncan is settled for life; that is to say, his earn 
of life is done, and having done all he can at this 
period of his history, we can have every right to 
consider him a Dun-can. 
Not so Macbeth, for 
having turned up King and won all the honors to 
himself, he puts down poor Banquo, by an odd 
trick, learns to play upon the fife, and ultimately 
sends to the dickens, by a very foul swoop, the 
whole brood of her chickens. 
[Sings.] 
Let's dance, let's dance upon the heath, 
We've won rare fun by Duncan's death; 
So sing with glee, the witches three, 
'Midst direst spells of sorcery. 
Old Banquo's dead, 
To Macbeth's spread 
Shall straight be led, 
With his gory head. 
And while they greet in hot and sweet, 
We'll swallow our flagon's of whiskey neat. 
The feast is rare, the King is there, and swarms of 
Scotch lasses, 
When 111abbeth cries, " gents all, I 
rise," 
Be pleased to fill your glasses. 
[Spoken.] 
I 
thank you for your companies, and still am in 
your debt, 
32 
The Black Star Songster, 
But its very odd that Banquo has'nt come to our 
banquet. 
I'm sure I 
need not speak his name to win your 
cheers; 
Here's to our good friend Banquo, then, and would 
that he were here. 
[Some person outside says, " here! here ."' Macbeth starts.] 
Avaunt! and quit my sight, he's on that chair; 
He plays a 
tune upon his bones. 
Oh! spectre stop 
that air. 
He shakes at me his gory locks, he's mocking with 
his eye ; 
I 
cry avaunt! but joke. 
I 
can't unseal mocker-
eye, 
Whose been and gone, and done this deed, ' 
Don't wink at me, false Thane spectre, go on—why 
so being gone, 
[Chord.] 
I've gained my pluck again; sure wal the obser-
vation of Macbeth on the departure of Banquo's 
spirit, when, having facetiously observed that he 
was delighted to give up the ghost, he resolved to 
try his luck at Acheron, by taking pot-luck with 
the witches. 
[Sings.] 
Then did he learn Macbeth should not be slain, 
"fill Birnamwood should come to Dunsinane; 
That no man, woman- born, should take his life, 
And also to beware of drum and fife. 
[Drum andAfe heard outside.] 
[Spoken.] 
That is the drum and fife which elicited the 
warnLig. 
[Sings.] 
March! March! Thane of fife, 
Ten thousand Britons are over the borders! 
The Black Star Songster. 
33 
March! March! soon we will take his life, 
Cut down the fir trees and bear them in order. 
Seyton beholds the trees, 
And quickly makes a 
breeze, 
Sir Birnamwood to his castle has wended 
Liar and slave d'ye see, 
If thou speak'st falsity, 
You shall be hanged, sir, or I'll be guspended. 
[Spoken.] 
Curse Dirnamwood; oh! would that I could 
burn 'em— 
These moving sights move me to be returning, 
Hang out the banners; quick—blow wind, come 
wrack. 
[Enter .21facctuff who cries.) 
Turn, hell-hound, back, 
No women-born, and no parients know'd 
Was hatchied by steam, and Topsy-like grow'd; 
Tyrant, the Thane of fife is here to smite thee, 
Therefore, if ' tis all the same to you, sir, I'll not 
fight thee. 
Then yield thee, coward. 
[Sings] 
Like the Russian bear to be bull baited, no I 
wont; 
I 
swear, tho' Birnamwood has reachad Macbeth's 
abode, 
And tho' opposed, who never patients know'd, I 
try, to grunt. 
[Spoken.] 
Say on Macduff, and thrash'd be he wno first 
cries " quantum Buff." 
[Battle takes place.] 
[Sings.] 
Duncan's wrong did Macduff right, 
Shrouded in mystery. 
Fell Macbeth was felled in fight, 
False moralist was he— 
All in vain this Dun-sei-nano; 
So having kilt our kilted Thane, 
Thus ends his sad history.

Dear Mother I 
remember well, 
The parting kiss you gave to me, 
When merry rang the village bell, 
My heart was full of joy, and glee. 
I 
did not dream that one short year, 
Would crush the hopes that soared so high; 
Oh, Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
CHORUS. 
Call Sister, Brother, to my side, 
And take your soldier's last good by, 
Oh, Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
Hark! Mother, ' tis the village bell, 
I 
can no longer with thee stay ; 
My country calls to arms, to arms, 
the foe advance in fierce array. 
The vision's past, I 
feel that now 
For country I 
can only sigh, 
Oh, Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
Call Sister, Brother, &c. 
Dear Mother, Sister, Brother, all, 
One parting kiss, to all good by ; 
Weep not, but clasp your hand in mine, 
And let me like a 
soldier die. 
I've met the foe upon the field, 
Where kindred fiercely did defy, 
I 
fought for right, God bless the Flag, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die.

Dark Gal Dress'd in. Blue. 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
From a 
village in New Hampshire, 
To Brooklyn here I 
came, 
To see the exhibition, and 
All places of great fame. 
But what I 
suffered since I 
came, 
I 
now will tell to you, 
How I 
lost my heart and senses too ' 
Through a 
dark girl dressed in blue. 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
fine gal, fol-de-riddle-ido, 
A. charmer, fol-de•riddle eh! 
'Twas on a 
Friday morning, 
The first day of August; 
When of that day I 
ever think, 
My heart feels ready to bust. 
I 
went in a 
six- penny omnibus, 
To the exhibition of sixty-two ; 
On a 
seat by the side of the door, 
Sat a 
dark gal dressed in blue. 
She was a 
fine gal, &c. 
When we arrived in Fulton Av, 
The lady looked so strange; 
The conductor said, " Your fare, ma'am," 
She said, " I 
have no change. 
36 
The Black Star Songster. 
I've nothing but a 
five- dollar note, 
What- ever shall I 
do 1" 
Said I " Allow me to pay," " 0, thank you sir," 
Said the dark gal dressed in blue. 
She was a 
fine gal, &c. 
We chatted and talked as we onward walked, 
About one thing or the other, 
She asked me too, oh! wasn't it kind, 
" 
If I 
had a

".0 yes," sayg.I, `! and a graudmother too, 
But pray, Miss, what are your

She was a 
fine gal, &c. 
We walked about for an hour or so, 
Through the building near -trulfar, 
Till we came to a 
grand refreshment room, 
I 
went straight up to the bar, 
She slipped in my hand a 
five dollar note, 
I 
said, " What are you going to do ?" 
" 
Don't think it strange, I 
must have,change,"

For I've to go to New York, 
To catch the Boston train."

And soon was lost to view. 
I 
turned to leave, when by,my side, 
Stood a 
tall man dressed in blue 
She was a 
fine gal, &c. 
This tall man said, " Excuse me, sir, 
I'm one of the X division; 
That note was bad, my duty is 
To take you on suspicion." 
Said I " For a 
lady I 
obtained the change." 
He said, " Are you telling me true 1 
Where's she live, what's her name'!" says I, 
" 
I 
don't know, she was a 
dark gal dress'd 
in blue." 
She was a 
fine gal, &e. 
My story they believed, they thought I'd been 
deceived, 
But they said I 
must hand back the cash: 
I 
thought it a 
sin as I 
gave them the tin. 
Away went five dollars smash. 
So all young men take my advice, 
Be careful what you do, 
When you make the aquaintance of ladies 
strange, 
Especially a 
dark gal dress'd in blue.

Let us speak of a

And heed not what others say, 
If he's frail, then a 
kind word may bind him, 
When coldness may turn him away. 
For the heart must be barren indeed,

Then pause, ere you cause it to bleed, 
When a

frown hangs it down.

So you'd better behave yourself, Barney O'Hea. 
Impudent Barney, none of your blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea.

I 
hope you're not going to Brandon Fair, 
To Brandon Fair, to Brandon Fair, 
For I'm not wanting to meet you there 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
For Corney's at Cork 
And my brother's at work, 
And my mother sits spinning at home all day, 
So no one will be there, of poor me to take care, 
So I 
hope you won't follow me, Barney () Ilea. 
Impudent Barney, none of your blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
But as I 
was walking up Brandon street, 
Up Brandon street, up Brandon street, 
Just who do you think that myself should meet, 
But impudent Barney O'Hea. 
He said I 
looked 
He called me a 
villain, 
I 
bid him that instant to get out of my way, 
He said I 
was joking, and grinned so provoking, 
I 
could'nt help laughing at Barney O'Hea. 
Impudent Barney, he has the blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea.

Rip Tearing Johnny - 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Oh, listen awhile, fair ladies of this town, 
And hear what I 
have got to say, 
Don't never place your affections on any young man, 
For that he might take and run away. 
Then you'll feel like a 
big sun-flower, 
Born in the merry month of spring, 
When the birds begin to sing, you'll begin to cry, 
Oh, my rip tearing Johnny's gone away. 
King Philips daughter was a 
very handsome gal, 
And she always kept her eyes right about her, 
40 
The Black Star Songster. 
She said, young men, now with preposessing looks, 
Tried young ladies hearts to slaughter. 
And when you do, they will look at you, 
From a 
glimmer of a 
rougish looking eye, 
And they'll begin to laugh, you'll begin to cry, 
That your rip tearing Johnny's gone away. 
Oh, listen fair ladies, of the bloomer- hat creation, 
• 
To a 
few more words I 
have to say, 
Be careful how you fling your little fans'around, 
Or you might accidently fan yourselves away. 
And then you'll float right through the air, 
Just like John Anderson's baloon, 
You'll arrive in California bythe light of the moon, 
And your rip tearing Johnny will meet you there. 
The Countryman's Visit. 
As sung by Itooley's Minstrels. 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
From Schenectady I 
came, 
A 
free and easy fellow, 
There's no need to tell my name. 
I 
know my way about a 
bit, 
With both eyes can I 
see, 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
But they don't get over me. 
I 
hailed a 
coach at the ferry, 
For to take me up town, 
I 
got as far as Hooley's, 
And there he set me down. 
Says I " Now, Mister, what's your fare 1" 
" 
Five dollars, sir," said he; 
Says I " I'm from the country, 
But you don't five dollars me." 
-At 
The Black Star Songster. 
41 
I 
went out to the Fashion Course, 
I 
wished to see the race, 
I 
found a 
crowd of sharpers there, 
Collected in the place. 
" 
I 
lay you odds," says one, " and lay 
The stakes with Captain B," 
Says I, " I'm from the country, 
But you don't Captain me." 
I 
took a 
walk about the course, 
There all the fun to view, 
They were playing various little games, 
And three-card monte too, 
A 
thimble- rigger wished. to 'bet, 
I 
could'nt find " the pea," 
Says I, " I'm from the country, 
But you don't thimble me." 
I 
visited a 
billiard room, 
Being inclined to -walk, 
When my opponent, from the pocket, 
Pulled out a 
piece of chalk. 
He let me win two quarter games, 
" 
Play you for a 
V," says he, 
Says I " l'm from the country, 
But you don't perform on me." 
The Conscripts' Lay. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Say, Conscripts, have you got your notice, 
For to gird your armor on; 
And go to fight for Uccle Sammy, 
away down in Washington. 
The draft has .changed our occupation, 
And though our feet are sore, 
We are coming father Abrahm, 
Three hundred dollars more. 
42 
The Black Star Songster.. 
CHORUS. 
They took us all, ha, ha, 
We could'nt dodge, hey, hey, 
And while we march for the Kingdom coming, 
We'll sing the .conscripts' lay. 
We are a 
healthy hungry army, 
Of hunk)' first class men, 
We are going to fight for the dear old Union, 
To have it back again. 
With our old banner waving o'er us, 
Oh, boys we surely can, 
Whip Be,auregard, Johnson, Lee, Jeff Davis, 
Or any other man. 
They took us ail, &c. 
We are going because the nation needs us, 
And while we're in the mu, 
We're bound to whip the rebels; certain, 
Or else there'll be a 
fuss. 
There ' s 
not a 
copperhead among us, 
Our record fair to stain, 
Nor are we troubled with that disorder, 
Called nigger on the brain. 
They toOk us all, &c. 
We couldn't raise our little three hundred, 
But for that we didn't much care, 
'We are a 
healthy band of brothers, 
That never sweat a 
hair. 
You'll see us back one of these fine mornings, 
When peace has come to stay, 
And then we never shall be sorry. 
We sang the conscript's' lay. 
They took us all, & c. 
The Black Star Songster.

The great Hen Convention. 
As Sung by lleoley's Minstrels. 
A famous hen convention was held at Humbug 
Green, 
And such a 
show of fuss and feathers, ne'er before 
was seen. 
With Malays, Bantams, Chittagong's, and game 
fowls fine and tall, 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai, cut the biggest swell of 
all. 
CHORUS. 
It was, cackle, cackle, flap your wings and crow, 
The Shanghai crowed the highest at the convention 
show. 
Says Malay, pulling out his quills, " I'm the biggest 
fowl," 
Says Bantum, " Your a 
hen-pecked race, hen-head-
ed with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " If you peck at me, you'll find I'm 
one of the b'hoys." 
It was cackle, &c. 
A. poultry duel came on straight, ' twas Bantum, 
Shanghai, 
A 
crow at first, and then a 
clip, and then the feath-
ers fly'. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, amid a 
loud con-
vention crow, 
And Shanghai crow'd the loudest at the great con-
vention show. 
It was cackle, &c.

Billy Nubbs. 
As sung by Hoeley's Minstrels. 
Now all agree to welcome me, at least all those who 
know it, 
Because Inv name stands first in fame, I'm Billy 
•Nabbs, the poet. 
And oft a 
friend to me did send, well versed in hu-
man nature, 
-With verses rare, none can compare, to stand the 
common-tater. 
{_Recitation a

well you suit the cause of human nature. 
None can compa.re I 
do declare, 
With thee, oh flowery tater, 
When eating's round, your're always found, 
Amidst all noise and racket, 
Sometimes in hash, sometimes in smash, 
And sometimes in your jackets; 
How oft have I 
young maids beheld 
Your flow'ry rinds a-peeling, 
With pointed knives dig out their eyes— 
They've got no fello;feeling. 
Now all agree, & c. 
My learned brains the money gains, a 
fact I 
never 
slighted, 
For I 
can write on politics, and other wrongs be-
righted. 
I 
can prate about the state, and any subject write 
on, 
And for a 
good dinner make a 
speech on any po-
tent question. 
[Recitation after the style of Hamlet's Soliloquy.] 
Oh herring, herring, herring red, 
Good with cra3kers, or good with bread. 
How oft on you the Poet fed, 
The Black Star Songster. 
45 
Were it not for you I 
should be dead; 
I 
eat you all but bones and head, 
And those I 
throw to the dog's bed. 
Some like you raw, and some admire 
You done in front of a 
blazing fire; 
A 
little vinegar doth embellish, 
And sends you down with a 
sort of relish. 
Bat least of all none can deny, 
You make a 
poor man very dry, 
And now that liquor's got so dear, 
Ten cents a 
glass, and at that, queer. 
You that once was my delight, 
Avaunt! I 
cannot bear your sight. 
Alas ! poor herring,— 
Now, all agree, Sco.

As sung by Henley's Minstrels.

Many happy darkies dere you see, 
Cotton comin' in so very heavy, 
Oh, golly, there's lots of work for me.

CHORUS. 
To my oakum, to my chokum, 
Oh, Pompey, can't you pick a

Ah, ah, golly, aint the levee niggers free, 
Working on the cotton boat, ten shillings a

As Sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
From the county of Monaghan lately I

My cousin, Tim Murphy, I 
met yesterday, 
Says he " Mr. Dooley ' 11 you go to the play 'I' 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
" 
Is it the play that you mean, are you sure that 
you're right? 
They're treating the town with Pizzaro, to-night." 
But the treat, as he called it, and one that I 
mean, 
Bad luck to his treat, it cost me all my tin. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Well, the green curtain drew up, and a 
lady I 
spied, 
When a 
man came to kiss her she scornfully cried, 
" 
Get out you big blackguard ; 
I'll bother your jig," 
When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a 
pig.

In the days of ould Goury- a 
long time ago, 
The Spaniard's claimed war 'gainst Peru you know; 
They demanded its cash, its jewels and keys, 
When a 
boy they called Howler, says, " No if you 
please." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came on, like a 
day-star appeared, 
lie made a 
long speach, and the sogers all cheer'd, 
Says he, " Beat well the Spaniards, and do the 
neat thing, 
And then boys stand up for your country and King." 
Derry down, down, down, deriy down. 
Then Mr. Murphy, Alonzo somehow went to Jail, 
He got out by a 
back door without giving bail, 
While Howler was jumping o'er bridges, and greens, 
He was shot by some blackguard behind the big 
screens. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came forward, and with him a 
child, 
Looking all for the yvorld like a 
man that was wild; 
" 
Here's your gossoon, dear Cora, for it's my blood 
that's spilt, 
In defence of your child, blood-an-ounds I'm kilt." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo, and Pizzarro, had a 
terrible fight, 
Pizzarro got killed, that seemed perfectly right. 
For the audiance came down with showers of ap-
plause, 
They were all enlisted in the Peruvian's cause. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down.

Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed,

By your kind permission, tomorrow then, 
We will murder Pizzarro over again."

Long Island Fair. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
It's myself was a 
soljer came home on a 
furlough, 
To see my dear children, and Biddy again; 
I'm bound for a 
bit of a 
spree for a 
week or so, 
NVhile in the bosom of home I 
remain. 
And. of all the big ructions that ever I 
heard of, 
Of all the excitements to make a 
man stare, 
The biggest old shindy I 
ever got word of, 
Is just over here at the Long Island Fair. 
The ladies' ( God bless 'em,) turned out in array, sir, 
To work for the sojers in goodness sublime; 
And at it they went in a 
practical way, sir, 
By giving their labor, money, and time. 
They talked of a 
raffle to help it along, sir, 
They went in for doing the thing on a 
square; 
But forty-n:ne Min:sters swore it was wrong, sir, 
And kicked up a 
row at the Long Island Fair. 
They bought baby jumpers, jimcracks and laces, 
Wid pictures, and cushions, and sewin' machines, 
And added the light of their beautiful faces, 
To flavor the puddin's, and bacon, and beans. 
They built a 
bridge to the New England kitchen, 
Och murthder the queer Yankee fixin's was there, 
To eat mush and milk, wid the colleens be witchin', 
Oh, wasn't it nice at the Long Island Fair. 
50 
The Black Star Songster. 
There was good things to eat in the hotel be Lowber, 
The price and the cooking no man could complain, 
But some of the Ministers couldn't keep sober, 
So they were forced to shut down on champagne, 
But it gave me real pain to think any preacher, 
Would drink all alone, and not give us a 
share, 
And to see a 
big parson like Henry Ward Beecher 
Go back on the boys at the Long Island Fair. 
Success to the Fair, and success tO the wimmen, 
Success to the cause they are all trying to aid; 
The eyes of the sojers, wid tears, will be swimmin' 
To hear of the efforts the ladies' have made. 
And when I 
go back to where General Mead is, 
I'll tell the brave boys that fight for you there, 
To drink to the health of the dear Brooklyn ladies 
With three rousin' cheers for the Long Island Fairs 
A Gay Conductor on a Coney Island Car. 
As sung by llooley's Minstrels. 
Now kind friends, your attention, 
sing a 
little 
song, 
Now don't you be impatient for it is'nt very long. 
'Tis all about a 
ladies' man, the handsomest by far, 
And ho was a 
gay conductor on a 
Coney Island Car. 
Now this young man was ' very vain, aud put on 
many airs, 
Always winkin' at the ladies' when collecting in 
his fares, 
Wid his bewitchin' moustacher andhis pooty curly 
hair, 
He was a 
gay conductor on a 
Coney Island Car. 
The Black Star Songster. 
51 
If by chance he saw a 
lady wid pouting lips so 
sweet, 
He'd stop de car and take her in and take her to a 
seat. 
Den he put his arm around her waist,and too polite 
by far, 
Is this gay young conductor on de Coney Island Car. 
Now dis young man was honest, for he neber knock'd 
a 
dime, 
But he libs upon de money what by chance he used 
to find. 
Now he sports a 
gold watch and chain, and. his 
friends, both near and far, 
Are applying for conductorship on de Coney Island 
Car. 
Pedigree of Yankee Doodle. 
Written by FRANK HOWARD. 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
'Tis of a 
chap I'm going to sing, whose name 
throughout the world does ring. 
A 
terror to .all tyrants, and a 
friend to liberty; 
For swapping jacknives he is great, and for manag-
ing aflairs of state, 
And he can fight through thick and thin wherever 
that he be. 
Twas at a 
place away down East, I 
think they call 
it Bunker Hill, 
Although he was an infant then, his courage did 
prove true; 
For there he made the tyrant take a 
very large and 
bitter pill, 
And after that they christened him Yankee Doodle 
Doo. 
52 
The Black Star Songster. 
As he grew old he grew more bold, and to the world 
at large he told, 
That he was independent of their sympathy or spite, 
And that in future he would be a 
champion of lib-
erty, 
And honor to his nation, and defender of the right. 
They then said he was getting proud, and that he 
talked too very loud, 
And just for greens, at New Orleans, they vowed 
they'd put him through. 
But I 
think ' twits eighteen- hundred- twelve that 
Packingham there met a 
man, 
Full grown at that, called Yankee Doodle Doo. 
As time flew by, they then did try to injure him 
upon the sly ; 
By fitting out bold pirate ships to rob upon the 
sea ; 
And then when we did capture one, they did not 
seem to like the fun; 
And roll'd their eyes in great surprise, and said it 
should'ut be. 
And when brave Captain Winslow whipped the Al-
abama on the square, 
his prisoners jumped overboard, for very well they 
tie w, 
That " neutral" hands had been engaged, and 
were already waiting there, 
To steal the rights and priviliges of Yankee Doodle 
Doo. 
Now I 
think some the time will come when they 
will learn to let alone, 
A man that is their master and superior in all, 
And not because his hands are full, keep giving his 
coat tails a 
pull, 
And show a 
disposition for to glory in his fall. 
1 
The Black Star Songster. 
53 
But the time will come when quite a 
sum of insults 
must be figured up, 
Some of them of long standing, and therefore over 
due. 
And if they are not paid, I 
am afraid that they'll 
be made to understand, 
The meaning of " neutrality" by Yankee Doodle 
Doo.

When my young heart was innocent and free; 
And yet bright to iny soul, 
As ' twas then to my eyes,

Oh it seemed to partake of my childhood's happy

On a 
grassy little mound ; 
Where sweet roses so fragrant entwine, 
Lies my Mother so dear, 
Who a 
home with God has found, 
And now worships with the angels at his shrine. 
Oh it seemed to partake, & c.

After the Battle. 
(Words and Music by FRANK HOWARD.— 
PlIbliS11 ed by Per-
mission of 11. M. Higgin,;, owner of the copyright,) 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
After the battle's over and the reign of strife hath 
ceased, 
When friends and foes together lie around in 
death's embrace, 
calling to a 
fallen brother, " water ! water ! quick !" 
he cries ; 
And that well-known word, " Mother," speaks he 
faintly e'er he dies ; 
Peace to thy soul, young soldier, she will meet thee 
in the skies. 
Off in the thatch'd roof cottage, reading by the 
open door, 
Sat one with care- worn visage, scanning well the 
papers o'er ; 
'Mong the list of 
and wounded, then she 
read the name of him, 
Who has in old age guarded her, and from those 
lips so thin, 
One fervent soft prayer sounded for his soul a 
fond 
requiem. 
Died on the field of battle, far from home and cher-
ished friends, 
There where death's missiles rattle, died, his coun-
try to defend ; 
Let us ne'er forget the soldier, brothers ! heroes! 
every one— 
And while those brave bodies moulder, buried on 
some plain alone, 
Put to the wheel our shoulder, and drive treason 
from our land. 
Our Hearts are with Our Country. 
[Words and Music by FRANK HOWARD .--- Publish-d by Per -

As Sung by Hooley'.s Minstrels. 
Our hearts are with our country, 
We ever true will be, 
Tho' perils dark surround us, 
We'll tight by land or sea: 
For the flag our fathers gave us, 
The stars and stripes alone, 
Our motto be America, 
Our free and happy home. 
On, on, our cry, we'll conquer or die, 
We'll fight to the death each one, 
Our motto be America, 
Our free and happy home. 
Up,up. show our devotion, 
Strike terror to the souls, 
Traitors base and loathsome, 
Who have their honors sold. 
To compromise with treason, 
We'll use good tempered steel, 
With hearts of oak each giant stroke, 
The traitors they shall feel. 
56 
The Black Star Songster. 
At Lexington, brave Mulligan, 
True pariot there was he, 
With him to lead we'll fight and bleed. 
For our dear loved country. 
Tho' treason doth submerge thee, 
'What care we for the toil, 
Our duty lies before us, 
The traitors we will foil. 
Our lives are at thy service, 
Our trust in him on high, 
America, well strike for thee, 
We'll conquer or we'll die. 
Each bomb's report and cannon's smoke, 
We'll make some new dream of thee, 
America and Liberty, 
Our war- cry shall be.

Sweet little Jennie is as fair, 
As snow-flakes on the heather, 
Her ruby lips are like a 
pair 
Of rosebuds joined together. 
Her laughing eyes do sparkle bright, 
As sunbeams on the river, 
Whose glances soft are arrows brigh 
From Cupids fairy quiver. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet little Jennie's gay and fair, 
May greenest bays o'er crown her, 
And loving friends and hearts sincere, 
With sweetest joys surround her, 
With rweetest joys surround her.

57 
Her happy smiles are like the light, 
Of golden sunbeams mingling, 
Her silvery tones are gay and bright, 
Like merry sleigh-bells jingling. 
Oh bow my heart with joy is thrilled, 
When'er perchance I 
meet her, 
Her breath excells the rose distilled, 
Her loving smiles are sweeter. 
Sweet little Jennie, & c. 
And though ' mid other scenes I 
rove, 
And other friends are near me, 
And though in foreign climes I 
rove, 
Sweet thoughts of thee do cheer me. 
Oh may the time fly swift away, 
Till there again I 
meet her, 
For that will be a 
happy day, 
When joyfully I 
greet her.

mission of II. M. Mout:cis, owner of the copyright.) 
As sung by Hooley's Mnstrels. 
Oft times at twilight comes a 
shadow, 
My heart with sweet mem'ry's it doth fill ; 
Fond recollections it doth point to, 
'Tis that clear woodbine cottage standing on the 
Over this wide world I 
have wander'd ; 
And sights ever beautiful I've seen; 
But when in quiet hours I'd ponder, 
Back comes the cottage, with the trees and fields 
so green. 
There dwelt those loved ones so near and so dear, 
And there on it's porch, night- fall's approach, 
Dear Grandpa with stories would cheer, 
There oft' I've played beside the rill. 
58 
The Black Star Songster. 
There with my dear cherished Mother l'd roam, 
Such pure joy to me, my heart light and free, 
A heaven of bliss was that home, 
Now where those tall poplars wave. 
Oh tell me does that cottage still stand on the hill, 
The cottage that stood on the hill, 
No sight my heart with joy could thrill, 
Like the dear woodbine cottage standing on the 
hill. 
Lies that dear Mother, with the green turf o'er her 
grave, 
That cottage that stood on the hill, 
Oh how my heart with joy would fill, 
Could I 
but see that dear old cottage on the hill. 
Sweep's Refrain. 
[With Tyroleon warblings by T. 13. PRENDERGAST.) 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Before the day breaks, with my brush and scraper, 
To sweep up the chimney's along I 
now totes, 
With my blanket around me along do I 
caper, 
My voice may be heard with the mocking-birds' 
notes. 
CHORUS. 
Sweep 0, Sweep 0, 
Oh rock Susannah, Santa Anna, aunt Hannah, 
Mary Tanna, Biscianna., with old Jemimianna, 
Come down and open the door. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
With tambourine pounding, banjo loud sounding, 
When days -work is over, we darkies hab fun; 
As through the streets we are singing, 
We're ever happy blithe and gay, 
To old Massa money bringing, 
A 
little keep ourselves to pay. 
Sweep 0, &c. 
With cap o'er my eyes, I 
was upwards ascending, 
And loudly 1 
sing when I 
get to the top, 
I 
was thinking of Rosa, and over was bending, 
And I 
fell down the chimney, covered with soot. 
Sweep 0, Sweep 0, 
Oh rock Susannah, Santa Anna, all other /limas, 
Come down, and don't keep a 
poor darkie in the 
cold, 
And open the door, oh, oh, oh. 
Who Says de Darkies Wont Fight. 
(Words and Music by FRAN% HOWARD.— Published by Per-
mission of H. N. lIempstehd, owner of the copyright.) 
As sung by Flooley's Minstrels. 
Some white folks have been heard to say, 
De niggers would not fight, 
But I 
guess•dat dey look it now, 
Quite in another light. 
Hush up your mouth you " Copperheads," 
Dot take dat for a 
plea ' 
• 
To keep us from de battlefield, 
Where all ob you should be. 
CHORUS. 
Our course is right, and we will fight, 
For dear old Uncle Sam, 
And show' de traitors North and South, 
Though black we're each a 
man. 
At " Miliken's7 Bend, Port Hudson too, 
We made our Massa scoot, 
And I 
guess dey form'd de " elusion" dere, 
Dat we knew how to shoot. 
I 
tink dal in a 
little while, 
We'll drive it in dere head, 
Dat Uncle Sam will arm all " tings," 
Dat can shoot down a 
Reb. 
Our course is right, 8ic.

The Black Star Songster. 
Old Massa's " Kurnel" say to us, 
(Which make us feel quite proud,) 
Dat de darkies make as good a 
mark, 
As any in de crowd. 
And as we're used to waiting, 
On our Massas heretofore ; 
We'll serve 'em up a 
little dish, 
Dat they're not bargain'd for. 
Our course is right, &c. 
Dey talk about your arming slaves, 
And make a dieffull" fuss ' 
But don't dey repudiate their debts, 
Which am a 
great deal wuss. 
And when de nigger you compare 
Wid traitors aint it true, • 
Dat dere deeds if not dere color, 
Am de whitest ob de two. 
Our course is right, & c. 
Florence 0' Neil. 
(Words and Music by FRANK HowAsn, Published by Per-
mission of II. M...111aums, owner of the copyright.) 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
Oh we met, and we parted, we though not forever, 
There vows long since plighted, a 
fond kiss did 
seal, 
As we stood on the banks of that beautiful river, 
I 
swore that I'd always love Florence O'Neil. 
The bright sunbeams danc'd on the soft rippling wa-
ter, 
The bell in the little white church did peal, 
She there for the last time, the" Good by" did falter, 
And fast flow'd the tears of my Florence O'Neil. 
" 
Oh, you go to that land far away, now to leave me, 
That land famed for beauty and freedom to all, 
The Black Star Songster. 
61 
And I 
hope that your absence tho' long may endear 
thee, 
To scenes left behind you in Erin-go-bragh." 
'Twas thus spoke my Florence, to me at our parting, 
She knew not the anguish my poor heart did feel, 
I 
bid her be patient for I 
was but starting, 
To seek out a 
home for my Florence O'Neil. 
Oh, I 
soon left the land of my birth far behind me, 
With thoughts of the future, I 
crossed the blue 
deep, 
How in time my sweet Florence should cross o'er and 
find me. 
As true to vows as when last we did meet. 
The shores of Columbia rose in their beauty, 
My heart throbb'd with gladness when I 
thought 
of the time, 
When I, in that land, own'd a 
cot neat and pretty, 
And Florence, dear Florence, all, all should be 
mine. 
But alas, for my fond hopes, how soon were they 
blighted, 
Such sad news from Ireland, I 
one day did hear, 
Those bright dreams that in dark hours my foot-
steps had lighted, 
My Florence was dead, her I 
lov'd so sincere. 
A 
letter then came from her dear aged Mother, 
That story was told by the little black seal, 
Oh, ne'er in this wide world, can I 
love another, 
As fondly, and true, as my Florence O'Neil. 
Captain of the Provost. 
As sung by Ilooley's Minstrels. 
As I 
walked through the streets in a 
summer's day, 
A 
re ,,iment of conscripts passed me on the way. 
They enrolled all our names, I 
fear I'll have to go, 
62 
The Black Star Songster. 
And shoulder a 
big musket and fight the rebel foe. 
I 
don't like the fare, the salt horse they eat there, 
The titans don't agree, they never did with me, 
Oh, it makes me tremble and shake about the knees, 
When the Captain of the Provost takes a 
sly 
glance at me. 
Skedaddlers from the draft are trying every plan, 
No one now ' bove thirty-five but is a 
married man 
The young men, too, are taken very ill, 
Nothing can effect a 
cure but an exeinp 
The country now is thick, with the blind, lame, 
and sick, 
No one stirs about without a 
crutch or stick. 
I 
haven't got three hundred, what will become of 
me 
When the captain of the Provost takes a 
sly 
glance at me. 
Abe is full of jokes, he takes both white and black, 
Packs them off to Dixie to keep the rebels back; 
in battling for ourUnion, I 
think it is but right, 
That the rich and poor, high and low, smell pow-
der in a 
fight. 
Around the biz hotels, lounges many a 
gay swell, 
Winks at the ladies and can punish juleps well; 
If they'd only put them thro' how tickled I'd be, 
When the Captain of the Provost takes a sly 
glance at me. 
To escape the draft, I 
have hit upon a 
plan, 
Show yourself a 
patriot and every inch a 
man. 
Go rally round the flag, and swear to be true, 
To the glorious Stars and Strips that have long 
shielded you. 
The shade of Washington let us all invoke, 
To nerve every arm thro' battle din and smoke. 
When this cruel war is over how tickled I'll be, 
If the Captain of the Provost will come and take 
a 
drink with me. 
Ill 
will dis Cruel War be Ober.

Oh give me back those good old times, 
When I 
was but a 
child, 
Ere sorrows blea, marked those lines, 
On Mother's face so mild. 
Bring back those dear old times to me, 
When free from thought of care, 
I 
knelt beside my Mother's knee, 
And brea thed the evening prayer. 
When in the mind rose numberless, 
Those castles built in air, 
Before this world's cold heartlessness, 
To me was e'en laid bare, 
When heart to heart with truth would cling, 
tid knew nought but of joy, 
Oh! back to me those old times bring, 
When I 
was but a 
boy. 
Fond recollections oh how dear, 
That boon of solitude, 
Oft back they bring those days quite near, 
When Mary first I 
woo'd. 
"I' was ineath the little lattice porch, 
Our tales of love we told, 
And dream'd not of life's cares approach, 
Ne'er thought of growing old, 
Ah! even give to me once more,

Days passed not long ago, 
Ere war our cherished land had stained, 
With blood of friends of yore. 
Yes give me back those treasured gems, 
Just for a

Oh! give me back my boyhood's friends 
Make me again a 
child. 
Twilight Musings. 
Words and Music by FRANK IIOWARD,----PtIbliShed by Per-
mission of If. M. 1
--1 IGGINS owner of the copyright.) 
As sung by rfooley's Minstrels. 
When the shades of evening cast their shadows, 
Around my rustic cot, 
Oft I'd sit and gaze far o'er the meadows, 
Where blooms the blue " forget-me-not." 
And like the name those sweet flowers heareth, 
In my soul a 
sweet and silent voice, thus speaks 
to me, 
Oh, say, do you e're forget dear Edith, 
When we wandered in childish glee, 
hand in hand, ' mid scenes so dearly cherished, 
Now in twilight musings, those bright scenes re-
turn to me. 
'Tis a 
quiet voice that sweetly whispers, 
Bringing hack those childish days, 
When with Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters, 
Life seemed as bright as summer rays, 
Each form and face so true and endearing, 
In bright visions all appear and then soon pass 
away, 
Oh, to me such thoughts are ever cheering, 
Life appears a 
summer day; 
And My only sorrow lies in fearing, 
That those twilight musings, from my heart may 
pass away. 
66 
The Black Star Songster. 
As I 
often sit at twilight, musing, 
Sweet mern'ries of the past 
Thro: my mind so vividly come flitting, 
And shadows bright around me cast. 
Young days have past, and old age comes creeping, 
Still in twilight musings, speaks that same sweet 
voice to me, 
Of the friends beneath the green turf sleeping. 
And I 
wonder thoughtfully 
If in years to come when I 
sleep silently, 
During twilight musings will one kind friend 
think of me.

Happy Hours. 
(Words and Music by FRANK Howes]) --Published by Per-

As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
Happy hours, happy hours; oh, to mem'ry how 
dear, 
Happy hours we in childhood passed away; 
Fond hours in childhood we passed away, 
Fond thoughts of loved haunts ever speaks and 
says; 
There we in youth passed the happy hours away. 
In happiness rich, as we played ; ear the mill, 
And the sport in joy our young hears did fill. 
And there in youth passed the hours away, 
Away, the happy hours, away, 
happy, happy, hours away, hourts away, 
Happy, happy hours away.

The Black Star Songster. 
Happy hours, happy hours, how I 
long to recall, 
Scenes familiar and ever dear to me, 
Where in inocent childhood we have played, and so 
oft' have we strayed, 
Hand in hand by the sea. 
The dear old cot by the burial lot, 
Hush, mention it not, ' tis a 
sacred spot, 
They're there laid to rest, 
Friends of hours that have passed away, of hours 
thht have passed away, 
Happy, happy hours, that passed away.

Cum Flung Gum. 
As Sung by Hoeley's Minstrels. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
turtle dove, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
sparrow, 
I'd fly away with my own true love, 
And stay all day to- morrow. 
CHORUS. 
Cum plung gum here, cum plung gum there, 
Cum plung gum over yondor, 
Oh Lord ! ladies, can't you dance cum blung gum. 
I 
like de mowing grass, 
Before the farmer mows it, 
I 
like to see the trotting horse, 
For when he goes he goes it. 
Cum plung gum, &c. 
I 
like to see the table waited 
By some civil waiters, 
I 
like to see 'em fetch along 
The biggest kind of taters. 
Cum plung gum, &c. 
Old Massa had a 
jug of rum, 
And sugar by the pound, 
And a 
great big bowl to mix it in, 
And a 
spoon for to stir it round. 
Cum plung gum, &c. 
St. Seven and King O'Tooi. 
As sung by Hooley's Minstrels. 
St. Keven was a 
travelling through a 
place called 
Glendalough, 
He chanced to meet with King O'Tool, and he axed 
him for a 
sleugh. 
Says the King, " you're but a 
stranger for your 
face I 
have never seen, 
But if you have a 
taste of weed, I'll lend you my 
dhudeen." 
CHORUS. 
Fol de diddle di do. 
While the saint was kindling up ,the) 
pipe the Mon-
arch gave a 
sigh, 
"Is there anything the matter," says the saint, 
" 
that makes you cry 1" 
Says the King, " I 
had a 
gander that was gave me 
by my Mother, 
And this morning he has cracked his toes with 
some disease. 
or other." 
Fol de diddle di do. 
" 
Are you crying for your gander, youu nfortunate 
old goose, 
Dry up your tears, in fretting, sure, the devil take 
the use." 
Says the saint, " what would you give me if the 
gander I'd revive'!" 
Says the King, " I'd be your sarvent all the days 
that I'm alive." 
Fol de diddle di do. 
70. The Black Star Songster. 
" 
I'll cure him," says the saint, " but I 
want no sar-
vent man, 
But if I'd not make too bold to ax, I'd like a. bit of 
land, 
As you think so much about the bird, if I make 
him whole and sound, 
Will you give.. me the taste of land the gander 
dues fly round 1" 
Fol de diddle di do. 
" 
In troth Iwill an welcome," says the King, " give 
what you ask." 
Says the saint, " then bring the gander and I'll 
begin the task." 
The King went to the palace for to fetch him out 
the bird. 
Tho' he'd not the least intention of sticking to his 
word. 
Fol de diddle di do. 
St.'Keven took the gknder from the arms of the old 
King, 
He first began to twig his beak and then to stretch 
his wing, 
lie hocished him up into the air, he flew twenty 
miles around, 
SayS the saint, " I'd thank your Majisty for that, 
little bit of ground." 
Fol de diddle di do. 
The King to raise a 
ruction, faith, he called the 
saint a 
witch, 
And sent in for his six big sons to heave him in the 
ditch. 
" 
Nabocklis," says St. Keven, " now I'll settle those 
young urchins, 
He turned the King and his six sons into the seven 
churches. 
Fol de diddle di do. 
The Black Star Songster. 
71 
Thus King 0"rool was punished for his dishonest 
doings, 
The saint then left the gander to guard about the 
ruins. 
If you'd go there on a 
summer's day, between twelve 
and one o'clock, 
You'll sop the gander flying round the glen of 
Glendalough. 
Fol de diddle di do. 
Now I 
think there is a 
moral attached unto my 
song, 
" 
To punish men is only right whenever they do 
wrong. 
For poor men they may keep their word ranch bet-
ter than folks grander, 
For the King begrudged to pay the saint for cur-
ing his old gander. 
Fol de diddle di do.
