On a 
cold winter's ev'ning, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pie:Ai:re it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring; 
Then you place him on the carpet, 
And you'll hide behind the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing; 
CHORUS: 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
Come from behind the chair 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo ! 
I 
see you hiding there; 
Oh! you rascal. 
There. 
Oh, ray heart's always light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign ; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never knew care or pain; 
He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'ry thing nice, him I 
bring; 
Oh, if he attempts to cry 
When I 
am standing by, 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing; 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! &e. 
When the sunshine of youth fades, and age bends us low,— 
Joys, like the birds, flown away; 
Then the smiles of our children ever brighten the path, 
Leading where loved ones do stray. 
The music and laughter we ever love to hear, 
Will beam like a 
rain-bow in spring; 
By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing: 
reek-a-boo! ptek-kboo

Pm always light-hearted and aisy, 
Not a 
care in the world have I, 
Because I 
am loved by a 
Colleen, 
I 
could'nt forget if I 
try. 
She lives far away o'er the mountain, 
Where I 
know she's still thinking of me, 
Arrah i 
Cushla MeChree were I 
with you, 
This moment how happy I'd be. 
CHORUS: 
It's over; yes, over the mountain, 
Where the little thrush sings on the tree; 
In a 
cabin all covered with ivy, 
There my Eily is waiting for me. 
The day I 
bid good-bye to Eily, 
That day I 
will ne'er forget, 
How the tears bubbled up from their slumber, 
I 
fancy I 
see them yet. 
They looked like the pearls in the ocean, 
As she wept the tears of love, 
Says she,—Teddy, my boy, don't forget me, 
Till we meet again here or above. 
Oh! water and land may divide us, 
Friends, like flowers, come and go; 
The face of my Eily will cheer me, 
For in that dear face I 
well know, 
The imprint of love and devotion, 
Surrounded by thoughts chaste and pure, 
Will serve as the star to the sailor, 
Whilst plodding the wild raging moor.

I'm a 
poor Irish minstrel, I'm not blest with wealth, 
But I've a 
fond heart, clear conscience and health, 
I 
care not for storms, misfortune I 
brave, 
The hand of the welcome is all that I 
crave. 
A 
kiss from the loving, a 
word from the true, 
A 
look, or a 
smile my darling from you, 
Would cheer the poor minstrel where'er he might roam, 
With the image °flail to his wandering home. 
CHORUS: 
the 
5 
I'm a 
poor Irish minstrel and happily would play, 
. Music, sweet music by night or by day, 
I 
would sing thee sweet songs of my home far away, 
Oh! Angel of Love, come list to my lay! 
I'm proud of my country, that dear Isle so green, 
The fairest of lassies and lads may be seen, 
Where such men as Emmet, O'Connell and Moore, 
have lived, sang and cherished that bright sunny shore! 
The shamrock of Ireland and the lilly of France, 
We love with a 
fondness that nothing but chance, 
Will pluck from our bosom's kept warm and true, 
With a 
spirit as gard'ner and a 
hearts dripping dew.

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Sweet music you will bear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms the ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such melody. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing, it's entrancing, 
I 
love babies, I 
love ladies, 
They're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
" 
The meeting of the waters," 
Or the " Emigrant's farewell," 
There's Bobby B111118. the Scottish bard, 
Whose memory shall reign, 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honor'd was his name. 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
r 
His praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis William Cullen Bryant, 
Whom Americans adore, 
His works are read throughout the world, 
From this to foreign shore.

The moon was shining on the lake, 
The stars shone from above; 
Gazing on the water, 
My heart was filled with love; 
There I 
met my darling, 
Whose eyes with joy did beam; 
As gently I 
spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream. 
CHOU'S: 
Moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh, what bliss a 
loving kiss, 
From hearts that beat with love; 
Oh! moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh! what bliss a 
loving kiss, 
From hearts that beat with love. 
'Tis by the margin of the lake, 
Battles have been won; 
Not by spear or sword, 
But blarney of the tongue; 
She I 
know believed me, 
As stars shone from above; 
She gently smiled upon me, 
While whisp'ring words of love.

Only To See Thee, Darling'. 
As sung by Wm. J. ScAlmott. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Vainly I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart, 
Longing once more to see thee, 
Once more before we part. 
CHORUS. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
none is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy so bright, 
Now every gleam bath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas! I 
knew thee, 
Ah I 
could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
that sad wor0, farewell.

I'll tell you of a 
party, at Mrs. Reilly's hall, 
Attended by the quality, who one and all did call, 
They came from far and near, to sing, dance and play, 
To hear them shout with laughter, would make your heart feel 
gay. 
I'll now describe their actions, if attention you will pay, 
Show you how they sang and danced, from night till the break 
of day, 
I'll try and ape their movements, in their peculiar style, 
Especially the dancing of Lynch and Biddy Doyle. 
At last the party ended, and some commenced to go, 
They looked for Quinn, the fiddler, in corners high and low, 
At last they found him sleeping, his head between the door, 
And when they woke him up, at Cregan he did roar: 
Oh ! Come and pay the fiddler, that play'd for ye all night, 
Show me Lynch the wrestler, with him I 
want to fight, 
He winked at Biddy Grady, while I 
for him did play, 
lie's no man if he leaves me, he stole my love away. 
There was Mrs. Regan, Mrs. Crean, Mrs. Kane and Doyle, 
Mrs. Leary, Mrs. Cleary, Mrs. Walsh and Boyle, 
Mrs. Dooly, Mrs. Hooly, Kelly and O'Brien; 
And big Tom Quinn the fiddler, a 
playing all the time. 
O'Hoolahan, McCormick, Lane and Larry Duff; 
Cronin, Riley, Lynch and Mickey Cuff, 
Dooley, Hooley, Kelly and O'Brien, 
And by— 
Wasn't it a 
pleasure, a 
pleasure to see them dance, 
A jig and Irish reel, 
I 
thought I'd die with laughter, with laughter • 
To see O'Rourke, the piper, dance with Biddy O'Neil.

In the summer time when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green, 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene. 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might, 
They have a 
big accordeon, the music it is grand. 
You'll hear them shout for miles away, 
Faith they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy " on his instruments will play. 
CrioRos. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all night, ' tis finer 
than the op'ra. bouffe; 
If you don't believe I'm right, call around there any night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof! 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They said it was too soon. 
They keep the folks awake at night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, it really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the opera, when they do the Boston dip, 
Faith the house rocks like a 
ship; 
Oh I 
there's no place like McDonnell's old tin roof, 
Across the street from where I 
live, a

He's a

He keeps about five men at work of course they're up all night 
But when they hear the music play they shout with delight, 
About the time tne bread is hak'd the boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door Glen 
skip across the street, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
Oh I

Wm. 
J. A. Lieder, No. 60 Chatham Street. New York, will send the 
sheet music of this or any song in this book on receipt of 
40 cents, either in cash or postage stamps. 
Why do I ? 
well I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
copper on the Broadway squad, 
And a 
brave one, too, am I. 
If there's a 
murder or a 
fight, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Oh! isn't he a 
dear, 
CHORUB. 
I'm a 
darling, ain't I 
charming, 
And the ladies all say as I 
pass them4by, 
Ain't he purty, ain't he lovely ! 
Dan McCormick the copper am I. 
I 
visit all the collar shops, 
About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. 
I 
tell her the acknowledgements, 
From the public I 
receive, 
And also how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'll have to lave. 
Chorus, 
My antecedents were high-toned, 
Respected every where; 
My father could whip an elephant, 
My mother whip a 
bear, 
My sister toss a 
camel, 
And my brother fight a 
fly, 
Stand a 
rhinoceros on his head, 
And. sing the " Swale bye and bye."

I've got a

Ah, but if I

That taugut her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha ! 
(Repeat.? 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to danca 
I'll twist off the both of his legs.

Music published by F. W. Hymareic, 
No. 50 Fourth Street, Cincinnatti, Ohio. 
The subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you prove:;1:1tru, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
S
POKEN.—I 
explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing—

There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter hew many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last viegg, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said wkat do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was—

DRAW IT MILD.

— Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Let's learn to temper our wishes, 
For there's many a 
thing we desire, 
Which on the morrow is worthless, 
And makes nature a 
vivid satire. 
Young men whose fathers are wealthy, 
In dissipation their hours do beguile; 
Get all you can from the old man, 
But remember draw it mild. 
VTIORITS. 
For those who wish to be much in life, 
My advice, to ma.u, woman or child, 
Is, go it strong while you are young, 
But remember, draw it mild. 
To the blushing maid of sweet sixteen, 
At whom Cupid flings his dart, 
Love at first sight's not always right, 
And leads to an aching lmart. 
To all who believe in passion divine, 
And on whom the fates have smiled; 
Love's filter use, but don't abuse, 
And remember, draw it mild. 
To all who would an evil shun, 
Be he defaulter or politician; 
Honor or duty can't be bought, 
o 
give up sordid ambition. 
Or else like evil doers, 
Upon whom riches are piled; 
I 
day of recovery soon will come, 
Unless you draw it mild.

Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been,

I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

Oh, I

To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green,

Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me. 
I

Pilo' many, many times I

RIVAL JUNK MEN. 
Originally performed by SCANLAN Sr, CRONIN, the most perfeet 
Representatives of Irish Character now on the 
American Stage. 
Have ye's any mild rags or ould bottles, my friends, 
That ye's want to sell ? 
I'm " Paddy Welsh," of the Fourth Ward, 
And of me ye've all heard tell. 
I'm known by every chick and child 
As a 
man of great exploit., 
And to be mayor or alderman, 
If I 
said the word I 
moight. 
I'm twenty long years in this land, 
For Politician s I 
have no use. 
I 
neither ax nor borrow their aid, 
And as for me they can go to the deuce. 
As up the street I 
go each day, 
They know who's coming, well. 
With my bag on my back, I 
shout, 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell. 
ENTER RIVAL. 
(dance.) 
Good evening to ye's, one and all. 
I 
see ye'rc looking well. 
I 
suppose ye all will be surprised 
At what I'm going to tell. 
I've been travelling about the Ward all day, 
Not a 
pound of rags can I 
buy, 
Because that blackguard, " Paddy Welsh." 
Has been there on the sly. 
But I'll take my oath that I'm a 
bloat. 
If I 
don't make him sick. 
The first time I 
clap my eyes on him 
I'll paralyze him with a 
brick; 
it 
- 
I'll twist his nose till the blood it flows, 
And me he'll remember, well. 
To come no more in the Sixth Ward, hollering 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell 
BOTH. 
Now what's the use of all this fuss? 
Our reputation I'm sure we'd spoil 
To see uti quarreling here like dogs, 
Two sons of the Emerald Isle; 
So let us shake hands and be good friends, 
This rivalry let us stop, and to bind the bargain 
Let us go and of whisky take a 
drop. 
But there's one thing we must bear in mind, 
That our rules are sobriety. 
Sure if they found out we drank rum 
We'd be kicked out of the Society. 
So say no more but on we'll go, 
Or some one they might tell; 
And we'll go about our business, hollering. '

It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green gras.s. 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass, 
I

sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy WI 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brighteat

Why Did My Josie Go ?

I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My 
little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to- morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
(Charitti 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me.}  
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming,

sung by W. McALooli in all the principal Theatres in AnYerica, ant 
by CYNEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When dvwn in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
Cnonus: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant hag 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

Drunkard's Lone Child. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all dak. 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they litty. 
On the damp ground I 
must now lay my head, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
CHORUS: 
Mother, why did you leave inA alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no home., 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drirakard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and. mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard an_c.14nother is dead.

O'RALLERINI THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
A 
new a 
original song, written and sung by Whillit SCANLAN, 
in his new and original sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is O'Halleran, and fro•n Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro, 
The blackguards they see me, arrah. from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know warm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street, 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
Aid go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'Halleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman. 
For as I 
promenade, Jrc. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
ronndsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
tah,
:ht. be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't seen be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can, 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
As sung with great success by ToNT PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in Vew York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around tile old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze. 
(Chorus).

You can see that I'm no fighter. 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me,

There's no better in the land;

Always Speak A 
itin4- Word When 
You Can. 
Originally sung by Wirm Ir. MORTON, America's Comique, ai the Park 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings are all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'er my mind, 
I 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
Now if perchance you meet an old friend upon the street, 
lie is poor and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his poverty is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome Lim and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply mourn, 
He's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late, , 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can.

Farewell, dear home, farewell to all 
The comforts of this world. 
We're ould, we're herpless and forlorn. 
In the street from our home we are hurled. 
A. time was when joy ne'er left our home, 
Oh, 'twas then our poor hearts beat with glee, 
But now to the poor house we must go, 
The cause is poverty. 
CHORUS. 
May Heaven protect us day and night, 
Where ever we may be; 
So to the poor house we must go; 
The cause is poverty. 
I've looked for work, but all in vain— 
They say that I'm too ould, 
I've gone and begged from door to door 
To keep out the hunger and cold; 
But Mary, dear, when we are dead, 
And they ask what became of you and me, 
They can never say we robbed or stole, 
But died from poverty.

AM getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
Old Massa and old Misus they'ie sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest; 
Things are changed about the place, the darkies all am gene 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years ago, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banjo, 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh! the only friend that's left ma is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
BOY. 
Oh! daddy, don't you be so sad and melancholy now, 
For yen there's many happy days in store, 
Although you're old and feeble, your boy is young and strong,

can to make you happy now,

How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, tuning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest.

GIIMBERLANIY8_ 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh! shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
'When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fats, 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed, 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crew. 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side. like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
Th e shots struck her ic1s and glanced harmless o'er; 
CUMBERLAND'S CREW.— Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
, 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them. 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid- ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through: 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns ! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

I'm the one you can't help notice, 
Pm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
Pm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I 
can pull a 
boal with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
rho ladies admire my pretty shape 
- 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me lear, 
For my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians teem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor.

Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I

But I

To carry o'er my love and I.

DUNDREARY O'DONNELL, 
Written and sung by W ILTJAM SCANLAN, in SCANLAN It CRONIN'S 
origink Irish comedy farce, entitled " O'Dorunett's Victory." 
Dandreary O'Donnell is my name, 
I'm a 
man of great renown, 
It's just about twinty years ago, 
Since I 
landed in this town; 
An' since that time I 
a 
family raised, 
Which I'm very proud to tell, 
An' in this city iver since, 
Wid me frinds I've had to dwell. 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
An' all the people say, 
I'm the coming man of this great place— 
The rest have had their day. 
As I 
walked out this mornin', 
Sure all the people said— 
" 
There goes O'Donnell, the candidate, 
By him we're to be led; 
Arrah I 
he's the man that'll rule New York, 
An' won't he cut a 
shine— 
Whin he goes over to Washington, 
As a 
Senator so fine!" 
Dundreary O'Donnell, eta 
Now that the election is over, 
An' the glorious battle is won, 
My kindest thanks I 
offer to those, 
For the work they have done; 
And whin I 
take my sate, my frinds, 
The public thin I'll shcw— 
That Dundreary O'Donnell is the people's choice, 
Wherever he may go. 
Dundreary O'Donnell, etc.

The Little Old House on the Rhine. 
By ALEX MCCLAFFERTY. 
Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill," 
Sung by Gus WILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear. 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask 'neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, &c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh I 
I'd love to return to my oldfatherland, 
And that little old haus* on the Rhine.

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, No. 21

Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom-
mend it to our young lady- and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book. bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, whieh might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
