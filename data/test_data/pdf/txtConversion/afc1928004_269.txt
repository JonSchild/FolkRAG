A famous Hen Convention 
'Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
skow of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Ciiitagongs, 
And game- fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick'd race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Bays Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, kc. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show.

THE hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man, 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too (Treat, 
And now he's (tone away ! 
He was great, etc. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair;

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. — Continued. 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
his mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his bead down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was g-reatV'ete. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all, at all 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say; 
CHORES. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch- word be despatch and practice what you preach. 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when oftimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not; want not, (te. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, &v.. 
.7‹ .1 
Then I;stutlited strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funda4Rstead of staking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste no, want not, dz,e. 
I'm marriel now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have Ii tle children three, 
The letison that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, dr,c,

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes I 
my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below'? 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVID BRASAIL 
THREE years ago this very day 
We went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon. 
In true military style. 
Seventeen American dollars 
Each month we surely get 
For to carry a 
gun and baguette 
With a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going 
To the army or to jail ; 
Or it's up the Hudson river 
With a " copper" take a 
sail; 
Oh, we puckered up our courage, 
Wid bravery we did go; 
Oh, we cursed the day we went away 
Wid the Regular Army 0! 
CHORUS. 
There was Sergeant John McCaffery 
And Captain Donahue; 
Oh, they make us march and toe the mark, 
In gallant Company " Q." 
Oh, the drums would roll, upon my soul ; 
This is the style we'd go 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army 0! 
We wint to Arizony 
For to tight the Injins there ; 
We came near being made bald-headed, 
But they never got our hair ; 
We lay among the ditches, 
In the yellow dirty mud, 
And we never saw ax onion, 
A 
turnip, or a 
spud. 
THE REGULAR ARMY 0 I—Continued. 
Oh, we were taken prisoners, 
Conveyed fornist the chafe; 
Oh, he said we'll make an Irish stew, 
The dirty Indian thafe. 
On the telegraphic wire 
We walked to Mexico; 
We blessed the day we skipped away 
From the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've been dry as army herrings, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk; 
Oh, the boys along the street cry out, 
" 
Soger, would you work?" 
We'd ship into the navy 
For to plow the raging sea, 
But cold water sure we couldn't endure, 
*Twould never agree wid me. 
We'll join the politicians, 
Then we know we'll be well fed; 
Oh, we'll sleep no more upon the ground, 
But in a 
feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, 
They call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes 
For the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, 
And bunions on our toes; 
For luring a 
gun in the red hot sun 
Puts freckles on your nose. 
England has its Grenadiers, 
France has its Zoo-zoos, 
The U. S. A. never changes they say, 
But continually wear the blues. 
When we are out upon parade, 
We must have our muskets bright, 
Or they'll slap us in the guard-house 
To pass away the night; 
And whin we want a 
furlough, 
To the Colonel we do go; 
He says, go to bed, and wait till you're dead, 
In the Regular Army 0 
I 
There was, etc.

was leader in mischief at school, 
Though always so humble and meek; 
And when I 
discovered a 
chance of reward. 
I 
was always informer and sneak. 
By the evil example I 
set,. 
Other boys into mischief were led; 
But I 
always managed to pocket the spoil, 
And get other boys wolloped instead.—Cao. 
When a 
man I 
went into the world, 
I 
plundered the helpless and poor; 
Yet always got off with a 
snug little sum, 
When it came to a 
question of law. 
I 
started benevolent funds, 
And spouted at Exeter Hall, 
/ 
started loan offices, hospitals, clubs, 
And finally swindled them all.—Cno., 
In the City my name I 
keep up, 
And swindling comp'nies promote; 
Yet always creep out with the bulk of the funds, 
Before it's found out it won't float. 
I'm an alderman, and as M. P. 
To stand I've received an invite; 
And if I 
get in, why, my party I'll sell, 
And Gladstone will make me a

In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not 41Iy pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS . 
Oh, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so,' 
Yes, you are awful; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be 7 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention • 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention; 
" 
Come. love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no." she said. 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed ; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7 " 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
(1) 
AIN'T YOU AWFUL.—Continued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied rue, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
INly love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, et4. 
As sung by ED 
BURTON. 
IT'S sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be ; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And 
pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring 7 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more.

ARRAII MICKY, 
PUT YOUR FRIEZE 
ON. 
ARRAH ! 
Mickey, will ye leave us thus, 
To cross the raging main 7 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Should you ne'er come back again 7 
The hawthorn it may flower in spring, 
The daisy bright may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
If you, my darling, go. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah! Mickey, put your frieze coat on, 
Walk through the bog with me ; 
And you can whisper in my ear, 
How dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land, 
We've courted many a 
year— 
Then stop where sweet the shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear. 
Though peace and plenty waits you there, 
In that land beyant the sea! 
To break my heart is hardly fair, 
So stop with love and me. 
Arrah! Mickey, etc. 
My granny's got a 
cow and pig, 
An eight-day clock and all; 
With a 
picture of St. Patrick 
That hangs against the wall ; 
There's an arm- chair stands beyant the nook, 
Close by the bright turf fire, 
Where the " poteen " bottle lies concealed, 
What more can you desire ? 
Arrah! Mickey, etc. 
I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our cottage out ; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear, 
The welcome news to shout, 
That you will stay among us all, 
And the lark \NIll sweeter sing, 
And the bells from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring. 
Arrah ! Mickey, etc.

Oh I

PATRICK'S DAY PARADE. 
W ords by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVE BRAHA1L 
the Music of this song is published by W1t. A Po:in & Co., 547 Broad-
way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
SAINT PATRICK was a gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through -rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee na6on, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
BOSTON FIRE. 
As sung with success by Miss ANNIE RATELLE. 
Ain.—" Pat Won't Go Horne Till Morning." 
IT 
was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fire-king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophy so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city, was on fire, 
And sinking ' heath the fiend's relentless hand. 
CHORUS. 
Fire ! fire! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all this world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish prayed, 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed ; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
As the light around the horizon gleamed. , 
Fire! fire ! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king so tyrannic, 
But the brave hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land; 
Far brighter than the soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
CHORUS. 
And soon will no trace remain. 
Of this vast sea of flame; 
Boston will rise again remember ; 
Brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town 
Like Chicago, from the ground, 
Before the next November.

OLD BLACK JOE. 
Sung by BityLNT's Minstrels. 
GONE are the days when my heart was young and gay, 
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away, 
Gone from the earth to a 
better land, I 
know: 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling: " Old Black Joe." 
CHORUS. 
I'm coming, I'm coming, for my head is bending low, 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling : " Old Black Joe. 
Why do I 
weep when my heart should feel no pain ? 
Why do I 
sigh that my friends come not again ? 
Grieving for forms departed long aao— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling: " Old Black Joe." 
I'm coming, etc. 
Where are the children I 
held npon my knee? 
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free ? 
Gone to the shore where my soul has lonaeil to ao— 
I 
herr their gentle voices callina: " Old Black Joe."

TOM AND JERRY, 
T H11: TWINS. 
On here we are, a 
couple of gay colored darks, 
That are out on a 
sort of a 
spree, 
We ain't very particular about the cut of our rig, 
As you can undoubtedly see. 
But we'll hoop you up a 
dish 
Of the loveliest style of two makes with cream colored skins. 
For two gayer darkevs you never will find, 
Than Gay Tom and. Jerry, the twins. 
CHORUS. 
For so happy we feel, (
Symph) 
From head to heel, (Symph.) 
For two gayer darkeys you never will find, 
Than gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
But now we've resolved to settle in life, 
That's if two charmers we can find, 
Two darling little wives, that will just suit our taste, 
But they must be both loving and kind: 
So girls open your eves and go in for a 
chance, 
For it's talent, not beauty, that wins; 
And never say no, when you're once asked to dance 
With gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
For so happy, etc,

TE/E BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung by Nan HARRIGAN. 
list to the lay of a 
poor Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
it was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dweliing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-hragh, 
lity the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget Phelim Bra ly, the Bard of Armagh.

Oh, steer my bark to Erin's Isle,

THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA'S HILLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives 
Is when some heart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives.

JOHNNY ROACH'S VERSION OF THE SONG 
OF THE FLAGS . 
THERE'S a 
nation of good people who come from the River Rhine, 
who are famous for their industry— 
Good citizens in peace, brave soldiers make in war, ever ready 
in the cause of liberty ; 
Though bound by oppression's yoke, yet they love that father-
land, and ring its songs here in this land that's free ; 
May they ever dwell with us, and with us find a 
home in happi-
ness, in peace, and unity. 
CHORITS.—German Flag. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, that fair land of the vine, 
And may its sons for over sing their glorious Wacht am Rhein. 
There's another nation, no braver can be found, whose sons have 
won a 
name for chivalry, 
And well they do deserve it, as every nation knows, for they are 
found in every battle on land or sea; 
They have struggled hard themselves to throw off the tyrants' 
yoke, and I 
only pray the day we soon shall see 
When the green flag is unfurled, it's proclaimed throughout the 
world, old Ireland, dear Ireland, you are free. 
CHORITS.—Irish Flag. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, that bright gem of the sea, 
And may we live to see the day old Ireland will be free. 
There was a 
band of patriots who struzgled for their rights when 
the tyrant by taxation ground them down; 
But they showed that mother country they had rights she must 
respect, when her tea in Boston harbor they drowned; 
They have left a 
name behind them that time will ne'er erase, 
and a 
home where every exile can be free; 
May its flag for ever wave o'er the land of the true and brave, 
this God-like land of liberty. 
Here's the flag of America, the home of the brave and free, 
And may its folds forever wave o'er this land of liberty. 
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND TO MP. 
Sung by ED. BUDTON, the popular baritone. 
41Y bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when youth was in its 
prime; 
My days of darkness turned to light my sorrowed heart was 
free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend to 
me. 
CITORCS. 
I'll ne'er forget, where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be 
If ever I 
have bad a 
friend, 
You've been a 
friend to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been for you; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life : 
I 
now look back upon the past, along life's stormy sea, 
I 
smile to think ' mid all life's scenes, you've been a 
friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc.

Written and sung by ED. EIA3111IDAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line ?" 
I 
AM a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a

At any party or any raffle

As conspicuous as General Granite, boys,

rosebud upon my breast ;

Without regard to clique or clan; 
I

I 
control the Tombs, I 
control the Island, 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
kiarch away like a

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sea; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea. 
1 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, ecc. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, tt c. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
then I 
will get another wife and quickly 
be bound. 
Perhaps shess, Lte. 
DARLING BESSIE OF TTTP. LEA. 
By B.zslay TraKEE. 
On I 
I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime; 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
is the sunlit face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew- drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they 2.11 will pass unheeded, for wherever she may ly_‘, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
GRANDFATHER SAM. 
Young folks, come listen to my song, 
I'm old, I 
won't detain you long, 
Eighty-four you must know I 
am, 
The young folks call me grandfather Sam. 
My hair once black has all turned gray, 
But what of that while I 
feel gay, 
Olt I 
I 
could sing and dance with glee, 
If I 
was as young as I 
used to be.

How I 
love to sing for you, 
Oh I 
I 
could sing and dance with glee, 
If I 
was as young as I 
used to be. 
When I 
was young I 
knew life's joys, 
But many sorrows have come, my boys, 
My dear old wife the joy of my life, 
I 
lost some twenty years gone by. 
I 
could tell a 
story ' twould break your heart, 
But let all sorrow and grief depart. 
I'm a 
jolly old fellow as ever you see, 
And 1 
feel 'bout as young as I 
used to be. 
Tididi i 
idid, Am, 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
was with the girls the most of my time, 
I'd take them out each day for a 
ride, 
And always had one by my side. 
I'd hug and kiss them just for fun, 
And I've proposed to more than one, 
So if any girl here wants a 
kiss from me,

NEW VERSION OF SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
f-s 
sung by Jous-Ny ROACH. 
W HEN I 
landed in swate Castle Garden, 
I 
just come from off the big say; 
In me pocket I 
hadn't a 
farthen 
When I 
lepped out upon the Broadway. 
I 
stepped up to a 
lamplighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, but his hair 
Was cut like a 
prize fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my trunk and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
So hurrah for the stars and stripes, 
And the land , where we never see fogs; 
If I 
hadn't come here, 
I'd be digging turf in the bogs. 
, 
The road it was dirty and slippy, 
Till I 
came to a 
street they called Wall, 
, 
When the blagguards called out, " There goes croppy," 
, Till I 
came to the big City 
t 
I 
axed a 
Dutch peddler the way, 
And he answered me " Thunder and blitzen 1" 
Judge Connolly lepped out, be me sowl, 
And made me an American citizen. 
So hurrah, etc. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
He tould me his name it was Hobbes, 
He sold me a 
pass for Chicago; 
Be me sowl, it was the old jack of clubs. 
But I 
mustn't indulge in reflection, 
. For what I 
have said ain't worth note; 
I'll be running for sheriff next election. 
So step up, me heroes, and vote. 
So hurrah, etc. 
It's when I 
arrived in Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm; 
The commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm 
"No," sez I, " I'll go back to New York, 
For the politics there are so pretty; 
Send your Dutchman way out on the farm, 
But, be jabers, I'll stick to the city." 
So hurrah, ettc. 
Then come along, Jimmy; don't tarry, 
And bring along Jeri 
and Pat, 
Brien Connel and Mickey and Larry, 
Big Dennis and Darby and Mat; 
You'll get your citizen's papers 
As you step on the dock from the boat, 
And the big Tammany Ingin, be jabers, 
Will show ye the right way to vote. 
So hurrah, etc.

Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland.

THE ORPHAN BOY. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
My poor old mother and I 
did part when I 
was very young, 
Her memory still around my heart like the morning mist has 
clung; 
They tell me of my mother's form, she watched o'er me while I 
slept, 
And with her light and gentle hand she wiped the tears I 
wept. 
CHORUS. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purest joy, 
I 
wonder if she thinks of me, her little orphan boy. 
And that same hand that held my own when I 
began to walk, 
And the joy that sparkled in her eyes when I 
began to talk; 
I 
remember, too, when I 
was ill she'd kiss my burning brow, 
And the tears that fell upon my cheeks, I 
think I 
feel them now. 
CHORUS. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purest joy, 
I 
wonder if she thinks of me, her little orphan boy. 
And then she used to kneel with me and teach me how to pray, 
She'd lay her hands upon her breast to teach me the way. 
Oh, mother—mother ! in this breast thy image still shall be, 
And I 
will strive even to the last for to remember thee. 
CHORUS. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purest joy, 
I 
wonder if she thinks of me, her little orphan boy. 
THE HAT ME FATHER WORE. 
Composed by DANIEL McGAirry, and given by him to JOHNNY Roeon, as 
a 
token of respect. 
A IR.—" Irish Molly, 0 !" 
Pm Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's day I 
love to wear the hat me father wore. 
CHOP.US. 
It's old, but it's beautiful— the best you ever seen ; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
I 
t's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore. 
It's old, etc. 
PAT O'BRIEN. 
Pat O'Brien it 
is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from whence I 
came, 
()aid Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy; 
No country is so dear to me as the liatle Isle stands near the 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
OuId Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and 
mirth, 
It's equal can't be found lf you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, swith none of them you 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS 
Pat O'Brien is my name, I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came.

claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to

Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
Ile advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains,

With his knowledge, wi:, and humor, to hear him it was rare;

Pat O'Brien, Jac. 
Ia eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to 
wail ; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tam's Halls, shall strike each chord 
vgain, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea, 
And all our toasts be, Ireland free 
and you'll be happy then.

I 
AM a 
swell of the day as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me ; 
You must have heard of the name which I 
bear) 
Surely you must for I'm known ev'rywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gents are bewildered and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say, 
" 
Oh ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
I 
am the swell of the day__ 
That's what, the reople all say ; 
Go where I 
will they say to nie still, 
lie's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down; 
How can I 
help it when all thro' the town 
People are praying for times to improve ? 
Still Fin contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none ? 
All my delight is in fashion and fun, 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined ; 
Love is a 
stranaer as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne .er c.,n depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spoony fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc.

You've no doubt heard the song, 
Of " Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
how the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
--
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more ; 
But then he would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, &e. 
He'd smash poor mother's nose? 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble iifio bed ; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given hint up for gone, &C.

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Come all ye boys of Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
For you have to fight both day and night, 'gainst John Bull and 
his crew. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty 
cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're g,oing to fight, both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
We sailed away from Dublin Quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen they were all in that town, 
And " RIO a 
ballagh, clear the track !” were the words that 
passed all round, 
Then hurrah, my boys, dte. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine. 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind ; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's 
foes, 
Or any man that hates the laud, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
grows. 
Then hurrah, my boys, dro. 
JERSEY SAN. 
Oh! I 
was be-n 
in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thong-ht too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like. 
to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For lam one, &o. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars, heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sor'e Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, &e: 
At midnight, too, one hears yonng men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
bead-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, ito 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw 
eo line; 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine ; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own ; you know_

COSTEEMONGER, 
JOE . 
As 
sung by JOHNNY ROACH W:th great success. 
Pm Costermonger Joe, and as my rounds I 
go, 
For many a 
mile the girls all smile on Costermonger Joe. 
With mind devoid of care, and spirits light as air, 
I 
whistle and sing, and cabbages bring from Centre Market, oh. 
I 
started young in trade, and a 
nice connection made 
Aloe.- the streets, the avenues and squares. 
Now all I 
have to do is, call a 
thing or two, 
While " Ned," my little donkey, draws my wares, draws my warm— 
While Ned, my little donkey, draws my wares. 
CHOILL13. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and as my rounds T 
go, 
For many a 
mile the girls all smile on Costermonger Joe. 
I'm Costermonger ,Toe—no money do I 
owe: 
There's not a 
crust that's got on trust by Costermongcr Joe. 
And yet to barely live, why, I 
must credit give. 
Or none would deal or grease the wheel :or — os.t.  ermonger Joe. 
It's not the likes of me you in the paper see, 
Petitioning, the court for a 
divorce : 
But those who can almost a 
college education boast. 
So morality by learning loses force, loses force— 
So morality by learning loses / wee. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and steadily I 
row 
The stream of life, but wants a 
wife. does Costermonger Joe, 
His humble lot to share. 
Let her be dark or fair, 
be always sure of affection pure from Costermonger Joe. 
Bow happy would I 
ho in summer after tea, 
To drive My little wife aronnd about 
In the green lanes in my cart, with feelings proud at heart 
That I 
could own what I 
was driving out, driving out--
That t 
could own what I 
was driving out. 
Costermonger Joe, 0, 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and I 
would have on know 
All are not fools from ragged schools. says Costermongor Joe ; 
For it's there I 
first began to lttarn that every man 
His mind must give to work, and live like cestormonger Joe. 
I've told you all my mind in hopes that I 
sbould find: 
So, folks. to own the roughest may be true, 
And beneath the. humble corduroy lie hearts that beat with joy— 
So respectfully .

dreamt but last night, oh, bid luck to ray dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought ' t 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh, didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing ! 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, ' Norab, child, what is your ailing?" 
But all I 
aould utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As nate a totkl palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about scents lonely and drearyl 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery., 
Since 1 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready ? 
The ' moment had come when my love must depart; 
I 
cried like a spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy I " 
'With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart. 
He said ' twas to better his furtune lie's* roaming, 
But whit would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to rue, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal. 
PANAMA. 
As sang by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Once I 
was a 
waterman and lived at home at ease, 
But now I 
am a ! mutineer and plow the raging seas ; 
I 
thought I'd like a 
sea-fareing life to visit lands afar. 
So I 
saded aw.ly from Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
cnonus. 
Then heave away my hearties we're bound for lands afar, 
As we sailed away front Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
Our ship site lay at anchor, in the fam'd Jersey canal. 
She was a 
great and noble ship. describe her now I 
shall ; 
Her cabin N% as on her second deck, through a 
ladder down 
the hole. 
And we were bound for Wigan, me boys, to get a 
big load 
of coal. 
Then heave away, eve. 
Our c.tptain was a 
sturdy man, he stood just six feet three, 
Ilk hair was red. his eyes were green, and his mouth as 
big as three ; • 
He could beat the world at drinking grog, 
search both near and far. 
And his wife she was first mate, me boys, on board of the 
Panama. 
Then heave away. & c. 
We sailed three ti.ays before the mast, when the water it 
got short. 
id every hour each man, me boys, he was allowed a 
quart ; 
We were in latitude a 
hundred and one, no land tor many a 
mile, 
And all the provisions we had on board was a 
bottle of 
Castor Oil. 
Then heave away, 4kre. 
We fell in with a 
big sand junk bound for a 
foreign shore, 
It's thunder and sparibles said I, me boys, I'll go to sea no 
more; 
We had to sail east. west, north and south to keep clear of 
ships in the bay. 
And three years after that, me boys, we landed down 
Broad way. 
Then heave away. Ltc. 
Dur capHan he gave orders for action to clear the deck. 
When the man at the wheel fell through the hole and 
nearly broke his neck ; 
holler'd at my messmates till I 
WaS black in the face. 
But she turned out to be a Gkinaman and bound for SL 
Mark's Place.

SINCLAIR Lawton, in the laughable sketch of Barney 
and the Ghost, as performed by Cnas. MAC EVOY'S original 
Ilibernicon Troupe. 
Och hone, wirrastrew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world 't 
was the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner ; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was puny without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tia 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner ; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in 
The wide mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh %would make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in 
To the !lames that hung high in the cormr. 
And there by the fire my mother NT ould knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimm y the piper walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner ; 
Then at it they went dear with hearts light and gay. 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk  
an' no lin:ger could play, 
For he lay pipes and all ia the corner.

THE TIPPERARY MEN. 
OR, THE ROLLICKING Iutsumix. 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell ; 
It's something new between, 41.2 and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
otto 
t4g,a
, 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! and beat it if you can ; 
There's none so gay, both night and day, as a 
rollicking Irish-
man; 
Whack, whack, whack, burro°, tiddy I 
dow de dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow ; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair we're always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillings a 
week ; 
He bou ,dit a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
They were building a 
house—'twas very high, but Pat didn't 
care a 
jot ; 
To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, how quick up 
the ladder he'd trot ; 
He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas 
frost or the rum. 
This hero bold he missed his hold, and down he came by the 
His name was Pat, etc. 
Now, as Pat down did go, he put his hand so, and then a 
loud 
yell lie gave; 
Ile cried, " ° eh hone!" as down he came ; " may the Lord my 
poor soul save!" 
He turned o'er and o'er when he reached the first floor, on his 
feet he then tried to jump, 
But his head first came down, and when near the ground he 
cried, " Now for a 
thundering bump !" 
His name was rat, etc.

When I 
was quite a

taking way, 
And when I 
was only twelve years old, a 
queer complaint I 
bad, 
They called it kleptomania, and I 
had it very bad; 
The old folks tried their best this ere complaint to cure, 
But no, Was all in vain, break out ' twas certain sure, 
But picking oakum cured me, lop' I 
didn't feel the same, 
So I 
turned my pretty talents to a 
different sort of game.

can't stand those guns what does ate pigging line, 
A man what isn't honest he's not a

didn't like the treatment, so found it didn't pay; 
So now I

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh!" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty- Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a dozen 
more, 
Wird a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the 
floor ! 
We marcli'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift !•• the sargint used to say, 
" 
Nov ye's have it ! can't ye keep it ? 
Turn yer head this way ! 
Right about ! 
Shoulder arms!" 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very diffikilt to kape 0E2 step at all 
Along wid all the others whin paradin in the Hall : 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sare-int he would say : 
" 
Ycr as awkward as the divil ; doan't ye hould yer goon that 
way!" 
THE TIMID AWKWARD SQ UAD.—Continued. 
Whine'er he'd spake an ordher but egad ! ' twas wid a 
vim ; 
I 
often 
upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift!" etc. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we will plod, 
Shouldher arms, and counter marchin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid ; 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift !" etc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make ' em feel me vingeance, all the sar,gints under me! 
I'll have ' cm marchini ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retallyate or give me any talk, 
Ill rejuce thim to the ranks at wanst, and there 
make 'em 
walk ! 
If that ain't punishment enough " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

CLOSE the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit fled 
From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring- time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in heaven where we shall meet. 
CHORUS . 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Hope with him has fled 
FPOM our home, now sad and lone; 
Close the shutters— Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters— Willie's dead; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
Pillowed now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid, 
And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, etc. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead— 
Death has claimed him now; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost broken-hearted, 
And our home is sad to- day; 
Life has lost its hope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away. 
Close the shutters, etc.

MozuEn dear, come bathe my forehead, 
For I'm growing very weak. 
Mother, let one drop of water 
Fall upon my burning cheek; 
Tell my loving little schoolmates 
That I 
never more will play— 
Give them all my toys; but, mother, 
Put my little shoes away.

I am going to leave you, mother, 
So remember what. I

Oh, do it, won't you ? please, mother,

And I

will be an angel 
By perhaps another day, 
So you will then, dearest mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
I 
am going, etc,

Then they'll fit his little feet ; 
Oh, he'll look so nice and cunning, 
When be walks along the street.

Soon I'll say to all good-day! 
Please remember what I

Castles in the Air." 
W HILE thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated at mv cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew ; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some (Treat dissolving view ; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave me 
pain; 
Oh, may I 
never see them in reality again ; 
So ( dye me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my (Treat, dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case ; 
The family of a 
workinman, hunger stared them in the face; 
The mother and their children gathered round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sptoks even threatening every moment to expire ; 
At last the father enters, and Lanus his honest head. 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread; 
Though honest, he is forced to steal, and into jail he's threw ; 
This sal and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court ; two prisoners in were led ; 
One, a 
well- dressed swileiler, and the other a 
boy ill-fed ; 
The bovilad stolen ; ru.d confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat ; 
TIe said, " I 
am an oriltan boy, anti nothing had to eat ;•' 
Three months hard iabor was his dok.yrn—the tears ran down 
his face; 
While he who swindle I 
many a 
man walked out with a 
good 
crra ce ; 
Tie paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him through, 
That ends the case ; and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tra-ric one, I'm sure; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
go ,“1 friend to tie 
Shot down by an as-_assin dastardly and cold : 
But shoothez men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm told ; 
rie murder cf Jim Fisk. I 
mean, a 
man known to you all ; 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolline- kept the ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's none aloft. I 
most s7ncerely do, 
live: more to rest in peace in this dlssolving view.

I'LL come when the little stars are shining, 
Where the twilight soft and still ; 
Into night deeper shadows is declining 
All around the plain and hill. 
I'll seek thee among the willows, 
Where I 
first felt love's young dream, 
And renew our delight, while the moon shines bright, 
Down by the old will stream. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There in the moon's gentle gleam; 
To-night I'll wait for thee, 
And happy we will be— 
Down by the old mill stream 
I'll come when the pretty fiow'rs are sleeping 
When the song- birds are at rest ; 
And I'll bring all the kisses I've been keeping 
For the darling I 
love best. 
I 
long for thy voice to cheer me, 
And the hours so sweet will seem, 
When we sit side by side, while the rippling tide, 
Plays by the old mill stream. 
Down by the, etc. 
We'll bear but the echo of our voices, 
And the streamlets bubbling flow, 
As it rolls on before us and rejoices, 
Seeming glad in the pale moon's glow. 
While nioht is advancing 
We will linger and our vows of old redeem, 
And the angels above will smile on our love, 
Down by the old mill stream. 
Down by the, etc.

W E 
crave your condeseelis:on, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Alulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A Tipperary man— 
Ile carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched ; and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
pflill1:-; and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at flight, boys, 
The (Evil a wink we'd sleep ; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, eta.
