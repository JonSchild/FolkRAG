CT: Today is April 28th. This is an interview for the custodians and janitors in Colorado oral 
history project funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the library of Congress. As a part of 
the project we're interviewing people employed in the janitorial field to record their stories, 
document their skills, knowledge, and better understand their important role in our 
communities. The recording and transcript will become a permanent part of the collection at 
the Library of Congress. My name is Cynthia Torres. We're recording in Colorado. The time is 
approximately 11:00 AM. For the record, do you give us permission to record your story? 
JT: Yes. 
CT: Okay. And could you tell us your name and the year you were born? Not your birthday. Just 
the year. 
JT: My name is Jim Tobar and I was born in 1964. 
CT: And what's your current job title? 
JT: Lead custodian. 
CT: Great. So, I wanna first tell our audience that I know you - you were my supervisor for a long 
time. And when I was a custodian, I got to know a whole different way of being an employee 
because of you, and you're one of the main reasons I applied for this grant, because you're one 
of the people I saw as really extraordinary and a big part of my life. And I wanna be able to 
honor you. 
JT: Well, thank you, Cindy. 
CT: So, we're gonna start out just by getting to know just a little bit about you and what brought 
you here, and then we'll talk about, you know like your philosophy on, on work and, and being 
a custodian. So could you tell us a little bit about what it was like growing up, like your family 
life, where you grew up and, … 
JT: Well, my mom and dad came over from Texas. They didn't really know English too much, 
you know, bits and pieces. My dad came over to work on in fields or to tobacco farms. They had 
a big old outfit here in Longmont. So my dad started there and we were raised at a farm. So we 
didn't really - how do I say - we weren't really city folks. So, we were more like intimidated, 
more like we were more timid. We didn't talk too much because we were not really like social 
because we were on a farm. So we really didn't know how to interact with people too much. 
And then growing up, I remember going to school and also didn't know too much English 
because we spoke Spanish more in our house. So we, we knew more Spanish than English. 
JT: So, little by little, we started learning and my mom and dad, you know, started learning as 
they stayed here for the years, they stayed here. They started learning a little bit more English.

So that's how it was with us. And then it was funny that as, as we were growing up, we would 
talk to them in Spanish and then they would talk to us in English and then we would talk back in 
English and they would talk to us in Spanish. So it was never English, English all time. So that 
was pretty fun. Then growing up with at the farm with my dad, working at a farm with my dad, 
we started learning how to get along with other people because we had to interact with other 
people, Spanish people actually. So there's where we learned how to, how to talk more in 
Spanish. 
JT: I started knowing Spanish a lot, lot more so and then growing up with them there at the age 
of 13, me and my brother started working with my dad out in the fields. And that's how we 
started learning how to work a little bit in the summertime, cuz we had to make money to get 
our clothes. Cuz my mom, my dad was pretty making what, 35 or $3 and 50 cents an hour back 
in the day. But they gave him free home, free light, free water. So kind of made up. 
CT: What did you learn? Like what did you learn about work from your family, from parents? 
4:00 
JT: Well, my mom never worked. My dad was a hard worker, I think just learning from him, how 
he was working and he was a hard worker. I remember that. And he used to like helping out 
people, like if they didn't know how to do something at work or, or fix something like a, 
something on a tractor, my dad was always helping them out. And I think that's where I got my, 
my inspiration of helping out people cuz of him. I learned a lot from my dad - a lot.  
CT: And what brought you over to the custodial? 
JT: Well, I was working at the florist in Louisville Florist for a while and then I remember a lady 
they used to work there for years. Again, we were making minimum wage. We weren't making 
too much there at the florist either. So, she came over to custodial over here at CU. And so I 
knew her husband, so he told me, Hey Jim, why are you working there doing minimum or 
getting minimum wage when you can make a little bit more over here and it's really easy. It's 
not hard. So, he's the one that brang me over to CU and that's how I became working over here 
at CU, cuz of him. 
CT: And how did you, like what jobs did you have when you first came over? 
JT: Over here at, over here? I was at custodian. 
CT: Okay. 
JT: Yeah, custodian. I started out as custodian - picked it up pretty good. Again, I, what my dad 
taught me. I bring it over here. Yeah. So I kind of always went the extra mile to get things done. 
And I, I think a lot of people seen it in the beginning too, but

CT: Do you remember what year that was? 
JT: ‘93 
CT: Been here for a long time. Mm-Hmm (affirmative) what kind of buildings have you worked 
in? 
JT: I've worked with, well, I've worked in like maybe six buildings, different buildings, since I've 
been here. I started at Hale Science, which is, and I still remember Hale Science working there. I 
miss it. I think you do miss buildings that you're in. If you're in there for the longest time you 
get used to these buildings, but when they start taking you out, moving you around, you don't 
get used to the buildings because you're going to back and forth, back and forth. But if you're 
stuck in one building for 2, 3, 4 years, you get used to that building 
CT: And the people? 
JT: Yeah. You get comfortable at that. (Inaudible) at a building. 
CT: Yeah. And what did you like best about…were you the only custodian in the building? 
JT: It was me and another guy. A guy from Peru. Now our both Spanish are way different way, 
way different. And I, I didn't find that out till there was an incident where he used to talk, tell 
me a word and how I was brought up. That word means a different, a different meaning. So as 
he, as we worked together, going through the years, well, a year I kind of like, kind of got a little 
upset because the word he was using to me, it was like not a bad word, but it's like not a good 
word either. So I remember going to my supervisor cuz he was also - he's from Chile. So Peru 
and Chile kind of are the same dialogue. It's the same dialogue with them. And I remember 
telling my, my boss, I go I have a problem. 
7:11 
JT: He goes, well, what's going on? I go, well, every time we do something together, me and 
him, he's always - he's telling me this word that I don't like. And he goes, but what word is that? 
I go and I told him the word, my boss started laughing and I go, why are you laughing? He goes, 
Jimmy, you got it all wrong. The word he's telling you, it's, it's different with you. But (to) us, it's 
a good thing, but you're the way you grew up, it's a bad thing. He goes, not in our - our culture 
it's a good thing. So we squashed it. I go, oh, now I know this, his language is way different than 
mine. (inaudible) we became really good friends. Me and him. (cross talk) Really, really good 
friends. 
CT: But you got to, you got to interact. Like it wasn't just, you know, from Peru and Chili, but 
you got to meet, you know, over the years.

JT: Working with (inaudible), everything, different, different people, 
CT: Yeah. And what has that been like? 
JT: A little difficult because you gotta figure out they're how their, how do I say their 
background is way different than us. Maybe their beliefs is different than us. So, it's, it's a little 
challenging. It was a little challenging, 
CT: But I, you know, being in on your team and everything and being, you being the supervisor, 
I remember like you managed it in a way that was just really like, you know, we all got along for 
the most part.  
 
8:29 
JT: And I think the big, big reason with that too is because I've had supervisors that didn't care 
and I've seen how people struggled, the custodians struggling. And then who were they gonna 
turn to? So, I said to myself, if I ever became a lead or a supervisor, I go, that's not gonna 
happen. I wanna make sure they know what they, they have what they have to work and, and 
know what they're doing, you know? And a lot of, I guess a lot of supervisors don't do that. 
They figure just throw 'em in there, let 'em learn on their own. That wasn't me. And especially 
when they got equipment too, like auto scrubber, I had to make sure they knew what they 
were doing because you can get hurt. And a lot of, a lot of supervisors take that for granted. 
Yeah. They don't want to show people. 
CT: What was your biggest like when you moved from a custodian to a custodial lead, what was, 
was there anything like, oh wow, what have I gotten myself into? Like what, what was the 
biggest… 
JT: It is because there's a lot of, how do I say it? There's a lot of also we have a lot of custodians 
that don't wanna do their job. And it was more of a handfuls, try to make them understand that 
this is a job we all have to do and that we're, we're getting paid for. And a lot of 'em because 
they didn't have that supervision in their other past that they let 'em do whatever they wanted 
to do. It's way different for them to learn too. Cuz they never had that learning experience 
either. So that was kind of hard. Or even, even people that don't speak English well like Laotian 
people. It was hard for me to understand and then I didn't wanna make them feel bad. Like, you 
know, like I was doing on purpose, not understanding, you know, they probably thought, well, 
you know, you do understand, but you're just trying to make fun of me. But no, that wasn't my 
intention. It's like, I wanted to know what they were talking to about, you know what I'm 
saying? Like (inaudible) efforts, you know, another custodian I had to tell her twice. Tell me 
again, tell me again, because I really didn't understand her and I don't know if it made her feel 
Transcription: Jimmy Tobar 
5 
uncomfortable. Cause I was always telling her, tell me again, tell me again, but I wanted to 
make sure I, I understood her. 
10:25 
CT: But after it, I mean, after a time she… 
JT: Then I started understanding a little bit. Cause I already knew her, her moods or when she, 
when it was serious and not serious. Just by how she acted and before I didn't, I was like, wow, 
CT: You understand paying attention to it 
JT: I was paying attention. Yeah. And a lot of people don't 
CT: One of the things that I remember was that I think you were the first person who really like 
this, isn't just, you know, a custodian job where you make, (inaudible) making an hourly wage 
or something like that. Like it was really, no, this is your career. This is your profession. 
JT: And what I thought too, like when all you guys that I had for, for the longest time, I felt like 
we were family. It was more like a family that we had to take care of each other  
JT: But also we took care of the people that we, that we worked for too. 
CT: Yeah. And I remember it was a very different environment, you know, working just kind of 
before I came here and before I came here and working with you, it was there really, wasn't a 
lot of encouragement to reach out and, and talk to, you know, your customers, right. Or to 
think of the people where you worked, who were in the building where you worked, as 
customers. And that was very different. And I just wondered like how, like how you got to that 
kind of mindset to think. 
11:57 
JT: Well, to me, it, it took only a few people from the buildings that interact with me. And then I 
said to myself, it's okay, it's okay to do this because when I first started too, I think we were told 
back in the day, not to interact with customers too much, just do your job, do your job. So, 
they didn't know us. We didn't know them. And then when I got to Joint Institute Laboratory 
for Astrophysics (JILA), it was way different. They wanted to get to know me. I wanted to get to 
know them and we became a big, I call it a big family cuz they cared about us. 
CT: Yeah. What do you think made it different? 
JT: What do you mean?  
 
Transcription: Jimmy Tobar

CT: Like the people, because I noticed a very different environment too here 
12:36 
JT: I actually talked to something about my staff members too. And they said the same thing 
with me when they treat us good. We want to do more. It shows that we wanna do more 
because they care. And like I said, I've also talked to some custodians over the years, too, that, 
and we mentioned how they treat us over here in JILA and they would say, well, they don't 
treat us like that. They never talked to us. And I was wondering, well, why, why? I don't 
understand why they wouldn't talk to you guys. I go, I understand why they talk to us because 
they care about us over here. You know what I'm saying? 
CT: Yeah. And how long have you been working?  
JT: I'd say 16, but I think 17, actually 17 years. 
CT: And over the years, like what, what has helped you build the relationship? Because you 
don't just do custodial - like what, what are some of the things that you do for JILA as a 
custodian? 
13:33 
JT: I like to decorate (laugh) for JILA. I do Halloween. I also do Christmas. I think I took it upon 
myself because again, there's a lot of students that can't go back on holidays and they're stuck 
here at JILA. I've also seen students here on Sundays, Saturday, sometimes. And for Christmas, 
that's a big one for me because I know we always celebrated that in our house for sure. Even 
though we didn't have much - small little tree, but that was a big deal for us. And I wanted to 
bring that here to JILA. And the first time I did it, I know I got a lot of thanks for it. Thank you - 
and thank you for doing that for us. Thank you. And that made me feel a lot more better doing 
it here. Yeah. And as the students were thanking me, I remember a couple of professors also 
thank me and I figured it's okay. They're saying it's okay for me to do it here. And since I've 
done it, the first time I've done it, I've been doing it since over the years and Halloween (laugh) 
CT: You're known for it. Yeah. (laugh) yeah. They know you for it. So, in addition to like 
supporting the students and really trying to make this a place where people don't just come to 
work, but you know, it's their, it's their space. Yes. Really helping create that space.  
JT: And cuz they're here eight hours a day. Most of 'em. So, it's like, you know, you're here eight 
hours  
CT: Yeah. But you also do like the custodial part of it. You do a lot of things like there's the, the 
brooming, there's the mopping. There what like what other…

15:04 
JT: Auto scrubbing everything, 
CT: Everything. The dusting. 
JT: Dusting. We do a lot, even windows. We do windows. When a lot of people don't wanna do 
windows and people don't do windows anymore. We do. We go the extra mile here and they 
appreciate it, you know? And I'm glad they do appreciate it. 
CT: I also remembered, you're talking about what they're doing. Like you're not just paying 
attention to the work. You're paying attention to the habits of the people who are here, so that 
you can better serve your customers. 
JT: Right. And then like, and also there could be like professors or students leave doors open. If 
we notice 'em we close 'em. We don't say, ah, that's not our job. That's their fault. No, no, no. 
We say, okay, they forgot. We'll close. It doesn't take too much to close a door. Yeah. But that's 
what we do. 
CT: Yeah. And it's a very like, so you have all different kinds of spaces in JILA. Like there's an 
auditorium that doesn't really get used. Like what other kinds of like spaces are there? Like 
there's the offices, the labs 
16:16 
JT: Conference rooms, sometimes conference rooms, 
CT: The restrooms, restrooms, hallways, stairways 
JT: The common areas too where they eat, especially where they eat. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of 
compost. 
CT: Oh yeah. Cause this is one of the few buildings 
JT: That they are this really big on compost. Yes, and I think thanks to you too. Recycling. You 
had a big part on this one. 
CT: Yeah. Yeah. It's important 
JT: To me. And it was a good idea too. I mean, everybody got on board it's yes. That's what we 
need to do. 
 
Transcription: Jimmy Tobar

CT: That was awesome. So, with, with all these different spaces, like how do you manage all 
these different needs? And sometimes, you know, when during the summer it's slower during 
the season, when the students are here and it's a research and everything, like how do you, 
how do you think through how to manage people and get all these places covered? 
JT: Because as a manager, you need to look at your building. A lot of managers don't walk their 
buildings, they just give it to the custodians and do what you need to do. And, and, and if 
there's complaints we’ll change it, but they never look at their buildings. I do. I walk it every 
day, every day. And then we go, we go with this again, like during the wintertime, you know, 
sometimes the custodians that work here underneath me, they already know, they'll say, Hey 
Jim, there's a, there's a window that’s open. I go, we need to close it. We need to close it 
because it freezes and they can freeze the pipes and pipes break. But we've done a lot, cuz like I 
said, we've, I think we've saved a lot of, you know, things that can go wrong. You prevented it. 
CT: Nice. 
17:46 
JT: And a lot of other places don't, they don't, it's not my job. It's not my job. But like I said, here 
in JILA me and the staff, we go the extra mile and I appreciate my staff. If it weren't for them, I 
wouldn't be who I am either. And you were a big part of this too. Cindy, back in the day, I give 
you a lot of credit. 
CT: It was just a really wonderful place to work. I mean, I saw it as something to be really proud 
of. And I guess before I became a custodian and I worked, you know, for you maybe, maybe it 
was just, you know, a, a way to pay the bills and it wasn't this something to like, there was a 
way to be proud of and, and that, that came from you. And it was just a really very different 
way of seeing myself and seeing myself in the job. And that was, that did so much for me in so 
many other ways that you helped me have pride in my work and see it, not just as this, you 
know, very low on the total pole position. Right, right. But, and I think the work that you did 
here - building relationships, how did that…because there are so many people in JILA had 
nominated you to be employee of the year for the entire university system. What steps did you 
take to build relationships between the custodial staff and the, and, and the staff in the 
building? 
JT: It was just the person that I am, I guess. I mean, I, I didn't know about that nomination till I 
don't know. It surprised me. I'm like really? And to me, I got overwhelmed. Like, wow, they're 
really looking at me that, you know, I'm a, I'm a, a good worker and they're really seeing it, you 
know? And like I said, it wasn't just me. It was a staff, it was a staff that had a big part on this. 
And I see to me that it was a big deal for JILA professors, students, whoever was involved, it was 
a big deal for them. But when upper management kind of got wind of it, it was like, it's not a 
really big deal to them. It wasn't. To me, it was. So again, working for JILA - this place was the 
place that I think motivated me to do a lot. It was this place and the people that work in this

building outside of that, I probably would've been doing the same thing. Like everybody else, 
not really caring if I was working in another building or whatever, or underneath another 
supervisor, but cuz of this place, I think showed me a lot that they cared. So, it made me go the 
extra mile and the staff.  
20:32 
CT: I know in my experience as a custodian, I think it was the, because the custodial services 
was separate from the buildings and then they, you know, their, their job was to place 
custodians in buildings. But I think that they perhaps didn't see the value of custodial staff in 
not just maintaining a building, but becoming a part of that building's essential team. And I 
remember I interviewed Beth Kroger, you know, who's the chief of operations in JILA. And she 
said, you know, we have you know, two Nobel Laureates here in physics. And she said, we 
couldn't have Nobel prizes if we had facilities issues. And that is why it's so essential for the 
custodians. Not just to be a part of the team and to be partners. And everything they do here. 
Right. But to also see things that maybe, you know, somebody who has a very specialized job 
wouldn't see like, like students and how the students are doing - cause that was a big part of, I 
think, you know, what, what you taught me - it's not just take a look at the building. It was take 
a look at the people too. And how else can you, can you be of service?  
21:57 
JT: And I know too that people visit JILA and give money to JILA and I figured this is why we also 
gotta keep it pretty clean for when they come and give money to JILA. They can see that this is 
well kept up building. I also remember with that when JILA used to have functions too, like 
parties or whatever, they always invited us. They were always inviting us. Yeah. I remember one 
day they had party and we couldn't, we couldn't go to it because it was like that four o'clock 
(inaudible). But I remember somebody had said to one of the people make sure you guys save 
food for the custodians for the next day. Who does that? <Laugh> who does that?  
CT: You really helped the custodial team be a part of a, a quantum research facility, which I 
think for somebody from the outside, that would seem almost like what would be the purpose, 
but it's so essential. I mean, these are, these can be some dangerous labs. Yep. You ha and to 
seek custodians is, you know, I mean, a lot of folks didn't have a lot of education or anything. 
Like I, you know, I never passed a math class, but but I was still, I still knew my job. Mm-Hmm 
<affirmative> I knew my job. Well, I was a profe and that was important to, to keeping these 
labs safe, because, and could you talk a little bit about like what it's like, because you know, it's 
not just like cleaning a classroom and like, like knowing and like paying attention and training 
your staff to, to know how to be in some of these very specialized rooms, like the atomic clock, 
like what, like what, what did you like, how do you train people to be a part of the building or 
know how to know how to interact with 
23:47

JT: Like I said, just going through the work itself and, and knowing what's inside that building or 
inside that room or, or, or lab, I first had to talk to the students and, and tell 'em how 
dangerous is this or what, what is the we're not supposed to be doing? So, when they show me, 
you can't go past this curtain because you know, there's danger here, or you have to wear 
certain glasses for certain lasers. I didn't know that, but I had to get training. My supervisor 
didn't show me that I had to ask. And the reason why I asked too, because again, I was thinking 
about the custodians, their safety. I remember one of the students showed me, see that little 
bur hole in that wall, this laser did it. And he goes, so Jim, just think if, if a custodian were to 
pick up a piece of paper, that's on the floor and bends over that can really hurt their eye and 
they can go blind. 
JT: So, it's very important in some of these labs that you, I know some labs goes, you can't go in, 
but you also gotta make sure if it says not to go in or the laser lights are on, there's a reason for 
that. So, I had to work with him too, to let him know too. Sometimes these laser lights are 
always on every day. So, he was gonna work with me about that too. Cuz sometimes you say, 
yeah, sometimes people forget or we've got new, new students too to come in. And so like I 
said, yeah, just working with them too, make sure that we they're making it safe for us too at 
the same time too, to make sure what we need to know. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> and that's 
how we teach these guys how to do their labs. 
CT: I remember that like when you came in during the day, it was like a well oiled machine. Like 
you knew where to go that day. You knew like you had your schedule down and what needed 
to be clean so that everything, every week was clean from top to bottom mm-hmm 
<affirmative> every week or every other week for the stairs and stuff. Like how did, 
 
25:37 
JT: How did exactly, because again I know other places that's a general fund and I know this for 
a fact. They do their offices once every two weeks, the offices throw their own trash on the 
hallways. Working with the other, other group, I remember telling him, so how do you do your 
job? How do we do this? What does, what day do you do Mondays? And what Fridays, what 
days you do? Well, actually, when we think it's dirty, that's when we do it. I said, what do you, 
what do you mean when you think it's dirty? I go don't you guys have a schedule? No, we just 
know that if we see it dirty, that's when we clean it. And that's why I noticed some of these 
feelings how bad they were now. I know why. And again, and nobody's getting held 
accountable. Nobody is we go to a building that we took over me and this other supervisor she 
has to bring in people overtime just to pick up that building overtime when they could have 
been doing it during their work time. So, you mean that looks bad because now you're paying 
people extra money just to pick up an area when it should have been done during their work 
hours. But not JLA. We're doing our job the way we're supposed to be doing every day, every 
day.

CT: And I know like you had specific areas, well, this person might be better for this area. This 
person might be better for this area. Like how did you go about how, like what's your process in 
thinking, because you know, you're taking care of your people and the building. 
27:09 
JT: I look at their strengths and their weaknesses. So, if I say, okay, this all, like let's say a certain 
area, it has a little bit more work to do. I divide it. I wanna make sure everybody has their, the 
same workload too. But if I know this person's stronger on vacuuming. Okay. Make sure she's 
comfortable doing it though, but I'll put that person in that vacuuming, cuz I know she's 
stronger. This person can probably do restrooms better, better than me. Maybe that person's 
going to the restrooms. Yeah. I've had one person that was doing bathrooms before restrooms 
didn't work out. She wasn't doing her job, but again, it was on me to make sure they're doing 
their job. They fail. I fail. 
CT: Yeah. What was it like? So, everything, you know, you have everything scheduled out and, 
and people know their roles and what their responsibilities are. And we have a good 
relationship with the staff and the professors and everything. And COVID happened. And then 
like how one, how did that impact you in the way you thought about things and what changed 
here and how did you, how did you have to, what did you have to do as a manager? 
JT: It was scary. It was scary because a lot of the staff that didn't want to be here, a lot of the 
staff thought that they were gonna get it and, and looking to me and telling me, so why do we 
have to be here? Why, why, why? And I go, this is a job. This is essential service. We need to be 
here. And not being close together, all this thing took a lot toll on all of us. And if somebody 
sneezed, oh my gosh, you have it. You have it. No, they're just sneezing. It's probably 
(inaudible), they're doing their job, but oh my gosh, it just, it was one big panic, one big panic. 
And they were certain, then we couldn't do labs anymore. We couldn't, we weren't allowed to 
go into the labs anymore until all this was over. 
29:12 
JT: Even offices, sometimes we weren't allowed break rooms. We didn't have a break room no 
more. So, we didn't. We had to figure out where to eat and, and staff complaining a little bit. 
Then why aren't they giving us an area for us to be eating if we, if they don't want us to be 
sitting down here on these chairs? Oh, it was a big headache, big, big headache. But luckily as it, 
as it started going more and more, we started getting used to it and the mask was a big thing. 
Nobody wanted to wear masks. That's another big thing that we had to convince them. We 
have to wear masks. When they heard custodians getting sick from COVID, another panic came 
into play. Well, this person was with this person and this person, and this person started talking 
to me, how do I know that person don't have, oh, it was just chaos, chaos. 
CT: Everybody left campus.

JT: There were people working from home and the staff was feeling like they should have 
gotten paid more for being here. They heard other places. They were given incentives or for 
being here or even a little bit more money for being here, but not this place. That's another 
thing that I had to deal with just to try to calm him down. It's okay. It'll get better. It'll get 
better. 
30:30 
CT: How did, like before were you just had regular vacuuming and white being or dusting? How 
did the actual job change? Like what, what kinds of new things? 
JT: We had to do use a fogger to fumigate a lot of these places. And we also had to use - we had 
to wipe down rails a lot more, buttons from the elevator, windows, doors. Everything had to be 
wiped out daily. So that was a big change. Yeah, it was a big change. 
CT: Have things gotten back to normal at all? 
31:08 
JT: Yeah, they're getting back to normal now, a little bit. More, way more than, yeah. A lot 
more. 
CT: Did anybody get COVID? 
JT: Yes. I guess two custodians did die that I heard of from COVID yes. Everybody got COVID. 
Everybody from my staff, everybody got it too. And they had to stay home for two weeks or 
whatever time it had to take for them to quarantine. But yeah, every, pretty much everybody 
got it.  
CT: How about you? 
JT: I think I got it from the beginning before it started. Yeah. I had the same symptoms. It was 
me and another manager and we were talking about it and I remember I had to go to the 
hospital and they told me, did I ever, did I, have I gone out of the country? I said, no, but within 
four weeks, five weeks after I had it, six weeks that's when we heard COVID was coming around 
or there was a breakout of COVID. So, I think I did have it. I think I did have it in the beginning 
cuz I had the same symptoms as everybody that had COVID. (cross talk) Yeah. But again, it, it 
still wasn't around. Nobody knew what COVID was, so yeah. And then the booster shots and 
the shots, that's another big drama that came into play. Nobody wanted to do the shots. 
Nobody.

CT: Were there fears about 'em? 
JT: ‘Cause they thought it was gonna mess up your body or it had stuff in it. I mean, people talk 
(laugh) you know what I'm saying? So that's another big one issue that we, I had with the 
custodians - that they want to take it. Why, why, why? 
CT: Did they eventually? 
JT: Yes, they had to (cross talk) Mandatory. 
CT: Oh yeah. That's right. that's right. Wow. That must have been really challenging for you. 
How was it, like just emotionally, you know, just trying to get through every day? 
JT: Yeah, it was, it was for me and the staff. I mean, it was scary. Scary. 
CT: How did, how did you help them? 
JT: Just trying to comfort them. Just, just say, hey, everything's gonna be okay. You know, I'm 
here with you guys. We're here together, you know? And I think too that when they see me not 
stressing about it in front of them or being worried about it, I think it calmed them a lot more. 
You know, that saying it, it's gonna be okay now if I would've freaked out and made the same 
way like them, oh it would've been worse and worse for sure. 
CT: Wow. Well, I'm glad that you were (inaudible) your team. You know, came through it. (cross 
talk) That must have been really hard. In your life, you know, growing up on the farm and 
everything, what have, what has been some of the biggest challenges that you've had that have 
might, you know, learning from those big challenges, how has that impacted the way you do 
things now or how you interact with people? 
34:03 
JT: Well, like what do we like? 
CT: Like, has there been just learning experiences, just growing up and the way you grew up 
that have helped you say, look, I'm gonna be this person. This is the kind of person I'm gonna be 
that have changed you? 
JT: You know what I, I think learning from my dad, how my dad struggle to, I mean, my dad had 
a lot of struggles at his workplace. People taking advantage of him. Like again, from the 
beginning, I said, my dad used to always like to help people. And he did. He enjoyed helping 
people. I think his satisfaction was helping them to make sure they knew what they were doing 
in their job. But at the same time, certain people took advantage of my dad and I watched it 
over the years. And to me, I think I took my dad's way in helping people, but I don't want

people taking advantage of me either that I'm gonna do their job. And once I helped do their 
job and they don't have to do it anymore, that's what happened to my dad. Cuz I remember my 
dad, I was young and they would call him over, Hey, I can't fix this. 
JT: I can't fix this. And my dad left his job or his workplace and came and fixed the fixed the 
person's problem. And then he started walking around like nothing. He didn't have nothing else 
to do. And my dad had to go back to do his job and, and there's places like that here all over. I 
understand that. And that's one thing too that I said that made me stronger in a way - mindset 
and, and work wise ethic to be like him. But, also I didn't want nobody taking advantage of me. 
And sadly to say, I think I got took an advantage a couple of times here by a management, but 
that's another story, but yeah. But like I said, that could have changed me here at, at, at CU - 
seeing how these guys took advantage of me - upper management a little bit. But because I 
worked here in JILA, no I'm that guy. Still that same guy that will still always help people out. 
And that didn't change me. It could have, but like I said, being here in JILA - how people treated 
us, you know? 
CT: Made the difference,? 
JT: Made a difference.  
36:14 
CT: I remember as an employee, like you were always making sure that, you know, because we 
rotated jobs, like every two weeks or, you know, and, and if one person didn't do their 
vacuuming during those two weeks, then the person coming in on vacuuming, you know, would 
have a lot more to do (cross talk) And so you were always holding us to talk on making sure that 
we did that. And just so grateful. Yeah. I remember talking to Beth Kroger about what it, you 
know, like how, how do you manage people in a way that you get, you know, Nobel Laureate? 
And they said you give people - everybody knows their jobs. But there's also this - they know 
there, that they have the freedom to make it theirs. Yep. And you did that too. 
JT: If they needed to change something in their job description or, or hey, can we do something 
different? Yes. You have to listen to them, cuz they probably have a better idea ‘cause they're 
doing this job more than you have or longer. So, I gave 'em that also. I remember too, the only 
way if I would've got to get respect from the staff and make 'em work and in a right way, is for 
me also to be in the, in that workplace and, and working and doing what they're doing, 
cleaning, cleaning restrooms or whatever have you, I have to be in there too. Just show 'em 
that I care. 
CT: I think a lot of people maybe who aren't custodians think that's just like, there's not a lot of 
skill involved. No, but there really is. (cross talk) Could you talk a little bit about, because you, 
also do a lot of training for custodians coming in or, or temps that come in to work in custodial 
jobs and, how do you go about training them?

38:05 
JT: Well, again, being at this job for the longest time and, and really knowing what you're doing 
even cleaning restrooms, I mean, there's, there's certain ways to clean restrooms. I mean, you 
have to use a johnny mop, get in there first. How do I say it? Disinfect the toilet first and then 
work your way from inside and work your way out. I mean, there's different ways to do it. I 
mean I know there's a lot of people that just flush the toilets and they don't really care, but I 
mean, you need to show, you need to show 'em what they're doing and make sure they're 
doing a good job. I mean, like I said, there's a, there's ways of doing things even vacuuming. I 
mean, there's certain people just go back and forth to, to just pick up any little thing they're 
seeing, but it's actually, you gotta do the whole, not the whole office, but make sure 
everything's looked at, not just look at a little bit corner and that's it and close the doors. That's 
where everything starts falling apart little by little. 
JT: And the details. 
39:03 
CT: Cause you, I remember you had me going through the walls, you know, looking at the walls 
because yeah. They get scuffed up and they get marked. 
JT: Right. Especially the noticeable things that you can really notice. I mean, if you're going by, 
you would notice it then, you know, it needs to be cleaned because you're, you're noticing it. 
CT: There are a lot of things that perhaps people who don't clean don't realize, you know, gets 
dirty, like at a place where there are hundreds of people going through every single day. 
JT: Or even also our staff is trained to, like if there's a something broken or, or, or even like a if a 
toilet doesn't flush, we know to report it. And a lot of staff say, it's not their job. They're not 
getting paid to report. We don't - we report lights out. We report them. And I remember Jason, 
the guy that works here too, as maintenance. He's always thanking us for reporting things 
because he says, Jimmy, you're our eyes and ears early in the morning because a lot of Fac Man 
don't get in here until like almost 7, 7:30. And, and we are not, we're not always walking the 
buildings. You guys, you guys are always out there walking the buildings. So, thank you for 
doing that for us. 
CT: For keeping it safe. Because, there are times, like, I remember one time we came into the 
building and it was full of smoke. 
JT: Yep. 
CT: And you called 911.

JT: Or even shoveling outside, make sure everything was shoveled early in the morning before 
these professors get in. Or, if there's a broken stair slab out there too, make sure you report it 
before it gets worse.  
(cross talk) 
JT: And a lot of people don't do that. It's not their job. That's ground's job. No, it's part of our 
building. It's still our job. 
40:40 
CT: Well, it was an incredible, incredible pleasure to work here and to work with you. 
JT: And also with you, Cindy, because you went over - how I say - above and beyond with me. I 
mean, I, I could say, Cindy, I need to go do this or I need to go finish this and you would always 
say, can I help you? Can I help you? You're a big part of me too, of my, my success over the 
years, too. Yeah. For helping me out when I needed it. 
CT: If there were people coming in - when they come in as temps or when they come in as new 
custodians or something like that, is there advice that you would like if you had your choice to 
talk to every custodian that came in to work here for the first time? If you could give them 
advice, like what would you tell 'em? What would you tell 'em about about their work, about 
their job, about, you know (inaudible)? 
JT: I would just make sure that they know their equipment before they start. And to me, like I 
said, I would just tell 'em, Hey, this is a good place to work people, you know, they really like us 
here. And, and we all do our job the way we're supposed to. And I would just tell 'em, you 
know, just do the best you can. I mean, and if you ever need help on anything that you don't 
understand, talk to me, call me or whatever, but I'll just tell, you know, we're all a good a family 
here. And if you're coming into our family, you know, be a part of us. Just work like we're doing. 
42:18 
CT: You made it more than a job for me. You made it like a, like a career, something that I could 
be proud of. It was, I wasn't the bottom, you know, I wasn't, you know, the bottom on the 
totem pole, I was, I was a part of something a lot bigger. I just had my very specific role to play. 
And that was, that was really extraordinary. And you helped me do that and I could, you know, 
could never thank you enough. 
JT: And, so I said, you were one of the best workers I've ever had - seriously that you didn't have 
to think twice. Seriously. You would just jump in it. And I remember you always telling me, I 
love the machine shop <laugh> I love the machine shop cuz it takes you back.

CT: Yeah. The smells and everything. I didn't really go through the questions that I had, but 
what is - looking back, on your time here, because you're gonna, you're coming up on 
retirement in a couple of years. What is, what are your best, your fondest memories right here? 
43:21 
JT: My fondest memories here on campus or on JILA, I would say being here in JILA. Being here 
in JILA again. Bringing in the plants. Doing Christmas for everybody and just watching their faces 
like, wow, this is, this is nice. Or even Thanksgiving or even Christmas or Halloween. I also, 
every year I try to do, I try to outdo myself to get it more scarier and scarier (laugh). And again, 
for me would be, how I got treated here in JILA by professors and, and also the students, 
especially the students, how they're really respectful, respectful. That's the big part I'm gonna 
take with me when I retire and people like you, hard workers. I'll never forget that. 
44:15 
CT: Well, thank you. Thank you so much for participating in the interview and talking about, and 
just how best to be a custodian (inaudible) more than the work itself. And yeah, just thank you 
for everything. (cross talk). Do you have anything more you wanna talk about?  
JT: No, I think I'm good. That's good. Yeah.  
CT: Okay. Well, thank you. Okay. We're gonna end the recording now.
