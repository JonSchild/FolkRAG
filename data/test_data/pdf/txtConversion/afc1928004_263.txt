HILDERBRAND MONTROSE, 
BY ED. IIIRRIGAN. 
Performed by HARRIGAN & Rum 
Music!. Published by E. H. Harding. 220 Bowery, N. Y. Price 100. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A. 
Yams, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
His name is Hilderbraud Montrose, 
Some folks call him Charley; 
In his button-hole he wears a 
rose, 
He can Francais vooley parley; 
His hair, in Auburn ringlets, 
His eyes an azure dark ; 
The girls they call him Birdie, 
Like the Swallows in the Park. 
CHORUS. 
Ta-Ta, Ta-Ta, my baby dear, 
I'd meet you in the Park. 
If the weather it is clear ; 
He'd strike you with a 
feather, 
Every Daisy knows; 
The darling of the ladies 
Is Hiklerbrand Montrose. 
His necktie is golden scarlet, 
This most exquisite fellow, 
He looks like a 
Christmas present, 
Under his silk umbrello; 
His boots are patent leather ; 
He never pays his bills— 
He always drinks plain soda— 
And eats up toothpic quills. 
Ta-Ta, Ta-Ta, ScO, 
•••• 
Au B,evoir! 
Au Revoir! 
You should hear him say; 
must go and buy some gum drops 
For Clanville, across the way; 
XII the girls together 
Are dying for a 
beau; 
Of course the individual 
Is Hilderderbrand Montrose. 
Ta-Ta, 
He parts his hair in the centre, 
Chalks his paper collars, 
His papa is very wealthy, 
Worth one million dollars; 
In Big Ponanza Mining Stocks 
Ms voice is quite Soprano, 
You ought to bear him sing Love's Chidings, 
On a 
Fogarty piano. 
Ta-Ta, Tat Ta, 
I3ye-Bey! Bye-Bey! 
I 
must tear myself away, 
Before the bright Aurora 
Gilds the Summer clouds so gay; 
The ladies, Heaven bless 'em, 
Positively knows 
Their choicest little treasure, 
Is Hilderbrand Montrose.

THERE'S a

And it points direct to me; 
how the little spark is shining ! 
And it came from that dunce. 
It's larger than it was las month— 
A

Yes; I 
know it's from the heathen, 
But I'm sure I 
cannot pay. 
CHORUS.

It takcs lay change from me ; 
Won't some one shoot that heathen 
From far across the sea? (
Repeat.) 
How this wash-bill cloth perplex me— 
'Tis no superstitious dread, 
For I 
know it is 
riginal— 
Hls mark is at the head; 
But when the bill is settled, 
Oh, how happy I 
will be! 
Then no more I'll take my ashing 
To that Chinese Imindry.

How well do I

But I

So he took my duds from me.

Summer groves may lose their gladness; 
Wint'ry winds may wander by; 
Cares may come and weary sadness, 
Must we then forever sigh ?

Hopeful hearts will find forever— 
Roses underneath the snow! 
CHORUS. 
Brave the storm with firm endeavor, 
Let your vain repinings go! 
Hopeful hearts will find forever— 
Roses underneath the snow. 
One by one the links that bind us 
May be severed here on earth ; 
But the Sun will surely find us 
Thro' the Winter's gloomy dearth! 
Cheerful hearts around us beating, 
Waring ever Summer's glow, 
Ah! we know you're always meeting— 
Roses underneath the snow! 
Brave the storm, .te. 
Never joy that earth can send us 
Can forever leave us here! 
Ev'ry flower that Spring can lend us 
Blooms again another year! 
Cares may come, but never mind them, 
Joys may come and joys may go! 
Look around and you will find them— 
Roses underneath the snow! 
Brave the storm, Ice. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR." 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say: 
CIIORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind,. 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Dne night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude ifelnotte," and suited her Due; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be miner 
Spoutx,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little wife. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with e 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

WE often read of the power 
Of princes and of kings, 
Who stripp'd of all their grandeur, 
Are but poor mortal things; 
But there's a 
Nwer stronger, 
Which lasts for time untold, 
To which all men must bow and that's 
The bright, bright Gold. 
CHORUS. 
Gold, Gold, Gold I 
love to hear it ; ing!e, 
Gold, Gold, Gold! its power is untold, 
We men strive hard to store it, 
And woman she'll adore it, 
The best friend that a 
man can have Is 
Gold, Gold, Gold! 
The man that's minus money, 
The world will cell a 
flats 
And pass him by, but if he's rich, 
wil gaily raise its hat; 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But sthiles on he who wins, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins. 
Gold, Gold, 
The maid both plain and ancient, 
Appears a 
perfect " sweet," 
If rich, her gold magnetic draws 
"Fond" lovers to her feet; 
Some say this Gold's a 
curse, and that 
It causes strife and pride, 
But we know it is a 
blessing, 
When its properly applied. 
Gold, Gold, 
Love and content in a 
cottage, 
I've heard of, so have you, 
But I 
fear that kind of bliss, 
Is only experienced by few: 
When trouble comes unto the door, 
Love flies, or else grows cold, 
And the only thing to warm it up Is 
Gold, Gold, Gold!

YOU have heard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name: 
And, faith 
he had a 
sister, too, 
Was noted for her fame: 
She was chief-cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making a 
hash was gr at; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
CHORUS. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin: 
And her age was twenty-eight, 
Her cheeks were red, 
And so was the head 
Of Mulcahey's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
g to see; 
e

And treats me to cakes and tea, 
And oftimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whispering my love story to 
Mulcahey's sister Kate, 
CHORUS. —She is tall and thin, etc. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I

That she was fooling me;

And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a

America the Land of the Free 
Written and sung by Mn. Tom HARPER. 
Respectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the C9th New York 
Regiment Volunteers. 
Oh! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Where peace and plenty now does reign; 
And an Irishman, there, is as good as any one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore, 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand; 
And they said, you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
CHORES. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh! I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its desolation over the land; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with many a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crew! 
And they marched us down South to what they call Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red, White and Blue! 
Then hurrah for America, 1:c. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble, 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America, be free I 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for America, icc

FUNNY THINGS r 
vE SEEN. 
BASJO SOLO. 
To Longs R. TAYLOR, Memphiq, Tenn. Ily Jogx 
rxDGIG_ 
I 
FEEL so goo l 
this evening 
Ill sing you all a 
song— 
I 
promise that I'll make you laugh, 
And not detain you long; 
As ev'ry one seems in for fun, 
Of course I 
can't be mean. 
So listen while I 
vocalize 
The funny things I've seen. 
I've seen a 
female elephant 
Play seven up to win, 
With Uncle Jimmy's Thom is cat, 
Who thinks it is no sin; 
And if by chance the Thomas cat 
Held big car " s 
and wen: out, 
The ( lephant would then get mad 
And " trump" him with his snout.. 
I've seen a 
snake and lizard 
Go "courting in the rain;" 
The snake was mean and vici 
And the lizard she was vain; 
Says snakey: " Will you have me?" 
Says she "You'll never do." 
Then snakey got his back un, 
And bit her nibs in two. 
I've seen a 
tight-rope walker 
Go up in a 
balloon, 
And that is Low there c. me to Oa 
A man up in the m on. 
I've seen a 
monkey's uncle 
Play Hamlet on the s' age. 
And that's the reason Mark Twain wrote 
The famous " Gilded Age." 
Yes, lots of funny things I've seen— 
No doubt you've seen the same— 
For " all the word's a 
stage," you know,. 
And iiI2, is but a 
game. 
Of all the funny things I've seen, 
And what I'd like to see, 
Is Tilton sitting on a 
chair 
With Beecher on his knee.

WE are the pluck. little " Team " 
Of Yankee Shooteleers, 
Who marched way t

An 1

We score 1 
a " bull's-eye " every pop, 
Or nine times out of ten, 
And won a 
Cup of Friendship from 
Warm-hearted Irishmen. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we're the boys to shoot, 
And never miss the mark; 
We often have, w 
th ease, put out 
A 
candle in the dark. 
We've shot with Lord and Duke, 
With n3bleman and Prince, 
And ome rally do believe 
We've been " shot 
ever since.

With Enr,land but, you 
Old Johnny Bull was in u ) mood 
T , give us boys a

Someyears ago a

Our " shots" made Johnny dance. 
Chorus.—Oh, we're, Jce 
It seemed too bad to march away 
Without a

So Captain asked for just one turn, 
A 
Id promised them to go. 
They picked the best men in the land 
To shoot for Cousin John, 
But next day we for Scotland marched, 
And took the Cup along. 
Chorus.-0h, we're, kn. 
In Scotland—so the peo he said— 
We'd learn a 
thing or too; 
They pro nised, in a 
boasting way, 
To show what " Scots " could do. 
And so they did! 
With might and main 
They tr ed their very best, 
But that same night their little Cup 
We packed up with the rest. 
Chorus.-011, we're, ,

No place like home to me. 
Some t . ink we're looking better since

From sunshine on the sand, 
Or, like the " Teams" on t'other side, 
Perhaps we're rather " tanned."

Copyright. 15M, by A. J. Ftsaix. 
A DAMSEL I 
met, oh! how can I 
describe her, 
She looked like an angel just shorn of her wings, 
braced myself up and walked close up beside her, 
And thought her just then the most lovely o thing,s. 
her step was so graceful, her smile so bewitching, 
I 
was quite a' a 
loss what to say, I 
confess, 
When she dropped a 
small handkerchief and worked in silk 
stitching 
In one corner the letters " C. L A. M. S." 
CHORUS. 
But C. L A. M. S. I 
couldn't understand, 
What could a 
creature fair as she have to do with clams, 
The answer that she crave me when I 
asked her to explain, 
Was Clara Louisa Anna Maria Snifkins is my name. 
This little white handkerchief I 
quickly recovered, 
And then I 
approached her to make known her loss, 
Said I 
beg pardon, Miss, but by chance I &cove ed 
You drop this on the corner when going to cross. 
On, thank you, kind sir, said this model of beauty, 
And the smile that she gave I 
shall never forget, 
I 
resolved then to win her and thought it my duty 
To make love right away, which I 
did, you can bet. 
Chorus.—But, 
C. 
When I 
told her I 
loved her she declared I 
was bold, 
But smiled when I 
said it and looked very pleased, 
Then told me her husband was rich and quite old, 
And I 
drew her up closer and gave her a 
squeeze. 
I 
shall never forget though, the,reception she gave me, 
When I 
called at a 
house this fair dam-sel to meet, 
She took all my cash then declared I 
was crazy, 
And a 
bouncing young man bounced me out in the street. 
Chorus.—But, 4tc. 
Now, some one 
said it, at least so I'm told, 
Whoever it was they were wonderful wise, 
That all you see glittering is surely not gold,— 
Oh! what would I 
give if I 
had two such eyes. 
Experience, they say, is the greatestiof teachers, 
So I 
suppose I 
shall have to go clear through the mill, 
To be up to the tricks of these angelic creatures, 
Made up of paint, powder, and feathers and frill. 
Chorus.—But,

Sung with 
great success, by Vic REYNOLDS. 
It's just one year ago to-day, 
Since I 
first fell in love 
With a 
charming little fellow-, 
Who calls me his turtle-dove. 
He asked me if I'd take a 
walk, 
And offered me his - rm; 
And said he would show me 
How to feed the ducks that's on the farm. 
CHORUS. 
-Feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack! Quack! 
Feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack! Quack! 
His style is so neat, and he looked so sweet, 
While feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack! Quacla 
He has asked me to become his wife— 
I 
don't know what to say; 
He says I 
will make him happy 
If I 
will name the wedding day. 
I 
think that I 
shall answer yes! 
And to his sorrow put an end; 
And when we move on the farm 
My assistance I 
can lend.

Oh! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels orrjigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs; 
We learned our, dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes, 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber Mokes.

We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig; 
Oh! watch us while we sling these number 'levens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh ! the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around; 
Oh! we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch ,:tis while we done our double-twist.

Br EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year len, by A. 
"min, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washiarbes. 
I'vc a 
very large family at home, 
Meself and the old woman, two, 
Four girls and five little boys; 
I 
have plenty of labor to do 
To advise and instruct them in study, 
And walk by the square Rule of Three; 
They all take after their mother 
But Danny, he takes after me. 
Omar 
s. 
He's as proud as a 
soger on parade, 
Or a 
blackbird that sings from a 
tree 
He's the image, they say, of his father, 
For Danny, he takes after me. 
1tbdolpho takes after his mother, 
tIvina and Rosy likewise; 
And just like a 
goat in a 
parlor, 
hey'd butt if they didn't get pies; 
When Edward° sets down to his dinner, 
With the sugar he makes himself free, 
Dan hits him a 
puck in juguler, 
For Danny, he takes after me. 
He's as proud, &c. 
He's an eye in his head like an Eagle, 
lie resembles the great Bull-vi-dere; 
And just like the Empress of Chiny, 
His foot's just as small as his ear; 
His voice it resembles the Cuckoo, 
Or the Mermaid that swims in the sea; 
He's a 
darling, I'm tould, 'mong the ladies, 
.For Danny, he takes after me. 
He's as proud, &a.

END SONG—AS

Brother and my Sister, and I 
tell you, 
Let my people go; 
gwine to put on de golden shoe, 
Let my people go; 
And straight to glory I 
will go, 
Let my people go; 
For de Angel Gabriel told me so, 
Let my people go. 
CHORUS. 
Way down in Moses; Way down in Egypt's land,. 
Tell Old Pharaoh to let my people go. 
Great big Nigger on a

Let my people go ; 
And when you get full you've got no sense! 
Let my .people go.

UNDER THE SEA. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free, 
I 
wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea, 
CHORUS. 
This Is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink was pure, and not 
Adulterated stuff, 
They'd no Good Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court had they got, 
And they never read " The Englishman," 
01 they were a 
happy lot. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could I 
e 
'They'd ne'er had an 
Odger," no claimant" Sir Roger,,, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
H 
They'd never had a 
national debt, 
They never were troubled with wars, 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Df railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CHORUS. 
33 
"I his is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
A:, plain, as plain could be, 
You Inay doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jail, 
Flit) miles under the sea. 
Never a 
ryne had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The mothers-in-law all lived by themselves 
Ten thousand milcs away; 
No pater was troubled with milliners' bills, 
Their children ne'er numbered a 
score, 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each shoula have two and no more. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming 
As plain, as plain could be, 
I 
then heard a 
knock, and it's past ten o'clock, 
f came up then from under the sea. 
Words and Music by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
This is DELEHANTY & Cummixos' Champion Song & Dance. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone down, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, 
rut how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner thcre I 
found. 
(symph.) 
CHORUS. 
She deigned to smile upon me, ( Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
CHORUS. 
So arm in arm we wandered, 
Yes, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew.

MUSIC BY DANE BRAHAM. 
Writtk-u and sung by ED HARRIGAN, with great success. 
Oh! I'm an Irish laborer, 
Hardy, stout and strong; 
Idleness I 
never loved— 
To our race it don't belong. 
I've still the strength and will to toil, 
For the wants of life are dear, 
But tould, whenCer I 
as for work, 
No Irish wanted here! 
CHORUS. 
Ye might think it a 
misfortune, 
To be christened Pat or Dan; 
To me it is a 
blessing to be called Irish ma4 
I 
may live to see the day— 
'Twill come, oh never fear— 
When ignorance gives way to sense; 
Au' ye'll welcome Irish here! 
Whin your country was in danger. 
A 
few short years ago, 
Ye was not so particular 
About who would fight the foe. 
Whin men were needed for the ranks, 
To preserve her rights so dear, 
Among the bravest of the brave, 
It was, Irish wanted htre ? 
'Ye might think, 
For generous hearts and charity, 
Ye may search the world around, 
Poor Paddy's hospitality, 
Shure, its like was never found ; 
He'd give the clothes from off his back— 
His blood, for friends so dear! 
But prejudice and envy vile 
Says, No Irish wanted here! 
Ye might think, Sce 
Oh ! let your hearts be kind and just, 
An' help Paddy from the wall ; 
For God in Heaven made the world, 
Wid lots of room for all. 
Let's stretch our 'lauds across the sea, 
To the Green Gold Lsle so dear, 
An' give the Irish boys an' girls, 
A 
glad welcome over here!

Since I

COTTON PODS. 
As sung by the Li VERDE Children. 
Down a

wood, 
In early childhood's days. 
I 
first saw Nell the village Belle--
The idol of my lay ; 
And when evening casts its shades, 
0 ! what a 
happy Southern sod, 
We wandered forth in hand and hand, 
To pick the cotton pods. 
Down a

In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Null, the village Belle, 
The idyl of my lay. 
CHORUS. 
Cotton pods, snow white, 
Beaming in starlight ! 
Emblem, sweet Nellie, of my love for yon. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I 
first gave you the heart that was true, 
Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same ; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again. 
here you are, my own sweet love, 
0 ! conic and sit down by my side, 
And answer, darling quick!y, do ! 
And say you will be my bride. 
iSoth.- -I 
see the love light in your eyes, 
Of when we first did meet ; 
And now we are happy with our joys, 
In love and kisses sweet.

Pull Yourselves Together, Boys. 
Originally sung by Miss ELL 
A W ESNEE. 
We're all of us bothered sometime in our lives, 
something that's sure to go wrong, 
With us our children, our sweethearts and wives, 
As life's road we journey along. 
That trow_les are hard I 
confess, at the time, 
Though afterwards they appear small ; 
And I 
will endeavor to show in my rhyme, 
A 
way to get over them all. 
C 
HOP.US. 
Pull yoursaves together, boys, 
Pull yourselves together, 
Never mind the knock down blows, 
But pull yourselves together. 
'Tis nice when your cupboard is scanty and bare, 
To have hungry visitors call, 
And say they've pop d 
in your small dinner to share, 
But hope you won't mind them at all; 
The last bob has vani--,hed for victuals and drink, 
And so has your credit as well : 
You treat them as friepds, but in frenzy you think, 
That it is a 
terrible sell 
SzoRE.N. 
Still, nevertheless! you must 
Pull yourselves, & C. 
'Tis nice when you borrow and pay interest large, 
To be just a 
little behind; 
And go home and find broker's men are in charge, 
And taking your goods---ilev.r mind— 
Your furniture, woLth more than treble your debt, 
is seized by these scoundrels, lu. they 
Will find to their cost there are Magistrates yet, 
Who'll make the r )gues heavily pay. 
Pull yourselves, 3te. 
lt's raptir,3 when out until three or ' till four, 
'Unknown to your wife, on the spree, 
To rind that the chain is put up on the door, 
And you have forgotten the key. 
It's nice wen you serve on a 
jury. to find, 
Your tailor sits next door but one, 
And he is a 
Claimant, bia. ! never mind, 
All trials will some day be done. 
mtil life's little trials are over you must—

But pull yourselves together.

those who have never perused the sad story of CHAS 
LOWE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And -virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in thr .anguage of Mrs. Rowson, " affords t„ 
lriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be 
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

TiE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No cue who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from :qrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
lelves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
_Oaughter, Lucy femplc. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characteiizes the life of tile unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and. consolations which those areund us 
can neither give nor take a\wy." 
Tt contrasts in 
living colors the rl . hest fruits of virtue and happi-
qtess on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments -tnd rTiir resulting from once yi,71.:2-
ing to the seductive intmence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in :Px.c: attentioa to the end.

and Builder, July, 1874. 
Fie author of this work is well known as an extensive 
v,-.-iter who has r:.ade some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in c manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair kuovrelge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a 
work 
of reference. 
ilost ambitious young men will make them-
sAves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
reldily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is nc-t without value, and might ho advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printel on good white p•tner, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
