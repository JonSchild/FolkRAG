When I 
ax how to make de notes, he sed I 
must go down wid a 
ladder to get de low notes, dive 
under de brige for de middle notes, an take a 
pint ob 
yeast to raise de high notes. 
It took a 
bullgine to 
wind up de screws, four pair of horses to draw de 
bow, an when dey wanted to stop it dey rolled on 
an omnibus. 
Byrne-bye dey gin to blow de old

And if you say I'll go at you,

We are an honest set, 
As the world ever saw, 
And the way we make our living, 
Is by using of our jaw.

For we're all running to the steamboats

On a

When we shake and we shiver, 
We worm on a 
green horn, 
And book him up the river. 
For we're all, &o. 
When Yankees we hail, 
And an Irishman we greet, 
We win first his confidence, 
Exposing those we cheat. 
For we're all, &c.

Our cheating they unravel, 
But yet we show a 
stranger. 
The cheapest way to travel. 
For we're all, sLe. 
Like the rest of the world, 
We go for making tin, 
And the quicket way to do it, 
Is by sucking others in. 
MR. SIMPKIN; 
OR, THE RESURRECTION MAN. 
A 
Celebrated Comic Song, as sung by Jerry Al 
rifield, and E. M. Dickenson. 
Mr. Simpkin lived at Leeds, 
And he had a 
wife beside, 
Who always wore the breeches, 
So he thought he'd let her ride; 
She ax'd him for a 
horse, 
He yielded to her folly, 
Say's he, " I'm always mollified, 
By you my dearest Molly." 
This horse he had six legs, 
And I 
will prove it true, 
He lifted up his fore legs, 
Yet Willie stood on two; 
'Down tumbled Mrs. Simpkin, 
Her frightened spouse averred— 
" 
My lamb's as dead as mutton, 
For she docent say a 
word." 
He pop'd her in a 
coffin. 
And bade them nail it fast, 
In funeral array, 
To the Parish church they passed; 
Says Simpkin, to the church yard, 
I'll follow at my leasure, 
For why, my friends should I 
make 
A 
labour of a 
pleasure,

At night a 
resurrection man, 
Resolved a 
corpse to raise, 
With his pick- axe ope'd the coffin, 
' And at the fair did gaze; 
The noise awoke the lady, 
What in heavens name, says she, 
Are you with that axe about ? 
Why, axe about, says he. 
Away she ran, he after her, 
And to the stable hied, 
There he saw her spouse caressing, 
That horse by which she died; 
When in came neighbor Horner, 
Says he, I'll buy that beast, 
If he will do for my wife, 
As he did for the deceased. 
I 
thank you sir, said Simpkin, 
But cannot take your pelf, 
Nor sell a 
nag that promises, 
So much service to myself; 
1For though he killed my first wife, 
I 
did not feel much vexed, 
And as I 
mean to wed again, 
I'll keep him for the next. 
You dog, cried Mrs. Simpkin, 
As she seized him by the hair, 
Disown your lawful wife, now 
You willian if., 
you dare; 
I'm neither dead nor buried, 
And you must not marry, too, 
For though you buried me alive, 
I'll live to bury you.

Then turning round his head, 
Mr. Simpkin cried good lack, 
Behold the resurrection man, 
Now waiting with his sack ; 
When he asked what he wanted, 
Such a 
man and wife he said, 
Can never live together, 
So I'm waiting for the dead. 
The digger looked so grave, 
And his hints so well in season, 
Tho' told by me in rhyme, • 
Brought this loving pair to reason, 
Then Simpkin kiss'd his wife, 
I'm your's ' till death he cried, 
But when, my dearest Molly, 
Will you take another ride.

a.% sung by W. H. Williams and Jerry Merrifield. 
AIR.—" Sweet Kitty Clover." 
Billy Crow loved Miss Watson, a

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
She was not very big, but she was very kind, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
When shop was shut up, to her he would pop, 
To fetch her a 
quartern, or give her a 
drop. 
Oh sweet Billy Crow, 
What a 
nice little beau, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh: 
Says he, " Sweet Miss Vatson will you be my 
spouse, 
Oh, oh, oh, etc. 
But she coek'd down her eyes and she cocked up 
her nose, 
Oh, oh, oh, etc. 
Says she, " Do you think that I 
will marry you, 
Oh no Billy Crow, I'll be blowed if I 
do. 
Oh sweet Billy Crow, & c. 
That moment bounced in a 
tall grenadier, 
Oh, oh, oh, etc. 
Who treated Miss Vatson to muffins and beer, 
Oh, oh, oh, etc.

Till out of the window she gave him a

Then poor Billy Crow, 
Went tumbling below.

BUNDLE OF WANTS. 
A 
celebrated comic song, as sung by Tom Blakely 
and Jerry Merrifield. 
I'll sing you a 
song about wants, its a 
song you've 
been wanting of me, 
don't want to make you all sad, but I 
want I. add 
much to your glee ; 
We all of us wants have enough, through th,'.4. world 
as we travel along, 
ut my first and my greatest of wants, 4 
I 
-
Pant to 
please you with my song. 
A 
man that's in want of a 
place, you'll say that no 
fate can be worse, 
A 
man that's in want of some money, he's not much 
in want of a 
purse: 
A 
man that's in want of his teeth, had better give 
over nut cracking, 
And he that wants shoes to his feet, need'nt lay out 
his money in blacking. 
`The ladies, lord bless 'em, have wants,I hope they'll 
not take it amiss, 
Little miss wants to be fat mamma, fatmamma wants 
to be little miss; 
The old ones they want to be wed, the young ones 
to flirt with their beaux, 
And I'm certain that both old and young, have long 
been in want of new clothes. 
A man that's in want of tobacco, he cannot want 
much for a 
pipe, 
And he that's in want of a 
dinner, may want half a 
yard of fat tripe; 
The man that has corns on his toes, wants a 
smooth 
road instead of a 
rough, 
And the man that's no nose on his face, must want a 
new way to take snuff. 
The man that's in want of a 
leg, \sill make but a 
very poor runner, 
And he that's in want of an eye, will make but a 
piti. 
ful gunner; 
Our enemies wants are supplied, yankee soldiers will 
keep em retreating, 
Our generals gave 'em their wants, for they gave ' era 
a 
terrible beating.
