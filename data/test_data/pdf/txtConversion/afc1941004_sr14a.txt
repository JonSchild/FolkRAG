John Henry Faulk: Well, Mr. Brodie when did you first hear about Japan attacking the United States?
J. C. Brodie: Sunday evening.
John Henry Faulk: Well, what do you think about it? What was your reaction to it?
J. C. Brodie: I think it was an outrage.
John Henry Faulk: Do you think they had any right in the world to do it?
J. C. Brodie: I do not. We were trying to make peace with them at the time, our president was.
John Henry Faulk: And they jumped. Why do you reckon they jumped us?
J. C. Brodie: Well, I think that Germany was the cause of them jumping us if you want to know what I
think about it.
John Henry Faulk: What chance you reckon we've got of winning?
J. C. Brodie: I think that's a cinch that we'll win.
John Henry Faulk: How come?
J. C. Brodie: We're the strongest nation on earth. We've got more resources than any nation on earth.
And we're the out fightin-ist people on earth [interviewer laughs]. And don't mind doing it when the
time comes.
John Henry Faulk: Well, that's good, but they tell me that Germany's been putting up a
considerable battle too. So has Japan's been fighting [and practicing (?)] a long time in China.
J. C. Brodie: Well the Japs are fighting little nations. But they haven't enough resources, to my
opinion, to fight the United States.
John Henry Faulk: I think that's true too. And it seems like they spread out a long ways too.

J. C. Brodie: They've got too much territory to cover and my information, they haven't enough
navy to take care of it and their navy is too weak to fight the United States.
John Henry Faulk: How are they in the air, you reckon?
J. C. Brodie: That, I couldn't answer the question “how good they are in the air.” But I'll venture to say
one thing, that they won't be a match to the American people.
John Henry Faulk: I believe that, too Mr. Brodie. What good do you think the South American states,
countries are going to help? Do you reckon they're going to be any help.
J. C. Brodie: Well, I think the South American countries all going in with the United States will then cut
them off some supplies if the whole continent goes in, the twenty-one republics. And their supplies
will be so short they won't last long.
John Henry Faulk: Reckon Japan realized that when she jumped us. Reckon she knew that she was
going to be —
J. C. Brodie: I hardly think that Japan thought that the twenty-one republics would go together.
John Henry Faulk: I don't believe she did either because see that's just going to leave them
completely out over here.
J. C. Brodie: Certainly. She has no place to get her cotton or wool and where will her supplies of
ammunition come from after this is exhausted what they have on hand.
John Henry Faulk: Mm hmm [affirmative].
J. C. Brodie: Where will their gas come from when this is exhausted?
John Henry Faulk: You don't reckon Russia's going to help her do you?
J. C. Brodie: I do not. Russia, I think, will stand straight by the United States.
John Henry Faulk: I believe that too.
J. C. Brodie: ???

John Henry Faulk: Well, do you got any ideas on just why we got down to ever having this war? I
mean why Japan would ever start a war with us?
J. C. Brodie: Well, the United States, the way I understand it, demanded them to abandon their fight
on China. They're aggressive nation and the idea was with them they wanted half of China and all of
it. And when they had to give it up, they'd fight before they'd give it up.
John Henry Faulk: And they just realized the United States wasn't taking more foolishness.
J. C. Brodie: They talked peace so long until they seen there's no room for peace. It was either fight or
back up.
John Henry Faulk: Do you reckon they'll try to attack us here at the United States? Reckon that they'll
try to get on the mainland?
J. C. Brodie: I don't think so.
John Henry Faulk: You know I listened to the radio last night late, and they said that there were war
ships over in San Francisco, in the area, but I don't believe that. You don't believe the United States is
any danger of attack?
J. C. Brodie: I do not. Not from Japan
John Henry Faulk: What about Germany? Reckon she'll . . . do you reckon she's going to get in
this war? Or do you reckon she's just going to let Japan fight it out?
J. C. Brodie: Well, according to their pact, Italy and Japan and Germany is already at war with the
United States.
John Henry Faulk: I didn't know they would fight with Japan just —
J. C. Brodie: Well, they make an agreement that if one was attacked the other would be a partner.
That's what they've already —
John Henry Faulk: Yeah, but Japan hasn't been attacked, Japan did the attack against us.
J. C. Brodie: I understand she did the attacking, but didn't you listen last night on the radio, that they
had one of the big German airplane men over there conducting their air raids for her?

John Henry Faulk: No, I didn't hear that. Did you hear that?
J. C. Brodie: Yeah, they're doing that.
Unidentified woman: No, I didn't hear that.
J. C. Brodie: Sure.
John Henry Faulk: Oh well, that's bad then. That's going to make a circle of gold ???.
J. C. Brodie: And all of Hitler's countries that he's attacked and taken was attacked on a Sunday
morning. And Germany, in my opinion, has ram-rodded this thing all the way through and attacked
it on a Sunday morning when they knew it would be a quiet morning. And lots of the men out at
church or off looking around or something at the time.
John Henry Faulk: Weren't expecting it.
J. C. Brodie: Wasn't expecting attack.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, that was German, Germany had a hand in them this?
J. C. Brodie: Germany, I think was in the [thick (?)] of it.
John Henry Faulk: Well, do you . . . ready to see the United States through, huh? Ready to see her
fight it to the last Jap?
J. C. Brodie: Yes. I'm sixty-seven years old and if they need me I'll go up front.
John Henry Faulk: Good, well that's the way to talk. I believe most of America feels that way now
since the United States has been attacked.
J. C. Brodie: I believe that ninety percent of the people in the United States are wholehearted to win
the war. That's what I think.
John Henry Faulk: And I believe we've got the foodstuff and the ammunition and everything else it's
going to take.
J. C. Brodie: We can produce anything we need for ???.
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr14
Unidentified woman: Mm hmm [affirmative].
J. C. Brodie: As far as food's concerned, fighting's concerned, wool's concerned, and manufacturers is
concerned, and the United States has ample of everything.
John Henry Faulk: Yeah, I don't believe that they can . . . I don't know what Japan can do about
holding out against us in the face of all that. They're cut off from most of their supplies ???
J. C. Brodie: Well, I wouldn't imagine that China or Japan or any of her allies have anything to send
her in the way of needing.
John Henry Faulk: Mm mm [negative]. ??? I don't know what she's going to do about oil now.
Unidentified woman: [unintelligible question]
John Henry Faulk: Yeah, we've been supplying them with oil.
J. C. Brodie: Mexico has too.
John Henry Faulk: She's quit.
J. C. Brodie: She's quit, she's an ally of the United States. If they can't capture oil in some other region
over there to draw from I don't know where it could come from.
Unidentified woman: [unintelligible question]
J. C. Brodie: I think so.
John Henry Faulk: Sure.
