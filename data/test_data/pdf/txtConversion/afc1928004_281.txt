LET ERIN REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD. 
BY 
TO31 Moor.E. 
Am.—" The Red Fox." 
LET Erin remember the days of old, 
Ere her faithless sons betray d 
her ; 
When Malachi wore a 
collar of gold ;* 
Which he won front her proud invader, 
When her kings, with standard of green unfurPd, 
Led the Red- Branch Knightst to danger, 
Ere the emerald gem of the western world 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
On Lourrh Neagh's bankf as the fisherman strays, 
When the clear, cold eve's declining, 
IIe sees the round towers of other days 
In the wave beneath him shining ; 
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpFe of the days that are over ; 
Thus, sighing, look throuot the waves of time 
For the long faded (dories they cover. 
* " This brought on an encounter between Malachi ( the monarch of Ire-
land in the tenth century) and the Danes, in which Malachi defeated two 
of their champions, whom he encountered successively, hand to hand, tak-
ing a 
collar of gold from the neck of one, and carrying off the sword of the 
other, as trophies of his victory."— Warner's History of Ireland, Vol. 1., 
Book 9. 
t " Military orders of knights were very early established in Ireland ; 
long before the birth of Christ we find a 
hereditary order of chivalry in 
Ulster, called Curaidhe na Cramblie ruadh, or the ' Knights of the Red 
Branch,' from their chief seat in Einanirt, adjoining to the palace of the 
Ulster kin, called Teagh na Craoilthe ruadh, or the Academy of the Red 
Branch ;' and contiguous to which was a large hospital, founded for the 
sick knights and soldiers, called Bron-bhearg, or the Rouse of the Sorrow-
ful Soldier.' "- 0' Halloran's In'roduetion, etc., Part I., Chap. 5. 
The inscription upon Connor's tomb ( for the fac-similki of which I 
am 
indebted to Mr. Murphy, chaplain of the late Lady Moira) has not, I 
be-
lieve, been noticed by any antiquari i's or traveller. 
Translation of an ancient Irish inscription upon a 
tombstone in the 
abbey of Multifernon, county of Westmeath, Ireland: 
A yellow lion upon green satin, 
The standard of the heroes of the Red Branch, 
Which Connor carried in battle, 
During his frequent wars for the expulsion of foreigners. 
# 
It was an old tradition, in the time of Giraldus, that Lough Neagh 
had been originally a 
fountain, be whose sadden overflowing the country 
was inundated, and it whole region, like the At Mullis o, P 
ato, ovm'whelm-
ed. 
lie says that the lisherruen, in clear weather, used to point out to 
strangers the tall ecelesiastie.il tow- rs under w,tter: " Pke•Itorf•A aqua° 
Mitts turres ecelesiasticas. qum more patrice trctm soot •- t 
ilta. neenon, of 
rotundre, sub undis manifesto, sereno ternpore conspiciunt, et extranms

c. 9.

Words by GEO. COI:11'BU. 
Am.—" Fat Molloy." 
THERE was a 
brave young Irish lad, the pride of all the land, 
For dancing and for rattling sport the chief of all the band ; 
The girls they smiled upon him, too, and sighed when he pass-
ed by, 
And shyly glanced upon him from the corner of their eye! 
Unto his master, leal, and true he never swerved an inch, 
A 
noble friend he proved to be at each unlucky pinch , 
Ho followed him beyond the sea when tyrarny was rife, 
This darling boy would save him, and would shield him with 
his life I 
cnorms. 
Am.—Chorus of " Ile3ular Army, 0." 
Then it's hip hurrah for Irish lads and dear old Ireland, too ; 
Their hearts are kind— you'll always find them generous and 
true! 
For their native land they'll bravely fight, and everywhere they 
fro 
They charm the girls, and boldly deal destruction to the foe. 
Ant.—" Cruiskin Lawn." 
When the Shaughraun's master came 
To green Erin's laud of fame, 
From the perils of prison so drear, 
The priest so good and kind 
Sheltered him where none could find, 
And this noble Irish lad was ever near. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
But when prison walls so cold 
Did his master's form enfold, 
To the rescue so nobly he sped; 
No bolts and bars can bind 
Those who fight for home, you'll find, 
And the hirelings found an empty cage instead. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
Am.—" Killarney." 
Love had won the Shaughraun's heart, 
Pierced it with a 
fatal dart ! 
From his girl he ne'er could part 
Till the life within had flown ; 
Her's the smile that shone afar 
Like the lovely morning star, 
(1) 
THE SHAUGHGRAUINT.—Continuod. 
Never grief her beauty mar 
Till he claims her for his own ! 
Angels were not half so bright; 
Oh, his dreams were sweet delight ! 
She his vision day and night, 
Pride of dear Killarney. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
Am.—" Tim Finnegan's Wake." 
But when they all thought the Shaughraun dead, 
A 
handsome " waking " they gave to him, 
And they laid him upon a 
feather bed; 
There was Mickey and Pat and Ted and Tim! 
And the whiskey it flowed in the sweetest way, 
And the ructions and dancing at once began, I, 
And there wasn't one that knew that day 
That Conn was a 
real " live " Irishman. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 7 
Banjo Solo by ED. HARRIGAN. 
I'LL sing of my girl, my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, \ 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash-tub she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town;-, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear, 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts down at the people. 
A 
rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, 
The gal wid the injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher : es now den I'll tie her ; 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she popped 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud atAl went cut of sight, 
To net into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jmnp, at every thump 
She got on da.t big rubber bustle.

I'M NOT MYSELF AT ALL. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
Oh ! I'm not myself at all, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
I'm not myself at all. 
Nothing caring, nothing knowing, 'tis after you I'm going, 
Faith your shadow 'tis l'm growing, Molly dear. Molly dear, 
And I'm not myself at all. 
Th'other day I 
went confessin' and I 
asked the father's blessin' 
But says I, " don't give me one entirely, 
For I 
fretted so last year, 
But the half o' me is here, 
So give the other half to Molly Briefly ; 
Oh ! I'm not myself at all." 
Oh ! Pm not myself at all, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
My appetite's so small, 
I 
once could pick a 
goose, but my buttons is no use. 
Faith my tightest coat is loose, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
And I'm not myself at all. 
If thus it is I 
waste, you'd better dear make haste, 
Before your lover's gene away entirely 
If you dont soon change your mind, 
Not a 
bit of me you'll find. 
And what ' rid you think o' that, Molly Brierly ? 
Oh, I'm not myself at all. 
Oh I 
my shadow on the wall, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Isn't like myself at all. 
For I've got so very thin, myself says ' tisn't him, 
But that purty girl so slim, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
And I'm not mysAt at all. 
If thus I 
cmaller grow, all fretting dear for you, 
'Tis you should make me up the deficiency, 
So just let Father Taaf 
Make you my better half, 
And you will not the worse for the addition be ; 
Oh, l'm not myself at all. 
I'll be not myself at all, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Till you my own I 
call, 
Since a change o'er me there came, sure you might change, 
your name, 
And ' twould just come to the same, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Oh I 'twould just come to the same ; 
For if you and I 
were one, all confusion would be gone, 
And ' twould simplify the mather entirely, 
And 'twould save us so much bother, 
When we'd both be one another, 
So Jisten now to rayson Molly Brierly ; 
Oh 
not toyesil at ru.

THE RISING OF THE MOON. 
This song, which is the production of John B. Casey, " the 
Galtee ii y," who was an inmate of an English dungeon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the West, where it is 
often made the marching tune of bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of '98. 
It is sung to 
the Air of " Wearing of the Green ;" 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrel, tell mewhere you hurry so? 
Hush, ma bouchal! hush and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CITOItt'S. 
By the rising of the Moon. by the rising of the moon: 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain : get you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be ? 
In the mild spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word more: for signal-token, whistle up the marchin' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Out from many a mud-wall cabin, eyes were watching 
the night, 
Many a 
manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
light; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the risin, of the Moon. 
By the rising of the 'Moon, &c. 
Down along yon singing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
High above their shining weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death to every foe and traitor! forward! strike the marehin' 
tune! 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! 'tis the rising of the Moon. 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate ; 
Oh! what glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eight I 
But yet, thank God, there's beating hearts in manhood's burn-
ing-noon, 
Who will follow in their footsteps by the rising of the Moon.

In his bat good Saint Patrick used always to wear 
The Shamrock whenever he went to the fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt, highly priz'd 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguisq: 
For the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedeck'd by the Shamrock of Old Ireland; 
There's a 
charm that no Irishman's heart can withstand, 
In the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green, 
That grow like two twins on the bogs and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my eye that with joy my heart fills ; 
And I've bless'd the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland; 
There's a 
charm that no Irishman's heart can withstand, 
In the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

CROOS-Irv'EN LAWN,. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman does his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet scented lawn, 
While I, more blest than they, 
Spend each happy night and day 
With my smiling little Croos-keen lawn, lawn, lawn* 
Oh, my smiling little Croos-keen lawn. 
Leante ruma Croos-keen, 
Sleante gar ma voor meh neen 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban, ban, ban, 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban. 
In court with manly grace, 
Should Sir Toby plade his case, 
And the merits of his cause make known, 
Without his cheerful glass, 
he'd be stupid as an ass, 
So he takes a 
little Cross-keen lawn. 
Leante ream, &o. 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Let's not part with lips so dry, 
Though the lark should proclaim it is dawn 
But if we can't remain, 
May we shortly meet again, 
To fill another Croos-keen lawn. 
Leante rurna, &a. 
And when grim death appears. 
After few but happy years, 
And tells me my glass it is run, run, run,

'LONGSHOREMAN'S STRIKE; OR, THE POOR 
MAN'S FAMILY. 
Words by ED. W ARBIGAN. 
Music by DAVID ERAIIA.M. 
Sung by ED. HAREIGAS, in his side-splitting sketch, " Raffle for a 
Clock." 
Oxi ! 
I 
am a 
simple, laboring man, 
I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling sun 
On the ships that come from sea; 
From broad daylight till late at night, 
For a 
poor man's family. 
ClIODUS. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh! the rich one's gilded carriages 
And horses swift and strong, 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he is wrong ; 
Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, etc. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South; 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths. 
The white man's children they must starve; 
Shure we will not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our 'family. 
Give us, etc. 
PAT MALONY'S FAMILY. 
Written and sun by ED. HARRIGAN in ILtmunAN & I.LenT's sketch, 
" 
Who owns the Line?" 
Mu name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgins, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed my family. 
CHORUS. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And her sister, 
And her brother-
1700 babies laying on their knees. 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozens, 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof, 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, , 
Root- beer by the pail; 
I'd have to wait till they were full 
Before pa git me male.

There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you bust a 
butt,On,i. 
And a 
fiery- headed Corkonian, 
By the name of Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable, 
While they ate up'all the labor of Patrick Malony. 
PAT' MALONY'S FAMILY.—concluded. 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor, 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue; 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew.

There's her nephews 
And her nieces, 
That come from several places ; 
1700 .-gandmothers 
And mothers-in-law you see ; 
A 
wagon load of Dalys; 
McSweegan and the Halys 
...Lived on the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
There's her second cousin's brother, 
And his toothless old step- mother, 
And 1600 emigrants from Ireland you see, 
Wid their boxes and their bedding, 
On my ingrain carpet treading, 
They lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
CHORUS. 
There's the Dra.tlys 
And the Gradys— 
Dacent, perfect ladies, 
Always axing charity 
From my family you see. 
One husband was a 
loafer, 
The other was a 
toper, 
Depending on the friendship of Patrick Malony.

SAINT PATmcK was a 
gentleman, 
sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade.

We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed ; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march still' as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
lied break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we no, 
Up Broadway through - rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And thotprb I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer ; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat ; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Thol two by two awn ,

Up Broadway through rain or snow ;

MURPHY'S LITTLE BACK ROOM. 
Original by ED. MatractAN. 
Ant.—" Pat Roach." 
DID you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy 
He came from the County Mayo; 
He kept a 
bar-ror in this city, 
in a 
Democratic ward here below; 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call I 
rishtown. 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents; 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy 
He often gave me two for one; 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whiskey, his beer, and rum ; 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand off the flure wid a 
broom; 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, entailers; and riggers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard; 
Shovelmen, pipemen, and drivers, 
_ Who worked on the big boulevard; 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Wid a 
fiddler to play up a 
tune, 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade; 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels, and glasses ; 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they wint, 
And poor Teddy, without provocation, 
To the Island for ten days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence 
in the courts and the grand committee; 
lie sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk, and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore; 
He c_fot a 
cramp in his leg and his stomach; 
lin sank w visa up no more.

Or lonely wait in Z 
hero for yon— 
While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they have nothing else to do. 
The dowers late were open keeping, 
To try a 
rival blush with you, 
But their mother, Nature, kept them sleeping, 
With their rosy faces washed in dew. 
0, Molly, &c. 
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, dear, 
And the pretty stars were made to shine; 
The pretty girls were made for the boys, dear, 
And maybe you were made for mine. 
The wicked watch dog here is snarling— 
He takes me for a 
thief, (rye see 
For he knows I'd steal you. Molly. darling, 
And then transported I

THE LASS OF GOWRIE. 
'Twas on a 
simmer's afternoon, 
A wee before the sun geed down, 
My lassie wi a braw new gown, 
Came o 'er the bill to Gowrie. 
The rosebud tine'd wi' morning show'r 
Bloom'd fresh within the sunnio bow'r. 
But Kitty was the fairest flow'r 
That ever bloom'd in Gowrie. 
I 
had nae thought to (10 her wrong, 
But round her waist my arms I 
hang, 
And said, " My lassie, will ye gang 
To view the Carse o' Gowrie 
I'll take you to my father's ha' 
In yon green field beside the shaw, 
And make ye lady o' them a'— 
The brawest wife in Gowrie 1" 
Soft kisses on her lips I 
laid, 
The blush upon her cheek soon spread, 
She whisper'd modestly, and sail; 
" 
I'll .gam, wi' ye to Gowrie !" 
The alibi folks soon gae(l their consent, 
And to Mess John we quickly went, 
-Wirt tied us to our hearts' content 
And now she's Lady Gowrie!

It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen ; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore—

relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray ; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballytnore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore.

And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore.

THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of HARRIGAN and H ART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED H ARRIGAN, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Longress, at Washington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by HARRIGAN and H ART, with Mantel:Ise success, at the 
Theatre Lomique, New York. 
W E crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A Tipperary man— 
lie carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
ClIORUS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd Liet home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep ; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard ; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
Wo shouldered, ete. 
S.A.TTY AVOURNEEN. 
'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the tempest was marlins, 
The snow like a 
sheet covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to his darlin'. 
And tapped at the window where Katty did lie. 
" 
Arrah, jewel," said he, are ye sleepin' or wakin' ? 
The night's bitter cold, an' my coat it is thin; 
Oh, the storm ' tis a 
brewin', the frost it is bakin', 
Oh, Katty Avourneen, you must let me in. 
Arrah, Barney, cried she, and she spoke thro' the window, 
Ah, would ye be takin' me out of my bed ? 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too; 
It's whiskey, not love, that's got into your head, 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be tender; 
Consider the time and there's nobody in, 
Oh, what has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her; 
No, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in. 
Ah, cushla, cried he, it's my heart is a 
fountain 
That weeps for the wrong I 
might lay at your door; 
Your name is more white than the snow on the mountain 
And Barney would die to preserve it as pure; 
I'll go to my home, though the winter winds face me, 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within ; 
An' the words of my Kathleen will .comfort and bless me: 
Oh, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in 
HER BRIGHT SMILE HAUNTS ME STILL. 
Ms years since last we met, and we may not meet again; 
I 
have struggled to forget, but that struggle was in vain. 
For, her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at will; 
In the midnight on tit_ 
her bright smile haunts me still. 
At the first sweet dawn of light, when I 
gaze upon the deep, 
Her form still greets my sight, while the stars their vigil!, 
keep. 
When I 
close mine aching eyes, sweet dreams my senses fill ; 
And, from sleep when I 
arise, her bright smile haunts me still. 
I 
have sailed 'neath alien skies, I 
have trod the desert path; 
I 
have seen the storm arise like a 
giant in his wrath. 
Every danger I 
have known, that a 
reckless life can fill ; 
Yut her preeenee is net flown, hcr bright innilo haunts motlL 
rxramixa.

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh !" 
I 
never shall forget the day.I started for to go 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
"G;" 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more, 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the 
floor! 
We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
CHOR 
US. 
" 
Lift! 
Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
" 
Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it I 
Turn yer head this way ! 
Right about! 
Shoulder arms!" 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very diffikilt to kape the step at all 
Along wid all the others whin paradin in the Hall: 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
" 
Ver as awkward as the diril; doan't ye hould yer goon that 
way!" 
Whine'er he'd .spake an ordher but egad ! ' twas wid a 
vim ; 
I 
often wish'd, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we will plod, 
Shouldhcr arms, and counter marchin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid; 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift I Lift!" etc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make ' em feel me vingeance, all the sargints under me! 
have ' em marchin ) ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retallyate or give me any talk, 
I'll rejuce thim to the ranks at wanst, and there I'll make 'em 
walk ! 
If that ain't punishment enough " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift!" etc.

As sung by BARNEY THE G

Oh I 
sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night, 
And the voice of the nightingale singing his tune, 
While the stars seem to smile with delight. 
Old path*, .ow lingers in silent repose, 
And tee sweet breath of summer is calm, 
While I 
sit and wonder if Shamus e'er knows 
flow sad and unhappy I 
am 
CHORUS. 
Oh l 
Shamus O'Brien, why don't you come home, 
You don't how know happy I'll be; 
I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with tuei 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me? 
Oh! why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free! 
Oh 1 
Shamus O'Brien, elc, 
Oh; Shamus O'Brien, I'm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do ; 
If you'll bring it to me, I•11 mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

THE WHISTLING THIEF. 
'When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, his signal was to be. 
Oh! Mary, the mother cried, there's some one whistling sum, 
Oh! Mother, you know, it's the wind that's whistling througN 
the door. 
(Whistles: Garry Owen.) 
,I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that, I 
never yet did hear. 
But, mother, you know, the fiddle hangs dose behind the chink, 
And the wind upon the strings is playing a 
tune, I 
think. 
(Dog barks.) 
The dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play that tune. 
But, Mother, you know that dogs will bark, when they see the 
moon. 
Now, how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind? 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
(Pig grunts.) 
And now there is the pig uneasy in his mind. 
But, Mother, you know, they say that pigs can see the wind. 
That's all very well in the day, but then I 
may remark 
That pigs, no more than we, can see anything in the dark. 
Now, I'm not such a 
fool as you think, I 
know very well it is 
Pat, 
Get out! you whistling thief, and get along home out o' that. 
And you, be off to your bed, and don't bother me with your 
tears; 
For, tho' I've lost my eyes, I 
have not lost my ears. 
MORAL. 
Now, Boys, too near the house don't courting go, d'ye mind ? 
'Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can; 
They're sure to tell the difference 'twixt wind, fiddle, pig, dos,. 
or man.

No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, 
No Briton bolder 'midst danger or scar; 
He's slightly, he's lightly, he's as clear as the fountain, 
His eyes twinkling love, and he's gone to the war.

The dull screaming owl shall cease its night's sleep, 
While seeking lone walks in the shades of the evening,

Or some cruel goddess has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here, a 
dear Irish maid.

[The circumstance, which gave rise to this beautiful ballad, occurred 
• 
during the visit of a 
friend of the author to the north of Ireland, and 
was most feelingly related to the author by him. 
It was the parting of a 
young tenant-farmer from his betrothed, on going to seek his fortune 
In some distant land.] 
Oh! leave not your Kathleen, there's no one can cheer her, 
Alone in the wide world, uupitied she'll sigh: 
And scenes that were loveliest, when thou wert but near her, 
Recall the sad visions of days long gone by! 
'Tis vain that you tell me: you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'cr return more: 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh! 
Oh! leave not the land, the sweet land of your childhood, 
Where joyously passed the first days of our youth, 
Where gaily we wandered ' mid valley and wildwood: 
Oh! those were the bright days of innocent truth! 
'Tis vain that you tell me ; you'll never forget me : 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more 
Par away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, aid Erin Co Bragh

PADDY MAGEE; 
OR, THE THREE DREAMS. 
John Bull, he was an Englishman, and he went on tramp one 
day, 
With three pence in his pocket, to carry him on his way; 
lb travellel for miles and wiles and no one did he see, 
Till he fell in with an Irishman by the name of Paddy Magee. 
" 
Good morning,' says John Bull, " Good morning, sir," says 
Pat, 
"Where are you going?" says Johnny; " I'm on the road, that's 
flat." 
"have you any money about you 
says Johnny unto Pat, 
"It's the only thing I 
wanted, for I 
have not got a 
rap.'' 
They trudged along together, met a 
Seotelanan on their way, 
" 
Oh, lend us a 
bob, now, Scotty, to help us on our way ;" 
" 
Lend you a 
bob," said Scotty, " faith and sure," said he, 
It s 
the only thing I 
wanted, for I'm not worth a 
bawbee." 
"I have three pence," said the Englishman ; " what shall I 
do 
with that?" 
1' 
Oh, buy three pen'orth of whiskey, it will cheer us up," said 
Pat. 
" 
Don't do that," said the Scotchman, " Ill tell you what to do, 
Buy three pen'orth of oatmeal, and we'll all of us have burgoo." 
"Now with my three-pence," said the Englishman, " hal_-qnar 
tern loaf, what say ? 
And in yonder haystack we'll sleep all hunger away •, 
We can quench our thirst by the running brook, beside the broil-
inn• stream. 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning who dreams the largest 
dream.' 
John Bull he dreamed by the morning that ten thousand men 
had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, the largest ever was seen, 
At last they got this turnip up by working night and day, 
And it took five thous:and horses to draw this turnip away. 
Now, the Scotehman he dreamt by the morning ten thousand 
men had been 
For ten years making a 
boll-T, file largest ever was seen ; 
" 
What was it made of ?" said the Englishman, " was it made 
of copper or tin ?" 
Said Scotty, " "Twas made of copper, to boil your turnip in." 
"Blood and 'ounds," said the Irishman, " I've been drawing a 
very big &ante, 
I 
dreamt I 
was in a 
haystack, beside of a 
broiling strame ; 
I 
dreamt you, I, and Scotty was there, ' tis true or I'm an 'oaf, 
I 
dreamt that I 
was hungry—so I 
got up and ate the loaf" 
PADDY CAREY. 
'Twas at the town of nate Clogheen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A claner boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare I 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies, 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddlng, limping, squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
cuifitt:s. 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavolt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt I 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies toy, 
Nimble- footed, black-eyed, rosy-checked, 
Curly-headed Paddy parey ! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary, 
A shilling slipped, so nate and elane, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Cttrey I 
Tight and sound—strong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, drinking, drumming, 
Light, tight and airy_ 
All the sweet faces, eLc. 
The sowls wept loud, the crowd was great, 
When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she w 
as crippled in her gait, 
Her brawny arms clasped Pally Carey I 
" 
Och ! Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
Here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
Says Pat, " You sowl 
do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle tltrows— 
Leering, tittering, jeering, frittering, 
Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, &a. 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the ups of Mistress Leary, 
And mounting straight a 
large cockade, 
In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey; 
He grateful praised her shape, her back, 
To ethers like a 
dromedary ; 
Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey! 
Nate and sweet, no alloy— 
All complete—love and joy. 
Ranting, roaring, soft adoring, 
Dear Widow Leary!

A

And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away !

He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
lie won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nialits and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he r.-,ade it pay ; 
But for such a 
place he was too great,

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. — Continued. 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
his mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
He was great, etc. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his Lead down to his feet ; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display ; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc.. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darliu' man ; 
But now they're left alone, poor things: 
They weep and wail. and say— 
Oh what'll we do at all, at all 
Mulcahy's gone away!

TSOWLD SOJER BOY. 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowing, 
Like that from glory growiti ,r, for a 
Bowld Sojer Boy 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe. 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march thro', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry My eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bowld Sojer Boy 
But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout, 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer By. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in desptir, tear their hair, 
But the devit a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is ',11 before us, where the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refu& lo score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
'Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy.' 
Then come along with me, Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with 3 
our Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, 'twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
And ' tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of rur mutual love and joy. 
lklay his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line hell 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy.

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE TIIE APPLE PRAMS GROW 
Ply name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know, 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh! I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, d-- c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow I 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry I 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh ! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, ctc. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go: 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found.

Tirrl EXILE OF ERIN. 
There came to to the beach a 
poor exile of Erin. 
The dew on his robe was heavy and chill ; 
For his country lie sighe 1 
when at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
Bum the day- star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
For, it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
Where once, in the flow of 
youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go bragh. 
Oh ! sad is my fate, sr.id the heart-broken stranger, 
The wild deer and wolf to a c 
verm can flee, 
But I 
have no refuge front famine or danger, 
A Imme and a 
country rename not for me! 
Al, ! never again, in the green shady Lower 
Where my toretatkers lived, shall I 
spend mime sweet houn 
Or cover my harp Nvith the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike the sweet numbors of Erin go braghl 
Oh, Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken, 
In dreams I 
revisit thy sea-beaten al ore ; 
But, alas ! in kt far foreign lard I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more; 
And thou, cruel Fame wilt thou never replace me 
In a 
mansion of peace, where no perils can chase me 1 
! 
nevi r 
again shall my brothers embrace me! 
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.

That dear little plant still grows in our land,

Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin ; 
Whose smiles can bewitch and whose eyes can command 
In each climate they ever appear in. 
For they shine thro' the bo ,,, 
thro' the brake, and the mireland„ 
Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland t 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland.

Words by ED. ILARIIIGAN. 
Music by DAVID BILAISA.11. 
TIIREr. years ago this very day 
We went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon. 
In true military style. 
Seventeen American dollars 
Each month we surely get 
For to carry a 
gun and bagnetts 
With a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going 
To the army or to jail ; 
Or it's up the Hudson river 
With a " copper " take a 
sail; 
Oh, we puckered up our courage, 
Wid bravery we did go; 
Oh, we cursed the day we went away 
Wid the Regular Army 0! 
CHORUS. 
There was Sergeant John McCairery 
And Captain D:mahue ; 
Oh, they make us march and toe the mark, 
In gallant Company `• 
Oh, the drums would roll, upon my soul 
This is the style we'd go 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
in the Regular Army 0! 
We whit to Arizony 
For to fight the Injins there ; 
We came near being made bald-headed, 
But they nev7r got our hair ; 
We lay amon3-, the ditches. 
In the yellow 4irty mud, 
And we never saw an onion, 
A 
turnip, or a 
spud. 
(1) 
THE REGULAR ARMY 0 !—Continued. 
Oh, we were taken prisoners, 
Conveyed fornist the chafe; 
Oh, he said we'll make an Irish stew, 
The dirty Indian thafe. 
On the telegraphic wire 
We walked to Mexico; 
We blessed the day we skipped away 
From the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've been dry as army herrings, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk ; 
Oh, the boys along the street cry out, 
" 
SoE,ter, would you work ?" 
We'd ship into the navy 
For to plow the raging sea, 
But cold water sure we couldn't endure, 
'Twould never agree wid me. 
Well join the politicians, 
Then we know we'll be well fed ; 
Oh, we'll sleer no more upon the ground, 
But in a 
feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, 
They call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes 
For the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, 
And bunions on our toes ; 
For lugging a 
gun in the red hot sun 
Puts freckles on your nose. 
Enaland has its Grenadiers, 
France has its Zoo- zoos, 
The U. S. A. never changes they say, 
But continually wear the blues. 
When we are out upon parade, 
We must have our muskets brio-1t, 
Or they'll slap us in the guar(-house 
To pass away the night ; 
And whin we want a 
furlough, 
To the Colonel we do go; 
He says, go to bed, and \wait till you're dead, 
Tu the Regular Army 0 
I 
nnlere wes. etc. 
As Sung by JOHNNY LOACH. 
• 
0! have you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to- day ; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning„ 
Their dear old land to see ; 
And 3-on and me, roust ready be, 
To strike for Eberty. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And well every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore ; 
And t' e 
dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more. 
And the tune well play, shall be Patrick's day 
And we'll play it o'er and 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more 
We have begged of Englanu long, my boy; 
But now we'll leg no more ; 
No more like prowling. hounds we'll crawl, 
Around our ranger's door. 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And . -oon well strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low,

Oh ! 
Erin my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills anl thy mountains I 
once called my own • 
Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! " Cushla Maehree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin ! Erin I 
my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since last tirrie we met. 
But lived I

The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone.

Dear home of my youth, I

But memory treasures the bright days of yore : 
And my heart's latest wish the last sigh of my break, 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the land of the west.

IIILLARNEY.—[CoNcLumm.1 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh ; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Timgh and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder Etat that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such brigi.t and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or bespriuts ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's f.'own away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were mere fait : 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charinful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tiage the el ) ul-wreaths in that sit7, 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
&lancing back soft light divine : 
Beauty's home, 
Ever fair Ellarney, 
I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming? 
I'd die if I 
thought ' t 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears dowr my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing! 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, ' Norab, child, what is your ailing?"' 
But all I 
aould utter was " Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As ntre a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheers-, 
Since I 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready? 
The moment had come when my love must depart; 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy ! " 
'With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart. 
He said ' twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
Bat what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest 'and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal.

THE IRISH DUEL. 
Potatoes crow in Limerick, and beef at, Billymore, -
And buttermilk is beautiful— but that 
on knew before : 
And Irish:hen love pretty girls and none could lore more true, 
Than little Paddy Wbackmacrack, lov'd Katy Donahue, 
With his fal de ral, &c. 
Now Katy was as neat a 
lass a4 ever tripped the sod, 
And Paddy bore .vith equal grace, a 
musket or a 
lund: 
With trotyel,and ty,tk bayonet, bv turns the hero chose, 
To build up house- tor his friends, and then to charge his foes. 
With his fal de ral, dzo. 
When gentle people fall in love, Love's never at a 
loss 
To find some ugly customers their happiness to cross; 
And Patti :‘ -, too, some tronble found, all from a 
viva. swain, 
Who kept the La. and Cucumber in Cauliflower lane. 
With his fal de ral, & c. 
This youth was named Mackirkincroft, a 
very dapper elf. 
Whose clothes they fitted nately. for he made them all himself 
A tailor hale be was bv trade, of natty boys the lo-th, 
Because he always cut h s 
coat according to his cloth. 
With his fal de ral, & c. 
Bat Paddy knew the feelings of a 
gent'eman it hurts, 
To find az:0th r 
unl.:tenteelv sticking to his skirts: 
So sent a 
clialleng,e without tear, for though he 
as not rich, 
He callld himself a 
gintleman, anti still behaved as sine. 
With his fal de ral, ecc. 
Mackirky. too good manners knew, for he. as it appears. 
To Paddy wrote f leave that he mioht cult 
if both his ears: 
Save Pat to that, in style polite, as we 1 
Voll may suppose, 
" 
My ears you're very welcome to, but first I'll pull your nose." 
With his fal de : al, & c. 
The when and where were settled fair, when Pat, as bold as brass. 
Cried. •' yon kno y 
what Nve figbt about 
Mak irky cried, " alas!" 
And then in haste. and not to waste such very precious tints, 
One primed without a

IT
THE BELLS OP SEAN 
DON. 
Composed by FATHER PROCT. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sound so wild would, in days of efillctiod, 
Fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, whereer I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, oY' 
With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound. so grand. on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime IN 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate; 
But all their music spoke not like thine! 
For meniry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling- its bold notes free, 
Made the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river tee. 
I've heard. bells tolling old Adrian's mole In— 
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
And. cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
But thy sounds were sweeter than the dome 01 Fete 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly--
Oh! the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Xoske, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud in air calls men to prayer. 
From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
such an empty phantom I 
freely grant them: 
But there's an anthem more dear to me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee!

ETHIOPIAN AND COMIC DRAMA, 
PRICE 15 CENTS EACH. 
The following list includes some of the most justly popular ETHIOPIAN 
DRAMATIC SKETCHES ever produced upon the boards. 
They are artistically 
constructed in plot-full of humorous incidents and laughable situations-
the characters are genuine darEeys, both in thought and expression. 
There 
is more first-rate fun in one page of these plays than a 
whole volume of 
most ( so-called) funny books. They are admirably suited for private ama-
teur performance. 
Everything is made as plain as possible, so that any of 
the pieces can be easily produced without the aid of a 
professional.
