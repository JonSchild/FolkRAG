Dear Bess:
 
I enjoyed so much talking to you and Shirley a few days ago.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the letter I wrote Alan .
.. and the
 
information in it applies to you and Shirley.
 
Alan called me yesterday evening.
 Said he was just recovering
 
from the flu and now had laryngitis.
 He seemed pleased about
 
what we are doing in regard to the "John A. Lomax Gathering".
 
He said that he has so much going on right now that needs his
 
attention, that he doesn't see how he can get to Texas on
 
February 27th, but he didn't rule it out altogether.
 He did
 
say that by next year he would like to come to Bosque County
 
and spend a few days.
 
I told him I had talked to you and Shirley.
 He was very
 
complimentary of both of you!
 He said Shirley is the story-
teller of the family and that we should make every effort to
 
get her to Meridian on February 27th.  He said you were the
 
kind of person that gets things done .
... and that you had done
 
a lot of great things in connection with your work at the
 
National Endowment for the Arts.
 It would be great if you
 
could come, too.  You seemed interested, but said you would
 
have to see what was going on around the last of February. I
 
can understand that.
 
Bess, I feel really good about this Lomax Event.
 There have
 
been several of us wanting to do something like this for a
 
number of years .
... and it is just all coming together now.
 
I
'll keep in touch with you as to our progress.
 It will be
 
really great if you and Shirley can attend.
 
Sincerely,
 
Ma

Mr. Alan Lomax
 
450 W. 41st, 6th

New York City, N.Y. 10036
 
Dear Alan:
 
The Bosque County Historical Commission wants to keep you and
 
Shirley and Bess up to date on what we are doing in regard to
 
"The John A. Lomax Gathering" in Meridian, Texas on Feb. 27, 1993.
 
You expressed to Elizabeth Torrence, Chairman of the BCHC, and
 
to me that you want us to keep our event true to the music your
 
father loved and preserved.  You can rest assured that we will
 
do that.
 
We are hoping to turn this into a yearly event.  Recognizing John
 
Lomax and honoriIg his memory is something that several of us have
 
wanted to do for a number of years.
 It is all coming together now
 
and we are excited about it!
 
The Historical Commission has recently purchased an old building
 
across from the Courthouse.  As soon as it has been renovated we
 
will move into it.
 We will have a permanent John A. Lomax Family
 
exhibit there.
 
The February 27th event has been planned by a Committee set up by
 
the Historical Commission, and has some very capable persons as its
 
leaders.
 Jo h
n and Ann Campbell are the Event Coordinators, and Bob
 
Sawyer is Entertainment Coordinator.
 
John Campbell is married to a Lomax.  His wife, Ann,  is the daughter
 
of J. T. Lomax.
 J.T. and Fern Lomax are members of our Committee.
 
I attended J. T.
 90th Birthday celebration in August!
 
Bob Sawyer has 
,a beautiful singing voice and sings the old cowboy
 
and western songs.
 He is very much interested in what you and your
 
father have done towards preserving the old songs.
 
We have a very good feeling about this "John Lomax Gathering".
 
We would love for you to attendt 
Would it be possible for you to
 
do so?
 
We do not have the money for your plane fare, but if you could get
 
to the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport we will pick you up there and get
 
you to Meridian.
 We will see that you have a place to stay and are
 
fed.
 I would love for you to stay at my place, but would understand
 
if you would prefer staying at a motel or a "Bed and Breakfast" place
 
We would want you to be co fortable.
 
Bob Sawyer is the person in this area who can keep the Lomax heritage
 
alive through the music he sings and plays.  He would really like to
 
meet you and talk to you.
 
We have located Johnny Prude, of the Prude Ranch in Fort Davis, Tex.
 
He sings "The Dying Ranger" on the LP titled "Cowboy Songs, Ballads,
 
and Cattle Calls from Texas."
 It was  recorded by your father in
 
1942 at Fort Davis.
 I
'm wondering if you might have been with your
 
father at that time and involved in the. recording of that song.
 
Mr. Prude is now 89 years old.  His grandson said,  My Granddad and
 
John Lomax were good friends.
 I
've heard my Granddad talk about
 
John Lomax all of my life."
 
John Campbell and Bob Sawyer are making plans to visit Jqhnny Prude
 
and do an oral taping (and maybe a video taping) of him.  We are
 
hoping Mr. Prude will attend the Feb. 27th event.
 
Alan, you did an outstanding job on producing the "Ameican Patchwork"
 
series.
 I loved watching it!
 I have the Cajun Music tape and have
 
ordered the other four.
 I should be getting them soon.
 I
'm looking
 
forward to your book that will be published in March.
 
Our Committee hopes to hear from you soon, saying you can attend.
 
Sincerely,
 
A

 Meridian, Texas 76665
 
March 17, 1987
 
Ms. Bess Hawes

for The Arts
 
Pennsylvania Avenue
 
Washington, D. C
.  20506
 
Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
I met your brot
r,
 a
rI,  over 4
 aro ado.
 I t
a
o  U
 i
Ii. o:i
 t
r
 
phone a few weeks ago and he suggested I write you.
 
We moved from San Antonio to Bosque County in 1985 to be closer to
 
our two daughters and their families who live in Arlington.
 I was
 
volunteer in San Antonio at the Institute of Texan Cultures for
 
eight years.
 When we moved here I wanted to do volunteer work with
 
the Bosque County Historical Commission.
 I soon discovered the
 
Historical Marker about your father, John Lomax.
 I have met J
. T.
 
Lomax, who lives in Meridian.
 
Elizabeth Torrence, President of the Bosque County Historical
 
Commission, is doing an outstanding job and puts in many volunteer
 
hours.
 I work with her on Thursdays at the Archives at the County
 
Qourthouse.  She is very interested in getting an exhibit together
 
6n the John Lomax Family and to have it on display in the Courthouse
 
lobby.
 That is why I called Alan in New York City.
 
/
e will greatly appreciate any ideas and help you can give us in
 
making this a worthwhile and interesting exhibit.
 If you have any
 
pictures or mementoes you could share with us, we will take excellent
 
care of them.
 
I am going to order the autobz
'iography of your father, "Adventures
 
of a Ballad Hunter" and some of his recordings from the Library of
 
Congress.
 I am writing your sister, Shirley Duggan, too.
 
When I talked to Alan he said, "I can small my Grandmother's biscuits
 
now."  He wanted to know if the Bosque River was running clear.
 He
 
said to let him know when we get the Exhibit together and he would
 
come down.
 That would be great if
 
you and he and other family members
 
would attend.
 
I have seen your name many times and didn't realize you  ;
ere Alan's
 
sister.
 
Hoping to near from you, I am
