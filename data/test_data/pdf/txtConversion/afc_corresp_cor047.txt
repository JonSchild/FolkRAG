Mr. Edward N. Waters Acting-Chief Division of Music Library of Congress Washington, D.

Dear Mr. Waters:
Thank you very much for the report on song La Paloma which you tell me is credited to
Sebastian Yradier.
The letter of Governor Juan de Ayala, dated 1715, which I quoted is from the unpublished
Brooks transcripts in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress. Since writing you
I have received a letter from Dr. John Swanton, copy of which is enclosed. If there is any
way that we may trace the Indian song, I will be glad to know of it.
Thanking you for your cooperation,
Sincerely yours, Carita D. Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor WPA Writers'
