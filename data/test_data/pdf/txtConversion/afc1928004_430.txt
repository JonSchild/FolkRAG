STAND BY THE POOR. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
JUST listen a 
moment I'll sing you a 
song, 
And in it some truths I'll relate, 
Just to show you how easily credit reflects 
From the poor man as well as the great. 
Working day after day through the slow, weary hours, 
With hearts often troubled and sore, 
Would it not be kindness to give him a 
lift? 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
CHORUS. 
Whenever you're anxious to do a 
good deed, 
And one that will always endure, 
Just help out your suffering neighbor in need, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
How often that poor man, with intellect grand, 
Must take a 
back seat every day ; 
While some gawkish fellow is lord of the land— 
His cash 'tis that makes the display. 
Some world-weary wretch, out seeking for alms, 
Is drove, with a 
curse, from the door; 
I 
think this is both impolite and unkind— 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
-Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
How many unfortunate beings to- night 
Without food or shelter they go, 
Are living on what we may drop from our hand; 
Let's give them a 
kiss, not a 
blow. 
'Tis only our deeds that will live when we die, 
So kindness is better, I'm sure; 
And if you believe me. between you and I. 
'Tis noble to stand by the pour. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
The wealth of our nation is earned by the hand 
That is hardened by vigor and toil; 
There in the background they're forced to stand 
Who ought to be lords of the soil. 
Let them stand hack to back in the contest of life, 
Till their hardships are fewer and fewer. 
Still struggling on in the midst of the strife, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc.

ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS AS YOU'D Virlati 
TO BE DONE BY. 
We meet with many curious folks, 
As thro' the world we roam, 
Some who are full of fun and jokes, 
While others pine and moan. 
t I 
care not AV hethel grave or gay, 
One thing we all should try, 
That is, " to do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear good will to all meat, 
It's easy, if you'll but try, 
And always " do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
Perhaps in business you've been wronged 
By some " defaulting rogue," 
For by such scamps the world is thronged, 
They long have been in vogue ; 
Don't seek revenge on such a 
wretch, 
But to forgive him try, 
And thus you " do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by.'' 
Then bear, &a., 
It' you ate rich, and some old friend 
Is " down at heel " 
nd poor, 
Well, let the bar of nature bend, 
And " open wide your door," 
To welcome him as you were wont 
"in better days gone by," 
And thus you do to him, pocr man, 
As " you'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear, Joe. 
I 
think of what I've said or sung, 
In this my song to-night, 
That I 
have proved to every one 
The glorious might of right. 
So let us all make this resolve, 
And keep it till we die, 
That is, " to do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
Then bear, tte. 
The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love. 
As sung by LULA M ORTIMOR. 
Published by E. 
11, H ARDING, 2.29 Bowery, New York. 
You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot, 
All around you :nay be ice. 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze, 
As you both gaze afar; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
:iPoKEx.—When von are in love, and sitting on some ro-
'tiaritic cliff, by the light of the moon you gaze in the girl's 
face, and imagine how much powder and rouge she has been 
putting on: and she's thinking at the same time what express-
ive eyes, how his nose turns up, and T 
think I 
should love him 
a 
little more if it was a Roman, and the moon is winking at 
you and seems to say— 
Cuo.—The man in the moon is looking, love, 
He's winking, love, he's blinking, love : 
And each little star can tell where you arc, 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, on Dover cliffs. 
A 
girl sat there with me : 
The moon above kept peepini.,, ou' 
With look of naughty glee. 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said, 
Don't be a 
timid miss. 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud 
Just one sweet little kiss. 
SPOKEN.—Not now. 
Don't you see the man ? 
What man ? 
Why, the man in the in on! 
He's laughing at us. 
But just 
one, dear! 
No. no !- 02nonus.) 
As we sat gazing at the moon. 
Like spoon ey lovers do. 
1.Iy arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two. 
hi ,;
krd the moon say to the stars, 
That pair I'll go and wed, 
And as the in on came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SP0KEx.—It was a 
dream. 
I 
was not on Dover cliff sitting 
with a 
girl by moonlirht. 
I was in bed at Brixton with a 
rushlight shining. upon me, and dreaming it was the moon, and

THE BADDERSKITES, 
Written awl sung by the great FIELDIN0%. 
WE are deserters from the army, 
Don't give it away my dear, 
I 
was Corporal in the Badderskites, 
And I 
was the Viviandlear; 
We got tired of the sarvis, 
And their durty shillin' a 
day. 
So one fine morn we tuck French lafek 
And shot for America. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's mark time, 
Throw out your chest 
And keep your eyes right, 
Left face, forward march 
To the music of the life; 
Salute your officers, 
Keep in time, 
Then retire for the night: 
it was this way we marched all ( lay, 
All in the Badderskites. 
In our regiment we had twenty, 
Five cannons and one gun, 
In our band we had a 
clarionet, 
A 
horn and a 
drum; 
Our fifer had a 
hair-lip, 
And fingered with his thumb, 
When we turned out for miles about. 
You could see the people run. 
Then it's mark time, & c.

THE BEAUTIFUL COLUMBINE. 
Written by FRED. J. 
MACKLEY for DiA3ioND and RYAN. 
I 
NE'BR can forget, last Christmas time, 
Or yet that eventful night, 
When I 
first went to see a 
pantomime, 
And fell in love at first sight; 
It was not with a 
beauty who sat in the front, 
Nor one in the boxes so fine, 
But a 
charmer so fair with long golden hair, 
A beautiful columbine. 
CHORUS. 
As light as the air she tripped round the stage, 
Oh, how I 
wished she was mine, 
And many times too, I 
felt in a 
rage, 
Through that beautiful columbine: . 
She came on with a 
bound, and looked so sweet, 
Charming, I 
meant to say, 
And the bouquets I 
had bought to throw at her feet, 
They cost me ten dollars a 
day ; 
Oh, dear, how I 
wished I 
was old pantaloon, 
And didn't I 
envy the clown, 
As round she would spin with the harlequin, 
I 
could have knocked that fellow down. 
As light as the air, etc: 
So, one night I 
waited outside the stage door. 
Whon judge to my greatest dismay, 
1 
The charmer I 
thought both fair and sixteen, 
Was forty if she was a 
day; 
And she had a 
husband, who shifted the scenes, 
And children, I 
think she said nine, 
Then smash went my hopes as well as my love, 
For that patched up old columbine. 
(Patter after 3d Verse.) 
SPOKEN.—Only imagine my feelings on ascertaining the 
creature I 
thong t 
seventeen and lovely, was fair, fat, and 
forty, with a 
husband, a 
rooster who used to throw scenery 
about. 
She had a 
face on her that looked like a 
dirty door-
mat. 
But there, Shakespeare says, " Beauty is but skin 
deep." 
It may have been so in his time, but if you got a 
bricklayer's pickaxe, and dug in her face two feet and a 
half, 
you wouldn't find the slightest vestige of beauty there, but 
after all, 
As light as air, etc.

CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
This world is but a 
bubble, there's nothing here but wee, 
hardship, toil and trouble, no in: prier where we go ; 
Do what we will, go where we may, we're never free N fter4 
care; 
For, at the best, this world is but a 
castle in the air. 
We are tossed upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
Where some get cast upon the rocks, and never get afloat 
But still we'll do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us and our castles in the air ! 
There's a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen moss 
dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native bard, 
Shakespeare; 
When first his plays came on the stage, they made the whole 
world stare, 
And yet they were composed while building castles in the air. 
If you take the words of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find each saying is so wise, each sentiment so true— 
They make you feel, while reading them, as if you had been 
there; 
Yet, the immortal Shakespeare built his castles in the air I 
The Irish had their poet, too ; they loved him well, I'm sure; 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
CASTLES IN THE AIR.—Concluded. 
Of the troubles of this world, we know he had his share, 
Dut Moore was always happy, building castles in the air. 
Ile sang the rights of Ireland, he sang agalust her wrongs, 
And maul a 
patient heart still cherishes his songs ; 
Ile bade the Irish heart rejoice, and never more despair, 
And for Ireland in the future built bright castles in the air 
And yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And through each true Scottish heart ' twill make the blood to 
thrill; 
His name was Robert Burns: yet he, too, had his care, 
When but a 
simple shepherd, building castles in the air. 
His home, a 
lowly ploughman's cot, where strife was never 
seen; 
For happy and contented lived Robert with his Jean; 
Down by the banks o' bonny Boon, near the town o' Ayr, 
Nature's poet, Bobby Burns, built castles in the air! 
And yet there is another name Americans adore, 
A 
statesman in the time of peace, a 
lion when in war ; 
With the storm on Bunker Hill, or on the Delaware, 
His genius made his soldiers build bright castles in the air. 
And, in his country's darkest hour, he bravely lead the van, 
And strived to make America the best of any land ; 
Tho' he was not a 
poet born—he planned with skill and care. 
The immortal Washington built castles in the air

DID YOU EVER FEEL THAT WAY? 
As sung by TONY P ASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A. J. Rim-
Es., in the Oflice of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
YOU'VE read no doubt a 
thousand times how people fall in love, 
Well my heart has been took prisoner by a 
little turtle dove ; 
One Sunday morn in Spring time when birds sung from each 
tree, 
'Twas then I 
saw Jemima, and it was all U. P. with me. 
SrOKEN. — Yes, the very moment she sent one of her side 
glances at me, there was such a 
queer sensation came over me, 
like—ah—like—ah, well I 
cannot explain ; but— 
CHORUS. 
I 
felt so very peculiar, my brain spun like a 
top, 
My bosom burned like pepper sauce, I 
felt so very hot, 
And then I 
felt so very cold, its the way with love they say; 
Oh, the feelings so peculiar, did you ever feel that way? 
In conversation we soon got, and walked on Si le by side, 
And my heart was tilled with gladness to see her blush with 
pride, 
I 
begged I 
might accompany and see her on the way, 
When she replied in such sweet tones, " yes, thanks, kind sir, 
you may," 
SPOKEN.—The moment she said yes, oh! 
I 
feel so very peculiar, etc. 
17 
1 
often met her after that, my own, my guiding star, 
• And now she has consented, and the time's not very far 
When two souls with but a 
single thought, two hearts that beat 
as one, 
Will be tied in such a 
knot, dear boys, not easily undone. 
SronEs.—Ever since she consented I'm always going through 
the ceremony of, will you take this woman to be your wedded 
wife ? 
And when I 
reply, yes, to myself— 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so very peculiar, my brain spins like a 
top, 
My bosom burns like pepper sauce, I 
feel so very hot, 
And then I 
feel so very cold, it's the way with love they say; 
Oh, the feelings so peculiar, did you ever feel that way ? 
The time has been appointed, invitations they are sent, 
And to have a 
glorious time, dear boys, it is my sole intent, 
I 
ani here to night on purpose, for Jemima has sent me 
To ask you all to come and join us in our wedding spree. 
SPOKEN.—Oh boys, when 1 
think about it, I 
feel a  ; well 
just _fancy yourselves the other half of a 
girl like my Jemima, 
and the father of a 
hemale boy, and a 
shemale girl, one little 
cherub on this knee pulling your nose and saying pap—papa, 
and the other little cherub on this knee pulling your hair, and 
saying dad—dada. 
Oh the thoughts of it makes Inc feel so

Jolly old cockle am I. 
Like Loyal boys we toasted the Queen, 
And drank her health too all serene! 
There were fifteen of us, I 
counted nineteen 
That's rather strange you will say, 
We drank every one's health, and then our own, 
Until every blessed bottle had flown, 
Then we gave such a 
cheer as never was known, 
With a 
Hip, hip, hip, hooray! 
• 
SPOKEN. — I 
made a 
speech, I 
said, I 
don't exactly re-
member what I 
did say I 
know I 
began it on my legs and 
finished it under the table, when some one remarked in 
reply— 
Drunk again, &c., 
I'm fond of a 
bottle of Sherry or Port, 
With that Logwood stuff— I'm not to be caught, 
Good forty years old, Hah! that's the sort! 
Now of such I'm a 
capital judge. 
Mind I 
don't turn up my nose at Brandy or Gin! 
At Whisky or Rum, I 
can do a " go in," 
o 
refuse any drink I 
consider a 
sin! 
And " Teetotalers twaddle's" all fudge! 
SPOKEN.—Talking about Teetotalers, have you seen my 
Landlady's nose ? 
She's one, and gives me notice to quit 
every week for getting— 
Drunk again, &c. 
I 
must now toddle round to number three, 
I 
wish number three would come round to me, 
For if a 
Policeman this party should see, 
That " minion" will make out a 
case! 
For since this new Licensing act's come out, 
It's not safe for a 
fellow to go much about, 
You chance to get into " cell" no do414, 
And that's not a " comfable" place. 
SPOKEN. —No, not but what I'm all right enough, it's my 
rtgs that get me into trouble, they are so abstroplopsus, 
And this is the way they serve me after sticking to ' em all 
these years, ingratitude! They're the only pair I've got et 
present or I 
wouldn't put up with it, for they will keep on 
getting— 
Drunk again, Drunk again! 
Timothy Tottle's so fond of his bottle, hic ! 
Drunk again, Drunk again! 
A 
Jolly old Cockle am I. 
Written and Sung by the 
JUST listen to our blarney, 
And what we will sing; 
We're all the way from Ireland. 
By the way of Sing Sing, 
We arrived in New York, 
On the fourth day of July, 
All the way from Cork, 
On the steamer, oh! shoo fly. 
1ST CHORUS. 
Batherchin na bocklish, 
Batherchin na bocklish, 
Batherchin na bocklish, 
Arrah mealia murden, 
Just listen to this. 
2D CHORUS. 
We feel, we feel, we feel, 
Like a 
dish of stirabout; 
We feel, we feel, we feel, 
Like a 
dish of stirabout; 
We feel, we feel, we feel, 
Like ailish of stirabout, 
Smothereti up in cream, 
In some poor hungry mouth. 
Repeat first chorus, and dance an Irish jig. 
There is lager in the air, 
I 
hear the Prussians sing, 
Napoleon's up the spout, 
King William's on the wing; 
Old Ireland's turn comes next, 
For we must have our rights, 
And make England bow to the shamrock, 
As well as the stars and stripes. 
Chorus as. before, you can. wind this up with a 
Can Can or Jig. 
THE FINE IRISH GENTS. 
It's a 
shame on the stage, how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me, 
How the people in front, will stand such insult; 
Receiving such blockheads with glee. 
If they went to old Ireland they'd find their mistake, 
For our boys and our girls are well dressed, 
In manners as well to you I 
will tell, 
For they stand in the land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For in singing, and dancing and all kinds of sport, 
And if ever to Ireland you went, 
From their heads to their toes, they all wear decent clothes, 
I 
speak of a 
true Irish gent. 
Sure they make up their faces, and look just like fools, 
And they walk like a (log with three legs, 
If they went to old Ireland, to show them such sport, 
They'd be pelted with stones and bad eggs: 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope for to see, that little Isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For in singing Szc.,

THE GIRL ACROSS THE WAY. 
I 
SUPPOSE yes all here this tune, 
It's ten thousand miles away, 
But's not the one I'm going to sing, 
For that has had it's day. 
But I'm going to tell of an Irish girl, 
Who loves me so they say, say, say, 
She's plump and fat as butter, boys, 
And she lives across the way. 
CHORUS. 
My Peg she has blue eyes, 
Her trade is making pies, 
Her cheeks is red, 
And so is her bead, 
And she hales from Dublin Bay', Bay, Bay, 
She is as thick as she is tall, 
And she wears a 
waterfall, 
She's gone on me, that's plain to see, 
My girl across the way. 
Her Father is a 
Oonnaugl. man, 
Her Mother is a 
Tip 
And she was born in Kern 
So yes see she's not a 
Mick; 
I've told yes all I 
can me boys, 
For I 
must not delay, Ha! Ha! 
For this very night I'm to be spliced, 
To this girl across the way. 
THE GRASS WIDOW, 
Sung by the original BILLY Haim 
MY true love was a 
genius born. 
A 
grand piano tuner, 
But he went away from me one day, 
Aboard the Mary Chooner, 
And left me here heart broken, 
When I 
would much sooner, 
Sonia out my old apple stand, 
I 
had upon the corner. 
CHORcS 
But his name was Pat, a 
Williamsburg chap, 
Oh would that I 
could find him, 
But he has gone away across the sea, 
I'm the girl he left behind him. 
In his stockings, he stood six feet three, 
His strength it was gigantic, 
And when he took me in his arms, 
It nearly drove me frantic, 
Bad luck to you, Tom Tapscott, 
For taking my poor darling, 
To sail the salt sea ocean far 
Far away from me. 
But his name, &c. 
I'm scudding under bare poles, 
Now my sad fate bewailing. 
Thinking of the time, alas, 
When we parted by the railing, 
But he swore upon his pocket-book, 
And on his bended knees, 
By his bulwarks, stanchions and jibbooms, 
He would be true to me. 
But his name, &o.

YOU can see I'm a

And a

And start in the costering trade, 
And.sticking to my pounds each morning,

Which enables me, you know, my boys, 
To hollow, when going my rounds.

Here's your fine strawberries, apples four a

Currants and plums, come every one, 
And taste before you buy, 
Cabbages and turniptops, celery and tomatoes, 
Onions and beans, potatoes and greens, 
It is my daily cry. 
:Now I 
am up with the lark in the Morning 
To market me and my moke do go, 
re buy my wares of the best kind, 
And then we soon trot home again, 
We have a

And zhen I

And I

Why you will soon hear me hollefing out. 
Here's your fine, ;CZ, 
The servants all Ir vew, when I

By the sound or Any voice when I

And when my goods I 
do show them, 
Bless their hearts they always do buy. 
And if to my trade, I 
do stick, boys, 
I 
know my fortune is then made, 
And then I 
can be independent, 
And give up the costeriatg trade. 
tlere's your fine, &c. 
But before I'll leave von all to-night,

MOTTO SONG. 
Music by E. D. 
GOODING. 
Words by J. B. M URPHY. 
Help yourself, 
Never depend on the aid of another, 
II 
friend or acquaintance, or uncle or brother. 
Help yourself, 
Tough though the journey up hill—rough though it be by the 
way, 
Step by step, climb with a 
will—gain something every day 
Cum-ins. 
Then never depend on another for aid, 
Work till a 
name and a 
station you've made, 
Struggle and strive and save your pelf, 
And stick to the motto of help yourself. 
Help yourself, 
Tho' a 
friend in need is a 
friend indeed, 
Yet friends seldom help other friends to succeed. 
Help yourself, 
Blot the word fail from your book—make it the rule to succeed, 
Do it by hook or by crook, if honor but sanction the deed. 
Then never, 
c. 
Help yourself. 
Thousands who do it succeed every day, 
Thousands who won't do it fall by the way. 
Help yourself, 
Strike the air line of success; keep it as long as you can, 
Use the word "will" for "I 
guess," and be every inch of a 
man. 
LAST CHORUS. 
Then never depend on another for aid, 
If granted its got to be sometime repaid. 
Struggle and strive and you'll gain the pelf, 
With no one to thank that you helped yourself.

Oh, how I

When roaming on a

In fancy still my steps were here— 
Home of my heart, my native *land! 
In fancy still my steps were here, 
Home of my heart, ray native land! 
I've found the Home so fondly sought, 
And weep, but these are joyous tears, 
The rapture of a 
moment bought, 
By long and weary absent years. 
Oh, how I

I'M A 
DAD, DAD, DAD, 
Sung with great snccosa by Eddie Norwood. 
I'D been married nearly twenty years and ue'er a 
chick nor 
child 
Had crowned my joy, folks made remarks that often made me 
wild, 
Aye what they've said and how they've looked, oft drove me 
to despair, 
But something happened the other day that made the neigh-
bors stare. 
Cnonus. 
My wife, my darling joy, she's got a 
little boy, 
I 
feel so very proud I 
could go mad, mad, mad. 
The neighbors say its clever and its better late than never, 
I 
feel so very glad now I'm a 
dad, dad, dad. 
When I 
call upon my married friends each one I 
surely 
found, 
had lots of little images a 
playing all around, 
And every time I 
chance to meet my old chum Peter Gray, 
He'd say why Brown you've not yet one and I've got seven 
teen. 
My wife, &e. 
To behold the little stranger there's been quite an anxious 
crowd, 
They say now I'm a 
father and should really feel quite proud. 
t 
And so I 
do, and oft with joy, I 
feel as though I'd burst, 
When I 
hear them compliment me on the beauties of our first. 
My wife, Lk. 
Egad, I'm excited, every now and then I 
feels 
As though I 
scarce know whether I'm on my head or on my 
heels; 
Of course we'll give a 
party soon, aye a 
jolly grand affair, 
In honor of the birth of this my infant son and heir.

lot of bummers, 
In a 
saloon away up town, 
Drinking beer and breaking tumblers, 
And telling the landlord to chalk it down. 
I 
have no friends, I 
live on lunches, 
And in cellars I 
sleep all night;

what I'd give for a 
few rum punches, 
Just to set my nerves all right. 
CHORUS. 
Mister please give me a 
beverage, 
some stale beer, or a 
whiskey straight; 
Mister, just say to me tonic, 
To steady my nerves for mercy sake 
While you drink your gin and brandy, 
And with pleasure home you roll, 
Three cent nips just suits Joe Blossom, 
Won't some one ask me to take a 
bowl, 
My clothes are getting kind of seedy, 
My nose with blossoms are in bloom, 
This mournful eye I 
got this morning, 
From my old lunch pard. Mickie Muldune. 
Once he was a 
jolly good fellow, 
But to treat me so makes my heart scald, 
But he never again shall sleep in my cellar, 
Won't some one ask me take a 
bowl. 
KNIVES TO GRIND. 
Now, white folks, I 
beg you don't wonder at me; 
Though colored, I 
am not at all proud; 
I've got a 
short story to tell in my song, 
And I'll try hard to sing it out loud. 
I've gbt a 
bull pup named Terrible Pete. 
He is cross-eyed, bow-legged, and has but three feet, 
I 
never saw another that he could'nt beat, 
Oh, he was a 
terrible purp. 
While walking down town one Sunday night, I 
With this magnificent bull Newfoundland cub, 
Another kiodel kicked hirn in the eye, 
And he was insulted at this. 
He went for this dog and chewed off his ear, 
'Tis the truth I 
tell you, though it may seem queer, 
And then with myself he got chock full of beer, 
Did this beautiful black and tan hound.

Enter Pompey singing and playing guitar or banjo. 
Pomp. --Ah! Here I am at last, after jumping over 
walls and fences and being chased by ferocious dogs and 
wild bulls, I 
have landed safe and sound. 
Yes, this is the 
domicile of my adored Clementine, who I 
was introduced 
to at the last base ball and danced with her every set. Oh, 
she is such a 
lovely creature and I 
am mad in love with 
her. 
I've done nothing but dream of her ever since we 
met, and I've made up my mind to see her and propose 
right away. I 
wonder if she is at home. I 
will discourse 
a 
few of my warbles and see if this lovely angel is hover-
ing around these diggings.

Hoist love, the window, gaze on me, darling, 
Fondly I'm waiting my turtle dove, 
Bright stars are blinking, the moon is winking, 
hasten to me darling now my own sweet love, 
My heart's a

Bursting all the buttons off my double-breasted vest, 
Make no delay and with me be going, 
The cattle train we'll take and go out west!

Hoist love, the window, gaze on me, darling, 
Fondly I'm waiting my turtle dove. 
Stars now are blinking, the moon is winking, 
Tarry not a 
moment my turtle dove.

She cometh not. 
Perhaps she is in the kitchen skinning 
eels. 
I 
will hie me to the back door and see if she be 
there.

Enter Jeff humming a 
tune. 
Jeff. — She's the sweetest of the sweetest, the gayest of 
the gayest. 
Yes, that's the gal I'm looking for, and she 
lives somewhere about here. 
I 
met her down to the ball 
the other night and had several introductions to her, and 
I 
was perfectly carried away with her charming face and 
figure, and she said I 
might call on her and here I 
am, and 
[THE TROITIINDORES.—Continued.] 
if I 
don't make a 
favorable impression on her I 
will go 
and drown myself. 
Yes, I 
have vowed she should be 
mine, and mine she must be, or there will be war, war to 
the knife. 
I 
have brought my razor with me (
pulls out 
large tin swor(l), and the first nigger comes in between me 
and my adored Clementine there will be a cow shed or 
blood shed, for I 
am resolved. 
I 
am desperate. 
(Serapes 
sword on Stage aS if to Sharpen). 
Yes, with this razor I 
will 
carve the aforesaid nigger as I 
would a 
Christmas turkey. 
I 
will now claim her attention and warble a few of my 
gum drops of sweetness and see if her fairy-like form is 
still floating about here.

Chorus.-011, turtle dove, etc. 
(Looks about and up at window). • 
Ali! 
She puteth not in an appearance and I 
am lost to 
know why it is thusly. 
She could not resist the fascina-
tions of my warbles if she heard me. 
She may be eating 
watermelons on the back stoop. 
I 
will stroll around the 
lien-coop nnd see if my chicken is there. 
(Evil and change 
femule). 
Enter Pompey, looking wysterionsly about. 
Pamp.—Me thinks I 
heard sweet strains of music here 
about. 
It could not be the echo of my own shadow. 
No, 
that's too thin. 
It must be. 
Yes, it is thusly. 
There's a 
nigger somewhere. 
I 
smell his footprints. 
I 
hear his eye 
wink and the rustle of his neck tie. 
Ali ! 
Should I 
find 
another nigger incarcerated in the affections of my idol, 
I 
would not be responsible for any valuables left in my 
possession or my actions toward the aforesaid conglomera-
tion of smoked beef. 
No, I would despatch the first 
shadow of a 
doubt and disfigure him for life. 
Yes, with 
this razor (
pulls out big tin sword), 1 
would shave the wool 
all off his head, pin his ears back and swallow him whole. 
(S./apes StrOrd on stage as if to sharpen,. 
Puts away sword 
et nd [100 toward cabin). 
I 
will tune my instrument and 
play another discord. 
If my ears deceive me I 
will burst 
in their drums and they shall play on me no more. 
(The window suddenly opens and feinale appears. 
Looks 
down on Pompey). 
She.—Alt! 
Here's the other brass band. 
Now, I've two 
lovers serenading me at the same time. 
One in front and 
the other in the rear. 
One is hanging by his teeth at the 
window and the other is here playing seven-up with his 
guitar strings. 
Now, what shall I 
do. 
I 
can't have them 
both here. 
I 
have it. 
I 
will throw a 
pan of hot ashes on 
one and I'll scald the other with hot water. 
No, that 
would be cruelty to animals. 
I must try some other 
remedy. 
Yes, 1 
have it. 
I 
will send the one at the back 
door after the policy slips and I 
will send this one after a 
pair of ten button kid gloves. (Closes window),

She.—Nh, it is you Adolplius Pompey! (Comes forward). 
Both come forward. 
Pomp.—Yes, my sweet persimmon, I 
am here. 
Oh, I'm 
F-o

What would 
I 
not do for thee ? 
I 
love and adore thee. 
Thou art my 
jewel. 
Thou art a 
whole confectionery store ! 
She.—Then you love and adore me. 
Well, if you love 
me as fondly as you say you must be a 
Troubadore, and if 
you would be my Troubadore, there is one thing you must 
do. 
The fact is, I 
am going to a 
base ball to- night and I 
have neglected to provide myself with a pair of gloves, 
kid gloves, canary color, ten buttons, size 14, and— 
Interrupted by Pompey. 
Pomp.—Ah, my love, I 
have dreamed, and my dream 
has come true. 
Yes, I 
dreamt you was going to a 
ball and 
that I 
was to be your escort, and as it is customary for a 
gent taking a 
lady to a 
ball to provide a 
box of gloves, or 
at least a 
pair, and as the boxes were all out, I 
have brought 
you a 
pair, and here they are.

striped stockings and holds theta up to view). 
Site (screams).—Do you mean to insult me, sir? 
Potnp.—By heavings! The clerk has made a mistake 
and gave me the wrong parcel.

She (excited).—'Tis false, sir ! 
Thou art deceiving me ! 
You have some one else besides me to love, and you are an 
impostor.

Seizes hint and throws hint about). 
Dost thou

Go hence! 
Away with you! 
I 
hate you, and 
if ever you conic around here again I 
will scald all the 
wool off your head. 
Exit and change, to Jejr. 
Pomp.—There ! My 
fire is all knocked in the fat! 
Just 
as I 
thought I 
was going to capture the prize I 
have lost it, 
and all by those confounded striped stockings. 
Oh, I 
am 
ruined. 
I 
am lost. 
What shall I 
do ? 
(Puts hands to 
head). 
I 
will go and buy her a 
seal skin saque and a 
cluster 
diamond ring. (Stops suddenly and listens). 
Ali! I 
hear a

bumble-bee a 
buzzing. 
I'll step 
aside and listen.

THE LITTLE ISLE SO GREEN, 
Written, Composed and Sung, by CHARLEY RUDDY. 
Dedicated to his friend JOHNNY ROACH. 
There's a 
land across the ocean, that dear old country, 
Where all those Irish heroes were born, who fought and bled 
While fighting side by side, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green ; 
The land it is oppressed—by the English is distress'd, 
They tried to trample on that flag so green, 
But they never can do that, while there beats an Irish heart 
In the men that lived in that little Isle so green. 
In Ireland, to this day, you will hear the people say, 
They never will own allegiance to the Queen. but for liberty 
They cry, and they would surely die, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green. 
In every little village in that land so far away, 
You will find that little Shamrock so green, 
For they cannot transport that, as they did unto poor Pat, 
And banish it from that little Isle so green. 
There was a 
noble man not many years ago, 
In Tipperary always to be seen, 
lie rendered great his fame, for John Mitchell's a 
true son 
Of that little Isle so green, 
The English soon did know him they must o'erthrovr, 
Or else they'd lose that little Isle so green. 
So him they did transport, to a 
strange land sent him. 
And banished him from that little Isle so green.

Originally sung by Miss ELLA WEsNEB, at the Eagle 
Theatre, with great success. 
Oh ! " tou-jour gais," my motto, boys— 
Confound your doleful dumps— 
. 
I'm known upon the town, boys, 
As the joval King of Trumps. 
I'm the favorite of all jolly dogs, 
They drag me out at night ; 
For when they have got me with them 
Of course they know they're right. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps— 
Whenever you're down in the dumps, 
Come, come with me for a 
jolly spree, 
For I 
am King of Trumps. 
I've coffee and seltzer water boys, 
And look in at the Club; 
Shy in for chicken hazzard, boys, 
Or cut in for a 
rub ; 
But when Big Ben strikes ten, 
We pitch pasteboard and bones away, 
For ten o'clock at night, boys, 
Is our favorite time of day. 
Trumps, trumps, tte, 
The Theatres, now, are voted slow, 
A 
Music Hall's the thing. 
We Hansom off to the joliest, 
To hear the Comique's sing; 
We go in for no end of charm, 
No end of bright Moselle ; 
But when the ballad is over boys, 
We sally out pell-mell. 
Trumps, trumps, k.e. 
We stand up, next, perhaps to dance, 
Or stand up in a 
row ; 
But its all the same to us, you know, 
And we come out right somehow; 
I've visions next of Hay Markets— 
I 
hope its but a .dream— 
But we mingle with society 
That's not the cream of cream. 
Trumps, trumps, Sze. 
Where next we go, I 
never know— 
n may be, perhaps, pell-mell ; 
Or, perhaps it is Saint Giles ; 
But the wine begins to tell ; 
We see a 
double everything 
In every street we roam; 
And so at last we call a 
cab, 
And double back to home.

I'M a 
sample of a 
very lucky man, lucky man, 
And I'm only sorry life, is but a 
span, but a 
span, 
The joys of life keep tumbling in, the stream will novel 
cease, 
And if I 
lived a 
hundred years, my pleasures would increase. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm what is called a 
very lucky man, 
Ha! ha ! ha ! ha! such a 
lucky man. 
And why am I 
a 
very lucky man, lucky man, 
They say because I 
have a 
little plan, yes, a 
plan, 
By which I 
turn to gold, the dust beneath my feet, 
And wherever gold may lurk, we know each other when 
we meet. 
To a 
shooting match I 
go, the prizes to gain, yes to gain, 
And my fellow volunteers try in vain, quite in vain, 
The prize is surely mine, for I 
do all I 
can, 
To win, and all the rest are daunted by the lucky man. 
Oh I'm, & c. 
I'm happy, and my heart is light and gay, light and gay, 
And that's because I'm lucky, people say, People say. 
It may be so, but, this I 
know, I 
led a 
steady life, 
When young, and at an early age I 
took a 
prudent wife. 
But I'm, &c. 
In this world, I 
have succeeded very well, very well, 
They say because you've had a 
lucky spell, yes a 
spell, 
That may be true, but this I 
know, I'm always at my post, 
And I 
never take my shoulder from the wheel, at any cost. 
But I'm, &c. 
But it's not against their luck, that people fall, people fall, 
Indeed I 
don't believe in luck at all, not at all, 
In life a 
steady aim, a 
bright and spotless name, 
Will carry all before them, and insure a 
lasting fame. 
And then you'll be, &c.

As Sung with unbounded applause, by PAT RMNEY, at 
the Olympic Theatre. 
All the trials and troubles— 
To you I 
will relate— 
That I 
have had to undergo 
Through being a 
candidate; 
I 
always lived a 
quiet life, 
Until one Mike McCann, 
lie came to me, and says, Duffle, 
You must run for Alderman. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas in the 7th Ward below, 
In a 
neighborhood they call Cork Bi-lw; 
Where the boys of me made a 
holy show, 
When I 
ran for Alderman. 
It was in McCann's back room, 
That night they nominated me ; 
I 
axed the boys to have a 
drink, 
As they gave me three times three; 
They drank and smoked, they smoked awl drank, 
'Till drunk was every man ; 
'Twas all at the expense 
Of poor Pat Dufae, the Alderman. 
'Twas in the. Ice. 
But when election day it came, 
I 
found out very soon, 
The boys had all gone back on me, 
And were voting for Muldoon; 
And when I 
axed the raison why— 
To laugh, they all began— 
Saying, we don't want no Tarrier, 
For to be our Alderman. 
'Twas in the kc. 
The Men That We Ought to Avoid. 
A man is oft known by the friends that he keeps, 
or birds of a 
feather we find, 
Will oft flock together—and so to the fact, 
It is right wo should never be blind 
How many a 
hope of advancement in life, 
Has been by false friendship destroyed; 
So it cannot be wrong to name in my song, 
Some men you ought to avoid. 
CHORUS. 
Some sham to be gold, but with plenty of brass, 
You'll very soon find them alloyed, 
A man who seems this, and proves to be that, 
Is a 
man you ought to avoid. 
There are men who will borrow at every chance, 
Whom 'twere bstter at once to offend, 
But the danger is worse in knowing a 
man, 
Whose business is ever to lend, 
He has interest in you and from you as well, 
And e'en if of cash you're devoid, 
Your uncle who hangs out the three golden balls, 
Is a 
man that you ought to avoid. 
A lawyer who runs up his six-and-eight fees, 
A drunkard with unsteady gait, 
A braggart whose talk is all tun of bombast, 
As of wisdom is empty his pate; 
A 
liar whose word is a 
pitfall and snare, 
A parson whose time is employed 
Informing on crimes for the sake of the fines, 
These arc men that we ought to avoid. 
The egotist praising his own paltry deeds, 
Who'll of nothing but self ever speak, 
The smooth, fawning, oil talking, cat sort of mast 
The tale-bearing, tit-tattle sneak; 
These all are the pests of our snug little isle, 
By which we are oftimes annoyed, 
Like sharks in the sea or flies in your tea, 
They are things that you ought to avoid. 
Words and Music by JENNIE LINDSAY. 
Come smile once again, e'er we part, love, 
Say that you'll ever be true, 
For o'er the seas I 
must go love ; 
Still my poor heart is with you, 
And though absent, I 
love ya.: fa: better, 
And I'll dream of you, ev.7:y day ; 
Yes, each week I

Written by JOHN FIELDING. 
I'm a 
foreigner, that you can see. 
So there's no use in telling ye's that ; 
The place that I 
came is far o'er the main, 
Where every one is known as Pat! 
Now my brogue to you may seem strange— 
It has such a 
perculiar twang! 
But the accent is sweet and the movements is nate 
Of a 
North of Ireland man. 
Cronus. 
I'm a 
North of Ireland man, 
And me name it is Roger McMann ; 
The style of me brogues, 
And the cut of me clothes, 
Shows I'm a 
North of Ireland man. 
When I 
first struck this beautiful place, 
how the boys did of me make game. 
Some said Pipe his Gob, and more, stab nobs! 
Faith, I 
thought they were all insane; 
But I 
was not many months here, 
Until I 
took a 
tumble to myself. 
Now I'm bully at Cheesing it Culley— 
Sure, I 
lay them all out on the shelf 
I'm a

GOODING. 
Sung by L. ScHooLcRIFT. 
I'VE been walking around this big city, 
l'm so tired I 
scarcely can jog, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
When ever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order me out there and then, 
And say that I'm drunk and ly,;(1 my fill, 
And they've nicknamed me Old Snoozer Ben. 
Once I 
was in good circumstances, 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
lost all by taking the chances, 
And bad luck struck Old Snoozer Ben. 
CIIORUS, 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
I'm looking for some friends to come t 
It's provoking—Fm choking, 
I'm shaking for one glass of rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
But they never do so any more, 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
As they had many poor fools they mept, 
But now-a-days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I 
ye noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and aint any dimes now, 
lie's as bad off as Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
in hopes that some old friend I'd meet, 
Only think now—One drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat. 
I 
feel that I'm fast growing weaker, 
If only I 
had just a 
drop, 
My poor wife, oh ! how can I 
seek her, 
Oh ! rum—rum, oh ! why can't I 
stop. 
What figures are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and child, 
They are starving at home—oh! dear me, 
Give me Brandy or I 
shall go wild— 
But no, I must banish this madness, 
And try be a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladnes.s, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must bear it—I 
swear It, 
No liquor for me e'er again, 
No shrinking--or drinking, 
So pattern from Old Snoozer Ben.

sung by H ARRY VAN:aCtAR
, 
comic vocalist. 
Old Humphrey Hodge a 
farmer was, 
His age was fifty-seven ; 
A bachelor, too, and well to do, 
For he in the world had thriven. 
And Humphrey Hodge, from morn till dark, 
Was as happy as the day was long, 
For he rose with the Sun, and he sang with the lark, 
And this was his favorite song: 
Rock the cradle, John, 
Rock the cradle, John, 
An old man married had better be burias1 
Than rocking the cradle alone. 
Now Humphey Hodge had a 
servant girl, 
As blooming as the day, 
And she was fair as the lily ,or pearl, 
And fresh as the flowers In May; 
And her eyes shot forth such lustrous beams 
That, somehow, e'er ' twas long, 
ner image was ever in Humphey's dreams 
In spite of his favorite song: 
Rock the cradle, etAN 
ROCK THE CRADLE, JOHN, Confirmed. 
Now Humphrey Hodge, alas and alas! 
Grew tired of single life; 
And e'er the harvest moon could pass, 
He made this maid his wife. 
And the sun shone bright on his marriage meta, 
And the bells rang out ding (long, 
And Humphrey felt like a 
man new-born, 
And fairly forgot the song. 
Rock the cradle, etc,. 
Now Humphrey Hodge and his dear little wife 
Were as happy as any pair, 
until the time that he was blessed 
With a 
buxom son and heir. 
And he sits and sighs as the baby cries, 
With its lungs so loud and strong; 
Yet he singh forsooth, and reflects on the truth 
Contained a 
his favorite song: 
Rock the cradle, etc. 
Now Humphrey Hodge walks round the farm, 
And li;s hair is silver-grey, 
With his wife before, and the child on his arra, 
The fruits of December and May. 
And people smile at the silly old man 
Being wed to a 
wife so young;

No dog to love, none to caress, 
how can I 
ever my sadness repress ; 
Chunk is defunct, dead as a 
nail, 
Hushed is his bark, still is his tail ! 
Oh ! Such a 
tail—white on the end ; 
Ott did he chase it, with wiggle and bend; 
Chased it with hope, 'round and 'round, 
'Till overcome, he reposed on the ground, 
C1101038. 
Now he's extinct, dead as a

Where is his bark or the wag of his tail? 
[Repeat.] 
While dreaming, alone, poor Chunck I 
see, 
Swigging his milk or scratching a 
ilea! 
'Tit; but a 
dream ! waking I 
weep, 
For under ground poor Chunk does sleep. 
Oh ! beautiful Purp, once full of play, 
Have I 
not fed you day after day? 
Given you milk, given you bread, 
Ginn you many a 
pat on the head? 
Now he's extinct., &e. 
Now you're extinct, dead as a 
nail, 
Where is your bark, or the wag of your tail? 
No dog to love— noire to repress— 
Vainly I 
strive the glad tears to repress; 
Why did you die ? sadly I 
moan; 
Was it from poison, or swallowing a 
bone? 
No waggin' tail—no beaming eye, 
Answer a 
question, or give a 
reply. 
CuoRns. 
Was it a 
fit, or stoppage of breath ? 
Or eating too much, the sad cause of your death? 
Still not a

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
Of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
*there to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the tura 
Oorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting. ,"

neat litt:e 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing awenty-five cents, called the 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the moduli operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to mom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tie old-

published it for years. and the demand is continually increasing. 
7tese Cards are arr , nged and printed in series-,Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
Monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to le. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the direetions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
te meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
litany young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is retrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spout as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quastions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
fob adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
