NICK NAL 
Sung with great success by SANFORD & W ILSON. 
Written by Ireland's First Actor, JIM RICHMOND. 
 ::-
Went down to the Slaughter-House, 
To see Bill kill a Calf; 
He sharpened the axe on a 
hickory stone, 
And made the cows all laugh; 
He hit 'em plumb upon the head, 
And split 'em up the backs; 
his little brother harry cried, 
And hollered out Nick Nax. 
CHORUS: 
Nick Nax don't shave the pigs, 
But give 'em carpet tacks; 
The best thing out to cure the blues, 
Is to come and see Nick Nax. 
A 
nigger went up in a 
balloon 
Balanced by a 
nail; 
He met old Jonah in the clouds, 
With a 
warrant for the Whale; 
The balloon busted, landed on a 
church, 
And struck the nigger in the back; 
He lowered himself with a 
spool of thread, 
And shouted out Nick Nax, 
Chorus. 
Written by MR. SANFORD, and sung by SANFORD & W ILSON 
with great succcess. 
Policeman struck himself with his club, 
Move on, move on, move on; " 
'Cause the Boarding-House did give bad grub, 
Move on I 
say; 
Frank Lewis canceled all his dates, 
Move on, move on; 
lie is going to be door-keeper at the beautiful gates 
:11ove on I 
say; 
Him and B. C. Hart have doubled up, 
Move on, move on; 
They do a 
trial jig for a 
china cup, 
Move on I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Move on, move on, 
Or else you'll miss the train; 
The company's funds are busted, 
We must walk back from Fort Wayne. 
A manager said he was full till May, 
Move on, move on; 
But if he was he didn't pay, 
Move on I 
say; 
We asked a $ 100 planks up to his face, 
Move on, move on; 
He asked me then to buy the place, 
Move on I 
say; 
A 
song and dance team write, say they are fine, 
Move on, move on; 
Been in the business since December, 1879, 
Move on I 
say, 
Chorus. 
Written by JAMES SANFORD. 
Sung by SANFORD & W ILSON with great success. 
I 
love my breakfast in the morning, 
I 
love my dinner at night; 
I 
love to hear original songs, 
I'd sooner eat than fight; 
I 
love to have plenty of money, 
I 
love my little wife, 
I 
love to smoke Havana cigars, 
But the best I 
love is life; 
I 
love to play in .T. Towns, 
Make a 
failure among file gawks; 
I 
love to drink sparkling champagne, 
But I 
don't love long walks. 
I 
hate to chew tobacco, 
A 
gin-blossom on my nose: 
I 
hate a 
bad performer, 
And a 
ragged suit of clothes; 
I 
hate to eat three times a 
day, 
I 
hate a 
Bumble Bee; 
hate to work in little shows, 
But T 
love big salary you bet. 
Br CHARLES W ILSON. 
Sung by SANFORD S
.; W ILSON. 
Down on the Mississippi coons ain't got no hair, 
You ought to see a 
nigger run when he sees a 
bear; 
Coons get a 
fighting, Razors they will fly, 
Kick them in the shins and whiten up their eye; 
Wenches look like nigger dolls, 
Dressed in three cent silk; 
Grab a 
hold of turkeys, 
And try to get some milk. 
CHORUS: 
Down on the Mississippi, River runs ' long, 
What a 
lovely sound when a 
darky sings a 
song; 
A 
nig ,rer prays to do right when he does wrong, 
Down on the Mississippi River. 
Roll on the cotton bales. 
Just as nice as pie, 
Roll it on a 
coon's leg, 
He'll spit tobacco in your eye; 
Hit him in the ear, 
Then there'll be a 
race 
Slug him in the neck, 
And dance on his face. 
Wri.ten by JAMES RICHMOND, and sung by SANFORD 8; W ILSON. 
Air—Babies on our Block. 
Good morning Dick, I 
am here, 
Did Gilmore or Snellbacker call? 
Well, come, I've got a 
quarter, 
Let us have a 
ball; 
I 
hear Tom Granger wants to double up, 
I 
wonder what's the reason, 
I'd like to join him, but I 
can't 
Throw St. Paul up for the season; 
There is Waldman, Harry Williams, 
Billy Emmet and Charles O'White, 
Offer me four hundred dollars, 
For two turns every night; 
Why I 
knocked them out in Saginaw, 
Never played there before; 
I 
got more salary than Kelly & Ryan, 
And the American honest pardge. 
Well, I 
can send you down to Cuba, 
What, do you think I 
am a 
boy? 
Can't you fix a 
couple of weeks for me 
In Cohoes or Troy? 
I 
am thinking of starting a 
company, 
Me and a 
rich guy, a 
pretty good friend, 
Get Lizzie Derious for me, 
And put the old man on the end; 
Nosey Gibbous in the middle, 
Playing the brass fiddle, 
A couple of funny musical J's, 
flow is scarlet fever and riddle they say; 
They do a 
funny act, 
A 
tarrier and a 
jew, 
They wrote to me from Kankakee, 
Eleven dollars for the two.

TWENTY YEARS AGO PARODY. 
By FRANK JONES. 
Sling by SANFORD SD 
W ILSON. 
I'VE wandered through the village, Torn, 
A 
singing, merrily, 
When I 
was arrested and sent to jail. 
Which often sheltered you and me; 
But none was there to bail me out. 
At least they told me so, 
'or I
..- 
wasn't acquainted with the judge 
Like twenty years ago. 
The boys are at their same old tricks 
A 
stealing sugar and tea, 
uV stole a 
ham the other night, 
You've did it oft' with me; 
They're gambling still for money, Tom, 
At that baby game keno ; 
hat dear old game we loved so well 
Some twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered too, dear Tom. 
It's larger now than then ; 
The cells they are made wider, Tom, 
To accommodate gentlemen. 
The old bell rings out as it did 
When to States Prison we had to go, 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom, 
As twenty years ago. 
The river is running just as stills 
The willow by its side 
Fell over on a 
man, dear Toni, 
And yesterday he died; 
The grape vine, too, is ruined, Torn, 
Where we had such fun, you know, 
A 
hanging up poor Kaiser's dog 
Some twenty years ago. 
The boys are all in jail, dear Tom, 
A 
singing ever of thee; 
But none are left of the aristocracy 
Excepting you and me; 
And soon the gong will sound, dear 
And to 
to dinner we must go, 
I 
hope thee'il give us us cod-fish belle 
Like twenty years ago.

SLANG. 
A IR: Castles in th,e Air. 
Banjo Solo by FRANK JONES. Sung by SANFORD 14 W ILSON. 
THE song I'm going to sing you now it's neither old or neW, 
It's one I've written up myself on purpose to please you; 
Ws about the funny sayings, boys, that's going round about, 
Cheese it, Cully ! stag his nibs, does your mother know your 
out ? 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! ain't it funny, boys, the slang now-a-days we hear; 
The old, the young, the short, the tall, 
The thick, the thin, the queer. 
No matter where you meet them, boys, you're sure to hear them 
shout, 
Cheese it, Cully ! stag his nibs, does your mother know you're 
out ? 
I 
am hunky on the mash, another one says cheese, 
Go way and take a 
tumble, now, dry up, give me a 
breeze ; 
How is the old thing working now? Do you think the bloke's 
got wealth ? 
But the last one out to my idea, is, do you knew how it is your-
self. 
Oh! ain't, & c. 
Sometimes it's ied hot, or immense, or walk off on your ear, 
A 
bully boy with a 
big glass eye, do you think his nibs is queer! 
Another one says Nixey Weed, do you take me for a 
fiat? 
But the one that always kills me dead is, don't you give Inc 
none of that. 
! 
ain't, &c. 
Now I 
am about to sherry, boys, I've told you all I 
know 
About the slang phrases that are everywhere they go; 
But if you'll come to- morrow night and stag the fakemente 
here, 
I'll whoop you up another song and walk off on my ear. 
Oh ! ain't, &c.

MASSA'S ItITMEN FLOOR 
As sung by JouNsos. & BRUNO. 
Two old Virginia Niggers, 
You musn't think we'-e 
green; 
When working on the Steamboat 
On the Mississipni stream, 
We used to tote the cotton bales, 
And heave the plank ashore; 
And often spend our money 
On the Old Virginia shore. 
CHORUS. 
Two lightning, colored Mokes, [ Break 
From Old Virginia shore. [ Break 
[Repeat 
And now we'll show you how we dance 
On old Massa's kitchen floor. 
When on the old platation, 
Us darkies held our sway; 
We'd sing and dance from morn to night, 
And on the Banjo play; 
We'd pick the cotton, hoe the corn, 
And when our work was o'er; 
Then all together we would dance 
On Massa's kitchen floor. 
Two lightning, & a. 
CLAM SOUP MAN, 
Banjo Solo. 
Sung by cuss. WILSON. 
AIR: Abraham's Daughter. 
OH, I'll sing of a 
girl about sweet sixteen, 
Het nose was red and her eyes were green, 
Her maiden name was Emigene Lee, 
And her father sold clams in a 
cottage by the sea, 
She was the raging belle of this town, 
And she loved a 
shoe-maker by the name of McGown, 
Oh, McGown he swore upon his life, 
He'd make Matilda Jane his wife. 
15 
[Rep. last two lines 
Oh, one night she went to a 
ball, 
With the clam soup man to Harmony Hall, 
fhey had danced three sets with the burth to begin, 
When all at once McGown stepped in, 
And when he saw his love a 
dancing there, 
He raved and raved, and tore his .:air, 
He challenged the clam soup man in the hall, 
To fight next day with a 
codfish-bail. [Rep. last two lines 
Oh, they met next day in an open lot. 
With a 
codfish-ball McGown got shot, 
He fell on his back to end his woes, 
Then give three cheers for sixteen's hose, 
When Matilda found her love had fell, 
She jumped into a 
barrel of oyster shells, 
ihe ecratchil her shins till the skin came off. 
Then died next day with the whooping cough. 
(Rep. last two lines. 
WON'T YOU EVER DROP. 
Banjo Soto, As sung by JAS. SANFORD. 
I 
WENT to see my Jenny dear the other night at eight, 
her Pa and Ma were in the room, we chatted till quite late, 
The old man said when off to bed, you know the clock is slow, 
I 
knew it was a 
hint for me, but I 
couldn't take it so. 
CHORUS. 
Won't you ever tumble, won't you ever drop, 
Cheese it cully, sherry your nibs, or I 
will call a 
cop, 
1, 2, 3, bounce him or hit him with a 
mop. 
I 
couldn't help but tumble then, but still I 
didn't drop, 
I 
called again next evening to see my Jenny dear. 
She met me at the front door I 
thought that she looked queer 
She told me that her cousin had called to spend the eve, 
And consequently for his sake no callers she'd receive, 
Won't you ever tumble, Ltc. 
I 
Went right home that very night my peu in hand did take, 
To ask her if she would tell me why to me she'd give the 
shake. 
I 
asked her to forget, forgive, and all that kind of trash, 
I 
told her just so long I 
lived no other girl I'd mash. 
Won't you ever tumble, (Lc. 
AUN T

And what we both have said to-night, I 
hope you're not

If you ever want to see As again, just call for Jitn and sally, 
You will always find us both a

As originally sung with tremendous success throughout the 
United States by the Duncan Sisters, 
CARRIE AND SOPHIE. 
M Y' beau took me, one day, sailing down the bay. 
He called me his dear Emma. 
That's my name. 
While standing on the pier some chaps began to stare, 
And one and all around us did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! 
Emma, you put me in such a 
dilemma! 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, when some one at us sent 
An egg, which struck my beau right in the eye! 
I 
then began to scream, " Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh, Emraa! Who, Emma! etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease. 
We shouted out police! 
And when he came he looked at us so sly; 
He said " Don't be put out—it's only a 
saying that's got 
about," 
And then their voices seemed to rend the sky. 
SPOKEN. — You see, this is the latest New York byword, 
" 
Oh, Emma!" and we didn't know that. 
So they all 
commenced together again, including the policeman— 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! etc.

Sweet woman she was intended to be, 
Everything that is nice! 
But sometimes she's as hot as the mustard pot, 
And sometimes far colder than ice! 
Sometimes she plays the lion's part, 
Whilst we have to play the lamb, 
That's likely to lead to family Jars, 
That never contain any Jam.

We're going to have a 
jolly spread 
And lots to eat it too, 
There's father, mother, Uncle Ned, 
And Vic and cousin Loo. 
I 
hope I 
shant be taken ill 
When I 
hear the parson say, 
You must nourish her and cherish her, 
Upon your wedding day. 
CHO :—Wednesday is my wedding day, & c. 
Each day seems like a 
year to me 
Each minute like an hour, 
I 
often put salt into my tea 
So strong is wedlock's power. 
The people tell me I 
am mad; 
'Tis not any way, 
Oh, jumping Mose! aint I 
glad 
She's named the wedding day. 
Cuo :—Wednesday is my wedding day, &c. 
Farewell to Billiards, Bagatelle, 
And every kind of sport, 
Farewell to Champagne and Moselle, 
And sundry drops of short. 
The reason why I 
say good bye 
To all these capers gay, 
Is because I've better fish to fry, 
Upon my wedding day.

Where was 
Mo - ses 
when the light went 
out? 
Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid thiw ,s 
I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c.

Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
Put Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve, 
I 
met her in the street when she had just two days been wed, 
And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said: 
Cito:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c. 
4. 
Some twenty years passed by before I 
heard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
CHO: —Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
5. 
Now when once more the light of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've ' waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light:

Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When (le shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark. 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
YOU people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknees, toil and sorrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our inem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls (ley were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days

Underneath the sweet magnolia, now, remember what I -tole y-er,” 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allalee, 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom, shed its petals on her bosom. 
And I 
had to-brush them oil so tenderly. 
But she seemed to half decline when I 
asked her to be mine; 
Then I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast. 
Till she said you may relent it. hasty weddings are repented, 
That was all she said, but you can guess the rest. 
Cno.—Oh, Yes! Ac. 
sung by 1)AvE WALLING, in Rose's Courtship; at the Park 
Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
DE moon is shining bright now, 
As I 
sit beside de cabin door, 
I 
am thinking of de old folks, 
Dat lived on de old Virginny shore, 
We once was happy in de old home, 
Before Old master's soul did roam, 
But now the poor darkey's have to wander, 
Far from de old Kentucky home. 
Good bye, old folks, good bye, 
Now we'll have to roam, 
Since master's gone and left us, 
And our old Kentucky home. 
HICKORY JACKSON, 
Sung By HA 
RRI" W ESTERN, in Rose's Courtship, at tn., 
Park Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
NOW kind friends do look at me, 
And an old man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday. 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle. 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle. 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay. 
Dem was de good old times, 
When you conk.' 
save de dimes. 
But now 
eiri times am gone and passed away, 
'Iut give 
e 
de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
Da:st whet old man Hickory Jackson had his day 
One thine- more I'd like to say, 
Just hi'fore I 
no away. 
Of the times E 
use to have in Dixie's Land. 
I 
use to hoe de corn from de breaking of de morn, 
And many a. cicd of earth has bruised deise hands. 
Bat w 
e„ 
Nv;v done, we darkey's had de fun 
Old ma ster not our jag anti cleared de way, 
For de ell 
irginn 
reel, 
From tIe toe down to do heel, 
Dats 
old man Hickory Jackson had his day 
Parody out Kiss Me Again. 
Sung by Andy Collum, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner in front of a 
Dutch grocer: - 
stortl, 
Thinking of home, and my clothes all in hock, 
When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my head on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
He kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made iny stomach feel queer, 
He kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they hang around saloons and cigar stores you bet, 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent, 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
And always are ready to kick you once more. 
He kicked me again, &c.

half so fair, As that pretty little girl with the nut-brown hair. 
2. 
She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings " Will my love come back," 
Till her old grandpa with his long white hair. 
Laughs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell. 
I 
love her all the better, its a 
fact what I 
say, 
She's as lively as a 
cricket all the livelong day. 
C110:—Give me the cot where Mary lives, etc. 
3. 
How my heart goes bump when I 
think of the day 
That we both first met in the new mown hay, 
She looked like a 
rose with a 
delicate blush, 
Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed, " Pretty Polly, what a 
witch you arP 
And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings, 
I 
should really think she is, but she's got no wings.

said I 
loved her to distraction, 
I 
spoke to her old crusty dad ; 
Gave him every satisfaction 
As to how much coin I 
had. 
And he gave me his permission, 
if I 
could, his child to wed ; 
Still she would not calmly listen 
To the loving words I 
said, 
But blushed and murmured, "stop that, mister," 
When I 
caught her in my arms, 
And if I 
but only kissed her 
She was filled with dreadful qualms, 
She'd struggle in my arms and cry: 
Oh! let me go, or I 
shall die. 
Cno. — Georgie, R:c.

At last one evening I 
did meet her, 
In a 
most retired spot; 
And I 
with a 
kiss did greet her, 
Ere she'd time to tell me not, 
And I 
quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When I 
acted as a 
lover 
Soon great progress then I 
made. 
Married life she said she'd like it, 
And she'd gladly marry me: 
So a 
bargain we did strik- it, 
And my wife shell shortly be, 
And when arrives the happy day 
When I 
squeeze her she won't say— 
CHO. -Georgie, Georgie, do give over, 
Georgie now you frighten me: 
We'll spend our future days at Dover*, 
But I 
won't give over or let her be.

Then we march'd down to supper 
lii ' ristocratic style, 
The coaches on the outside 
Would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled 
Were the pride of our city, 
The solid men from ev'ry ward, 
Were at Higgins' Coterie. —Ref. 
; 
Reporters from the " Herald," 
The " Tribune,' and the " Sun," 
Took the names of all the ladies, 
Just when the ball begun; 
The Haleys and the Daleys, 
Myself, and Nell Mc' Gee, 
Were paraded in the papers, 
From Higgins' Coterie. — Ref. 
4 
There was Burns, the big distiller, 
M'c Bride, the alderman, 
And a 
wealthy Cuban lady, 
With diamonds on her hand; 
She walk'd around the ball-room 
Like a 
queen of high degree, 
All the wealth was represented 
At Higgin's Coterie. 
Ref. 
5 
At six o'clock next morning, 
The band played " Patrick's day," 
In horse-cars and in stages, 
The crowd all went away; 
It pulverized poor Higgins, 
And kill'd his family, 
He's living on free lunches 
Since he gave the Coterie.—Ref. 
Fanny Lucinda.

by PErm and W HITE in all the principal 
theatres in the United States. 
I 
fell in love with a 
saffron-colored girl, 
And I 
think the day I'll rue— 
She's freckled, she squinted, and her hair is red, 
And her eyes are Paris blue. 
She's a 
little bald-headed, but that's no sin, 
She looks just like a 
crane— 
With mouth like a 
tunnel, and nose like a 
funnel, 
And I'll tell to you her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why, it's Fanny Lucia Lucinda, 
Fanny Lucinda that's her name. 
(Repeat chorus.) 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, I 
know she'll drive me crazy; 
She's as playful and as lively as a 
goat. 
Her feet are like a 
camel's, went six month's without water, 
And her breath is strong enough to pull a 
boat. 
She's the champion high kicker, there's no one can lick her, 
She's a 
sort of a 
go- as-you-please. 
She's worth a 
million in her mind, her likes you'll never find, 
And you bet your life that she is just the cheese.

Who will share their last job with the poor so freely. 
In llickie you'll find one thing sure, 
It matters not wheree'er he goes, 
He'll always lend unto the poor, 
And welt the devil out of his foes; 
Yet one thing we'd love to see, 
bear ould Ireland, like America, free.

2. 
In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward; 
But shure for its beauty an Irishman's duty, 
Will teach him his own native plant to regard. 
St. Patrick he set it, with dewdrops he wet it, 
And often to cherish and bless it was seen, 
Its verdures are rare too, it's fresh and it's fair too, 
And blooms but in Ireland's own Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, &c. 
A 
sprig from each stem, forms a 
rich varied gem, 
More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn, 
Together unblighted unsullied united, 
It blooms a 
bouquet beauty's breast to adorn. 
Oh! long may they flourish, may heavens dews nourish, 
Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen, 
May no fatal blunder, o'er tear them asunder. 
But long be they wreath'd in the Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, AC-
Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireland,. 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun, 
For honor, for spirit, Fidelity, merit, 
For wit and good fellowship; frolic and fun. 
With wine and with whiskey when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen ; 
While with mirth overflowing., with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, & e.

He's got six months on the Island now, 
his time he'll have to serve; 
lie's up for highway robbery, 
Yon bet he's got the nerve. 
He's disgraced the whole of the family, 
And it makes ma sail to think; 
That he's gone to the Devil as fast as he can, 
Since he first took to drink.

When his time is up and he gets out, 
I 
hope he'll stay at home; 
Give up his obi companions, 
And leave all bad liquor alone. 
.For he's now in jail with nothing to do, 
And plenty of time to think 
Of the trouble he's caused his family,

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arrange 1. 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means o 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-coinmittal-
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too dit 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentoris 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPIT DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pan-es, or with any one of quite a succession 
of 
figures. 
pages, 
minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated. suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin. ,'
