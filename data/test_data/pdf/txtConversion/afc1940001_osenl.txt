OH SENHOR LADRAO
In this game the players join hands to form a circle in the centerof which stands a lone boy or girl
who is to be the "Senhor Ladrao" or"Mr. Robber". The ring revolves around him singing the song and
keepingin step with the music. The lone player or "Mr. Robber" sings the laststanza of the song and
at the words," ONE OF THE MADAMS I SHALL EMBRACE"he chooses a person from among those in
the circle and after embracingher, exchanges places with her. She then becomes the "Mr. Robber"
andthe game starts anew.
