 INTRODUCTION
 
Spring 1982 proved to be an ideal time  for studying  ethnic heritage
 
schools  in North Dakota,  as  their value was being discussed and debated
 
throughout the state.
 An awareness of the existence of these schools in the
 
Northern Great Plains region was precipitated by a Bureau of Indian Affairs
 
announcement  that  the agency was  closing a large,  off-reservation Indian
 
school in Wahpeton, North Dakota.  The announcement, made in February of this
 
year, also affected the status of similar Indian-run  (
but federally-funded)
 
schools in New Mexico and Oklahoma.
 The news of the projected closings of
 
these  institutions  drew national attention  and  forced  local  legislators,
 
educators,  minority-group  spokesmen,  ethnic  students,  and  citizens  from
 
diverse backgrounds  to articulate their feelings regarding ethnic heritage
 
schools. 2 
Besides creating an awareness of ethnic  schools  in North Dakota,  the
 
Wahpeton Indian School controversy prompted school administrators and others
 
to consider possible alternatives to ethnic-run educational institutions in
 
the face of federal cutbacks.
 Some officials,  for example,  discussed the
 
possibility of public school consolidation with Indian-staffed schools.
 The
 
real emphasis, however,  seemed to be on maintaining existing ethnic heritage
 
schools such as the Indian school in Wahpeton.
 By mid-June, a growing number
 
of non-Indian legislators had publicly declared their support for the Wahpeton
 
school,  including North Dakota representative Byron Dorgan, who admitted to
 
news reporters:
 "I didn't know much about that school myself until I got
 
involved in this issue.  .
 .
 .
 I wish everybody could see that school .
 .
 .
 it
 
would make all of us proud. "3
 
Although Wahpeton Indian School (which is about sixty miles south of my
 
present home in Fargo, North Dakota) was receiving widespread attention at the
 
2
 
time I applied for the ethnic heritage schools grant,  I chose to focus on a
 
relatively unknown school 220 miles to the southwest:
 Emmons Central [
Catho-
lic] High School in the small, German-Russian farming community of Strasburg,
 
North Dakota
 Nr decision was influenced hr a number of factors:
 (
1)  as an
 
assistant proressor o
r anthronciogy at North Dakota State University,  I teach
 
a four-credit,  upper division  course on  the  German-Russians and  thus  am
 
familiar with  the history,  culture,  folkways,  and language of  this ethnic
 
roup;  (
2)  I am myself  of  German-Russian descent,  although my  immigrant
 
randparents  settled  in  the  sugar beet  country of northeastern Colorado,
 
rather than in the wheat belt of the Dakotas; and (
3) I had previous knowledge
 
of German-Russian ethnic studies being taught at the Catholic high school in
 
Strasburg, North Dakota, and was very curious as to what German-Russian high
 
schoolers were studying about their own ethnic heritage.  Although I had never
 
visited the school in Strasburg before,  I had met the German-Russian studies
 
instructor, Mr. Les Kramer, on two previous occasions.
 
Before applying for the American Folklife Center grant,  I telephoned Mr.
 
Kramer  and  asked  him  if  he would permit me  to visit  and  observe  the
 
German-Russian studies class at the high school.  Mr. Kramer not only agreed
 
but offered to personally help in any way that he could.
 Thus, at 5
:45 a
.m.,
 
on April 13,  1982,  I set out for Strasburg,  North Dakota,  for the first of
 
four,  on-site visits.
 By the time my fieldwork ended,  I had covered  1
,810
 
miles by automobile, which required approximately 33 uneventful hours "behind
 
the wheel."  But in the course of my research, I was able to learn much about
 
an ethnic heritage  school  in the heart  of North Dakota's  German-Russian
 
country;  I met a number of very knowledgeable and hospitable people;  and I
 
established some important friendships that will withstand, I think, the many
 
miles of North Dakota prairie that lie between us.

II.
 THE GERMAN-RUSSIANS
 
The German-Russians comprise one of the larger ethnic groups in the Great
 
Plains region today.
 Descended from German colonists who first settled in
 
Russia during the 1760s at the invitation of Tsarina Catherine the Great,  the
 
German-Russians are particularly numerous in the Dakotas,  Nebraska, Kansas,
 
eastern Colorado,  and the Canadian prairie provinces.
 When they settled in
 
Russia, the German-Russians lived in closely-knit, agrarian villages that were
 
established along religious lines of affiliation  (
i.e.,  Lutheran, Reformed,
 
Roman Catholic, Mennonite, or Hutterite).
 For more than a century in Russia,
 
the German-Russians avoided intensive contact not only with their Russian and
 
Ukrainian hosts,  but also with German colonists living in neighboring vill-
ages.
 The major German enclaves in Russia included those of the Volga Germans
 
(Wolgadeutschen) established  in  1764-1767,  and  the  Black  Sea  Germans
 
(
Schwarzmeerdeutschen) established in the late 1780s and early 1800s. 4
 
The German colonists in Russia enjoyed decades of self-imposed isolation
 
until the reforms and Russification measures of Tsar Alexander II were imple-
mented  in  the  1870s.
 These  reforms  caused  thousands  of  German-Russian
 
colonist families to uproot themselves and emigrate to the New World.
 Having
 
prospered as grain farmers on the treeless Russian steppes, the German-Russian
 
emigrants were immediately attracted to the plains of North America and to the
 
pampas of South America.
 The German emigration from Russia, which began in
 
the mid-1870s, continued up to the time of the First World War (
1914).
 As in
 
Russia, the German-Russians who came to the New World tended to settle along
 
regional and religious lines of affiliation.
 Thus, one primarily finds Volga
 
German Protestants in Nebraska, Volga German Catholics in western Kansas, and
 
Black Sea Germans in the Dakotas.5
 
4
 
Presently,  there  is  no  way  of  determining  how  many  Americans  of
 
German-Russian descent reside in the United States (
due to census records that
 
rarely distinguish German-Russians from other Americans of German ancestry).
 
Yet,  German-Russians have become highly visible as an  identifiable ethnic
 
group in the Great Plains states, partially due to the success of two active,
 
ethnic organizations that boast  ever-increasing memberships:
 the American
 
Historical Society of Germans from Russia (AHSGR, founded in Colorado in 1968)
 
and the Germans  from Russia Heritage  Society  (
GRHS,  established  in North
 
Dakota in 1971).
 
III.  NORTH DAKOTA'S "GERMAN-RUSSIAN TRIANGLE"
 
German  emigration  from the  Black Sea  region of  South Russia,  which
 
occurred in the late nineteenth century,  coincided with the opening of U
.S.
 
homestead  lands  on  the  Northern  Great  Plains.
 By  1920,  some  70,000
 
German-Russians of the first and second generations were living in the state
 
of North Dakota alone. 6 Today, North Dakota has twice as many German-Russian
 
descendants as any other state in the union.
 When one considers  that  the
 
entire state of North Dakota has a combined population of only 652,437  (
1980
 
census),  one can imagine how numerous  the German-Russians  seem in  such a
 
sparsely-settled state.
 
While North Dakota attracted representative German groups from all of the
 
major settlement areas in Russia,  the vast majority came from the Black Sea
 
region near the port city of Odessa.
 The first German-Russians emigrated to
 
what is now North Dakota (
the area was then known as "Dakota Territory") as
 
homesteaders.
 Although they could not establish closed agrarian villages as
 
they had done  in Russia,  German-Russians who shared the same religion and
 
regional dialect  did establish their homesteads  in close proximity to one
 
5
 
another.
 Since some of the better farmlands along the wooded river valleys
 
already had been  claimed  by  Scandinavian  emigrants,  the  German-Russians
 
settled in the southern,  central,  and north-central portions of the state.
 
Upon looking at  a map of present-day German-Russian settlements  in North
 
Dakota,  these  communities  form what  has  been  called  "The  German-Russian
 
Triangle"  (
see  map  on  the  following  page).
 Most  of  the  state's
 
German-Russians  live within this "Triangle," in areas homesteaded by their
 
emigrant forebears less than a century ago.
 
IV.
 STRASBURG:
 CHAMPAGNE MUSIC ON THE PRAIRIE
 
The town of Strasburg, North Dakota, lies about 75 miles southeast of the
 
state capital (
Bismarck) and only a few miles north of the South Dakota line.
 
The  community was  established  in  the  spring  of  1889  by  German-Russian
 
homesteaders  who  named  the  struggling  pioneer  settlement  in  honor  of
 
Strassburg, their home colony in South Russia.  With the building of a nearby
 
railroad in 1902,  Strasburg gradually grew in size until  its  inhabitants
 
numbered 700 people in 1930.
 Yet, as in other small towns on the Northern
 
Great Plains,  the paucity of farms and jobs prompted many of the local youth
 
to  find employment elsewhere.
 Today,  the population  of  Strasburg,  North
 
Dakota, is about 614 (
1980 census).
 
Located in- the southern half of Emmons County,  Strasburg is in an area
 
densely populated by those of German-Russian ancestry.
 Neighboring communi-
ties,  such as Hague and Linton,  are well-known to North Dakotans as towns
 
where the "German brogue" remains a distinguishing characteristic.  While the
 
Strasburg area is primarily German-Russian and Roman Catholic,  there is a
 
small settlement of "Hollanders"  (who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church)
 
southwest of Strasburg.  Large numbers of Protestant German-Russians are found

NORTH DAKOTA
 
PRESENT-DAY GERMAN-RUSSIAN SETTLEMENTS IN NORTH DAKOTA.
 
Note:
 The black arrow in the south-central portion of the state marks
 
the location of the ethnic heritage school discussed in this paper  (
Emmons
 
Central High School in the town of Strasburg).
 
(map is from Richard Sallet's Russian-German
  
Settlements in the United States, i974J
 
7
 
only a few miles to the east, and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation
 
is  located due west  (
on the opposite side of Lake Oahe  and  the Missouri
 
River).
 
As one approaches  the prairie community of  Strasburg by car,  one  is
 
immediately  struck by  two  things:
 (
1)  the  immense  size  of  its  Catholic
 
church, the spire of which can be seen high above the trees and surrounding
 
structures; and  (
2)  the signs off Highway 83 that proudly call attention to
 
the fact that Strasburg is the hometown of music maestro Lawrence Welk.
 Born
 
in a clay-brick pioneer home near Strasburg, Welk grew up practicing an old
 
accordion brought from Russia by his father.
 Eventually, Lawrence Welk's shy,
 
reserved style and Emmons County "German brogue" became--like his champagne
 
music--well-known trademarks in the entertainment world.
 
01  3Lrasburg on  w±± within s
g nc  or  ba i nt s
 e
e r
 
and Paul Catholic Church,  stands Emmons Central High School.
 The pale-brick
 
building is one of two high schools in the small community of Strasburg that
 
are within easy walking distance of each other.
 Emmons Central is a parochial
 
school that serves the Catholic youth of Emmons County while the Strasburg
 
Public  School  is  administered by  the  local  school district.
 The  casual
 
observor who attempts to see Strasburg as a homogeneous ethnic community--
united by a common religion and  ethnic heritage--will be hard-pressed  to
 
explain the existence of two high schools  in such close proximity to one
 
another.
 
Upon checking available published sources regarding the history of the
 
two schools,  I found that the first school in Strasburg was a parochial one,
 
taught in 1910 in the basement of the parish church by Ursuline nuns from
 
8
 
Calvarienberg, Germany.
 In 1918, St. Benedict's Catholic School was  built by
 
the parishioners but there were no high school graduates until 1927.
 Due to
 
iinancjal problems,  the administration of St.  Benedict's  School was turned
 
over to the Strasburg School District in 1931.
 The Catholic parish did not
 
regain control of St. Benedict's School until 1960, the same year in which the
 
Strasburg Public School was established.
 In 1966, St. Benedict's High School
 
in Strasburg consolidated with St. Anthony's High School in Linton (
a neigh-
boring town to the north) and "Emmons Central High School" resulted.
 At the
 
time of this consolidation, Emmons Central High School was
 
subsidized
 
by all Catholic parishes in the county and .
 •
 .
 [
provided] an opportunity for
 
Catholic education to a student population from seven different parishes." 8 
The consolidation that occurred in 1966 has meant  that Emmons Central
 
High School is no  longer a community-based parochial school but a county-
based,  religious  one.
 Nonetheless,  all  of  the  students  who  attend  are
 
German-Russian.
 The Strasburg Public School,  in comparison, while it serves
 
many German-Russian students in the Strasburg area, also meets the needs of
 
non-Catholic, non-German-Russian students (
e.g., Dutch and Anglo-Americans).
 
The 1982 graduating class at the Strasburg Public  High School numbered 25
 
students and several of these were of Hollander background (with family names
 
such as Haan, Nieuwsma, and Van Beck).
 The 1982 graduating class at Emmons
 
Central High School, on the other hand, numbered 29 students, all of whom came
 
from  Catholic,  German-Russian  families  (with  surnames  like  Baumstarck,
 
Silbernagel, and Wikenheiser).
 
In light of the above facts,  it is perhaps not surprising that Emmons
 
Central High School offers a German-Russian ethnic studies class as an inte-
gral part of its curriculum.
 Indeed, Emmons Central High School can be seen
 
as belonging to that category of ethnically-affiliated institutions known as
 
9
 
"All Day Schools."  Joshua A
.  Fishman and Vladimir C
. Nahirny have described
 
these schools as
 
•
 .
 .
 offering complete educational programs that
 
fulfill the requirements of compulsory education laws
 
enacted by state and local educational authorities.  The
 
pupils attending these schools do not attend general
 
American public schools.
 
•
 .
 .
 many ethnically affiliated All Day Schools
 
provide instruction in the religious, cultural and lin-
guistic heritages of particular ethnic groups.
 Such in-
struction is given during the regular school day and is
 
over and above the general curricular requirements of
 
American education law.9
 
VI.  THE GERMAN-RUSSIAN ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS
 
Although I was able to observe the German-Russian ethnic studies class at
 
Emmons Central High School on three separate occasions,  I had to conduct
 
extensive interviews with the instructor in order to obtain a better idea of
 
the many topics covered.
 Mr. Les Kramer, principal of the high school and
 
instructor of  the German-Russian studies class,  told me  that he has been
 
teaching the class since 1974.
 Before coming to Strasburg, he taught high
 
school in the neighboring prairie town of Hague, where he first offered the
 
German-Russian studies class.  Although the high school in Hague was extremely
 
small  (
the 1982 graduating class numbered only seven students), Mr.  Kramer
 
considered it an "ideal school" because of the deep sense of local community
 
that predominata there.
 He pointed out that all of the German-Russian stu-
dents at the Hague High School "traced their heritage back to villages five,
 
six miles from each other in Europe." 1
0
 
In 1977,  Mr.  Kramer and several other high school teachers  in North
 
Dakota were awarded small stipends to expand or develop ethnic curriculum
 
materials at their institutions.
 The stipends, which were made possible by
 
special  funding  from the U
.S.  Office of  Education,  were  administered by
 
10
 
officials at the University of North Dakota  (
T
JND-Grand Forks).
 According to
 
Mr. Kramer, there has been no follow-up study or even any contact from the UND
 
granting office for the past three or four years.
 
In my conversations with Mr. Kramer, he pointed out that there is often
 
ambivalence  on  the  part  of  parents  and  even  students  regarding  the
 
German-Russian ethnic studies class.
 Since the course is an elective, junior
 
and senior high school students are free to choose whether or not they want to
 
pursue German-Russian studies at Emmons Central.  Mr. Kramer feels that there
 
are mixed feelings toward the class by some parents (
especially those in the
 
"forty -five-year-old  group")  because  they  do  not  appreciate  the  positive
 
aspects of German-Russian ethnicity.
 According to Mr. Kramer,  these parents
 
sometimes suffer from a negative self-image and thus do not want to be remind-
ed of who and what they are. "  Regarding the ambivalence of some of his own
 
students toward German-Russian studies, Mr. Kramer feels that a major problem
 
is that most German-Russian students at Emmons Central High School, who have
 
seldom come into prolonged contact with non-German-Russians--are simply "too
 
close" to their ethnic heritage.
 Mr. Kramer pointed out that only after the
 
students  leave  their German-Russian communities  and  live  elsewhere,  will
 
they--like the painter who steps away from a painting--begin to develop "a
 
full appreciation" of their heritage. 1
2
 
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High Scho'
 
ed by a general sociology class offered by Mr. Kramer during the first semes-
ter.
 He  indicated  that  the course  is designed  to sensitize  students  to
 
cultural differences and human diversity.
 The main text used in the general
 
sociology class  is  James D
.  Calderwood's  The Developing World:
 Poverty,  
Growth and Rising Expectations. 
Mr.  Kramer added that  the volume  is  the
 
subject of some controversy by other educators since "the United States does
 
11
 
not come out of that book smelling like roses." 
1
3  In Mr. Kramer's mind,  the
 
general sociology class taught at Emmons Central High School is something of a
 
prerequisite before delving into German-Russian cultural studies.  He indicat-
ed that he often tells his students at the outset of his classes to ask them-
selves three basic questions:
 
"
'Who am I
?  Why am I
?  What do I intend to do about both?'
 
Those are the questions we have to answer, in light of
 
what others are doing around the world.  Until you answer
 
those three questions, I tell the kids, life is really not
 
worth much."14
 
The German-Russian ethnic studies class is offered daily every second
 
semester from 1
1:00 a
.m. to 12:00 p
.m., under the official title "Internation-
al Relations."
 Mr.  Kramer feels  the course title is justified,  since he
 
continues to work basic sociological and anthropological concepts into the
 
German-Russian material (
e.g., examples of ethnocentrism, nuclear vs. extended
 
family patterns, etc.).  While Mr. Kramer makes use of a number of published
 
works  in the German-Russian studies class,  he focuses on three volumes  in
 
particular:
 Karl Stumpp's The German-Russians:  Two Centuries of Pioneering
  
(
Lincoln,  Neb:  AHSGR,  1978)--the  "main text"  used by  the  students;  Karl
 
Stumpp's The Emigration from Germany to Russia in the Years 1763 to 1862
  
(
Lincoln,  Neb:  AHSGR,  1978)--a large volume for genealogical research;  and
 
Joseph S
.  Height's Paradise  on  the  Steppe (
Bismarck,N.D.:  GR}IS,  1980)--a
 
cultural history  of  the  Catholic  Black Sea  Germans  in  South Russia.
 A
 
slide/sound program produced by the Germans  from Russia Heritage  Society,
 
entitled "At Home on the Prairies: the Germans from Russia" sometimes is used,
 
depending on its availability from the public library in the neighboring town
 
of Linton.
 In addition, Mr. Kramer distributes approximately seventy pages of
 
mimeographed handouts to the students  (
these include maps of German-Russian
 
1
2
 
settlements in the Old World and the New; illustrated essays on German-Russian
 
folk material culture; life histories; and booklists). 15  
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School is divided
 
into various topical areas of interest.
 The amount of time spent on these
 
subjects depends primarily on the interest  shown by students.
 Mr.  Kramer
 
explained that since every group of students is different, each German-Russian
 
studies class is somewhat different in regard to its format and emphasis as
 
well.
 The following is a breakdown of the various subject areas and activi-
ties covered by Mr. Kramer in the German-Russian studies class:
 
1
.  German-Russian Surnames. 
The course begins with an exami-
nation of the family names of German-Russian students in
 
the class.  Mr. Kramer attempts to show the students how
 
their German names derived from ancestral occupations, places
 
of origin, physical traits, etc.  According to Mr. Kramer,
 
"
[Sioux Indian names like] Red Bull and Chasing Hawk aren't
 
1
6
 
really any different than their [
the students'
 names.  .
 .
 . "
 
2
.  Map-making and Study. The students study the areas in Central
 
Europe where their forefathers originated; the migration route
 
from Germany to Russia; major German settlement areas in Russia;
 
German-Russian immigrant settlements in the New World;  and the
 
location of German-Russian settlements in North Dakota and spe-
cifically in Emmons County.

.
 Study of Living Conditions of German Colonists in Russia. About
 
this section, Mr. Kramer explained:
 "We really try to bring home
 
the living conditions .
 .
 .
 [
by considering the question] what was
 
it like to be a European peasant?.  .
 
4
.  German Language and Traditional Songs. A discussion of the
 
German-Russian dialects and folksongs.
 Sometimes, Mr. Kramer
 
teaches the students a German song that is later sung at a
 
German-Russian dinner prepared for the parents.  A typical
 
song might include the German-Russian funeral hymn "Das Schicksal
 
[wird keinen verschonen]" (
The Fate That Spares No One).  Mr.
 
Kramer noted that since fewer and fewer students speak or even
 
understand German, the language section is becoming increasingly
 
difficult to teach.
 
5
.  Material Folk Culture. 
Study of German-Russian folk architecture
 
and the making of Brennmist (
a fuel made from dried animal manure,
 
used by early German-Russian settlers in both Old Russia and the
 
Dakotas).
 In the past, the students have built models of a
 
Semelanka (
German-Russian earthen house); Backof en (
bake oven);
 
Ulmer Schachtel (
an emigrant boat used by the German emigrants
 
13
 
who went to Russia via the Danube); horse-drawn wagons, etc.
 
6
.  Homesteading "Game" 
This is an exercise that Mr. Kramer
 
adapted from a similar one used in some schools in Nebraska.
 
It is basically "a farming game" set in North Dakota from 1885
 
to 1887.
 "Students attempt to run a farm at a profit over a
 
three-year period."  Object of the game:
 "To provide the students
 
with some insight into the problems faced by homesteaders in the
 
1880s and to involve them in the decision-making process."  Each
 
student is given a scoring sheet and he/she attempts to farm and
 
invest successfully, in the face of unpredictable factors:
 
droughts, severe winters, grasshopper infestations, poor markets,
 
etc.
 
7
.  Discussion of Cultural and Personality Traits of the German-Russians.
 
In this unit, Mr. Kramer asks the students to identify some of the
 
dominant attributes of the German-Russians. A discussion often
 
follows regarding the contributed responses.
 The traits invariably
 
include such descriptive characteristics as:
 conservative; "closed-
off" or ethnocentric; religious; stubborn; "crazy-clean" [
an ob-
session with cleanliness]; etc.  Mr. Kramer admits that he often
 
plays the devil's advocate regardless of whether or not the sug-
gested trait is a positive or a negative one.
 
8
.  The German-Russian Dinner. Towards the end of the class, the
 
students prepare a German-Russian dinner for their parents and
 
invited guests from the surrounding communities.
 All of the
 
foods are homemade (including such table items as butter, ketchup,
 
etc).  Most of the dishes are prepared in the Home Economics Room
 
of the high school on the day that the dinner is held.  At this
 
year's dinner (which I attended), the following foods were pre-
pared and served to the assembled guests:  Kuchen (
cake);
 
Knoepfle Supp' (
dumpling soup); Fleischkuechle (
a deep-fried dough
 
and meat dish); Bratwurst (
home-made sausage); Sauerkraut und Nudle
  
Sauerkraut and noodles); and homemade ice cream.
 On the day of the
 
dinner, maps and exhibits made by the students were placed on dis-
play in the room where the dinner was held.
 In years past, enter-
tainment at this event has been provided by German-Russian singers
 
and musicians.  All of the German-Russian food brought to and pre-
pared at the school was donated by the parents of the students.
 
9
.
 Field Trip to German-Russian Sites in Emmons County. After the
 
students have examined some of the background German-Russian
 
history of their immediate area, Mr. Kramer takes the students on
 
a field trip so that they can see for themselves some of the sites
 
they have read about.  According to Mr. Kramer, the emphasis of
 
the field trip is on early German-Russian settlements in the southern
 
half of Emmons County:  Tiraspol, Elsass, Odessa, Katzbach, Krassna,
 
and Rosental.  At many of these locations, only a lonely cemetery
 
remains.  Mr. Kramer invariably directs the attention of the stu-
dents to the wrought-iron, decorative cemetery crosses that were
 
made by early German-Russian blacksmiths.  These crosses are an
 
important ethnic symbol and are readily identified as such even
 
by non German-Russians who travel through south-central North
 
14
 
Dakota.
 Mr. Kramer and the students also visit the few remaining
 
examples of German-Russian folk architecture in the area, including
 
a number of clay brick houses that were built by early German-Russian
 
homesteaders.
 
10.  Genealogy and Family History Research. Depending on the amount of
 
available time (
as well as student interest), Mr. Kramer encourages
 
the students to research their individual family backgrounds.
 Books
 
and other sources are recommended that can aid in the individual's
 
search for German-Russian genealogical data.  A general reading
 
list also is distributed and is intended for those students who
 
want to continue reading about the German-Russians at their own
 
leisure.
 
It is important to point out that the above breakdown is based wholly on
 
my own fieldwork and interviews with Mr. Kramer.  The topical areas covered in
 
the German-Russian class may be more flexible than the rigid manner which I
 
have identified them above.
 Mr.  Kramer indicated to me,  for example,  that
 
events such as the German-Russian dinner and the field trip are scheduled with
 
a number of other considerations  in mind  (
the agricultural cycle, weather,
 
student availability, etc.).
 
I was able to observe the German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central
 
High on three separate occasions:
 April  1
3  (
a day when the students were
 
making maps and planning the menu for the upcoming German-Russian dinner);
 
April 28 (
the day of the dinner); and May 6 (when I accompanied Mr. Kramer and
 
the students on their field trip).
 One of  the things  that  I found most
 
surprising about  the class was the emphasis on active participation rather
 
than mere listening or note-taking.  When I questioned Mr. Kramer about this,
 
he admitted:
 "I'm real big on '
doing,' if at all possible."18
 
On the day of the field trip, a strong, cold wind was blowing across the
 
prairie, sending tumbleweeds flying high above some distant rock piles erected
 
by early German-Russian settlers.
 While I thought such weather might force
 
Mr.  Kramer and his  students  to postpone the trip,  I soon found out  that
 
nothing could be further from Mr. Kramer's line of thinking.
 Following the
 
15
 
field trip, as we talked in the welcome warmth of his office back at the high
 
school, Mr. Kramer explained to me that a basic purpose of the field trip was
 
to give the students
 
a feel for the wind and the rocks and the psycho-
logical barrier they they [
the early German-Russian pio-
neers] ran into when they got here.  And on a day like
 
today .
 .
 .we can get a feel for that.  .
 .
 [when] there was
 
nothing out there but prairie, rocks, and wind .

VII.
 THE INSTRUCTOR
 
A description of  the  German-Russian ethnic  studies  course  at  Emmons
 
Central High School would be inadequate without further discussion of  the
 
instructor, Mr.  Les Kramer.
 A native son of Emmons County, Mr.  Kramer is
 
thirty-six years old.
 In addition to his responsibilities as principal of the
 
Emmons County High School,  he farms southwest of Strasburg in the Krassna
 
settlement area.
 He and his wife,  Colleen  (
nee Schmaltz), have two small
 
children.  Mr. Kramer's sense of the past is evidenced by the fact that he and
 
his family refurbished the old Strasburg train depot,  transforming it into a
 
comfortable rural home.
 
Both Mr. Kramer and his wife are former graduates of Emmons Central High
 
School.
 The Kramers'  oldest  child,  Nathan,  is a grade  schooler  at  St.
 
Benedict's, which adjoins the Catholic high school in Strasburg.
 
In my int&rvjews with Mr. Kramer, I discovered that his thesis that one
 
can appreciate an ethnic heritage only after one "steps away from it" is based
 
on personal experience:
 following military service and some long periods of
 
inner reflection in Southeast Asia, he returned to North Dakota and attended
 
the State University in Fargo.
 By the time he enrolled in college, he admits:
 
"I had reassessed all my values .
 .
 .
 my thinking."
 20
 
Since that time, he has
 
read and studied the history and culture of the German-Russians extensively.
 
Despite his deep appreciation of his e
thnic heritage, he has tried to maintain
 
"
balance" while  instructing his students about their German-Russian heritage.
 
He indicated on several occasions that he wants his students to consider many
 
different aspects of their heritage--both positive and negative--and how these
 
c
ontinue t
o influence their lives today:
 
"When we're through with this whole process, then the
 
thinking process hopefully takes over with [
the students]
 
and they begin t
o realize that much of the tradition that
 
wetve just s
tudied from the past is still very much a part
 
of them."21
 
In regard to the feedback that he receives from his students regarding
 
the German-Russian class, Mr. Kramer noted that there is seldom much immediate
 
response. 
As one who has studied the cultural dynamics of his own ethnic
 
group,  he realizes  that  compliments among  the German-Russians  are  rare,
 
particularly for those in the teaching profession:
 
"At the high school level, 
 
he rewards aren't 
 
reat
 
s you would like but 
 
h teach-
ing that's just the way it
 
s
.  It's not like 
 
ine, you
 
don't get daily 
 
doing.

I was able to observe Mr. Kramer and the students interacting on three
 
separate occasions.
 The first time was an April 1
3 class session when the
 
German-Russian dinner menu was being discussed and planned by the students.
 
At one point in the class, there was an interesting discussion about faithful-
ness to "German-Russian tradition."  Mr. Kramer had encouraged the students to
 
plan the German-Russian menu with authenticity in mind.
 Taking this as a cue,
 
a female student asked in a serious tone of voice if "redeye"  (
a home-mixed
 
grain alcohol beverage popular among many German-Russians)  could be served at
 
the school during the ethnic dinner.
 When Mr.  Kramer answered negatively,
 
another student drew laughter when she stated:
 "If we'de stick to tradition,
 
we'de all be getting drunk." 23
 
On April 28, the day of the German-Russian dinner at Emmons Central High
 
School, I watched and photographed the students as they prepared a four-course
 
menu.
 There were no German-Russian cookbooks present and at times the stu-
dents argued among themselves as how to prepare certain foods "the right way.
 
It became obvious that the real problem was not the usual recipe variations
 
found among German-Russian families, but some major differences due to the
 
fact  that a number of the students came from outlying parishes many miles
 
away.
 
On May 6
,  the day of the field trip, a number of the students rode with
 
me as we visited German-Russian sites in Emmons County.
 I was amazed that a
 
few of the students indicated they were seeing the sites for the first time
 
even though they had spent their entire lives in the county.
 My amazement
 
lessened as I realized that for some students, the sites we were visiting were
 
well outside of "their" settlement area.
 
While I was able to interview only two students from the German-Russian
 
studies class, their impressions proved t
o be of interest.  Both s
tudents (
who
 
were interviewed separately) indicated they were uncertain as t
o whether or
 
not they had learned anything in the class that would be of value t
o them in
 
later life.  Both agreed that the more satisfying s
egments of the class dealt
 
with the s
tudy of German family names; the map work; the "homesteading game";
 
and the discussion of German-Russian traits.
 Both students agreed with most
 
of the traits listed in class but felt i
t was an exaggeration to characterize
 
German-Russians  as being "crazy clean."
 One  student even commented:
 
didn't believe that too much .
 
-
 -
. I don't think we're cleaner than anybody
 
else._
L•1sU u  think we're dirtier,  really. 1
124
 For both  s
tudents, the
 
German-Russian studies class helped answer questions about their ancestors a
 
their past, particularly as i
t related to the Old Country:
 
"I knew beforehand that we [
our ancestors] went to Russia
 
but I didn't know we were that far south. I thought we
 
were in northern Russia.  Then I learned that some of the
 
climate [
in south Russia] was like California. 
I didn't
 
know that.  Thought it was c
old [
in South Russia] just like
 
I met the parents and grandparents of some o
� "
he s
tudents f
or t
he first
 
time on the day of the German-Russian ethnic dinner at Emmons Central High.
 
Following the meal and program, we talked informally about the German-Russian
 
ethnic s
tudies class.
 The parents seemed pleased with the efforts of their
 
sons and daughters  in hosting the dinner,  although this pride was never
 
articulated.  When I asked about the delicious foods we had just eaten, there
 
was only discussion among those present regarding culinary differences among
 
the German-Russians.
 
The most talkative and enthusiastic adult at the dinner proved t
o be none
 
other than Wendelin Wikenheiser, the 7
7 -year old grandfather of one of the
 
19
 
students.  Mr. Wikenheiser, whom I interviewed at length a few days later, was
 
born in South Russia and emigrated to North Dakota in 1903  (
along with his
 
parents)  at  eight  years  of  age.
 He  is  today one of  the  few surviving
 
Russian-born elders in the Strasburg community.
 
On the day of the German-Russian dinner, Mr.  Wikenheiser studied with
 
keen interest the maps and other materials that were on display at the high
 
school.
 Later, while interviewing him, he spoke of the German-Russian class
 
at  the Catholic high school as being "a pretty good idea."  He lamented,
 
however,  that the students at the high school were not studying the German
 
language more  intensely.
 He  confided that he  felt  it unfair  to have  to
 
translate everything into English for his "educated" grandchildren. 26
 
Upon talking with Mr. Wikenheiser, I found him to be somewhat ambivalent
 
d formal education, an attitude shared by many other German-Russians of
 
his generation.
 Mr. Wikenheiser's pride in the success of his old friend,
 
Lawrence Welk, was much evident and he obviously enjoyed talking about the
 
popular bandleader's early days in Strasburg.
 And, Mr. Wikenheiser was quick
 
to point out,  Strasburg's wealthiest and most famous native son "didn't have
 
much education." 27

 REFLECTIONS
 
Although I had done fieldwork among German-Russians prior to my research
 
at Emmons Central High School, never before had I studied the actual process
 
of conscious cultural transmission in so clearly delineated a setting.
 After
 
years of observing German-Russian people interacting at informal gatherings,
 
church services, wedding dances,  funeral dinners, and agricultural tasks,  it
 
was exciting to actually watch a German-Russian adult instruct young members
 
of his group about their ethnic heritage.
 (Now, many of the cultural values,
 
20
 
attitudes,  and perceptions shared by German-Russians--which i had tried so
 
hard  and  so  long  to  pinpoint  in  my  earlier  observations--were  being
 
identified, discussed, and scrutinized by the percipients themselves!)
 
An analysis of the data I collected during my fieldwork at Emmons Central
 
High School is difficult, as I only scratched the surface of what I quickly
 
discovered was  a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon.
 With each bit  of
 
information  that  I uncovered,  a score of related questions and lines  of
 
inquiry would  emerge.
 While  I realize  this  is  always  the  case  in any
 
scholarly endeavor,  I did not think studying one ethnic school would pose the
 
kind of challenge that it did.
 
In analyzing the format and the materials of the Geruian-Russian ethnic
 
studies class at  Emmons  Central High School,  I found  that  the class was
 
basically an honest, balanced attempt to convey some of the more prominent
 
aspects of German-Russian ethnicity to the students.
 It was refreshing to see
 
German-Russian  culture  being  presented  in  the  kind  of  down-to-earth,
 
nuts-and-bolts fashion many Black Sea German-Americans of the Dakotas pride
 
themselves in exemplifying.
 In the school room in which the German-Russian
 
class was taught,  for example, there were no colorful posters of mist-covered
 
castles in Germany;  no tall,  Bavarian beer stem s; no solemn-faced bust of
 
Wagner.  At the German-Russian dinner prepared and served by the students, the
 
foods were typfcally German-Russian (
e.g., Fleischkuechle); the music playing
 
in the background was a tape recording of a group of  local German-Russian
 
farmers singing traditional Old Country favorites like "Zu Strasburg" and "Wir
 
sitzen so froehlich beisammen";  most reassuring was  the  fact that not one
 
dirndl or even a pair of Lederhosen was anywhere in sight.
 
The fact  that  the  instructor of  the German-Russian  studies  class at
 
Emmons Central encourages the students to focus on specific aspects (
symbols?)
 
21
 
of  their  Slavic-influenced  heritage--rather  than  those  of  their  "German"
 
ancestry--is evidenced by the fact that a great deal of attention is directed
 
toward the making of models and artifacts that would mean little to most other
 
Americans  of  German ancestry  (
e.g.,  the  German-Russian  semelanka--earthen
 
house; the Ulmer Schachtel---U1m emigrant boat; and Brennmist--manure fuel).
 
While Mr.  Kramer and his students have chosen to focus on distinctive
 
aspects of their German-Russian heritage,  I believe something is gradually
 
taking  place  in  the  class  that  may  not  be  readily  apparent  to  the
 
participants.
 At times, "German-Russian culture" is discussed and v1ewec  as
 
if it were a truly homogeneous phenomenon.
 Since Emmons Central High School
 
is no longer a one-parish, community institution, it now draws German-Russian
 
students from settlement areas well outside of Strasburg.
 While many of the
 
Strasburg students trace their ancestry to the Kutschurgan Black Sea German
 
colonies,  a number  of  other  students  from  the  outlying  parishes  are
 
descendants  of  emigrants  who  came  from  the  Bessarabian  and  Crimean
 
German-Russian colonies.
 Regional differences  (
as manifested in dialects,
 
foodways, farming patterns, etc.) may lead to confusion on the part of those
 
German-Russian students whose community or family traditions do not always run
 
parallel to the material presented in class.
 At any rate, an outcome of the
 
German-Russian studies class at the high school may be a heightened awareness
 
of  "German-Russian identity"  in  its broadest  sense,  rather  than a vague
 
feeling for "one's traditions" at the purely local level.
 
In regard  to  the articulation of cultural values,  the seventh "unit"
 
covered  in  the  class  deals  directly  with  German-Russian  cultural  and
 
personality traits.
 This section of the course always provides a forum for
 
much student discussion about German-Russian values and attitudes as well.
 In
 
my interviews with two of  the  students,  both pointed out  that while  this
 
22
 
subject was an interesting one, it posed some problems since the students were
 
unable to see themselves as compared to "outsiders."  They admitted that their
 
contacts  with  non-German-Russians  were  quite  limited.
 Nonetheless,  they
 
agreed with most  of the German-Russian values and attributes discussed  in
 
class:
 industriousness;  a love  of  the  land  and  farming;  religiosity;
 
conservatism;  frugality; and stubborness.
 They disagreed with the instructor
 
that German-Russians were "crazy-clean," feeling this to be an exaggeration.
 
Other attributes,  such as  affability,  generosity,  and  sobriety,  were not
 
listed  as  characterizing  the  German-Russians.
 On  the  day  of  the
 
German-Russian dinner at the high school, a large circular poster graced the
 
front  of  the  room with  illustrations  of  a German-Russian  earthen home,
 
windmill, and plow.
 Two neatly-lettered German expressions appeared on the
 
poster:
 "Arbeit  macht  das Leben suess"  (Work makes  life  sweet)  and "In
 
A
nierika durch Gottes Gnade!"  (
In America through the  Grace of God!).
 A
 
smaller poster,  bearing numerous pictures of agricultural scenes, bore the
 
legend:
 "LANDSLEUTE--Part of our German-Russian Heritage as Farmers."
 
Another characteristic of the German-Russians, repeatedly pointed out by
 
Mr. Kramer, is their ambivalence toward formal education.
 This attitude was
 
explained as stemming from the past history of the German-Russians, since they
 
viewed schools (in Russia and later in the U
.S.) as threats to their cultural
 
and  religious  integrity.
 This  fear was  compounded by  the German-Russiar
 
belief that education was not essential for those engaged  in agricultura
 
pursuits.
 According  to  Mr.  Kramer,  such  attitudes  persist  and  are
 
contributing factors to the unstable financial situation of the Catholic high
 
school in Strasburg today.
 Mr. Kramer pointed out that many German-Russians
 
tend to be "tight-fisted" and consequently dislike "making pledges"; but at
 
the same time they want to see Emmons Central--" their school"--remain open.
 
23
 
Thus,  the future of the German-Russian studies class--and indeed that of the
 
very high school in which it is taught--remains an uncertain one. 28
 
Additional fieldwork and research regarding German-Russian ethnic studies
 
at  the  Catholic  high school  in  Strasburg needs  to be  done before more
 
observations or a truly in-depth analysis can be made.
 If time and financial
 
resources had allowed, I would have liked to interview all of the students in
 
Mr. Kramer's class, as well as those individuals who took the German-Russian
 
class  in years  past.
 Interviews  with  a larger number  of  parents  and
 
grandparents of the students also would be valuable, particularly interviews
 
with German-Russian Catholic parents who have chosen to send their children to
 
the public rather than the parochial school.
 Also,  fieldwork at other high
 
schools in the Great Plains states where German-Russian studies are taught
 
would provide a much-needed comparative perspective that  could yield much
 
information regarding the conscious transmission of German-Russian knowledge
 
in diverse regional and local settings.
 
Perhaps  the most  important  thing  that  I learned while  s
tudying  the
 
German-Russian class at Emmons Central,  is  that high school educators  can
 
offer both a well-balanced curriculum and an ethnic heritage component without
 
sacrificing program quality. 29  The students at Emmons Central High School are
 
free to choose whether to enroll in the German-Russian studies course; if they
 
decide to do  so,  they are able  to attend the class during regular school
 
hours.
 Furthermore, since basic anthropological and sociological concepts are
 
integrated  into  the  German-Russian  ethnic  studies  class,  it  serves  the
 
students in two important ways:
 (
1) by providing them a formal opportunity to
 
explore  various  facets  of  their  German-Russian  heritage;  and  (
2)  by
 
encouraging  the  students  to view  that  heritage  against  the  immense but
 
illuminating backdrop of human cultural experience.

y   Bureau of Indian Affairs
 
i
-
nnouneonent  that  thc'n.c
y was  closing  a large,  off-reservation  Indian
 
school in Wahpeton, North Dakota.
 The announcement, made in February of thi3 
J aaL
. ) also affected the status of similar Indian-run  (
but federally-funded)
 
schools in New Mexico and Oklahoma.
 The news of the projected closings of
 
these  institutions  drew national attention  and  forced  local  legislators,
 
educators,  minority-group  spokesmen,  ethnic  students,  and  citizens  from
 
diverse backgrounds  to articulate  their feelings  regarding ethnic heritage
 
schools. 2
 
Besides  creating an awareness of ethnic  schools  in North Dakota,  the
 
ahpeton Indian School controversy prompted school administrators and others
 
to consider possible alternatives to ethnic-run educational institutions  in
 
the face of federal  cutbacks.
 Some officials,  for example,  discussed  the
 
possibility of public school consolidation with Indian-staffed schools.
 Th
 
real emphasis, however, seemed to be on maintaining existing ethnic heritage
 
schools such as the Indian school in tahpeton.
 By mid-June, a growing number
 
of non-Indian legislators had publicly declared their support for the Wahpeton
 
school,  including North Dakota representative Byron Dorgan, who admitted to
 
news  reporters:
 "I didn't know much about that school myself until I got
 
involved in this issue.  .
 .
 .
 I wish everybody could see that school .
 .
 .
 it
 
would make all of u s prou

Although Wahpeton Indian School (which is about sixty miles south of my
 
present home in Fargo, North Dakota) was receiving widespread attention at the
 
time  I applied for  the ethnic heritage schools grant,  I chose to focus on a
 
relatively unknown school 220 miles to the southwest:
 E =ons Central  [Catho-
lic] High School in the small, German-Russian farming cci
unity of Strasburg,
 
North Dakota.
 My decision was influenced by a number of factors:

fni,r -rred t  upper  division  course  on  the Co m n Ru cians  and  thus  am
 
familiar with  the history,  culture,  folkways,  and  language of  this  ethnic
 
group;  (2)  I am myself  of  German-Russian  descent,  although my  immigrant
 
grandparents  settled  in  the  sugar beet  country of northeastern Colorado,
 
rather than in the wheat belt of the Dakotas; and (
3) I had previous knowledge
 
of German-Russian ethnic studies being taught at the Catholic high school in
 
Strasburg, North Dakota,  and was very curious as to what Ge r
man-Russian high
 
schoolers were studying about their own ethnic heritage.
 Although I had never
 
visited the school in Strasburg before,  I had met the Ger m
an-Russian studies
 
instructor, Mr. Les Kramer, on two previous occasions.
 
Before applying for the American Folklife Center grant, I telephoned Mr.
 
Kramer  and  asked  him  if  he would  permit  me  to visit  and  observe  the
 
German-Russian studies class at the high school.
 Mr. Kramer not only agreed
 
but offered to personally help in any way that he could.
 Thus, at 5
:45 a.m.,
 
on April 13,  1982,  I set out for Strasburg,  North Dakota,  for the first of
 
four,  on-site visits.
 By the time my fieldwork ended,  I had covered  1
,810
 
miles by automobile, which required approximately 33 uneventful hours "behind
 
the wheel."  But in the course of my research,  I was able to learn much about
 
an  ethnic heritage  school  in  the heart  of  North Dakota's  German-Russian
 
country;  I met a number of very knowledgeable and hospitable people;  and I
 
established some important friendships that will withstand, I think,  the many
 
miles of North Dakota prairie that lie between us.
 
II.
 THE GERMAN-RUSSIANS
 
The German-Russians comprise one of the larger ethnic groups in the Great
 
Plains region  today.
 Descended  from German colonists who  first settled  in
 
Russia during the 1760s at the invitation of Tsarina Catherine the Great,  the
 
German-Russians  are particularly numerous  in the Dakotas,  Nebraska, Kansas,
 
eastern Colorado,  and the Canadian prairie provinces.
 When they settled in
 
Russia, the German-Russians lived in closely-knit, agrarian villages that were
 
established along religious lines of affiliation  (i.e.,  Lutheran,  Reformed,
 
Roman Catholic, Mennonite, or Rutterite).
 For more than a century in Russia,
 
the German-Russians avoided intensive contact not only with their Russian and
 
Ukrainian hosts,  but also with German colonists living in neighboring vill-
ages.
 The major German enclaves in Russia included those of the Volga Germans
 
(Wolgadeutschen) established  in  1764-1767,  and  the  Black  Sea  Germans
 
(
Schwarzmeerdeutschen) established in the late 1780s and early 1800s. 4 
he German colonists in Russia enjoyed decades of self-imposed isolation
 
1 the reforms and Russification measures of Tsar Alexander II were imple-
mented  in  the  1870s.
 These  reforms  caused  thousands  of  German-Russian
 
colonist families to uproot themselves and emigrate to the New World.  Raving
 
prospered as grain farmers on the treeless Russian steppes, the German-Russian
 
emigrants were jiq pdtAtALy attracted to the plains of North America and to the
 
pampas of South America.
 The German emigration from Russia, which began in
 
the mid-1870s, continued up to the time of the First World War (
1914).
 As in
 
Russia,  the German-Russians who came to the New World tended to settle along
 
regional and religious lines of affiliation.
 Thus, one primarily finds Volga
 
German Protestants in Nebraska, Volga German Catholics in western Kansas, and
 
Black Sea Germans in the Dakotas.5
 
Presently,  there  is  no  way  of  determining  how  many  Americans  of
 
German-Russian descent reside in the United States (
due to census records that
 
rarely distinguish German-Russians from other Americans of German ancestry).
 
Yet,  German-Russians have become highly visible  as  an  identifiable  ethnic
 
group in the Great Plains states,  partially due to the success of two active,
 
ethnic organizations  that boast  ever-increasing memberships:
 the American
 
Historical Society of Germans from Russia (AHSGR, founded in Colorado in 1968)
 
and  the Germans  from Russia Heritage  Society  (GRHS,  established  in North
 
Dakota in 1971).
 
III.
 NORTH DAKOTA'S "GERMAN-RUSSIAN TRIANGLE"
 
a rr
nan  emigration  from  the  Black Sea  region  of  South  Russia,  which
 
occurred in the late nineteenth century,  coincided with the opening of U.S.
 
homestead  lands  on  the  Northern  Great  Plains.
 By  1920,  some  70,000
 
German-Russians of the first and second generations were living in the state
 
of North Dakota alone. 6 Today, North Dakota has twice as many German-Russian
 
d
€ 3cendants as any other state in the union.
 When one considers  that  the
 
e
 i
tire state of North Dakota has a combined population of only 652,437  (1980
 
census),  one can  imagine how numerous  the German-Russians  seem in  such a
 
sparsely-settled state.
 
While North-Dakota attracted representative German groups from all of the
 
major settlement areas in Russia,  the vast majority came from the Black Sea
 
region near the port city of Odessa.
 The first German-Russians emigrated to
 
what is now North Dakota  (
the area was then known as "Dakota Territory") as
 
homesteaders.
 Although they could not establish closed agrarian villages as
 
they had done  in Russia,  German-Russians who shared the same religion and
 
regional dialect  did establish  their homesteads in close proximity  to  one
 
another.
 Since  some of the better farmlands along the wooded river valleys
 
already  had  been  claimed  by  Scandinavian  emigrants,  the  German-Russians
 
settled in the  southern,  central,  and north-central portions of the  st
 
Upon  looking  at  a map of  present-day German-Russian  settlements  in Nor
 
Dakota,  these  communities  form what  has  been  called  "The  German-Russian
 
Triangle"  (
see  map  on  the  following  page).
 Most  of  the  state's
 
German-Russians  live within  this  "Triangle,"  in areas homesteaded by  their
 
emigrant forebears less than a century ago.
 
IV.
 STRASBURG:
 CHAMPAGNE MUSIC ON THE PRAIRIE
 
The town of Strasburg, North Dakota,  lies about 75 miles southeast of the
 
state capital  (Bismarck) and only a few miles north of the South Dakota line.
 
The  community  was  established  in  the  spring  of  1889  by  German-Russian
 
homesteaders  who  named  the  struggling  pioneer  settlement  in  honor  of
 
Strassburg, their home colony in South Russia.
 With the building of a nearby
 
railroad in  1902,  Strasburg gradually grew in  size until its  inhabitants
 
numbered 700 people in 1930.
 Yet, as in other small towns on the Northern
 
Great Plains,  the paucity of farms and jobs prompted many of the local youth
 
to  find employment  elsewhere.
 Today,  the  population  of  Strasburg,  North
 
Dakota, is about 614 (1980 census).
 
Located in the southern half of Emmons County,  Strasburg is in an area
 
densely populated by those of German-Russian ancestry.
 Neighboring communi-
ties,  such as Hague and Linton,  are well-known to North Dakotans as  towns
 
where the "German brogue" remains a distinguishing characteristic.
 While the
 
Strasburg area is primarily German-Russian and Roman Catholic,  there is a
 
small settlement of "Hollanders"  (who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church)
 
southwest of Strasburg.  Large numbers of Protestant German-Russians are found

NORTH DAKOTA
 
PRESENT-DAY GERMAN-RUSSIAN SETTLEMENTS IN NORTH DAKOTA.
 
Note:
 The black arrow in the south-central portion of the state marks
 
the location of the ethnic heritage school discussed in this paper (
Emmons
 
Central High School in the town of Strasburg).
 
[Map is from Richard Sallet's Russian-German  
Settlements in the United States, 1974)
 
7
 
only a few miles  to the east,  and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation
 
is  located due west  (
on  the  opposite  side of  Lake  Oahe  and  the Missouri
 
River).
 
As one approaches  the prairie  community of  Strasburg by car,  one  is
 
immediately  struck by  two  things:
 (
1)  the  immense  size  of  its  Catholic
 
church,  the spire of which can be seen high above the  trees and surrounding
 
structures;  and  (2)  the signs off Highway 83 that proudly call attention to
 
the fact that Strasburg is the hometown of music maestro Lawrence Welk.
 Born
 
in a clay-brick pioneer home near Strasburg, Welk grew up practicing an old
 
accordion brought from Russia by his father.
 Eventually, Lawrence Welk's shy,
 
reserved style and Emmons County "German brogue" became--like his champagne
 
music--well-known trademarks in the entertainment world.
 
V.
 THE SCHOOL: EMMONS CENTRAL HIGH
 
On the northwest edge of Strasburg and well within sight of Saints Peter
 
and Paul Catholic Church,  stands Emmons Central High School.
 The pale-brick
 
building is one of two high schools in the small community of Strasburg that
 
are within easy walking distance of each other.
 Emxions Central is a parochial
 
school that serves the Catholic youth of Emmons County while the Strasburg
 
Public  School  is  administered by  the  local  school  district.
 The  casual
 
observor who attempts to see Strasburg as a homogeneous  ethnic cornaunity---
r
eJ/jcra
 
united by a common
 and  .
t
.hnic heritage--will be hard-pressed  to
 
explain the existence of  two high schools  in such close  proximity to one
 
another.
 
Upon checking available published sources regarding the history of  the
 
two schools,  I found that the first school in Strasburg was a parochial one,
 
taught in 1910 in the basement of the parish church by Ursuline nuns from
 
C
 
Calvarienberg, Germany.
 In 1918, St. Benedict's Catholic School was  built by
 
the parishioners but there were no high school graduates until 1927.
 Due to
 
financial problems,  the administration of St.  Benedict's  School was  turned
 
over to the Strasburg School District in 1931.
 The Catholic parish did not
 
regain control of St. Benedict's School until 1960, the same year in which the
 
Strasburg Public School was established.
 In 1966, St.  Benedict's High School
 
in Strasburg consolidated with St. Anthony's High School in Linton (a neigh-
boring town to the north) and "Emmons Central High School" resulted.
 At the
 
time of this consolidation,  Emmons Central High School was
 subsidized
 
by all Catholic parishes in the county and •
 .
 [
provided] an opportunity for
 
Catholic education to a student population from seven different parishes. ,
8
 
The consolidation that occurred in 1966 has meant  that Emmons Central
 
High School  is no  longer a co m
munity-based parochial  school but a county-
based,  religious  one.
 Nonetheless,  all  of  the  students  who  attend  are
 
German-Russian.
 The Strasburg Public School,  in comparison, while it serves
 
many German-Russian students in the Strasburg area,  also meets the needs of
 
non-Catholic, non-German-Russian students (e.g., Dutch and Anglo-Americans).
 
The 1982 graduating class at the Strasburg Public  High School numbered 25
 
students and several of these were of Hollander background  (with family names
 
such as Haan, Nieuwsma, and Van Beek).
 The 1982 graduating class at Emmons
 
Central High School, on the other hand, numbered 29 students, all of whom
 - 
from  Catholic,  German-Russian  families  (with  surnames  like  Baumstarck,
 
Silbernagel, and Wikenheiser).
 
In light of the above facts,  it is perhaps not  surprising that Emmons
 
Central High School offers a German-Russian ethnic studies class as an inte-
gral part of its curriculum.
 Indeed, Emmons Central High School can be seen
 
as belonging to that category of ethnically-affiliated institutions known as
 
"All Day Schools."
 Joshua A.  Fishman and Vladimir C
. Nahirny have described
 
these schools as
 
offering complete educational programs that
 
fulfill the requirements of compulsory education laws
 
enacted by state and local educational authorities.
 The
 
pupils attending these schools do not attend general
 
American public schools.
 
many ethnically affiliated All Day Schools
 
provide instruction in the religious, cultural and lin-
guistic heritages of particular ethnic groups.
 Such in-
struction is given during the regular school day and is
 
over and above the general curricular requirements of
 
American education law.9
 
VI.
 THE GERMAN-RUSSIAN ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS
 
Although I was able to observe the German-Russian ethnic studies class at
 
P
r
r
-mons Central  High School on  three  separate occasions,  I had to conduct
 
extensive interviews with the instructor in order to obtain a better idea of
 
the many topics  covered.
 Mr.  Les Kramer,  principal of the high school and
 
instructor of  the German-Russian studies  class,  told me  that he has been
 
teaching the class since 1974.
 Before coming to Strasburg, he taught high
 
school in the neighboring prairie town of Hague, where he first offered the
 
German-Russian studies class.  Although the high school in Hague was extremely
 
small  (
the 1982 graduating class numbered only seven students),  Mr.  Kramer
 
considered it an "ideal school" because of the deep sense of local community
 
that predominatd there.
 He pointed out that all of the German-Russian stu-
dents at the Hague High School "traced their heritage back to villages five,
 
six miles from each other in Europe." °
 
In 1977,  Mr.  Kramer and  several other high school teachers  in North
 
Dakota were awarded small stipends  to expand or develop ethnic curriculum
 
materials at their institutions.
 The stipends, which were made possible by
 
special  funding  from the U.S.  Office of  Education,  were  administered by
 
officials at  the University of North Dakota  (UND-Grand Forks).
 According to
 
Mr.  Kramer,  there has been no follow-up study or even any contact from the UND
 
granting office for the past three or four years.
 
In my conversations with Mr.  Kramer, he pointed out that there is often
 
ambivalence  on  the  part  of  parents  and  even  students  regarding  the
 
German-Russian ethnic studies class.
 Since the course is an elective, junior
 
and senior high school students are free to choose whether or not they want to
 
pursue German-Russian studies at Emmons Central.
 Mr.  Kramer feels that there
 
are mixed feelings toward the class by some parents  (
especially those in the
 
"forty- five-year-old  group")  because  they do  not  appreciate  the  positive
 
aspects of German-Russian ethnicity.
 According to Mr.  Kramer,  these parents
 
sometimes suffer from a negative self-image and thus do not want to be remind-
ed of who and what they are. "  Regarding the ambivalence of some of his own
 
students toward German-Russian studies, Mr. Kramer feels that a major problem
 
is that most German-Russian students at Emmons Central High School, who have
 
s' dom come into prolonged contact with non -German-Russians--are simply "too
 
'
Lose" to their ethnic heritage.
 Mr. Kramer pointed out that only after the
 
students  leave  their German-Russian communities  and  live  elsewhere,  will
 
they--like the painter who steps away from a painting--begin to develop "a
 
full appreciation" of their heritage. 12
 
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School is preced-
ed by a general sociology class offered by Mr. Kramer during the first semes-
ter.
 He  indicated  that  the course  is designed  to  sensitize  students  to
 
cultural differences and human diversity.
 The main text used in the general
 
sociology  class  is  James D
.  Calderwood's  The Developing World:
 Poverty,  
Growth and Rising  Expectations. 
Mr.  Kramer added  that  the volume  is  the
 
subject of some controversy by other educators since "the United States does
 
1
]
 
not come out of  that book smelling like roses." 13  In Mr. Kramer's mind,  the
 
general sociology class taught at Emmons Central High School is something of a
 
prerequisite before delving into German-Russian cultural studies.
 He indicat-
ed that he often tells his students at the outset of his classes to ask them-
selves three basic questions:
 
"
'Who am I?  Why am I?  What do I intend to do about both?'
 
Those are the questions we have to answer,  in light of
 
what others are doing around the world.  Until you answer
 
those three questions, I tell the kids, life is really not
 
worth much."14
 
The German-Russian ethnic  studies class is offered daily every second
 
semester from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p
.m., under the official title "Internation-
al Relations."
 Mr.  Kramer  feels  the course  title  is justified,  since he
 
continues to work basic sociological and anthropological concepts  into  the
 
German-Russian material (e.g., examples of ethnocentrism, nuclear vs. extended
 
family patterns, etc.).
 While Mr. Kramer makes use of a number of published
 
works in the German-Russian studies class,  he focuses on three volumes  in
 
Particular:
 Karl Stumpp's The German-Russians:  Two Centuries of Pioneering
  
(Lincoln,  Neb:  ABSGR,  1978)--the  "main text" used by  the  students;  Karl
 
Stumpp's The Emigration from Germany to Russia in the Years 1763 to 1862
  
(Lincoln,  Neb:  AHSGR,  1978)--a  large volume  for genealogical research;  and
 
Joseph S
.  Height's Paradise  on  the  Steppe (Bismarck,N.D.:  GRHS,  1980)---a
 
cultural history  of  the  Catholic Black Sea  Germans  in  South Russia.
 A
 
slide/sound program produced by the Germans  from Russia Heritage Society,
 
entitled "At Home on the Prairies: the Germans from Russia" sometimes is used,
 
depending on its availability from the public library in the neighboring town
 
of Linton.
 In addition, Mr. Kramer distributes approximately seventy pages of
 
mimeographed handouts to the students  (
these include maps of German-Russian
 
12
 
settlements in the Old World and the New;  Illustrated essays on German-Russian
 
folk material culture;  life histories; and bookljsts). 15  
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School is divided
 
into various  topical areas of interest.
 The amount of time spent on these
 
subjects depends  primarily on  the  i.te
.rec.t  shown by  students.
 Mr.  Kramer
 
explained that since every group of students is different, each German-Russian
 
studies class is somewhat different in regard to its  format and emphasis as
 
well.
 The following is a breakdown of the various subject areas and activi
-
ties covered by Mr. Kramer in the German-Russian studies class:
 
1
.
 German-Russian Surnames. 
The course begins with an exami-
nation of the family names of German-Russian students in
 
the class.
 Mr. Kramer attempts to show the students how
 
their German names derived from ancestral occupations, places
 
of origin, physical traits, etc.
 According to Mr. Kramer,
 
"
[Sioux Indian names like] Red Bull and Chasing Hawk aren't
 
really any different th an  their [the students
'] names.
 .
 .
 16
 
2
.  Map-making and Study. 
The students study the areas in Central
 
Europe where their forefathers originated; the migration route
 
from Germany to Russia; major German settlement areas in Russia;
 
German-Russian immigrant settlements in the New World;  and the
 
location of German-Russian settlements in North Dakota and spe-
cifically in Emmons County.
 
3.
 Study of Living Conditions of German Colonists in Russia. About
 
this section, Mr. Kramer explained:
 "We really try to bring home
 
the living conditions .
 .
 .
 [
by considering the question] what was
 
it like to be a European peasant?.  .
 ."17

 t h e
 
German-Russian dialects and folksongs.
 Sometimes, Mr. Kramer
 
teaches the students a German song that is later sung at a
 
German-Russian dinner prepared for the parents.
 A typical
 
song might include the German-Russian funeral hymn "Das Schicksal
 
[wird keinen verschonen]" (The Fate That Spares No One).  Mr.
 
Kramer noted that since fewer and fewer students speak or even
 
understand German, the language section is becom
ing  increas
ing ly 
difficult to teach.
 
5.  Material Folk Culture. 
Study of German-Russian folk architec t
u
r
e
 
and the making of Brennmist (
a fuel made from dried animal manure,
 
used by early German-Russian settlers in both Old Russia and the
 
Dakotas).
 In the past, the students have built models of a
 
Semelanka (German-Russian earthen house); Backofen (
bake oven);
 
Ulmer Schachtel (an emigrant boat used by the German emigrants
 
13
 
who went to Russia via the Danube); horse-dra-n wagons, etc.
 
6
.
 Homesteading "Game". 
This is an exercise that Mr. Kramer
 
adapted from a similar one used in some schools in Nebraska.
 
It is basically "a farming game" set in North Dakota from 1885
 
to 1887.
 "Students attempt to run a farm at a profit over a
 
three-year period."  Object of the game:
 "To provide the students
 
with some insight into the problems faced by homesteaders in the
 
1880s and to involve them in the decision-making process."  Each
 
student is given a scoring sheet and he/she attempts to farm and
 
invest successfully, in the face of unpredictable factors:
 
droughts,  severe winters, grasshopper infestations, poor markets,
 
etc.
 
7
.  Discussion of Cultural and Personality Traits of the German-Russians.
 
In this unit, Mr. Kramer asks the students to identify some of the
 
dominant attributes of the German-Russians. A discussion often
 
follows regarding the contributed responses.
 The traits invariably
 
include such descriptive characteristics as:
 conservative; "closed-
off" or ethnocentric; religious; stubborn; "crazy-clean" [an ob-
session with cleanliness]; etc.  Mr. Kramer admits that he often
 
plays the devil's advocate regardless of whether or not the sug-
gested trait is a positive or a negative one.

.
 The German-Russian Dinner. 
Towards the end of the e4a
, the
 
students prepare a German-Russian dinner for their parents and c+
V
 
invited guests from the surrounding communities.
 All of the
 
foods are homemade (
including such table items as butter, ketchup,
 
etc).
 Most of the dishes are prepared in the Home Economics Room
 
of the high school on the day that the dinner is held.  At this
 
year's dinner (which I attended), the following foods were pre-
pared and served to the assembled guests:  Kuchen (cake);
 
Knoepfle Supp' (dumpling soup); Fleischkuechle (a deep-fried dough
 
and meat dish); Bratwurst (
home-made sausage); Sauerkraut und Nudle
  
Sauerkraut and noodles); and homemade ice cream.
 On the day of the
 
dinner, maps and exhibits made by the students were placed on dis-
play in the room where the dinner was held.
 In years past, enter-
tainment at this event has been provided by German-Russian singers
 
and musicians.  All of the German-Russian food brought to and pre-
pared at the school was donated by the parents of the students.
 
9
.
 Field Trip to German-Russian Sites in Emmons County. After the
 
students have examined some of the background German-Russian
 
history of their immediate area, Mr. Kramer takes the students on
 
a field trip so that they can see for themselves some of the sites
 
they have read about.  According to Mr. Kramer,  the emphasis of
 
the field trip is on early German-Russian settlements in the southern
 
half of Emmons County:
 Tiraspol, Elsass, Odessa, Katzbach, Krassna,
 
and Rosental.  At many of these locations, only a lonely cemetery
 
remains.
 Mr. Kramer invariably directs the attention of the stu-
dents to the wrought-iron, decorative cemetery crosses that were
 
made by early German-Fr  sian blacksmiths.
 These crosses are an
 
important ethnic symbo  and are readily identified as such even
 
by non German-Russians -.ho travel through south-central North
 
Dakota.
 Mr. Kramer and the students also visit the few remaining
 
examples of German-Russian folk architecture in the area,  including
 
a number of clay brick houses that were built by early German-Russian
 
homesteaders.
 
10.  Genealogy and Family History Research. 
Depending on the amount of
 
available time (as well as student interest), Mr. Kramer encourages
 
the students to research their individual family backgrounds.
 Books
 
and other sources are recommended that can aid in the individual's
 
search for German-Russian genealogical data.
 A general reading
 
list also is distributed and is intended for those students who
 
want to continue reading about the German-Russians at their own
 
leisure.
 
It is important to point out that the above breakdown is based wholly on
 
my own fieldwork and interviews with Mr. Kramer.
 The topical areas covered in
 
the German-Russian class may be more flexible than the rigid manner which I
 
have identified them above.
 Mr.  Kramer indicated to me,  for example,  that
 
events such as the German-Russian dinner and the field trip are scheduled with
 
a number of other considerations  in mind  (
the agricultural cycle,  weather,
 
student availability, etc.).
 
I was able to observe the Ge r
man-Russian studies class at Emmons Central
 
High on three separate occasions:
 April  13  (a day when the students were
 
making maps and planning the menu for the upcoming German-Russian dinner)
 
April 28 (
the day of the dinner); and May 6 (when I accompanied Mr. Kramer and
 
the  students on their field  trip).
 One of  the  things  that  I found most
 
surprising about the class was  the emphasis on active participation rather
 
than mere listening or note-taking.
 When I questioned Mr. Kramer about this,
 
he admitted:
 "I'm real big on '
doing,' if at all possible."18
 
On the day of the field trip, a strong, cold wind was blowing across the
 
prairie, sending tumbleweeds flying high above some distant rock piles erected
 
by early German-Russian settlers.
 While I thought such weather might force
 
Mr.  Kramer and his  students  to  postpone  the  trip,  I soon  found out  that
 
nothing could be further from Mr.  Kramer's line of thinking.
 Following the
 
field trip, as we talked in the welcome warmth of his office back at the high
 
school, Mr. Kramer explained to me that a basic purpose of the field trip was
 
to give the students
 
" .
 .
 .
 a feel for the wind and the rocks and the psycho-
logical barrier they they [
the early German-Russian pio-
neers] ran into when they got here.
 And on a day like
 
today .
 .
 .we can get a feel for that.  .
 .
 [when] there was
 
nothing out there but prairie, rocks, and wind .
 .

VII.
 THE INSTRUCTOR
 
A description  of  the  German-Russian  ethnic  studies  course  at  Emmons
 
Central High  School would be inadequate without  further discussion of  the
 
instructor, Mr.  Les Kramer.
 A native son of Emmons County, Mr.  Kramer is
 
thirty-six years old.
 In addition to his responsibilities as principal of the
 
Emmons County High School,  he farms southwest of  Strasburg in the Krassr
 
settlement area.
 
He and his wife,  Colleen' (n
'e Schmaltz),  have two small
 
children.  Mr. Kramer's sense of the past is evidenced by the fact that he and
 
'
his  family refurbished the old Strasburg train depot,  transforming it into a
 
comfortable rural home.
 
Both Mr. Kramer and his wife are former graduates of Emmons Central High
 
School.
 The  Kramers'  oldest  child,  Nathan,  is  a grade  schooler  at  St.
 
Benedict's, which adjoins the Catholic high school in Strasburg.
 
In my inteifviews with Mr. Kramer, I discovered that his thesis that one
 
can appreciate an ethnic heritage only after one "steps away from it" is based
 
on personal experience:
 following military service and some long periods of
 
inner reflection in Southeast Asia, he returned to North Dakota and attended
 
the State University in Fargo.
 By the time he enrolled in college, he admits:
 
"1 had reassessed all my values .
 .
 .  my thinking." 20  Since that time, he has
 
read and studied the history and culture of the German-Russians extensively.
 
16
 
Despite his deep appreciation of his ethnic heritage, he has tried to maintain
 
"balance" while
 instructing his students about their German-Russian heritage.
 
He indicated on several occasions that he wants his students to consider many
 
different aspects of their heritage--both positive and negative--and how these
 
continue to influence their lives today:
 
"When we're through with this whole process,  then the
 
thinking process hopefully takes over with [
the students]
 
and they begin to realize that much of the tradition that
 
we've just studied from the past is still very much a part
 
of them."21
 
In regard to the feedback that he receives from his students regarding
 
the German-Russian class, Mr. Kramer noted that there is seldom much i
tzmediate
 
response.
 As one who has  studied the cultural dynamics of his own ethnic
 
group,  he  realizes  that  compliments  among  the  German-Russians  are  rare,
 
particularly for those in the teaching profession:
 
"At the high school level, the rewards aren't that great
 
there aren't as many as you would like but with teach-
ing that's just the way it is.
 It's not like medicine, you
 
don't get daily feedback on what a great job you're doing.
 
You may never hear it for twenty years, and then only a com-
ment in passing that you had some influence on a person's
 
life."22
 
VIII.
 THE STUDENTS
 
The students in Mr.  Kramer's most recent German-Russian ethnic studies
 
class numbered ten individuals,  ranging in age from 16 to 18.
 They included:
 
Sam Gross  (
a senior from St.  Michael's parish,  northeast of Linton,  N.D.);
 
Gerald Holzer and Dale Hom er  (seniors from St.  Anthony's parish,  Linton);
 
Sheila Nagel  (a  senior  from  Strasburg);  Annette Roehrich  (a junior  from
 
Strasburg);  Josephine Vetter  (a  senior from St.  Michael's);  Rose Vetter  (a
 
junior  from St.  Michael's);  Mark yolk  (
a  senior  from  Hague,  N.D.);  and
 
Katherine Wikenheiser (
a junior from Strasburg).
 
I was able  to observe Mr.  Kramer and the students interacting on three
 
separate occasions.
 The  first  time was an April  1
3 class session when the
 
German-Russian dinner menu was being discussed and planned by the students.
 
At one point in the class, there was an interesting discussion about faithful-
ness to "German-Russian tradition."  Mr. Kramer had encouraged the students to
 
plan the German-Russian menu with authenticity in mind.
 Taking this as a cue,
 
a female student asked in a serious tone of voice if "redeye"  (
a home-mixed
 
grain alcohol beverage popular among many German-Russians) could be served at
 
the  school during the ethnic dinner.
 When Mr. Kramer answered negatively,
 
another student drew laughter when she stated:
 "If we'd / stick to tradition,
 
we'd/all be getting drunk." 23
 
On April 28,  the day of the German-Russian dinner at Emmons Central High
 
School, I watched and photographed the students as they prepared a four-course
 
menu.
 There were no German-Russian cookbooks present and at times the stu-
dents argued among themselves as how to prepare certain foods "the right way."
 
It became obvious that the real problem was not the usual recipe variations
 
found among German-Russian families, but some major differences due to the
 
fact  that a number of the students came from outlying parishes many miles
 
away.
 
On May 6,  the day of the field trip, a number of the students rode with
 
me as we visited German-Russian sites in Emmons County.
 I was amazed that a
 
few of the students indicated they were seeing the sites for the first time
 
even though they had spent their entire lives in the county.
 My amazement
 
lessened as I realized that for some students, the sites we were visiting were
 
well outside of "their" settlement area.
 
While I was able to interview only two students from the German-Russian
 
studies class,  their impressions proved to be of interest.
 Both students  (who
 
were  interviewed separately)  indicated they were uncertain as to whether or
 
not they had learned anything in the class that would be of value to them in
 
later life.
 Both agreed that the more satisfying segments of the class dealt
 
with the study of German family names;  the map work;  the "homesteading game";
 
and the discussion of German-Russian traits.
 Both students agreed with most
 
of the traits listed in class but felt it was an exaggeration to characterize
 
German-Russians  as being  "crazy  clean."
 One  student  even commented:
 "I
 
didn't believe that too much
 
I don't think we're cleaner than anybody
 
else.
 I would  think we're  dirtier,  really." 24
 
For  both  students,  the
 
German-Russian studies class helped answer questions about their ancestors and
 
their past, particularly as it related to the Old Country:
 
"I knew beforehand that we [
our ancestors] went to Russia
 
but I didn't know we were that far south.
 I thought we
 
were in northern Russia.
 Then I learned that some of the
 
climate [in south Russia] was like California.
 I didn't
 
know that.
 Thought it was cold [in South Russia] just like
 
North Dakota."25
 
IX.
 THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS
 
I met the parents and grandparents of some of the students for the first
 
time on the day of the German-Russian ethnic dinner at Emmons Central High.
 
Following the meal and program, we talked informally about the German-Russian
 
ethnic studies class.
 The parents seemed pleased with the efforts of their
 
sons  and daughters  in hosting  the dinner,  although this  pride was never
 
articulated.  When I asked about the delicious foods we had just eaten,  there
 
was only discussion among those present regarding culinary differences among
 
the German-Russians.
 
The most talkative and enthusiastic adult at the dinner proved to be none
 
other than Wendelin Wikenheiser,  the '
.Z-year old grandfather of one of  the
 
19
 
students.
 Mr.  Wikenheiser, whom I interviewed at length a few days later, was
 
born in South Russia and emigrated to North Dakota in 1903  (along with his
 
parents)  at  eight  years of  age.
 He  is  today  one  of  the  few surviving
 
Russian-born elders in the Strasburg community.
 
On the day of  the German-Russian dinner, Mr.  Wikenheiser studied with
 
keen interest the maps and other materials that were on display at the high
 
school.
 Later, while interviewing him, he spoke of the German-Russian class
 
at  the Catholic high school as being "a pretty good  idea."
 He  lamented,
 
however,  that  the  students at the high school were not studying the German
 
language more  intensely.
 He  confided  that he  felt  it  unfair to have  to
 
translate everything into English for his "educated" grandchildren.
 26
 
Upon talking with Mr. Wikenheiser, I found him to be somewhat ambivalent
 
toward formal education, an attitude shared by many other German-Russians of
 
his generation.
 Mr. Wikenheiser's pride in the success of his old friend,
 
Lawrence Welk,  was much evident and he obviously enjoyed talking about the
 
popular bandleader's early days in Strasburg.
 And, Mr. Wikenheiser was quick
 
to point out,  Strasburg's wealthiest and most famous native son "didn't have
 
much education." 27

 REFLECTIONS
 
Although I had done fieldwork among German-Russians prior to my research
 
at Emmons Central High School, never before had I studied the actual process
 
of conscious cultural transmission in so clearly delineated a setting.
 After
 
years of observing German-Russian people interacting a
Tt informal gatherings,
 
church services, wedding dances,  funeral dinners, and agricultural tasks,  it
 
was exciting to actually watch a German-Russian adult instruct young members
 
of his group about their ethnic heritage.
 (Now, many of the cultural values,
 
20
 
attitudes,  and  perceptions  shared by German-Russians--which I had  tried  so
 
hard  and  so  long  to  pinpoint  in  my  earlier  observations--were  being
 
identified, discussed, and scrutinized by the percipients themselves!)
 
An analysis of the data I collected during my fieldwork at Emmons Central
 
High School is difficult,  as I only scratched the surface of what I quickly
 
discovered was  a complex and multi-faceted  phenomenon.
 With each bit  of
 
information  that  I uncovered,  a score of  related  questions and  lines  of
 
inquiry would  emerge.
 While  I realize  this  is  always  the  case  in  any
 
scholarly endeavor,  I did not think studying one ethnic school would pose the
 
kind of challenge that it did.
 
In analyzing the format and the materials of the German-Russian ethnic
 
studies class  at  Emmons  Central High School,  I found  that  the class was
 
basically an honest, balanced attempt to convey some of the more prominent
 
aspects of German-Russian ethnicity to the students.
 It was refreshing to see
 
German-Russian  culture  being  presented  in  the  kind  of  down-to-earth,
 
nuts-and-bolts fashion many Black Sea German-Americans of  the Dakotas pride
 
themselves in exemplifying.
 In the school room in which the German-Russian
 
class was taught,  for example,  there were no colorful posters of mist-covered
 
castles in Germany;  no tall,  Bavarian beer stem s;  no solemn-faced bust of
 
Wagner.
 At the German-Russian dinner prepared and served by the students, the
 
foods were typically German-Russian (
e.g., Fleischkuechle); the music playing
 
in the background was a tape recording of a group of  local German-Russian
 
farmers singing traditional Old Country favorites like "Zu Strasburg" and "Wir
 
sitzen so froehlich beisammen"; most reassuring was  the  fact  that not one
 
dirndl or even a pair of Lederhosen was anywhere in sight.
 
The  fact  that  the  instructor of  the  German-Russian  studies  class  at
 
Emmons Central encourages the students to focus on specific aspects (
symbols?)
 
of  their  S
lavic-i f1ucnced  heritage--rather  than  those  of  their  1Ger in'
 
ancestry--is evidenced by the fact that a great deal of attention is direct
 
toward the making of models and artifacts that would mean little to most other
 
Americans  of  German  ancestry  (e.g.,  the  German-Russian  emelanka--earthen
 
house; the Ulmer Schachtel--Ulm emigrant boat; and Brennmist--manure fuel).
 
While Mr.  Kramer and his students have chosen to  focus on distinctive
 
aspects of  their German-Russian heritage,  I believe something is gradually
 
taking  place  in  the  class  that  may  not  be  readily  apparent  to  the
 
participants.
 At times,  "German-Russian culture" is discussed and viewed as
 
if it were a truly homogeneous phenomenon.
 Since Emmons Central High School
 
is no longer a one-parish, community institution, it now draws German-Russian
 
students from settlement areas well outside of Strasburg.
 While many of the
 
Strasburg students trace their ancestry to the Kutschurgan Black Sea German
 
colonies,  a number  of  other  students  from  the  outlying  parishes  are
 
descendants  of  emigrants  who  came  from  the  Bessarabian  and  Crimean
 
German-Russian colonies.
 Regional differences  (
as manifested  in dialects,
 
foodways, farming patterns,  etc.) may lead to confusion on the part of those
 
German-Russian students whose community or family traditions do not always run
 
parallel to the material presented in class.
 At any rate, an outcome of the
 
German-Russian studies class at the high school may be a heightened awareness
 
of  "German-Russian  identity"  in  its broadest  sense,  rather  than a vague
 
feeling for "one's traditions" at the purely local level.
 
In regard  to  the articulation of cultural values,  the  seventh "unit"
 
covered  in  the  class  deals  directly  with  German-Russian  cultural  and
 
personality traits.
 This section of the course always provides a forum for
 
much student discussion about German-Russian values and attitudes as well.
 In
 
my interviews with two of  the  students,  both pointed out  that while  this
 
22
 
subject was an interesting one,  it  posed some problems since the students were
 
unable to see themselves as compared to "outsiders."  They admitted that their
 
contacts  with  non-German-Russians  were  quite  limited.
 Nonetheless,  they
 
agreed with most  of  the German-Russian values and attributes discussed  in
 
class:
 industriousness;  a love  of  the  land  and  farming;  religiosity;
 
conservatism;  frugality; and stubborness.
 They disagreed with the instructor
 
that German-Russians were "crazy-clean," feeling this to be an exaggeration.
 
Other attributes,  such as  affability,  generosity,  and  sobriety,  were  not
 
listed  as  characterizing  the  German-Russians.
 On  the  day  of  the
 
German-Russian dinner at the high school, a large circular poster graced the
 
front  of  the  room with  illustrations  of  a German-Russian  earthen home,
 
windmill,  and plow.
 Two neatly-lettered German expressions appeared on the
 
poster:
 "Arbeit  macht  das  Leben  suess"  (Work makes  life  sweet)  and  "In
 
Amerika durch Gottes  Gnade!"  (
In America  through  the  Grace  of  God!).
 A
 
smaller poster,  bearing numerous pictures of agricultural scenes, bore  the
 
legend:
 "LAND 
SLEUTE--Part of our German-Russian Heritage as Farmers.
 
Another characteristic of the German-Russians, repeatedly pointed out by
 
Mr.  Kramer,  is their ambivalence toward formal education.
 This attitude was
 
explained as stemming from the past history of the German-Russians, since they
 
viewed schools  (in Russia and later in the U.S.) as threats to their cultural
 
and  religious  integrity.
 This  fear was  compounded by  the German-Russian
 
belief  that  education was not essential for those engaged  in agricultural
 
pursuits.
 According  to  Mr.  Kramer,  such  attitudes  persist  and  are
 
contributing factors to the unstable financial situation of the Catholic high
 
school in Strasburg today.
 Mr. Kramer pointed out that many German-Russians
 
tend to be "tight-fisted" and consequently dislike "making pledges"; but at
 
the same time they want to see Emmons Central--"their school"--remain open.
 
23
 
Thus,  the future of the German-Russian studies class--and indeed that of the
 
very high school in which it is taught--remains an uncertain one. 28
 
Additional fieldwork and research regarding German-Russian ethnic studies
 
at  the  Catholic  high  school  in  Strasburg  needs  to  be  done before  more
 
observations or a truly in-depth analysis can be made.
 If time and financial
 
resources had allowed,  I would have liked to interview all of the students in
 
Mr. Kramer's class,  as well as those individuals who took the German-Russian
 
class  in  years  past.
 Interviews with a larger  number  of  parents  and
 
grandparents of  the students also would be valuable, particularly interviews
 
with German-Russian Catholic parents who have chosen to send their children to
 
the public rather than the parochial school.
 Also,  fieldwork at other high
 
schools in the Great Plains  states where German-Russian studies are taught
 
would  provide  a much-needed  comparative perspective  that  could yield  nuch
 
information regarding the conscious transmission of German-Russian knowled.'
 
in diverse regional and local settings.
 
Perhaps  the  most  important  thing that  I learned while  studying  the
 
German-Russian  class at  Emmons Central,  is  that high  school educators  can
 
E
fer both a well-balanced curriculum and an ethnic heritage component without
 
sacrificing program quality. 29  The students at Emmons Central High School are
 
free to choose whether to enroll in the German-Russian studies course;  if they
 
decide  to do  so,  they are able to attend the class during regular school
 
hours.
 Furthermore, since basic anthropological and sociological concepts are
 
integrated  into  the  German-Russian  ethnic  studies  class,  it  serves  the
 
students in two important ways:
 (
1) by providing them a formal opportunity to
 
explore  various  facets  of  their  German-Russian  heritage;  and  (2)  by
 
encouraging  the  students  to  view  that  heritage  against  the  i
mmense  but
 
illuminating backdrop of human cultural experience.

GERMAN—RUSSIAN ETHNIC STUDIES AT EMMONS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL
 
Strasburg, North Dakota
 
Final Report by Timothy J
. Kloberdanz
 
The German-Russians comprise one of the larger ethnic groups in
 
the Great Plains region today. Descended from German colonists who
 
first settled in Russia during the 1
760s at the invitation of Czarina
 
Catherine the Great, the German-Russians are particularly numerous in
 
the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, eastern Colorado, and the Canadian
 
prairie provinces.
 
When they settled in Russia, the German-Russians lived in
 
closely-knit, agrarian villages that were establishe. along religious
 
lines of affiliation (i.e., Lutheran , 
Reformed, Roman Catholic,
 
Mennonite, or Hutterite). For more than a century in Russia, the
 
German-Russians avoided intensive contact, not only with their Russian
 
and Ukrainian hosts, but also with German colonists living in
 
neighboring villages. The major German enclaves in Russia included
 
those of the Volga Germans (Wolgadeutschen), established in 1
764-
1
767, and the Black Sea Germans (Schwarzmeerdeutschen), established
 
in the late 1
780s and early 1
800s.1
 
A
 
The German colonists in Russia enjoyed decades of self-imposed
 
Ts
 
isolation, until the reforms and Russification measures of Czar
 
Alexander II were implemented in the 1870s. These reforms caused
 
thousands' of German-Russian colonist families to uproot themselves and
 
,
/
 
emigrate to the New World. Having prospered as grain fa
,rr
ners on the
 
treeless Russian steppes, the German-Russian emigrants were attracted
 
to the plains of North America and to the pampas of South America.
 
The German emigration from Russia began in the mid-1870s and
 
V
 
2
 
continued until World War I
. As in Russia, the German-Russians who
 
came to the New World tended to settle along regional and religious
 
lines of affiliation. Thus, one primarily finds Volga German
 
Protestants in Nebraska, Volga German Catholics in western Kansas, and
 
Black Sea Germans in the Dakotas.2

There is no way of determining how many Americans of
 
German-Russian descent presently reside in the United States, due to VeCQ-
census records that rarely distinguish German-Russians from other
 
Americans of German ancestry. Yet, German-Russians have become a

/' 
highly identifiable ethnic group in the Great Plains states, partially
 
due to the success of two active, ethnic organizations that boast
 
ever-increasing memberships:  The American Historical Society of
 
Germans from Russia (AHSGR), founded in Colorado in 1968, and the
 
Germans from Russia Heritage Society (GRI-I
S), established in North
 
Dakota in 1971.
 
German emigration from the Black Sea region of South Russia
 
coincided with the opening of United States homestead lands on the
 
northern Great Plains. By 1920 some 70,000 German-Russians of the
 
first and second generations were living in the state of North Dakota

alone.3 Today North Dakota,çhas twice as many German-Russian
 
descendants as any other state in the union. When one considers that
 
the entire state of North Dakota has a combined population of only
 
652,437 (1980 census), one can imagine how numerous the
 
German-Russians seem in such a sparsely-settled area.

While North Dakota attracted representative German groups from
 
all of the major settlement areas in Russia, the vast majority came
 
from the Black Sea region ear the port city of Odessa. The first
 
e ? i/
 
German-Russians emigrated to what was then "Dakota Territory" as
 
homesteaders. Although they could not establish closed agrarian
 
villages as they had done in Russia, German-Russians who shared the
 
same religion and regional dialect did establish their homesteads in
 
close proximity to one another. Since some of the better farmlands
 
along the wooded river valleys already had been claimed by
 
Scandinavian immigrants, the German-Russians settled in the southern,
 
central, and north-central portions of the state. Their communities
 
form what has been called the "German-Russian Triangle." Most of the
 
state's German-Russians live within this triangular portion of the
 
state in areas homesteaded by their immigrant forebears less than a
 
century ago.
 
The town of Stxasburg, North Dakota lies -
abo&rE 75 miles
 
\
 
southeast of t
F  Bismarck, the state capital, and o4ly- a fcw miles
 
north of the South Dakota line. The community was established in the
 
spring of 1889 by German-Russian homesteaders, who named the
 
struggling pioneer settlement in honor of Strassburg, their home
 
colony in South Russia. With the building of a nearby railroad in
 
1
902, Strasburg gradually grew in size until its inhabitants numbered
 
700 people in 1
930.4 Yet, as in other small towns on the northern
 
Great Plains, the paucity of farms and jobs prompted many of the local
 
youth to find employment elsewhere. Today, the pøpulation of
 
Strasburg, North Dakota is approximately 6-14 (
1980 census).
 V

Located in the southern half of Emmons County, Strasburg is in
 
an area densely populated by people of German-Russian ancestry.
 
Neighboring communities, such as Hague and Linton, are well known to
 
North Dakotans as towns where the "German brogue" remains a
 
distinguishing characteristic. While the Strasburg area is primarily
 
German-Russian and Roman Catholic, there is a small settlement of
 
"Hollanders" (who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church) southwest of
 
Strasburg. Large numbers of Protestant German-Russians are found only
 
a few miles to the east, and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation
 
is located due west, across Lake Oahe and the Missouri River.
 
As one approaches the prairie community of Strasburg by car,
 
one is immediately struck by two things: the immense size of its
 
Catholic church, the spire of which can be seen high above the trees
 
and surrounding structures; and the signs off Route 83 that proudly
 
call attention to the fact that Strasburg is the hometown of music
 
maestro Lawrence Welk. Born in a clay-brick pioneer home near
 
Strasburg, Welk grew up practicing an old accordion brought from
 
Russia by his father. Eventually, Lawrence Welk's shy, reserved
 
style, Emmons County "German brogue," and champagne music became well
 
known trademarks in the entertainment world.
 
5
 
Enimons Central High
 
On the northwest edge of Strasburg and well within sight of
 
Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church, stands Emmons Central High
 
School. The pale-brick building is one of two high schools in the
 
small community of Strasburg that are within easy walking distance of
 
each other. Emmons Central is a parochial school that serves the
 
Catholic youth of Emmons County, while the Strasburg Public School is
 
administered by the local school district. The casual observor who
 
attempts to see Strasburg as a homogeneous ethnic community —united by
 
a common religious and cultural heritage--will be hard pressed to
 
explain the existence of two high schools in such close proximity to
 
one another.
 
Upon checking available published sources regarding the history
 
of the two schools, I found that the first school in Strasburg was
 
parochial, taught in 1910 in the basement of the parish church by
 
Ursuline nuns from Calvarienberg, Germany. In 1
918, St. Benedict
 
Catholic School was built by the parishioners, but there were no high
 
school graduates until 1927. Due )
 9, financial problems, the
 
administration of St. BenedictAs school was turned over to the
 f
r
 
Strasburg School District in 1
931. The Catholic parish did not regain
 
control of St. Benedict's school until 1
960, the same year in which
 
the Strasburg Public School was established. In 1966 St. Benedict1 s
 
high school in Strasburg consolidated with St. Anthony's high school
 
in Linton (a neighboring town to the north) and Emmons Central High
 
School 1phpul resulted.  At the time of this consolidation Emmons
 
6
 
Central High School was  ' .
 .
 .
 subsidized by all Catholic parishes in
 
the county and .
 .
 .
 [provided] an opportunity for Catholic education
 
to a student population from seven different parishes."5
 
The consolidation that occurred in 1966 has meant that Emmons
 
Central High School is no longer a community-based parochial s
..hco1
 
but a county-based religious school. Nonetheless, all of the students
 
who attend are German-Russian. By comparison, the Strasburg Public
 
School, while it serves many German-Russian students in the Strasburg
 
area, also meets the needs of non-Catholic, non-German-Russian
 
students. The 1982 graduating class at the Strasburg Public High
 
School numbered twenty-five students. Several were of Hollander
 
background (with family names such as Haan, Nieuwsma, and Van Beek).
 
The 1
982 graduating class at Emmons Central High School, on the other
 
hand, numbered twenty-nine students, all of whom came from Catholic,
 
German-Russian families (with surnames like Baumstarck, Silbernagel,
 
and Wikenheiser). In light of the above facts it is perhaps not
 
surprising that Emmons Central High School offers a German-Russian
 
ethnic studies class as an integral part of its curriculum.
 
History of the German-Russian Ethnic Studies Class
 
Although I was able to observe the German-Russian ethnic
 
studies class at Emmons Central High School on three separate
 
occasions, I had to conduct extensive interviews with the instructor
 
in order to obtain a better idea of the many topics covered. Mr. Les
 
7
 
Kramer, principal of the high school and instructor of the German-
Russian studies class, told me that he has been teaching the class
 
since 1
974. Before coming to Strasburg he taught high school in the
 
neighboring prairie town of Hague, where he first offered the German-
Russian studies class. Although the high school in Hague was extremely
 
small (the 1982 graduating class numbered only seven students),
 
Mr. Kramer considered it an "ideal school" because of the deep sense
 
of community that existed there. He pointed out that all of the
 
German-Russian students at the Hague High School "traced their heritage
 
back to villages five, six miles from each other in Europe."
 
(ES82-TK-C4, Side 1
, 62-69)
 
In 1
977 Mr. Kramer and several other high school teachers in
 
North Dakota were awarded small stipends to develop or expand ethnic
 
curriculum materials at their institution. The stipends, made possible
 
by special funding from the Office of Education, were administered by
 
officials at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. According
 
to Mr. Kramer, there has been no follow-up study or even any contact
 
from the granting office for the past three or four years.
 
Class Structure and Curriculum
 
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School is
 
preceded by a general sociology class offered by Mr. Kramer during the
 
first semester. The course is designed to sensitize students to
 
cultural differences and human diversity. The main text used in the
 
8
 
sociology class is James D. Calderwoo
 
The Developing World:  
Poverty, Growth and Rising Expectations. The book is the subject of
 
some controversy with other educators, says Mr. Kramer, since "the
 
United States does not come out of that book smelling like roses."
 
(ES82-TK-c3, Side 2
, 331-344)  In his mind the sociology class is a
 
prerequisite to delving into German-Russian cultural studies. He often
 
tells his students at the outset of his classes to ask them-selves
 
three basic question:
 
"Who am I?"
 "Why am I?" "What do I intend to do
 
about both?" Those are the questions we have to
 
answer, in light of what others are doing around the
 
world. Until you answer those three questions, I
 
tell the kids, life is really not worth much.
 
(ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
, 390-398)
 
The German-Russian ethnic studies class is offered daily every
 
second semester from 1
1:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon, under the official
 
title "International Relations."  Mr. Kramer feels that course title
 
is justified since he continues to work basic sociological and
 
anthropological concepts into the German-Russian material (e.g.,
 
examples of ethnocentrism, nuclear vs. extended family patterns,
 
etc.). While Mr. Kramer makes use of a number of published works in
 
the German-Russian studies class, he focuses on three volumes in
 
particular: Karl Stumpp's The German-Russians: Two Centuries of
  
Pioneering, the main text used by the students; Karl Stump
 
Emigration from Germany to Russia in the Years 1763 to 1862, a large
 
volume for genealogical research; and Joseph S
. Height's Paradise on
 
the Steppe, a cultural history of the Catholic Black Sea Germans in
 
southern Russia. A slide-sound program entitled "At Home on the
 
9
 
+itQ
 
Prairies:  the Germans from Russia,'  produced by Germans from
\
 
Russia Heritage Society, is used sometimes, depending on its
 
availability from the public library in the neighboring town of
 
Linton. In addition, Mr. Kramer distributes approximately seventy
 
pages of mimeographed handouts to the students, (including maps of
 
German-Russian settlements in the Old World and the New, illustrated
 
essays on German-Russian folk material culture, life histories, and
 
booklists 6
 
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School
 
is divided into various areas of inquiry:
 
1
.  German-Russian Surnames. The course begins with an
 
examination of the family names of German-Russian students in
 
the class. Mr. Kramer attempts to show the students how
 
their German names derived from ancestral occupations, places
 
of origin, physical traits, etc.  According to Mr. Kramer,
 
"
[Sioux Indian names like] Red Bull and Chasing Hawk aren't
 
really any different than their [
the students'] names.  .
 
(ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
,  15-40).
 
2
.  Map-making and Study. The students study the areas in Central
 
Europe where their forefathers originated;  the migration
 
route from Germany to Russia; major German settlement areas
 
in Russia; German-Russian immigrant settlements in the New
 
World; and the location of German-Russian settlements in
 
North Dakota, specifically in Emmons County.
 
3
.
 Study of Living Conditions of German Colonists in Russia.
 
About this section, Mr. Kramer explained:  "We really try to
 
bring home the living condition$.  .  .
 [
by considering the
 
question] What was it like to be a European peasant? .
 .
 .
 
(ES82-TK-c3, Side 2
, 68-73).
 
4
.  German Language and Traditional Songs. Discusses German-
Russian dialects and folksongs. Sometimes Mr. Kramer teaches
 
the students a German song that is later sung at a
 
German-Russian dinner prepared for the parents.  A typical
 
song might include the German-Russian funeral hymn "Das
 
Schicksal [wird keinen verschonen]" (
"The Fate That Spares No
 
One"). Mr. Kramer noted that since fewer and fewer students
 
speak or even understand German, the language section is
 
becoming increasingly difficult to teach.

5
.  Material Folk Culture. StudiesfGerman-Russian folk
 
architecture and the making of(
ennmist (a fuel made from
 
dried animal manure, used by early German-Russian settlers in
 
both Old Russia and the Dakotas). In the past the students
 
have built models of a
melanka (German-Russian earthen
 
house) ,
C cko/f
 en (bake oven) ,
( 1mer Schachtel (boat used by
 
the German emigrants who went to Russia via the Danube), and &
 
horse-drawn wagon.
 - 
6
.  Homesteading "Game". This is an exercise that Mr. Kramer
 
adapted from a similar one used in some schools in Nebraska.
 
It is basically a "farming game" set in North Dakota between
 
1885 and 1887.  "Students attempt to run a fa-rm at a profit
 
over a three-year period." The object of the game is "to
 
provide the students with some insight into the problems
 
faced by homesteaders in the 1880s, and to involve them in
 
the decision-making process." Students are given a scoring
 
sheet. They attempt to farm and invest successfully in the
 
face of unpredictable factors, such as droughts, severe
 
winters, grasshopper infestations, poor markets, and so on.
 
7
.  Discussion of Cultural and Personality Traits of the
  
German-Russians. In this unit Mr. Kramer asks the students
 
to identify some of the dominant attributes of the
 
German-Russians. A discussion often follows regarding the
 
contributed responses. The traits invariably include such
 
descriptive characteristics as conservative, closed-off or
 
ethnocentric, religious, stubborn and "crazy-clean" (an
 
obsession with cleanliness). Mr. Kramer admits that he
 
often plays the devil's advocate, regardless of whether or
 
not the suggested trait is a positive or a negative one.
 
8
.  The German-Russian Dinner. Towards the end of the semesL '
 
the students prepare a German-Russian dinner for parents and
 
other invited guests from the surrounding communities. All
 
the foods are homemade, including such table items as
 
butter and ketchup. Most of the dishes are prepared in
 
the home economics room of the high school on the day that
 
the dinner is held.
 
At the dinner1 I attended the following foods were prepared
 
and served to the asse
led gue ts: k chen (cake), Plb jf4e
 k
1
rep €-
supp' (dumpling soup),(J)leischkj ech g

meat dish),( katwurst (home-made sausage),
uerkraut u

C
n
&id1
?
(
sauerkraut
 and  noodles),
 and  homemade
 ice  cream.
 
On  
the day of the dinner maps and exhibits made by the students
 
were placed on display in the room where the dinner was held.
 
In years past entertainment at this event has been provided
 
by German-Russian singers and musicians. All of the
 
German-Russian food brought to and prepared at the school was
 
donated by the parents of the students.
 
1
1
 
9
.  Field Trip to German-Russian Sites in Emmons County. After
 
the students have examined s§R&426 the background
 
German-Russian history of their immediate area, Mr. Kramer
 
takes them  on a field trip so that they can see for
 
themselves some of the sites they have read about. The
 
emphasis of the field trip is on early German-Russian
 
settlements in the southern half of Emmons County: Tiraspol,
 
Elsass, Odessa, Katzbach, Krassna, and Rosental. At many of
 
these locations only a lonely cemetery remains. Mr. Kramer
 
invariably directs the attention of the students to the
 
wrought-iron cemetery crosses that were made by early
 
German-Russian blacksmiths. These crosses are an important
 
ethnic symbol and are readily identified as such even by non
 
German-Russians who travel through south-central North
 
Dakota. Mr. Kramer and the students also visit the few
 
remaining examples of German-Russian folk architecture in the
 
area, including a number of clay-brick houses built by early
 
German-Russian homesteaders.
 
1
0. Genealogy and Family History Research. Depending on the
 
amount of time available and student interest, Mr. Kramer
 
encourages the students to research their individual family
 
backgrounds. Books and other sources are recommended that
 
can aid in the individual's search for German-Russian
 
genealogical data. A general reading list also is
 
distributed for those students who want to continue reading
 
about the German-Russians at their own leisure.
 
The amount of time spent on these subjects depends primarily on the
 
enthusiasm shown by students. Mr. Kramer explained that since every
 
group of students is different, each German-Russian studies class is
 
somewhat different in regard to its format and emphasis. In addition,
 
events such as the German-Russian dinner and the field trip are
 
scheduled with a number of other considerations in mind, such as the
 
agricultural cycle, weather, and student availability.
 
I was able to observe th German-Russian studies class at Emmons
 
A
 
Central High on three separate occasion. On April 13 the students were
 
making maps and planning the menu for the upcoming German-Russian
 
dinner, April 28 was the day of the dinner, and on May 6 I accompanied
 
Mr. Kramer and the students on their field trip. One of the things
 
1
2
 
that I found most surprising about the class was the emphasis on
 
active participation rather than mere listening or note-taking. When
 
I questioned Mr. Kramer about this, he admitted: "I'm real big on
 
'doing,'  if at all possible." (ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
, 28-31).
 
A strong, cold wind was blowing across the prairie on the day of the
 
field trip, sending t
bleweeds flying high above some distant rock
 
piles erected byAearly
 German-Russian settlers. While I thought such
 
weather might force Mr. Kramer and his students to postpone the trip,
 
soon found out that nothing could be further from Mr. Kramer's line
 
thinking. Following the field trip, as we talked in the welcome
 
warmth of his office back at the high school, Mr. Kramer explained to
 
me that a basic purpose of the field trip was to give the students:
 
•
 •
 .  a feel for the wind and the rocks and the
 
psychological barrier they [the early German-Russian
 
pioneers] ran into when they got here. And on a day
 
like today .
 .
 .  we can get a feel for that .
 
[when] there was nothing out there but prairie,
 
rocks, and wind.  •  .

228-240)
 
Teacher
 
A description of the German-Russian ethnic studies course at
 
Emmons Central High School would be inadequate without further
 
discussion of the instructor, Mr. Les Kramer. A native son of Emmons
 
County, Mr. Kramer is thirty-six years old. In addi
9p to his
 
responsibilities as principal of the Emmons Count
 High School, he
 
1
3
 
farms southwest of Strasburg in the Krassna settlement area. He and
 
his wife, Colleen (n
'e Schmaltz), have two small children. Mr.
 
Kramer's sense of the past is suggested by the fact that he and his
 
family refurbished the old Strasburg train depot, transforming it into
 
a comfortable rural home.
 
Both Mr. Kramer and his wife are former graduates of Emmons Central
 
High School. Their oldest child, Nathan, is in grade school at St.
 
Benedict's, which adjoins the Catholic high school in Strasburg.
 
In my interviews with Mr. Kramer I discovered that his thesis
 
that one can appreciate an ethnic heritage only after one 'steps away
 
from it' is based on personal experience. Following military service
 
and some long periods of inner reflection in Southeast Asia, he
 
returned to North Dakota and attended the state university in Fargo.
 
By the time he enrolled in college, he admits: "I had reassessed all
 
my values .
 .
 .  my thinking." (ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
, 273-285).
 Since
 
that time he has read and studied the history and culture of the
 
German-Russians extensively. Despite his deep appreciation of his
 
ethnic heritage, he has tried to maintain "balance" while instructing
 
his students about their German-Russian heritage. He indicated on
 
several occasions that he wants his students to consider many
 
different aspects of their heritage--both positive and negative--and
 
how they continue to influence their lives today:
 
When we're through with this whole process,  then the
 
thinking process hopefully takes over with [
the
 
students] and they begin to realize that much of the
 
tradition that we've just studied from the past is
 
still very much a part of them.  (E582-TK-C3, Side 1
,
 
388-393).

In regard to the feedback that he receives from his students
 
concerning the German-Russian class, Mr. Kramer noted that there is
 
seldom mucjy- immediate response. As one who had studied the cultural
 
dynamic of his own ethnic group, he realizes that compliments among
 
the German-Russians are rare, particularly for those of the teaching
 
profession:
 
At the high school level the rewards aren't that
 
great .
 .
 .  there aren't as many as you would like,
 
but with teaching that's just the way it is. It's
 
not like medicine, you don't get daily feedback on
 
what a great job you're doing. You may never hear it
 
for twenty years, and then only a comment in passing
 
that you had some influence on a person's life.
 
(ES82-TK-c3, Side 1
, 262-268).
 
There were ten students ranging in age from sixteen to eighteen
 
in Mr. Kramer's most recent German-Russian ethnic studies class. They
 
included Sam Gross, a senior from St. Michael's parish, northeast of
 
Linton; Gerald Holzer and Dale Hom er, seniors from St. Anthony's
 
parish in Linton; Sheila Nagel, a senior from Strasburg; Annette
 
Roehrich, a junior from Strasburg; Josephine Vetter, a senior from St.
 
MichaeX s parish; Rose Vetter a junior from St. Michael's parish; Mark
 
Volk, a senior from Hague; and Katherine Wikenheiser, a junior from
 
Strasburg.
 
I was able t
o observe Mr. Kramer and the students interacting on
 
three separate occasions. The first time was during the April 1
3 class
 
session when the German-Russian dinner menu was being discussed and
 
planned by the students. At one point in the class there was an
 
interesting discussion about faithfulness to "German-Russian
 
tradition." Mr. Kramer had encouraged the students to plan the
 
German-Russian menu with authenticity in mind. Taking this as a cue, a
 
female student asked in a serious tone of voice if "redeye" (a
 
home-prepared grain alcohol beverage popular among many
 
German-Russians) could be served a
t the school during the ethnic
 
dinner. When Mr. Kramer answered negatively, another student drew
 
laughter when she stated: "
If we'd stick to tradition, we'd all be
 
I
s
 
getting drunk *
A (
ES82-TK-Cl, Side 2
, 48-55).
 
On April 28, the day of the German-Russian dinner a
t Emmons
 
Central High School, I watched and photographed the students as they
 
prepared a four-course menu. There were no German-Russian cookbooks
 
present. At t
imes the students argued among themselves about how to
 
prepare certain foods "the right way." It became obvious that the
 
real problem was not the usual recipe variation
's found among
 
German-Russian families, but some major differences due t
o the fact
 
that a number of the students came from outlying parishes many miles
 
1
6
 
On May 6, the day of the field trip, a number of the students
 
rode with me as we visited German-Russian sites in Emmons County. I
 
was amazed that a few of the students indicated they were seeing the
 
sites for the first time, even though they had spent their entire
 
lives in the county. My amazement lessened as I realized that, for
 
some students the sites we were visiting were well outside of "their"
 
settlement area.
 
While I was able to interview only two students from the
 
German-Russian studies class, their impressions proved to be of
 
interest. Both students (who were interviewed separately) indicated
 
they were uncertain as to whether or not they had learned anything in
 
the class that would be of value to them in later life. Both felt
 
that the more satisfying segments of the class dealt with the study
 
of German family names, the map work, the "homesteading game", and the
 
discussion of German-Russian traits. They agreed with most of the
 
traits listed in class, but felt it was an exaggeration to
 
characterize German-Russians as bein4" crazy clean." One
 
commented,
 I didn't believe that too much.  .  .
 .  I don'
 
cleaner than anybody else. I would think we're dirtier, really."
 
(ES82-TK-05, Side 1
, 1
18-124). For both students the German-Russian
 
studies class helped answer questions about their ancestors and their
 
past, particularly as it related to the Old Country:
 
I knew beforehand that we [our ancestors] went to
 
Russia, but I didn't know we were that far south. I
 
thought we were in northern Russia. Then I learned
 
that some of the climate [
in south Russia/I was like
 
California. I didn't know that; thought it was
 
cold [
in southern Russia], just like North Dakota.
 
(ES82-TK-05, Side 1
,  146-160)

Parents and Grandparents
 
I met the parents and grandparents of some of the students for
 
the first time on the day of the German-Russian ethnic dinner at
 
Emmons Central High. Following the meal and program we talked
 
informally about the German-Russian ethnic studies class. The parents
 
seemed pleased with the efforts of their sons and daughters in hosting
 
the dinner, although this pride was never articulated. When I asked
 
about the delicious foods we had just eaten, there was only discussion
 
among those present regarding culinary differences among the
 
German-Russians.
 
The most talkative and enthusiastic adult at the dinner proved to
 
be none other than Wendelin Wikenheiser, the eighty-six-year - old
 
grandfather of one of the students. Mr. Wikenheiser, whom I
 
interviewed at length a few days later, was born in southern Russia
 
and emigrated to North Dakota in 1
903 with his parents when he was
 
eight years old. Today he is one of the few surviving Russian-born
 
elders in the Strasburg community. On the day of the German-Russian
 
dinner Mr. Wikenheiser studied the maps and other materials that were
 
on display at the high school with keen interest. Later, while
 
interviewing him, he spoke of the German-Russian class at the Catholic
 
high school as being "a pretty good idea." He lamented, however, that
 
the students at the high school were not studying the German language
 
1
8
 
more intensely. He confided that he felt it unfair to have to
 
translate everything into English for his "educated" grandchildren.
 
(ES82-TK-c6, Side 1
, 123-146).
 
Talking with Mr. Wikenheiser further I found him to be somewhat
 
ambivalent toward formal education, an attitude shared by many other
 
German-Russians of his generation.  Mr. Wikenheiser's pride in the
 
success of his old friend, Lawrence Welk, was evident and he obviously
 
enjoyed talking about the popular bandleaders's early days in
 
Strasburg. As Mr. Wikenheiser was quick to point out, Strasburg's
 
wealthiest and most famous native son "didn't have much education."
 
(ES82-TK-c6, Side 1
, 462-475).
 
Conclusions
 
Although I had done fieldwork among German-Russians prior to my
 
research at Emmons Central High School, never before had I studied the
 
actual process of conscious cultural transmission in so clearly
 
delineated a setting. After years of observing German-Russian people
 
interacting at informal gatherings, church services, wedding dances,
 
funeral dinners, and agricultural tasks, it was exciting to actually
 
watch a German-Russian adult instruct young members of his group about
 
their ethnic heritage. Many of the cultural values,  attitudes,and
 
1
9
 
perceptions shared by German-Russians-- which I had tried so hard and
 
so long to pinpoint in my early observations —were being identified,
 
discussed, and scrutinized by the percipients themselves!
 
An analysis of the data I collected during my fieldwork at Emmons
 
Central High School is difficult, since I only scratched the surface
 
of what I quickly discovered was a complex and multi-faceted
 
phenomenon. With each bit of information that I uncovered, a score of
 
related questions and lines of inquiry would emerge. While I realize
 
that this is always the case in any scholarly endeavor, I did not
 
think studying one ethnic school would pose the kind of challenge that
 
it did.
 
In analyzing the format and the materials of the German-Russian
 
ethnic studies class at Emmons Central High School I found that the
 
class was basically an honest, balanced attempt to convey some of the
 
more prominent aspects of German-Russian ethnicity to the students.
 
It was refreshing to see German-Russian culture being presented in the
 
kind of down-to-earth, nuts-and-bolts fashion many Black Sea
 
German-Americans of the Dakotas pride themselves in exemplifying.
 
There were no colorful posters of mist-covered castles in Germany in
 
the school room in which the German-Russian class was taught 0—
r
 
 
 
no tall, Bavarian beer steins,, no solemn-faced bust of
 
Wagner. At the German-Russian dinner prepared and served by the
 
students the foods was typically German-Russian and the music playing
 
in the background was a tape recording of a group of local
 
German-Russian farmers singing traditional Old Country favorites, like
 
20
 
"Zu Strasburg" and "Wir sitzen so froehlich beisammen." Most
 
reassuring of all was the fact that not one dirndl or even a pair of
 
lederhosen was anywhere in sight.
 
The fact that the instructor of the German-Russian studies class at
 
Emmons Central encourages the students to focus on specific aspects of
 
their Slavic-influenced heritage--rather than those of their "German"
 
ancestry —is indicated by the fact that a great deal of attention is
 
directed towards the making of models and artifacts that would mean
 
little to most other Americans of German ancestry (e.g., the
 
13
 Is
 
German-Russian /emelanka or earthen house, the Ulmer  chachtel, Ulm
 
13
 
emigrant boat, and , rennmist or manure fuel).
 
V 
V 
While Mr. Kramer and his students have chosen to focus on distinctive
 
aspects of their German-Russian heritage, I believe something is
 
gradually taking place in the class that may not be readily apparent
 
to the participants. At times "German-Russian culture" is discussed
 
and viewed as if it were a truly homogeneous phenomenon. Since Emmons
 
Central High School is no longer a one-parish, community institution,
 
it now draws German-Russian students from settlement areas well
 
outside of Strasburg. While many of the Strasburg students trace their
 
ancestry to the Kutschurgan Black Sea German colonies, a number of
 
other students from the outlying parishes are descendents of emigrants
 
who came from the Bessarabian and Crimean German-Russian colonies.
 
Regional differences (as manifested in dialects, foodways, farming
 
patterns, and so on) may lead to confusion on the part of those
 
German-Russian students whose community or family traditions do not
 
21
 
always run parallel to the material presented in the class. At any
 
rate, one outcome of the German-Russian studies class at the high
 
school may be a heightened awareness of German-Russian id ,idty in its
 
broadest sense, rather than a vague feeling for one 0 
raditions at
 
the purely local level.
 
In regard to the articulation of cultural values, the seventh unit
 
covered in the class deals directly with German-Russian cultural and
 
personality traits. This section of the course always provides a forum
 
for much student discussion about German-Russian values and attitudes.
 
In my interviews with two of the students both pointed out that, while
 
this subject was interesting, it posed some problems, since the
 
students were unable to see themselves as compared to "outside
 
'
 
(
 P
 
They admitted that their contacts with non-G erm
an - Russians were quite
 
limited. Nonetheless, they
 reed
 
values and attributes discus
c  in
 
the land and f
rárming, religiosity, conservatism, frugality, and
 
stubborneg . They disagreed with the  instructor that German-Russians
 
were "crazy-clean," feeling it to be an exaggeration. Other
 
attributes,  such as affability, generosity, and sobriety, were not
 
listed as characterizing the German-Russians.
 
A large circular poster with illustrations of a German-Russian
 
earthen home, windmill, and plow graced the front of the room on the
 
day of the German-Russian dinner at the high school. Two
 
neatly-lettered German expressions appeared on the poster "Arbeit
 
macht das Leben suess" (
"Work makes life sweet") and "In Amerika durch
 
V 
I
 
22
 
Gottes Gnade!" (
"In America through the Grace of God!"). A smaller
 
poster, bearing numerous pictures of agricultural scenes, bore the
 
legend: •LANDSLEUTE--Part of our German-Russian Heritage as Farmers."
 
Another characteristic of the German-Russians, repeatedly pointed out
 
by Mr. Kramer, is their ambivalence toward formal education. This
 
attitude was explained as stemming from the past history of the
 
German-Russians, since they viewed schools in Russia and later in the
 
United States as threats to their cultural and religious integrity.
 
This fear was compounded by the German-Russian belief that education
 
was not essential for those engaged in agricultural pursuits.
 
According to Mr. Kramer, such attitudes persist and are contributing
 
factors to the unstable financial situation of the Catholic high
 
school in Strasburg today. Mr. Kramer pointed out that many
 
German-Russians tend to be tight-fisted and, consequently, dislike
 
making pledges; but at the same time they want to see Emmons
 
Central-- their school"--remain open.  Thus, the future of the
 
German-Russian studies class, and indeed that of the very high school
 
in which it is taught, remains uncertain. (EsS2-TK-C8, Side 2
, 73 95).
 
Perhaps the most important thing that I learned while studying
 
the German-Russian class at Emmons Central is that high school
 
educators can offer both a well-balanced curriculum and an ethnic
 
heritage component without sacrificing program quality.7 The students
 
at Emmons Central High School are free to choose whether to enroll in
 
the German-Russian studies course. If they decide to do so, they are
 
able to attend the class during regular school hours. Furthermore,
 
since basic anthropological and sociological c
oncepts are integrated
 
into the German-Russian ethnic studies class, i
t serves the students
 
in two important ways: by providing a formal opportunity t

various facets o

ADDENDUM
 
On May 21,  1985,
 the doors of Emmons Central High School were
 
locked following final commencement ceremonies.
 This time,  however,
 
a simple spring ritual symbolizing another school year's end had
 
profound and deeply-troubling significance to many German-Russian
 
families:
 the doors of Emmons Central were to remain permanently
 
closed.
 
Rising education costs and declining student enrollments
 
were cited as two of the major reasons for the parochial school's
 
shutdown.
 Newspaper reporter Lucille Hendrickson described the
 
emotion-charged event in an article entitled "Goodbye,  Emmons
 
Central,  Goodbye Forever"  (The Bismarck Tribune, May 26,  1985).
 
Hendrickson perhaps summed up the feelings of many people in the
 
Strasburg,  North Dakota area when she wrote that "the death of a
 
school is a grievous thing for a small community."

The German-Russians comprise one of the larger ethnic groups in
 
the Great Plains region today. Descended from German colonists who
 
f
irst settled in Russia during the 1
760s at the invitation of Czarina
 
Catherine the Great, the German-Russians are particularly numerous in
 
the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, eastern Colorado, and the Canadian
 
prairie provinces.
 
When they
 
knit, agrarian
 
affiliation
 
settled in Russia, the German-Russians lived in closely
 
villages that were established along religious lines of
 
(
i.e., Lutheran, Evangelical Reformed, Roman Catholic,
 
Mennonite, or Hutterite). For more than a century in Russia the
 
German-Russians avoided intensive contact, not only with their Russian
 
and Ukrainian hosts but also with German colonists living in
 
neighboring villages. The major German enclaves in Russia included
 
those of the Volga Germans (Wolgadeutschen), established in 1764-1767,
 
and the Black Sea Germans (Schwarzmeerdeutschen), established in the
 
late 1
780s and early 1
800s.1
 
A 
The German colonists in Russia enjoyed decades of self-imposed
 
isolation, until the reforms and Russification measures of Czar
 
Alexander II were implemented in the 1
870s. These reforms caused
 
thousands of German-Russian colonist families to uproot themselves and
 
emigrate to the New World. Having prospered as grain farmers on the
 
treeless Russian steppes,  the German-Russian emigrants were attracted
 
to the plains of North America and to the pampas of South America.
 
The German emigration from Russia began in the mid--1870s and continued
 
2
 
descendants as any other state in the union.4 When one considers that
 
the entire state of North Dakota has a combined population of only
 
652,437 (
1980 census), one can imagine how numerous the
 
German-Russians seem in such a sparsely-settled area.
 
until World War I
. As in Russia, the German-Russians who came to the
 
New World tended to settle along regional and religious l
ines of
 
affiliation. Thus, one primarily finds Volga German Protestants in
 
Nebraska, Volga German Catholics in western Kansas, and Black Sea
 
Germans in the Dakotas.2
 
jA
 
There i
s no way of determining exactly how many Americans of
 
German-Russian descent presently reside in the United States, due to
 
recent census records that rarely distinguish German-Russians from
 
other Americans of German ancestry. Yet, German-Russians have become a
 
highly visible ethnic group in the Great Plains states, partially due
 
to the success of two active, ethnic organizations that boast
 
ever-increasing memberships:
 
Germans from Russia (AHSGR),
 
Germans from Russia Heritage
 
Dakota in 1971.
 
The American Historical Society of
 
founded in Colorado in 1968, and the
 
Society (GRHS), established in North
 
V 
German emigration from the Black Sea region of South Russia
 
coincided with the opening of the United States homestead lands on the
 
northern Great Plains. By 1920 some 70,000 German-Russians of the
 
first and second generations were living in the state of North Dakota
 
alone.3 Today North Dak/ota may have twice as many German-Russian
 b
/ V
 
,1
 
3
 
While North Dakota attracted representative German groups from
 
all of the major settlement areas in Russia, the vast majority came
 
from the Black Sea region near the port city of Odessa. The first
 
German-Russians immigrated to what was then "Dakota Territory" as
 
homesteaders. Although they could not establish closed agrarian
 
villages as they had done in Russia, German-Russians who shared the
 
same religion and regional dialect did establish their homesteads in
 
close proximity to one another. Since some of the better farmlands
 
along the wooded river valleys already had been claimed by
 
Scandinavian immigrants,  the German-Russians settled in the southern,
 
central, and north-central portions of the state. Their communities
 
form what has been called the "German-Russian Triangle." Most of the
 
state's German-Russians live within this triangular portion of the
 
state in areas homesteaded by their immigrant forebears less than a
 
century ago. - )

The town of Strasburg, North Dakota lies 75 miles southeast of
 
Bismarck, the state capital, and about a dozen miles north of the
 
South Dakota line. The community was established in the spring of 1
889
 
by German-Russian homesteaders, who named the struggling pioneer
 
settlement in honor of Strassburg, their home colony in South Russia.
 
With the building of a nearby railroad in 1902, Strasburg gradually
 
grew in size until its inhabitants numbered 700 people in 1
930. 5 Yet,
 
as in other small towns on the northern Great Plains, the paucity of
 
4
 
farms and jobs prompted many of the local youth to find employment
 
elsewhere. The population of Strasburg, North Dakota is approximately
 
6
23 today (
1980 census).
 
Located in the southern half of Emmons County, Strasburg is in
 
an area densely populated by people of German-Russian ancestry.
 
Neighboring communities, such as Hague and Linton, are well known to
 
North Dakotans as towns where the "German brogue" remains a
 
distinguishing characteristic. While the Strasburg area is primarily
 
German-Russian and Roman Catholic,  there is a small settlement of
 
"Hollanders" (who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church) southwest of
 
Strasburg. Large numbers of Protestant German-Russians are found only
 
a few miles to the east, and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation
 
L
ocated cue wesr,  across Lake Oahe and the Missouri River.
 
\
s one approaches the prairie community of Strasburg by car,
 
immediately struck by two things:  the immense size of its
 
Catholic church, the spire of which can be seen high above the trees
 
and surrounding structures, and the signs off Route 83 that proudly
 
call attention to the fact that Strasburg is the hometown of music
 
maestro Lawrence Welk. Born in a clay-brick pioneer home near
 
Strasburg, Welk grew up practicing an old accordion brought from
 
Russia by his father. Eventually, Lawrence Welk's shy, reserved
 
style, Emmons County "German brogue," and champagne music became well
 
known trademarks in the entertainment world.

On the northwest edge o
f S
trasburg, well within sight o
f Saints
 
Peter and Paul Catholic Church, stands Emmons Central High School. The
 
pale brick building i
s one of two high schools in the small community
 
and are within easy walking distance of each other. Emmons Central is
 
a parochial school that serves the Catholic youth of Emmons County,
 
while the Strasburg Public School i
s administered by the local school
 
d
istrict. The casual observer who attempts t
o see Strasburg a
s a
 
homogeneous ethnic community —united by a c
ommon religious and
 
cultural heritage —will be hard pressed t
o explain the existence of
 
two high schools in such close proximity t
o one another.
 
Upon checking available published sources regarding the history
 
o
f the two schools, I found that the first school in Strasburg was
 
parochial, e
stablished in 1
910 in the basement o
f the parish church I
 
Ursuline nuns from Calvarienberg, Germany. In 1
918 St. Benedict's
 
Catholic School was built by the parishioners, but there were no higt
 
school graduates until 1
927. Due t
o financial problems, the
 
administration o
f St. Benedict's school was turned over t
o the
 
Strasburg School District in 1
931. The Catholic parish did not regair
 
c
ontrol of St. Benedict's school until 1
960, the same year in which
 
the Strasburg Public School was established. In 1966 St. Benedict's
 
high school in S
trasburg consolidated with S
t. Anthony's high school
 
in Linton (a neighboring t
own t
o the north) and Emmons Central High
 
School resulted.  At the time o
f this consolidation Emmons
 
0
 
Central Hi gh School was "
.
 .
 .
 subsidized by all Catholi c par ishes  in 
the county and .
 .
 .
 [provided] an opportunity for Catholic education
 
to a student population from seven different parishes. "6
 
The consolidation that occurred in 1966 has meant that Emmons
 
Central High School is no longer a community-based parochial
 
institution but a county-based religious school. Nonetheless, all of
 
the students who attend are German-Russian. By comparison, the
 
Strasburg Public School, while it serves many German
-Russ
ian  stu den ts 
in the Strasburg area, also meets the needs of non-Catholic,
 
non-German-Russian students. The 1
982 graduating class at the
 
Strasburg Public High School numbered twenty-five students.
 
were of Hollander background (with family names such as Haan.
 
Nieuwsma, and Van Beek). The 1
982 graduating class at Emmons Central
 
High School, on the other hand, numbered twenty-nine students, all of
 
whom came from Catholic, German-Russian families (with surnames like
 
Baumstarck, Silbernagel, and Wikenheiser). In light of the above facts
 
it i
s perhaps not surprising that Emmons Central High School offers
 
German-Russian Ethnic Studies as an integral part of its curriculum.

History of the German-Russian Ethnic Studies Class
 
Although I was able to observe the German-Russian studies class
 
at Emmons Central High School on three separate occasions, I had to
 
conduct extensive interviews with the instructor to obtain a better
 
idea of the many topics covered. Mr. Les Kramer, principal of the high
 
school and instructor of the German-Russian studies class, told me
 
that he has been teaching the class since 1
974. Before coming to
 
Strasburg he taught high school in the neighboring prairie t
own of
 
Hague, where he first offered the German-Russian studies class.
 
Although the high school in Hague was extremely small (
the 1
982
 
graduating class numbered only seven students), Mr. Kramer considered
 
it an "ideal school" because of the deep sense of community that
 
existed there. He pointed out that all of the German-Russian students
 
at the Hague High School "traced their heritage back to villages five,
 
six miles from each other in Europe." (ES82-TK---C4, Side 1
, 62-69)
 
In 1977 Mr. Kramer and several other high school teachers in
 
North Dakota were awarded small stipends to develop or expand ethnic
 
curriculum materials at their institution  The stipends, made possible
 
A
 
by special funding from the Office of Education, were administered by
 
officials at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. According
 
to Mr. Kramer, there has been no follow-up study or even any contact
 
from the granting office for the past three or four years. 1h40 C

Class Structure and Curriculum
 
The German-Russian studies class at Emmons Central High School is
 
preceded by a general sociology class offered by Mr. Kramer during the
 
first semester. The course is designed to sensitize students to
 
cultural differences and human diversity. The main text used in the
 
sociology class is James D. Calderwood's The Developing World:  
Poverty, Growth and Rising Expectations. The book is the subject
 
some controversy with other educators, says Mr. Kramer, since "t
 
United States does not come out of that book smelling like roses."
 
(E582-'rK-C3, Side 2
, 331-344)  In his mind the sociology class is a
 
prerequisite to delving into German-Russian cultural studies. He often
 
tells his students at the outset of his classes to ask themselves
 
three basic question:
 
"Who am I?"
 "Why am I?" "What do I intend to do
 
about both?" Those are the questions we have to
 
answer, in light of what others are doing around the
 
world. Until you answer those three questions, I
 
tell the kids, life is really not worth much.
 
(ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
, 390-398)
 
German-Russian Ethnic Studies is offered daily every second
 
semester from 1
1:00 A.M.  to 1
2:00 noon, under the official title
 
"
International Relations."  Mr. Kramer feels the course title is
 
justified,  since he continues to work basic sociological and
 
anthropological concepts into the German-Russian material (e.g.,
 
examples of ethnocentrism, nuclear vs. extended family patterns,
 
etc.). While Mr. Kramer makes use of a number of published works in
 
the German-Russian studies class, he focuses on three volumes in
 
particular:  Karl Stumpp's The German- Russians: Two Centuries of 
 
Pioneering, the main text used by
 
Emigration from Germany to Russia
 
volume for genealogical research;
 
the Steppe, a cultural history o
f
 
the students; Karl Stumpp's The
 
in the Years 1763 to 1862, a large
 
and Joseph S. Height's Paradise on 
 
the Catholic Black Sea Germans in
 
southern Russia. A slide-sound program entitled "At Home on the
 
Prairies: The Germans from Russia," produced 
 Germans from 7N
 
A 
Russia Heritage Society, i
s used sometimes, depending on its
 
availability from the public l
ibrary in the neighboring t
own o
r
 
Linton. In addition, Mr. Kramer distributes approximately seventy
 
pages of mimeographed handouts to the s
tudents, including maps of
 
German-Russian settlements in the Old World and the New, illustrated
 
e
ssays on German-Russian folk material culture, life histories, and
 
The German-Russian studies c
lass at Emmons Central High School
 
i
s divided into various areas of inquiry:
 
1
.
 German-Russian Surnames. The course begins with an
 
examination of the family names of German-Russian students in
 
the class. Mr. Kramer attempts to show the students how
 
their German names derived from ancestral occupations, places
 
of origin, physical traits,  etc.
 According to Mr. Kramer,
 
"[Sioux Indian names like]  Red Bull and Chasing Hawk aren't
 
really any different than their  [
the students']  names . . . .

 Study of Living Conditions of German Colonists in Russia.
 
About this section Mr. Kramer explained:  "We really try to
 
bring home the living conditions .
 .
 .
 [
by considering the
 
question] What was it like to be a European peasant? .
 .
 
(ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
, 68-73).
 
4.
 German Language and Traditional Songs. Discusses German-
Russian dialects and folksongs. Sometimes Mr. Kramer teaches
 
the students a German song that is later sung at a
 
German-Russian dinner prepared for the parents. A typical
 
song might include the German-Russian funeral hymn "Das
 
Schicksal [wird keinen verschonen]" (
"The Fate That Spares No
 
One"). Mr. Kramer noted that since fewer and fewer students
 
speak or even understand German, the language section is
 
becoming increasingly difficult to teach.
 
5
.  Material Folk Culture. Studies German-Russian folk
 
architecture and the making of Brennmist (a fuel made from
 
dried animal manure, used by early German-Russian settlers in
 
both Old Russia and the Dakotas). In the past) the students
 
have built models of a Semelanka (German-Russian earthen
 
house), Backof
 en (bake oven), Ulmer Schachtel (boat used by
 
the German emigrants who went to Russia via the Danube), and
 
a horse-drawn wagon.
 
6.  Homesteading "Game'. This is an exercise that Mr. Kramer
 
adapted from a similar one used in some schools in Nebraska.
 
It is basically a "farming game" set in North Dakota between
 
1885 and 1887.  "Students attempt to run a farm at a profit
 
over a three-year period.'  The object of the game is "to
 
provide the students with some insight into the problems
 
faced by homesteaders in the 1
880s and to involve them in
 
the decision-making process." Students are given a scoring
 
sheet. They attempt to farm and invest successfully in the
 
face of unpredictable factors such as droughts, severe
 
winters, grasshopper infestations, poor markets, and so on.
 
7
.
 Discussion of Cultural and Personality Traits of the
  
German-Russians. In this unit Mr. Kramer asks the students
 
to identify some of the dominant attributes of the
 
German-Russians. A discussion often follows regarding the
 
contributed responses. The traits invariably include such
 
descriptive characteristics as conservative, closed off or
 
ethnocentric, religious, stubborn and "crazy-clean" (an
 
obsession with cleanliness). Mr. Kramer admits that he
 
often plays the devil's advocate, regardless of whether or
 
not the suggested trait is a positive or a negative one.
 
8.  The German-Russian Dinner. Towards the end of the semester
 
the students prepare a German-Russian dinner for parents and
 
other invited guests from the surrounding communities. All
 
the foods are homemade, including such table items as
 
1
1
 
butter and ketchup. Most of the dishes are prepared in
 
the home economics room of the high school on the day that
 
the dinner is held.
 
At the dinner that I attended the following foods were
 
prepared and served to the assembled guests: Kuchen (cake),
 
Knepflesupp (dumpljng soup), Fleischkiechla (a deep-fried
 
dough and meat dish), Bratwurst (homemade sausage),
 
Sauerkraut un' Nudla (
sauerkraut and noodles), and homemade
 
ice cream.  On the day of the dinner) r
naps and exhibits made
 
by the students were placed on display in the room where the
 
dinner was held. In years past entertainment at this event
 
has been provided by German-Russian singers and musicians.
 
All of the German-Russian food brought to and prepared at the
 
school was donated by the parents of the students.
 
9
.
 Field Trip to German-Russian Sites in Emmons County. After
 
the students have examined the bagLi
-'u
 German-Russian
 
history of their immediate area) Mr. Kramer takes them on a
 
field trip so that they can see for themselves some of the
 
sites they have read about. The emphasis of the field trip i
s
 
on early German-Russian settlements in the southern half of
 
Emmons County: Tiraspol, Elsass, Odessa, Katzbach, Krassna,
 
and Rosental. At many of these locations only a lonely
 
cemetery remains. Mr. Kramer invariably directs the attention
 
of the students to the wrought-iron cemetery crosses that
 
were made by early German-Russian blacksmiths. These crosses
 
are an important ethnic symbol and are readily identified as
 
such even by non German-Russians who travel through
 
south-central North Dakota. Mr. Kramer and the students
 
visit the few remaining examples of German-Russian folk
 
architecture in the area, including a number of clay-bri
 
houses built by early German-Russian homesteaders.
 
10. Genealogy and Family History Research. Depending on the
 
amount of time available and student interest, Mr. Kramer
 
encourages the students to research their individual family
 
backgrounds. Books and other sources are recommended that
 
can aid in the individual's search for German-Russian
 
genealogical data. A general reading list also is
 
distributed for those students who want to continue reading
 
-
 about the German-Russians at their own leisure.
 
The amount of time spent on these subjects depends primarily on the
 
enthusiasm shown by students. Mr. Kramer explained that, since every
 
group of students is different, each German-Russian studies class ir
 
in regard to its format and emphasis. In addition,
 
V 
V
 
1
2
 
events such as the German-Russian dinner and the field trip are
 
scheduled with a number of other considerations in mind such as the
 
agricultural cycle, weather, and student availability.
 
I was able to observe the German-Russian studies class at Emmons
 
Central High on three separate occasion. On April 1
3 I observed ih

 maps and p
-lannc  the menu for the upcoming
 
German-Russian dinner, on April 28 I participated in the dinner, and
 
on May 6 I accompanied Mr. Kramer and the students on their field
 
trip. One of the things that I found most surprising about the clas Q
.
 
was the emphasis on active participation rather than mere listening
 
note-taking. When I questioned Mr. Kramer about this, he admitted:
 
"I'm real big on 'doing,'  if at all possible." (ES82-TK-C3, Side 2
,
 
28-31).
 
A strong, cold wind was blowing across the prairie on the day of
 
the field trip, sending tumbleweeds flying high above some distant
 
rock piles erected by the early German-Russian settlers. While I
 
thought such weather might force Mr. Kramer and his students to
 
postpone the trip, I soon found out that nothing could be further from
 
Mr. Kramer's line of thinking. Following the field trip, as we talked
 
in the welcome warmth of his office back at the high school, Mr.
 
Kramer explained to me that a basic purpose of the field trip was to
 
give the students:
 
•  • . a feel for the wind and the rocks and the
 
psychological barrier they [
the early German-Russian
 
pioneers] ran into when they got here. And on a day
 
like today . . . we can get a feel for that . .

Teacher
 
A description of German-Russian Ethnic Studies at Emmons Central
 
High School would be inadequate without further discussion of the
 
instructor, Mr. Les Kramer. A native son of Emmons County, Mr. Kramer
 
is thirty-six years old. In addition to his responsibilities as
 
principal of the Emmons County High School, he farms southwest of
 
Strasburg in the Krassna settlement area. He and his wife, Colleen
 
(n e Schmaltz), have two small children. Mr. Kramer's sense of the
 
past is suggested by the fact that he and his family refurbished the
 
old Strasburg train depot, transforming it into a comfortable rural
 
home.
 
Both Mr. Kramer and his wife are former graduates of Emmons
 
Central High School. Their oldest child, Nathan,  is in grade school at
 
St. Benedict's, which adjoins the Catholic high school in Strasburg.
 
In my interviews with Mr. Kramer I discovered that his thesis
 
that one can appreciate an ethnic heritage only after one "steps away
 
from it" is based on personal experience. Following military service
 
and some long periods of inner reflection in Southeast Asia, he
 
returned to North Dakota and attended the state university in Fargo.
 
By the time he enrolled in college, he admits:  "I had reassessed all
 
LI,
 
1
4
 
my values  .
 .
 .  my thinking." (ES82-TK-c3, Side 2
, 273-285).
 S
i -
that time he has read and studied the
 
German-Russians extensively. Despite
 
ethnic heritage, he has tried to maintain "balance" while instructing
 
his students about their German-Russian culture. He indicated on
 
several occasions that he wants his students to consider many
 
different aspects of their heritage--both positive and negative--and
 
how they continue to influence their lives today.
 
When we're through with this whole process, then the
 
thinking process hopefully takes over with [
the
 
students] and they begin to realize that much of the
 
tradition that we've just studied from the past is
 
still very much a part of them.  (ES82-TK-c3, Side 1
,
 
388-393).
 
In regard to the feedback that he receives from his students
 
concerning the German-Russian class, Mr. Kramer noted that there is
 
seldom much immediate response. As one who had studied the cultural
 
dynamics of his own ethnic group, he realizes that compliments among
 
the German-Russians are rare, particularly for those of the teaching
 
profession.
 
At the high school level the rewards aren't that
 
great .
 .
 .  there aren't as many as you would like,
 
but with teaching that's just the way it is. It's
 
not like medicine, you don't get daily feedback on
 
what a great job you're doing. You may never hear it
 
for twenty years, and then only a comment in passing
 
that you had some influence on a person's life.
 
(ES82-TK-C3, Side 1
, 262-268).
 
N 
Str asburg. 
As mentioned previously,  I was able to observe Mr. Kramer and the
 
students interacting on three separate occasions. The first time was
 
during the April 13 class session when the German-Russian dinner menu
 
was being discussed and planned by the students. At one point in the
 
class there was an interesting discussion about faithfulness tn
 
"German- Russian tradition." Mr. Kramer had encouraged the studeLit-S  '
.0
 
plan the German-Russian menu with authenticity in mind. Taking this as
 
a cue, a female student asked in a serious tone of voice if "redeye"
 
(a homemade grain alcohol beverage popular among many German -Russians)
 
could be served at the school during the ethnic dinner. When Mr.
 
Kramer answered negatively, another student drew laughter when she
 
stated,  "If we'd stick to tradition, we'd all be getting drunk."
 
1

On April 28, the day of the German-Russian dinner at Emmons
 
Central High School, I watched and photographed the students as they
 
prepared a four-course menu. There were no German-Russian cookbooks
 
present. At times the students argued among themselves about how to
 
prepare certain foods "the right way." It became obvious that the real
 
problem was not the usual recipe variations found among German-Russian
 
families, but some major differences due to the fact that a number of
 
the students came from outlying parishes many miles away. The
 
preparation of Fleischkiechla, for example, met with mixed reactions,
 
since this particular dish is not shared by all German-Russian
 
families. Originally of Tatar origin, the deep-fried Fleischkiechla
 
are most popular among those German-Russians who trace their ancestry
 
to colonies in the Crimean portion of South Russia.
 
On May 6
, the day of the field trip, a number of the students
 
rode with me as we visited German-Russian sites in Emmons County. I
 
was amazed that a few of the students indicated they were seeing the
 
sites for the first time, even though they had spent their entire
 
lives in the county. My amazement lessened as I realized that, for
 
some students, the sites we were visiting were well outside of "their"
 
settlement area.
 
While I was able to interview only two students from the
 
German-Russian studies class, their impressions proved to be of
 
interest. Both students (who were interviewed separately) indicated
 
they were uncertain as to whether or not they had learned anything in
 
the class that would be of value to them in later life. Both felt
 
that the more satisfying segments of the class dealt with the s
tudy
 
o
f German family names, the map work, the "homesteading game", and the
 
discussion of German-Russian traits. They agreed with most o
f the
 
traits listed in class, but felt i
t was an exaggeration t
o
 
characterize German-Russians a
s being "
crazy clean." One s
tudent even
 
c
ommented, "
I didn't believe that too much .
 
-
 -
. I don't think we're
 
c
leaner than anybody else. I would think we're dirtier, really."
 
(
ES82-TK-05, Side 1
, 1
18-124). For both students the German-Russian
 
s
tudies class helped answer questions about their ancestors and their
 
past, particularly a
s i
t related t
o the old c
ountry.
 
I knew beforehand that we [
our ancestors] went t
o
 
Russia, but I didn't know we were that far south. I
 
thought we were in northern Russia. Then I learned
 
that some of the climate [
in south Russia] was l
ike
 
California. I didn't know that --thought it was
 
cold [
in southern Russia], just like North Dakota.
 
I met the parents and grandparents of s
ome of the s
tudents for
 
the first t
ime on the day of the German-Russian ethnic dinner at
 
Emmons Central High. Following the meal and program we talked
 
informally about the German-Russian studies class. The parents
 
seemed pleased with the efforts o
f their sons and daughters in hosting
 
the dinner, although this pride was never articulated. When I asked
 
1
8
 
about the delicious foods we had just eaten, there was only discussion
 
among those present regarding culinary differences among the
 
German -Russians.
 
The most talkative and enthusiastic adult at the dinner proved to
 
be none other than Wendelin Wikenheiser, the eighty-six-year-old
 
grandfather of one of the students. Mr. Wikenheiser, whom I
 
interviewed at length a few days later, was born in southern Russia
 
and emigrated to North Dakota in 1
903 with his parents when he was
 
eight years old. Today he is one of the few surviving Russian-born
 
elders in the S
trasburg community. On the day of the German-Russian
 
dinner Mr. Wikenheiser studied the maps and other materials that were
 
on display at the high school with keen interest. Later, while
 
interviewing him, he spoke of the German-Russian class at the Catholic
 
high school as being "a pretty good idea." He lamented, however, that
 
the students at the high school were not studying the German language
 
more intensely. He confided that he felt it unfair to have to
 
translate everything into English for his "educated" grandchi Hrer-i
.
 
(ES82-TK-c6, Side 1
,  1
23-146).
 
Talking with Mr. Wikenheiser further I found him to be somewhat
 
ambivalent towards formal education, an attitude shared by many other
 
German-Russians of his generation.  Mr. Wikenheiser's pride in the
 
success of his old friend, Lawrence Welk, was evident and he obviously
 
enjoyed talking about the popular bandleaders's early days in
 
1
9
 
Strasburg. As Mr. Wikenheiser was quick to point out, Strasburg's
 
wealthiest and most famous native son "didn't have much education."
 
(ES82-TK--C6, Side 1
, 462-475).
 
Conclusions
 
Although I had done fieldwork among German-Russians prior to my
 
research at Emmons Central High School, never before had I studied the
 
actual process of conscious cultural transmission in so clearly
 
delineated a setting. After years of observing German-Russian people
 
interacting at informal gatherings, church services, wedding dances,
 
funeral dinners, and agricultural tasks, it was exciting to actually
 
watch a German-Russian adult instruct young members of his group about
 
their ethnic heritage. Many of the cultural values, attitudes, and
 
perceptions shared by German-Russians--which I had tried so hard and
 
so long to pinpoint in my early observations —were being identified,
 
discussed, and scrutinized by the percipients themselves!
 
An analysis of the data I collected during my fieldwork at Emmons
 
Central High School is difficult since I only scratched the surface of
 
what I quickly discovered was a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon.
 
A score of related questions and lines of inquiry would emerge with
 
each bit of information that I uncovered. While I realize that this is
 
always the case in any scholarly endeavor, I did not think studying
 
one ethnic school would pose the kind of challenge that it did.
 
20
 
In analyzing the format and the materials for German-Russian
 
Ethnic Studies at Emmons Central High School I found that the class
 
was basically an honest, balanced attempt to convey some of the more
 
prominent aspects of German-Russian ethnicity to the students. It was
 
refreshing to see German-Russian culture being presented in the kind
 
of down-to-earth, nuts-and-bolts fashion many Black Sea German
 
Americans of the Dakotas pride themselves in exemplifying. There were
 
no colorful posters of mist-covered castles in Germany in the school
 
room where the German-Russian class was taught, no tall, Bavarian beer
 
stem s, or solemn-faced busts of Wagner. At the German-Russian dinner
 
prepared and served by the students the foods was typically
 
German-Russian and the music playing in the background was a tape
 
recording of a group of local German-Russian farmers singing
 
traditional old country favorites, like "Zu Stra
urg" and "Wir sitzen
 
so froehlich beisammen." Most reassuring of all was the fact that not
 
L
 
one dirndl or even a pair of ,
1ederhosen was anywhere in sight.
 
The fact that the instructor of the German-Russian studies class
 
at Emmons Central encourages the students to focus on specific aspects
 
of their Slavic influenced heritage--rather than those of their
 
"German" ancestry —is indicated by the fact that a great deal of
 
attention is directed towards the making of models and artifacts that
 
would mean little to most other Americans of German ancestry (e.g.,
 
the German-Russian Semelanka or earthen house, the Ulmer Schachtel,
 
Ulm emigrant boat, and Brennmist or manure fuel).
 
V

While Mr. Kramer and his students have chosen to focus on distinctive
 
aspects of their German-Russian heritage, I believe something is
 
gradually taking place in the class that may not be readily apparent
 
to the participants. At times "German-Russian culture" is discussed
 
and viewed as if it were a truly homogeneous phenomenon. Since Emmons
 
Central High School is no longer a one-parish, community institution,
 
it now draws German-Russian students from settlement areas well
 
outside of Strasburg. While many of the Strasburg students trace their
 
ancestry to the Kutschurgan Black Sea German colonies, a number of
 
other students from the outlying parishes are descendants of emigrants
 
who came from the Bessarabian and Crimean German-Russian colonies.
 
Regional differences (as manifested in dialects, foodways, farming
 
patterns, and so on) may lead to confusion on the part of those
 
German-Russian students whose community or family traditions do not
 
always run parallel to the material presented in the class. At any
 
rate, one outcome of the German-Russian studies class at the high
 
school may be a heightened awareness of German-Russian identity in its
 
broadest sense, rather than a vague feeling for one's traditions at
 
the purely local level.
 
In regard to the articulation of cultural values the seventh
 
unit covered in the class deals directly with German-Russian cultural
 
and personality traits. This section of the course always provides a
 
forum for much student discussion about German-Russian values and
 
attitudes. In my interviews with two of the students both pointed out
 
that, while this subject was interesting, it posed some problems
 
22
 
since the students were unable to see themselves as compared to
 
"outsiders." They admitted that their contacts with people who are not
 
German-Russian were quite limited. Nonetheless, they agreed with most
 
of the German-Russian values and attributes discussed in class:
 
industriousness, a love of the land and farming, religiosity,
 
conservatism, frugality, and stubbornness. They disagreed with the
 
instructor that German-Russians were "crazy clean," feeling it to be
 
an exaggeration. Other attributes, such as affability, generosity, and
 
sobriety, were not listed as characterizing the German-Russians.
 
A large circular poster with illustrations of a German-Russian
 
earthen home, windmill, and plow graced the front of the room on the
 
day of the German-Russian dinner at the high school. Two neatly
 
lettered German expressions appeared on the poster "Arbeit macht das
  
Leben suess" (
"Work makes life sweet") and "
In Amerika durch Gottes  
Gnade!" (
"In America through the Grace of God!"). A smaller poster,
 
bearing numerous pictures of agricultural scenes, bore the legend:
 
"LANDSLEUTE--Part of our German-Russian Heritage as Farmers."
 
Another characteristic of the German-Russians, repeatedly pointed out
 
by Mr. Kramer, is their ambivalence towards formal education. This
 
attitude was explained as stemming from the past history of the
 
German-Russians, since they viewed schools in Russia and later in the
 
United States as threats to their cultural and religious integrity.
 
This fear was compounded by the German-Russian belief that education
 
was not essential for those engaged in agricultural pursuits.
 
According to Mr. Kramer, such attitudes persist and are contributing
 
23
 
factors to the unstable financial situation of the Catholic high
 
school in Strasburg today. Mr. Kramer pointed out that many
 
I
AOV k
 
German-Russians tend to be tight fisted and, consequently, dislike
 
making pledges; but at the same time they want to see Emmons
 
Central--"their school"--remain open.  Thus, the future of the
 
German-Russian studies class, and indeed that of the very high school
 
in which it is taught, remains uncertain. (ES82-TK-C8, Side 2
, 73-95).
 
Perhaps the most important thing that I learned while studying
 
the German-Russian class at Emmons Central is that high school
 
educators can offer both a well-balanced curriculum and an ethnic
 
heritage component without sacrificing program quality.8 The students
 
at Emmons Central High School are free to choose whether to enroll in
 
the German-Russian studies course. If they decide to do so, they are
 
able to attend the class during regular school hours. Furthermore,
 
since basic anthropological and sociological concepts are integrated
 
into the German-Russian Ethnic studies class, it serves the students
 
in two important ways: by providing a formal opportunity to explore
 
various facets of the German-Russian culture and by encouraging the
 
students to view their heritage against the larger backdrop of human
 
experience.

Acknowledgments
 
I am deeply indebted to the following individuals, all of whom
 
helped make my ethnic heritage school research a truly enlightening
 
experience: Mr. Les Kramer and his German-Russian Ethnic Studies class
 
at Emmons Central High School in Strasburg; Mr. Alan Hummel of Hague;
 
Mr. and Mrs. John Vetter of Kintyre; Mr. Wendelin Wikenheiser from
 
Strasburg; and the Clarence Wikenheiser family of Strasburg.
 
Appreciation also is due Michael M. Miller, Millie Nieuwsma-Buekea,
 
and Rosalinda Appeihans Kloberdanz.
 
Postscript
 
On May 21, 1
985 the doors of Emmons Central High School were
 
locked following final commencement ceremonies. This t
ime, however, a
 
simple spring r
itual symbolizing another school year's end had
 
profound and deeply troubling significance to many German-Russian
 
families--the doors of Emmons Central were to remain permanently
 
closed. - 
Rising education costs and declining student enrollment were
 
cited as two of the major reasons for the parochial school's shutdown.
 
Newspaper reporter Lucille Hendrickson described the emotion-charged
 
event in an article entitled "Goodbye, Emmons Central, Goodbye
 
Fo>ever
 (The Bismarck Tribune, May 26, 1
985). Hendrickson perhaps
 
V
 
summed up the feelings of many people in the Strasburg, North Dakota
 
area with the words "the death of a school i
s a grievous thing for a
 
small community."
