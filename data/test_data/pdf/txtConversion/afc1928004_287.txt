My name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me ; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore ; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORCS. 
Roo:er,O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown ; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahy, or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated ; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight ; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm as (latent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations ; 
With a 
good deal of larnin' in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions ; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round. 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and scum). 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby ; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial afrairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, and wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see ; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me

MALONE AT THE BACK OF THE BAR. 
NY FATHER SOULD CHARCOAL. 
When I 
was a 
servant in sweet Tipperary, oh 
I 
was as smart as the Divil, 
And just as contrairy, oh! 
An Irish G-ossoon, 
And great was th' applause of it: 
My father sould charcoal. 
And that was the cause of it. 
CHORUS. 
An Irish Gossoon, 
And great was tie applause of it, 
My father sould charcoal. 
And that was the cause of it. 
Arrah, my mother poor soul, had a 
habit of drinking oh! 
She fell in a 
ditch, 
Which set her to thinking oh I 
A mammoth Phratee, 
And great was the size of it, 
Me mouth held a 
dozen, 
Which widened the breadth of it. 
An Irish Gossoon, &e. 
At a 
break-down or reel, It's highly and dutiful, 
And if to remember 
You need not stare at me, 
Sure I 
can wear my brogans, 
Both behind and in front of me. 
My father sould charcoal, 
And. that was the cause of it. 
An Irish G-ossoon, &e. 
And how does yeas do. I 
see yeas all laugh at me, 
And what would yeas give, 
For a 
nice Photogragh of me, 
And if to remember 
You need not so stare at me, 
Sure I'll give every mother's son of yeas, 
A lock of the hair of me.

I 
KEEP a 
saloon on the corner, my boys, 
And faith I've a 
flourishing trade ; 
I've brought out my cousin, Nathaniel Doyle, 
The money on whiskey I 
made. 
I 
could sell to you now a 
nice " Plisse GatTay," 
Or a " Rhino Victoria " cigar ; 
No slate, chalk, or pencil, is kept in the house 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
CHORES. 
Tra la la, tra la la! 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
I 
never was stood up for brandy or beer. 
My rule is to never give " tick ," 
When a 
bum's at the store on a 
cold winter's morn, 
It's meself that is making a " kick." 
I 
set out a 
lunch on the table so neat, 
Fat herrings, pre'sarved in a 
jar; 
I'd cut off the hand of a 
snooze'', or van-, 
That grabs when I'm back of the bar. 
Tra la hi, etc. 
The till I 
keep here in my pocket so safe, 
I 
light up toy kerosene lamps ; 
At daylight, I 
put up my shutters so tight, 
Then go in to count up my stamps. 
I'm open all day on a 
Sunday so gay, 
To the young girls I " tra la la la!" 
They'say as they pass by my window so sweet, 
Malone's at the back of the bar. 
Tra la la, etc.

SINCE TERRY FIRST JOINED THE GANG. 
COMIC SONG.

The Music of this song is published by E. H. TT AIIDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Mr name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terence is his name ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And he calls it a " super" and a " slang." 
Oh, my heart is broke. God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CIIOEUS. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning, 
And he'll give the door the devil's own bang; 
Oh, my heart is broke. God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home hut Thursday night, 
Sure, I 
talked to him very nice ; 
When he said, " Old man, you're eettity, too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on the ice." 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh, her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " 0
-anti." 
He'll come, etc. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until 
And if the policeman says " move on." 
He'll spit at him with spite ; 
He went to the mtrket only yerter 
And there he stole a " wipe " an:1 a" slan;" 
Now he's J.c>t three months in the P-nitetitiary, 
Along with the rest of the " ffan-." 
He'll come, etc. 
NELL FLAUGHERTY'S DRAKE, 
lry name it is Nell, right candid I 
tell, 
And I 
live near a 
cool hill I 
never will deny, 
I 
had a 
large drake, the truth for to apake, 
My eTandlather left me when going to die; 
ha was merry and sound and would weigh twenty poeind 
The universe round would I 
rove for hi.s sake, 
Bad luck et the rebbtr, be he drunken or sober, 
That murdered. Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
Ills neck it was green, and rare to be seen, 
lie was tit for a 
queen of the highest degree, 
Ilis body so white, it would yon delight. 
He was fat. plump, and heavy, and brisk as a 
bee. 
This dear little fellow, his legs they were yellow, 
lie could fly like a 
swallow-, 
or swim like a 
hake, 
But some wicked habbage, to grease his white cabbage, 
11113 murdered Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
May his pig never grunt, may his cat never hunt, 
That a 
ghost may him haunt in the dark of the night, 
May his hens never lay. may his horse never neigh, 
May his goat fly away like an nhl paper kite, 
:NI:1y his duck never quack, may his goose be turned black 
And pall down her stack with her long ycllow beak, 
May the scurvy and itch never part from the britch 
Of the wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake 
May his rooster ne'er crow. may his bellows not blow, 
Nor potatoes to grow,— may be never have none.— 
May his cradle not rock, mar his elleet have no lock. 
May his wife have no frock for to shade her back bone. 
That the bugs and the fleas may this wicked wretch tease. 
And a 
piercine- north breeze Linke him tremble and shake, 
May a 
fanr year's old bug- build a 
m-st in the lug 
Of the monster that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake-. 
May 43 pipe never smoke, may his tea-pot he broke, 
And mId t'i the joke, may his kettle not boil: 
May he be, poorly fed till the hour he is dead. 
May he always be fed on lobscouae and fish oil. 
May he swell with the goat till his grinders fall out, 
May he roar, howl and nhont with a 
lnrrid tooth-ache, 
May his temple wear horns alai his toes corns, 
The wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his dog yelp and howl with both huneer and cold, 
May his wife always scold till his brains go astray, 
May the curse of each hag, that ever carried a 
bag, 
Li-ht dawn on the wag till his head it SurrIS gray. 
Mev monkeys still bite him. and mad (lags athright him, 
And every one slight him asleep or awake, 
wasps ever gnaw- hini, and jaclzdaws ever claw him, 
The monster that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake! 
Bat the only good news T 
have to diffuse, 
is of Pet, r 
Hughes and Paddy MeCade, 
And crooked Ned Manson, and big nosed Bob Hanson, 
Each ore had a 
grandson of my beautiful drake. 
Oh. may bird he has dozens of nepl.aws and cousins, 
And one I 
must have, or my heart it will break, 
To keep my mind easy, or else III run crazy, 
land se ends the song. 
of my beautiful drake-

PADDY HEGARTY'S LEATHER BREECHES. 
It was at the sign of the Bell, on the road to Clonmel, 
Paddy flog,arty It- c• 
a 
neat shebeen; 
He sold pig's meat and bread, kept a 
goon lodgin' bed, 
And so well liked round the country had -- en; 
Himself and his wife both struggisd thro' life. 
In the week days rat mended the ditches, 
But on Sunday he dressed in a 
coat of the best, 
But his pride was his old leather breeches. 
Fol do rol. 
For twenty-one years at least so it appears. 
His father those breeches had run in— 
The morning he died, he to his bedside 
Called Paddy, his beautiful son, in! 
Advice then he gave ere he went to the grave 
He bid him take care of his riches— 
Says he it's no use to pop into my shoes, 
But I 
wish you'd step into my breeches. 
Fol de rol, tots. 
Last winter, the snow, left provisions so low, 
Poor Paddy was eat out complately; 
The snow °onling down he could not go to town. 
Thoughts of hunger soon bothered him greatly, 
One night as he lay dreaming away, 
About creedongs, frogs aud witches, 
He heard an uproar just outside the door 
And he jumpt to steal on his ould breeches. 
Fol do rot ; Ate. 
Says Bryan AFGuirk, with a 
voice like a 
Turk, 
Paddy come get us some eating, 
Says big Andy Moore. I'll burst open the door, 
For this is no night to be waiting ; 
Scarce had he spoke when the door went in broke 
And they crowded nround Paddy like leeches. 
By the greet mortal eel). if he di In•t them prog, 
They'd eat him clean out of his breeches. 
Fol de rot, &4? 
PADDY HEGARTY'S &c.,—[CoNcLuDED.1 
Now Paddy in dread slipt into the bed, 
That held Judy his darling wife in, 
And there he agreed to get them a 
feed— 
He slip t 
out and brought a 
big knife in ; 
lie took up the waist of his breeches—the beast, 
And cut out the buttons and fi titches, 
And cut them in strips by the way they were tripee, 
And boiled them, his ould leather breeches. 
Fol de lot, &c. 
When the tripes they stew'd, on a 
dish they strew'd, 
The boys all called out. Lord be thanked, 
nt Ilegarty's wife was afraid of her life, 
She thought it high time for to shank it. 
To see how they smiled, for they thought Pat had boiled 
Some mutton and beef of the richest, 
r3ut little they knew it was leather burgoo, 
That was made out of Paddy's ould breeches. 
Poi do rol, & c. 
They wollip the stuff. says Andy, it's tough, 
Says Paddy. You're nD judge of mutton; 
When Bryan MI -Quirk, on the point of a 
fork 
Lifted up a 
big ivory button : 
Says Darby, what's that ? sure I 
thought it was fat. 
Bryan leaps on his legs. and be screeches, 
By the powers above, I 
was trying to shove, 
My teeth through the flap of his breeches. 
Fol de rol, 
They made at Pat, he was gone out of that, 
Ile run when he found them all rising— 
Says Bryan, make haste, and go for the priest, 
By the holy saint Jackstone, I'm poisoned. 
Revenge for the joke they had, for they broke 
All the chairs, tables, bowls and dishes; 
And from that very night they will knock out your daylight 
If they catch you with leather breeches. 
Fol do rol, &e.

My sorrow is deep, 
Oh, why did you leave me 
To fret and to weep 7 
Come back, etc.

loved you, dear Addie, 
Sweet Addie Aileen, 
I 
called you " my darling," 
That was to have been ; 
I

Alas, T

How false and how fickle 
Is Addie ,Alleen. 
Come back, etc.

[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cabin. 
Enter TIM FLAHERTY, singing or whist-
ling "The Girl I 
left behind me." 
Bundle and stick on 
shoulder.] 
Tim.—Bad luck to it, here I've been trotting over the bogs 
for the last week since I 
landed on me own native sod, and 
norm a 
bit have I 
seen of the darlint I 
left behind me when I 
went over the say. 
I 
wonder where she hides her own pretty 
i 
face. 
Sure, it's of her I've been dreaming since I 
sailed away 
i 
in the big ship, night and day. I 
went over beyant to seek 
! 
me fortune, and it's devil a 
fortune I 
was after finding at all at 
, 
all. 
When I 
landed at Castle Garden, devil a 
castle or a 
garden 
i 
- 
I 
found there ; but a 
big chap sez to me: " Can you work ?" 
sez he. " I 
can," sez I. " What at?" sez he. " Anything," 
sez I. " All right," sez he ; " I'll make a 
builder or an archi-
I
tect of ye," sez he. " What's an architect ?" sez I. " Why," sez 
he, " thim's the boys that builds up the houses." Sure I 
thought 
, 
me fortune was made. " Follow me," sez he. " I 
will," sez I; 
and away we went into an illegant part of the city, I 
think 
they called it Baxter Street, and there I 
met me old friend, 
Tim Finnegan, who lives there. 
And he was an architect, 
too; and the first thing I 
knew after, I 
was breaking the 
small of me back going up a 
pair of stairs without any ban-
isters, and carrying a 
load of bricks. " Is this what you call an 
architect in this country ? " sez I. " It is," sez he. " Then I 
resign," sez I. " All right," sez he. 
And here I 
am. 
I'll 
sing ye a 
song all about me own adventures, and then I'll go 
on me travels again, for I 
feel like the devil knows what till I 
see me own little Irish girl once more. 
[Song is played. 
Between each verse "Rory O'More" is 
played, or any other jig tune, and Tot dances. 
At the last 
verse he exits dancing and swinging stick.]

He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment ; 
When be bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, aud took iv'ry eint, 
What to do didn't know, where was I 
to go; 
So I 
went to the coort, and explained to the judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six mouths in the island above.— Cho. 
So I 
shouldered rny bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin for ever, oh, she is my joy ! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ue'er can find afar o'er the sea ; 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.— Cho.

BOWLD zOJER BOY. 
Ott, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowid Sojer Boy; 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe, 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march thro', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry 
eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bowld Sojer Boy 
But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout, 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer By. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is 
before us, where the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refus., .-
c) score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
'Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy.' 
Then come along with me, Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with 3 
our l3owld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, ' twill be done 
In the snapping- of a 
gun, says the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
And 'tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of cur mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line hell 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his cops, like a 
Dowld_ Soler Boy.

Price 40 cents. 
W E 
are privates in the Sixty-Ninth, 
We follow up the fife and the drum ; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
It was there with bayonets bristling, 
In the thickest of the fray, 
Where the shot and shell were wYstling, 
Our boys help'd gain the day. 
CHORUS. 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread, 
In the gallant Sixty-Ninth Regiment. 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true ; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are one and all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march, etc. 
Should America call on her soldier boys, 
To the front we'd boldly go; 
For a 
righteous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe. 
Well ne'er 1ot-0-et old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
" 
Faugh a 
ballagh " our cry, clear the way, 
To conquer or to die. 
We march, etc.

W E 
started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare ; 
Oh, it was a 
lively party! 
You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I 
say ! 
Sure we had a 
roaring racket, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she mint ! off she wint ! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint ! 
The sate was jist as Lard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Hould her in !" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her !" says McCue ; 
I 
thourdit I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew ! 
Me head was swimming like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint ! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
chit ! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
" 
Hould her in !" etc. 
TTTP, RUNAWAY MARE.—Concluded, 
Me dacent coat was tore, 
Me hat was left behind me; 
I 
rattled and I 
swore, 
And I 
thought the dust would blind me; 
In holes and ditches wint the wheels-
0, murther! such a 
day ! 
Sure mesilf was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint ! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare.

Hould her in!" etc.

SEE bow fast from heaven, mother, 
Fall the feath'ry flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below ; 
Ere they melt I'll leave you, mother, 
Leave for e'er this world of pain; 
Something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain ; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
How I 
lovid alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown. 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown ; 
Soon beside the rippling river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
Do not weep, etc.

Ah, then, mam dear, did you never hear of purty Molly I3ral-
laghan ? 
Troth, dear, I 
have lost her, and I'll never be a 
man again, 
Not a 
spot on my hide will another summer tan again, 
Since .Molly she has left me alone for to die. 
The place where my heart was, von might easy rowl turnips in, 
It's the size of all Dublin, and from Dublin to the Devil's Glin, 
If she chose to take another, sure she might have sent mine back 
a(min, 
And not leave me here all alone for to die. 
Mam dear, I 
remember, when the milking time was past and gone, 
We went into the meadows where she swore I 
was the only man 
That ever she could love—yet, oh ! the base, the cruel one, 
After all that to leave me here alone for to die ! 
Main, dear, I 
remember as we came home the rin began, 
I 
rol'd her in my coat, tho' devil a

have on, 
And my shirt was rather fine-dran

After all that, she left rue here alone for to die.

went and told my tale to Father ArDonnel, mam,

SAINT P ATRICK was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
onOnns. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed ; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer ; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat.; 
The green, my boys ;
 ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's (lay parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc.

BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
AIR—" Darling Onld Stick. 
It was one winter's day, about six in the morn, 
When a 
little innocent creature was born; 
There was doctor and nurse, and a 
great many more, 
But none of them saw such a 
baby before. 
They all swore I 
was like my papa, 
" 
Yes. and see, there's the nose of his mamma 
With a 
few alterations, oh, la, Ii, 
We'll make him a 
beautiful boy." 
" 
To make him a 
beauty," cried out Mrs. Sneer, 
" 
be troubled unless the child has a 
sweet leer." 
Then to give me this leer Mrs. Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose. 
This made me to wink and to blink so, 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh, 
And at last it turned into a 
squint, oh, 
Which made me a 
beautiful boy. 
• 
To make me accomplished, I 
wanted one thing, 
Mv month was too small for the dear child to sing, 
Then to stretch it and, spread it they all of them tried, 
Till they stretched my sweet mouth nearly half a 
yard wide 
Crying: " Pull away now, Mrs. Rider, 
It must be a 
little hit wider." 
Illy dear mouth they split pretty high, sir, 
All to inake me a 
beautiful boy, 
Now, being complete, I 
was next sent to school, 
And to show off my make, was stuck on a 
high stool, 
When the children went home, they cried out with surprise: 
" 
We have a 
new boy at school with such beautiful eyes! 
Ile can look any way so handy, 
Such a 
mouth he has got to suck candy ! 
And his legs are so preciously handy, 
They call him the beautiful boy." 
T'other day I 
was asked in the city to dine. 
'The ladies, in raptures, all thought me divine; 
And all, when observine- my elegant grace. 
Neglected their dinner to look at my face. 
They cried : " I 
shall faint with surprbie I 
No .gas-lights can equal his eyes, 
And such a 
month fin. mince- pies! 
Law ! ain't he a 
beautiful boy I" 
Now, ladies, beware of Love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am I 
shall steal all your hearts. 
And then. you dear, sweet little creat iii•es. you'll sigh, 
And dont on my charms till you languish and die. " 
For, you know, I 
can't marry pat all, 
Yet, lielieve me, Nvlienever you call, 
My endeavors will lie to please all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy.

PADDY DON'T CARE. 
Some people there are you never can please, 
I 
am one who takes everything at my ease ; 
There was never a 
woman ever frightened MO 
With their tongue, though a 
dozen battled with me, 
And everything I 
take very cool ; 
As to fretting, Pm not quite such a 
fool ; 
Of troubles, like others, I 
have my share, 
It's all one to me, for Paddy don't care 1 
CHORUS. 
I'm as frisky as a 
lamb, merry as a 
grig, 
The pipes I 
can play, can dance a 
good jig, 
if the sky was to fall, and all the birds in the air. 
Contented I 
am, for Paddy don't care. 
I 
live in a 
lane at the end of a 
street 
Up a 
garret, down stairs, is my country seat; 
The air is delightful, pleasant and pure, 
There's a 
pond for the ducks in front of the door; 
No trouble my room I 
have ever to find, 
There is but one room in the house, do you mind. 
Though all the sides and top is quite bare, 
I'm as happy as a 
queen, for Paddy don't care. [ I'm as, &
c 
There's my better half, and the best half too, 
Though the priest made us one she's enough for two, 
Sometimes, very often, but seldom does taste, 
Seven days in the week she's as drunk as a 
baste, 
The family china she smashes to bits, 
if I 
say but a 
word, like a 
tom cat she spits, 
On the floor does a 
shuffle, pulls me by the hair, 
Like a 
lion I 
stand it, for Paddy don't care. [ I'm as, dEo 
On the ground is my bed, straw for my tick, 
The beetles and crickets for warmth to inc stick, 
The stars for my candle, don't dread fire ft•om a 
spark, 
If the moon isn't up, go to bed in the dark, 
For music, by the powers, its myself got the ear, 
The cat's hold a 
concert which I (ion% pay to hear, 
It's grand the love notes they sing I 
declare, 
Some dislike such music, but Paddy don't care. [ I'm as, tire. 
Fin contented and happy, quiet as a 
lamb, 
Like a 
lion when roused the devil I 
ant, 
I 
have seventeen children, young, stout and strong, 
And twins am expecting every day before long. 
I 
smile and feel such pleasure, delight, 
To se sumuling faces around me each night, 
For we are all born, all have trouble a 
snare, 
It's a 
pleasure to please you, so Paddy don't care. [ I'm as, & c. 
CROOS-NEEN LAWN. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman does his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet scented. lawn,

Oh, my smiling little Croos-keen lawn.

But the whole iv the crew couldn't lather us two, 
That's rneself an'me blackthorn 
llo stick got excited. it wanted to fight, it 
Longed to take part in the battle ; 
It hit Shaughnessy's Tod such a 
belt on the head 
Lb-at it knocked him stone blind at the raffle.

On, love, let me kiss the sweet blushes away, 
That bloom on your cheeks like the roses of May ; 
Those lips full of nectar, I 
fondly would press, 
And give you a 
gentle, a 
loving caress; 
There's none that is sweeter, more blithesome and gay, 
Then you, pretty blossom, sweet Maggie McKay.

Oh, love, let me kiss the sweet blushes away, 
That bloom on your cheeks like the roses of May; 
There's none that is sweeter, more blithesome and gay, 
Than you, pretty blossom, sweet Maggie McKay. 
Oh, come little darling, and fly to this breast, 
And let your brown curls in tranquillity rest; 
The spring of my life on your image is shed, 
And happiness truly shines over your head ; 
There's none that is dearer, oh list what I

For you are a

Oh, love, let, etc. 
Oh, love, may a 
sorrow ne'er wither thy face, 
That has not as yet felt the least little trace ; 
May days ever joyous roll on till their close, 
Thy heart never know of this life's bitter woes ; 
There's none that is fonder, more bright than the day, 
None half so bewitching as Maggie McKay. 
Oh, love, let, etc.

/RISE SCHOWITAATEX 
Old Teddy O'Rourke kept al it of a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and made its rule, • 
If the mind wouldn't mark faith he'd soon mark the back, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devilish crack. 
His scholars were: Jerry, Mg Billy, and Ned, 
With Murrough M'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, 
Tall Dermot O'Clany, and Dennis O'Shea, 
Faith, all noble boys to drive learning away. 
SPOKEN - Well, my boys, says old Tea, as you are all here, I'll jnst 
be calling 'your names over, to see it any of yo are missing. 
Gerald 
l'Shee.-I'm not here, sir.- Then where are you, astral: ?-I'm astride 
of the door, sir.--Then come in, and I'll beat you. Corney O'llaherty,

)fellow ! 
I'm sorry he's gone home, for be was my own scholar; but do 
sou go and sit down, and don't fall asleep, or rif be after waking you-
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he's always ready, 
To kick up a 
row or the whiskey t-o 
smack; 
With his drinking and eating, 
ills birching and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row de dow whack. 
Faith, Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton. 
And a 
chin, too! och honey. but they were all one; 
A grin, too, he Lad, and if there was a 
noise, 
He'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
L fortune he had, too :- his birch and. Ins wig, 
A black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pretty plantation, a 
dog aud a 
cat. 
And his head that he kept in an old gretsy hat. 
SPOKEN.—Thelim O'Maheney, saya he, one day, before you sit down, 
pseud up, and say your alphabet, so keep your five fingers out of your 
head for a 
few minutes, and begin.

HIGH PRIVATE BARNEY. 
Ate:-" Captain Do Wellington Boots." 
You can see I 
belong to the army, 
You can tell that av coorse be my style, ; 
I 
delight in the title ot Barney, 
And upon me the ladies all smile. 
In the ranks of the Forty-Second Stand-Backs 
I 
hold an important command, 
And perhaps you'll permit me to tell you, 
There are no finer men in the land. 
Spoken.-On, the divil a 
bit. Look at me, girls. There's a 
speeiment. 
But what I 
like best is to 
La da, da with the ladies, 
For that is the style you see, 
The noble frame and glorious names 
Of high private Barney, that's me. 
I 
tell them fine tales about battles, 
Which the darlings are anxious to hear 
But what the smell of powder is like, 
I 
have not the slightest idea. 
They tidal: I 
have done glorious deeds, 
And have oft made the enemy fly, 
But I 
haven't as yet, and what's more, 
I 
have no intention to try. 
Spoken-But what could be more glorious than to die for your 
country ? 
What more glorious than a 
bullet in the eye? But what I 
like best is to 
La, da, da, tzo. 
I 
drive a 
fine car that's a 
picture, 
I've a 
mare that's the divil to go; 
Of an afternoon I 
take a 
canter, 
Or take the girls to see the show ; 
They whisper. " See ! there goes Barney," 
And smile when they see me so grand, 
As I 
tip the heeetif al Harney, 
In this " Mirror of Ou?d Ireland." 
Spoken --leis, I 
drive a 
fine animal- if he was any finer you couldn't 
see him at all. 
He is so fine you can read a 
letter throne!' him. I 
tied a 
knot on his tail to keep him from slipping through his collar. I 
gave ray horse a 
noble name-I 
call him .

THE WAKE OF MR. O'LEARY. 
Ant:—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
In Ireland, so I've heard, 
To wake the dead they have a 
way, 
They get dead drunk, and on the tiure, do lay 
At the- wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Ile whit quite dead, ono Sunday night, 
Which put his friends in sad athight, 
Front this world he had taken flight, 
So they drank his health with all their might. 
They danced and reeled about. Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made 'em feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
Swearing, tearing, all the night, 
Putting whiskey out of sight, 
Good cheer, did all the guests invite, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary-. 
Twas in the first fiure under ground, 
Where all the mirth, sure, did abound, 
And where the whiskey, quick- wilt round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
There was a 
policeman oil' his bate, 
Among the rest, came to the fate, 
And rowled about like many a 
baste, 
I'm sure he did not drink the laste. 
Then Saul's dead march, the piper played, 
But I 
ant told he ne'er got paid, 
To spike the truth I'm not afraid, 
About the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, ifc. 
'Twas in the middle of the fun, 
I 
think just at the hour of one, 
The guests they mighty- quick did run, 
From the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
O'Leary, if I 
don't mistake, 
Thought it high time that he should wake. 
Wid fear, says he, Ill make ' en) quake, 
So he rave the coffin a 
sudden shake. 
Thin ould Leary loud did cry, 
This waking me is all me eye, 
For I 
niver did intind to die, 
I 
didn't says Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing. tearing, &c. 
For help the guests quite lend did call. 
Och, murder. thieves, each one did bawl 
Och. wasn't there a 
precious squall, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Ltaty. 
Ohl Leary thin did come to view, 
And at the company be flew. 
And bate them all sure. Mack and blue, 
och. 'pun my soul all this is thine. 
Some en crutches lndobled home, 
And swore aeain 
ne'cr would roam, 
While others loud, with pains did groan, 
With the bating they got from O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, etc. 
DERMOT'S FAREWELL. 
Answer to You'll soon forget Kathleen.' 
I 
can ne'er forget thee, Kathleen. 
Thou wilt still be dear to me. 
My foot may rove a 
foreign land, 
My heart will dwell with thee. 
Those happy hours with thee I 
pass'd 
I 
never can forget, 
And though we're doomed by fate to part, 
I 
leave thee with regret. 
Then dry thy tears, my Kathleen, 
0 
more upon me smile, 
An 
I 
soon return to thee, love, 
And the sunny Emerald Isle. 
Strange faces cannot sever 
Our thoughts from those we love. 
Ah ! vain ' tis thy endeavor, 
True hearts they cannot move; 
Above them all, a 
brighter spell, 
Is o'er our native home, 
A charm that binds the heart there still, 
Where'er the foot may roam. 
Then weep no more. my Kathleen, 
Once again upon me smile, 
And I'll soon return to thee. love, 
And the sunny Emerald Isle. 
TERRY MALONE. 
One ev'nine from market returning, 
Just thinking of what I'll not name; 
May-be some of ye guess, ah 3 
now don't yell 
For ' tis few have not thought of the same. 
But my heart is as open as sunshine, 
A secret lies heavy as stone; 
So I'll even confess, without blushing, 
I 
was thinking of Terry Malone. 
If you swam of some one I'll not mention, 
It is certain, they say, he'll appear, 
And so of the lad I 
was thinking, 
By the bosheen I 
saw him draw near. 
I 
was pleased .cet sorry to see him, 
And he asked me to meet him alone; 
For I 
very well knew what be wanted, 
So avoided poor Terry Malone. 
Coming home the next ev'ning quite lonely, 
All at once who (I've think I 
did spy: 
But Terry himself in a 
flurry, 
And oh ! such a 
be im in his eye! 
Where's the use to descend to partielars, 
Enough if the end he made known— 
That same niobt, by the moon. I 
consente4, 
To become Mistress Terry Malone.

OH! BREATHE NOT HIS NAME. 
By THOMAS MoORE. 
Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade, 
Where cold and unhonored his relics are laid ; 
Sad, silent, and dark be the tears that we shed, 
As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head. 
But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps, 
Shall brighten with verdure the grave where he sleeps ; 
And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls, 
Shall long keep his memory green in our souls.

THE IRISH DRAGOON 
By CHARLES LEVER, Esq. 
Ant:—" Sprig of Shillelah." 
Oh love is the soul of an Irish Dragoon, 
in battle, in bivouac, or in saloon— 
From the tip of his spur to his bright sabre-tasche. 
With his soldierly gait and his bearing so high, 
his gay laughing look and his light speaking eye, 
lie frowns at his rival, and ogles his wench, 
He springs on his saddle and chases the French— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
His spirits are high, and he little knows care, 
Whether sipping his claret or charging a 
square— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
As ready to sing or to skirmish he's found, 
To take off his wine or to take up his ground ; 
When the bugle may call him how little he fears 
To charge forth in column and beat the Mounseers— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
When the battle is over he gaily rides back 
To cheer every soul in the night bivouac, 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
Oh, there you may see him in full glory crown'd 
And he sits 'mid his friends on the hardly won ground, 
And hear with what feeling the toa4 he will give 
As he drinks to the land where all Irishmen live— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
CARAY YOUR FRIEND IN YOUR POCKET. 
I 
don't say its right, but there's a 
saying quite true, 
If you've goodness at least twill shock it. 
It's that sottish expression " Mind number one, 
And carry your friend in your pocket." 
'Tis a 
palpable fact, and requiring great tact, 
Clint poverty's inroad to block it ; 
For friendship's all fudge, and that you May judge, 
if you hav'nt a 
rap in your pocket. 
Whilst you're young and in health, by induxt\.y gain waalt11. 
Your coffer you'll very soon stock it; 
After that you can go and be scraped and bowed to, 
As they know you've a 
friend in your pocket. 
When • tis known you have cash, why the veriest 
You utter, goes off like a 
rocket ; 
You're a ' brick' tho' a 
stick, and are flatter'd till sick, 
Thro' the friend that you've got in your pocket. 
But be poor and in want, and just ask for a 
loan. 
The need you set forth they oft mock it, 
And say,

can't,' 
Or, ' I 
havn't as much in my pocket.' 
They say ' tis no sin, to be wanting in tin, 
The nerve of those needy, ' twill shock it, 
So wher'er you may roam, abroad or at homo, 
Put our only true friend in your pocket. 
THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK. 
On the eighth (lay of March it was, some people say 
That St. Patrick at midnight lie first saw the day; 
While others declare ' twas the ninth he was born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and morn, 
For mistakes will occur in a 
hurry and shock, 
And some blamed the baby—and some blamed the cloak.-
'Till with all their cross questions sure no one could know 
If the child was too fast—or the clock wa4,3 too slow. 
Now the first faction fight in owld Ireland, they say, 
Was all on account of St. Patrick's birth-day; 
Some fought for the eighth— for the ninth more would 
-die.‘, 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blacken'd his eye I 
At last both thc factions as positive grew, 
0„ 
That kept each a 
birth-day—so Pat then had two, 
"fill Father Mulcahy, who showed them their sins, 
Said ' no one could have two birthdays but a 
pair of twine 
Says he, ' boys, don't be fighting for eight or for nine, 
Don't be always dividing(,—but sometimes combine : 
Combine eigi.t, with nine, and seventeen is the mark, 
So let that be his birthday," Amen,' says the clerk. 
If he wasn't a 
twin, sure our hisrry will show— 
That at haste he is worth two saints that we know!' 
Then they all got blind drunk—which completed their Use ; 
And we lopt up the practice from that day to Ulla.

NORAH MALOY. 
Ant :—" 
Wishing Gate." 
One fine sunnner's day, in the night rather late, 
Paddy Flinn had sneaked off to the old wishing gate, 
To just try his hand at a 
sort of a 
spell, 
About things that his auld mother used for to tell; 
That fairies and conjurers squatted down there, 
To give phat folks ax'd at that time of the year. 
So Paddy went there just his luck for to try, 
And he wished for a 
pig to put into his sty ; 
But wait awhile yet as the truth I 
relate, 
Phat happened to Pat at the wishing gate. 
(Spoken)—Och ! sure, Paddy was a 
good boy enough, if he 
had not been such a 
bad one ; and, sure, mighty fond of 
me he was. 
Oth! sure he fell in love wid me before he 
saw me. 
Oct)! faith, that's true for me, so it is ; 
for ho 
was atter telling me widout speaking a 
word of mouth— 
bat, och ! faith it was by word of eye he was after telling 
me. 
Tie was born at Kilkenny ; but sure he was such a 
l'ON big blade, that he run away from home before he eoula 
walk. 
But wait awhile ag) till Fse tell yez how the wish-
ing gate was after sarving him. 
" 
I 
wish for," says Pat, as the gate he did stride, 
" 
As I've got but one pig, just another beside ; 
And I 
wish for some prattles, the pigs for to fade; 
And I 
wish they might brade, and knock up a 
good trade, 
I'd then buy some poultry, ducks and a 
cow, 
[1] 
NORAH MALOY—[CoNcLuDED. 
And a 
thumping shillelah,to kick up a 
row; 
And then I 
cud get me a 
handsome young bride, 
And bogtrotting Katty ( Spokot—That's me) I'd then push 
aside." 
But little did Pat know he was overheard, 
But, faith, I 
was there, and sucked in every word. 
(Spoken)—Och! bad luck to yez, Paddy, says I, you 
desaver; but not a 
word did I 
spake. 
Sure is this the way 
you are true-hearted by your falsehood ? 
And every word 
of truth you told me was a 
lie. 
Well, I 
kept on talking 
widout saying a 
word. 
So away went Paddy on first and 
I 
before him, crying lit to break the heart of me widout 
shedding a 
tear. 
So up he goes to the pig-sty to see had 
he got the other pig. 
Och! by the faith of me, the only 
pig he had left was gone, and had run away wid the pratie 
garden in his pocket. 
Arrah, Paddy, says I, phat's this you 
have been after wishing? Where are the pigs you arn't 
got? 
Where's the poney thit's not born too? Where's 
your poultry and ducks ? 
Faith you are after looking like 
a 
goose ! 
Where's the cow you was after axing the wish-
ing gate for? 
Sure and that cow's a 
bull ! 
And faith and 
troth, where is myself, the bogtrotter, that 3.tu will dis-
charge before you have me ; and where's the shillelah, the 
shillelalt that you are going to kick up a 
row Avid? 
Arrah, 
faith and sure, here's that same un, cried Jerry Donovan ; 
and faith, Paddy, I'll* be after giving you phat you havo 
been axing for—so I 
will. 
So Jerry hit on to Pat, and Pat 
fell to tearing all the bald hair off his head—for the fairy 
had made an old man of him, thought he was only twenty. 
lie got blind of both legs, lame of both eyes, his elbows 
down at heels, and his heels out at elbows ; so I 
hope 
it will be a 
warning to all greedy folks, and teach us to be 
contented wid what we have, whether we have got it or 
not.

THE KILKENNY BOY. 
I 
went to school to Darby Toole, 
Who'd been a 
soldier I 
was told; 
His talk of wars, drums, and scars, 
Came over me when nine years old. 
I 
thought of drums instead of slims, 
Shillaleh being my writing pen, 
My only books being outside crooks, 
My only joy was fightin' men. 
Then disdaining brogues, I 
crossed the bog', 
And marched as stout as any boy, 
The girls would cry when me they'd spy, 
There's Larry Moore the Irish Boy. 
CHORUS. 
The nice, the nate, the swats complate, 
The handsome fine Kilkenny Boy. 
When older grown, the girls ochono, 
'Bout their hearts they twisted me, 
'Till Sargent Shay, he came one day 
And by the powers, he enlisted me. 
And Betty Burn, she left her churn 
And cried, you've been decaivin' me 
And Kitty O'Neil, faith I'll go bail, 
She'll break her heart for lavin' me. 
So in this plight, a 
sojer tight, 
I 
marched as stout as any boy, 
The foes to pelt, the fair to melt, 
Itione equall'd the Kilkenny Boy. 
• 
The nice, the nate, the swath complato, 
The handsome fine Kilkenny Boy. 
But Sargent Shay ho died one day, 
A bullet laid him on the floor ; 
And the same polthogue that spoilt his brogue, 
A Sargent made of Larry Moore. 
And when in peace, the fighthe did ceaae, 
Of girls oohone, I 
had a 
few 
Who tried to tazo, but none could plaza 
Like pnrty Widow Donahue. 
For it is herself, that has the pelf, 
And ' tis myself can spend it joy; 
She cried, ochone : you're all my own, 
My darling lump of an Irish Boy. 
Yon'ro the broth of a 
boy, my P.N1"01, my 5°Y, 
My handsome fine Kilkenny Boy.

Cease to Love." 
in the bogs, on the road, in a 
cabin, 
At Donnybrook Fair, or a 
wake; 
Whether rolling in rags or in riches, 
Paddy love to the shemales '

He's all there to tip 'em the blarney, 
Ahone, love ! my own dove! 
And vowing on his bended knees, 
lie nicer will cease to love. 
Pat niver will cease to love, 
Till burning hot Vesuvius freeze, 
Pat niver will cease to love ! 
Till Irish Ball's milk makes Dutch cheese, 
Pat will Myer cease to love 
For whiskey, and fighting, and glory, 
Pat's the boy, barring none to the fore; 
Tho' I'm kilt twenty times in the battle, 
Shure I'll make love a 
I 
the more. 
May shainrocks turn into bulrushes, 
And may pigs -- change to figs, 
Till highlows grow upon boot-trees, 
Pat ilver will cease to love! 
He /liver will cease to love I 
Til Licensed Victuallers sell good tea, 
Pat niver will cease to love ! 
Till fried red herrings swim the sea, 
Pat niver will cease to love i 
Till Brian Boror comes back to life, 
Till buthermilk turns to ink; 
Till Irish boys all take the pledge 
And only cold wather drink 
Till ships sail on the skies below, 
And the ocean rolls above, 
Till skies rain down red burning snow, 
Pat niver will cease to love I 
He niver will cease to love I 
Till whiskey chokes ould Nick below 
Pat niver will cease to love ! 
Till you all old as Methuselah grow, 
fat niver will cease to love I

Ali, poll I 
botheration, dear Ireland's the nation 
Whorn man every joy upon earth may obtain, 
Where with hospitality, conviviality, 
Friendship and open sincerity reign ; 
Sure I've roam'd the world over from Dublin to Dover, 
But in all the strange countries wherever I've been, 
I 
never saw an island on sea or on dry land 
Like Paddy's own sweet little island of green. 
CHORUS. 
The sweet little island, the dear little island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little island of green. 
In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward; 
But share for its beauty an liishinan's duty 
Will teach him his own nit iv.' plant to regard; 
St. Patrick he set it, with dew-drops he wet it, 
And often to cnerish and bless it was seen ; 
Its virtues are rare, too, it's fresh and it's fair, too, 
And blooms but in Ireland's own island of green. 
The sweet little island, & c. 
A sprig from each stern forms a 
rich varied gem, 
More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn, 
Together unolighted, unsullied, united, 
it blooms a 
bouquet beauty's breast to adorn ; 
Oh 1 
lone- may they flourish, may heaven's dews nourish 
Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen ; 
May no fital blunder e'er tear them asunder, 
But long be they wreathed in the island of green. 
The sweet little island, & c. 
Success to old Ireland. its bog and its mireland, 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun ; 
For honor, for spirit, fidelity, merit, 
For wit and 0-ood fellowship, frolic and fun ; 
With wine and with whiskey, when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen, 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native island of green. 
The sweet little island, &AD.

MOLLIE McGOEMLY. 
An Irish Song and Dance by Jorix TnomrsoN. 
I 
WAS born long ago in the sweet county Monaghan, 
In the middle of a 
bog, I 
never will get on again, 
The Shamrock, the ship that I 
over here came sailing in, 
With those big blackguards of sailors all a 
purnpin' and a 
bailin' in ; 
Across the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and butter milk, 
Musha bathershin-na-bocklish 
I'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
It's when I 
left old Ireland my patience it was taxin' 0! 
A 
nate lock of my bright red hair sure every one was axin' 0 ! 
They all set up a 
hullabaloo, the gossoons and the colleen 
bawns, 
To leave the pigs and praties with the fairies and the leper-
acauns; 
To cross the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
l'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
I'm,goin' to settle down when I 
get a 
bit of property, 
As large as any bog in shweet Shlather-Mac-O'Dougherty, 
I'll go in for women's rights when here I 
am a 
resident, 
I'll be an alderwoman then or else a 
faymale president. 
SPOKEN.—Then bad luck to me if ever I— 
Cross the seas for ninety days. 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
I'm sportin' Mollie 0 ! (Denee.)

A MAN AIN'T A HORSE IF HE'S BORN IN A.

Sung by BILRY ASHCROFT. 
Ain.—" Our Grandfathers' Days." 
OF 
an illigant family, near Tipperary, 
As dacent a 
lot as e'er shouldered a 
hod, 
I 
was sprung, and so thinking the prospect to vary, 
Left my old ancient ancestors' home, and the sod; 
I'd a 
twist of the brogue I 
determined to alter, 
And speak native English—jinteel of course ; 
If bred up a 
foreigner, why should I 
falter '? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
To be hired for a 
footman, I'd fixed it complately, 
To a 
great man who hated a 
tight Irish lad, 
Anti would not keep a 
servant but talked English nately, 
Tf a 
divil a 
one on the earth could be had ; 
" 
What are you," says he.—" Why an Englishman, honey." 
" 
Where born V'—Why.in Ireland, my jewel of course." 
"That can't be."—" It can, sir; 
I'll bet any money. 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse." 
Tol de rol, etc. 
He gabb'd and he chattered his cockneyshire blarney— 
Bade me and my brogue to the divil go roam ; 
Says 1, " If Bow- bells was the lakes of Killarney, 
The divil a 
cockney would be born at home !•' 
Cries he, 
You pronounce neither one thing nor t'other.' 
Says I, " I've a 
tongue sure, for better for worse ; 
'Bout pronouncification, then, why make a 
bother ? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse." 
Tol de rol, etc. 
At last all the innkeepers, where'er I 
enter'd, 
Bawl'd, " Put down the potatoes !" by way of disgrace. 
" 
Where the divil," thinks I, " can their knowledge be centred, 
Be my soul they must see I've the brogue in my face !" 
So though I 
talk English so native and aisy, 
My plump Irish features betray ma of course ! 
Yet I 
proved to your faces as nate as a

Though born in a

BRIGADIER ERANIGA_N. 
Wunr I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me; 
t 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
lagan. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I ' listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
SPORES.—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six feet 
five, and as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's walk— 
people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to come in-
to may mother's shebeen-shop every morning for a 
noggin of whis-
key, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in and the 
battles he wasn't in ; about the Generals he killed and the Gen-
erals that killed him, until he had me as full of military ardor 
as an egg is full of 
meat. 
One morning he said to me, 
" 
Paldy," said he, " will you take a 
snilling's farth 1" 
Said I, 
'• I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute." " Oh," said he, " you 
don't understand me, the Queen wants men." " Well," said I, " I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the Queen." 
No, 
no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you list 3" " I 
don't 
mind if I 
do," said I. 
So I 
donned the reg:imentals and off I 
started to his

Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing

But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, you're put-
tin :* your foot in it ; 
Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, espe,...ially Judy O'Cala-
gan; 
Who I 
left with a

my hand. " Hould on, Paddy, me boy," said he ; " discipline

lie put the mug to his mouth and

there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot 1" " Forward,

didn't execute the order quick enough, he drew 
his sword and hit me with the flat of it across the hip, which 
made me limp off to his

Soon into battle we went, where the bullets where shooting and 
flying sure ; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying- sure ; 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy O'Ca-
lagan; 
With the Brigadier's head it made free, faith it finished Briga-
dier Branigan. 
BPI:al:N.—Yes, there we stood, Murphy on one side, I 
on the 
other and the Brigadier in the middle, when along came a 
bomb-
shell 
taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah 1" 
cried Murphy, raising his hand. " We're free at last!" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand ! I've 
lost me hand : ' " Hould your gab, you black- guard," said I, 
" 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
says about it." 
I 
went over to where he was lying. " Are you kilt T' said I 
He didn't condescend to speak to me. " if you have any request 
to make," said I, " if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you." 
" 
Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and spach-
less, and if you have any regards for me, you'll be after going 
over the field and looking for my head, place it on my should-
ers, and see me buried dacently." " 
do that same," said I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last I 
came to 
it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whiskey. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. I 
brought it over to him. " There's your head," said 
I. " No Paddy, that's not my head." " Yes it is," said I. " No, 
it's not," said he. " Well, head or no head," said I, " divil an-
other head you'll get from me 1" So I 
threw his head in his face 
au. I 
ran off singing 
Rub a 
dub, etc.

ALL THE WORLD AROUND.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
Where are prayers for Ireland, 
Breathed soft and low— 
Earnest prayers and tender, 
Asking God to send her 
Peace and joy and splendor, 
Ending all her woe ? 
They are heard wherever 
Ireland's sons are found, 
From snow-clad lands to tropic sands, 
All the world around. 
Cho.—All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
To heaven they rise, through all the skies, 
All the world around. 
Where is aid for Ireland, 
If the need should be ? 
If a 
foe oppress her, 
If a 
wrong distress her, 
Men who would redress her, 
Where shall Ireland see ? 
Here, in crowds uncounted, 
here such men are found, 
And friends as true, not faint or few, 
All the world around. 
Cho.—All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
Fond hearts and bold, she may behold, 
All the world around. 
Yes, beloved Ireland, 
All so dear thou art, 
Where your men, or hoary, 
Tell of Brian's glory, 
Where O'Neill's sad story 
Thrills through many a 
heart; 
Where Emmet's speech is spoken, 
Where Moore's sweet songs resound, 
Where fond acclaim greets Grattan's name, 
All the world around. 
Cho.—All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
There's help and cheer for Ireland dear, 
All the world around.

THE IRISH tfiCTOR. 
As sung by the late SAM. COLLINS, England's greatest Irish COIRI
O. 
AIR.—" Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
By way of an introduction, my name is Mr. Denis O'Shea, 
Long before I 
was born, so they tell me, I 
wrote a 
most illigant 
play; 
The poetry, plot, and conception, e'en the great Shakespeare 
couldn't surpass; 
'Twas pertaining to tragedy„comedy, opera, burlesque, and 
farce; 
It so puzzled the play-folks to act it that it was going to be put 
on the shelf, 
So I 
popped up behind the green curtain and acted the whole 
play myself. 
SPOKEN.— Sure and faith, precocious talent was the family 
badge of the O'Shea's. 
My father could say the alphabet before 
he could speak, and strutLed and fretted his hours on the stage 
'fore he was short-coated ; but for the matter of that, he was al-
ways short- coated, for the only coat he had to his back was a 
pair of leather breeches, and were down at the heel; but as 
Shakespeare says in his play of Umphry Clinker— 
" 
0! that estates and offices were given to the merit of the winner, 
how many hungry mouths would be well fed, 
flow many be well clad, whin they were naked, 
How many be employed whin out of work, 
how many have full pockets that are empty." 
Sure and faith, it was just so with father, for he always had the 
most labor to deo when lie was out of work; and he was a 
man of 
strict honor, that he always washed his hands of a 
dirty act iGn be-
(1) 
THE IRISH ACTOR.—Continued. 
fore he did it, so that he even commanded respect from the great 
that were dead and buried; and he used to say as Shakespeare 
said in the words of Ben Johnson : 
Put honor in one eye and your fist in the other, 
And I'll see them both in blindness, 
As I 
love the name of honor more than I 
do the first. 
CHORUS. 
Ant.—" St. Patrick was a Gentleman." 
That I'm an actor bred and born, sure there's no one can deny, 
sirs, 
At my tragedy they laugh, at my comedy they cry, sirs ; 
My voice and action's just the style, in favor Pm advancing, 
And instead of singing of my songs, by the powers they're done 
by dancing. 
SPOKEN.—Arrah, sure I'm the broth of a 
boy for that same, as 
Shakespeare says in the words of Goldsmith— 
" 
Many a 
flower is born to blush unseen, 
Looked but coldly on sure everywhere." 
And wasn't Shakespeare a 
sample of that same. William Shake-
speare was born at Stratford in Bow in the county Cork, the north 
part of Ireland ; he showed marks of very early genius in his 
youth, and paid great attention to his learning by playing the 
truant every day he went to school. 
He passed his time in 
poaching and deer stealing, which so delighted the lord of the 
manner that he gave youtyr Shakespeare three months in New-
gate, only Billy gave them lecr-bail, and escaped from prison be-
fore they got him in it; so he walked every step of the way to 
London by riding in a 
war/on ; but after all be couldn't dance a 
song like this,.-- Dances an Irish jig.)

"THE BLACK-BACKED COW." 
This melody is of high antiquity; it was adopted as a 
party 
tune during the wars in Ireland of 168S-90: the " black-backed 
Cow" representing, by a 
very whimsical metaphor, the cause of 
the exiled monarch. 
The following stanzas give a 
good idea of 
the rude original. 
Ah, drimindhu' dedish, my darling black cow, 
Say where are your folk, be they living or no ? 
They are down in the in-uund 'neath the sod, lying low, 
Expecting King James, with the crown on his brow. 
But if I 
could get sight of the crown on his brow, 
By night and day travelling to London I'd to, 
Over mountains of mist and black messes below, 
Till I'd beat on the kettle-drum _

a`HE MAC S AND THE OS. 
When Ireland was founded by the Macs and the O's, 
I 
never could learn, for nobody knows; 
But history says they came over from Spain, 
To visit old Granna, and there to remain; 
Our fathers were heroes for wisdom and fame ; 
For multiplication they practiced the same; 
St Patrick came over to heal their complaints, 
And very soon made them an island of saints. 
The harp and the shamrock were carried before 
Brave Roderick O'Connor and Roger ()Moore, 
And the good and bad deeds of the Macs and the O's, 
And this is the tale that these verses disclose. 
Hugh Neil of Tyrone, O'Donnel, O'Moore, 
O'Brien, O'Kelly, O'Connell galore, 
All houses so royal, so loyal and old, 
One drop of their blood was worth ounces of gold.

THE BLIND PIPER OF BLARNEY. 
By S. SIDNEY. 
Ala :—" TCate Kearney." 
Have you been to the sweet groves of Blarney ? 
And heard of the Blind Piper Barney ; 
Who since he was born, 
e'er beheld the bright morn, 
Nor the bright charming scenes around Blarney 
He looked the picture of gladness, 
Ne'er a 
trace in his features of sadness; 
For mans 's 
the while, 
A 
sweet merry smile, 
Would escape front the lips of blind Barney. 
Ne'er a 
wake or a 
wedding in Blarney, 
But was graced with the presence of Barney, 
While jigging away. 
Would merrily play, 
On the pipes so nimble would Barney. 
Should you visit the sweet groves of Blarney, 
And ask for the blind piper Barney 
They answer och 
Show you the stone, 
'Neath which lies the blind piper Barney.

IT'S LITTLE FOR GLORY I CARE. 
By 
CHARLES LEVER, Esq. 
Ant—" The Grinder." 
It's little for glory I 
care ; 
Sure ambition is only a 
fable; 
I'd as soon be myself as Lord Mayor, 
With lashins of drink on the table. 
I 
like to lie down in the sun 
And drama when my faytures is scorchin, 
That when I'm too old for more fun, 
Why, I'll marry a 
wife with a 
fortne. 
And in win'er with bacon and eggs, 
And a 
place at the turf tire basking, 
Sip my pin!eli as I 
roasted my legs, 
Oh I 
the divil a 
more I'd be asking. 
For I 
haven't, a 
janius for work, 
It was never the gift of the Bradlee, 
But I'd make a 
most illig;ant Turk, 
For I'm fond of tobacco and ladies. 
POTTEEN, GOOD LUCK TO YE, DEAR . 
Ay T 
was monarch in state, 
Like Romulus or Julius Caysar, 
With the best of fine victuals to eat, 
And drink like great Nebuuhadnezzar, 
A 
rasher of bacon I'd have, 
And potatoes the finest was seen, sir ; 
And for drink, it's no claret I'd crave, 
But a 
keg of old Mullen's potteen, sir, 
With the smell of the smoke on it still. 
They talk of the Romans of ould, 
Whom they say in their own times was frisky 
But trust me to keep out the cowld, 
The _
Romans at home here like whisky, 
Sure, it warms both the bead and the heart, 
It's the soul of all rendin' and writin'; 
It teaches both science and art, 
And disposes for love or for fight in.' 
Oh, potteen, good luck to ye, dear. 
THE IRISH BEAUTY. 
Perhaps you don't know there's a 
sweet little stream. 
Far down in a 
dell where a 
poet might dream, 
A nate little cabin stands close to the tide, 
And °eh such a 
jewel is standing inside. 
I 
don't mean a 
jewel that money can buy, 
But a 
warm hearted creature with love in her eve; 
You'll not find a 
beauty so beauteous as she, 
From Ballinacrasy to Donaghadee. 
Her name is O'Brien, they christened her Kate, 
There's many a 
beauty has shared the same fate, 
But never a 
one, to my thinking I've seen, 
So lovely, so trim, as my bright eyed Colleen. 
Her face is a 
picture for limners to paint, 
her figure might serve for some heart-winnin,-, saint,

you'll not find a

From Ballinacrasy to DonIghadee. 
Her hair it is smooth as the raven's own hack. 
But the bonniest bird has not tresses so black. 
And they curl round a 
neck that might rival time snow, 
With t 
h grace of the swan on the waters below. 
Her mouth : 0, what music I've heard from that same,
