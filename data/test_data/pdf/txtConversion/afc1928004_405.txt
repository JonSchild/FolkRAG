ClIORCS. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up to' ards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to' ard's the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
-When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Just at time nick of time. 
When we reach the dividing line, 
We will hear that bugle sounding in the morning. 
We'll see sinners on that day, 
Flop their wings and fly away, 
‘When they hear that bugle sounding in the morning. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up to'ards the sky, 
,c hen they hear the bugle sounding in time morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to ards the sky. 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Written by NED Goss, and sung by Goss and Fox. 
Dreaming of the old plantation last night, 
Oh, my, get back, 
I 
did see such a 
funny sight, 
You would laugh until you was dead, 
The darkies they did gather round, 
Oh, my, get back, 
To listen to the fiddle and banjo sound, 
And this am what they said. 
CHORUS. 
Shoo-fly, quit tickling me, 
Aunt Susie how de do, 
You go way and let me be, 
Flewy-am-a-flew. 
Way down in Georgia, 
Where the sugar cane does grow, 
Jonah was eat up by de whale, 
There's music in this shoe. 
Old uncle Pete, how he did sing, 
Oh, my, get back, 
Then he did dance a 
Highland fling, 
'While standing on his head, 
He had no shoes upon his feet, 
Oh, my, get back, 
The darkies all did sing so sweet, 
And this am what they said.

DON'T you hear the Juzzing 
Of the busy, buzzing bee, 
Around your head a 
singing 
Their favorite melody ? 
If ever they should happen 
To light upon your nose, 
I, golly, how you'd squirm, 
And jump out of your clothes. 
They're coming right this way, 
I 
see them on the wing, 
For one I'm going to lay, 
I 
hear their voices ring. 
Honey bee, busy bee, 
On every blooming flower, 
Making honey all the day, 
In their own little bower. 
Don't you see over there, 
That great big bumble bee, 
Gracious, how he's staring me, 
Go ' way, bumble bee I 
I 
g0 out in the morning, 
The first thing I 
do see, 
In a 
dandelion a-snoring, 
A 
great big bumble bee. 
I

And have such jolly fun, 
I 
often get them very mad, 
Then after me they run. 
They're coming, dr,a

YOUR attention I 
ask for awhile, 
To a 
song I'm poing, to sing you, 
Its about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking: 
And she threw such a 
glance at me. 
She was pretty and sweet as a

Such clothes you never did see 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower garden .on it, 
had the yaller gal that winked at me.

Oh. my ! she looked so sweet and dressed so neat, 
With her tilting hoops and pretty little feet. 
As she went skipping- along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me. 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
nutter 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her her mune, 
And she said it was Lucinda. 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and or life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. 
So I'd dress up, and I'd walk-by her house, 
Every afternoon about three, 
And l'd glance up at the window for to see my 1
1
.tuir Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh, you should have seen her on her wedding day, 
She was handsome as a 
Venus, 
NVIwai the parson made us one, au then the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So I've bought a 
little place out of town, 
If you go by, step in and see, 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life. 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me.

sat me down beside a 
stream, 
Children hear in

I 
somehow seemed to sleep and dream, 
That dream I'll tell to you. 
Cnoucs. 
Sing low, sweet children, 
The angels soon will come, 
Sing low sweet children— 
They're coining to take me home, 
This an angel said to me, 
We're coming to t..ke you home, 
Where all are happy, all are free--
Coming to take you home. 
A golden chariot then came down, 
Children mark dis tale. 
And dere was angels white and brown, 
Sinners mark dis tale. 
Sing low, ,Ve. 
Angels twined about my hair, 
Flowers wet with dew, 
A wreath of roses fresh and fair, 
Sweet children hear me thro'. 
Soon they robed me all in white, 
Oh ! the blessed lamb. 
They set me in the chariot bright, 
Beside the blessed lamb. 
Sing low, & c. 
Then I 
woke up from my dream, 
Den I 
hove a 
sigh. 
There I 
was beside the stream, 
And tears was in my eye. 
I 
took it for a

SASSY NIGGER SAM! 
Piantation Song and Dance written and performed only by the origi-
nal and only one- legged Song and Dance Men in the 
World, HARPER & STANS1LL. 
OH my name is Sassy Sam, 
Pse a 
dark- eyed contraband, 
Wily down on the Chickahominy I 
was born. 
Oh my massa run away, 
When de Union soldiers play, 
So I 
started for the Non f 
in de morn. 
I 
soon met wid a 
man 
What kotched me by the hand, 
And he led me to an Abolition meeting, 
Where de brudders dey did speech, 
And de sisters dey did preach, 
And dey said that my 'plexion it was light. 
And to the world dey'd teach 
What a 
point dat dey could reach, 
And show dat dey could wash a 
nigger white. 
[Dance. 
Oh den dey kotched me soon, 
And dey put ine in a 
room, 
Oh, dis nigger didn't know what dey was arter. 
Den (ley stripped off all my close, 
And now, what do you 'spose? 
They slapped me in a 
tub of scalditig water. 
And den dey got around, 
Some scrubbing brushes found, 
Sed dey'd wash me whiter dan any paper. 
Den some began to scrub, 
While de oders dey did rub, 
And dey kep it up all dat night. 
mit you may rub and you may scrub, 
You may wash and you may wipe, 
But a 
nigger will be a 
nigger; and dam if you 
can wash him white.

SALLY, BLESS MY SOUL!

WAYNE & LOVELY. 
T 
should like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
ask'd my Cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet ! 
CHORE'S. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief. 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, & c. 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
-vow, 
And dress up in the style! 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile ! 
She blushed, &c.

BLACK AND TANNED. 
Written by . 1. F. 
expressly for 1311.1.r 1VEsT. 
Oh I 
am an unhappy moke, 
A more wretched one never was seen. 
T'll tell you the cause, 
And you'll ,say what a 
victim T've been. 
For I 
loved a 
fair maid. 
As black as the ace of spades: 
She was chief engineer of a 
kitchen near here, 
And boss of the seullery maids. 
Cnonus. 
Oh my, what a 
shame, another galoot came about, 
lie was a 
black millionare, and quickly he cut me out, 
My eye what a 
shame, if I 
only could catch that .-raloot. 
I'd send him a 
challenge ts meet me to night, 
And I'd bat him right in the snoot, 
1Ier name you must know 
Was Georgia Juliet Fan ; 
His name I've been told 
Was Alonzo Othello M'Cann. 
He was it native of Greece. 
A man in the soap fat line 
And only she fell in love with his can, 
That kitchen maid might have been mine. 
Oh my. & e. 
One night to the kitchen I 
went, 
And then what a 
sight did I 
see; 
The soap fat man was there with his can, 
And she sitting .right on I 
us knee 
"fri • 
in a 
rage I 
rushed at them both ; 
Him to the ground I 
did fling ; 
And there in the kitchen I 
knocked out his orainsl 
With a 
stone from my Diamond ring 
Oh my, itc.1 
She for a 
policeman did call. 
And quickly they rushed to the stoop ; 
They found the girl was smothered right there 
With her head in a 
pot of clam soup 
They dragged me off to the court. 
And there not a 
word could I 
speak , 
They tried me for stealing the soap fat can, 
And hung me in less than a 
week. 
(_11ortus. 
Oh my, wha a 
sname, another galoot came about, 
He was a 
black millionaire and quickly he cut me out; 
My eye, what a 
shame, that yaller gal miglit have been mine,. 
And we'd all be alive if it wasn't for him, 
That man in the soap fat line.

GALLUS NIGS, 
Written and sung by BARLow'mints. 
On ! here we are two Gallus Nigs, 
As ever you did see ; 
We belong upon the Mississippi, 
Away down in Tennessee. 
Oh! we can dance, and we 
sing, 
And twist our heel and toe ; 
So watch us closely while we dance, 
And something new we'll show. 
My brother here, his name is Bill, 
And his name it -is lot Jim. 
They say we are so much alike 
That you can't tell me from hini 
But I 
can see, the difference, 
As we walk along the street, 
For all the folks, as we pass by, 
Say he's got the biggest feet. 
So now we've been here long enough, 
And off I 
guess we'll dance. 
For he has got to see his Lize, 
And him his black-eyed Nance; 
But the next time that we come aloug. 
To please you we will try, 
So farewell to you one and all, 
We'll bid you all good-bye.

Behold in me a

Of color, air, and style, 
With my regimental garments on, 
I 
am sure to win your smile ; 
The base-drum is my forte, you see; 
I

Flat Colored Band. 
That B 
Flat Colored Band; 
We can play more tunes 
For four weak coons, 
Than any in the laud. 
One day we played out in the street, 
The President was in town ; 
My girl stood on the balcony, 
As we came marching down; 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
And then I 
almost choked; 
I 
hit the drum, made one home run 
Down the bassoon player's throat

COLORED SWELLS. 
Words by Amos D. ARNOLD, Music by E. 
A . 
ANDRE, 
and sung with immense success by the celebrated ARNOLD linoTnEns. 
at 585 Broadway N. Y. 
OH! we are the stylish swells of creation, 
All others in the shade we leave, 
Our winning ways they cause a 
great sensation, 
Especially when we promenade at eve, 
The ladies sigh and say, oh 
my, 
They look so very neat, 
They are really captivating, 
When they promenade the street. 
Oh, the ladies fair they say we look so neat, 
Break. 
While envious gents say our form is so c-Implete, 
Oh, we are the stylish swells of creation, 
And our winning ways they fascinate the belles, 
Gentle sighs are often heard as we pass by them, 
By famous, the only colored swelLs. 
When strolling out at eve, we're called perfection, 
By those lovely girls who chance to pass us by, 
In it they seem to take great satisfaction, 
I 
suppose it's 'cause we are timid, young and shy; 
We always smile, yes, all the while, 
For our souls they agitate, 
Those handsome, stylish, lovely girls, 
All hearts they captivate.

As sung by DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
yes, they ask me why I 
always seem so happy, 
And they criticize my gay and airy style, 
But they know not how I 
love a 
little beauty ; 
I'm swimming in the sweetness of her smile, 
Little angels seem to hover all around me, 
While the birds direct to me their joyous lay, 
And the fish within the streamlet play to please me, 
Since I 
met this little flower, Lilly May. 
More lovely than the blooming rose, 
The dew drop pearl within ; 
And constant as the stream that 
A 
precious prize to win. 
ThertN'a band of angels singing in lur laughter, 
An1 a 
cupid merry making in her eye; 
With a 
shyness like the pearl I: named her after, 
Recollection of her beauty brings a 
sigh ; 
;ut she said she always wished to see me happy, 
Would help to ease my days of care and strife, 
And a 
sweeter, dearer vow she lately made me, 
'Twas her willingness to share my future life.

As sung by the LA

Down a

In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell the village Belle— 
The idol of my lay; 
And when evening casts its shades, 
0! what a 
happy Southern sod, 
We wandered forth in hand and hand, 
To pick the cotton pods. 
Down a

The idyl of my lay.

Beaming in starlight! 
Emblem, sweet Nellie, of my love for you. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I 
first gave you the heart that was true 
Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same ; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again.

American Fortune- Telling Cards.—This is tne old-

These Cards are arr.nged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dis-
almonds and Spades—and each ( Jr these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
Sad E for Knave, and numbers I, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many or the an-
ewers depend upon the position certaiu cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that Very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

ever written, provimf •• truth strung. r than fiction." The poet's lines

Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah ! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, 
affords a 
striking exempt* 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

The N. Y. Evening Mail writer--

"A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Farris's, 98 Nas-
sau street ceded the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
It to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
Oncourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when ciewf 
'Mere to do it," and this little volume wculd advise and initiate the 
corrupted un
in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We haee lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing Owenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modue operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
