Resilience 
 
My mother, in 7th grade, ran from a South Dakota boarding school back home to White Earth in 
an age before Interstate highways, cell phones or google maps. That determination and love of 
life is resilience. 
A Native father sitting in Perkins, after working a late shift, with a two-year-old toddler in a 
high-chair. explains that the baby’s mother showed up at his door with a child he didn’t know 
existed and said, “Here, I’ve done this for two years, I’m done. He’s yours.” He didn’t hesitate to 
do the right thing. That is resilience. 
The woman who lost her child to child protection because she was caught in the cycle of 
addiction and street life. Sent to prison. Who spent five years getting clean, going to meetings, 
petitioning the court against all odds to regain custody of her child. That is resilience. 
The poet, who grew up with a not-so-easy life in Oklahoma. Resilience gave her words to write, 
now US poet laureate.  Resilience also gave her music in her heart that pours out of her 
saxophone, healing hearts of listeners. 
A Native Artist living on the street collected discarded lipstick and eyeshadow to create gallery-
worthy paintings. Creating beauty out of beauty-discards. That is resilience. 
My father, along with thousands of other fathers, for more generations than we want to 
remember, sat alone, not changing residence, waiting, waiting, waiting for children to return. 
That is resilience. 
Men who went to prison – who somehow came out and started businesses, who raised families 
and took jobs way below their skill level; who became sweat lodge runners, sun dancers and 
pipe carriers. That is resilience. 
The children, raised in families outside the culture, who followed their heart’s spirit back home 
– facing rejection, ridicule, identity-questioning – but staying, becoming one with the 
community, one with their tribe. That is resilience. 
Mothers - who, with or without shame, have stood in line at Salvation Army for cheap toy 
giveaways, food shelf lines, who sit in welfare offices again and again because it is one way to 
keep the family going. That is resilience. 
 
Our relatives who never hesitate to go to war, wars that are never ours. Code talkers, tunnel 
rats, snipers, those who walk point, medics. They die fighting because that is what we do. Or 
they come home and hide the pain as best they can and carry flags at Grand Entry. Or not. That 
is resilience. 
People who give more than they get. Mothers who love their children, fathers who stay. 
Grandparents who babysit, even in a wheelchair. 
We create beauty out of scraps. Hold cars together with duct tape. Work jobs and sell 
beadwork for cash to ‘have a little extra’. Make frybread even though we know it isn’t good for 
the diabetes but because it’s good for the spirit. 
Resilience is making decisions that benefit the whole instead of just the individual. It is getting 
up and putting one foot in front of the other, even when you don’t want to. This is our 
resilience.
