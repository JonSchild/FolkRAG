THE STARS OF GERMAN COMEDY. 
Wonderful 
Winnetts 
THE WORLD'S 
A. FEW OF THE 
MANY FLATTERING TESTIMONIALS. 
THE WINNETTS gave their German character scene 
entitled " Down by dot School House," and imitations of 
drum-playing with their wooden shoes. 
They are good 
vocalists and excellent dancers, and were received with 
great favor.—New York Clififier. 
THE WINNETTS received a 
warm welcome, and ren-
dered their sketch, " Love in Broken German," in an 
artistic manner. 
Judging from the impression they have 
made upon their audience, we predict that during their 
stay they will be the favorite.—Chicao Times. 
4 
TESTIMONIALS.—CONCLUDED. 
THE WINNETTS we can not spo,ak of without laughing 
to ourselves. 
That " Found at Last," was certainly a 
good antidote for the blues. 
It was " sphlendid." 
Long 
life to 
Christina and Heinrich," and we venture to say 
their amusing little German Comedy will long be remem-
bered— Cincinnati Gazette. 
THE W INNETTS appeared at the Howard Athena;um, 
in their Original German Character impersonations, in 
which they have no superiors. 
As might be supposed, 
they made a 
decided hit.—Boston Herald. 
THE WINNETTS gave an unusually clever Teutonic 
act at the Grand Central Theatre last week and made an 
unmistakeable hit.—Philadelfihia Item. 
THE WINNETTS, —
The Teutonic Troubadors appeared 
at the Holiday St. Theater last evening, in their musical 
sketch, and provoked uproarious enthusiasm, and were 
as they deserved, well received.—Baltimore Telegram. 
THE WINNETTS, in their artistic jig, were fine, and 
took well. 
They also appeared to excellent advantage in 
several sketches. 
Both are artists of great ability, and 
very popular with the audience,—,St. Louis .Press,

We're two merry little folks, 
Your favors please me granting, 
If you will but look at us, 
You need not study banting. 
We can sing a 
comic song, 
Some may think enchanting; 
Singing may be very well, 
But we prefer the dancing. 
CHORUS. 
Dance, dance, and go ahead 
Always keep advancing 
(Symphony.) 
(Symphony.) 
If you will but look at us, 
We'll try a 
little dancing. 
Dance Irish Jig, short and lively. 
TRY A LITTLE DANCING—CONCLUDED. 
To the theatre we went one night, 
We heard Brignoli singing, 
The applaudits of the house just then, 
Why, set the place a 
ringing. 
At last the ballet girls came on, 
Around the stage kept prancing; 
The singing it was very good, 
But we preferred the (lancing. 
Chorus. 
As before, at end of chorus, dance Irish Reel, short and quick. 
Some like this and some like that, 
Some like wine and brandy, 
Some like all the pretty girls, 
As sweet as 'lasses candy. 
SHE. 
I 
admire all the boys, 
When at me they are glancing. 
ROTH. 
We can love them all day long, 
And teach them fancy dancing. 
Chorus. 
As before, at end of Chorus, dance Double Jig, and finish.

WICKEDEST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
As sung only by " Winnett," in the Principal Theatres of 
America, with tumultuous applause. 
The most delicious moment, 
That ever I 
have seen, 
Was while I 
sat a 
chatting 
To my Clementina Deen, 
She had such curly, coal black hair, 
And teeth as white as snow, 
And drove a 
pair of milk white steeds, 
When to a 
ball she'd go. 
ClloRus. 
Her lips of rose, none could oppose, 
So saucily they'd pout, 
With a 
flashing eye, 
She'd make you sigh, 
She's the wickedest girl that's out. 
While soundly she was sleeping, 
Nestled closely by my side, 
I 
kissed her twenty times or more, 
It cannot be denied, 
She awoke up very suddenly, 
And broke into a 
laugh, 
And says young man, 
I 
do declare, your acting like a 
calf. 
I 
took her out a 
riding, 
'Twas Sunday afternoon, 
We walked and talked and chatted, 
Till we saw the silvery moon, 
I 
whispered to her gently, 
You're the girl that I 
adore, 
And found her soundly sleeping, 
For she gave an awful snore. 
Chorus. 
Chorus. 
11 
ASSIST THOSE IN NEED. 
As sung with immense success by Miss Lottie Winnett, and 
Miss Pauline Batcheler, the world known vocal queens. 
To help one along I 
do all I 
can, 
And all should assist with their mights, 
To say a 
kind word or do a 
good deed 
Is one of my greatest delights. 
If a 
man who is poor approaches my door, 
I 
don't turn on him with a 
frown, 
But I 
give him my might, for surely ' tis right, 
If we're up to assist those who're down. 
CHORUS— 
And thus I 
go on, 
With the world's busy throng, 
I 
avoid all contention and strife, 
But I 
do all I 
can 
To aid each poor man, 
Mounting upward the ladder of life, 
Every day in this town of wealth and re-nown, 
We can see hundreds hungry for bread, 
And perhaps if 'twere known there are others at 
home, 
Depending on them to be fed, 
Oh! that Mammon would turn from his pleasure 
to learn, 
Of their suffering and aid their distress, 
How many would pray for his weal night and day, 
And the giver would always be blessed. 
Chorus.

Wouldn't You Like to Know. 
By Thomas H. Winnett, and sung by Win. II. Batcheler, 
the Champion Leaper of the World. 
Don t 
talk to me of beauties, 
Or about your bells at balls, 
I've got a 
pretty little dear, 
Much gayer than them all, 
You can see a 
host of pretty little dears, 
As through the streets you go, 
But where I 
met this little dear, 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know. 
ClIORIIS-
For she's handsome and she's neat, 
And she always looks so sweet, 
But as she skipped a 
past me, 
She was singing sweet and low, 
I 
inquired her name, but what it is. 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know. 
She's got a 
pretty little foot, 
She wears a 
gaiter shoe, 
Her slender waist is very small, 
Her eyes a 
purple blue, 
Her hand is like the lilly fair, 
When it is in her blew, 
But who she's going to give it to. 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know. 
Chorus.

Original by the great Celtic duo, Ward and Wells. 
We are a 
happy Irish pair, we came from Barrymore, 
You can see we wear the real old Irish style, 
And both our hearts beat wild with joy, 
When we landed on the shore. 
All the Colleens fair did greet us with a 
smile. 
For we are the boys can sing and dance, 
And keep it up all day. 
It's a 
pleasure that we dearly do adore, 
And all the boys at us do glance, 
Because we're light and gay, 
We're the happy Irish pair from Barrymore. 
CHORUS— 
For in Ireland where the shamrock grows 
In that dear little Green Isle, 
The land that we'll be true to evermore,

We're the happy Irish pair from I3arrymore. 
Dance four strains Lancashire dancing, 
Now while for you we're dancing, 
Just you watch us if you please. 
And we'll show you steps you never saw before, 
For we brought them right from Ireland, 
Over it's circling spray cap seas, 
Over to your homsteads and your door. 
But our hearts will never be easy, 
Nor rest quiet in our breast, 
If your approbation and applause we lose, 
So now kind friends to you we'll show, 
If you watch us for a 
while, 
We're the happy Irish pair from Barrymore.

GENTEEL IRISH TEAM. 
Written hy Thos. II. Winnett, expressly for Ward & Wells, 
the artistic representatives of the refined Irish gentleman 
and the world's greatest dancers. 
Please give us your attention, 
And from us you will learn, 
That we are from dear Ireland, 
And that you can discern, 
We kissed our Colleens " good bye," 
We ne'er forget the day, 
They cried when we departed, 
For the land of America. 
CHORUS— 
To you we'll tell, none can exdel, 
Our dancing is supreme, 
"Tis their desire us to admire, 
The genteel Irish Team. 
When we were in Kilkenny, 
The genteel Irish Team, 
To th.,. music of the pipes, 
We danced upon the green, 
The old and young and every one, 
Would join in lively song, 
To " Whiskey you're the devil,"-
Or the Little Cruskeen Lawn. 
Irish Duett and Dance. 
Sung by THOMAS AND LorrA 
W INNETT, at the principle Vaudeville 
Theatres of America. 
We're a 
happy Irish pair you see, 
And we lately came from dear old Tipperary; 
Where the Irish boys are happy as can be, 
And the Coleens fair you'll never find contrary; 
We can sing and dance the whole day long, 
Our hearts are ever gay; 
And when you see our movements, 
I 
am sure you all will say, 
That no other style that's in the land, 
Outrivals that of Mike and Kate O'Leary; 
We've lately come across the sea, 
From that dear old spot they call it Tipperary. 
[Dance, regular Irish Breakdown.] 
When we landed upon Columbia's shores, 
Among the boys we caused a 
great sensation; 
For as we said to you before, 
We're the happiest Irish that's in the nation ; 
Whether here or there, it's all the same, 
No matter where we go, 
Our movements seems to please you, 
When we twist our heel anct too; 
We ask of you your kind applause, 
'Twill help to make our hearts feel light and airy, 
.._And we'll finish with a 
little dance, 
Chorus. - 
And show you how it's done in Tipperary.

Englishman, 8cotelaman, and. Irishman. 
As sung by THOMAS W INNETP. 
An Englishman, Sootc:nnan and ; r.shman were sentenced to dcatm 
for stealing sheep, and Ii. Honor the Judge informed them he would 
be very lenient with them, and give them their choice of dying, that is 
they could die according to their own nationality. 
So the first to 
take the floor was the ENGLISHMAN, who sang as follows: 
Let me die on the oak, 
The brave old oak, 
That stands in the greenwood lawn, 
Let me die on the oak, 
The dear old oak. 
With its hundred of arms so strong, 
The next was the ScoTcumeff who sang as follows; 
The moon's on the lake, 
And the mist on the gen,-
And the glen that was known 
That is nameless by day, 
If their robbers by night, 
And pursue us with beagles, 
Give the flood to the rocks, 
And the flesh to the sea-gulls. 
Then hollo ! hollo 
hollo! 
Then hollo 
hollo hollol 
While there's rope in old Scotland, 
And a 
tree by the river, 
It's there let me die Judge, 
And hang there forever. 
Third and last was the IRISHMAN, who sang as follows: 
There's the Englishman and Scotchman 
As you plainly see, 
Have their own way of dying 
And that you'll agree, 
But I 
would be hum ,- to a 
gooseberry tree, 
Before the daylight in the morning. 
But a 
goosebery tree says the judge is too low 
To hang a 
man on it and that you all 
know, 
Then Pat gave a 
wink to the Jury below, 
Saying, I'm in no hurry, 
'WU", I'll wait till she ;. rows. 
(And the tree never grew.)

beauty, 
Who in Irish town doer: dwell, 
With her father and mother 
In a boarding-house hotel. 
There is a 
villain wanted to marry her, 
Before he ever knew her; 
She' left her home and run away, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
This girl she left her home, 
Likewise her native place , 
One day while walking through the park, 
Sh, met the villain face to face. 
Ht. grasped her by the lily white hand, 
And he popped the question to her, 
She seized the tongs and wrenched his breath, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
She travelled on for miles, at last she drew a 
pop, 
And shot him four times through the heart ; 
And still he would not stop, she drew a 
sword 
And cut him right and left when he came to tier, 
She killed him dead ...nd away she went, 
And the villain still pursued her.

Air; " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Oh, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
I 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget ; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there.

Some Deem it but a 
Little Thing. 
Published by permission of Gao. M OLINEUX, Brooklyn. 
Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To trifle with another's love ; 
To gain the heart's best offering, 
And then to other objects rove. 
But it has caus'd full many a 
smart, 
Which years alone can e'er allay, 
And broken many a 
faithful heart 
Which might have thrill'd with love to-
day. 
CHORUS. 
Take heed how ye in future deal, 
Nor rudely strike affection's string, 
For wounds which time can never heal 
Have sprung from such like little things. 
Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To pass their humble brother by; 
Nor deign to yield the joys that spring 
From outstretch'd hand and friendly eye. 
But it has caus'd, this little deed, 
Full many a 
scalding tear to roll, 
And many an aching heart to bleed, 
And untold anguish of the soul. 
Take heed, &c. 
Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To sever Friendship's sacred chord, 
And rudely snap the ties that cling 
Around the heart, by some false word. 
But it has caus'd a 
world of strife, 
Where love and peace were wont to reign, 
And many a 
year of after life 
Made doubly desolate by pain. 
Take heed, Sce.

Solomon Isaac Musketeers. 
Written by DAVE Howiom, and sung nightly with immense applause by 
HOWARD and THOMPSON. 
Just look at us Hebrew soldiers now,. 
And you will plainly see 
We only joined a 
regiment 
About two weeks or three. 
We march in style and the ladies all smile, 
And call us their little dears, 
When we get out upon parade 
'With the Isaac Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
You should see us on Broadway when we do march so gay, 
The people shout and holler out we are queers; 
But we don't care for that, for we are getting fat 
Since we joined the Solomon Isaac Musketeers. 
Now when the fighting time does come, 
We'll show what we can do; 
We'll destroy a 
thousand matzes 
In less than an hour or two. 
We'll put them down without a 
frown, 
And then we won't look queer; 
'Tis the only thing to stimulate 
The Isaac- Musketeers. 
You should see us, &c.

As sung by HEN GRAHAM with great success at the Theatre Ootnique, 
Brooklyn. 
My name is Solomon Levy, 
I'm a

To please you if I

I

Way down in Ludlow street, 
It's all among the Hebrew men, 
They say I

Written by H. BENNETT, and respectfully dedicated to AL. W . 
FILSON, 
and sung by him with unbounded success. 
0, I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
Whenever there's a 
boxing match I 
ante up my tin. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
like to make a 
bet, 
stand a 
chance of losing, but I 
never done it yet. 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestle and it ended in a 
fight, 
A Scotchman, a 
Dutchman, a 
Turk and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Riley got slugged with a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobody knows what a 
racket there was there, 
Nobody knows now, I 
tell you, I 
declare. ( Repeat chorus.) 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
could never keep it mum, 
Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he stuck out his hand, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
He caught a 
hold of McIntire, and threw him on the floor; 
He went for little Brady, and he hit him such a 
crack 
That he knocked his Sunday shirt clean off of his back. 
Then nobody knows, &c.

The Raffle for the Stove 
Written, composed and sung with great success by J. E.

consecutive nights.

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
raflle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy .T. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Ifogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen SO 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raflling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bottie, 
Sure lie all the windows broke ; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
(Chorus.)

Music published and copyrighLed by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 B'way, N. X' 
If you please, some time since I 
married 
A 
young and most beautiful girl. 
But now 1 so wish I 
ha:- tarried, 
For my brain's in a 
terrible whirl. 
Her mother, alas, is my torment, 
She worries mc out oc r.-.y life, 
My feelings are all in a 
ferment. 
From the trouble I've had with my wife. 
CHORUS. 
But I'll stand interference no more, 
To me she's a 
terrible sore ; 
So now, on my life, 
boss my own wife, 
And get rid of my mother-in-law. 
I 
ne'er shall forget our first baby, 
A 
bouncing blue-eyed little boy, 
The actions then cc thc oid lady 
Brought me torment instead of great joy. 
The neighbors all said he's a 
darling, 
The image of his pap-pap-pa: 
The old woman she argued contrary, 
And swore he looked like his mamma. 
But I'll stand, St.c.

LOUISA PROM GERMANY. 
Sung by EMMA ROGERS, in the sketch written for her by NED STRAIGTIT, 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest shanit:; 
Yet bring him back where.'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship sail'd from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have fleAt 
One letter only from him came, 
"I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same. 
Tho' the ocean rolls, 8x.

As sung by JENNIE M ORGAN. 
'Itrafic to be had of OLIVER DITSON & Co., Boston, Mass., Erie° 400th 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth ray tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day. 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring ,you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah I 
no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die thatday, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love ma, 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

I Am A Soldier Bold. 
Sung by JOHN WurrxEy with great success in the sketch entitled 
" 
Irish Patricts." 
I 
love the sword and bayonet, 
I 
like to hear them clash, 
There's music in the rifle 
And glory in the flash. 
When the thundering cannons rattle 
And the foe fades from our sight, 
Let victory crown the hero, 
And God defend the right. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
soldier, should you want me, 
You will find me in the ranks of glory. 
I'm a 
soldier, should you want me, 
You will find me in the ranks of glory. 
Let shot and shell by fury winged, 
Burst round me as they fly, 
And front to front with death at bay, 
I'd lift that standard high, 
And there defend it to the last 
'Till daylight through me shines, 
And man and flag by shot and shell 
Are scattered to the winds. 
(Choru8.) 
But should I 
fall in glorious war, 
Be decked with crimson wounds, 
Let muffled drums and trumpets sound 
To soothe my dying moans. 
And o'er my grave discharge your shot 
With steady hand at arch, 
And funeral notes from trumpets sound 
The soldier's last sad march.

ili.merican Fortune-Telling Cards.- This is theOld-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series-Hearts; Clubs, Dia-

The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-

Courting Cards.- This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by •ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentoue 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as thei r ow n, unless 
it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties 
Price 25 Cents.
