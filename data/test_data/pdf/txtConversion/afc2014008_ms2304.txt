Dear Guy and Candie:
 
What a perfectly gorgeous book.  I am absolutely
 
delighted for you and I hope it will sell a million; I
'm ordering it
 
immediately for my next fall folklore classes.  I hope you feel enor-
mously proud of yourselves, for you have every right to.  Ted Carpen-
ter got a copy, by the way, and is reading it; he not only loves the
 
pictures but remarked on the "ear" you have for speech.  It;e really
 
a knock-out, and I don't have a single criticism.
 
Speaking of criticisms, I never really got a chance
 
to talk over my book with you, and I wish, if you have time, you'd
 
write me 2what you think.  I hive it sold finally and am now in the
 
position of reworking it to fit Doubleday's needs so any advice I can
 
get would be most useful right at the moment.  One of the main things
 
I want to find out from you is whether the general tone is right.  I am
 
concerned that it not sound highfaluting -
-
 too elaborate for the sub
.
'.
 
j.ct matter, I guess is what I mean; Bessie never does, of course, but
 
I have a tendency to be over-elaborate.  You've avoided this beautifull
 
in your own book, of course.  The other thing I want to be sure about
 
is the business about "
Pizza Pizza Mighty Moe"; did I write it up cor-
rectly?  What should I do, if anything, about copyright?  (Bessie's
 
stuff is all copyrighted by Al Brackman under her standard arrangement
 
with Alan,)
 
Are you coming to Pitzer College?  I wrote a little
 
thing for them about you, but haven't heard anything further.  It
 
would be nice if you were around out here for a while.  Much love from
 
us all, and again, our warmest congratulations for a beautiful job.

Dear Miss Hawes,
 
Here, just off press, is a book I felt I had to
 
s
end you because I think you'll love and admire it the
 
way everybody here does •
 I
t's Guy and Candle Carawan'
 s
 
and Robert Yellin '
s book about the people of Johns
 
Island, South Carolina, an isolated rural c
ommunity that
 
is maintaining its folk traditions even as it is slowly
 
freeing itself from the burdens of the past.  Actually,
 
it i
s by the people of Johns Island themselves.
 
AIM I
T YOU GOT A R
IGHT TO T
HE TREE OF LIFE? is a
 
book we think will affect people interested in politics,
 
music, photography, language, anthropology, folklore,
 
c
ivil rights -
 all people interested in the "family of
 
man."  We very much hope you'll f
eel strongly about it
 
too; if you do, please let us know.
 
4ncerel; yours,

kind of book though I will fight to the death against having any of the
 
t
exts re-edited and I will also not allow it to be too cutie-pie in
 
framework.  My own role s
 i
ould be, I think, to present the active-type
 
readers of the book with as much contextual material as they can a

or will tolerate while hoping that scholars will recognize that the
 
data as reported is as accurate as I could get it.  Again, I think rr

have the supporting data to go further.  A little l

childhood pursue you to the grave?
 
NOW having got that OL

in decent privacy.  One of the things sort of trembling on n lips
 
all the way through the book was T
ry OWf
l feeling that the whole of Bessie' s
 
pattern -
 made most explicit in ring play
 is the older generational
 
way of demonstrating to the young how ghetto life c
an be patterned so a-
-
to be humanly supportable •
 I
've even wondered whether or not the ring
 
.
)l
ay is not the explicit projection of the protective role cf the i
atod
 
:
egro coriminitr, and whether or not the real problem of the Negro child
 
isn't to get out of that ring. Does that make s
ense in terms of your
 
observations?  This would certainly f
it the matriarchal pattern and the
 
f
act that though 3
easie s
aid ring plays were for everybody, I think
 
what she rea T
h
j- meant was that boys as well as girls ought to play the-
n
.
 
They're good for them, she kept sa
ying.  Nell, i still think there is
 
s
ome g
: od stuff ther though I also think x
ir perspective has been slanted
 
possib l
y in plart by 3ssie' s pile-driver personality; so I must e*art
 
ry own fishing expedition again.  And again thank you very much.

Dear Bess,
 
4e just aot your letter of i rch 27 this last week.
 
For some reason L
bimon & Schuster d
id  not forward it to us.
 
e are pleased that you and Ted Carpenter like the book.
 
I
've sirned a contract for a half-time teachAnu job at
 
Pitzer berinninr in February.
 I'll be teachinp, two courses
 
The first semester -
-
 American folk music and folk life studies;
 
and the second -
-
 The Ne ro revolt in the 1960s.
 I'm wondering
 
how I will do as a teacher.
 I hope yca won't
 ;
Iving me
 
a little advice when I ci t  out there.
 At the end of June we
 
are  oing to Eastern  entucky for six months.  We'll be in
 
F
iellier, an old mined :
-out town in Pike County.
 We will be
 
workina partly for the Appalachian Volunteers and partly for
 
Highlander,  tryinr to  r
et lots of community meetinrs goin g around
 
music.
 There are hppes for petting a "Poor Peoples'  i
i
overnent"
 
oin  in appalachia.
 
We are really happy to hear that you sold your manuscript
 
to Doub
ay.
 We loved the book when we read it and have been
 
te111np people about it.
 1 don't think it sounds "hip
'h-falutin' t'
.
 
There's a iood balance between 3essie and
 I still think it
 
would help to have photoara hs.
 f yo u  don t have any,  I sur est
 
you write to Bob Yellin (
115 Christie Street, Leonia, New Jersey.)
 
I don 't remember exactly what you said about "Pizza Pizza,
 
i
i hty i

 I
'm pretty sure the kids sanr it independently on
 
Johns Island.
 I haven't done anything about co ywritin  -
-
 just
 
told where I  o  them.
 I'm sorry I can't be of more help on this.
 
Thanks very much for writin  to Pitzer on my behalf..
 
Thnaks also for thinkin  
-
 our hook is "perfectly porceous" and
 
for orderinr  it for your class.
 It is goiq  into its second
 
printing,  for which we are  lad.
 We look forward to seeing
 
you and  3

Thanks for your good letter full of the best kind of grappling
 
observation,  Do not be disturbed personally by Elder.  He knew
 
better1 for those games, (
according to my informants) have never
 
been played much by children.  The only thing we can ask for
 
in books of this sort is honeaty,after all.  By your focusing
 
on Bessie as a teacher you will eliminate all possibility of
 
misunderstanding, which is what I objected to about Jacob's book.
 
I look forward to reading the paper you mention you are sending o
r
 
As you may have noticed, I a
nt program chairman for the AFS
 
meetings in Toronto.  The job has been wonderful and terrible.
 
Wonderful because papers proposed have been exciting and abundant.
 
Also because I have to admit that I really like the job of
 
correspondence.  Terrible because it takes so damn much time.
 
Why don't you come to one of our meetings one of these days.
 
Won't SFVSC pay your way if you read a paper?  I can still
 
make a place for you.  All love from Mary and myself,

Dear Sarah Gertrude Knott:
 
r
 
T
J
 
Thank you 80 much for your kind letter.  I should be delighted for
 
you to use some of the games from Step It Down in your forth-coming
 
Look; details, of course, would have to be worked out with Harper
 
and Rowe.  It's ironic -
 the first draft of Step It Down was also
 
135t; in my case the briefcase of an editor who was taking it home
 
for a week-end reading was stolen in Grand Central Station.  It is
 
surely a lot of trouble to get a book actually out, isn't it?
 
To answer a few of your questions: the reason I didn't use gullah
 
dialect is exceedingly straight-forward.  Mrs. Bessie Jones, my co-
author from whom all the games were collected, was not a gullah
 
speaker; (
she was born on the mainland and only moved to St Simon's
 
after her marriage).  As to the Anglo-Irish provenience of a number
 
of the games and plays, I thought I made that pretty clear in my
 
head-notes; lots of them
 not all, but lots -
 are clearly Afro-
American reworkings of games that came from the British Isles.  You
 
might want to consult the Annotations section in the back of the book
 
and notice how many refer back to Gomrne.
 
Am os I don't really know how your book is shaping up
. or what points
 
you want to make, I don't know really how to advise you on which games
 
to chooee,for reprint.  Perhaps Juba (which I suppose is as close to
 
African in rrigin as one can get)
rhape one of the Singing Plays,
 
most of them being pretty clearly Anglo-Irish; and then perhaps one
 
of the Ring Plays, as an example of a form I consider to be indigenous
 
to Afro-America?  Maybe that would be a starter anyway...
 
I do wish you well with your book and thank you again for your nice
 
letter.  Will I be seeing you perhaps at next November's meeting of
 
the American Folklore Society in Nashville?  I
'll lookeforward to the
 
possibility.
 
Jincerely,
 
Boss i

Dear B
ess,
 
RR #
1, Campbellville,
 
Ontario,
 
Canada.
 
Thank you so much f
or the copy of your book.  It looks
 
very beautiful, and the warmth of it really comes across.  You have
 
really achieved the impossible, making it both scholarly and human.
 
I am reviewing it for the International Journal of Sociology and
 
Anthropology, which is published at York University and has quite
 
a wide international circulation.
 
Harry will be back from his r
ound-the world trip
 
some time this week.  I shall not be leaving for a month or so.
 
Any chance of you being in this part of the world.
 
I
'll write a proper letter later.
 
Love,

it is really a joy to read a book in whic
 
learning and pleasure are so inextricably

emphasis upon performance and participation
 
surely make it impossible for the reader to

 I also appreciated
 
your reportage of the actual process of doing

and tribulations of trying to get the stuff down

D
ear Bess,
 
I enclose a c
opy of a r
eview of your book I wrote f
or the
 
International J
ournal of S
ociology and Anthropology, which i
s published
 
a
t Y
ork.  I h
ad t
o k
eep withing their  limites f
or length.  It may, like
 
t
he book, take f
orever t
o a
ppear, the j
ournal being a
s far behind as
 
m
ost, but I did my best.
 
I am s
o glad t
o  h
ear you will be spending a relatively
 
r
elaxed summer.  C
ount was here, only f
or a couple of days, unfortunately,
 
but i
t was g
ood t
o s
ee h
im and get news of you.  I would have loved t
o
 
be a
t the party to celebrate your book.  I had written t
o Count a
sking
 
h
im t
o phone from the party, but my letter arrived t
oo late.  I wish I
 
c
ould see you before I g
o.  I won't be leaving until August.  Harry
 
g
ot back only a few days a
go, so since I didn't get away in May I t
hought
 
I
 might as well spend t
he summer here, especially a
s it is the rain y
 
s
eason i
n Africa, and especially a
s as a great crop of strawberries i
s
 
j
ust getting r
ipe.  And i
t will be lovely t
o miss one Canadian winter
.
 
Please, if you are in T
oronto f
or the Anthropology meetings in
 
N
ovember, phone Harry -
 k16_85L_2k14 , a long d
istance call from T
oronto,

m:  
Games, Plays, Songs, and Stories from the Afro-American Heritage, which
 
you did in collaboration with Bessie Jones.  I an pleased to note that the
 
book also contains her autograph.  This means a lot to me because I did meet
 
her on occasion of one of the first festivals whJ
lch D. K. put on he -i
;
e at "
I
'
T
CLA.
 
As a matter of fact I chatted with her briefly.
 
I have not had time to do more than cast th-ough this book, but it
 
looks to me to be a major statement, and I plan to work through it .
"
o.- some
 
o
�
L the traditions which I know.
 
After doing so, and ruminating on the whole thing, I shall present
 
it on your behalf, and that of Bessie Jones, to the Center Staff Library.
 
In this way it will be available to staff and graduate students.
 
Over and above the gift, which is handsome enough, I appreciate very
 
much the kind sentiments expressed and reciprocate them fully.  I have long
 
known--and countless others with me--that you are not only a very gracious
 
and accomplished person, but also a first-rate scholar.  You are scarcely
 
rivaled on the lecture platform, and you are good at the footnotes, too,
 
when you put your mind to it.
 
If you do not possess a copy of Humaniora, the Festschrift which we
 
did for Archer Taylor way back in 1960, 1 shall be pleased to have my pub-
lisher send it to you.

I trust that you will have a nice summer, and I am sure this will be
 
case, what with this wonderful new trophy on your bookshelves.

Bob Beers
  
On May 26, 1972, lovers of music
 
lost a great friend when an auto ac-
cident suddenly took the life of Bob
 
Beers.
 Bob and his music touched the
 
lives of so many people in such di-
verse ways.  He was a fine old-time
 
fiddler of tunes he learned from his
 
mother's father, George Sullivan.
 
He was a respected concert violinist.
 
He revived the art of the psaltery
 
and introduced it as an instrument
 
when most of us knew it only as a
 
word.  He could whittle a whistle
 
from a branch in minutes.  With
 
his wife Evelyne and often their
 
daughter Martha, he sangs songs of
 
charm and beauty.
 
Most of all, he was the warm, re-
laxed, encouraging friend and host to
 
everyone who came to Fox Hollow, the
 
family festival founded by the Beers'
 
on their own home grounds in Peters-
burg, New York.  Many of us in the
 
community of feeling for traditional
 
music came to rely on the Beers
 
Family and Fox Hollow for an annual
 
chance to come together from Boston,
 
Chicago, Washington, St. Louis and
 
elsewhere to enjoy music together
 
for a few days, long anticipated
 
and then long remembered.  Word
 
I
rom Evclvne  i
s that the F
estival
 
will continue.
 Surely that feeling
 
of infectious, easy warmth and com-
fortable joy in each other's music
 
will continue and develop in us who
 
knew Bob, and will reach out to in-
clude those who didn't have a chance
 
to know him.
 Such was the essence
 
of Bob Beers -
 it will go on and
 
grow.

Rev. Gary Davis  
An additional note of sadness was
 
heard recently at the death of Rev.
 
Gary Davis, on Friday, May 5th.  Ori-
ginally from South Carolina, and blind
 
from birth, he had devoted his life to
 
religious work.
 Rev. Davis lived in
 
New York City with his wife and family
 
during the later part of his life,
 
where he continued his service as a
 
Baptist minister, and became well
 
known for his musicianship as well.
 
His unique style of guitar playing was
 
widely imitated by many students of
 
country blues, and the gospel and blues
 
songs that he composed were incorporated
 
into the repertoires of many prominent
 
folk song revivalists.
 
Rev. Davis died of a cardiac attack
 
at the age of 76.

Don't look for a July issue of
 
the Folk Letter, because your editor
 
is going to become irresponsible
 
this summer (
so what else is new?).
 
Actually, I'll probably get around
 
to putting out a summer issue some-
time in August, to help prepare you
 
for the shock of the oncoming fall
 
season.  So any news or comments on
 
anything you come across this summer
 
(that includes festival reviews from
 
all you gadabouts) that you think
 
will still be pertinent by then
 
should be sent in to the address
 
on the back cover.
 
All our paths will probably
 
cross this summer, so see you
 
around.  Meanwhile, have a full,
 
but by all means safe, summer.
 
Happy trails.

sing plans for

of what transpired at
 
meeting, when discus-
the fall weekend:
 
Can we play lacrosse?
 
It's against my religion.
 
We could play lacrosse the
 
street.
 
So don't despair, folks, The fall
 
weekend hasn't been forgotten.
 It's
 
in the early planning stages now, and
 
sometime during the summer you'll be
 
receiving more details about it.
 
Don't forget that we now have a
 
library for your use.
 Bill Barker
 
will be glad to assist you if you
 
want to borrow any of the materials.
 
Give him a call at 623-1196.  A list
 
of books that we have was printed 2
 
issues ago, and in addition to that
 
we have a copy of Joe Hickerson's
 
listing of folk festivals in the
 
U.S.  for this year, a copy of the
 
latest issue of the Journal of the
 
Folklore Society of Washington,
 
and the first two issues of Mugwumps. 
A complete list will be printed soon.

V 
have witnessed a long swapping of
 
in-jokes in these publications, all
 
making nutty references to wombats,
 
wombat bait, wombat abuse, wombat
 
droppings, etc.  Folks in Boston,
 
though, have gone one better than
 
that, especially the ones who like
 
to sing hymns that keep substitu-
ting "mother," "father," "brother,"
 
"
sister," etc. in each verse.  Peo-
ple here have carried this process
 
to its logical extreme -
 I bet no
 
wombat freak ever sang,  "I've a

A new issue of Sing Out! i
s here,
 
and once again they've made good on
 
their promise to include a record.
 
Songs that you can read and listen
 
to this issue include: Buttercup Joe,
 
Rolling Hills of the Border, Poor
 
Ellen Smith, General Taylor, The Ugly
 
Hour (
by Dave Bromberg),  t w o  ballads
 
from Sara Cleveland (Captain Webster
 
and the Queenstown Warning), and
 
others.
 
Meanwhile, Sing Out! is struggling
 
to keep its head above water finan-
cially.  The Friends of Sing Out! News-
letter has reported on a few projects
 
that some people have started to ben-
efit the magazine:
 
Quilted dulcimer cases are being
 
made by Linda Rothberg, Nickwackett,
 
37 Pollock Ave., Pittsfield, Mass.
 
She's selling them for $5.35, with
 
the profits going to Sing Out!  
One can also order Sing Out!  
bumper stickers from the Estersohns,
 
30 S. 22nd, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.
 
50Q each, or 100 for $20.
 
Someone also suggested buying Sing
  
Out! subscriptions for your local or
 
school library, which would provide
 
more dissemination for the magazine.
 
New subscription rates are $6 -
 one
 
year;
 $10 -
 two years, from 595 Broad-
way, NYC  10012.
 
Golden Sunshine
  
This Folk Song Society of ours is
 
blessed by having a lot of creative
 
individuals in its midst (
in case you
 
haven't already noticed) and Carolyn
 
McDade is one of them.  Golden Sunshine
  
is especially nice for those times when
 
kindred souls get together for an even-
ing of singing.  Try it some night when
 
your group is through with the chanties
 
and the drinking songs, and has moved
 
on to the more thoughtful! and peaceful
 
moments.  Thanks to Care l

Step It Down: Games, Plays, Songs and
  
Stories from the Afro-American Heritage, 
by Bessie Jones and Bess Lomax Hawes.
 
New York: Harper and Row, 1972.
 
Reviewed by Tony Saletan:
 
In the summer of 1964, I first met
 
Bessie Jones when she and Bess Hawes
 
and I were on the faculty of the Idyll-
wild School of Music and the Arts, now
 
part of the University of Southern Cal-
ifornia.  We, among other faculty, par-
ticipated in an intensive two-week work-
shop on various aspects of folk music.
 
The strong impression of Bessie Jones'
 
knowledge and repertoire (aided by
 
other members of the Georgia Sea Is-
land Singers who were teaching there,
 
too), and of Bess Hawes' sensitivity
 
and skill in interpreting Southern
 
Black material to largely white
 
Californians, still stands.
 
Out of that workshop has finally
 
come a book many people have been
 
waiting for, and it's a winner.
 
Step It Down: Games, Plays, Songs  
and Stories from the Afro-American
  
Heritage by Bessie Jones and Bess
 
Lomax Hawes has been published by
 
Harper and Row.
 
The book is full (about 70 items)
 
of songs, dances, and games from
 
Bessie Jones' repertoire, with her
 
comments on the meaning and feeling
 
of each one, plus Bess Hawes' percep-
tive contributions, ranging from the
 
historical and folkloric background
 
of an item, to insightful interpreta-
tions of the words (not only the song-
texts, but,  for example, the difference
 
between games and plays), to clear,
 
well-thought-out instructions for how
 
to get into the subtle clapping pat-
terns.
 
The music (melody line accompanied
 
by t
he text)  is well transcribed for
 
r
eading but w
ith respect for the

If you've been inspired by a
 
Bessie Jones concert, or been with
 
her at Pinewoods Camp for a week,
 
or had one-way contact with her by
 
records or television, you'll want
 
this book.
 It costs $10 -
 about
 
14  a song.
 Distribution seems to
 
be a problem in our society.  A month
 
after it was published, calls to Bos-
ton bookstores were not too fruitful
 
-
 one large store had one copy;  two
 
other stores I called didn't, and one
 
thought the price was higher and had
 
the authors' names reversed.
 If your
 
favorite bookstore doesn't have it,
 
order it.
 If you don't have the
 
bread, badger your local library to
 
get it for you.
 It's a fine book.

Bessie Jones was honored Saturday
 
night, May 13th, at Yale University
 
when Willie Ruff and Dizzy Gillespie
 
as well as a dozen children from St.
 
Simons Island, Georgia, and Bessie
 
herself joined in an evening to bene-
fit the folk school that Bessie is
 
starting on the Island.  Besides being
 
an outstanding evening of music (
in-
cluding a beautifully moving Gillespie-
Ruff improvisation) it was an unusual
 
benefit.  No money changed hands that
 
night -
 the concert, supported by Yale,
 
was free to the public -
 but Prof. Ruff
 
appealed to the large audience (
"there
 
must be a million dollars worth of tal-
ent in this room") for skilled ptople
 
who could help build the school.
 At a
 
reception later, he told me that he
-
had already been approached by two
 
architects and an industrial designer.
 
Prof. Ruff is bringing Bessie up to
 
join the Yale Music School faculty for
 
part of the Fall.  All of us in this
 
part of the U.S. should benefit by
 
1iviug her so n
r.

Black Waters Still Running: 
You probably know or have heard a lot
 
of songs from the mountain states that
 
have to do with troubles facing the peo-
ple of the mining communities in this
 
country. If your interest in these matters
 
is more than just musical, you might like
 
to know about a magazine called Mountain
  
Life and Work, which addresses itself to
 
miners' health & safety, economic devel-
opment in the mountain states, pertinent
 
legislative action (or lack of it), and
 
ecological issues. Subscriptions are $5
 
from The Council of the Southern Moun-
tains, College Box 2307, Berea, Kentucky.
 
The March issue ran a photograph of a
 
hillside stripped to bare soil, and be-
side it this quote by Wendell Berry:
 
"You did not inherit yo r land from your
 
father; you are borrowing it from your
 
children."

Book Review
 
Step It Down: Games, Plays, S
cmgs and Stories from the Afro-American
  
Hertttge. by 3
ese
 i
n Jones and Bess Lomax I
lawes
 
N.Y.: Harper & Row, 1972, xvii; Pp 233. $10.00.
 
As Beth Hav
es says in th
e introduction, "T
his book i
s really about
 
one of the ways of growing up in the United States.  In pert, it i
s a
 
memoir —the long r
mbsrings of a
 Negro i
n born in the Southern
 
poverty belt sxo*id the turn of this esutury, a detailing of the mind
 
and body
- and heart skills in her '
days caning up'  As set d
c e
ni here,
 
the games and dances that she r
emembers form a k
ind of double I
m
a
g
e
  
for throughout th e
n moves * so me of the shape and thrust of the crowded,
 
impoverished, life dem e
nding, li f
t-loving c
omplex of the Neg r
o fa
mily
 
of fifty years ago "
 
But the book is far nore tban this.  It is Vw first published cor-
pu
s of Afro-Aaericsn geis
.  Sc a
m of what is recorded here
 
pi
.l in other eclisetl e
ns, but there se w
er before has been a complete
 
acccamting.  More are a
p w imats]y
- 70 games recorded in detail with
 
acc o
mpanying maxic and sty
-la of play
-.  Thw chapter h
e n
dings read:  Baby
 
G
s and Play
-; Clsp dng Pl a
ys; Jm s &
 Skips; Sieging Plays;
 Ring
 Plays;
 
Dances; No s
es Plays and Na
n. Am e
s
nts; Outdoor G
s, Songs an
d Stories.
 
The.e headings th
lv.s are quaintly reminiscent of th c
e. of Neval]. a
nd
 
Gomme wh e
n recording the American and !t g 4 b c
terparts at the end of
 
the 19th Century.  AM indeed there is much of Newell  -
 Gomme in this
 
bock, especially in the Singing Plays, R
ing Plays, Na
n. Plays sad (tdoor
 
Games.  But the Cl
ing Plays, J
m an
d
. Ski f
ls and Du
nces are not so
 
r
eadily
- rec
iseable i
n tox a of European antecedents.  Nez'. the African
 
herita e, the mood of which pervades the whole book,
 also to have
 
provided
 * of the content.  Though this w
ill probably not be assessable
 
until there is much more recasting of childr e
n's play
- in Africa.  Given
 
the current
 &zed-year lag in the study of these "
trivialities", we may
 
well weit a long t
ime to know the t
rue i
ngredients for this most welcome
 
book.
 
As ve i
l a
s a record of a time and a p
lace, and a record of extended
 
family pl a
y (
because th e
s. activities were with children,not simply for
 
child r
en), there is thr o
u g
h o
ut the quite freak attempt of au t
hor l
lamas to
 
understand e
c
nt O
b
i
 or Jones
.  This is particularly valuable because the
 
some differences are constantly at work in a
 multitude of urban pr
rams
 
throughout the country.  She s
 "
Whe r
e the one gr o
up (
white) anticipated
 
co
mpetiti o
n, the other (
black) expected co-operation end
 mutual s
ort.
 
Where one pr o
moted individual s 4t1 and achia
nt, the other wanted
 
general participation.  Where one insisted an kmWledge, of and compliance
 
with a set of rules, the other stressed dramatic interpretation and per-
ceptive
".  Those of us '
wh
o thought of g
ames in ter s
e of wtnn4iag or
 
l
osing were especially f
rustrated; there wer, no ,iwa m a
nd few lo
se r
..
 
I think
 mo
ot of the white students wh
o felt that we we r
e not really playing
 
ga me at all; we were doing something else, but what it vex., we weren't sure.
 
And 'w
hat they were doing has usually been called playing pasti es or amuse-
ments i
n the Europe a
n tradition, but in the cross-cultural array of world
 
ge
ne playing, it has constituted the basic type of group play a
ctivity.
