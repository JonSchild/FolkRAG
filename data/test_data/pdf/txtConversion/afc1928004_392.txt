HAPPY IRISH COUPLE.

THE FINE IRISH GENTS. 
It's a 
shame on the stage, how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to Me, 
How the people in front, will stand such insult; 
Receiving such blockheads with glee. 
If they went to old Ireland they'd find their mistake, 
For our boys and our girls are well dressed, 
In manners as well to you I 
will tell, 
For they stand in the land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For in singing, and dancing and all kinds of sport, 
And if ever to Ireland you went, 
From their heads to .their toes, they all wear decent clothes, 
I 
speak of a 
true Irish gent. 
Sure they make up their faces, and look just like fools, 
And they walk like a 
dog with three legs, 
If they went tb old Ireland, to show them such sport, 
They'd be pelted with stones and bad eggs: 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope for to see, that little Isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For in singing &c.,

I 
LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR, 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY HUGHES.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be of good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
Now, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she said ? 
And the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could he, 
But my brothers and sisters, sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll conic never fear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll live, yes, although we be poor,

WHERE THE ROSES BLOOMS 
Sung by HARRY W ESTERN at the Theatre Oomicine, 
Washington. 
Copyrighted by KNAHE and McGowas, Pitteburgh, Pa. 
HOW I 
love in the fields to ramble,. 
To hear the rustling corn, 
And watch the silken tassels waving, 
In the sweet and dewy morn. 
I 
love to hear sweet music 
From birds in the woodland gloom, 
But the wish of all I 
have now Is, 
To live:where the roses bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Fairest of all flowers, 
Their odor is perfume. 
But the wish of all I 
have now is, 
To live where the roses bloom. 
I 
love to smell the gentle lilac, 
And the honeysuckles climbing on the wall, 
With the brightly colored morning gloties twining. 
In their beauty on the walL 
I 
gathered lilies from the brookside, 
And daisies by the silvery moon, 
But the wish of all I 
have now is, 
To live where the roses bloom. 
UP AT DUDLEY GROVE. 
Written by EDWARD HA.RRIGAN for W ILL H. 
MORTON, and sung 
by him at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theater Cornique, 
514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Copyright by A. J. Fisuna, 1878. 
THE young men's social club 
They gave a 
grand excursion; 
They had a 
band 
From Manahan, 
Two barges and a 
boat. 
The lads were titivated; 
Yes, fit for sweet diversion. 
I'd Kitty McGlinn 
Away from home 
In a 
linen overcoat. 
CHORUS. 
She played the concertina 
As through the woods:we'd rove; 
/ 
was all alone with Kitty MeGlinn 
17p at Dudley Grove. 
I 
danced in every set; 
In the waltz how gay I'd wheel her, 
No pivoter could equal her, 
A. darling and a 
dear; 
And as we'd spin around 
They'd say, " Ain't she a 
speelerI" 
Then I'd ta-ta up to the bar 
For a 
schooner of German beer. 
She played the, etc. 
You'd ought to hear her sing, 
Like a 
barber shop canary! 
I 
hate to tell just like a 
bell 
She'd reach the upper C. 
Ballads are her style; 
Like my own, my bonny Mary, 
She's a 
duck, and I'm in luck— 
She's the lass that captured me. 
She played the, etc.

HARRY STANWOOD. Banjoist and Comedian. 
by SAMUEL N. 
MITCHELL. 
I'VE been dreaming—oh, yes I've been dreaming.. 
Of things that occur ev'ry day; 
I've been dreaming of people who worry 
And plod through the world in dismay; 
They grumble at all that's around them, 
And snarl like a 
cur in the street, 
While, if you attempt to approach them, 
They'll squirm like a 
snake at your feet. 
This world is as good as they make them, 
But snarlers, I 
say, we must " shake" them; 
For, no matter what way you may take th.m. 
They'll worry and grumble the same. 
I've been dreaming—oh, yes, I've been dreaming-
Of men who pretend to be tine, 
But neglect their poor wives and their daughter; 
That they may seek pleasure, and shine; 
They flirt on the streets and the highways, 
And can y 
a 
proud, empty hea 
While in some dark alley or by ways 
Their children are crying for bread. 
Why men act so queer and so bold, sir. 
Is not at all strange; for we're told, sir, 
That a 
score of poor women are sold, air, 
By armies of rascals like 
I've been dreaming—oh, yes, I've been dreaming-
Of women who try to do well, 
But are always abused by their husbands 
For failings too numerous to tell; 
If 
lotus's ain't cooked right to suit them, 
They'll muse ev'ry thing in the land; 
And if the poor woman disputes them, 
She'll feel the eftects of a 
hand. 
A 
wife should be ever respected, 
And never , at all be neglected, 
For surely she must feel affected 
At treatment she often receives. 
rve•been dreaming—oh, yes I've been dreaming— 
Of days in the future I 
see, 
When hote of the present will vanish, 
And all will be happy and free; 
As things at this time are progressing, 
A 
change t'r the better we need; 
For now it Is really distressing 
TO look on eaCh dastardly deed 
Let every one hereabouts plead it 
or surely a 
ch mge is much needed, 
And now is the time we should lead it, 
And have a 
reform in our land,

&RENCE LAVERE, 
Written by Wm. J. SCANLAN, and performed by SCANLAN & 
CRONIN. 
Music published by F W Hmatitnc, No. 
50 Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day, 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T. 
CHORUS. 
While pivoting, waltzing in the grand dance so gay, 
At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh! the darling young ladies say I 
am a 
dear, 
Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavers. 
On a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brushoff my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and dean. 
I 
am a 
good hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A card player, well I'm considered quite fine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, ete. 
At a 
quarter of two I 
must be on Broadway, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
saw the other day 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach in summer I'll go, 
Cut such a 
dash, ah! what a 
show. 
There in the ball- room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance. 
While pivoting, etc.

TOMMY'S RETURN. 
I 
inissedjit,. dear Father, most sadly I 
know, 
To eat all your counsels away, 
To riot with idlers and lounge about so, 
But judge not too harshly, I 
pray. 
I'm wretched, degraded, and poor it is true, 
And rags are my only array, 
But to my transgressions, I've bidden adieu. 
Ten, Father, forgive me, I 
pray I 
CHORUS. 
0 
welcome, my boy, 0 
welcome back home, 
No longer to sin or to roam 1 
The hearts that have loved you rejoice as you come, 
We welcome, we welcome you home. 
Dear Father, I 
come like the " Prodigal Son." 
I've sinned against Heaven and thee; 
I 
ask but a 
place in the old cottage home, 
Once more your own Tommy to be. 
The fancies I 
cherished so fondly in youth, 
Long, long since, have vanished away, 
The counsels you gave me, I 
found to be true, 
Then, Father fbrgive me, I 
pray! 
CHO.— 
Again and again, I've repented in tears, 
And prayed to my Father above, 
My sins to forgive, to remove all my fear; 
Be heard me in mercy and love' 
Forgiveness, dear Father and Mother, I 
crave, 
For the sorrow I 
caused you to know, 
For God in his mercy is able to save 
Your Tommy from ruin and woe. 
OHO.—

THE IRISH POTA -TO. 
Parody on the "Old Oaken Bucket." 
iTOW sweet to the taste is the Irish potato, 
As memory awakens the thought of the Ant! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and I.)autiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt; 
1: thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On the broad sunny hill-slope adjoining the'ritill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing 
For some were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
CHORUS. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skinned potato that grew on the hill. 
That delectable plant I'll prize while I'm able, 
For often at noon when returned from the field, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edible that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
plied knife and fork with a 
hearty good will 
Alas! there are none of the old-fashioned flavor, • 
None like the real " simons" that grew on the hilL 
The mealy, <tn. 
How prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As, poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth I 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it,. 
Though allected by rot on a 
long summer's drouth; 
And now far removed from that situation, 
Where I 
used to partake of the root to my 
filL 
Fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
And sigh for the " kidney" that grew on the bill.

GIVE A 
THOUGHT TO THE HONEST WORK-
INGMAN. 
An original song sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Grand Central 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
This is a 
world of luck and chance, of losses and of gain, 
Some lives are filled with pleasure, while others naught but pain, 
If yours is filled with comfort enjoy it while you can, 
But sometimes try and give a 
thought to the honest workingman, 
There's many a 
mighty millionaire who now sleeps in his grave, 
Who never gave a 
single dime the laboring man to save, 
Of such'as these to sing about 'tis not my aim or plan, 
For I'll sing of men who gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There is one, who though in wealth he rolled, whose charity 
was sure, 
And the clink of his bright yellow gold was music to the poor, 
And many a 
cheerless hearthstone by his kindness was made 
bnght 
In noble deeds of charity that never saw the light. 
By some beloved, by some adored, by others fawned around, 
He turned not to the right or left but nobly stood his ground, 
In every mighty enterprise each project or each plan, 
George Peabody always gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There was a 
man who rose to fame and fortune, swift and sure, 
Whose name will be remembered in our hearts forevermore; 
Though wealth rolled in his coffers for years on every hand, 
He shared it with the hungry and the poor of this bright land. 
He was a 
Nature's nobleman if ever there was one, 
A 
tender, loving husband, a 
kind and gentle son; 
His bright face we will see no more, forget him now who can ? 
Abe Lincoln always gave a 
thought to the honest workingman. 
Written and composed by Sam DEVERE. 
Sung with immense success at Park Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I'M sick and sad, and almost mad, 
The world seems upside down, 
Since the only gal I 
ever loved 
Has bounced away from town. 
I 
loved her long, I 
loved her strong, 
And many presents bought her, 
I 
thought that she belonged to me. 
But a 
Dutch pork but her caught her. 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
handsome gal, she lived with her mother, 
And they kept a 
poultry stand, 
Brit she got dead struck on a 
Dutch pork:butcher, 
And they sailed for a 
foreign land. 
My grief was great, my heart did ache, 
When I 
found she'd run away, 
But lived in hopes that she'd come back, 
As time passed day by day, 
But not a 
word fram her I 
heard 
So cruel and deceiving, 
To think she'd go and leave me so, 
My heart was sore with grieving. 
Chorus.—She was, &c. 
The very day she skipped away, 
How could she so deceive, 
She borrowed all the cash I 
had, 
And left me alone to grieve. 
Rumor said that she had wed, 
One fellow said he seen her, 
She was making tracks with two big sacks, 
Full of sausage for the Hamburg steamer. 
Chorus.—She was, (tc. 
One day I 
strayed where the big ship laid, 
They had just cast off the line, 
When there I 
spied on the deck above, 
The gal I 
once called mine. 
When I 
saw her there I 
had to swear, 
From love I 
turned to hate her, 
She closed one eye, said " George, good-bye, 
Perhaps I'll see you later." 
Chorus.—She was, &c. 
The Follies of the Times, 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
IF' you'll list to my ditty, 
I'll sing to you a 
song 
About the follies of the times, 
And tell you right from wrong; 
'Tis wrong to see the poor man starve, 
Who will not labor shirk! 
"Tis wrong to see that great man, Green, 
Deprive him of his work. 
It was an evil hour 
We placed that man in power, 
He robs but the poor when the wolf's at 
the door, 
But his pride we soon will lower. 
They say we've got a 
panic, 
That all the rich are broke, 
They want to get rid of their debts, 
As did our friend Jay Cooke. 
And then they all can start again, 
'Tis thus the world does go: 
The poor man suffers for it all, 
And sinks beneath the blow ; 
But a 
happier day will dawn, 
We'll hail the coming morn, 
When Cooke 
Co. to the bottom shall go, 
Auk.1 wish they'd never been born, 
it was an evil hour, etc. 
The flag the boys have fought for, 
And gained their honest scars, 
,Tis folded when it high should wave, 
Our glorious Stripes and Stars; 
,Tis folded when it high should wave 
In every tyrant's face ; 
That flag was formed to help and save, 
It's people from disgrace ; 
Then why should a 
power like Spain, 
Insult us again and again; 
Grant may think it a 
joke, but the people have 
spoke, 
And they'll wipe out the foul, foul stain. 
It was an evil hour, etc. 
A 
noble ship she sailed away, 
In freedom's cause was manned— 
I 
hundred throbbing hearts on board, 
They formed a 
gallant band, 
Her destiny was Cuba, 
That bright and sunny isle, • 
Which shall belong to Uncle Sam, 
But wait a 
little while. 
The " Virginius " cause was just, 
May the swords of her captors rust; 
Brave Ryan's name shall live in fame, 
When his slayers are turned to dust. 
It was an evil hour, et..

DUFFY'S GRANP OPENING NIGHT. 
Written and sung with great success by DiCr 
AN7IrAsoN, of 
ANDERSON & MURRAY. 
Did yees ever hear tell of Pat Duffy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
Last week sure he started a 
bar-room, 
Right down on the corner below; 
There was lager, free lunches and whiskey, 
Faith indeed 'twas an illigant sight, 
But the boys, one an' all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
CHORUS. 
Ah! but Duffy had terrible liquor, 
'Twould knock you up high as a 
kite; 
And the bar, I'm sure, never looked sicker, 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sint out invitations, 
An' invited his frinds for to come, 
He tould thim he'd trate thim all dacint, 
An' give thim their fill of good rum; 
They came there in droves an' by dozens, 
An' got into a 
terrible fight, 
They broke all the doors and the windows, 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah! but Duffy, etob 
They stole all the stock that lie had there, 
An' drank up the liquor so s.weet, 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
An' threw him out into the street; 
They scattered his family, an' left thim 
To roam in a 
terrible plight, 
Poor Duffy lives now on free lunches, 
Since he gave his grand opening night. 
Ah! but Duffy, etc.

OF TOWN. 
Copyrighted 1874, and Musio to be had of E. IL lisnnnto, 299 
Bowery, N. Y. Price 10 cents. 
Composed by Mesors, DE DONATO. 
Written and sung by 
NED HARRIGAN. 
You see I 
belong to New York, my boys, 
On dear old Manhattan Isle, 
Famed for its wealth and its beauty, boys, 
Its darling dear girls and their style; 
On Broadway, my boys, or the Bowery, 
No stranger e'er met with a 
frown; 
Take my word, I 
belong to the city, 
And hail from the East Side of town. 
Cnouus. 
The East Side of town 
Beats the world, up and down 
For pic-nic, party, or ball; 
For boys without fear, 
And good lager beer, 
Tho East Side of town beats them all. 
The dandies they dance on the Avenue V, 
In aristocratic soirees; 
Champagne they drink as if it were tea, 
Their pa's and their mamma's to please; 
They should see the quadrille called the Nink 
Or a 
real old-fashioned break-down; 
They pivot, you bet, on a 
spangle, 
The girls from the East Side of town. 
The East Side, 3te. 
The mechanic you will find there too— 
The industrious laboring class; 
The sewing girl from her labor and toil 
On the sidewalk doth cheerfully pass; 
She is happy indeed, and little doth need, 
If she has but a 
calico gown; 
We all do agree that if jolly you'd be, 
You must live on the East Side of town. 
The East Side, eta.

WREN ERIN FIRST ROSE. 
By the FIELDINGS. 
WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, and saw it was good: 
The Emerald oi Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring of the world, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, in her soil, In her station thrice biest, 
With her back toward Britain, and her lace to the West; 
Erin stands proudly insular, on her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons; like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die. 
Alas! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance presume to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue. 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms heave high for the worthy and brave, 
But Do cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Veil of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rifie arch of the Ocean, and quo 
of the West.

Your teeth of pearly whiteness, you lips of coral hue, 
'Tis hard to tear mysel away and bid you fond adieu: 
When I 
am far, yes far away beyond the ocean's wave 
No other heart shall win my love no others will I 
crave, 
So good-bye, Annie dear, of this we both agree, 
That I'll be ever true to you, and you'll be true to me.

So good-bye, Annie dear, I'll soon return again, 
We cannot long be parted or my heart would break with pain, 
Farewell, Annie dear, when I 
return once more, 
To live with you in happiness for ever evermore, 
My pockets full of money and my Leart brim full of love, 
Oh! good-bye, Annie dear, my gentle little Dove; 
And when to church to married be, we go with merry heart, 
in happy wedlock we'll be join'd and never rnor will part 
So good-bye, Annie dear, my eyes are fill'd with tears, 
I'll soon return to you again to drive away all fears, 
So good-bye, Annie dear, I'll soon return again, 
We cannot long be parted or my heart would break with pain.

THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER, THAT 
LIVES O'ER THE WATER. 
I've been caught in a 
net by a 
dear little pet, 
And her eyes are as blue as the deep rolling sea. 
She's a 
Fisherman's daughter—she lives o'er the water— 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me, 
She's as rare as the salmon, there's really no gammen 
As sweet as the shrimps newly served up for tea; 
My soul she has caught, and a 
place I 
have bought, 
Where a 
ray of bright sunshine for ever will be. 
And—she's a 
Fisherman's daughter, she lives o'er tits 
water, 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
She's barefooted and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sings her wild songs to the murmuring sea ; 
She'll dance on the sand where the Fisherman stands, 
And join in the muse of a 
wild swelling glee. 
She sits in her boat and scuds o'er the billows, 
And flirts with the spray like a 
sea-skimming ; 
She laughs at the winds—whose revels are musi... 
And beats to the time with the stroke of her skull. 
And--she's a 
Fisherman's daughter, (Pe's.. 
The bells they shall ring, and the sailors shall sing; 
" 
Y-heave ho ! y-heave ho boys! for, Time's on the wiaz 
To see pretty Sarah, the bride of the sea !" 
Who's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
Her flair I 
will deck with a 
wreath of bright sea-weed, 
I'll plant in her bosom a 
blooming moss rose; 
She shall go like a 
fairy with sweet tinkling music. 
With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.

Sung and composed by GEO. F. JAavis, at Buckley's Va-
rieties, San Francisco. 
An'..—Norall McShane. 
My name is Tim Murphy, I 
was borne in Killarney, 
In a 
sweet little spot of the Emerald Isle, 
How I 
sigh when I 
think of the cot I 
was born in, 
And of my dear old friend I 
left far behind. 
But if our dear brotherhood would stick together, 
And say that our watch-word it ever would be, 
REPEA.T. 
That never again shall our sword be then sheathed, 
Till Ireland becomes like America free. 
Now where is the country that stood the oppression 
Like old Ireland, the gem of the sea. 
It reminds me of the famine that was in old Ireland, 
Who sent us relief but the flag of the free? 
Now let us all say, when in battle assembled, 
God bless the dear banner the flag of the free. 
For never again shall our swords, &c. 
Your sons are as noble and as brave as any, 
I'd like for to know why they cannot be free, 
They have oft fought the battles, its of the oppressed, 
If they ask for their rights, why transported they'd be. 
Now brotherhood quickly fall in and eesemble, 
To strike a 
strong blow to set Ireland free. 
For never again shall our swords, &c.

The girls have much to answer for, 
By the way in which they tease,

can think of, I

Sometimes we go to parties, 
Where she's a 
well-known flirt; 
Then she says there is nolarm, 
But I 
feel so awfully hurt— 
I 
try to read her every thought, 
And watch her every glance, 
Each morning, noon, and night, 
Whene'er I 
have the chance. 
SPOKEN.—I 'whisper in her ear the same old story of  
Henrietta! etc. 
If she'd only give a 
whisper; 
If she'd say that little—Yes— 
Then I'd feel in Paradise, 
And my fate I 
then could guess. 
But in neither words nor ways, 
Her consent I 
cannot trace, 
And if I

There is a " breach of promise case."

Ain—Er/Jana:patio-a Day. 
OLD IRELAND is our country. 
God send her liberty. 
All of that glorious nation now are exiled far from thee, 
But freedom's dawn will some day come, 
At least, we trust and pray that in our Isle we'll celebrate 
A 
victorious Patrick's Day. 
With Harp and Shamrock bright, 
We'll make a 
glorious sight. 
That emblem once unfurled takes the sway, 
We'll join both heart and hand, 
Then no tyrant dare disband 
The Sons of Erin's Isle on St. Patrick's Day. 
All honor to the loyal men we mean to mention yet, 
O'Mahony, O'Connell, and the patriot Emmet; 
Their names shall last forever, lit with the golden ray, 
Their shadows mingle with us on 
Our great St. Patrick's Day. 
With Harp and Shamrock, etc 
IRISH PEG FROM TIPPERARY, 
Written by Jon); FIELDINGs. 
just come o'er from Tipperary,. 
Where I 
worked all in the bogs, 
Digging turf for a 
man named Haley, 
For a 
shilling a 
day, and my grog. 
But God between us and all harm, 
I've lost the use of me legs, 
Now if you want paynuts or apples, 
Buy them of poor Irish Peg. 
I 
can scarcely walk across the street, 
I 
can hardly sleep at night, 
Oh if I 
could only get married, 
I 
know 'twould save my poor life. 
Now gentlemen on me take pity, 
Here's a 
chance so come ahead, 
Just take me while I'm in the humor, 
Who will have poor Irish Peg. 
Thank you, kind sir, I've just got your note, 
I 
will meet you to-morrow, 
That gentleman here with the white coat, 
has relieved all my sorrow, 
In his note here he says my dear Peg, 
I 
love you, just name the day, 
When you and I 
shall to the church go, 
Then you will be M's.

SCENE.—A 
drawing-room. 
Frank (writing at table). — Well, thank Heaven, the bustle 
and stir of our wedding is all over. 
I 
can hardly realize 
that I am a 
married man. 
What! I, a 
quiet batchelor 
heretofore—almost afraid of the sound of my own voice— 
to be suddenly transmogrified into a 
happy husband 1 
It's 
a 
pleasant dream! 
It can 't 
be real. What a 
pleasure it is 
to sit down and write in the seclusion and quietness of 
one's own house. 
No noise. 
No tumult. 
Thank the 
stars! I've got such a 
delightful, good-tempered, and 
charming little wife, too. 
Why, she is just as quiet as a 
mouse in a 
pineapple cheese. 
Ah! there 's 
nothing like 
matrimony, after all; that is, for such a 
nervous indi-
vidual as myself. 
There, I 
have almost finished my 
letter, 
and I 
have not suffered a 
single interruption. 
Now, if I 
were a 
batchelor, there would most certainly be from half-
a-dozen to a 
dozen wandering organ-grinders prowling 
about my window by this time. 
Kitty (singing without). 
Frank.--That's my wife! Oh, Lord! I 
thought she did 'at 
sing. 
Ugh! how that " crescendo" grates upon my poor 
nerves! 
Really, it 's 
too much. I 
can't stand it, 
ENTER, KITTY. 
Kitty. — Why, how do you do this morning, my dear 
Frank? Come and kiss me, do -now ; wont you, my darl-
ing teazy-weazy pet of a 
husband? (They embrace.) Thank 
heaven, there- is no " excise " edict against a 
man kissing 
his lawful wife, is there, Frank ? 
Fra721!. — No, my love. 
In my case, you see, it's the 
"Frank-ing" privilege. 
Really, I 'm delighted to see you 
look so charming this morning; but, don't you think you 
will injure your throat by such vocal gymnastics as I 
just 
heard you perform, and so early in the day, too? 
Kitty. — Oh, bless you, no! 
Why, when I 
was at home 
I 
used to wake up everyone in the house, long before day-
light, practicing my favorite operatic gems. 
Everybody 
used to admire them so. 
Frank—Did they, indeed, my love! [
Aside. — Oh, dear ! 
here's a 
pretty prospect for a 
quiet man.] 
So you were 
quite an early bird, eh? Did you catch the worm, my 
love ? 
Kitty.—Yes, and I 
pleased Ma and Pa immensely. 
Would you not like to hear me render my last "seena," 
Frank? 
Frank ( aside).—[ Worse than "sena" and salts to me ! ] 
Well, my pet, you must excuse me. I 
have to go directly 
down town. 
Some other time I 
will hear you with pleas-
ure. [Aside—That's a 
whopper.] 
Kitty—Why, it won't take me a 
second. 
Listen! Now 
I'm supposed to be in the Grand Opera. 
ff'rank (aide). —[I 
wish you were 1] 
[Kitty advances tragically, and chirps; Frank sinks resign-
edly into chair.] 
.Kitty.—There! my charming husband, what do you 
say to that? Isn't the music superb? 
[THE AFRICAN CANARY.—COIIIi1111Cd.] 
Frank. — Oh, delightful I [Aside.—I 
should like to have 
the composer under my arm, now; I'd punch his devoted 
head with all the pleasure in life.] 
My dear, won't you 
oblige me by being still for awhile? You know I 
love 
quiet so. 
My nerves are all unstrung this morning. I 
think I 
want—yes, I 
know I 
want— 
Kitty. — Want what, my love ? 
Frank.—A 
cocktail, my sweet. 
Kitty. — You know, my darling, I 
dote upon music of any 
kind. 
I 
adore it! 
Why, I 
could sing and play all night 
and all day, and never tire. 
Frank.—Could you, indeed, now ? 
Kitty.—Yes, and I 
am so glad that I 
have got such an 
appreciative husband. 
You know I 
can sing you to sleep, 
sing you awake, and sing—sing to delight you all the 
blessed time. 
Frank (aside).—[Iwish she was at Sing- Sing, if this is the 
way she is going to delight me.] Well, my 
dearest, I 
must 
be off. 
Good-morning! ta! ta! 
(Frank going.) 
Kitty.—Au revoir, my duck. 
(Shyly) Oh, Frank! 
Frank. — Well, my darling? 
Kitty. — You ' ve forgotten something. 
Frank. — Have I, Sweetness? What is it; my gloves? 
No: here they are. 
My handkerchief? No : I 
have that. 
What have I 
forgotten? 
Kitty (shyly).—Don't you know ? 
Frank.—Oh, yes! What a 
fool I 
was! Of course. 
(
Re-
turns and embraces her.) 
Now I 
think of the subject, my 
dear, don't you think you could repress this little musical 
35 
monomania of yorrs? 
Just to oblige me ? You see I 
hate all kinds of noises. 
They drive me wild. 
Kitty.—What! must I 
not sing or play ? 
Don't you wish 
me to enjoy myself at all! 
Oh, you good-for-nothing 
brute! There! (
Sobs loudly.) 
Frank. — Now, my love, don't fly into such a 
passion. 
Don't be unreasonable. 
Kitty . — You ugly beast, you; don't talk to me! Oh— 
that—I— thought you would take me from—my papa and 
my mamma, and try to—rob—me—of my little—innocent 
enjoyment. 
I—wish I—was—dead! I—do— now! 
_M•ank ( trying to coax). — There, now, don't get excited. 
Don't. 
Kitty (aside).—[I'll cure this quiet husband of mine.] 
'm—not— excited. It's you who are excited. I 
hate you. 
And I'll have you to know, sir, that I 
shall do just as I 
please! 
There! Whether you like it or not. 
There! 
Frank. — Now don't be absurd, my angel. 
Kitty. — Absurd, 
sir 4 
It's you who are absurd, 
sir! 
Don't talk to me! I'll—go home—and this very day, too!

properly divorced." [A 
la Stanton.] 
Frank. — But, my dear, you will listen to reason, wont 
you? 
Kitty.—There's no reasoning with you, sir!

I ' 11 cure him. of his nervousness.] I'll never live with you 
[THE AFRICAN CANARY.— Continued.] 
another day, sir. 
I've taken you under false pretences. 
(Eva Kitty.) 
Frank.—Have you? Well, there ' s a 
pair of us. then. 
What the devil is she up to now, I 
wonder? 
Here 's 
a 
pretty market I ' ye brought my pigs to! 
[Enter, Kitty, bringing in a 
bass drum and trumpet, 
which she plays on, while Frank stops his ears in horror 
and sinks into chair.] 
KitN.—There, sir! I 
shall have as much music as I 
please, sir! 
There! How do you like it? 
Hey? 
Frank.—Oh, you unreasonable woman! You'll drive 
me to distraction! 
Stop ! 
Stop! 
. 
Kitty (running up the seales.)—There, sir, I 
shall sing, 
too, just as much as I 
like! 
And I 
should like to see the 
miserable specimen of humanity who would say that we 
women have n't a 
wiee in the affairs of the nation. I 
stand 
here for my rights, sir. 
(Crows.) 
Frank (very nervously.—Now, my good, amiable little 
woman, do listen to me just for a 
single moment. Wont 
you? 
Kitty (playing On trumpet).—No! you commenced it! 
There! I ' 11 end it. 
[Blows trumpet in Frank's face and backs him up till he 
falls in the bass drum. Frank walks off with the bass drum 
on his back, and Kitty beating it violently in the rear.] 
TIPPERARY BOY. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNEY 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy, 
She looks so nice and gay, 
She's left me here to pine and die, 
For she has gone away, 
She ran away the other night, 
Which did my brain annoy, 
Last Friday night she did elope, 
With a 
Tipperary boy. 
CliORLIS. 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy, 
She's gone with a 
Tipperary boy, 
Tipperary, Tipperary, Tipperary boy. 
It was outside her mother's door, 
She heard this fellow play, 
She sobbed and sigh'd and said oh my, 
lie's stole my heart away, 
'Twas the music that enchanted her, 
Till her heart jumped like a 
toy, 
So last Friday night she skedaddled 
With the Tipperary boy 
Have you seen, &c. 
I've searched the village through awl through, 
But her I 
cannot find, 
I've wept till I 
can weep no more, 
My eyes are nearly blind; 
But if ever I 
come across them, 
I 
mean him and Molly Malloy, 
I'll put a 
head on her and choke 
The Tipperary boy. 
Have you seen, 4tc, 
Oh, I'm a 
poor old nig, 
And dats my only boy, 
I 
tell you he's his daddy's pickanniny; 
And when I 
gaze upon him, 
It fills my heart with joy 
I 
feel I'm young again in old Virginny. 
Yes, ebery word am true 
De old man tells to you, 
I 
takes after him in style, and cut. and figure; 
Dars no boy in de land 
Can begin to shuffle sand, 
Like dis highfalutin extraordinary nigger, 
So watch dis old coon and his son. 
Oh, fadder, got get mad, 
When I 
tell you dat your shuffles ain't in time; 
You must point your heels down so, 
And don't you dance so slow, 
Just watch de little movement dats in mine. 
(Old Man.) 
Don't talk boy, its no use, 
For I 
isn't quite as loose 
As I 
was some fifty years ago; 
Den I 
could dance and sing, 
And cut a 
pigeon's wing, 
But I 
tell you dat de old man isn't slow, 
So watch dis old coon and his son. 
Oh, fadder, 'xplain to me 
Why you bend so in de knee, 
Is it ' cause that you got der rheumatiz; 
I 
know you isn't well, 
Dars something you won't tell 
Dat keeps you kinder backward in your biz. 
(Old Man.) 
Oh, boy, don't act so wild, 
Act like a 
natural child, 
Just give your fadder one more chance; 
For I 
tell you 'twont be long, 
When de old man he'll be gone, 
(Spoken.)—But, Sam, he never will give in on de dance. 
So watch dis old coon and his son.

Musio Pnbl %shed by L. P. GOULLAUBD, 86 Tremont St., Boston. 
You see to-night my delight, and laughing all the while, 
am in love with a 
charming girl, with beauty she's beguil'd 
Every evening I 
pass her house about the hour of eight, 
When I 
go by I 
wink my 
eye, to the dear one at the gate. 
CHORUS. 
She's the prettiest and sweetest of all the girls. [Syral 
A 
fairy like lady with auburn curls. [Syna] 
She always gives a 
winning smile, 
Whenever I 
pass her gate, 
With joy sparkling in her eye— 
My pretty little Kate ! 
My darling little Kate, who watches by the gate, is like a 
blushing rose— 
She may be mine some future time, that nobody knows; 
in a 
shady dell, on Sunday noon, we while away the time, 
And when I 
go, she whispers low, " Ever I'll be thine 1" 
Chorus as before. 
She looks so sweet, when dressed so neat, with her pretty 
auburn hair ; 
The time has come when we'll be one, our union true we'll 
share ; 
I'll marry her and settle down, with pretty black-eyed Kate, 
No more she'll say, " Come pass this way, 'till I 
meet you 
at the gate." 
O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by B. DAVIES, expressly for JENNIE HuGnEs. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isio, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence ot Erin's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, I'll spake of Dan 
O'Connell. 
Emmett, Moore and Grattan tor the services these have 
done. 
There's the " Dargle " and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone. 
THE WHIRLEY-GIG. 
':.ritten by HARRY ELTON. 
Sung by JOHN FIELDING. 
WHILE visiting some country friends, 
One day I 
did repair, 
To what was thought a 
great treat, 
I 
mean a 
country fair, 
A 
young lady I 
happened to meet, 
Her name I 
beliee ' twas Lib, 
She said she wiShed to take a 
ride 
Upon the whirley-gig. 
CHORUS. 
Round upon a 
whirley-gig, 
Such a 
queer sensation, you'll not feel anywhere, 
Round upon a 
whirley-gig, 
The strangest thing that's out, 
Is twisting, twirling round and round, 
Upon a 
whirley-gig. 
The fair was like all other fairs, 
With various stands and shows, 
And crowds of country people, 
All dressed in their Sunday clothes, 
We soon got mixed up with the crowd, 
And had to gouge our way, 
To where the swings and whirley gigs, 
Were all in full sway. 
Round upon, ite. 
01, 
The girl mounted on a 
lion, 
That was singularly tame, 
While I 
boldly bestrode a 
horse, 
That close behind her came; 
We soon got started, slow at first. 
I 
felt immensekoff, 
But as the pace increased, 
I 
soon wished myself off. 
Romid upon, A 
e. 
Now when the ride.was over, 
I 
reeled upon the ground, 
When Rose to my surprise declared, 
She'd have another round, 
But now I 
could not speak a 
word, 
For I 
felt so queer, 
Le ushed into a 
saloon, 
And found relief on lager beer. 
Round upon, Au..

GO FIGHT SITTING BULL.. 
Words and music by TIM Rooms, as sung by him with great 
success at SHELBY'S Adelphi, Buffalo. 
MY 
dacent acquaintances, I'm now going to tell 
Of a 
gang of young blackguards stands down on the street; 
The slang that they are using, I 
believe themselves choosing, 
A gang of worse boys you can't find in the State. 
The neighbors do tell me that my stepson, Phelix, 
Is the very worst one in the gang when he's full. 
I 
have told him to drop it, says 1,1e to me " cheese it! • 
Go out to the Black Hills and fight Sitting Bull." 
It was only last night that I 
went to a 
party 
With a 
friend named McGiuffin to Hibernia Hall. 
What was going on sure I 
can't well remember, 
But I 
think that they called it a 
massacred ball. 
Says a 
lady to me, " will you dance the Tra, la, la?" 
" 
Tra, la, loo," says I, 
why you talk like your full!" 
Says she, " sherry your nobbs and drive down to your partner, 
And go out to the Black Hills and fight Sitting Bull." 
A few months ago I 
went over to Long Branch 
To take care of some horses for Mike Muldoon's aunt. 
I 
went to the beach with a 
young man a 
bathing, 
Sure who did we see there but General Grant. 
With us he got into a 
great conversation, 
He talked of the times and said they were dull. 
Says he, " where will I 
go to when my time is over ?" 
Says I, " go to the divil and fight Sitting Bull!"

THE POOR OPPRESSED IN IRELAND. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE and FANNY W ENTWORTH With great 
success. 
Ant.—Slavery Days. 
FATHER. 
DEAR isle of fame and beauty, thy shores have long been trod 
With savage tyrants' footsteps! 
Oh, ' tis sad! 
Thy faithful sons, dear Erin, are banished from thy sod, 
Their homes destroyed, they are dispossessed of all I 
We leave the dear old cottage that once we called our own; 
The cursed intruders' minds are satisfied! 
They have caused the young to exile and the old to be forlorn 
On the roadside here we lay our heads to die! 
[Daughter discovers old man at work.] 
DAUGHTER. 
Oh, father, dearest father, you are growing old, I 
see, 
You cannot do that work there all alone, 
And when I 
marry Teddy, oh, father, he will be 
A 
great help on the farm and in our home. 
His heart is stout and bold, the cares of life will not wear 
A 
haggard look upon my darling Ted. 
Can I 
be his wife now, father ? for to me he is so fair; 
Your refusal, father dear, I 
almost dread! 
FATHER. 
Oh, North, with a 
blessing I 
hope the sunshine's rays 
May ever shine upon you and your Ted; 
I 
hope you'll thrive and prosper like the blooming flowers in 
May; 
You'll remember this, my blessing, when I'm dead. 
Go tell the news to Teddy, that your father gave consent, 
And tell him that he is free to name the day; 
But let him seek another land, for he cannot earn the rent! 
Sure, he'll find a 
home in dear America.

The '' ummer's sun was shining fair, 
As I

And eyes too blue to see ; 
The birds were singing sweeter 
Than they'd ever sang before, 
And echoing to the warblings of 
That sweet voice at the door. 
SPORE — Yes ! There's where she lives.

The idol of perfection ; I'm going to serenade her.

Fol do rol diddle dol, fol do rol day, 
I 
went into the kitchen and made it all right— 
Three pounds of fat bacon I 
put out of sight; 
Says she, Joe can do with a 
dumplin or two— 
Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do. 
Fol de rol, &e. 
I 
finished the dumplins and wanted to go, 
She looked in my face, I 
felt rather blue; 
Says she Joe, why don't you squeeze me, 
Like a

Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do. 
Fol de rol, &c. 
Now married we are, and happy we be— 
But we ain't got no babbies to bless her and me;

We might have a

LIFT UP A 
MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
WHAT legions of friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us, 
So cordial, good humored and gay. 
But oh if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man don't you see that he's down. 
CHORUS. 
Then let all your dealings be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do, 
Sickness and sorrow may yet come to you, 
So lift up a 
mait when he's down. 
What then if you had not a 
sorrow, 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wanted to borrow, 
You'd oblige and ne'er ask them to pay, 
But when if a 
friend you ne'er slighted, 
You wander about through the town, 
This friend becomes very near sighted, 
And don't seem to know you when down. 
Then let all, &e. 
Then give me the heart that forever, 
Is free from the worlds selfish rust, 
And the man whose high noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men 
om the dust, 
And when in adversity's ocean, 
A victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the man whose devotion, 
Will lift up this man when he's down. 
Then let all, Atc.

RIVAL JUNK MEN. 
Originally performed by SCANLAN & 
CRONIN, the most perfect 
Representatives of Irish Character now on the 
American Stage. 
Have ye's any °gild rags or ould bottles, my friends, 
That ye's want to sell ? 
I'm " Paddy Welsh." of the Fourth Ward, 
And of me ye've all heard tell. 
I'm known by every chick and child 
As a 
man of great exploit, 
And to be mayor or alderman, 
If I 
said the word I 
moight. 
I'm twenty long years in this land, 
For politicians T 
have no use. 
I 
neither ax nor borrow their aid, 
And as for me they can go to the deuce. 
As up the street I 
go each day, 
They know who's coming, well. 
With my bag on my back, I 
shout, 
Any ould rag: or ould bottles to sell. 
(dance) 
ENTER RIVAL. 
Good evening to ye's, one and all. 
I 
see ye're looking well. 
suppose ye all will be surprised 
At what I'm going to tell. 
I've been travelling about the Ward all day, 
Not a 
pound of rags can I 
buy, 
Because that blackguard, " Paddy Welsh." 
Has been there on the sly. 
But I'll take my oath that I'm a 
bloat. 
If I 
don't make him sick. 
The first time I 
clap my eyes on him 
I'll paralyze him with a 
brick; 
57 
I'll twist his nose till the blood it flows, 
And me he'll remember, well. 
To come no more in the Sixth Ward, hollering 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell 
BOTH. 
Now what's the use of all this fuss? 
Our reputation I'm sure we'd spoil 
To see us quarreling here like dogs, 
Two sons of the Emerald Isle; 
So let us shake hands and be good friends, 
This rivalry let us stop, and to bind the bargain 
Let us go and of whisky take a 
drop. 
But there's one thing we must bear in mind, 
That our rules are sobriety. 
Sure if they found out we drank rum 
We'd be kicked out of the Society. 
So say no more but on we'll go, 
Or some one they might tell; 
And we'll go about our business, hollering. [What 1] 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TO-NIGHT, 
JOHN ? 
Sung with great success by the Artist Comique, HAIRY MON-
T 
AGUE. 
Music of this, or any other of HARRY MONTAGUE'S songs can be 
obtnined from SPEAR & DEUNHOFF, 719 Broadway, N. Y. 
I've just got wed to a 
darling wife, 
We're happy as can be. 
There's only one thing causes strife, 
Of which we can't agree. 
For now and then, like the best of men, 
I 
go out in a 
jovial way, 
And as sure as fate if I 
come home late. 
My wife to me •C611 say: 
CHORUS. 
Where have you been to-night, John, 
Where have you been to-night; 
You're out so late, and n 
such a 
state; 
Where have you been to-night, John. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
go out for an hour or so, 
The time it slips by so fast, 
It's time to go before I 
know 
A 
jolly night has passed. 
Up-stairs•I creep; she's fast asleep, 
I 
think I 
hear her snore— 
What a 
sad mistake—she's wide awake, 
When she says to me once more— 
Where have you, etc. 
At one or two—or it may be three— 
I 
quit the festive scene. 
And then my wife will say to me, 
Now tell me where you've been. 
You're out so late—in such a 
state— 
You're not yourself, I 
vow. 
How strange you talk, how queer you walk; 
You really don't know how. 
Spoken.—And just as soon as I 
get into the bedroom, my 
wife said tome: " This is a 
nice time to be coming home, isn't 
it? 
You thought you'd leave your boots outside in the hall, 
and sneak in here and I 
wouldn't know what time you came 
home; but I'm not such a 
fool as I 
look, although goodness 
knows I 
was a 
fool when I 
married you; 
but there, John, 
I didn't want to fight with you or quarrel, so there's a 
good dear, hurry up and come to bed; and tell me darl-
bag— 
Where have you, etc.

The N. Y. Evening Mail writer 
"A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISEUCA'S, 98 Nair 
ta/ 
eau street called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommeag 
It to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when, wad 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the ttre 
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."

the N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We hae,e lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'ewenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recent-
men d 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers. '

Charlotte Temple.—To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures, 
sympathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving ' truth stranger than fiction." The poet's lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple; 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
this book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

znethod of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
be meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 'Want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
ledany young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qUestion. The lady is restrained. by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
