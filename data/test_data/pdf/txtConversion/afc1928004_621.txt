AN EVERY DAY OCCURRENCE. 
By D. F. MORETON, Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN, of Sheehan and Coyne, 
in their side-splitting sketch, " An Every Day Occurrence, or 
Who Owns the Alley ? " 
SINCE I 
moved to Grogan's Alley 
I 
am always in a 
mess; 
The gang kick off my liver pad, 
And the buttons of my vest. 
I'm tough, and try to stand it, 
But really it's no use; 
I 
must reside up town again ; 
I 
can't stand the gang's abuse. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
For the cops my head to smash 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
For my wife myself to thrash ; 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
To build a 
Frepch Flat on my head 
Faith ! only I 
am live and kicking, 
Long ago I 
would be dead. 
When I 
walk down through the alley, 
The gang call me a 
Mick; 
Here's my neighbor Mrs. Driscoll, 
Ton my sowl she makes me sick ! 
She's an arm like a 
derrick ; 
Her look would stop a 
train ; 
Her tongue is like an earthquake, 
And gives me hydrosterics on the brain. 
'Tis an every day occurrence, etc.

THE BUMMER'S LAMENT. 
Composed by D. F. MonEros, and delivered by PRESS ELDRIDGE. 
THERE came to the bar a 
whiskey-soaked snoozer, 
With eyes like a 
codfish and nose purple-red ; 
The boys on the street called him Jerry the Boozer, 
He worked a 
free lunch route, on which he was fed. 
He says to the barkeeper, " Now look it here, mister, 
Can't I 
have a 
glass of rum on my face ? " 
• 
But the barkeeper replied, "'Twoukl. be wasting good 
liquor ; 
You have more iu your nose than I've got in the place." 
He turned to a stranger, who a 
cocktail was drinking, 
Says he, " Please set them up once, I 
am terribly dry." 
The stranger said " Nixey !" and this bummer—faint-
hearted— 
Said, " I 
must have a 
booze, or I 
surely will die." 
He turned to the lunch, but the tripe had departed, 
The stale cheese had vanished, the bologna had fled, 
" 
Ah " says this bum, " I 
am near broken-hearted," 
And he chewed on the bones that was once a 
pig's head. 
Some kegs outside the door claimed his attention; 
He turned them up in hopes there was beer in them; 
But the Italians had been there, and I 
dare not now 
mention 
The oaths that he swore wen no beer he could get. 
Says he, " 0 
for a 
land full of mountains of sugar ! 
Where a 
stream of hot whiskey and rum would flow by ; 
What a 
paradise that would be for this bummer ! 
All Ed ask is one swim, and then I 
would die."

GRANDMOTHER'S BIG HEART. 
Am.—" 
Grandmother's Old Arm Chair," by Wm. CARROLL. 
MY 
grandmother she at the age of twenty-three 
Was found sitting on my grandfather's clock; 
Her hair was silvery red, and she never slept in bed, 
And done washing for the babies in our block. 
She never wore the pants, but was good to all the 
tramps, 
And, her heart is big as any paving stone. 
When she cashed in her checks they could not find her 
specs, 
And she left Tile her brother's old trombone. 
cnouus. 
How I 
hollered, how I 
swore— 
My last winter's ulster into rags I 
tore ; 
When the police put me in jail 
There was no one in the city who'd go my bail. 
My cousin who's away got a 
bale of salt-marsh hay, 
But he gave it to a 
man who is not born, 
And Poor old Uncle Dan received a 
Cincinnati ham, 
With a 
cross-graineci paralytic ear of corn ; 
And there was old Aunt Sallie who lives in our dark 
alley, 
She got a 
yard of second-handed lace, 
And then my brother Ed got a 
loaf of home-made bread, 
Who was never known to wash his dirty face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh such kicking, such a 
time, 
With my sister's husband singing " Baby mine :" 
Around his neck I'd like to tie a 
rock, 
And smash him in the necktie with my grand-
mother's sock.

OUR NATION'S HOPE. 
A 
national song composed by D. F. MonETox and sung with un-
bounded success by Miss MINNIE LEE. 
ON 
that day in July bright and clear was the sky; 
There was plenty and peace in our land; 
When 'twas flashed o'er the wires that Garfield was shot 
By a 
pistol in Guiteau's foul hand, 
We thought it a 
rumor, but, alas ! it proved true ; 
And people now mourn as they tell 
How Garfield, the man who for our country done right, 
By the hand of an assassin had fell. 
CHORUS. 
We thought it a 
rumor, but, alas ! it proved true, 
But people now mourn for the fate 
Of Garfield, the bold pilot who safely would steer 
Through the tempest our good Ship of State. 
The crime was a 
strange one—Garfield done no wrong 
To the man who attempted his life; 
He was not like Lincoln, the martyr, shot down 
In the fierce hate of. sectional strife. 
Like Honest Old Abe, he bore malice to none, 
And people now mourn as they tell 
How Garfield, the man who for our country done right, 
While on post and on duty he fell.. 
We thought it a 
rumor, etc. 
Let him who committed this cowardly deed 
To justice be brought in quick time ; 
Guiteau may be crazy, but he showed by his acts 
'Twas malice that caused this foul crime. 
Our loved chief's life was in danger, but we all hope that 
120\V 
The clouds that hung o'er us are passed ; 
Though Garfield now is so helpless and weak, 
He will fully recover at last. 
We thought it a 
rumor, etc.

OWEN SLATTERY. 
Written by DAVID DILLON, and sung with great success by Jorm Sums 
mils-, 
in the greatest of all Irish sketches, " The Ash Box Inspector." 
Mr name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife, I 
wish she was dead ; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughter Kate Ann, 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
When asked his name, he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
Me fine laddie buck, says I, march out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear. 
He made a 
rush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull_ 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and a 
flannel-mouth Mick. 
Tearanouns," says I, " Ellen, don't give me a 
guy." 
I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegall, 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, and a 
scented bouquet 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It was only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

DON'T CRUSH THE POOR PEOPLE, 
BUT GIVE 
THEM A SHOW. 
W ritten by EDWARD Ausrm 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with tremendous applause. 
IN 
the great game of life 
Where all play for gold, 
We know there are many 
Whom no trumps can hold; 
For the goddess of fortune, 
Of men makes a 
choice, 
And all whom she forms, 
Have cause to rejoice. 
To those fortunate men, 
A 
word I'll now say, 
Pleading for those whom 
Life's poor cards must play. 
With gold as a 
weapon, 
Strike no cruel blow, 
To crush the poor people, 
But give them a 
show. 
CHORUS. 
Then give them a 
helping hand 
Once and a 
while, 
,Remember Dame Fortune 
On them does not smile; 
Deal them out kind words 
Instead of a 
blow; 
Don't crush the poor people, 
But give them a 
show.

DON'T citusn THE POOR PEOPLE BUT GIVE 
THEM A SHOW.—Concluded. 
How often the rich man, 
When seated at ease 
Does think of the poverty 
Of all such as these. 
Why is it, I 
ask, 
He will close tight his purse ? 
Instead of a 
blessing, - 
He will give him a 
curse! 
His gold keeps him safe 
From starvatiorK z 
13.ame ; 
Yet he thinks those who have none' 
Are surely to blame. 
But I 
tell you the poor man 
Feels misfortune's blow. 
Don't add to his sufferings, 
But give him a 
show. 
Then give them, eta. 
Just think of some cold night 
When angry winds roar 
And clamors so loudly 
At every one's door. 
When the white- drifted snow 
Lies heaped on the street ; 
Swept here and there 
By the cold, blinding sleet; 
Can the rich in their parlors 
Forget those who swarm 
Around dying embers, 
Their chilled limbs to warm 2 
Let us pray that some power 
Will teach them to throw 
Some aid to the poor men, 
And give them a 
show. 
Then give them, eto.

I'M THE MAN WHO DOWNED MULDOON. 
Written by D. F. 
MORETON and sung with great success by SHEERAN 
and COYNE. 
STANDING here before you 
Is a 
man of great renown; 
I'm known as McCool, the wrastler, 
'Mong the tuffs of New York town. 
Ye talk about Collar and Elbow, 
And the Greeco-Roman 
But the County Kerry triplock 
Is the one that bates them all. 
I 
learned it in the English army, 
Where I 
fought as a 
French dragoon ; 
With the Kerry hoult and Roscommon boult. 
I 
quickly downed Muldoon. 
crtonts. 
I'm the man that downed Muldoon, ye see, 
I'm the man that downed Muuldoon, 
Because too soon, ye see, because he was too soon. 
With the Kerry hoult and the Derry boult 
I 
quickly downed Muldoon. 
The laddie bricks on the corner 
Of me are very shy; 
They never talk of wrestling 
When they know MeCool is by. 
With this hoult I 
could down a 
giant, 
I 
could if he was twice as tall, 
And if I 
only got a 
waist hoult, 
I 
could flure the city hall. 
Next week I 
am going to wrastle 
With the man up in the moon, 
And 
show him the County Kerry triplock, 
With which I 
downed Muldoon. 
I'm the man, etc. 
OUR SON JOHN . 
Written by C. H. DOCKSTADER, for SITEEFIAN and Jo. 
On we live about a 
mile from here, 
And as we came down the street, 
Not thinking any harm at all, 
Some blackguards we did meet. 
They said, just pipe thim two auld Tads, 
And stag that dizzy walk— 
Do you's think that they are Turks or what, 
Thim two ould foolish gawks ? 
Ah, thin, ain't we fools to stand such trash, 
Our hearts are almost broke; 
They called our son a 
kid last night— 
' Do they take us for two goats ? 
And our son John do play such pranks, 
That we don't know what to do. 
HE.—Shure he stuffed my pipe with gunpowder, 
SHE. — And he filled my hair wid glue. 
took my clothes last Thursday night, 
BOTH.—And he hid them in the shed. 
Shure we could not find thim for a 
week,

had to lay in bed.

WHAT I'D DO WHEN PRESIDENT. 
An original stump speech composed for the great Irish Cartoonist 
and Comedian, PAT REILLY, by D. 
F. 
MORETON. 
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES :—I 
say gentlemen before fhb 
ladies, because I 
find in the case of a 
good-looking man, 
like myself, the ladies are after the gentlemen. 
I 
intend 
to inform ye how near I 
came to being President of the 
United States. 
I 
would be President of this land of the free and home 
of the working slave but for two things :—one was, I 
went to Cincinnati and I 
did not get the nomination ; 
the other reason was, I 
wouldn't have been elected if I 
did. 
But I'm President in my mind, anyhow, and I'll tell 
ye what I'd do. 
In the first place I'd make my cabinet ; 
and I'll tell ye who I'd put in it: 
I'd make Henry Ward 
Beecher Secretary of the Interior. 
He could preach to 
the Indians and make love to the squaws. 
I'd make Denis Kearney Secretary of War; and by all 
the goats in Ireland—and that's a 
heavy oath—we'd al-
ways have war. 
I'd make Courtney, the oarsman, Secretary of the 
Navy; he knows more about rotten boats than any man 
in America. 
I'd make Bob Ingersoll Chaplain of the Senate, and 
we'd have no more hell. 
I'd build a 
railroad to Ireland, so the Irish could walk 
over instead of swimming across. 
I'd run steamboats to the comet and horse cars to the 
stars. 
I'd give every good-looking woman a 
vote. 
I'd annex New Jersey to the United States. 
And last, but not least, I'd make Saint Patrick's day 
come in summer time, when it couldn't snow and 
wouldn't rain, because I 
never paraded a 
day yet that 
regalia didn't get wet.

'PIS LUCKY SOMETIMES TO BE LATE. 
Written and sung by Joirs-Ny PATTERSON. 
SOME people are oft in a 
hurry, 
Without knowing what they're going to do, 
And oft, through their bristle and flurry, 
Their business transactions they rue; 
My advice is, take things nice and easy, 
Don't let excitement baffle your fate, 
Many people may think that I'm crazy 
When I 
say it's lucky at times to be late. 
CHORUS. 
Slow and sure is my motto through life, boys, 
Though some don't approve of my gait, 
But you'll find what I 
say is quite right, boys, 
'Tis lucky sometimes to be late. 
Now I 
once on a 
journey was going, 
By rail, a 
number of miles, 
But from morning till night there's no knowing 
What misfortune may add to man's trials; 
I 
was late, the train had a 
collision, 
Oh, sad was the passengers' fate, 
Now see, by fortune's bright vision, 
'Twas lucky that time I 
was late. 
Slow and sure, eta. 
Once I 
was going to be married, 
But the bride took another ill spite, 
And glad I 
am now that I 
tarried, 
For she walloped him that very night ; 
And if he dare say that he's master 
She tears all the hair off his pate ; 
I'd have had her, but he was much faster— 
I 
missed her, and glad I 
was late. 
Slow and sure, etc. 
Another night, when I 
knocked at my lodgings, 
From the window a 
voice sai4 " Ilegone ;" 
It was my landlord, disagreeable ould Hodgins, 
Who says, " I 
won't let you in after one ;" 
I 
turned and walked to the circus, 
And in the stables I 
slept safe and sound; 
In the morn, when I 
called at my lodgings, 
I 
found the houan burned to the ground. 
Slow and sure, etc 
ST. 
PATRICK'S DAY PARADE. 
Written expressly for SHEEHAN and JONES, by 
.BEN H. Bro. 
You may ,talk about your grand parades. 
Or anything so gay ; 
But we're raising a 
company, 
For next St. Patrick's day. 
With the colors of ould Ireland, 
We'll make the people glad; 
'Twill be the finest show, my boys, 
That New York ever had. 
With regalias looking bright, 
And umbrellas in hand, 
We'll march down to Hibernia hall, 
And there we'll make our stand. 
With the shamrock in our hats, 
And biled shirts looking fine, 
With an Irish band in front of us, 
We then will fall in line. 
We do honor to St. Patrick, 
Ould Ireland's greatest saint; 
Be gob, whin we turn out, my boys, 
We make the ladies faint. 
With all the Father Matthew clubs, 
To fall with us in line, 
And noble band of Hibernians,-
I 
tell you 'twill be fine. 
With regalia% etc. 
We'll have the G9th with us, 
Whose show would break your heart; 
We'll march the city through and through, 
When once we make a 
start. 
And arm-in-arm together, 
The best of friends we'll be, 
From the laborer on the pipes above, 
To the mayor of our city. 
With ,egalias, et-
ST. 
PATRICE'S DAY PARADE .—Conoluded. 
So now, brave boys, we must off, 
We can no longer stay, 
And if we think we pleased you, 
We'll call another day. 
Your kind applause we hope you'll grant, 
To do our best we've tried, 
So don't forget us Irish boys, 
That stand here side by side. 
With regaliaa, etc. 
THE RAMBLING PAIR. 
Sang by SHEEHAN and JONES. 
WE'llE an Irish couple from county Galway, 
So pay attention to what we say; 
We left our parents and all relations, 
And sailed off to America. 
We'll describe our journey throughout the country, 
For with health and strength I'm sure we're blest, 
.We packed our trunks, and off we started; 
We were determined to go West. 
We travelled far, on boats and cars, 
We've had our share of trials and care; 
So we'll have you know, before we go, 
That we are known as the Rambling Pair. 
From New York unto Nebraska, 
You know that is a 
great many miles ; 
We were in California and Alaska 
As for money we have piles ; 
To Missouri and Iowa, 
To the wilds of Texas we went there, 
We've travelled east, north, west and south, 
And now we're known as the Rambling Pair. 
We travelled far, etc.,

THE 'LONGSHOREMEN. 
Words by P. 
J. 
DOWNEY. 
Sung by the SITRPHAN BROTHERS. 
AIR.—" State of CinCinnati." 
On, here we are two 'longshoremen, 
Of work we're not afraid, 
We work gay and free on ships from the sea, 
Sometimes we are delayed; 
We both of us have families, 
And then we have to raise, 
Ye men of talk, come clear the walk, 
It's work we want, not praise. 
CHORUS. 
Dock yard clerks we claim to be. 
The cotton hook is our pen, 
When we turn out the people shout: 
" 
Three cheers for the 'longshoremen." 
Our enemies, Italians, 
They work for lower pay, 
We're sure the bosses lose on them, 
They're only in the way. 
But take the men from Erin's isle, 
And give them a 
decent pay, 
You'll not go far, you'll find they are 
The men to clear the way. - 
Dock yard clerks, etc. 
We all left the shore and went to the war, 
And we're ready to do so again. 
With heart and hand we'll fight while we stand, 
We're not afraid of pain ; 
So now we'll have to leave you all, 
At us you all may smile, 
We are nothing more than 'longshoremen, 
All the way from Erin's isle. 
Dock yard clerks, etc. 
THE LITTLE LONELY ORPHAN CHILD. 
,SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
MR. HELPER.—An 
old man. 
LULU. — The orphan child. 
Scene, —A 
street, sncruc. &c. 
(The symphony of song is played.) 
Enter MR. HELPER. [ 1?.] 
MR. H.—A wild, bitter night. 
God help any poor houseless 
wretch who has to endure this pitiless blast! I 
should not have 
ventured out, but there is a 
sick friend of mine in the next 
street, and I 
must go to lend hint a 
helping hand. 
Do all the 
good you can, is my motto: No matter what may be the incon-
veniences. 
Oh ! 
this wind goes through one, like an arrow. 
The streets are all deserted. 
So much the better for poor suf-
fering humanity. 
Exit 31E. HELPER. [ L. ] 
Enter LULU, Almost exhausted. [ 
I 
LULU.-011, such a 
cold, lonely night. 
I 
have wandered up 
and down, looking for some place of shelter; but the snow has 
driven me front every place. Nobody pities or helps me. Every-
one passes the orphan girl by with a 
sneer, and refuses to listen 
to her prayers for help. 
Even the sky frowns on me, to-night. 
I 
used to look up at the stars, and think I 
saw my angel mother 
smiling upon her child, and guiding her upwards to her heaven-
ly home! All is gloom to-night. `Oh, mother dear, although I 
may not seem to see thy face, yet I 
know thou art watching 
over thy poor child, from our Father's mansion, in the golden 
streets above! 
(Sings the song. 
After each verse, an invisible chorus sings 
the refrain,—" Poor little lonely orphan child." &c.

BABY'S GOT A CRAMP. 
A 
parody by D. 
F. 
MORETON, sung by the great Ethiopian burlesque 
singer, PAUL DRE$SER. 
I'M the father of a 
cross-eyed kid, 
Who nearly drives me wild; 
His mother spanks the rod and spares the kid, 
And the baby now is spiled. 
He can squall like fifty torn cats; 
You can hear him in the sky; 
And every night when I 
come home 
My- 
wife will loudly cry: 
CHORUS. 
Paul, dear ! Paul, dear ! just think, the little scamp, 
Paul, dear! 
Paul, dear! he chewed the kitchen 
lamp! 
Don't fool 'round in that strange manner, 
Do skin after Doctor Tanner ; 
Get the stomach-pump from Hanner, 
Baby's got a 
cramp. 
On the kitchen stove last Sunday 
This kid did take a 
seat ; 
His underclothes were blistered 
By the very torrid heat. 
He keeps bawling and a 
squalling2 
And at night when I 
should -doze, 
My darling wife will wake me up 
To wipe the baby's nose. 
Paul, dear! Paul, etc. 
Dear Paul ! dear Paul ! my wifey will begin; 
Dear Paul! dear Paul ! to sleep now is a 
sin 
Get the goose grease in the castor; 
Run around a 
little faster ; 
Please do get a 
mustard plaster, 
And wipe off the baby's chin. 
Paul, dear ! Paul, etc.

1, YOU'RE GIVING US TAFFY. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and sung by J. 
CONROY. 
I'M a 
naturalized citizen of this great land, 
And I'm proud of the honor, I'm sure; 
In politics I'm quite a 
prominent man, 
And respected by rich and by poor. 
Now, I 
try to be civil to every one, 
But they've not the same manners toward me, 
For it's up and down as I'm strolling along 
These words they will say unto me : 
CHORUS. 
z‘ How are you, Macduff ? 
Don't you think you look 
tough ?" 
Expressions like these make me wrathy, 
And whenever I 
say, " Lave off with your play." 
They say, " Duffy, you're giving us taffy." 
They'll tell me to go put my feet in a 
frame, 
And go chase myself round the square; 
And they say that if Barnum knew I 
was alive 
He'd have me caged up with the bear. 
Now, I 
know I'm not handsome, but this much rre. sure— 
To do right I 
always did try, 
And the next man that tells me to sit down on myself 
I'll put a 
lump over his eye. 
How are you. etc. 
They say my feet occupy the whole street, 
With my bunions the people can't pass, 
And say that my face would stop the street care, 
And my ears just look like a 
jackass; 
But let them all talk until they are sick ; 
They're jealous because they're not me. 
I'm a 
sound Irishman, and that they'll find out, 
And they'll never find taffy in me. 
flow are you, etc.

I WANDERED down the other day, 
Along the river strand, 
And there I 
met the pretty maid 
That keeps the peanut stand ; 
I 
ogled her, she ogled me, 
She looked so very grand, 
None can surpass the blooming lass 
That keeps the peanut stand, Oh ! 
SPORTIN. — You just ought to have seen her. 
CHORUS. 
She dress'd so neat, she looked so sweet, 
I 
couldn't hardly stand, 
My heart it palpitated so 
It shook the peanut stand. 
Her hair was frizzled o'er her brow, 
Her eyes were slightly cross'd, 
Her face was thickly freckled o'er 
Like mildew mixed with frost ; 
Her gown of richest calico 
Hung low upon her neck, 
And sundry graces round her shed, 
With spots of grease bedecked. 
She dress'd so neat, etc. 
I 
mosied up, " how do you do, 
My pretty lass, I 
pray ?" 
" 
I'm hunkadora, how are you ? 
Come buy Pome nuts to-day."

THE GIRL THAT KEEPS THE 
STAND.—Concluded, 
Said I, " I'll take a half a 
pint 
If you will sell 'em low, 
And throw me in a 
kiss to boot." 
Said she, " go long, old blow." 
She dress'd so neat, etc. 
I 
asked her if she'd like to have 
A 
man of my estate, 
She munched a 
handful of peanuts, 
And said " you've come too late ; 
I 
am the organ grinder's girl 
And him I 
mean to wed, 
Do you suppose I'd give him up 
4' 
And marry you instead ?" 
She dress'd so neat, etc. 
Oh ! how I 
love that peanut girl, 
No one can ever know, 
I 
wish that organ grinder man 
Was grinding down below! 
And now a 
broken-hearted man 
I 
wander through the laud, 
My soul a 
bustin' for the gal 
What keeps the peanut stand. 
She dress'd so neat, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
If I 
could play the organ well 
I'd go to grinding too, 
And I 
would cut as big a 
swell 
As other grinders do; 
But as I 
didn't go to war 
And lose a 
leg or hand, 
I've lost for aye my pretty lass 
That keeps the peanut stand. 
She dress'd so neat, etc.

CONUNDRUM SONG. 
Written and composed by SAM W ESTON, and sung by him only with great 
success. 
THE song which I 
am about to sing, 
Is a 
very funny one; 
I 
am going to crack some funny jokes, 
And tell some conundrums. 
Why are the police of New York 
Like a 
rainbow in the sky ? 
Because they never do show up, 
Until the storms pass by. 
I 
am going to tell a 
riddle now, 
Try and guess if you can ; 
Why are the stars in our American flag 
Like the stars in bright heaven ? 
The answer is an easy one, 
But to you queer may sound, 
There is no power on earth to-day 
To pull our bright stars down. 
Now car conductors do beware, 
If there's any here to-night, 
I 
think they are the biggest beats, 
Although they might be right. 
They sometimes punch you for five cents, 
And still they call it fare ; 
They're sure to give their boss the slip, 
And still they call it square.

CONUNDRUM SONG .—Concluded. 
But now I 
am going to end my song, 
And crack a 
naughtier joke; 
Who was the first man in the world 
That took a 
cab or coach ? 
It was General George Washington, 
Which you all can plainly see, 
It was two hundred years ago, 
He took a 
hack at a 
tree. 
THE LITTLE BABE WAS SAVED. 
Words by SAM W ESTON. 
Music by MMUS W ESTON. 
IT'S of a 
dark and cold wintry night, 
A 
sad tale I 
will tell; 
Of a 
mother and her little child, 
The night, I 
remember well. 
The wind did roar like the ocean wave, 
And the snow was falling fast, 
She buried her child into her arms, 
And prayed for her last. 
She strove with all her might and soul, 
Her little babe to save; 
To have her life and sorrows told, 
When she was in her grave. 
She suffered with the cold and hunger, 
Until her strength did fail, 
She 1

But her little babe was saved.

No sweeter one was ever heard.;

Oft it made this heart of mine rejoice; 
Those happy days fore'er have gone, 
Never more I'll hear her voice.

Only to hear her voice once more, 
Oft I 
heard it in happy days of yore, 
'Twould make this heart of mine rejoice, 
Only to hear her voice. - 
In dreams I 
hear her voice so soft, 
What boundless joy it brings to me! 
Why did. my hopes so soon decay, 
And my only treasure from me flee. 
Could not my lot in life have easier been, 
Why was she so soon the angels' choice ? 
Alas ! from earth her spirit's flown, 
Never more I'll hear her voice, 
Only to hear her voice, ete.

THE OLD-FASHIONED CRADLE. 
Published by BALMER and WEuxit, St. Louis, Mo. 
Written and sung by FRANK DUMONT. 
OH 
! 
the old broken crib's laid aside in a 
room 
Where the dust almost hides it from view; 
Oh ! ' tis many years ago since it saw the light of day; 
And the old-fashioned cradle then was new. 
Little baby heads have rested slumb'ring in this little bed 
While my mother sang and moved it to and fro; 
And my sisters and my brothers, whom I 
ne'er shall see 
again, 
Were rocked in this old cradle years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Rock ! rock ! rock ! mother's voice I 
hear 
Singing baby songs so sweet and low; 
Her loving form I 
see, watching while the baby sleeps. 
And she rocks this little cradle to and fro. 
Oh! I 
love the broken crib for the sake of other days, 
For the sake of my mother gone above; 
Who kissed ray eyelids down, aud she taught my little 
pray'r, 
'Twas the kiss of my mother's boundless love. 
She often watched beside it to protect us from all harm, 
And with anxious care each motion seemed to be; 
Oh! ' tis sacred for the mem'ries that it brings my lonely 
heart, 
The old-fashioned cradle's dear to me. 
Rock ! rock ! rock! eta. 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN. 
Written and Sung by TONT PASTOR. 
Air:—" You May Call Me a 
Quiz." 
ru take this occasion to give you advice, 
It's meant in good part, so receive it quite nice. 
Don't ever be urged to take out a 
kink, 
When you know you don't want it, by taking a 
drink. 
I'll tell you the reason, and this is the why, 
And the truth, if you're smart, you cannot deny, 
There's no luck in a 
drink, I 
tell you again, 
No luck with anything square on the brain. 
Sifeken.—Yes, what's the use of punishing one's bowels to 
accommodate a 
friend, and keep a 
shingle on some bum-
tier's house? Whisky on the brain is a 
bad complaint, and 
so is tnis fashion of 
don't spend all your money in one 
house," and rushing around from gin-mill to gin-mill for 
the sake of a 
familiar nod from a 
bar-keeper, for the pur-
pose of making folks think you're somebody. 
This fancy, 
of a 
man's trying to prove he ain't a 
sardine, always proves 
the lad only lacks the pickle to make one. 
These are the 
chaps who chuck their money over the bar as fast as they 
get it, and generally wind up as free-lunch fiends. 
No, no, 
boys ! keep your heads clear, and, above all things, never 
get rum on tne brain. 
There's more I 
will tell you, and I 
want you to hear, 
And the truth, laddie bucks, 3 
ou'll see will appear, 
Don't spend all you're time at poker and bluff; 
Or keno, or faro, or prize- candy stuff. 
Your friends and yourself will serve you the best turn, 
By keeping the money whatever you earn ; 
Don't spend it in hair-grease, or la-da-de-da's, 
Or taking out lady-loves with their maamas. 
Spoken.—Yes, these are some of the things which young 
men should avoid ; a 
little game occasionally, however 
harmless, is a 
bad thing to get on the brain. 
In most of 
these games the more you lay down the less you take up; 
[1] 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN.--"CoNcLuDED 
29 
And as to making anything out of a 
prize-candy package, 
why, you might as well lay a 
ten-cent stamp on the side-
walk, and wait for some one to come along and cover it, 
with as good a 
show as you have in getting anything out 
of a 
prize-candy package. 
No, no, save your money; buy 
a 
house, put a 
Bowery girl in it, and set her to work mak-
ing a 
uniform for the expected little la-de-da. 
There's another thing, laddies, on free-love don't bet, 
Against Woman's Rights just make a 
dead set, 
And don't get politics or office on the brain, 
But stick to square labor, and honor you'll gain. 
Be honest, he brave, act square with a 
friend, 
Be true to :tour country, and money don't lend, ; 
Your words keep together, stay shady and sane, 
And nothing whatever gets on to the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, above all things. put your foot down on. 
these free-love doctrines; give the coming generation the 
same chance to know their daddies that you have had ; 
give a 
woman the right to do anything but make a 
darned 
fbol of themselves. 
Don't it sound nice for an old maid of 
sixty to go upon the public platform and cry out against 
these horrid, horrid men ; and ain't they high old subjects 
that lecture on the manner of bringing up babies without 
nursing. 
And, above all 
things, don't spend your life 
loafing around, waiting for a 
change of administration, or 
something to turn lip. 
Get knowledge, but nothing else 
on the brain, and you'll be hunkie, and that's where the 
cluck swims. 
You may call me a 
quiz, you may call me a 
qui, 
But these are the things that are queer to ; he eye, 
And 111 tell you in earnest, and tell you again, 
Never get anything square on the brain, 
But keep a 
stray oar, whatever you do, 
With freedom to paddle you own canoe, 
As there's nothing so fatal, I 
tell you again, 
As getting any one thing square on the brain.

M AMA'S the pride of the family, 
Her age now is just seventeen, 
Her manner is graceful and winning, 
She's as pretty as ever was seen. 
She waits on a 
fancy goods counter, 
'Tis there all her failing began, 
And of late she has made the acquaintance 
Of an elegant stylish young man. 
CHORUS. 
His name is Josiah, 
He's after Maria, 
To charm her he tries all he can; 
He's dressed with great care 
And has nice curly hair, 
Such a 
swell is Maria's young man. 
He takes her out walking on Sunday, 
He wears a 
bouquet in his breast, 
He carries a 
cane in his lingers 
And a 
heavy brass chain in his vest. 
He walks arm in arm with Maria, 
While he carries her book and fan, 
And the poor girl with love's going crazy 
Since she met with this fancy young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
He says that his parents are wealthy, 
With mansions in country and town, 
Maria believes all he tells her 
thinks him a 
gent of renown ; 
But oh ! he's an awful deceiver, 
He lives on a 
very bad plan, 
And when she finds out she'll be sorry 
That she met with this charming young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
Now I 
would advise all young ladies 
Of high-notioned swells to beware, 
They'll do for a 
dance in the parlor, 
Or a 
stroll in the mid-summer air ; 
They keep as their motto forever: 
Do nothing, but get all you can; 
They think the world owes them a 
living, 
Just the same as Maria's young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc.

IIISfl SWELL SONG. 
By Jortx KEnNzI.L. 
I 
km a 
sporting Irishman, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm as happy as a 
little bird, 
Or a 
frog upon a 
tree; 
I 
dress in the Latest style of course, 
And my manners always tell, 
I'm --vhat you'd call a 
gallus Mick, 
Or a 
regular Irish swell. 
CHORUS. 
Theodore McCarthy, that's my name, 
Billiards and croquet, that's my game, 
With a 
rosebud on my coat, 
And dashing style as well; 
I'm what ye call a 
gallus Mick, 
Or a 
regular Irish swell. 
I 
drive a 
first-class trotter, 
And he is number one, 
And when there's a 
party in my ward, 
I'm always in for fun ; 
I 
live upon canary birds, 
And never eat kidney stew, 
My income is one dollar a 
day, 
On my soul—the sole of my shoe. 
Theodore McCarthy, eic.

THERE is a 
lad lives upon our floor, 
He sings a 
song called the Hallway Door ; 
He can beat Levy's Cornet; or Gilmore's Band, 
When he's singing The Sheeneys in the Saud ; 
With my daughter Mary he cuts a 
dash, 
She told me last night he was her " mash 
She says to him, Tommy, you son of a 
gun, 
Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some fun. 
Last Sunday when I 
came from mass, 
He asked me over to have a 
glass; 
Says I, I'll take a 
drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again. 
I 
sang a 
song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the tallier, 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fun. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
Greeco-Roman fall. 
If he comes to the house next Sunday night 
I 
will fire him down a 
couple of flight, 
Aud. get the police to give him a 
run, 
For setting me drunk to have some fun.

No'r long ago while walking out 
Along the Avenue, 
I 
tumbled on a 
big surprise, 
It struck me as quite new. 
The boys and girls were in their glee 
It was about midday, 
I 
thought it shockingly absurd, 
Whene'er I 
heard them say : 
CHORUS. 
Good evening, this evening. 
Are you going to the ball ? 
Not this evening, good evening, 
Good evening, one and all. 
Fine evening, this evening, 
This evening's very warm, 
Good evening, this evening, 
Good evening, take my arm. 
While wondering and pondering 
Just what it all could mean, 
I 
chanced to look around and spy 
The sweetest little queen. 
She looked so real bewitching sweet 
I 
sighed and said, oh dear, 
She sailed up, seized me by the nose 
And whispered in my ear : 
Good evening, ctc. 
We strolled along, both side by side, 
She said I 
was her mash, 
Then dragged me in a 
restaurant 
And ordered up some hash. 
She must have fasted forty days, 
I'm sure she ate her fill, 
She sweetly smiled, I 
was beguiled 
And settled up the bill. 
Good evening, etc.

Copyright, 1879, by W. F. SHAW. 
THE afternoon was waning, 
The summer sky was bright, 
The promenade was crowded, 
It was a 
glowing sight ; 
The pretty girls were out in style, 
And, as I 
pass'd them by, 
Each charming creature seemed inclined 
For flirting on the sly. 
CHORUS. 
Flirting on the sly, 
It was charming, 
It was charming, 
To stroll along the thoroughfare, 
And look with roguish eye, 
Flirting on the sly ! 
So entrancing, 
While you're glancing! 
With a 
dashing belle 
In love I 
fell 
While flirting on the sly. 
One girl drew my attention, 
A 
beautiful brunette, 
As graceful as a 
fairy, 
Her smile I 
can't forget. 
I 
sought an interview with her 
And this was her reply, 
You'll always find me ready, sir, 
For flirting on the sly. 
Flirting on the sly, etc. 
She lives with her dear parents, 
On her I 
often call, 
We languish at the opera 
And caper at the ball. 
The wedding day is settled now, 
It's coming by-and-by, 
No wonder that I 
sing the praise 
Of flirting on the sly. 
Flirting on the sly, etc.

M IKE O'BRIEN was a 
politician, 
He always dressed in solid style, 
His ancestors they were patricians 
In the dear old Enfrald isle. 
Last November he was elected 
For an alderman to be, 
Walhalla Hall he then selected, 
And gave the boys a 
grand soiree. 
CHOP.US. 
There was lots of fun for ev'ry one, 
The boys their legs did shake ; 
McGuinness sure, was on the flure, 
In waltzing, he " takes the cake." 
Their hoofs they slung, and songs they sung, 
The girls were gay and free. 
I 
danced all night till broad day-light, 
At O'Brien's grand soiree. 
Felix NcGluff and darling Daisy 
Were called upon to lead the dance; 
They showed such style it set them crazy, 
As round the room they did advance. 
Then the fun commenced in earnest, 
Hands all around,—all forward four, 
The room it got as hot as a 
furnace, 
While the dancers shook the floor. 
There was lots, etc. 
Pat O'Neil he did get excited 
When Malone made a 
little too free 
With the girl to whom he was plighted, 
And soon there was a 
great melee ; 
The crowd began to fight and scramble, 
The women all commenced to flee, 
They brought me home in several sections 
From O'Brien's grand soiree. 
There was lots, etc.

THE art of love-making is hard to unfold, 
It's something you can't well explain ; 
Sometimes you are fervent, sometimes you are cold, 
'Tis a 
mixture of pleasure and pain. 
I've lately been caught in that dangerous net 
By a 
creature so charming and fair, 
She has me enchanted, you know how it is, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
CHORUS. 
I 
guess you have all been there, 
I 
guess you have all been there ; 
You know, I 
am sure, what lovers endure, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
take her out walking beneath the bright moon, 
And whisper the old loving tale ; 
The sound of her voice drives away all my gloom, 
We wander by hillside and vale, 
Thro' meadows and groves, like two little doves, 
We ramble it matters not where ; 
I 
can't sleep at night, and its killing me quite, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
Her father is wealthy and very high-toned, 
Of his beautiful daughter he's proud ; 
It's already planned that I'll ask for her hand, 
But will my request be allowed ? 
I'm afraid he'll get angry and show me the door, 
And make my love melt into air ; 
Then what shall I 
do ? now my friends I 
ask you, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
I'll keep up my courage and to her be true, 
Although the old gent may oppose ; 
I'll wait at the gate for my sweet little Kate, 
Till time all his hate overthrows ; 
I'll press her soft hand and I'll call her my own, 
While together a 
sweet kiss we share, 
And before I 
go 'way—but what more need I 
say ? 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
SHE'S GONE TO THE OPERI-A. 
Written by C. R. 
DOCESTADEH, for SHEEIIA.N and IONE& 
I 
AM a 
man that's great and grand, 
As any in the laud; 
But then I 
have had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I 
cannot stand. 
There's Margaret Jane, my oldest girl, 
She lately ran away, 
She's gone to sing wid Brign.olia, 
She's the queen of the open-a. 
She can sing in the key of 43, 
She's a 
voice like a 
young bluejay ; 
She's great and grand as any in the land— 
Now she's gone to the open-a. 
Oh, I 
thought to take her back with me, 
To the spot where I 
was born ; 
For to wed a 
prince or an Irish duke, 
But she laughed at me with scorn. 
She calls me old Culley, go stab his nibs, 
Tells me go hire a 
dray ; 
Pull down me chin, wipe off me vest, 
And come to the operi-a. 
She can sing, etc.

were a 
married man, 
My house all full of glee ; 
A 
smiling partner by my side, 
And children round my knee. 
The cause why I'm a 
bachelor 
Not hard it is to find ; 
The fact is, that I 
really can't, 
I

CHORUS. 
The cause why I'm a

Not hard it is to find, 
The fact is that I 
really can't, 
I 
can't make up my mind. 
There's Juliana Lilywhite, 
I 
know that she would drop 
Into my loving arms, if I 
Would but the question pop ; 
With Carry Cowslip, too, I 
should 
No difficulty find, 
She would not hesitate, but I, 
I 
can't make up my mind! 
The cause why, etc. 
There's Angelina Marigold 
Who would with me slope, 
If to her window I 
would fix 
A 
ladder made of rope ! 
She's lovely and she's beautiful, 
Her purse is richly lined, 
And she'd have me in spite of " pa," but I, 
I 
can't make up my mind. 
The cause why, etc. 
How, when I 
walk along the street, 
Girl's roguish looks I 
catch, 
As with a 
sneer they say " There goes 
A 
rusty, fusty bach 1" 
Well, I'll resolve this very day 
Some sort of wife to find ; 
I'll wed, I 
think I 
will. 0

O'REILLY'S RAFFLE. 
Words by

Sung with great success by tIle 
PEASLEYS. 
'sell you of a 
jolly time 
We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, some were singing, 
Others making lots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar, 
We took a 
drink with Paddy O'Mar, 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
He got up and gave a 
toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty. 
Michael Dolan, Teddy Regan, 
Danced the dust out of the floor. 
Here's to all the pritty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys, 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dance& 
From the break-down to the lancers, 
Cracking jokes and telling stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Some were sleeping, some were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Then the ruction soon began, 
'Twas woman to woman, and man to man, 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking ofr their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a- squealing, 
The big blaguards they had no feeling, 
At it right and left they went, 
And busted O'Reilly's raffle.

WALTZING TO THE BAR. 
Written and sung by J. H. 
CONROY. 
AIR.—" 
Bathing in the Surf." 
M Y 
friends, if you will listen, 
You I 
will surprise. 
It's of a 
charmer I 
met at a 
picnic, 
Whom I 
thought a 
prize. 
Her eyes were dark and gentle, 
And I 
loved her dearer than gold, 
But after a 
year of married life, 
How badly I 
was sold. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzing up to the bar 
Is a 
favorite pastime of mine; 
I 
always call for strong drink, 
Providing I 
have a 
dime. 
Oh give me gin or whiskey, 
Or old Jamaica rum, 
For since I 
married this beauty 
I've turned out a 
regular bum. 
When our love was young and gay, 
How sweet I 
thought her glance, 
I'd place my arm around her waist 
As we went through the mazy dance. 
Around and around we'd go, 
Mid the multitude so large, 
Oh, how lovely it did seem, 
While waltzing on the barge. 
Waltzing up, etc. 
My married life is an unhappy one, 
I 
have still that plague of a 
wife; 
I'll go and seek to get a 
divorce, 
So I'll have peace the rest of my life. 
My family numbers six, 
The oldest one is a 
blot, 
For whenever I 
sneak to get a 
drink, 
He clings to the tail of my coat. 
Waltzing up, etc.

can't be desaved. 
Here's the ould cabin furninst which we used to dance in the

Ah, those dear ould times. 
But where's the 
happy-hearted little girl that made these walls ring with her 
laughter? Mollie darliut, you were the sweetest little skylark in

TEDDY.—You're right, ma'am. 
MoLuE.—From A 
meriky, perhaps? 
TEDDY.—Sure you're a 
witch! How did ye find that out? 
Mown. (Aside.)—He thinks I 
don't know him, the rogue. 
TEDDY. (Aside.)—She evidently has'nt pinetrated my dis-

You're a

Have ye ever had a

MOLLIE.-011, yes. 
Lot's on 'em. 
TEDDY.—The deuce you have! Who were they ?

McCann, and,-----
TEDDY. —Hould on! that's quite enough for one girl. 
Did ye 
ever know one Teddy Malone of these parts. 
Mom.m. (Carelessly.)- 0h, yes. I 
believe I 
did know a 
harum 
scarum fellow by that name; but he went away to Ameriky, and 
I 
soon forgot all about him. (Aside.) How do you like that, Mr. 
Teddy ? 
TEDDY.— Oh, murder! 
MoLmn.—What's the matter? 
TEDDY.—Nothing but a 
bee in my hat. 
MOLLIE.—Did you know Teddy yourself ? 
TEDDY.— Well, yes, I 
might say I 
did, rather intimately. 
He 
was a 
bosom friend of mine.

MoLLIE.-.-He promised to write to me, but. he niver did wonce,

the dances on the green. 
Oh, that Kerry dance! 
TEDDY.-011, bear her! Could I

Mollie, don't you know me?

IF I ONLY KNEW HOW IT WAS DONE.

THERE are many great things it would please me to do, 
If I 
only could hit on a 
plan, 
I 
often behold a 
big fortune in view, 
But reach to it I 
never can ; 
There's joy and delight in the world ev'ry day, 
And I 
could have plenty of fun, 
I 
could dress up in style, and be merry and gay, 
If I 
only knew how it was done. 
C1IORUS. 
If I 
only knew how it was done, 
I 
could always have pleasure and fun,— 
All the ladies I'd charm and feel no alarm, 
If I 
only knew how it was clone. 
I 
loved a 
fair creature, as fair as could be, 
And fondly my love she returned, 
But both were so bashful we ne'er could be free 
With the feeling that inwardly burned. 
We walked out together and talked very sweet, 
But the subject of love we did shun, 
I 
felt so peculiar, and often I 
wished 
That I 
only knew how it was done. 
If I 
only knew, etc. 
One night after we had returned from the play, 
We lingered sometime at the door, 
I 
thought I 
had said all I 
wanted to say, 
Yet wished for a 
word or two more ; 
I 
mustered up courage just then to propose, 
She thought I 
was only in fun ; 
" 
Oh, no, sir !" she said, " yet I 
might, I 
suppose, 
If I 
only knew how it was done." 
If I 
only knew, etc. 
At length we were married—oh happy the day ! 
The honeymoon passed like a 
dream, 
We felt just as gay as the dear little birds 
That fly over meadow and stream; 
We're blessed with a 
baby as sweet as can be,— 
Of sorrow or care we have none. 
I 
hear people say they would like to be me--
If they only knew how it was done. 
If I 
only knew, etc.

THE FIVE CENT SHAVE. 
Written, composed and sung by Tom CANNON. 
OH 
I 
I'm going to tell to you of the troubles I 
went .brough 
In a 
barber's shop that isn't very far away. 
My beard it being strong, I 
thought 'Mould not be wrong, 
To go and have it trimmed a 
bit the other day ; 
And being short of cash, it struck me like a 
flash, 
That five cents was enough to pay in these hard times. 
So I 
went into a 
place, as I 
thought it no disgrace, 
To practice strict economy and save my dimes, 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
went into one of these barber's shops, where 
they give you a 
shave for five cents and throw in a 
chromo. 
Well ! the fellow put me into a 
chair and took down a 
small 
bottle off the shelf and was going to put it to my nose. What's 
thati says I. 
Chloroform, says he. 
I 
didn't come here to have 
my teeth pulled out, says I. 
Oh, well, says he, if you can 
stand it I 
can. 
Go ahead, says 1. 
So he lathered me, he slathered me, he bruised me and abusod 
me, 
lie tore me, and nearly drove me to my grave. 
He tickled me, he pickled me, he scratched me and he patche4 
me, 
And I'd rather have the measles than his five cent shave. 
I 
stood it for awhile, I 
tried in vain to smile, 
He talked about the weather as he scratched away ; 
He took me by the hair and held me in the chair, 
I 
thought my days were numbered and began to pray; 
At length I 
gave a 
roar, says I, I 
want no more. • 
Here! you can have my pocket- book, but spare my life, 
Take all that I 
possess, and finish my distress, 
I 
cannot stand the torture of your slaughter- house knife. 
SPOKF,N.--You ought to see the way he went about it. 
The 
first thing I 
knew he had his knee upon my chest and was 
sawing away like a 
day's work. 
And then he called out to the 
fellow that cleans the spittoon ; here, Emanuel, come and put 
some grease on this razor, I'm stuck. 
Well, between the two 
they finally got it out, and I 
looked in the glass, and by the 
hokey my face was all marked out in town lots. 
What's this 
you have on my face •I 
I 
says. 
Oh ! well, he says, we expect 
our customers to come back, and that's a 
diagram of the route. 
Well, says I, you may call this a 
clean shave, but I 
call it a 
clean skin and a 
barefaced one at that, and I'll never go there 
again, because, 
So he lathered me, etc.

I'VE a 
maxim that I

It's a 
good one and you should not pass it by; 
It will no doubt benefit you and 'tis well that you should 
know, 
It is, John, my boy, don't fly your kite too high. 
CHORUS. 
Don't fly your kite too high, my boy, 
For sometime it must fall ; 
A 
passing cloud may wreck it, child, 
You'll lose the string and all. 
How well I 
learn'd the lesson that to me was often taught 
But not without experience as well ; 
• 
I 
did speculate and money lose, till poverty o'er fraught 
And on ray ear that maxim clearly. fell, 
Don't fly your kite too high, etc. 
Once more I

Written and sung by LEONARD and JOINTER. 
W E'RE John and James O'Reilly Hoolahan, 
We're members of the City Board of Health; 
Oh, we're not proud although we are dressed loud, 
In a 
sand bank is where we keep our wealth: 
Oh, we live out here on the rubarbs of the town, 
Where we have a 
house and bit of land. 
Our wives they work the gardens, in the market have a 
stall, 
While we go out a 
parading hand in hand. 
CIIORUS. 
We're two Micks, high-toned .Micks, 
Oh, you bet we are the greatest in the land, 
We've accumulated wealth while in the Board of Health, 
We're John and James O'Reilly Hoolahan. 
We've control of all the city garbgage carts, 
We remove all accumulating filth ; 
We crawl through the sewers just to keep them clean, 
It's the rules of the City Board of Health. 
Oh, we lay for all the cattle and we drive them to the 
pound, 
And steal all the bulldogs when we can. 
If your neighbor's yard is dirty, sure we'll tell you what 
to do, 
Just send for John and James O'Hoolahan. 
We're two Micks, etc. 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE. 
AS 
sung by Tom( PASTOR, with great success. 
Am.—" Castles in the Air." 
Mn. Talmage late to New York came to see each wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, and make the 
matter right ; 
He visited each curious place where " Life" did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnightspree as he this town did 
roam; 
I 
did not wish much fault to find, of him to make com-
plaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been 
better for a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery he could help to cure he had not eyes 
to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling 
fast, 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er her head, 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad ! her meal a 
crust 
of bread. 
He did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the 
blue sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die ; 
Heard not her suffering cry for " help !" as her soul from 
bondage free, 
Sped swiftly to the unknown shore! THAT TO/I:Lazo did 
not see. 
5 
t 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE.—Oonaluded. 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives 
might eat; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every 
day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand drag down each workman's 
pay; 
He did not see each savings bank, our poor hard earnings 
win, 
He went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded 
sin ; 
The outcasts of the gutter he, in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he 
did not see. 
I 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
work, 
And purify his own good town before he tries New 
York; 
I never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought 
" 
promised land," 
Or even that its 
parsons were the famous Gideon's 
Band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam, 
use his purifying broom and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if he must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
He'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when misery he does 
see.

THE FUNNY LITTLE TAILOR. 
Composed and sung by PAT K ELLY. 
THERE was a 
jolly tailor once that I 
knew well, 
He kept a 
little tailor shop and had pantaloons to sell, 
Neck- ties, broadcloth, and everything like that, 
And anyone could tell he wore a 
very funny hat; 
It wasn't very low nor it wasn't very high, 
It had a 
peculiar look that would quickly take the eye. 
He wore it on Sunday and every day ir.2 
the week, 
And it always looked glossy, for be kept it very neat. 
He was the pride of the ladies and the envy of the boys; 
Wherever he would go be would never make a 
noise; 
He was as light on his feet as a 
canary on a 
tree; 
He was bashful, he was neat, and as happy as could be; 
Whenever there was a 
party he was sure to be there, 
With his tight pantaloons and glossy curly hair; 
He could talk, dance, sing, and wink, and everything like that, 
But no matter where he would go he wore his funny little bat. 
He went to a 
party one night where there was lots of fun, 
He got rather tired and sleepy from drinking rum and gum! 
They put him in the corner to have a 
little doze, 
When the boys found it out they put a 
cork on his nose, 
And they all yelled" Fire!" with a 
terrible shout; 
But he quickly jumped up and quietly put it out; 
He took his little hat and walked to the door, 
And he bade them all good-bye, and they never saw him more. 
SUSANNAH McMANUS. 
Composed by OOFTY GOOFT. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL. 
oNeE had a 
fine, purty lump of a 
girl, 
Susannah McManus be name; 
She's gone to the divil entirely now, 
And played me a 
dirty, mane game. 
It's over and over I 
tould her me love; 
She pledged me her heart and her hand; 
But now she has fled with a 
villainous scamp 
That played in a 
minstrel band. 
CHORUS. 
0, sorra's the day for Susannah she left; 
Forget her I'll try if I 
can; 
But the divil got into her head, so it did, 
When she met with that minstrel man. 
Susannah McManus, sure that was her name, 
And a 
fine daceut girl, be the way, 
Till that na,gmr minstrel came into the town. 
Bad cess to that very same day! 
Mesolf and Susannah we went to the show, 
Which caused me a 
dollar to .spend, 
And Susannah was struck with the fellow that played 
On the tambouriae there on the end. 
0, sorra's the, etc. 
The curtain wint down, and then it wint up, 
And that very same divil came out, 
With a 
grin and a 
kick, and a 
slap of his fist; 
Like a 
monkey he wriggled about. 
He straddled a 
chair with a 
quare-looking thing; 
He called it a 
bingo I 
think; 
He sang and looked at Susannah, he did, 
And gave her an old-fashioned wink. 
0, sorra's the, etc. 
She packed up her duds on the very next day, 
And straightway she wint from her home, 
And she sent me a 
letter and said she was gone 
Wid this minstrel man for to roam. 
I'll gouge him I 
I'll fight him! I'll kick him! 
bite him! 
I'll smash him as flat as a 
pan, 
For taking Susannah McManus away. 
That oulcl nagur minstrel man. 
0, sorra's the, etc.

MURPHY, LAY DOWN, YOU'RE NO GOOD. 
As sung by SeAlgras and Cnomrc, with great success. 
ninon only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this beautiful town, 
Many strange things I've seen, and stranger ones heard, 
Which to me appeared queer, I 
must own ; 
I 
don't want you to think I'm perfection, 
Nor wouldn't be, indeed, if I 
could ; 
Yet wherever I 
go, among the rich or the poor, 
There is some one to say I'm no good. 
CITORCS. 
For the boys in the shtreet they cry at me, 
In a 
way can't be misunderstood— 
Will you ever go home to ould Ireland 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good." 
When first I 
arrived in this city, 
For a 
first-class hotel sure I 
went ; 
Straight up Broadway I 
wandered, 
On seeing the sights I 
was bent; 
Into a 
neat little gin & II I 
wandered, 
Like a 
rale Irish gentleman should ; 
When the puppy that stood behind the bar 
Says, you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the boys, ste. 
Says I, " My friend, do I 
look like a 
hangman, 
Or like any of that rascally crowd, 
Who in Ireland, for less than a 
shilling, 
To take a 
man's life would be proud ? 
No, indeed now, my friend, you don't know me, 
Though poor I 
may be and need food; 
Yet there's not a 
man in this country, 
Begorra, can say I'm no good." 
For the boys, etc. 
When at home I 
was a 
bit of a 
boxer. 
And could hoe my own row with the rest, 
And in many an off- hand encounter 
I 
was known to have come out .the best; 
Yet I 
scarcely had reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely known, bedad, where I 
stood, 
When a 
laddy scarce up to my shoulder 
Says, Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the boys, etc

MURPHY, LAY DOWN, YOU'RE NO GOOD.— 
Concluded. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang 
I 
can daily be seen at the Hall; 
And when the poor or the rich need assistance, 
By you all it must be understood, 
That there is not a 
man in the ward 
Will say, Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the boys, etc, 
THERE'S A SMILE WAITING FOR ME AT 
HOME. 
As sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
TnounLE we fancy is heavy to bear, 
While travelling life's dreary way; 
Some are heart- broke 
rt with sorrow and care, 
While others are cheerful and gay; 
The road may be rough and the journey be long, 
As over its pathway I 
roam, 
Contented I 
sing this the theme of my song— 
There's a 
smile waiting for me at home. 
ClIORUS. 
The frowns of this world are nothing to me, 
Trials and troubles may come; 
I've this consolation where'er I 
may roam— 
There's a 
smile waiting for me at home. 
Weary and worn, or by labor oppressed, 
Or sneered at by folks in their pride; 
The shrine of my love and the haven of rest, 
I 
find at my own fireside. 
Voices so gentle and hearts that are warm, 
To cheer me when trouble does come, 
I 
know there's a 
shelter in every storm, 
In the smile that awaits me at home. 
The frowns, etc..

THEY STOLE AWAY IVIY GIRL. 
Ant.—" The Railroad Guide." 
Sung with great success by Joint INTuRpnr, at GILL'S ENTERPRISE, 15 
West Houston street. 
I'M a 
man of many troubles; I've always failed in life; 
I 
never had a 
friend, indeed; I 
never won a 
wife. 
I've often loved a 
pretty girl. 
Before my love prevailed 
Some other fellow came along, and then my courtship 
failed. 
In boyhood, when to school I 
went, the darlings I 
would 
tease ; 
I 
added up their little sums—did all I 
could to please, 
And when, fool-like, I 
did get my brain into a 
whirl, 
Some great big blubber interfered, and stole away my girL 
I 
once went to Central Park, to see the ladies skate; 
A 
damsel gliding on the ice, she quickly sealed my fate; 
I 
tried to pass before her, a 
glimpse of her to spy, 
We both came in collision, and upon the ice did lie. 
Our skates they got entangled in a 
true-lover's knot; 
Our hearts they beat together; I 
was dead gone on the 
spot. 
I 
wished upon the frozen snow my love there to enfold. 
She said, " Why, what a 
fool you are to spoon there in the 
cold 1" 
If I 
dance in any ball-room, or go to see the play, 
There villains surely will come up and take my girl away; 
They call it only joking, but it is no joke to me ; 
I 
only wish those naught- men would let those darlings be. 
Now will some lady pity take, and judge me by my case ? 
I 
look with anxious eye upon each sweet and pretty face. 
I 
adore each laughing dimple—I 
admire each raven curl; 
But say the word, and I'll take care that no one steals 
my girl.

THE BUSY B'S. 
An original song, as sung by rlIANII LEWIS, with immense sucesSa. 
A 
STRANGE name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Beelzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir 
Caused mankind its shame first to see, sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all ; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see, sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee, sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches, 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks of apologies given— 
Will that bring the dead back to life ? 
(1) 
Ullgat, :
04:14 
THE BUSY B'S.—Conoluded. 
Will that aid the wives and. children 
Of th, victims who fell in the strife ? 
CHORUS. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach to the sky, sir, 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine ; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B 
was old Blaine 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin ; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS, 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill— 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap ; 
Though perhaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap ? 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy Fs.

DUBLIN POLICEMEN. 
W E'RE rattling, roaring Irish boys, 
Come over here to join the force, man; 
To protect the peace, keep down the noise, 
There's none can do it like us, of course, man s 
In our suit of blue there are but few 
With us can come the Irish dandy, 
And if the boys kick up any noise, 
Sure we run them into the cell quite bandy.

About the town but what we scale it, 
And if anything there we find at all, 
Wouldn't we be flats if we didn't nail itl

hue and cry, 
Something stole, but to be brief, man, 
And by the hookey, who but ourgelves 
Is running about to cotch the thief, man !

Supposing, walking about all night, 
In every hole aid corner creeping, 
Something we spy by the pale moonlight; 
Arrali, by my soul, it's a ,gintleman sleeping, 
His pockets we grope, his money we take, 
Then with our sticks on the ribs we're jobbing him, 
And if perchance the poor soul should wake, 
We tell him we thought a 
thief was robbing him.
