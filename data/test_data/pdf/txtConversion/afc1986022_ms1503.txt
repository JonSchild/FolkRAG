IN: Yes, I use to fly pigeons I use to fly all kinds like use to had ah ah Tiplet ah we use
to get a couple of Clinkers in it take them up the roof and break they neck or throw em
down the roof or sometime we use to just catch um and we use to eat em, Yeah, we use to
put them in hot wate r and you see they neck wobble, Right, we use to after after it got all
boiled up we used to just pick up the feathers sometime use to come off that was a nasty
thing to do too.......Well, the only way there's to train a bird is just to keep them inside your
coupe and just leave it there for such a period of time and and when that time is up just
let em out and they just stick around your coupe......You have to leave em for about a two
weeks or three weeks the most in order to get use to that place cause if you just take a
bird and and just leave it there for a day or 2 is, the day you let it out man, its gonna go
back home.....Right, back to its stall cause you know like, once you got a bird and they
have that bird there for a long time is use to that place no matter where it is......Right and
it flies out and it comes back and theres a (time on) and when you fly a bird you got a bout
a stack of them and let them go up in the air they could really bring someother birds to you
cause it attracts the other birds that are flying by themselves and really brings them home
