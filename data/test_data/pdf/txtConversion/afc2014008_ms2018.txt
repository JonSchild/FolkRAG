Demographic Factors
 
The decline i
n f
emale mortality has r
esulted i
n a
 decline i
n
 
f
ertility a
s well (
a decline i
n mortality without a
lso l
owering
 
fertility would mean an impossible r
ate of population
 
g
rowth--as t
he s
tatistics i
n many underdeveloped countries
 
i
llustrate). In i
ndustrialized countries around the world,
 
however, t
he b
irth r
ate i
s a
t l
ess t
han r
eplacement l
evel. While
 
2
.1 b
irths are now needed t
o r
eplace a couple i
n t
he United
 
S
tates, t
he actual r
ate i
n 1
982 was 1
.74 b
irths per couple.  I
n
 
1
855, when 3
.32 children were needed for r
eplace ment, t
he
 
actual b
irth r
ate was g
reater t
han t
hat f
igure.  So while t
he
 
nu mber of b
irths needed for r
eplace ment has dropped off
 
2
 Davis
 
s
ignificantly during t
he l
ast c
entury, t
he actual b
irth r
ate has
 
d
ropped o
ff even further. Certainly, women a

Ending c
hildbearing early. The r
eduction i
n b
irths has been
 
achieved not by wider s
pacing of children, but by ending
 
childbearing a
t an earlier age. I
ndeed, t
he media exaggerates
 
t
he nu mber of wo men waiting until t
heir t
hirties t
o bear
 
children. In 1
982, 78% of a
ll b
irths i
n t
his country were t
o
 
wo men under age 30.  In fact, t
here continue t
o be f

Fewer c
hildren. As women and men l
ive l
onger, t
hey s
pend
 
an increasing part of their l
ives independent of
 
children--women more s
o t
han men. During t
he f
irst half of
 
t
his c
entury, a t
ypical mother's l
ast child l
eft home when s
he
 
was approximately 5

I s
peak here and e
lsewhere only of t
he
 
white population i
n t
he United S
tates.) This meant t
hat, on an
 
average, s
he l
ived only 4
 years a
fter her l
ast child's departure,
 
and of course s
ome d
id not l
ive t
hat l
ong.  Today, a t
ypical
 
mother can expect approximately 35 years, o

The Role of Marriage and Family
 
The su m t

actors--decreased
 
mortality, particularly among women, and f
ewer b

long
 
with t
he preference of many men for younger women, means

How Women Become Poor
 
The poverty r

983. The poverty
 
r

r
e mained t

t 25% for whites and about 50% for
 
b
lacks, again s
howing no t

here any change i
n
 
t
he poverty rate for male headed households.  Increased
 
poverty, therefore, was overwhel mingly due t
o changes i

s
, when a
 woman's s

s
he became a head of household, s
he was l
ikely a

o enter
 
poverty.
 
The f
e minization of poverty i

beco me heads of households, and t
his g

r
apidly during t

depending on whether o

Divorce and c

How Women Exit From Poverty
 
White wo men exited poverty a

ong. Only 1

c

Re marriage.  Marital decisions are t
he most important

women's exit f
rom poverty.  Thirty-seven percent o

Theoretical Accounts
 
Most models of child abuse fall i
nto t
hree categories:
 
s
ociological, organic, and psychodyna mic.  Sociological
 
explanations l
ook a
t f
actors s
uch a
s poverty, s
ocial i

external s
tress, overcrowding, and s

s
ubnormal i
ntelligence of both t
he perpetrator and t
he child.
 
The p
sychodyna mic explanation I
 f
ind most compelling--the
 
"
sexualization of nurturance"-- p
roposes t
hat emotional c
aring
 
and support of men for t
heir younger children s
o mehow
 
becomes s
exualized.
 
Predicting abuse. F
inkelhor a
rgued t
hat a
 s
uccessful model
 
f
or p
redicting s
exual abuse must address f
our questions: "What
 
a
re t
he c
onditions under which a
 person f
inds r
elating s
exually
 
t
o a child t
o be emotionally s
atisfying?"  "What characterizes
 
o
ffenders who overcome t
heir own i
nternal s
exual i
nhibitions?"
 
"How do perpetrators d
isinhibit t
he s
ocial t
aboos a
ssociated
 
with child s
exuality?" And f
inally, "What f
actors b
lock an
 
i
ndividual's ability t
o obtain s
exual and emotional g
ratification
 
f
ro m s
ocially approved s
ources, i
.e. o
ther consenting adults?"
 
He i
dentified e
ight vulnerability f
actors affecting t
he s
exual
 
abuse of adolescent g
irls: l
iving without a
 f
ather, l
iving with a
 
s
tepfather, l
ack of physical affection f
rom f
ather, mother's
 
educational l
evel, mother not c
lose t
o t
he child, s
ex-punitive
 
mother, l
ow-inco me and s
ocial i
solation f
ro m peer g
roup.
 
According t
o F
inkelhor when one of t
hese f
actors i
s p
resent a
 
child has a 1
5% l
ikelihood of s
exual abuse. However, when f
ive
 
o
f t
he f
actors a
re p
resent, t
he l
ikelihood i
ncreases t
o 70%.
 
The characteristics o
f t
he f
ather i
n an abusing f
amily a
re
 
s
een t
o i
nclude a
lcoholis m, drug use, conservative f
a mily
 
values, s
exual modesty, and r
epressiveness o
r c
overtness about
 
s
exual matters.  One explanation for t
he a
ssociation between
 
r
epressiveness and s
exual abuse suggests t
hat t
he father
 
v
ictimizes t
he child because of an i
nhibition t
o engage i
n an
 
e
xtra marital r

After f

Predicting whether a
 child will become p

r
aises both universal and i

and g

behavior? Can one predict more accurately for boys o

g

I

This article was prepared by
 
Dennis Moore based on a
 
September 1
985 IRSS c
olloquium.
 
currently funded by t
he National S
cience Foundation.  Our
 
s
taff c
onsists of t
hree full-time members, one and s
ometi mes
 
two post-doctoral r
esearchers, and s
everal a
ssistants for
 
encoding t
he massive amounts of data. We a
lso enjoyed t
he
 
cooperation of nu merous t
eachers, administrators and s
upport
 
s
taff i
n t
he various s
chools i
n which we worked.
 
Defining aggression. Defining aggression can be a
 
co mplicated t
ask. Depending upon t
he i
ndex used, one c
an
 
co me up with various approaches and d
ifferent f
indings. I
n
 
our s
tudy, for exa mple, we decided not t
o l
imit aggressive
 
behavior t
o physical v
iolence t
o persons o
r p
roperty. We f
ound,
 
i
n fact, t
hat t
he quality of verbal i
nsults i
ntensifies with age.
 
Thus, we i
ncluded behavior s
uch a
s r
idiculing o
ther children
 
and l
aughing a
t t
heir mistakes.
 
Measures of aggression. I
n our e
ffort t
o develop a
 definition
 
o
f aggression we found ourselves f
acing measurement a
s well
 
as conceptual proble ms. Research r
esults might differ
 
dra matically depending upon the source and t
ype of
 
measurement u
sed. For example, one i
nvestigator might l
ook a
t
 
court r
ecords, another might observe pupils i
n s
chool, and a
 
t
hird might a
sk outright f
or confessions.
 
Five basic measures. We decided t
o use f
ive d
ifferent
 
measures of aggression. I
n addition t
o i
ndividual i
nterviews
 
and d
irect behavioral observations by our s
taff, we a
sked

t
eachers and counselors t
o r
ate a

ocial
 
co mpetence i
nventory which i
ncluded a factor s
core of
 
aggression. We a
lso had children r
ate t
heir peers (
peer
 
nomination). F
inally we u
sed s
elf-ratings by t
he children.
 
Teacher nominations. We had t
eachers and counselors
 
nominate s
tudents t
hey considered "
at r
isk," and paired e
ach o
f
 
t
hese s
ubjects with a control child. Our c
riteria f
or matching
 
i

ize (
at t
he t
ime o
f s
election). Our s
taff t
hen
 
s
pent one week during every year of t
he s
tudy observing e
ach
 
h
igh-risk child and h
is or her match control pupil. S
taff
 
me mbers observed i
n pairs, t
o a
ssure r
eliability of data and
 
s
afety. The observers switched focus every 5 minutes, s
o t
hat
 
t
hey r
egularly a
lternated between t
he molecular and molar
 
l
evels (
i
.e., s
ystematically switching f
rom a
 f
ocus on t
he s
ocial
 
c
ontext t
o a
 f
ocus on t
he i
ndividual's s
ocial exchanges).
 
Self-ratings. S
tudent s
elf-ratings proved t
o be t
he most
 
p
roblematic method of measurement. Many r
esearchers s
uggest
 
t
hat proble m-aggressive children have l
ow s
elf-estee m. We
 
found, however, t
hat a particular child's s
elf-esteem often i
s
 
not half as l
ow as i
t should be, g
iven the child's poor
 
performance and behavior.  What s
o meti mes l
ooks l
ike l
ow
 
s
elf-estee m c
an actually be s
elf-enhancing, considering t
he
 
child's actual behavior.  We found, f
or example, t
hat when
 
a
sked t
o rate the mselves on popularity, acade mics and
 
aggressiveness, t
he children often c
reated a
 s
elf t
hey c
ould be
 
co mfortable with. Children appear t
o have a n
ice hydraulic
 
s
yste m operating, by which t
hey can c
reate a p
icture t
hat i
s
 
r
easonably functional f
or g
etting up i
n t
he morning.
 
Under c
ertain c
onditions, however, we f
ound s
elf-ratings t
o
 
be very valuable. We obtained our most u
seful s
elf-ratings i
n
 
t
he context o
f public events. Public behavior, while s
ometimes
 
embarrassing, l
ends i
tself t
o f
ar more accurate s
elf-reporting
 
t
han does a
 p
rivate behavior. Private events a
llow f
or s
o much
 
f
reedo m of construction t
hat t
he details d
isclosed a
re not
 
a
lways r
eliable.
 
Reconciling t
eacher-ratings with s
elf-r
atings. We found
 
c
ertain i
nconsistencies when we compared t
eacher-ratings with
 
s
elf-ratings particularly when we t
ried t
o measure d
ifferences
 
based on age and gender. Beginning i
n t
he fourth grade,
 
t
eacher r
atings suggested obvious, conspicuous age and s
ex
 
d
ifferences. But t
he boys' and g
irls' s
elf-ratings s
howed modest
 
or negligible gender d
ifferences.  Further, we found no
 
Social Science

c
orrelation b
etween s
elf-ratings and o
ther r
eports, even t
hough
 
we observed a definite t
rend t
oward g
roup commonality. We
 
found t
he variance among s
elf-ratings t
o be approximately
 
one-fourth t
he variance of r
atings by t
eachers o
r r
esearchers.
 
The more concrete t
he s
elf-report, t
he h
igher t
he l
evel of
 
agreement with measures o
f behavior, t
eacher r
atings, and peer
 
nominations.
 
Social maps. By combining c
lassroo m observations with
 
s
ocial "maps" we began t
o s
ee patterns o
f s
ocial s
upport which
 
r
einforced aggressive behavior. We a
sked each s
tudent t
o
 
describe s
ocial patterns i
n c
lass--who s
ocializes with whom--in
 
o
rder t
o r
eveal t
he i
ndividuals' perceptions of c
lusters which
 
exist within the l
arger group. We found t
he maps t
o be
 
s
urprisingly accurate. Not only d
id t
he s
tudents a
ll agree about
 
t
he composition of s
ocial g
roups, but t
heir maps c
orroborated
 
our own observations.
 
Developmental Trajectories
 
Psychological r
esearchers have c
onflicting v
iews on t
he
 
predictability of aggression and on whether aggressive
 
behavior i
ncreases a
s a child gets o
lder. Certain cognitive-
develop mental theorists suggest t
hat aggression actually
 
declines with age. Some s
ociologists, on t
he o
ther hand, have
 
actually de monstrated t
he opposite pattern. Using c
ensus
 
f
igures and epidemiological data, Hershey and o
thers s
uggest
 
t
hat aggression i
ncreases with age.
 
Gender differences. Our s
tudy supports t
he v
iew t
hat
 
aggressive behavior i
ncreases with age. Our r
esearch further
 
suggests important gender d
ifferences associated with
 
aggression i
n o
lder children. While we found f
ew predictive
 
d
ifferences between boys and g
irls, we d
id f
ind s
ignificant
 
d
ifferences between h
igh r
isk boys and g

hat was s
urprising t

he 6

and 7

rades, however, t
he pool of h

i
ncreased, while t
he pool o
f g
irls decreased.
 
Social s
upport and aggressive expression.  We a
lso f
ound
 
t
hat s

yste ms actually encourage aggression
 
particularly among boys. According t
o our observations a
s well
 
a
s t
he s
tudents' own s
ocial maps, adolescent males t
ended t
o
 
c
luster according t
o t
he aggressive d

s, t
he
 
cohesive f
actor among aggressive adolescent boss was not

ocial c
lass o
r i
ntelligence, but r
ather, aggression i
tself. These
 
boys for med a t
ight s
ocial g
roup despite c
lass background.
 
Girls, on t
he o
ther hand, did not t
end t
o for m t
he s
a me
 
gang-like g
roups. I
nstead, i
t appears, g
irls s
ocialize much more
 
exclusively with o
thers of their own c
lass or social
 
background. That i
s, we found t
hat aggressive g
irls s
ocialize
 
with non-aggressive g
irls of t
he s
ame c
lass background.
 
Gender d
ifferences were a
lso very apparent i
n t
he t
ypes o

esorted t

Coping with r

d
ifference between these children may help explain t

d

choolchildren were white,
 
the Atlanta children were b

environment i

children, unlike t

hen,
 
t

The Theory of Learned Helplessness
 
Some years ago, Martin S
eligman and I
 observed t
hat dogs
 
exposed t
o unavoidable e
lectric s
hocks d
isplayed a s
yndrome
 
we l
abeled "
learned helplessness." This s
yndrome had t
hree
 
characteristics: (
1) a motivational deficit i
nferred f
rom t
he
 
f
ailure of t
he ani mals t
o i
nitiate r
esponses; (
2) an a
ssociative
 
deficit inferred f
ro m t
he failure t
o show capability for
 
l
earning, even a
fter t
he r
einforcement of a
 s
uccessful e
scape o
r
 
avoidance; and (
3) an emotional deficit i
nferred f
ro m t
he
 
r
educed vocalizations (
less yelping) and general passivity. We
 
emphasized a
 s
ingle f
actor--uncontrollability--as t
he c
ause o
f
 
t
he t
hree deficits, and hypothesized t
hat t
hey s
hould a
lways
 
co-occur. However, r
esearchers have now e
stablished t
hat

co-occurence i
s not a
lways a factor, suggesting t
hat t
he
 
s

ach s

The role of unpredictability. Our original l
earned
 
helplessness experiments employed s
hocks t
hat were t
ypically
 
not only uncontrollable, but a
lso unpredictable--that i
s, t
hey
 
were presented without warning and i
ndependent of o
ther
 
s
ti muli. To t
est the hypothesis t
hat two s
eparate factors
 
contribute t
o the helplessness s
yndro me, one experi ment
 
co mpared t
he ability of subjects previously exposed t
o
 
uncontrollable, controllable, o
r no s
hocks, t
o e
scape s
tressors i
n
 
a
 new s
ituation, while a s
econd compared subjects p
reviously
 
exposed t
o unpredictable, p
redictable, o
r no s
hocks (
i
.e., s
ignal
 
only).
 
The r
esults of both experi ments were d
ifferent. Although
 
unpredictable, uncontrollable s
hocks y
ielded c
lear motivational
 
n
terference, unpredictable, controllable ones d
id not.  In
 
ontrast, a
lthough unpredictable, uncontrollable s
hocks a
lso
 
y
ielded c
lear associative interference, predictable,
 
uncontrollable s
hocks d
id not. I
ndeed, t
he predictable-shocks
 
g
roup t
ended t
o l
earn t
he new a
ssociations s
omewhat better.
 
This l
ast suggests t
hat t
he a
ssociative deficit i
n t
he l
earned
 
helplessness s
yndrome may be c
aused a
t l
east i
n part by t
he
 
unpredictable nature of t
he uncontrolled shocks, consistent
 
with our earlier s
uggestion t
hat t
he s
yndrome i
s not a
 unitary
 
phenomenon.
 
Assessing Predictability and Controllability on Emotion
 
To manipulate both controllability and predictability
 
i
ndependently, a f
inal experiment paired dogs t
ogether s
o t
hat
 
only t
he master animal, by pressing a r
esponse panel with i
ts
 
head, c
ould c

he s
hocks r
eceived by both. I
f i
t d
id not
 
p
ress, t
he s
hocks ended a
fter a f
ixed amount of t
ime. Because
 
t
he dogs were mechanically yoked t
o e
ach o
ther, t
he t
ype,
 
duration, and d
istribution o
f a
ll s
timuli were i
dentical within a
 
pair. Thus, one had control and t
he o
ther d
id not.  For s
ome
 
pairs, a

rials were s
ignaled; for t
he o

The Symbolism of Death
 
I
 have now a
ssembled a
 core of n
ine documented examples
 
posthu mous mourning portraits by various a
rtists. Working
 
om t
his core, I
 have detected t
he posthumous mode - -
 c
ertain
 
br c
ombinations, encoded mortuary s
ymbols, and s
tage s
ets
 
gnal t
hat portrayal i
s post-mortem.
 
Color.  The t
raditional mourning colors of r
ed, white, and
 
b
lack f
requently o
ccur i
n t
he c
ostumes, p
lants, and background
 
e
ffects of posthu mous mourning portraits.  That b
lack and
 
white a
re mourning colors probably come a
s no surprise t
o
 
moderns. But t
he u
se of r
ed f
or mourning has not c
arried over
 
i
nto t
he 20th c
entury.  I
t derives f
rom t
he medieval Christian
 
t
radition of draping t
he coffin with a r
ed pall.  A child
 
dressed i
n any c
ombination of t
hese t
hree colors, j
uxtaposed t
o
 
a r
ed or white p
lant and s
tanding against a s
olid b
lack
 
background o
r g
loomy s
ky f
alls under s
uspicion of being dead.
 
Metaphors. Certain s
ymbols functioned a
s v
isual metaphors
 
t
o express t
he mourner's t
enacious will t
o r
etain t
he dead
 
among t
he l
iving o
r c
onversely, t
o p
rolong t
he r
eality of a
 l
ife
 
cut s
hort.  C
linging v
ines, keepsake books, o
r t
he dog, f
aithful
 
unto death, a
re s
igns of t
his desire.
 
Ephemera.  Ephemeral a
rticles s
uch a
s f
ast-fading f

s
oap bubbles, a s
topped watch, or a dead b
ird a
lso s
peak of

The i

he i
nkwell i

makes t
he meaning of t
he r
ose explicit: "Born April 2 1

Just as the rose began t
o b

Watches with t
he death hour.  Fro m t
he 17th century,
 
particularly i
n Dutch s
till-life painting, watches were one t
ype
 
of me mento mon.  This meaning carried over t
o America,
 
where watches s

in Mount's portrait of Ca mille, t

c
onnotation. The watch, which s

f a

or

eason, a
s i
f s
o mething was drawing me spiritual. I
'
ll never f
orget the
 
experience o
f t
hat. The l
eaves on the t
rees were weeping and i
t was amazing
 
how nature spoke to me. I
 began t
o think on the l
ines o
f the c

 never
 
p
rayed any s
o I
 a
sked God i
n a
 s
imple way t
o have s
omeone i

o church
 
and I
'

When Rutledge f
inally d
id go t
o church he went f
or many
 
n
ights.
 
I
 would s
tand there and shake i
n t
he pew. I
 would not g

n t
o i
t
. I
t was
 
a
 f
orce pulling a

ixth n

 a
ccepted i
t
. The burden had
 
l
i
fted. I
 f
elt new. I
 f
elt c
lean.
 
With t
his experience Rutledge was s
aved, o
r converted i
n a
 
Free Will Baptist Church, one o
f t
he Baptist g
roups f
rom which
 
t
he Primitive Baptists b
roke. From t
his point he hungered f
or
 
deeper r
eligious experiences and y
earned f
or "
a manifestation
 
o
f t
he s
pirit o
f God" t
o r
emain s
trong i
n h
is beliefs. About one
 
year after being s
aved he t
ook a t
rip t
o Timber Lake, North
 
Carolina and had another experience with God. He r
ecalls "
a
 
f
orce, i
t j
ust drew me t
o h
im. I
t anointed me a
ll over. I
t was a
 
j
oy t
hat I
 had never experienced."
 
I
nterpretations of experience. Rutledge t
ried t
o d
iscuss h
is
 
s
anctification with t
he church l
eaders. The pastor denied t
he
 
experience and t
old h
i m t
o f
orget i
t
. The deacon t
hought i
t
 
c
a me f
rom a
 demon. These i
nterpretations d
isturbed Rutledge
 
f
or s
even years, s
ince he could not s
hake h
is own convictions
 
born of h
is s
piritual experiences.
 
There was so much g
lory and s
o much j
oy. But I
 had never heard o
f the
 
baptis m o
f t
he spirit or nothing. All I
 had ever heard was g
et s
aved, s
it i
n t
he
 
c
hurch and go t
hrough the r
ituals o
f every day and every Sunday s
ervice.
 
In t
he s
even years after h
is Ti mber Lake experience
 
Rutledge t
aught Sunday s
chool and t
aught about t
he Holy
 
Ghost, "
how God could manifest h
imself i
n t
he t

His church condemned h
is experience but he s
tood f

egardless of how t

However, one day, when everything s

Rutledge went t

uffered, "
condemned

b
efore t

 d
ream:

 Peacock and Tyson
 
I
 was on my way again t
o t
he s
ame church. I
 was walking a
 h
ighway t
hat
 
I
 t
hought l
ed t
o t
he church which was s
o me 12 or 15 miles. My a
ttention was
 
a
ttracted by two white she-bears t
hat were walking 1
5 f
eet above the r
oad
 
l
evel. Travelling the same d
irection t
hey both t
urned their head and l
ooked a
t
 
me f
or a
 f
ew moments. I
 wondered i
f
 t
hey would a
ttack me and perhaps destroy
 
my l
ife. But they turned a
 l
i
ttle f
ro m me and s
et their f
aces a
irline d
irection
 
t
oward t
his church. And I
 was made t
o wonder, what meaneth t
his? I
 s
aw the m
 
no more.
 
When I
 had r
eached the church and had entered t
he door t
he congregation
 
had gathered. As I
 walked up t
he a
isle two preachers were s
itting on t
he s
tand,
 
on t
he l
eft s
ide, s
itting very c
lose t
ogether. I
 knew the m very well, had been
 
w
ith the m many t
imes, knew t
hat t
hey both denied t
hat God chose h
is people
 
f
ro m the beginning. I
 l
ooked t
o t
he l
eft s
ide where t
he s
isters a
lways s
it. There
 
s
at t
he wife o
f one o
f those preachers. She was a
 good hu mble woman i
n heart I
 
f
eel sure. I
 walked i
nto t
he s
tand and I
 r
ose t
o my f
eet and announced the t
ext
 
I
 had r
un f
ro m twice before [
fro m Thessalonians]. I
 was carried co mpletely
 
above everything that pertains t
o this world.
 
Just a
s I
 c
losed my d
iscourse the chill of death s
truck me i
n my f
eet and
 
began t
o co me up my l
egs and over my body.  When i
t had enveloped me
 
c
o mpletely I
 f
ell dead. I
 awoke f
rom t
his dream speechless, couldn't move even
 
my f
ingers. My eyes were opened and and I
 couldn't c
lose them. I
 thought I
 
was dying and t
ried t
o speak t
o my wife and t
ell her I
 was gone. But I
 could
 
not s
peak.
 
Affirming predestination.  Thomas r
egained h
is movement
 
and speech and vowed t
o h
i mself that he would affir m
 
p
redestination a
t t
he next meeting he a
ttended.
 
No t
ongue c
ould possibly express t
he burden i
n my heart a
s I
 walked up t
o
 
open the door. As I
 walked up the a
isle I
 l
ooked d
irectly a
t t
he pulpit t
o s
ee i
f
 
my dream was t
rue. Everything was exactly a
s i
n t
he dream. I
 delivered t
his
 
message (
of predestination) with a
ll t
he power o
f my being. I
 s
till thought t
his
 
was my l
ast and f
inal message. I
 was carried above every t
rouble, every f
ear i
n
 
t
he world. The two white s
he-bears came before me. Well, everything happened
 
t
hat I
 saw except I
 d
idn't f
all dead, naturally, but I
 guess I
 d
ied to their
 
f
ellowship and l
ove.
 
Eventually Thomas was immersed i
n an i
cy s
trea m and
 
baptized i
nto t
he Primitive Baptist Church, where he r
emains,
 
c
ontent with h
is b
rethren.
 
Comparing t
he Traditions
 
Through t
he narrations of Rutledge's and Thomas' s
piritual
 
uests we can co mpare and contrast t
he two t

r
aditions r
epresented.
 
S

had t

 Protestant

and felt detached and a

inally, both Thomas and
 
Rutledge experienced what p
sychologists t
oday call "mid-life
 
c
risis." However, t
hey dealt with p
ivotal l
ife t

Seeking t
he experience.  The contrasts between Rutledge
 
and Tho mas, however, h
ighlight t
he d
ifferences between
 
Pentecostal and Primitive Baptist faiths. Rutledge, l
ike t
he
 
Pentecostals, believed he was s
aved and t
hen s
anctified. As a
 
Pentecostal, Rutledge s
ought r
eligious experience empirically.
 
by v
isiting various churches and t
rying t
hem on f
or s

h
i m t

he r

beca me boring.  Rutledge experienced t
he s
piritual forces
 
d
irectly and t
hen confir med t
hem i
n s

Knowing t
he doctrine. Thomas, on t
he o
ther hand, s
ought

tudying t
he s
cripture, "
in t
he Book.'
 
He experienced s
piritual f
orces a
s a
llegorical images i
n a
 v
ision
 
where t
hey a
lready had s
criptural definition.  For Thomas,
 
experience was a by-product, which s
imply r
esolved o
r
 
c
onfirmed a
 doctrinal d
ilemma. He d
id not evaluate t
he r

f

ituals s
imply were what
 
t
hey were.  For Thomas and t
he Primitive Baptists t
here i
s no
 
a
ssurance of s
alvation, merely hope.
 
Conclusion. Pentecostals and Pri mitive Baptists t
aken
 
t
ogether, define r
ather opposite poles i

Language and Historical Meaning
 
Take f
or example, t
he c
ase of Sarah Gayle. Sarah, t
he only
 
s
urviving child of a wealthy South Carolina f
a mily, ca me t
o
 
l
ive i
n Greensboro, Alabama i
n t
he 1
820's. She married J
ohn
 
Gayle who l
ater became Governor of Alabama and t
hen a
 U.S.
 
Congressman. Sometime i
n t
he 1
840's Sarah's parents d
ied. Her
 
l
etters about t
he deaths r
eveal much about t
he i
deal family
 
Sarah envisioned and felt she had been denied.  Sarah
 
desperately missed near k
in who s
he defined i
n her d
iary a
s
 
people "who knew you a
s you u
sed t
o be, t
he way you r
eally
 
are." Sarah had f
riends, d
istant k
in i
n South Carolina,
 
neighbors, a husband, and children of her own. But i
n her
 
v
iew, she had no one with who m she shared a past and
 
t
herefore had no f
amily. The northern notion of "
family" a
s
 
anyone r
elated by b
lood o
r marriage, had l
ittle meaning f
or
 
Sarah Gayle.
 
Definitions of family. Just a
s Sarah Gayle's understanding
 
of "
fa mily" excluded many people northerners would might
 
i
nclude, i
t a
lso i
ncluded s
ome i
ndividuals northerners would
 
never drea m of calling fa mily.  I
n t
he 1
850's for exa mple,
 
Sarah wrote t
o her f
inancially s
trapped husband begging h
im
 
t
o buy her parents' f
ormer s
ervant, Mike, and h
is f
amily. The
 
b
lack f
a mily had been s
old t
o a neighboring p
lanter after t
he
 
parents' death. Sarah knew t
he owners; s
he a
lso knew t
he s
lave
 
f
amily very well. She c
alled Mike's wife and children by na me
 
and was f
amiliar with t
he s
kills of t
he two s
ons. Clearly Mike
 
had become t
he custodian of Sarah Gayle's l
onging f
or her own
 
fa mily.  Mike could r
e me mber her a
s she "used t
o be."
 
Although Mike and h
is fa mily were b
lack s
laves, Sarah
 
c
onsidered t
hem "

I
ndustry for Dew d
id not entail going t

The current period o

The Festival, t

with a new profession: public s

Growth of online systems.  During t

online databases have p

he e
arly s
ixties, companies began t
o u
se
 
c
omputers s
imply t
o help p
roduce p
rinted i
ndexes and abstracts
 
more efficiently.  The online database was basically a
 
s
econdary by-product. I
n 1
965, t
here were f
ewer t
han twenty
 
publically available databases i
n existence, and most of t
hese
 
were not accessible t
hrough online t
echniques. By 1
980 t
here
 
were approximately 400 databases, about half of which were
 
available online.  S
ince t
hen, g
rowth has been t
remendous, s
o
 
t
hat by January, 1
986, over 3
,000 online databases were being
 
offered t
hrough over 450 database s
ervices (
vendors). Some,
 
l
ike ABI/INFOR M, a business r
esearch f

print hard copy a
t a

sed t

only a few t

t
oday are adding approxi mately half a million r
eferences
 
annually.

J

John Thibaut, Alumni Distinguished Professor Emeritus
 
of Psychology a
t UNC-CH
, d
ied February 19, 1986 after a
 
l
ong i
llness. Thibaut was founder and developer of t
he
 
university's s
ocial p
sychology p
rogram, now i
n i
ts 3
1st y
ear,
 
and founding editor of t
he Journal of Experimental Social
 
PsvcholoRv now i
n i
ts 2
1st y
ear. The a
rticle by Sarah Friday
 
and Richard Smith was based on Friday's i
nterview with
 
Thibaut, and t
he address by John Schopler was delivered a
t a
 
memorial s
ervice f
or Thibaut February 2

Sarah Friday and Richard Smith
 
I
n t
he f
all of 1
946, J
ohn Thibaut, who had r
eceived a
 BA
 
i
n philosophy a
t UNC before t
he war, began g
raduate s
tudy a
t
 
t
he Research Center f
or Group Dynamics a
t MIT, f
ounded by
 
t
he German r
efugee Kurt Lewin. As Lewin's r
esearch a
ssistant,
 
Thibaut's j
ob was t
o walk with h
i m, l
isten t
o h
is r
esearch
 
p
lans, and, upon r
eturning t
o c
ampus, write t
hem down and
 
put t
he m i
nto t
heory. Such experiences, t
ogether with t
he
 
h
ighly i
ndividualized, r
esearch-based t
raining a
t t
he Center,
 
f
ostered an appreciation f
or t
he r
igorous b
lend of both t
heory
 
and r
esearch t
hat have marked h
is contributions t
o s
ocial
 
p
sychology.
 
Thibaut a
lso benefited f
rom t
he extraordinary g
roup o
f
 
f
aculty and s
tudents Lewin had a
ssembled a
t t
he Center. I
n
 
particular, h
is a
ssociation with Harold Kelley, now Professor
 
of Psychology a
t UCLA, was s
ingularly fortunate and
 
p
rophetic, f
orming t
he basis f
or a
 l
ifelong c
ollaboration despite
 
being s
eparated by a
 c
ontinent f
or t
he l
ast 2

ears.
 
Thibaut's I
nfluence on Social Psychology
 
Kelley has noted how Thibaut's e
arly papers with Henry
 
Riecken on perception of s
ocial c
ausality and with L
loyd
 
S
trickland on surveillance and t
rust i
nfluenced h
is own
 
thinking on s
ocial a
ttribution processes.  These papers
 
undoubtedly l
eft t
heir imprint on Ned Jones a
s well. During
 
t
he years when t
hese papers were published, Jones was a
 
g
raduate a
ssistant with Thibaut a
t Harvard and t
hen a
 
colleague a
t neighboring Duke University s
oon a
fter Thibaut
 
had s
et up shop a
t UNC-CH.  Both Kelley and Jones were t
o
 
spearhead t
he develop ment of t
he a
ttribution f
ield t
hat
 
dominated s
ocial p
sychology during t
he 1
970s.
 
The f
ra mework developed by Thibaut and Kelly i
n The
 
Social Psychology of Groups (
1959), u
ses t
he payoff matrix a
s a
 
device t
hat co mbines t
he possible  r
esponses i
ndividuals can
 
have t
o each o
ther t
o predict outcomes of t
heir r
elationships.
 
This approach a
llowed for r
epresenting t
he combination of
 
behaviors t
hat would be o
f g
reatest benefit f
or e
ach person and
 
s
uggested t
he l
ogical course of t
heir continued i
nteraction.
 
Concepts such a
s co mparison l
evel, fate control, behavior
 
control, and comparison l
evel f
or a
lternatives, now f
amiliar i
n
 
t
he s
ocial p
sychological c
anon, were i
ntegrated s
o s
uccessfully
 
t
hat t
his approach beca me t
he s
tandard against which t
o
 
co mpare subsequent efforts a
t r
epresenting i
nterpersonal
 
r
elations.
 
With t
he publication of Kelly and Thibaut's I
nterpersonal
 
Relations (
1978), another s
tandard was s
et. Whereas t
he f
irst
 
book was an approach t
o i
nterpersonal r
elations, t
he s
econd
 
book i
s a full-scale t
heory of i
nterdependence. The main
 
substance of t
he t
heory i
s an analysis of t
he s
tructure of
 
outco me matrices.  I
ncorporating concepts f
ro m t
he previous
 
book with o
ther s
tructural i
ndices, a t
axonomy of f
orms of
 
i
nterdependence r
esults, a
llowing further analysis of t
he
 
behavior s
uggested by t
he d
ifferent f
orms.
 
The t
heory's g
reatest s
trengths a
re t
hat i
t manages t
o be
 
syste matic, coherent, and co mprehensive.  Unlike o
ther
 
a
ttempts t
o analyze s
ocial i
nteractions t
hat t
end t
o address
 
r
elatively contained do mains, t
he t
heory i
s co mplex and
 
expansive enough t
o i

t
.
 
Lewin c
laimed t

ssence of a

o

a
lso knew t
hat a
 t
axonomy of i
nterdependent r
elationships was
 
an un met need within t
he s
ocial p
sychology o
f h
is day.  The
 
cu mulatively impressive s
tructure developed i
n I

o meet this need fro m the
 
fundamental perspective of i

and control.
 
Thibaut's emphasis on t
he
 
s
tructural o
rigins o
f s
ocial o
rder
 
can be i
llustrated by three
 
e
xamples: With Claude Faucheux
 
i
n 1963 a
t t
he Laboratoire de
 
Psychologie Sociale at the
 
Sorbonne, Thibaut analyzed
 
conditions  leading  to
 
contractural nor ms in a
 
bargaining s
ituation. They were
 
able t
o show t
hat t
he i
ntegrity of an i
nterdependent g
roup
 
could be maintained despite r
eal conflict of i
nterest and
 
d
ifference i

appeal t
o t
he nor m of l

he l
ow-powered member
 
made an appeal t
o t
he norm o
f f
airness.
 
With l
aw professor Laurens Walker i
n t
he 1
970s Thibaut
 
analyzed f
air procedures for r
esolving conflicts of i
nterest.
 
They developed an unprecedented j
oint p
rogram of r
esearch
 
designed t
o apply the methods of s
ocial psychology t
o
 
important problems i
n t
he s
tructure o
f l
egal decision-making,
 
r
esulting i
n Procedural Justice: A Psychological Analysis
 
published i
n 1
975.
 
Finally, with Chester Insko i
n r
ecent years, Thibaut
 
analysed t
he s
ocial evolution of l
eadership and of g
roup
 
p
rosperity. They s
imulated t
he manufacture and t
rading o
f
 
products between g
roups a
s a function of various power
 
r
elationships.

i
t was only one of many j
oint e
fforts t
hat l

Thibaut began h

t
urned t
o s
ocial p
sychology because i
t offered t
he advantage o
f

having this gathering.  He was a passionately, even

When John's r

n John and Hal's most r
ecent t
heoretical s
ystem,
 
people a
re t
hought t
o make i
nterpersonal choices not s
olely on
 
t
he basis of narrow, personal p
references, but by c
onsidering
 
t
he desires of o
thers. I
t i
s on t
his basis t
hat I
 f
eel confident
 
John would have u
lti mately switched h
is vote i
n favor of
 
holding t
his a
ssembly.
 
John was a child of t
he Great Depression and experienced
 
t
he consequences of an e
conomic and s
ocial s
ystem t
hat had
 
gone badly awry. This may well have been one of t
he driving
 
forces behind h
is i
ntense s
earch for order--order i
n t
he
 
r
ational mechanisms people devise f
or i
nteracting t
ogether and
 
o
rder i
n matters o
f t
he heart. I
n J
ohn's l
ife t
he two went hand
 
i
n hand.  Many i
nstances come t
o mind.  For example, John
 
beca me chair man of the depart ment after a period of
 
t
urbulence and exponential g
rowth.  Under J
ohn's l
eadership
 
t
he department was s
tabilized under c
onditions o
f cooperation,
 
work facilitation, and r
espect for i
ndividual d
ifferences. To
 
J
ohn's c
redit, t
hese conditions r
emain a
s v
ivid t
oday a
s when
 
t
hey were i
nstituted over 25 years ago.
 
I
t was patently obvious t
hat John was b
lessed with a
 
brilliant mind, which was harnessed by h
is compassionate
 
i
nvolve ment with o
thers.  He was t
he consu mmate colleague
 
and h
is p
roductive working r
elationships a
re l
egion. His work
 
with Hal Kelley warrants s
pecial note.  I
 know of no o
ther
 
partnership t
hat has endured s
o l
ong (
about 40 years), has been
 
s
o p
roductive (
2 books and numerous chapters and a
rticles), and
 
has been s
o consistently i
nnovative and had s
o much impact.
 
John and Hal not only theorized about productive
 
S
O
 Thi
 haul
 
i
nterpersonal r
elationships, t
hey l
ived t
hem.  John's p
rimary
 
mode of i
nfluence was by example, and t
he people he t
ouched
 
o
ften s
aw a
 better way o
f c
onducting t
heir l
ives.
 
I
t would be absurd t
o canonize John, because he d
id
 
possess s
ome human f
ailings. He c
ould r
arely be counted upon
 
t
o be t
he conveyor of bad news, e
specially not t
o g
raduate
 
s
tudents. More t
han once John was supposed t
o i
nfor m a
 
s
tudent t
hat s
ome hurdle had not been c
leared, only t
o have
 
the s
tudent l
eave t
he office f
eeling that a near r
ecord
 
perfor mance had been achieved.  His f
railities were i
n t
he
 
s
ervice of t
he heart and t
his t
ransfor med t
he m i
nto near
 
v
irtues. Whether working, c
elebrating, o
r p
laying volleyball, he
 
s
ometimes went t
o excess. I
 r
emember a t
ime when John, Chet
 
and I
 were going t
o l
unch a
t what was t
hen Harry's deli. As
 
we approached Franklin S
treet, John bolted ahead t
o an
 
open-air booth collecting money f
or underprivileged children.
 
J
ohn s
aid, "There i
s our s
tudent, Alice Ray; I
 don't know what
 
s
he i
s collecting money for, but we s
hould s
upport her." To
 
ur amaze ment, John dashed t
o t
he booth and emptied h
is
 
ockets i
nto t
he charitable container held by Alice.  What
 
s
tounded u
s was not t
hat John was helping, but t
hat he was
 
n
tering h
is own experi ment. The "
charity" was one he and
 
l
ice had i
nvented t
he p
revious week i
n o
rder t
o do a f
ield
 
udy of a
ltruism, and John had j
ust made chaos of a
 r
andom
 
s
equence o
f manipulations.
 
John was a modern Renaissance man, with a s
ense of
 
hu mor.  His a
rena was t
ruly i
nternational. He and Ann c
ame
 
t
o l
ove France and f
elt a
s much a
t home i
n Paris o
r i
n a
 small
 
Nor mandy f
ishing v

n Boston o
r Chapel Hill.  John
 
l
ived f
or i
deas and f
or t
heir c
onsequences.  Education, i
n h
is
 
v
iew, i
s a process t
hat makes personally r
elevant what i
s not
 
immediate. He was devoted t
o t
he University o
f North North
 
Carolina f
or i
ts dedication t
o t
his p
rocess. J
ohn had d
iscerning
 
t
astes i
n music, wine, f
ood, a
rt and s
ports. At one t
ime he was
 
an accomplished a
lto s
axophonist and he l
oved both j
azz and
 
c
lassical music. He could debate t
he l

with a

Prothro.
 
By the end of his t

"Well, you go f

 will r
ead an a
rticle f
rom t
he
 
"American Political S
cience Review" a
t yours."
 
I
t was a t
hreat of s
ufficient magnitude t
o keep me on my
 
d
iet f
or a
 week.
 
We spent hundreds of hours working t
ogether on t
he
 
t
extbook on t
he d
ining r
oom t
able on E
lliot Road. Fortified by
 
s
trong Colu mbian coffee s
upplied by Ana f
rom her homeland,
 
J
im t
ore i
nto t
he manuscript f
or weeks l
ike a
 man possessed.
 
How he l
oved t
he l
anguage! How he r
elished t
he beauty o
f
 
a
 f
inely c
rafted s
entence. He t
reated bad s
tyle, h
is and anyone
 
e
lse's with no mercy. Both S
trunk and White l
ived i
n h
is s
oul,
 
92
 Prothro
 
and he spent a
s much t
ime i
n t
he d
ictionary l
ooking up
 
"
insure" with "
i" and "
ensure" with "
e" a
s he d
id hating t
he
 
i
ndefinite articles "
there" and "
it" with a passion t
hat he
 
u
sually r
eserved f
or Republicans.
 
As he was s
lashing away one n
ight on my meager offering,
 
I
 s
houted, "
Stop! You've l
eft me only t
hree conjunctions and a
 
f
our word phrase on t
his page!" Softly he s
aid, "Let me s
ee t
he
 
f
our word phrase."
 
After an e
specially brutal s
ession another t
i me, I
 
co mplained, "Da mn you.  I
 got out of here t
onight with only
 
t
hree "
ands" and a
 "
but." "
Be happy," he s
aid, "
that you got out
 
o
f here with your but."
 
But when the t
extbook made i
t t
o t
he t
op by being
 
photographed under the broad bare botto m of a co-ed
 
c
enterfold i
n P
layboy magazine, he was g
racious. "Richardson,
 
your paragraphs got u
s t
here."
 
After he had anguished a s
ection of writing i
nto
 
perfection, he delighted i
n r
eading i
t t
o you.  Anyone.  Poor
 
Ana.
 
Once a f
reakish s
nowstorm c
ame t
o Chapel Hill and f
illed
 
t
he s
treets. We had a
 s
ession s
cheduled a
t 1

. M
. I
 a
ssumed
 
i
t was cancelled and s
ettled myself i
n f
or a
 l
azy day i
n f
ront
 
o
f t
he f
ireplace.
 
"Cancelled?" he s
aid i
ncredulously on t
he t
elephone, "
of
 
c
ourse not. I
'm coming over."
 
"But t
he s
treets a
re full of s
now, J
im. You will never g
et
 
out o
f your driveway."
 
"No p
roblem," he s
aid, "
I
'm j
ogging."
 
Wet, muddy, he t
ore o
ff h
is s
ocks and r
eplaced t
hem with a
 
pair of my s
on's and b
reathlessly r
ead me a
 new i
nterpretation
 
o
f e
lectoral methods a
s i
nstitutions of politics r
ather t
han a
s
 
s
imple mechanistic devices o
f government. Racing t
hrough t
he
 
s
now-filled s
treets of Chapel Hill with t
he chapter against h
is
 
chest, he had captured (
is "
captured" t
he r
ight word, J
im, o
r
 
s
hould I
 r
ecast i
t and u
se "metaphor?") i
n t
he act two of t
he
 
t
hings he l
oved t
he most--racing i
n t
he winter wind with
 
political s
cience, handcrafted and hand delivered.
 
I
f writing s
tyle was a
 passion, political s
cience was a l
ove.
 
He was unlike Higgins i
n "My Fair Lady" who a
sserted, "The
 
French don't care what they do, r
eally, a
s l
ong a
s they
 
p
ronounce i
t correctly." J
im not only wanted political s
cience
 
t
o be p
ronounced, t
hat i
s
, written, correctly, but he a
lso wanted

i
ts content t
o be excellent.  Clean variables. Measurable
 
hypotheses. Creative t
heory.  C
lear r
elationships. Provocative
 
c
onclusions. He d
id not write 5
0 a
rticles and 3
 books because
 
he had t
o.  He d
id i
t because he believed h
is d
iscipline was
 
important.
 
And every s
tudent o
f h
is knew h
is c
ommitment t
o s
cience.
 
In h
is honors courses he worked over s
tudent proposals a
s
 
t
hough t
hey were candidates for NSF funding.  Oh, he had
 
t
ime for a l
ittle f
rivolity.  On an opening day of a course a
 
s
tudent a
sked h
im, "Dr. Prothro, what i
s your policy on c
lass
 
a
ttendance?" Without missing a beat, J
im r
eplied, "
I p
lan t
o
 
come a
s o
ften a
s I
 c
an."
 
With a deep commitment t
o writing and political s
cience,
 
he was no l
ess commited t
o l
iving l
ife fully. At i
ts widearmed
 
best. He r
aced a
long t
he o
cean, P
iedmont and mountains o
r on
 
t
he s
treets f
rom a
 convention hotel. He l
oved games, t
ennis,
 
basketball, chess, board games and t
hrived on c
ompetition. He
 
g
rabbed f
or t
he new t
o t
ouch a

f h
is
 
i
nsatiable curiosity f
or l
ife c
aused h
i m once o
r twice t
o be a
 
l
ittle t
rendy, he would be t
he f
irst t
o l
augh and r
ecognize i
t
.
 
Last year he s
aid t
o a colleague, "
I'm going t
o g
ive you my
 
Nehru j
acket and my l
ong gold chain. I
 don't t
hink t
hey a
re
 
c
oming back."
 
He l
oved b
ig Christmas t
rees and l
ittle g
randchildren. He
 
adored Ana.  He was proud of h
is daughters because he
 
believed t
hey were honest.  He l
oved t
urkey and dressing and
 
c
ollard g
reens. And b
irthday p
resents. And Thomas J
efferson.
 
He was deeply fond of h
is Princeton degree but despised I
vy
 
League a
rrogance. Once a
t a t
edious l
uncheon with a f
ellow
 
Princeton g
raduate who t
alked endlessly about Old Nassau, J
im
 
followed with a f
ifteen minute o

lightly pompous j
ob c
andidate with
 
degrees f
rom LSU, Yale and Harvard, "
I
'm impressed with your

f

J
i m was not a perfect human being.  He had weaknesses,
 
even a
s you and I
 a
re weak.  But he was a model for t
his

 The f

 In the space of two weeks after the

After World War  I
I,  the 50s and 60s skowed  saw an energetic movement
 
that was worldwide toward the re-establishment of national  identities
 
through the i
ntensive study ad and presentation of folk artists and
 
folk arts.
 I
n the United States,  for one,  people,  particularly on
 
college campuses,  d
iscovered that folk music was not only good but it
 
could a
lso  be popular.
 Throughout the world folk s
ingers and  folk
 
songs  became prominent and  it was  not long until  the commercial
 
entertainment b
usiness became aware of the phenomenon and took it over
 
Academic  F
olklore.
 
Centralization.
 The current period of activity in public folklore
 
actually began about 20 years ago and has  spread to many arenas. 
Tke
 
m A most notable s
ite of new activity has been the National  Mall  in
 
Washington,  D
.C.  where the Smithsonian Institution decided to stage an
 
annual  festival  of American Folklife.
 W
ith such a prominent and
 
central  location, most v
isitors to the capital  can  h
ardly m
iss  it.
 The
 
F
estival,  thus,  h
as received a great deal  of well-deserved  positive
 
p
ublicity,  from the mass media to grass-roots word-of-mouth.
 During
 
the same period,  folklorists a
lso pushed to establish a folklife
 
center in Washington where scholas could come and do research.
 Such
 
a Center is now thriv ing at the L
ibrary of Congress -
-
 the American
 
F
olklife Center,  now including as well  the Archive of Folk Culture.
 
The NEA and Decentralization.
 Acother interesting development
 
during this  period was the establishment of the National  Endowment for
 
the Arts
 and the National  Endowment for the Humanities during the l
ate
 
1960's.
 The Humanities  Endowment  has sponsored various folkloric
 
research projects,  but in the organizational  statement of the National
 
Endomwnet for the the Arts was the statement that folk arts must be
 
included a
long w
ith the more conventional  art forms -
-
 theatre,
 
opera,  l
iterature and the l
ike.
 The NEA structure  h
as a
llowed the
 
development of the F
olk Arts Program which has utilized  federal  grant
 
money to set up state f
olk arts  programs a
ll  Over the country,  resulting
 
in a decentralization of public sector activity.
 Unlike the days of
 
the WPA,  the word no longer comes down from Washington.
 Instead,  we,
 
in Washington,  get the word from professionals  in the f

 If we look back then on the development
