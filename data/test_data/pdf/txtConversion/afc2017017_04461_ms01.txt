[0:00:22] (KS) My name is Kim Stryker. Today is Tuesday, February 20, 2018. The time is 
almost 10:30 in the morning and I’m sitting in the home of Amy Denton. She is the 
owner/operator of Divine Wine Tours. We’ll just talk a little about what it is you do. You were 
telling me a little bit how you got started with doing wine tours in Virginia. Tell me a little about 
that again. 
[0:00:55] (AD) My husband and I are musicians. We moved to the area in 2012. We started to 
play as a duo at all the local wineries. At that point there were, I don’t know how many, but it’s 
just blown up since then. Every weekend it seemed like a new winery was opening. We started to 
realize just how huge this industry was going to be. We love wine. We love all the people that 
are in the wine industry, so we just fell in love with the whole thing. During that time we were 
playing a gig and a couple came and they asked us to play their wedding rehearsal. Their names 
are Dave and Candy Dougherty and they founded Divine Wine Tours of Virginia. They owned it 
for the first few years. We became really good friends and over time, he’s a start up guy. He 
loves starting businesses and selling them and starting another business. He easily gets burnt out. 
He’s very ADD. He decided to offer it to us, because he thought that this would be something 
great for me to do. Luke and I were already sort of in the industry. I had just had my baby and I 
wanted to do something from home. I was teaching before and it was going to be too much for 
me to go to work and have the kid at home. So we decided to take the risk and we’ve now owned 
it for 2.5 years. That’s about it.

[0:02:37] (KS) And you’ve been happy with it? 
[0:02:39] (AD) Yeah, we love it. Since we took over business has tripled. I don’t know how 
much that has to do with us, or that it has to do with that the wine industry just continues to blow 
up in Virginia. We got in at the right time. When Dave and Candy started the company they were 
the only wine tour in all of Virginia. 
[0:03:00] (KS) I think I actually met him somewhere years ago and I was like, how interesting. 
[0:03:12] (AD) I was really hoping he could join us today. He lives down the street. They just 
happened to move into the neighborhood. He still drives for the company, because he still loves 
it, but he 
[0:03:22] (KS) He didn’t want to do the whole admin thing. 
[0:03:24] (AD) Exactly. He’s very good at branding and all that. To me, he did all the hard work. 
That was getting the company started and getting the client base and getting the website, all of 
that stuff. And then I just got to take over. 
[0:03:40] (KS) Do you recall when he started it? 
[0:03:44] (AD) 2013. 
[0:03:49] (KS) And then you bought it when? 
[0:03:51] (AD) 2015. 
[0:03:56] (KS) So Luke is your husband? And his last name is Denton as well? 
[0:03:59] (AD) Yes. 
[0:04:04] (KS) As you said before we started taping, and then I gave up my dream of being a 
musician, but you got to do it for a while, so that’s pretty great. 
[0:04:15] (AD) We did, yeah. We had so much fun. We lived in Austin. Luke and I moved there 
separately to pursue our music careers and we met there, but we both happened to be from 
Virginia. We really lucked out when we were ready to settle down and get married we moved 
back to Virginia where our families are. 
[0:04:38] (KS) So you grew up where? 
[0:04:40] (AD) In Woodbridge. And he grew up in Roanoke. 
[0:04:45] (KS) And you still have all family around here?

[0:04:48] (AD) Yep. My mom and dad are here and his parents are still in Roanoke. And when 
we first moved to Loudoun we were playing every weekend. I think our name was pretty well 
known in the area. I think we got pretty burnt out from being background music at wineries and 
we stopped enjoying it as much. For us we didn’t want to stop loving music. So we took that as a 
sign that it was time to slow down with that. My husband still, he’s basically a full time musician 
in the sense that he’s a music teacher during the day and then he has his own recording 
engineering company. It’s called Media Cure Music and he records all of the assessments and 
concerts and everything for Loudoun County. He creates CDs and DVDs and sells them to all the 
families. He still does music full time and I think he loves that part of it, but the performing, we 
just kind of got a little burn out from. Now we’ll play maybe five times a years, just to do it. 
We’ve written so many songs and we hate for them to not be out there. It’s a fun break for us. 
We get a babysitter and we go out for the day and play some music and it doesn’t feel like work. 
 
[0:06:19] (KS) And instead of having to pay a big bill at the end of your date night you’re 
actually getting paid. 
 
[0:06:24] (AD) The goal is always at least to make enough to pay the babysitter and for some 
wine. 
 
[0:06:32] (KS) Do you remember what was the first winery that you played at? 
 
[0:06:38] (AD) Actually, the first place that we played at in Loudoun was the Wine Kitchen in 
Leesburg, which is a little restaurant known for having really great wine flights. They’re real 
supportive of Virginia Wine. The first winery we ever played at was I think The Barns at 
Hamilton Station. The manager Susan over there, she is now a very close partner of ours for 
Divine Wine Tours. We still play there every once in a while. We’ll play there in April. 
 
[0:07:17] (KS) I went to a wedding there. It’s a really charming spot. 
 
[0:07:19] (AD) It’s very cute. It’s one of my favorites. I love the atmosphere there. 
 
[0:07:25] (KS) It’s really nice. They just won something. Last year they had one of the top 
wines. 
 
[0:07:29] (AD) They did. One of their reds. 
 
[0:07:33] (KS) Do you know what Susan’s last name is? 
[0:07:34] (AD) Pratt. 
[0:07:38] (KS) When do you think that was, that you probably played for them? 
 
[0:07:42] (AD) That would be 2012, right when they opened. That might have been 2013. We 
were one of their first musicians to play and now they’re a destination for scene music. Once a 
quarter they have something in the evenings called, I can’t remember. They’ll bring in a pretty 
well known musician and close down the winery to the public. You have to buy tickets.

[0:08:20] (KS) It’s almost become like a venue 
 
[0:08:21] (AD) Exactly. It’s really fun. John Carol plays there. I don’t know if you know him. 
He’s a really well known piano player from way back. He was actually in the band that did that 
song ‘Afternoon Delight.’ 
 
[0:08:43] (KS) Does he live around here? 
 
[0:08:45] (AD) He did. He now lives in Massachusetts, but he comes back to play. 
 
[0:08:50] (KS) There’s always these random celebrity people that have some kind of connection 
here. It’s odd. So you were a school teacher, second grade, a musician, and when you were 
growing up in Woodbridge, obviously you were growing up, so you weren’t of drinking age, but 
what role did wine have? Did your family ever drink wine? Do you remember going with your 
family to anything? 
 
[0:09:17] (AD) No, not really. I know my parents drank wine, but it wasn't a huge part of my 
life. I didn’t really get into wine until I moved to Loudoun County. That’s when we fell in love 
with it due to all of our gigging at all of the wineries. 
 
[0:09:36] (KS) Like in Austin you were more of a beer or mixed drink girl? 
[0:09:40] (AD) Yeah, beer. 
[0:09:47] (KS) What surprised you about falling in love with wine in Virginia? What is it about 
Virginia wine? 
 
[0:09:58] (AD) I think that it’s the atmosphere and the feeling of being at a winery, so relaxing. I 
love all of the work that goes behind creating a bottle of wine. These people are artists. The way 
that they make all of these bottles in similar ways, but they all turn out different. It’s just really 
neat. I love that it’s such a, it’s known to be such a fancy thing to drink wine, but the farmers 
behind it who make wine, they’re about as not fancy as you can get. They’re really farmers. One 
of the places we go to, Fabbioli Cellars, Doug Fabbioli. He’s kind of the self proclaimed 
Godfathers of Virginia wine. He’s one of the original wine makers in Loudoun County. I always 
told our groups to actually look outside, because you’re going to see a guy all covered in mud 
with boots on and that is the owner and the Godfather of Virginia wine. It’s nothing fancy. He’s 
out there working in the fields everyday to make this wine. 
 
[0:11:12] (KS) I think people would be really surprised by how many of the owners of the 
wineries are actually out there pruning and spraying and doing all the different work. 
 
[0:11:22] (AD) They truly love what they do. They do it for the wine. There are very few of 
them that do it for the money. The money is a nice perk, but I think they all did it because they’re 
in love with the whole creation process.

[0:11:37] (KS) How did you, were the relationships already established with the different 
vineyards? 
 
[0:11:40] (AD) Some of them. Actually, most of them. Either I had relationships with them 
through music or Dave had already created really great relationships. Since I took over the 
company I would say I’ve developed close relationship with maybe three more relationship than 
those he established. I really took off where he left off. 
 
[0:12:06] (KS) So just continued and grew it from there. 
[0:12:08] (AD) Yes. 
[0:12:09] (KS) So tell me a little about the wine tour. What is it that you do? 
 
[0:12:13] (AD) It’s an all inclusive wine tour, which means that the transportation is included, 
the tasting fees are included, lunch for each person, bottled water throughout the day, our tour 
guides go along with them. On the way to the wineries they give a run down on the history and 
current events in Virginia wine. They take photographs all day with a professional grade camera. 
A couple weeks after the tour the clients will get those photos to keep and do with what they 
want. I do all of the planning and reservations. When somebody books with us they don’t have to 
worry about anything else. They just know that they’re going on a wine tour. Sometimes they’ll 
have an idea of where they’ll want to go. I’ll send them wherever they want to go, but we have 
our nine partner wineries that we try to work with all the time, because we know that they’ll do a 
great job. We know what to expect. And I like developing those close knit relationships, 
fostering them. It just makes our lives easier. 
 
[0:13:25] (KS) Who are the different? 
 
[0:13:26] (AD) Our main route that we go to almost every weekend is Zephaniah Farm 
Vineyard. 
 
[0:13:34] (KS) In Leesburg. 
[0:13:37] (AD) Bill and Bonnie. 
[0:13:39] (KS) I just talked to Tremain. 
 
[0:13:41] (AD) Tremain is Bill and Bonnie’s son. Zephaniah to Stone Tower and on that route 
we usually end at the Barns at Hamilton Station. Sometimes Willow Croft. 
 
[0:14:05] (KS) I love Willow Croft. That’s off in the, it used to be off a pretty windy road. 
 
[0:14:11] (AD) It is. And Willow Croft is the original Loudoun County winery. They were the 
very first one.

[0:14:18] (KS) I think a million years ago I looked at that place for a wedding. Stone Tower, 
Barn, and then ending at one of these? 
 
[0:14:26] (AD) Yeah and that’s if we do three. A lot of times we do two winery routes and then 
we’ll do three wineries routes for people if they want them. We’ll never visit more than three, 
because we want to give a very in depth experience and it’s more about the learning experience. 
We consider ourselves a wine education tour. It’s not a party bus. We don’t want people drinking 
too much. Any more than three we’ve found that a) people are exhausted and b) people have had 
too much to drink. 
 
[0:15:02] (KS) And that’s a big issue in what you’re trying to do isn’t it? Because a lot of 
vineyards have now forbid any multi-passenger vehicles. 
 
[0:115:11] (AD) We have worked really hard to keep ourselves known as a wine education tour, 
not a party bus. We are even pretty strict about which bachelorette parties we’re even going to 
take. I make sure they know that there is no drinking in our vehicles and we don’t like to have all 
the paraphernalia that they bring along. None of that. We’re not walking into a winery with a big 
penis blow-up thing. 
 
[0:15:46] (KS) I’ve been there. Yep. 
 
[0:15:49] (AD) I have too. I went on a winery tour for my bachelorette party and looking back, 
now that I do this, I’m mortified. Because those wineries probably hated us. 
 
[0:16:05] (KS) No drinking in the vehicles. What other kind of rules? No penis paraphernalia, an 
important distinction. 
 
[0:16:13] (AD) We don’t, obviously, any outside alcohol is not allowed on any of the properties 
we visit. It’s illegal, first of all, and second of all the wineries would be furious with us. 
 
[0:16:27] (KS) But people do try to do it. 
 
[0:16:29] (AD) They do. They try to sneak it from us in the vehicle. We’re like, our tour guide is 
driving. We can look in the rearview mirror and see you. We’ve had a girl that filled one of those 
coffee mugs with alcohol and tries to sneak it in. We’re not dumb. We’ll figure it out. It’s not 
that we’re, it sounds like we’re super strict, but people have a great time. We just make sure they 
know from the start what our rules are. It’s not a party bus. If you want a party bus then there are 
plenty of places that do that. I had a girl just last week call me and one of the first things she said 
was, my main goal is to get the bride drunk. I told her, you might be calling the wrong company. 
I was like, I hate to turn away business, but we’re a wine education tour and our partners don’t 
like that sort of attitude. I just like if that’s what you’re looking for you might want to call a limo 
company. We lost a client, but that’s okay. 
 
[0:17:32] (KS) You would have gotten a bad review. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[0:17:34] (AD) Exactly. That route is the storybook tour. That’s the name of that one. The reason 
we call it that is that both Zephaniah and Stone Tower tell fantastic stories. Especially 
Zephaniah. Have you been there? 
 
[0:17:53] (KS) I haven’t, no. 
 
[0:17:55] (AD) That’s my favorite winery in Loudoun County. Their wine is awesome. The 
family has lived on the property since the early 1800s. They used to be a dairy farm. Tre 
probably told you. Or a meat farm. 
 
[0:18:08] (KS) Yeah, they were dairy and meat. 
 
[0:18:12] (AD) In the early 2000s to save their family farm they had to join in on the wine 
industry. They are there every weekend. We go there before they even open. They bring our 
groups into this special area in this old house and they do their tastings seated at the dining room. 
It’s such a cool experience. They tell all their stories of their whole family. Everybody who is in 
that family has gotten married on that land. They have all the pictures lined up. It’s so fun. The 
stories there are great. They even have ghost stories. It’s so fun. And then Stone Tower, I love 
going from Zephaniah to Stone Tower, because it’s such a contrast. It’s like going from a family 
farm vineyard to the Taj Mahal of the wineries. It’s fun to show people what the two types, the 
two extremes of wineries you can see. Stone Tower is absolutely gorgeous and an awesome 
experience in and of itself. They do a great job of explaining the whole winemaking process. 
They take our tours on a vineyard tour through the vines. They do their tastings while walking 
through the vines and through their production area, which is so neat. You’re going to get an 
experience there that you’re not going to get anywhere else. To sort of tone things down a little 
bit we usually end at Barns, because it’s a great place to relax. People are usually done learning 
by then. They get to sit on an Adirondack chair and listen to live music and chill. Willow Croft is 
a quiet winery. That’s another option if people don’t want live music. Barns can get kind of loud. 
It just depends on the group. I’ll always kind of ask them what do you prefer. 
 
[0:20:10] (KS) Nobody used to have music. That was, the beginning ways of all of this, having 
live, maybe if you were getting married you were bringing a band, but they didn’t think to have 
their own. 
 
[0:20:22] (AD) And then a couple of them jumped on it. Barns was one of the first. Now almost 
everyone has music. Zephaniah doesn’t, Willow Croft doesn’t, but I can’t really think of anyone 
else who doesn’t, maybe Fabioli. Most of them do. 
 
[0:20:38] (KS) You have that tour, the storybook tour. What other tours do you? 
 
[0:20:43] (AD) We have the elevation tour. That’s on the other side of Leesburg, more toward 
Lovettsville. We try to make little pockets, because we don’t want people to have to be in the 
vehicle for so long. More than 15 minutes drive is too long for us between wineries. Over in that 
region we start at Fabioli Cellars and then it goes to Tarara and then Creek’s Edge. That one’s 
fairly new. I want to say it’s four years old, three years old, really, really pretty.

[0:21:29] (KS) But like you said, how do you even keep up with, they open all the time. 
 
[0:22:34] (AD) There’s so many. That one, I honestly don’t even know why Dave named it the 
elevation tour, so I can’t explain that, but we still call it that. That one is less of a learning 
experience as the storybook. If I have a group of people who haven’t seen each other in five 
years I would more likely say the elevation tour, because I know they’re going to want to chat 
more and learn less. I’ll ask them, kind of get their vibe for what they’re looking for. If they’re 
just looking for a little more time to hang out with each other, then the elevation tour is a better 
choice. The tastings are still great, but there’s not as much of a tour. They’re not being walking 
around places. 
 
[0:22:19] (KS) This is a group that already has a lot of rapport and gets along really well. They 
may want to do more of their own thing. But if it’s a business group or a group who don’t know 
each other that well you want to do the more talky one. 
 
[0:22:30] (AD) Exactly. That one and usually if we only do two it would be Fabioli and Creek’s 
Edge. Tarara’s the third. And then we have one other route that’s in Fauquier. We haven’t come 
up with a name for it yet, because we don’t use it all that often. But if, say I have a Warrenton 
pickup and I don’t want to drive them all the way to Loudoun, it goes from Pearmund Cellars to 
Vint Hill Craft Winery and then it either ends at Granite Heights or Bull Run. 
 
[0:23:22] (KS) That’s the Fauquier route. So closer to Warrenton, the southern part of the 
county. 
 
[0:23:30] (AD) Yeah, and then, like you said, we’ll visit anywhere and we definitely have other 
wineries thrown in there about once a month, but those are the main wineries that we work with. 
 
[0:23:44] (KS) Talk about going back to the whole thing of figuring out your group and what 
you’re after, like you said there was the woman who was like, I want to get the bride drunk. So 
the niche for you, are there actual companies that go around with party buses to the wineries? 
 
[0:24:04] (AD) Yes, but most wineries don’t allow them to come anymore. Stone Tower, for 
example, the way they push people out is they just upped their prices so much that people don’t 
want to pay it. Their reasoning for that is that they know there are people who are still going to 
want that experience and they’re still going to be willing to pay for it, but the people on party 
buses are not. There’s still, they were so busy that it was out of control. They needed to do 
something. Thankfully for us, they love our groups and they wanted us to keep coming, so they 
kept us at a price we can afford, but they didn’t do that for everybody. 
 
[0:24:50] (KS) What’s the size of your group usually? 
[0:24:53] (AD) Usually between 8 and 12. 
[0:25:00] (KS) It’s never like a, you're never bringing the whole town. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

[0:25:02] (AD) Well it is. We do, that’s our average. Every once in a while we’ll have a couple 
that’s on an anniversary private tour. Or we’ll have a corporate event where it’s got fifty people 
on it. We’ll probably do two to three corporate tours a month. That’s companies, usually during 
the week. They’re doing a team building wine tour. And then once a week we do a public tours. 
The public tours leave from the Reston Town Center and they go on either the storybook or the 
elevation route. That’s where a single person or a couple that doesn’t want to pay for a private 
tour can just book seats and then they meet up with people they don’t know and they all hop on 
the same bus. I fill it up to ten people and then they all go on a tour. We just do that to give 
people who don’t have a need for a private tour. Because it gets pretty pricey. If you’re only 
going to have two people on a private tour that’s expensive for us to run, so it gives them another 
option. 
 
[0:26:18] (KS) How much does it usually cost? 
 
[0:26:20] (AD) On the public tours it’s $145 a person and that visits three wineries. They’re out 
from 10:30 to 5. That is all inclusive. It includes the tastings, lunch, bottled water, everything. 
The private tours range, depending on how many people you have from $120 to $160 usually. Of 
course, if you’re only going to have two people on a private tour for the whole day that’s going 
to be $600 for the whole day, plus. It can get expensive if you’re only going to have two people. 
If there’s fifty people I could bring the price down to $90 a person. But I would say on average 
$120 to $160 per person. 
 
[0:27:14] (KS) Tell me about the different groups that approach you. We’ve talked about 
corporate clients doing big team building outings, but who else do you tend to get? 
 
[0:27:26] (AD) We get a lot of birthday parties. A lot of 40th birthday parties. We get 
bachelorette parties. We’ve had a couple of wedding parties where they’re getting married that 
weekend and all their families are in town. We even had, last year, we had a proposal tour where 
a guy took his fiancée, I guess girlfriend at the time, and surprised her. My tour guide tied the 
ring on a ribbon in the vines and they went on, oh my gosh. They went on the vineyard tour at 
Stone Tower and the tasting room associate was explaining the grapes at that vine and the ring 
was hanging there. It was so cute. 
 
[0:28:19] (KS) Did they have friends with them as well? 
 
[0:28:21] (AD) No, it was just the two of them and it was so nice, because our tour guides have 
the cameras. She captured the whole thing and beautiful pictures came out of that. Aside from 
that, a lot of girls day outs. I feel like a lot of times, we have at least a few groups of girls who 
get together every year to do this. They go on a different route every time. We have some regular 
clients who keep coming back. 
 
[0:28:57] (KS) Is there, would you say, do you have a type that your customers tend to be? 
 
[0:29:06] (AD) Women. I would say at this point, 90% of our clientele is women. In March 
we’re starting brewery tours. We’re just starting with one brewery tour. We’re going to go to 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Ono and Solace. We’re hoping that will bring men in a little bit. It’s mostly women going out to 
these places. 
 
[0:29:30] (KS) Or men and women together. 
[0:29:33] (AD) Exactly. 
[0:29:35] (KS) You could do combo, like wine and brewery tours. 
 
[0:29:38] (AD) We thought about that, but I just worry about the mixing of the alcohols on one 
tour. Luke, my husband, thinks it would be fun to do a battle of the sexes type tour, where they 
meet for lunch, but then the men go to the breweries and the women go to the wineries. But then 
some women like beer. It just kind of depends. 
 
[0:30:00] (KS) But that’s a way to keep everybody happy. That’s good to bring more men in. 
 
[0:30:06] (AD) But as far as type, I would say almost always its people interested in learning 
about wine. We don’t get too many young, young people. We get a lot of people in their mid- 
thirties to early sixties. That’s our average age group, I would say. I think the early twenties are 
going on the party buses, which is fine. It’s expensive. A lot of people can’t afford it when 
they’re younger. 
 
[0:30:49] (KS) Are they mostly from Loudoun as well? 
 
[0:30:54] (AD) No, they seem to be from all over the place. A lot of times people are traveling to 
DC from out of town. They’ve heard about the Virginia wine industry. They want to check it out 
and this is the best way for them to do it since we know the area. We get a lot of people from 
DC. We do a lot of Arlington, Alexandria pick-ups. It seems like there’s a lot of people there. 
There are people in Loudoun, but not as many as you’d think. I think it’s because all the people 
in Loudoun know all the wineries and they know where they go. They don’t need the tour as 
much. 
 
[0:31:30] (KS) They’re not as scared as going into Virginia as city people are. Do you get a lot of 
that? I feel like the city people are so like, where’s Loudoun? What is that? Is that a place? 
 
[0:31:40] (AD) Yeah, they’re always like, how long does it take to get there? I’m like, it’s like 
forty five minutes. It’s not that bad. 
 
[0:31:48] (KS) It’s going three blocks in DC is the same amount of time. I know. I have 
definitely a lot of DC friends who are terrified of the Virginia countryside, like it’s going to be, I 
don’t know what. This area, just driving into your neighborhood I’m like, where in the world am 
I? Because they’ve built these huge developments where it used to be just farms and then all of a 
sudden 500 homes or something like that. It’s a little disorienting, just because these big 
developments have gone in. We’re right next to South Riding, which was one of the first that 
went in like that. That was like, whoa, this is a big development.

[0:32:34] (AD) Our neighborhood, if you turn left and go on Braddock it takes a couple miles 
and there are farms. It’s really interesting. I would say that our sub development is the last 
suburban subdivision before you get into rural. But it scares me, because I think it’s just going to 
keep happening and I don’t know what’s going to happen with the wine industry that way. I 
don’t want to lose the wine country, but it’s hard to tell how quickly it’s going to grow with the 
homes being built like crazy. 
 
[0:33:09] (KS) And you see it with different suburbs. So Fauquier, in the northern part of 
Fauquier where a lot of the wineries are they are a lot more protective of the farmland and not as 
interested, they put up a lot of obstacles to big developments, but here in Loudoun, Loudoun’s 
kind of known for putting in a lot of new housing. And so people come here, because they want a 
new house. They want to build it to their specs. What are, is there any demographics in your 
groups that surprise you? Is it mostly white folks? Is it, do you get all kinds of people? 
 
[0:33:50] (AD) We get all kinds of people. It’s mostly either white or African American. We 
don’t get as many Indian people. That’s surprising, because there are so many Indian people 
here. 
 
[0:34:04] (KS) That’s a big surprise. I think people wouldn’t realize how Loudoun has such a 
huge density of South Asians. 
 
[0:34:10] (AD) We’re in the minority in our neighborhood, for sure. I would say, since I’ve been 
running the company, I’ve only had four or five Indian groups. We’ll have a couple Indian 
people who join the public tours, but as far as private groups, I’m surprised that there aren’t 
more. 
 
[0:34:30] (KS) I don’t think, maybe it’s wine drinking is not as established maybe culturally? I 
know it’s becoming huge. It’s one of the fastest growing demand centers for wine, but I don’t 
know if it’s traditionally as. It would be interesting to see how things change now that all these 
Indian people have found themselves living in the middle of Virginia wine country. Are they 
going to start developing more of an interest in that? 
 
[0:35:05] (AD) Definitely the vast majority are white people. 
[0:35:08] (KS) Korean? 
[0:35:10] (AD) No, never. 
 
[0:35:15] (KS) That’s really interesting, because Korean people tend to be real big foodies. It 
kind of surprises me that they wouldn’t be interested in that. 
 
[0:35:25] (AD) Again, maybe a couple on public tours, but no. I edit all the photos for the tours, 
so I always see everybody. I don’t necessarily meet them in person, but I talk to them and then I 
see everybody, so I definitely see the different groups. 
 
[0:35:38] (KS) And Latinos? Never? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[0:35:40] (AD) Some. Mixed in bachelorette parties or you know. I think wine tasting is like a 
white person thing. For now, but hopefully it will expand more. I saw this meme that was like, 
things white people do, and one of them was a bunch of people wine tasting. 
 
[0:36:10] (KS) That’s totally true. But it has become more, I think people are making inroads and 
becoming more, it’s opening up a bit more. I hope. I think. 
 
[0:36:23] (AD) We had a group of African American women that were doing a 40th birthday 
party. My husband was their tour guide and they were telling him, you need to tell Amy that we 
need to be the profile picture, the cover photo for Divine, because you need to be more diverse. 
And so of course I right away made it the cover photo and she wrote me and said, we’re so 
excited. But because she said that, I always think about that now when I’m putting up pictures. I 
never really thought about it before, I just picked whatever picture looked good, but now I’m a 
lot more careful, to put up photos of different people. 
 
[0:37:02] (KS) I’m looking at your flyer now. 
 
[0:37:04] (AD) Is it all white people? I don’t even know. 
 
[0:37:05] (KS) It’s mostly all white people. This woman looks like she might be Asian. And then 
there’s a guy who’s in shadow, so it’s hard to tell. But it looks like it’s mostly white folks, but 
this is Dave and Candy’s. 
 
[0:37:15] (AD) That was their flier. He had bought so much of that stuff that I haven’t even run 
out yet. 
 
[0:37:24] (KS) Right, you’re not going to throw money after it, but it’s interesting to think about 
that. If people don’t see themselves in it, then that’s not a thing for me. And Virginia does 
intimidate people as being a little more conservative and maybe old school. 
 
[0:37:42] (AD) And we don’t want to be like that. Hopefully we can change that. 
 
[0:37:48] (KS) There was this big controversy, just the last few weeks about Cox Farms. In my 
previous work I did pick your own orchards for my thesis work, in Fauquier. In a way, this is 
also kind of an agri-tainment business. It’s like farming. You’re really farming, but then part of 
what you’re doing is creating an experience for people and having this mystique around it that 
makes it seem like it’s not hard work. We recently had this controversy where Cox Farms, which 
is, 
 
[0:38:26] (AD) It’s right down the road. 
 
[0:38:28] (KS) Yeah, I passed it on the way in, that’s what made me think of it. And they had put 
something on their sign like, “resist white supremacy”, that was one of the signs. And it got this 
enormous amount of backlash and it’s been popping all up over national news feeds and stuff. 
What do you think about what that means about what’s going on out here? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[0:38:51] (AD) I love Cox Farms for that. I don’t know if you saw the post they wrote for that. I 
don’t know if you saw it. 
 
[0:38:57] (KS) I was all over it. I was like, yes, good, like, like 
 
[0:39:02] (AD) Same. I shared that. Basically, I feel like they said in that post what so many 
people want to say and can’t get the words. I just think it’s awesome that they’re so confident in 
what they believe in that they’re not worried about losing business over it, because they know 
what the right thing is and they’re willing to stick up for it. I think that’s awesome and I love that 
people pass it every single day on their way to work and have to see those signs, I mean, have to, 
but 
 
[0:39:35] (KS) I can’t believe how narrow that road is, that they haven’t widened that road yet, 
because it’s teeny, teeny, tiny. Even just when I was coming up there was so much traffic. 
 
[0:39:45] (AD) Did you have to go on that big curve? 
 
[0:39:47] (KS) Yeah, that crazy curve. I’m surprised they haven’t straightened some of that out. 
 
[0:39:50] (AD) Me too. Sometimes trucks go on there and they’re not supposed to and I have 
multiple times seen them stuck there. Because they can’t make the turn. It says not to go on that 
road, but they try. 
 
[0:40:06] (KS) The reason I bring up Cox Farms is just because they’re an institution here. 
They’ve been here for a very long time. It’s kind of ironic that their politics are sort of 
representative of the new influx of people to Loudoun and there’s this, a little bit of a clash of 
worlds. Because this was very rural, very conservative, very, I don’t know what you would 
describe this area as really. 
 
[0:40:44] (AD) Rich. 
 
[0:40:46] (KS) Yes, but there were some very poor people as well. But just, not metropolitan, not 
international, but now, like you said, the majority of people who live out here are Indian folks. 
There’s a real clash of worlds happening. 
 
[0:41:03] (AD) And there are a lot of young people, young families like us, that live here now 
because they’re that we can all afford. On my street we’re all the same age. Our kids are all the 
same age. So it’s really nice, but I do feel that there are the older people that have lived in 
Loudoun that are more conservative and then there are the younger people that are kind of, kind 
of changing it a little bit. 
 
[0:41:25] (KS) Yeah and just wanted to have a nice house with some space. It’s interesting 
what’s happening. Going back to wine, but I think all of it is important in the context of what’s 
going on out here. Why do you think wine is successful here? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[0:41:50] (AD) I think it has a lot to do with how gorgeous it is. The views, back to the whole 
feeling you get when you’re there. It’s just so relaxed. I don’t know. 
 
[0:42:05] (KS) Do you think it has something to do with how intense every other part of our lives 
are here? 
 
[0:42:11] (AD) Oh yeah that’s true. I’ve never really thought about it like that. 
 
[0:42:13] (KS) DC people tend to be so keyed up and type A and go go go. It’s a respite from the 
crazy life. Where do you see it going? 
 
[0:42:29] (AD) The company or the industry? 
 
[0:42:31] (KS) Your company, the industry. What does the future hold? 
 
[0:42:35] (AD) I see it continuing to grow, but that’s because I haven’t seen it slow down. Again, 
there are new wineries opening constantly and they’re immediately busy. I don’t, I think this is 
what people do on the weekends. I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. I hope that we 
continue to make a name for ourselves in the country as being a destination for wine, like another 
Napa. I know right now I think we’re number five. 
 
[0:43:12] (KS) I think in total production. 
 
[0:43:14] (AD) Yeah, number of wineries or something. 
 
[0:43:17] (KS) Well you’ve got Washington, Oregon, California is number one and then 
Washington, Oregon. Texas is up there. 
 
[0:43:20] (AD) New York. Texas is right behind us. Or it was, I don’t know if it’s surpassed us. 
 
[0:43:28] (KS) Texas and New York and Virginia. Somewhere in there. What do you think 
would be some of the limiting factors? What could impede the growth? 
 
[0:43:40] (AD) I think the build up of the suburban homes. Not that I’m not contributing to that 
issue, but. I think that the subdivisions just keep pushing more and more into the wine country. I 
worry that that will take away from the charm. I’m hoping that that will slow down and they can 
keep the wine county as is. But I feel like that would really kind of hinder it. What else? 
 
[0:44:15] (KS) Is there anything you’re seeing in the wineries that you think is bad for the 
industry? 
 
[0:44:23] (AD) No. 
 
[0:44:27] (KS) Because we talked a little bit about the party buses and that kind of thing. But you 
think that has its place? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
15 
 
[0:44:30] (AD) Well, that’s what I would say, but because the wineries are limiting that right 
now I feel like that’s not going to be a problem. The only problem is for people like me, who are 
running a company that is similar, but not a party bus, where I think sometimes we get lumped 
into that group and people might not give us a chance, because they think we’re a party bus, 
when we’re not. That could be a problem, but that’s why I have those relationships with my 
winery partners. They know what we do. I know what they do and we don’t have to worry about 
it so much. 
 
[0:45:08] (KS) Yeah, I was talking to Jim and Betsy Dolphin at Delaplane Cellars and they don’t 
allow limousines or any vehicles that are over six passengers or something like that. It’s the same 
exact thing. I can see, they would actually probably really like you, but they have created, it’s 
such a part of the culture there to not have anybody other than a group of four or something in 
there, that the wine club members will police it themselves. If they see somebody pull up they’ll 
be like, limo, limo, limo and they’ll run out and they’ll be like, no, no, no, no limos. Because 
they want to keep it what they like. 
 
[0:45:50] (AD) That was a problem for a long time. We know playing gigs, out at Creek’s Edge. 
They used to allow a lot of buses to come and the people that would walk in were out of control. 
That’s just totally, I can’t think of the right word. We definitely, I think one of the things that we 
have that other companies don’t is the tour guides. It’s kind of like a classroom of kids that don’t 
have a teacher. If they’re not having a teacher to monitor them they’re going more out of control. 
 
[0:46:35] (KS) That makes sense. I mean, the tour guide kind of sets the tone and says like, 
we’re going the more educational, sophisticated, grown up people’s kind of thing. 
 
[0:46:45] (AD) And they kind of give them their time lines, like you guys have 20 more minutes, 
so finish up that drink. It just has a little more organization to it than a party bus. The winery 
partners that we have know that we don’t have groups like that, so thankfully, whenever we visit 
a new place if they need a reference I can have them contact. We’ve actually gone to Delaplane a 
couple of times and I have a group going there on the third of March. So they do let us. I don’t 
know her very well at all, but I think she trusts me, because we’ve had a couple of groups there 
and they’ve been fine. Anybody who’s really nervous, I just send my groups to them first, 
because then I know. When they’re sober, when they haven’t had anything to drink yet. I know I 
can trust the groups and it will be fine. 
 
[0:47:33] (KS) Have you ever had a situation, I’m sure early on, you had some situations where 
people showed up drunk? 
 
[0:47:39] (AD) We have a couple of times. Ironically, it’s like the corporate groups where they 
drink the most. I feel like it’s because it’s their one time to get out there with their coworkers and 
they just go crazy. Those are the groups that try to sneak the alcohol onto the bus and we have to 
police them a little bit more. We’ve had groups that we’ve had to get on. But it doesn’t seem like 
it expects their experience. They understand. 
 
[0:48:10] (KS) So you haven’t had any big blowups. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
16 
 
[0:48:11] (AD) No, not at all. We’ve really only ever had maybe three people throw up in five 
years. 
 
[0:48:19] (KS) That is a really good success rate. You should really have that, you know how 
like a warehouse, number of accidents this year. Number of throw ups: three! 
 
[0:48:30] (AD) At least two of those were because the bachelorette parties had been drinking so 
much the night before. 
 
[0:48:40] (KS) Any special preparation that you had to do for this job? Did you mostly learn 
everything from him? 
 
[0:48:49] (AD) Yeah, I learned everything from him. For two months he was coming over a 
couple times a week and we were talking through everything. He was teaching me the system, 
taking me to wineries, introducing me to people he works with. At first I was super 
overwhelmed, because I had never even done sales, aside from selling my CDs. 
 
[0:49:10] (KS) Well you performed in public and were a teacher. 
 
[0:49:14] (AD) I like talking to people. I’m very outgoing. That part didn’t make me nervous, it 
was more like, how do I sell something and be successful at it. How do I carry myself as a 
business owner. All that. And he’s so good at it. He’s like a promoter. It made me nervous, 
because I was like, I can never be as good as Dave is. But I’m better than Dave at other things. 
With him teaching me that part of it and my organization skills it just came together really well. 
I’m trying to think of what, how else we. After a couple of months, maybe six months, I really 
had it down. At least the first couple of months whenever I’d answer a phone call I was so 
nervous. I was reading from a script to try to get these sales. Now I have the whole thing 
memorized and it’s very smooth. I’m confident. I understand everything. 
 
[0:50:19] (KS) How many tour guides do you have? 
[0:50:21] (AD) I have thirteen. 
[0:50:25] (KS) Oh my goodness. Are they full time employees or do they just do it case by case? 
 
[0:50:31] (AD) They’re independent contractors. The way that I book their groups, anytime I 
book tours, yesterday I booked three doors in the day for coming up in the future. I have a 
calendar and whenever I have an opening I put a highlighted space. Between 7 and 8 pm any 
given night I send an email to my whole staff and it has the schedule and the highlighted 
openings and then it’s first come first serve. Almost immediately it’s everyone’s replying all to 
try and snatch up whatever tours they can get. That’s it. I don’t really have to do any scheduling 
for my staff, because it’s up to them. I get bookings at random times, so it’s hard for me to put 
them on a schedule and say, you’re going to work every Saturday. I don’t know if I’ll have a tour 
for them every Saturday. 
 
[0:51:45] (KS) And they’re okay with that. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
17 
 
 
[0:51:47] (AD) Yeah. They all have other jobs. I make it very clear that this is occasional work, 
but there are very busy seasons. I have a ton of teachers that work for me, because it’s very busy 
in the summer and they’re not working. They work a ton for me in the summer. The hard part is 
the fall when I’m also super busy and the teachers are back to work. That’s when I’m scrambling 
a bit, but the size of my staff now is pretty good. I started with just Dave and Luke as my only 
tour guides. Now I’ve built it up to thirteen people, so I’m pretty much covered. 
 
[0:52:29] (KS) Where do you find them from? Do people come from the tours? Or the wineries? 
 
[0:52:33] (AD) I’ve hired at least one person who was on one our tours and she said, this looks 
really fun and then she contacted me. Other than that, Dave met somebody that worked at wine 
styles and thought they would be good. I met a tasting room associate at Willow Croft and she 
was looking for extra work. I hired her. And then I put a lot of, I found people on the Loudoun 
County jobs Facebook group. I just put up, I’m looking for tour guides with this type of 
personality. I’m very specific about the type of personality, because I feel like a tour guide can 
make or break a tour. I definitely want a certain type of person on it. I think that’s worked out for 
the most part. I have a couple of friends who work for me too. I can trust them and I know they’ll 
be fun. 
 
[0:53:25] (KS) What are the sorts of rules that you put in place for the tour guide? Are they 
driving as well? 
 
[0:53:33] (AD) They are, except for the buses. They drive anything from the SUVs to the fifteen 
passenger vans. 
 
[0:53:40] (KS) They don’t need a special license for those? 
 
[0:53:42] (AD) No, not for those. And then anything beyond that we work with a limo company 
that provides our buses. They have their drivers that come with them. In that case my tour guide 
is literally just a tour guide. They travel along and they talk to them, but they’re just along for the 
ride. 
 
[0:54:02] (KS) Since they’re independent contractors, how do you do the insurance? Is all the 
liability on you with the booking? 
 
[0:54:09] (AD) Yeah. We’ve got, we’re licensed and bonded. We have the insurance. We’re all 
covered and they’re 1099 employees. They’re all covered too. 
 
[0:54:26] (KS) So clearly they can’t drink when they’re on the job. 
 
[0:54:27] (AD) No. That a huge no no. That’s my biggest rule. Even when they’re on a bus they 
can’t drink. Even though they’re not driving I want them to be with it. 
 
[0:54:42] (KS) Somebody has to be. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
18 
 
[0:54:43] (AD) Yeah. Their duties are really to charm the groups, teach them a little bit about 
Virginia wine, keep them on schedule, get them set up and ready for lunch, and take pictures all 
day. That’s about it. They pick up the vehicles. We have a storage unit where all my tour guides 
have access to it. They go and pick up anything they need for the day, like cameras, memory 
cards, credit cards, wine bags. We give wine bags to each of our clients, so when they make 
purchases they can carry them. The reason we do that is to encourage people to buy wine at the 
wineries, because that’s a huge way to keep our partners happy, just by making sure their wine is 
sold. The tour guides are really pretty independent. I book them on their dates and they go from 
there. They keep in touch with me throughout the day, just to let me know how it’s going. I ask 
them to. I think about it. If I get a text like, everybody’s happy, then I can enjoy my weekend a 
little more. And then they also contact me when things go wrong. When things go wrong 
everybody has something go wrong at the same time on the same day. 
 
[0:56:05] (KS) Does your husband help? I know he does some of the tours, but does he help with 
other stuff or is it mostly your show? 
 
[0:56:12] (AD) He does all the tech stuff, all the website. He takes care of all the bills. He does 
quite a bit, but he doesn’t work with any clients. He doesn’t even do any tours anymore unless 
I’m scrambling. 
 
[0:56:31] (KS) The vehicles are they, do you own all the vehicles or do you lease them? 
 
[0:56:36] (AD) We own, well we lease the suburban that’s out front. We use that almost every 
weekend for tours. Other than that we rent. We work with Enterprise very closely. Enterprise, 
they see four of our tour guides a weekend. They know us very well. They have a stock of vans 
there that are really just for us. We only want to use Ford Transits. They have Chevies too and 
the Chevies suck. So they keep For Transits there for us. They’re really close partners of ours. 
We work with Z-Limos and that’s our bus partner. I think that people think that we own all the 
vehicles and that’s fine. I want people to think that and me saying it out loud, being recorded, 
I’m kind of like, probably shouldn’t have said that, but it’s the truth. 
 
[0:57:37] (KS) It’s pretty deep in. If somebody’s gotten to 57:50, what? Expose. 
 
[0:57:45] (AD) I don’t want the other tour companies to be like; oh we don’t have to own all 
these vehicles. 
 
[0:57:52] (KS) It makes sense, because of the wear and tear and everything. 
 
[0:57:54] (AD) And the insurance, through Enterprise it’s a little bit pricey, but it covers 
everything. I’ve had two tour guides now get side swiped and their side view mirror has been 
swiped off, because those back roads have been so tight. Nobody’s gotten hurt or anything, thank 
god, but I’ve never heard anything about it again, because I’ve paid for that insurance and it gets 
fixed. It’s off my hands. The only time I’ve ever had any issues with the suburban that we’re 
more responsible it was my fault. I was driving my son to preschool and I rear-ended somebody. 
I have no one to blame there but me. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
19 
 
[0:58:36] (KS) But you do have, I mean that’s one of the maybe drawbacks of this industry is 
that you have a lot of people out there who are not doing a tour who are just drinking all day. 
 
[0:58:49] (AD) It makes me nervous. When I first started that was one of my main concerns. 
How are we covered and how are all the people on our tours covered. To be honest Dave wasn’t 
doing a very good job with that. He was sort of winging it and he was taking a very big risk. I 
wasn’t willing to take any risks, because I wasn’t willing to have a successful business and then 
have it all fall apart on me one day when somebody gets an accident, so we made sure to cover 
all our bases. 
 
[0:59:22] (KS) Do the tour guides have some kind of a contract with you? 
 
[0:59:29] (AD) The contract basically is, we’re not going to drink on the tour, we’re not going to 
quit and start the same company. There’s not much to it. I do driving record checks to make sure 
they’re good drivers and make sure they’re good people and that’s kind of it. 
 
[0:59:47] (KS) Protect yourself. And what about for the customers? When they pay, is there kind 
of a code of conduct? 
 
[0:59:57] (AD) Yeah. It basically says you drinking too much is not our problem. We’re giving 
you the transportation so that you don’t have to drive, so please don’t get off of our vehicle and 
then drive. We’re pretty much covered, so if anything happens it’s not going to be our fault. 
 
[1:00:23] (KS) I know most of the wineries themselves have it publicly that Virginia law that 
says basically that you’re entering a farm business and your liability is at your own risk and blah 
blah blah blah blah. I know that’s how they tend to cover their own butts if anybody does 
something, but you do have windy roads and you do sometimes have gravel drives. Have you 
ever experienced something where a vehicle gets stuck, or a flat tire? 
 
[1:00:57] (AD) Yeah, we’ve had a big bus get stuck in the mud once during snowy season a 
couple of years back. The driver had to get out. It probably took twenty minutes for the bus to 
get moving again, so that was stressful. My husband was driving a 15 passenger once and was 
parking at Zephaniah and backed right into a big rock. That was the first accident we had ever 
had. It happens. It’s going to happen. You’re out in the country. 
 
[1:01:25] (KS) And now it’s on the record forever. He was the first one. But these are not major 
things. 
 
[1:01:36] (AD) No, they’re all little. Nobody’s ever gotten hurt thank god. I hope that never 
happens. 
 
[1:01:45] (KS) So we went over, so what’s the part that you enjoy the most about doing this 
business? 
 
[1:01:52] (AD) It would be a tie between working with the clients and trying to give them a super 
special day, for celebrations. Especially that proposal. That was huge. To set all that up for

him and then to watch it go off without a hitch, no pun intended. And then just being enveloped 
in the wine industry in general. There’s a lot of perks to it. Every time Stone Tower has an event 
they invite us as special guests. It’s just fun to be involved in that and get to do all those special 
things because we’re partners with wine country. Both of those aspects I love. 
 
[1:02:40] (KS) Is there a hardest part? 
 
[1:02:44] (AD) I think the hardest part is probably, has more to do with just running your own 
business and the risks that come with it. The fears of, oh what if this all comes to an end. Every 
Christmas things slow down. That happens every year, but I swear every year around New Years 
Eve I’m freaking out that we’re never going to get another phone call. And then it happens, but 
when it’s your own business those fears are always there. But as far as being in the wine 
industry, I guess a fear would be something going wrong and then making the wineries mad. If 
someone drank too much or something. 
 
[1:03:30] (KS) Bad reviews. That seems to be the real weapon of choice these days is the bad 
yelp review. 
 
[1:03:40] (AD) Back to Cox Farm, I saw that anybody that disagreed with them, which, who 
would do that? They would go and write these bad reviews for them and that’s scary. 
 
[1:03:52] (KS) And it was such a concerted effort. Every single thing was like a one star review 
and it really didn’t say anything about the service they offered there. It was all politically 
motivated. That kind of can also backfire, because it’s obvious that you don’t know what you’re 
talking about, you’ve probably never been there, and you’re just part of a campaign. 
 
[1:04:15] (AD) That made me think though, because my Facebook says owner operator of 
Divine Wine tours. What if I said something in some random comment that made somebody 
mad. They could easily go to Divine Wine Tours and write a bad review and that’s kind of scary. 
 
[1:04:32] (KS) I think that’s how it is for all the small businesses. With the orchards that I 
worked with they had an incident with a pick your own orchard. It was family run, lovely people, 
and there’s an orchard right next door. I think they were Indian or Korean, they were Korean. 
They had a bad incident with the orchard next door. They got in an argument and the person next 
door was calling them names and being very racist. They went online and told all of their friends 
that it was my friend’s farm, because on the map it looks like, they’re right next door to each 
other and said this farm is racist and got all of their friends and contacts to start writing negative 
reviews. They reached out and said no that didn’t happen here. We welcome everybody. That 
was not us. I think you have us confused with another farm. They didn’t want to throw their 
neighbors under the bus either, but for 48 hours or so until it took to get resolved it was really 
stressful. 
 
[1:05:49] (AD) Those reviews are huge. We have almost all five star reviews. On Facebook we 
have 63 five star reviews. But on Yelp and Tripadvisor during the transition, Dave, before he 
found a buyer, he just kind of quit. He wasn’t even returning phone calls and this guy got mad, 
rightly mad, and he gave a one star review and was like, avoid. I hate that review, because that

one one star review puts us down in the rankings when people look up best Virginia wine tours. I 
actually wrote to him and asked him if we could send him on a tour if he could consider 
changing the review, because it really affects us and I promise that we’re new owners and it’s 
great and he never wrote me back. 
 
[1:06:42] (KS) And I’m sure that was years ago. 
[1:06:43] (AD) Yeah it was so long ago. 2015. 
[1:06:47] (KS) That’s incredibly frustrating for small businesses. It’s a lot of time things you 
have no control over. Would you ever consider doing additional training? Some people have done 
some of the viticultural training. Is it more about just telling the stories of the places you go to, or 
is the science of wine making something you might pursue? 
 
[1:07:15] (AD) Definitely. I personally really want to learn about wine. We’ve already started to 
look into some programs to see what I could do. I feel like I need to be an expert to be able to do 
what I do. Even though we’re a tour company I just really want to know wine inside and out. I 
want to be an expert at it. If we’re a wine education company I want to be an expert. Yeah, we’re 
going to definitely look into that for me. And if we could find some smaller things, like one day 
a weekend for my tour guides I would like that too. We have staff group on Facebook where I’ll 
share articles and facts I find for my staff to keep them updated on things. 
 
[1:08:03] (KS) And then I’m sure just by doing it they’re developing their own, talking to, when 
they’re on the tours and learning about everything. Pretty fun. Is there anything that you wanted 
to add? 
 
[1:08:20] (AD) I don’t think so. I did want to see if you were available on Sunday to go on a 
tour. I would send you on one, but it’s so soon. 
 
[1:08:30] (KS) I’m going down to VVA this weekend, but I might be coming back Saturday. So 
yeah, maybe. 
 
[1:08:38] (AD) If you can, it leaves the Reston Town Center at 10:30. You can join and if you 
decide you’re going to go I would want to figure out what you’d have for lunch, but when do you 
think you’d know? 
 
[1:08:50] (KS) I have a friend who’s going to help me do the interviews. I just have to confirm 
that she can go. They would prefer for us to come down Friday and Saturday. 
 
[1:09:00] (AD) She can join you if you want. You can bring somebody, so you’re not by 
yourself. 
 
[1:09:10] (KS) Thank you. That’s really nice. 
 
[1:09:15] (AD) I feel like it would really help to actually get the experience. It’s our storybook 
route. It’s going to Zephaniah. It’ll be really fu
