David M. Andersen, American Indian Flood Myths: A Case
  
of Cultural Genocide. A study of the contamination of
 
American Indian flood myths by Euro-American recorders
 
and their theological tradition of the deluge.
 
E. N. Anderson, On the Folk Art of Landsca ina. 
The most
 
commonly practiced folk art of the Unit e States is
 
gardening and landscaping.
 Gardens and yards are managed
 
to communicate information about status and social
 
position, among other things.  Structural analysis is
 
possible.

James C. Baker, Echoes of Cornish Folklore in Oregon Mines.
 
Disregarding the pessimism of early collectors of mining
 
folklore, Tommyknockers abound in the oral traditions of
 
even non-Cornish miners.
 
Angie Berry, Field Research: Insiders vs. Outsiders. An
 
American Basque recounts her field work techniques and
 
unusual experiences while doing folklore research among
 
Old World Basques in Spain.  As a means of obtaining
 
important and original data, this paper illustrates the
 
definite advantages plus divided loyalties of a "native"
 
doing research among her own people.
 
Norene Dresser, "Is It Fresh?" An Examination of Jewish
  
American Shopping Habits. Reflecting changes in social
 
conditions, a Los Angeles study shows a dying tradition
 
of a one-upmanship repartee between the buyer and the
 
seller of food.
 
Bess L. Hawes, Folksong and Function: A Look at the Lullaby.
 
Some suggestions concerning the several overt and covert
 
functions of the lullaby, based on a single family
 
tradition and on collectanea from the Los Angeles area.
 
Sharon Heuga, The Three Little Pigs and Jewish Worldview.
 
Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Rood, and Snow White
 
and the Seven Dwarves reinforce Jewish group values and
 
worldview in tales told at Temple Beth Hillel.
 
Julius E. Heuscher, The Juniper Tree. A fairy tale can be
 
legitimately viewed from many vantage points.  Here, a
 
predominantly phenomenological approach explores some
 
deep psychological meanings relevant in our epoch.
 
Lynda R. Krock, A Heroine Pattern. An inquiry into the
 
pattern of behavior of females in myth and legend and its
 
possible significance, prompted by Lord Raglan's The Hero.
 
Richard Lock, Grateful Animals, Un rateful Men. 
Two
 
medieval stories of ingratitude �Aarne-Thompson Type 160)
 
from Japan and England are discussed.
 Their differences
 
are linked to the different feudal social systems.

Carol Gregory Moore, The Strength of the Oral Tradition in
 
Senegal. No abstract available at press time.
 
Arthur Regan, Man and the Contact Lens. 
This paper will
 
attempt to demonstrate the primitive response to the
 
sophisticated world of eye doctors and contact lenses
 
among modern Californians.
 
R. Baird Shuman, Initiation Rites in Steinbeck's "The Red
  
Pony." 
Steinbeck's attraction to large, archetypal
 
concepts has long been recognized.  His use of one such
 
aencept, the rite of initiation, is systematically
 
developed and consistently presented in "The Red Pony."
 
Marcia Walerstein, Ethnic Folklore in the Primary School
  
Classroom.
 This paper will discuss the use of folklore
 
in te
n
a
 g ethnic studies in the Multi-Culture Institute,
 
an experimental school in San Francisco.  Black, Chinese,
 
Latin-American, and Jewish children are taught folklore
 
in their classrooms in the afternoon, and they express
 
their own folklore in the classrooms.  The paper will
 
attempt to reveal what concept of their own ethnic groups
 
these children develop through their "street" and
 
"classroom" folklore.  Tapes will probably be used in the
 
presentation.

Dear Bess:
 
11 January 1

Your paper on lullabies sounds fine.
 Please write me an
 
abstract of what you plan to do, and get it to me within
 
this month.
 The abstract should run about 25 words.
 Then
 
your name, the title (Folksong and Function: A Look at the
 
Lullaby), and the abstract will appear in the printed
 
program, which we will mail early in February.
 
The program committee will meet on 7 March to decide which
 
papers will actually be read aloud.
 If you want yours
 
considered, you should get it to me before 1 March, since
 
we will need at least a week to read it before we meet.
 
I hope you can finish the whole paper by late February,
 
since all of your things are both interesting and instructive.
 
So much for business.  Lois and I are sorry we didn't get up
 
to Kensington at Christmas vacation.
 I got snowed with
 
visits to relatives: my sister in Long Beach, my mother in
 
San Diego.  Mother is fine, but her plumbing chose Christmas
 
eve to stop up, so that when we flushed her toilet water
 
(to coin a euphemism) came up in her bathtub.  My sister's
 
plumbing was all right, but she has almost everything else
 
wrong that anybody could wish ill upon anybody.  Her husband
 
is in the Kaiser Hospital with a dislocated hip which has
 
kept him in bed for six months, and Sis herself suffers from
 
diabetes and cataracts.
 This was all very sad, and when we
 
got back we relaxed and drank white wine for the rest of
 
the vacation.
 
At our semester break we plan to fly to San Diego and rent
 
a car, in which we will scout around for land to lease from
 
the Mexican government between San Diego and Ensenada.  Lois
 
plans to retire in three or four years, and she likes sun
 
and warm ocean swimming.
 If we get back in time, we will
 
certainly call on you in Kensington.
 
Meanwhile, we both love you.

never sent you a summary of my paper,  J am horrified -- not

I  give a

 It's extremely irritating of me and
 
I do apologize.

Dear Bess:
 
20 January 1970
 
About an hour ago Alan Dundes returned a call of mine
 
concerning the CFS conference.  He took advantage of
 
this phone contact to say that you might consider leaving
 
Northridge for San Jose, a move of which I am naturally
 
all in favor.
 
My best friend in our Sociology and Anthropology Department,
 
Professor Milton Rendahl, just told me that the department
 
is splitting into its components, the divorce to be final
 
by fall.
 But for etiquette, you should send a letter of
 
application to the existing chairman, whose credentials I
 
set down for whatever use they may be to you.
 
T. C. Esselstyn
 
Professor of Sociology
 
A. B., 1934, Hobart College; A.M., 1947; Ph. D.,
 
1952, New York University.
 
Rendahl says the two most active people in the new Anthro-
pology-to-be-Launched Department are these:
 
G. Kingsley Noble
 
Associate Professor of Anthropology
 
B. A., 1948, Washington and Lee University; M.A.,
 
1952, Northwestern University; Ph.D., 1961,
 
Columbia University
 
and
 
Frances Underwood
 
Associate Professor of Sociology
 
B. A. 1936, University of Pennsylvania; Ph. D.,
 
1948, Yale University.
 
Presumably either Noble or Underwood will be Department
 
Chairman.
 
You should probably accompany your letter to Esselstyn
 
with a vita.  He will likely turn both over to the new
 
department.
 
I stand by to help in any way you suggest.
 I will take
 
no action until I hear from you, lest I queer your chances
 
through officiousness.
 
I look forward to the abstract and eventually the paper on
 
lullabies.
 
Best,  '

Dear Lews
 
How are you getting on with your deadline for the California Folklore
 
meetings?  I have a hunch that most of your colleagues -- like me --
haven't done so well by you.
 Personally.  I
've written several papers
 
in my head, but the end of the quarter, Christmas and a good solid
 
head cold have interefere with actual performance.
 
If you want to take a chance on me,  I think I can produce a respectable
 
paper on the general topic of lullabies.
 I admit this does not seem --
even to me -- one of the burning issues of the day; but I should like
 
to use it as a jumping-off point for saying something about the functional
 
approach which,  plainly, is useful only insofar as one has correctly
 
understood what the particular function of the item is.
 It seems that
 
we have generally lumped under the overall title of "lullaby" songs which
 
have a variety of functions, while leaving out songs which are actually
 
used as lullabies.
 It's the old problem of categorizing by text rather
 
than context; either way is all right, but you shouldn't mix the two
 
unless gha know -- and state -- that you're doing it.
 
To summarize,  it seems to me that a variety of functions are served under
 
the general taxonomic lumping of "lullaby".
 Which kind of song is ac-
tually song depends then upon the particular function dominant at the
 
particular time.
 Songs sung to nursery age children at bedtime,  for
 
instance, are really not sung to put them to sleep but to make them feel
 
eomfortablea and happy and loved before they go to sleep;  if you try to
 
"lull" them,  they will object -- and quite properly -- since the one
 
function is antithetical to the other.
 Real "lulling" songs are quite
 
different, and very few of them are ever classified as lullabies in
 
collections.
 They run from the wordless tunes -- simple humming or
 
repetitions of nonsense syllables such as "dee dee dee" or "la la" which
 
hardly any collectors ever bother to write down, much less print --
through songs made up of endlessly repeated inane phrases to private
 
family "
signal" songs  (
in our family, these were always hymns).
 "Classic"
 
lullabies,  in my opinion, are sung before the mother wants to get down
 
to business  (that is, get the baby to sleep) and serve a mother-centered
 
rather than an infant-focussed fonction.
 
With a few examples and some of my own notions as to what the texts of
 
the classic lullabies are about (what they mean to mothers rather than
 
to bbbies) I think this should make a reasonably interesting paper; but
 
since today is already January 4th,  I don't have time to write it all
 
up now.
 So I will leave the problem to you.
 Since I will write this
 
paper eventually anyway, whether I actually give it now or next year
 
makes little difference to me. And please don't worry about hurting my
 
feelings or anything of the kind;  I
'll be at the meetings with bells on
 
whether I read a paper or not.
 
With best wishes and happy New Years and all that --

Dear Lew:
 
How are you getting on with your deadline for the California
. Folklore
 
meetings?
 I have a hunch that most of your colleages -- like me --
haven't done so well by you.  Personally,  I
've written several papers in
 
my head,  but the end of the quarter, Christmas and a good solid head
 
cold have interfered with my actual performance.
 
If you want to take a chance on me,  I think I can produce a respectable
 
paper eventually on the general topic of lullabies.
 I admit this does
 
not seem, even to me,  one of the burning issues of the day;  but I should
 
like to use it as a jumping-off point for saying something about the
 
functional approach which, clearly,  is useful only insofar as one has
 
correctly understood what the particular function of the item is.
 
It appears to me that we have generally lumped under the overal taxonomic
 
title of "1ullabye" songs which have a variety of functions,  at the same
 
time leaving out songs which are actually used as lullabies.

Dear Lew,
 
How are you getting on with your deadline for the Cal State meetings?
 
I have a strong hunch that most of your colleagues -- like me --
haven't done so well by you.
 Personally,  I
've written several papers
 
in my head,  but the end of the quarter, Christmas and a good solid
 
head cold have interfered with my actual performance.
 
If you want to take a chance on me,  I think I can produce a respect-
able paper on the general topic of lullabies.
 (
Ifind it rather amusing
,
 
kha9 -- constantly surrounded as I am by pleas for relevancy and
 
attention to issues of social importance -- that I seem to $ai-kxRhowl�X
 
want to think about putting children to sleep.
 What dreadful kxeohcotxala
 
conclusion can we draw from that?)
 
Anyway,  the title "The Functional Approach to Folksong -- a Look
 
at the Lullaby" occurs to me as a pleasantly onomatopoetic title.
 
Basically what I want to say is this: that the functional approach
 
is obviously useful as long
, as we correctly define the function
 
only
 
and it seems to me a variety of functions are served under the general
 
overall taxonomic lumping of "i
-mh lullaby" which clearly makes some
 
songs more suitable than others,  depending on which of the functions
 
are dominantY at the particular moment.
 Songs sung to nursery age
 
children at bedtime are really not to put them to sleep but to make
 
them feel comfortable and happy and loved and not lonely; if you try
 
to twit "
lull" them,  they will object and quite properly so.
 (In
 
my own experience whagxXha their chief aesthetic criterion is simple
 
length;  this is the real age for appreciation of ballads.) True
 
"
lulling" songs are quite different, and very few of them are ever
 
classified as lullabies in collections.
 They include the wordless
 
tunes which  run from simple humming to repetitions of nonsense
 
xyiahlux syllables  (
dee dee dee or la la la, for example) which
 
hardly any collector bothers to note down or print,  through rather
 
inane phrases repeated over and over to private family signal songs
 
(
in our family,  these were always hymns).
 "Classic" lullabies,
 
in my opinion, are sung before the mother wants to get down to business
 
(
that is, get the baby to sleep) and serve a mother-centered function
 
rather than an infant-focussed one.
 
With a few examples$ and some of my own notions as to what the texts
 
of lullabies are about (what they mean t
b mothers rather than to babies)
 
I think that should make a rNxVmwKxkiX reasonably interesting paper,
 
but I real*y do not have time to write it all out now.
 So I will
 
just leave it up to you (
since I will write it anyway, whether I
 
give it now or next yeaxyxxkxxmally makes little difference to me.)
 
I am really not trying to put you on the spot, kxt so please do not
 
worry about Eurting my feelings or anything of the kind.
 I
'll be
 
at the meetings with bells on whether I read a paper or not.
 
With best wishes and happy New Years and all that,

iX,ar Bob:
 
When I got back to Berkeley.  I did indeed find your letter
 
waiting for me.
 During our Santa Clara conversation,  I had
 
misunderstood your  I thought you were referring to the mimeo-
graphed general solicitation for papers under your signature,
 
which I had  received several weeks before.
 
I am, of course, flattered and pleased that you thought of
 
me in connection with the session on Mexican-American culture.
 
however,  I
'm afraid the sensible course for me is to decline
 
with thanks.
 There are ,
just too many problems involved.
 I
 
do have good written material in my files on the singing game
 
tradition, but all of that material is currently at Valley
 
State.
 Though I could arrange to have it sent here.  I do
 
not recall any tape recordings of particular distinction,
 
and my own Spanish is of the baby-talk variety.
 (
(hie of the
 
multitudimous projects I had planned for my Berkeley year
 
was to get my Spanish into proper shape, but I simply haven't
 
had the time and I
'd hate - lacking tapes or film - to have
 
to subject AFS to large doses of it.)
 I do wish you were
 
planning for the 1971 meetings, as I intend to start work on
 
a film of Mexican-American singing games as soon as I can in
 
the fall, but I would hesitate to count on currently non-existent
 
film footage.
 All in all, it ,
just seems to me too problematic,
 
but I do thank you again for thinking of me.
 
I have a tentative idea in mind for a paper which you might be
 
able to fit into a different session.
 I
t has to do with the
 
birthday as the single most characteristic American ritual,
 
applying equally to child and adult, and I could send you a
 
summary -- or even a first draft -• on that by May,  I should
 
think.
 At the moment,  I intend to center it around the "happy
 
birthday" song, which seems to me to summarize with real elegance
 
the exact significance of the event, but I
'll have to see how
 
it all comes out.
 Don't worry if it doesn't seem to place well:
 
I can always save it for the California meetings.
 
It was very nice to see you last week, and I
'll give you a
 
call when we get home towards the end of the summer.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Hawes

March 24, 1970
 
As you perhaps know, the American Folklore Society will hold its
 
next annual meeting in Los Angeles from November 12-15, 1970.  Among
 
the regular sessions which we hope to be able to schedule is one on
 
traditional expressive and material manifestations of Mexican-American
 
cultures.
 Because of your ongoing research on the games of Mexican-
American children in Los Angeles and because of the valuable contribu-
tions that you have made to past folklore meetings,  I feel that you
 
could add substantially to this proposed session.
 I hope, therefore,
 
that you will he able to attend the 1970 meeting of the Society and
 
that you will consider participating in the session described above.
 
Should you find it possible and desirable to do so, I would
 
appreciate your sending me, at your convenience, a tentative title
 
and brief, one-page description of the kind of paper that you might
 
like to present.
 Once the program plans are completed,  I shall ask
 
each individual whose paper has been scheduled to submit a final title
 
and short abstract for inclusion in the printed handouts.
 In order to
 
accommodate the many individuals who wish to participate and to allow
 
sufficient time for meaningful discussions during each session, parti-
cipants are being asked to limit their presentations to approximately
 
fifteen 
 minutes each.
 
I hope that you will find it possible to attend the 1970 meeting
 
of the American Folklore Society and that you will be able to contri-
bute to the session on traditional expressive and material manifestations
 
of Mexican-American cultures.
 I shall look forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely yours,
