PREFACE 
These notes accompany a selection of sound recordings 
prepared for presentation to the National Park Service from the 
Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project (1978) 
The set consists of twelve reels of audio tape, each reel 
consisting of several performances or actualities. Many of the 
recordings are ip stereo- The twelve tapes are arranged into four 
major groups: 
Reels 1-3 document the "Sense of Time" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels h-6 document the "Sense of Place" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels 7-8 offer a sampling of "Traditional Social Life" in 
rural Blue Ridge communities visited by the project; and 
Reels 9-12 explore the varieties of religious expression in 
the traditional communities on the Blue Ridge. 
These selections were made by Charles Wolfe, the Field 
Coordinator for the Project. In the end, the choices are somewhat 
arbitrary and subjective, but they were made with an overview of 
the project provided by personal experience, as well as the reports, 
tape logs, and suggestions of other fieldworkers. These fieldworkers 
included Pat Mullen, Ohio State University; Geraldine Johnson, 
Strayer'College; Blanton Owen, Ferrum College; Margaret Owen, Ferrum 
College; Tom Adler, Indiana University; and Howard Marshall and Carl 
Fleischhauer of the American Folklife Center. 
The headings for each selection provide the following 
information: 
Selection title; name of artist; instrumentation; black or 
white cult-oral group; recording date; location of recording; name 
of fieldworker; name of recordist; project tape number. 
The original recordings are at the Library of Congress, 
and copies have been presented to the Blue Ridge Parkway.

1. Stories about Daniel Boone; Mr. and Mrs. Quincy Higgins, 
narration; white; 9 Septemher 1978; Higgins home, Sparta, North 
Carolina; Pat Mullen and Geraldine Johnson, fieldworkers and 
recordists; BR8-PM-R42. 
Daniel Boone has been the subject of all sorts of legends, 
some stimulated by popular culture, others genuine forms of tradi¬ 
tional folklore. Quincy Higgins' tales about Boone are noteworthy 
in two respects: they are closely tied to area land features, and 
they are related in some way to modern life. It is almost as if 
Higgins is seeking to verify the reality of his historical accounts 
of Boone by using the present(e.g. , placenames with Boone's name) 
as proof. The story of Boone shooting Indians as they jumped off 
a cliff in pevenge for the death of his son does not appear in any 
standard biographies of Boone. 
2. The Hoop Snake; Fred Lowe, narration; white; 7 September 
1978; Fisher Gap, near Lowgap, North Carolina (Surry County); 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-C3. 
Another genre of "classic" folklore that reflects and 
preserves the past is the tall tale. Fred Lowe's tale of the grand¬ 
father's encounter with a rolling snake is of special interest because 
it can be traced in Surry County as far back as 1859* In that year 
virtually the same story appears in a book called Fisher's River 
(North Carolina) Scenes and Characters by Harden E. Taliaferro, a 
Baptist minister who revisited his native county in 1857 to gather 
material for the book. In that book the tale is attributed to Uncle 
Davy Lane, who asserted that it described a personal experience. Lowe 
continues this tradition of "personalizing" the narrative by asserting 
that the story happened to his grandfather, and by sprinkling it with 
local place names and framing it with other stories about his grand¬ 
father's Civil War experiences. This story has also been widely 
collected in Kentucky. 
3. The Ballad of Caty Sage; sung by J.C. Pierce; white; 22 Septem¬ 
ber 1978; Pierce home, near Coal Creek, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R69. 
A favorite way of celebrating and preserving dramatic or 
touching events of local history has always been the localized event 
ballad. One of the oldest such events commemorated in the Blue Ridge 
area is the abduction of five-year-old Caty Sage by Indians from her 
home in rural Grayson County in 1792. Fifty-six years later a brother 
found her ih eastern Kansas, living with the Wyandot Indians; he tried 
to pursuade her to return to her family in Virginia, but before she 
could she died of pneumonia. About 19^0, J.C. Pierce, a local singer 
and guitarist, read a-poem about Caty Sage by Eva Boyer, in the Galax 
newspaper. Impressed, he set the poem to music, and sung it at the 
Galax fiddlers' contest that year. It intrigued some folklorists who 
-k- 
\ \ 
ver© present and Pierce was soon invited to record the song for the 
Library of Congress. Pierce, who later became a Galax policeman, 
has continued to perform the song since then, copyrighted it and 
recorded it commercially, and has written a short history of the 
Sage story. 
\ 
H. Witch Stories; Will Barnard, narration; white; 12 August 1978; 
Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-PM-R3. 
Yet another genre of "classic" folklore is the supernatural 
legend and a surprising number of these are found in the Blue Ridge 
area even today. Most of Will Barnard's witch stories relate in 
some way to his immediate family, and thus are tied up with his own 
personal sense of the past. The witch described here is buried in 
the Barnard family graveyard. In this region, the word witch is 
used to refer either to a man or a woman. 
5. The Murder of the Lawson Family; sung by Artie Marshall, 
accompanied by herself on guitar and by Jim Marshall on 5-string 
banjo; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R97* 
In late 1929 a Surry County man named Charlie Lawson went 
berserk and murdered his entire family, and by March 1930 a song 
about the tragedy had been recorded by a singing team called the 
Carolina Buddies. It soon became widely popular in the area and 
remains so today. The song is an early instance of a local event 
song going into tradition via the medium of the phonograph record. 
The song follows the form of many event ballads of the 1920's, giv¬ 
ing specific details about the tragedy and concluding with some 
gesture toward moral judgement. Artie Marshall has known the song 
since childhood. 
6. Legends of Charlie Lawson; Herbert Fulk, narration; white; 
17 August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Folk memory of Charlie Lawson, in coming to grips with the 
horror of a rural society having in its midst a mass murderer, has 
attached a variety of supernatural elements to Lawson. Herbert 
Fulk, who insists that as a boy he slept with Lawson shortly before 
the murder, gives some examples of these legends in his accounts of 
the haunted "graphophone" and the bewitched car—both once possessions 
of Lawson. It is noteworthy how these traditional supernatural ele¬ 
ments have been attached to two symbols of modern society: the record 
player and the automobile.

1. The Vengeful Ghost; Herbert Fulk, narration; vhite; IT 
August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Herbert Fulk tells this classic ghost story as a personal 
experience narrative with a good sense of pacing and detail. Espe¬ 
cially noteworthy is casual way in which the narrator relates to the 
ghost and in the colorful, idiomatic language used by both ghost and 
narrator. The story was told in a context that included other per¬ 
sonal experience supernatural tales, including the stories about 
Charlie Lawson (Reel 1, selection #6). 
2. School Children's Rhymes and Parodies; sung by children from 
Mrs. Holland's fourth grade class. Blue Ridge Elementary School; 
black and white; 12 September 1978; Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-RU8. 
Children's folklore often displays a delightful irreverance 
for the past, as shown by the two parodies here of a venerable Blue 
Ridge traditional song, "On Top of Old Smoky." Both of these parodies 
are well known, and have been collected from children across the coun¬ 
try; texts similar to those here appear, for instance, in Mary and 
Herbert Knapp's One Potato, Two Potato: The Folklore of American 
Children (Norton, 1976). Such folklore of children at once ridicules 
the past and yet at the same time preserves it. 
3. Forecasting Rain; Cosby Golding, narrative; white; 8 August 1978; 
Surry County, near Lowgap, North Carolina; Blanton Owen, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-B0-R1. 
I 
4. Quilts and Fortune; actuality. Baptist Church Quilting Group; 
white; 1^ September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworker ajad recordist; BR8-GJ-R56. 
Not every response to time in traditional life is tied to 
the past; there are a vast number of methods of forecasting the future. 
Here are two different contexts for such forecasting: Cosby Golding 
relates his predictions of rain to natural signs; the ladies in the 
quilting group use various domestic images, such as quilts, mirrors 
and apple seeds.’ All the informants here are a little unsure of the 
efficacy of the signs, and all nervously qualify their faith in the 
sign?—yet they have thought enough of them to have preserved them 
throughout the years. All the predictions are highly personal in 
nature; none pretend to foretell, for instance, national trends or 
the fates of famous people, as do predictions in mass media.

5. The Reaper in the Elements; Marvin Lyon, narration; white; 
5 September 1978; Roaring Gap, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-PM-R33. 
Many Local anecdotes collected in the project were built 
around the theme of changing times. Though technology came to the 
Blue Ridge reasonably early (a paved highway up the ridge to Meadows 
of IJan was completed as early as 1928), people here, as elsewhere, 
love to tell stories of an old man seeing his first car, his first 
train, his first airplane, etc. Such accounts serve to dramatize 
the cultural and economic changes wrought by technology, and empha¬ 
size the difference between life "now" and "in the old days." 
6. Courtship Story; Dean and Estelle Gambill, joint narration; 
black; 30 August 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R30. 
Courtship stories and religious conversion stories formed 
the most common types of personal experience narrative collected in 
the project. This particular story is structurally interesting in 
the way Estelle offers an account from her point of view, bringing 
the tale through to marriage, and then her husband backs up and fills 
in gaps by telling the story from his point of view. Both narratives 
are full of detail and well formed, suggesting that both husband and 
wife are used to telling the story to children, grandchildren, and 
friends. The Gambills are both in their seventies, and Dean, a re¬ 
tired farmer, mail carrier, and store clerk, spent the years 1916- 
1927 in West Virginia, mining coal—as did many blacks along the 
ridge. 
7. Slavery and Modern Times; Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; 
17 August 1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and 
Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R12. 
Jesse Lee Hatcher was one of our best informants from the 
perspective of integrating past and present; Mr. Hatcher had an 
exceptionally sharp memory of turn-of-the-century life on the ridge, 
a graceful and articulate way of expressing it, and ability to con¬ 
trast it with modern life. Born in 1890 of parents who had been 
slaves, Jesse Hatcher spent most of his life as a farmer. He stays 
at his old home place near Ararat in the summers and in Richmond in 
the winter. His life-long struggle with discrimination and the after¬ 
effects of slavery are evident in these comments about the continuing 
effects of slavery in modern times.

1. Memories of the Depression;l^rs. Mae Willey, narration; white; 
22 August 1978j Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R9* 
2. Hard Times; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white; 23 August 1978; 
and 18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson 
and Harley Jolley, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R13> 64. 
These two personal experience narratives describe the ways 
in which two women from the Blue Ridge deal with painful memories of 
the Depression. Mae Willey, the older of the two women, began her 
marriage during that time and tends to perceive the period as a 
time of testing that made her and her husband better, more self- 
sufficient people. Ruth Holbrook, born in 1924, was only five when the 
stock market crashed and lost all of her brothers and sisters during 
the Depression. She does not see the experience in any sort of posi¬ 
tive light and did not seem overly anxiotis to talk about it to the 
fieldworkers. (The Holbrook selection is composed of two segments 
from separate interviews conducted nearly a month apart.) Ruth Hol¬ 
brook went on to become a quilter, instructor in a community college, 
a member of a touring clogging team, and is currently sales manager 
for the Stone Mountain Craft Shop. 
3. "Women's Liberation Came Too Late For Me;" Ruth Newman, narration; 
white; 8 September 1978; Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R28. 
Ruth Geraldine Newman, a forty-nine-year old native of Galax, 
is a skillful cook and craftworker, as well as a published poet. She 
lives alone with her father in a rural area outside town. Her long 
account of her struggles to realize her own ambitions in the face of 
discouragement by parents and teachers pemind us that tradition, for 
all of its stabilizing value, can also present great difficulties.

What makes the culture of the rural Blue Ridge unique, and 
how is this uniqueness reflected in the folklife of the area? A 
natural starting point is the placenames of the area, and what these 
names mean to people in the area. Many of the people in the area 
know stories behind the placenames near them, though some know differ¬ 
ent stories about the same placename. The two accounts of how Traphill 
got its name illustrate this; these two accounts also illustrate 
different reasons for their preservation. Marvin Lyon's story is rather 
straightforward and initiates a litany of other placenames; Ruth Hol¬ 
brook's tale, on the other hand, is tied to personal history: the story 
of "By Gravy" Tom, her grandfather, who carried mail through the land 
on foot. 
Fred Clifton's account of how Cloudbreak got its name is yet 
a third type: a tale reflecting a rather formal sense of community 
history, Clifton here is very much aware of the narrative quality of 
his account—unlike Lyon, who doesn't set up much narrative or add much 
detail, or Holbrook, who invests the process with memories. 
While some placenames are derived from historical events, 
others are derived from natural features, as Ethel Brewer's account of 
naming Galax suggests. In fact, in this account we learn that names 
commemorating a historical event or person were rejected in favor of 
a "natural" name (even though the town was a "planned" community 
founded by the railroad). The Galax: leaves, incidentally, provided a 
useful cash export crop for citizens of the area for years; these leaves 
are highly decorative and especially in demand around Christmas. 
Jim and Artie Marshall's song about Galax, and the discussion 
that follows, explores the way local people feel about the image Galax 
has acquired in more recent years. Today the place of Galax has become 
synonymous with a fiddling contest and festival where old and young 
come to meet ," After he sings the song, Marshall and his wife discuss 
the impact the festival has had on the land itself, and the special prob¬ 
lems created by the massive "Stompin' '76 festival of a few years back. 
-12- 
"There was garbage everywhere," Artie Marshall says, 'Diey even 
camped in the cemetery," an act symbolizing brutalization of both 
the past and the land. 
6. Gathering Ginseng; Fred Clifton, narration; white; 21 August 
1978; Vesta, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8- 
FM-R18. 
7. Home Remedies; Mr. and Mrs. Will Barnard, narration; white; 
12 August 1978; Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, 
and Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R4. 
8. The Balm of Gilead Tree; Jesse Hatcher, narration; white; 
17 August 1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen and Harley Jolley, 
fieldworkers, and Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R11. 
Q. Magic Asthma Cure; Will Barnard, narration; white; 12 August 
1978; Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl 
Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-RU. 
The next group of selections is designed to illustrate the 
various ways the people in the area make their physical environment 
a part of their physical lives. Ties to the land and geography are 
not merely historical but material as well, and over the years the 
people of the Blue Ridge have used folk medicines and home remedies 
indigenous to the immediate environment. 
For years ginseng has been a cash crop in the mountains 
and even today mountaineers jealously guard the secret locations of 
their ginseng patches; "poachers" will often strip a ginseng crop ^ 
completely, destroying the growth for several years. Fred Clifton's 
account of ginseng is also interesting in that it gives an insight 
into how the people in the area feel about ginseng's medicinal 
properties. ^ . 
Mr. and Mrs. Will Barnard offer a catalogue of home remedies 
made from local, flora that the people trust more than ginseng: catnip 
tea, ground ivy tea, boneset, "red bloom weed," and others. Though 
some of the people still use these home remedies, the Barnards indicate 
that the tradition is declining. 
88-year-old Jesse Lee Hatcher discusses the medicinal proper¬ 
ties of the Balm of Gilead tree which he has growing in his yard. As 
Hatcher says, the Balm of Gilead is mentioned in the Bible, in Jeremiah 
8:22 and again in Genesis 37:25; there the term referred to the resin 
from the Styrax tree, produced especially in the north Transjordan 
region of Gilead, which was widely used for medicinal purposes. But 
it is important to note that Hatcher's "authority" for the belief is 
not only the Bible (Hatcher is a deacon in the local church) but the 
past: his parents used the remedy. Later Hatcher discusses his general 
attitude toward home remedies in the face of modern medicine.. 
Will Barnard's description of a magic asthma (or tizzy ) cure 
-13- 
moves us from a simple physical link between man and nature to a more 
metaphysical type of sympathetic magic. Barnard’s cure does ^sim" 
ply involve the physical preparation of an ointment, tea, or b , 
but involves ritual as well-vhat Mrs. Barnard calls voodoo. In a 
broader sense, though, the underlying idea behind the_cure is that 
man and nature function as one in a sort of mystic union of the en¬ 
vironment and the individual.

1* Planting by the Signs; Mr. and Mrs. Quincy Higgins, narration; 
white; 9 September 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen and 
Geraldine Johnson, fieldworkers, and Pat Mullen, recordist; BR8-PM-R44. 
2. Do Planting Signs Work?; Dean and Estelle Gambill, narration; 
black; 30 August 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen,

3- Planting Signs; Tim Slate, narration; white; 29 August 1978; 
Slate farm, near Claudville, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-B0-R20. 
The next eight selections form a sequence of statements 
about planting, harvesting, and preparation of food in the study 
area. Like home remedies, such lore is inextricably tied to the nature 
of the land itself and the attitude people have toward it. 
One part of such lore involves "planting by the signs:" 
keying the planting of crops to the position of the zodiac signs, so 
related to the parts of the body. Many calendars and almanacs cir¬ 
culated throughout the region give detailed, day-to-day information 
about the movement of these signs. One of the most common almanacs in 
the Blue Ridge area is Blum1s Almanac, which has been published in 
Winston-Salem since the l880's.* The use of this particular form of 
printed mass media to maintain a system of traditional lore has con¬ 
tinued for several generations. 
All three of these excerpts are characterized by an ambivalence 
toward planting signs. Mrs. Quincy Higgins' father never used the signs 
and yet she will "run and open the door and check" before she plants. 
Her husband asserts that, "it's been working through the ages," and that 
it is mentioned in the Bible. The Gambills, both in their seventies, 
disagree completely on the effectiveness of planting by the signs. 
Estelle uses the signs because her grandparents did, and because, "mama 
never planted nothing when the signs were not right;" her maintenance 
of this tradition is thus linked to her respect for her parents and grand¬ 
parents. Dean is far more pragmatic about planting and offers his own 
evidence to counter that of his wife. 
Tim Slate, a tobacco farmer in his twenties, is skeptical 
about using signs, but when asked outright if he does not believe in 
signs, he is quick to reply, "I didn't say that." Tim argues that his 
mother believes more strongly in signs than he does, and asserts that 
different books—different almanacs—contradict each other in giving 
day-to-day signs. But the fact that a young farmer in the area, even 
in this day of widespread community colleges, farm extension agents, 
and scientific farming, still has even this much interest in the signs, 
testifies to the strength of the tradition. 
*Sample pages from Blum's Almanac are appended to these annotations.

8. Pickles and Canning Order; Mae Willey, narration; white; 22 
August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-GJ-Rll. 
Like planting and harvesting, food preservation also con¬ 
tinues along traditional lines. Mae Willey is a modern, up-to-date 
woman living in a comfortable ranch-style house, but she allows her 
daily work to be structured by the age-old natural cycle of gardening. 
Just as there are the right signs for planting, so there are right 
signs for canning and preserving the harvest. 
Ruth Newman's catalogue of local greens includes dandelion, 
dock, lamb's quarter, blackberry briar leaves, "dooryard wood" (plantain), 
and "mousears." This catalogue provides an interesting parallel to the 
catalogue of home remedies (Will Barnard, Reel , #7) also drawn from 
local flora. 
Drying is one of the more common traditional means of food 
preservation in the Blue Ridge. Though many families in the area have 
home freezers, some continue to dry beans, apples, peaches, and even 
sweet potatoes simply because they prefer the taste of dried food to 
that of frozen food. In addition to the drying rack on a wood stove 
described by Margaret Jarvis, other drying methods include the use of 
"dry houses" (sheds with wood furnaces underneath for quick, hot drying) 
and automobiles. Apple slices, or similar fruits or vegetables, are 
placed in the window of a closed car where the sun can shine on them 
for several days. 
Mae Willey takes a great amount of pride in her home-canned 
goods; she knows her stock so well that she does not have to label jars, 
and is able to rotate old and new jars almost by instinct. Her attitude 
toward cleaning and dusting her supply of canned food suggests that she 
takes an aesthetic pride in the physical display of the goods: they are 
symbolic of her well-being, as well as her skill as a home-maker, and 
even of a certain structure and order in her life.

Slate; white! 26 September 1978; Mt. Airy, North Carolina (New Farmers 
Market); Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R81+. 
This sequence chronicles the progress of Tim Slate's tobacco 
crop from harvesting to its sale at auction during the late summer of 
1978. Tobacco is an important cash crop both on top of the ridge 
(hurley, air-cured) and beneath the ridge (bright leaf, flue cured), 
and it has been for years. In the first selection here you can hear 
the Slate family "priming" tobacco—breaking off the leaves— and we are 
introduced to young Tim Slate. 7U-year-old Bernie Dollarhite then re¬ 
calls older methods of gathering the tobacco (spliting the stalks and 
hanging it by the stick), and Beech Slate weighs in with a story of how 
he used to prime tobacco all day and boil fifty gallons of "sugar liquor' 
at night. 
In the second excerpt we hear Tim and Beech Slate swapping 
stories while stringing the tobacco—putting it on sticks to hang in 
the curing barn. Two stories are told: the first is a piece of modern 
folklore concerning the alleged presence of Patty Hearst at a local 
dance; the second is a well-known joke about a mule who, during a heat 
wave, saw corn pop on the stalk in the field and, thinking it was snow, 
froze to death. Both modern and classic folklore here serve the same 
function and in this context the story-tellers make little distinction 
between the two. 
Selection #3 documents the day Tim Slate and his sister took 
his tobacco to be auctioned at the New Farmer's Market in Mt. Airy. 
This selection consists of three separate parts: 
1. Tim Slate talking to Charles Wolfe shortly after a 
government inspector placed a minimum support price 
on Tim's stacks; 
2. the sounds of auctioneers selling two of Tim's stacks; 
3. Tim reacting to the prices he got for what amounted 
to a good part of his summer's work, and reflecting 
on the uncertainties of tobacco farming in general.

5- Outsiders in the Mountains; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white; 
8 August 1978; Stone Mountain Craft Shop, Traphill, North Carolina; 
Pat Mullen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R23- 
The next five selections on this reel explore the different 
ways people in the Blue Ridge come to grips with the stereotyped "hill¬ 
billy" image thrust on them by the outside world. There are a surprising 
number of different responses to this image, some dating back several 
generations, some relatively new. 
One of these responses involves the gradual acceptance and 
even appropriation of such stereotypes by hill people themselves. "My 
Virginia Rose"is one of a number of old Tin Pan Alley songs romantici¬ 
zing the hills or the South which became very popular with early country 
musicians. Many of these songs were designed for the vaudeville or 
minstrel stage and written by tunesmiths who had never seen the moun¬ 
tains; they gradually found their way into the South and more than a 
few entered oral tradition. "My Virginia Rose" was originally recorded 
by the Carter Family in 1936—one of a number of such sentimental, 
romantic songs they helped to popularize. 
Ruth Holbrook's subtle guerrilla action against snobbish out¬ 
siders who come into her shop represents rejection of these stereotypes. 
Ruth complains that not all stereotyping necessarily comes from northerners, 
but that some of it comes from fellow North Carolinians who live down on 
the Piedmont or near the coast. In some of her tricks and jokes, she 
uses an age-old ploy and lets her subjects' own hasty prejudgements 
lead them into foolish moves. 
6. We Are The Hillbillies; Eunice McAlexander, narration; white; 
lk September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and Terry Eiler and Richard McCamant, recordists; BR8-GJ-R55- 
7- Growing Up In Lowgap; (including performance of "Blue Moon of 
Kentucky"); Fern Evans, narration and vocal lead, with Melrose Smith 
(Fern's sister) (electric bass), Melanie Smith (banjo), Bruce Evans 
(Fern's son) (rhythm guitar), and Brian Smith (snare drum); white; 
22 September 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R66. 
8. The Hillbilly Kid on State; Boyden Carpenter, narrative; white; 
25 September 1978; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-CW-R81. 
Reruns of old television shpws depicting rural stereotypes, 
such as*The Andy Griffith Show"and"Beverly Hallbilliesare still very 
popular on the Blue Ridge. In fact, a number of inhabitants insist 
that the "Mayberry" of"The Andy Griffith Show" was in reality Sparta, 
North Carolina and are rather proud of this fact. Yet, as Eunice 
McAlexander points out, many children from the area do not associate 
themselves with the stereotype hillbillies of these shows. 
-20- 
Growing Up in Lovgap represents a more modern response to 
the hillbilly stereotype, one that is tied to upward mobility and what 
might be termed "hillbilly chic." The family of Fern Evans—the Ramey 
Family— has genuine roots in rural Surry County, and Fern herself per¬ 
formed in the 1930's and 19U0's with famous traditional musicians like 
Tommy Jarrell. Yet most members of the family are now rather well-to-do 
and musically and culturally sophisticated; they count among their 
acquaintances Nashville country music stars like Ronnie Stoneman. In 
this selection, we hear Fern deliberately exaggerating her "hillbilly" 
background, which she had sought for years to overcome, and using it to 
introduce another romanticizing song, "Blue Moon of Kentucky." (The song 
itself was written and popularized by blue grass star Bill Monroe in 
19^6.) When she comments, "We were poop before it became popular to 
be poor," she is revealing much of the impulse underlying this newer 
attitude toward stereotyping. 
Boyden Carpenter is from nearby Alleghany County, North 
Carolina, and was one of the first traditional musicians in the area 
to try to commercially exploit his hillbilly image. By 1930 he was 
a successful radio performer, billing himself as "The Hillbilly Kid," 
and sprinkling his performances with jokes and stories emphasizing from 
how far back in the hills he had come. The stage costume he describes 
was not all that different from the ones worn by many other genuine 
traditional mountain musicians who tried to perform commercially in the 
early days of country music. Ironically, these costumes were as 
successful with rural audiences as with northern or urban vaudeville 
and radio audiences; even popular radio shows like "The Grand Ole Opry" 
and "National Barn Dance" utilized such "hayseed" images. 
9. The New River Blues; Jim Marshall, vocal and banjo, with Axtie 
Marshall, guitar; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R96. 
The set of performances illustrating "sense of place" con¬ 
cludes with a self-described "protest song" by Jim Marshall, a former 
truck driver and part-time auctioneer from Hillsville, Virginia. The 
song was written in 1976 during the successful fight against the plan 
to rinm the New River. Its concluding stanzas summarize much of the 
fierce pride in the land felt by the people of the Blue Ridge—as well 
as their fear that the land is being threatened by forces in modern 
society. 
You took our mountains and our rivers, 
Turned them to a rich playground. 
Take our homes to build your dams, 
So in luxury you can abound. 
You bought our lawmen with your money. 
So they'll vote for what you say, 
Why don't you stay in your big cities. 
And leave our land for another day? 
-21 
Where are you gonna take your children. 
Show them nature at its best? 
If you dam up the last river. 
You might as well take all the rest.

i 
After declining in the 1950’s, regular weekly square dances 
are again becoming popular in the Blue Ridge; such dances are routinely 
advertised in local papers and nearly always feature live string band 
music. One of the busiest "working bands" in the Galax; area is that of 
Whit (Howdy) Sizemore, who play a couple of dances a week, in addition 
to radio work and promotional work for local merchants. The weekly 
dance at Fairview, Virginia, has been held for about eleven years and 
now occurs in a large, modern building. Officially no drinking is 
allowed and an admission fee of $2.00 to $3.00 is charged. One of the 
band members asserted, "We really pack’em in here in winter. On a good 
night this winter we're likely to make as much as $U5.00 each." Most 
of the dances are called, though on occasion the caller will sit out and 
let the dancers do free form buck dancing; often the caller will take 
microphone in hand and get down off the stage to call as he joins the 
dancers. At this dance, cornmeal was sprinkled on the hardwood floor and 
this accounts for the shuffling sound heard on the selection. The caller, 
Brian Dollinger, learned the art some forty years ago when he would go 
by wagon to the famous fiddling contests at White Top, Virginia; like 
mqny callers, he half speaks, half sings through the selection. "Sugar 
Hill" is a widely known tune in the area. This selection (like many 
dance performances) lasted nearly twenty minutes and a four minute 
excerpt is presented here. 
2. Barn Raising; Lester and Lizzie Carter, narration; black; 13 
September 1978; Patrick County, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R50. 
Black farmers along the ridge were often integrated into the 
white rural culture of the area and Lester Carter's description of barn 
building, with blacks and whites working together, bears this out. Such 
communal work gatherings also often included threshing and other forms 
of crop gathering as well as building. 
3."The Two Foxes," Jack in the Bush, and Town Ball; Matt Burnett, 
narrative; white; l6 September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R56. 
Matt Burnett is a 74-year-old retired auctioneer, a skilled 
toy-maker, and a locally respected story-teller. He is a fund of local 
supernatural legends and historical anecdotes. His narrative presented 
here reflects two distinct types of traditional social entertainment. 
"recitations" and game—playing. Matt recites an old poem he memorized 
as a child as a school exercise. In the early decades of the century it 
-2U- 
yas quite common to include such recitations along with music-mahing 
as a normal typq of entertainment. Many such entertainments were held 
in local school houses and poems like "The Two Foxes" were learned hy 
children as part of their formal education. There is a distinct corpus 
of such recitation poems still remembered by many older residents of the 
South and Midwest; many had their origin in printed forms in nine¬ 
teenth century England and America, but some have been in oral tradition 
for so long that it is difficult to track them down to their original 
texts. (For a collection of such texts, with commentary, see Michael 
R. Turner, Parlour Poetry: A Casket of Gems, 1969.) 
Long Tongue Women; instrumental performance by The Korn Kutters, 
which includes Ivan Weddle (fiddle). Freeman Slusher (guitar), George 
Slusher (harmonica), and Willard Glower (banjo); white; 28 September 
1978; at home of D.J. and Janet Keith, Willis, Floyd County, Virginia; 
Tom Adler, fieldworker, and Tom Adler and Carl Fleischhauer, recordists; 
BR8-TA-R45. 
It is still reasonably common for neighbors on the Blue Ridge 
to get together to make informal string band music at home. The Korn 
Kutters, a group accustomed to playing together informally with occa¬ 
sional performances at dances, exhibit a fairly typical Galax string 
band sound. The fiddle and harmonica as twin lead instruments have 
been documented in the area since the 1920's in recordings by Ernest 
Stoneman (Galax), The Red Fox Chasers (Surry County, North Carolina) 
and the Floyd County Ramblers (from the same immediate area as the Korn 
Kutters). The conversation before and after the selection suggests the 
informal social context in which the music is produced. The tune "Long 
Tongue Women," while traditional, is not normally played as a string 
band instrumental. At the end of this excerpt one of the band members re¬ 
fers to "an old record" of this piece. He was probably referring to a 
1926 recording by Georgia singer and guitarist Riley Puckett (Columbia 
I90H5), who performs the tune at a more sedate tempo. The first stanza 
of Puckett's version goes: 
I am lonesome and depressed. 
Got a woman who talks so fast, 
How she gets every word of the news. 
She can talk a wind to death. 
Just before he gets his breath, 
And the way she works the jobbers beats the Jews. 
5. Barber Shop Stories; actuality. Town and Country Barber Shop; 
white; 24 August 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Terry Eiler, fieldworker, 
and Wes Leishman and Harley Jolley, recordists; BR8-TE-R3• 
Local small town barber shops provide one of the most vital 
settings for informal story-telling among older men. The Town and Country 
-25- 
Barber Shop is owned by Basil Lanerith and Rodney Busick. Customers 
present during the taping included A. Vance Choate, Ernest Cleary, John 
Reeves, P.C. Collins, Jr. (local politician), Tom Bledsoe, Tab Williams, 
and Russell Gentry. This excerpt illustrates how fictional jokes and 
real-life local character anecdotes are integrated into the general 
fabric of discussion. Talk starts about elders in the local Presby¬ 
terian church, and this sets up the first fictional joke about St. Peter 
and the two dollars. The theme of this joke is then applied to more 
local real life situations, until one of the barbers offers a second 
fictional joke, about the lack of lawyers in Heaven. This idea is then 
at once applied to a local sermon preached the Sunday before about lawyers; 
one customer, a retired lawyer, is reassured that nothing was said about 
him. The old lawyer then tells a story about a man who wanted to appeal 
his case. After an interval, this calls forth an apparently unrelated 
story about the peg-leg moonshiner, a local character; this in turn calls 
forth two other stories about local moonshiners. 
6. Hen Party Stories; actuality. Stone Mountain Craft Shop; white; 
18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R63. 
A local "hen party" (the term used by the participants) of 
women in the Traphill community provides a feminine counterpart to the 
male story-telling session just heard. The women participating here 
include Ruth Holbrook and four of her friends. In contrast to the 
stories told by the men in the Sparta barber shop, these stories are all 
personal experience anecdotes, and all have a slightly off-color in¬ 
formality; this particular sequence of stories was told at the end of a 
ninety-minute party in which a variety of longer personal experience anec¬ 
dotes had been told. One speaker tells a story about a corncob, another 
woman then tells a story about converting buttwipers to backscratchers. 
Ruth Holbrook, at the fieldworker's urging, tells about how to flush an 
outdoor toilet; this leads to an account of the Sunday School teacher. 
Ruth then tells about the "bandaid" bikini, which is responded to by a 
story about topless horseback riders, followed by one about a see-through 
blouse, and Ruth concludes with a story about the boy in cut-offs.

1. Telling Jokes to Uncle Emory; woman storyteller, narrative; 
white; 15 September 1978; North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R59- 
Even informal storytellers are often self-concious of their 
abilities, as this narrative demonstrates. The two jokes are embroi¬ 
dered in the framework of a story about a visit to a sick uncle. A 
psychologist might s culate that such "framing" redeems the fact that 
both are slightly off-color, and the fact that it cheers up a sick man 
provides a utilitarian justification for such frivolous pursuits as 
joke-telling. 
2. Bluegrass Sally Ann and Bill Cheatham; instrumental performances 
by jam session band, including Lonnie Cole (fiddle), Ronnie Lyon (man¬ 
dolin), Wendell Cockerham (banjo), Bobby Harrison (guitar), and Michael 
Smith (string bass); white; 27 September 1978; Hillsville, Virginia; 
Tom Adler, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-TA-R42. 
Shockley’s Shell Service Station in downtown Hillsville is a 
local fathering place for bluegrass jam sessions, usually on Tuesday 
nights. The action usually starts around 8:00 p.m. and soon the inside 
of the station is jammed with pickers and onlookers; "A lot of nights 
there ure so many cars in here that we can't even get to the pumps to 
wait on customers," remarked Tom Ferris, one of the attendants. This 
excerpt offers a glimpse of how the tunes in such a jam session are 
chosen; it begins by Schockley reminding the musicians that he’s in no 
hurry to closed down for the night. The impromptu nature of the music 
is underscored by the voices advising what key a number is in and by 
some confusion over the banjo-fiddle exchange of leads in "Bluegrass 
Sally Ann." The musicians all come from the Hillsville-Galax area, and 
two of the, Wendell Cockerham and Ronnie Lyon, have recently recorded 
(with, respectively. The Mountain Ramblers and Joe Ed King). 
3. Fox Hunters’ Field Trial; actuality, featuring voice of Peter 
Cole; white; 1 September 1978; near Elk Hill, Carroll County, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe and Carl Fleischhauer, fieldworkers, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-CW-R3. 
Over the Labor Day weekend, the Twin County Fox Hunters Club, 
from Grayson and Carroll counties, held an all-night field trial for their 
fox hounds. The event attracted over 180 entries and reflected the popu¬ 
larity of fox hunting as a "gentleman's sport" in the region; fox hunters 
point with pride to the fact that George Washington started the sport in 
this country. This field trial consisted of a bench show, where the dogs 
were judged on the basis of conformation, and an all night run, wherein 
the dogs were cast at a certain point and scored by judges roaming the 
area throughout the night. (Each dog was identified by a number painted 
on his side.) The next morning the scores were totalled and prizes were 
awarded. Heard here are three different segments from the field trial 
recordings: in the first segment, Pete Cole, the master of the hounds. 
-28- 
instructs his judges prior to the cast; in the second. Cole supervises 
the loading of the hounds into trucks to he carried to the point where 
they will he released; in the third, we hear the sounds of the cast and 
the hounds running through the woods at night. 
1+. Rafe Brady's Fox Hunt; Rafe Brady, fiddle and vocal, with Dean 
Brady (guitar), Jim Marshall (5-string hanjo), Artie Marshall (guitar), 
and Ronnie Lyon, (mandolin); white; 28 September 1978; Hillsville, 
Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R92. 
For generations traditional southern fiddlers have attempted 
to recreate the sounds of a fox chase on their instruments and 65-year- 
old Rafe Brady, from Laurel Fork, Virginia, is no exception. Brady's 
commentary localizes the piece, with specific local place names, and 
his tune is somewhat different from the normal tune used hy fiddlers 
for the fox hunt imitation. Brady recorded an earlier version of this 
piece for the Library of Congress in 1937 (13^7 B2, mislabelled as by 
"Drake" Brady), a! version almost identical to this one done 4l years 
later. 
5. Little Massey Grove; sung by Eunice McAlexander; white; 21 Sep¬ 
tember 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Wally Macnow, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-WM-R2. 
The unaccompanied singing of old ballads, one of the most 
classic forms of folkmusic, is almost extinct today in the Blue Ridge, 
though it was flourishing there as recently as fifty years ago. The 
few remaining singers are highly self-concious preservers of the art, 
like Eunice McAlexander, who has been recording her songs and ballads 
for folklorists since the 1930's. Here she sings an old British ballad 
about marital infidelity that was quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher's 
l6ll drama, The Knight of the Burning Pestle. (Child, James F., ^ 
The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v. II, p. 242 ff, 8l. 'Little 
Musgrave and Lady Barnard.")

of Clark's Creek Progressive Primitive Baptist Church; black; 10 
September 1978; near Ararat, Patrick County, Virginia; Blanton Owen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-BO-R29. 
This is an excerpt from a rural black service that features 
testimony by a congregation member, followed by a spiritual. "Satan 
Your Kingdom Must Come Down" was not sung from a hymnbook and the 
pianist gives up trying to follow the song after a few bars. 
2. What A Time We're Living In; Reverend Robert Akers, vocal, with 
W.C. (Calvin) Hawkins, second voice, and Junior Hawkins (piano), Alex 
Shupe (guitar), Donnie Felts (electric bass), and Kim Shupe (drums): 
white; 20 August 1978; Galax, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-B0-R11. 
Tent revivals are popular in the Blue Ridge and one of the 
more successful ones is run by Reverend Robert Akers of Hillsville.. 
Akers' revivals contain about as muc}i music as preaching—music which 
owes stylistic debts to modern black gospel and country music as well 
as traditional rural hymnody. This is one of a number of original 
gospel songs composed by Akers and it uses a number of traditional 
call-and-response patterns and imagery. 
3. Preaching by Inspiration; Quincy Higgins, narration and singing, 
white; 9 September 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and 
Pat Mullen, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R31. 
This is a sort of cante fable—a mixture of song and story— 
designed to support one of the strongest tenants of southern rural. . ^ 
Protestantism: the value of "inspiration" over "book learning." Higgins' 
story also has subtle class overtones, as well as implications for the 
whole ethos of traditional versus modern. Mr. Higgins, born in 1900, 
has been a farmer most of his life and is a member of the Big Springs 
Regular Baptist Church. 
b Hymn #6l; sung by congregation of Crossroads Primitive Baptist 
Church; white; 20 August 1978; Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia; Carl 
Fleischhauer, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
This example of unaccompanied congregational singing (from^ 
Dalv's Primitive Baptist Hymn Book) is one of the oldest and purest 
type? of religious music still extant in the Blue Ridge. The Primitive 
Baptist Church, which discourages the use of instruments or specialty 
singing in church, is very strong in the area and accounts for the 
strength of this tradition.

5. Conversion Story, Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; IT August 
1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl 
Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
One of the most prevalent forms of story-telling extant 
in the Blue Ridge today is the "conversion story:" personal experi¬ 
ence narratives about how the story-teller found religion and joined 
the church. Similar stories were collected from both whites and 
blacks. 
6. Amazing Grace;sung by the congregation of the Macedonia Baptist 
Church, lined out by Deacon Walter Brown; black; 10 September 1978; 
near Sparta, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe and Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R25. 
"Lining out" hymns dates from the time when only the preacher 
(or song-leader) had a hymn book, and consists of the song-leader 
chanting a line of the hymn to the congregation, followed by the con¬ 
gregation singing the line. This practice is found in both white and 
black churches, though it is preserved today out of a self-concious 
gense of tradition rather than as a functional necessity.

3. Somewhere Listening for My Name; same as #1, except BR8-CW-R26. 
These three consecutive performances from a service at the 
rural Macedonia Baptist Church suggest some of the interplay and flow 
of a black service. The piano player continues to play behind Reverend 
Young's excellent prayer, giving it an added emotional and aesthetic 
dimension. "Somewhere Listening for My Name" was completely ad lib: 
the preacher had stepped up to the lectern to begin the sermon when 
song—leader Leonard Bryan began, without benefit of book or warning 
the choir. 
H. Conversion Experience; Florence Cheek, narration; white; 19

These four hymns (taken from Stamps-Baxter's Favorite Songs 
p.nd Hymns) were all done at one morning's service at the Laurel Glenn

routinely heard in one church. The styles range from the older "unison" 
style with harmony or "part" work ("How Happy Are They"), to the more 
modern gospel-quartet style of the call-and-response pattern ("When the 
Redeemed Are Gathering In), and an example of lining a hymn ("Must Jesus

2. Wayfaring Stranger; as for #1. 
3- Holding to His Hand of Love; sung unaccompanied by the Schuyler 
Family; white; H September 1978; Lowgap, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R13. 
This reel consists of various performances by different white 
gospel music groups in the study area; they cover a spectrum from the 
most traditional unaccompanied family Ringing styles to bluegrass gospel 
to more modern country-tinged gospel. This spectrum, along with more 
modern and more fully amplified forms of gospel music is widespread in 
the area today; indeed, gospel music is more prevalent than the fiddle 
and banjo music customarily associated with the Blue Ridge. 
"Palms of Victory" is suing by Marshall Largen, a part-time 
independent preacher, his two daughters, Barbara and Brenda, and an 
old friend. Bill Scott. Mr. Largen has a regular weekly radio program 
in Hillsville, Virginia (WHHV), and has lived in the Laurel Fork area 
all of his life. "Palms of Victory" (also known as "Deliverance Will 
Come") has been rather widely known and recorded, but the Largens, as 
well as other local gospel singers, insist the song originated in the 
southwestern Virginia area and was a local favorite. Both this song 
and "Wayfaring Stranger" were sung from old shape-note paperbacked song 
books. 
The Schuyler Family, consisting of E. Caldwell Schuyler, his 
wife. Avis, and son, Trent, has been singing together for twelve years, 
usually without accompaniment. Today they routinely make two to three 
appearances a week at area churches, accepting only "gas money" for 
their work. This song, taken from a 1937 Stamps-Baxter shape note song 
book, demonstrates the "afterbeat," an "echo" effect so characteristic of 
modern gospel quartet music, introduced in the late 1920's by Tennessee 
music publisher James D. Vaughn.

Mrs. Ella Draughan, j6, has recently been playing piano with 
the Schuyler Family in their church appearances. She toured with seve¬ 
ral regionally famous gospel quartets, playing on the radio and at rural 
schoolhouses in the 1930's and 19H0's. As part of a typical concert in 
those days, she would play one or two "piano specials", such as the ones 
she plays: driving, almost ragtime performances of exuberant gospel 
hymns. 
"Where We'll Never Grow Old" is sung in the "classic" quartet 
style that originated in the 1920's and has come to dominate mainstream 
white gospel music. This particular song was one of the first gospel 
songs to become widely popular on records, when it was recorded by 
Smith's Sacred Singers, a Georgia group, in 1925. The Schuyler Family 
here is joined by an old singing companion, A.P. Thompson; now 79 years 
old, Mr. Thompson was an original member of The Red Fox Chasers, a famous 
old-time string band from Surry County which recorded prolifically in the 
late 1920's. Though he no longer sings regularly with a quartet, Mr. 
Thompson still has a fine, clear voice. 
7. The Other Side of Jordan; sung and played by The Elk Horn Four, 
consisting of Warren Lowe (lead singer and rhythm guitar), his wife, 
Ethel Lowe (harmony vocal and electric bass), Edward Spears (lead accous- 
tic guitar), and JoAnne Monk (piano); white; 19 September 1978; near 
Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R59. 
Here is a modern gospel song performed by a local group that 
performs in the Grayson and Carroll county area. The sound of the group 
(especially the harmony), as well as the type of songs they perform, 
shows the influence of country music on the gospel tradition. 
8. Tell Me His Name Again; Larry Richardson, vocal and guitar; white; 
12 September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-CW-R3^. 
"Tell Me His Name Again" is an original composition by Larry 
Richardson, a friend of the Lowe family documented in the preceding 
selection. Richardson was, until about ten years ago, a nationally 
known bluegrass performer and frequent winner of the banjo and guitar 
contests at the Galax fiddlers' convention. His 1955 recording of "Let 
Me Fall" was one of the most influential bluegrass records of the time. 
After undergoing a personal crisis, Richardson joined the church and for 
a time stopped playing completely. When he resumed performing a few years 
ago, he decided to play only gospel music, albeit in a solid bluegrass 
style. He now travels the country as an evangelist, singing, picking, and 
preaching in churches from Ohio to Florida.

9. Twilight is Falling; Jim Marshall, vocal and 5-string banjo, 
with Artie Marshall, harmony vocal and guitar; white; 1^ September 1978; 
near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles Wolfe and Howard Marshall, fieldworkers, 
and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R37• 
Jim Marshall explains that this is an old song once associated 
with Robert Sheffey, a famous circuit-riding preacher from nearby Wythe 
County Virginia who travelled the area in the nineteenth century. After 
Jim heard about Sheffey and his song, he began to hunt for the song and 
finally found a copy in a song book published by Albert Brumley in 
Missouri. He and his wife perform the old hymn in classic bluegrass style 
and it is a favorite with friends and fans of the Marshalls in south¬ 
western Virginia.

1. Uncle Ennis and the Snake; Ben Junior Harris, narration; white; 
29 August 1918; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R26. 
Jokes about preachers were reasonably common in the area, and 
this character anecdote, with its blunt punch line, is typical of such 
stories. 
2. Baptizing at Carson's Creek; actuality, featuring the voices of 
Reverend J.L. Byrd and Reverend Cecil, with E.C. Schuyler, song-leader; 
White; ;7 September 1978; near Lowgap, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R58. 
River baptism is still common in rural North Carolina, and 
the location in Carson's Creek has for generations served the needs of 
many of the churches in Surry County. In this excerpt members of the 
Mountain View Baptist Church participate in the baptizing of several 
new members. After each immersion, the congregation standing on the 
banks sings a few bars of "Oh Happy Day." At the end of the immersions, 
both preachers, still standing in the water, deliver impromptu sermons 
to the congregation on the bank. 
3. Conversion Experience; Leonard Bryan and Mrs. Mamie Bryan, narra¬ 
tion; wfcitn; 6 September 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R37. 
Compare this story with related items on Reel 9> #5> Reel 10, 
A, and #9. 
4. I'm Going Away; sung with piano accompaniment by the assembled 
members of the New Covenant Association, meeting at Redmond Creek Baptist 
Church; white; 17 September 1978; near Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia; 
Pat Mullen and Charles Wolfe, fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; 
BR8-CW-R69. 
The New Covenant Association is an organization of black Baptist 
churches in the southwestern Virginia-northwestern North Carolina area, 
and the members all get together once a year for a day-long session of 
preachingj singing, and "dinner on the ground." This performance, on 
which perhaps as many as 150 voices are heard, preceded the preaching in 
the Sunday morning service. 
5. A Home in Heaven; sung by Mr. and Mrs. Jess Higgins; white; 23 
September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson and Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-CW-R69. 
For twelve years. Elder Jess Higgins (of the Galax Primitive 
Baptist Church) has had his own radio program over local station WBOB. 
On that thirty-minute program. Elder Higgins and his wife sing un¬ 
accompanied songs and deliver a quarter—hour message. Higgins tapes 
each show in his home late Saturday night Before the Sunday it is to 
be broadcast. This selection was recorded as Higgins taped his show 
for Sunday, 2b September 1978. The song is from The Primitive Baptist 
Hymn Book. 
6. Statement About Gospel Music; Jess Higgins, narration; as for #5, 
except from tape BR8-CW-R70. 
7- TOiey Crucified the Savior; Rafe Brady, fiddle and vocal, with Dean 
Brady (guitar), Jim Marshall (banjo), Artie Marshall (guitar), and Ronnie 
Lyon (mandolin): white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R93. 
Gospel music is so pervasive in the Blue Ridge that even a 
hard-living traditional old-time fiddler like Rafe Brady has a sacred 
song or two in his repertory.

APPENDIX 2 
SEEDS PLANTED WHEN THE EARTH IS— 
In Aries, which is a Movable Fire Sign, 
governed by the Sun, make rapid growth 
and abundance of straw and tops, ac¬ 
cording as the Moon is old or new. 
In Taurus, which is a Fixed Earthly 
Sign, governed by Mercury, will do good 
for all root crops of quick growth, 
i In Gemini, which is a Barren Sign, 
will not make a good growth. This is a 
good time to stir the soil and subdue all 
noxious weeds. 
In Ganger, \yhich is a Watery, Fruit¬ 
ful Movable Sign, germinate quickly. It 
is favorable to growth and insures an 
abundant yield. 
In Leo, which is a Barren, fiery Sign, 
will die, as it is only favorable to the de¬ 
struction of noxious growth. Trim no 
trees or vines when the Moon or Earth 
is in Leo, for they will surely die. 
In Virgo, which is also a Barren sign, 
as it is unfavorable to growth of seed or 
transplanting. 
In Libra, which is a strong Movable 
Sign, does well, it is next after Cancer 
for good effect. Seed planted at this time 
produces vigorous pulp growth and roots 
and a reasonable amount of grain. 
In Scorpio, which is Fruitful, produc¬ 
ing Watery effects. Next best after 
Cancer. 
In Sagittarius, which is a Fiery, Mac- 
culine Sign, will not do well, as it is not 
a very favorable time to plant or trans¬ 
plant. 
In Capricorn, which is a Moist, Mov¬ 
able Sign, will produce a rapid growth of 
pulp, stalks or roots, but not much grain. 
In Aquarius, which is an Airy, Mascu¬ 
line Sign, is only thrown away, as it will 
not grow well. 
In Pisces, which is Fruitful, Watery 
Feminine Sign, will produce excellent re¬ 
sults and is third best sign for producing 
the fruits of the earth. 
in. The Fire Signs are second best. Never 
gather fruit, grain or vegetables in the 
Watery Signs or new of the moon, as 
they will surely decay or sprout. Just 
before full Moon is the best to gather for 
shipping. 
All plants, trees and vegetables plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon will grow 
vigorously. All crops that produce their 
yield above the ground should be plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon. Those that 
produce their yield in the ground should 
be planted in the old of the moon. 
Aries, Taurus, Libra and Capricorn 
are good Fruitful Signs. Cancer, Scorpio 
and Pisces are the best and most pro¬ 
ductive in the order named, being wa¬ 
tery they assist vegetation to withstand 
drought and produce much fruit and 
grain. Sagittarius and Aquarius are poor 
Signs. Leo, Gemini and Virgo are Bar¬ 
ren, the strongest in the order named, 
and are best to destroy weeds and all 
noxious growth. The first day the Moon 
is in a Sign is better than the second and 
the second is better than the third. 
@ New Moon, Increasing 
During this Moon plant the following: 
Asparagus, Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, 
Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celery, Corn, Cu¬ 
cumbers, Endive, Kohlrabi, Leeks, Let¬ 
tuce, Spinach, Barley, Oats, Rye, Wheat.

Selected Sound Recordings 
from the 
Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project 
Edited and annotated by 
Charles K. Wolfe 
American Folklife Center 
Library of Congress 
Washington, D.C. 
PREFACE 
These notes accompany a selection of sound recordings 
prepared for presentation to the National Park Service from the 
Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project (1978) 
The set consists of twelve reels of audio tape, each reel 
consisting of several performances or actualities. Many of the 
recordings are in stereo. The twelve tapes are arranged into four 
major groups: 
Reels 1-3 document the "Sense of Time" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels h-6 document the "Sense of Place" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels 7-8 offer a sampling of "Traditional Social Life" in 
rural Blue Ridge communities visited hy the project; and 
Reels 9-12 explore the varieties of religious expression in 
the traditional communities on the Blue Ridge. 
These selections were made hy Charles Wolfe, the Field 
Coordinator for the Project. In the end, the choices are somewhat 
arbitrary and subjective, but they were made with an overview of 
the project provided by personal experience, as well as the reports, 
tape logs, and suggestions of other fieldworkers. These fieldworkers 
included Pat Mullen, Ohio State University; Geraldine Johnson, 
Strayer College; Blanton Owen, Ferrum College; Margaret Owen, Ferrum 
College; Tom Adler, Indiana University; and Howard Marshall and Carl 
Fleischhauer of the American Folklife Center. 
The headings for each selection provide the following 
information: 
Selection title; name of artist; instrumentation; black or 
white cultural group; recording date; location of recording; name 
of fieldworker; name of recordist; project tape number. 
The original recordings are at the Library of Congress, 
and copies have been presented to the Blue Ridge Parkway. 
-3- 
1. Stories about Daniel Boone; Mr. and Mrs. Quincy Higgins, 
narration; white; 9 September 1978; Higgins home, Sparta, North 
Carolina; Pat Mullen and Geraldine Johnson, fieldworkers and 
recordists; BR8-PM-RU2. 
Daniel Boone has been the subject of all sorts of legends, 
some stimulated by popular culture, others genuine forms of tradi¬ 
tional folklore. Quincy Higgins' tales about Boone are noteworthy 
in two respects: they are closely tied to area land features, and 
they are related in some way to modern life. It is almost as if 
Higgins is seeking to verify the reality of his historical accounts 
of Boone by using the present(e.g., placenames with Boone's name) 
as proof. The story of Boone shooting Indians as they jumped off 
a cliff in revenge for the death of his son does not appear in any 
standard biographies of Boone. 
2. The Hoop Snake; Fred Lowe, narration; white; 7 September 
1978; Fisher Gap, near Lowgap, North Carolina (Surry County); 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-C3. 
Another genre of "classic" folklore that reflects and 
preserves the past is the tall tale. Fred Lowe's tale of the grand¬ 
father's encounter with a rolling snake is of special interest because 
it can be traced in Surry County as far back as 1859* In that year 
virtually the same story appears in a book called Fisher's River 
(North Carolina) Scenes and Characters by Harden E. Taliaferro, a 
Baptist minister who revisited his native county in 1857 to gather 
material for the book. In that book the tale is attributed to Uncle 
Davy Lane, who asserted that it described a personal experience. Lowe 
continues this tradition of "personalizing" the narrative by asserting 
that the story happened to his grandfather, and by sprinkling it with 
local place names and framing it with other stories about his grand¬ 
father's Civil Wax experiences. This story has also been widely 
collected in Kentucky. 
3. The Ballad of Caty Sage; sung by J.C. Pierce; white; 22 Septem¬ 
ber 1978; Pierce home, near Coal Creek, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R69. 
A favorite way of celebrating and preserving dramatic or 
touching events of local history has always been the localized event 
ballad. One of the oldest such events commemorated in the Blue Ridge 
area is the abduction of five-year-old Caty Sage by Indians from her 
home in rural Grayson County in 1792. Fifty-six years later a brother 
found her in eastern Kansas, living with the Wyandot Indians; he tried 
to pursuade her to return to her family in Virginia, but before she 
could she died of pneumonia. About 19^0, J.C. Pierce, a local singer 
and guitarist, read a poem about Caty Sage by Eva Boyer, in the Galax 
newspaper. Impressed, he set the poem to music, and sung it at the 
Galax fiddlers' contest that year. It intrigued some folklorists who 
were present and Pierce was soon invited to record the song for the 
Library of Congress. Pierce, who later became a Galax policeman, 
has continued to perform the song since then, copyrighted it and 
recorded it commercially, and has written a short history of the 
Sage story. 
H. Witch Stories; Will Barnard, narration; white; 12 August 1978; 
Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-PM-R3. 
Yet another genre of "classic" folklore is the supernatural 
legend and a surprising number of these are found in the Blue Ridge 
area even today. Most of Will Barnard's witch stories relate in 
some way to his immediate family, and thus are tied up with his own 
personal sense of the past. The witch described here is buried in 
the Barnard family graveyard. In this region, the word witch is 
used to refer either to a man or a woman. 
5• The Murder of the Lawson Family; sung by Artie Marshall, 
accompanied by herself on guitar and by Jim Marshall on 5-string 
banjo; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R97- 
In late 1929 a Surry County man named Charlie Lawson went 
berserk and murdered his entire family, and by March 1930 a song 
about the tragedy had been recorded by a singing team called the 
Carolina Buddies. It soon became widely popular in the area and 
remains so today. The song is an early instance of a local event 
song going into tradition via the medium of the phonograph record. 
The song follows the form of many event ballads of the 1920's, giv¬ 
ing specific details about the tragedy and concluding with some 
gesture toward moral judgement. Artie Marshall has known the song 
since childhood. 
6. Legends of Charlie Lawson; Herbert Fulk, narration; white; 
17 August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Folk memory of Charlie Lawson, in coming to grips with the 
horror of a rural society having in its midst a mass murderer, has 
attached a variety of supernatural elements to Lawson. Herbert 
Fulk, who insists that as a boy he slept with Lawson shortly before 
the murder, gives some examples of these legends in his accounts of 
the haunted "graphophone" and the bewitched car—both once possessions 
of Lawson. It is noteworthy how these traditional supernatural ele¬ 
ments have been attached to two symbols of modern society: the record 
player and the automobile.

1• The Vengeful Ghost; Herbert Fulk, narration; white; 17 
August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Herbert Fulk tells this classic ghost story as a personal 
experience narrative with a good sense of pacing and detail. Espe¬ 
cially noteworthy is casual way in which the narrator relates to the 
ghost and in the colorful, idiomatic language used by both ghost and 
narrator. The story was told in a context that included other per¬ 
sonal experience supernatural tales, including the stories about 
Charlie Lawson (Reel 1, selection #6). 
2. School Children’s Rhymes and Parodies; sung by children from 
Mrs. Holland's fourth grade class. Blue Ridge Elementary School; 
black and white; 12 September 1978; Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R18. 
Children's folklore often displays a delightful irreverance 
for the past, as shown by the two parodies here of a venerable Blue 
Ridge traditional song, "On Top of Old Smoky." Both of these parodies 
are well known, and have been collected from children across the coun¬ 
try; texts similar to those here appear, for instance, in Mary and 
Herbert Knapp's One Potato, Two Potato: The Folklore of American 
Children (Norton, 1976). Such folklore of children at once ridicules 
the past and yet at the same time preserves it. 
3. Forecasting Rain; Cosby Golding, narrative; white; 8 August 1978; 
Surry County, near Lowgap, North Carolina; Blanton Owen, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-B0-R1. 
^ Quilts and Fortune; actuality. Baptist Church Quilting Group; 
white; 1^ September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R56. 
Not every response to time in traditional life is tied to 
the past; there are a vast number of methods of forecasting the future. 
Here are two different contexts for such forecasting: Cosby Golding 
relates his predictions of rain to natural signs; the ladies in the 
quilting group use various domestic images, such as quilts, mirrors 
and apple seeds. All the informants here are a little unsure of the 
efficacy of the signs, and all nervously qualify their faith in the 
signs—yet they have thought enough of them to have preserved them 
throughout the years. All the predictions are highly personal in 
nature; none pretend to foretell, for instance, national trends or 
the fates of famous people, as do predictions in mass media.

5. The Reaper in the Elements; Marvin Lyon, narration; white; 
5 September 1978; Roaring Gap, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-PM-R33. 
Many local anecdotes collected in the project were built 
around the theme of changing times. Though technology came to the 
Blue Ridge reasonably early (a paved highway up the ridge to Meadows 
of Dan was completed as early as 1928), people here, as elsewhere, 
love to tell stories of an old man seeing his first car, his first 
train, his first airplane, etc. Such accounts serve to dramatize 
the cultural and economic changes wrought by technology, and empha¬ 
size the difference between life "now" and "in the old days." 
6. Courtship Story; Dean and Estelle Gambill, joint narration; 
black; 30 August 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R30. 
Courtship stories and religious conversion stories formed 
the most common types of personal experience narrative collected in 
the project. This particular story is structurally interesting in 
the way Estelle offers an account from her point of view, bringing 
the tale through to marriage, and then her husband backs up and fills 
in gaps by telling the story from his point of view. Both narratives 
are full of detail and well formed, suggesting that both husband and 
wife are used to telling the story to children, grandchildren, and 
friends. The Gambills are both in their seventies, and Dean, a re¬ 
tired farmer, mail carrier, and store clerk, spent the years 1916- 
1927 in West Virginia, mining coal—as did many blacks along the 
ridge. 
7. Slavery and Modern Times; Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; 
17 August 1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and 
Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R12. 
Jesse Lee Hatcher was one of our best informants from the 
perspective of integrating past and present; Mr. Hatcher had an 
exceptionally sharp memory of turn-of-the-century life on the ridge, 
a graceful and articulate way of expressing it, and ability to con¬ 
trast it with modern life. Born in 1890 of parents who had been 
slaves, Jesse Hatcher spent most of his life as a farmer. He stays 
at his old home place near Ararat in the summers and in Richmond in 
the winter. His life-long struggle with discrimination and the after¬ 
effects of slavery are evident in these comments about the continuing 
effects of slavery in modern times.

1. Memories of the Depression;Mrs. Mae Willey, narration; white; 
22 August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R9. 
2. Hard Times; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white; 23 August 1978; 
and 18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson 
and Harley Jolley, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R13, 64. 
These two personal experience narratives describe the ways 
in which two women from the Blue Ridge deal with painful memories of 
the Depression. Mae Willey, the older of the two women, began her 
marriage during that time and tends to perceive the period as a 
time of testing that made her and her husband better, more self- 
sufficient people. Ruth Holbrook, born in 1924, was only five when the 
stock market crashed and lost all of her brothers and sisters during 
the Depression. She does not see the experience in any sort of posi¬ 
tive light and did not seem overly anxious to talk about it to the 
fieldworkers. (The Holbrook selection is composed of two segments 
from separate interviews conducted nearly a month apart.) Ruth Hol¬ 
brook went on to become a quilter, instructor in a community college, 
a member of a touring clogging team, and is currently sales manager 
for the Stone Mountain Craft Shop. 
3. "Women's Liberation Came Too Late For Me;" Ruth Newman, narration; 
white; 8 September 1978; Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R28. 
Ruth Geraldine Newman, a forty-nine-year old native of Galax, 
is a skillful cook and craftworker, as well as a published poet. She 
lives alone with her father in a rural area outside town. Her long 
account of her struggles to realize her own ambitions in the face of 
discouragement by parents and teachers remind us that tradition, for 
all of its stabilizing value, can also present great difficulties.

worker and recordist; BR8-PM-R33. 
2. How Traphill Got Its Name; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white;

BR8-PM-R18. 
^• How Galax Got Its Name; Ethel Brewer, narration; white; 8 
September 1978; Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-GJ-R26. 
5* Galax; Jim and Artie Marshall, banjo, guitar, and vocal; white; 
ll+ September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-CW-R39. 
What makes the culture of the rural Blue Ridge unique, and 
how is this uniqueness reflected in the folklife of the area? A 
natural starting point is the placenames of the area, and what these 
names mean to people in the area. Many of the people in the area 
know stories behind the placenames near them, though some know differ¬ 
ent stories about the same placename. The two accounts of how Traphill 
got its name illustrate this; these two accounts also illustrate 
different reasons for their preservation. Marvin lyon's story is rather 
straightforward and initiates a litany of other placenames; Ruth Hol¬ 
brook's tale, on the other hand, is tied to personal history: the story 
of "By Gravy" Tom, her grandfather, who carried mail through the land 
on foot. 
Fred Clifton's account of how Cloudbreak got its name is yet 
a third type: a tale reflecting a rather formal sense of community 
history. Clifton here is very much aware of the narrative quality of 
his account—unlike lyon, who doesn't set up much narrative or add much 
detail, or Holbrook, who invests the process with memories. 
While some placenames are derived from historical events, 
others are derived from natural features, as Ethel Brewer's account of 
naming Galax suggests. In fact, in this account we learn that names 
commemorating a historical event or person were rejected in favor of 
a "natural" name (even though the town was a "planned" community 
founded by the railroad). The Galax leaves, incidentally, provided a 
useful cash export crop for citizens of the area for years; these leaves 
are highly decorative and especially in demand around Christmas. 
Jim and Artie Marshall's song about Galax, and the discussion 
that follows, explores the way local people feel about the image Galax 
has acquired in more recent years. Today the place of Galax has become 
synonymous with a fiddling contest and festival "where old and young 
come to meet ," After he sings the song, Marshall and his wife discuss 
the impact the festival has had on the land itself, and the special prob¬ 
lems created by the massive "Stompin' '76" festival of a few years back.

"There was garbage everywhere," Artie Marshall says, "They even 
camped in the cemetery," an act symbolizing brutalization of both 
the past and the land. 
6. Gathering Ginseng; Fred Clifton, narration; white; 21 August 
1978; Vesta, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8- 
FM-R18. 
7• Home Remedies; Mr. and Mrs. Will Barnard, narration; white; 
12 August 1978; Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, 
and Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R4. 
8. The Balm of Gilead Tree; Jesse Hatcher, narration; white; 
17 August 1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen and Harley Jolley, 
fieldworkers, and Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R11. 
9. Magic Asthma Cure; Will Barnard, narration; white; 12 August 
1978; Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl 
Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R^. 
The next group of selections is designed to illustrate the 
various ways the people in the area make their physical environment 
a part of their physical lives. Ties to the land and geography are 
not merely historical but material as well, and over the years the 
people of the Blue Ridge have used folk medicines and home remedies 
indigenous to the immediate environment. 
For years ginseng has been a cash crop in the mountains 
and even today mountaineers jealously guard the secret locations of 
their ginseng patches; "poachers" will often strip a ginseng crop 
completely, destroying the growth for several years. Fred Clifton’s 
account of ginseng is also interesting in that it gives an insight 
into how the people in the area feel about ginseng's "medicinal" 
properties. 
Mr. and Mrs. Will Barnard offer a catalogue of home remedies 
made from local flora that the people trust more than ginseng: catnip 
tea, ground ivy tea, boneset, "red bloom weed," and others. Though 
some of the people still use these home remedies, the Barnards indicate 
that the tradition is declining. 
88-year-old Jesse Lee Hatcher discusses the medicinal proper¬ 
ties of the Balm of Gilead tree which he has growing in his yard. As 
Hatcher says, the Balm of Gilead is mentioned in the Bible, in Jeremiah 
8:22 and again in Genesis 37:25; there the term referred to the resin 
from the Styrax tree, produced especially in the north Transjordan 
region of Gilead, which was widely used for medicinal purposes. But 
it is important to note that Hatcher's "authority" for the belief is 
not only the Bible (Hatcher is a deacon in the local church) but the 
past: his parents used the remedy. Later Hatcher discusses his general 
attitude toward home remedies in the face of modern medicine. 
Will Barnard's description of a magic asthma (or "tizzy") cure 
-13- 
moves us from a simple physical link between man and nature to a more 
metaphysical type of sympathetic magic. Barnard's cure does not sim¬ 
ply involve the physical preparation of an ointment, tea, or balm, 
but involves ritual as well—what Mrs. Barnard calls "voodoo." In a 
broader sense, though, the underlying idea behind the cure is that 
man and nature function as one in a sort of mystic union of the en¬ 
vironment and the individual.

1. Planting by the Signs; Mr. and Mrs. Quincy Higgins, narration; 
white; 9 September 1918; Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen and 
Geraldine Johnson, fieldworkers, and Pat Mullen, recordist; BR8-PM-RW. 
2. Do Planting Signs Work?; Dean and Estelle Gambill, narration; 
black; 30 August 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldvorker and recordist; BR8-PM-R32. 
3. Planting Signs; Tim Slate, narration; white; 29 August 1978; 
Slate farm, near Claudville, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-B0-R20. 
The next eight selections form a sequence of statements 
about planting, harvesting, and preparation of food in the study 
area. Like home remedies, such lore is inextricably tied to the nature 
of the land itself and the attitude people have toward it. 
One part of such lore involves "planting by the signs:" 
keying the planting of crops to the position of the zodiac signs, so 
related to the parts of the body. Many calendars and almanacs cir¬ 
culated throughout the region give detailed, day-to-day information 
about the movement of these signs. One of the most common almanacs in 
the Blue Ridge area is Blum1s Almanac, which has been published in 
Winston-Salem since the l880's.* The use of this particular form of 
printed mass media to maintain a system of traditional lore has con¬ 
tinued for several generations. 
All three of these excerpts are characterized by an ambivalence 
toward planting signs. Mrs. Quincy Higgins' father never used the signs 
and yet she will "run and open the door and check" before she plants. 
Her husband asserts that, "it's been working through the ages," and that 
it is mentioned in the Bible. The Gambills, both in their seventies, 
disagree completely on the effectiveness of planting by the signs. 
Estelle uses the signs because her grandparents did, and because, "mama 
never planted nothing when the signs were not right;" her maintenance 
of this tradition is thus linked to her respect for her parents and grand¬ 
parents. Dean is far more pragmatic about planting and offers his own 
evidence to counter that of his wife. 
Tim Slate, a tobacco farmer in his twenties, is skeptical 
about using signs, but when asked outright if he does not believe in 
signs, he is quick to reply, "I didn't say that." Tim argues that his 
mother believes more strongly in signs than he does, and asserts that 
different books—different almanacs—contradict each other in giving 
day-to-day signs. But the fact that a young farmer in the area, even 
in this day of widespread community colleges, farm extension agents, 
and scientific farming, still has even this much interest in the signs, 
testifies to the strength of the tradition. 
*Sample pages from Blum’s Almanac are appended to these annotations.

22 August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R10. 
5. Canning Signs; Mae Willey, narration; white; 22 August 1978; 
Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker and recordist; BR8- 
GJ-R12. 
6. A Catalogue of Local Edible Greens; Ruth Newman, narration, 
white; 8 September 1978; Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R29. 
7- Fruit Drying Then and Now; Margaret Jarvis, narration; white; 
13 September 1978; Ennice, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker, and George Price, recordist; BR8-GJ-R43. 
8. Pickles and Canning Order; Mae Willey, narration; white; 22 
August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-GJ-R11. 
Like planting and harvesting, food preservation also con¬ 
tinues along traditional lines. Mae Willey is a modern, up-to-date 
woman living in a comfortable ranch-style house, but she allows her 
daily work to be structured by the age-old natural cycle of gardening. 
Just as there are the right signs for planting, so there are right 
signs for canning and preserving the harvest. 
Ruth Newman's catalogue of local greens includes dandelion, 
dock, lamb's quarter, blackberry briar leaves, "dooryard wood" (plantain), 
and "mousears." This catalogue provides an interesting parallel to the 
catalogue of home remedies (Will Barnard, Reel 4, #7) also drawn from 
local flora. 
Drying is one of the more common traditional means of food 
preservation in the Blue Ridge. Though many families in the area have 
home freezers, some continue to dry beans, apples, peaches, and even 
sweet potatoes simply because they prefer the taste of dried food to 
that of frozen food. In addition to the drying rack on a wood stove 
described by Margaret Jarvis, other drying methods include the use of 
"dry houses" (sheds with wood furnaces underneath for quick, hot drying) 
and automobiles. Apple slices, or similar fruits or vegetables, are 
placed in the window of a closed car where the sun can shine on them 
for several days. 
Mae Willey takes a great amount of pride in her home-canned 
goods; she knows her stock so well that she does not have to label jars, 
and is able to rotate old and new jars almost by instinct. Her attitude 
toward cleaning and dusting her supply of canned food suggests that she 
takes an aesthetic pride in the physical display of the goods: they are 
symbolic of her well-being, as well as her skill as a home-maker, and 
even of a certain structure and order in her life.

1. Working Tolacco;Slate Family, actuality; white; 22 August 1978; 
Dobbins Valley, near Stuart, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BB8-BO-R14. 
2. Storytelling and Tobacco Stringing; Tim and Beech Lee Slate, 
narration; white; 22 August 1978; Dobbins Valley, near Stuart, Virginia; 
Blanton Owen, fieldworker and recordist; BB8-BO-R15- 
3. Selling Tobacco at Auction; tobacco auction actuality, with Tim 
Slate; white; 26 September 1978; Mt. Airy, North Carolina (New Farmers 
Market); Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R84. 
This sequence chronicles the progress of Tim Slate's tobacco 
crop from harvesting to its sale at auction during the late summer of 
1978. Tobacco is an important cash crop both on top of the ridge 
(burley, air-cured) and beneath the ridge (bright leaf, flue cured), 
and it has been for years. In the first selection here you can hear 
the Slate family "priming" tobacco—breaking off the leaves— and we are 
introduced to young Tim Slate. 74-year-old Bernie Dollarhite then re¬ 
calls older methods of gathering the tobacco (spliting the stalks and 
hanging it by the stick), and Beech Slate weighs in with a story of how 
he used to prime tobacco all day and boil fifty gallons of "sugar liquor" 
at night. 
In the second excerpt we hear Tim and Beech Slate swapping 
stories while stringing the tobacco—putting it on sticks to hang in 
the curing barn. Two stories are told: the first is a piece of modern 
folklore concerning the alleged presence of Patty Hearst at a local 
dance; the second is a well-known joke about a mule who, during a heat 
wave, saw corn pop on the stalk in the field and, thinking it was snow, 
froze to death. Both modern and classic folklore here serve the same 
function and in this context the story-tellers make little distinction 
between the two. 
Selection #3 documents the day Tim Slate and his sister took 
his tobacco to be auctioned at the New Farmer's Market in Mt. Airy. 
This selection consists of three separate parts: 
1. Tim Slate talking to Charles Wolfe shortly after a 
government inspector placed a minimum support price 
on Tim's stacks; 
2. the sounds of auctioneers selling two of Tim's stacks; 
3. Tim reacting to the prices he got for what amounted 
to a good part of his summer's work, and reflecting 
on the -uncertainties of tobacco farming in general. 
4. My Virginia Rose; Artie Marshall, guitar and vocal with banjo by 
Jim Marshall; white; 14 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R38.

5- Outsiders in the Mountains; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white; 
8 August 1978; Stone Mountain Craft Shop, Traphill, North Carolina; 
Pat Mullen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R23. 
The next five selections on this reel explore the different 
ways people in the Blue Ridge come to grips with the stereotyped "hill¬ 
billy" image thrust on them by the outside world. There are a surprising 
number of different responses to this image, some dating back several 
generations, some relatively new. 
One of these responses involves the gradual acceptance and 
even appropriation of such stereotypes by hill people themselves. "Lfy 
Virginia Rose"is one of a number of old Tin Pan Alley songs romantici¬ 
zing the hills or the South which became very popular with early country 
musicians. Many of these songs were designed for the vaudeville or 
minstrel stage and written by tunesmiths who had never seen the moun¬ 
tains; they gradually found their way into the South and more than a 
few entered oral tradition. "My Virginia Rose" was originally recorded 
by the Carter Family in 1936—one of a number of such sentimental, 
romantic songs they helped to popularize. 
Ruth Holbrook's subtle guerrilla action against snobbish out¬ 
siders who come into her shop represents rejection of these stereotypes. 
Ruth complains that not all stereotyping necessarily comes from northerners, 
but that some of it comes from fellow North Carolinians who live down on 
the Piedmont or near the coast. In some of her tricks and jokes, she 
uses an age-old ploy and lets her subjects' own hasty prejudgements 
lead them into foolish moves. 
6* We Are The Hillbillies; Eunice McAlexander, narration; white; 
lit September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and Terry Eiler and Richard McCamant, recordists; BR8-GJ-R55. 
7* Growing Up In Lowgap; (including performance of "Blue Moon of 
Kentucky"); Fern Evans, narration and vocal lead, with Melrose Smith 
(Fern's sister) (electric bass), Melanie Smith (banjo), Bruce Evans 
(Fern's son) (rhythm guitar), and Brian Smith (snare drum); white; 
22 September 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R66. 
8* The Hillbilly Kid on State; Boyden Carpenter, narrative; white; 
25 September 1978; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-CW-R81. 
it Reruns of old television shows depicting rural stereotypes, 
such as'The Andy Griffith Show"and"Beverly Hillbilliesare still very 
popular on the Blue Ridge. In fact, a number of inhabitants insist 
that the "Mayberry" of"The Andy Griffith Show" was in reality Sparta, 
North Carolina and are rather proud of this fact. Yet, as Eunice 
McAlexander points out, many children from the area do not associate 
themselves with the stereotype hillbillies of these shows. 
-20- 
Groving Up in Lovgap represents a more modern response to 
the hillbilly stereotype, one that is tied to upward mobility and what 
might be termed "hillbilly chic." The family of Fern Evans—the Ramey 
Family— has genuine roots in rural Surry County, and Fern herself per¬ 
formed in the 1930's and 19^-0's with famous traditional musicians like 
Tommy Jarrell. Yet most members of the family are now rather well-to-do 
and musically and culturally sophisticated; they count among their 
acquaintances Nashville country music stars like Ronnie Stoneman. In 
this selection, we hear Fern deliberately exaggerating her "hillbilly" 
background, which she had sought for years to overcome, and using it to 
introduce another romanticizing song, "Blue Moon of Kentucky." (The song 
itself was written and popularized by blue grass star Bill Monroe in 
19^6.) When she comments, "We were poor before it became popular to 
be poor," she is revealing much of the impulse underlying this newer 
attitude toward stereotyping. 
Boyden Carpenter is from nearby Alleghany County, North 
Carolina, and was one of the first traditional musicians in the area 
to try to commercially exploit his hillbilly image. By 1930 he was 
a successful radio performer, billing himself as "The Hillbilly Kid," 
and sprinkling his performances with jokes and stories emphasizing from 
how far back in the hills he had come. The stage costume he describes 
was not all that different from the ones worn by many other genuine 
traditional mountain musicians who tried to perform commercially in the 
early days of country music. Ironically, these costumes were as 
successful with rural audiences as with northern or urban vaudeville 
and radio audiences; even popular radio shows like "The Grand Ole Opry" 
and "National Barn Dance" utilized such "hayseed" images. 
9. The New River Blues; Jim Marshall, vocal and banjo, with Artie 
Marshall, guitar; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R96. 
The set of performances illustrating "sense of place" con¬ 
cludes with a self-described "protest song" by Jim Marshall, a former 
truck driver and part-time auctioneer from Hillsville, Virginia. The 
song was written in 1976 during the successful fight against the plan 
to dam the New River. Its concluding stanzas summarize much of the 
fierce pride in the land felt by the people of the Blue Ridge—as well 
as their fear that the land is being threatened by forces in modern 
society. 
You took our mountains and our rivers, 
Turned them to a rich playground. 
Take our homes to build your dams. 
So in luxury you can abound. 
You bought our lawmen with your money. 
So they'll vote for what you say. 
Why don't you stay in your big cities. 
And leave our land for another day? 
-21- 
Where are you gonna take your children. 
Show them nature at its test? 
If you dam up the last river. 
You might as well take all the rest.

After declining in the 1950's, regular weekly square dances 
are again becoming popular in the Blue Ridge; such dances are routinely 
advertised in local papers and nearly always feature live string band 
music. One of the busiest "working bands" in the Galax area is that of 
Whit (Howdy) Sizemore, who play a couple of dances a week, in addition 
to radio work and promotional work for local merchants. The weekly 
dance at Fairview, Virginia, has been held for about eleven years and 
now occurs in a large, modern building. Officially no drinking is 
allowed and an admission fee of $2.00 to $3.00 is charged. One of the 
band members asserted, "We really pack'em in here in winter. On a good 
night this winter we're likely to make as much as $45.00 each." Most 
of the dances are called, though on occasion the caller will sit out and 
let the dancers do free form buck dancing; often the caller will take 
microphone in hand and get down off the stage to call as he joins the 
dancers. At this dance, cornmeal was sprinkled on the hardwood floor and 
this accounts for the shuffling sound heard on the selection. The caller, 
Brian Bollinger, learned the art some forty years ago when he would go 
by wagon to the famous fiddling contests at White Top, Virginia; like 
many callers, he half speaks, half sings through the selection. "Sugar 
Hill" is a widely known tune in the area. This selection (like many 
dance performances) lasted nearly twenty minutes and a four minute 
excerpt is presented here. 
2. Barn Raising; Lester and Lizzie Carter, narration; black; 13 
September 1978; Patrick County, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R50. 
Black farmers along the ridge were often integrated into the 
white rural culture of the area and Lester Carter's description of barn 
building, with blacks and whites working together, bears this out. Such 
communal work gatherings also often included threshing and other forms 
of crop gathering as well as building. 
3."The Two Foxes," Jack in the Bush, and Town Ball; Matt Burnett, 
narrative; white; l6 September 1978; Meadows of Ban, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R56. 
Matt Burnett is a 74-year-old retired auctioneer, a skilled 
toy-maker, and a locally respected story-teller. He is a fund of local 
supernatural legends and historical anecdotes. His narrative presented 
here reflects two distinct types of traditional social entertainment: 
"recitations" and game-playing. Matt recites an old poem he memorized 
as a child as a school exercise. In the early decades of the century it 
-2k- 
vas quite common to include such recitations along with music-making 
as a normal type of entertainment. Many such entertainments were held 
in local school houses and poems like "The Two Foxes" were learned by 
children as part of their formal education. There is a distinct corpus 
of such recitation poems still remembered by many older residents of the 
South and Midwest; many had their origin in printed forms in nine¬ 
teenth century England and America, but some have been in oral tradition 
for so long that it is difficult to track them down to their original 
texts. (For a collection of such texts, with commentary, see Michael 
R. Turner, Parlour Poetry: A Casket of Gems, 1969.) 
4. Long Tongue Women; instrumental performance by The Korn Kutters, 
which includes Ivan Weddle (fiddle). Freeman Slusher (guitar), George 
Slusher (harmonica), and Willard Glower (banjo); white; 28 September 
1978; at home of D.J. and Janet Keith, Willis, Floyd County, Virginia; 
Tom Adler, fieldworker, and Tom Adler and Carl Fleischhauer, recordists; 
BR8-TA-R45. 
It is still reasonably common for neighbors on the Blue Ridge 
to get together to make informal string band music at home. The Korn 
Kutters, a group accustomed to playing together informally with occa¬ 
sional performances at dances, exhibit a fairly typical Galax string 
band sound. The fiddle and harmonica as twin lead instruments have 
been documented in the area since the 1920's in recordings by Ernest 
Stoneman (Galax), The Red Fox Chasers (Surry Comity, Worth Carolina) 
and the Floyd County Ramblers (from the same immediate area as the Korn 
Kutters). The conversation before and after the selection suggests the 
informal social context in which the music is produced. The tune "Long 
Tongue Women," while traditional, is not normally played as a string 
band instrumental.. At the end of this excerpt one of the band members re¬ 
fers to "an old record" of this piece. He was probably referring to a 
1926 recording by Georgia singer and guitarist Riley Puckett (Columbia 
190495, who performs the tune at a more sedate tempo. The first stanza 
of Puckett's version goes: 
I am lonesome and depressed. 
Got a woman who talks so fast, 
How she gets every word of the news. 
She can talk a wind to death. 
Just before he gets his breath. 
And the way she works the jobbers beats the Jews. 
5. Barber Shop Stories; actuality. Town and Country Barber Shop; 
white; 24 August 1978; Sparta, Worth Carolina; Terry Eiler, fieldworker, 
and Wes Leishman and Harley Jolley, recordists; BR8-TE-R3. 
Local small town barber shops provide one of the most vital 
settings for informal story-telling among older men. The Town and Country 
-25- 
Barber Shop is owned by Basil Lanerith and Rodney Busick. Customers 
present during the taping included A. Vance Choate, Ernest Cleary, John 
Reeves, P.C. Collins, Jr. (local politician), Tom Bledsoe, Tab Williams, 
and Russell Gentry. This excerpt illustrates how fictional jokes and 
real-life local character anecdotes are integrated into the general 
fabric of discussion. Talk starts about elders in the local Presby¬ 
terian church, and this sets up the first fictional joke about St. Peter 
and the two dollars. The theme of this joke is then applied to more 
local real life situations, until one of the barbers offers a second 
fictional joke, about the lack of lawyers in Heaven. This idea is then 
at once applied to a local sermon preached the Sunday before about lawyers; 
one customer, a retired lawyer, is reassured that nothing was said about 
him. The old lawyer then tells a story about a man who wanted to appeal 
his case. After an interval, this calls forth an apparently unrelated 
story about the peg-leg moonshiner, a local character; this in turn calls 
forth two other stories about local moonshiners. 
6. Hen Party Stories; actuality. Stone Mountain Craft Shop; white; 
18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R63. 
A local "hen party" (the term used by the panticipants) of 
women in the Traphill community provides a feminine counterpart to the 
male story-telling session just heard. The women participating here 
include Ruth Holbrook and four of her friends. In contrast to the 
stories told by the men in the Sparta barber shop, these stories are all 
personal experience anecdotes, and all have a slightly off-color in¬ 
formality; this particular sequence of stories was told at the end of a 
ninety-minute party in which a variety of longer personal experience anec¬ 
dotes had been told. One speaker tells a story about a corncob, another 
woman then tells a story about converting buttwipers to backscratchers. 
Ruth Holbrook, at the fieldworker’s urging, tells about how to flush an 
outdoor toilet; this leads to an account of the Sunday School teacher. 
Ruth then tells about the "bandaid" bikini, which is responded to by a 
story about topless horseback riders, followed by one about a see-through 
blouse, and Ruth concludes with a story about the boy in cut-offs.

1. Telling Jokes to Uncle Emory; woman storyteller, narrative; 
white; 15 September 1978; North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-H59- 
Even informal storytellers are often self-concious of their 
abilities, as this narrative demonstrates. The two jokes are embroi-- 
dered in the framework of a story about a visit to a sick uncle. A 
psychologist might s culate that such "framing" redeems the fact that 
both are slightly off-color, and the fact that it cheers up a sick man 
provides a utilitarian justification for such frivolous pursuits as 
joke-telling. 
2. Bluegrass Sally Ann and Bill Cheatham; instrumental performances 
by jam session band, including Lonnie Cole (fiddle), Ronnie Lyon (man¬ 
dolin), Wendell Cockerham (banjo), Bobby Harrison (guitar), and Michael 
Smith (string bass); white; 27 September 1978; Hillsville, Virginia; 
Tom Adler, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-TA-R42. 
Shockley's Shell Service Station in downtown Hillsville is a 
local gathering place for bluegrass jam sessions, usually on Tuesday 
nights. The action usually starts around 8:00 p.m. and soon the inside 
of the station is jammed with pickers and onlookers; "A lot of nights 
there are so many cars in here that we can't even get to the pumps to 
wait on customers," remarked Tom Ferris, one of the attendants. This 
excerpt offers a glimpse of how the tunes in such a jam session are 
chosen; it begins by Schockley reminding the musicians that he's in no 
hurry to closed down for the night. The impromptu nature of the music 
is underscored by the voices advising what key a number is in and by 
some confusion over the banjo-fiddle exchange of leads in "Bluegrass 
Sally Ann." The musicians all come from the Hillsville-Galax area, and 
two of the, Wendell Cockerham and Ronnie Lyon, have recently recorded 
(with, respectively. The Mountain Ramblers and Joe Ed King). 
3. Fox Hunters' Field Trial; actuality, featuring voice of Peter 
Cole; white; 1 September 1978; near Elk Hill, Carroll County, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe and Carl Fleischhauer, fieldworkers, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-CW-R3. 
Over the Labor Day weekend, the Twin County Fox Hunters Club, 
from Grayson and Carroll counties, held an all-night field trial for their 
fox hounds. The event attracted over 180 entries and reflected the popu¬ 
larity of fox hunting as a "gentleman's sport" in the region; fox hunters 
point with pride to the fact that George Washington started the sport in 
this country. This field trial consisted of a bench show, where the dogs 
were judged on the basis of conformation, and an all night run, wherein 
the dogs were cast at a certain point and scored by judges roaming the 
area throughout the night. (Each dog was identified by a number painted 
on his side.) The next morning the scores were totalled and prizes were 
awarded. Heard here are three different segments from the field trial 
recordings: in the first segment, Pete Cole, the master of the hounds. 
-28- 
instructs his judges prior to the cast; in the second. Cole supervises 
the loading of the hounds into trucks to he carried to the point where 
they will he released; in the third, we hear the sounds of the cast and 
the hounds running through the woods at night. 
4. Rafe Brady's Fox Hunt; Rafe Brady, fiddle and vocal, with Dean 
Brady (guitar), Jim Marshall (5-string hanjo), Artie Marshall (guitar), 
and Ronnie Lyon, (mandolin); white; 28 September 1978; Hillsville, 
Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R92. 
For generations traditional southern fiddlers have attempted 
to recreate the sounds of a fox chase on their instruments and 65-year- 
old Rafe Brady, from Laurel Fork, Virginia, is no exception. Brady's 
commentary localizes the piece, with specific local place names, and 
his tune is somewhat different from the normal time used hy fiddlers 
for the fox hunt imitation. Brady recorded an earlier version of this 
piece for the Library of Congress in 1937 (1347 B2, mislabelled as by 
"Drake" Brady), a version almost identical to this one done 4l years 
later. 
5. Little Massey Grove; sung by Eunice MeAlexander; white; 21 Sep¬ 
tember 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Wally Macnow, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-WM-R2. 
The unaccompanied singing of old ballads, one of the most 
classic forms of folkmusic, is almost extinct today in the Blue Ridge, 
though it was flourishing there as recently as fifty years ago. The 
few remaining singers are highly self-concious preservers of the art, 
like Eunice McAlexander, who has been recording her songs and ballads 
for folklorists since the 1930's. Here she sings an old British ballad 
about marital infidelity that was quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher's 
l6ll drama. The Knight of the Burning Pestle. (Child, James F., 
The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v. II, p. 242 ff, 8l. "Little 
Musgrave and Lady Barnard.";

1. Testimony and Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down; congregation 
of Clark's Creek Progressive Primitive Baptist Church; black; 10 
September 1978; near Ararat, Patrick County, Virginia; Blanton Owen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-B0-R29- 
This is an excerpt from a rural black service that features 
testimony by a congregation member, followed by a spiritual. "Satan 
Your Kingdom Must Come Down" was not sung from a hymnbook and the 
pianist gives up trying to follow the song after a few bars. 
2. What A Time We're Living In; Reverend Robert Akers, vocal, with 
W.C. (Calvin) Hawkins, second voice, and Junior Hawkins (piano), Alex 
Shupe (guitar), Donnie Felts (electric bass), and Kim Shupe (drums): 
white; 20 August 1978; Galax, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-B0-R11. 
Tent revivals are popular in the Blue Ridge and one of the 
more successful ones is run by Reverend Robert Akers of Hillsville. 
Akers' revivals contain about as much music as preaching—music which 
owes stylistic debts to modern black gospel and country music as well 
as traditional rural hymnody. This is one of a number of original 
gospel songs composed by Akers and it uses a number of traditional 
call-and-response patterns and imagery. 
3. Preaching by Inspiration; Quincy Higgins, narration and singing; 
white; 9 September 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and 
Pat Mullen, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R31. 
This is a sort of cante fable—a mixture of song and story— 
designed to support one of the strongest tenants of southern rural 
Protestantism: the value of "inspiration" over "book learning." Higgins' 
story also has subtle class overtones, as well as implications for the 
whole ethos of traditional versus modern. Mr. Higgins, born in 1900, 
has been a farmer most of his life and is a member of the Big Springs 
Regular Baptist Church. 
H. Hymn #6l; sung by congregation of Crossroads Primitive Baptist 
Church; white; 20 August 1978; Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia; Carl 
Fleischhauer, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
This example of unaccompanied congregational singing (from 
Daly's Primitive Baptist Hymn Book) is one of the oldest and "purest" 
types of religious music still extant in the Blue Ridge. The Primitive 
Baptist Church, which discourages the use of instruments or "specialty" 
singing in church, is very strong in the area and accounts for the 
strength of this tradition. 
-31- 
5. Conversion Story; Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; 17 August 
1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl 
Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
One of the most prevalent forms of story-telling extant 
in the Blue Ridge today is the "conversion story:" personal experi¬ 
ence narratives about how the story-teller found religion and joined 
the church. Similar stories were collected from both whites and 
blacks. 
6. Amazing Grace;sung by the congregation of the Macedonia Baptist 
Church, lined out by Deacon Walter Brown; black; 10 September 1978; 
near Sparta, Worth Carolina; Charles Wolfe and Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R25. 
"Lining out" hymns dates from the time when only the preacher 
(or song-leader) had a hymn book, and consists of the song-leader 
chanting a line of the hymn to the congregation, followed by the con¬ 
gregation singing the line. This practice is found in both white and 
black churches, though it is preserved today out of a self-concious 
sense of tradition rather than as a functional necessity.

1. I'm Going Dovn to the River of Jordan; sung by congregation of 
Macedonia Baptist Church; black; 10 September 1978; near Sparta, North 
Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and Charles Wolfe, fieldvorkers, and 
Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R25. 
2. Prayer; spoken by Reverend J.R. Young; other data as for #1. 
3. Somewhere Listening for My Name; same as #1, except BR8-CW-R26. 
These three consecutive performances from a service at the 
rural Macedonia Baptist Church suggest some of the interplay and flow 
of a black service. The piano player continues to play behind Reverend 
Young's excellent prayer, giving it an added emotional and aesthetic 
dimension. "Somewhere Listening for My Name" was completely ad lib: 
the preacher had stepped up to the lectern to begin the sermon when 
song-leader Leonard Bryan began, without benefit of book or warning 
the choir. 
4. Conversion Experience; Florence Cheek, narration; white; 19 
August 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R15. 
This is a remarkable conversion experience told by a 74- 
year-old housewife; the glowing tobacco barn is a unique local mani¬ 
festation of a classic mystical experience. Related items will be 
found on Reel 9, #5, Reel 10, #9, and Reel 12, #3. 
5. How Happy Are They; sung by the congregation of the Laurel Glenn 
Regular Baptist Church; white; 17 September 1978; Laurel Glenn, Virginia; 
Blanton Owen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-BO-R34. 
6. Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone; as for #5. 
7. When Our Lord Shall Come Again; as for #5- 
8. When the Redeemed Are Gathering In; as for #5- 
These four hymns (taken from Stamps-Baxter's Favorite Songs 
and Hymns) were all done at one morning's service at the Laurel Glenn 
church, and represent the variety of song styles (and singing styles) 
routinely heard in one church. The styles range from the older "unison" 
style with harmony or "part" work ("How Happy Are They"), to the more 
modern gospel-quartet style of the call-and-response pattern ("When the 
Redeemed Are Gathering Irf), and an example of lining a hymn ("Must Jesus 
Bear the Cross Alone").

1. Palms of Victory; sung unaccompanied by the Marshall Largen 
Family; white; 11 September 1978; near Laurel Fork, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R29. 
2. Wayfaring Stranger; as for #1. 
3. Holding to His Hand of Love; sung unaccompanied by the Schuyler 
Family; white; 4 September 1978; Lowgap, Worth Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R13. 
This reel consists of various performances by different white 
gospel music groups in the study area; they cover a spectrum from the 
most traditional unaccompanied family singing styles to bluegrass gospel 
to more modern country-tinged gospel. This spectrum, along with more 
modern and more fully amplified forms of gospel music is widespread in 
the area today; indeed, gospel music is more prevalent than the fiddle 
and banjo music customarily associated with the Blue Ridge. 
"Palms of Victory" is sung by Marshall Largen, a part-time 
independent preacher, his two daughters, Barbara and Brenda, and an 
old friend. Bill Scott. Mr. Largen has a regular weekly radio program 
in Hillsville, Virginia (WHHV), and has lived in the Laurel Fork area 
all of his life. "Palms of Victory" (also known as "Deliverance Will 
Come") has been rather widely known and recorded, but the Largens, as 
well as other local gospel singers, insist the song originated in the 
southwestern Virginia area and was a local favorite. Both this song 
and "Wayfaring Stranger" were sung from old shape-note paperbacked song 
books. 
The Schuyler Family, consisting of E. Caldwell Schuyler, his 
wife. Avis, and son, Trent, has been singing together for twelve years, 
usually without accompaniment. Today they routinely make two to three 
appearances a week at area churches, accepting only "gas money" for 
their work. This song, taken from a 1937 Stamps-Baxter shape note song 
book, demonstrates the "afterbeat," an "echo" effect so characteristic of 
modern gospel quartet music, introduced in the late 1920's by Tennessee 
music publisher James D. Vaughn. 
4. Keep on the Firing Line; played on the piano by Mrs. Ella Draughan; 
white; 4 September 1978; near Lowgap, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R14. 
5. I'm Going to See Heaven; as for #4. 
6. Where We'll Never Grow Old; sung by the Schuyler Family with A.P. 
Thompson, with piano by Mrs. Ella Draughan; white; 4 September 1978; 
near Lowgap, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; 
BR8-CW-R16. 
-37- 
Mrs. Ella Draughan, j6, has recently been playing piano with 
the Schuyler Family in their church appearances. She toured with seve¬ 
ral regionally famous gospel quartets, playing on the radio and at rural 
schoolhouses in the 1930's and 19^0's. As part of a typical concert in 
those days, she would play one or two "piano specials", such as the ones 
she plays: driving, almost ragtime performances of exuberant gospel 
hymns. 
"Where We'll Never Grow Old" is sung in the "classic" quartet 
style that originated in the 1920's and has come to dominate mainstream 
white gospel music. This particular song was one of the first gospel 
songs to become widely popular on records, when it was recorded by 
Smith's Sacred Singers, a Georgia group, in 1925. The Schuyler Family 
here is joined by an old singing companion, A.P. Thompson; now 79 years 
old, Mr. Thompson was an original member of The Red Fox Chasers, a famous 
old-time string band from Surry County which recorded prolifically in the 
late 1920's. Though he no longer sings regularly with a quartet, Mr. 
Thompson still has a fine, clear voice. 
7. The Other Side of Jordan; sung and played by The Elk Horn Four, 
consisting of Warren Lowe (lead singer and rhythm guitar), his wife, 
Ethel Lowe (harmony vocal and electric bass), Edward Spears (lead accous- 
tic guitar), and JoAnne Monk (piano); white; 19 September 1978; near 
Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R59" 
Here is a modern gospel song performed by a local group that 
performs in the Grayson and Carroll county area. The sound of the group 
(especially the harmony), as well as the type of songs they perform, 
shows the influence of country music on the gospel tradition. 
8. Tell Me His Name Again; Larry Richardson, vocal and guitar; white; 
12 September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-CW-R34. 
"Tell Me His Name Again" is an original composition by Larry 
Richardson, a friend of the Lowe family documented in the preceding 
selection. Richardson was, until about ten years ago, a nationally 
known bluegrass performer and frequent winner of the banjo and guitar 
contests at the Galax fiddlers' convention. His 1955 recording of "Let 
Me Fall" was one of the most influential bluegrass records of the time. 
After undergoing a personal crisis, Richardson joined the church and for 
a time stopped playing completely. When he resumed performing a few years 
ago, he decided to play only gospel music, albeit in a solid bluegrass 
style. He now travels the country as an evangelist, singing, picking, and 
preaching in churches from Ohio to Florida. 
-38- 
9. Twilight is Falling; Jim Marshall, vocal and 5-string banjo, 
with Artie Marshall, harmony vocal and guitar; white; ll September 1978; 
near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles Wolfe and Howard Marshall, fieldworkers, 
and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R37• 
Jim Marshall explains that this is an old song once associated 
with Robert Sheffey, a famous circuit-riding preacher from nearby Wythe 
County Virginia who travelled the area in the nineteenth century. After 
Jim heard about Sheffey and his song, he began to hunt for the song and 
finally found a copy in a song book published by Albert Brumley in 
Missouri. He and his wife perform the old hymn in classic bluegrass style 
and it is a favorite with friends and fans of the Marshalls in south¬ 
western Virginia.

1. Uncle Ennis and the Snake; Ben Junior Harris, narration; white; 
29 August 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R26. 
Jokes about preachers were reasonably common in the area, and 
this character anecdote, with its blunt punch line, is typical of such 
stories. 
2. Baptizing at Carson’s Creek; actuality, featuring the voices of 
Reverend J.L. Byrd and Reverend Cecil, with E.C. Schuyler, song-leader; 
white; ;7 September 1978; near Lowgap, Horth Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R58. 
River baptism is still common in rural North Carolina, and 
the location in Carson’s Creek has for generations served the needs of 
many of the churches in Surry County. In this excerpt members of the 
Mountain View Baptist Church participate in the baptizing of several 
new members. After each immersion, the congregation standing on the 
banks sings a few bars of "Oh Happy Day." At the end of the immersions, 
both preachers, still standing in the water, deliver impromptu sermons 
to the congregation on the bank. 
3. Conversion Experience; Leonard Bryan and Mrs. Mamie Bryan, narra¬ 
tion; white; 6 September 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R37-

4. I’m Going Away; sung with piano accompaniment by the assembled 
members of the New Covenant Association, meeting at Redmond Creek Baptist 
Church; white; 17 September 1978; near Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia; 
Pat Mullen and Charles Wolfe, fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; 
BR8-CW-R69. 
The New Covenant Association is an organization of black Baptist 
churches in the southwestern Virginia-northwestern North Carolina area, 
and the members all get together once a year for a day-long session of 
preaching, singing, and "dinner on the ground." This performance, on 
which perhaps as many as 150 voices are heard, preceded the preaching in 
the Sunday morning service. 
5. A Home in Heaven; sung by Mr. and Mrs. Jess Higgins; white; 23 
September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson and Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-CW-R69. 
_4i- 
For twelve years. Elder Jess Higgins (of the Galax Primitive 
Baptist Church) has had his own radio program over local station WBOB. 
On that thirty-minute program. Elder Higgins and his wife sing un¬ 
accompanied songs and deliver a quarter-hour message. Higgins tapes 
each show in his home late Saturday night before the Sunday it is to 
he broadcast. This selection was recorded as Higgins taped his show 
for Sunday, 2k September 1978. The song is from The Primitive Baptist 
Hymn Book. 
6. Statement About Gospel Music; Jess Higgins, narration; as for #5, 
except from tape BR8-CW-R70. 
7. They Crucified the Savior; Rafe Brady, fiddle and vocal, with Dean 
Brady (guitar), Jim Marshall (banjo), Artie Marshall (guitar), and Ronnie 
Lyon (mandolin): white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R93. 
Gospel music is so pervasive in the Blue Ridge that even a 
hard-living traditional old-time fiddler like Rafe Brady has a sacred 
song or two in his repertory.

APPENDIX 2 
SEEDS PLANTED WHEN THE EARTH IS— 
In Aries, which is a Movable Fire Sign, 
governed by the Sun, make rapid growth 
and abundance of straw and tops, ac¬ 
cording as the Moon is old or new. 
In Taurus, which is a Fixed Earthly 
Sign, governed by Mercury, will do good 
for ail root crops of quick growth. 
In Gemini, which is a Barren Sign, 
will not make a good growth. This is a 
good time to stir the soil and subdue all 
noxious weeds. 
In Cancer, which is a Watery, Fruit¬ 
ful Movable Sign, germinate quickly. It 
is favorable to growth and insures an 
abundant yield. 
In Leo, which is a Barren, Fiery Sign, 
will die, as it is only favorable to the de¬ 
struction of noxious growth. Trim no 
trees or vines when the Moon or Earth 
is in Leo, for they will surely die. 
In Virgo, which is also a Barren sign, 
as it is unfavorable to growth of seed or 
transplanting. 
In Libra, which is a strong Movable 
Sign, does well, it is next after Cancer 
for good effect. Seed planted at this time 
produces vigorous pulp growth and roots 
and a reasonable amount of grain. 
In Scorpio, which is Fruitful, produc¬ 
ing Watery effects. Next best after 
Cancer. 
In Sagittarius, which is a Fiery, Mac- 
culine Sign, will not do well, as it is not 
a very favorable time to plant or trans¬ 
plant. 
In Capricorn, which is a Moist, Mov¬ 
able Sign, will produce a rapid growth of 
pulp, stalks or roots, but not much grain. 
In Aquarius, which is an Airy, Mascu¬ 
line Sign, is only thrown away, as it will 
not grow well. 
In Pisces, which is Fruitful, Watery 
Feminine Sign, will produce excellent re¬ 
sults and is third best sign for producing 
the fruits of the earth. 
The Air Signs are the best to harvest 
in. The Fire Signs are second best. Never 
gather fruit, grain or vegetables in the 
Watery Signs or new of the moon, as 
they will surely decay or sprout. Just 
before full Moon is the best to gather for 
shipping. 
AH plants, trees and vegetables plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon will grow 
vigorously. All crops that produce their 
yield above the ground should be plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon. Those that 
produce their yield in the ground should 
be planted in the old of the moon. 
Aries, Taurus, Libra and Capricorn 
are good Fruitful Signs. Cancer, Scorpio 
and Pisces are the best and most pro¬ 
ductive in the order named, being wa¬ 
tery they assist vegetation to withstand 
drought and produce much fruit and 
grain. Sagittarius and Aquarius are poor 
Signs. Leo, Gemini and Virgo are Bar¬ 
ren, the strongest in the order named, 
and are best to destroy weeds and all 
noxious growth. The first day the Moon 
is in a Sign is better than the second and 
the second is better than the third. 
@ New Moon, Increasing 
During this Moon plant the following: 
Asparagus, Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, 
Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celery, Corn, Cu¬ 
cumbers, Endive, Kohlrabi, Leeks, Let¬ 
tuce, Spinach, Barley, Oats, Rye, Wheat. 
3) 1st Quarter, Moon Increasing 
During this Quarter plant the follow¬ 
ing: Beans, Egg Plant, Melons, Peas, 
Peppers, Pumpkins, Squash, Tomatoes, 
flowers and cereals.

ing: Beets, Carrots, Chickory, Potatoes, 
Radishes, Rutabagas, Onions, Turnips, 
Tubers. 
(£ Last Quarter, Moon Decreasing

PREFACE 
These notes accompany a selection of sound recordings 
prepared for presentation to the National Park Service from the 
Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project (1978) 
The set consists of twelve reels of audio tape, each reel 
consisting of several performances or actualities. Many of the 
recordings are in stereo- The twelve tapes are arranged into four 
major groups: 
Reels 1-3 document the "Sense of Time" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels h-6 document the "Sense of Place" as reflected in various 
forms of traditional culture; 
Reels 7-8 offer a sampling of "Traditional Social Life" in 
rural Blue Ridge communities visited by the project; and 
Reels 9-12 explore the varieties of religious expression in 
the traditional communities on the Blue Ridge. 
These selections were made by Charles Wolfe, the Field 
Coordinator for the Project. In the end, the choices are somewhat 
arbitrary and subjective, but they were made with an overview of 
the project provided by personal experience, as well as the reports, 
tape logs, and suggestions of other fieldworkers. These fieldworkers 
included Pat Mullen, Ohio State University; Geraldine Johnson, 
Strayer College; Blanton Owen, Ferrum College; Margaret Owen, Ferrum 
College; Tom Adler, Indiana University; and Howard Marshall and Carl 
Fleischhauer of the American Folklife Center. 
The headings for each selection provide the following 
information: 
Selection title; name of artist; instrumentation; black or 
white cultural group; recording date; location of recording; name 
of fieldworker; name of recordist; project tape number. 
The original recordings are at the Library of Congress, 
and copies have been presented to the Blue Ridge Parkway. 
Selected Sound Recordings

Reel 1 
"Sense of Time - I" 
-3' 
1. Stories about Daniel Boone; Mr. and Mrs. Quincy Higgins, 
narration; white; 9 September 1978; Higgins home, Sparta, North 
Carolina; Pat Mullen and Geraldine Johnson, fieldworkers and 
recordists; BR8-PM-RU2. 
Daniel Boone has been the subject of all sorts of legends, 
some stimulated by popular culture, others genuine forms of tradi¬ 
tional folklore. Quincy Higgins' tales about Boone are noteworthy 
in two respects: they are closely tied to area land features, and 
they are related in some way to modern life. It is almost as if 
Higgins is seeking to verify the reality of his historical accounts 
of Boone by using the present(e.g., placenames with Boone's name) 
as proof. The story of Boone shooting Indians as they jumped off 
a cliff in Revenge for the death of his son does not appear in any 
standard biographies of Boone. 
2. The Hoop Snake; Fred Lowe, narration; white; 7 September 
1978; Fisher Gap, near Lowgap, North Carolina (Surry County); 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-C3. 
Another genre of "classic" folklore that reflects and 
preserves the past is the tall tale. Fred Lowe's tale of the grand¬ 
father's encounter with a rolling snake is of special interest because 
it can be traced in Surry County as far back as 1859- In that year 
virtually the same story appears in a book called Fisher's River 
(North Carolina) Scenes and Characters by Harden E. Taliaferro, a 
Baptist minister who revisited his native county in 1857 to gather 
material for the book. In that book the tale is attributed to Uncle 
Davy Lane, who asserted that it described a personal experience. Lowe 
continues this tradition of "personalizing" the narrative by asserting 
that the story happened to his grandfather, and by sprinkling it with 
local place names and framing it with other stories about his grand¬ 
father's Civil War experiences. This story has also been widely 
collected in Kentucky. 
3. The Ballad of Caty Sage; sung by J.C. Pierce; white; 22 Septem¬ 
ber 1978; Pierce home, near Coal Creek, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R69. 
A favorite way of celebrating and preserving dramatic or 
touching events of local history has always been the localized event 
ballad. One of the oldest such events commemorated in the Blue Ridge 
area is the abdudtion of five-year-old Caty Sage by Indians from her 
home in rural Grayson County in 1792. Fifty-six years later a brother 
found her ih eastern Kansas, living with the Wyandot Indians; he tried 
to pursuade her to return to her family in Virginia, but before she 
could she died of pneumonia. About 19^0, J.C. Pierce, a local singer 
and guitarist, read a<poem about Caty Sage by Eva Boyer, in the Galax 
newspaper. Impressed, he set the poem to music, and sung it at the 
Galax fiddlers' contest that year. It intrigued some folklorists who 
vere present and Pierce vas soon invited to record the song for the 
Library of Congress. Pierce, who later became a Galax policeman, 
has continued to perform the song since then, copyrighted it and 
recorded it commercially, and has written a short history of the 
Sage story. 
1*. Witch Stories; Will Barnard, narration; white; 12 August 1978; 
Kibler Valley, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-PM-R3. 
Yet another genre of "classic" folklore is the supernatural 
legend and a surprising number of these are found in the Blue Ridge 
area even today. Most of Will Barnard's witch stories relate in 
some way to his immediate family, and thus are tied up with his own 
personal sense of the past. The witch described here is buried in 
the Barnard family graveyard. In this region, the word witch is 
used to refer either to a man or a woman. 
5. The Murder of the Lawson Family; sung by Artie Marshall, 
accompanied by herself on guitar and by Jim Marshall on 5-string 
banjo; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R97• 
In late 1929 a Surry County man named Charlie Lawson went 
berserk and murdered his entire family, and by March 1930 a song 
about the tragedy had been recorded by a singing team called the 
Carolina Buddies. It soon became widely popular in the area and 
remains so today. The song is an early instance of a local event 
song going into tradition via the medium of the phonograph record. 
The song follows the form of many event ballads of the 1920's, giv¬ 
ing specific details about the tragedy and concluding with some 
gesture toward moral judgement. Artie Marshall has known the song 
since childhood. 
6. Legends of Charlie Lawson; Herbert Fulk, narration; white; 
17 August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Folk memory of Charlie Lawson, in coming to grips with the 
horror of a rural society having in its midst a mass murderer, has 
attached a variety of supernatural elements to Lawson. Herbert 
Fulk, who insist^ that as a boy he slept with Lawson shortly before 
the murder, gives some examples of these legends in his accounts of 
the haunted "graphophone" and the bewitched car—both once possessions 
of Lawson. It is noteworthy how these traditional supernatural ele¬ 
ments have been attached to two symbols of modern society: the record 
player and the automobile.

1. The Vengeful Ghost; Herbert Fulk, narration; white; IT 
August 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Blanton Owen and Pat Mullen, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-PM-R8. 
Herbert Fulk tells this classic ghost story as a personal 
experience narrative with a good sense of pacing and detail. Espe¬ 
cially noteworthy is casual way in which the narrator relates to the 
ghost and in the colorful, idiomatic language used by both ghost and 
narrator. The story was told in a context that included other per¬ 
sonal experience supernatural tales, including the stories about 
Charlie Lawson (Reel 1, selection #6). 
2. School Children’s Rhymes and Parodies; sung by children from 
Mrs. Holland’s fourth grade class. Blue Ridge Elementary School; 
black and white; 12 September 1978; Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-RU8. 
Children's folklore often displays a delightful irreverance 
for the past, as shown by the two parodies here of a venerable Blue 
Ridge traditional song, "On Top of Old Smoky." Both of these parodies 
are well known, and have been collected from children across the coun¬ 
try; texts similar to those here appear, for instance, in Mary and 
Herbert Knapp's One Potato, Two Potato: The Folklore of American 
Children (Norton, 1976). Such folklore of children at once ridicules 
the past and yet at the same time preserves it. 
3. Forecasting Rain; Cosby Golding, narrative; white; 8 August 1978; 
Surry County, near Lowgap, North Carolina; Blanton Owen, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-B0-R1. 
i 
4. Quilts and Fortune; actuality. Baptist Church Quilting Group; 
white; l4 September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R56. 
Not every response to time in traditional life is tied to 
the past; there are a vast number of methods of forecasting the future. 
Here are two different contexts for such forecasting: Cosby Golding 
relates his predictions of rain to natural signs; the ladies in the 
quilting group use various domestic images, such as quilts, mirrors 
and apple seeds.’ All the informants here are a little unsure of the 
efficacy of the signs, and all nervously qualify their faith in the 
sign?—yet they have thought enough of them to have preserved them 
throughout the years. All the predictions are highly personal in 
nature; none pretend to foretell, for instance, national trends or 
the fates of famous people, as do predictions in mass media.

5. The Reaper in the Elements; Marvin Lyon, narration; white; 
5 September 1978; Roaring Gap, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-PM-R33. 
Many Local anecdotes collected in the project were built 
around the theme of changing times. Though technology came to the 
Blue Ridge reasonably early (a paved highway up the ridge to Meadows 
of 3Jan was completed as early as 1928), people here, as elsewhere, 
love to tell stories of an old man seeing his first car, his first 
train, his first airplane, etc. Such accounts serve to dramatize 
the cultural and economic changes wrought by technology, and empha¬ 
size the difference between life "now" and "in the old days." 
6. Courtship Story; Dean and Estelle Gambill, joint narration; 
black; 30 August 1978; near Sparta, North Carolina; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R30. 
Courtship stories and religious conversion stories formed 
the most common types of personal experience narrative collected in 
the project. This particular story is structurally interesting in 
the way Estelle offers an account from her point of view, bringing 
the tale through to marriage, and then her husband backs up and fills 
in gaps by telling the story from his point of view. Both narratives 
are full of detail and well formed, suggesting that both husband and 
wife are used to telling the story to children, grandchildren, and 
friends. The Gambills are both in their seventies, and Dean, a re¬ 
tired farmer, mail carrier, and store clerk, spent the years 1916- 
1927 in West Virginia, mining coal—as did many blacks along the 
ridge. 
7. Slavery and Modern Times; Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; 
17 August 1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and 
Carl Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-PM-R12. 
Jesse Lee Hatcher was one of our best informants from the 
perspective of integrating past and present; Mr. Hatcher had an 
exceptionally sharp memory of turn-of-the-century life on the ridge, 
a graceful and articulate way of expressing it, and ability to con¬ 
trast it with modern life. Born in 1890 of parents who had been 
slaves, Jesse Hatcher spent most of his life as a farmer. He stays 
at his old home place near Ararat in the summers and in Richmond in 
the winter. His life-long struggle with discrimination and the after¬ 
effects of slavery are evident in these comments about the continuing 
effects of slavery in modern times.

1. Memories of the Depression;Mrs. Mae Willey, narration; white; 
22 August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R9. 
2. Hard Times; Ruth Holbrook, narration; white; 23 August 1978; 
and 18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson 
and Harley Jolley, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R13> 84. 
These two personal experience narratives describe the ways 
in which two women from the Blue Ridge deal with painful memories of 
the Depression. Mae Willey, the older of the two women, began her 
marriage during that time and tends to perceive the period as a 
time of testing that made her and her husband better, more self- 
sufficient people. Ruth Holbrook, born in 1924, was only five when the 
stock market crashed and lost all of her brothers and sisters during 
the Depression. She does not see the experience in any sort of posi¬ 
tive light and did not seem overly anxiotis to talk about it to the 
fieldworkers. (The Holbrook selection is composed of two segments 
from separate interviews conducted nearly a month apart.) Ruth Hol¬ 
brook went on to become a quilter, instructor in a community college, 
a member of a touring clogging team, and is currently sales manager 
for the Stone Mountain Craft Shop. 
3. "Women's Liberation Came Too Late For Me;" Ruth Newman, narration; 
white; 8 September 1978; Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker 
and recordist; BR8-GJ-R28. 
Ruth Geraldine Newman, a forty-nine-year old native of Galax, 
is a skillful cook and craftworker, as well as a published poet. She 
lives alone with her father in a rural area outside town. Her long 
account of her struggles to realize her own ambitions in the face of 
discouragement by parents and teachers Remind us that tradition, for 
all of its stabilizing value, can also present great difficulties.

What makes the culture of the rural Blue Ridge unique, and 
how is this uniqueness reflected in the folklife of the area? A 
natural starting point is the placenames of the area, and what these 
names mean to people in the area. Many of the people in the area 
know stories behind the placenames near them, though some know differ¬ 
ent stories about the same placename. The two accounts of how Traphill 
got its name illustrate this; these two accounts also illustrate 
different reasons for their preservation. Marvin Lyon's story is rather 
straightforward and initiates a litany of other placenames; Ruth Hol¬ 
brook's tale, on the other hand, is tied to personal history: the story 
of "By Gravy" Tom, her grandfather, who carried mail through the land 
on foot. 
Fred Clifton's account of how Cloudbreak got its name is yet 
a third type: a tale reflecting a rather formal sense of community 
history, Clifton here is very much aware of the narrative quality of 
his account—unlike lyon, who doesn't set up much narrative or add much 
detail, or Holbrook, who invests the process with memories. 
While some placenames are derived from historical events, 
others are derived from natural features, as Ethel Brewer's account of 
naming Galax suggests. In fact, in this account we learn that names 
commemorating a historical event or person were rejected in favor of 
a "natural" name (even though the town was a "planned" community 
founded by the railroad). The Galax leaves, incidentally, provided a 
useful cash export crop for citizens of the area for years; these leaves 
are highly decorative and especially in demand around Christmas. 
Jim and Artie Marshall's song about Galax, and the discussion 
that follows, explores the way local people feel about the image Galax 
has acquired in more recent years. Today the place of Galax has become 
synonymous with a fiddling contest and festival "where old and young 
come to meet ," After he sings the song, Marshall and his wife discuss 
the impact the festival has had on the land itself, and the special prob¬ 
lems created by the massive "Stompin' '76" festival of a few years back.

"There was garbage everywhere," Artie Marshall says. They even 
camped in the cemetery," an act symbolizing brutalization of both 
the past and the land.

The next group of selections is designed to illustrate the 
variops ways the people in the area make their physical environment 
a part of their physical lives. Ties to the land and geography are 
not merely historical but material as well, and over the years the 
people of the Blue Ridge have used folk medicines and home remedies 
indigenous to the immediate environment. 
For years ginseng has been a cash crop in the mountains 
and even today mountaineers jealously guard the secret locations of 
their ginseng patches; "poachers" will often strip a ginseng crop 
completely, destroying the growth for several years. Fred Clifton's 
account of ginseng is also interesting in that it gives an insight 
into how the people in the area feel about ginseng's medicinal 
properties. 
Mr. and Mrs. Will Barnard offer a catalogue of home remedies 
made from local, flora that the people trust more than ginseng: catnip 
tea, ground ivy tea, boneset, "red bloom weed," and others. Though 
some of the people still use these home remedies, the Barnards indicate 
that the tradition is declining. 
88-year-old Jesse Lee Hatcher discusses the medicinal proper¬ 
ties of the Balm of Gilead tree which he has growing in his yard. As 
Hatcher says, the Balm of Gilead is mentioned in the Bible, in Jeremiah 
8:22 and again in Genesis 37:25; there the term referred to the resin 
from the Styrax tree, produced especially in the north Transjordan 
region of Gilead, which was widely used for medicinal purposes. But 
it is important to note that Hatcher's "authority for the belief is 
not only the Bible (Hatcher is a deacon in the local church) but the 
past: his parents used the remedy. Later Hatcher discusses his general 
attitude toward home remedies in the face of modern medicine.^ 
Will Barnard's description of a magic asthma (or "tizzy ) cure 
-13- 
moves us from a simple physical link between man and nature to a more 
metaphysical type of sympathetic magic. Barnard’s cure does not sim¬ 
ply involve the physical preparation of an ointment, tea, or halm, 
hut involves ritual as well—what Mrs. Barnard calls voodoo. In a 
broader sense, though, the underlying idea behind the cure is that 
man and nature function as one in a sort of mystic union of the en- 
vironment and the individual.

Slate farm, near Claudville, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and

The next eight selections form a sequence of statements 
about planting, harvesting, and preparation of food in the study 
area. Like home remedies, such lore is inextricably tied to the nature 
of the land itself and the attitude people have toward it. 
One part of such lore involves "planting by the signs:" 
keying the planting of crops to the position of the zodiac signs, so 
related to the parts of the body. Many calendars and almanacs cir¬ 
culated throughout the region give detailed, day-to-day information 
about the movement of these signs. One of the most common almanacs in 
the Blue Ridge area is Blum1s Almanac, which has been published in 
Winston-Salem since the l880's.* The use of this particular form of 
printed mass media to maintain a system of traditional lore has con¬ 
tinued for several generations. 
All three of these excerpts are characterized by an ambivalence 
toward planting signs. Mrs. Quincy Higgins' father never used the signs 
and yet she will "run and open the door and check" before she plants. 
Her husband asserts that, "it's been working through the ages," and that 
it is mentioned in the Bible. The Gambills, both in their seventies, 
disagree completely on the effectiveness of planting by the signs. 
Estelle uses the signs because her grandparents did, and because, "mama 
never planted nothing when the signs were not right;" her maintenance 
of this tradition is thus linked to her respect for her parents and grand¬ 
parents. Dean is far more pragmatic about planting and offers his own 
evidence to counter that of his wife. 
Tim Slate, a tobacco farmer in his twenties, is skeptical 
about using signs, but when asked outright if he does not believe in 
signs, he is quick to reply, "I didn't say that." Tim argues that his 
mother believes more strongly in signs than he does, and asserts that 
different books—different almanacs—contradict each other in giving 
day-to-day signs. But the fact that a young farmer in the area, even 
in this day of widespread community colleges, farm extension agents, 
and scientific farming, still has even this much interest in the signs, 
testifies to the strength of the tradition.

8. Pickles and Canning Order; Mae Willey, narration; white; 22 
August 1978; Baywood, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson, fieldworker and

Like planting and harvesting, food preservation also con¬ 
tinues along traditional lines. Mae Willey is a modern, up-to-date 
woman living in a comfortable ranch-style house, but she allows her 
daily work to be structured by the age-old natural cycle of gardening. 
Just as there are the right signs for planting, so there are right 
signs for canning and preserving the harvest. 
Ruth Newman's catalogue of local greens includes dandelion, 
dock, lamb's quarter, blackberry briar leaves, "dooryard wood" (plantain), 
and "mousears." This catalogue provides an interesting parallel to the 
catalogue of home remedies (Will Barnard, Reel 4, #7) also drawn from 
local flora. 
Drying is one of the more common traditional means of food 
preservation in the Blue Ridge. Though many families in the area have 
home freezers, some continue to dry beans, apples, peaches, and even 
sweet potatoes simply because they prefer the taste of dried food to 
that of frozen food. In addition to the drying rack on a wood stove 
described by Margaret Jarvis, other drying methods include the use of 
"dry houses" (sheds with wood furnaces underneath for quick, hot drying) 
and automobiles. Apple slices, or similar fruits or vegetables, are 
placed in the window of a closed car where the sun can shine on them 
for several days. 
Mae Willey takes a great amount of pride in her home-canned 
goods; she knows her stock so well that she does not have to label jars, 
and is able to rotate old and new jars almost by instinct. Her attitude 
toward cleaning and dusting her supply of canned food suggests that she 
takes an aesthetic pride in the physical display of the goods: they are 
symbolic of her well-being, as well as her skill as a home-maker, and 
even of a certain structure and order in her life.

Slate; white; 26 September 1978; Mt. Airy, North Carolina (New Farmers 
Market); Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R84. 
This sequence chronicles the progress of Tim Slate*s tobacco 
crop from harvesting to its sale at auction during the late summer of 
1978. Tobacco is an important cash crop both on top of the ridge 
(hurley, air—cured) and beneath the ridge (bright leaf, flue cured), 
and it has been for years. In the first selection here you can hear 
the Slate family "priming" tobacco—breaking off the leaves— and we are 
introduced to young Tim Slate. 7^-year-old Bernie Dollarhite then re¬ 
calls older methods of gathering the tobacco (spliting the stalks and 
hanging it by the stick), and Beech Slate weighs in with a story of how ^ 
he used to prime tobacco all day and boil fifty gallons of sugar liquor 
at night. 
In the second excerpt we hear Tim and Beech Slate swapping 
stories while stringing the tobacco—putting it on sticks to hang in 
the curing barn. Two stories are told: the first is a piece of modern 
folklore concerning the alleged presence of Patty Hearst at a local 
dance; the second is a well-known joke about a mule who, during a heat 
wave, saw corn pop on the stalk in the field and, thinking it was snow, 
froze to death. Both modern and classic folklore here serve the same 
function and in this context the story-tellers make little distinction 
between the two. 
Selection #3 documents the day Tim Slate and his sister took 
his tobacco to be auctioned at the New Farmer's Market in Mt. Airy. 
This selection consists of three separate parts: 
1. Tim Slate talking to Charles Wolfe shortly after a 
government inspector placed a minimum support price 
on Tim's stacks; 
2. the sounds of auctioneers selling two of Tim's stacks; 
3. Tim reacting to the prices he got for what amounted 
to a good part of his summer's work, and reflecting 
on the uncertainties of tobacco farming in general.

8 August 1978; Stone Mountain Craft Shop, Traphill, North Carolina; 
Pat Mullen, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R23. 
The next five selections on this reel explore the different 
ways people in the Blue Ridge come to grips with the stereotyped "hill¬ 
billy" image thrust on them by the outside world. There are a surprising 
number of different responses to this image, some dating back several 
generations, some relatively new. 
One of these responses involves the gradual acceptance and 
even appropriation of such stereotypes by hill people themselves. "My 
Virginia Rose"is one of a number of old Tin Pan Alley songs romantici¬ 
zing the hills or the South which became very popular with early country 
musicians. Many of these songs were designed for the vaudeville or 
minstrel stage and written by tunesmiths who had never seen the moun¬ 
tains ; they gradually found their way into the South and more than a 
few entered oral tradition, Virginia Rose" was originally recorded 
by the Carter Family in 1936—one of a number of such sentimental, 
romantic songs they helped to popularize. 
Ruth Holbrook's subtle guerrilla action against snobbish out¬ 
siders who come into her shop represents rejection of these stereotypes. 
Ruth complains that not all stereotyping necessarily comes from northerners, 
but that some of it comes from fellow North Carolinians who live down on 
the Piedmont or near the coast. In some of her tricks and jokes, she 
uses an age-old ploy and lets her subjects' own hasty prejudgements 
lead them into foolish moves. 
6. We Are The Hillbillies; Eunice McAlexander, narration; white;

7• Growing Up In Lowgap; (including performance of "Blue Moon of 
Kentucky"); Fern Evans, narration and vocal lead, with Melrose Smith 
(Fern's sister) (electric bass), Melanie Smith (banjo), Bruce Evans 
(Fern's son) (rhythm guitar), and Brian Smith (snare drum); white; 
22 September 1978; Toast, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and Charles 
Wolfe, fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R66. 
8. The Hillbilly Kid on State; Boyden Carpenter, narrative; white; 
25 September 1978; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-CW-R81. 
(i Reruns of old television shows depicting rural stereotypes, 
such as'The Andy Griffith Show" and'‘Beverly Hillbilliesare still very 
popular on the Blue Ridge. In fact, a number of inhabitants insist 
that 'the "Mayberry" of “The Andy Griffith Show'* was in reality Sparta, 
North Carolina and are rather proud of this fact. Yet, as Eunice 
McAlexander points out, many children from the area do not associate 
themselves with the stereotype hillbillies of these shows. 
-20- 
Growing Up in Lowgap represents a more modern response to 
the hillbilly stereotype, one that is tied to upward mobility and what 
might be termed "hillbilly chic." The family of Fern Evans—the Ramey 
Family— has genuine roots in rural Surry County, and Fern herself per¬ 
formed in the 1930's and 19^0's with famous traditional musicians like 
Tommy Jarrell. Yet most members of the family are now rather well-to-do 
and musically and culturally sophisticated; they count among their 
acquaintances Nashville country music stars like Ronnie Stoneman. In 
this selection, we hear Fern deliberately exaggerating her "hillbilly" 
background, which she had sought for years to overcome, and using it to 
introduce another romanticizing song, "Blue Moon of Kentucky." (The song 
itself was written and popularized by blue grass star Bill Monroe in 
19lt6.) When she comments, "We were poop before it became popular to 
be poor," she is revealing much of the impulse underlying this newer 
attitude toward stereotyping. 
Boyden Carpenter is from nearby Alleghany County, North 
Carolina, and was one of the first traditional musicians in the area 
to try to commercially exploit his hillbilly image. By 1930 he was 
a successful radio performer, billing himself as "The Hillbilly Kid," 
and sprinkling his performances with jokes and stories emphasizing from 
how far back in the hills he had come. The stage costume he describes 
was not all that different from the ones worn by many other genuine 
traditional mountain musicians who tried to perform commercially in the 
early days of country music. Ironically, these costumes were as 
successful with rural audiences as with northern or urban vaudeville 
and radio audiences; even popular radio shows like "The Grand Ole Opry" 
and "National Barn Dance" utilized such "hayseed" images. 
9. The New River Blues; Jim Marshall, vocal and banjo, with Artie 
Marshall, guitar; white; 28 September 1978; near Hillsville, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R96. 
The set of performances illustrating "sense of place" con¬ 
cludes with a self-described "protest song" by Jim Marshall, a former 
truck driver and part-time auctioneer from Hillsville, Virginia. The 
song was written in 1976 during the successful fight against the plan 
to dam the New River. Its concluding stanzas summarize much of the 
fierce pride in the land felt by the people of the Blue Ridge—as well 
as their fear that the land is being threatened by forces in modern 
society. 
You took our mountains and our rivers, 
Turned them to a rich playground. 
Take our homes to build your dams. 
So in luxury you can abound. 
You bought our lawmen with your money. 
So they'll vote for what you say. 
Why dqn't you stay in your big cities. 
And leave our land for another day? 
-21- 
Where are you gonna take your children. 
Show them nature at its best? 
If you dam up the last river. 
You might as well take all the rest.

i 
After declining in the 1950’s, regular weekly square dances 
are again becoming popular in the Blue Ridge; such dances are routinely 
advertised in local papers and nearly always feature live string band 
music. One of the busiest "working bands" in the Galax area is that of 
Whit (Howdy) Sizemore, who play a couple of dances a week, in addition 
to radio work and promotional work for local merchants. The weekly 
dance at Fairview, Virginia, has been held for about eleven years and 
now occurs in a large, modern building. Officially no drinking is 
allowed and an admission fee of $2.00 to $3.00 is charged. One of the 
band members asserted, "We really pack'em in here in winter. On a good 
night this winter we're likely to make as much as $1*5.00 each." Most 
of the dances are called, though on occasion the caller will sit out and 
let the dancers do free form buck dancing; often the caller will take 
microphone in hand and get down off the stage to call as he joins the 
dancers. At this dance, cornmeal was sprinkled on the hardwood floor and 
this accounts for the shuffling sound heard on the selection. The caller, 
Brian Bollinger, learned the art some forty years ago when he would go 
by wagon to the famous fiddling contests at White Top, Virginia; like 
mpny callers, he half speaks, half sings through the selection. "Sugar 
Hill" is a widely known tune in the area. This selection (like many 
dance performances) lasted nearly twenty minutes and a four minute 
excerpt is presented here. 
2. Barn Raising; Lester and Lizzie Carter, narration; black; 13 
September 1978; Patrick County, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-PM-R50. 
Black farmers along the ridge were often integrated into the 
white rural culture of the area and Lester Carter's description of barn 
building, with blacks and whites working together, bears this out. Such 
communal work gatherings also often included threshing and other forms 
of crop gathering as well as building. 
3."The Two Foxes," Jack in the Bush, and Town Ball; Matt Burnett, 
narrative; white; l6 September 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Pat Mullen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-PM-R56. 
Matt Burnett is a 7^-year-old retired auctioneer, a skilled 
toy-maker, and a locally respected story-teller. He is a fund of local 
supernatural legends and historical anecdotes. His narrative presented 
here reflects two distinct types of traditional social entertainment: 
"recitations" and game-playing. Matt recites an old poem he memorized 
as a child as a school exercise. In the early decades of the century it 
-2k- 
yas quite common to include such recitations along with music-making 
as a normal typq of entertainment. Many such entertainments were held 
in local school houses and poems like "The Two Foxes" were learned by 
children as part of their formal education. There is a distinct corpus 
of such recitation poems still remembered by many older residents of the 
South and Midwest; many had their origin in printed forms in nine¬ 
teenth century England and America, but some have been in oral tradition 
for so long that it is difficult to track them down to their original 
texts. (For a collection of such texts, with commentary, see Michael 
R. Turner, Parlour Poetry: A Casket of Gems, 1969.) 
4. Long Tongue Women; instrumental performance by The Korn Kutters, 
which includes Ivan Weddle (fiddle). Freeman Slusher (guitar), George 
Slusher (harmonica), and Willard Glower (banjo); white; 28 September 
1973; at home of D.J. and Janet Keith, Willis, Floyd County, Virginia; 
Tom Adler, fieldworker, and Tom Adler and Carl Fleischhauer, recordists; 
BR8-TA-R45. 
It is still reasonably common for neighbors on the Blue Ridge 
to get together to make informal string band music at home. The Korn 
Kutters, a group accustomed to playing together informally with occa¬ 
sional performances at dances, exhibit a fairly typical Galax string 
band sound. The fiddle and harmonica as twin lead instruments have 
been documented in the area since the 1920's in recordings by Ernest 
Stoneman (Galax), The Red Fox Chasers (Surry County, North Carolina) 
and the Floyd County Ramblers (from the same immediate area as the Korn 
Kutters). The conversation before and after the selection suggests the 
informal social context in which the music is produced. The tune "Long 
Tongue Women," while traditional, is not normally played as a string 
band instrumental. At the end of this excerpt one of the band members re¬ 
fers to "an old record" of this piece. He was probably referring to a 
1926 recording by Georgia singer and guitarist Riley Puckett (Columbia 
15049)» 'who performs the tune at a more sedate tempo. The first stanza 
of Puckett's version goes: 
I am lonesome and depressed. 
Got a woman who talks so fast. 
How she gets every word of the news. 
She can talk a wind to death. 
Just before he gets his breath. 
And the way she works the jobbers beats the Jews. 
5. Barber Shop Stories; actuality. Town and Country Barber Shop; 
white; 24 August 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Terry Eiler, fieldworker, 
and Wes Leishman and Harley Jolley, recordists; BR8-TE-R3. 
Local small town barber shops provide one of the most vital 
settings for informal story-telling among older men. The Town and Country 
-25- 
Barber Shop is owned by Basil Lanerith and Rodney Busick. Customers 
present during the taping included A. Vance Choate, Ernest Cleary, John 
Reeves, P.C. Collins, Jr. (local politician), Tom Bledsoe, Tab Williams, 
and Russell Gentry. This excerpt illustrates how fictional jokes and 
real-life local character anecdotes are integrated into the general 
fabric of discussion. Talk starts about elders in the local Presby¬ 
terian church, and this sets up the first fictional joke about St. Peter 
and the two dollars. The theme of this joke is then applied to more 
local real life situations, until one of the barbers offers a second 
fictional joke, about the lack of lawyers in Heaven. This idea is then 
at once applied to a local sermon preached the Sunday before about lawyers; 
one customer, a retired lawyer, is reassured that nothing was said about 
him. The old lawyer then tells a story about a man who wanted to appeal 
his case. After an interval, this calls forth an apparently unrelated 
story about the peg-leg moonshiner, a local character; this in turn calls 
forth two other stories about local moonshiners. 
6. Hen Party Stories; actuality. Stone Mountain Craft Shop; white; 
18 September 1978; Traphill, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R63. 
A local "hen party" (the term used by the participants) of 
women in the Traphill community provides a feminine counterpart to the 
male story-telling session just heard. The women participating here 
include Ruth Holbrook and four of her friends. In contrast to the 
stories told by the men in the Sparta barber shop, these stories are all 
personal experience anecdotes, and all have a slightly off-color in¬ 
formality; this particular sequence of stories was told at the end of a 
ninety-minute party in which a variety of longer personal experience anec¬ 
dotes had been told. One speaker tells a story about a corncob, another 
woman then tells a story about converting buttwipers to backscratchers. 
Ruth Holbrook, at the fieldworker’s urging, tells about how to flush an 
outdoor toilet; this leads to an account of the Sunday School teacher. 
Ruth then tells about the "bandaid" bikini, which is responded to by a 
story about topless horseback riders, followed by one about a see-through 
blouse, and Ruth concludes with a story about the boy in cut-offs.

1. Telling Jokes to Uncle Emory; woman storyteller, narrative; 
white; 15 September 1978; North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson, field- 
worker and recordist; BR8-GJ-R59- 
Even informal storytellers are often self-concious of their 
abilities, as this narrative demonstrates. The two jokes are embroir:- 
dered in the framework of a story about a visit to a sick uncle. A 
psychologist might s culate that such "framing" redeems the fact that 
both are slightly off-color, and the fact that it cheers up a sick man 
provides a utilitarian justification for such frivolous pursuits as 
joke-telling. 
2. Bluegrass Sally Ann and Bill Cheatham; instrumental performances

Tom Adler, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-TA-RU2. 
Shockley's Shell Service Station in downtown Hillsville is a 
local gathering place for bluegrass jam sessions, usually on Tuesday 
nights. The action usually starts around 8:00 p.m. and soon the inside 
of the station is jammed with pickers and onlookers; "A lot of nights 
there are so many cars in here that we can't even get to the pumps to 
wait on customers," remarked Tom Ferris, one of the attendants. This 
excerpt offers a glimpse of how the tunes in such a jam session are 
chosen; it begins by Schockley reminding the musicians that he's in no 
hurry to closed down for the night. The impromptu nature of the music 
is underscored by the voices advising what key a number is in and by 
some confusion over the banjo-fiddle exchange of leads in "Bluegrass 
Sally Ann." The musicians all come from the Hillsville-Galax area, and 
two of the, Wendell Cockerham and Ronnie Lyon, have recently recorded 
(with, respectively. The Mountain Ramblers and Joe Ed King).

3. Fox Hunters' Field Trial; actuality, featuring voice of Peter 
Cole; white; 1 September 1978; near Elk Hill, Carroll County, Virginia; 
Charles Wolfe and Carl Fleischhauer, fieldworkers, and Carl Fleischhauer, 
recordist; BR8-CW-R3. 
Over the Labor Day weekend, the Twin County Fox Hunters Club, 
from Grayson and Carroll counties, held an all-night field trial for their 
fox hounds. The event attracted over 180 entries and reflected the popu¬ 
larity of fox hunting as a "gentleman's sport" in the region; fox hunters 
point with pride to the fact that George Washington started the sport in 
this country. This field trial consisted of a bench show, where the dogs 
were judged on the basis of conformation, and an all night run, wherein 
the dogs were cast at a certain point and scored by judges roaming the 
area throughout the night. (Each dog was identified by a number painted 
on his side.) The next morning the scores were totalled and prizes were 
awarded. Heard here are three different segments from the field trial 
recordings: in the first segment, Pete Cole, the master of the hounds.

instructs his judges prior to the cast; in the second. Cole supervises 
the loading of the hounds into trucks to he carried to the point where 
they will he released; in the third, we hear the sounds of the cast and 
the hounds running through the woods at night. 
H. Rafe Brady’s Fox Hunt; Rafe Brady, fiddle and vocal, with Dean 
Brady (guitar), Jim Marshall (5-string hanjo), Artie Marshall (guitar), 
and Ronnie Lyon, (mandolin); white; 28 September 1978; Hillsville, 
Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R92. 
For generations traditional southern fiddlers have attempted 
to recreate the sounds of a fox chase on their instruments and 65-year- 
old Rafe Brady, from Laurel Fork, Virginia, is no exception. Brady’s 
commentary localizes the piece, with specific local place names, and 
his tune is somewhat different from the normal tune used by fiddlers 
for the fox hunt imitation. Brady recorded an earlier version of this 
piece for the Library of Congress in 1937 (13^7 B2, mislabelled as by 
"Drake" Brady), a version almost identical to this one done 4l years 
later. 
5. Little Massey Grove; sung by Eunice McAlexander; white; 21 Sep¬ 
tember 1978; Meadows of Dan, Virginia; Wally Macnow, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-WM-R2. 
The unaccompanied singing of old ballads, one of the most 
classic forms of folkmusic, is almiost extinct today in the Blue Ridge, 
though it was flourishing there as recently as fifty years ago. The 
few remaining singers are highly self-concious preservers of the art, 
like Eunice McAlexander, who has been recording her songs and ballads 
for folklorists since the 1930's. Here she sings an old British ballad 
about marital infidelity that was quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher's 
l6ll drama. The Knight of the Burning Pestle. (Child, James F., 
The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v. II, p. 2^2 ff, 8l. "Little 
Musgrave and Lady Barnard.";

1. Testimony and Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down; congregation 
of Clark's Creek Progressive Primitive Baptist Church; black; 10 
September 1978; near Ararat, Patrick County, Virginia; Blanton Owen, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-BO-R29. 
This is an excerpt from a rural black service that features 
testimony by a congregation member, followed by a spiritual. "Satan 
Your Kingdom Must Come Down" was not sung from a hymnbook and the 
pianist gives up trying to follow the song after a few bars. 
2. What A Time We’re Living In; Reverend Robert Akers, vocal, with 
W.C. (Calvin) Hawkins, second voice, and Junior Hawkins (piano), Alex 
Shupe (guitar), Donnie Felts (electric bass), and Kim Shupe (drums): 
white; 20 August 1978; Galax, Virginia; Blanton Owen, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-B0-R11. 
i . ' i 
Tent revivals are popular in the Blue Ridge and one of the 
more successful ones is run by Reverend Robert Akers of Hillsville. 
Akers 1 revivals contain about as much music as preaching—music which 
owes stylistic debts to modern black gospel and country music as well 
as traditional rural hymnody. This is one of a number of original 
gospel songs composed by Akers and it uses a number of traditional 
call-and-response patterns and imagery. 
3. Preaching by Inspiration; Quincy Higgins, narration and singing; 
white; 9 September 1978; Sparta, North Carolina; Geraldine Johnson and 
Pat Mullen, fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-GJ-R31. 
This is a sort of cante fable—a mixture of song and story— 
designed to support one of the strongest tenants of southern rural 
Protestantism: the value of "inspiration" over "book learning." Higgins' 
story also has subtle class overtones, as well as implications for the 
whole ethos of traditional versus modern. Mr. Higgins, born in 1900, 
has been a farmer most of his life and is a member of the Big Springs 
Regular Baptist Church. 
b. Hymn #6l; sung by congregation of Crossroads Primitive Baptist 
Church; white; 20 August 1978; Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia; Carl 
Fleischhauer, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
This example of unaccompanied congregational singing (from 
Daly's Primitive Baptist Hymn Book) is one of the oldest and "purest" 
typep of religious music still extant in the Blue Ridge. The Primitive 
Baptist Church, which discourages the use of instruments or "specialty" 
singing in church, is very strong in the area and accounts for the 
strength of this tradition.

5* Conversion Story; Jesse Hatcher, narration; black; 17 August 
1978; near Ararat, Virginia; Pat Mullen, fieldworker, and Carl 
Fleischhauer, recordist; BR8-CF-R5. 
One of the most prevalent forms of story-telling extant 
in the Blue Ridge today is the "conversion story:" personal experi¬ 
ence narratives about how the story-teller found religion and joined 
the church. Similar stories were collected from both whites and 
blacks. 
6. Amazing Grace;sung by the congregation of the Macedonia Baptist 
Church, lined out by Deacon Walter Brown; black; 10 September 1978; 
near Sparta, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe and Geraldine Johnson, 
fieldworkers, and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R25. 
"Lining out" hymns dates from the time when only the preacher 
(or song-leader) had a hymn book, and consists of the song-leader 
chanting a line of the hymn to the congregation, followed by the con¬ 
gregation singing the line. This practice is found in both white and 
black churches, though it is preserved today out of a self-concious 
gense of tradition rather than as a functional necessity.

3. Somewhere Listening for My Name; same as #1, except BR8-CW-R26. 
These three consecutive performances from a service at the 
rural Macedonia Baptist Church suggest some of the interplay and, flow 
of a black service. The piano player continues to play behind Reverend 
Young's excellent prayer, giving it an added emotional and aesthetic 
dimension. "Somewhere Listening for tty Name" was completely ad lib: 
the preacher had stepped up to the lectern to begin the sermon when 
song-leader Leonard Bryan began, without benefit of book or warning 
the choir. 
4. Conversion Experience; Florence Cheek, narration; white; 19

This is a remarkable conversion experience told by a 74-

These four hymns (taken from Stamps-Baxter's Favorite Songs

church, and represent the variety of song styles (and singing styles) 
routinely heard in one church. The styles range from the older "unison" 
style with harmony or "part" work ("How Happy Are They"), to the more 
modern gospel-quartet style of the call-and-response pattern ("When the 
Redeemed Are Gathering In), and an example of lining a hymn ("Must Jesus 
Bear the Cross Alone").

2. Wayfaring Stranger; as for #1. 
3. Holding to His Hand of Love; sung unaccompanied by the Schuyler 
Family; white; 1+ September 1978; Lowgap, North Carolina; Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R13. 
This reel consists of various performances by different white 
gospel music groups in the study area; they cover a spectrum from the 
most traditional unaccompanied family singing styles to bluegrass gospel 
to more modern country-tinged gospel. This spectrum, along with more 
modern and more fully amplified forms of gospel music is widespread in 
the area today; indeed, gospel music is more prevalent than the fiddle 
and banjo music customarily associated with the Blue Ridge. 
"Palms of Victory" is sung by Marshall Largen, a part-time 
independent preacher, his two daughters, Barbara and Brenda, and an 
old friend. Bill Scott. Mr. Largen has a regular weekly radio program 
in Hillsville, Virginia (WHHV), and has lived in the Laurel Fork area 
all of his life. "Palms of Victory" (also known as "Deliverance Will 
Come") has been rather widely known and recorded, but the Largens, as 
well as other local gospel singers, insist the song originated in the 
southwestern Virginia area and was a local favorite. Both this song 
and "Wayfaring Stranger" were sung from old shape-note paperbacked song 
books. 
The Schuyler Family, consisting of E. Caldwell Schuyler, his 
wife. Avis, and son, Trent, has been singing together for twelve years, 
usually without accompaniment. Today they routinely make two to three 
appearances a week at area churches, accepting only "gas money" for 
their work. This song, taken from a 1937 Stamps-Baxter shape note song 
book, demonstrates the "afterbeat," an "echo" effect so characteristic of 
modern gospel quartet music, introduced in the late 1920's by Tennessee 
music publisher James D. Vaughn.

-37- 
Mrs. Ella Draughan, 76, has recently been playing piano with 
the Schuyler Family in their church appearances. She toured with seve¬ 
ral regionally famous gospel quartets, playing on the radio and at rural 
schoolhouses in the 1930*s and 19^0's. As part of a typical concert in 
those days, she would play one or two "piano specials", such as the ones 
she plays: driving, almost ragtime performances of exuberant gospel 
hymns. 
"Where We’ll Never Grow Old" is sung in the "classic" quartet 
style that originated in the 1920's and has come to dominate mainstream 
white gospel music. This particular song was one of the first gospel 
songs to become widely popular on records, when it was recorded by 
Smith's Sacred Singers, a Georgia group, in 1925- The Schuyler Family 
here is joined by an old singing companion, A.P. Thompson; now 79 years 
old, Mr. Thompson was an original member of The Red Fox Chasers, a famous 
old-time string band from Surry County which recorded prolifically in the 
late 1920's. Though he no longer sings regularly with a quartet, Mr. 
Thompson still has a fine, clear voice. 
7- The Other Side of Jordan; sung and played by The Elk Horn Four, 
consisting of Warren Lowe (lead singer and rhythm guitar), his wife, 
Ethel Lowe (harmony vocal and electric bass), Edward Spears (lead accous- 
tic guitar), and JoAnne Monk (piano); white; 19 September 1978; near 
Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R59" 
Here is a modern gospel song performed by a local group that 
performs in the Grayson and Carroll county area. The sound of the group 
(especially the harmony), as well as the type of songs they perform, 
shows the influence of country music on the gospel tradition. 
8. Tell Me His Name Again; Larry Richardson, vocal and guitar; white; 
12 September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and 
recordist; BR8-CW-R3^. 
"Tell Me His Name Again" is an original composition by Larry 
Richardson, a friend of the Lowe family documented in the preceding 
selection. Richardson was, until about ten years ago, a nationally 
known bluegrass performer and frequent winner of the banjo and guitar 
contests at the Galax fiddlers' convention. His 1955 recording of "Let 
Me Fall" was one of the most influential bluegrass records of the time. 
After undergoing a personal crisis, Richardson joined the church and for 
a time stopped playing completely. When he resumed performing a few years 
ago, he decided to play only gospel music, albeit in a solid bluegrass 
style. He now travels the country as an evangelist, singing, picking, and 
preaching in churches from Ohio to Florida.

9. Twilight is Falling; Jim Marshall, vocal and 5-string banjo, 
with Artie Marshall, harmony vocal and guitar; white; lb September 1978; 
near Hillsville, Virginia; Charles Wolfe and Howard Marshall, fieldworkers, 
and Charles Wolfe, recordist; BR8-CW-R37• 
Jim Marshall explains that this is an old song once associated 
with Robert Sheffey, a famous circuit-riding preacher from nearby Wythe 
County Virginia who travelled the area in the nineteenth century. After 
Jim heard about Sheffey and his song, he began to hunt for the song and 
finally found a copy in a song book published by Albert Brumley in 
Missouri. He and his wife perform the old hymn in classic bluegrass style 
and it is a favorite with friends and fans of the Marshalls in south¬ 
western Virginia.

River baptism is still common in rural North Carolina, and 
the location in Carson's Creek has for generations served the needs of 
many of the churches in Surry County. In this excerpt members of the 
Mountain View Baptist Church participate in the baptizing of several 
new members. After each immersion, the congregation standing on the 
banks sings a few bars of "Oh Happy Day." At the end of the immersions, 
both preachers, still standing in the water, deliver impromptu sermons 
to the congregation on the bank.

Church; white; 17 September 1978; near Baywood, Grayson County, Virginia;

BR8-CW-R69. 
The New Covenant Association is an organization of black Baptist 
churches in the southwestern Virginia-northwestern North Carolina area, 
and the members all get together once a year for a day-long session of 
preachingj, singing, and "dinner on the ground." This performance, on 
which perhaps as many as 150 voices are heard, preceded the preaching in 
the Sunday morning service. 
5- A Home in Heaven; sung by Mr. and Mrs. Jess Higgins; white; 23 
September 1978; near Galax, Virginia; Geraldine Johnson and Charles Wolfe, 
fieldworkers and recordists; BR8-CW-R69. 
For twelve years. Elder Jess Higgins (of the Galax Primitive 
Baptist Church) has had his own radio program over local station WBOB. 
On that thirty-minute program. Elder Higgins and his wife sing un¬ 
accompanied songs and deliver a quarter-hour message. Higgins tapes 
each show in his home late Saturday night before the Sunday it is to 
be broadcast. This selection was recorded as Higgins taped his show 
for Sunday, 2h September 1978. The song is from The Primitive Baptist 
Hymn Book. 
6. Statement About Gospel Music; Jess Higgins, narration; as for #5,

Charles Wolfe, fieldworker and recordist; BR8-CW-R93. 
Gospel music is so pervasive in the Blue Ridge that even a 
hard-living traditional old-time fiddler like Rafe Brady has a sacred 
song or two in his repertory.

SEEDS PLANTED WHEN THE EARTH IS— 
In Arjes, which is a Movable Fire Sign, 
governed by the Sun, make rapid growth 
and abundance of straw and tops, ac¬ 
cording as the Moon is old or new. 
In Taurus, which is a Fixed Earthly 
Sign, governed by Mercury, will do good 
for all root crops of quick growth, 
i In Gemini, which is a Barren Sign, 
will not make a good growth. This is a 
good time to stir the soil and subdue all 
noxious weeds. 
In Ganger, vyhich is a Watery, Fruit¬ 
ful Movable Sign, germinate quickly. It 
is favorable to growth and insures an 
abundant yield. 
In Leo, which is a Barren, fiery Sign, 
will die, as it is only favorable to the de¬ 
struction of noxious growth. Trim no 
trees or vines when the Moon or Earth 
is in Leo, for they will surely die. 
In Virgo, which is also a Barren sign, 
as it is unfavorable to growth of seed or 
transplanting. 
In Libra, which is a strong Movable 
Sign, does well, it is next after Cancer 
for good effect. Seed planted at this time 
produces vigorous pulp growth and roots 
and a reasonable amount of grain. 
In Scorpio, which is Fruitful, produc¬ 
ing Watery effects. Next best after 
Cancer. 
In Sagittarius, which is a Fiery, Mac- 
culine Sign, will not do well, as it is not 
a very favorable time to plant or trans¬ 
plant. 
In Capricorn, which is a Moist, Mov¬ 
able Sign, will produce a rapid growth of 
pulp, stalks or roots, but not much grain. 
In Aquarius, which is an Airy, Mascu¬ 
line Sign, is only thrown away, as it will 
not grow well. 
In Pisces, which is Fruitful, Watery 
Feminine Sign, will produce excellent re¬ 
sults and is third best sign for producing 
the fruits of the earth. 
The Air Signs are the best to harvest 
in. The Fire Signs are second best. Never 
gather fruit, grain or vegetables in the 
Watery' Signs or new of the moon, as 
they will surely decay or sprout. Just 
before full Moon is the best to gather for 
shipping. 
All plants, trees and vegetables plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon will grow 
vigorously. All crops that produce their 
yield above the ground should be plant¬ 
ed in the new of the moon. Those that 
produce their yield in the ground should 
be planted in the old of the moon. 
Aries, Taurus, Libra and Capricorn 
are good Fruitful Signs. Cancer, Scorpio 
and Pisces are the best and most pro¬ 
ductive in the order named, being wa¬ 
tery they assist vegetation to withstand 
drought and produce much fruit and 
grain. Sagittarius and Aquarius are poor 
Signs. Leo, Gemini and Virgo are Bar¬ 
ren, the strongest in the order named, 
and are best to destroy weeds and all 
noxious growth. The first day the Moon 
is in a Sign is better than the second and 
the second is better than the third. 
(V) New Moon, Increasing 
During this Moon plant the following: 
Asparagus, Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, 
Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celery, Corn, Cu¬
