A SKATOLIAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By Andy Powers. 
Sing by the Powers Bros. 
What a 
pleasure on a 
moonlight night, 
When the stars do brightly shine; 
Te skate upon the silvery ice, 
Just about the hour of nine. 
With your sweetheart by your side, 
You glide along so nice, 
And all is joy and happiness, 
In the moonlight ou the ice. 
Break. 
Singing, dancing skating in the moonlight. 
Dance. 
CHORUS. 
The silvery moon is your guiding star, 
As you glide along so nice, 
When it's getting late, then you homeward skate, 
In the moonligdt on the ice. 
At evening when our daily work is done, 
We go out for a 
pleasant lark, 
Sliding down the hills. great fun, 
Or skating in the park. 
Some may like skating in the rink, 
And think it's very nice; 
But it's my delight, on a 
cold clear night, 
To go skating on the ice.

the great skatorial Artists, the Powers Bros. 
Now on a 
pleasant af ernoon, 
What a 
pleasure great one feels, 
To glide along a 
boarded rink 
Upon your skates of wheels. 
Now some may like some other sport, 
But by far the best I 
think, 
Is to meet the girls with golden curls, 
While flirting in the rink. 
CHORUS. 
Now some may say that is not gay, 
But its delightful now I 
think, 
Upon a 
sunny af ernoori 
To go flirting in the rink. 
Ile boys rir: gay ; Ind happy, 
And the girls are fair and sweet, 
A pleasant smile you get the while, 
From every one you meet.

Who hinds me with a

There was a 
little girl she came from the south, 
Oh ! 
he was a 
lovely creature; 
The hens built a

Now Tar Heeled Liz I 
love you, 
You are so aggravating, 
With your mouth catching flies off the corners of your eyes 
You look quite captivating 
You're envied by the wenches all, 
For none can come up to you; 
The ducky dove that this coon does love, 
Is my charming Tar Heeled Lu. 
When she goes to a 
ball, the wenches large and sma'1, 
Of Tar Heeled Lu gets jealous, 
When walking for the cake a 
pretty sight we make, 
And at last the coons all get jealous. 
'Till the break of day we'll dance away, 
And she drove me with love quite silly, 
And Oscar Wilde the o,her day, 
Bald she was the Jersey lily. 
Queen of the Ice. 
By Andy Powers. :sung by the Powers BroS. 
One winter's day for fan and sport, 
I 
to Central Park did go, 
The air was clear and frosty, 
And the g

I 
met a 
fairy charmer who 
Looked jast too sweet and nice, 
They called her pretty Rosalie, 
The queen belle of the ice., 
CHORUS. 
She looked so captivating that, 
My love she did entice, 
My Rosalie so gay and free, 
The queen bale of the ice. 
Now hand in hand around the park, 
The both of us did glide. 
I 
felt so bright and happy while 
She skated by my side. 
While o'er the ice we skated, 
I 
my • ale of love did tell, 
I 
won the heart and affectiousof

Chorus, 
MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST, 
BY 
JOTIS LOCKE. 
Recited by Mr. J. F. SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & STILL/VAN, at HARRY 
IsIn.TEns's THEATRE, N. Y., and throughout the country. 
Th' anam an Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sireland! 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
hid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another flight, 
There's so much joy in returning 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornite; 
Oh. Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged 
A 
million of waves come trooping. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloomed it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love-light first illumed it. 
VIORNING ON THE IRISH COAST—CONTINUED. 
And doesn't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up against the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's bells, 
Ah, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en so, 'twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ops 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Ah! oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave, 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
All danger and doubtings scornin', 
'I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore-line show 
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze, 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old songs, old friends again, 
The vale and cot I 
was born in! 
Oh, Ireland, up from my heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the top of the morniu', 
MONEY. 
Assoc with immense saocess by the only Miss NELLIE 02.1allerl. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Always makes a 
good friend and a 
cronie; 
In a 
palace you'll dwell, there cut a 
great swell, 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
At office, of course, you're perfection, 
Your name bears great weight at election; 
You can have your own way, for you know you can pay 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Your name without Esquire, looks funny; 
The ladies all cry, and after you sigh, 
It's not for yourself, but your money. 
You'll have friends in abundance to greet you, 
It's how do you do when they meet you; 
Just lend me a 
ten, I'll pay you again, 
But that is the last of your money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
You will not be elected a 
dummy; 
With no fear of the law, you can open your Jaw; 
And laugh at the Judge, if you have money, 
If at racing or cards you've been simple, 
Drank wine till your nose is a 
pimple, 
In some Prison cr Jail, no friends to go WI, 
Then you'll know what it is to have money,

at Yolks Theatre, Brooklyn. 
A 
YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name—

The boys they used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp—

At first the times were rather rough, 
But now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough—

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here : to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each clay, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
ttiSt beoause I 
am Irish they would give mc at worfr. 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you,that such things shonld be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast tpon them 
In America's troubles in days long ago. 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of re,t away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there,

Our soldiers on parade, 
With mu: ic sweet and tramping feet, 
Bright uniforms arrayed. 
But I 
know a

Who is handsome, brave and gay, 
The ladies faint with love's complaint 
When he gets in their way. 
CnoRus. 
Major Majolica, he is a

Brave and handsome, dashing and gay. 
He is a

The major is mashing the ladies all (1:-.y. 
[Repeat Chorus.1 
When cannons go off he gives a 
laugh, 
Says, " Load ' em and go it again I" 
When bullets are thick he always is quick 
To escape any danger or pain. 
He draws his sword, says "Onward, boys r 
And then goes to the rear. 
The girls would die, or else they'd sigh, 
If they lost the major dear.

My Pretty Irish Queen, Farewell! 
Words and Music by FIELDS & LESLIE, the only Neat Irish Dancing 
and Singing Artists in America, who never fail to please. 
-----: 0 :-
In a 
distant sunny land that's far away, 
Ms Erin's lovely isle; 
There lives the fairest maiden in the land, 
And did our hearts beguile: 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
Their glances on us fell; 
-We could no longer stand their thrall, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell! 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-nalf the love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
ClIORUS: 
Oh, yes, I 
thought I 
won her heart, 
And from me I 
thought she ne'er would part 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
They completed just the spell; 
Our hearts were aching when we sailed, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
you chance to roam across the sea, 
To view that Emerald land; 
And you should chance to meet a 
lovely lass, 
So beautiful and bland; 
Do not listen to her silvery voice, 
It weaves a 
dangerous spell; 
But close your ears to her and say, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half her love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. ( Chorus).

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o 
er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tn., past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne .er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall son 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride. 
And you wish me to forgive and to fOrget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
I3y the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ah the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, /co.

Originally sung by Wrr.x. H. Morro, America's Coraique, at the Poe,: 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings are all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
Bat there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'er my mind, 
will tell you here to- night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
Now if perchance you meet an old friend upon the street, 
lie is poor and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his poverty is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done. many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply moun 
Ile's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late. 
'or they n.ever speak a

Price Met-s. 
Here by thy side, love, sadly I 
stand, 
Eager to feel the soft touch of your hand, 
Waiting to hear again thy sweet voice ; 
Tender words breathing to make me rejoice ; 
How have I 
suffered and wished I 
were dead, 
For those sad words that in anger I 
said ; 
Oh, whisper you cherish for all, no regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget, 
unor.us. 
Kiss and forget, love, each angry word ; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard ; 
Kiss and forget love, each angry word ; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard : 
Why should your heart be repining yet ? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Smile on me, dearest, same as of old 
Rest on my bosom thy tresses of gold ; 
Tell me in accents tender and true, 
All that my loving lips once did repeat. 
I 
have been wayward and unkind to you, 
Yet in my heart I 
have ever been true, 
Think of the past with no mournful regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Kiss and forget, &-c. 
Why did we ever wander apart, 
Filling with sorrow each happy young heart, 
Love's rosy pathway should know of no te•.,,s4, 
Never a 
shadow of sorrowful fears. 
Life should be joyous to you and to me, 
Fair as the sunlight that kisses the sea. 
Let us go back to the day that we met.

KICK ME AGAIN.. 
Parody on Kiss Me Again. 
Sung by Andy Collura, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner in front of a 
Dutch grocer:- store. 
Thinking of home, and my clothes all in hock, 
When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my head on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
CHORUS. 
He kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made my stomach feel queer, 
He kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they hang around saloons and cigar stores you bet. 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
And always are ready to kick you once more. 
CHORD'S.

The prettiest girl in all this town lives just across the way 
I'm going to call on her and see if she will name the day; 
She is very sweet on both of us, which one she cannot say, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
She promised to be mine, and said how happy we would be 
Before I 
went away she said she loved no one but me; 
She may be fooling both of us, but now we're going to see 
Which one shall wed Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
CHORUS; 
Katie Ann O'Connor she is the prettiest girl I 
know, 
Katie Ann O'Connor said I 
might be her beau; 
She is sweeter than the flowers that in the garden grow, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. ( Repeat). 
Now all the boys around the town have got her on the brain 
The girls they are so jealous that they're mighty near insane; 
But Katie she don't notice it, she loves me just the same, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
So now we are going to leave you, and will come som e 
other time, 
And when we do, we'll let you know when the marriage 
bells does chime; 
To the wedding we'll invite you all, and won't we have a 
time, 
With this pretty girl, Miss Katie Ann O'Connor.

BEHIND THE SCENES, 
As sung by W ILL. MORTON. 
When but a

To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances i:o -
-
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
Ince that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grsrat 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look brigh‘ 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
us heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the bellet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's may a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are Wilire, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home i 
privacy, 
A. very &lace= state 
yoird find.

Sometimes it is the hush f

Where is my wife and my children so dear?

What care I 
now— friendless am I. 
Cheerless my heart-- deserted my home, 
Never again shall I 
know aught of gladness

Never ag-ain shall I

I 
have a 
fine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Janey she loves me; 
Her throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
CHORUS: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and nay; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on tne table and cry 
My on Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry. 
It's only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
It's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye, 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
Her mother often told me, when 1 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, just look you in my eye, 
Ms a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.

In this cruel world we live in, strange things we often 
see, 
Its motto you will find is wealth, no matter where 
we be; 
If a 
man is rich, you'll always find he's a 
score of 
friends, 
While the poor man for his living, on his labor he 
depends; 
Can't we try and help the needy, and relieve their 
anxious pain, 
And not say, well, we'll do it if we have the chance 
again. 
Now, this nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But, it seems to me, and you'll agree, it's dropping 
every day; 
The Indian War you've heard of, where noble Custet 
fell, 
And in his band not one was left the story for to 
tell; 
In Spain they slaughtered our soldiers, and the news 
from the army came, 
We'd avenge the Virginius and Ouster, if we had 
the chance again.

(2 WE HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN—CONTINUED. 
Now the Winter's been a 
hard one, for the rich as wej 
as poor, 
But better times are coming, boys, of it I 
feel quite 
sure ; 
We've had trouble with our Elections, we have now, 
perhaps, done well, 
I'll speak of neither party, but wait for time to tell; 
There is one thoug-h, I 
will boast of, with a 
true tuld 
honest aim, 
And we'd clf.et old :tarahrun lAncoln if we had the 
chance again. 
We have of :en thought, in sorrow, of lives so good and 
kind, 
Who ne:ped the weary beggar, and left his name 
behind., 
lie was murdered, and his murderer stands a 
free man 
now to- day, 
And it often makes me wonder if a 
jury will take 
pay; 
You've heard of him, I'm certain, his money flowed 
r . in, 
An(1 we'd give Jim Fi,ke a 
bumper, if we had the 
chance again.

JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL. 
Sang by NEE. 13Anny at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Music published at E. H. 
HARDINGS, 229 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no mattcr how clever, how foolish, how wisr-, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck te us all. 
• 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall/ 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's joll,y good luck far 18 all. (Chccus%

Where was Mo - ses

Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c.

Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve,

And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said: 
Cuo:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c.

Some twenty years passed by before I 
heard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a

My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c.

N 
ow when once more the light of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've 'waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, • 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light:

Good Bye. Lovely Lou.

Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y. 
'Twas early in the month of May. I 
said to my girl Lou, 
" 
Now as I 
am going away, I 
want to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at :. ea 
She bowed her lovely head, 
And placed her little hand in mine, 
And this is what she said :

" 
Good bye, good bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, 
And I 
will think of you." 
She said, "To you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought, 
But I'm told you sailors have 
A. wife in every port." 
Says I, "Now Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or deem me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget the girl, 
That I 
would leave behind." 
I 
bade adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted from the shore, 
But something seemed to tell me, 
Tuat I 
never should see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away, 
So now, as Lou has proved urtrue, 
Wily, I 
can only say,

DORKINS' NIGHT, 
Written by BOBBY .7.‘.TEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
Icrn,LIA.m SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music, published by JOHN PERRY, Washington St., opposite Rostov 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage. 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A. family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loy'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely lind a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one nirzlit, ani I 
wns in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would aehe 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi ! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and than 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi I 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-aisttl" 
The people said, sitting ' round me. 
A 
hiss 1 
yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all ' round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk!" tome one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very 4ow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't lauglr 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
L'Il tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh--
Tye a 
little one dying at home 1" 
THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN: 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS fOr ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Reca;ling each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the Gld village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As 'twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
twill answer with spirit serene, 
Al they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines) 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT. 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus Wfu.r.s.ms. 
The theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
barefooted slack- wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here; 
he bar- room was fearfully crowded with beats, 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out. 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah! yak! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure, 
" 
He's away oil his base," says John James Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor; 
brick— well it was—I 
saw Dorking start, 
And carom on the dark red for two, 
And it made meteellthirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, 
I'm the king !" when a 
woman jumped up, 
Cried, " Yor. lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." 
That knocked Dorkins cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and zentlemen," said, 
‘• If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to- night, 
The fault is my wcalth, not my head. 
Many a 
time f 
have made yon all sick, 
And got up and go out for a 
beer, 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
hamlet alone; 
Ill tell you the reason, r 
know you will treat— 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home.

On a

As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
'That morning such a

Such a

Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a

Meaning that my love is true to you.

A

She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me—

If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand,

did, with the one that I

Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a

Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married. I ‘vill wri ,e

In Sing Sing Prison where convicts dwell, 
Many funny stories they can tell; 
In Auburn, too, they cannot lurk, 
They are provided with plenty of hard work; 
U they make a 
mishap, the punishment is hard, 
Three days breaking stones out in the yard; 
And if one trys to mash the keepers' daughter, 
His bill of fare is bread and water. 
What are you in for? Nothing; that's what they all 
say, 
Well, I 
stole a 
suit of clothes and sold it down 
the bay; 
Say Jack it's hard, to-day I 
only eat a 
cracker, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
chew of tobacco; 
The Keeper will drop, I 
heard him yell, 
Nix, or he'll sentence us to the dark cell; 
It's too bad about Jimmy, in life he might have 
risen, 
Only think of dying in a 
lonely State's Prison. 
Who is that fellow Keeper Twelve sent to bed? 
If I 
catch him in the Shoeshop I'll break his head; 
You better let him alone, Mike, the punishment is 
deep, 
Four days without food, and four days without 
sleep; 
Look what he done when Kelly gave him the slip, 
Every day gave him a 
stroke with the whip; 
Well I 
don't give a 
cent, l'il make somebody cry, 
FiJ give any Keeper sauces me a 
smash in the eye.

Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs, 
We are very soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of ours. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
in the paths of daily life. 
Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife. 
Ev'ry tender word that's spoken 
To a 
friend in sad despair, 
Has a

In this bustling world of care. 
Tho' we often, etc. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
When the form is cold and still, 
Though we've helped the poor and needy

But, alas! ' tis soon forgotten

GOING WEST TO DIE. 
Composed and recited by NELLIE GERMON, America's Classic 
Recitationist. 
Well, here we are, my dear old wife, 
On board the train at last, 
Our little all packed in a 
trunk 
With lock and strap made fast; 
I 
hear the bell a 
ringin', 
And the whistle's piercing cry, 
There, wife, we're moving out of town, 
We're going West to die. 
We've been from Jane's to John's house, 
From John's house back to Jane's, 
'Till now they've laid our burden down 
On board the Western train; 
'Tis rather hard to send us off, 
All crippled up and gray, 
To find a 
place in which to die, 
Two thousand miles away. 
Since we broke up a 
keeping house, 
They've carted us around. 
'Till now it seems on earth for us 
A home cannot be found; 
As sure as this old face of mine 
Can ne'er look young again, 
So sure we'll never more return 
To trouble John and Jane. 
They send us to a 
stranger land, 
O'er an untraveled road, 
That Mary, in her Western hoMe 
May bear the heavy load; 
It isn't to be wondered at 
That my eyes are tilled with tears, 
Or that my form is bending down 
With more than weight of years. 
I 
didn't think 'twould come to 
I 
didn't mean it should; 
No home is like your own home, 
Though made of logs and wood!

The Isle That's Crowned With Shamrock 
-:0:-
Sang to great applause all over America by the refined and excel 
lent Motto and Swell Comic Vocalist, CHAS. H . 
DUNCAN. 
.0:-
France has got the Fleur-de-lis, 
And England's got the Rose; 
And Scotland for her Ensign, 
The Heather Thistle shows. 
But Ireland's got the Shamrock, 
In all her valley's seen; 
And ever wears upon her breast, 
The triple leaf of green. 
CHORUS: 
Then Irishmen remember, 
Wherever you may roam; 
The Isle that's crowned with Shamrock, 
Is still your native home. ( Repeat). 
On many a 
foreign battle-field, 
It cheered the Irish boy; 
And won the brighest laurels, 
ri 
At glorious Fontenoy. 
Go where you will, from pole to pole, 
Where'er the Celt may. be; 
You'll find he loves that dear old Isle, 
That sparkles in the sea. 
BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and litusde by Joni( WALsn. The greatest Iiish petriede 
singer in Ameriea. 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
CHORUS: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sons they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear It. 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

TRUST YOU WILL EXCUSE. 
(Companion to " I 
Hope I

Words and music by the same author—W. H. DELZHANTL 
You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of Amberisle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw mycelf away; 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keep from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the moonlight pienie 
They gave at " Amberisle;" 
How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of " bon ton" style. 
It was there I 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I 
asked to see her home 
s She said " I 
can't refuse." 
rsrml 
Oh, when I 
hear, eta. 
Just the ether day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline," 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
teuf3t you will excuse.

Words and music by JAMES T. 
KELLY. 
sung with immense success at Tony Pastor's Theatre by 
KELLY & O'BRIEN. 
Guess who we are you can have us awhile, 
We've cologne on our ulsters and sweet-scented ile; 
We make up our eyebrows with prepared chalks, 
They call us two mossbacks and two big jay hawks. 
We work up in Harlem protecting the Flats, 
And often go gunning for old Thomas cats; 
They gave us three dollars but we stuck out for five, 
And then they said kick it, and see if it's alive. 
We are going over to Europe to play the bazoo, 
Along with Pat Rooney and Mickey McGrew; 
We will show them a 
turn they never saw before, 
And if we don't make a 
hit -We'll make the back door; 
And if we fall flat we'll go down to three balls, 
And insure our lives at Walla Hahn Halls; 
We will then go to Italy for an organ and monkey, 
And cross the blue ocean with J. Rial's donkey.

sense of propriety, 
from doing anyehine that would seem to be an unladylike encourage..

tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the

adopted by the parties to the gaine as their own, unlesu it accords with 
the state of their alien' ions, which fact makes a
