Selected and converted. American Memory, Library of Congress.
[?E-B2 WF.?] KEITH AND HILES LINE We arrived at North Brandon Crandon one morning 'twas
nine.The bartender said, "You're a little behind,The train left for South Brandon Crandon at a quarter
to nineWith four hundred bohunks? for the Keith and Hiles Line."Now this old Mack McGinnish,? you
all know him well,The best old woods foreman left outside of Hell,But when he sees Keith ? a-coming
around,It's a sight to see Mack ? getting over the ground.There's also Sandford E ? in store for the
mill ? You can buy all his wares with a five dollar bill.A pound of old Peerless in his clay pipe you'll
findThat he sells to the bohunks ? of the Keith and Hiles Line.Now I don't know the name of the cook
at the camp,But his doughnuts and pancakes are soggy and damp.And it's corned beef and cabbage
you get every dayThat you handle those gadgets ? so fair and so gay.So we pick up our packsacks
and start for out west;Some nice pretty haystack to find place to restFar away from the snowdrifts
where the weather is fine,And to Hell with the bohunks ? of the Keith and Hiles line.

Warde: Don't change the profanity, that's the way men reallysang..and sing! Some of the words I
can't make out form theold record so have left space.... write in the right one. AndI could have made
other mistakes without knowing it.Listen, Warde, what's a Bohunk, exactly? In the Middle Westit's
applied to "furriners" who came to build the railroads, [md] usually [Hungarians?] or other Central
Europeans [md] and is consideredkind of insulting. Is it insulting in this song, orfriendly? When you
finish singing the song, you might explainthis on the tapes [md] how the word sounded to the guys
