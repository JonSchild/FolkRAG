SP Italian-American life studied 
By Luis Sinco 
STAFF WRITER 
For the next 11/s weeks, folklorist 
David Taylor and a 
five-member re-
search team will scour San Pedro 
for reflections of Italian-American 
life that serve to reinforce the iden-
tity of one of the community's old-
est ethnic groups. 
Funded by the American Folk 
Life Center of the Library of Con-
gress, the group seeks to document 
the culture and traditions of Italians 
in the western United States for a 
book and exhibition commemorat-
ing the Christopher Columbus quin-
centenary in 1992. 
Contemporary life 
"We're not particularly interested 
in quaint things from the past," said 
Taylor, adding that the team will 
focus on various aspects of contem-
porary family and community life 
ranging from religious and social 
chitecture. Members of Taylor's 
group include folklorists Douglas 
DeNatale, Russell Frank and Paola 
Tavarelli, historian John Alexander 
Williams, and photographer Ken 
Light. 
"We're looking for expressions in 
everyday life that are distinctive to 
Italian-Americans in San Pedro," 
said DeNatale, who will specifically 
study geographic, spatial and archi-
tectural traditions in the communi-
ty. 
"Essentially, we're trying to learn 
what Italian-American heritage 
means in this particular place to-
day." 
Large impact 
Research will include interviews 
with individuals whose experience 
may be representative of others in 
the community and the documenta-
tion of occupational, cultural and 
recreational traditions. 
According to Taylor, San Pedro 
project sites because it is a 
relative-
ly small geographic area where Ital-
ians have had a 
large impact, espe-
cially in the development of the 
local fishing industry. 
He said the team will conduct 
subsequent research in 
Gilroy, 
Calif., where the ethnic group also 
helped shape the community. 
Communities in Colorado, Idaho, 
Nevada, Utah and Washington are 
being considered for further field 
work next year. 
Folkloric collection 
By the end of the project, the 
team expects to accumulate more 
than 2,000 hours of recorded inter-
views, 10,000 photographs and 3,000 
pages of field notes, which will be-
come part of the folkloric collection 
at the Library of Congress, DeNa-
tale said. 
"Obviously, we don't want to talk 
to everyone in town," said Frank, 
who will concentrate on the water-
1
ment in maritime occupations. "We 
hope to talk to key people whose 
experience will generally reflect that 
of the entire community." 
Another component of the study 
will be a 
look at the role of Italian-
American women and how it has 
changed over the years, said Tava-
relli, who is fluent in Italian. 
In coming days, the group plans 
to observe and participate in diverse 
activities ranging from sausage-
making in Italian-American house-
holds to possibly taking an extended 
fishing trip with fishermen of Ital-
ian descent. 
Time limited 
"We don't have much time, but 
we want to get as in-depth as we 
can to the extent possible for out-
siders to actually get in," said Tay-
lor, adding that the San Pedro 
phase of the project ends July 31. 
People interested in assisting the 
project may call Taylor at 548-1080,
