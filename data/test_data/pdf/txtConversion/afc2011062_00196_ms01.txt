0:01    Testing equipment.  Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got 
into ironworkers trade? 
 
1:08   Well, I was born in 1949 and actually I was born in a Model-T on White River Hill.  Never 
made it to the hospital but...  Born at a very young age [chuckles].  Well, I grew up south of 
Sanborn, on a little farm. And we farmed for quite a few years. Milking thirteen cows at the 
most, by hand, my younger sister and my older brother and I. And at that time Dad was gone all 
week, and then he’d come home on the weekends.  He was gone on different ironworking jobs. 
And so we’d have a list of chores to do throughout the week. And when he come home on the 
weekend things had better be pretty well done. And back then you did what your parents told 
you. And if you didn’t there was–we had a lot of willow growing up around the place. So we’d 
get to choose whichever stick we wanted. Luckily that didn’t happen very often, but whenever it 
did we deserved it. So we did that. We did the farming for a number of years, through our teen 
years. Kept us off the street, kept us busy. And I think that was dad’s main goal. For the most 
part it was a good life, and we grew up that way, raising our own meat, and started deer hunting 
when we were 12. And Dad wouldn’t buy us a new rifle, he bought us used ones so they were 
broke in and knew that they were good quality. So we, my brother and I, started in with 30/30 
Winchesters. And I’m probably missing a lot of things in-between here, but time is short. 
 
3:28 So we did that and our first hunting experience was being dropped off at the edge of the 
woods, and picked up in the evening. We could go hunt and do whatever we wanted to do. We 
did have training, home training, before we were dropped off.  And Dad always told us that 
during the winter when we have nothing to do to take our rifles down and snap in with them. 
Make sure they were empty, and on safe and everything…and just snap in with them and…get 
used to them.  Probably one of the biggest bucks I ever got in my life was on account of that 
training.  This is after I had been in the Marine Corps and went through all of their training.  I 
had this nice buck standing in front of me and we were taught in the Marine Corps, BRASS…  
Breath, relax, aim, sites, squeeze.  And I did all of that.  Squeezed off the shot.  The buck stood 
there.  And in my mind, I’m just going crazy, trying to figure out what I did wrong.  And I knew 
I had to make a quick decision so I just upped and snapped and shot and down he went.  
And…so that was…Dad’s training.  
 
 
4:55 [Gets choked up thinking about his dad.  Leary talks a little about his late father: [I thought 
a lot about my Dad on the way up here.  He died two years ago.  Every day I think about 
him…than something happens and it reminds me of something he told me.  I was cleaning the 
storm windows yesterday with my brother.  We were putting them on the old home place.  The 
old man would have… He would have been out there cracking the whip on us.  LAUGHS] 
 
5:39  So that was probably one of the best experiences I had.  In that year, Dad had been fighting 
cancer for two years and that was the last…that was the last…time he hunted with us.  We 
started dragging the buck out of the woods.  We had about a mile and a half to drag it.  And it 
was a real dry, crisp year and no snow on the ground.  And Dad had walked into his favorite pine 
tree and that was about as far as he could get.  And he was sitting there when we came dragging 
that buck out.  [Wow.]  And…I had a grin on my face probably like a jack o’lantern.  Buttons 
already to pop off my shirt and Dad says, “It’s a keeper.”  LAUGHS   So we had to kind of laugh 
because when we got the deer out to the car, and went to load it up, one side was bare.  It didn’t 
have any hair left on it I guess because the ground was so dry.  LAUGHS   I’m going to jump 
ahead a little bit here on this story.  Thirty years later, my daughter married a taxidermist and I 
was telling them the whole story about this particular deer.  And he asked me all about which 
way it was facing and what his face looked like and if it had a lot of grey on it.  And whereabouts 
the grey was and things like that.  And…I thought he was being just curious.  Well, thirty years 
later, for Christmas, I get a shoulder mount…of that deer.  [David gets a little choked up.]   I 
don’t know how you would say it but that brought that dead deer back to life.  [Wow.]  Even 
though it was still dead.  But more than that, it about the memory back to life.  He did such a 
good job on it and, right to this day, we have it hanging in the living room with a guarantee 
that…he would fix it if anything was wrong with it.  So it don’t get any better than that.  [Very 
cool.] 
9:04   So that’s just a little bit about growing up.  In my senior year, well, all through this--the 
whole time--Dad is doing his, he always was a great lover of country music and Dad always said, 
“There’s--my two favorite kinds of music are country, and western.”  LAUGHS   And that was 
always interwoven throughout our childhoods and it was quite a bond.  And in the earlier years, 
Mom and Dad made sure we got to Sunday school. And we always had a neighbor, Augie Moss, 
who would come down and have coffee with Mom and Dad on Sunday mornings.  And his 
mother was very old at that time and he would take her to church.  Then he would come down 
and gab with Mom and Dad.  And that was pretty regular.  That was like every Sunday.  So we 
had a pretty good Christian upbringing.  And I think later on, having that woven into our family 
held us together when things started to go, health-wise, started to go upside down.  That was a 
very valuable part of our bringing up too.   
10:50   In my senior year in high school, I asked Dad if I could--at Christmas break--if I could go 
with him on one of his jobs.  And he said. “Sure.”  So I had two weeks of hanging with the guys.  
And my brother already was working for Dad.  And I think the job I went with on Dad, the first 
one was, I never even got to the job site.  I ended up being the chief cook and bottle washer 
while he was at work.  So that was kind of a letdown, but I got to be by the guys anyway so that 
was ok.  But then in the spring, when school was done, then I went on the first job with him.  
And  it was kind of a crude awakening.  We’re standing, looking at this framework, this red iron 
and Dad says, “Are you going to be a ground man or are you going to be an ironworker?”  And I 
said, “Well, I’ll be an ironworker.”  He says, “Well, get up there.”  I looked around for a ladder 
and there was no ladder.  And I said, “Well, how am I gonna get up there?”  And he showed me 
one time how to grab the column and walk up the column until you get to the, to the purlins and 
climb up there and walk the web up on the bent and upper beam.  And that’s what I did.  And I 
was amazed that I could do that.  And from that point on, we just got better at working together, 
my brother and I.  Not too bad for a couple of guys who fought like cats and dogs when we were 
farming but we learned to rely on each other because…   
13:06   My brother Larry and I, we could walk right on top of the steel and carry the next, carry 
the next purlin up and lay it in place.  And in order to do that, you had to have a good teammate.  
‘Cause if one of you slipped, you had to know exactly what to do so you wouldn’t drag each 
other into the hole or take a fall.  I think back on it now and we did have a few close calls.  I 
think everybody does.  You do things that get you in trouble without even realizing you’re 
heading that way.  I was up on top of a scaffolding, this was in White Pine, Michigan.  We were 
working on the wheelhouse for the big bucket that went down the mine shaft.  And they would 
fill it and bring it to the surface.  So we were working on the wheelhouse which had a 60 foot 
eave height.  And I climbed up off of the scaffolding onto the roof.  We had the sheet steel on 
already.  And it was early in the morning and I was walking kind of at a diagonal over to the 
ridge into the gable end at the same time, kind of side-stepping.  And I stepped off of the dry part 
of the roof and got into the morning moisture and frost.  And before I realized it, I’m sliding 
backwards.  So I laid down flat and grabbed the ribs on the steel with both of my hands and was 
trying to get a foot stuck on the screw heads, just off the sliding end.  Ever so slowly, I just kept 
sliding--and I got down to the edge of the eave and the lower part of my legs were hanging over 
already.  And I looked over my shoulder and all I could see down below was frozen ground and I 
figured, either I’m dead or broke up really bad.  And about the time I come to that conclusion, 
this big ol’ arm reaches up [David gets choked up a little], reached across off of the scaffolding 
and that was on the gable end.  And he yanked me over there.  And--before I could even take a 
breath, I got my butt chewed big time.  And that was Dad.  And he said, “What were you 
thinking?”  And I says, “Dad, I guess I wasn’t.”  So he just let it go at that.  And…   
16:29   One other time we were working on an airplane hangar which wasn’t very high.  Just the 
way things happen, you’ve got to be thinking all the time, every minute of the day because 
you’re working high in the air and--stupid mistakes get people killed.  We were laying the sheet 
steel and, as we were doing that, we would lay the insulation and staple it together and then lay 
the next sheet steel on top of that.  And so on and so forth.  And, ahead of the insulation, we 
always had a plank that you could walk on while you were stapling the insulation together.  And 
at that time--I think I was chewing tobacco, or had a cold, I don’t remember which one.  But I 
just took a spit over my right shoulder and thought nothing of it.  Got up to move and I stepped 
from the sheet steel onto the plank and that’s where the spit had landed.  And it had froze.  My 
foot hit that and both feet went out from under me, but luckily I straddled the plank.  Dad and the 
owner of the hangar were walking below--good timing--right at the same time.  And Dad 
hollered, “Headache.”  That’s usually what they holler when somebody drops something from up 
above.  Well, here it was me, I was dropping.  But luckily, like I said, I straddled the plank and 
Dad hollered “Headache!” And I said, “BS.”  And I said, “Butt ache.”  LAUGHTER   He looked 
up at me and just shook his head.  But that was was lucky.  If, you know, if I wouldn’t have 
straddled the plank, I would have been on the concrete.  And that was probably the two scariest 
things that ever happened to me working on the steel.  And sometimes I wonder why the good 
Lord was picking on me, but I think he was trying to train me.  LAUGHS   [So where was that, 
with the hangar, where you were working there?]  I think that was in Marquette.   
19:03  We were worked Marquette, Ishpeming, Peshtigo.  No, I take it back.  It was Peshtigo 
because we were crisscrossing the Wisconsin border in that little tip.  Yeah, it was Peshtigo.  But 
the other one, like I said, was at White Pine.  We worked out of Ontonagon.  We stayed in 
Bergland, Michigan, when we were working White Pine.  But in a year’s time, as far as I can 
remember, we probably had six different jobs.  We subcontracted out of Iron Mountain through 
W.B. Thompson Company.  And we built a electrical--I forget the name of it now but it was a 
building.  In fact, I’ve seen a truck with that name on it, here, not too long ago.  So that electric 
company is still in business in Iron Mountain.  I’m just, I’m not bringing up the name right now 
but--that was one of the buildings we did.  [This is likely M.J. Electric, headquartered in Iron 
Mountain, Michigan.] 
20:26  We had some crazy guys working with us—it was just amazing.  A lot of the boys were 
right from this area that we knew, or knew their families.  And that worked out real well. We 
made a good team.  Everybody was looking out for each other all the time.  I worked for, maybe 
a year and a half, I don’t remember exactly now, but I remember thinking, you know--they 
always say if you decide what you’re going to do for the rest of your life, look at the fruit on the 
tree before you decide to go that way.  And I remember thinking--when my hands were numb 
and I couldn’t pick up a screw, couldn’t pick up a drill; a lot of work you had to do without 
gloves on because you couldn’t, like screwing the sheeting down, you couldn’t hardly hold the 
screws with gloves on--I remember being that cold and, at the age of18, between 18 and 19, 
having hemorrhoids from sitting on the steel.  And I’m thinking, this is the fruit on the tree.  And 
I more or less right then decided I’m going in some other direction.  LAUGHS   And there’s 
ironworkers that have been doing this all of their lives, so I kind of wimped out.  From that point 
on, I did the next best thing in my life.  I joined the Marine Corps.  LAUGHS    Another rude 
awakening. 
22:20    [You said you worked with some crazy guys…guys around here.  Can you tell about 
some of them?]  Well, one of them was Happy Hudak.  And his family hailed right from 
Ashland.  And--hmm…just a fun guy to be around.  And he was a short, little, dark haired guy 
and he could climb steel like he was born to do it.  And a good guy to get along with.  Very 
reliable.  And another fellow was Dave Tapani.  And I know my dad and his dad worked 
together for a lot of years.  And that’s the thing, once you’re in that venue, you run on to people 
repeatedly depending on where the job is and who was hired for.  But you’d run into your old 
friends repeatedly.  And I seen that trend going on there.  Well, and Dave’s dad was Rudy and 
they lived over on Highway 13 about five miles south of Ashland.  Another one was Jack Hudak, 
er, Jack Shubat.  Now these are the guys who were on the crew in that year, year and a half that I 
worked there.  He lived just up--south of Ashland on 112.  Still lives out here.  And all of these 
guys were probably 5-8 years older than me at that time so they’re pretty old now.  Some of them 
started young.  [Would you spell that?]  Shubat.  [Spelling confirmed through White Pages for 
Jack J. Shubat.]  I don’t know.  All I remember at that time was he had a great sense of humor 
and--the guys were always trying to get me lined up with girls. I was just 18, between 18 and 19 
then and wasn’t much interested.  But they were, I do remember one thing though—we, at night 
we liked to go out and have a few brewskies.  And after working hard all day, a lot of times out 
in the cold, two brewskies and I’d be gone.  That would be enough for me as soon as that warm 
air hit me, especially after eating supper.  And, you know, a lot of times we’d go out and eat 
steak.  We ate real well.  We had to because you burned it up the next day.  I remember one time 
we went from--we were staying in Bergland, working at White Pine--and we drove back to 
Wakefield because we heard there was a wedding dance going on.  Still don’t know whose it 
was.  But we crashed it, got three sheets to the wind.  We’re on the way back to Bergland and we 
were riding in Happy Hudak’s--it was a Ford that had the electronic trunk and the electronic 
convertible and pure white, just a beautiful car--and we got about half way back and got a flat 
tire.  Well, it’s darker than the inside of a cat outside and everybody’s pretty gassed up.  So we 
slept there until daybreak and got up woke up, and got the trunk open, and got the tire changed.  
We got back to Bergland for breakfast.  And we walked into the little restaurant that we went to 
every morning.  Dad was already finished eating and--we had just pounding headaches—and 
Dad got up and he said, “Anybody isn’t on the roof when the whistle blows can head ‘er down 
the road.”  And he looks at my brother Larry and I and says, “Boys, you’ll be the first ones to 
go.”  And we skipped breakfast that morning.  We were on the roof when the whistle blew.  And 
talk about a long day.  It wasn’t worth the party.  LAUGHTER   That was one of Dad’s sayings 
too, that “If you can’t do it, you can’t stay.” 
27:47   And I did see him have to fire a couple of guys and it wasn’t, it wasn’t a nice thing to see 
but they just couldn’t hack it.  Hmm.  One feller was given--well, he was new on the job--and he 
was given the simple job of cutting out gusset plates with a propane torch, or acetylene torch 
rather.  And he was doing that next to the work shack and, Dad came back from the job site, and 
here the guy had the acetylene torch set wrong so it was smoking black.  And he was kinda 
cutting half way through it and he was trying to beat the, the gusset plates with the back of the 
torch.  And there were flames coming out of the torch all over the place.  Gosh!  Dad give him a 
warning, “You know, there’s a $300 torch head shot.”  The next job he gave him was going over 
to the job site with a wire brush and a spud wrench that would fit the anchor bolts.  And the job 
was to take away the brush and clean the cement residue out of the threads out of the anchor 
bolts.  And run the nuts on and run them back off to make sure that they were ready to go, so that 
when the red iron got there, we were ready to stand it up, that there was no hold up with a crane 
sitting there.  And we went to set the first, the first bent, which is the column on each side and… 
then a joist, two joist which make a bent, and two bents to a bay.  So we’re setting up the first 
bent and we couldn’t get the lug nut, we couldn’t get the anchor bolts on.  Well, it actually--one 
anchor bolt was twisted off and one the nut wouldn’t go on, so we had to quick brush that and 
get it anchored down.  Well, that fella there got his walking papers because what he was doing 
was just running the nut on and taking that wrench and putting the pipe on it and trying to run the 
anchor bolts down and it was twisting them off.  And it just caused a, it cost a lot of dollars to 
have that crane sitting there.  Not only that, it was dangerous for the guys working it too.  
Everything was kind of in turmoil.  So, yeah, he got his walking papers and--it ain’t a good thing 
to see.  You can’t keep somebody on that can’t listen, because down the line somebody will get 
hurt or get killed. 
31:10   [When you mentioned red iron…  What does that mean?]  That’s your structural steel.  
That’s just the framework.  I’m forgetting my nomenclature on the stuff, but two columns and 
two joists make one frame.  And that’s called a bent.  Two of those make a bay.  So if you’ve got 
four bays in a building, you’re going to have--eight or nine bents?  Two, four, six, eight…  [But 
the term red iron just refers to a girder or the length of….]  Any of your frame steel, which would 
be a girder, which would be purlin, any of that stuff that ties all the frame together.  It’s all 
painted with Rust-Oleum paint, which is mostly reddish brown.    
32:23    [So when you were picking up the trade, was there any apprenticeship or you just sort of 
jumped in there?]  Yeah [LAUGHS] you just jumped in.  It was definitely on-the-job training  
and baptism by fire mostly.  [Did you have a card then?  Did you work out of a local?]  I had a 
tinnerman’s card [i.e. a member of the Sheet Metal Worker’s International Association, a.k.a. 
“tinman” or “tin basher”].  I couldn’t get a ironworkers card until I did an apprenticeship.  But 
they could get me in under a sheet metal men’s permit--and that’s how I got started,  which is 
kinda crazy but it got me in there.  We had--well, let’s see--from there we went,  we went to the 
Marine Corps.  Dad had asked me why I wanted to join the Marine Corps, and I was speaking 
out of no knowledge.  I was speaking just from my heart.  And at that time the Vietnam War was 
in full bloom.  And I never gave it that much thought.  There was so much controversy and bad 
information coming back to the United States--if any information or lack of.  And Dad said, 
“Why the Marine Corps?”  And I said, “Well, Dad, if I’m going to go into any service, I’m going 
into the best.”  Not realizing that the best also puts you right in the front.  I guess I didn’t think 
that far ahead.  He says, “Yeah but why, why do you even want to do this?”  And I said, “Dad”--
and this was on a road trip coming back home.  And I knew, I knew he wanted my brother and I 
to be ironworkers.  And carry on the family--I don’t know if it even a tradition--but carry on 
what he had taught us.  And--I had made up my mind then--I’m not spending the rest of my life 
doing the steel construction, but I was very proud of, to have been involved in it and be able to 
do it.  That was kind of a--you know, you’re up in the air and looking down at little people 
walking down below and--it gives you a sense of pride that you can do that kind of thing and be 
part of a good team and have them, have your team members, trust you.  That was the other good 
thing about that.  But as far as going into the Marine Corps, I told Dad, “Dad, I’ve had a good 
life and it’s time to just pay back some.”  And being a country guy, he could understand that.  
Dad was always very patriotic.   
36:17   [Let’s talk about your Dad a little bit.  Do you know where your ancestors came from or 
how they got here to Northern Wisconsin?  Could we even start further back?]  Well, my 
Grandfather, Odin, lived at White River Hill.  Even farther back than that, his Dad was Gottfried 
and they came from Norway, of course.  They were Norwegian.   And I didn’t know much about 
Great Grandpa, but Granddad Odin lived on White River Hill on Highway 112. Had a little, he 
was a Pentecostal minister and he had a congregation with a lot of local people.  Some of the 
names that pop into my head were Hegstroms and Andersons and-- Rita, can you remember any 
more?  [Asks his wife.  She say, “What was that”?]  The people involved in White River 
Church?  Well, there was a lot of them anyways throughout the years.  And that was my very 
early childhood.  I can remember that.  I went to one service that sticks out in my mind in that 
little white church.  We had a Black minister that particular Sunday.  And the stage in that church 
was, like, one step up was just a six inch rise and then it had the old piano on it, and the pulpit. 
This Black minister had everybody just praising the Lord and actually it was kinda scary.  A lot 
of folks crying and weeping and--they were making noise.  They were making noise unto the 
Lord.  But being just a little kid, it was kind of neat at the same time but it was kinda scary too.  I 
thought to myself.  Some of these people are really suffering here.  And that’s about all I can 
remember about that.  But we still have the paperwork and stuff from the church and--the Church 
is long gone now.  I did salvage some of the ceiling tile and wall tile and some of the things out 
of it to do my addition here on the place.    
40:02   That one time, Rita and I had it in our minds to make the church property a family 
reunion place.  And by that time, the church was already sinking into the ground.  The wooden 
floor was rotted away but it could still be salvaged but it would take some money and some time.  
Well, back in our early years of marriage, we didn’t have any money.  We had kids.  We had 
diapers.   No money.  And so my sister Jody sent letters to all of our relatives and we sent out 
about 40 letters and got not one response back.  So that kind of squashed that whole idea.  So 
eventually, the old church went, got sold to a guy for the cost of the taxes and the property was 
such a small piece of property that you couldn’t build on it.  The guy that bought it was burning 
brush one day and it burned the church down.  LAUGHS  And that ended the church.   
41:27   Then getting back to our heritage, then my mom’s folks hailed from down around 
Greenwood and Thorpe, Wisconsin.  Grandpa was a horse trader, horse farmer.  And a big burly 
barrel-chested guy.  Had a great big bushy eyebrows and I always thought that was pretty cool 
until I grew ‘em.  LAUGHS  And Grandma was a stout farm lady.  Had a big, she had a big ol’ 
bulge on her right arm, on the backside of her bicep where she had been bitten by a horse.  Back 
in the day, you got whatever treatment there was and apparently there wasn’t much.  And it just 
grew into a big lump on her arm but I remember that about her.  And she was ambidextrous.  
LAUGHS If you were being bad, she could really smack you with either hand just as well.  
LAUGHS  And a lot of times she would, she would feint with a right and give you a left, but she 
was a kind hearted person.  But stern.  And Grandpa was stern.  Both had very good senses of 
humor.  [What were their names?]  Grandpa’s name was Fred, Francis, and Grandma was 
Charlotte.  Years later--well they lived in a house that had no electricity and I can still smell the 
kerosene lamps, and the wood stove--and we were there in the wintertime, getting close to 
Christmas, I remember looking in their windowsill and I thought it was so cool.  I was 
probably…maybe 6 or 7 at that time.  They had these little Christmas tree ornaments in the 
window that were kind of like a fuller brush texture to ‘em with little dots of glue at the ends of 
the branches and they looked so real to me that I thought that was really neat.  And I heard from 
out in the kitchen, “Don’t touch those.”  So they were still neat but had to look at them from a 
distance.  LAUGHS   I think a year or so later, my folks decided that Grandma and Gramps had 
to let the farm go.  They were totally destitute and the house had, other than wood heat, had no 
heat.  So they came to live with us.  And that was great.  That was great having them there.  And 
we just moved over and made room for ‘em.  It was good having ‘em in our house.  And then a 
couple of years later, one of my aunts from Oregon decided they needed a warmer climate so 
they moved them to Oregon after much turmoil and sadness.  Well, that’s where they ended up 
dying, was out there.  So eleven years later, my brother and I talked my folks into giving us 
airfare to go out there.  And eleven years later, we went to visit Grandpa.  Grandma had already 
passed on.  Grandpa was in a nursing home in Medford, Oregon.  So my brother and I ended up 
out there, found the nursing home.  We stayed with the same aunt and uncle that took them out 
there.  And we went to see Grandpa and here we are, 17-18 years old and Grandpa recognizes us 
as soon as we walk in.  While he was in the nursing home, he had cancer on one leg and they 
amputated that.  But we got to have lunch with him and had a great visit.  And my brother came 
back home and, well,  . . .  
46:35  We knocked around Oregon for a little while and we were running short on money so I 
got a job working for Edward Hines Lumber Company.  And earned enough money to ship Larry 
back home, my older brother, and I stayed on until almost Christmastime.  And that was a good 
experience, working in that huge lumbar company.  And like our lumber companies around here, 
they’ll have a big log out in the front with their name on it or some logo on it or something.  And 
I thought ours were pretty big logs.  They were like four foot through the middle.  But the one 
they had in front of Edward Hines Lumber Company, it was more like 16 feet through the 
middle.  I stood on the end of it and held my hand as high as I could with my fingers touching 
the heart of the log.  That’s--it was just tremendous.  And see these big logs come and start 
spinning on the lathe.  They would spin and throw cold air throughout the whole building, they 
would fan so much.  And it was tremendous just watching that happening.  I don’t know how 
many thousands of feet they would get off of one log but it was a lot.  And I remember one time-
-I got along with the foreman pretty well.  I was doing all of the back breaking scrub work that 
nobody else would do, which was ok.  I was used to that.  He put me in one room where all of 
the conveyor belts converged and it was, it was like 6 feet deep with saw dust.  And it smelled 
like a calf pen.  I mean it was, it had been in there for a long time.  And he sent me in there to 
clean it up.  I looked at it and I thought, “This ain’t so bad.”  There were conveyors running 
every which way.  All you gotta do is put it on a conveyor and it’s gone.  It’s not like you have to 
load it and haul it and take it someplace.  By the end of my shift that night, I was sweeping the 
floor in there.  And the foreman came in and just shook his head.  And he said, “I have put I 
don’t know how many guys in this room and you are the first one that ever stayed and did it.  All 
the rest of ‘em said ‘I’m outa here.’  That’s amazing.”  He said, “Where do you want to be 
placed?”  And I said, “I want to work on the green chain.”  And up until that point, I had cleaned 
under the green chain, pulling all the bark and slabs and everything that falls underneath it--
which was a mean job because it was too low to stand up under and it was too high to, it was just 
high enough that everything you did was on your hands and knees were just kind of half bent so 
it was hard on the back.  But I got that done.  Well, he put me on the green chain.  And at that 
time, I was chewing tobacco.  Well, on the green chain, you’re pulling veneer and you’ll have 
sometimes one size that you pull on each side, like a 36 inch piece or a, sometimes two sizes.  
You’ll have 18 on one side and a 36 on the other side.  And you’d have a cart on each side of you 
and that’s your job, is to pull your size veneer when it comes down the conveyor.  That was 
gravy work as far as I was concerned.  I loved it.  But I had one bad thing.  I was chewing 
tobacco and I never, never could swallow tobacco and I would salivate so bad.  And--but 
working on a green chain, you can spit wherever you want to.  Well, I was spitting on veneer as 
it went by.  And the foreman came over to me one night and he says, “You know, that knotter is 
really, really punching out more knots than it should be.  This stuff doesn’t have that many knots.  
You’re going to have to quit spitting on that veneer.”  LAUGHTER   And what it would do it 
would chop out every place I spit and put a plug in there. Well then it would downgrade the 
quality of the veneer.  And so I had to quit chewing tobacco.  So that was the end of my tobacco 
habit.  LAUGHS   [In other words the punch on the knotter was hooked to a photosensitive 
device that mistook the dark tobacco stain for a knot in the wood.] 
51:15   [Can up tell…hmm…when you moved here and your Dad…  Could you tell when and 
where he was born and how he got into the trade or what you know about him as an ironworker?]  
Dad was born on White River Hill again in 1925.  And Grandpa had a little farm going there, 
too, so he could kinda see the trend.  And Grandpa also built his own or made his own cement 
blocks and built his dairy barn.  Probably one of the first ones in the area that actually had a 
cement foundation.  By the time I was old enough to recollect anything, that barn was long gone 
so I never did get to see it.  But I did get to see Grandpa making cement blocks and that carried 
on into Dad making cement blocks too.  And the place we’re on right now, still has a few of the 
blocks around here.  Actually the addition on the back of the garage is cement blocks.  The 
whole garage is cinder blocks but the, the addition in the back is cement blocks and that’s some 
of the ones that Dad and Grandpa had made.  And Dad bought this place.  Well, to get back to…  
After Dad became old enough to get out on his own, he hitchhiked out to the West Coast and 
went to work as a welder in the ship yards.  And jumping way ahead, that ultimately led to Dad’s 
death with asbestos poisoning.  All those years, he carried asbestos in his body and eventually it 
caused cancer and took him out of the picture.  After he came back from the ship yard work out 
there . . . 
 
54:02    Another name popped into my head too.  Willy Butler was another guy that did Dad did 
steel with.  Ross Watson was another one, but that was some of the older guys that--I worked 
with Ross one time at one of the jobs.  But those two fellas, Dad worked American Bridge with 
and they worked the grain elevators up in Superior.  Now Ross was on a job, I don’t remember if 
it was in Michigan, but I wasn’t in the construction then, but he was injured on the job.  A crane 
operator had, through miscommunication on the walkies or radios or whatever they used then, he 
had two-blocked his pulley on the crane and snapped it.  And it came down and clubbed Ross in 
the shoulder, broke his shoulder.  And a little bit over it would have just smashed him, but 
anyway it was kind of a glancing blow but it broke his shoulder.  [The block came down?  That’s 
what came down?]  The pulley came down.  [The pulley…yeah.]  The pulley.  Yup.  And that--
eventually when Ross was on the mending stage, he ended up getting cancer--and that took him 
out of the picture.  But I do remember Dad going and sitting with him and, you know, just being 
by him.  That’s all you can do when somebody is dying with cancer.  That’s all you can do is be 
with them.  Even if you don’t say anything, just be there.  And that’s probably one of the hardest 
things there is to do.  [I did it with my Mom for a long time.]  Yeah.  You can’t talk about the 
future because there isn’t any.  You can talk about the past but it’s bittersweet.  So you just sit 
there.  Cribbage comes in real handy.  LAUGHS   
56:48   Well, Dad worked in the American Bridge Union for a number of years.  Now this was 
before.  This was before us kids were old enough to really know too much about that.  And, you 
know, he’d tell us about it in retrospect, but climbing very, very high steel and doing that, you 
know?  But I think that was, if not the way he got started in steelwork, it was part of it.  It just 
moved on to doing his own, doing his own business.  I remember Dad hiring a tax man, L. 
Peterson, to help him figure out his taxes when he started our own company, the Olby Erection 
Company.  When Dad came home on the weekends from one of the job sites, he would spend the 
whole weekend in the little office out here doing taxes, figuring out how to do taxes.  And I think 
that was harder on him than, than actually doing the work or being the boss.  Figuring out the 
taxes and coming out at the end of the year.  And I know just from what I seen at this place that 
we didn’t get rich doing that.   
58:26    [When he worked in the ship yards, do you know where that was?]  It was in California 
some place.  [I know they had them in San Francisco, ship yards.]  I never knew much about 
that.  He never talked about any of it.  [I have an old friend who started in the ship yards in San 
Francisco in the late 30s and he lived with asbestos.]  Yeah, it was a common thing.  All the 
pipes are wrapped with it.  And now if they find one pipe with it, they call in the clean up team 
and, you know.  They’ll have special suits and special masks and probably air tanks on them and 
everything else.  And find one ceiling tile in a high school or something that has it.  LAUGHS 
59:18    [What can you tell me about this song here, “Ironworker Blues”?]  Well, you know--and 
after you and I talked a number of times, I got looking in our closet.  There’s a book.  Dad had 
written more songs than I even knew.  Unfortunately, they don’t have any music with them but 
there’s like 20 some songs in there that.  This particular one I got to be part of, whether I wanted 
to or not.  That’s the way we did things.  LAUGHS  Back to the old, “If you can’t do it you can’t 
stay.”  LAUGHS   So Dad had a little band here, well, over the years, he probably had two or 
three different ones as people would join and then as life went on, something would take them 
away.  But it was amazing how many people would come out of the closet that were talented that 
played different instruments or had great voices and just giving them an opportunity to be part of 
this.  They would just show up.  I remember one guy came here had a, he was playing a French 
horn and he was good on it.  But Dad said, “Well, we’re kind of doing the country western theme 
and a French horn just doesn’t quite get it.”  LAUGHS   “But can you sing?”  And he said, “No, 
I don’t sing.”  And Dad says, “I’m sorry but you’re welcome to stay and you’re welcome to 
come back anytime you want to but we just don’t have a place for a French horn.”  LAUGHS  
Let him down pretty easy.  We had a lot of people like that that would show up and some of 
them would claim they could sing and some of them couldn’t.  But every once in a while, they’d 
come along and be great on the piano or great on the guitar or do all of them.  [Accordion too?]  
A little bit on the accordion, yeah.  Dad made me learn two songs on the accordion and…my 
heart wasn’t in it.  You can’t play any instrument or sing if your heart wasn’t it in. Mine wasn’t.  
So I struggled through two songs.  Back then I was looking at all the accordion players I knew 
were either doing the oompa-pa polkas or schottisches or--and non-stop.  And I’m watching 
these little old guys up on the stage, pumping that according, and going for 4-5 hours straight…  
I thought, that’s no place for me.  I don’t want to do that.  LAUGHS   And like I said, my heart 
wasn’t in it so I just let go of it. I practiced enough to learn two songs and enough to keep Dad 
off my back and that was about it.  And I let that go.  But I did the drums a little bit and learned 
to play harmonica…  So I had my little niche in there.  
1:02:48    But getting back to this song, we did this right in the garage on this place.  And we had 
4-5 people in the group then that [Asks his wife:  Do you remember who was in the group when 
we did that?  DOG BARKING]   Brian’s here, he’s excited [David’s son-in-law and daughter 
arrive, exciting the dog].  Rita, was Butch and Junior still in then?  R:  I believe so.  D:  Yeah, 
because Butch was doing the rhythm guitar and I think his brother, Junior, was still alive.  Junior 
sang like Johnny Horton.  Had a great, great voice.  And I think he was only like 56 or something 
when he was working out in Oregon or California.  And dropped dead right at work.  Heart 
attack.  Way to go.  It was like bam, down he went and that was it.  But at that time, I’m thinking 
that Butch Green, his real name was Alvin, he played rhythm bass and Junior, which was Frank 
Green, played lead guitar and sang like Johnny Horton.  I mean, he did “Whispering Pines” and 
“The Mansion You Stole” and all those songs, right to a T.  We went out and did shows for the 
fair and different occasions.  He was a big hit.  He did real well.  And Butch mastered the Johnny 
Cash type rhythm on his guitar so whenever we did some of Johnny Cash’s stuff, like “Folsom 
Prison” or any of those, Butch could just knock that right out.   He was great.  
1:05:36     But getting back to this song--and there was probably two or three other people 
involved that my old memory ain’t bringing it up right now--but right in the garage, repeatedly, 
repeatedly, repeatedly, we did this song over and over and over again until Dad thought it was 
good enough.  And I think this particular song, he only had like 125 copies made.  And one other 
one he did was “Beyond those City Lights” and “Go Then” was the flip side of it.  And he only 
had like 25 of those made.  And we’ve lost them someplace.  I know he got a lot away.  All the 
taverns around this area had them on their jukeboxes and that was pretty novel.  But somehow or 
another, we ended up with not one copy of that one that I can find.  But this one here, actually I 
can say I was honored to live part of this, and suffered through some of it.  And I had a feeling, 
you know, [begins to read lyrics from “Iron Worker Blues”] “You sit way up there in the sky and 
you watch birds go flying by,” and all of that’s true.  You do.  And sometimes you wonder why 
things have turned out the way they are and why you’re there.  And if you ponder on it when 
your hands are cold and shivering, yeah, you can get the blues pretty easy.  End of the day, 
you’re about froze to death: “You wait for the boss to say come down” and  [reads but doesn’t 
speak the next line: “You wait for a job that’s on the ground.”]  
1:07:19    Once in a while you do get a job that’s on the ground. We had a job, in between jobs I 
guess you could say, it was a wintertime job and they needed to replace the—now this was back 
in White Pine--in the wheel house that we built, they had these big cable drums that would wind 
up the cable that brought the bucket up out of the mine shaft.  And on each cable drum—I mean 
these things were huge--on each cable drum there was a sleeve that went on ‘em that was 
grooved.  So they would start the cable out in the grooves and it would make the cable travel and 
follow itself over so it would wind evenly.  And we had—I think the millwrights were on strike 
so we kind of snuck in there and got this job.  It paid very well but, boy, we ruined a lot of 
clothes with that millwright oil.  Oh man that stuff would stink.  Drill oil.  And that was our one 
on the ground job that I can remember that paid real well.  It wasn’t that bad of a job.  It was 
warm.  Mostly cutting torching, getting the old sleeves off and getting ready for the new ones.  
And that was probably a three week job and that was--we had a deadline on that one--so it was 
kinda under the gun.  We had to move on it.   
1:09:03  Like any place, you get paid every two weeks.  “You wait for pay day to roll around.” 
And by that time you’re, by the time you pay everything off, you’re pretty broke.  But back then, 
my brother and I were making $5.10 an hour, and we were making good money.  [I was making 
a buck and a quarter an hour then.]  Yup.  And like down at the mill in Mellon, it was $1.33 after 
you were there a year.  But back then, gas was like 32 cents a gallon.  You didn’t need a big pile 
of money to make ends meet either so $5.10 an hour was pretty nice.  And then we had to pay 
our union dues out of that and constantly wearing out clothes and trying to buy a better grade of 
tools and paying off the bar bill and food expenses and--lucky we had Mom home here to take 
care of our clothes.  Unfortunately, looking back at it, I don’t think I ever left any change in my 
pocket even but she always took care of us.  Anyway, that was waiting “for pay day to roll 
around.”  So it hasn’t changed much.   
1:10:33   “You hook a choker around the beam” is the start of the next verse here.  And that’s to 
swing them into place.  A choker is a cable with a loop on each end.  One loop hooks to the hook 
on the crane, the headache ball on the crane.  And basically all you’re going to do is putting a 
slip knot on the beam.  If you don’t get it right in the center and the crane starts to lift the beam 
and it will slide to one side or the other and possibly drop out.  And that’s what the next verse 
here, “The choker slips and the pusher screams.”  The pusher is the guy on the ground, usually 
highballing the crane operator.  So the crane operator has to set it back down and he goes to 
center the choker again and re-lift it.  And having someone barking at you could make you mean, 
or just having to re-do things--that gets at you after a while.  [This refers to the lyric “It’s sure 
enough to make you mean.”]  “You put your spud wrench in the hole.”  Now your spud wrench 
is a long wrench with like a rat tail end on it so you can align the red iron and put a bolt through 
it.  Because most of this, all the red iron is prefabricated and a lot of times it doesn’t line up and 
you, you know, when you’re stretching this building, sometimes the whole framework to make 
that one hole fit, that helps square the building up a lot of the times.  Sometimes the hole is just 
in the wrong place and then you gotta bring a torch up and make your own hole.  But that’s what 
the spud wrench is.  You stick it in the hole and pry the two holes together and then the next hole 
over, you stick a bolt in it and tighten it down.  So you’re doing all of this with two hands, so 
you’re holding the spud wrench with your shoulder, holding it in place, and you stick a bolt in 
the hole.  And for some reason or another, the nut doesn’t want to spin on ‘er like it should so 
you holler for somebody to “hold the roll.”  And that’s what that means.  And he holds that bolt 
from rolling while you’re running the nut on.  And usually that . . . 
1:13:14   . . . Well, going back to my first duty, on my first job, was to sit outside the work shack.  
I had a bag of bolts on one side and a bag of nuts on the other side.  And I would thread nuts and 
bolts together.  Thread nuts and bolts together.  Thread nuts and bolts together and throw them in 
another bucket.  And that’s the ones you’d take up in your work apron so you’d have both parts 
together.  And I did that like for two days.  I was ready to go crazy but I made it through that 
tough test. 
01:13:56    Now we’re talking about, “You put your spud wrench in the hole.”  Ok.  That’s what 
we did.  Someone hollers, “Hold the roll.”  Stop that bolt from spinning.  Tighten it up.  So 
you’re doing all of this with your shoulder and two hands and you still need help.  Luckily, 
there’s somebody close to you that can skid ‘er over and give you a hand with that, while you’re 
hanging there.  And the next verse here, “You take the rod wrench from your hip.”  Now you’re 
doing a different kind of steel construction here.  You’re rod tying.  You’re tying rod together, 
reinforcing rod.  And to get this to stay in place while they’re pouring concrete over it, you gotta 
wire-tie it.  I got fairly decent at it so I could get it done.  There was guys that were just totally on 
fire on this.  They could tie four times faster than me.  And what you would do is you had a roll 
of wire in a carrier on your hip.  And your rod wrench was your side cutter pliers.  And you’d cut 
a strand of wire, wrap it around the intersection of the two reinforcing rods and you’d give it a 
couple of wraps and then you would twist it so it would stay in place.  And as you’re twisting it, 
to keep one side of the twist from breaking, you always had to pull up on it and twist, pull up on 
it and twist.  And what he’s talking about here is if your rod wrench slips while you’re pulling up 
on that, you’re pulling it up hard and it would come up and whack yourself in the chin.  And “It’s 
enough to make you quit.”  LAUGHS  So you just keep doing it with your lip smarting.  
LAUGHS  Or you drop that wrench down the hole too and that’s a goner because you can’t get 
through the reinforcing rod to get down and get it.  It’s gone.  So you try not to drop that one.  
“Seems like you can’t never gain.  It’s either got to snow or rain.  Where you get so cold you feel 
no pain.  And you get them ironworkers blues.” Got that cold.   Lived it, did it.  Part of the 
reason I joined the Marine Corps.  LAUGHS 
01:16:30   “They let you work eight hours a day.”  See, there’s guys that would work longer than 
that.  But, belonging to the union, you’ve got to watch ‘er.  So sometimes it feels like you’re 
limited to where you have a little bit of energy you want to burn up yet and you’re getting to a 
point in the job where you want to finish what you’re doing, move on to something the next day.  
But you still have to punch out when the whistle blows.  So then here you are. “But you’re so 
darn broke you gotta stay.”  On and on we go.  “On Friday night you’re on your way, with dirty 
clothes and only half your pay.  You know darn well what Ma’s gonna say.”  Yup.  I had ‘em.  I 
had them ironworkers’ blues.  I was only there for a  year and a half.  LAUGHS   [It’s a fantastic 
song and you did a really great job.  LAUGHTER ]  “Ironworkers Lament” too…I tell you what.  
[Yeah, that was another great song.]  That was great.  [That’s another thing.  That’s a good song.  
I haven’t yet found out who this guy is.  I’ve got a couple of angles I need to pursue.]  Well, I tell 
you what, that guy would have fit into that group here, right now.  He had a great voice.  He had 
a great voice.  [A little bantering ensues as David’s daughter and son-in-law are leaving.] 
1:18:20   [Well, the last thing I wanted to know is…  You told me that you were one of the 
performers in that…]  Oh yeah, I was the guy, if I belonged to an orchestra, I don’t know what 
instrument would make that noise--or a band.  LAUGHS  In this case it was the acetylene tank or 
the oxygen tank on the acetylene torches.  Dad wanted a sound that sounded like somebody 
pounding on a beam, driving a wedge, or driving it into place but he didn’t want it in synch with 
the rhythm of the song.  He wanted it to sound natural.  Probably the only time in my life I kept 
falling into rhythm and he was getting so mad at me.  LAUGHS   “No, we don’t want it in 
rhythm,” he would say.  All right, all right, all right.  So they would start the whole thing over 
again because Dave was screwing up, you know?  And I had to concentrate on, you know, on not 
going in rhythm.  This is kind of funny because all the time Dad’s performing and running the 
little band.  He’s always going, snapping his fingers or doing something to snap his wrists to 
keep us in rhythm and then all of a sudden [LAUGHS] he wants to go the other way and don’t 
get in rhythm.  It was a struggle.  It was just funny.  That was so many good years and so many 
faces and people that have, jump into my mind, intermittently, and a lot of them I can’t 
remember the names anymore.  There were so, so many.  And a lot of them were just neighbor 
people through the Mason, Ashland, Bayfield County area that would just come to the barn 
dances and, you know, after you’ve had a couple of sarsaparilla sometimes they’d get enough 
courage to get up on the stage and they’d blow us away.  It was amazing what they could do.  
Like all these little band members searching for a band.  They’d come out of the woodwork and 
it was totally amazing. 
[I think I have what I needed which was great storytelling.  Love the detail.]
