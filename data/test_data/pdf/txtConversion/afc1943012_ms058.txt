James
April 25, 1944 Dr. Willis Laurence James 39 Chestnut Street, S.W. Atlanta, Georgia
Dear Dr. James,
Congratulations on the Folk Festival number of the Peachite, which was sent me last
month. The illustrations are most striking and the whole is a valuable contribution to our
knowledge of Negro folk music.
Sincerely, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge, Archive of American Folk Song
