[0:00] LK: Hello, and thank you so much for taking part of these oral histories for the Library of 
Congress. Can I ask you to introduce yourself? 
  
SB: Sure. My full name is Saraswathy Battar, B-A-T-T-A-R. I am a physician who is board certified in 
internal medicine, geriatrics, hospice and palliative care medicine. I did my basic medical school 
training, MBBS, from India. Also finished residency in OB-GYN in India. Came to United States of 
America after passing my exams in 1985. I started my internship in internal medicine in 1989 and have 
been in USA since then. I started my geriatrics fellowship as a VA-sponsored fellow, so including that 
time, I have been with the VA system for 27 plus years. I have worked in different regions and different 
VA facilities. When I started working at the VA, we had many World War I veterans and World War II 
veterans. So, over the years and decades, it has been very interesting, enlightening, and it was an honor, 
it remains an honor, to work with the changing landscape and different generations of veterans. I look 
forward to this opportunity to share my experiences. Thank you for doing this. 
  
LK: Well, thank you. Could you tell us where your parents were born, and did your parents go to school 
or work? What was it like growing up? 
  
SB: Both my parents, they were born in India. My mother passed away at age 52 when I was still in 
medical school. When she passed away, in those days, this was in 1984, India did not have the medical 
privileges. She needed some oxygen badly, she needed more medical care, and we just didn't know what 
she needed. That was one of the defining features in my career, especially to go into hospice and 
palliative care and to offer symptomatic relief to patients who are dying and to educate the families. My 
father was born in a family of temple priests and farmers. He reportedly always wanted to go to medical 
school and did not have the financial resources to do that, so he educated himself and eventually became 
one of the top high-ranking government officials. He was the Law Commission Secretary to the 
government. We grew up in an environment where studies were very, very, very important to us. One of 
me becoming-- One of the reasons I became a doctor was, basically, it was my dad's unfulfilled self-
dream, so he just made sure one of his children, or at least some of his children, become doctors. So, 
here I am. 
  
LK: Sorry about that. That is absolutely incredible. Could you tell us what your early schooling was 
like?

[4:07] SB: Sure. India got independence in 1947. We were ruled by the British for 200 years. I was born 
in 1957. When I started going to school about age four-and-a-half into lower kindergarten, my dad made 
sure that we went to a private school where English was offered as a medium of education. It was 
expensive, but it had higher standards. Our education-- We started learning English language. By the 
time I was seven, eight years old, I could already speak three languages. That is how India is. We would 
have a mother tongue, we would have a medium of instruction, and then we would have a national 
second language. One of my-- If I counted the biggest blessings in life, it is to have [unintelligible] 
parents who valued education and sacrificed so much to put us through good schooling system. After 
doing the kindergarten, I got a double promotion and then went to a convent school, to a Catholic 
school. Again, in those days, for us traditional-- I was born in a Hindu family. It was like breaking the 
laws and risking being social outcast to be sent to a Catholic school, but my parents did not mind it. 
They sent us to a Catholic school, and that 12 years of educational foundation proved to be invaluable, 
so I am very grateful for that. I wish I realized the importance of it when my mom was alive, but at least 
I made it up to my dad. Until he passed away in 2011, I would repeatedly thank him for putting me 
through good schooling. Then, after finishing the 12th grade, we had to compete to go into medical 
school. In India, it is a competitive exam after 12th grade. We had to compete, and it was a purely merit-
based selection. About 0.05% of the applicants get selected to the medical school, so about 200,000 
applicants applied and then very few could get into the medical school. In those days, we had a quota 
system: 30% of the seats were reserved for female students, 70% were reserved for male students. That 
meant for girls to be selected into medical school, they had to really perform very highly. Our entire 
medical school, because we competed and it was a merit-based system, it was free education, so that-- 
Again, these are the things after we grew up, after I come to America and look at the medical school 
loans, etc, we just realized how good we had it in India. But, that is how we were. So, the medical 
school was free. We just had to buy our books and pay the exam fees, but all the education was kind of 
given to us. Would you like me to discuss anything more? Actually, I didn't want to go to medical 
school. I wanted to do arts and psychology, and I wanted to major in English, but as I said, it was my 
dad, again. He was a diplomat, he was a Law Commission secretary. He just told me, "Just write the 
exam. You don't have to do it. I'll be happy if you write the entrance exam." I said, "Okay." As it was 
nearing, he started saying, "If you're taking the test, you don't have to join, but at least wouldn't it be nice 
to get selected?" He started buying me books, and once I had the books, I was reading. When I got 
selected, I thought, "Anyway, I'm not going to do it," but then he started bringing in his parents and 
other diplomats who started kind of saying, "Without giving it a try, how come you don't even want to 
do medical school? You need to give it a try." Basically, I never wanted to do it. But anyway, in India, 
the first year of medical school they teach us chemistry, physics and English. I always loved English, 
and so of all the subjects, I just would make sure I kind of excel in English. From a Catholic school to go 
into a medical school, it was a big relief. So, I think I began to enjoy.  
 
[10:02] SB: Did have a few occasions to go to the doctor's. I dreaded going to the doctor's, and I liked 
the doctors who reassured me first and kind of, even though I was a child or even if I was just 18, who 
treated me with respect. I think something that in terms of humanities and human psychology, my mind 
already started kind of framing, "Okay, this one is a good doctor. This one is not a good doctor. I can't 
wait to go to him again. This one, I never want to go," and I would kick and scream to go to that doctor. 
I think by the time I finished 12th grade, I had a pretty good impression about what to be and what not to 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
6 
 
be, not just for doctors. I think again, when you're a teenager, you begin to frame impressions on people, 
like the ones you like and the ones you don't care much about.  I loved music. I am a trained classical 
vocal Indian singer. My mom used to sing for the All India Radio, and that is something I enjoyed doing 
too. Initially, I would just shadow her. Later, I gave programs for All India Radio myself. If I didn't 
come into medicine, I think I would have pursued. I might not have been successful because I just like-- 
I'm a good singer, however, I don't say I'm in the top 5% cadre or something, but I do enjoy. I love arts 
and crafts, anything creative that I can use my hands for. I love stories. I just love reading and especially 
poetry, whether it is songs or poetry. I do a lot of lyrical analysis. Then I just love good friendships, 
good books. I think in general, I just love life [chuckles]. My dad would always say, "Art, music, they 
can be a supplement but cannot be a substitute". If he allowed me, I would have easily dropped out of 
school and pursued that, but that was not an option [laughs]. As I told before, my mother passed away in 
1984, and that time I was doing my residency in OB-GYN. It was not in the plans to come to America, 
but per Indian customs and in our caste, within a year of a parent's demise, the girls have to get married. 
My dad was honoring that custom in honor of my mother, and that is when he started looking for an 
arranged match for me. There was one of his colleagues would also serve as a marriage mediator. It just 
so happened by that time my husband was already in States, but his parents had gone and just registered 
with this mediator. They indicated they're looking for an educated girl who is preferably a doctor to 
marry their son in USA. My dad went to register me and kind of said, "We are looking for an educated 
young person, and it doesn't matter whether it's US or India [chuckles]. It has to be within a year, the 
marriage." The mediator just kind of said, "It's good timing. We just kind of heard from the parents of 
so-and-so.” The one thing led to the other, and then my husband came to visit us from USA. I think 
within a week after his arrival in his three week stay, his family came to visit. In week two, we were 
engaged. Week three, he left the USA, and then six months later, we were married before the year was 
over. That was a trajectory. Nothing was planned. It was more, "This is what I believe I'm supposed to 
do" [laughs].  
 
BP: During that time, is there a time that you specifically remember that you kind of decided that you 
were going to become a doctor? 
 
SB: From India or here? Or in USA? 
  
BP: Either one, actually. I'm just wondering if there was ever kind of almost like a moment or a time 
that you remember thinking, "Oh, yeah. This is what I'm going to be doing." 
  
[17:16] SB: During medical school, I really liked the intellectual challenge. Subject after subject after 
subject, it was kind of, like, when you take pharmacology, it's so different. Biochemistry is so different. 
Anatomy is so different. Especially when we came to clinical medicine, the human interactions and 
putting the theory, connecting the dots to actual people and trying to treat something, that was beginning 
to gel. Then, in India the medical school is six years. We get to bond with our classmates and we feel 
like we are a close-knit family and it becomes a little bit more enjoyable. We know that everybody has 
to work hard, but the point when actually I began to feel satisfaction was when I was doing my OB-
GYN residency and the responsibility of what it takes to take care of a pregnant lady, and the following 
them through the pregnancy and delivering a happy baby, a healthy baby, and seeing happy parents, that

was very, very, very professionally rewarding and also matured me and I think exposed us to the 
vulnerabilities of life, because there is bad obstetric history. There are some who lost their eighth 
consecutive baby, and to be able to deal with those tears, those sad stories and feeling the helplessness, I 
think, emotionally I started-- Again, in India, when I started medical school I was 17 years old, so we 
didn't have-- Cannot help comparing and contrasting American medicine to Indian medicine. 17 is, like, 
you just don't even know. You don't have the emotional maturity. By the time I came to do my residency 
in OB-GYN, I think I was a little bit more mature and looking at those, and then also started registering 
the male-female biases and prejudices. We also, as part of OB-GYN residency, we would run the 
infertility clinics. We would see that a female would be brought for so many tests and the DNCs and 
procedures and time after time, but the man would not give a simple semen specimen because he was a 
man. No matter we say, "Nothing is wrong with your wife. Now we need to test you," and that would be 
the end of the discussion. We would never see them again. Then they would just tell us, "You are not 
telling anybody. You are not telling my mother. You're not putting in the record that it's my fault." That 
is how it was. It was very powerful, very profound. Again, it was what do you do in your 20s? You 
register it. You realize life is not fair, how obnoxious of you, but beyond that, you could not do anything 
more. In '85, India got the first ultrasound machine. We got it in our residency program. Everybody was 
so excited. There was a two-day workshop to see what an ultrasound machine is, how it works. Families 
would come. They would want a pregnant lady to go through the ultrasound to know the gender of the 
baby. There was no privacy. The mother-in-law would come too, and if it was a female baby, they 
wanted it to be aborted. We went through those, and our senior professor kind of educated us to say, "Do 
not reveal if it's not a boy. Do not say it's a female baby. That is not what the ultrasound is for. 
Ultrasound is kind of to check if the baby's maturing, if the parts are okay." So, we stopped telling them 
whether it's a male or a female. But then, you'd have the assistants, medical assistants, the ladies who 
would help the pregnant-- the ward technicians kind of thing, and the families would bribe those 
technicians and ask them, "Tell us. You must know." They would take the bribe. Not all, but some 
would take the bribe and say, "If the doctor did not tell you it was a boy, it means it is a girl." Again, the 
changing landscape, it was very interesting, and it was just kind of, that is how the life was. I think by 
that time, I realized that being a doctor, we can really heal people and there is a way to contribute. 
During medical school, in the third year, I came University first and won a gold medal, and to see the 
joy in my dad's eyes, I think that was very fulfilling. I think I was okay with whatever I was doing, but it 
felt-- Even to this day, that is one of my best memories to recall how good he felt to see that I won a 
gold medal. Again, in OB-GYN, I came University second. He was so happy. It was a matter of, I'm 
doing good. I'm making my parents happy and they're proud of me. Life is good. 
  
LK: That's fascinating. You're discussing the difference between India and the US. Could you tell us 
about what it was like getting credentialed in the US versus India? 
  
[23:46] SB: While in India, just because I wanted to kill time. I don't know why, but I just took an exam 
called ECFMG, exam of Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates, and also I took an exam 
called TOEFL, Test of English for Foreign Language. Again, if I wanted to take a test, my dad would 
never stop me, but to take the ECFMG we had to go to Manila, Philippines because there was no center 
in India. It was an expensive deal, but again, we were from an affluent family. He didn't mind to send 
me there. I got married in May of '85 and by July of '85, my husband already had a US citizenship by 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

that time, so it was easy for me to just, within two months after marriage, come with him to United 
States. My impression was that I have a gold medal, I have university ranks and I have my degrees, so if 
I arrive in July, by August I could start working. He's an engineer and he did not have any idea about 
medicine, and we were in Kansas, which is very, very conservative for foreign graduates. I was just 
clueless and came and I started slowly exploring. What do I need to do? Then we were told, "Well, you 
don't have the FLEX-- the licensing exam. You need to pass the licensing exam." I had no idea what it 
was, but learnt about it. The American graduates, when they are in their second year or third year of 
residency, they would take the FLEX exam, but as foreigners, we were asked to pass it even before we 
started our residency program. It was not like we had a choice. “If you want to prove you have an edge, 
show us your FLEX exam." By that time, my husband lost his job, I was not employed, and I was 
pregnant with my first child, so speak about dirt poor and then having to pay for the FLEX exam. Didn't 
have any money to take any classes. Just begged, borrowed and whatever, and so took my FLEX exam 
in '86 and passed it in first attempt and also had a baby that year. I thought, "Okay, I have my FLEX 
exam and now I can get into the residency." By that time, they said, "You know what? Until you get into 
any training program, your TOEFL, you need to take it every two years." So [chuckles], I said, "Okay." I 
started taking the TOEFL exam, and I scored 97% in the TOEFL exam. I thought, "Okay, now that 
proves I can speak English and I have my exam." They said, "No." It was a tough journey. Then they 
said, "You do not have any US experience. Sorry, we cannot take foreigners." I saved those letters for a 
long time and finally just thought, "I need to get rid of bad baggage." There were letters from Kentucky 
from so many universities, again this was '87-ish, saying, "We don't take foreign graduates. We don't 
take foreign graduates in our program." Then, in Wichita, Kansas they said, "You don't have any US 
experience," so I went into Wichita State University and joined. Initially I was a research assistant, but 
then, after he saw my work, the professor in physiology hired me as a part-time lecturer. In two weeks, 
he just said, "Okay, you will do this." I worked for a year and applied again, saying I have US 
experience. Then they came back and said, "But that was academic experience. You don't have any 
clinical experience." So, I joined an endocrinologist in community and worked with him for a year as a 
volunteer, as an extern, and applied again. I said, "Okay, I have clinical experience now." Then they 
said, "That is not through any medical school. You just followed a private practice. That is not good 
enough." Then I applied to the medical school. Said, "Can I just be an extern or a volunteer?" They said, 
"For privacy issues, we do not allow anybody to kind of come and work." I said, "I have this degree. I 
have this da da da," so they said, "No." Then I got a call from some OB-GYN clinic and they said, "We 
heard of you--" I was trying every possible way, and so he called and said, "I heard you have OB-GYN 
experience and you are looking for a job. I have a job for you," and I said, "What is it about?" and he 
said, "It's working with a very good group of elite people, elite patients. You don't have to put up with 
the hassle of da da da, whatever. Are you willing to join?" [chuckles]. He was paying $8 an hour. I didn't 
know what it was, but $8 was a fortune. I went and I realized it was an abortion clinic, so I didn't know 
whether to go forward or backward. They gave me a uniform but after a few days-- I mean, I was very 
sentimental. It was not something that I could go forward with. Then somebody [chuckles] came-- a lady 
administrator came and said-- These ladies were flying from all over the country, and when he said 
"elite" I didn't know what it was, but they were coming for an out-of-state abortion. Then she said, "Our 
elite customers are saying that they are not comfortable with your interactions,” or something. I had no 
idea. I was still staring [chuckles] and then she said, "So, we are going to fire you." Again, I didn't know 
the slang. I didn't know what "fire" means. I listened and then said [chuckles], "Can I go now?" and then 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

I said, "I see you tomorrow at eight o'clock" [laughs]. Then she said, "No, we fired you. You are not 
coming back again," and I said, "Oh." I said, "Why?" "Because," she said [chuckles], "because we are 
firing you." By that time, I was thinking "firing" means-- I said something like, "That means you're 
terminating?" or something, and she said, "Yeah." In a way I was relieved, but I was afraid that my 
husband would get angry because that was still some income to the family. Anyway, I just took my car, 
drove around, stopped by some bakery shop, got some sweets, circled around my home, finished all my 
whatever sweets there were there. I just kind of went in and kind of announced to the family, "Okay, I 
don't have to go back." That was a big relief. I think maybe I am giving too many details. Let us focus 
back on your question. Lisa, what was your focus again? [chuckles] 
  
LK: Oh, no, that was absolutely wonderful. I was asking about credentialing, and so that was absolutely 
wonderful information and very important details, so thank you very much. 
  
SB: Sure. In terms of credentialing, once they said, "We cannot take you," or whatever, "Your 
qualifications are not good enough," I just-- By that time, I was beginning to be a little bit more 
assertive, I think, or desperate, or like they say, "a wounded deer leaps high". I went, gate-crashed into 
some boardroom at the hospital. I didn't know who was who. I didn't know what professor or dean, what 
those chairs and the seating meant, but I just literally gate-crashed into the room and I just said, "Here is 
my gold medal. Here is my university ranks. This is my experience. Last year, you said this, da da da, da 
da da. Just tell me point blank, do I stand a chance here in Wichita or not?" That person said, “Since 
you're--" He stood up from his seat. There was a group of people. I mean, ignorance is bliss. I didn't 
know what a boardroom, whatever those meetings are, but he stood up and he said, "I'm impressed with 
the way you're challenging me, but since you are asking me so pointedly, let me tell you. Let me give 
you a direct answer. No, you have no chance here," and I said, "But you have unmatched positions over 
here." He said, "If they are unmatched, we will add it to next year's quota and fill in with American 
medical graduates, but we will not take foreign medical graduates here. I hope that clears it for you.” I 
said, "Thank you," and I came out. Then my dad came to visit me. I didn't know what else to do with my 
life. All my life by this time I spent doing medicine, and so there was some pressure from the in-law’s 
side saying that I should take whatever job, whether it's a lab technician or a phlebotomist or whatever, 
instead of just waiting for that golden job. When my dad came to visit me at that time, he saw what was 
going on, and then he just kind of spoke to my brothers who were living in another state in USA, he 
spoke to my sister was in another state, and he just said, "You all know she was the brightest child and 
what she's doing is not right. Family has to intervene and do something." My sister arranged for me to be 
an extern at Syracuse VA hospital in psychiatry, and that was wonderful. Stayed with another physician 
at her home and did good job, got good recommendations, applied one more time from there. I think that 
experience working in the VA hospital in mental health at least qualified me for some-- I got selected 
into the internship at DC General Hospital. When I say the immigrant stories, we are clueless. We don't 
know what is what. One day, the owner of the home, the one who was hosting me, we sat down for 
dinner and she was going through her mail and trashing all the junk mail. We were eating, and then one 
of the mails was just jetting up. She just said, "Interesting. I never get any telegram. Wonder what this 
bogus message is." While we were eating, she pulled up that and she pulled it open, and it was a 
telegram for decision of DC hospital saying, “Saraswathy Battar, we would like to offer you a job. If 
you want to accept it, immediately give a call to so and so.” We didn't know what it was so we stopped

eating. She is way more mature. She's 15 years older to me. She said, “It is real. It is not like a lottery 
ticket or something.” We rehearsed a lot. First, we were thinking, “Should we call now?” She said, 
“People in America, between six and seven they eat, so you don't call at this time. Give it some time. 
After eight it is too late. You need to call.” Anyway, we rehearsed and I gave a call to that, and then, of 
course the director for the internal medicine program, he just said, “Yes, so you are accepting it?” I was 
thinking [chuckles], “Accepting it? I'm ready to give my life for it.” So, I said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” and 
then he said, “Okay. Tomorrow, call this number and tell them you accept it and we will start the 
paperwork.” That was barely a two-minute call, and so it felt so surreal. Then we called my husband 
from my friend's place. He had so many questions. Anyway, fast forward: Got accepted into DC General 
Hospital. This was in ‘89. Again, it was a city hospital. There were 13 interns. Out of that, everybody 
was a foreign graduate, and out of that, 11 were from Hyderabad, my hometown, from different years. 
We just got started there. Then after first year, got transferred to Texas Tech University. Then after that, 
it was no problem at all. In terms of credentialing, not credentialing but to get a state license, it was very, 
very, very difficult because their requirement is they needed original documents, original certificates 
from Hyderabad, India, and they also wanted a roster of all our class, all the names of the classmates, 
and India doesn't keep records like USA keeps it. My dad was still alive, but he had to make tons of 
visits to the medical school. They would not release it because it was their privacy. They said, “What 
business does America have to have list of all the class people, their first names, last names? We will not 
release it.” Again, him being a diplomat, he could somehow navigate through, and whatever we give, 
USA started saying, “We need a class roster. We need a class roster.” What my dad did finally was 
whatever the Indian medical school was ready to give, he said, “Okay. Give it but put the header as 
‘Roster for medical school so and so.’” Finally that met the needs, and because it was called a roster, 
they accepted it. 
  
LK: How long have you been a doctor? 
  
[40:11] SB: Forever [laughs]. I finished my OB-GYN residency in '85, didn't get a chance to practice in 
India, but the internship I started here in '89. If we are counting India, that would be from '76, but if 
you're counting just the USA, it is from '89 onwards. 
  
LK: Incredible. Where do you work now? 
  
SB: I work for the VA in Houston, Texas, and I'm an associate professor in medicine at the Baylor 
College of Medicine. 
  
LK: What made working at the VA appealing for you? 
  
SB: Number one would be gratitude, because after facing so many humiliations and rejections from 
private sector-- In my fellowship, I didn't even know the difference, but when they just kind of-- In the 
geriatrics fellowship, they just said, "We take two fellows. One would be a VA fellow, one would be a 
University of Kansas fellow." Had no clue. It just so happened that I was supposed to be the VA fellow. 
For us, it didn't make any difference. Once I started working for the VA, I tried to work in the private 
sector. First of all, I think was still little bit upset about the rejections in private sector. VA never ever 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

asked me about, "We don't take foreigners," or I didn't feel discriminated or anything. Just the veterans 
loved me. I think it was mutual. I would just sit with them for-- I would go on weekends. They think I 
was always a compassionate and kind of caring person. We bonded very well. These days, we have the 
Whole Health concept and this and that, but in those days we didn't know what Whole Health was. 
However, I just kind of was always looking into the whole health, what matters to you and who is in 
your family and tell me about your experiences and things like that. I earned a good name, and that 
meant the good circles and the good recognition I was getting helped me a lot. Then once we were in 
Albuquerque, again, by this time we had two children and I was moonlighting a lot, but when I was 
moonlighting, I just did not like the bean counters with the private sector. They would just kind of tell 
me, "From 45 minutes, if you cut it down to 35 minutes, you can see so many more patients," and an 
accountant who repeatedly keep on talking about how every Thursday, it was a financial meeting. I just 
did not like that part of it. I think that is when I had to get out of the moonlighting part of it. I just 
thought the money was good, we could take cruises and all, but in the VA, the best thing was that it's a 
salaried job. You have your [unintelligible, maybe 'leave'] days. Over the years, I realized it's more than 
the job. It's the people with whom we work that makes a difference. I realized, okay, private sector is not 
for me, but I think another major turning point which stays with me to even now and transformed me, 
was in Knoxville, Iowa. We went from Albuquerque to Knoxville, Iowa. They asked me to take a job as 
a geriatrician. Initially, I was not sure. We didn't even know there was another Knoxville in America. It 
was a town of 9,000 and 2-mile radius town, but the VA was the third biggest employer. The Long Term 
Care was in Knoxville and I was a big fish in a small pond. They hardly had anybody. They had 155 
nursing home patients and there was no geriatrician. The Office of Inspector General reportedly came 
and said, "Either you hire a geriatrician or you close down your facility," so they needed me pretty 
badly. I think there I met the facility director, Mr. Cooper. Somehow, he kind of convinced him that I 
was a good hire. We had a formal mentoring program and he became my mentor, this was around 2000. 
He opened the doors, sent me through so many leadership programs, and kind of he would meet with me 
regularly and taught me many things in life. He was a psychologist by trade and he was a grandfather by 
that time, so he had a lot of worldly wisdom and also a broad mind. For six years, I worked there. I still 
am in touch with Mr. Cooper after this my 20 years. Even now, I mean, I just have to stop and think, 
"What would Mr. Cooper do in a situation like this?" What he taught me, a lot of what I do as a leader 
now is what I learned in Knoxville, Iowa. Yes, there is bureaucratic headaches, there is red tape, there is 
this, but it is our choice where-- Again, I believe when there is darkness around, it's better to light even a 
small candle than curse the darkness, so that's what I do. I do reach out to people, especially the 
foreigners too. Then I realize it's not the color of our skin, it's not where we are born. If somebody has 
the capacity, I think we should do whatever we could do to make them possibility thinkers and bring out 
the best in them. 
  
LK: Can we talk more about the work that you currently do? 
  
[47:24] SB: Sure. Probably before leading to this, there should be a little bit of a segue. I need to build in 
a segue. I went through all possible leadership programs, whatever they had to offer. All my career, I 
wanted to be a chief of staff in a tertiary care hospital. It was kind of, whatever. I think I just wanted to 
prove something to myself, the society, relatives or friends, whatever. I don't know what it was, but it 
was a big dream: I want to be a chief of staff in a tertiary care facility. Eventually, I did become chief of 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
12 
 
staff in a tertiary care facility, but four months into the job-- Before that, I became a first-time service 
level chief in 2005 in Hampton, Virginia, and I realized what being the department chief means. In 
almost every place that I work, I would be probably the only female Indian physician who would be a 
department head or above. Houston it is different, but even until my last job, we would be sitting in all 
the department head meetings, this, that, and just out of curiosity but nothing big, but I would look 
around and realize I'm the only female, I'm the only Indian over here, a foreigner who is a department 
head, and that added pride and responsibility as well. But when I did become a chief of staff, within four 
to five months, I realized it was not my cup of tea, that I was chasing the wrong stars or whatever. I 
realized that number one, I cannot do patient care period. Had to spend all my time in meetings, and then 
there were a lot of disciplinary actions. None of them were my fault, but all I had to do was clean up 
everybody's mess and kind of be the face of the organization when the [unintelligible] and all those 
people come to give an explanation. Within a year, I kind of started going, “What can I do to step down 
and just become a geriatrician again?” So, that is what I did, and I did that in Arkansas. One of my other 
dreams or aspirations was to be affiliated with a good academic facility. Knowing that the VA over here 
has very strong collaborations with MD Anderson and Baylor College of Medicine, that kind of brought 
me in here. This is the last kind of leg of my career. Just thought, "Okay, let me finish doing what I love 
to do.” Right now I am the Medical Director for Extended Care Line at Houston VA Medical Center. 
Extended Care Line here has six major programs: inpatient and outpatient palliative care program, 
inpatient and outpatient wound care program, outpatient ambulatory geriatric clinics, home-based 
primary care, Community Living Center, and academics with Baylor and MD Anderson. Also, through 
the Office of Academic Affiliations, we have the only physician assistant residency program, and that is 
with us in Extended Care Line. I am the medical director with oversight for all these programs. 
  
[51:34] SB: December, 2019. On paper, December 2019, but it was January by the time I came in, and 
March was when COVID was declared, so that was not in my plan [laughs]. But, however, again, 
sometimes we just have to make meaning out of life. I just felt maybe I was ordained to be here at this 
time. All the years of experience did come in handy to help our facility deal with the COVID crisis. As 
you all heard about, Houston was the hub for the COVID. Last year it was pretty bad, and now again we 
have another surge. To really navigate through all these COVID channels at this time, I had to use every 
muscle, every fiber of my experience, both clinical, academic, administrative and leadership, and 
navigate through the VA channels. That became our breathing. Again, I'm a people person. I believe in 
direct personal relationships before diving into work and responsibilities and assignments. I don't know 
why I did it, but usually I would have taken four to five months to do that, but within three to four 
weeks, I would ask my admin support staff to schedule face-to-face one-hour interviews with all my 
direct reports. That turned out to be such a big blessing when COVID hit and we had to do everything 
virtually. Also to really shift gears, because by that time, we all had a personal connection. When is your 
birthday? Who is in your family? What is the best way to get the best out of you? And this and that. I 
had their portfolios with me and they knew who I was. I think that foundation, I just tried to find 
opportunities, reasons to feel gratitude for, and that was one of the things. The day started, of course, we 
were just trying to go through the mundane and who is who in the department, but in March, I think on 
March 20th of 2020, I myself was exposed to another person with COVID. That time we didn't even 
know what the symptoms were, but I would call and say, "My muscles are aching, I cannot move my 
body, I'm throwing up, this and that." Then the test, it was such a big hurdle. We were not doing the test. 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
13 
 
Had to go somewhere to [unintelligible, maybe 'get it'] and it took a long time to get the reports back. 
Having personally experienced it, I think that sensitized me more. Then, when they talk about the long 
haulers for COVID, if I didn't experience it, I would have thought this is fiction. Then not only me 
believing, but I could convince my colleagues to say, "Believe them when they say they still have 
symptoms, they still have a headache, etc." We went into [unintelligible], but I feel one of my major 
contributions, and I feel grateful for that opportunity, is we had to convert a 30-bed nursing home unit 
into a 30-bed COVID unit. That took a lot of planning, orchestration, looking through the minute details, 
hundreds of communications within the department, within the facility at a vision level, at a national 
level. That was a major undertaking, but it served the purpose very well because we needed those 30 
beds. Not only that, because of my experience, I got tapped into doing a lot of national presentations. 
We were the first VA who created a palliative unit in a CLC, so I was asked to really guide so many 
other facilities who will try to convert and what to do with our nursing home patients. It helped 
nationally a lot with COVID experience. Last year we went into the Teams, which made it much easier 
to do the virtual meetings, etc. Right now, we are really dealing again with the lockdowns and the 
testings and the frequencies of the testing, so it is a lot for the mind to process and to stay on top of what 
is the latest guidance. I just feel sometimes I think you're looking for a silver lining. If I were to get 
dementia, at least all this experience is going to push my dementia back by about five more years or so 
[laughs], protect me from dementia, because it is a lot of intellectual challenge. It takes a lot of 
resilience, and have to look at, "This is going to end one day." Another thing that I started, I started it in 
May when COVID hit, was twice a day, we would have all-staff meetings just for half an hour, because, 
I mean, so many people had so many questions. There was fear, there was uncertainty, there was anger, 
and in the long-run, people would say, throughout all this ordeal, throughout all this anguish, feeling a 
sense of togetherness, feeling a sense of belonging through those twice-a-day calls, helped them to really 
perform and gave them some reassurance. We started it in March. Come October, we thought COVID is 
almost gone or fading and let us stop these calls, but there was a unanimous echo. They said, "No, keep 
the calls going. If you want to instead of twice a day, make it once a day”, so we tapered it from twice a 
day. We made it once a day then we made it twice a week. Currently, we have it once a week. March to 
2020 to August of 2021, those calls are still ongoing. 
  
[59:25] SB: Of course, yeah. And I feel, again, because we are in direct patient care but also, we are in 
connection with the rest of the nation and with the VA central office, we have significant both breadth 
and depth of experience with what is coming down the pipeline with what exactly matters. I have the 
VA Department of Geriatrics, they are just a call away. I feel comfortable to tell them, "This is working 
and this is not working. We need something different to be done." And also work with our facilities, 
again, to say, “Sometimes it's okay to bend a rule. Don't break the rule, but it's okay to bend the rule. 
The regulations are here to offer guidance, but regulations are not here to prevent us from doing the right 
thing. If anything matters, use the Good Samaritan rule and say you had to do it because of that and you 
will be protected, but be very clear about that.” There are quite a lot of ethical dilemmas as well, so I 
work very, very closely with the chair of the ethics committee and, actually, I worked in Houston to 
create an ethics council. Before it was kind of, if they had a question, they had to call a certain person 
and get a curbside consult, so I formalized and about six months ago, we have a formal ethics council in 
the CPRS chart. Maybe things naturally always could be better, and hindsight is usually better than 
when we are actually dealing with the thick of things, but it certainly helps to be familiar with the VA 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
14 
 
system. For me, I felt, and our director over here kind of says, that often, having that network 
connections and having the confidence and the practical wisdom to say, "This is what we need to do, 
and we can get by by doing this. No, we are not breaking the rule. This is the rationale, and if anything 
happens, I will put my reputation on line. I am watching for it. This is what we need to do." Maybe 10 
years ago I wouldn't have spoken like that, but now I feel confident to say, "I speak and you need to 
listen. There is a time to play and then there is a time to argue. We do not argue about this. Just let us get 
going." And again, I'm really open about the whistleblower right and there is no retaliation, and I assure 
the staff there is not going to be any retaliation. When we are working with the patients, what counts is 
can you prove that whatever you are doing is in the best interest of this patient? I balance the rewards 
and recognition with progressive disciplinary actions. Are square pegs in square holes? Are round pegs 
in round holes in your department, in your whatever, workplace? If that is not happening, let us speak 
about the elephant in the room. We cannot keep on sweeping things under the rug. I talk a lot to our 
staff, "If you see something is not right, please do let me know. If I myself have some blind spots, you 
will be doing me a favor by showing me my blind spots. Do it professionally and do it in a private way, 
or whatever you seem is right. What you say is important, but how you say is very, very important.” I'm 
very big into emotional IQ and so I think it is good. It's a good feeling. The staff needed somebody like 
me. I needed somebody like this place, I guess, to pay forward and give it whatever I was blessed with. 
It's an opportunity to pay forward and think, every day if we all can leave the community around us a 
little better than what it was from the time we woke up, that's all that matters. 
  
[1:04:43] Yes, it is. I think work is good. It is an honor to take care of veterans. What is painful, whether 
it is a VA or private sector, is the ego clashes, the power struggles. Then, I remember them as few, kind 
of thing. People have some fears when they act in a certain way, and to understand, "Why is it that you 
are fighting me? Why is it that you're not doing what I'm asking you to do?" or "What fears do you 
have?" To address those fears and then also to look at their ego issues. If somebody has an ego issue, if 
we can get the job done, it's okay, stroke the ego. They just wanted to be acknowledged in every 
meeting, they want to be publicly acknowledged or whatever it takes. I think that's a sense of security to 
say, "If I throw this bone to you, if you are going to work with me and help with the committee, I will 
stroke your ego. Let me do it for you." Then the wiring. No matter what, some people they are wired 
only to find fault with others. Or, we cannot expect them to give more than what they have. Somewhere 
I heard, if you are a 10-gallon tank and you are working with a pint-sized pitcher, they cannot fill you in, 
so do not even expect-- You cannot make that pint-sized pitcher grow up to be a 10-gallon tank. Instead, 
you adjust your expectations from them and just accept it. You are wired a certain way; they are wired a 
certain way. Do what is best that is possible with the current resources at this given time. But I think for 
me personally, I am very accommodating, I'm very patient, but what makes me impatient is the ego 
troubles and the personality traits and those things are very hard. I mean, how to really grin and bear it if 
we cannot avoid it. Otherwise, my mantra is, "Trade them or train them." If you can train them, train 
them. If not, just kind of do something to-- Unless we tackle it, we cannot make progress, because they 
just keep [unintelligible] everybody. 
  
SB: Naturally, the socioeconomic status does matter, and their value systems certainly matter, and 
whatever influences they succumb to, each one, those things do matter. It has been interesting. Initially, 
when we heard about people flying, taking a flight all the way to Florida to take the vaccine, to then 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
15 
 
really giving them $100 awards to take a vaccine, so I just cannot help but wonder which way the world 
is going or things like that. But, in terms of the inequality, there are many factors that go into that. Some 
are at a personal level; some are at a community level. Again, just like, this is a change process, right? 
The world is changing and people have to adapt to change. When we speak about implementing a 
change, it's not always easy. There are some early adapters, there are some moderate adapters, there are 
some late adapters, and then there are some never adapters. That is where it is. Like, the folks who 
couldn't wait to get vaccinated, there was the early adapters and slowly the numbers increased, but then 
we have to accept that there are still going to be some who will never adapt or who will never change, 
and that is okay too. Again, we do the best with what we can. In terms of the inequality, the perceptions 
matter. Even at workplace, we hear reports about people who are very sick and symptomatic, but still 
they need the paycheck and so they still come to work not realizing the impact, the danger that they are 
putting others into. Then the other extreme is that the workers who know that they're entitled to some 
amount of leave and they just call in and say, "I'm sick," or, "I'm doing this," and so it's just a package 
deal. What matters more is what is within our sphere of influence, let us work on that. What is outside 
our sphere of influence, there is no point in wasting our time and talent to fix what is not fixable. 
  
LK: How do you think the pandemic has impacted healthcare in the US generally? 
  
[1:11:59] SB: It shifted priorities. People had to really learn to focus on something very new with very 
short notice and with a lot of uncertainty. This is not textbook medicine. Even for the brilliant minds to 
keep up with what is PCR testing, what is [unintelligible, maybe 'ID'] test now and what is the 
turnaround rate. All that technical information is very, very challenging for even the well-trained doctors 
to keep up with. It's not like we can come up with a immunization schedule: This is when you need to do 
this and this is the rhythm you maintain. But with this, how do I take off for 14 days? Do I take off for 
10 days? It still remains very challenging. That is one of the reasons I still do my every week all-staff 
meetings. Another thing is the knowledge. Something that I feel is an opportunity which is still not 
being done and should be done is to simplify the message, package it in such a way that a sixth grader, 
eighth grader can understand it. The technicalities are too confusing and too scary, and the media doesn't 
help much. Even they talk about this many that, this many this, but it is a very simplified package of 1-
2-3, wash your hands for 20 seconds, do a protective equipment and use your eye shields and maintain 
six-feet distance. When we walk into the facilities we are screened. That is good, but if we really watch, 
how many people are using the hand sanitizer for 20 seconds and doing it the way they should? I would 
say not even 20% are doing it. For me that kind of is painful and I bring it up as much as I can. Even 
when we go to the grocery stores and all, when they said vaccinated people do not need to wear masks 
and we see eight out of 10 are not wearing masks and we just think, “Really? You mean to say you all 
are fully vaccinated?” but that is outside our sphere of influence. For medical field, another thing which 
pains us as physicians is when the hospitals are filled up with all the COVID beds and when a bad 
COPD’er, when a bad heart disease patient or a bad diabetes patient comes when we have no beds for 
them, but because the bed is given away to a COVID person, it is like, “How can the system really 
expand so much to do all that?” The contingency planning, I don't think that was high on our list 
because we didn't expect it. Especially now, there are physicians who are getting very angry because the 
beds are given to the unvaccinated COVID patients and they are saying, “No beds for those with chronic 
medical illnesses or heart attacks.” That causes moral distress. Physicians in general don't talk much 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
16 
 
about moral distress, and we don't openly say, “I need some help. I need some counseling.” We just 
think we just have to deal with it or we are too weak to come out, as you are a weak person to say that 
you are feeling hurt or you are a softy, etc. But I think there should be something that has to be kind of 
more widely discussed, more openly discussed, to say, “It is okay to feel this way.” I tell you, those 
initial days in the New York when they were talking about the morgues and those trucks with all the 
bodies, that image still haunts me. At least the intensity is not as much as it was, but when it was 
happening, it was mentally traumatic to watch that. Then here on our palliative unit, when we knew 
somebody was dying and the system, again, the rules, would not allow the caregivers to come to the 
bedside. We had a situation when a doctor-- This was middle of last year. The flights were cancelled 
from New York because it was a high incidence danger zone. One of our veterans was dying on our 
hospice unit, so his daughter drove from New York all the way because they were no flights. She came. 
She was outside our emergency department. We thought, "Okay, we will make an exemption for her, 
and she can come with all the protection." Her dad was actively dying. When we made an exception 
from her, then we realized she had an 11-year-old child with her. Then, because she's from New York 
and her dad didn't have any network or anybody, there was nobody to leave the 11-year-old child with 
and we would not allow kids into the hospital, into the palliative unit. We were trying to do a FaceTime 
both for her and her dying father, of course. He had all his oxygen masks, which we had to remove just 
for a few seconds, and she had her mask and all, so she could acknowledge it is her dad but I don't think 
her dad recognized her. These are the stories which just kind of leave a bad aftertaste and pain. Only 
again, we work very hard to find some silver linings, because she could come. She insisted, "My dad 
always carries a yellow bag. He doesn't go anywhere without it. Where is that yellow bag?" She was 
insisting, insisting so we just had to really follow up. Finally turned out that somewhere when he came 
through the ED, it was left in the ED. That yellow bag was there, but when he was admitted into the 
hospital, that bag didn't go with him. We gave her that yellow bag, and in that yellow bag he had keys to 
his apartment, to his home, so she could go into his home and she could take care of the issues. She had 
a place to stay. We just were grateful at least some good came out of her visit for driving all the way 
from New York. 
  
LK: Wow, these are unprecedented times. Really horrific things are happening. At this time, do you 
have a weekly work schedule with all this happening? 
  
SB: Yes. So-- 
  
LK: I mean, or is it-- yeah. 
  
[1:20:11] SB: Two of our nursing home units out of five are on lockdown. Any time a patient or a staff 
member on a unit turns positive, that unit is supposed to be on lockdown for 14 days from the day that 
person tested positive. We tried our best to keep those schedules where there's a lot of demand for beds 
for the patient flow. If the unit is on lockdown we cannot accept new patients, and so that was becoming 
a kind of a bottleneck. There's a lot of discussion going on about that. Then, we do have daily schedules, 
but it is-- Another thing that everybody needs to remember is, yes, COVID is happening, but the 
previous types of patients with the liver problems, heart problems, or dementia and delirium, they are 
not going anywhere, so when so much attention is given to COVID, we are shortchanging those other 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
17 
 
patients, especially the persons with dementia. They don't understand why they need to sit in their room 
and why they cannot come to the dining room to mix with everybody. They don't understand why they 
are not getting their weekly [unintelligible] to Walmart and why they are not taken out to eat. When they 
see the staff with the goggles and face masks, they don't recognize who they are. It is causing a lot of 
unrest and challenges in managing patients with dementia, delirium and those cognitive deficits. We are 
hearing lots of reports about patient-to-patient assault, patient-to-employee assault and employee-to-
patient assault. These kind of things, I think whether it is COVID-related burnout or other built-up 
features, etc., those behaviors we are seeing at a higher level. When we have to call in the police just for 
sure force. I feel bad especially for persons with dementia and those for whom it is a quality of life to be 
visited by their families. We arranged a few times the window visits, the drive-through visits, so we 
would have our veterans on this side of the glass door and the families could kind of visit. It was 
beautiful when they were bringing their posters, "Dad, I love you," "Grandpa, I love you.” It was a lot of 
coordination because the housekeeping has to clean, the distancing has to be followed, the transportation 
has to be arranged. It is a lot of work but it is doable. It has changed us. I think it will be a long time 
before all these memories go away and we feel good for whatever little good we could do. But the 
intensity of it is going to be very profound. I mean, if there was something that we could do, we would 
feel honored and we would feel fulfilled, but if we are witnessing something that-- what can we do to 
force somebody to get vaccinated or not to put themselves and others at risk? We do not know what to 
do with it, but this will leave a very-- I think, the burnout in physicians, in all the professionals-- Again, 
I talked to our staff a lot about the physician burnout, like, what exactly is burnout? Are you feeling 
exhausted? You do not have energy. Your work is not fulfilling anymore. You feel like you are not 
contributing. Then there is depersonalization. Before, if somebody says, "Look, I'm hurting," it would 
be, "Tell me more about it. How can I help you?" but now it is like, "Deal with it. What can we do? It's 
happening to everybody," so that is depersonalization. I deliberately encourage the staff, "When you feel 
you're exhausted, before you hit the point of burnout, do whatever it takes to preserve. Get out of the 
driver's seat or assign another driver. Come back when you think you are safe for yourself and whoever 
is depending on you.” I mean, those things come with age, maturity, and seeing life. I'm not sure how 
many people are doing things like that, but at least I feel for our service, personally I feel-- That's what I 
mean by when I say I feel ordained to be here at this time. 
  
[1:26:29] SB: Absolutely. To set a tone. One of the reasons I became a leader, a physician executive, is 
when I'm a regular field physician, I light one small candle at a time, and that would flicker for a little 
bit and then after that it's gone, but by becoming a leader, a healthcare leader, I feel I can change the 
player role in changing the circuit and have a much wider impact and a much longer shelf life. By 
teaching, by mentoring others-- If I'm working with a 25-year-old medical student or if I'm working with 
my 30, 40, 50, whatever-year-old juniors, etc., they are going to practice medicine for another 15 years, 
10 years, whatever. In their lifespan, they will be treating thousands of patients and holding jobs, so, by 
being a role model for them, by kind of having that kind of positive influence, I feel this is how we get 
to change, we get to own our future. My role would be to, again, be a positive difference-maker, to be 
the voice of reason and also still continue to learn and grow and maintain that humility. Win without 
pride and lose without giving excuses. So, the journey continues. There will be failures, there will be 
successes, but at the end of the day, again, is the world around me new and slightly better because I 
lived in it today? That is what matters.

SB: In general or COVID related? I think for the veterans, we need to build more bridges and transform 
ideas into actions. The Whole Health concept is wonderful. That is theory. What is more practical, a 
five-day workshop and pumping in dollars into mental health services, saying, “This is what we do,”? 
How are we actually touching the patients’ lives with these noble ideas? Again, the concepts are the 
same. When we say, “Okay, whether it is a program or a funding, what is the goal?” that goal has to-- I 
mean, when Kennedy said, “By the end of the decade, we will put a man on the moon and bring him 
back safely to land,” that is how simple your message has to be. Whoever is touched by this program, by 
this novel idea, by this whatever, investment, whoever is touching, can they really articulate what the 
goal is? I think that is where the transformation happens, when life is kept simple and we engage those 
who actually grease their elbows. Right now, the way I see the VA is, there is really not that much 
exchange. It's not a two-way traffic between the VA headquarters and what happens in the field. There 
should be some more systematic way-- I mean, since you asked, this is [unintelligible] idea. Maybe not 
everybody agrees, but I feel the goals should be clear, simply, and there should be some metrics for 
success. If we just say, “We will prevent this many suicides,” or, “So many people will benefit from 
Whole Health program,” and is the goal clear? Are the actions clear? Are the actions leading towards the 
goal? And is there a measure of success? Hold the people accountable. Just saying you will do it or it’s 
100% completed TMS training, and so what? Then what are you doing about it? How are you holding 
somebody accountable? There are some good workers, there are some very bad workers. How are we 
recognizing and rewarding those good contributors? How are we reinforcing this is what we stand for, 
this is what we are advocating for? Let the good workers rise and shine and begin to do the progressive 
disciplinary actions away. Again, I go a lot with mnemonics. Have you done your counseling, 
reprimand, admonishing, suspension, termination? If you haven't done any of those things, all we did is 
complain and grunt and be afraid to do those things. How are we telling the good workers, “You are 
safe, we appreciate you, and we are paying you more because of your work”? How are we telling the 
bad workers, “You need to go. This has to change. If not, this is what we are going to do”? If we don't 
do either of those, the bad workers will think, “I'm still getting my paycheck. Nobody is worrying me. I 
have my free time. Why should I change?” and the good workers are getting disheartened, thinking, “I 
have to do not only my job, but I need to compensate for all these bad workers. We both are getting the 
same paycheck, but that one is going on holidays and I'm sacrificing my holidays”. There comes the 
moral issue. VA really doesn't do much about the recruitment and retention. I think those procedures 
have to be tightened way more. As we all know, in VA, the human resources and quality management, 
those are two really weak departments. Despite everybody acknowledging how critical those specialties 
are or how much help we need, how desperate we are, still we don't have good enough or a good volume 
of staff. If we are not recruiting the right staff, if we are not letting go of the bad staff, if we are not 
retaining the exceptional employees, why are we complaining? 
  
[1:35:01] SB: Personal and professional. I can touch both. In terms of working with the veterans, as I 
mentioned, to come in clueless-- I mean, when I came, I had no idea what was World War I, II, Korea or 
Vietnam. Had to really sit with a social worker early in my career and she gave me on an index card: 
These are the wars, and so, if you see this age group, they might be tied to this. I think that is important, 
that kind of orientation, especially because there are a lot of foreign graduates in the VA system. There 
is no orientation in terms of what do these words mean and what does the chronology mean in terms of

the impact on the veterans. Having dealt with them personally, I see a lot of difference in how life is 
approached by World War I and II veterans versus the younger generation of veterans. That is one, and 
then systematically, naturally VA has modernized a lot and there are many more programs available. 
There is more transparency and so there is more [unintelligible, maybe ‘hope’]. However, in terms of 
some segments where the merit is bypassed for connections, we see that. It took me a lot to and I learned 
to speak up about 15, 16 years into my career. Until then, I would not speak up when I see inequality. 
That is how long it took me once I knew, “You know what? I am triple board qualified. I have my 
leadership programs, I know the whistleblower laws, I know about [unintelligible].” That is what it took 
me when to really look at fear in the face or discrimination in the face and to point blank-- I'm sure my 
perception counts. My perception is that you are not giving me this job because I am a different looking 
person and you have a personal connection with this person. It still happens, so we cannot say, “VA 
doesn't do that. VA doesn't discriminate.” No. There is discrimination in the VA. It happens in pockets 
and it is overlooked. It is not pleasant to deal with, and it is a headache to deal with. I understand that it 
is a practical inconvenience, but unless really the core leadership-- It takes a different kind of 
commitment. Again, when we’re walking the talk, when we talk about the [unintelligible], all those 
values, or VA also says, “We want to be the leaders. We want to provide safe, effective, efficient, 
compassionate, cost-effective, person-centered care,” beautiful. We need to promote more and more of 
that philosophy and showcase those good examples. At a personal level, I think I still remain very 
grateful to the VA. I mean, I feel honored to work with the veterans. Yes, there have been some 
headaches and humiliations and rejections but still, I would not change a thing. I would still stick with 
the VA. 
  
[1:39:27] SB: In my current job? To give any guarantees about, “Don't worry, we have beds for 
everybody. Don't worry, all the staff are safe. Don't worry, all the patients will be safe,” we cannot give 
any guarantees to that. Again, to deal with the uncertainties: What is tomorrow going to be? I don't 
know how many staff will call in sick. I don't know which patient will turn positive. We are only as 
strong as our weakest link. This virtual life has made it little bit hard to observe people in action. Like, 
we avoid cross-contamination. We say, “If you are working on Unit 1 Delta, stick to your unit. Don't go 
to Three Bravo.” Before, I would do a lot of rounds, practical rounds. I could know the staff by their 
names. I could know what they're doing. I love to catch them doing something right and appreciate 
them. If somebody is not doing their job, I could tell them, “This is--" All that is taken away from us. 
We are literally living with major handicaps, professional handicaps, and still expected to deliver. While 
all this is going on, still the things, the root cause analysis, the meetings, those things-- It is very hard to 
juggle with all the deliverables and expectations. If you're eating on a plate, to create room for a new 
item, you need to let some other item go or you need to make space for it. Right now, there is a heap 
sitting there and if you move on, everything else moves and it is unsafe, so that is hard because-- Again, 
this is my personal experience. I have been always very organized, streamlined, prepared and that kind 
of a person. For me, the current life to really tell myself, “It's okay. It's not going to be like how you 
want to be but move on. Get on with it.” Then I am also a detail-oriented person and I cannot get the 
details that I want given the current situation. Quite a few times have to go with your intuition, hunch or 
hearsay reports, and so at a personal level, that is a major adjustment. Also, our social system. Before, 
we would take breaks and kind of plan, we would have in-person meetings, we would kind of have those 
connections. Whether we realized or not, they made us the whole persons that we are. Right now, you're

stripped of all those peripheral things and you are just expected to still be the same human being with all 
those challenges. In a way, I feel relieved this is the last leg of my career, that I am as mature as I am, 
but also my heart goes out to those who are way younger who have not seen life that much or who are 
more emotionally fragile and are unable to keep up with the changing times. 
  
LK: Do you have someone who you think of as a professional mentor who has influenced your career? 
  
SB: Yes, Mr. Donald Cooper. He's the retired Medical Center Director from VA Central Iowa. I have 
another person too, Dr. Edmund Duthie: D-U-T-H-I-E. He-- He was my fellowship director from 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. These are the two persons who have shaped me in my career. I'm still in touch 
with both of them. When I have some, whether it is a celebratory event or a mind-boggling event or I 
just need a sounding board, I will still reach out to Mr. Cooper. 
  
[1:44:15] SB: To be a [unintelligible] difference-maker. I take pride in my work, and I think the most-- 
Currently, when I retire, the legacy that I would leave, among the major ones-- In 2016, I was working 
on a 15-bed inpatient unit and I realized I was working with the fellows and trainees. I realized that we 
were admitting a lot of patients in the subacute rehab unit through the emergency department or clinics, 
but quite a lot of them, it was a drug-related side effects. I mean, their blood control, their sugars were 
too low, they had a stroke, their blood pressure was too low, they had a fall or they were acting weird. It 
so happened that while we were looking, quite a lot of them were side effects of drugs. They were not 
eating well but still took their blood pressure medication and fell down and fractured a hip, or they were 
not eating well but they were taking their insulins, or things like that. I covered that unit for three 
months and it perked my curiosity: “Wonder why we are seeing so many?” I did a chart review and then 
realize that the drug-related side effects were leading to hospitalizations and emergency department 
visits, way more than what we ever imagined. So, me and a pharmacist, we started tracking the 
admissions and the bad outcomes that were related to medications. One thing led to the other that in 
three months, we realized that there were so many happening that we needed to actually track the data 
electronically and not manually count. That was in 2016. In 2017, we submitted our findings to the VHA 
Under Secretary Chapter Competition, and we won the Chapter Competition as a kind of a promising 
practice. Fast forward: In 2018, they wanted to make it a national-wide practice, so I came up with the 
mnemonic V-I-O-N-E. Look at medications: are they vital and important or are they optional, not 
indicated, and does every medicine have a reason why they need to be taken? So, it is V-I-O-N-E. One 
thing led to the other, it just grew, and right now, after five years, my medication de-prescribing 
program that I started on a 15-bed unit, that program is being practiced in 101 VA programs. To date, 
we stopped about 720,000 medications in over 320,000 veterans, and the cost savings has been $48.2 
million dollars. I feel kind of happy about it, that something which started on such a small scale and now 
it is on our CPRS records. Most people in the country know about medication de-prescribing and 
[unintelligible, maybe ‘my own’] program, so that has been a very rewarding experience. Again, I feel 
very indebted to the VA for allowing us to submit an idea and then win the program. They just stood out 
of the way and let us do so. We do not have any oversight committee. We do not have anybody telling 
what we should do. It is just a core group of six people. Three of us do the work, the day-to-day work, 
and so that is my most rewarding [unintelligible]. I give you long-winded answers but [laughs]--
