FIELDNOTES:

Acadian vernacular architecture in the St.  John River valley,   
Aroostook County,  Maine,  with emphasis on
  
buildinq technoloqy and patterns of the nineteenth century
  
I.  Field research day one,  06-24-91  (Monday)  
1.  Arrived at Bangor,  Maine,  from Columbia,  Missouri.
 Checked
 
out Avis rental car and drove northward to the Eagle Lake
 
research team lodgings  (Phil Brown house).
 It was a long and
 
difficult series of plane changes and flights from Columbia to
 
Bangor.
 Arrived at Eagle Lake c.  9.00 p. m.
 
These fieldnotes may not always make the best example of
 
English grainmer and construction,  but rather than fuss over this,
 
I' m going to go ahead and scribble to get the information down.
 
2.  I noticed some interesting features of the landscape and the
 
architecture in traveling north into Aroostook County.
 I was
 
impressed with the "north Maine woods"  as I drove from Bangor
 
into Aroostook County and the Eagle Lake field team lodgings.
 
The town of Ashland on Hwy.  11 s.  of Eagle Lake  (on the s.
 
edge of the study area)  has a big sign saying "Gateway to the
 
North Maine Woods."
 There is a lumberman's museum there.
 In
 
Maine,  it is  "lumbering," while out west it is  "logging"  -
-
 for
 
commercial harvest and management of forest lands,  mainly in
 
Maine by private corporations  (as opposed to ownership and
 
management,  with harvesting agreements,  by the U.S.  Forest
 
Service out west).
 
Preliminary thouqhts and basic  information. 
This corner of
 
Maine will be very interesting.
 Relatively little research in
 
architecture has been done here,  though some good work exists on
 
the New Brunswick side of the river in Canada.
 
When the Acadians settled here in the 17th century  (1624?),
 
they were simply moving across a "Nova Scotia"  river into another
 
part of the territory owned by Great Britain....
 
Maine was probably "discovered"  (if you will)  by the
 
-1-
Marshall  fieldnotes 06-24-91  (Monday)  p.2
 
Norsemen in the 11th century....
 That expedition was under the
 
leadership of Leif Ericsson.
 They explored the Canadian coast in
 
several places and built a short-lived settlement on Newfoundland
 
that they called "Vinland."
 What would things have been like if
 
the Norsemen had returned to North American and established
 
themselves  (vs.  Columbus  1492  claims for Spain,  etc.)?
 
1530s,  Cartier explores Canada and St.  Lawrence region and
 
gets the French going in the area.  .
 .
 .
 (1584 Raleigh finds
 
Virginia  (named for Elizabeth);  1607 Jamestown,  Va.;  1620
 
Plimouth Plantation,  Mass.).
 1608,  Champlain founds Quebec.
 
1623  British establish first settlements in Nova Scotia;  in 1624,
 
first settlements in Maine made by French.
 1673,  Jolliet and
 
Marquette explore Upper Mississippi River by coming down from
 
Canada  (LaSalle claims the valley for France and names it
 
Louisiana,  after King Louis XIV,  1678-82).  .
 .
 .
 1754-63  French
 
and Indian War  (part of larger Seven Years War in Europe),
 
English and Indian allies capture Quebec 1759;  France loses all
 
territories in North America east of Mississippi River.
 1774
 
Quebec Act sets up colonial government in Canada and makes
 
special provisions favoring the French-speaking population.
 1818
 
U.S.-Canada border established  (but not really);  1820 Maine
 
became a state of the U.S.  to balance Missouri's entry into the
 
union as a "slave state"  (Missouri Compromise).
 1842 Webster-
Ashburton Treaty finally fixes the boundary between New Brunswick
 
and Maine.
 1867 Britain sets up Dominion of Canada with
 
provinces of Quebec,  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,  and Ontario.
 
3.  At the Eagle Lake field team lodcrings, I discussed the
 
project's progress with Ray Brassieur and David Whitman
 
(henceforth "RB" and "DWI').
 
RB introduced me to the rented laptop computer,  and I will
 
be using this at night to scribble down the day's notes.
 Later,
 
each day's typed notes can be melded with the spoken notes that I
 
will make using my little Sony cassette recorder as I drive in
 
the car.
 RB told me about Archive software  (I also have the
 
materials David Taylor)  sent),  but I doubt that I will have time
 
to learn the Archive software;  it seems to me to be a better use
 
of my time to work quickly in WP5.O in the few days I have in the
 
valley.
 Later,  I can put my notes,  logs,  etc.  into Archive back
 
in Columbia.
 
To get working with the laptop:  (1)  turn it on to boot the
 
machine,  (2)  type RUSTY at the C prompt,  (3)  when the menu
 
appears,  type X to move into WP5.0 software;  when finished,  (4)
 
exit with F7 key.
 This is the software I use regularly,  so I am
 
going to find this very handy while here in Maine.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-24-91  (Monday)  p.3
 
RB has scouted buildings for me to study and he has made
 
contact with owners,  etc.
 I will depend on RB's notes for names
 
/ addresses later and depend on RB and DW to help when they can.
 
4.  Note on my research. 
since my time can only be spent in
 
photographing and recording a selection of buildings,  it will be
 
important to have reference to the research of others later on.
 
My fieldnotes will be very much enhanced by the historical
 
information,  family history,  etc.  that can be obtained by other
 
members of the research team.
 Thus,  in the category of "history"
 
in my fieldnotes,  that sort of information needs to be thought of
 
as tentative,  and hopefully the fieldnotes can be corrected as
 
necessary later on.
 
The additional research  (history of individual buildings,
 
family stories,  etc.)  can be very helpful to should I decide to
 
write something for publication based on my architectural field
 
research.
 I may well do so,  and at minimum I will probably
 
develop a conference paper from my work in this project.
 
August 28,  1991:  
PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research, we were thinking of
 
Piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombaqe
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of piece-sur-piece. distinguished by
 
horizontal log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombage (which is characterized by vertical log
 
construction).
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre; Moogk references.)
 
Thus,  the above comments SUPERSEDE references in the
 
following fieldnotes -- that could not be corrected due to the
 
pressure of the deadline for fieldnote submission.
 
Also,  please note that my Glossary (fieldnotes appendix)  has
 
been corrected to reflect our latest evaluations as stated above.  
(not in field notes,  but on NOTES-l.hwm doc.)

II.  Field research dav two,  06-25-91  (Tuesday)  
The Fred Albert House 
Date of construction ca.  1840-1845.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.2
 
MAP-HM-F062591. A  (Maine Acadian Project,  Howard Marshall,  June 6,
 
1991,  portion A)
 
After some orientation to the Fort Kent field team office and
 
related matters pertaining to the project,  I began my study of
 
the Acadian buildings in our target area with a careful
 
examination and recording  (including photography,  some of it by
 
DW and RB)  of "the Fred Albert house" in the St.  David community
 
south of Madawaska on U.S.  Highway 1.
 
The Fred Albert House  (Albert is pronounced "al-bear")
 
proved to be an excellent building to begin with,  because the
 
house has been converted into a museum.
 While this means that
 
the house was moved from its original site  (nearby farmstead),  it
 
also means that we could inspect the building completely and
 
without disturbing occupants.

The house is a "Georgian plan" central hall house,  two rooms
 
deep  (double pile),  gable roof,  central chimney,  gallery porch on
 
front, boxed-in stairway,  panelled doors,  built-in armoires
  
(cupboards),  etc.
 It is made of white pine entirely,  contains
 
old Acadian colors  (sang de beouf / armoire rouge; blue; grey
 
qris) and a lovely thing it is indeed.
 
I will have more to say about French terms like sang de
  
beouf and qris in the glossary I am preparing as an appendix to
 
the fieldnotes.
 In my fieldnotes, my spellings may be in error.
 
Ray Brassieur is vastly helpful in this regard,  being a native
 
speaker of French.
 
The Fred Albert House is inportant in a number of ways. 
It
 
has significance for the settlement history and cultural
 
landscape of the area.
 It is an early log house and has
 
significance in terms of its fine use of traditional technology
 
walling and half-dovetail corners),  and it has significance in
 
terms of its "type"  in the varieties of vernacular houses in the
 
St. John valley.

Then we get to the surprising part when we get down to the
 
plates.
 There are wind braces in all four corners which I've
 
seen although these are let into and across the tops of the
 
lifter couples in a very nice way.
 The four wind braces are also
 
hewn although they look like one side is sawn and the other side
 
is hewn,  squared off.
 
(FROM MY CASSETTE TAPE RECORDED DURING OUR EXAMINATION OF
 
THE BUILDING:
 
(Brassieur: 
As for r.fter couple,  are you talking about
 
both pieces?
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.4
 
(Marshall: 
Yes,  .
.
.
 so this house has 9 couples.
 
(Brassieur: 
Are the couples two pieces here?
 Yes.  (HM)
 
So it's interesting to note that each pair of rafters is
 
compound,  in other words each rafter is compound on top of that
 
couple.
 
(Marshall: 
.
.
.
 there's where you get an interesting
 
permutation.
 Rather than having the foot of the rafter cut into
 
to let itself overhang the plate,  the principal rafters are
 
stopped at the plate and tenoned and pegged to the plate.
 
(Brassieur: 
Here's the interesting part....
 Despite the
 
ample amount of joinery in this building,  the rafters sit flush
 
upon the plate,  they're not let into the plate.
 
(Marshall: 
Spike-size nails,  some square and some round,
 
hold the rafter feet instead of joinery.
 
(Brassieur: 
.
.
.
 compound rafters were common in Quebec -
-
because they allow for that long neuf  (spelling? -
-
 check this
  
later) 
-
-
 the ski slope -
-
 that was a piece that extended the
 
rafter that allowed that eave to curve....)
 
We examine the vertical columns  (colombage). 
.
.
.
 we see
 
the coulisse (grooves in the columns,  for receiving the ends of
 
the horizontal pieces).
 
This is a an important building;  it's ideal for a Historic
 
American Buildings Survey Team for a summer drawing project.
 
The gable bent of the house:
 horizontal log planks  (4" x 8-
12")  -
-
 these are the n
iadrier of the building.
 As the madriers
  
rise in this building....
 In the center of each gable and
 
twice on the long walls,  there is a vertical column into which
 
the madriers are let .
.
.
 but the CORNERS are joined in half-
dovetail joints.
 Then the vertical boards are added over the
 
madriers (called planche debout).
 
Claude Cyr pronounces planche debout as "planzh'  deboot'."
 
The center columns terminate at the girt.
 Top of the column
 
has a tongue that goes through a mortise through the girt  (we
 
tried to sketch this):
 this is a crucial ingredient in
 
understanding this kind of Acadian technology and joinery.
 The
 
joint is different in the gables / girts than in the long sides,
 
where they have ship's knees against them.
 
The girts were cut into to add c.  1900 windows.

This area is NOT an attic; this is NOT a German kind of
 
building,  but a British  (or Anglo-American)  kind of building,  if
 
you will -
-
 that is,  people live in the attic.
 I' m not saying
 
the area is an English thing,  I' m just commenting on it.
 
This area was divided into two rooms -
-
 segregated sleeping
 
spaces,  large spaces,  for boys and girls.
 Each sex had a
 
separate stairway; girls had a fancy open stair from the hallway,
 
and boys had a closed boxed stair  (medieval)  in the back corner
 
next to the back door of the house.
 
Vertical wooden pins lock the madriers and stabilize them.
 
The pins are spaced 4-5 feet apart to help stabilize the vertical
 
sheer of the walls.
 
(Brassieur: 
.
.
.
 In Louisiana,  this part of the house has a
 
name -
-
 the qarconniere (spelling?),  because that's where the
 
boys slept....)
 
We see where there were four ship's knees total,  two on each
 
side of the house  (front and rear).
 There were drift pins in all
 
four ship's knees to secure them as braces against plates and top
 
of the walls.
 
In the St.  John valley,  we are seeinq,  to my surprise and to
 
my deliqht, dwellings  (the Fred Albert house is without parallel
 
in this moment)  in which piece construction employ columns  (en
 
colombage) at critical points in the bearing walls and also
 
employ half-dovetail cornering for the planked white pine logs.
 
Mirabile visu!
 Lovely stuff,  this.
 
I interviewed Mr.  Cyr with the little Sony cassette recorder
 
I use for spoken field notes.
 (The cassette interview will be
 
transcribed by my secretary, Ms.  Ying Zhou,  and edited by me,  and
 
will be appended to the end of this day's field notes.)

The Fournier-Chasse House 
Built ca.  1840.
 
MAP-HM-F062591. B
 
Situated next to the Madawaska Historical Society grounds
 
(located,  by the way,  just uphill from the river and location of
 
the white cross marking the first landing of the Acadian settlers
 
and their reception by the Maine Indian people),  is,  on its
 
original site and its original farmstead context,  the Fournier-
Chasse house.
 
This house is in the same essential mode as the Fred Albert
 
House,  only it has brick cladding all around it,  and new rooms
 
added as well.
 I can't determine,  however,  if the house has
 
half-dovetail cornering,  but apart from that is quite similar.
 
The house is also a piece-sur-piece en colombage house in
 
its construction.
 Its floor plan compares with the massing and
 
type exemplified by the Fred Albert house.
 
This house has been entirely sheathed in a veneer of red
 
brick.
 Taken with the additions and alterations to the house,
 
the red brick exterior fools us -
-
 we do not know of its piece 
soul until we are invited to see the house by owners,  Mr.  and
 
Mrs.  Ernest Chasse.
 
Like the Albert house this one's pieces are of hewn white
 
pine.
 Broad axe marks are visible on the logs / pieces.
 
This is a house that I hope DW and RB will return to for
 
some careful detail photography.
 For example,  the pieces are
 
insulted with buckwheat chaff from the farm itself.
 Trunnels,
 
roof construction.
 
RB says the buckwheat chaff is more like caulking or
 
insulation than it is like chinking we'd see in other kinds of
 
log buildings.

Fort Kent 
Built c.  1840.
 
code MAP-HM-F06259l. C
 
This is the National Historic Landmark,  the original structure
 
dating from 1840....
 It was extensively reconstructed,  and the
 
roof was rebuilt,  but it is understood and interpreted
 
nevertheless to exhibit the original wall construction.
 I think
 
it's right,  too.
 
This is the only remaining "fort" or log garrison house in
 
the region.
 It's a curious but peachy thing.
 
Photographed the beast.
 This should be in any standard
 
slide show that wants to introduce main themes in vernacular
 
building in the St. John.
 
(Later in the field trip I'll try to save some time to
 
record the building.)
 
Ca va bien. 
This was a fine but exhausting day.  .
 .
 .
 I had a
 
good headache much of the day as a result of the tremendous
 
vibration in the little planes I crouched in from Columbia to St.
 
Louis and then Boston to Bangor on June 24  .
 .
 .
 ; my
 
prescription does a good job of warding of the mega-headaches
 
that can develop from preliminary ones.
 
In the evenings during this trip,  I plan to write the day's
 
comments and get started on my field notes using the rented
 
Toshiba lap top computer at the Eagle Lake field team lodgings.
 
It's quite good,  and virtually identical to the Zenith Supersport
 
286 I have at home.
 
The landscape where these houses were originally situated. 
From
 
talking with Mr.  Cyr and from looking at the lay of the land,  and
 
from talking with RB,  etc.,  it appears that the bulk of the early
 
French houses were built in "the flats" -
-
 the low-lying
 
relatively gently sloping land between the St.  John River and the
 
point at which the land begins to steeply rise  (at the hills
 
where the "back settlements" or "concessions" were situated)
 
Today,  the U.S.  highway 1 runs along the middle of the flats
 
in most places.
 In most places,  probably the earliest farms and
 
houses were located between the road and the river.

Transcription of Howard Marshall  interview  (cassette)  with Mr.  
Claude  (Blackie)  Cyr,  Madawaska,  Maine,  06-25-91
  
Transcribed 07-09-91 by Ms.  Ying Zhou  (University of Missouri
 
Cultural Heritage Center)  and edited by Marshall.
 Special terms
 
are underlined,  as are certain words or ideas I wish to highlight
 
for analytical purposes later.
 Some spellings may be in error.
 
The interview took place at the Fred Albert house maintained
 
by the Madawaska Historical Society.
 This is an important house
 
in my study of Acadian vernacular buildings.
 
I believe Ray Brassieur previous to this day obtained the
 
relevant personal data on Mr.  Cyr.
 Mr.  Cyr is a leader in the
 
Madawaska community and a lovely chap.
 Short in stature,  white
 
hair that used to be black,  cheerful,  ruddy.
 
Mr.  Cyr exhibits an interesting speaking quirk that seems to
 
be a traditional mannerism here -
-
 or least I've noticed it in
 
talking with some older Acadian-American people in the area.
 He
 
punctuates his statements when affirming an idea or statement
 
with a sucking in of air at the same time he says "yeah."
 So
 
it's an interesting piece of vernacular speaking.
 
Marshall: 
.
 .
 .
 You were saying a little bit about how the
 
house was originally located on a farm near Madawaska and
 
you all moved it here and reconstructed it at a certain
 
time.
 I' m sure Ray has documentation on the actual history
 
of this house,  but is there anything that you could add to
 
what has already been collected or known?
 
Mr.  Claude "Blackie" Cyr: 
Well,  the only thing that I possibly
 
could add would be that this house was located on a farm
 
that can trace its history back to when the original land
 
grant from 1792 and the farm and this house has remained in
 
the Albert family continuously,  the straight line of
 
succession.
 
And back about 1976 I believe the year was when the
 
last people that lived in here Fred Elmore,  Cathrine Bayer
 
(spelling? pronounce Catherine =
 katrina)  were all gone.
 
Elmore who was the man that inherited the house had it,  you
 
know,  in his possession for a while and taxes got to be a
 
problem,  so he decided to tear it down.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.9
 
And one fine day at noon time on my way back from work
 
I noticed part of the roof was being taken off.
 So I
 
immediately ran to see him and he was still convinced that
 
he probably should tear it down.
 So I said,  "Well,  so be
 
it."
 
Then I walked across the street to my mother-in-law's
 
house who was Elmore's mother,  and we got to talking and she
 
said,  "Do you really think that there is something in that
 
old house that's worth saving?"
 I said,  "I don't know,  but
 
my opinion is that it's certainly,  it's worth saving.
 
There's architecture,  the way this house was made.
 I've
 
never seen another one made just like it."
 
She said,  "I could get Elmore to stop that.
 He'll
 
stop.
 Don't worry.
 He won't tear it down."
 So she called
 
him and he came over and we talked for a while and he said,
 
"All right,  if you think it's worth saving.
 But you're
 
going to have to move it. "
 
So he gave us a deed to the old house that year  (I' m
 
pretty sure it was 1976)  and we had to leave it on site for
 
about two years.
 But finally we were able to gather up
 
enough funds to move it.
 And it stayed in this stage for
 
another three years.
 We had a little bit more money.
 So
 
every year we pulled in a little bit more money.
 We finally
 
got enough money to place the house on sonnett tubes where
 
it would be secure and all the years we've brought it back
 
to what we see today.
 
Marshall: 
It's a property that now belongs more or less to the
 
people of Madawaska?
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  primarily the Madawaska Historical Society.
 
Marshall: 
What do people think about it when they see the house?
 
Cyr: 
I think most of them that I happened to be in the house
 
with are people who have a knowledge of history and
 
appreciation for it.
 The official opening,  by the way,  for
 
the Albert home, was only last year and we had a fairly gala
 
affair.
 Of course they were all people who had a history in
 
the back of their heads.
 They all marvelled at the
 
construction of the house and the way that we were able to
 
preserve it.
 Awful glad we did it.
 
Marshall: 
Everything is white pine,  and this white pine used to
 
be right around here.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.10
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  construction of white pine,  right around here.
 Most
 
of the furniture that we find in the house today was,  had
 
origins in this house,  although like the old cupboard was in
 
the shed in the back.
 But there are still family members
 
that remembered very well that it was in the house.
 
Marshall: 
Does that have a special name in French for the ox-
blood-colored pine cupboard?
 That surely has some kind of
 
special French name.
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  it has a French name and it's called an armoire. 
The
 
red is rouge -
-
 armoire rouqe. 
So,  I think amongst the
 
people who appreciate history that old red means a lot.
 
The old red and the old blue,  I suppose are the most
 
favorite early colors.
 But that one certainly is a
 
sweetheart according to me.
 
Marshall: 
What does the color signify to the Acadian people,
 
something special?
 
Cyr: 
Well,  I' m not sure that it has a significance.
 The only
 
thing that I can tell you is that it would appear that
 
brighter colors were kind of being appreciated.
 We see that
 
in the red next to the armoire,  we see the old table which
 
is also in the old red.
 Many of the old spinning wheels and
 
things of that nature were old red too.
 The red seems to be
 
a favorite color.
 
Marshall: 
You were mentioning the blue too.
 What shade of blue
 
is that?
 
Cyr: 
I am not sure if I have a name.
 I call it the old blue
  
which is today kind of hard to duplicate.
 It's not the
 
light blue on the wall.
 The spinning wheel here is a prime
 
example of what I called the old blue.
 It probably has a
 
mixture of blue and black because it is extremely dark blue.
 
Marshall: 
You might call it royal blue.
 
Cyr: 
Yes  .
 .
 .
 .
 It's close.
 
Marshall: 
There is another color I've noticed  .
 .
 .
 .
 That's a
 
particular shade of gray that I've seen on houses.
 About
 
every other pickup truck I see is the old red and gray.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.11
 
Cyr: 
I am not sure if I am qualified to comment on that.
 I just
 
know that it's kind of popular.
 I know you are right about
 
that.  As a matter of fact we painted it here  (the house)
 
gray.
 We reconstructed it gray.
 Although you may see in
 
some spots the original painting was gray but it turned it
 
is quite darker gray than what we have now.
 
Marshall: 
The floor was never covered nor painted.  .
 .
 .
 Do you
 
suppose these floors are tongue-and-groove?
 
Cyr: 
It's kind of hard to tell.
 But I think they are tongue-
and-groove.
 You probably will see a little bit better over
 
here.
 It's the same dark.
 The only problem is this floor
 
never got much ware as that one.
 That one was a well
 
travelled area and this one here probably was closed off
 
most of the time to the kids  .
 .
 .
 .
 [in the front hail
 
way]
 
Marshall: 
How were these room were used basically?
 We are in
 
the front hallway.
 The house was oriented at one point
 
toward the road.
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  right on,  towards the road,  and facing almost directly
 
north.
 Right on.
 
Marshall: 
Facing north.
 You are coming into the front door and
 
you are in a rather broad hallway.
 If you come as a
 
visitor,  how do you know where to go?
 The kitchen is too
 
straight ahead.
 The dining area is this big open area,  the
 
wood stove right in front of us.
 Straight back is the boys'
 
stairway upstairs.
 Upstairs had a partition down the
 
middle.
 The boys in the far end of the west side and the
 
girls in the east side.
 They have their own stairway.
 But
 
their stairway is fancy,  it's got a bannister and everything
 
and the boys had the old Middle Ages-looking door,  that's
 
kind of neat.
 
Cyr: 
Of course to our right was the main parlor which was
 
probably used only for real special occasions.
 I remember
 
it was partly closed most of the time.
 It would have been
 
an elaborate room of the house.
 (HM:  The floor is even much
 
nicer.
 They did not get much wear.)
 I think they paid
 
special attention to put the best boards here,  too,  there's
 
no question.
 
Marshall: 
What were in this hallway that petitions between the
 
rooms are just one board thick vertical pine boards set
 
flush -
-
 but they are tongue-and-groove rather than flush.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.12
 
Cyr: 
Some of them .
 .
 .
 were cut in reconstruction,  just in some
 
places,  but they were all in tongue-and-groove  (originally).
 
Marshall: 
Do you have a term for that kind of construction?
 
çvr: 
C'est la planche debout in French, which means upright
 
board in French.  *
 That's what it was called here in the
  
French country. 
The only thing that he did I suppose was to
 
make a separation.
 It serves no structural purpose for
 
weight-bearing walls or anything of that nature.  It's just a
 
separation of rooms.
 
Marshall: 
These are just nailed into the ceiling and floor down
 
here,  whatever size you wanted.
 The outside,  of course,  is
 
the horizontal logs.
 
Cyr: 
That's right.
 The boards covered those horizontal logs.
 
Logs are pit-sawed pieces.  .
 .
 .
 They are both four inches
 
thick,  some of them are like the width of the boards here -
-
17 or 18  inches wide.
 
Marshall: 
They are sawn square on all sides.
 Do they fit,  flat,
 
flush down on them on top of each other?
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  they fit,  flat down,  flush on each other and we have
 
those columns that they slide into. 
Those are the control
 
columns.
 
Marshall: 
So the ends of the horizontal boards have tongues on
 
them.
 In the other words it broke kind of like the floor
 
with the groove going up vertically in the post.
 
Cyr: 
Today you could actually go back there and lift through the
 
pieces from the side and slide them right off the top.
 
Apparently they were just slid down from the top when the
 
house was being built.
 
Marshall: 
Now the corners,  what about corners?
 
Cyr: 
Corners are kind of unique.
 I am not sure that it is a
 
unique building,  but I have never seen it somewheres else.
 
They are actually half dovetails. 
Actually half of those
 
wide pieces that we're talking about are on the dovetail and
 
make corner the dovetail from the side butts  (155)  to the
 
dovetail from the longitude end.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.13
 
Marshall: 
That seems very,  very unusual to me.
 I've never seen
 
it before -- but then I've never been to St.  John Valley
 
before either.
 
Cyr: 
It's not common in St.  
 
John
 
but it would appear that I
t
here was quite a craftsman . . . .  I am not aware of any
 
other house that was built that's exactly like this.

Cvr: 
I am not sure that there were people old enough to rememb
 
exactly what the construction was . . . .  Before we starte
 
opening up the walls,  it would appear that the constructio
 
was amazing.
 Even the last people who lived here might no
 
have been aware.
 I 
Marshall: 
The architectural historians have their terms -- but
 
there aren't always the terms the people use.
 I am more
 
interested in the terms that people use.
 
Cvr: 
In the outside we see clapboard.
 I'm sure that it's safe
 
to say that was long time that this house was without
 
clapboards.
 It's upright boards -- the Planche debout -- on
 
the outside wall.
 You can see in some of the places the
 
boards were not long enough to go from bottom to the top of
 
the house,  and they have a split 45 -- where the top board
 
fits on the bottom board so as to shed the water.
 It's kind
 
of unique but we cannot see it now because it is covered up
 
with clapboards.
 
Marshall: 
So some later generation added the clapboards.
 I
 
wonder why they did that?
 
Cvr: 
I'm not sure.

Marshall: 
And there were the old-time windows.
 They were not
 
casement windows.
 They were sash.
 Didn't the really early
 
Acadians had some casement windows?
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.14
 
Cyr: 
Yes,  I' ve seen some casement windows in this area.
 But I'm
 
not sure what the reasons were that they had this sash
 
windows.
 
Marshall: 
I don't think we've seen any casement windows since
 
we've been here.
 Let's see, we might mention the comb-
graining on the wall. 
That is beautiful.
 
Cyr: 
.
 .
 .
 I've seen other graining  .
 .
 .
 .
 But this one here
 
had to be an almost artist.
 
Marshall: 
What was his name?
 
Cyr: 
.
 .
 .
 I don't have the name of the artist although we have
 
the name of the builder. 
If I remember it correctly,  his
 
name is  .
 .
 .
 .  (203)
 
Marshall: 
It's actually penciled here on this post in the front
 
of the house.
 You can read better than I.
 It looks like
 
son of Nores Albert  .
 .
 .
 Is that E.  H.  fils de, son of
 
Nores  (212)  ?
 
Cyr: 
There has to be something in the front.
 It looks like
 
Hebert. 
.
 .
 .
 I think we wrote that down somewhere here.
 
Marshall: 
.
 .
 .
 It did not happen to have a date penciled on
 
there.
 
Cyr: 
No,  there was no date.
 The only other thing is that the
 
geometry figure on that pole  (in the parlor).
 Somebody
 
probably sat here and had lunch on noon and exercised  .
 
Marshall: 
With a compass,  sure  .
 .
 .
 .
 The symbol is a pretty
 
symbol,  you can see frequently in the various kinds of arts.
 
A lot of initials.
 
Cyr: 
(231)  Those have been covered up.  (232)
 
Marshall: 
Does anybody happen to remember how deep these things
 
were?  (the post)
 
Cyr: 
If I remember correctly,  those are 8 inches.
 
Marshall: 
I noted the measurement  .
 .
 .
 .
 That's a solid piece
 
of tree,  white pine.(239)
 That's the tree that made this

Later years of course,  we have the St.  John River right
 
in back of us here.
 And one of the first cash crops that
 
the farmer had that year would be pine -- here they call it
 
wood ton: wood sold by the ton.
 It wasn't sold by the board
 
foot as we know it today.)
 It was just big squared-off
 
beams that would float down the river to St.  John's,  New
 
Marshall: 
How would they get it down to the river?
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.16
 
Cyr: 
Well,  I suppose most of the time they'd try to cut those
 
near brooks.
 In spring the water is high.
 They try to
 
drive them through the big streams down through the river.
 
But I suppose I has been known that they have oxen.
 They
 
might have been pulling to the water.
 It's much easier to
 
skiddinq on the snow than on the ground.
 
Marshall: 
Is that the old blue also?
 
Cyr: 
That's a little bit different version of blue.
 It is a
 
little bit lighter,  but probably they have missed the recipe
 
when they mixed up  .
 .
 .
 a lovely cradle.
 .
 
Marshall: 
.
 .
 .
 All of this is interesting to me as a stranger.
 
I' m just going to shut this off,  unless you have
 
any words for the wise  .
 .
 .
 .
 What's your family motto?
 
What's the Cyr family motto?
 
Cyr: 
I don' t that know there is one.
 
Marshall: 
There ought to be some dazzling French phrase  .
 .
 
Cyr: 
There is probably a lot of nicknames the Cyrs have been
 
called.
 There have been Cyro  (312 spelling?)  because the
 
one the old man says is really strong on maple-syrup.
 He
 
could consume a lot of it.
 And there was the croque. *
 As
 
a matter of fact,  croque, even on some legal papers,
 
supplemented the Cyr name and croque, which means to bit,  to
 
vigorously bite. 
I don't suppose you ever read the little
 
book I put together for the Cyr family reunion,  but I talked
 
about a little.
 It was the person who petitioned the crown
 
for land grant in this area.  .
 .
 He'd making maple sugar
 
and offered to people here to chew on.
 He became to be
 
known as Jean-Baptiste Croque.
 Even to this day we hear
 
Croque.  .
 .
 .
 Nicknames are real big.
 
Marshall: 
.
 .
 .
 In the upstairs which I haven' t measured yet,  a
 
couple of things that caught my attention were what Ray
 
called ship's knees. 
These are pretty unusual.
 What are
 
their purpose?
 
Cyr:
 In this instance,  I believe that if you look at it,  there
 
was one thing that this house could do.
 It would have been
 
nothing in the extreme,  but it could have opened up.
 I
 
believe these ship's knees made  .
 .
 .
 because they catch on
 
some of the members that crossed over here and they keep
 
everything very tight together.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-25-91  (Tuesday),  p.17
 
Marshall: 
That's just another strengthening . . . like with the
 
wind braces in the corners  . . . .  It would take a heck of
 
a storm to do anything to this house . . . . storm.
 
,
Cvr: 0 . . .  When we moved it here,  contracted to do the moving
 
f the house.
 He had a trailer that he says he even carries
 
brick houses.
 And he said this is heavier than a brick
 
house.
 He popped it on the wheels.
 When we turned in here,
 
POW!  the wheel just blew out.
 
Marshall: 
Is there a special term for the  (panelled)  ceilings?
 
Cvr: 
There probably is,  but I don't know.
 
End of the interview with Mr.  Claude Cyr
  
* NOTA BENE:
 We wondered whether some people in the valley
 
were beginning to pick up French technical words and terms from
 
conversations with Ray Brassieur; not a bad thing at all,  but
 
we'd like to know this.
 RB said that Mr.  Cyr probably picked up
 
this term from one of their discussions of the house.
 
** In a standard Cassell's French Dictionarv. croque means
 
"crackling,  crunching" and croquer "to crack between the teeth."
 
(213)  (The Collins is probably a better French dictionary,  but I
 
have a Cassell's handy.)

III.  Field research day three,  06-26-91  (Wednesday)  
1.  Breakfast at the Eagle Lake shack.
 
The weather is ideal  for architectural research,  with sun
 
and warmth but lots of clouds here and there.
 The famous  "black
 
flies" are trying to live up their nefarious reputation.
 Bug
 
spray with "deet" helps ward the pesky little buggers off,  as
 
does doping yourself with Avon "Skin So Soft"  lotion.
 
I am not able to recover function in the second Canon T-90
 
camera body.
 The "stopped down"  switch is malfunctioning,  the
 
system locks up,  won't work in any mode.
 DW has kindly offered
 
me the use of his Canon AT body,  which I will use henceforth for
 
my slide photography.
 I will use the working Canon T-90 for
 
black-and-white,  thinking that this may need the most critical
 
attention in terms of potential uses and reports eventually
 
prepared incorporating my photos of historic buildings,  etc.
 
2.  To Fort Kent field office;  met Lisa Ornstein; did some office
 
stuff;  laid out the day.

3.  To Clair,  New Brunswick
 
We crossed the St.  John River,  passing through Canadian Customs
 
(border check) ; we head for the nearby historic site known as the
 
"Maison Daigle St.  Jean "  
Maison Daigle St.  Jean 
Date of construction ca.  1848.
 
MAP-HM-F062691. A
 
This is another moved and reconstructed house  (re:  Fred Albert
 
House, Madawaska),  this time by the Clair Historical Society,
 
Inc.  in 1984.
 Also white pine,  but a fancier house by a good
 
deal in comparison with the Fred Albert House.  
This house is also what we're thinking of as the St.  John
 
Valley Acadian cottage "type" of vernacular dwelling.
 It has an
 
essential Georgian plan -
-
 two rooms deep / double pile;  central
 
hallway from which "parlors" are entered;  central chimney;  one or
 
one-and-one-half stories high; gable roof.
 
Across the St. John River in New Brunswick,  this house
 
compare wells with those I' m seeing in Aroostook County  (St.  John
 
valley Acadian cottages).
 They share their general house type /
 
plan and they share in the use of Acadian piece-sur-piece en
 
colombage construction.
 Their construction bears important
 
affinities,  in construction and use of vertical hewn pine
 
columns,  etc.
 However,  in the Maison Daigle St.  Jean, the
 
corners have vertical corner posts with coulisses (grooves)
 
instead of the half-dovetailing I saw at the Albert House
 
(Madawaska).
 
I recorded this house in some detail,  and it was
 
photographed by RB and DW.
 Here I was able to get under to
 
sketch the house's floor system.
 RB and DW also helped in the
 
architectural recording by each studying one of the salient
 
features of the wooden joinery visible clearly in the second
 
story and roof area.
 
This is a tremendous example and it measures within several
 
inches of the Albert house that we looked at yesterday across the
 
river at St.  David  (Madawaska)  -
-
 the symmetry;  the exterior
 
measurements are within three inches of the same.
 
There are several lovely elements that cause me to set this
 
house on a little higher shelf than the Albert House in terms of
 
the ambition of the detailing.
 This one seems to have the sort
 
of surrounding fan-lights or side lights around the front hail,
 
front doorway,  that was described by Mr.  Blackie Cyr as having
 
been part of the Fred Albert House in our work yesterday.
 
Marshall  fieldnotes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.3
 
So here we' re seeing a reconstructed and moved example like
 
we saw yesterday.
 It's fairly easy to detect the reconstructed
 
part of this house.
 
It's a beautiful shade of blue gray.
 It's a shade we see on
 
furniture and on other places; with white trim.
 The doorway is
 
kind of a party of styles getting together and engrossed in each
 
other, with no really clear architectural style,  according to the
 
architectural surveyor's checklist.
 But it is a vernacular house
 
with a number of styles working quite nicely side by side.
 This
 
one also seems to have the six over four sash that were described
 
by Mr.  Blackie Cyr have been the original in the Albert House.
 
(The may be reconstructions,  however.)
 It's nice to see some of
 
that kind of sash.
 
It has what might be called Greek Revival pilasters at the
 
corners of the house.
 They painted out the pilasters in blue to
 
match the exterior walls,  but they probably were painted in a
 
contrasting color with little carved wooden capitals at the top
 
-- really lovely details lost because of the way they repainted.
 
They aren't visible.
 
So federal,  Georgian,  neoclassical details are on view here
 
in a really fine St.  John Valley French house.
 It does have
  
those curves under the window in that little sewn piece of
  
gingerbread. 
The shape of that which will show up in the
 
photographs is the kind you buy in a lumberyard in Missouri or

The Acadian barn here. 
We talk about the Acadian carpenter
 
who helped reconstruct the barn on the outside.
 The barn has
 
been called grange pinion sanc (
350)  (spelling?).
 I classify the
 
barn together with Aroostook County barns as three-bay gabled-
roof barns,  the sort that were most common in the 19th century.
 
Ray says the reconstruction of the barn follows the models of a
 
barn that is supposedly an 1853 barn.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.4
 
It has some features that are characteristic of other barns
 
that we've seen in the area.
 The center bay is open,  the door is
 
open to allow the wagon to be brought into the middle of the barn
 
where the hay can be unloaded and stacked.
 
One bay or side of the opening is where the animals are
 
kept.
 In the part where the animal stayed,  the shakes  (shingles)
 
come up only to the height of 7-8 feet.
 Above that it's planks,
 
vertical planks.
 The shingles at the lower part were to keep the
 
animals warm.
 [Compare with Perreault barn,  etc.]
 Above that
 
since they stack hay up there,  that provided enough insulation.
 
That's exactly the way the shingles are put on that barn.
 They
 
only put up to certain height and above that they didn't put them
 
on.
 The shingles are also only on the part where the animals are
 
kept and on another part of the barn they didn't go to the
 
trouble of putting shakes on there.
 So evidently they realized
 
the extra insulation quality of those shingles.
 You used them to
 
protect animals.
 
Important question: 
How often and extensively were these Acadian
 
houses remodelled and expanded  (enlarged)  through the years?
 
How accurate are the "museum" reconstructions of historic
 
houses,  in terms of their original condition or size,  etc.?
 
4.  We return across the fine old qreen iron bridqe to Fort Kent
  
and have lunch at the Fort Kent Hotel,  the four of us. 
The
 
French fries were fine but the ham was out of can.
 The french
 
fries probably are made from taters grown locally.
 .
 
House typologies; the Acadian cottage... 
During lunch I'm
 
asked by Lisa Ornstein about the architecture I' m recording and
 
studying.
 She is interested to hear ideas and conclusions,  so I
 
give it a go.
 She also wants some basic rap on architectural
 
history and Acadian technology,  so I offer up some and in doing
 
so try to avoid going on record too soon with a name for the
 
Acadian house that Ray and I are identifying.
 
I will be developing a rap,  with RB,  to place these 19th
 
century wooden Acadian niece house in their own category in the
 
general typology of North American vernacular house types.
 I can
 
say -
-
 this early in the game -
-
 that the technology I'm seeing
 
(the joinery)  is magnificent.
 Indeed it's as fine as anything
 
I've seen anywhere.
 
There is of course a good deal of disagreement over
 
typologies and "names" for kinds of buildings.
 The terms that
 
the historic preservation crowd like are different from the terms
 
that I like,  for instance.
 They focus on facades and apparent

5.  The Aroostook County Potato house / shed
  
RB and I drive to look at Potato houses along the Bangor and
 
Aroostook Railroad line in Fort Kent.
 I photograph railroad
 
cars,  the potato sheds  (with concrete fire walls)  from ca.  1905
 
and after.

6.  We drive to Madawaska, stopping here and there for photographs
 
of buildings.
 . . .  Discuss architecture  . . . we're seeing 40
 
degree roof pitches.
 . . .  driving along Market Street,  next to
 
the Fort Kent railroad yards  (Bangor and Aroostook RR).
 . . .
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.6
 
(continued,  MARSHALL'S SECOND CASSETTE FIELD NOTES,  06-26-91)
 
Baskets. 
Old potato sheds here are rehabbed as various
 
kinds of shops and hardware stores,  etc.
 We see some good
  
baskets on Daigle & Sons.  Market St.  -
-
 made by Sara Lund and
  
some made by Harquail  (Fort Kent). 
Not of the high quality of
 
the Micmac baskets  .
 
Many of the old potato houses have burned,  so they learned
 
to build them with concrete firewalls between them.
 
Market Street was at one time lined with potato houses;  few are
 
left.
 Pitch on the roofs of the potato houses appears to be 40
 
degrees.
 
Some have gambrel roofs -
-
 the roof type that people here
 
call comb casse ("broken comb";  spelling?).
 The newer potato
 
houses have less of a pitch than the old ones.
 
Railroading came in here around the turn of the century.
 
Fences: 
croupje de peu (spelling?)  -
-
 split rails put
 
between two upright posts,  with wire fasteners.
 
7. We drive to Frenchville, where I photography the Frenchville
 
historical group's water tower and caboose.
 
MAP-HM-F062691.0
 
We stop at the Jesse Michaud store:  this an altered but nice
 
example of a rehabbed / rebuilt Georgian-Acadian cottage. 
It is
 
grey in color.
 Greek Revival trim.
 Central doorway  (hall);  some
 
are a little off center,  of course.
 
We learn from Mr.  Jesse Michaud that it is a "piece" house
 
(his term).
 This is comparable in adaptive use or reuse of an
 
old building for a neighborhood store to the instance of the
 
Plourdes family store at Soldier Pond on Hwy.  11.
 Like numerous
 
other Acadian houses,  this one has been substantially altered.
 
Potato seed knives. 
At the Frenchville store,  I spot some
 
peculiar manufactured knives,  and I ask about them; Messr.  Jesse
 
Michaud explains their use as "potato seed knives" used by the
 
potato workers to slice potatoes to get "seeds"  for planting in
 
the fields.
 You hold the knife at the edge of the table with the
 
blade up and move the potato through the knife blade.
 
RB and I each buy a knife  ($2.95; made in Canada);  see my
 
field notebook for a measured drawing of the knife.
 Thin steel
 
blade in blue plastic handle.
 Potato seed slices are about 1"
 
thick,  and that's all they need to plant potatoes.
 (Any potato
 
Marshall field notes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.7
 
can be planted in the ground with just a slice and it'll grow.

Upper Frenchville -- Frenchville. 
We talk about Frenchville
 
vs.  Upper Frenchville.
 People are very stern about which
 
community they live in.
 But they can't really say where one
 
stops and the next starts.
 They're side by side on Highway 1.
 
This is a fine-tuned sense of regional consciousness,  place,  etc.
 
Discussion of the local store -- an important ingredient in
 
the communities here.
 They're centers.
 They have everything you
 
might need,  including video rentals.
 Ray says in New Brunswick
 
they're called depanniers (quick stops / convenience store); but
 
they have much more stuff than American convenience stores,
 
including lots of homemade local foods fresh.
 
Discussion of sausage. 
Bright red link sausage they call
 
"hot dogs," but they are not hot dogs . . . .  They have a lot of
 
liver and other ground meat and are more like a pate.
 The local
 
stores butcher departments cut them apart and package them for
 
cust o
m e
r s.
 
Foodways will be important in the interpretation of the
 
region by the National Park Service.
 
7.  Historic preservation situation discussion:  "the qrand menage"
  
(annual cleaning up the house,  etc.)  
The French have a tradition of spring cleaning that goes quite
 
far beyond the standard concept of "spring 
.
,. .I IuP SLS
P 1 
They just
 
clean anyth
i
n g .
 
Ray says that he heard in a June 5 meeting -- his project's
 
advisory group that was set up -- Geraldine Chasse said "This is
 
the season of the grand menage. 
Everybody cleaning up -- house's
 
windows,  etc.
 CRB:  "the big upkeep."
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.8
 
They resurface every driveway with tar or asphalt  (the
 
winters are rough on the asphalt surface).
 I noticed people
 
still finishing up the re-tarring or resurfacing of their asphalt
 
driveways as I drove around the region;  this may the final piece
 
of the spring cleaning chores.
 
They take this time to demolish and sweep away any old
 
buildings that have fallen into disrepair and are no longer fit
 
or being used.
 
This tendency or custom has significant ramifications for
 
historic preservation,  of course.
 As Ray said in his
 
characteristically understated way,  "This process of cleaning is
 
not necessarily good for old buildings."
 .
 .
 .
 Ray's first
 
impressions of the valley included the sight of people tearing
 
down barns -
-
 especially happens in May.  
When an old shed or outbuilding is disused and falls into a
 
state of neglect,  the annual round of spring cleaning fever -
-
 a
 
custom all the neighbors participate in if they wish to be
 
approved of -
-
 pressures the owner to get rid of the unsightly
 
old building.
 .
 
This reminds me somewhat of the way the Catholic priests in
 
Missouri French communities used to make the local people do
 
spring cleaning and connect it to something in the religious
 
calendar.
 Spring cleaning was vital to survival in the early
 
times,  to help get rid of germs,  infect materials,  etc.
 
Ray says that times of epidemics,  fevers,  etc.  are indicated
 
on the Madawaska historical calendar.
 
("Cleaning up"  is done among other people;  the term is used
 
in Missouri by farm families to apply to similar chores -
-
cleaning up or clearing away brush from fields,  old areas,  etc.)
 
Because of the widespread adherence to the grand manage
  
tradition,  much of the landscape looks comparatively clean and
 
neat.
 This may be a misleading indication of well-being,  because
 
the economy of this region and all of New England is in
 
recession.
 Some even talk of economic depression.
 
Today's the openinq day of the Acadian Festival  in
 
Madawaska. 
.
 .
 
Bounds of the region. 
I photograph Madawaska street scenes
 
-
-
 Wonder Bar;  Canadian flag -
-
 but NO OUEBEC FLAG is flying in
  
Madawaska. 
That is very significant for this area -
-
 more
 
conservative people,  not "separatist" as they are in Quebec.
 
They aren't like the Quebeckers in this regard.
 This is an
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-26-91  (Wednesday),  p.9
 
international boundary we are on -
-
 we will see a different set
 
of flags over in New Brunswick....
 But there are "Acadian"  flags
 
flown in Madawaska, Maine.
 
I photograph a building on corner of 7th Street and US 1.
 
8.  I took RB to Ft.  Kent office,  and then drove south along
 
Highway 11;  took photos
  
MAP-HM-062691.E
 (Soldier Pond historical marker)
 
I find the Soldier Pond Rest Area quite interesting; historic
 
site that marks the original road from Ashland to Ft.  Kent.
 
Marker says  (tape recorded),  7.00 p.m.:
 
The Aroostook and Fish River Roads,  the northern
 
portion of present day Route 11 from Sherman to Fort Kent
 
was planned and constructed in many stages from 1826 to
 
1850s.
 This stretch of road includes two historical routes,
 
the Aroostook Road which ran 75 miles from Melinkus to
 
Ashland and the Fish River Road which extended 45 miles from
 
Ashland to Fort Kent.
 The Aroostook and Fish River roads
 
provided access north from Maine's population centers and
 
helped the state protect its claims to this region during
 
the northern border dispute with Great Britain.
 The roads
 
also encouraged settlement and development of valuable
 
agricultural and timber lands in present day Aroostook and
 
Penobscot counties.
 Route il's northern portion traces the
 
pass of the Aroostook and Fish River roads.
 Its history
 
reveals the vigor of establishing a road through an unbroken
 
forest.
 It also shows the influence of these routes which
 
brought people to protect and settle northern Maine in
 
shaping the state as it is known today."
 
The other side says:
 
The Fish River road was open in 1939.
 But like
 
all the roads built during the period,  further work was
 
required on it.
 Lack of funds prevented the completion
 
of the Fish River road until many years later.
 In the
 
meantime,  travel over it was nearly impossible except
 
on horseback.
 It was slightly easier during the winter
 
by a sleigh.
 But travelers's lives could be endangered
 
then because of cold.
 Captain Lucien  Webster who
 
commanded Fort Kent in 1841 wrote about the problem.
 
The road,  he reported,  "is through a dense forest  .
 .
 
designated by the trees being felled and streams
 
roughly bridged and without a single human habitation

PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of Piece-sur-piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombaqe (which is characterized by vertical log
 
construction).

1.  I worked on fieldnotes until the wee hours of the morning last
 
night on the Toshiba laptop computer;  it's very nice to have it
 
available and set up with WordPerfect 5.0 software.
 Ray and whit
 
have noticed a couple of refinements on the "Archive"  software
 
program that they might suggest later.
 I appreciate the
 
computer's availability because I now do virtually all of my
 
writing and most of my note taking on computer.
 
On my way from Eagle Lake to Fort Kent office about 8.00
 
a. m.,  going to Van Buren this morning to record some buildings.
 
John Brown house. 
Pulling out of the field headquarters at
 
Eagle Lake  (the Phil Brown house),  I photographed the John Brown
 
farm house, which is right on Highway 11 overlooking Eagle Lake;
 
this is a chap I met the first evening.
 He is the

of Phil Brown,  whose house we are using for field headquarters.
 
The John Brown house is quite fine.
 It may have somewhat less
 
interest in terms of the St.  John valley Acadian cottage as a
 
house type -- it's a big,  massive Victorian era farm house -- but
 
it has at has two features from the exterior that are important
 
here:  the clipped gable roof,  and the use of red and gray
 
contrasting colors on the house.
 We are seeing this ox-blood red
 
(sang de boeuf) elsewhere.
 
I
As I drive toward Ft.  Kent I pass another one that looks
 
about 1960 small pattern book and it has the red and gray.
 
interesting that a great number of pickup trucks and some of
 
cars have that two-tone red and gray,  usually the red on top

outbuildings and they are arranged in a line usually up behind
 
the houses reflecting the French system of land division and land
 
utilization,  which RB calls the arpent system. 
It's a long lot
 
system introduced by the French and also in other places early by
 
the British in the Colonial times here.
 That layout is quite
 
interesting.
 When you get over to the St. John River bank,
 
you'll also see there that the houses are aligned in many cases
 
with the highway,  but at other times they are also purposely
 
aligned to be facing and parallel with the St.  John River.
 I
 
find that is a nice touch,  a nice detail.
 
Some dialect. 
Among the other things a person coming to the
 
north of Maine notices is the use of word "stream"  instead of
 
"creek" that I am used to outside of New England and really
 
virtually every place else in the United States.
 The word creek
 
would be used for these small tributary water courses that we've
 
passed fairly frequently.
 But up here they call so-and-so stream
 
rather than so-and-so creek.
 "Brook"  is also used here.
 
The word "pond" up here seems to have a particular meaning.
 
I am supposing for the time being that the word pond is used for
 
small or large landlocked bodies of water that are man-made.
 I
 
would guess these man-made ponds are the results of damning the
 
stream for the purpose of operating one of the many water-powered
 
mills that were scattered throughout this area.
 Very few are
 
still here and in operation though there is one buckwheat mill at
 
Frenchville that is still operating.
 
The other word for a large body of waters is the word "lake"
 
and those seem to be natural lakes like Eagle Lake where we are
 
staying.
 If that was a lake produced by damning the stream for
 
mill,  I think we would be calling that Eagle Pond.
 
Connected buildings. 
Also noticed repeatedly,  I am sure,  is
 
the connectedness of even very modest dwellings like mobile
 
homes, which to me have a sense of connected buildings in New
 
England style or fashion of c.  19.
 Even right here in town at
 
Fort Kent many garages are attached to the house either very
 
close or by a covered back porch or walkway.
 The connected plan
 
of these structures, which begin most likely with farm buildings,
 
is quite important,  quite important.
 It's wonderful to know and
 
see that it continues today in 1992 and that it is not at all a
 
dead tradition thanks to the condition of winter weather here,
 
which is really severe and rough.
 
Connected farmsteads is of course an important and well-
known feature of the New England cultural landscape.
 Tom Hubka's
 
wonderful study  (Big House,  Little House,  Back House,  Barn) is
 
the best work on the topic;  I think he spent a lot of time
 
studying Maine examples,  and as I recall southwestern Maine is
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-27-91  (Thursday)  p.4
 
the hearth of this tradition.
 I think Tom believes that the vast
 
bulk of the connected farmsteads we see are the result of
 
Victorian fashion  (environmentally sensitive)  as much or more
 
than the retention of any kind of old-world habit or Colonial
 
development.
 
Fort Kent town:  Victorian period houses
 
Driving through the town of Fort Kent,  I observe that there are a
 
number of very fine New Eng land type temple-front,  gable front T-
shaped houses of mid- to late 19th and early 20th century,  some
 
with very fine scroll sawn barge boards,  Gothic and Victorian
 
detailing.
 There are a number of houses that look to me like
 
that they might be essentially Acadian timber framed houses with
 
their gables turned to the street rather than the long side
 
facing the road as in the countryside.
 This is an expected and
 
typical accommodation tc the conditions of the urban life in 19th
 
and 20th centuries.

In Madawaska,  RB and I have my
 
fieldnotes recorder on,  talking;  some of RB's comments:
 
MAP-HM-F06279l .  B
 
Brassieur: 
We are looking at the architecture here
 
and thinking about architectural influence here.
 There
 
are a lot of things that are recognizable as things
 
that happened in New England and down east,  at least
 
south of where we are in Maine for sure.
 We think of
 
these influences as coming up here and no doubt some of
 
them did.
 But if we want to do some comparative work
 
with Anglo,  Scottish or that kind of tradition,  the
 
more logical place to look for comparative material is
 
in New Brunswick because historically that's where the
 
economic interest came from over here into the St. John
 
valley.
 The logs that were cut in early c.  19 were
 
floated down the St.  John River.
 Many of them were
 
sawn in Van Buren,  town that we are going to right now
 
to look at the house there.
 That was the biggest saw
 
mill around here.
 In this part of the country,  they
 
say that was the biggest saw mill east of the
 
Mississippi River.
 In Missouri they used to say this
 
is the biggest whatever it is west of Mississippi
 
River.
 They would saw those logs into lumber in Van
 
buren to keep them to deal with the Grand Falls.
 Once
 
it gets to the Grand Falls,  they would lose lumber -
-
it would chop up the lumber to fall off the falls,  it
 
would daoage the logs in another words.  .

Marshall: 
Another thing that interests me about what
 
we said about this area is the concept of "down east."
 
That really doesn't apply to St.  John valley.
 Do
 
people call this down east?
 
Brassieur: 
It's very hard to picture this as down
 
east.
 I guess it would be down east from here.
 
Marshall: 
The old concept of down east,  which is very
 
much with everybody in Maine,  all the historians,
 
antique dealers,  it's down east Maine.
 So are we
 
saying we are not in an area where the people who live
 
here think of themselves as living down east?
 
Brassieur: 
I haven't heard the term "down east" used
 
over here.
 But I have heard in Bangor.
 When I asked
 
people about that specifically in reference to music
 
that came from Prince Edward Island,  etc.,  and how they
 
fit that into a down east tradition.
 Bo Graves,  for
 
instance,  he didn't see any problem with that.
 He
 
would think that was all down east,  whether it is in
 
maritimes or not.
 Here the concept of down east may
 
not be the same.
 
Down East, more. 
The standard idea

2.  Drove with RB to Van Buren,  on Hwy.  11 to study the Val
  
Violette House.  
Val Violette House is on the National Register of Historic
 
Places.
 This is a piece sur Piece en colombage log house,  built
 
c.  1850 by Belonie Violette.
 It is a large,  two and a half story
 
house.
 The house was moved from nearby Violette Stream.

The exterior resembles standard large New England houses

detailing  (the cornices,  the white pilasters)  and Georgian
 
symmetry and overall feel.
 I 
Like other Acadian cottages,  this one features a smallish
 
central hallway that serves as a reception area and focal point
 
for the front part of the house.
 This house is quite a bit
 
larger than most of its type.
 Again like many others,  this house
 
has undoubtedly been modified and enlarged in ways that we can
 
only suspect at this point.
 
one of the modifications that was apparently made to this
 
house when it was moved and refurbished is that is was raised
 
higher off the ground and placed on a more standard foundation.
 
There is a cellar underneath the house,  as is typical.
 In
 
this house,  there is an outside cellar entrance in the east gable
 
wall in addition to the familiar small entrance way in the
 
kitchen area inside.
 
The loft details are important,  especially the lovely
 
roofing system which is original and largely intact despite the
 
house having been moved.
 The roofing system features pine pole
 
decking  (flat on top only),  together with an impressive example
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-27-91  (Thursday)  p.7
 
of heavy timber joinery in the principal bearing members and the
 
rafter system.
 Ray noticed that there is a rameaux, a blessed
 
palm,  stuck into the rafters next to the stairway;  this protects
 
the house.
 
3. We ate lunch in Van Buren and drove north to Frenchville to
 
the Acadian Village open air museum,  where we recorded buildings.  
See field note books.
 
MAP-HM-F062791
D
 
Buildings recorded at the Acadian Village Museum:
 
Parent-Roy log house. 
Very fine hewn log house of about
 
1800, with the vertical logs hewn on all four sides and placed
 
very close together and joined at the corners with a rare method
 
combining square-notching with vertical wooden pins  (trunnels)  to
 
lock the corners.
 This is a very important specimen,  even if it
  
has been altered and perhaps damaged during movement and
  
reconstruction.  
The house measures 21-4 x 26-8 outside.
 The form of the
 
house is very much that of an Anglo-American "single-pen" house
 
of the sort built by many different ethnic groups across the
 
whole continent from the first settlement phases up well into the
 
20th century.
 It is a rectangle, with the single door in the
 
"long side" aligned with the roof ridge,  and the hearth in the
 
gable end,  the whole covered with a gable roof.
 The floor is
 
packed dirt.
 Built by French,  its British form should not be
 
surprising,  given the long interaction between these groups in
 
Acadia,  Nova Scotia,  etc.
 The French personality is perhaps
 
expressed most in the slightly-upward-curving lower edge of the
 
roof,  and perhaps in the use of vertical trunnels to secure the
 
square-notched corners.
 
There is a sleeping loft in the north gable end only,  served
 
by a handmade portable ladder.
 It is of the early open type that
 
is almost never conserved in historic houses of the period.
 
There is a massive sandstone chimney that is placed entirely
 
inside the south gable wall;  that is,  no part of the chimney
 
touches the wall; this is an element of environmental sensitivity
 
and vernacular building one always hopes and likes to see in
 
buildings like this.
 
Maison Morneault. 
This is a very nice Acadian cottage of
 
1857,  in the piece-sur-piece walling tradition with vertical
 
grooved columns  (so that the horizontal pieces are
 
colombage"). 
Its essential floorplan is also that of a British
 
Isles -
 American house type,  apparently a large single-cell
 
house; however,  there may have been  (probably was)  at least one
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-27-91  (Thursday)  p.8
 
interior partition that has been removed during reconstruction at
 
the museum.
 
There are ship's knees in the second story to brace the
 
walls.
 These are significant in St.  John Valley vernacular
 
houses of the early Acadian cottage type.
 Some of the insulation
 
in the second story  (sleeping loft)  is birch bark.
 
The piece walls are covered on the exterior with planche
  
debut (vertical flush boards),  typical of Acadian tradition here.
 
A community post office is attached to the south gable end;
 
it also is piece-sur-piece construction with vertical columns.
 
Maison Levasseaur et Ouellette (Maison Ouellette).
 This is
 
a fine Acadian cottage of 1859  (built by Regis Levasseur upon his
 
marriage),  although this is a log house and not a piece-sur-piece
 
structure.
 It reflects Georgian influence in its central hall
 
and exterior symmetry,  and is a sort of reduced version of the
 
Maison Daigle over in Clair,  NB.
 
Some might call these Acadian cottages "double pile" houses.
 
They are two rooms deep,  all under one gabled roof.
 The trait of
 
being two rooms deep is important in identifying the Acadian
 
cottage and distinguishing it from house types
 more clearly
 
Anglo-Americane  (which are traditionally,  up until about the 19th
 
century)  almost always but one room deep.
 
One of the nice features here is the central cooking and
 
heating stove,  located to achieve maximum radiation of heat.
 The
 
wall behind the stove is cut away to a height of about four feet,
 
giving more effective circulation of air in the house.
 This is
 
another feature that is like the Maison Daigle in Clair,  NB.
 
Rather than being open mortise and tenon joints,  the rafters
 
in this more modest Acadian house are joined at the peak by half-
lap joints  (secured with trunnels,  of course).
 
Another feature that reflects this house's more modest
 
position is its lack of ship's knees.
 I am about ready to
 
suggest that the finer Acadian houses / cottages of the early
 
period would have,  in all likelihood,  featured ship's knees in
 
the second story as bracing.
 This an "extra" and quite elegant
 
feature of the best houses that indeed may well be a kind of
 
ornament and even perhaps  (but we can never know for sure)  a
 
symbol for the builders and users.
 
Like other Acadian houses,  this one has a small bird house
 
for swallows attached to the front corner.

This is a very nice
 
English "type" barn of the early kind  (viz.  Glassie,  "Barn
 
Building in Otsego County,  New York:  The Variation of Concepts
 
within Tradition," in Walker and Haag's festschrift for
 
Kniffen...).
 Side opening,  three bay barn,  here with a gabled
 
roof.
 Moved here and reconstructed,  from the Leon Rossignol farm
 
near Van Buren.
 
Like others,  it has a lean-to shed addition on one of the
 
gables.
 Such additions were probably built at or soon after the
 
moment of construction of the barn itself.
 Typically they are
 
for sheltering the cattle and draft animals.
 Conceptually they
 
may be thought of as "additions" but they are integral elements.
 
The barn combines late medieval-looking heavy hewn and
 
joined framing members with more modern sawn smaller member.
 A a
 
fine example,  and it even sports the standard shingle siding
 
characteristic of St.  John Valley traditional farm buildings.
 
Barns in the area on Hwy.  11 S.  of Fort Kent: Some are
 
shingled and some with lapped horizontal siding.
 Many are in a
 
sad state of repair.
 Many look like they might be "cleaned up"
 
next spring  (i.e.,  demolished)....
 
4.  New Sweden,  an island of Scandinavian vernacular architecture
 
MAP-HM-F062791 . E
 
We then drove through the center of the research area,  towards
 
Madawaska and eventually Fort Kent,  from the Frenchville area.
 
This traverse took us through the New Sweden community, where
 
there are some outstanding Swedish log buildings from the latter
 
part of the nineteenth century when this small region of Swedes
 
established farms here.
 
In the new Sweden community there are some marvelous
 
buildings related to the Swedish settlers of 1870s or 1880s.
 
There are several log buildings in the Scandinavian tradition of
 
extended,  notched corners in very close-set flush horizontal logs
 
with special shapes and notching of specifically Scandinavian
 
origin.
 I photographed one of these but can't take the time to
 
measure it.
 These are very significant buildings and that
 
community constitutes a sort of island of vernacular architecture
 
within the broader county of Aroostook.
 
The New Sweden area,  and the other Scandinavian villages and
 
farms nearby,  seem to constitute a sort of cultural geographic
 
buffer zone between the St.  John Valley Acadians and the rest of
 
the state of Maine....

5.  Stan's 
We had supper at a rather amazing  (and self-aware)  joint called
 
"Stan's" at Lake Madawaska and then continued driving up through
 
this very nice potato growing area between Van Buren and Highway
 
11 at Soldier Pond.
 At Soldier Pond we came out at Maine Hwy.  11
 
and continued to the shack of Eagle Lake.
 
6.  We reached Soldier Pond,  and then returned to Eagle Lake.

August 28,  1991:  
PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of piece-sur-piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombage (which is characterized by vertical  log
 
construction).
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre; Moogk references.)

V.  Field research day five,  06-28-91  (Friday)  
1.  Breakfast at the house at Eagle Lake.
 Good morning,  St.  John
 
Valley.
 
2.  Ca.  8.00 a. m.  to Fort Kent field hq. 
Discussed the day's
 
plans with DW,  and made some phone calls.
 Light rain this
 
morning but adequate and nice illumination for photography.
 The
 
last two evenings I' ve smelled smoke at Eagle Lake,  and I' ve
 
learned that this  is the odor of forest fires  in Quebec to the
 
northwest.
 
3.  Architectural detail:  the clipped gable. 
The clipped gable
 
occurs on a number of houses.
 The clipped gable occurs on gable
 
roofs and is expressed in the creation of a very small hipped
 
effect in the ends of gables.
 I believe this  is the Quebec and
 
-1-
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  2
 
New Brunswick feature roofing style and it's a European feature
 
of course,  particular western France and low countries.
 
I see this clipped gable mainly on houses that look to be
 
from the latter part of 19th and early 20th century and not from
 
the very earliest Acadian cottage phase.
 But some houses that
 
are of general Acadian cottage form do have clipped gables.
 But
 
they are probably late examples.
 
The gables often have barge boards  (fascia boards)  with
 
special shapes of wood trim at their eave positions.
 
4.  At Fort Kent office:  I called Marjorie Hunt at the Library to
 
answer her call to me;  she wants some dope on the Italian
 
immigrant stone masons in my Paradise Valley,  Nevada,  study
 
(1979-1989)  .
.
.
 for the Columbus Quincentenary exhibition that
 
she is curating for the American Folklife Center.
 I said I'd
 
talk to the press I'm working with on the ms.  I've written
 
(University of Arizona),  to see its progress and get their
 
approval to give some stuff to Marjorie.
 Spoke briefly with
 
David Taylor during the same call to the Library.
 
5.  Discussion in the car with RB on barns,  agricultural history,  
land,  and summary of history of the Acadian people here driving
 
(on Hwy.  1 approaching Frenchville...  en route to see Don Cyr in
 
Lille)
 
MAP-HM-F062891. A
 
Brassieur: 
The barn is called piqnon simple. 
That
 
just means a simple qable barn. 
That's apparently the
 
earlier barn farm that we see in this area.
 
Marshall: 
like the Acadian barn at the Van Buren
 
outdoor museum....
 
Brassieur: 
Absolutely.
 It was a multipurpose barn.
 
Most of them that we've seen at least do have a place
 
to put stock in there.
 Not a large place but several
 
milk cow and a calf or a horse or several heads of
 
stock.
 Sometimes this place is for pig evidently.
 Not
 
very many.
 It was for a single family who was not very
 
much into stock but had their own.
 Of course that barn
 
had the central opening where the wagon would enter in
 
with hay and hay could be loaded into the chambers of
 
the barn.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  3
 
It was likely that railroad influenced this area a
 
lot,  the aqriculture in this area considerably. 
Before
 
the railroad potatoes were actually often stored in
 
potato barrows within the basement of houses.
 That's
 
referred to in that book Acadian Hard Times. 
They
 
call it cavereau (SPELLING?).
 Cavereau is on the side
 
of the house which would allow them to open the
 
basement and rolled the barrow right down into the
 
basement of their house.
 So you can tell it wasn't the
 
giant potato operation that developed after the
 
railroad came in.
 After the railroad came in,  the bank
 
barns became much more numerous,  at the least the ones
 
with basement sunk into the hill or down into the
 
ground.
 That's the one we see with just the roof
 
practically sticking out.
 Some of them are gambrel and
 
some of them are not,  just simple gable barns.
 They
 
call the ones that are gambrel roofs con casse 
here
 
(SPELLING?).
 I have to check the spelling.
 I'm not
 
sure whether it is "come" or "colm or something like
 
that.  But it just means a broken roof line  (099),  like
 
the one we see right here.
 
Not long after the railroad were put in at the
 
turn of the century,  they put these big potato houses
  
on the railroads with very large storage.
 We are
 
looking at some now as we approach Frenchville here.
 
There is a good number of them.
 But at the same time
 
they began to farm much more acreage as well.
 The
 
thing that allowed to them farm that kind of acreage,
 
at least before those of lot of mechanized farming,  was
 
big draft horses....
 For a short period until they
 
became mechanized during the 20th century.
 Those big
 
horses required a lot of hay evidently because you can
 
see that huge barns were built early this century.
 The
 
main purpose of those barns were to stock hay. 
The
 
barn sizes apparently increased.
 It might be related
 
to an increase in stock on the farm although they may
 
have also sold hay as part of their business.
 
They also raised oats and buckwheat.
 Oats as a
 
feed for their animals and buckwheat mainly for a local
 
human consumption.
 
Marshall: 
They didn't make oat cakes in British time,
 
stuff of oats?
 
Brassieur: 
I haven't noticed any food ways that
 
include oats so far.
 
Marshall: 
That would be the Scotsman's fare,  oats
 
three times a day...!  .

I was thinking about the houses and their forms
 
and whether they might be French or British and the
 
similarities between France and Britain.
 I was asking
 
about the people who came here to the main side of St.
 
John valley.
 These Acadians beginning in 1790s,  they
 
had already been Quebec people for quite a long time.
 
Brassieur: 
The history of these people:
 They first
 
settled in Acadia in the early 17th century,  and they
 
continued to populate that area.
 But in 1713 the
 
P
i
 
Marshall f--'eldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  6
 
Treaty of Utrecht,  they hecame subjects of England.
 That
 
how much England influences the material culture of Acadian
 
between 1713 and 1755 when they got pulled out,  I don't
 
know.
 That's a research problem.
 But at any rate,  after
 
1755 a lot of Scotsman and people from the British Isles
 
began to populate Nova Scotia as well as New Brunswick.
 
After 1780,  the Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution
 
also began to populate New Brunswick.
 So thev were bringing
 
in the stvles from the south and from the British isles.  
And I suspect that if we go to New Brunswick we'll see some
 
pretty early things that definitely would reflect that
 
British Isles origin.

echniques
. 
Marshall: 
You were talking about Norman part of
 
northwest France?
 
Brassieur: 
Yes,  Normandy,  Brittany as well and further
 
down in Poitou, that's where most of them came from --
the west coast of France,  northwest coast.
 
If you go to Quebec,  there are a lot of people
 
here whose origins did not go back to Acadian but go
 
back to Quebec.
 To me this in a way is splitting hairs
 
because the early heritage is very similar.
 The people
 
that settled in Quebec are basically the same people
 
that settled in Acadia.
 Most of them did come from
 
northern areas of France -- Poitou and Brittany and
 
They had a slightly different history but the
  
material culture in Ouebec has also been greatly
  
influenced by Britain as well. 
After 1763 when
 
England,  from that period they have some strong British
 
Marshall: 
When Mr.  Blackie Cyr talks about that house
 
being part of the original land grant,  he's talking
 
about 1790 to 1794  land grant from British crown.
 
Brassieur: 
That's correct.
 The boundary at the St.
 
John River was established in 1843,  1 believe it was.
 
It wasn't until the Ashburton Treaty that .
...
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  7
 
Marshall: 
The first Cyr,  what ever his name was,  would
 
have gone to some city in New Brunswick or Quebec to
 
buy the deed,  which was called land grant.
 
Brassieur: 
That's right.
 That would have been in
 
Fredericktof
l or St.  John,  New Brunswick.
 They thought
 
of themselves as subjects of the crown.
 That's what
 
they were.
 Though they lived on this side of the
 
river,  either one of them,  there was no boundary there.
 
Marshall: 
Here is another term for my glossary on
 
Acadian architecture.
 Ray uses the term "porche",
 
which he thinks the Acadians use for what I would call
 
a shed addition to a barn.
 They call that porche, but
 
we need to check on this one further.
 
6.  Land division
 
MAP-HM-FO 62 8
 9
 1. B
 
Old maps suggest landholdings in the area  (1976 atlas)  -
-
 in the
 
arpent system at that time.
 The premiere range (first rank)  of
 
land holdings radiate back from the St.  John River.
 
A premiere range holding was 40 arpents in size.
 
There was also a duzieme range or second rank of holdings.
 
But beyond that,  the concessions were parcelled out to the later
 
people or to the children of the original settlers.
 Concessions
 
were exchanged in various ways,  sometimes to settle debts,
 
especially in "the back settlements."
 
The "back settlements" aren't in the careful arpent shapes;
 
they are in odd shapes and parcels.
 The arpent system is much
  
the same here is in Missouri  (Ste.  Genevieve district).  
Sometimes the arpents were measured from the lakes,  and
 
sometimes they used Highway 1 as the departing point for the
 
arpent divisions.
 
RB says an arpent is about 186-190 feet wide  (a linear
 
measurement along a river,  etc.).
 Need to check on this.
 One
 
arpent would be 40 arpents deep.
 An "arpent" would in fact thus
 
originally be one arpent wide and 40 deep.
 They were measured in
 
English feet  (pieds), probably the same as an English foot.
 
(But remember that there was argument and different about
 
what a foot would be;  for example,  the Scottish foot differed and
 
there was lots of debate over what Scots would use in
 
Scotland....)
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  8
 
7.  Drove with RB to visit Don Cvr at his house and historic
  
property in Lille (n.  of Ft.  Kent on U.S.  1
).
 The National
  
Register form for the church lists the location as "Grand Isle,"
 
but people here call it "Lille"  (pronounced I
'leel").
 
Don Cyr teaches art and Acadian history classes at
 
University of Maine - Fort Kent and is an avid collector of
 
Acadian furniture and buildings.
 He owns or at least has
 
practical ownership of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church
  
(1909)  that is on the National Register of Historic Places,  along
 
with the dismantled Violette Log House that is stacked under
 
tarps in his back yard.
 
Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church 
The National Register
 
form indicates that the Owner is the Diocese of Portland  (510

The Violette House is in a pitiful state,  having been
 
dismantled but stored poorly with little protection from the
 
forces of weathering.
 It is a log house indeed,  with planked
 
hewn logs and cornering that is a similar kind of "false
  
cornering" that I studied on the Roy Log Cabin at the Acadian
 
Village.
 Mr.  Cyr plans to reconstruct it behind the old church
 
in due course.
 It looks like all the parts,  or most of the
 
parts,  are there -- including the original ship's knees from the
 
house's loft.
 
8.  Brassieur comment on the river. 
The St.  John River has gone
 
down a lot since we arrived here on June 2.
 There are some
 
shallows apparent in the river,  and it looks like you can walk
 
across it in certain places.
 That level has changed within the
 
last three weeks drastically.
 While there are not that many
 
boats on the river,  you'd have to pick a good spot to make a
 
crossing in a boat.
 
9.  Danny Labrie Twin Barn. 
Next,  we drove to the D.L.  (Danny)
 
Labrie farm in the St.  Agatha community to study the "twin barn"
 
on their farm.
 St.  Agatha is pronounced "Sant Agat". 1
1 
This is the heart of the county's agricultural land.
 
This is a nice example of a distinctive northern Aroostook
  
County / St.  John River Vallev barn type. 
The twin barn  (the
 
local term)  is a pair of three-bay "English" or "Acadian" type
 
barns built one exactly behind the other and with a small
 
connecting unit framed transversely between them.
 I photographed
 
and recorded the barn in detail.

Brassieur comments on the Labrie barns,  farminq operation:  
I was thinking about Mr.  Louis Labrie.
 He is the
 
father of Danny Labrie,  who presently owns the farm.
 I
 
am not sure how old Danny is exactly but he's got one
 
kid that's already gone to college and has returned.
 
He's got another son that's going to college now.
 I
 
don't know how old his wife is.

He bought the property in 1945.
 He had originally
 
had 48 acres in this farm,  but he continued to add
 
acres adjoined to it and it expanded as his family
 
grew.
 The old man was married in 1941.
 They'll soon
 
have a 50 anniversary this year in September.
 He was
 
growing some oats and that was feed.
 He also sold
 
oats as well.
 They never did eat it.
 I asked him if
 
he ate oats.
 The family never ate any of those that
 
they grew.
 It was only feed.
 They also had dairy
 
He had a twin barn on one side of which was stalls
 
for his cattle,  and on the other side there was a room
 
for hay and there was granary in the middle of that
 
side of the barn .
...
 The middle pass that run through
 
the barn ' he had a French word called batterie or
 
battire,  I am not sure.
 Wagons would go into the pass
 
and unload what he called loose hay and stack them on
 
the north side of the barn.
 The granary was also on
 
the north side.
 That's where they kept feed for the
 
cattle.
 But on the south side of the barn
 where the
 
cattle were at,  there was room for 20 cows in that
 
Later on in 1950, he built an addition to the barn
 
on the south side of the barn.
 He called it  (
? 070).
 
It was our stable.
 That's where his cows were moved to the
 
south side of the barn.
 There was still room for 20 cows.
 
He tied them to a (?  074).
 There was a place behind the
 
cows,  a furrow that was in the floor,  that would catch
 
fertilizer from the cows.
 He could easily scrape it out.
 
In the place where the cattle had been inside the barn,  by
 
1950 he was putting certain kind of equipment in there
 
because his potato business was growing.
 He was going more
 
and more toward potatoes at that time.
 
He said the company that bought milk from was
 
lled Hood Company,  but he said by the late 50s or
 
rly 60s,  small dairy operations like his couldn't

In 1973,  Mr.  Louis Labrie moved from his farm
 
house,  which is now the residence of his son Danny,
 
across the street  (road)  to a what is a western style,
 
very modest home where he lives today.

9.  St.  Aqathe  (Aqatha):  Historical Society museum;  bread making
 
MAP-HM-F062891. E
 
We toured the St.  Agatha Historical Society Museum,  in a nice
 
19th century frame house.
 Ray's talked quite a long time with
 
the Catholic sister who was the guide and we are now travelling
 
up over Flat Mountain....
 
RB notes that during his first trip through here,  a guided
 
tour with Patrick and Julie Bailey,  they couldn't see any potato
 
plants coming up;  they had just planted.
 Now,  two weeks later,
 
the potatoes are about four to six inches tall.
 Their season
 
isn't very long but plants grow very fast in the summer.
 
RB comments on the bread:  
We had stopped in St.  Agatha at Baubain's grocery
 
store.
 They baked their own bread.
 It's very good.
 
Its got texture very much like grandmother's bread.
 
Ploy is something you cook on a griddle and there is
 
evidently some disagreement over how big round they
 
should be or how thick they should be.
 Like everywhere
 
else people have their own opinion about how perfect
 
food should be cooked.
 But it is kind of pancake in a
 
way but they eat it more like the Mexicans eat flour
 
tortillas.
 They can eat it for breakfast but they can
 
also and did eat it for every meal most of the time.
 
It was used to wrap anything around.
 It can be used
 
like a sandwich but you wrap it like a flour tortilla.
 
Or you can sop gravy or sop syrup with it.
 It is a
 
very flexible type of bread,  flat bread.
 You cook it
 
only one side.
 When you pour the batter in the
 
griddle,  you cook just on one side and it cooks all the
 
way through.
 The French word for that flour is
 ?
 
(181).  
 
is one of the crops grown here in the St.
 
John valley.
 It used to be fairly important.
 
Mr.  Louis Labrie told me that what he called the
 
old buckwheat was really black buckwheat as if there is
 
another style of buckwheat that had been brought in.
 
We haven't learned exactly that other style is....
 But
 
the old style was the one they use for this flour.
 
It's still grown in limited quantities.
 It is grown
 
for local consumption.
 
This is the best farm land in the county.
 We are on a flat
 
mountain road headed west toward Ft.  Kent or Soldier Pond,
 
depending on which way we end up.
 Now we're out of the arpent
 
land division area,  and into the "back settlements"
 
(concessions)
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  13
 
After we got off the Flat Mountain road,  we turned on to
 
something called North Pearly Brook road that eventually brought
 
us into the junction of 161,  right across the railroad tracks
 
just south of Fort Kent.
 North Pearly Brook Road is where there
 
are some really fine barns in the so-called back settlements,
 
including the one that we all agree is real French-looking,  with
 
the Acadian mass and wings on the side.

The potato house is a late 19th century if not an early
 
twentieth century development.
 There are two kinds:
 the ones on
 
the potato farms and the ones for further storage that are
 
positioned parallel to the railroad tracks of the "BAR"  (Bangor
 
and Aroostook Railroad).
 
Fire was a continual threat,  since the barns had to be
 
constantly heated through the winter storage season at a
 
temperature from 34 to 36 degrees fahrenheit.
 So the "potato
 
growers"  (potato farmers of substance and position)  developed
 
concrete fire walls in the early twentieth century.
 Fire walls
 
are placed in the gable ends between adjacent potato houses.
 
Mr.  Depreyfs potato house is sizeable;  it will hold 14,000
 
barrels of potatoes.
 Each potato barrel  (made locally .
.. ) holds
 
165 pounds of potatoes.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  14
 
Ray's comments  from his visits with Mr.  Deprey:  
We were just at the potato house of Herman Deprey,
 
which is located next to the railroad track in Soldier
 
Pond.
 This potato house was built by a Joe Lamar, who
 
is Herman's father's father-in-law .
...
 It was built in
 
1934 and it was built with wood Mr.  Lamar cut down
 
himself.
 He cut trees and drove the trees to Van Buren
 
where they were sawn,  and he took the sawn lumber to
 
build the potato house .

I'll mention a couple of details which I've noted on my
 
recording of the building.
 It is a gable roof structure.
 The
 
gable outline was retained with the construction of the concrete
 
fire wall,  which is a massive fire wall,  and they would have to
 
go through an awful lot of trouble to shape a gambrel roof.
 It
 
would probably have been easier to shape a gable roof.
 By 1934
 
that gambrel roof outline for potato houses and barns had become
 
the main tradition,  at least for potato houses.
 
Another interesting detail I've noticed is that the ramp
 
going up to the second story of a potato house from the top of
 
the bank above is built using discarded rails from the railroad.
 
It is what I would call the old size rail,  which has been
 
replaced with new welded ra-
'l over the past 25 years,  little by
 
little across the nation.
 -rhis is really a wonderful use of
 
discarded railroad iron.
 it's really just an H-shaped brace th
 
carries the heavy wooden p1ank-floored ramp.
 That ramp has to
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-28-91  (Friday)  p.  15
 
strong enough to support a potato truck.
 That has to hold some
 
weight.
 They also use railroad iron on the upper heel corners of
 
the potato house just as a little extra bracing at the corners.
 
I haven't seen that before but it makes good sense.
 
Buildinq the fire wall and a second potato house adjacent.  
There was another potato house built on the other side of the end
 
wall or gable.
 In building the second potato house,  they simply
 
left a certain space to fill the cement in for the cement wall
 
before pouring the cement wall.
 If you look at the fire wall,  it
 
has a formed shape that suggests they used planks for the forms.
 
THey loaded the space little by little,  using buckets; this
 
probably took a lot of time,  because it takes forever to dry
 
before another layer can be dumped on.
 
Ventilation is important,  as is heating.
 Mr.  Deprey told 1

that the ideal temperature inside the building while the potato
 
are in there is from 34 to 36 degrees.
 They cannot drop below 3
 
because they'll freeze.
 If they go over 40 for any time at all,
 
then you are going to have long roots sticking out of them by
 
spring time.
 They can store them not until spring.
 It's timed
 
by the market conditions.

11.  Drove to Madawaska and met RB,  LO,  and DW at the Multi-
Purpose Center near the high school.
 We will record the Acadian
 
music event this evening.
 
Ate supper at Dolly's,  a reputedly good Acadian restaurant
 
on U.S.  1 between Madawaska and Frenchville.
 I ordered,  as part
 
of the meal,  ploy. 
Excellent  (buckwheat pancakes .
.. );  SEE
 
Brassieur notes for details on ploy. 
It combines buckwheat meal
 
with white flour,  soda,  water and perhaps other ingredients in
 
various mixes.
 It is commercially available in ready-made mixes
 
(
just add water)  but purists like to use local or family recipes.

I photographed in black-and-white part of the event,  8.00 to
 
10.20 p.m.,  and then drove back to Ft.  Kent and back to the shack
 
at Eagle Lake,  arriving c.  11.30 p.m.
 
This event was enjoyable despite a horrible sound system.
 
There were a lot of people,  and the musicians included locals as
 
well as fiddlers and step dancers from around the region and from
 
New Brunswick.
 RB can provide names of people I photographed
 
later.
 Whitman,  Ornstein,  and Brassier were all there and did an
 
excellent job of covering this community festival event.

August 28,  1991:  
PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the  literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of piece-sur-piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from coloinbage (which is characterized by vertical  log
 
construction).
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre;  Moogk references.)
 
Thus,  the above comments SUPERSEDE references  in the
 
following fieldnotes -
-
 that could not be corrected due to the
 
pressure of the deadline for fieldnote submission.
 
Also,  please note that my Glossary (fieldnotes appendix)  has
 
been corrected to reflect our latest evaluations as stated above.

VI.  Field research day six,  06-29-91  (Saturday)  
1.  Breakfast at the Eagle Lake house.
 I clocked the distance
 
from Fort Kent to the Eagle Lake lodging;  it's almost exactly 12
 
miles.
 Weather is cool this morning.
 
Eagle Lake is a very attractive place to have a "camp "
 
(leisure and recreation cottage);  very beautiful,  surrounded by
 
woods,  very little lumbering going on in the immediate area.
 One
 
of the people I talked with last night at the dance in Madawaska
 
-1-
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday) ,
 p.2
 
said to Ray that they should have the Acadian Cultural Heritage
 
center at Madawaska and that he couldn't see anything about the
 
Eagle Lake area that is interesting to him.
 He said there is
 
nothing over but moose.
 
Linear village forms;  architecture
 
MAP-HM-F062991. A
 
The villages,  like the called Plaisted,  are strip villages or
 
linear villages aligned with the road winding through the
 
settlement.
 Houses are aligned with the highway.
 
Driving along Highway 11,  I just see many houses in the
 
Georgian plan with hints of log or piece-sur-piece construction
 
under the modern replacement siding.
 The late 19th century
 
variants seem more square and a little taller.
 That is the house
 
type what one might call the Acadian house,  either one or one and
 
a half stories and in some cases two stories  (which could then be
 
called an I-house).
 Many are shingled.
 The old one looks like
 
the shingling exterior was never painted though some of the new
 
ones are.
 
Shingles,  more. 
When shingling is on the barn,  the
 
shingling tends to be painted and sometimes not on houses and
 
vice versa.
 shingling is certainly distinctive.
 Shingles are
 
about 16 inches in length and quite thin and they are feathered.
 
I think this is the distinctive shingle length for this area.
 
I passed the Freeman farm.
 I am quite impressed with Mr.
 
Freeman's knowledge and his farm.
 He has a Georgian plan,  one
 
story with loft house,  which is very nice.
 White house,  big
 
shingle barn with a almost round roof,  which is made of compound
 
rafters.
 Unusual roof for this region but I think Mr.  Freeman
 
put it on a 1940s or so.
 
I stopped in front of the house of George Labonte, less than
 
a quarter mile beyond the Soldier Pond turn.
 It's a lovely big
 
Acadian cottage with dormer windows,  one story plus a huge loft.
 
It's very large and square and is one of the Georgian cottages.
 
The gable is aligned with the road.
 It looks like it may have
 
been changed to put a door on the side to make it more convenient
 
to get in and out of the house.
 It has an attached newer
 
building in between it and garage on the back.
 It's really quite
 
a lovely house with the gallery on two sides.
 The basement,
 
which is the bottom under the porch,  looks to be three feet off
 
the ground.
 That's unusual here.
 
These Georqian Acadian cottaqes usually are set very close
 
to the ground,  until they are move to a museum or another
  
location in which time they are raised. 
-- Compare this with
 
Louisiana,  Georgian Acadian,  or the so-called Creole house,  in
 
which they are sometimes high off the ground for environmental
 
reasons  (in the deep south and Mississippi River area .
... )
.
 
Can't tell whether this is George Lebonte's house or

2.  La Vielle Maison. 
Drove to the Wallagrass community (Soldierm
 
Pond)  and studied La Vielle Maison -- the Phyllis Perreault housl
 
and barn.
 Met her father,  81-year old Roland Perreault also.
 
*  SEND COURTESY PRINTS to them at R.  Perreault,  Route 1
,  Box
 
1266,  Soldier Pond,  Maine 04781.  
The barn is an early type three-bay gable roof Acadian barn,
 
built ca.  1880.
 It was shingled.
 It's in pretty bad shape.
 
Both house and barn were built of frame, with circle sawn
 
lumber.
 Very nice examples.
 Both originally shingled, and the
 
walls of the house are quite interesting because they were
 
insulated with layers of boards, and sawdust used as insulation
 
between one of the layers; the roof system uses tar paper as we
 
for insulation.
 It's altogether an interesting place.
 I 
Perreault.
 Mrs. Michaud was his aunt a nd he spent a lot of time
 
I visited with Phyllis Perreault and her father,  81-year-old
 
Roland Perreault.
 The address is Route 1,  Box 1,  266 Soldier
 
Pond,  Maine,  04781.
 1 photographed them and I need to send
 
courtesy prints of the slides to them at his address.
 She
 
teaches school in Madawaska and has for 27 years driven back and
 
forth taught school there.
 She is 42 years old.
 
They grew potatoes and next year they might ploy it over and
 
plant timothy or clover to feed horses.
 Mr. Roland Perreault
 
lived there as little boy.
 It was his aunt's house.
 I believe
 
the name was Michael.
 Quite a nice place.

I expressed my view that the research would be valuable and
 
important for future generations and that I would hope and pray
 
that the National Park Service develops an appropriate kind of
 
cultural heritage center that people like the Perreault family
 
would have respect for and be proud of as the research attempts
 
to conserve and interpret the story of the Acadian people in the
 
St.  John River valley.
 I really do hope that the Park Service
 
can pull it off.
 
Drove to the Plourdes community further north on Maine 11 and
 
photographed the Plourdes Store.

4.  Stopped in Ft.  Kent at the colleqe office and did some
 
miscellaneous work and xeroxing of materials for my reports /
 
writing.
 
MAP-HM-F062991. D
 
The Federal style or Greek Revival type roof eave detailing,  in
 
which there is a return at the point where the roof line meets
 
the front in back wall is a distinctive feature of the
 
architecture in the St.  John Valley.
 For early buildings and
 
more modern buildings well into 20th century,  that particular
 
style,  which might general be thought of as federal along with
 
the Georgian sort of plan is important here.
 
Photographed the house # 102 on Highway 11,  which is also
 
Market Street in Fort Kent,  with two large Gothic gables added
 
onto the front of the house to make it more Gothic than federal.
 
It is a kind of yellowish color and there is a big garage sale
 
going on as are numerous places around here.
 
5.  Drove to Fort Kent National Historic Landmark (certified 1977)
 
and recorded this log blockhouse,  built in 1839 of magnificent
 
hewn cedar logs.
 The blockhouse was built during the time of
 
border disputes and threats of different kinds of "war" between
 
British and American forces.
 
It has a hipped roof.
 The interior dimensions are 20 x 20-7
 
inches.
 The logs are joined at the corners by the half-lap
 
variation of square notching.
 The walls are cedar logs hewn
 
square and set flush.
 They measure c.  8 x 16 inches.
 They walls
 
are punctuated by gun ports  (see fieldnote sketches).
 
Fort Kent is apparently the only original "block house"  left
 
in the region.
 There were never many.
 The structure was altered
 
many times through the years.
 Yet it's a fine building and very
 
valuable historic site.
 It's operated by the Maine Bureau of
 
Parks and Recreation.
 
(See other notes on Fort Kent blockhouse.)
 
6.  Had a "hamburg" and french fries for lunch.
 Coffee.
 Hamburg 
is the local term for "hamburger" and the word is spelled that
 
way  (hamburg)  on printed menus in restaurants and small cafes.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.7
 
7.  New Brunswick 
Architectural traverse,  Clair to Grand Falls.
 
MAP-HM-F062991 . E
 
Crossed into New Brunswick,  Canada at Ft.  Kent and drove through
 
Clair and other towns.
 I drove much of the length of the study
 
area,  from Clair,  N.B.  to Grand Falls,  where I crossed back into
 
the U.S.  and returned via Van Buren,  Madawaska,  and Ft.  Kent.
 
As I drove toward St.  Basile  (
"San Bazeel"),  I saw many
 
familiar houses,  both the Acadian Georgian plan houses and larger
 
Victorian houses  (often four-square)  with hipped roofs.
 
Some of the large four-square hipped-roof houses are on
 
farms with Acadian barns,  and several have attached Acadian style
 
barns on the back.
 I saw a number of Quebec/French type roofs
 
that curl slightly upward at the eaves.
 
On New Brunswick provincial highway 220 driving south along
 
the cusp of the St.  John River  (Riviere St.  Jean);  here is the
 
same connectedness of houses old and younq with the garage or
 
other small portions of structures all tied together.
 Usually
 
the parts are attached laterally facing the river and highway,
 
which here run right along side by side.
 
At 5.5 miles south of Clair I photograph the St.  John River
 
and Maine landscape across.
 The church in the distance is in the
 
town of Baker Brook,  six miles south of Clair; tall beautiful
 
steeple easily visible from both sides of the river.
 
Along this part of the road,  about six miles from Clair,  I
 
see a lot of white frame houses with their two full stories and
 
square and hipped roofs.
 That may be an important kind of farm
 
house here.
 There are some really beautiful large gambrel roof
 
frame barns,  some of them are bank barns built into the hill.
 
I photographed an old French house on the south edge of
 
Baker Brook.
 It looks like it's been restored nicely and
 
recently.
 It has a sort of light gray side in the
 sang de boeuf
 
color;  shingles;  chimneys outside and chimneys are cut in porch
 
on the left side.
 It looks like it's two rooms deep and has a
 
hipped roof with a sweeping eaves.
 It is a fabulous house.
 
Eight kilometers from St.  Hilaire,  and here are first really
 
huge modern silos I've seen,  at the mill of a family named as
 
Daigle  (spelled the same as the Daigle family across the river in
 
Maine).
 I see the same shade of ox-blood red color here that
 
I've seen in Maine together with a light gray on vehicles and
 
houses.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday) ,
 p.8
 
In this area one can very easily see the arpent land
  
division system, reaching up from the river and highway and
 
railroad tracks toward the hills to the east.
 
Photographed white and black house #599 on the highway in
 
St.  Hilaire.
 Photographed the main side arpents across from St.
 
Hilaire  (Hilary).
 Driving south of St.  Hilaire,  I see many
 
interesting houses.
 Some of them are 19th century houses that
 
are the sort of a story and a half,  large)  parlor house with an
 
addition of a room,  the smaller version of the same thing
 
adjacent to one end.
 They do this over Maine too.
 That seems to
 
be a feature of Acadian houses.
 The smaller room is stepped back
 
from the main fixed square of the house.
 "Square of the house"
  
is the term I've heard for the long part,  or the main part of an
 
old house.
 The "square of the house" has changed over the years.
 
In the Varret community,  elaborate houses photographed in
 
black and white.
 Right next to #69 color also bright blue roof
 
on a white house with a cut-in porch and bright blue trim seems
 
to be pretty popular in this village of Varret,  just north of
 
Edmonston,  New Brunswick.
 
I want to mention that the French people have a way of
 
speaking that includes a way of saying "yeah",  in which they suck
 
in their breath at the same time they say it....
 Both men and
 
women do this,  older people especially,  when you talk to them and
 
they want to give emphasis to something they are saying that are
 
affirmative,  they'll say that that way.
 
It's getting more urban and more traffic now.
 We are within
 
view of Edmonston and Madawaska,  Maine.
 Along this highway,  most
 
of the business signs are both in English and French.
 So for
 
example there is "Mini Marche" which is the Mini Mart.
 
In Edmonston.
 There is a Kentucky Fried Chicken place here.
 
Signs are bilingual and the same shape as in the States.
 I
 
thought I could get up high on the hill to get a good picture of
 
Madawaska,  but the only really good building site high on the
 
hill is completely built up with the Catholic church,  and a great
 
stone beast it is at that.
 There is a Masonic temple here,  No.
 
40 AF&AN.
 The smell of the paper mill here in Edmonston is
 
really quite bad,  quite severe.
 It is rather pleasant in a sense
 
on the other but here it just makes you sick your stomach.
 This
 
air pollution from the paper mills is horrible right in the city
 
of Edmonston.
 It's almost unbearable.
 
In the village of San Basile,  photographed color and black
 
and white a really marvelous huge Quebec barn and whole farm with
 
gambrel roof quite two story house.
 The barn is red,  very long,
 
five,  six bays and hill wooded above.
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.9
 
8.  Maison de Alexis St.  Cyr. 
In St.  Basile, New Brunswick,  on NB
 
highway 144;  across the St.  John River from St.  David
 
(Madawaska),  Maine.
 
MAP-HM-F062991. F
 
I recorded the hewn log Maison de Alexis Cyr, a historic c.  1800
 
horizontal log house that has been moved here and reconstructed
 
by a local preservation group.
 The site overlooks the St.  John
 
River and is adjacent  (too close,  probably)  to the St.  Basile
 
catholic church's cemetery.
 
Its form is of a standard Anglo-American single-cell house
 
(gable roof,  centered front door,  chimney in the gable).
 
Compare this dwelling to the Parent-Roy log house at the
 
Acadian Village open-air museum,  across the river in Frenchville.
 
The small sign on the front of the building says  (as best I
 
can quickly translate it while reading it):
 
The Alexis Cyr house,  built at the beginning of
 
the 19th century by Alexis Cyr at 2.4 kilometers up the
 
St.  John river,  facing across erected on the south
 
shore for the Acadian pioneers of Madawaska landed in
 
1785.
 Inherited by successive Cyr generations down to
 
Isidore Cyr.
 1981 donated by the Cyr family to La
 
Societe de Historique du Madawaska.

9.  Pioneer memorial chapel. 
Also here I recorded a very nice
 
piece-sur-piece en colombaqe memorial chapel,  built to honor the
 
Acadian pioneers.
 
There is a sign in French on the front that gives a list of
 
the pioneers who are on the official list from the records of
 
Jonathan O'Dell,  the Colonial Commissioner.
 A lot of the names
 
are familiar from the Maine side -
-
 Pelletier,  Daigle,  Cyr,  etc.
 
The sign says that most of the concessioners had arrived with the
 
first contingent at the end of June 1785. 
Apparently the
 
building was built in 1960 in honor of the Pioneers of Madawaska.
 
It's "Monument Souvenir,  1785-1960."
 Pioneer is spelled
 
pionniers. 
At the bottom it says something which I take to mean
 
"let those who come after us remember."
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.10
 
This is a little chapel that has a cross at the top,  and it
 
has a Quebec type roof system that has a little curl at the eaves
 
that RB comments on.
 It's a really nice little building,  built
 
to honor the pioneers of Madawaska.
 The memorial chapel is not
  
an ancient buildinq but it is a very nice modern permutation of
  
piece-sur-piece construction technoloqy of the Acadians and St.  
John valley. 
I can't get inside either of these buildings; they
 
are locked museums.
 But I can see through the windows and
 
measure them completely from outside and by extrapolation I can
 
deduce the interior measurements and arrangements.
 Both are
 
quite interesting Quebec buildings.
 
This building,  built 1960,  is a modern version of piece-sur-
piece construction,  and en colornbage to boot.
 Here the vertical
 
spaced columns that receive the madriers (horizontal logs)  are
 
simply pine poles that have been skinned and flattened only on
 
the sides that face the interior of the building.
 Outside,  they
 
are left in the round.
 The small pine poles that serve as the
 
madriers are not sided or covered in any way.
 The whole thing is
 
painted a deep red color.
 
Oakum is used for insulation / chinking / caulking between
 
the logs in the bearing walls.
 
Although the structure is essentially in the shape of a
 
standard rectangular house  (20-6 x 24-4 outside),  placement of
 
its entry door in the gable end is significant,  and separates it
 
as a chapel or other building instead of a dwelling  (whose doors
 
are in the "long" side aligned with the roof ridge).
 A very fine
 
building.
 
10.  New Brunswick architecture,  comments
 
MAP-HM-F06299l.H
 
Left San Basile at about 4.00 p.m.  and continued south,  from the
 
provincial highway onto a larger provincial highway,  Highway 2
 
Trans-Canada Highway  (a national highway).
 
I passed several barns,  larqe Ouebec barns,  the gambrel roof
 
variety. 
They have shingling on some of the interior walls to
 
help insulate the animals in the winter,  as they do in Maine and
 
as they do in the barn that they built to reconstruct the barn
 
type at the Clair Historical Society Museum.
 
Photographed buildings in Riviere-Verte  (
"Green River"), the
 
next town south of San Basile.
 Over here on the New Brunswick
 
side I don't see the potato houses like I see on the main side of
 
the St.  John;  there are not that many growers.
 I see one potato
 
house,  partially demolished;  soon I see some though.
 I get to
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.11
 
more of a potato growing area.
 This is a very rich area for
  
vernacular architecture of the British and French types,  very
 
rich south of San Basile.  
I made a stop south of Green River to photograph an
 
exemplary three-bay Acadian barn with a qable roof and vertical
  
board siding. 
The section that is shingled is the south bay
 
where the animals were kept.
 The north bay is not shingled nor
 
is the rest of the barn.
 There is a shed addition on the rear of
 
the barn  This is a very nice example of the three-bay side-
opening gable roof,  early type Acadian barn.
 This barn is
 
located about a mile north of Sainte-Anne, a small agricultural
 
village of a broad rolling countryside,  very nice looking
 
country.
 This village has a huge dark stone twin tower Catholic
 
church on the highest point in town,  looking toward the river and
 
aligned with the river  (
just is in every town I've see so far).
 
People in New Brunswick seem almost all of them drive with
 
their headlights on on this major national highway.
 They don't
 
do that in the United States very much.
 This is more or less
 
like a interstate highway with limited access.
 There aren't many
 
signs telling you much but as you get off and go through the
 
towns themselves there are signs telling where you are.
 
The New Brunswick people like red on their houses and cars.
 
But it's not the ox-blood as in Maine.
 Over here that red is
 
really bright,  glossy red.
 
Radio announcers refer to this region as "the Atlantic
 
provinces" of Canada on the Canadian stations.
 
In the villaqe of St.  Leonard at about the 45 mile mark
 
(from Clair,  NB).  At north town limit of St.  Leonard,
 
photographed a nice connected farmstead around the edge of the
 
town,  a lot of structures put together;  nice example of pale-
yellow color.
 St.  Leonard,  New Brunswick is a small agricultural
 
town that is located directly across the river from Van Buren
 
Aroostook country,  Main.
 They are opposite each other.
 That's
 
one of the few places you can actually cross over the river.
 
Photographed the St.  Leonard-Parent parish church,  a Catholic
 
church,  a white frame building.
 
Photographed another large gambrel roof,  shingled New
 
Brunswick barn south of the St.  Leonard church.
 
11.  Back into the States
 
Into the southeastern corner of Aroostook County study area,
 
architectural comments;  connected farmsteads.
 Passed through
 
Count y
Grand Falls,  
.
NB,  and over the border into the 
 
a
north on Highway 
long
1 toward Van Buren 
 
Connected farmsteads. 
Down around this end of our study region,
 
I've noticed some farmstead arrangements in which there is a
 
white farm house -- story and a half with a gable to the road
 
about one room wide,  door and gamble interfacing in the road an
 
the river and a long narrow series of rooms connected to it,  al
 
lined up.
 I haven't that many places except over on the Canadi
 
side between St.  Leonard and Grand Falls and along this side of
 
the river just inside the border.
 I 
The mileage looks like it's about 72,  and here there is a
 
very large twin barn along here facing the river,  very large,
 
overlooking the river.
 Here is the junction with U.S.  1.
 
I
 Sback in Madawaska;

 at
 
There is a very nice double barn (
"twin barn")  just about a mile
 
south of the city limit sign of Fort Kent on Highway 1;  shingled,
 
much like the Labrie barn except it's not painted or has not been
 
painted recently;  it's not in Madawaska.
 I think this is the
 
same twin barn that is featured in the slender article in the
 
geography journal  (Journal of Cultural Geography) in about 1981.
 
Fort Kent. 
I took a last series of photographs,  in color,  comi
 
in on the Main Street in Fort Kent,  just before getting to the
 
junction of 161  (a big square house).
 I continued to shoot
 
pictures of the streetscape on the east side of Highway 1 comin
 
into town.
 I turned at the corner of Highway 11,  ending that
 
group of photos.
 I am going now to the office at Fort Kent for
 
few minutes to wrap up a couple of things.
 I drove 126 miles
 
from Clair,  New Brunswick down to the bottom of the circle and
 
back up around,  across the Grand Falls and back to Fort Kent;  a
 
circle that makes about 126 miles.
 I 
After stopping at the college field office,
 I drove
 
Pleasant Street,  which is Highway 11,  and headed for Eagle Lake.
 
I took a picture of a one-and-half story yellow Acadian house.
 
Continued heading south,  photographed slides and a couple ofblack
 
and white pictures just past Plourdes Store over the crest of the
 
hill looking down on Soldier Pond,  looking south,  showing
 
Marshall fieldnotes 06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.13
 
field patterns and houses and so on,  nearing the valley of the
 
Perreault farm that I measured early this morning.
 
I stopped at the crest of the next hill,  shooting photos
 
from Maine highway 11 looking east toward the back settlements
  
(concessions) .
 I see a number of farms lined out across the
 
hills and the arpent system is clearly visible in this picture.  
What I did here:  shot photos south toward Eagle Lake and panned
 
left in an arc 180 degrees to capture the road running around to
 
the east and then to the north of the landscape.
 Location:  on
 
the hill just north of the Villaqe Grocery on Me.  11.
 
Drove up another hill heading just about due south;  this old
 
community surely has a name but I can't figure it out.
 It's the
 
community where the Correaveau  (SP?)  Carpentry Construction
 
business is located.
 I went up another hill and down the other
 
side.
 Here is the Perreault house and barn on the left and
 
further on is Wallagrass Stream.
 So the place I shot the
 
pictures is a couple of hills north of Wallagrass Stream.
 Then
 
up the hill with the Freeman farm on the right or west side,  to
 
the turnoff to the east that goes to Soldier Pond on 161.
 That
 
was the distance of right around seven miles south of Fort Kent.
 
13.  Village layout,  continued
 
MAP-HM-F062991 .K
 
It's not easy for the stranger to know what community he is in,
 
because all of these communities are linear communities anchored
 
either by a Catholic church or by a store
 (grocery and all-
purpose general store)  and houses and farms scattered around in a
 
linear pattern,  no doubt as a reflection of the arpent system of
 
land division in the earlier times.
 In a lot of these
 
communities,  there is one every couple of valleys,  a mile two or
 
three apart.
 Many of them don't have signs or names,  some of
 
them don't have stores any more.
 
Here is the beautiful Eagle Lake we reached just about four
 
miles on.
 I got back to Eagle Lake headquarters shortly at 8.00
 
p. m.,  Saturday night,  June 29,  1991.
 This was my last day of
 
field research in studying vernacular buildings in the St.  John
 
River valley with particular attention to Acadian cottages of
 
Georgian plan and federal look from the early 19th century.
 
14.  The last photograph of my field trip was a slide of Eagle
 
Lake taken from the porch of the Phil Brown house  (our lodging).
 
I am finishing writing this draft of the field notes at midnight,
 
Saturday 06-29-91,  and will have them ready to send to Taylor at
 
Marshall  fieldnotes  06-29-91  (Saturday),  p.14
 
the Library before long.
 Must leave by 7.00  in the morning to
 
drive to Bangor to turn in the Avis rented car and catch my plane
 
flight from Bangor to Boston  (where I change for St.  Louis and
 
then change for Columbia).

August 28,  1991:  
PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of piece-sur-piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal  log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombage (which is characterized by vertical  log
 
construction).
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre;  Moogk references.)

VII.  Field research day seven,  06-30-91  (Sunday)  
1.  I left the Eaqie Lake lodqinq at 6.15 a.m., with enough time
 
en route to the Bangor airport to see more of the Bangor area as
 
a way to refine some comparative notions about the differences
 
between the St.  John River Valley and other parts of Maine.
 
MAP-HM-F063 09 1. A
 
The state highways have "frost heaves"  spaced apart. 
Road
 
building up here is a very difficult job because,  like Colorado
 
or some mountain state,  you have a short season to work on the
 
highways.
 The cold and freezes are rough,  and you have to keep
 
working on highways continuously to keep them in any kind of
 
shape.
 In Maine,  the frost heave is a place that the highway
 
department purposely leaves unpaved;  it is packed with hard
 
gravel on the surface,  and that allows winter changes, moisture
 
and temperature to have a place to expand and contract rather
 
than racking the pavement itself.
 
I'll also mention the term "hedgehog," used instead
 
groundhog.
 Stream and brook both are terms used instead of the
 
word creek.
 I have a feeling that streams are larger than brooks
 
and on the upper hand of all that of course is the word river,
 
which is the major water course.
 
Marshall fieldnotes,  06-30-91  (Sunday),  p.2
 
Stopped on Highway 11 about two miles south of Patten -
-
 in
 
Penobscot County -
-
 to photograph,  to the west,  Mount Katandin in
 
Baxter State Park.
 No trip to Maine is complete without a
 
picture of Mt.  Katandin according to Prof.  Coolidge in his book
 
on the Maine woods.
 At this point I am out of the research area,  
far away now 30 miles or so from the St.  John River valley.  
2.  Connected farmsteads,  more. 
I am at mile 88 starting from the
 
Eagle Lake field lodgings and I am seeing a number of really
 
beautiful connected farmsteads with a sort of plan written about
 
in Hubka's Biq House,  Little House,  Back House,  Barn, which is
 
about New England connected farmsteads.
 These look to be from
 
the Victorian period or the mid-te late 19th century or early
 
20th.
 There are lots of them around Patten and the older farm
 
houses that I am seeing -
-
 I am seeing a few Georgian form houses
 
-
-
 have a separate shingled barn.
 Many of them are transverse-
crib in type.
 I don't see any really early looking farms that
 
are of the connected form although some may incorporate earlier
 
houses or earlier barns that have been built in different stages.
 
The connected farmsteads that I've been seeing -
-
 the houses
 
are white,  Federal or Greek Revival with the gable towards the
 
highway and in some cases a quite narrow house in connection with
 
many connected buildings.
 
3.  Comm ents on government in the St.  John valley
 
MAP-HM-F063091. B
 
Aroostook County is enormous and the county seat is way down at
 
the bottom side at Houlton,  a very long drive from our part of
 
the St.  John Valley.
 RB says that the township thus becomes
 
quite important in governing the local affairs.
 Township borders
 
are posted on little sign post with the name of the township on
 
the vertical painted sign between townships and Aroostook County.
 
This is what they feel is their handiest unit within the enormous
 
county itself.
 
4.  To Bangor. 
I noted architecture en route,  particularly notice
 
the marvelous connected farmsteads south of Ashland beyond
 
Aroostook County.
 Bangor  ("Ban'gore" not "Banger'")  is some 175
 
miles from Eagle Lake  (to the airport exit in Bangor).
 
5.  Hampden.  Maine  (NOT IN THE STUDY AREA)  
MAP-HM-F063 091. C
 
Marshall fieldnotes,  06-30-91  (Sunday),  p.3
 
I drove through the town and vicinity of Hampden,  a town on the
 
Penobscot River immediately south and adjacent to  (according to
 
town lines)  the city of Bangor.
 This is an area of exemplary
 
Colonial and early coastal Maine vernacular building.
 Many
 
extravagantly lovely 18th century Georgian / Federal houses of
 
large size,  with Greek Revival detailing.
 
I saw British and American house types,  and there are no or
 
virtually no French houses here.
 There are Greek Revival
 
cottages,  and so on,  and Cape Cod house types.
 Here there are
 
even a few really fine big Georgian I houses.
 They have big
 
central chimneys,  the big I houses and the Cape Cod houses.
 In
 
town these Gothic and Federal and Greek houses with their gables
 
to the street and other houses too have connected structures and
 
barns behind them.
 
This is the first town I've seen in this area that has a
 
number of features different from St.  John valley.
 One of the
 
main things is that it has a beautiful and grand Masonic temple
 
right on the main drag.
 Practically every big white house from
 
19th century on the main street here has connected outbuildings
 
and barns way at the tail end of it,  sometimes in an L shape and
 
sometimes straight back.
 None of these old Georgian houses,  one
 
of them is dated 1807,  have shingling for siding;  they're all
 
horizontal lapped weather boarding,  painted wide.
 This is an old
 
road obviously,  paralleling the Penobscot River to my right
 
(east).
 Can't see it because everything is too grown up,  but
 
will be able to see the river in Bangor.
 
6.  Leavinq. 
In driving through downtown Bangor,  I observe the
 
first African American person I have seen since coming to Maine.
 
I made it to the Bangor airport in time to turn in the Avis
 
car and board my plane for Boston,  Massachusetts.
 There I
 
changed for a plane to St.  Louis.
 At St.  Louis I boarded another
 
small propeller-driven plane for Columbia.
 I reached Columbia at
 
7.40 p.m.,  Sunday evening.
 It was 94 degrees in Columbia and
 
very humid;  it had been in the 90s in northern Maine,  but it was
 
more pleasant there because of the lack of such heavy humidity.
 
I drove a total 861 miles in the Avis rental car.
 
The English language will probably never recover from its
 
experience of being used in these fieldnotes.
 I'm particularly
 
bad at mixing tenses when I (as I
)  write these notes.
 Oh,  well.

7.  Closing comments
  
MAP-HM-F063091 . D
 
This has been an excellent research trip.
 I was able to study a
 
dozen or more buildings in the St.  John River valley in some
 
detail and to approach an understanding of their construction to
 
some degree of completeness.
 The result is a fairly good,
 
comprehensive understanding of the main traditions of 18th,  19th,
 
and early 20th in vernacular architecture in the St.  John valley.
 
My concentration on Acadian houses of the early 19th
 
century,  and on barns,  seems to have been a good decision -
-
 in
 
terms of the most important research questions I developed,  and
 
in terms of the Park Service's eventual desire or need to
 
identify and interpret the mainstream historic Acadian vernacular
 
building traditions.
 Ray and I have been calling these "St.  John
 
valley Acadian cottages," and the term seems to fit decently
 
well.
 
I had a good glimpse of relevant architectural traditions on
 
the Canadian side from about Clair to Grand Falls,  New Brunswick.
 
I'm concerned about completeness,  management issues,  and
 
appropriateness of interpretation as the Park Service develops
 
their Acadian cultural heritage center.
 
I am also aware that there have been numerous studies of
 
Acadian cultural heritage and folklife well before the current
 
Library of Congress project.
 Indeed,  there have been some
 
studies of Acadian architecture in Maine,  and there are surely
 
many citations I have yet to discover or explore.
 
One of the lacks in my stint of field research will be well
 
attended to by the work Guy Dubuy is able to do.
 His work will
 
be especially important in terms of tracking down information
 
about specific houses I've studied -
-
 their families,  their
 
builders,  their sagas.
 
One of the things I can't do in the present project is
 
"follow up."
 Follow up research trips are crucial for eventual
 
completeness and satisfaction.
 I'll simply have to live with the
 
somewhat tentative voice of my opinions and general views of
 
Acadian building.
 
We must always bear in mind that our research prolect is a
  
brief survey and not intended to provide "the last word." 
If the
 
research is conducted skillfully,  and I believe it has been in
 
the instance of the Maine Acadian Cultural Survey,  the materials
 
Marshall fieldnotes,  06-30-91  (Sunday),  p.5
 
gathered can be an excellent foundation for a number of further
 
investigations,  ethnographic efforts,  publications,  interpretive
 
schemes,  etc.
 
We have a good start on Acadian vernacular architecture in
 
the St.  John valley,  and I would be interested in returning for
 
further work or for consultation with the Park Service.

I'd be willing to offer some recommendations on interpreting St.
 
John valley architecture.
 I'd be willing to make recommendations
 
about the National Park Service's potential development of the
 
cultural heritage center for the Acadian culture area.
 
It seems to me that there are some resolvable tensions
 
between the different spots and groups along the St. John on the
 
American side as to what community would physically get the
 
National Park Service's main cultural heritage center.
 This
 
remains to be seen, and perhaps there can be a number of sites
 
situated throughout this district that can give people in
 
different communities a sense of participation no matter which of
 
the main towns they may live in.
 Here I am thinking of the main
 
towns like Van Buren, Madawaska, and Fort Kent.
 
I would be interested in writing a small guidebook on the
 
Acadian vernacular buildings of the St.  John valley for the Park
 
Service's interpretive purposes  (ideally written for a general
 
audience and made available to visitors).
 This could be an
 
booklet on the Acadian vernacular of the St.  John River Valley
 
Marshall fieldnotes,  06-30-91  (Sunday),  p.6
 
much like the Park Service's booklet on the Walker Homestead
 
booklet in Tennessee.
 I'd also be interested in collaborating
 
with Ray Brassieur,  and perhaps Brassieur and Guy Dubuy,  in
 
producing a good,  solid introduction to the Acadian vernacular
 
buildings of the St.  John valley.
 Such a book  (paperback,
 
perhaps 200 pages,  with many illustrations)  would be quite nice
 
when the Park Service begins to develop their project and people
 
begin wanting things to read on the region.
 
That's all,  Folks.
 Merci beaucoup.

PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
piece-sur-piece construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Piece-sur-piece en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of piece-sur-piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombage (which is characterized by vertical log
 
construction).
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre; Moogk references.)
 
Thus,  the above comments SUPERSEDE references in the
 
following fieldnotes -
-
 that could not be corrected due to the
 
pressure of the deadline for fieldnote submission.
 
Also,  please note that my Glossary (fieldnotes appendix)  has
 
been corrected to reflect our latest evaluations as stated above.

 Glossary I'm working on -- St.  John Valley Frenc
 
Here is a rough draft of my glossary of architectural terms
 
(mainly)  for the St.  John Valley Acadian language.
 You'll see
 
many places to make corrections and edits.
 
This isn't an exhaustive treatment of the "literature" or
 
"sources" elsewhere,  but more of a field report on some of the
 
interesting words I encountered and that you told me about.
 
I'd like to at minimum send it in to the Library of Congress just
 
as an appendix to my fieldnotes.
 Maybe later it could be used in
 
some kind of journal or publication;  I'm obviously just imitating
 
McDermott's glossary on Mississippi Valley French.

MAINE ACADIAN PROJECT
 
August 1991
 
FIELDNOTES:  APPENDIX
  
Toward a Glossary of Acadian French Terms Related to
 
Vernacular Architecture and Cultural Landscape  in
  
the St.  John River Valley of Maine
  
NOTE:  This  is  a preliminary qlossary and not for citation or  
reproduction.
 It is for research and reference purposes only.  
PREFACE
 
This glossary was prepared from field research conducted in the
 
St.  John River valley of northern Maine  (Aroostook County)  in
 
1991.
 It makes no attempt to be historical and,  based only a
 
short-term ethnographic project,  it cannot be as thorough as we
 
would like.
 It is meant to be useful to students of Acadian
 
French material culture broadly in the United States.
 
Most of the terms can be located in a good dictionary of the
 
French language  (Le Petit Robert, Cassell's,  Collins's).
 Some
 
terms are found  (heard)  only in the living context of spoken
 
Acadian French language as used by people in the St.  John valley.
 
There are studies of French vernacular building traditions
 
of various sorts  in North America  (see especially the section in
 
Gowans 1964,  Kniffen and Glassie 1965,  Moogk's
 book,  and Edwards
 
in Upton 1987),  there is room for thinking about what we shall,
 
in our descriptive writings,  call the features of the technology
 
and the houses,  barns,  and other features related to architecture
 
and landscape.
 
Terminology used for Louisiana French houses  (Kniffen,
 
Edwards),  Missouri houses  (Thurman 1984,  Overby,  Peterson,  et
 
al.)  (in both places people like to call them "Creole houses")
 
and for those in Quebec  (Gowans,  Moogk,  et al.)  reflects local
 
dialect uses as much as it reflects articulate consideration by
 
-1-
Marshall "Glossary" 2
 
scholars.
 It is so,  as well,  for Acadian buildings in "the
 
County" along the St.  John River valley in the north of Maine.
 
There is,  not surprisingly,  disagreement among Acadian
 
scholars on these terms.
 The terms are not found in standard
 
dictionaries of architectural history and technology.
 Scholars
 
who have explored historic documents,  traveler's accounts,
 
diaries,  legal records,  etc.,  encounter a welter of different
 
spellings and interpretations.
 
A researcher familiar with published studies of French
 
Creole or Cajun building traditions in Louisiana will not
 
necessarily always know the permutation of an Acadian word in
 
northern Maine.
 In Louisiana,  the term colombage, for example,
 
is generally used in the published scholarship to denote heavy
 
frame or box construction with in-fill  (fachwerk in German; half-
timbering in English),  but in the St.  John Valley,  people
 
understand it to refer to a particular kind of piece-sur-pièce
  
(piece on piece)  construction in which vertical grooved columns
 
are employed to receive the ends of the flush horizontal pièces
  
(madriers). 
Still one of the best works,  although about French settlers
 
in a different region,  is McDermott's 1941 monograph,  A Glossary
  
of Mississippi Valley French 1673-1850. 
Professor McDermott,  who
 
taught French at Washington University and was widely conversant
 
with the Acadian experience in North America,  built his glossary
 
around searches of early documents and written materials in which
 
dialect terms and French terms appeared.
 McDermott found many of
 
the meanings of Mississippi Valley French "obscure,  difficult,  or
 
commonly confused"  in his classic glossary and this seems to
 
still be the case fifty years later.
 
The linguistics specialist may be able to track the unusual
 
or spoken-word terms to their origins and provenance,  but the
 
glossary here is meant only as an introduction.
 To get my
 
comparativist juices flowing,  I have noted terms found in
 
McDermott's glossary for the years 1673 to 1850;  they are noted
 
with an asterisk  (*).
 Some historic terms in McDermott were not
 
heard in Maine,  such as boulin for "log used in building houses
 
or fences"  (33),  and bousillage (used in Missouri today)  for the
 
chinking between logs in a building  (
34).
 
Some terms in McDermott have a different meaning in St.  John
 
Valley spoken French.
 For example,  carré in McDermott is
 
explained as the small space beneath a roof  (43),  but the
 
Acadians in the St.  John use the word qrenier for the space in a
 
building under the roof  (the loft or attic level);  they use the
 
word carré only for the space below the plates  (loft level).
 In
 
other words,  carré is the structural square that the roof sits
 
upon.
 
Marshall "Glossary"  3
 
Equally important,  and closer to our study area,  is the
 
outstanding collection of essays on Quebec vernacular houses,
 
their history and construction technology,  edited by Michel
 
Lessard and Gilles Vilandre  (La Maison Traditionelle au Quebec
 
1974)
 
The glossary I have begun here is based more on
 
conversations with scholars of Acadian culture today and based on
 
discussions with Acadian people in the St.  John River Valley of
 
Aroostook County,  Maine,  during a brief period of field recording
 
of vernacular buildings in this area during the summer of 1991.
 
One of the benefits that could eventually come from the MAP
 
project is the refinement of some Acadian / French vernacular
 
architecture terms,  and perhaps the creation and articulation of
 
one or more new terms.
 I am generally opposed to the invention
 
of new terms and typologies simply for their own sake or for the
 
sake of personal bent;  I prefer working with the given set of
 
terms and understandings and when necessary refining and giving
 
new perspectives to the accepted canon.
 (Sometimes one has to
 
take the plunge and invent a term,  such as the term "stack house"
 
needed to invent to describe a type of house in my study of
 
Missouri vernacular buildings,  Folk Architecture in Little Dixie,  
University of Missouri Press 1981.)
 
The woodworking traditions and technology,  much of it
 
European  (with specific American permutations and evolutionary
 
twigs off the old stems)  and much of it medieval in personality,
 
can be thought of for convenience in terms of the following
 
jargon that could be broadly followed by a researcher working in
 
any of the major North American Acadian landscapes.
 
A number of terms related to building and buildings are
 
English instead of French.
 Those important to understanding
 
vernacular architecture in this region are given.
 A note ENGL 
indicates that they are in this language and not in French.
 
It is assumed that the average reader will know terms such as
 
rafter, decking, plate, girt, collar beam, brace, peg I trunnel,  
mortise, tenon, sill,  sash, auger, broad axe, adze, frow, plank,  
tongue-and-groove, joinery, spline, roof pitch, whitewash, oakum,  
etc.
 Such terms are,  if need be,  easily found in any good
 
dictionary of the English language.
 
When words have synonyms or relevant definitions in the
 
standard Cassell's French Dictionary and the material appears
 
helpful,  this is indicated in parenthesis following the entry.
 
See,  for example,  entry for "planche."
 Words or definitions
 
contributed by C.  Ray Brassieur indicating reference to Louisiana
 
French are noted by CRB.
 
Marshall,  "Glossary" 4
 
Acknowledgement 
I thank C.  Ray Brassieur for his assistance in sorting out the
 
various Acadian terms and for help in reviewing this early and
 
preliminary version of the St.  John Valley architectural
 
glossary.
 
While I have some ability with printed French,  I have
 
difficulty in understanding words used by the people here in
 
describing architectural features -
-
 they have a special dialect,
 
of course,  that is hard for the outsider to decipher in oral use.
 
Here is another place where it is invaluable,  indeed imperative,
 
to have a "native" speaker of French,  like Ray Brassieur,  in such
 
a research project.
 
Working up this preliminary glossary was an excellent
 
exercise and will lead to some close rethinking of some of the
 
ideas in my fieldnotes  (especially concerning pièce
  
construction)
 
arnoire 
(*)
 Tall wooden cupboard made to store household
 
material such as dishes  (if in the dining room or kitchen)  or
 
clothing  (in a bedroom).
 The American English terms that can be
 
substituted,  depending on size and function,  are "wardrobe,"
 
"chifforobe,"  "press," and "sideboard."
 Armoire rouge (qros
  
rouge) is sometimes used to denote the special flat deep red
 
color  (also called sang de boeuf) historically painted on
 
armoires and other kinds of furniture in the Acadian household.
 
armoirette 
Shorter,  more typical Acadian furnishing  (cf.
 
arpent 
(arpent = acre;  equivalent to about one and a half
 
English acres / Cassell's 49  / *
)
 The official system of French
 
"long lot"  land division brought to North America with the first
 
Acadian settlers.
 An arpent is a unit of measure,  roughly 192
 
English feet in width; there is difference and confusion about
 
its precise dimensions historically  (Lessard and Vilandre give
 
the measurement as 191.835 English feet).
 
baluster 
ENGL 
Vertical post,  turned or rectangular,  supporting
 
batterie 
(batterie 
threshing floor;  batter en grange =
 
thresher;  batteuse 
threshing machine / Cassell's 83 / *)
 The
 
middle bay  (hall,  passage)  of a three-bay Acadian barn  (with
 
large opposed doors)  used as a threshing and winnowing area.
 
bay 
1L A
 between principal structural 
f
l
members
b
u
 
ild
in g,
 
The low outbuilding where sheep were kept on the Acadian farm.
 
brace 
ENGL 
45-degree angle support placed between vertical and
 
horizontal beams to increase stability; viz.  lien.  
camp 
ENGL Temporary shelter used by lumbermen and hunters,  or,
 
as often today,  a vacation or leisure-time cottage or dwelling;
 
viz.  chantier.  
carr6 
The space below the plates  (loft level)  of a house;  in
 
other words,  the structural square that the roof sits upon;
 
moving vertically,  the carr6 is the sills,  walls,  girts and
 
Marshall,  "Glossary"  6
 
cave 
(caveau =
 small cellar;  caver =
 to hollow out / Cassell's
 
136)
 The cool,  damp dug-out potato barrow or cellar beneath a
 
farm house where potatoes were stored before the coming of
 
railroads in the late 19th century led to the construction of
 
special potato houses at the rail heads in the late 19th century.
 
Cavereau -
-
 the entrance  (outside,  ground-level)  to the cave I
 
cellar,  usually covered with a shed or gable roof.
 
chinkinq 
ENGL 
Insulation or in-fill between the horizontal logs
 
in the bearing walls of a house.
 Peat moss,  birch bark,  and
 
buckwheat chaff all served the Acadians very well as chinking in
 
their pièce houses.
 As Ray Brassieur notes,  this chinking is
 
rather more like marine "caulking" than chinking  (of the sort
 
familiar in other regions of the United States where logs are
 
laid up with distinct gaps between them that require substantial
 
in-fill or chinking)  in cases where the logs or pieces fit
 
tightly.
 Since the logs fit flush,  the peat moss,  etc.,  works
 
well as chinking material.
 
comble cassé 
("broken comb"  / CRB)
 St.  John Valley French words
 
for "gambrel roof" familiar in the region,  on 20th century barns
 
especially.
 (comb not in Cassell's)
 
concession 
(*)
 Grants of lands to early settlers of means and
 
position.
 In later settlement,  this refers to the "back
 
settlements,"  lands granted or sold to settlers or the offspring
 
of original settlers coming after the initial lands were taken up
 
along the main areas bordering the river;  to be from one of the
 
"back settlements"  (away from the river in the interior)  still
 
means that one is not of the best social class and the term still
 
carries derogatory connotations  (e.g.,  "Ils vienent des
 
concessions.")
 
coulisse 
This is the groove cut in the edge of a board to
 
receive the tongue of the adjacent board in planche debut Acadian
 
construction.
 Coulisses are also taken to be the term for the
 
principal vertical groove cut into the columns for pièce
  
construction.
 
couverture 
(*)
 Roof of a building.
 (alternately comble)
 
cloture de pieu 
(CR8)
 Split post and rail fences with wire
 
fastenings.
 The historic term,  in McDermott,  is barriere. 
Pieu
 
historically,  in McDermott,  means a split or hand-riven post,
 
rail,  or stake  (117).
 
depannier 
(quick stop / convenience store)
 These are the local
 
variant of the American convenience stores,  but they are
 
privately-owned.
 They include many kinds of homemade local foods
 
and a wide variety of materials for sale.
 Many include video
 
rentals.
 Depannier is the word used on the store fronts in New
 
deuxi&me rang 
(deuxi&me = second)
 The second rank of land
 
holdings in the Acadian land division system based on the arpent
 
tradition of division and alignment.
 These were often of lesser
 
quality,  but they were developed prior to the "back settlements"
 
(concessions);  they were located in the lands well back from the
 
St.  John River's more sought after lands.
 
en colombage 
Elsewhere this term is sometimes used for what is
 
called half-timbered construction  (with heavy frame)  for British
 
Isles and British-American instances and for what is called
 
Fachwerk (GERMAN)  in German-speaking Europe and in most Germanic
 
communities in the U.S.

the St.  Jo hn
 V
a ll e y.
 
flats 
ENGL 
The low-lying landscape attractive for the earliest
 
Acadian agriculture,  commerce,  and settlement beginning at the
 
bank of the St.  River and running gently inland to the rise of
 
the hills beyond.
 
garconniere 
(bachelor's rooms / Cassell's 371;  CRB)
 The term in
 
Louisiana for the separate upstairs sleeping quarters used by
 
"the grand menage" 
(menage = housekeeping; menager = to save,
 
take care of;  thrifty,  frugal / Cassell's 481;  spoken term from
 
Mrs.  Geraldine Chasse,  Madawaska;  "the big housekeeping;"  "the
 
big upkeep"  / CRB)
 This is the annual cycle of spring cleaning
 
of one's house,  barns,  outbuildings,  yard,  etc.
 The Acadian
 
tradition of spring cleaning here goes far beyond the standard
 
American concept of "spring cleaning."
 They clean anything,
 
demolishing  (
"cleaning up")  old buildings that have fallen into
 
Marshall,  "Gl os s a r y"  8
 
disrepair and may be no longer fit or used.
 
This tendency or custom has significant ramifications for
 
historic preservation.
 When an old shed or outbuilding is
 
disused and falls into a state of neglect,  the annual round of
 
spring cleaning fever -
-
 a custom all the neighbors participate
 
in if they wish to be approved of -
-
 pressures the owner to get
 
rid of the unsightly old building.
 
In addition,  they resurface or tar all the driveways that
 
have been weathered by the winter past;  driveway resurfacing may
 
be the final piece of the spring cleaning chores.
 
grange 
Barn.
 The typical Acadian barn  (grange Acadien) of the
 
early period is a three-bay side-opening gable-roof barn much
 
like the so-called "English" barn in its floor plan.
 There is a
 
central passageway through the middle of the structure.
 There is
 
often a shed addition on one gable end.
 At least some parts of
 
this barn are sided with shingles,  particularly the areas  (inside
 
the barn as well as outside)  where farm animals were stabled
 
during the cold seasons.
 
grenier 
Greniers are the commodious sleeping and living spaces
 
under the roof.
 Each of the Acadian houses I have studied have a
 
grenier.
 Many of these are quite large and nicely finished,  some
 
being made into two rooms by the addition of a vertical board
 
partition divider wall.
 Some of the greniers are insulated with
 
birch bark and some are insulated with newspaper and
 other
 
materials.
 
In Louisiana,  this space is called qarconiere. 
Elsewhere
 
this space,  above the principal dwelling spaces of a house,  would
 
be called a loft (if it includes sleeping spaces)  or an attic (if
 
the purpose is essentially for storage and utility purposes).
 
qris 
Light grey color commonplace on early furniture and used
 
today in combination with sang de boeuf (gras rouge, ox blood
 
color)  by Acadian people of the St.  John Valley.
 It occurs in
 
frequently in a two-tone combination with sang de boeuf.  
half-dovetail 
ENGL This term is familiar to students of log
 
construction traditions throughout North America.
 The term,  of
 
course,  refers to the manner of joining hewn log bearing walls at
 
the corners in a carefully sawn joint reminiscent of
 
cabinetmaking in which half of a full dovetail is used.
 (Half is
 
all one needs to properly lock and hold the corners together.)
 
Half-dovetailing -
-
 tete de chien -
-
 along with V-notching,
 
are the two most prevalent log building cornering traditions in
 
the United States when hardwoods are being hewn and made into
 
buildings.
 
Marshall,  "Glossary" 9
 
There are examples of full dovetailing on log houses in the
 
New Sweden community,  built by Swedish immigrant farmers and
 
builders in the late 19th century.
 The house I photographed 06-
27-91 has this kind of cornering and the logs are set one on
 
another in the Scandinavian tradition;  the top of the log is
 
rounded but the bottom is concave,  so there is a very close fit
 
between the horizontal-laid logs in the bearing walls.
 The New
  
Sweden area log buildings are themselves very important and
  
worthy of intensive study.  
king's arrow A mark used by foresters to blaze or identify the
 
best of the old-growth white pine trees;  reserved by the English
 
crown,  they were mainly harvested and shipped out of the region
 
and used for ship's masts and spars in the Royal Navy in colonial
 
times.
 There were severe penalties for cutting a tree with a
 
king's arrow.
 The arrow has a fairly broad shaft and large arrow
 
head.
 Cut into the bark vertically,  pointing upward,  they
 
measured c.  6 to 8 inches.  (Discussed in Coolidge's History of
  
the Maine Woods; and see Marshall interview with Claude Cyr,
 
Madawaska,  06-25-91.)
 
lien 
Brace  (binding timber;  floor plank in a small boat /
 
lierne,  Cassell's 453)
 Diagonal wooden brace between vertical
 
and horizontal framing members or timbers in a barn.
 
log building 
ENGL 
For the Acadian vernacular buildings in the
 
St.  John Valley,  "log building" may describe any kind of
 
structure in which logs or timbers  (whether hewn on inside and
 
outside surfaces as in Germanic and Anglo-American log
 
construction or whether hewn of four sides or plank-sawn timbers)
 
are used in the bearing walls of the structure.
 
Predominant in the early phase of settlement are log
 
buildings of the Anglo-American variety as well as log buildings
 
that exemplify the finest Acadian tradition of horizontal log
 
buildings with the logs places very closed together,  frequently
 
with vertical posts anchoring the horizontal "pieces"  in the en
 
coulisse treatment.
 
Thus,  in this cultural region,  a "piece"  (pièce) is simply a
 
log or plank used in a bearing wall of a building.
 In this
 
region,  therefore,  and in contradistinction to the description in
 
the seminal essay by Fred Kniffen and Henry Glassie  (
"Building in
 
Wood in the Eastern United States"),  any log building with logs
 
placed horizontally to provide a bearing wall -
-
 no matter what
 
the method of corner-notching or corner-timbering -
-
 may be
 
thought of as pièce-sur-pièce construction.
 This is the
  
essential Acadian tradition in the St.  John River valley of
  
Maine.  
Either "log" or "piece" would be the most general
 
Marshall,  "Glossary"  10
 
categorical term for these buildings in this region.
 
A pièce is a log or plank.
 (SEE madrier)
 
madrier 
(thick plank)
 Dialect term  (CRB)  that frequently means
 
the same thing as pièce. 
A madrier measures ca.  2" x 8-10" c
 
16";  a pièce measures ca.  3-4" x variable.
 
maison House.
 
oakum 
ENGL 
Ropes of natural fibers untwisted and loosened to
 
make caulking for ships and buildings;  in the St.  John Valley,
 
oakum is sometimes found as caulking  (insulation)  between the
 
horizontal pièces or logs of a log house.
 
perche 
(CRB)
 Long pole used in barns.
 
panelling 
ENGL 
Many of the Acadian dwellings have panelled
 
ceilings inside,  and they are always  (well,  perhaps "always")
 
painted white.
 
peg 
ENGL Carved wooden peg or "trunnel" that secures mortise-
and-tenon and other kinds of Acadian joints in the framing of
 
buildings.
 The French term is cheville.  
The Acadians'  love of the trunnel. 
Trunnels  (wooden pegs -
-
cheville de bois) are the favorite device in this region for
 
locking joints in buildings.
 They provide a flexible but stout
 
lock for important joinery such as the rafter couples and all
 
manner of bracing and framing members.
 A trunnel is simply a
 
carved wooden peg that tapers gently throughout its length.
 It
 
is made from a sawn and rounded piece of pine or other wood.
 It
 
is used in a round hole made by an auger. 
Every farmer and
 
carpenter in this community in the 19th century was familiar with
 
augers and trunnels.
 "Trunnel"
 comes from the old English "tree
 
nail."
 There may well be an Acadian term for this kind of peg,
 
but I have not discovered one being used today  (June 1991).
 
This old and globally widespread practice of using pegs to
 
secure joints,  particularly mortise and tenon joints, gave rise
 
to the expression "square peg in a round hole."
 In fact,  one
 
wants a square peg in a round hole;  it does not seem to fit at
 
the beginning,  because the peg is actually carved just a little
 
bit larger than the hole but it is carved to only a partially
 
rounded shape.
 Many are more like a rough hexagon.
 The peg is
 
cut and shaped when fresh  (green)  and driven into the hole with a
 
mallet. 
The greenness of the trunnel makes it flexible enough to
 
be forced into the hole.
 Then,  when the peg dries,  it dries to
 
an extremely tight fit inside the augured hole through the tenon
 
and mortise joint.
 It is an ingenious technique and carefully
 
articulated to solve a critical problem:  how to join securely and
 
of nails or iron

Pi6ce construction involves the developing of a wall by
 
building up layers of horizontal hewn or sawn shaped logs or

There is a good historic photo of a New Brunswick pie
-ce-sur-
pi&ce house  (without weatherboarding)  on the St.  Jean River in Le
 
Brayon (Edmonston,  N.B.,  La Societe Historique du Madawaska),  6:1
 
(
janvier-mars 1978),  p.  14;  the house is a smaller version of the
 
Fred Albert House.
 
It is important to note that "pi6cell is a French word that
 
here in this Acadian region of Maine / 
New Brunswick may be used
 
by people to refer to a more standard log house as well as to a
 
house that contains actual Pi&ce-sur-pi6ce construction.
 "Pi6cell
 
simply means the piece that goes on another piece in the laying
 
up of a log house as well as in the laying down of a pi&ce-sur-
pi6ce en coulisse house.
 
One of the virtues of pi�
?ce-sur-pi6
_ce construction en
 
coulisse is that the builder is able to use short pieces  (logs,
 
planks)  instead of requiring longer lengths needed in the
 
standard Anglo or Germanic-American log building.
 (See Kniffen,
 
"Folk Housing").
 
Marshall,  "Glossary"  12
 
piqnon simple 
(piqnon =
 gable end / Cassell's 563)
 Literally
 
"simple gable," the term in the St.  John River region is used to
 
apply to the Acadian barn type with gabled roof,  the barn of the
 
early generation.
 
planche debout 
(planche =
 board or shelf / Cassell's 568;
 
planchette =
 small board; plancher =
 floor)
 This Acadian term
 
refers to the method of placing vertical boards  (ca.  2" x 8-17",
 
hand-planed or sash-sawn)  flush on the exterior and interior
 
walls of a house.
 The planche debout provides the insulation and
 
finishing for a wall,  because the system is employed here along
 
with piece-sur-pièce bearing wall construction.
 The vertical
 
boards are usually tongue-and-groove construction and fit tightly
 
together side by side from sill to plate.
 
In a house like the Fred Albert house  (Madawaska),  the
 
planche debout is itself finally covered on the exterior by
 
lapped horizontal weatherboarding.
 The "siding"  (lapped
 
horizontal weatherboarding)  serves to dress up the building in
 
style and it offers an additional layer of protection and
 
insulation against the tough Maine winters through which it must
 
give comfort.
 The historic term for standing timber in McDermott
 
is bois-debout.  
planche galbe 
(qalbe =
 plank with a jointed edge,  usually
 
tongue-and-groove)
 This is a tongue-and-grooved vertical board
 
that in assemblage makes the planche debout (vertical flush board
 
walling).
 
porche 
(porche,  porcherie) 
This is a term that some people
 
apply to a low "shed" or "lean-to" addition on the gable end of a
 
qrange Acadien (Acadian barn).
 Other people,  however,  such as
 
Mr.  Labrie in the St.  Agathe  (Agatha)  community,  declare that a
 
porche would only be used for stabling swine and for nothing else
 
(CRB 06-28-91).
 Both dialect usages are correct.
 
potato house 
ENGL This is the large barn that the individual
 
potato grower (farm owner)  builds adjacent to the railroad tracks
 
(Bangor and Aroostook RR [began operation 1889])  for the
 
temporary storage and preparation of harvested potatoes pending
 
their timely shipment to the market centers.
 These have fire
  
walls (ENGL) of concrete between them,  but often two or more
 
potato houses are attached end to end.
 
Potato houses -
-
 cave a
 patate -
-
 in the towns at the rail
 
heads of course cannot predate the coming of the railroad to that
 
particular location.
 So most of them date after the turn of the
 
20th century.
 Many are fallen into disuse,  and I do not believe
 
new ones are being built.
 
Another type of potato house is the barn on the potato

Marshall,  "6iossaryll  14
 
CRB speaks of these as nautical features reminiscent of boat
 
building practices  (there are other instances like this as well).
 
Ship's knees are a very important detail that marks and
 
identifies the construction technology of the St.  John Valley
 
Acadian cottages.
 It is possible that they represent a kind of
 
remembered architectural feature,  employed not so much in the
 
19th century for necessity  (these frameworks are extremely stout
 
as they are)  as for their reflection of older,  European timber
 
framing habits that were established  (briefly)  in this region of
 
Maine and New Brunswick.
 There are lovely examples of ship's
 
knees in The Fred Albert House  (Madawaska / St.  David)  and in the
 
Maison Daighie St.  Jean  (Clair,  New Brunswick).
 This term
 
(ship's knees)  is,  of course,  not French but English
 
linguistically.
 
Some citizens know and use the French term coude (
"elbow")
 
sonnet tubes 
Commercially-produced circular concrete pillars
 
used to support buildings in the St.  John valley.
 Used in the
 
reconstruction of the Fred Albert House  (Madawaska Historical
 
Society).
 (check with CRB field notes)
 
square of the house 
ENGL 
(carré) 
Local term for the primary or
 
original section of an Acadian house,  often made of some type of
 
log construction; usually,  the large one-room square space that
 
has been remodeled by adding rooms and fixtures.
 
twin barn A 19th and 20th century barn type that is an important
 
feature in the St.  John Valley's repertoire of vernacular
 
structures.
 It includes spaces for hay and grain storage,
 
threshing  (if need be),  and stalls for draft animals and
 
livestock.
 
The twin barn is a balanced,  symmetrical composition of
 
three structural elements:  a similar if not identical pair of
 
rectangular three-bay gabled-roof Acadian barns  (comparable to
 
the "English" barn type)  placed one behind the other with their
 
ridges parallel;  the third element is a framework  (its roof
 
transverse to the parallel roofs of the two main sections)  that
 
encloses the intervening space.
 Viewed from above,  the barn has
 
an "H" shape.
 
The twin barns observed in my field research are all built
 
of frame,  usually with a strong framework of mortise-and-tenon
 
construction employing large hand hewn sills,  posts,  beams,
 
braces,  girts,  and plates.
 Many twin barns are sheathed with
 
weatherboarding and this in turn sheathed with shingles to
 
provide additional protection.
 They may be painted red or left
 
to weather naturally to a shade of grey.
 
The D.  L.  Labrie twin barn in the St.  Agathe community is an
 
rsha1I,  "Glossary"  1
 
outstanding example of this historically-important and quite
 
picturesque structural type.
 
wainscotinq 
ENGL There is some panelling on the lower part of
 
interior walls,  and then it is called wainscoting (of vertical
 
boards,  small usually)  with a baseboard and a chair rail as a cap
 
on the wainscoting.
 Wainscoting,  like panelled ceilings,  is most
 
appropriate and most common in the finer rooms of a dwelling -
-
the front hail and the best parlor and best bedroom.
 Often there
 
is a relatively simple chair rail nailed horizontally on the wall
 
but installed without the wainscoting below.

PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION:  
At the start of the field research,  we were thinking of
 
pièce-sur-pièce construction as a subcategory of colombage
  
construction.
 Pièce-sur-pièce en coulisse does rely upon
 
vertical corner columns and intermediate vertical columns within
 
the spans of the walls.
 
But after reviewing the literature,  it seems more
 
appropriate to think of pièce-sur--piece, distinguished by
 
horizontal  log construction,  as something different from and
 
distinct from colombage (which is characterized by vertical  log
 
construction) .
 (SEE Lessard and Vilandre;  Moogk references.)
 
Thus,  the above comments SUPERSEDE references in the
 
following fieldnotes -
-
 that could not be corrected due to the
 
pressure of the deadline for fieldnote submission.
 
Also,  please note that my Glossary (fieldnotes appendix)  has
 
been corrected to reflect our latest evaluations as stated above.
