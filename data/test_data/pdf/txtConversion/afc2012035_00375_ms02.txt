RM — Rina Monarca 
 
 
CT: Please state your full name and the number of years you’ve been doing hair. 
 
RM: My full name is Rosaria Monarca and I’ve been doing hair about thirty-five years, I think, since I 
was sixteen and I’m fifty-two, so. 
 
CT: Is that R-O-S-A-R-I-A? 
 
RM: Yes, but no one calls me that. I’ve been called Rina since I was a baby. 
 
CT: And you are from Sicily? 
 
RM: Yes, I was born in Sicily. 
 
CT: What brought you to the US? 
 
RM: My parents came here when I was seven. At the time, in the ‘60s, it was ’67 that we came here 
and there was a whole block of people being immigrated here. My father had a brother who was 
born in the United States, then they moved back to Sicily and then the war broke out. Since he was 
an American citizen, my grandfather sent the oldest son to the United States when he was about 
eighteen, with just a few dollars in his pocket, you know, typical story. And he said, “When you can 
get your brothers to the United States, try to get them there too.” Because Sicily was pretty 
devastated after World War II, but then it took quite a few years by the time all that happened. 
My father was married with four kids and we had just moved into a new house. My mother had 
never seen anything other than her hometown so when these papers came allowing us to come to 
the United States, she would say, “Let’s just rip them up.” And my father said, “No, we’d be crazy, 
everybody’s leaving. I could get a job and I could make a ton of money and work for five years 
and make our money and then come back. So that was sort of the plan, but when you get here you 
don’t realize, you know, you need a car, you now are paying rent, because we used to own our 
own house and [had] no taxes at the time either, once you own your house, that’s it, there’s 
nothing, there’s no heating that we had to deal with [like] in Connecticut so all the expenses with 
four kids was huge. So the five-year plan turned into the ten-year plan. So we were living in a 
 
2 
family house of six apartment houses and they needed that building because they were going to 
rack it down and do something else with it, so they offered $300 to move out into another 
apartment or $4,000 if we bought a home, it was an initiative to buy houses so that was a down 
payment at the time, so my father thought, we’re just going to buy a house and take the $4,000 and 
that’s when my mother panicked and then she realized, we’re never leaving. 
 
CT: And where were you? 
 
RM: In Middletown, which is just twenty minutes south of here. So my Mom panicked and thought 
we’re never going to leave. Once you set roots and buy a house and at that point it had been a 
good ten years that we had been here already so my mother had just lost it and she said, in ’78 
we’re leaving. And my mother’s very sweet and she suffers from depression and stuff so I always felt 
bad for my mother and when she said, “Who’s going to come with me?” My brother and my sister, 
all four of us are like one year apart, my other sister was already in Italy. My sister Nella was 
running a restaurant and she was only seventeen, eighteen, Joe was busy, you know, being a guy 
and I was like “Ma, I’ll come with you. Don’t worry about it, I’ll come with you.” And I was only 
fifteen. Then I turned sixteen in November and that January when my girlfriend came to the high 
school, she said, “I’m in hairdressing school. I love it.” I said, “What do you mean you’re in 
hairdressing school? Don’t you have to be a certain age?” She said, “Sixteen, that’s all you have to 
be, sixteen. I love it. That’s what I’m doing. So, I went with my brother and my sister-in-law, all 
three of us and we had been there now a few months and we were doing great.” So that’s when I 
had my plan. I could see myself doing that. You know every time I went to the salon which wasn’t 
very often, I went to the salon, maybe once a year to get my hair cut and my mother too, once a 
year. But I loved the atmosphere, I loved doing hair, I always used to do everybody’s hair in my 
house so I could see myself very easily being a hairdresser. So I thought, alright, now I can go to 
Italy and I won’t be just a high school drop out, I’ll be a hairdresser.  
 
I got my license and I did it in record time. I did it in a year, to the day. I went in the morning at 
eight. Some days I stayed until ten o’clock at night, just to put in my hours because I still needed to 
hold on to my part-time job, it was this little bakery and nobody was there and I used to hold it 
open for the owner so she could leave early and I gained thirty pounds eating doughnuts, it was 
horrible. But I held on to that job because I needed gas money and so forth and my sister actually 
was the one who helped me pay for hairdressing school. And at the time, we weren’t really talking 
to my father much. He would just go to work…he saw it as you’re taking your mother’s side, and so 
he didn’t really talk to us much. He was always working too. So my sister and I, I was sixteen she 
was seventeen, we made the plan, she basically helped me pay for it, which at the time was $1,000 
and now I think it’s up to something like $18,000 for hairdressing school. It’s outrageous, it’s 
ridiculous. But back then it was $1,000 and she helped me finance it because she was working full-
time and she graduated early from high school. 
 
CT: So when you left with your mother, your mother was essentially leaving your father? 
 
RM: No. Italians from that generation just don’t up and leave and they do not divorce. Catholic... 
and all that. 
 
CT: That’s what I was thinking, so she was just moving. 
 
RM: She said, “I need a break and I need to leave.” So when we got there, she thought she was 
just going to say, “here I am, just for a little while.” And after a month, her girlfriends, her family 
 
3 
said, “Go back to your husband. What are you doing here? You can’t stay here, indefinitely.” They 
really kind of shunned her. I kind of saw that but then I got a job right away. And my sister who 
had been in Italy already she went to high school there, she took me to the best [hair salon] in 
Sicily. In the city of Syracuse. She said, “Rina, try here.” And he was busy actually and he said, 
“Okay, well maybe I’ll call you.” And then I went to two other salons and it was like “well if you 
want to hang out without pay.” And that’s how they kind of work it in Italy and then when you start 
producing, then they give you some money. And I thought, I went to school and I got my license but 
that really didn’t mean anything in Italy. Then Mario called me and I think he liked me because I 
spoke English, he thought that adds a little flair, a more international look to the salon. And he 
already had eighteen employees and I was one of the older kids there. I was eighteen, there were 
twelve year-olds, thirteen year-olds…in Italy, you have to finish the eighth grade to drop out but a 
lot of kids don’t even make it to the eighth grade. A lot of kids just start sewing or something else 
and the parents back then weren’t so into education and interestingly enough now Sicily has the 
most educated people because there’s no jobs so they keep sending their kids to school and the 
university is free so now it’s gone way to the other side where everybody has even their master’s 
and their doctorate but no job. It’s free, so as long as you can keep up the grades, you can go to 
school. But when I was there at eighteen, I was one of the older hairdressers. But you know 
already having been in school, I caught on really fast and I really loved it. 
 
CT: So Mario had eighteen people working there? 
 
RM: Yes. 
 
CT: So how large was that salon? 
 
RM: That salon was smaller than this one here. This is 1500 square feet, [the salon in Italy was] 
maybe 1,000 square feet. People were sitting everywhere and in Sicily people don’t take 
appointments either. So sometimes you would have people sitting all along the wall, standing, 
waiting…because Sicilian’s can’t keep an appointment so you just walk in and they are willing to 
wait. I remember one Christmas, we did 100 people in one day and those twelve year olds were 
working like professionals, they were excellent. 
 
CT: So what do you think was different about their training? Just that they had more experience 
and they had been doing it longer? 
 
RM: They just start at a very young age and young kids don’t tire. It’s amazing. We would come in 
and we would have a set of shampoo kids and their hands [would be] cracked and dry [from] 
shampooing all day. My Italian at the time wasn’t very good because I speak Sicilian, not Italian 
and so I was a little embarrassed about that. 
 
CT: Why? 
 
RM: Because it’s like speaking slang and not proper Italian. 
 
CT: So is that a dialect or a different language? 
 
RM: It’s almost like a different language all together. It is a dialect. 
 
 
4 
CT: Could you compare it to the [American] south? Is it like having a strong southern accent or 
even more… 
 
RM: But the words are different. For example, a boy in Italian in “ragazzo” in Sicilian it is “caruso.” 
So it could be completely different if you don’t know the actual “ragazzo” and you say “caruso” 
people look at you like, oh where is she from? [laughing]. Or she hasn’t gone to school. Maybe she 
did the fifth grade kind of thing. And that to me is horrifying so I just kept my mouth shut for a long 
time until I got the phrases down. And knowing Sicilian, you understand Italian fairly quickly. You 
hold it all in and then you can let it all out when you got it. At least that’s how it all worked for 
me. Because I was embarrassed because they would say, “She’s the American.” So if I would make 
a grammatic[al] error, they would say, “She’s American” so that excused me. 
 
CT: So can you tell me a little about…because my knowledge of Italian culture is pretty limited, but 
from what I’ve heard the south is very different from the north? 
 
RM: Not really. If you go as an American I don’t think you’d see the difference at all. 
 
CT: No, I know, but from an Italian’s perspective? 
 
RM: Even as an Italian. You know Italy is really small. It’s very different from here to…let’s say 
Arizona, it’s very different but we’re still all Americans. In Italy, the northern [people] are sort of 
lighter and taller, they consider themselves a lot of times more Austrian, like that’s even 
better…that’s changing now. You know back in the ‘70s, yes, if you were from the north…I 
remember this one woman said she was afraid to go down to Sicily. It’s like are you kidding me? It’s 
like saying you’re afraid to go from Rocky Hill [Connecticut] to Hartford [Connecticut], it’s the 
same thing. You know obviously there’s bad areas, but Sicily, really the towns are so small, I used 
to come home at 11:00 at night on a bus and never think twice to walk up to my house by myself. 
 
CT: So is there is a visual difference? Are people darker with kinkier hair? 
 
RM: There is sort of that stereotypic…yeah, as you go further south [you see] darker and kinkier 
hair and as you go further north there’s more lighter and straighter hair. But look at me, I’m Sicilian 
and I don’t have kinky, heavy hair, I wish I did. 
 
CT: Were you blonde? 
 
RM: No, I’m dark, that’s my natural hair color. I’ve gone blonde now, more recently since I’ve 
gotten more gray, it’s easier to go blonde, you don’t see it so much. 
 
CT: I wanted to find out what you learned from Mario. 
 
RM: Mario was really a true artist, I mean sometimes he would do a haircut and we’d cut the whole 
thing again and check it and check it and check it and every hair had to be perfect. If he had the 
right client in the chair and he had the time he could really get into it and he would take two hours 
to cut one person’s hair and it would be perfect. The way he would brush the hair and how it 
would fall, I mean he acted like he was doing a photo shoot for that one client. Especially if he 
found something about this person that he liked and she was willing to sit there, he would take the 
time. But he was also a great businessman because you can’t do that all day, you’d be closing your 
doors. He had to keep eighteen people busy. So he’s the person I really learned [from]. I don’t 
 
5 
have to stand here and shampoo for fifteen minutes. At the end of the day, fifteen minutes a piece 
for each client, you’re saving like four hours of shampooing. You could pay someone minimum wage 
to do that and in Italy it was not even minimum wage, there was no minimum wage. It was like ok, 
“I’ll give you $20 a week if you shampoo for me.” And if you’re doing nothing and you’re 
learning…the way I calculated [it] I paid $1,000 to go to school and basically barely learn anything 
and now I’m getting paid $20 a week, 20,000 Lira, which isn’t very much in dollars, but I was 
learning and I saw how much there was to learn when I saw everybody blow drying the way I did 
for you in those photographs, that’s what I wanted to learn to do. That’s what I have to learn to 
do. Because you know you kind of do people’s hair and it’s like, “Oh, that’s good hon.” And they 
think you’re sweet because you’re young and [they say] “you’ll learn.” But that’s not what I wanted 
to hear. I wanted to hear, “I love it!” And that’s what it takes, it takes years of really [working 
hard]. I was a little over the top. I worked from 8:30 in the morning at Mario’s I would come home 
on the 8:00 bus and then in the summer I would work until 11:00 doing hair around town. It started 
with…I did a cousin’s hair, a neighbor’s hair and then they said, “Wow, who did that? Can she 
come to my house?” Because it was also convenient, and like in Sicily, nobody wants to sit in the 
salon for hours and that’s what was happening in the salon so if I could go to your house and do 
you hair quickly, it was very appealing to a lot of people. But before you know it, I had the whole 
town coming after me. “Can you do my hair? Can you do my hair?” I was walking down the street 
with my aunt. And this man came up and it was her architect and she said, “When are you going to 
finish my plans? And he goes, “Isn’t this your niece?” And I said, “Yeah.” And he said, “You’re the 
hairdresser? You said no to my wife.” I wasn’t taking any new clients. So he said, “When you take 
my wife, I will do your aunt’s project. So my aunt says, “You better do her hair, otherwise I’ll never 
get my house done [laughing]. So that’s what it came to after four years of being in Italy. I was 
really working a lot, seven days a week, fourteen hours a day. 
 
CT: So you had an incredible passion to do hair. 
 
RM: Yeah, it wasn’t just the hair though, because I’m a people person. And frankly I was a little 
bored in Italy when I didn’t do hair, you know you just kind of sit around in a small town and there 
wasn’t much going on. 
 
CT: What was the town you were in? 
 
RM: Melilli, you know in a small town there’s not much going on. Television to me was ridiculous. I 
didn’t get the jokes, I didn’t get the humor, Italian television is terrible, not that American is any 
better but there wasn’t much to see and I didn’t read well in Italian and I had some books that my 
sister had left and I read all of them so once you finish that, there wasn’t much to keep me amused, 
but doing hair and meeting people around town. I actually got to know a lot of people around 
town and doing hair was sort of an excuse too, to be social and to make some extra money. 20,000 
Lira was not enough really. I lived with my grandparents and they never charged me rent or food 
or anything like that. They took me in completely but I wanted clothes and I wanted that little extra. 
And I was charging very little money, so you know everybody wanted that, because at the salon 
where I worked it was very expensive. So I could do the same work that I did in the salon for one-
tenth the price. 
 
CT: Another reason why you were in high demand. 
 
RM: Yeah. 
 
 
6 
CT: So what brought you back to the US?  
 
RM: My sister Nella. Before then she was managing a restaurant and she was a kid herself. And the 
owner was actually a hairdresser from New York that took over his sister’s little pizzeria, he 
expanded [the business]. The typical sort of American [attitude]…if it’s good small, bigger is better. 
And he bought two other restaurants. And Nella, she was just a high school kid running the 
restaurant and they went bankrupt, because one restaurant was doing well but the other two kind 
of drew from the one restaurant, so they went bankrupt. And she came back to Sicily to get away 
from everybody and she had gone down to ninety-five pounds and she’s very intense. So she came 
to Sicily and she said, “What do you do other than work?” And I said, “That’s about it. I work a 
lot.” And she said, “Well looking at what you’re doing, going door to door to door, you can do 
that in the US and what you make here in a week you can make there in a day.” I said, “Probably. 
But I love it here.” Within a month…she kept talking about the US… remember so and so and 
what’s going on with…well she got me homesick and we were close, so she said, “Why don’t you 
come back?” I said, “Well I can come back [to the US] and I can always go back [to Italy] if I 
don’t get the job I want and if it doesn’t work out.” So she goes, “Yeah, you can always come back 
here.” And I said, “Alright.” And so I came back with her. 
 
CT: Were you in your early twenties then? 
 
RM: I was twenty-two. I went on an interview in this one salon. This guy, he had two salons, one in 
New Haven [Connecticut] and one in Hartford [Connecticut]. He said, “Can you wait a month? 
Someone’s leaving.” And I said, “Yeah, I can wait a month.” So I waited a month and I called him 
and he said, “Well that someone hasn’t left yet. I’ll have you work in New Haven for a couple of 
weeks.” And then he kind of strung me along. He goes, “Well now he hasn’t left yet, why don’t you 
wait a few weeks and being used to working 24-7 and I had a month off with no car yet and just 
waiting to get on my feet, I really need to be busy and so I started looking other places and I 
happened to walk into the civic center and at the time, it had wonderful shops, it’s a convention 
center but had high quality shops and it was a very expensive place. So there was a little salon 
with only three employees and the owner was this Puerto Rican woman, tiny little woman, frizzy 
tight hair. I went in and I said, “I’d like to apply.” And she said, “Well, can you do my hair?” And I 
said, “Absolutely.” She just sat down and said, “Do it.” And I said, “Alright.” And she even let me 
cut it. I cut it, I blew it dry, I curled it. She loved it. She goes, “You’re hired.” She was a wonderful 
woman but she was in love with this guy who she had a baby with. And the baby was two or three 
years old and she was crazy in love. I used to drive a Datsun 210 and she had a silver Porsche and 
we switched cars because she wanted to spy on her boyfriend and she handed me the keys and 
said, “You do it. You’re motivated.” And I’m like, “Yeah.” Because I was working on commission, so 
the more you work, the more you make. So I figured the Civic Center was opened from ten to 
nine. I said, “I’ll work all the hours of the salon, six days a week.” And she’s like, “Great! Do it.” So 
I did. I would work…because again, what am I going to do in Middletown [Connecticut]? I didn’t 
know anybody at that point. Because once you leave for four years, you forget all your friends. So 
I was working there for almost two years. And then she got married to the guy, he was Argentinian, 
he was handsome, blue-eyed…but he was such a jerk. And I said, there’s no way he’s now going to 
be my boss. But he was. She got married and he kind of figured out one day, he sat at the desk 
and saw what [money] was coming in and said, “Oh, let’s get married.” Like literarily. They closed 
the salon for “inventory.” That’s what they said and they got married. And she had a great business 
in the Civic Center. He came in and I said, “I’m out of here. I can’t work for this guy. He’s too 
much of a jerk.” Because you could see, from the outside looking in, it was so obvious. And she 
couldn’t see it. She was that crazy in love with him. And so I opened up my own salon and they 
 
7 
actually fired me when they found out that I was going to open my own place. So I rented a chair 
someplace else. 
 
CT: So had you saved up money to open up your own place? 
 
RM: Oh yeah. In two years, I’d actually made a decent amount of money because I lived at home 
and my parents never charged me as long as I was working and putting money away my mother 
was more than happy to just keep me at home. And Italians are like that. If you’re not getting 
married, why are you leaving, is their attitude [laughing]. So I had saved up money and around the 
corner was a storefront that was right on the street level and it looked about the right size, about 
1500 square feet. We gutted it out, he gave me like three months free rent to do the work and we 
put it together. My sister and I and Joe my brother who started working for me, the three of us, 
they were a big part of that, because I couldn’t have done it by myself. They helped out with 
painting and we did a lot of it ourselves. 
 
CT: So did you take some of your customers from the other place? 
 
RM: I took all my customers. Back then you didn’t have the cell phone for people to call you and 
you could keep their numbers. So I had a little book, which everybody does. Back then everybody 
kept a little book and I knew this older hairdresser that was working in the salon and she did the 
same thing. Everybody had their little book with phone numbers in it. I didn’t start doing that until I 
realized that I gotta go and then all the sudden, you pull out the book. That’s a big clue that 
you’re thinking of leaving and when it was confirmed and they found out that I had looked at a 
place and then they fired me. But you know if people want to find you they will. So by the time my 
place was ready a lot of my clients were waiting for me to open. 
 
CT: So what was the majority of your clientele at that time? 
 
RM: The great thing about the Civic Center, like any mall, you get a lot of people walking through, 
people just browsing because they are shopping and hanging out. They’re not in a hurry and that’s 
the big lesson that I learned. So if you take the time to approach people and convince people to 
get their hair done. They have the time usually because they are hanging out and they’ll come in. 
At that point, I didn’t have a large black clientele. It was more like whoever walked in. And it was 
a very expensive place. I’m talking thirty years ago, a man’s haircut was twenty dollars and thirty 
years later a man’s haircut now, I charge twenty-eight dollars. Back then twenty dollars was 
outrageous for a guy to pay, guys were paying three, five bucks. It was also the time when blow-
drying was all new and guys really wanted to start taking care of their hair. In the eighties, when I 
came back from Italy, honestly I thought the US was so outrageous. A woman tipped me twenty 
dollars and her haircut was twenty dollars. I thought, wow, this is excellent money. And for like a 
curly perm, one guy was charging one hundred dollars. You could charge whatever you wanted, 
basically. This was in the eighties and it was also because of where the salon was located. It was a 
pretty salon, not a big salon, but a pretty salon with high-end kind of products and people thought 
being a part of who walks in there, determines the price. It’s not necessarily that the hair is going 
to be so much better but you know on Fifth Avenue, it’s going to cost a whole lot more than if you 
go a few blocks over and that’s just the way it is. Their rent is high, but it’s not all rent. People will 
walk in at least once and pay that price, at least once but the trick is to get them back and pay 
that price again and again and again. And that’s where I’ve been lucky. Your work shows and then 
people tell other people. I wasn’t relying just on walk-ins after about a year, people were sending 
me their friends, sending me their family.

CT: Tell me about how you got black women to trust that you could do their hair. 
 
RM: Twila {SP???} was one of my first black clients who just happened to walk by and she’s doing 
one of those looking past me things and I said, “Can I help you?” And you know, I’m small and I 
was only twenty-two and she’s like, “I’m looking for color.” And she’s looking past me and I said, “I 
can do your hair.” And she goes, “Well, I don’t think so.” And I said, “No really, I can do your 
hair. I can cut it, I can blow dry it. I’ll just blow dry it and if you don’t like it, you don’t even have 
to pay me.” And she was very upbeat, big, big smile, wonderful. And she said, “Okay, I’ll come back 
tomorrow.” And she did, she came back the next day and she said, “You know what, while you’re 
at it, just go ahead and cut it.” So I cut it, I blew it dry and upstairs was Etna and all those offices 
and she’s up there and she walks in and all her girlfriends went, “What did you do?” Because it was 
a drastic change, we cut it and blew it out and she’s shaking her head and she’s like “Look at this!” 
And she sent me all her friends.  
 
And then after her, another woman who was beautiful, she eventually married a politician and she 
was the woman to go to. She always had the right hair, the right dress and this and that, she went 
to a party, and that’s who really sent me a ton of people, because everybody wanted to be like 
Lynn. She shook her head and her hair moved it was everybody was like “Oh my God. Where did 
you go?” And so she gave people my name and number. And that’s how it all began. You know 
Hartford is still a small town so when the word gets out everybody starts to…people would come 
in and go, “I’m looking for Rina.” And I’d say, “I’m Rina.” And one woman goes, “Oh no! I’m going 
to kill her!” And I said, [laughing] “Don’t worry.” She goes, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. But she didn’t tell 
me you were white.” And I said, “It’s okay. I can still do your hair. Don’t worry.” A lot of them 
were grumbling. And some people are uncomfortable. So you know some people don’t come back. 
Because you know a lot of people want to go to the sort of “sister salon” and I totally get that. 
You’ve got to go where you’re comfortable and not everybody’s comfortable having a white 
woman do their hair or even the environment sometimes. Like I had a couple of girls who have 
worked for me. One of them was very honest, very cute, she said, “Rina, I just don’t like your 
clients. They’re uppity, they’re too formal, they look at every minute, if you run late, they start 
getting antsy, they start shaking their leg.” She’s like, “I don’t like that. I like to talk on my cell 
phone and be more friendly with customers. You spoil your customers too much. You are right on 
time, you’re always kind of on edge trying to get…” And it’s true. I can see that view. Not 
everybody wants to come in get their hair done and get out. You can have your little conversation, 
but when it’s busy, conversation cuts back a lot. And sometimes I’d rather have the client…if they 
want to talk, I really don’t talk that much, I’d rather have them do the talking. Because I also have 
to keep my eye on who’s going in the back, who’s coming out, who’s doing what and if something’s 
not right, I have to catch that. So if you’re into your conversation too much, now you’re lost all 
day. 
 
CT: It’s a balancing act. I’ve read stories where, it was a salon in North Carolina, and they said, 
“Oh we get to talking….” And they dyed somebody’s hair green. They said they “just grabbed the 
wrong bottle.” 
 
RM: No, you cannot do that. You cannot have your clients in the back room while you’re mixing 
colors because you’ve got to concentrate. Some things, you know, it has to be done right. If you 
like that laid back [atmosphere], and have fun…it is work. You saw how much time it took me to 
blow-dry somebody’s hair, if I start talking a lot, I’d be here all day, all night. And you know it is 
still a business and that’s the piece a lot of people don’t understand. Because some clients will 
 
9 
cancel an hour before their appointment, “Oh I’m sorry, something came up. I can’t make it.” [She 
responds], “Umm, I would appreciate a twenty-four hour notice if you’re going to cancel.” And 
some people take such offense to that little…okay so you’re cancelling maybe even five minutes 
before your appointment and I shouldn’t be offended? But you’re offended if I say to you, “I need a 
twenty-four hour notice.” It’s even written in my card. And I’ve had people not come back. 
 
CT: Some places charge you. 
 
RM: I don’t quite do that. I know most of my customers. I don’t need to do that. I mean if somebody 
calls me and says something happened and I’ve done their hair and I know them and they never pull 
that, I totally understand. I don’t even have to say I need twenty-four hour notice, but if it’s a fairly 
new client and she’s already done this once or twice and then the third time or I’ll just pass them to 
someone else who has a more flexible schedule than me, because if you look at my book, I am 
booked completely from the moment I walk in to the moment I leave. I don’t even take a lunch. 
 
CT: How many days a week do you work now? 
 
RM: Five. 
 
CT: And what are your hours? 
 
RM: Generally I’m here by 9:30 in the morning and I leave about 6:30 Wednesday and Thursday 
about 9:00. And I do not sit down, not five minutes. 
 
CT: This work is not for everyone, right? 
 
RM: No, no, no. 
 
CT: What do you think it really takes to be a stellar hairdresser, not just a basic stylist? 
 
RM: First I think it takes a good ten years to really get into any profession. You don’t just walk into 
a profession, a real profession. You know we went to a restaurant the other night and it was my 
husband’s birthday and my niece’s boyfriend’s birthday, so we decided to go out and the waitress 
was like this ditzy…just like come on! And at first it was kind of cute and kind of funny, “Oh who 
had the…crab cake?” It’s like, you wrote it down did you make some kind of note who it belongs 
to? And she did this all night. And my son’s dinner was horrible and then my husband only had a 
salad and they messed it up…they hardly put any dressing in his salad and my husband’s really not 
one that complains at all. So he’s like, “I need more dressing.” And the dressing was sort of clear 
and now she brings him this brown dressing. And he says, “This is brown.” And now the chef comes 
out… “What’s wrong?” Instead of saying, “I’m sorry, let me just redo this.” He says, “Well I know I 
put in…” He’s almost like confirming, this is what I did. It’s a salad! And I’m paying what for this 
salad and you’re arguing with me? And at that point my husband said, “Forget it.” If you’re going to 
be a professional, yes, you’ve got to take that seriously. I mean twenty-five bucks for a salad? 
Come on, it’s gotta be great.  
 
And same with your hair, you can’t get out of the salon looking like your sister did it. You know 
your sister can set your hair, your mother can flat iron it, but if you’re going to spend money, it’s 
got to be better than what your aunt can do or what your sister can do. That’s just who I am too. 
It has to be done better. 
 
10 
 
CT: Can you talk about handling different textured hair and can you give advice to people who 
are not familiar with a kinkier textured hair? 
 
RM: First of all I think you need to look at hair like a fabric and not seeing…you know sometimes 
people see this person who is very different from them and they are not just looking at the hair, 
they’re looking at the whole package, which is important to do, but at one point, you’re there not 
to fix the client with the conversation and their problems and all that. Sometimes you take on too 
much all at once, when that first customer walks in, they come in for their hair, first and foremost. 
Then if you happen to like them and you happen to have a nice conversation, that’s just all a plus, 
but they’re there to get their hair done. So someone who [has hair so thick] you can’t even get a 
comb through it, if you need to relax it, it’s okay. You just can’t depend only on the relaxer to do 
your work, you need to change the texture of the hair a little bit, it’s okay to perm hair, you just 
can’t over-process it and you can’t get greedy and expect to get that processing money every 
couple of weeks. At one point, I tell my clients when you first have a relaxer that’s when you 
should do it, because it’s easy, you can set your own hair when you have a fresh relaxer, you need 
to come to me like one or two weeks before you need a relaxer because that’s when it’s hard to 
do, that’s when I can get in there and do [it]. You can’t do what I do because I’m right over your 
head with two hands, able to manipulate, that’s when you need a hairdresser. Somebody that is 
beautiful with beautiful hair, doesn’t need a hairdresser. They can do it themselves. They can just 
wash it, throw a couple of rollers in, that’s not the client that’s going to come back and keep you in 
business. You need that woman that towards the end of her relaxer or towards the end of her 
color, or curly perm or people who are chemically-dependent, they are your best clients. But then 
there are also people, when you do it right they’re your most appreciative clients. Because they 
won’t say, “Oh Rina’s busy, I’ll just go across the street.” No they’re going to wait for you because 
if you mix their color a certain way and they love it, that’s a client for life. Because they’re not 
going to go to their sister and say, “My hairdresser’s busy, mix this color for me.” They’re not going 
to do that and that’s the client you want and that’s the client that wants you. They value what you 
do. A lot of people don’t value hairdressers, they think you’re a high school drop out… 
 
CT: Why do you think that is? Where do you think that comes from? 
 
RM: Partially it’s true. I hate to say it. A lot of hairdressers are dropouts, like me. It seems like a 
profession you can get into that doesn’t require a whole hell of a lot. You go to school for…now 
it’s not even 2,000 hours, I went for 2,000 hours and now they’ve cut it back to 1,500 hours, that can 
be done easily in one year and you can call yourself a professional. You can work at a place 
where there’s a lot of walk-ins, you mess up a haircut, it doesn’t matter, somebody else is going to 
walk in. The money is not bad, in the beginning, if you want to be good, it’s terrible, but you’re still 
learning and the money can become really good, if you get good. You can get a decent pay within 
a year of school in a mall and that’s because a lot of people aren’t professional. A lot of salons, 
you’ll walk in and their hair is a mess. I hate to say it, but it’s true. A lot of stereotypical…it’s like 
over-processed hair, nails that are way too long, they can’t even shampoo, I don’t know how they 
even allow that and you know it’s the stereotypic…I’m like come on. I had one woman that was 
here, I was doing her hair and one of the girls that works for me came in [wearing] spandex. The 
girl was way overweight and she’s wearing a spandex dress and now I didn’t have the heart to say, 
“You shouldn’t wear that to work.” But my customer did. She said, “Rina, if you don’t tell 
her….that’s not professional. She goes, “I don’t want to look at that.” So I told her that so and so 
said, “Please don’t wear that.” And she just looked at me like you just want to be a bitch right now. 
And I said, “You think I’m just doing this? I don’t want to be mean to you.” And she kind of just 
 
11 
rolled her eyes. At the time, another girl that was working here, I said, “Can you please tell her 
and talk to her. That it’s not me it’s actually the client. It’s just not professional.” And so she had to 
talk to her. But it’s like didn’t you look in the mirror this morning? You’re in the fashion industry. You 
have to look a certain way. Not that you have to look like a model everyday, but hygiene and 
your hair’s done and you have to at least put out your best each and every day, but a lot of 
hairdresser’s don’t. And a lot of us don’t have time to do each other’s hair because we’re working 
on clients all the time but that’s where you have to take the time. 
 
CT: Partially this has to do with culture and class right? Within certain cultures that is their best or 
what is being revered as attractive. 
 
RM: But if you come into a salon as a hairdresser, looking like you need your hair washed are you 
going to trust that woman to wash your hair? You know what I mean? At one point you have to 
look outside and say okay, what do I want to be? You know there’s a place for those salons and 
hairdressers they’re just not going to make the money they make on Fifth Avenue. Never. That’s the 
difference, where do you want to be? And you can find your niche, like this young lady actually 
came here and she was doing quite well and she said I want my own salon and I want it like a 
sister salon. I want it more relaxed, I want it just so I don’t have to worry so much. So there is a 
niche and for me, that’s not my style. 
 
CT: I understand that. Can you tell me, in your experience, approximately what percentage of 
people want hair that they don’t have? 
 
RM: I think that’s almost like eighty percent. 
 
CT: No matter what they have?  
 
RM: No matter what they have, because you get bored. You know, you’ll love your hair after 
you’re done but you’re not going to wear that for the rest of your life. Just like you change your 
clothes. You know, you look great in red, so you’re going to walk around in red all the time? No, 
you’re going to walk around in the “in” color. If purple is in, you’re going to wear purple whether 
it looks good on you or not and guess what, because it’s “in” it looks good on everybody. And 
that’s the funny thing about fashion. If the color is new and in, everybody loves it. 
 
CT: I don’t know. I know what I like. I won’t just go with what’s trendy. 
 
RM: But you do without realizing it. 
 
CT: Well there are some trendy things that I do like but then there are others that… 
 
RM: Yeah, you have to mix it up a little bit. Because what happens is if you wear a dress you 
bought ten years ago that you loved, chances are, you don’t love it anymore. 
 
CT: That’s not true for me. 
 
RM: You do love it still? 
 
CT: Yeah, there are some things that may seem dated that I will get rid of but there are other 
things that I know look better on me and that’s when I feel my best. 
 
12 
 
RM: Maybe you should look at old pictures. Remember when the maxi dresses were in, you know 
the bell-bottoms. When they’re gone, you look back and think, Oh my God, I walked in those? You 
know those big heels that looked like stilts. In a few years, not even a few years, I bet you within a 
year or two, when those go out and no one else is wearing them, they will look ridiculous if you 
pull them out. 
 
CT: But then they come back [chuckle]. 
 
RM: And then they’ll be okay again. But when they’re out, they’re out, and so if you’re still insisting 
on wearing that style. You know people know, unless it’s the classics. Like the bob, you can’t go 
wrong with the bob. Sometimes it’s a little flatter, sometimes it’s curlier, fuller...but it’s still a bob. 
There’s the classics, and then there’s the trends, and trendy is fun.  
 
CT: Can you talk about the trends with the Keratin hair treatment and the difference between the 
Dominican blowout treatment and the Keratin treatment that you do? 
 
RM: The Keratin treatments, okay so there are the relaxers that chemically straighten your hair and 
no matter how much you wash your hair, your hair is straight. Basically the elasticity is pulled out of 
your hair and it straightens and straightens and straightens until there is no more elasticity left. And 
that’s when it’s over-processed. You want the hair like an elastic band, to bounce back a little bit, 
not completely but bounce back a little bit. Now relaxers are great when it just took some of the 
elasticity out. If it’s done well, it’s great. But it grows out and now let’s say you have an inch of 
really kinky hair and then this soft, straight hair on the end so most people feel oh, I have to keep 
up with the roots to make it all smooth. And then there’s this trend that people want to grow out 
their relaxer but then they can’t even comb it.  
 
The Keratin treatments come in various strengths, it comes in a cream where you just put it in and 
you blow it into the hair. Now the difference is you don’t chemically change the hair texture. It just 
coats it and it’s just a cream that’s basically like a setting lotion that just sits in the hair so that 
when the humidity hits it, it repels a little bit so that the hair doesn’t get all frizzy. Then there’s the 
one that’s good for about a month or four washes, that you spray into the hair, you dry it in and it 
creates like a little bond over the hair so again, when the humidity hits it repels it a little bit.  
 
Then there’s the Brazilian blowout. The Brazilian blowout is basically one brand. They’ve come out 
with different brands since then, but the higher the formaldehyde the better it is. It really works. It 
creates this really hard bond in your hair. So what you have to do is you wash the hair like seven 
times you strip it completely of any oil or moisture and the hair is dry as a bone and then you dry 
the hair so now your hair is dry and dried and you wet it completely with the formaldehyde-based 
keratin. Now when you wet it all down then you dry the keratin right into the hair, which creates a 
bond. And once it’s dried into the hair then you have to press it with a flat iron at least 450 
degrees. And you have to do that between five and seven times and iron the hair, over and over. 
Once the iron hits the formaldehyde, it turns into a gas and that’s what’s bad to inhale. If you’re a 
salon that does this day in and day out, all day, it’s really bad for you to be inhaling all of that. 
We don’t do them that often, just one a month maybe, sometimes not even that and sometimes a 
couple a month because they’re expensive, but done on the right hair, it’s beautiful. 
 
CT: So were Brazilian blowouts made for Latin hair? 
 
 
13 
RM: Right, on that hair. 
 
CT: So how do you feel about it being done on African American hair? 
 
RM: It depends. If you have really kinky hair, it’s really not worth it because you can’t touch it up 
every two months because it’s too outrageously expensive. It’s for people who have that real heavy 
wave and not a real tight curl and who want to wear it straight all the time and then it’s good. It 
holds your blow dry, it’s for people who know how to blow-dry their hair. And once they’ve got it 
nice and straight, it will hold it for them because there’s this coating in their hair, that when you go 
to brush it, it’s easier to brush and then it re-activates when you flat iron it. It really holds your hair 
and the shine is incredible. It’s like putting this product of shine right over your hair. It’s in your hair. 
It’s not rinsed out, it’s not changing like a chemical relaxer does. The chemical relaxer dries out 
your hair, it changes the hair-texture and now you have to neutralize it and then you have to 
condition it, because a lot of the natural shine and texture has been taken out of it. Just like color, 
any chemical, that’s why this is not a chemical relaxer, and that’s why there’s a twist on the words 
as well, because it sits on your hair, it doesn’t strip your hair. 
 
CT: My mother has been getting a Brazilian Blowout. 
 
CB: About every three or four months. 
 
CT: But then you thought it was straightening your hair too much? 
 
CB: Yes. 
 
RM: It will over time. 
 
CB: But then [my hairdresser] would roll it on rollers and when I first got it, it was really nice. 
 
RM: And now she’s over-doing it. 
 
CB: But now I’ve noticed it’s not holding the curl as much.  
 
CT: Why do you say she’s over-doing it? 
 
RM: So the first time, you had no chemicals in your hair right? 
 
CB: No I had a perm. 
 
RM: Oh, and it was holding better?  
 
CB: Hmm mmm. 
 
RM: Then maybe that’s it. Because it was the old relaxer in your hair helping… 
 
CB: But I don’t frizz at all anymore. And that’s what I wanted because before with a little bit of 
humidity my hair would be out here [gesturing], all curl gone, everything. But now… 
 
 
14 
RM: Yes, it is wonderful. It is a great idea. Even when I first heard, “not permanent relaxer” I was 
also of the mindset how could it not be permanent, because once you straighten hair, that elasticity 
is gone and there’s no way to get it back. It won’t spring back. Once you stretch it out too much, 
it’s done. Where this is not, this is like putting something over that elastic, but it holds it when you 
hold it out and it keeps it there but then when you wash it, it springs right back. But it’s really hard 
because it’s not good for you. If you’re doing it too much you’re inhaling it. It’s more dangerous 
really for hairdressers, because you’re here all day and you’re doing it and you’re standing right 
over people even though we wear a mask and we offer the client a mask also but once that client 
leaves we’re still in the salon with it lingering in the air and you’re inhaling it. So if you’re doing 
too many…and then some salons, like in the Civic Center, we had no windows, so that air was 
circulating. 
 
CB: My hairstylist opens the windows. 
 
RM: Right, you open the window. Right. It’s excellent. Yes. And it’s an excellent new service that we 
can do. It’s expensive so it’s worthwhile.. [phone rings].   
 
CT: I was curious about what you said about Oprah. Could you repeat that for the recording? 
 
RM: I was working in the back room and one of my clients walked in and said Rina, “I just saw 
Oprah this afternoon and Oprah said something like, ‘My experience is that white women cannot 
do a black woman’s hair.’ They went to a commercial break and I guess she got so many phone 
calls for making that remark, she came back on the air and she said, ‘It’s only my experience and it’s 
always been true that white women just can’t do black women’s hair — at least my hair.’” I told this 
client you know “Why didn’t you call in and say ‘My hairdresser’s white’ and you love the way I do 
your hair and ‘You should also send your girlfriend Gail.’” Because Gail was living in Glastonbury 
at the time, right here in Connecticut. And her hair always looked like a mess. And this was way 
before…it had to be at least twenty years ago when she was just an anchor on the 11:00 news. 
And she did, she looked terrible. I said, “You should have just said that.” And she said, “You’re right 
I should have said that.” Because Oprah just made this broad statement and it is unusual [for a 
white woman to be able to do a black woman’s hair]. I agree with Oprah, usually she’s right. 
 
CT: Yeah, but I wonder if you know how unusual you are? 
 
RM: I guess so. I’m more surprised that is true, to be honest. 
 
CT: I [being black] went into a high-end salon in San Francisco and a white hair stylist ruined my 
hair and I had to cut it all off. That experience traumatized me.  
 
RM: Sure, and it’s better that a person says, “I just don’t know how to do your hair,” than say, “Oh 
sure,” and totally mess up. And I hear this a lot. And I do get that look of, are you sure? Because 
hair takes a long time to grow back, especially if you have long hair. It takes years. 
 
CT: It took me ten years to grow my hair back. 
 
RM: That’s a lot. And a lot people think what am I going to do if you mess it up? Sue you? Really? 
It’s a huge deal. Of course I say to my clients, “It’s only hair.” [Laughing] But I understand. I totally 
understand. If your hair’s not right, you don’t feel right. You feel like you want to hide. A lot of 
people, if their hair feels good and looks good you just feel better about yourself. 
 
15 
 
CT:  You really do, yeah. You also said [on the pre-questionnaire form] “In hairdressing school at 
the time 100 students a year graduated.” But you said, “Thirty years later not even one percent are 
still doing hair.” Can you expand on that a little bit? 
 
RM: I think that’s because the initial…is so hard. I was lucky that I started so young and I had plenty 
of time. I was living at home and I had plenty of time to build and build and build. Now we are 
going to age where everybody goes to college, but the truth is if you’re going to become a 
hairdresser, if you’re going to become a plumber, if you’re going to become…something to do with 
your hands, even an artist, you can’t just expect…and say “Ok, I went to school and now I’m a 
professional.” It takes years. It takes ten years. So kids that are prolonging getting older…you 
know everybody’s prolonging their career, their marriage, having kids. We want to sort of be kids 
for as long as possible. But the truth is if you don’t hurry up, like a gymnast, if you’re not there by 
fifteen, it’s over. You have to start some professions at like two or three years old. I think it’s one 
of those things that people start a lot of times after a couple of years of college, they figure, 
maybe I’ll try hairdressing. And then you’re too old because now you’re going to be poor, for a 
good five years. And it takes at least five years to make a really decent paycheck, where you can 
pay for your rent, pay for your car, pay for your dinners out. It doesn’t all come really fast or big. 
It comes slowly. You’ll be in a salon sometimes sitting there all day without one single client. I had 
a hairdresser [work for me] when I first opened up, she had gone to college, she was an 
anthropologist. She worked for me for just a couple of years. She had rented a chair somewhere 
else and she came on board and she ended up working for Etna, the insurance company, because 
she had her four-year degree. She said, “I start with benefits, and paid vacations, paid sick time. 
You don’t offer that.” And she’s right, I don’t. I still don’t. I can’t afford to. It’s a small business. She 
says, “One week I feel like I’m rich. I got a perm, I got colors and I did highlights. I did all this work 
and I feel like wow, I made some great money. And then the following week, I made nothing. And 
she just couldn’t handle it. And that’s why ninety percent just say, “Forget it. This is too much.” 
Because if you’re not passionate about it and aren’t willing to stick it out, then yeah, it’s 
discouraging, for a lot of kids. And especially if you start as an adult? Forget it. People don’t want 
to hear that.  
 
The other piece to that is… let’s say out of 100 hairdressers in school, ninety-percent were women, 
ten-percent were men. Salon owners? Ninety-percent are men and ten percent are women. Women 
drop out, because of having kids…but most salon owners are men. And it’s a big profession for 
Italians for some reason in this area, this street, Silas Deane highway, must have at least 100 salons 
in this strip alone and my UPS man said, “You’re all Sicilian.” I’m not really sure why that is. 
 
CT: Is there just a large Italian population here? 
 
RM: There used to a large Italian population. I don’t know if it’s like the people thing, or if it’s 
more social and welcoming…Italians tend to look at everybody like family it’s like “Come in. Come 
sit, come eat...” And I think that’s part of what you need to be to be a hairdresser. So you know if 
you only eat Chinese, you have to be able to eat a little bit of everything and try a little bit of 
everything and that makes it more interesting. So I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing too but it seems 
to be that way that a good ninety-percent of us who are Italians, own salons. 
 
CT: I’ll have to look at the demographics and the statistics. 
 
 
16 
RM: And also I think most Italians don’t get kicked out of the house at a certain age. Italians want 
to hold their kids home until they absolutely have to leave. Most Italians will let their kids stay 
home, I left home at twenty-six in the end, when I opened up my own salon, I was still living at 
home and my mother never charged me rent. She was mad at me for leaving, because I wasn’t 
married… 
 
CT: At what age did you get married? 
 
RM: I got married at thirty-four because I was so into my business and not really into putting time 
into relationships. And I was way too mature for most guys my age. So when they heard I had a 
house and a business they were like, forget it, she’s too serious. But my parents supported me until I 
was twenty-six and I have young women that work for me and I feel bad for them, their parents are 
like, “You gotta pay rent.” And everybody’s like, “You’re home still?” And everybody looks at them 
like what’s wrong with you? Why pay two sets of bills? When you’re home you can still have your 
room and have your freedom. But financially it’s important to be able to…when you step out, you 
gotta step out swimming, not swim or sink kind of thing. It’s nice when you know I can swim and 
swim well. And your parents will hold you until you’re ready. Obviously you gotta be doing 
[something]… I was working. I wasn’t just bumming around mooching off my parents. And when I 
left, I left knowing exactly where I wanted to be. I think that’s part of Italian culture. 
 
CT: Do you see that as much in Italian-American culture? 
 
RM: Yeah. 
 
CT: Even now. 
 
RM: Yeah, I guess, because I’m that way with my kids. I was born in Italy and my parents were 
extreme. They never really assimilated because they never really wanted to be here. So they didn’t 
try to be American. They hung on to some of their values and a lot of their culture so they were 
more Italian than some of the Italians in Italy. Because they stayed behind where[as] the Italians 
progressed in Italy, my parents just stood right there in the ‘60s [laughing]. Yeah they didn’t budge. 
They liked things a certain way. 
 
CT: Can you talk about the physical labor that’s required of this job? Do you find it physically 
difficult? 
 
RM: It’s hard. Yes. I think because of my stature, I can stand a lot longer hours. But I tell you, if you 
see the bottom of my right foot especially. I have terrible calluses that really hurt at the end of the 
day. Luckily for me, I don’t suffer from carpel tunnel. A lot of people will get carpal tunnel 
especially with all the blow-drying we do. I feel pretty lucky that way. Physically, I’m pretty strong. 
But, yeah at the end of the day, my back hurts for sure, especially now that I’m a bit older. 
 
CT: Your lower back or your upper back? 
 
RM: My lower back will hurt. And a lot of times I’m too busy sometimes to throw on gloves and 
with all the chemicals on my hands, in winter especially, they get really dry. And that’s also again, 
because I don’t take the time. You can take an hour lunch as a hairdresser, you can actually take 
three hours if you want, you know what I mean? That’s just me I think, that I work so much. But 
hairdressers, generally will go in at 10:00, will take an hour lunch, step out of the salon and then 
 
17 
come back and work a few hours. That’s what’s wonderful about hairdressing you can make it as 
much or as little as you want. I know weekend hairdressers that only work Friday and Saturday, 
make their money for the week. If they have clients that are only willing to see them those days, 
you can really carve out what you want. Honestly, if I said, I only want to work three days a week 
a lot of my clients would drop out obviously but a lot of them would be fine with that. They would 
be willing to just wait for those three days that I’m working. And that’s hopefully what I eventually, 
would love to do is to cut back like that. Because I’ve been keeping this up now, my God, thirty 
years, working full-time and time and a half.  
 
But with hairdressing once you’ve got the basics down, you don’t even really have to be great. I’m 
a good hairdresser, but I don’t think I’m a great hairdresser. You know some people are like my 
boss in Italy, [he] was a great hairdresser. He was a true artist. You could see him totally get lost 
in his work. It’s like the painter that paints. What makes Picasso, Picasso? There are those kinds of 
hairdressers that are truly artists. I’m more…I can do the Picasso, but somebody has to show me 
and I’ll make it pretty close but I won’t be able to come up with it out of nowhere and create 
something completely new. I don’t think I have quite that much talent, where he did. And there’s like 
you know Sassoon, Trevor Sorbie, true artists that really get into it. And also, I think being a man, 
they’re not going home to clean, they’re not going home to take care of the kids, they get into 
more of the hair shows. You can do it in a different level that participate long-term. The big names, 
the people who open up a whole product line, they’re usually men because they take it to another 
level. They start with a small salon maybe but they can’t stand shampooing and washing the floor, 
see I still do those little things. I still wipe down my own station and buy my own flowers. A lot of 
those guys will hand it to a manager, run the salon, get their reputation started and then they’re 
off, doing more of the business end, competing and getting their name out. You can take it to that 
level.  
 
A lot of the products we use, you can go to hair shows around the world. I go once a year to a 
different country because I love to travel and the hair shows are a good excuse to travel, so I’ll go 
overseas and check out what’s new but then you can also be the hairdresser that not only checks it 
out but also promotes and they pay you to promote their product, like you come up with a 
hairstyle but then, the photo shoots, working with models, doing all of that, I think is more appealing 
to men long-term. I loved it when I was younger and I did all that but now at fifty-two [years old], 
my boss still does that, my old boss, he’s like seventy [years old] and he still does that. He’s that 
passionate.  
 
CT: Mario? 
 
RM: Yes. I have a few pictures of Mario and I on stage. I’ll show you. And you know I only worked 
for him, not even a full four years, but I did refer back to him a lot, the way he handled things, the 
way he expanded. When he moved his salon, how he did it, I remember things that I did [that 
were] similar and I think I’ve sort of been a mentor for other people too when they leave my salon, 
they take away also how you handle clients when they bounce a check, how you handle clients 
when they don’t show up for an appointment, how you handle when someone does something nice 
for you as well. And I remember Mario holding that line very clear as the business person, as 
opposed to “I’m your friend and I’m not going to charge you today because we had such a great 
conversation.” And then you still have to pay rent. You have to really be thinking of all of it, you 
know. 
 
CT: What’s the most old-fashioned hair technique that you do? 
 
18 
 
RM: Hair set. 
 
CT: And what’s the newest? 
 
RM: The newest, I would say the Brazilian Blowout. That’s huge right now. 
 
CT: How do you feel about regulation within the business because you know over ninety-percent of 
all hair salons are privately-owned. 
 
RM: That’s changing now, in a way. This salon is typical — I’m the owner, I have my employees. 
The employees get to a point where they think they’re good enough and they are. They’ve built a 
clientele and now they’re in a position where they’re kind of bored, they don’t want to necessarily 
have their own salon and employees and the responsibility but they want more than just being your 
employee and so now there’s the salons which I was actually thinking of at one point, maybe going 
into that direction too and so now they rent chairs. It’s like the difference between owning a house 
and owning a condo. Somebody else does the cleaning, somebody else does the lawn somebody 
else does all the other maintenance. You come in and you have your chair and you are your own 
boss, you do whatever you want you don’t have to go by the rules of the salon, the hours of the 
salon, you just go in and you do your thing. And somebody next to you can do something 
completely different. And there are pros and cons about both things, like having your own house, 
it’s more work, it’s more responsibility but it’s your pride and joy and if things don’t go right, it hurts 
you more. You take more on by owning your own house, by owning your salon and what your 
employees do is a reflection on you, like a family. When you have your own condo, there are 
restrictions. I want to open on midnight on Sunday. Well if you’re the only one with a chair, I don’t 
think that owner is going to let you turn on all the lights and turn up the heat and air, just for you, 
so there are restrictions. Where here, if I want to come in on a Monday, when we’re closed and 
turn on all the lights and do whatever, it’s my salon. I can do that. But a lot of people want the 
condo now, more than the house, because it’s too much work. What I do is a lot of work and a lot 
of people don’t want that. Again with hair that’s heavy, why would I take an hour on a little girl 
with a ton of hair? Because I like it. Because I’d rather be busy than wait for that one client that 
maybe will get the highlights that will cost more. That’s great if you can get it everyday, but I can’t 
get it everyday. We went through a huge recession. 
 
CT: How has that affected your business? 
 
RM: It has not. Not really. What I have seen though is that I don’t hire as many people. You have 
to work and be enthusiastic, at least in the beginning. And maybe it’s my getting older and getting a 
little more cynical, but nobody wants to work [laughing]. Everybody wants to party and you can’t, if 
you’re a hairdresser, forget Friday night. It doesn’t exist, because Saturday morning you have to be 
here at 8:00 and you have to be on from the moment you walk in and if you’ve been partying 
Friday night, it’s just not going to do it for your client. Your client could be half asleep, but you 
have to be awake. And a lot of people don’t want that. They want to be out both Friday and 
Saturday night. And to be honest, by Saturday night, I pass out. And I kind of always have. Partying 
is not really a part of who I am because I’ve got to get up in the morning and I’ve got to go. 
 
CT: Did you have children? 
 
 
19 
RM: I have two boys, sixteen and fourteen and they take a lot of out me. You know today, even to 
do this interview, I left them home and I’m always trying to spend as much time with them as 
possible because now being teenagers, they’re gone. They don’t necessarily care whether I’m there 
are not but I do. It’s quick, they’re out of your life so fast. 
 
CT: What’s the most unusual salon you’ve ever heard of or ever seen? 
 
RM: There was a salon in New York City, that I thought was really cool and I can’t remember the 
name. It’s still there, it’s in the Village and there’s like ten pictures up on a wall and there’s a line 
out the door and I don’t how many hairdressers. So you stand in line and you point to the picture 
you want, the cut, you sit down and in fifteen minutes they have to do it. If you don’t like it you can 
stand back in the line again and get it done again. But that place, because it’s near the Village and 
NYU and the kids line up. And most of them were punky, short, buzzed. It’s like a quick fifteen 
minutes, no blow-drying, no anything extra, it’s just a quick haircut. And for college kids who just 
want a trim across their back, or guys that want buzzed, fifteen minutes. Boom, boom. 
 
In London I saw back in the ‘80s, with all the punk rocker, blow-dry, up with the Mohawk and all 
different colors, that’s fun. But again the trends change and you can’t rely on that clientele or that 
sort of look. That’s why I’m still in business, because I do a lot of the classics that people want still 
thirty years later. The trendy things are fun for a little while anyway. 
 
CT: We went to a salon in Queens, New York called Bollywood, it was a Pakistani hairdresser and 
they do the eyebrow threading which has become very popular, it was the first time I’d ever seen 
it, it was fascinating. 
 
RM: Oh yeah, it is. 
 
CT: And then we went to a mall yesterday in Hartford [Connecticut] no maybe it was Hadley, a 
small town and went inside the mall and there was a store with Indian women doing eyebrow 
threading. 
 
RM: Oh yeah, you see them here in the mall too. That’s gotten really big. And things trend, you 
know what’s gotten big is weaving [hair weaves], and not just black women. 
 
CT: Do you do that here? 
 
RM: I have a young lady that does it. Yeah, that’s instant hair. It’s great. And it really looks good. If 
you really know how to do it well, it’s great, you have instant long hair, and thick, it’s fabulous. The 
lashes, adding lashes, not just the old-fashioned peel them on, peel them off, now they’re kind of on 
for a while and they’ll last several weeks. Tattooing make-up… You should go to a hair show, it’s 
crazy. 
 
CT: Which one do you recommend? 
 
RM: There’s one in Chicago in March, there’s another one in New York at the Javitz Center, that’s 
the one I go to and that’s now in April, it always used to be in March and now it’s in April because 
Chicago has gotten much bigger. 
 
CT: Chicago is a bigger show? 
 
20 
 
RM: It’s about the same but it’s gotten more attention because a lot of people are just tired of 
going to New York for the last fifty years. It’s always been in New York City, always in March. It’s 
like a big trade show with a lot of different stages and people just screaming over the microphone, 
but they’re doing hair, they’re showing products, they’re competing, and that’s where you see a lot 
of the new hairdressers that are punked out and rocked out and overly done. It’s fun. As you drive 
in you see the hairdressers come because they stick out a mile, you know, they’re just like way over 
the top. 
 
CT: One last question, did you see the documentary Good Hair? 
 
RM: I didn’t see the whole thing. I heard about it and it’s like I live it everyday [laughing] so I 
thought I can skip that one. I’ve seen bits and pieces of it. I live it everyday. I do a lot of 
mixed…Caucasian mother, black father. So a lot of these kids they don’t know where they should 
be taken, to a white a salon, to a black salon, so that’s where this salon is really nice.  
 
I’ll give you one little story. My customer adopted a little black girl and she was only a baby, 
maybe not even a year old and as this little girl got older, the mother didn’t know what to do so 
she asked one of her babysitters, who was one of my clients, who was also bi-racial. She said, 
“Where do you go, because I can’t do Maggie’s hair.” She told her here. Maggie, when she was a 
baby, she was like this wild little thing. So just cut her hair and don’t even worry about it, just keep 
it short, let her be a tomboy, she was such a little tomboy. One of my customers was sitting and I 
was doing her hair and she looked at me and goes, “Why does that woman cut that baby’s hair?” I 
said, “Because she doesn’t know what else to do with it.” Then she goes, “Oh [disgusted tone], then 
you shouldn’t adopt a black baby if you don’t know how to do their hair.” I said, “That’s a little 
harsh.” Through the years Maggie would come in. When Maggie turned about six and started going 
to school she wanted long hair so her Mom said, “I think Maggie’s ready to grow her hair. She’s 
looking in the mirror now and wants long hair.” I said, “No problem, we’ll grow it.” And then I 
don’t know, years later, Maggie now has hair down her back all straight, shiny and beautiful. One 
of my customers, she had left, she moved away for a couple of years and then came back and she 
quickly turned around and goes, “Is that the little girl that you used to cut all her hair off?” And I 
said, “Yeah, you think we know what we’re doing? [Laughing].  
 
CT: So is her hair processed? 
 
RM: Yes, we do a very gentle relaxer and we blow it dry. She actually has more of a texturized 
relaxer. In the summer now she’ll just put gel and conditioner in her hair and just let it go a little 
wild and curly and then come fall when she goes back to school, her Mom brings her in still about 
once a week, once every other week to have it washed and blown-dry. 
 
CT: Is there any danger to using chemicals on kids or even on adults, with the relaxer? 
 
RM: First of all I think that if you slop on a ton of relaxer on the scalp, it’s like sticking your hands 
in a tub of relaxer. Your scalp is skin and you let it sit forever, you can’t do that. Now you 
wouldn’t stick your hand in a jar of relaxer and sit there for twenty-minutes, so you don’t do that 
on the scalp and some people really want it straight at the scalp and they put way too much 
product. Now if you’re sensitive, some people don’t feel it, but some people are very sensitive so 
then it starts burning and then you get scabs. So yeah, it’s not so much the children but older 
people too, if you’re sensitive you have to base the scalp with Vaseline or some protective lotion 
 
21 
on your scalp and then as you apply the relaxer, first you have to apply it quickly and thoroughly. 
If you’re someone who works really slow, by the time you get to the front, that back is burning, 
your neck is on fire, so you have to again, cut down on the conversation and quickly move along 
with that relaxer, so I start back here at the nape, work my way up by the time you get to the 
front, this back is ready because it’s taken me fifteen minutes at least to apply that relaxer so I start 
rinsing off the nape area and some people will say, “Oh no I have to stay longer, I want that 
straight.” But I say, “You have, you’ve sat here fifteen minutes by the time I’ve got to the front.” 
Now there’s the people that totally get that, and then there’s people that say, “Oh no, my 
hairdresser has me sit at least fifteen minutes and then she rinses out the whole thing.” And so isn’t 
the back straighter now than the front? So you try, you have to educate people and have them 
understand, why it’s done a certain way, you can’t say, “Trust me.” [They say], “No, no, I don’t trust 
you.” [laughing] “I’ve had bad experiences. Why would I trust you?” It’s like a doctor saying, “Sit 
down I’m going to do this surgery.” No, I want a little more information than that. And for women, 
hair is like surgery, it better be done right. [laughing] 
 
For children, if they have fine hair, in and out, by the time I finished putting it on, I’m already rinsing 
it out. And then you also have to look at some people…women will bald in the same patterns as 
men. So a lot of women, right in the center here [gesturing] they start thinning out, so you can’t put 
that relaxer here sometimes at all, you skip that area and keep it nice and full or sometimes in the 
temple area it starts getting thin so you stay away from there. Same with color, you know high-lift 
color and depending on the chemical, you have to calculate for that, you don’t just put it on all 
over. Like I said, Jessica, that I was blow-drying, she had like three different textures in her hair. 
Her hair is a lot straighter in the nape area, so you have to calculate, that’s going to be really 
quick and the center will take a lot longer. 
 
CT: With my hair, most of my length is from the top of my head. 
 
RM: So you probably shouldn’t even perm the back of your hair.  
 
CT: My hairdresser starts up here [at the forehead], so by the time he gets back here [at the nape] 
it’s only on five minutes before he washes it out. 
 
RM: Yeah, and if it’s fragile, it’s not going to grow so thick and heavy 
 
CT: Ok, well I’ve taken so much of your day. Is there anything I didn’t cover that you can think of? 
 
RM: No, I don’t think so.  
 
CT: Well thank you so much 
 
RM: Absolutely.
