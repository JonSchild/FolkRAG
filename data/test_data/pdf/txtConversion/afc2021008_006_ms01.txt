and exercise. Not a teacher, but more like a 
conversation. Tried to have parents and seniors. 
One of the programs was EAT SMART to provide 
nutrition classes to prevent diabetes. Everyone 
got to try the recipes. Mostly moms, learning 
different ways to cook for their children. 7 or 8 
parents in one workshop. At the end they would 
get a certificate. The next workshop would be 
bigger. The workshops were very interactive

umbrella of Comite Latino? 
No, Comite Latino is only in Peekskill 
 
17:57 
Was there a time when you 
had the skills to help 
someone but not the training? 
When I was new in the field, she had to find ways 
to help and find her own resources. She was 
always looking for what the patient needed.  
20:32 
Do some of your relationships 
with clients become 
personal? 
Go beyond the professional to become personal. 
In the beginning Mirna was a patient and went to 
WESCAP and was helped by a particular woman. 
Then we become co workers of a sort - sent 
referrals to one another. Then they become 
friends.  
This friend took her to the hospital once.  
22:25 
How did your duties change 
from health promoter to 
Comite Latino coordinator? 
More responsibility - had to have proficiency in 
the resources I passed along. Her health 
promoter work made it easier. She went from 
patient to promoter to coordinator 
23:45 
Did you have more 
administrative responsibilities 
or patient work?  
Worked with both patients and volunteers. She 
had a nice variety of work. Doing events, working 
with patients, creating workshops 
MIrna as more the inside person creating 
workshops. The other worker did more outreach 
in the community. 
25:44 
How has the organization 
changed when it went from 
HRH to SunRiver 
3 years directly with patients 2 years pandemic. 
During the pandemic she coordinated the vaccine 
drives,  
 
 
Able to keep in touch with patients. 
 
 
The health center is now huge because the the 
larger geographic area. She learned a lot working 
admin, with agencies, with patients.  
 
28:26 
Speaking of the pandemic: 
did the promotoras make 
people feel better? 
People could have contact with someone they 
knew to get an appointment for a vaccine or 
doctor. Having the human connection was more 
comfortable 
 
 
Yes, they feel more comfortable telling a 
promotora etc.. who can help pass on the 
information  
 
Because of the promotoras and CHW - does it 
make people more trusting and comfortable 
 
29:13 
Do patients feel more 
comfortable at SunRiver 
because of the health 
promoters? 
Yes, sometimes they are more comfortable telling 
the health promoter than the doctor.  
30:15 
What is the value of the 
health promoter system? 
There is a huge value, they get educated and 
spread the word to the community, family and 
friends. A nice conversation with a friend rather 
than with a doctor.  
31:53 
Health promoter very different 
from doctor, who is paying 
attention mostly to health, but 
promatora is looking at 
housing, food insecurity, 
status and more. 
People come to Mirna with all of their needs. She 
asks what is the priority. Start with one and move 
to the next. Little by little try to resolve the needs. 
Works well with other agencies 
 
Health promoter very different from doctor who is 
paying attention mostly to health, but promatora is 
looking at housing, food insecurity, status and 
more 
 
35:00 
If someone told you 
something that you felt the 
doctor needed to know but it 
might breach confidentiality 
She tries to get the okay from the patient to tell 
the doctor. But sometimes people cannot 
translate what is going on so they need help 
doing that. Some people are comfortable with 
getting language help.  
37:05 
Getting to know someone in a 
very personal way in order to 
help them. One of the 
reasons the health promoter 
program is successful 
because of the holistic 
approach? Finding out very 
intimate things about people, 
it is very one sided.  You are 
not friends (at least to begin 
with). 
 
Sometimes people will try to take advantage of 
you with different stories. You get a sense that 
something is not right. Other times, people just 
want to share because there is no one else. You 
can see how people learn and change. 
Empowering people to do things for themselves.  
 
 
Empowering people to do things on their own but 
Mirna will check up on them. Helping in the 
moment and preparing them to work on their own 
 
 
 
43:36 
Would you reflect on your 
story and tell your story to 
connect with patients. Which 
Help with her divorce - to put furniture in her 
apartment.  
Her ability to Give BACk through the job.  
part is most effective 
45:05 
Heard from others - that 
shared experiences is 
fundamental to the creation of 
relationships 
Both ways, giving and receiving 
46:32 
Greatest challenges 
Communication with people in a group as she 
was shy. Challenge to find teachers for some of 
her workshops. She found a lot of volunteers at 
ESL classes. 
49:27 
What was your greatest joy?  
Helping to reduce hospital bills. Making 
connections with immigration lawyers. Watching 
people pass the citizenship test.  
50:45 
What was your professional 
life before?  
She was a dental assistant for 10 years.  
 
 
Now she is a dentist assistant again.  
52:25 
How are you taking these 
experiences forward into your 
new work?  
Integrate the practice more into the community. 
Do events and be part of the chamber of 
commerce. The dentist has to do these events so 
people can get to know him.
