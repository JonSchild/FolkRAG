and address. 
 
00:00:55 
When and where were you born? 
 
00:01:05 
She was born in Johnsburg, Wisconsin, near Fond du Lac. DOB – 
 1953.  She lived there most of her life until she moved to Appleton in 
1978. 
 
00:01:20 
Describe your childhood. 
 
00:01:30 
Johnsburg is a small rural town in an area called “the Holy Land” 
because all of the little towns there are centered on a church built on a hill: St. 
Cloud, Mount Calvary, Marytown, St. Joe’s.  Johnsburg is built around St. John 
the Baptist church. There was always a general store, a school and a few 
taverns. (laughs) Most of the kids she went to school with came from farming 
families. Her dad worked at a company in Fond du Lac. There were 6 children in 
the family: 4 girls and 2 boys. Music was a big part of their education. Neither 
parent went to high school. Both had 8th grade graduations but both prioritized 
music and scraped together money to start each child with piano lessons in 2nd

grade. All were in band.  All were in choir.  They sang in the church choir.  So 
music was a part of their upbringing.  
 
00:02:45 
Parents’ names? 
 
00:02:50 
Ruth and Cletus Schneider. Cletus Robert but everybody called him 
“Bobby.” He was the youngest of 10 children and Ruth was the 2nd oldest of 10 
children. Her dad was from Marytown and her mom was from Jericho.  
 
00:03:15 
To clarify – the names mentioned before are the names of towns, 
not parishes. 
 
00:03:35 
Yes. The town names are built kind of off the church names. 
Charlesburg is St. Charles.  Marytown is St. Mary’s. Johnsburg is St. John’s. 
There’s a large German background in the area. 
 
00:03:45 
That’s your background too, German? 
 
00:03:48 
Right.  Both mom and dad.  Both are 3rd or 4th generation from 
immigrants. We grew up with both my mom and dad speaking German so we 
were bilingual. When they didn’t want the kids to know something, they would 
switch to German. Jane is 2nd oldest of her siblings.   
 
00:04:40 
Did you grow up on a farm or in town? 
 
00:04:45 
Jane grew up on the edge of the village. They had a big garden on 
a property that was almost 2 acres.  Their property was surrounded by farm 
fields. They grew up acclimated to the seasons of farming and growing and 
butchering. Her grandparents lived and her uncles live on farms so it’s part of her 
culture.  
 
00:05:25 
In your music education, do you have a significant person or 
experience that you hold close to your heart? 
 
00:05:45 
Her piano teachers were the most influential in making music 
education her career choice.  Two teachers were especially significant – one that 
she never wanted to be like and one that she always wanted to be like.  One was 
her first piano teacher when she was in 2nd grade and afraid to go to lessons 
because you were expected to play perfectly. She’d feel relief when she walked 
out of the room but she stuck it out.  In 6th grade her piano teacher was delightful. 
She applauded no matter how you did.  She had a way of giving suggestions for 
improvement while still making you feel wonderful. That’s who she wanted to be 
like and that made a difference for her in choosing music as a career.  
 
00:06:55 
In what way?

00:07:00 
She had a big impact on Jane. Jane practiced harder for her than 
for anyone else. Jane memorized more songs and covered more literature for 
her. The teacher probably wasn’t the smartest or the most talented but she was a 
great teacher.  
 
00:07:24 
Were the lessons at her home? 
 
00:07:28 
The lessons were offered through the school, through the nuns. So 
this would have been my 6th grade teacher who was also a music teacher and 
she was also a nun at the school. The piano lessons were extra, at the school 
 
00:08:00 
Are any of your siblings still musically devoted or inclined? 
 
00:08:05 
They still will play. Two sisters are retired teachers; one brother has 
a master’s in adaptive education.  When they get together, there is a lot of 
singing and fun times with music around the piano.  When “Aunt Jane” is on the 
piano, all the little cousins gather around. That’s how they’ve carried it through. 
 
00:08:55 
Jane went to school in Johnsburg and then to St. Mary’s High 
School in Fond du Lac, another Catholic school.  Her parents made that decision, 
believing that Catholic education was important. The now-modest tuition of 
probably $600 per year was then a real sacrifice since there were 6 children and 
for more than a few years in a row there were at least three children in the school 
at one time. But her parents felt strongly about that.  That high school is where 
Jane went into choir and band.  
 
00:09:35 
Was that a bus ride each day, not residential? 
 
00:09:40 
It was not residential and there was no bussing. They rode with 
whoever was 16 and had their license. Thinking back now as a parent, you don’t 
want your children in certain circumstances.  I remember times when school 
would be cancelled because of snowstorms, and it could be a 20-minute ride to 
get back to Johnsburg. And, there were times when we stopped the car, got out 
because we couldn’t see where the road was. We would have to jump through 
and push out of snow banks. (laughs) And I think now with my own children, if 
they would have to do that, I would panic about that.  But we thought it was fun 
and games. We really did.  It was just part of living.  It was part of rural living; that 
was what you did.  
 
00:10:50 
You must have graduated in 1971.  After that, where did you 
continue on for training? 
 
00:11:00 
Jane went to a 2-year university in Fond du Lac, at the UW-Center, 
in the music program. It was nice because there were only 5-7 people in the 
music program which meant she had great access to the teachers and that they 
covered much more material than when she transferred to UW-Oshkosh as a

junior.  Her music history and music theory was advanced; she was able to test 
out of some things. Being in that smaller environment, which I did because I was 
paying for my own college and I had to work at the same time. It was closer to 
home and I could afford it. In the long run, it really paid off. 
 
00:12:00 
You graduated from UW-Oshkosh with what kind of degree? 
 
00:12:15 
She graduated in 1976 with a degree in Bachelor of Music in Music 
Education. In 1977, a Bachelor of Music in Music Therapy. She did a double 
major for that.  
 
00:12:25 
Did you pursue music therapy? 
 
00:12:27 
Yes. Jane did an internship at Southern Wisconsin Center for the 
Developmentally Disabled. The music therapy has also played into her teaching, 
though not working specifically as a music therapist.  But I can honestly say that 
having that degree and the experience that I had to take and do to get that 
degree really came in handy in the classroom.  
 
00:13:05 
Can you describe your path from graduation into the classroom? 
 
00:13:15 
From the internship in music therapy Jane interviewed for a job in 
Oshkosh at a middle school for teaching band, choir, music for special ed, and 
could also coach tennis. (laughs)  I was, you know, you’re brand new out of 
school and you just want a job so bad and I played tennis just occasionally but 
yet I was so eager I said, “Sure, I’ll do all of that.” (laughs) And the job actually 
was, I did get the job and I was there for three years. At the time she had a K-12 
license for instrumental music. She had neither a general music license nor a 
vocal music license.  But they let her come in if she would take the classes 
toward certification every year.  She taught on a one-year license until she got 
the certification. It was jumping into deep water right away.  She had close to 90 
kids in choirs that first year. It was a big learning curve. 
 
00:14:40 
I remember one of the greatest compliments I got was from the 
superintendent.  And this was on the stage because that’s where the class was 
held. The superintendent looked in the window and complemented me by saying 
this was the first time he saw every kid in his seat since he’d been there.  And I 
thought, “Well that’s progress, right?” (laughs)  She had a lot of plans for what 
she would do with the students but pretty much the first time it was just getting 
everyone to be quiet and work together as a choir and to listen and focus. It 
turned out well.  
 
00:15:40 
In fact, one of my students that I had as a sixth grader, a seventh 
grader, and an eighth grader went on to become a music teacher and he has 
written a book on teaching. He’s now a school principal.  And I just think back to 
seeing his face in my choir. He was so talented back then but he was also, he

was so sassy. (laughs)  There’s no other way to say that. And sparkly.  I just 
can’t imagine him being anything other than his bright self. But that was my first 
year of teaching and now knowing that he is as successful as he is, well, I 
couldn’t have done that bad. (laughs)  
 
00:16:15 
Do you keep in touch with many former students? 
 
00:16:20 
Occasionally.  She kept in touch with that one because he has 
written some music that she has used.  
 
00:16:35 
What is the lineage of the schools where you’ve taught? 
 
00:16:45 
The school in Oshkosh was Webster Stanley Middle School (it 
might have been “junior high” at that time). It was a 6th, 7th & 8th grade school. 
She started the job, got married in November, taught there three years, stopped 
teaching to raise her family.  They were living in Fond du Lac. Then she started 
teaching piano and organ in her house. Then her husband got transferred and 
they moved to Appleton. She taught private lessons in Appleton too with a pretty 
large studio of 30 or 33 students.  
 
00:17:35 
In 1998, a few days before the school year started, she got a phone 
call asking if she’d consider teaching Exploratory Music. She was interested but 
she didn’t have a General Music license and the license she did have had 
lapsed. But she said yes and started at Wilson Middle School in Appleton. That 
set the tone for how she’s done her job all along.  
 
Other teachers would ask her what she was teaching.  When she’d say 
Exploratory Music, they would say, “Oh, just count the days until you’re done” or  
“God bless you” or “I hear that’s really wicked.” There was a feeling that these 
kids couldn’t do band or orchestra or choir. The kids themselves, I realized, the 
kids themselves had the feeling of, “We’re the stupid ones. We’re the naughty 
ones.” And, the first day in one of the classes, a boy said to me, “We made our 
other teacher cry all the time. We’re gonna make you cry.” And I thought, “No. 
This is not gonna happen.” We were on the stage.  Literally the back wall had like 
spit balls all over. And, no materials.  There were really no books.  There were a 
handful of keyboards. I had a piano and chairs. That’s how I pretty much started.  
And there was no continuity really in the program because, I don’t believe, I think 
that maybe the teachers that took the job wanted to do well but yet they wanted 
to take the next step maybe in having the conductor position of the orchestra or 
the band or the choir.  
 
00:19:45 
Some of the things she does now came about because there were 
no things to use, no instruments. The first thing she did was invest in lots of 
drumsticks and buckets. Thinking OK, let’s get these kids moving. They are, 
they’re noisy. They’re talkative. They are somewhat undisciplined but let’s get 
playing and let’s make some sound. And giving kids in middle school drumsticks,

 afc2013/017

they’re basically the rhythm sticks like they had in elementary school but yet the 
drumsticks make a world of difference.  That was her first purchase. They had 
drum groups.  And two or three kids on a keyboard. They were spread out across 
the auditorium wherever there was a plug. That worked well. They also had a few 
guitars that they shared. They made a music video at a time when music videos 
were just starting to come about. They did it with a VHS camera and did the 
editing by turning the camera on and off. (laughs) Yet the kids were proud of 
what they produced.  It was a learning experience. They could talk about a lot of 
different aspects of music, tempos, dynamics, history. They also made 
didgeridoos. It’s a good instrument for that age group because they still have a 
lot of imagination. Even if they think they’re too cool, it still engages them. My 
three years there my goal was to increase the program quantitatively and 
qualitatively. That was my goal.  And every year, more students, more students. I 
worked really hard to get rid of that “this is where the bad kids are” because I 
didn’t like that whatsoever.  
 
00:22:15 
Is that a class that you still teach now? 
 
00:22:20 
She teaches Exploratory Music at her current school and has one 
of the largest music programs in the state with more than 320 students in her 
program.  Units are on world music drumming, guitars, keyboard, music and 
technology. That unit has changed over the years as the level of technology at 
the school has advanced. Other units are music history, music journaling, guest 
performers/guest artists that come in.  
 
00:23:05 
How have you managed to grow the program? 
 
00:23:20 
Jane has written 9 or 10 grants and through the Appleton Education 
Foundation they got the guitars. That was such a bonus right there. The 
Foundation also funded purchase of drums.  The Les and Dar Stumpf Family 
Fund for the Arts supported buying the keyboards. It’s been a process. 
 
00:24:00 
So it’s been outside money that you’ve brought in. 
 
00:24:05 
She’s had to apply for the grants.  That’s worked well and she’s 
been very thankful. The kids just get, they’re so proud of using these instruments 
and playing these instruments. The program has just grown from there because 
we do have good quality instruments now to use. And that’s been every year 
something more has come in and more has come in. She also writes grants to 
bring in performers.  Last year the Appleton Education Foundation supported 
bringing in Janet Planet, who was a former student here and is now a jazz singer 
who goes around the world. To have her on the stage at the school was 
wonderful. 
 
00:25:00 
Do you have allies in the school district that you can turn to for help 
in reaching your goals? 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
6
 
7 
 
00:25:15 
Yes.  Her principal is great; she’s always had really good principals. 
She runs ideas past them and they’ve always been very supportive. She writes 
grant proposals so that the instruments can be used at all of the schools in the 
district. I made it so that guitars can go one quarter at each of our middle 
schools. Same with the keyboards. So that the programs can have those things 
also at the other schools.   
 
00:25:55 
Classroom teachers have grade level teams. Do you have a team 
that you work with? 
 
00:26:10 
They have the music department but they don’t get to see each 
other. They see each other only in the halls. Sometimes if the all four of us, the 
choir teacher, the band teacher, the orchestra teacher, and myself, sometimes all 
of a sudden we see all four of us together and we call it a music meeting 
because it’s, unless it’s outside of schooltime, we don’t have any common time.  
 
00:26:40 
Do you get together out of school? 
 
00:26:42 
Not socially.  
 
00:26:50 
Do you socialize with others from the school? 
 
00:26:53 
A few people. One of her best friends is an art teacher at West High 
School. They see each other a lot.  
 
00:27:10 
Do you share teaching stories with her?  Is that a sounding board 
for you? 
 
00:27:15 
It’s good because they share similar ups and downs.  Because 
she’s an art teacher and me being a music teacher, the fine arts, and even just 
Encore in general, which would be your Family and Consumer Education, your 
tech ed, your visual arts, things like that, changes have been made that have 
caused somewhat of an erosion in the program and those are those kind of 
things that only someone who is affected by it can understand so we do pass a 
lot of things back and forth. I know that I can talk about things with her and she 
will understand and we can hopefully gain (laughs) some kind of way to change 
things.  
 
00:28:10 
What are some significant ways in which music education has 
changed in your time as a teacher? 
 
00:28:35 
It’s changed in two ways. The fact by the fact that our time has 
been, was cut; we used to have a 50-minute class period and a few years ago it 
was changed to 40-minutes. It’s changed by the fact that, larger class sizes. I do 
remember the days when 24 or 25 were an average class size. And I remember 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

8 
when the 27.5 students per class was supposed to be the average. Well, those 
days are long gone. We’re now in the mid-30s, with a few smaller classes here 
and there. But, that’s the way things have changed.  
 
We’re also required now, my job looks like this. I teach 12 sections of 
Exploratory Music every other day, every other Friday. It used to be 10 sections 
but when they cut the time down, they gave us an extra section per day. So now, 
full time jobs that used to be 200 students is now closer to 300.  
The one thing, if I could have anything, is to go back to a lower class size 
just because you can’t get enough done.  I always have this goal of addressing 
each student by their name every class. So you have 40 minutes. By the time 
kids get in, if you’re not by the door greeting or so, but sometimes that time goes 
by so fast and you realize that, you know, as you’ve gone through your lesson 
you haven’t addressed every single child in that classroom, and I feel that’s 
important. So smaller class sizes would be where I would go right away to a 
change that I’d like to see. 
 
00:30:25 
Would you describe a typical day? 
 
00:30:35 
Jane usually arrives at 6:30 or 6:45.  Her first class starts at 7:50.  
She sets up and makes sure everything is ready for class, which might include 
tuning instruments or getting out instruments. She has Exploratory in first and 
second periods. Then she has a 30-minute ‘target time,’ which is new this year. 
She has a group of students and she’s associated with a core team. During 
target time she has to do math or reading with the students because of RTI and 
the school goal of reading at a certain level and math. Things are still getting 
worked out with that. That’s a program that everyone has to be on board. The 
program is based on test scores. The math teacher has a pull out group of 
students that need intervention and the other groups can be intervention or 
enrichment groups. It should be based on how they’re scoring on their WKCE or 
MAP test. It’s supposed to be a fluid group that shifts throughout the year for 
enrichment and to reinforce skills. The school is still working out logistics.  Many 
people are on board but others resent the extra work.  
She’s totally on board with it.  She took a class to prepare.  If I’m going to 
do something, I’m going to do it right. I don’t want to be sitting back and thinking, 
“Oh, this is not going to work.” So I took a class in it in RTI-1 and RTI-2. And I 
thought, how can I make this work in my music class?”  And one of the lessons 
that I did develop was when we had the guitars at our school, I taught math 
practices through playing the guitar. Because the math practices work actually 
across the board for any subject area. It involved listening, evaluating your work, 
being precise, and talking about how to use it in math, music and life. She 
included a pre-test and post-test which showed a lot of growth.  
 
00:34:20 
What is RTI? 
 
00:34:25 
RTI is “Response to Intervention.” It’s about good teaching and 
responding to the specific needs of the child as they change and the learning 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

process goes on. It also has to do with behavior. There are three tiers. It’s a big 
movement across the entire country. It’s grounded in a lot of research but it’s 
based on test scores, evaluations and constant assessments of where the child 
is. 
 
00:35:20 
Has the move toward more testing affected your teaching in other 
ways beyond “target time”? 
 
00:35:40 
It affects it because of the timing.  They shifted to a team structure 
and the extra time has gone to the team in order to do different groupings.  So 
instead of 10 time periods in a day, they can structure as needed. They took time 
away from ENCORE and gave it to what is called “the core.”  But the testing part 
of it affects every single person in the school because the kids MAP test in 
September and they MAP test in Spring. A certain group of kids also do MAP 
testing in January or February, I believe.  We do our WKCE test, which next year 
is going to turn into Smarter Balance, in a window in November, I believe.  
WKCE is done at one time for the entire school but the MAP test is done 
via teams, which take turns on the computers in the lab so all the computers in 
the school are tied up. With a big school like this, it takes a lot of time and a lot of 
focus away from other things. Her colleagues plan their concerts around it. 
Because kids miss class or have to do make ups, she plans special units or ones 
where kids can step in easily and not be lost during the two weeks that the test is 
running.  
 
00:38:05 
You sound like you’re highly adaptive to the changing 
circumstances of the school and its structure.  
 
00:38:15 
I always describe it as being a willow; you just blow in the wind. On 
top of that, she sees all six teams in 7th and 8th grades, and she has classes of 
mixed teams.  So if one team takes a field trip or is out of the building for another 
reason, only half the kids are there. So she has to have very flexible lessons. 
You do have to be really malleable with your content so that you don’t feel like 
you’re re-teaching a certain group and the other ones. So you have to adjust all 
the time pretty much. 
 
00:39:20 
So, we’ve gotten through your 3rd period.  What happens in the rest 
of your day? 
 
00:39:35 
There would be two more classes. She has 7th grade in the morning 
this year.  Then she’d have one or two 8th grade classes before lunch. A few 
more classes in the afternoon. On Mondays and Wednesdays she has a 
Cognitive Disabilities Music Program, which she loves. On Wednesdays, she 
also has music for an EBD program (Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities) for 
about 20 – 30 minutes. They earn their right to come to music and we focus on 
the guitars and the drums, like a band, almost. And do things where they can 
sound good right away and play together so that it’s just kind of a reward for

them to come. She sees different kids on Tuesdays and Thursdays though with a 
pretty similar schedule. 
 
00:40:55 
Do you get a lunch time? 
 
00:40:55 
Yes though lunch is usually at the desk checking email, seeing if 
there’s anything that needs to be handled immediately, and otherwise red 
flagging things to be dealt with after school. Lunch can also include walking, 
getting the mail, talking to a teacher, making a phone call, or responding to a 
parent. She tries to eat things that can be handled right at the desk. She rarely 
goes to the lunch room.  
 
00:41:40 
Do you go to the teacher staff room? 
 
00:41:42 
Very rarely for anything other than to use the bathroom. If she 
needs to contact a particular teacher, she knows their lunch schedules and will 
go in there to find them. I stay away from the lunch room a little bit because 
sometimes, I don’t know, I think the lunch room sometimes conversations can be 
letting out emotions and steam and all and sometimes I don’t want to have that 
atmosphere because the time goes by so fast, I could say.  Not always but I do, 
we do have staff appreciation week and that’s when our parent groups bring in all 
kinds of different things and different treats.  I make it down for that point in time. 
We have a great parent group here. Lots of support. 
 
00:42:45 
Let’s wrap up the day.  
 
00:43:00 
The last class is at 2:08.  Then a prep period until 2:50.  Then a 
resource period until 3:20, which is a time when kids can come to her room. This 
year we’ve had a 7th grade girls’ band. We’ve had an 8th grade band.  It’s been 
delightful to have the kids be able to have the kids come in and practice. Or they 
can come in during the keyboard unit, put their headphones on and practice. 
Right now, during this last part, I had kids working on their music videos with me 
in the classroom. Or, like now, the 7th graders were designing and putting the 
wax on their didgeridoos. They would come in.  So that’s what this time is used 
for.  
They’re losing that time next year. They’re taking away Resource and 
moving it into the team time. She doesn’t have next year’s schedule yet so she 
doesn’t know if the only way she could make it work is grabbing kids during her 
lunch period. There won’t be any extra time unless before school or after school. 
I don’t want to think about that yet. That’s next year. I’ll think about it next year 
like tomorrow’s another day, like Scarlett O’Hara. (laughs) 
 
00: 44:25 
What do you do once the school day is over technically? 
 
00:44:35 
Usually if there aren’t meetings she’s at school until 5:00 or 5:30. 
That’s when she tries to work on emails, plans. There’s so many emails. I have, 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

with all my students, there’s probably about 70 or 80 students that have IEPs. 
And if I’m not sitting in on an IEP as a regular ed rep, I’m filling, the teachers ask 
for information. They’ll send an email asking, “Can you answer these questions? 
Can you say how this student has been doing in your classroom? Are they 
having any problems?” And I just, they take time because I don’t want to just be 
real callous about it and write anything. So it takes me a long time to respond to 
those. 
 
00:45:25 
That’s Individual Education Plan? 
 
00:45:40 
Yes.  So it might be a student with a learning disability or behavior 
disability or even cognitive disability, a blind or deaf student, or a student with 
special needs. Their case manager (teacher) writes the IEP so they gather 
information from other teachers for that. So, she’s at school until 5:00 or 5:30. 
 
00:46:10 
So, an 11-hour day? 
 
 
 
Pretty much (laughs).  
 
00:46:15 
Thank you for making time for this in those 11 hours!  What has 
happened during your career that has made you feel appreciated? 
 
00:46:35 
Oh gosh, you know, the parents, the parent who comes and says, 
“My child never liked music before and now they’re taking guitar lessons.”  You 
know, that’s just great.  
Also, they have the Texas Roadhouse Award. Anybody in the school can 
write up why you deserve that. And so when we’re at a faculty meeting and then 
they’ll read something that somebody wrote about you and you’re always like,  
“Oh my goodness!”  Texas Roadhouse gives a jar of peanuts and a meal.  
Also the Milke Family has an Educator of the Year award. Someone 
nominates you. I received that a few years ago and that made me feel just 
humbled, I guess, because you’re being recognized for your work.  
 
There also are some awards that a teacher can be nominated for through 
the school. The Kohl Fellowship within the State of Wisconsin. I received that one 
year which, that also was a “Oh my goodness!” you know. It was great.  I still 
think it’s that letter from the student or the email that comes through and says 
something like, “I’m doing this now in college because of what you did in your 
class.”  Or, “I still remember when…”  Those are the things that like, “Oh my! You 
made a difference there.”  So, yeah. 
 
00:48:30 
Are there flip side moments in your career where something has felt 
oppressive or you felt disrespected as a professional, either experiences or 
structures?  
 
00:48:50 
I think that probably the biggest one was three years ago with Act 
10.  I’m a pretty, I’m not a very, I’m more of a peacemaker than a make-waves

kind of person but I was at the Capitol that first day. And I felt very strongly about 
what was going on with our Governor and with our government. And I knew what 
the effect was gonna be. So that probably was the one time that it was a big 
cause and effect. I don’t want to say, it did affect the school. It affected just your 
perception of when you’d read things in the paper. We ended up cancelling the 
paper even because there was so much negativity going on. There was in the 
school too. You could just tell. There was not the same brightness, same 
eagerness and enthusiasm because I think people felt kind of beaten down. And 
the job changed. I don’t think if that would have happened, I don’t think I’d be 
doing math and reading in a target time. I really don’t think that that would have 
happened. I don’t think that I’d be having as many students and sections. My full 
time job ten years ago looked a lot different than my full time job nowadays. 
 
So that was, that had a big effect. You had to really turn it off and say, you 
know, teaching still is about being in the classroom and with the kids. And all that 
other stuff, just shut the door.  
 
00:50:40 
Has there been a change in morale among the staff; has some of 
the sparkle come back?  
 
00:50:45 
It has come back.  I think that what has happened is that, if you are 
a teacher, a true teacher is going to be teaching no matter what the 
circumstances are. This is the third year now and things have come around more 
so than in that first year. So I think it is coming back.  
I feel for our young teachers because I think that our young teachers, 
they’re so excited to be actually teaching and doing the job but some of the 
requirements that are placed on all of us now: 40 hours of professional 
development outside of your school work day, the things that you have to do just 
to be even considered for a pay increase, all of that is very iffy. And these kids 
that are starting – not kids – these teachers that are starting out at pretty much 
the minimum basic for teachers, they don’t, you can’t really see the cost of living 
and how I’m going to be able to grow more financially. And that’s, you know, you 
can love your job but if you can’t, if you have to have a second job to afford your 
house payment and stuff.  
There are still many things that need to be looked at. Jane is at the end of 
her career and she took classes all along and could advance. She’s grateful that 
happened before all these changes came along. She feels grateful to have had a 
living wage during her career that was compensatory toward what she was 
doing.  
 
00:53:00 
Do you know teachers who have a second job to make a living? 
 
00:53:05 
Yes. I do.  Lots of teachers do. They have second businesses or 
they do things outside of the school day. Like they would work at a store or they 
work holiday hours someplace. A lot of the music teachers I know teach lessons 
outside of the school day, in their homes.

00:53:30 
Would you advise a young person to go into teaching? I wish I 
could capture your face right now because you’re answering it with your 
expression! 
 
00:53:45 
 I have, my goddaughter is going to be an elementary school 
teacher and I tried to talk her out of it. Which doesn’t sound very good for the 
godmother to do that but I said, “You have to realize that the way things are right 
now with you being brand new” (well, she’s going to be graduating soon) “you’ve 
got to realize that the job is going to look a little different than what it was like 
when you were in school and that you have to really think hard and long about 
where you want to go. If you’re going to pursue education then be as diverse as 
possible so that you can land a job and that you’ll be able to make good strides in 
it.” It’s that passion for teaching is what got me into it and what gets a lot of 
people into it and I don’t like to see that go away because you still are passionate 
about that. But some of the things happening politically have affected the 
profession, I guess. You could say it that way.  
 
I don’t know. (sighs) I think that we’re going to see a swing though. You 
know, things might not change. I don’t think it’s going to change for a few years 
yet but there will be a time when you can see more advancement with the more 
knowledge you gain and the more years of experience and the more experiences 
that you actually have, I’m hoping to see that you’d be compensated equally and 
fairly.  
It’s a touchy subject. Three years ago, even within my own family, I can 
say that there were people that agreed and disagreed and, it’s a touchy subject.  
 
00:55:45 
Is it touchy within the profession as well? 
 
00:55:55 
She thinks yes. Within a school system, there is an element of 
judgment related to advancement so that might affect a dialogue you have with 
someone. It’s also competitive now; people are pitted against each other. She’s 
heard teachers say that they wouldn’t get a student teacher because then that 
person might get hired and they’d have the teacher’s lesson plans, which could  
affect the merit base of their evaluation. She heard that kind of comment three 
years ago, less this year. While you want to work together as a team, at the 
same time you know you’re going to be judged on how many times you show up 
in the summer or for evening events. So now teachers do things not because 
they want to but because they know it might affect others’ perception of them. 
That’s a difference. These are the conversations you have in passing with 
someone.  
 
Schools now get report cards and the public sees those. Teachers want 
the report card to reflect the school’s growth and to look the best. 
 
00:58:10 
Have you felt specific pressures because of those school report 
cards? 
 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

00:58:15 
Yes. Reading has to be infused in everything.  Their continuous 
school improvement goals are goals they have to incorporate in every subject in 
the school, which means teachers will take a different approach.  She spent a lot 
of time correcting writing entries (spelling, punctuation, capitalization, quotes, 
complete sentences) during the Music Journaling unit, for 300 students each with 
a folder’s worth of journaling. She doesn’t mind doing it but it adds a lot of time to 
the grading process. She’s had to take classes so that she could be sure she 
was teaching the right skills.  
 
01:00:15 
Today Jane is staying at school after the interview for an honors  
ceremony for the 8th graders. 
 
01:00:30 
Can you describe the room you work in now? 
 
01:00:45 
She’s in her 3rd room in this school, Madison Middle School. Her 
first room was in the core set of classrooms so her main concern was that they’d 
make disturbing sounds. So she would sign out the auditorium for drumming. 
That was a small room. Then she moved to a huge classroom next to the art and 
tech ed rooms. Their sounds didn’t matter there. Then when they switched to 
core time, she had to move to the other side of the building. The room was small 
but her main concern was having enough electricity for 35 keyboards. The 
principal kindly put in lots of outlets and wiring. It’s wired to code now. The room 
is in the farthest south corner now.  
I’m a teacher who likes to take her kids outside. I think there’s nothing 
better than singing and playing outside. So a few years ago, there was no place 
on this campus where there was seating or anything. I wrote a grant for an 
outdoor classroom. And I got a Scout that was working toward his Eagle to build 
it, and so right outside my classroom now is the outdoor classroom which is the 
little copse of trees with benches. And I can see from my windows, I can see the 
outdoor classroom. So moving to that new classroom, which was smaller, is like 
wow, we’re right there. And so sometimes I’ll work with kids in the classroom and 
the other ones will be outside. I’ve got the window right there and they can come 
up and ask questions. Then they can sit out there and practice whatever it is.  
I always figure, no matter what there’s always some good in something 
and that’s the case where it’s like, wow, this is nice. We can just go out the back 
door and here we are. They have been using it a lot over the past two weeks. No 
winter use, only the fall and the spring.  
 
01:03:20 
Along with the instruments and outdoor classroom you’ve 
mentioned, are there other tools or equipment that are important for your 
teaching? 
 
01:03:30 
Last year I got a smart board. (laughs) I thought it was Christmas. 
It’s amazing. I still stand at it and think, “Wow, I’m so fortunate to be still teaching 
to be able to do this.” She has a lot to learn so she put herself on a schedule to 
learn something new every week and use it. And I still get goose-bumpy and 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

excited. Sometimes I think the kids must think, “Boy, she’s such an oddball.”  It’s 
important to have the smart board because kids have technology all around them 
and this is so basic to them. Before, in a listening lesson, she would put on a CD, 
they would listen to it and then they’d journal. Now everything can be up there. 
They can see the performance and talk about it. They can center in on 
something. 
 
Jane has the kids bring their phones or iPods or iPads and assigns them 
to find something about Beethoven to tell to the class, listen to some of his music 
and journal about it. She puts them in groups for this.  They do well with this. 
They like it. They are listening to things on their ear buds all the time anyway so 
she wants to put that to work for her.  
 
It is an exciting time to be teaching with all those things. I still can’t believe 
that when I first started it was the old mimeograph machine. And now, we don’t 
even make copies half the time. I’ll just say, “Pull it up on your device.”  Or they’ll 
pull music up and play it on their keyboard. 
 
01:06:15 
Any jargon that is unique to your school? 
 
01:06:30 
She doesn’t know a lot about that but a common saying to explain 
someone’s behavior is, “It’s middle school,” to account for someone’s unruliness 
or screaming in the hall. It’s an age level that gets excitable or sleepy. 
Sometimes they’ll just fall out of their chairs without doing anything. “It’s middle 
school.” 
 
Their mascot is the Wildcats.  Our “Wildcat Way” is their behavior plan 
with respect for education, self and environment. Their rewards are “wileys” 
which teachers give to students for meeting expectations or doing something 
good.  
 
01:08:35 
Is there something we haven’t covered that you wanted or expected 
to talk about? Anything else you want to add? 
 
01:08:55 
I think the fact that teaching has changed over the years a lot but 
what’s still the same is, it’s still at the middle level, the kids. They come in in 
September bright and shiny and throughout the years things change for them. 
You see them mature or have experiences where they maybe make bad choices 
but yet it always comes to the same thing where it’s like they want to do well.  
And kids come in eager, really, they do come in eager to learn. I think when we 
have them here it’s a precious time with them. We only have them for a short 
amount of time, being a two-year middle school.  
 
01:09:50 
This was wonderful to talk about this range of topics.  I have a 
couple of detail questions. Of the four music teachers, you named three types.  
What’s your label? What kind of music teacher are you?  
 
1:10:20 
I’m the Exploratory Music teacher. That’s in addition to the 
orchestra teacher, the choir and the band. All of the district’s middle schools offer 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

16 
those. At the other schools, it might be only one or two Exploratory classes but at 
Madison MS it’s a full time position.  
 
1:10:50 
You named two tests: the MAP test and the WKCE. Can you say 
what those are? 
 
 
 
The MAP test shows growth. As the student is taking it on the 
computer, the program is comparing it to the last time the student took the test 
and gauging the student’s growth and adjusting the questions to get 
progressively harder until they miss a large number of questions.  Then the 
program goes back and forth between difficulty of questions to find where the 
student would land in reading, comprehension and computation. That test has 
the most value of any of the tests the students take because they get immediate 
feedback and they are comparing themselves only to themselves, not to anybody 
else. Before the test, they go over with the students their last scores and discuss 
the growth they should show. A lot of kids are motivated to try to beat their score, 
more than just taking a random test. They take it in the fall and again in the 
spring, in April. They go through the test results with the kids too.  
 
Jane doesn’t remember what MAP stands for. The WKCE test is the State 
of Wisconsin test and it will be replaced with Smarter Balance next year, which is 
also a computer-based test. She doesn’t know much about it except that it’s 
supposed to be a better gauge of progress. 
 
01:13:35 
Are you thinking about retirement? 
 
01:13:40 
Her goal is to teach until she’s 65. I figure once I start dreading the 
first day of school, because I don’t. I still get all excited about it. And once, if I 
start to count days or think how many days, then it’s time to consider, you know, 
retiring.  But I don’t do that yet. I mean, I think I will know when I do that. I’m 
healthy and I still get excited about it. I still feel like I have a lot more to learn and 
a lot more to share and, yeah. I’m not looking to walk through that door quite yet.
