[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
September 15, 1939]
September 15, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse c/o Writers' Project in Florida 40 West Duval Street Jacksonville,
Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Your letter of September 7 and the latest shipment of records have just come to my
attention. Even before opening the package of records, it occurs to me that you may be
short of blanks. Since it sometimes takes quite a while to obtain these discs, will you
please let me know how many you have on hand and when you will need a new supply?
Again let me remind you that we have not yet received the official request for the
continuance of the project.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
HS mr
