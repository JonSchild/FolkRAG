Teddy Regan. 
TEDDY REGAN courted Winnie, 
He loved her as he loved his life; 
Her father gave her fifty guineas, 
The night that she became his wife. 
Now and then they saved a 
guinea; 
Things went on extremely well, 
Until the slender waist of Winnie 
In the course of time began to swt11. 
Cuonus. 
Fal de ral de ral de raddy, 
Fal de ral de ral de ray, 
Fal de ral de ral de raddy, 
Fal de ral de ral de ray! 
'Twas in the night she took her labor, 
Winnie then began to screech : 
She roared and bawled out murder, 
Waking Teddy from his sleep. 
Up he gets so very civil, 
Silent from the bed he rose; 
Winnie wished him to the devil, • 
Saying: hutry up, get on your clothes.

Teddy went to fetch the Doctor, 
To call the neighbors on his way; 
He roared and bawled out murder, 
Saying, hurry up, make no delay. 
There was Jemmy Regan and his mother, 
Straight to Winnie then they came, 
Biddy Murphy and her brother, 
But I 
forget the Doctor's name. 
Fal de ral de ral, &c. 
Oh! the pain that's in my stomach! 
Oh! the pain that's in my back! 
Oh, if I 
could only vomit, 
My aching heart would surely crack. 
Says the mother from the corner, 
While the tears ran down her eyes: 
Take it easy, my dear daughter, 
You'll be better bye and bye. 
Fal de ral de ral, &c. 
My eurse attend you, Teddy Regan, 
And the hour when we were wed; 
I 
thought that I 
had suffered plenty, 
From the aching of my head. 
Says the Doctor to her mother: 
Give her some tea that's in the pot; 
No, we will make her some gruel, 
For to keep her body hot. 
Fal de ral de ral, &c. 
They began to prepare the baby's linen, 
Everything along that way; 
Tea and coffee, and the best of spirits, 
For the long expected day. 
Why are you so idly standing, 
Don't you hear the Doctor bawl ? 
" 
Faith ! I 
do," says Bridget Murphy; 
And the baby began to squall.

When the hurry it was over, 
Winnie she lay snug in bed; 
It's then she was in her clover, 
She began to think of Tedd. 
Then says Winnie to her mother: 
Make us a 
strong cup of tea, 
And give some to poor Teddy, 
For I'll want Ted. another 'day.

Green-Grocer's Lament. 
AIR: The lad wi' the carroty head. 
On, dear! it's a 
werry hard ease, I 
must say, 
As each feeling creeter viii own, 
That the vorld should get vickeder every day, 
And von't leave a 
man's ass alone! 
My ass is as rummy a 
von as you've seed, 
A 
regilar good un to go; 
But to see how he's used, vy it makes my heart bleed, 
I 
really could cry at his vo! 
Oh, dear, oh, crickey! oh! 
The times have now come to a 
werry fine pass, 
Yen a 
man cannot keep to himself his own ass. 
I 
takes him to market for greens every morn, 
And oft, ven he doesn't go quick, 
I'm oblig'd, d'ye see, though it makes me forlorn, 
To vollop him veil vith my stick! 
But vonce, ' cause I 
hit him just.over the head, 
To the station they bore me away; 
And tho' sich a 
slap- up- defence I 
there made, 
I'd forty-five hog down to pay! 
Oh, dear, So. 
Injustice predominant reigns now, alas ! 
When a 
covey can't even now kick his own ass. 
Sometimes of a 
ev'ning I 
vith him do stand 
Vith many more asses beside; 
To let him out to the children at hand, 
A 
penny-a-piec3 for a 
ride! 
T'vos only labt veek I 
vos took 'afore the beak, 
And for that same thing I 
vos fined. 
Acause I 
vos standing obstructing the road, 
And my ass it vos standing behind! 
Oh, dear, &c. 
The times they have come to a 
werry fine pass 
When a 
covey can't even now show his own ass. 
To a 
horsepond my donkey I 
did take von day 
To vosh him it vos my desire ; 
Ven a 
pigman com'd up and did hold of me lay, 
His business I 
then did inquire. 
He swore that I'd trespass'd, so took me to quad, 
My ass to the green-yard vos borne, 
And the beak again fined me—he did, s'elp my bob, 
And kept me eonfin'd till the morn, 
Oh, dear, &c. 
The times they have come to a,werry fine pass 
Yen a 
man with cold water can't vosh his own ass. 
But in spite of the law I 
viii keep my ass still, 
And viii do vith my ass as I 
please; 
My ass is my own, and keep to him I 
viii, 
Tor my ass often gives me great ease. 
I'm noted around both near and afar, 
My story's known—north, east, west, and south, 
Each person I 
know, and each person I 
meet, 
They've all got my ass in their mouth. 
, Oh, dear, dze. 
In spite of the law, and in spite of each elf 
in future I 
viii keep my ass to myself.

One Pound Two. 
M AGGY, dear, I 
come to hear that you've been on a 
spree. 
Where is my whole week's wages, I 
pray come tell to me ; 
When I 
come home at night I 
find no smell of drink on you, 
Yet I 
would like to know how you laid out my One Pound Two. 
Oh, Johnny, dear, I 
have it here, penned down in black and white, 
Come count it now right after me, and you will say I'm right; 
You've been told that I've been on a 
spree, but you'll find it is not 
true, 
For I 
will let you know how I 
laid out your One Pound Two. 
In the first place there is one shilling paid for two stone of meal, 
Served four of us around the week—I 
am sure it aint a 
great deal, 
And four stone of potatoes, for you know no less would do, 
That's three and twopence halfpenny out of your One Pound Two. 
For two hundred weight of coal three shillings I 
did pay, 
Fourpenny loaf each morning, and two on the Sabbath day, 
And every morning for the child—it's a 
baby son it's true, 
That's seven and eleven pence out of your One Pound Two. 
Seven pence for sugar, seven pence for tea, 
Seven pence for tobacco, that's one penny worth each day, 
And one shilling for beef, you know no less would do, 
That's ten and ninepence ha'penny out of your One Pound Two. 
Sixpence for a 
pound of ham, and seven pence for a 
steak, 
And sixpence for vegetables it every week does take, 
Fourpence for two eggs this day I 
paid for you, 
That's eleven and eleven pence ha'penny out of your One Pound Two. 
Twenty pence for butter, John—you know it's of the best, 
And fourpence more for buttermilk—now add that to the rest; 
Oh, Johnny, dear, you ask what with your money I 
do, 
That's thirteen and tenpence ha'penny out of your One Pound Two. 
There is four shillings for rent, that's all we do require, 
And ninepence for sticks for to kindle up the fire, 
And one shilling for milk, soap, soda, starch, and blue, 
Add that up and you will exactly find your One Pound Two. 
Maggy, dear, your neighbors on you do complain, 
They tell me my whole wages you every day do spend. 
That a 
virtuous woman is worth gold I 
find it to be true: 
You've exactly counted up my One Pound Two.

The River Roc. 
As I 
went out one evening, all in the month of June, 
The primroses, and daisies, and violets were in bloom, 
I 
espied a 
lovely fair one, and her I 
did not know, 
I 
took her for an angel that was bathing in the Roe. 
Her teeth were like ivory, her skin a 
lily white, 
Her cheeks as red as roses, her eyes like diamonds bright, 
Her surname I'll not tall, lest you might htr know, 
But her master's habitation is on the River Roe. 
I 
quickly stepped up to her, and this to her did say: 
" 
Are you a 
goddess, or s 
hat brought you this way ?" 
She answered me right modestly, and said: " I 
am not so, 
I'm but a 
servant maid that was bathing in the Roe." 
I 
said " My pretty fair maid, if with me you'll agree, 
We'll join our hands in wedlock, and wedded we will be, 
My father he's a 
nobleman, the country well does know, 
And his dwelling lies convenient to the River Roe." 
She quickly made me answer, and this to me did say: 
" 
My mistress she is waiting, I 
have no time to stay, 
I'll meet you to-morrow, and my mistress won't know 
We'd have some conversing on the River Roe." 
They both shook hands and parted, from each other did go, 
In hopes to meet next morning along the River Roe; 
She dressed herself in private, away then she did go, 
Her true-love he was waiting along the River Roe. 
When she came up to him he thus to her did say: 
l'm glad to meet you here, my love, upon this very day; 
I'm glad to meet your here, love, the way that I 
will know. 
If you're going to wed with me, and dwell beside the River Roe. 
She modestly made answer, and said she was content, 
I 
kissed and embraced her, and then away both went; 
We were married next evening, as you will shortly know, 
She has servants to attend her, and she dwells upon the Roe. 
It was within ten miles of Newton, convenient to the tide, 
You'll find my habitation convenient to the soil, 
You will see ships from Limerick sailing down the silvery tide, 
And the lads and lasses sparking along the river side. 
Farewell to friends and parents, and to the flowing quay, 
Likewise my old acquaintance, and I 
have no tim3 to stay. 
Here is a 
health to my own sweeetheart, the girl that you know, 
And we will sing to the maid that dwells along the River Roe.

0 311iley the Fisherman. 
As I 
roved out one evening fair, down by the river side, 
I 
heard a 
lovely maid complain, the tears fell from her eyes, 
This is a 
cold and stormy night, those words she then did say: 
" 
My love is on the raging sea, bound for America. 
" 
My love he was a 
fisherman, his age was scarce eighteen, 
He was as nice a 
young man as ever yet was seen; 
My father he had riches great, and Riley he was poor, 
Because I 
loved this fisherman they could not him endure. 
"John O'Riley was my true love's name, reared near the town of 
Bray, 
My mother took me by the hand and these word,' to me did say: 
If you be fond of Riley let him quit this country, 
Your father says he 11 take his life, so shun his company.' 
" 
0, mother, dear, don't be severe, where will you send my love, 
My very heart lies in his breast as constant as a 
dove." 
'
4 
0, daughter, dear, I'm not severe, here is one thousand pounds, 
So send Riley t3 America to purchase there some ground. 
When Ellen got the money, to Riley she did run, 
Saying, " This very night to take your life my father charged a 
gun; 
Here is one thounend pound in gold my mother sent to you, 
So sail away to America and I 
will follow you. 
When Riley got the money next day he sailed away, 
And when he put his foot on board, those words she then did say: 
' " Here is a 
token of true love, and we'll break it now in two, 
You'll have have my heart and half my ring unlit I'll find out you." 
It was in three months after, as he was waiting by the shore, 
When Riley he came back again to take his love away 
The ship was wrecked, all hands were lost, her father grieved full 
sore, 
And found Riley in her arms, and they drowned upon the shore. 
He found a 
letter in her breast, and it was wrote with blood, 
Baying, " cruel was my father, that thought to shoot my love." 
So let this be now a 
warning to all fair maids so gay, 
To never let the lads they love go to America.

Irish Schoolmaster. 
OLD Teddy O'Rourke kept a 
bit of a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and niade it a 
rule, 
If the mind wouldn't mark, faith he'd soon mark the back, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devilish crack. 
His scholars were : Jerry, Big Billy, and Ned, 
With Murrogh ll'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, 
Tall Dermot O'Clany, and Dennis O'Shea, 
Faith, all noble boys to drive learning away. 
Seoumv—Well, my boys, says old Ted, as you are all here, I'll 
just be calling your names over, to see if any of ye are missing. 
Gerald M'Shee.—I'm not here, sir.—Then where re you, agrah ?— 
I'm astride of the door, sir.—Then come in, and I'll beat you. 
Comey O'Flaherty.—I'm here, but my brother Barney ain't.—Then 
where is your brother Barney !—Faith, sir, he's dead and they're 
going to wake hini.—Poor fellow 
I'm sorry he's gone home, for 
he was my own scholar; but do you go and sit down, and don't fall 
asleep, or I'll be after waking you. 
• 
• 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he's always ready, 
To 
kick up a 
row or the whiskey to smack; 
With his drinking and eating, 
His birching and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row de dow whack. 
Faith, Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton, 
And a 
chin, too l 
och honey, but they were all one ; 
A 
grin, too, lie had, and if there was a 
noise, 
He'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
A 
fortune he had, too :—his birch and his wig, 
A 
black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pretty plantation, a 
dog and a cat, 
And his head that he kept in an old greasy hat. 
SPONEN : 
— Phelim O'Maheney, says he, one day, before you sit 
down, stand up, and say your alphabet, so keep your five fingers out 
of your head for a 
few minutes, and begin. What letter's that, sir? 
—I don't know, sir.—Arrah, botheration to you, what was it I 
said 
when I 
saw you blacking Pat Mooney's eye ?—Faith, sir, you said: 
Ahi you big blackguard.—Well, never mind the blackguard, but

say Ah.—Ah.—Now, what letter's that ?.—Faith, sir, I 
don't know, 
you ought to know better than me.—What makes the honey, and 
hold your whist ?_B.—That's a 
good boy. 
Now, what kind of a 
half moon thing do you call that ?—I 
don't know, sir.—Och! bothera-
tion, what do I 
do with my eyes f—Hel he! he I—Well, what do 
you laugh at, sir? I 
ask you what do I 
do with my eyes 4—You ? 
you squint !—And what else, sir ?—You see.—That's a 
good boy. 
Now go on.—D-E-F-G-IL —Well, why do you stop ?—Because 
can't go any further, sir.—What has your mother got at the corner 
of her nose ?—A pimple, sir.—Och, my service t'ye, sir; and what 
else ?—One eye.—Devil take you, and don't be getting into figures 
now. 
Say I, without the one.—I, without the one.—What's the' 
next P—It's something, sir, but I 
don't know what.—What does your 
mother open the door with ?—A 
string, sir, and sometimes her foot.— 
Well, did you never have anything else ?—Yes, sir, K.—That's a 
good boy ; and now, as you have got to L, (
hell) you may sit down 
and warm yourself. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he was always ready, 
To kick up a 
row, or the whiskey to smack, 
• 
With his drinking and eating, 
his birching and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row de dow whack. 
Paddy Miles. 
Fitom the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if anything wint wrong, or a 
mischief 'twas done, 
Shure they'd have all the blame on my mother's own son. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Conner, 
'Pon an Irishman's three word and honor, 
Oh, misfortune my curse light.upon her, 
'Twas she christened me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they'd say Paddy Miles; 
Who was it set fire to his reverence's wig, 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig, 
Who called Mishes Maloney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGee's cat the jallop, 
Some blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
z 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
15 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From my master, Mick Flynn, a 
character I 
brought, 
But it done me no good, and I thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to leave the ould sod, 
For the devil a 
wan would employ me, 
The girls there they would annoy me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me, 
All beka.se I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Who cut off one of the tails of Pat Finegan's coat, 
And who broke the left horn of Ned Shoughnessy's goat, 
Who through the back door to the chapel got in, 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds what a 
sin, 
Who half murdered a 
poor-house inspector, 
And fired at a 
police detector, 
When Miss Fagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'er saw me there, faix, they all knew my face, 
The jackeens kept calling naeself to annoy, 
There goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy, 
Till I 
flourished my sprig of Ehillalah, 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly, 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, before long to this country I 
came, 
An' found Paddy Miles here was the same; 
If my name wasn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad luck to the master could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made, sir, 
An' if you want to get a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my soul then you need not be afraid, sir, 
For to hire me, I'm not Paddy Miles. 
Dublin Bay. 
THEY sailed away in a 
gallant bark, 
Roy Neal and his fair young bride ; 
And ventured out in that bounding bark, 
To ride on the silvery tide. 
Roy Neal he clasped his fair young bride, 
As he kissed the tears away; 
And they watched the shore recede from sight, 
As they left sweet Dublin Bay. 
16 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
They had sailed three days when a 
storm arose, 
The lightning flasli'd the deep, 
The thunders crash'd and broke the short repose 
Of the weary seaboy's sleep. 
Roy Neal he clasped his weeping bride, 
As he wiped the tears away, 
Oh, love, she cried, 'twas a 
fatal hour 
That we left sweet Dublin Bay! 
On the crowded deck of that doom'd ship, 
Some stood with mute despair, 
While others more calm, with a 
holy lip, 
Sought the God of storm in prayer. 
She has struck a 
rock ! the seaman cries, 
In a 
breath of wild dismay; 
And the ship went down with the fair young bride, 
That had left sweet Dublin Bay. 
Paddy's Dream. 
IN 
London one night, about three in the morning, 
In my bed wide awake fast asleep in a 
doze, 
In a 
loud fit of yawning I 
fell to a- laughing, 
For love and good living disturbed my repose. 
Thinks Ito myself: 
just sleep a 
bit longer, 
Alone to enjoy this beautiful scene ; 
With eyes wide open I 
slept until mornin9., 
When I 
found it all nothing but only a 
dream! 
Spoken.—Oeh, such a 
vision! 
There was I 
up to my 
elbows in illegant pastry, up to my eyes in liquor, and 
over my ears in love, whispering soft nonsense to Molly 
Asthore, and singing: 
Pal lah Inc. ful lah hue, whack fal de riddle, 
Sing ful lab hue, fal lab me, whack ful de ray, 
With my sprig of shillalah I'll sing to your fiddle, 
To a 
small drop of whiskey I'll never say nay. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
17 
I 
dreamed while at home a 
courting sweet Molly, 
I 
was eating minced pies in a 
pastry cook's sliop; 
And with love and good liquor was getting so jolly, 
Had you seen me, I'm sure you'd have long'd for a 
drop. 
Such dishes I'd swear ne'er grew in Kilkenny, 
Or before touched the 
lips 
of 
poor Paudeen 
M'Phane; 
Arrah! troth, could I 
dream the same, night, noon, 
and morning, 
I'd never go back to Kilkenny again. 
Spoken.—Och, such a 
dream! 
It's only delusion, says 
Molly. 
It was illegant eating and drinking, says I. 
Only let me dream such delusions always, waking and 
sleeping, and I'll sing— 
Fu ru lu philaloo, whack fol de riddle, 
Sing wrishtrew, hubaboo, whack fal de ray, 
With my bit of shillalah, Pll dance to the fiddle, 
To a 
drop of good whiskey I'd never say nay. 
Next night to my bed I 
went soon in the morning, 
In hopes such another sweet dream to obtain, 
When, zounds! you'll believe me, I 
dreamed that old 
Wackem 
Was bringing me back to Kilkenny again. 
So I 
laid me stock still, both trembling and shaking, 
My hair stiff as pitchforks stuck out of my head ; 
Till the daylight appearing, I 
bade him good morn-
ing, 
And swore he'd ne'er catch me afore he was dead. 
Spoken.—The first wink of day brought back my 
courage, so I 
bawls, giving a 
flourish of the alpeen, only 
make yourself invisible to my eyes now, and see how 
18 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
soon I'll measure you for a new wig. 
Ah, faith! 
I'll 
lend you such a 
Philaloo wrishtrew, whack fol de riddle, 
Hubahoo, claraboo, now fire away! 
With my sprig of shillalah, 
crack your old 
noddle; 
To be waked from such dreaming, the devil, I 
say! 
The Bold Shoemaker. 
I 
Am a 
bold republican, James Irving is my name, 
And to my sad misfortune I 
listed in the train. 
My usage being so severe, with me did not agree' 
That was the time, my brave boys, I 
thought on liberty. 
I 
being drunk when I 
enlisted, not knowing of the same, 
Until my youthful sensesreturned to me again, 
To see those colors flying, the tears did fall from me, 
That was the second time, boys, I 
thought on liberty. 
Then we march'd to Tipperary, with courage stout and bold, 
Where my unworthy officers unkindly me contrord; 
To exerci:e on Sunday, with me did not agree, 
That was the third time, my brave boys, I 
thought on liberty. 
I 
had a 
loving sweetheart, Jane Wilson was her name, 
. 
And it griev'd her to the very heart, to see me in the train; 
She told rnd if I 
would desert, to quickly let her know, 
And she'd dress me in her clothes, that where I 
pleas'd might go. 
Then I 
marched to Colerain, and being weary on the way, 
I 
stept into a 
small barn, and laid down on some hay; 
0, I 
had not very long laid there till I 
arose again, 
And lcoking all around me, I 
spied five of the train. 
0, we had a 
bloody combat, 'tis true I 
beat them all, 
I 
made those cowardly rascals for mercy loudly call; 
Saying, spare our lives, bold Irvin, and we will pray for thee, 
And we will swear by all that's fair, you fought for liberty. 
Go home, you cowardly dogs, said I, since nothing else you 
crave, 
Go home and tell your officers that with them I 
won't stay, 
Go home, and tell your soldiers, likewise your sergeants three, 
That my name is James Irving, and I'll have my liberty. 
Then I 
march'd to sweet Colerain, and weary it made me, 
0, there I 
worked a 
full half year, at my shoemaking trade; 
But a 
Carrick fair being so near, I 
long'd my friends to see, 
It's ten to one, my brave boys, but I'll lose my liberty. 
There was John Brown, of Carrick town, a 
man both poor and 
mean, 
For the sake of forty shillings he had me false taken; 
They put me in a 
guard house, my sorrows to deplore, 
There were four at every window, and as many at the door. 
'Twas early the next morning, I 
walked my guard room round, 
And jumped out of a 
window, and knocked four of them down! 
Both light-horse and trainsmen, they all did follow me, 
But my friends did receive me, and I 
kept my liberty. 
Now I 
am a 
bold republican, James Irving is my name, 
I 
can whip as many Orangemen as will stand up in a 
train! 
I 
can whip as many Orangemen as will stand in a 
row, 
And will make them fly before me like an arrow from a 
bow. 
Molly Asthore. 
As down by Banna's banks I 
strayed, 
One evening in May, 
The little bird's, in blythest notes, 
Made vocal ev'ry spray; 
They sung their little notes of love, 
They sung them o'er and o'er, 
Ah! gramachree, my cholleenoge, 
My Molly Asthore ! 
The daisy pied and all the sweets 
The dawn of Nature yields— 
The primrose pale, and yi'let blue, 
Lay scattered o'er the fields ; 
Such fragrance in the bosom lies 
Of her whom I 
adore. 
Ah! gramachree, & c. 
I 
laid me down upon a 
bank, 
Bewailing my sad fate, 
• - .--••• • • • •• • • 
20 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
That doomed me thus the slave of love, 
And cruel Molly's hate; 
How can she break the honest heart 
That wears her in its core ? 
Alt! graroachree, & c. 
You said you loved me, Molly dear! 
Ali I 
why did I 
believe ? 
Yet who could think such tender words 
Were meant but to deceive ? 
That love was all I 
asked on earth— 
Nay Heaven could give no more. 
Ah! gramaehree, &c. 
Oh! had I 
all the flocks that graze 
On yonder yellow hill; 
Or lowed for me the numerous herds 
That yon green pasture fill— 
With her I 
love I'd gladly share 
My kine and fleecy store. 
Ah! gramachree, &c. 
Two turtle-doves, above my head, 
Sat courting on a 
bough, 
I 
envied them their happiness, 
To see them bill and coo; 
Such fondness once for me was shown, 
But now, alas ! 'tis o'er. 
! 
gramachree, &c. 
Then fare thee, well, my Molly dear! 
Thy loss I 
e'er shall mourn, 
Whilst life remains in Strephon's heart, 
'Twill beat for thee alone; 
Though thou art false, may Heaven on thee 
Its choicest blessings pour. 
Ah! gratnachree, dtc. 
Teddy Regan Songster.

The Handsome Cabin Boy. 
IT 
is of a 
pretty female, as you shall understand, 
She had a 
mind for roving into some foreign land; 
Attired in sailor's clothing, this fair maid did appear, 
And engaged with a 
captain to serve him for a 
year. 
She engaged with the captain his cabin boy to be, 
The wind it being favorable they soon put out to sea; 
The captain's lady being on board, who seemed to enjoy 
The favorable appearance of the handsome cabin boy. 
So nimble was the cabin boy and done his duty well, 
But mark what followed after, the thing itself will tell: 
The captain with this pretty maid would often kiss and 
toy, 
And he soon found the secret of the handsome cabin boy. 
Her cheeks were like roses, and with her side locks curl'd, 
The sailors often strill'd and said, " she looks just like a 
girl." 
But by eating the captain's biscuit, her color it did de-
stroy, 
And the waist did grow large of this handsome cabin boy. 
As through the Bay of Biscay our gallant ship did plow, 
One night among the sailors there was a 
pretty row; 
They turned from their hammocks, their sleep it did 
destroy, 
And swore about the groaning of the handsome cabin 
boy. 
Oh, doctor! oh, doctor 1 
the cabin boy did cry— 
The sailors swore by all that's good, the cabin boy would 
die. 
The doctor ran with all his might, and laughing at the 
fun, 
To think a 
cabin boy should have a 
daughter or a 
son. 
22 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
The sailors soon found out the joke, and all began to 
stare, 
The child belong'd to none of them they solemnly did 
swear; 
The captain's lady to him said, " My dear, I 
wish you 
j 
oy, 
For either you or I've betrayed the handsome cabin boy." 
Then they all took a 
bumper and drank success to trade, 
Likewise to the cabin boy that's neither man nor maid: 
And if the waves should rise again the sailors to destroy, 
Why, then, we'll ship some sailors like the handsome 
cabin boy. 
Bagged Pat. 
Am: Lather and Shave. 
Now, all you young gents to my song lend your ear; 
'Tis about a 
poor Irishman whose name was Pat Clere : 
His clothes were all patches, and torn was his hat, 
That they called him the name of Poor Ragged Pat. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, boy, paddy awhack! 
A 
cat won't catch mice if put in a 
sack. 
On Sunday at church, his coat was of black, 
With a 
big ivory button sewed into its back, 
And his breeches were blue, the cloth very coarse, 
He'd look like a 
clown, if he sat on a 
horse. 
Cnoaus.—Oh, boy, paddy awhack! 
Now, this gent ragged pat, although he was poor, 
Sickness, no matter what sort, he could cure : 
With a 
measure of oats, another of grass, 
He would take away glanders from any jackass. 
CHORUS.— Oh, boy, paddy awhack! &c. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
His eyes, they were black, and his voice was so sweet, 
He stood up for the laws, and on Friday eat meat; 
On the Sabbath at church he'd sure shut his eyes, 
With his big mouth wide open as if catching flies. 
CIIORIIS.— Oh, boy, paddy awhack! & c. 
As you gave close attention, I'll here end my song. 
Although full of pathos, yet not very long: 
In the churchyard of Erin far under the sod, 
Lies poor Ragged Pat, but trustful in God. 
CHORUS.— Oh, boy, paddy awhack! & c. 
Cruis-Kia Lawn. 
LET the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman does his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet-scented lawn, 
While I, more blest than they. 
Spend each happy night and day 
With my smiling little Cruis•kin lawn, lawn, lawn, 
Oh, my smiling little Cruis-kin lawn. 
Leante mina Cruis-kin 
Sleante gar ma voor neer. 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban, ban, ban, 
Agus gramachree ma cooleen ban. 
In court with manly grace, 
Should Sir Toby plade his case, 
And the merits of his cause make known, 
Without his cheerful glass, 
He'd be stupid as an ass, 
So he takes a 
little Cruis-
kin lawn. 
Leante ruma, &c. 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Let's not part with lips so dry, 
Though the lark should proclaim it is dawn, 
But if we can't remain, 
May we shortly meet again, 
My smiling little Cruis-kin lawn. 
Leante ruma, &c. 
24 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
And when grim death appears, 
After few but happy years. 
And tells me my glass it is run, 
I'll say begone, you slave, 
For great Bacchus gives me lave 
Just to fill another Cruis-kin lawn. 
Leante rums, & c. 
Ould Ireland, You're Mly 
Outn Ireland, you're 
My jewel, sure, 
My heart's delight and glory ; 
Till time shall pass 
his empty glass, 
Your name shall live in story. 
And this shall be 
The song for me, 
The first my heart was larnin', 
Before my tongue 
One accent sung: 
Ould Ireland, you're my darlin' 
My blessin's on 
Each manly son 
Of thine who will stand by thee. 
But hang the knave 
And dastard slave 
So base as to deny thee. 
Then bold and free, 
While yet for me 
The globe is ' round us whirlin', 
My song shall be: 
Gm a 
Gramachree, 
Ould Ireland, you're my darlin' ! 
Sweet spot of earth, 
That gave me birth, 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
25 
Deep in my soul I 
cherish, 
While life remains 
Within these veins, 
A 
love that ne'er on perish: 
If it was a 
thing 
That I 
could sing 
Like any thrush or starlin,' 
In cage or tree, 
My song should bd : 
Ould Ireland you're my darlin'! 
Paddy on the Canal. 
W I= I landed in sweet Philadelphia, the weather was pleasant and 
clear, 
I 
did not stay long in the city, so quickly I 
shall let you hear. 
I 
did not stay long in the city, for it happened to be in the fall, 
I 
never reefed a 
sail in my rigging, '
tillI anchored cut on the canal. 
Cnoars. 
So fare you well, father and mother, 
Likewise to old Ireland too, 
So fare you well, sister and brother, 
So kindly I'll bid you adieu. 
When I came to this wonderful rampire, it filled me with the 
greatest surprise, 
To see such a 
great undertaking, on the like I 
never opened my 
eyes. 
To see full a 
thousand brave fellows at work among mountains so 
tall, 
To dig through the vallies so level, through rocks for to cut a 
canal. 
So fare you well, die. 
I 
entered with them for a 
season, my monthly pay for to draw, 
And being in very good humor, I 
often sang Erin go bragh. 
Our provision it was very plenty, to complain we'd no reason at all, 
I 
had money in every pocket, while working upon the canal. 
So fare you well, Am 
I 
learned for to be very handy, to use both the shovel and spade, 
I 
learnt the whole art of canalling, I 
think it an excellent trade. 
26 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
I 
learned to be very handy, although I 
was not very tall, 
I 
could handle the sprig of shillalah, with the beet man on the canal. 
So fare you well, &c. 
I 
being an entire stranger, be sure I 
had not much to say, 
The Boss came round in a 
hurry, says, boys it Ls grog-time a.day. 
We all marched up in good order, he was father now unto us all, 
Sure I 
wished myself from that moment to be working upon the 
canal. 
So fare you well, & c. 
When at night we all rest from our labor, be sure but our rent is all 
paid, 
We laid down our pick and our shovel, likewise our axe and our 
spade; 
We all set a 
joking together, there was nothing our minds to 
enthral, 
If happiness be in this wide world, I 
am sure it is on the canal. 
So fare you well, &c. 
The Wonderful Irishman. 
THERE was a 
lady lived at Leith, 
A 
lady very stylish, man, 
And yet in spite of her teeth, 
She fell in love with an Irishman— 
A 
nasty, ugly Irishman, 
A 
wild, tremendous Irishman— 
A 
tearing, swearing, thumping, bumping, ramping, roar-
ing Irishman. 
His face was no ways beautiful, 
For with small-pox 'twas scarred across, 
And the shoulders of the ugly dog 
Were almost double a 
yard across. 
0 
the lump of an Irishman, 
The whiskey-devouring Irishman— 
The great he rogue, with his wonderful brogue, the 
fighting, rioting Iiishman. 
One of his eyes was bottle-green, 
And the other was out, my dear, 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
27 
And the calves of his wicked-looking legs 
Were more than two feet across, my dear. 
0 
the great big Irishman; 
The rattling, battling Irishman— 
The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering, leather-
ing, awash of an Irishman. 
He took so mAch of Lundy foot 
That he used to snort and snuffle, 0, 
And in shape and size the fellow's neck 
Was as bad as the neck of a 
buffalo. 
0 
the horrible Irishman, 
The thundering, blundering Irishman— 
The slashing, 
dashing, smashing, lashing, thrashing, 
hashinIrishman. • 
His name was a 
terrible name indeed, 
Being Timothy Thady .Mulligan ; 
And whenever lie emptied his tumbler of punch, 
He'd not rest till he filled it full again. 
The boozing. bruising Irishman— 
The whisky, frisky, rummy, gummy, brandy, no-dandy 
Irishman. 
This was the lad the lady loved, 
Like all the girls of quality. 
And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith, 
Just by way of jollity; 
0 
the leathering Irishman, 
The barbarous, savage Irishman— 
The hearts of the maids and the gentlemen's heads, were 
bothered, I'm sure, by this Irishman.

The Lass of Gowrie. 
'Twas on a 
simmer's afternoon, 
A 
wee before the sun gade down s 
My lassie wi' a 
braw new gown 
Came o'er the hill to Gowrie. 
The rosebud ting'd wi' morning show'r 
Bloom'd fresh within the punnie bow'r, 
But Kitty was the fairest flow'r 
That ever bloom'd in Gowrie. 
I 
had nae thought to do her wrang, 
But round her waist my arms I 
fiang, 
And said, " My lassie, will ye gang 
To view the Carse o' Gowrie 2" 
I'll take ye to my father's ha' 
In yon green field beside the sham, 
And make ye lady o' them a'— 
The brawest wife in Gowrie! 
Soft kisses on her lips I 
laid, 
The blush upon her cheek soon spread, 
She whisper'd modestly, and said: 
" 
I'll gang wie ye to Gowrie !" 
The auld folks soon gade their consent, 
And to Mess John we quickly went, 
Wha tied us to our hearts' content, 
And now she's Lady Gowrie! 
Poor Black Bess. I 
Ant: Poor Dog Tray: 
W HEN fortune, blind goddess, she fled'my abode, 
And friends proved urtgrateful, I 
took to the road, 
To plunder the wealthy to relieve my distress, 
I 
bought thee to aid me, my poor Black Bess. 
No vile whip or spurs did thy sides ever gall, 
For none didst thou need—thou would'st bound at my 
call; 
Ted.dy Regan Songster. 
For each act of kindness thou didst me caress, 
Thou wert never ungrateful, my poor Black Bess. 
When dark sable midnight its mantle had thrown 
O'er the bright face of nature, how oft have we gone 
To fam'd Hounslow heath, tho' an unwelcome guest 
To the minions of fortune, my poor Black Bess. 
How silent thou'st stood when a 
carriage I've stopped, 
And the gold and the jewels its inmates have dropped ; 
No poor man I 
plundered, nor e'er did oppress, 
The widow or orphan, my poor Black Bess. 
When argus-eyed justice did me hotly pursue, 
From London to York like lightning we flew; 
No toll-bars could stop thee, thou the rivers didst breast, 
And in twelve hours reach cut, my poor Black Bess. 
But fate darkens o'er me, despair is my lot, 
The law does pursue me through the cock that I 
shot; 
To save me, poor brute, thou didst do thy best, 
Thou art worn out and weary, my poor Black Bess., 
Hark! the lilood-hounds approach—they never shall have 
A 
beast, like thee, noble, so faithful and brave ; 
Thou must die, my dumb friend, tho' it des me distress, 
There, there, I 
have shot thee, my poor Black Bess! 
And in after ages, when I'm dead and gone, 
This tale will be handed from father to son ; 
My fate some may pity, but all will confess, 
'Twas in kindness I 
killed thee, my poor Black Bess. 
No one can say that ingratitude dwelt 
In the bosom of Turpin, 'twas a 
vice he ne'er felt ; 
I 
shall die like a 
man, and soon be at rest, 
Then farewell for ever, my poor Black Bess.

Larry O'Brien. 
I 
HAVE lately returned from the ocean, 
Where the fire, bind and balls were in motion, 
For at fighting shure I 
nivir tuk a 
notion, 
'Twud nivir do for Larry O'Brien. 
Its I

To see the balls knock out the liver 
Of poor Larry O'Brien.

And they tied i

me up, 
And they commenced a 
hauling, and I

And I

On't poor Larry O'Brien. 
Thin the nixt thing they all got a 
fighting, 
Which was a 
thing I 
nivir tuk delight in, 
Be me sowl you'll swear I

Securing poor Larry O'Brien. 
With their powder and their shot, and their bullets flew

And with their gunning and their funning,

Whin I

Arrah then up pops Larry O'Brien. 
Whin I 
got upon the deck it was there a

Arrah thin musha grah, says I, shure you'd better be in

For there was such fighting, 
'Twas a

But the ship's sides all wanted hailing, 
It was there sieh pumping and sich bailing, 
Oh, it would nivir do for Larry O'Brien. 
Thin they jounced her in the docks, upon their big square 
blocks, 
And she looked for all the world like a

And with their oakum and their kokum, 
And the sailors. divil choke ' em, 
For poor Larry O'Brien. 
Now I'm in with the captains and sailors, 
Likewise with the coopers and the nailers, 
Faith I'll jist go and apply at the tailors, 
To rig out poor Larry O'Brien. 
• 
I've escaped from all wonders and I 
will, its blud an ouns, 
Go show myself to some widdy, with her thirty thousand

I'll adore her, and I'll implore her, 
Be St. Patrick I'll fall on me knees before her 
For poor Larry O'Brien.

The Low Back'd Car. 
W HEN first I 
saw sweet Peggy, 
'Twas on a 
market day, 
A Low Back'd Car she drove, and sat 
Upon a 
tuft of hay. 
But when that hay was blooming grass, 
And deck'd with flowers of spring, 
No flowers were there that could compare 
With the lovely girl I 
sing. 
As she sat in the Low Back'd Car, 
The than at the turnpike bar, 
Good natured old soul, never asked for his toll, 
But looked after the Low Back'd Car. 
In battle's wild commotion, 
The proud and mighty Mars, 
With hostile scythe demands his tythes 
Of death in warlike scars ; 
But Peggy, peaceful goddess, 
Has darts in her bright eye, 
That knock men down in the market town, 
As right and left they fly ; 
As she sits in the Low Back'd Car, the battle more dan-
gerous far, 
For that doctor's art cannot heal the smart, 
That is hit from. the Lqw Back'd Car. 
Sweet Peggy round her car, sirs; 
Has strings of ducks and geese, 
But the scores of hearts she slaughters, 
By far outnumber these; 
While she among her poultry sits, 
Just like a 
turtle dove, 
Well worth a 
cage, I 
do engage, 
With the blooming God of Love. 
As she sits in her Low Back'd Car, the lovers come near 
and far, 
And envy the chickens that Peggy is picking, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
I'd rather own that car, sirs, 
With Peggy by my aide, 
Than a 
coach and four, and gold galore, 
With a 
lady for my bride; 
For the lady would sit fornist me, 
On a 
cushion made with taste, 
While Peggy would sit beside me, 
With my arm around her waist. 
As we roae in that Low Back'd Car, to be married by 
Father Magar, 
Oh, my heart would beat high, at each glance of her eye, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car. 
Kathleen Illavourneen. 
KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN the gray dawn is breaking, 
The horn of the hunter is heard on the hill, 
The lark from her light wing the bright dew. is 
shaking, 
Kathleen Mavourneen, what. slumb'ring still ? 
Ah! hast thou forgotten how soon we must sever ? 
Oh! hast thou forgotten this day we must part! 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Oh! why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart ? 
It may be for years, and it may be. for ever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen ? 
Kathleen Mavourneen! awake from thy slumbers, 
The blue mountains glow in the sun's golden light, 
Ah! where is the spell that once hung on my num-
bers, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night. 
Mavourneen, Mavourneen, my sad tears are falling, 
To think that from Erin and thee I 
must part, 
34 
Teddy Regan Songster: 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Then why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart ? 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen ? 
County Jail. 
GOOD people all, give ear I 
pray, 
And hark ye all to what I 
say; 
To my misfortunes, great and small, 
Come listen, and I'll tell you all; 
I 
used to lead a 
glorious life, 
Devoid of care, devoid of strife; 
Could go to bed and fall asleep, 
No ugly visions around me creep— 
But, oh! the toots and Cupid guards, 
They nearly drove me ramping mad, 
Tliey piped into a 
railroad mail, 
And carried me off to the County Jail I 
And when we got to the end of the route, 
The turnkey turned my pockets out, 
To see if I 
had gut such stuff • 
As money, grub, tobacco, or snuff; 
They took me in to try my size, 
The color of hair, the color of eyes— 
They measured me from root to lip, 
To see if I 
had but one top lip; 
Then straightway to the yard did go, 
And ordered me a 
suit of clothes. 
The kyds came out and did me hail: 
" 
Another new cove for County Jail!" 
Then one of them with a 
roguish leer, 
Says, " My jolly old cove, what brought you 
here ?" 
What do you think brought me out, 
What brought me here but your railroad route ? 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
35 
Then they gathered around like so many fools, 
And each one talked about the rules, 
That each new corner should sing a 
song, 
Or tell a 
tale—God knows how long— 
Or they'd break his wind and give him a 
whack, 
Or they'd take him down to Black Jack, 
From there they wollop him, tooth and nail, 
With an old wet towel from County Jail 
As I 
walked out and strolled the yard, 
Thinking my case was wond'rous hard, 
All at once I 
heard a 
din, 
The deputy warden shouts, " All in ;" 
Then lumbering down the yard we go, 
Like beasts let out of a 
wild beast show— 
Some cracked in mind, and some in wind, 
And others with a 
crack behind; 
Then one by one we march around the tub, 
To get our county allowance of grub, 
Which blew our ribs out like a 
sail, 
With a 
skilly and whack from County Jail! 
At five o'clock one of them said : 
" 
It is nearly time to go to bed ;" 
The truth from him I 
found did creep, 
For all turned in and went to sleep. 
The turnkey bawled as stiff as starch: 
" 
Right about face, and then quick march !" 
We did, and all made such a 
rush, 
Like monkeys marching around a 
bush. 
Such clanking of clogs, such shaking of knees, 
Such crouking of bellys and clanking of keys, 
Such damning beds as hard as a 
nail, 
They'd starve a 
poor devil in County Jail! 
At six next morning up we got, 
Each man was called to clean his pot, 
Then through the yard we did lurch, 
All fell in line to go to church ; 
„ 
36 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
And there were such dresses as met my view, 
One arm was red, the other was blue— 
One leg was yellow, the other was gray, 
And then the parson began to pray. 
He said that Elijah went up in a 
cloud, 
And Lazarus walked about in his shroud; 
And that Jonah he lived inside of a 
whale, 
A 
damned sight better than County Jail ! 
Service being over, we all got back, 
And fell in line for skilly and whack; 
We crushed like pigs all in a 
lump— 
At iliac each took his hand at pump. 
At ten we raised a 
glorious mill, 
And smathered each other with right good will! 
At eleven we raised it and quit the house, 
And all fell in line for pans of skouse. 
Then if there's a 
man, no matter how droll, 
We pop him into Pompie's hole, 
Where whack and water-cocks his tail, 
There's glorious times in County Jail! 
The Irish Jaunting Car. 
MY 
name is Larry Doolan, I'm a 
native of the soil, 
If you want a 
day's diversion, I'll drive you out in style, 
My car is painted red and green, and on the door a 
star, 
And the pride of Dublin City is my Irish jaunting car. 
CHORUS. 
Then, if you want to hire me, step into Mickey Mar's, 
And ask for Larry Doolan and his Irish jaunting cars. 
When Queen Victoria came to Ireland her health to re-
vive, 
She asked the Lord Lieutenant to take her out to ride; 
She replied unto his greatness, before they travelled far, 
How delightful was the jogging of the Irish jaunting car. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
37 
I'm hired by drunken men, tetotalers, and my friends, 
But a 
carman has so much to do, his duty never ends; 
Night and day,'both wet and dry, I 
travel near and far,. 
And at night I 
count the earnings of my Irish jaunting car. 
Some say the Russian bear is tough, and I 
believe it's true. 
Though we beat them at the Alma and Balaklava, too, 
But if our Connaught Rangers would bring home the 
Russian Czar, 
I 
would drive them off to blazes in my Irish jaunting 
car. 
Some say all wars are over, and I 
hope to God they are, 
For you know full well they never were good for a 
jaunt-
ing car. 
But peace and plenty—may they reign here, both near ' 
and far, 
Then we'll drive to feasts and festivals in an Irish jaunt-
ing car. 
They say they are in want of men, the French and Eng-
lish, too. 
And it's all about their commerce now they don't know 
what to do; 
But if they come to reland our jolly sons to mar, 
I'll drive them to the devil in my Irish jaunting Car.

Hatty Avourneen. 
'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the tempest was snarlin,' 
The snow like a 
sheet covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to his darlin', 
And tapped at the window where Ratty did lie. 
" 
Arrah, jewel," said he, " are ye sleepin' or wakin', 
The night's bitter cold, an' my Nat it is thin, 
Oh, the storm 'tis a 
brewin', the frost it is bakin', 
Oh, Katty Avourneen, you must let me in."

" 
Arrah, Barney," cried she, and she spoke thro' the 
window, 
" 
Ali, would ye be taken me out of my bed, 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too, 
It's whiskey, not love, that's got into your head. 
If your heart it was .true, of my fame you'd he tender, 
Consider the time, an' there is nobody in, 
Oh, what has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her ? 
No, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in," 
" 
Ah, cuishla," cried he, " it's my heart is a 
fountain 
That weeps for the wrong I

Your name is more white than the snow on the naoun-
tain, • 
And Barney would die to preserve it as pure. 
I'll go to my home, though the winter winds face me, 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within, 
An' the words of my Kathleen will comfort and bless me, 
' 
Oh, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in.'" 
Paddy O'Lynn. 
ONE Paddy O'Lynn courted Widd/ M'Kay, 
He bold as a 
lion, she fresh as the—olay ; 
Now to win her, he knew he the widdy must plase. 
So he thought the best thing he could do was to taze. 
" 
Now Paddy be aisy, you devil," she'd cry, 
And she'd smack Paddy's chops, while she'd look at 
him sly: 
" 
Lave your tricks and your nonsense, and mind your 
affairs, 
Through your tickling I 
know I'll be tumbling up 
stairs!" 
"My honey," says Paddy, " that, some folks do say, 
Is a 
sign that you'll semi know your own wedding day; 
And it's pissed that I 
am—sure to say so's no sin, 
Since ' tis all for good luck," says Paddy O'Lynn. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
" 
Arrah, now !" says she, " Pat, don't think of the like, 
For I 
didn't say no to your fat cousin Mike, 
The sole of my shoe he loves, though it arn't whole." 
Says Paddy," I'd rather love you than your soul." 
" 
Now, Paddy, I'll squeal, and I'll punch your fool's 
• head— 
Sure I'm dreaming each night, I've your cousin in bed ;" 
Says Paddy, " That same I 
am glad that you say, 
For drames always go quite the contrary way; 
So, Widdy, kape draming that same till you die, 
When you drame Mike's in bed, why, you'll find it is I; 
And it's plased that I 
am, sure to say so's no sin, 
For 'tis all for good luck," says sly Paddy O'Lynn. 
" 
Arrah ! Widdy, my darling, you've plagued me enough, 
And sure, then, 'tis time that you left off such stuff; 
For your sake I've been fighting, and broken my head, 
And think after this, it is time we were wed." 
Then Paddy so sly, threw his arms around her waist, 
And his lips -put to her's, of their sweetness to taste ; 
And he looked in her eyes that were sparkling so bright, 
And he hugg'd her swate form—faith, then, sure he did 
right. 
" 
Now, Paddy, be quiet, to take you I'm loath, 
Sure, I've now had two husbands, and done for them 
both." 
" 
Then have me for the third, and p'rhaps this time I'll 
win, 
For the third time is different," says Paddy O'Lynn. 
Digging for Gould. 
DARBY KELLY below, in Kilkenny did live, 
A 
sketch of whose character I'm going to give, 
He was thought by the people a 
green polished rogue; 
He could wastle the whiskey, or wastle old brogue, 
All kinds of diseases with herbs he could cure, 
He'd interpret your dreams, to be certain and sure. 
40 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
By the boys of the village he was often fool'd, 
For, aslape or awake, he was dreaming of gould, 
Fal de dol, de dol. 
Ile had a 
fine open house, but the winder; were broke; 
The gables were down to let out the smoke. 
Some beautiful pigs, through the wild world to range, 
Though they were thin, they were thick with the mange. 
He was so neglectful of domestic affairs, 
The rats eat the bottoms all out of his chairs ; 
And the wife by the husband was so overrule, 
When she axed him for coppers, he was talking of gould. 
Fal de dol, & c. 
The house thus neglected, sure nothing went right, 
When a 
youth of the village came to him one night; 
A 
nice boy he was, his name was Dan Mac, 
And ready to fly with the duds on his back; 
All the clothes that he had wasn't enough 
To make him a 
bolster to stick on a 
crutch. 
And his juvenile days in a 
lime-kiln were schooled, 
But he used to cod Darby about finding gould. 
Fal de dol, &c. 
Says Dan, " Ere last night I 
had a 
beautiful dream, 
But, bad luck to the doubt, last night I'd the same, 
And to-day, as I 
dozed,. after slacking some lime, 
I 
dreamt it again for the third and last time." 
" 
Och, murder," says Darby, " come tell us your dream," 
Same time his two eyes like buckets did gleam. 
Says Dan, " I 
dreamt at the castle Kilcool 
I 
found a 
jar that was cramm'd full of gould." 
Fal de 'dol, & c. 
Poor Darby's big mouth opened like a 
dead Haicke, 
Saying, " You'll be a 
hero just like your namesake. • 
You'll ride in your coach, you fortunate elf, 
" 
While I 
may be in one going down to the hulks. 
No matter," said Darby, " we must emigrate, 
So come down at midnight, and don't be too late ; 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
Bring some boys whose courage won't easy be cooled, 
And we'll dig till daylight to find all the gould." 
Fal de dol, &c. 
They arrived at the castle about one o'clock, 
Where Dan dreamt he found all the gould in a 
croak. 
They all set to work with picks, shovels, and spadts, 
And a 
hole, that would swallow a 
house, soon was made. 
Says Darby, " Bad luck to the curse we must give, 
Or we'll be beggars -as long as we live." 
Say Dan, " May the devil on my back be stooled, 
For I 
have bursted my breeches in digging for gould." 
Fal de dol, 
The prayers availed nothing, the crock was soon found, 
Tim Rooney, he lifted it over the ground. 
With joy Darby leaped on the back of Ned Flail, 
Like a 
fish from the stream with a 
hook in his tail. 
Says Darby, " My wife won't abuse rite to-night, 
When I 
take home the shiners so yellow and bright; 
I'll buy a. house and land about Kilcool, 
And we'll all bless the night we went digging for gould." 
Fal de dol, &c. 
The crock was then placed on Darby's own back 
To carry home, and each man have his wack. 
They arrived at the door, with the gould to be sacked, 
When Mac, with a 
spade, knocked the crock into smash; 
Poor Darby, near smothered, ran in with a 
fright, 
his wife jumps up to get him a 
light, 
When she heard Darby mourning, her passion was 
cooled, 
She knew by the smell he was covered with gould. 
Fol de dol, & c. 
MY 
love, still I 
think that I 
see her once more, 
But alas! she has left me her loss to deplore, 
My own little Kathleen, my poor lost Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
Her hair glossy black, her eyes were dark blue, 
Her color still changing, her smiles ever new : 
So pretty was Kathleen, my sweet little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
She milk-ea the dun cow that ne'er offered to stir, 
Though wicked it was, it was gentle to her; 
So kind was my Kathleen, my poor little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
She sat by the door one cold afternoon, 
To hear the, wind blow, and look at the moon, 
So pensive was Kathleen, my poor little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
0 
cold was the night breeze that sighed round her 
bower,-
It chill'd my poor Kathleen, she drooped from that 
hour, 
And I 
lost my poor Kathleen, my dear little 
Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
The bird of all birds that I 
love the best, 
Is the robin that in the church-yard builds its nest, 
For he seems to watch Kathleen, hops lightly on 
Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore.

johnny Eloyle 
I 
Am a 
fair maiden, all tangled in love, 
My case I 
will make known to the great God above; 
I 
thought it a 
credit, yet I 
fear it a 
crime 
For to roam the world all over for you, Johnny Doyle. 
It was Saturday evening we made up the plan, 
It was early Monday morning to take a 
trip along; 
My waiting-maid was standing by, as you can plainly see, 
She slipped in unto my mamma, and told upon me. 
My mamma she conducted me into a 
bed-room high, 
Where she knew no one could hear me nor pity my cry; 
She bundled up my clothes, and she bid me begone, 
For she knew well in her heart, that I 
lyved that young man. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
A 
horse and side saddlepy father did provide, 
In hopes to get me married, and be young Somers' bride; 
A 
horse and side saddle my father did prepare, 
With six noble footmen to wait on me there. 
45 
So we rode all along till we came to Belfast town, 
Our horses being stabled and footmen seated down; 
While they were at their merriment, 
I 
had my own toil, for my heart it lie at home with my young 
Johnny Doyle. 
By my eldest brother I 
was conducted home, 
My mamma she conducted me into my own bedroom; 
My own bed being the softest, my head I 
did lie down, 
For to seek consoling sorrow, my body it was found. 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers in, 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers in; 
For to-night is the night that he means t ) enstrive, 
But he'll never gain the girl that is intended for his bride. 
When she saw the minister coming in the door, 
her ear-rings, they bursted and fell upon the floor; 
The gold ring on her finger, in a 
hundred pieces did fly, 
And her stomages, it bursted, and death was drawing nigh. 
I 
will send for Johnny Doyle for you, my own darling child, 
I 
will send for Johnny Doyle far you, my own heart's delight; 
Yes, you'll send for Johnny Doyle, mamma, but I 
fear it is too late, 
For death, it is coming, and sad is my fate. 
Now death, you are coming; you are welcome to me, 
From the pains of love, I'm sure, you'll BE t 
me free ; 
There is more trouble on my mind than my poor tongue can tell, 
And these are my dying words: Johnny Doyle, fare you well. 
The day of her funeral, it was a 
great sight. 
There were four-and-twenty fair maidens, all dressed in white; 
They carried her to St. Mary's ground, and laid her in the clay, 
Saying: The Lord, He may be with you forever and a 
day. 
Erin's Lovely Home. 
Wilms I 
was young and in my prime, my age just twenty-one, 
I 
acted as a 
servant unto a 
gentleman; 
I 
served him true and honest, and very well it's known, 
But in cruelty he banished me from Erin's Lovely Home. 
For what he did banish me I 
mean to let you hear, 
I 
own I 
loved his daughter, and fhe loved me as dear. 
She had a 
large fortune, and rich a 
I 
ha!ffnone, 
And that's the reason I 
mast go from Erin's Lovely Hobe. 
'Twas in her father's garden, all in the month of June, 
We 
were viewing of those flowers in all their youthful bloom ; 
She said, " My dearest William, if with me you will roam, 
We'll bid adieu to all our friends, In Erin's Lovely Home." 
I 
gave consent that very night along with her to roam, 
Frani her fatlia.'s dwelling— it proved my overthrow; 
The night was bright; by the moonlight we both set off alone, 
Thinking to get safe away from Erin's Lovely Home. 
When we came to Belfast, by the break of day, 
My love eh e 
then get ready our passage fa to pay, 
Five thousand pounds she counted down, saying, " This shall be 
your own, 
But do not mourn for those we've left in Erin's Lovely Home." 
'Tis of our sad misfortin I 
mean to let you hear, 
'Twas in a 
few hours after, her father did appear, 
He marchA me back to homer jail, in the county of Tyrone, 
And there I 
was transported from Erin's Lovely Home. 
When I 
heard my sentence it grieved my heart full sore, 
But parting from my true-love it grieved me ten times more. 
I 
had seven links upon my chains, for every link a 
year, 
Before I 
can return again to the arms of my 
dear. 
While I 
lay under sentence, before I 
sailed away, 
My love she came into the jail, and thus to me did say: 
" 
Cheer up your heart, don't be dismayed, for I'll not you disown, 
Until you do return again to Erin's Lovely Home. 
Erin is my Home. 
On, I 
have'roamed in many lands, 
And many friends I've met; 
Not one fair scene or kindly smile, 
Can this fond heart forget ; 
But 111 confess that I'm content, 
No more I 
wish to roam; 
Oh, steer my bark for Erin's Isle— 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer m 
y 
bark, &c. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
If England were my place of birth, 
I'd love her tranquil shore ; 
But if Columbia were my home, 
Her freedom I'd adore. 
Tho' pleasant days in both I 
passed, 
I 
dream of days to come; 
Oh, steer my bark for Erin's Isle— 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, (tc. 
The Harp that Once Thro' Tara's Halls. 
THE harp that once through Tara's halls 
The soul of Music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls, 
As if that soul were fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So'glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise,. 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The cord alone, that breaks at night. 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now but seldom wakes ; 
The only throb she gives 
Is when some heart indignant breaks, 
To show that she still lives. 
Teddy O'Neale. 
I'VE come to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
And eonsid'ring it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most elegant clean. 
'But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad and all silent, no piper, no reel; 
Not even the sun, through the casement, is cheery, 
Since I.missed the dear &tiling boy, Teddy O'Neale. 
I 
dreamt but last night--oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought ' twould come truly to pass— 
But I 
dreamt, while tears down my pillow were stream-
ing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass; 
Oh! didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing, 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal; 
My mother cried—" Norah, child, what is your ailing ?" 
And all I 
could utter was—" Teddy O'Neale." 
Shall I 
never forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment was come when my love must 
depart; 
How I 
sobbed, like a spalpeen, " Good-by to you 
Teddy," 
With drops on my cheek and a 
stone at my heart. 
He says 'tis to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own darling, Teddy O'Neale. 
The Exile of Erin. 
THERE came to the beach a 
poor exile of Erin, 
The dew on his robe was heavy and chill; 
For his country he sighed, when, at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion, 
For it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
'Where once, in the flow of his youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold anthem of Erin go bragh, 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
" 
0, sad is my fate," said the heart-broken stranger, 
" 
The wild deer and wolf to a 
covert can flee, 
But I 
have no refuge from famine or danger, 
A 
home and a 
country remains not for me! 
Ah! never again, in the green shady bower, 
Where my forefathers lived, shall I 
spend the sweet 
hours, 
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike the sweet numbers of Erin go bragh! 
" 
Oh, Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken, 
In dreams I 
revisit thy sea-beaten shore ; 
But alas! in a 
far foreign land I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more 
And thou, cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me 
In a 
mansion of peace, where no perils can chase me ? 
Ah! never again shall my brothers embrace me! 
Tliey died to defend me, or lived to deplore. 
" 
Where now is my cabin- door, so fast by the wild-wood ? 
Sisters and sires did weep for its fall. 
Where is the mother that looked on my childood ? 
And where is my bosom friend—dearer than all ? 
Ah! my sad soul, long abandoned by pleasure! 
Why did it doat on a 
fast fading treasure? 
Tears, like the rain, may fall without measure, 
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall. 
" 
But yet all its fond recollection suppressing, 
One dying wish my fond bosom shall draw; 
Erin ! an exile bequeaths thee his blessing, 
Land of my forefathers, Erin go bragh! 
Buried and cold, when my heart stills its motion, 
Green be thy fields, sweetest isle in the ocean, 
And the harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion, 
Erin ma vourneen! sweet Erin go bragh!'"

The Green Linnet. 
Cur:rosin, 
bore a 
young native of Erin 
To view the gay banks of the Rhine ; 
When an empress he saw, and the robe she was wearing 
All over with diamonds did shine; 
A 
goddess in splendor was never yet seen, 
To equal this fair one so mild and serene, 
In soft murmur she says, " My sweet linnet so green, 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more 2" 
The cold lofty Alps you freely went over, 
Which Nature had placed in your way, 
That Marengo, Saloney, around you did hover, 
And Paris did rejoice the next day. 
It grieves me the hardships you did undergo, 
Over mountains you travelled all covered with snow, 
The balance of power your courage laid low. 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more? 
The crowned heads of Europe, when you were in 
splendor, 
Fain would they have you submit, 
But the Goddess of Freedom soon bid them surrender, 
And lowered the standard to your wit; 
Old Frederick's colors in France you did bring, 
Yet his offspring found shelter under your wing ; 
That year in Virginia you sweetly did sing, 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
That numbers of men are eager to slay you, 
Their malice you viewed with a 
smile ; 
Their gold through all Europe they sowed to betray 
you, 
And they joined the Mamelukes on the Nile. 
Like ravens for blood their vile passions did burn, 
The orphans they slew, and caused the widows to 
mourn, 
They say my linnet's gone, and ne'er will return. 
Is he gone—will I 
never see him more ? 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
51 
When the trumpet of war the grand blast was sound-
ing, 
You marched to the north with good will, 
To relieve the poor slaves in their vile sack clothing, 
You used your exertions and skill. 
You spread out the wings of your envied train, 
While tyrants great Cicsar's old nest set in flames, 
Their own subjects they caused to eat herbs on the 
plains. 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
In great Waterloo, where numbers laid sprawling, 
In every field, high or low, 
Fame on her trumpet thro' Frenchmen was calling, 
Fresh laurels to place on her brow. 
Usurpers did tremble to hear the loud call, 
The third old Babe's new buildings did fall, 
The Spaniards their fleet in the harbor did call. 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
I'll roam thro' the deserts of,wild Abyssinia, 
And yet find no cure for my pain; 
Will I 
go and inquire in the Isle of St. Helena ? 
No, we will whisper in vain. 
Tell roe, yoticritics, now tell me in time, 
The nation I 
will range my sweet linnet to find, 
Was he slain at Waterloo, on Elba, on the Rhine ? 
If he was, I 
will never see him more. 
Doran's Ass. 
ONE Paddy Doyle lived in Killarney, 
He courted a 
girl named Biddy Tool; 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of blarney, 
The same to Paddy was a 
golden rule. 
Both day and dawn she was his colleen; 
When to himself he'd often say, 
52 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
What need I 
care, when she's my drolleen, 
A 
coming to meet me on the way ? 
Whack fol de darrall ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal in. 
One heavenly night in last November, 
Paddy went out to meet his love ; 
What night it was I 
don't remember, 
But the moon shone brightly from above. 
That day the boy bad got some liquor, 
Which made his spirits light and gay ; 
Arrah! what's the use of walking quicker, 
When I know she'll meet me on the way ? 
Whack fol de darral ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal in. 
He tuned his pipes and fell a 
bumming, 
As gently onward he did jog; 
But Iittigne and whiskey overcame him, 
So Paddy lay down upon the sod. 
He was not long without a 
comrade, 
One that could kick up the bay; 
For a 
big jackass soon smelt out Paddy, 
And lay down beside him on the way. 
Whack fol de darral ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal la. 
As Pat lay there in gentle slumbers, 
Thinking of his Biddy dear; 
He dream't of pleasures without numbers, 
A 
coming on the ensuing year. 
He spread his arms out on the grass, 
his spirits felt so light and gay, 
But instead of Biddy be gripped the ass, 
Roaring out, I 
have her anyway. 
Whack fol de darral ido. 
Whack fol de darral lal in. 
He hugged and smugged his hairy messer, 
And flung his hat to worldly care; 
Teddy Regan. Songster. 
Says Pat, she's mine, and may heaven bless her, 
But oh, be my soul! she's like a 
bear. 
He put his hand on the Donkey's nose, 
With that the Ass began to bray; 
Pat jumped up and roared out: 
Who sarved me in such a 
way ? 
Whack fol de darral ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal la. 
Pat ran home as fast as he could, 
At railway speed, or as fast, I 
am sure; 
He never stopped a 
leg or foot, 
Until he came to Biddy's door. 
By that time, 'twas getting morning; 
Down on his knees he fell to pray, 
Crying: Let me in my Biddy darling, 
Pm kilt, I'm murdered on the way. 
Whack fol de darral ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal in. 
He told her his story mighty civil, 
While she prepared a 
whiskey glass; 
How he hugged and smugged the hairy divil. 
Go long, says she, 'twas Doran's Ass! 
I 
know it was, my biddy darling. 
They both got married the very next day; 
But he never got back his old striw but, 
That the jackass ate up on the way.

When everything was there, both jaunting cars and gambols;

All driving off, ding-dong, to go and see the races.

spied a

The band struck up a

There were fiddlers playing jigs, there were lads and lasses dan-

And chaps upon their nags round the course sure they were pranc-

Some were drinking whiskey-punch, while others bawl'd out gaily, 
" 
Hurrah then for the shamrock green, and the splinter of china-

You'll breakdown the three-legged stool.

Of his ghost all in white— 
Oh, mother, he's going away! 
Mothen—If he's goin' away, all the betther— 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort—you can't get a

For yez neither can read or can write. 
Sure ' twas only last week you protested, 
Since he courted fat Jenny M'Cray, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested— 
With abuse, sure, your tongue never rested— 
Daughter.—But, mother—

The Fine Old Irish Gentleman-
I'LL sing you a 
decent song that was made by a 
Paddy's pate, 
Of a 
real ould Irish gintleman who had a 
fine est,t, 
Whose mansion it was made oimud, with thatch and all complate, 
With a 
hole at top, through which the smoke so graceful did re-
trate, 
hurrah for the ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. 
His walls so cold, were cover'd w 
id the devil a 
thing for show, 
Except an ould shillalah, which had knocked down many a 
foe, 
And there ould Barney sat at ease, without shoes or ho- e, 
And quaff'd his noggin of potteen to warm his big red nose, 
Like a 
fine ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. 
To Donnybrook his custom was to go to every fair, 
And though he'd seen a 
few score years, he still was young when 
there, 
And while the rich they feasted him, he still, among the poor 
Would sing, and dance, and burl, and fight, and make the spa!-
peens roar, 
Like a 
raal mild Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. 
But och mavrone! once at a 
row ould Barney got a 
knock, 
And one that kilt him, 'cause he couldn't get o'er th3 shock ; 
They laid him out so beautiful, and then set up a 
groan, 
Och! Barney, darlint, jewel dear, why did you die ? och, hone 
Then they waked this Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden 
time. 
Though all things in their course must change, and seasons pass 
away, 
Yet Irish hearts of oulden time werejust as at this day. 
Each Irish boy, he took a 
pride to prove himself a 
man, 
To serve a 
friend and bate a 
foe, it always was the plan 
Of a 
raal ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time.

The Girl 
Left Behind Me. 
I'm lonesome since I 
cross'd the hills 
And o'er the moor that's sedgy; 
With heavy thoughts my mind is fill'd, 
Since I 
have parted Peggy. 
Whene'er I 
turn to view the place, 
The tears doth fall and blind me, 
When I 
think on the charming grace 
Of the girl I 
left behind me. 
The hours I 
remember well, 
When next to see doth move me, 
The burning flames my heart doth tell, 
Since first she own'd she lov'd me. 
In search of some one fair and gay, 
Several doth remind me; 
I 
know my darling loves me well, 
Though I 
left her behind me. 
The bees shall lavish, make no shore, 
And the dove become a 
ranger; 
The fallen water cease to roar, 
Before I'll ever change her. 
Each mutual promise faithfully made 
By her whom tears doth blind me, 
And bless the hours I 
pass away 
With the girl I 
left behind me.• 
My mind her image full retains, 
Whether asleep or awaken'd; 
I 
hope to see my jewel again, 
For her my heart is breaking. 
But if ever I 
chance to go that way, 
And that she has not resign'd me, 
I'll reconcile my mind and stay 
With the girl I 
left behind me. 
Molly flaws'. 
0, MOLLY Bawn, why leave, me pining, 
Or lonely waiting here for you— 
While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they have nothing else to do. 
The flowers late were open keeping, 
To try a 
rival blush with you, 
But their mother, Nature, kept them sleeping, 
With their rosy faces wash'd in dew. 
0, Molly, k,c. 
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, dear, 
And the pretty,stars were made to shine ; 
The pretty girls were made for the boys, dear, 
And may be you were made for mine. 
The wicked watch dog here is snarling— 
He takes me for a 
thief, d'ye see ? 
For he knows l'd steal you, Molly, darling, 
And then transported I 
should be.

As beauteous as Flora is charming young Norah,

To find that I 
sighed for another less fair.

blossom so fair,

Irish Molly, 0 
As I 
walk'd out one morning, all In the month of May, 
I

pretty Irish girl, and thus to her did say, 
I 
put my hand into my pocket, as it happened so, 
And pulled out a 
guinea to treat my Molly, 0.

She is young, she is beautiful, she is the fairest one I 
know, 
The primrose of Ireland, before my guinea go, 
And the only one tint entices me is my Irish Molly, 0. 
I 
said, my pretty fair maid, will you go along with me, 
I 
will show you the straight way across the country: 
My parents would be angry, if they should come to know, 
They will lay all the blame on my Scotch laddie, 0. 
She is young, &c. 
When Molly's own father he came to know 
That she had been courted by a 
Scotch laddie, 0, 
He sent for young M'Donald, and these words to him did say, 
If you court my daughter Mary I 
will send you far away. 
She is young, &c. 
Since Molly has deceived me, all by her father's ways, 
Through some lone woods and valleys it's there I'll spend my 
days, 
Like some poor forlorn pilgrim I'll wander to and fro, 
It is all for the sake of my Irish Molly, 0. 
She is young, &c. 
There is a 
rose in Dublin, I 
thought she would be mine, 
For to come to my funeral is all I 
do require 
My body shall be ready by the dawning of the day, 
It is all for the sake of my bonny Irish maid.

When that I 
am buried there is one thing more I 
crave, 
To lay a 
marble tomb-stone at the head of my grave, 
And on this tomb-stone a 
prayer shall be said, 
That young M'Donald lies here for his young Irish maid. 
She is young, dm. 
Come all you pretty fair maids a 
warning take by me, 
And never build a 
nest at the top of any tree ; 
For the green leaves will wither and the root it will decay, 
And the beauty of a 
fair maid will soon fade away. 
She is young, &c. 
Lament of the Irish Emigrant. 
I'm sitting on the style, Mary, 
Where we sat side by side, 
On a 
bright May morning long ago, 
When first you were my bride; 
The corn was springing fresh and green, 
And the lark sang loud and high, 
And the red was on thy lip Mary, 
And the love light in your eye. 
The place is little changed, Mary, 
The day is bright as then ; 
The lark's loud song is in my ear, 
And the corn is green again! 
But I 
miss the soft clasp of your hand, 
And your breath warm on my cheek, 
And I 
still keep list'ning for the words 
You never more may speak. 
'Tis but a 
step down yonder lane, 
And the little church stands near— 
The church where we were wed, Mary, 
I 
see the spire from here; 
But the grave- yard lies between, Mary, 
And my step might break your rest, 
For I've laid you, darling, down to sleep, 
With your baby on your breast. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
61 
I'm very lonely now, Mary, 
For the poor make no new friends, 
But, 0 ! they love thee better far, 
The few our Father sends; 
And you were all I 
had, Mary, 
My blessing and my pride; 
There's nothing left to care for now, 
• 
Since my poor Mary died. 
I'm bidding you a 
long farewell, 
My Mary, kind and true, 
But I'll not forget you, darling, 
In the land I'm going to ; 
They say there's bread and work for all, 
And the sun shines always there, 
But Iii not forget old Ireland, 
Were it fifty times as fair. 
And often in those grand old woods, 
l'ilit and shut my eyes, 
And my heart will travel back again, 
To the place where Mary lies; 
And I'll think I 
see the little stile 
Where we sat side by side, 
And the springing corn, and bright May morn, 
When first you were my bride.

The Dear Irish Boy. 
Mr Connor's cheeks are as ruddy as morn, 
The brightest of pearls but mimic his teeth ; 
While nature with ringlets his mild brow adorn, 
His hair Cupid's bowstrings, and roses his breath. 
CHORUS. 
Smiling, beguiling, cheering, endearing, 
Together oft o'er the mountain we've strayed, 
By each other delighted, and fondly united, 
I've listened all day to my dear Irish boy. 
6 
No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, 
No Briton bolder ' midst danger or scar; 
He's sightly, he's lightly, hers as clear as the fountain, 
his eyes twinkle love, and he's gone to the war. 
Smiling, & e. 
The soft tuning lark its notes shall cease to mourning. 
The dull screaming owl shall cease its night sleep; 
'While seeking lone walks in the shades of the evening, 
If my Connor returns not, I'll ne'er cease to weep. 
Smiling, &c. 
The war is all over, and my love is not returning, 
I 
fear that some envious plot has been laid, 
Or some cruel goddess has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here a 
dear Irish maid. 
Smiling, & c. 
Nell Flaugherty's Drake. 
MY 
name is Nell, right candid I 
tell, 
And I 
live near a 
cool hill I 
never will deny, 
I 
had a 
large drake the truth for to spake, 
My grandfather left me when going to die; 
Ile was merry and sound, and would weigh twenty 
pound, 
The universe round would I 
rove for his sake, 
Bad luck to the robber, be he drunken or sober, 
That murdered Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
His neck it was green, and rare to be seen, 
He was fit for a 
queen of the highest degree, 
His body so white, it would you delight, 
He was fat, plump and heavy, and brisk as a 
bee. 
This dear little fellow, his legs they were yellow, 
He could fly like a 
swallow, or swim like a 
hake, 
But some wicked habbage, to grease his white cabbage, 
Has murdered Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
63 
May his pig never grunt, may his cat never hunt, 
That a 
ghost may him haunt in the dark of the night, 
May his hens never lay. may his horse never neigh, 
May his goat fly away like an old paper kite, 
May his duck never quack, may his goose be turned 
black, 
And pull down her stack with her long yellow beak, 
May the scurvy and itch never part from the briteh, 
Of the wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his rooster ne'er crow, may his bellows not blow, 
Nor potatoes to grow.—may he never have none,— 
May his cradle not rock, may his chest have no lock, 
May his wife have no frock for to shade her back bone, 
That the bugs and the fleas may this wicked wretch 
tease, 
And a 
piercing north breeze make him tremble or shake, 
May a 
four year's old bug build a 
nest in the lug, 
Of the monster that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his pipe never smoke, may his tea-pot be broke, 
And add to the joke, may his kettle not boil, 
May he he poorly fed till the hour he is dead, 
May he always be fed on lobseouse and fish oil; 
May he swell with the gout till his grinders fall out, 
May he roar, howl and shout with a 
horrid tooth-ache, 
May his temple wear horns and his toes corns, 
The wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his dog yelp and howl with both hunger and cold, 
May his wife always scold till his brains go astray, 
May the curse of each hag that ever carried a 
bag, 
Light down on the wag till his head it turn gray; 
May monkeys still bite him, and mad dogs affright him, 
And every one slight him asleep or awake, 
May wasps ever gnaw him, and jackdaws still claw him, 
The monster that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
But the only good news I 
have to diffuse, 
Is of PeterHughes and Paddy IleCade, 
64 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
And crooked Ned Manson, and big nose Bob Hanson, 
Each one had a 
grandson of my beautiful drake. 
Oh, my bird he has dozens of nephews and cousins, 
And one I 
must have, or my heart it will break, 
To keep my mind easy, or else I'll run crazy,

And so ends the song of my beautiful drake.

Tim Finigan's Wake. 
TIM Finigan lived in Walker street, 
A 
gentleman Irishman—mighty odd— 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet, 
And to rise in the world he carried the hod; 
But you see he'd a 
sort of a 
tipling way: 
With a 
love for the liquor poor Tim was born, 
And to help him through his work each day, 
He'd a 
drop of the creatur' every morn'. 
CHORUS: Whack, hurrah, blood and 'ounds, ye Bowl ye, 
Welt the flure, ye're trotters shake, 
Isn't it the truth I've tould ye, 
Lots of fun at Finigan's wake. 
One morning Tim was rather full, 
His head felt heavy, which made him shake, 
He fell from the ladder and broke his skull, 
So they carried him home his corpse to wake ; 
They rolled him up in a 
nice clean sheet, 
And laid him out upon the bed, 
With fourteen candles round his feet, 
And a 
couple of dozen around his head. 
Whack, hurrah, & e. 
His friends assembled at his wake, 
Missus Finigan called out for the lunch; 
First they laid in tay and cake, 
Then pipes and tobacky, and whiskey punch.

Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry, 
It 
Such a 
purty corps did ever you see: 
Arrah! Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die ? 
—Och, none of your gab, sez Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah, & c. 
Then Peggy O'Connor took uP the job, 
—Arrah, Bithly, says she, ye're wrong I'm shure. 
But Judy then gave her a 
belt on the gob, 
And left her sprawling on the flure. 
Each side in the war did soon engage, 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man; 
Shillalah law was all the rage, 
An' a 
bloody ruption soon began. 
Whack, hurrah, &c. 
Mickey Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey flew at him, 
It missed him— and hopping on the bed, 
The liquor scattered over Tim ! 
Bedad! he revives! see how he raises ! 
An' Timothy jumping from the bed, 
Cries, while he lathered around like blazus, 
—Bad luck till yer souls, d'ye think I'm dead ! 
Whack, hurrah, d:c.

Old Leather Breeches. 
AT 
the sign of the Bell, on the road to Clonmell, 
Paddy Flagherty kept a 
nate shehecn, 
He sold pigs, meat and bread, and had a 
fine lodging 
bed, 
And so well liked round had been him. 
Himself and his wife, they struggled through life— 
On week days Pat mended the ditches, 
But on Sunday he dressed in a 
coat of,the best, 
But his pride was in his old Leather Breeches.

Teddy Regan Songster. 
For twenty-one years, or so it appears, 
His father these breeches had ran in, 
The night that he died, to his bedside 
Called Paddy his beautiful son in. 
The advice that he gave, ere he went to his grave, 
Was for him to take care of his riches; 
Says he, " Its no use to walk in my shoes, 
But I 
pray you step into my breeches." 
Last winter's snow laid provisions low, 
That Paddy was ate out completely, 
And the snow coming down, he could not get to town 
So the hunger bothered him greatly. 
One night as he lay dreaming away, 
Of big dogs, frogs and witches, 
He heard an uproar just outside of his door, 
And he up for to pull on his breeches. 
Says Brian M'Gurk, with the voice of a 
Turk, 
" 
Now Paddy, come get us some eating," 
Says big Andy Moore, " I'll burst open the door, 
For this is no night to be waiting." 
Just as they spoke, the door went in broke, 
They crowded around Paddy like leeches, 
They swore by the magog, that if he did not get them 
grog, 
That, they would eat him right out of his breeches. 
Paddy in dread slipped into bed, 
That held Judy his own darlin' wife in, 
Where he quickly agreed for to get'them a 
feed, 
And he out and brought a 
big knife in. 
He took up the waist of his breeches, tin beast, 
And he cut out the buttons and stitches, 
Then cut them in stripes, by the way they were 
Tripes, 
And he boiled them, his Old Leather Breeches. 
Teddy Regan Songster.

When the breeches were stewed, on a 
dish they were 
strewed, 
The boys all cried out--Lord-be-thanked! 
But Flaglierty's wife, in dread for her life, 
She thought it high time for to shank it ; 
The boys they all smiled, for they thought Pat had 
boiled 
Some mutton or beef of the richest, 
But little they knew it was Leather Burgoo, 
Made of Paddy's old worn-out breeches. 
They wallopped the stuff; says Darby, " It's tough." 
Says Pat, " You're no judge of good mutton" 
When Brian MeGurk, on the point of a 
fork, 
Lifted up a 
big _
Ivory button. 
Says Andy, " What's that ? I 
thought it was fat," 
Brian jumps on his legs, and he screeches, 
" 
By the powers above. I'm striving to shove 
My teeth through the flap of his breeches." 
They all made at Pat, he was gone out of that, 
For he ran when he saw them all rising, 
Says Darby, " Make haste, and go for the Priest, 
13y the holy Jack- straws I'm poisoned." 
In revenge for the joke, they up and they broke 
All the chairs, tables, and dishes ; 
And ever since that night, they'll knock out your 
daylights, 
If they catch you with the Old Leather Breeches.

Maginnis's Raffle. 
W ON Saturday night we'd a 
bit of a 
fight, 
I 
was dressed in me best so genteely, 
While for company sake, in me fist did I 
take 
Me ould country blackthorn shillaly. 
Going through Cherry street, there who should I 
meet 
But me ould countryman, Larry McG 
affil, 
Arrah, Mickey, siz he, " will yer take, d'ye see, 
A 
ticket to go to a 
raffle ? 
Be me soukins I 
swear all the boys will be there, 
Wid fat Mrs. Byrnes an' her daughter, 
The purpose, ' tis true, is for charity, too, 
Take a 
ticket—it's only a 
quarter. 
70 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
The prize, you must know, is a 
fiddle an' bow, 
'Twas presented to Misther Tim Whetle, 
The chairman is he iv the grand committee 
On Mickey Maginnis's raffle. 
Siz I, " Larry. begor, will you tell me who it's for, 
Nor me mind with wild fancies bewildher," 
" 'Tis to bring out," siz he, " from the ould counthr 
Widdy Doyle an' her fourteen small childher; 
Her husband, the sot, at sheepstaling was caught, 
He'd a 
narrow escape from the scaffold, 
But was situ ' cross-the sea, out to Bottiny Bay, 
An' for his widdy we've got up this raffle." 
The quarter I 
spint, and with Larry I 
wint, 
To Oak street we travelled from Cherry, 
At aitche shebeen we'd stop to take a 
small dhrop, 
Be the time we got there we wor merry. 
As the dure we passed thro', what a 
sight met me view, 
All me powers of description %would baffle, 
In all sorts of dress, full three hundred or less 
Wor at Mickey Maginnis's raffle. 
The factions enraged were in battle engaged, 
An' the blood soon began to flow freely, 
But the whole iv the crew couldn't lather us two, 
That's meself an' me blackthorn shillaly ; 
Me stick got excited, it wanted to fight, it 
Longed to take part in the battle, 
It hit Shaughnessy's Ted such a 
belt on the head 
That it knocked him stone blind at the raffle. 
Darling Old Stick. 
My name is Morgan McCarthy, from Trim! 
My relations are all dead except one, brother Jim— 
,And he's now gone soulgering to Cape Hull, 
And I 
expect he's laid low with a 
nick in his skull ! 
CHORUS. 
Let him be dead or alivin', 
A 
prayer for his soul shall be given, 
That he shall be sent home or to heaven, 
For he left me this Darling Old Stick! 
If this stick it could spice, it would tell you some 
tales, 
And batter the countenances of the O'Nales ! 
It has caused bits o' skull to fly up in the air; 
It was the promotion of fun at every fair. 
The last time I 
used it ' twas on Patrick's Day, 
Larry Fagan and I 
jumped into a 
shay; 
We went to a 
fair at the side of Athloy, 
Where we danced, and when done, kissed Kate Mc-
Alvoy! 
And her sweetheart went out for her cousin ; 
By the powers he brought in a 
dozen. 
What a 
daldum they'd have knocked us in, 
If I 
hadn't ' ave had this Darling Old Stick! 
War! was the word when a 
faction came in, 
For they pummelled me well—they stripped off to the 
skin! 
Like a 
rector I 
stood, watching the attack, 
And the first one came up I 
knocked on his back! 
Then I 
poked out the eye of Pat Glancy, 
Per he once humbugged my sister Nancy! 
In the meantime Miss Kate took a 
fancy 
To me and my innocent Stick! 
72 
Teddy Regan Songster. 
I 
smothered her sweetheart until he was black, 
Kate tipped me the wink, we were off in a 
thwack! 
We went to a 
house at the end of town, 
Where we kept up our spirits by pouring some down. 
When the whiskey began for to 'warm 
I 
got her snug up in a 
corner; 
She said her sweetheart would inform on her! 
'Twas there I 
said praise to my Stick! 
Kate she drank whiskey to such a 
degree 
That for her support she had to lean upon me; 
I 
said I 
would see her safe to her abode, 
'Twas there we fell in the middle of the road. 
Until roused by the magistrate's orders, 
Devil a 
toe could we go farther, 
Surrounded by police for murder, 
Was myself and my innocent Stick. 
When I 
was acquitted I 
jumped from the dock, 
An' all the gay fellows around me did flock, 
They gave me a 
sore arm, they shook my hand so 
often, 
It was only for fear of seeing my own coffin I 
I 
went and I 
bought a 
gold ring, sirs, 
Miss Kate to the Priest I 
did bring, sirs— 
That night we did joyfully sing, sirs, 
The adventures of myself and my Stick!
