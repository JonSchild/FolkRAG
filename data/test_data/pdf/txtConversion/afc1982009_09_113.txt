Identification 
The entire sequence of slides documenting tobacco packing cover the 
following: Slate gets a stick of tobacco from where several cfmicS 
^hcm are hangin^in^The curing barn. The tobacco has been sewn to the 
sticks on a sewing machine using heavy string. Mrs. Slate carries the 
stick of tobacco outside to the work area, then removes the heavy string, 
thereby freeing the leaves. She throws the stick into a pile of other 
sticks, which will be used again the following year. She sorts through 
the leaves and divides them according to quality. A large sheet of 
burlap is then laid on the ground and a cylinder, called a"tobacco packing 
guide" commercially, is set on the burlap. Mrs. Slate puts the tobacco 
leaves inside the cylinder and son Tim stomps on the leaves in order to 
pack them firmly. (The stems of the tobacco are pointed inward.) When 
the cylinder is full, the cylinder is removed and the tobacco stands 
-1 one on the burlap. Mrs. Slate and Tim wrap the tobacco in the burlap, 
T~l-'-i—I li vHi-] ~i—h fur -n'~Ttl

ken to be sold. (When Mrs. Slate is removing the string from the stick 
of tobacco she first cuts it with a little pair of scissors, then yanks 
the string off.)

After lunch workers return to the curing barn and gX&pQfXHg prepare 
to string the tobacco leaves picked that morning onto wooden sticks. 
Stringing is done in a work area near the curing barn and underneath 
a canvas roof. The leaves are unloaded from the wagon onto a metal 
conveyor belt. Sallie Hall Slate and Lisa Dawn Moorefield arrange 
«the leaves XHXX side by side in a long row, with stems pointing

They place a wooden stick over the stems, then lay another 
row of tobacco leaves over the stick in the same fashion as the other 
leaves. This stick is then ready to be "strung" and is sent down the 
line to Margie Moorefield, who sews the leaves to the stick using a 
special sewing machine and heavy string. When the "stringing" is completed, 
several of the men carry them into the curing barn and hang them there, 
where they will dry.
