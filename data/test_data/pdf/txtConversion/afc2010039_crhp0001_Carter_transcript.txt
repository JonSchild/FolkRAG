INTERVIEWER:  Say your name, where 
00:00:12 
were you born, when. 
 
JUDGE ROBERT LEE CARTER:  I was born 
in Caryville, Florida.  My name is 
Robert, middle initial L for Lee and 
Carter.  I think the name Robert is a 
name that's common, I don't think I 
have to spell that.  Lee is L-E-E and 
Carter is a common name, that's 
spelled C-A-R-T-E-R.  So I think I 
have a common name that’s not 
00:00:55 
unusual.   
 
INTERVIEWER 2:  Wonderful.  Okay. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I was not, I hope, 
named after the confederate general 
Robert Lee but I may have been at the 
time because I came from the South 
and during that period the southern 
generals and stuff like that were 
considered heroic by black people.  
But I don't know.   
00:02:08 
INTERVIEWER:  Judge Carter, you're a  
 
child of the Great Migration, tell us 
about where and when you born and how

JUDGE CARTER:  I was born in  
00:02:20 
Caryville, Florida.  And when I was 
very young, after my mother birthed 
me, I was part of migration of family 
out of the South to the North in the 
Great Migration.  My family was born 
free, we were—I think maybe it was 60 
years after the Civil War and so we 
were a free black coming out of the 
South in the Great Migration. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  And what year was that? 
00:03:20 
JUDGE CARTER:  What? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What year were you 
born? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I was born in 1917.  
In Caryville I said earlier, in 
Caryville, Florida.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And where did your 
family move to?  Your father was 
already up north. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  My father has—my  
00:03:47 
mother was in Florida birthing me and 
I think that he was or they were part 
of the agricultural family but

because of the war he apparently had 
some charisma or was a man who was  
00:04:22 
just not peon because he has some 
intelligence.  They sent him north 
and he was working in a factory and 
after my mother birthed me she joined 
him and the rest of the family in 
Newark. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Newark, okay.  What are 
you earliest memories about growing 
up in Newark? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  My father died when I  
00:05:03 
was a year old and my mother had no 
special education, she was not an 
ignorant woman she had had some 
schooling but she did not have enough 
schooling to get a job other than 
washing clothes for white people.  
And as she did to keep bread on the 
table for us.  And I lived with her 
by present standards in poverty until 
I was 12.  When I was 12 years old my  
00:06:05 
oldest sister married, she was a 
woman who sewed and made clothes.  
And she married this man who owned a

bar in Linden, New Jersey.  And that 
was sort of like a thing coming out  
00:06:41 
of poverty.  She insisted that he 
remained—that all the family lived 
together and so she lived with him.  
And the family all together enabled 
us to get better housing and every 
time we sort of moved it was to 
improve our living conditions.  After 
I was 12 years old I became for the 
first time, with her marriage, I was 
able to have a bathroom for myself,  
00:07:29 
an indoor and an indoor bath.  Until 
that time I had to use outhouses with 
other people, I remember that with 
such distaste.  And fortunately it 
was sort of—her marrying this man was 
sort of like the period when—you know 
in a white fairytale when this poor 
girl marries this rich man and it was 
similar to that because it opened the 
doors for me to mainstream  
00:08:25 
prerogative, I had never been in 
indoor toilets and stuff like that.  
All of what I learned about the

difference between the poor and the 
rich, for example, is that poor  
00:08:55 
people never or rarely learn what 
they need to know, they live—middle 
class people can live on the streets 
and stuff like that.  But when it 
comes time to—if they need to know 
something, they know where to get it.  
And second thing was when the poor I 
remember is that the poor people act 
out their life on the streets, middle 
class people do the same thing but  
00:09:47 
behind doors.  And they have porches 
and stuff and they do not have to 
live their life on the street.  I saw 
when I was on Boyden which was once 
one of the worst slums in the ghetto 
and it has been rehabilitated or what 
do you call it, it's now—the city of 
Newark has redone Boyden Street, it 
was one of the worst slums and they  
rejuvenated or whatever that you call  
00:10:49 
they're doing.

for education early on inspired you.  
I mean schooling and education, what  
00:11:08 
opened you up to that in the way that 
you went ahead and succeeded so well? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I was not 
skillful with my hands and I knew 
that somehow I was going to find a 
way into the mainstream and get an 
education and find my way there.  And 
what I recognized was the only way I 
could do that was to get an 
education.  I was considered smart  
00:12:01 
and I skipped in school and stuff 
like that.  And that was an advantage 
to me and also I read a lot, 
undisciplined reading but at the same 
time it exposed me to a lot of ideas 
and stuff.  And I knew somehow I had 
to be in the mainstream, find my way 
to the mainstream or else I would not 
survive.  And so I recognized that 
and I spent a lot of time in the  
00:12:52 
library at a public library close by.  
Unfortunately my reading was 
undisciplined, I liked to read novels

and history, historic novels and 
stuff.  And from time to time some  
00:13:22 
real hard disciplined reading I would 
do.  But for the most part it was not 
the kind of hardnosed reading that 
forms a brilliant mind.  But anyway 
any kind of reading helps. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  It helps.  What were 
schools like in Newark and then in 
East Orange? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  What what? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What were the schools  
00:13:52 
like? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  There was Newark High. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Were they integrated? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  No.  When I was in 
Newark until I was 12 years old, 
that's when we were in poverty and 
the people from the South, the 
migrations from the South was from—my 
sisters were at the age of puberty 
and my mother was very worried that  
00:14:34 
they would—that the guys would ask 
them and that they would be 
impregnated early on and she wanted

desperately to get out of there.  And 
when my sister Mammie [phonetic]  
00:14:50 
married this guy had this bar and 
grill, she was able to satisfy that 
because the guys would be on the 
street after my sisters who at that 
time who were, you know, 16 and so 
and she was certain that they might 
be impregnated and stuff and she was 
very worried about that.  And that of 
course showed a double standard 
because I had more freedom.  She was  
00:15:38 
not worried about me impregnating 
anybody which she should have been 
that concerned but she was not.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  When did you become 
aware of race? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I think early on when 
I was in maybe the sixth grade or so,  
we had two girls in the class were 
friends, a black girl and a white 
girl.  And I remember this to this  
00:16:30 
day, the white girl had bangs and you 
know she was—with her hair back, the 
black girl had braids and she

wouldn't tie her hair back but she 
tried to.  They were very close  
00:16:51 
friends.  And at one point the black 
girl and the white girl had an 
argument and the white girl went to 
her teacher and complained.  And the 
teacher had no sympathy for her, she 
told her you should stay with your 
own kind.  And that showed me how 
prejudice affected ourselves.  But 
this was in the Newark school and 
even though this teacher said that to  
00:17:38 
this white girl, had no sympathy for 
her, in Newark the school they sort 
of stayed back and allowed things to 
play out.  Well when I was in East 
Orange school they were adverse to 
any black/white intercourse, they 
didn't like that at all and they 
intervened.  And what that showed me 
is that the very faces of prejudice, 
I'm sure that my teachers in East  
00:18:22 
Orange, now in Newark were as 
concerned about - - maybe as 
prejudice as the teachers in East

Orange were proved to be.  But they 
sit back and let things play out.   
00:18:44 
And so what that showed me is how 
white prejudice has various forms.  
The East Orange people intervened and 
wanted segregation to be imposed, 
they couldn't do it by law anymore 
but they wanted it imposed.  The 
other people, the teachers in Newark, 
were not that—they was concerned I 
guess but they didn't interfere. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  You had very different  
00:19:30 
experience, you write about in your 
book, at Barrington High School where 
you went for two years and then you 
to East Orange High School in your 
third year of high school.  Could you 
talk about—I think a good example 
that you write about, what happened 
around the swimming pool, how it was 
organized, how it changed and what 
your role was in that. 
00:19:51 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I don't know—I 
don't remember what grade I was in 
now.

INTERVIEWER:  It doesn't matter. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  But at one point what 
00:20:12 
would happen in gym classes was that 
we had gym maybe three or four times 
a week and we would play basketball 
or as they would say some 
calisthenics in basketball.  And then 
part of the class for white kids 
would go down to the pool and they 
would swim or learn to swim.  And 
blacks were not allowed to use the 
pool except on alternate weekends  
00:20:58 
when the sexes or the black woman or 
girls would use the pool after the 
class and then the pool was cleaned.  
And on the other weekend the black 
boys would use the pool and then the 
pool was cleaned out.  And there was 
a ruling from the Supreme Court of 
New Jersey that all the facilities 
had to—could not be segregated, that 
all the school facilities had to be  
00:21:48 
opened to all people.  And armed with 
that knowledge I decided I was going 
to use the pool.  I don't know how I

JUDGE CARTER:  I read about it and 
what made it so observed was that I 
couldn't swim and I would have to go—
I would go to the pool every day that  
00:22:50 
was gym class when the white boys 
went down.  Once I went then the 
white boys stayed out of the pool, 
nobody was in the pool but me and I 
couldn't swim, I was scared to death 
even in a few feet of water because I 
didn't know.  And I was in the pool 
alone during the class.  I couldn't 
get any other blacks to join me.  And 
after that semester you know that I

was threatened by the teacher, they 
were going to expel me and stuff and

to not do this, to stay on the floor 
like the others.  But my feeling was  
00:23:55 
that I was entitled to use that pool 
and that it was my right to use it.  
If I had been right at that time, 
even if I couldn't swim was not the 
issue, they would be teaching me to 
swim.  They were teaching white kids 
who couldn't swim, that was the time 
they were taught then to swim.  So it 
was a very stressful time for me.  
And that result was that instead of  
00:24:44 
allowing everybody to use the pool 
and opening it they closed it.  And 
it was a bad feature for the school, 
East Orange because it had one of the 
best swimming teams in the city.  It 
was winning all the tournaments and 
stuff like that.  But it decided that 
instead of opening the pools to 
everybody that it would close it.  
And that showed me the great cost to  
00:25:25 
whites of segregations, they pay a 
price for it.

Lincoln University in Pennsylvania 
when you were 16.  How did you come  
00:25:43 
to go to Lincoln University? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I skipped a lot 
of classes, I was considered very 
bright.  And I was a very good test 
taker.  So I would finish by testing 
before anybody else and leave the 
class.  Now I don't—you know what I 
always considered prayer and like I 
said I can accept that.  But it seems 
to me that that's a gift too, being  
00:26:32 
able to learn to take tests well and 
that does not necessarily mean 
intellectual gift but at the time 
because I was so good at it, I was 
considered intellectually gifted and 
all accept that no point - - now. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What was Lincoln like?  
Lincoln University.

was isolated and off the green path  
00:27:43 
and we spent a lot of time together, 
my friends and I, and played.  While 
I was not interested at that time in 
the hard sciences.  What I was 
interested in was the social sciences

so forth, I'd be looking out wanting 
to be on the campus playing ball and

00:29:42 
INTERVIEWER:  How did your time at 
Lincoln prepare you for Civil Rights 
activism do you think? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  When we were—Lincoln 
was an all male school and its 
professors were former professors 
retired from Princeton.  And the head 
of the - - or whatever he is, of 
Lincoln was a Princeton graduate and 
they never—the Lincoln men at that  
00:30:56 
time very boorish, would get drunk 
and tear things down and so forth.  
And there was no effort to curb this.  
And when we came along we thought 
that this was—they were being 
paternalistic, that the faculty was, 
that they sort of condoned this as a 
way that had to be accepted because 
blacks were not able to control 
themselves.  So my generation the  
00:31:43 
school felt that we should be able to 
control ourselves, we didn't have to 
be breaking up things and stuff like

that and we were young men, 
supposedly educated and so we should  
00:32:12 
not tolerate this boorish behavior 
that was being - - and accepted.  So 
we started agitating for black 
faculty, for more blacks on the 
faculty.  There was only one 
professor, an English black on the 
faculty, all the rest of the people 
were white.  And we again agitated 
for that.  And I think—and we was on 
the debating—I was on the debating  
00:32:56 
team and we had debates with the 
small colleges like Haverford, not 
the Ivy League schools and colleges 
but just below that.  And I think 
what that did for me was to enable me 
to not fear competing with whites.  
That gave me some courage and 
understanding that I could compete 
with white people which was one of 
the problems at that time with the  
00:33:47 
blacks all had because they were 
stereotypes, were worried about being 
able to compete with white people.

did you come to choose to go to 
Howard Law School? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  How did I come— 
 
INTERVIEWER:  From Lincoln you went 
to Howard, what— 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I went to Howard Law 
School on a scholarship.  One of the 
people was recruiting and I had never 
thought I could be a good lawyer  
00:34:47 
because of my voice, I don’t have a 
good voice and I thought a good 
lawyer had to have a big voice and 
you know they claim and stuff.  But I 
found that I didn't have to do that 
to be a decent lawyer.  What you had 
to do was to be able to know the 
facts and to be able to be convincing 
with all the facts and the law.  And 
my idol was William Hastie who was  
00:35:28 
the Dean of Harvard Law School and he 
didn't have a good voice but he was 
very, very smart and knew all the

facts.  And I came to realize that 
when I had a law—a case that what I  
00:35:52 
had to do was know all the facts, be 
convincing with all the facts so that 
I could answer all the questions.  
And that I didn't have to decline.  
That helped me to become aware that I 
could be a good Civil Rights lawyer.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And what was it like to 
be a law student at Howard 
University.  You enrolled in 1937 in 
the fall. 
00:36:28 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well it was—at the 
time Howard was on a special mission.  
Charles Houston had a program that we 
were going to fight segregation, the 
separate but equal does on the Plessy 
versus Ferguson.  And we were going 
to fight it by making all the 
institutions that, state institutions 
that offered courses for whites and 
not for blacks to offer duplicate  
00:37:36 
courses for blacks or establish 
separate schools for blacks.  And we 
knew that they couldn't do that.  And

finally what happened was that as we 
fought to make them offer these  
00:38:03 
separate courses, we realized that 
they could not pay for it and so they 
began to, in the graduate school, 
they began to accept blacks without 
segregation.  Or they would do as 
they did in my first case that I 
argued before the Supreme Court.  The 
separate but equal doctrine, in this 
case McLaurin they tried to provide 
the separate but equal doctrine.   
00:38:51 
McLaurin was in the same class and 
the same faculty, all his segregation 
was that he was required to sit in a 
special seat and he was required to 
use a separate table and he had maybe 
a rope around him but this is was 
considered really separate but equal.  
And this was the beginning of the 
precursor to Brown. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  That's right.  Because  
00:39:54 
you won that case. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Yeah. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  That was in 1950.

held up the separation to provide him

profession.  And that a separate 
school—that's a separation itself to 
provide him of the ability to learn.

were a student there.

Houston.  You mentioned Charles 
Houston and while you were a student 
at Howard he tried the first major 
case that would be part of the cases  
00:40:49 
leading to Brown, the Gaines case.  
And you were there to see that. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Yeah.

INTERVIEWER:  Could you tell that 
story about Moot Court and then going 
to the Supreme Court and watching him 
try that case. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well my first time I 
was in a Supreme Court building I 
heard his argument before the Supreme 
Court in the Gaines case.  This guy 
Missouri ex rel. Gaines was seeking  
00:41:48 
equal educational opportunity and 
they had a school for Gaines on a—
they had the school in Gaines for 
blacks and no school for whites as I 
recall.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So if you want to start 
by the University of Missouri, the 
Gaines case at the Supreme Court. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I think the Gaines 
case was the first argument that I  
00:42:53 
had witnessed in the United States 
Supreme Court.  And there were two 
things about the case as I recall

that became a tradition.  The day 
before the argument we had an  
00:43:21 
argument at the school, the law 
school, and in the course of the 
argument Charles Houston argued the 
case.  One of the Justices asked Mr. 
Houston a question that one of the 
students in the - - were argued 
before us had queried, had asked, and 
that made all the Supreme Court 
arguments brought by the—on the NAACP 
offices and the legal defense fund,  
00:44:16 
those arguments were made to Howard 
Law School the day before they were 
argued by the Supreme Court.  And 
that became a tradition for a long 
time.  And that was—we got a lot of 
run with that and heard people—
Houston and Thurgood and I, we always 
argued these cases the night before 
and that was that. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So how was Houston in  
00:45:06 
the Supreme Court?  What was it like 
seeing Houston argue the Gaines case 
in the Supreme Court and being there?

argument and I'd lose it but— 
 
INTERVIEWER:  [interposing] Yeah, but 
watching Houston argue the Gaines 
case, what happens in that instance? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Houston argued the 
Gaines case and in the course of his 
argument, when the case was called, 
Justice McReynolds turned his back on 
Houston throughout his argument.  And  
00:46:00 
the story goes, it's probably not 
true, that after the case was over 
that Justice McReynolds had his—his 
barber was doing his hair and he said 
that I just heard the nigger Houston 
argue a case in the Supreme Court.  
And so the barber turned to him, this 
is the story, and said that Mr. 
Houston we consider him one of the 
great people and we think he is  
00:46:55 
capable and qualified to sit on the 
Supreme Court.  And if he did we know 
that he would represent all the

guy.  I didn't know him very well.  I

because, or one or two cases, because 
he I think had money problems and he  
00:48:21 
could not stay with the NAACP.  He

00:48:53 
was my icon, I know Houston too well. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  He was your mentor.  
The other big event that happened 
during your years at Howard Law 
School was on Easter Sunday in 1939.  
When you were among the group that— 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  - -. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  And you had a job that 
day to do, you were working in a 
restaurant and you made a decision. 
00:49:22

scholarship to law school but I also 
had a part time job, first as a 
busboy and then as a waiter to make 
some extra money and also to help 
pay—help me - - my school.  And so I 
waited tables.  And the Marian 
Anderson concert, Eleanor—they 
refused to allow her, the Daughters 
of the American Revolution refused to  
00:50:21 
allow her to sing in Constitutional 
Hall.  So Ms. Roosevelt arranged for 
her to sing at the Lincoln Memorial.

going to be a waiter for life and I 
knew that wasn't going to—so I just 
went to the concert and it was 
memorable.  Everybody was half in 
tears and I cried, because I cry 
easily, and she sang beautifully and 
it was historic.  When I got back to 
the hotel the dining room was in 
chaos and so you know I got it  
00:51:53 
straightened out and after the 
evening meal was over I was fired as 
I would have expected to be.  It was

happened after I was fired was that I 
got a full scholarship to the—because 
I work in the library part time and 
so I worked in the library and did my 
lessons and stuff like that and was

JUDGE CARTER:  Well we all knew that 
history was being made and she was in 
great voice and here this black woman 
was at the Lincoln Memorial singing 
how they segregated the Daughters of 
the American Revolution, she had 
desegregated Constitutional Hall.  
And they wanted—kept the segregation

of the Constitutional Hall but after 
that they were out of the picture

that I was working on was the extent 
to which the right to—first amendment

rights were essential for the 
democratic process.  And it got me 
very excited about it and during that 
time when my thesis, when I decided I 
was going to work on this, I had two 
avenues.  I could work fulltime on 
that issue and take a few classes and 
I would be able to get my Doctorate

- -.  I could get my Doctorate after  
00:58:06 
a year's residence and I had five 
years to complete it.  I could 
complete part of my dissertation.  Or 
I could take a whole lot of courses 
and get my Doctorate—my Masters in 
law that way.  The more difficult 
route was to write part of my thesis 
and I was advised by the faculty to 
take the courses that the other way 
was more difficult.  And that annoyed  
00:59:01 
me and so I decided that I was going 
to work on my thesis and try to 
finish it and have it accepted.  And

was one of these technicians who felt

not on the social scene outside the 
court.  And I felt that was nonsense.

him that in arguing before the Court  
01:00:03 
it did sometimes did you good to make 
these little distinctions because the 
Court would find a way to rule for 
you without making an overwhelming 
ruling.  And that I learned although 
my feeling was that the Supreme 
Court's changes followed the vote and 
that political change was reflected 
in the Supreme Court's rulings.  But 
in the process of getting a case, a  
01:01:29 
ruling with a case, it was good to be 
able to argue this little 
distinctions because it helped the

INTERVIEWER:  The next one, when we 
get to World War II and I'll just ask 
you how did World War II impact your 
life.  And that's a good question, 
don't you think?  And start out by 
saying World War II because they're 
not going to have my questions in 
your tape, they're just going to have  
01:02:22

question—

resist the draft you went in at—
describe how you entered the Army/Air 
Force and your involvement on World 
War II, its impact on you.  Just pick  
1:00:24 
up where you were just now.

summer of 1941, you did not resist 
the draft.   
01:00:33 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well at the time I had 
thought that I had gone as far as I 
could go and regarding segregation I 
thought that there was nothing else 
to do.  That I had exhausted all the 
avenues of fighting segregation and I 
was restless and here I was also of 
some age and I didn't feel 
comfortable or that I had anywhere in 
my career, I was worried about what I  
01:01:30 
could do in my career.  And so I 
didn’t resist the draft, I thought 
that if I got in the Army it would 
improve my health and all that sort 
of thing, which it did as a matter of 
fact.  And when World War II broke 
out, Pearl Harbor and so forth, I was 
in the Army.  And it came at a time 
when NAACP was arguing and fighting 
for blacks to become a part of the  
01:02:42 
Army and not be just a servant.  And 
up to that point they had not had 
these black people, there were a few

black units, all black units, but 
they hadn't had all these blacks be  
01:03:10 
integrated into the Army.  And it 
presented a problem to them because 
they hadn't had a core of black men 
trained for anything, they were all 
the long time people who had been in 
the Army were people who were not 
well educated people, they had 
operated as servants to white men, to 
white officers, and then men like 
they were staff sergeants and so  
01:04:05 
forth but these were the only blacks 
who had any standing and experience 
and so these blacks became the people 
that they utilized as to take in and 
train and discipline all these new 
blacks that were coming in.  The 
NAACP and other people were very 
concerned about that and their 
agitation for them to train black 
people, to these black recruits to  
01:04:58 
get opportunities to become officers 
and so forth.  And it was in that 
setting that I became a part of the

was a staff sergeant and what we did

we were clearing trees and cutting

knew I wasn’t going to—that that 
wasn't for me.  So I wasn’t a lawyer 
at the time, I had a lot of legal  
01:06:09 
education but I hadn't passed the 
bar, that didn't mean anything.  The

of these black recruits in Augusta

time Army man.  He had a couple of 
wives, had all kinds of problems and 
so I became his lawyer and I

I was given—I was not in the

office as his advisor on various

Hayes.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Well I think the detail 
is interesting but really what's so 
important is how your experience in 
the Army set you on the course of 
your life as a civil rights lawyer.  
I mean the kind of racism you 
experienced, you just said before off 
tape that it was devastating.

01:08:11 
the time that I was not going to 
spend my time cleaning brush and that 
sort of stuff that I had to find out 
where I was at.  And so I became this 
man's personal lawyer and represented 
him.  And after the agitation of the 
blacks for the open Army to—so for 
black recruits to be able to become 
officers and so forth that agitation 
opened a way for me to get to officer  
01:09:11 
candidate school.  And I became a 
member of the Quartermaster Corps.  
And the Army was then as I recall

wouldn't salute and so forth.  And I  
01:11:14 
brought an action against several of 
them, against them for not treating 
me with respect.  That was one 
incident.  I think there were three 
incidents that occurred during that 
period of time that made the base 
officer accuse me of trying to riot, 
of causing a riot, me alone.  And my 
theory was that at that point—now I'm 
getting ahead of myself.  I was no

longer enlisted what I'm talking 
about now.  I'd gone to officer

course of—I was on the base and they 
offered me the right to live off the 
base and I said I had no right to 
live off the base, I wasn't married, 
I had no intention and I was not  
01:13:26 
entitled to live off the base.  And

officer on another grade and you're 
supposed to acknowledge that or  
01:16:44 
something like that.  And I said, 
"You may be my senior officer by many 
grades but what you have to do is 
learn some manners and when you learn 
some manners I will be able to 
respect you but in the mean time get 
the hell out of my room."  And he was 
furious.  And the next day I saw him 
in the latrine washing up and he had 
on his shorts and he was naked except  
01:17:29 
for his shorts and I reported him his 
exposed body when he saw me he got 
red as a beat.  And he could have 
court marshaled me or tried to but I

he had been discourteous and that was 
my time in the Army.

enlisted men because they didn't show 
me any respect and the officer, the  
01:19:01 
base commander, was handing the 
business that he was from—and so 
forth but you know things were 
changing time.  And I couldn’t 
revolutionize things right then and

trying to revolutionize things but I 
thought that as an officer I was 
entitled to respect.  And I intended 
to get it or I was going to go fight  
01:19:48

course were there.  And I went up to 
the bar to ask for a drink.  The  
01:20:52 
bartender was a black man and looked 
as frightened as I felt because I had 
to walk what felt like a gauntlet.  
And I ordered a drink and he said he 
didn't know whether he could serve 
me.  I said well why, I'm an officer, 
why can't you serve me.  He said 
blah-blah-blah.  And so he finally 
said that okay and poured me this 
drink.  But then I couldn't pay in  
01:21:37 
cash, there were chips that I had to 
have and he couldn't accept the cash.  
One of the other white officers 
standing by told him to put it on his 
bill.  I thanked him and I finished 
my drink.  And that ordeal was so 
devastating that I never tried it 
again, it was just too much for me.  
I should have gone back but once was 
enough.

of the Army and what you did with  
01:22:30 
your career?  How did the Army change 
you, how did it draw you to the 
NAACP? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Before I went into the 
Army I was at Columbia and I had 
these friends and so forth and I 
almost had the feeling that 
segregation and discrimination were 
not really issues because I had all 
these friends around and we were  
01:23:28 
friendly together and did things 
together.  And that if you worked 
hard and so forth that you could beat 
the system and so forth.  And 
fortunately for my well being I went 
into the Army and the hatred against 
black soldiers was so vicious and 
prevalent that it was good, it opened 
my eyes that I realized that 
segregation was a real thing and that  
01:24:19 
you had to fight it.  That was a good 
lesson for me because I really had 
almost come to the conclusion that

discrimination, if you worked hard 
and so forth you could live in this  
01:24:44 
country without discrimination 
bothering you.  And then I became to 
understand as I went into the Army 
that being uneducated you were 
discriminated against, being educated 
didn't save you from the viciousness 
of discrimination.  And that was a 
very, very good lesson for me.  And 
when I came out of the Army I was 
determined to fight segregation and  
01:25:29 
to devote my life to that and that 
has been my motivation for the rest 
of my life.  The amazing thing though 
is that now the Army and the Air 
Force are institutions in this 
country that are more nearly 
acceptance of diversity and equal 
opportunity than any other 
institutions in the country.  And 
that's the amazing thing how that  
01:26:26 
institution has changed.  The Air 
Force and the Army are now places 
where blacks are as able to get equal

INTERVIEWER:  Well let's get you in 
the NAACP.  The next part is how you 
get into the NAACP, you come out of 
the Army in 1944, how do you end up 
working in the NAACP?  And you come 
out with this commitment. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I came out of the Army 
and I really was a very country 
bumpkin and I knew nothing about the 
NAACP's tradition.  I hadn't heard of  
01:28:10 
Thurgood, I hadn't heard of Hastie, I 
was from East Orange and the NAACP 
and Roy Wilkins and those people, I 
never heard—I had never heard of 
them.  When I came out of the Army, I 
guess because I was—I had gotten into 
trouble in the Army because I refused 
to accept segregation and I was 
fighting segregation and talking 
about it.  And some of the Army, I  
01:29:46 
got in bad, bad with the Army 
officials because they took me on to 
be a snitch.  I was supposed to

trouble makers and the thing that was  
01:30:16 
so amusing was when they found out 
that I wasn't—you know I had a 
liberal newspaper delivered to me and 
so—but somehow I wasn't going to be

INTERVIEWER:  Well we've already did 
the Army stuff.  You come out and you 
reconnect with William Hastie, wasn't 
that what happened?  You reconnected 
with William Hastie when you came out 
of the Army? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  What about - - 
 
INTERVIEWER:  You reconnected with 
William Hastie when you came out of 
the Army.  But that's not so  
01:31:41 
important, we don't have to do that.  
I mean you went to work for the NAACP 
in 1944.

JUDGE CARTER:  When I was discharged 
from the Army in '44, Bill Hastie was 
the Dean of Howard Law School and he 
told Thurgood to start to recruit me 
because he thought I would be good on 
his staff.  And I went on his staff 
and then I got drafted. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Again. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  And I had trouble with  
01:33:16 
the Army—I told you all this. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  We don't need to go 
over this again.  And when I settled 
my problems with the Army I followed 
Hastie's advice and sought—even 
though I was now free, I had my 
honorable discharge and I was free of 
the whole thing, I followed his 
advice and saw the war wasn't over  
01:34:14 
and sought to rejoin the Army in some 
capacity.  And I was turned down by 
the as then general, with thanks but

INTERVIEWER:  So what happened, 
you're hired and what were you hired 
to do? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  What? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What were you hired to 
do at the NAACP? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I was hired at the 
time when the NAACP at Howard 
University was on a special program.   
01:36:09 
And that program we were designing 
cases to desegregate state 
institutions.  And the issue was for

us to train a cavalry of black 
lawyers that would go into  
01:36:43 
institutions, back to their home town 
and fight discrimination.  Bring 
cases and so forth and so on on 
discrimination.  And that was the 
program that Howard University 
carried on for some time.  At first 
the whole purpose of the program was 
to find state institutions that—in 
the separate but equal doctrine and 
Plessy versus Ferguson that offered  
01:37:39 
gains or goods or services or 
education for whites and not for 
blacks.  And these lawyers under 
Houston's program were to bring 
litigation to force white 
institutions to either set up 
programs and accept blacks or be 
faced with litigation.  And that 
continued for quite awhile. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What your relationship  
01:38:32 
with Thurgood Marshall because at 
this time he was heading it up, 
Houston had gone back to Washington.

INTERVIEWER:  1944. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  My first contact with 
Thurgood was I was on his staff and I 
was sort of given a—because I had all 
this education, I was given a little 
cubby hole for myself.  And what I 
was supposed to be I guess, the 
domestic guru.  And the rest of the 
staff was in a bigger room and I had 
this little cubby hole to myself.   
01:40:05 
And at one point we had to get a 
briefing—we were on a case, the 
separate but equal doctrine in 
Gaines, I think it was in Gaines.  We 
were on a case—no, yeah.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  No, Gaines was 1938. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  I was to write a 
brief, no.  We had to get this brief 
in and—which case was that.  Thurgood 
was out to lunch and I was told by  
01:41:40 
his secretary to do this brief and I 
was very reluctant to do it because I 
thought that I shouldn't be

that time on I began to be the guy

briefs, but you also traveled a lot

in every state in the South.

01:43:39 
at that time they were public 
theater.  The first case, like 
teacher salary case, Constance Motley 
and I tried to try that case.  This 
was the first time they had seen a 
black woman lawyer in Mississippi.  
And the people were ecstatic because 
we were putting the superintendent on 
the hot seat and they were reenacting 
our courtroom drama as we explored  
01:44:51 
with these people under cross-
examination, put them on the hot seat 
and everything like that.  And they 
would reenact all this stuff in the 
barbershops and stuff with us.  
Constance Motley was the first black 
woman lawyer in Mississippi to argue 
a case.  And now of course I'm sure 
that black woman are common place, 
are arguing cases in Mississippi and  
01:45:36 
every place else.  But she was the 
first black woman they had seen and 
they were just amazed that this black

INTERVIEWER:  So people would crowd 
into the courtrooms, African 
Americans would pack the courtrooms 
when you'd go in to try a case. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well that was during 
that period of time they would.  In 
the Federal Court there was no 
segregation, they wouldn't allow it 
in court.  State court there was but  
01:46:44 
the blacks were so crowded and white 
people wanted to get in but they 
couldn't compete with all these black 
folks and so in the most part they 
were out in the corners listening.  
But in the Federal Court they didn't 
allow that, that segregation and so 
blacks filled out the courtroom and 
as these things were enacted.  And 
Connie would tell the—or asking  
01:47:31

questions and at some point the white

was no longer the theater that it 
used to be.

What was it like traveling in the

JUDGE CARTER:  Well I didn't have too 
much difficulty.  What you did when 
you traveled for the most part, you 
had no hotel facilities, after awhile  
01:50:30 
you did have decent facilities.  But 
as I recall when I argued the Topeka 
case, one of the first of the Brown 
state cases, Jack Greenberg and I had 
to stay in a hotel and this was an 
awful hotel and I thought—told Jack 
that he didn't have to stay there, 
what he should do is stay at a decent 
hotel, he refused of course.  But 
subsequently we began to find some  
01:51:36 
decent accommodations.  But at first 
it was just awful to find some decent 
place to stay and eventually at times

he couldn't say he didn't have the 
same facility.  He had the same 
facility, he was required to sit in a 
special seat and he was roped off 
from his classmates in a special 
lunch place and so forth.  But he had 
the same books, the same professors.   
01:53:54 
We argued that he was denied equal 
educational opportunities because he 
was segregated, he was not permitted

to have intellectual intercourse with 
his fellow students.  We really had a  
01:54:27 
problem with some of our public about 
that because some of the people felt 
that we were carrying it too far, 
that we certain to lose because the 
separate but equal doctrine was being 
played out before us and they felt 
that the differences were too 
insubstantial for us to win the case.  
And Thurgood was very politically 
astute.  He brought these cases and  
01:55:23 
made public statements and so forth 
about them.  And did so to not allow 
the people who were supporting 
segregation to have the day.  And 
although each time he proves correct

next time—you know the next case they 
said we're going to far because the

01:56:12 
publicist, he knew how to handle the 
cases like that.  And it was really a 
very great time for me.

INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  In June of 1950 
you talked about equalization, trying  
01:56:38 
to push Plessy to its limit, but in 
June of 1950 the lawyers decided to 
attack Plessy directly.  Can you talk 
about that shift in strategy and the 
significance of it? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  It was really sort of 
a half shift because we told our 
people that we were going to take 
only cases—that we were going to 
attack segregation per say as being  
01:57:31 
unconstitutional and that we were not 
going to concentrate on unequal 
facilities although we did as a 
backup, you know, to show unequal 
facilities.  But our main thrust was 
that segregation per say was 
unconstitutional.  Because our theory 
was that the states could equalize or 
try to equalize the facilities or 
close the gap.  And they might win.   
01:58:28 
So we had to argue that segregation 
per say was unconstitutional.  At the 
same time we were also arguing about

unequal facilities so we didn't

01:58:48 
argument that was a fall back on 
plan. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  But here's where your 
role is so important, bringing in 
social science and Kenneth Clark, can 
you talk about your role in the 
development of strategies for 
challenging Plessy? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  For challenging 
Plessy? 
01:59:09 
INTERVIEWER:  For challenging 
segregation in the schools.  How were 
you going to make the case that 
separate could not be equal. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I was—the first 
step was Charles Houston's thesis out 
there was to bring all these cases 
and make them too expensive for the 
states to maintain.  And the theory 
was that they would then have to  
02:00:06 
allow blacks in the white 
institutions.  And if they did that

then they would be clear nothing 
would happen.  It would be clear that  
02:00:30 
segregation was quickly maintained 
peacefully and there wouldn't be 
riots and all that sort of stuff.  So 
that was what we first began doing 
and then when we came to the high 
school and so forth level.  When it 
came to the grade schools we didn't 
have the luxury of faculty to rely 
on.  We didn't have the luxury of the 
exclusiveness of alumni, we didn't  
02:01:29 
have all those things we had in the 
graduate schools and so forth.  All 
the schools were presumably one like 
that, there may have been some 
specialized grammar schools but for 
the most part they were supposedly 
all the same.  And this was when 
Brown versus the Board came up and we 
had to argue that segregation per say 
was unconstitutional.  That it  
02:02:16 
impaired the ability of black 
children to learn and we began that—

Klineberg who was the Chief Social

study which showed that black 
migration from the segregated schools

integrated, that the longer they 
stayed in the Philadelphia system out 
of segregation the higher—

we were doing and said that his study 
was exactly the thing we needed.  I  
00:02:52 
was a black man and he of course was 
initially leery of getting involved 
because he didn't know where I was 
coming from.  But what he did say to 
me, no I'm not going to help but he 
referred to Kenneth and Mamie Clark.  
And I went to—I heard of them and 
their work and I went to them and 
told Kenneth what we were doing and I 
asked him if he could help us.  And  
00:03:53 
at that time they had made Northside 
Center for Child Development, the 
only institution of its kind in 
Harlem, was sought to test the 
segregation's impact on black 
children.  And Kenneth and Mamie had 
devised this doll test.  And the doll 
test was very, very provocative, I 
guess.  They would show a black doll 
and a white doll to children, the  
00:05:20 
good doll, bad doll.  The bad doll 
was always black, the good doll was 
always white.  But the confusion was

that the white doll was always them, 
the child who was being interviewed.   
00:05:41 
And so the theory was that they 
thought about was the impact of 
segregation and discrimination on 
black children because that it 
impaired their ability to learn and 
gave them a sense of inferiority.  I 
believe that the Clarendon County 
case was the only case that we used 
this test in presentation.  We went 
to South Carolina and rented a house  
00:07:17 
where we could work and get prepared 
for the trial.  And one of the 
incidents that was very funny was 
that when the train left us off in 
Charleston, South Carolina, Kenneth 
was running saying where are my 
dolls, where are my dolls and 
Spottswood Robinson who was one of 
our people heading out then apprised 
of what we thought of doing and he  
00:08:15 
was looking at me missed because he 
thought Kenneth was kind of—and he 
got himself together when we told him

that was the only case that we

actually used the doll test itself.  
And tested the children and had them 
testify.  Other times or instances we 
had sociologists talk about it on the

became in fact almost a member of the 
staff was that he was able to get

00:10:12 
didn't have to rely on one or two 
people to become professional 
witnesses, we had a whole bevy of 
people we called on to testify as 
experts for us.  And one of the 
things that I assisted on with these 
people was not to try to help us by 
testifying out of their expertise, 
stay within it.  Don’t try to help us

they relaxed and were very good 
witnesses because I said to them when

doing us any good because what all 
the lawyers try to do is for the

it's to learn as much about your

00:12:08 
cross-examine you for that moment as

us any good if you don't keep within

you do, you're not helping us at all.  
When the academics learned that was

relaxed, testified in their field and 
didn't get beyond that.  And so we

scientist to file a brief showing 
that segregation was harmful, some of 
the people on our committee were very 
dubious because it was not part of 
science.  And what Thurgood allowed 
me always to do is he allowed me to

go as far as I could as long as I 
could support it.  And so some of our

them well I have nothing else and if 
you want to offer an alternative, 
fine.  But if not I'm going to take 
this risk and that's how social 
science got into it.  And Bill 
Coleman who was one of those that

was excellent.

came out, the three cases that we 
were arguing segregation per say.

JUDGE CARTER:  Well Brown held that—
we argued I should say, that equal  
00:17:52 
educational opportunity had never 
been argued in an education case.  
That it had been assumed by a lot of 
lawyers and judges that equal 
education opportunity had been argued 
and initially in the Supreme Court.  
But what we were able to show was the 
Court had never looked at it 
initially, it had assumed that other 
courts had initially looked at this –  
00:18:56 
- but that had not been so and so we 
argued that what the court ought to 
do now is to look at the separate but 
equal doctrine and Plessy versus 
Ferguson as never being argued in a 
equal education case.  And looking at 
it for the first time that separate 
but equal was unconstitutional.  And 
that was Chief Justice Warren brought 
that argument and wrote the opinion  
00:20:12 
that we had indicated and that was 
the Brown case.

conclusion that the Court argued that 
the Court reached unanimously and 
Brown won on the thesis that it would 
be unanimous but the implementation 
would be as they said with all 
deliberate speed, whatever that 
meant.  And the implementation meant 
that segregation was, back in Topeka, 
the first case that the Topeka did  
00:22:08 
not school, did not want—they didn't 
want to argue the case, they wanted 
to get out of it, they were ready to

concede.  And the Supreme Court—I 
wanted the Supreme Court to hold in  
00:22:41 
Topeka that segregation per say was 
unconstitutional.  But since they 
decided that they weren't going to 
meet that task the Court said it was 
moot and didn’t reach the issue.  And 
I proved correct because when the all 
deliberate speed came out it took 
some 10 or 20 years before Topeka 
again reached the point that it was 
willing or ready for this  
00:23:40 
segregation.  When the all deliberate 
speed issue came then the Topeka case 
continued and the woman or the kid or 
the child who had brought the case 
initially and the city or the state 
did not want to hold it moot and the 
Supreme Court did and some 20 years 
later they were still fighting of 
that case.  Until I think they held 
more recently or decided to hold more  
00:24:46 
recently that the time for all 
deliberate speed had run out.

South you had massive resistance in 
response to Brown.  And you really  
00:25:00 
didn't have meaningful school 
desegregation in the South until 
after 1968 or 1970, 71.  So how do 
you—what is the significance of 
Brown?  Is it just about schools?

the Brown decision in '54— 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  How do I what? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  The significance of the 
Brown decision.  
00:25:27 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well the significance 
of Brown was its holding that 
segregation was unconstitutional.  
And it had significance because after 
a long period of time when it had 
sort of run out and the all 
deliberate speed business was gone 
that we had to hold that segregation 
itself was illegal.  And the state 
finally came to that path.  But the  
00:26:34 
problem was that if it had held that 
without all deliberate speed 
indication we would have been long

gone.  The all deliberate speed 
business delayed, delayed and delayed  
00:26:55 
because nobody knew what all 
deliberate speed meant.  Or what it 
meant apparently was that you could 
just delay implementation of Brown, 
of the decision.  And the 
significance to me on Brown was that 
segregation was per say 
unconstitutional, that enforced 
segregation with law is no longer 
viable in this country.  And although  
00:27:57 
we still have segregation it is 
segregation that people are accepting 
but that it is not enforced by law.  
And I think that at some point is the 
time is going to come when it's going 
to be this public, at least I hope 
so, this public forum to end sort of 
voluntary segregation which the 
country is engaged in the present 
time.  We don't have segregation by  
00:28:56 
law anymore but people are still 
segregated and keep themselves 
segregated and we don't have a public

the beauty of the present is that at  
00:29:30 
some point there's going to be this 
public push to end segregation.  And 
since there's no law to enforce it 
that with the voluntary segregation, 
I'm hoping it's going to reach a 
point where it will not be viable.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  A few more points to 
cover with the important role you 
play beyond Brown in addition to 
working for enforcement is that in  
00:30:15 
the South the backlash to Brown, 
trying to shut down the NAACP, trying 
to outlaw the NAACP.  You were able 
to draw on the work you did at 
Columbia to fight that and do you 
want to talk about that first 
amendment— 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  The problem was that 
when Brown was decided there was a 
backlash against the NAACP.  We had  
00:31:02 
not been bothered because the 
southerners didn't feel that we worth 
bothering with, you know NAACP.  But

when the Brown case was decided they 
went after us on the thesis that if  
00:31:26 
they could outlaw the association 
that would end the problem for them.  
And so I had to spend a lot of time 
fighting to keep the NAACP alive in 
litigation because we were being 
attacked in various states, they 
tried to outlaw us, they tried to do 
this and that because it's 
unconstitutional and so forth and so 
on.  So I had a jurisprudence  
00:32:15 
protecting and fighting for the NAACP 
life because southerners felt that if 
they outlaw the association that 
would end the problem.  They didn't 
realize that the association was not 
the issue that the people were 
concerned with it and outlawing the 
association they'd have to outlaw 
other folks who under some other name 
would be fighting to end segregation.

point but I think it's important is 
your decision—you become General 
Counsel of the NAACP in 1955 and you 
make a decision to turn attention to 
the North and to the problem of 
school segregation in the North.  
Could you say a bit about why you did 
that and how you attempted to apply  
00:35:54 
Brown beyond the South? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I—let me see how 
I can say this—can get this.  I had a 
problem with—Jack Greenberg and I had 
a problem.  When Thurgood left Jack 
wanted to take Thurgood's place and 
be the head man and reduce me to the 
role of counsel.  While he ran the 
works of Thurgood's, took over 
Thurgood's role and my role was just  
00:37:32 
to be counsel for the NAACP with no 
right to bring segregation—the 
segregation cases and so forth.  And

he tried to get Roy to bar me from 
bringing segregation cases, that they  
00:38:05 
all should come to him as head of the 
legal defense fund.  And we had a 
very, very fight, public fight about 
that.  He sought to get Roy to turn—
have me turn over to him all the 
segregation cases.  And I was very 
bitter with him because in the 
beginning he had been so helpful with 
me on segregation cases and then when 
Thurgood left to go onto court, onto  
00:39:38 
Court of Appeals, he thought that as 
counsel of Thurgood's successor that 
he could have Roy bar me from 
bringing any of these segregation 
cases and they all were supposed to 
belong to him.  The problem with that 
was that I had all the segregation 
cases, I had them in my hand and I 
was certainly not going to turn them 
over to him.  He thought he could get  
00:40:33 
Roy to do that, to force me to do 
that.  And Roy was very—probably Roy 
was not willing to have a public

fight and he knew that if he tried to 
accept Jack's plan that there was  
00:41:17 
going to be hell to pay.  And that's 
how Jack Greenberg and I had our 
problem with one another which now, 
you know, I left the association 
because they fired Lewis Steele who 
was a member of my staff without 
notice to me, without consulting me, 
because he had written an article and 
the article came out unfortunately on 
a day that the NAACP Board was  
00:42:30 
meeting and its title was Nine Men in 
Black who think White.  And I was 
told that Thurgood was on the Court 
at the time and he was furious.  And 
as a result of that article they 
fired Lewis.  And I threatened and my 
whole staff threatened to resign if 
they didn’t reinstate him.  
Fortunately Roy was in Paris and 
wasn't able to - - this stuff, so it  
00:43:33 
all came out and the ACLU and I was 
resigning and I got a halo, think w

good job and I'm resigning my job 
because they fired a white boy.   
00:43:54 
The opposite of the stereotype.  And 
so at that point I was sort of tired, 
I didn't know where I was going with 
the school segregations because I 
thought I had exhausted all the 
avenues.  But when I threatened to 
resign if they didn't reinstate 
Lewis, I began to get revitalization 
because I thought for the wrong 
reason because here I'm black and I'm  
00:44:57 
resigning a pretty good job because a 
white man has been mistreated.  So 
that gave me a new lease on life.  It 
probably helped me get a judgeship 
too I think because I don't know how 
I—I was first come up to be a judge 
when Thurgood—in the Kennedy era, 
Thurgood was wanted to a judgeship 
and they were ready to give him one 
but only at the District level and he  
00:46:17 
wanted something bigger than that.  
And the Kennedy didn't, at that time, 
feel that blacks were—this was too

good of job for a black man so they 
came after me.  And I had these  
00:46:51 
people that wanted me to get a 
judgeship and Adam Clayton Powell and 
I had several conversations and he 
indicated to me that I had to pay, if 
I paid a certain amount of money for 
the judgeship I could get it.  So I 
told my advisors this and all hell 
broke loose because they felt that 
was a big to do and stuff like that.  
And it ended up with my people had to  
00:48:07 
back down because of the politics of 
the issue.  And I always say that I 
was responsible for Thurgood getting 
his Court of Appeals appointment 
because all the hell-a-boohoo that 
was caused by my people that Powell 
had asked me for money or indicated 
that I give him money in the end it 
was politics.  He had the votes and 
so I was abandoned and that ended up  
00:49:16 
with Thurgood getting it.  And I 
thought at that point that my chance 
of getting a judgeship had ended but

00:49:40 
INTERVIEWER:  But before I finish up 
I just want to go back one more time 
on this school piece because when you 
left in 1968, when you left the NAACP 
you were involved in the Ocean Hill-
Brownsville case, in the Harlem 201 
case and I think your fight for 
equality education for black children 
sort of was beyond Brown.  You tried 
to look to the North and deal with  
00:50:08 
the problems with segregated and 
unequal schools in the North.  So 
maybe if you'd want to reflect on 
that, on the state of education today 
what's happened and what hasn't 
happened, but your efforts in the 
North were really pioneering. 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  The North schools 
were—what I discovered about the 
North was that the issue of  
00:50:38 
segregation was not North/South it 
was nationwide and the northern 
schools didn't want integration, they

wanted to keep their schools 
segregated and they were  
00:51:06 
gerrymandered in instances.  But the 
northern school segregation is—that 
the northern issue of segregation is 
no different than the South.  The 
issue of keeping blacks and whites 
separate is a national phenomenon.  
And there has been no push recently 
to move and I expect that at some 
point there is going to be an issue 
of this manly voluntary school  
00:52:23 
segregation.  I don't know but right 
now everything is—nobody is doing 
anything publically and the issue is 
dormant.  But I'm hoping that at some 
point there is going to be a push for 
someone to end voluntary segregation, 
to make it more of a public issue 
again.  But so far nothing.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  One last question and 
then we'll do our filling in.  In the

light of your history and your long 
struggle in the civil rights 
movement, how do you see the

significance of Obama's election 
related to your history and to the  
00:53:29 
struggles you've been involved in? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well there's been 
several things that have happened 
with Obama that were unexpected.  And 
the passage of one of the bills for 
equal education, one of the bills 
that Obama managed to get through 
came as a shock and surprise.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  But just the actual 
election of Obama we were all here  
00:54:36 
that night, just his election, how 
did that make you feel in terms of 
your work to break down barriers to 
get voting rights in the South, I 
mean nationally, any thoughts on that 
moment? 
 
JUDGE CARTER:  Well I think that his 
election was certainly supportive of 
what I had hoped to achieve.  But my 
story and what I hoped to achieve was  
00:55:31 
not the election of a black 
president, I wanted to still achieve 
equal educational opportunities in

blacks and so that everybody had a  
00:55:55 
chance at equal educational 
opportunities because I think that 
that's the key to finding black 
equality and diversity.  And for me 
however is if everybody was able to 
secure equal educational opportunity 
it would be so.  Now that may be an 
elitist's view, I don't know, but 
that's how I look upon it.  And I am 
now too old to pursue it because I'm

think are going to take it over.  So 
I don't have any sense of trying to 
keep these folks—I encourage them to 
come on because I have—I'm sort of

mentally fatigued and sometimes I 
have—I do a little writing and stuff
