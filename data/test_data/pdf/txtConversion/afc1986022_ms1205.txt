questions as they did her; I don't know how they come out with it. <gap> They still friends
to me all of 'em.
Q. Where's the lake now? <gap> You say the people come out to fish
A. Well, I believe but I closed it; I closed it about 6 months ago. Run it for about 14 years,
and I stocked it with catfish, channel catfish. And I didn't want anybody fishin' cause it
small you know. I put some in once or twice before and they had grown til they was about
4,5,6 pounds and I had such good luck with 'em I just ordered me a thousand more.
Q. <gap> cousin has a fishing lake out there by <gap> Acutally, he's got 2 little lakes.
A. If I had someone to help me, I'd just turn mine into a catfish lake all together.

on a blueberry <gap> You'd be surprised to know <gap> well, if I had some bait I'd set
out me a hook and there was another man fishing too, and I said let's put some of these
blackberries on the hook and see. I said I've heard they stay on the mulberry bush, I
mean on the lakes and rivers. And so we did, and the next morning we had a 3 lb. catfish.

Q. How about a non formal implement kept at the barn or tool shed for sharpening tools?
Something that you couldn't carry?
A. <gap> Yeah, I had one, but someone stole it. We had all those things. Anything we
wanted on the farm we had to borrow it like all the folks we went and bought it. But lot
of folks borrowed it and never did bring them back. <gap> I still have an anvil, an old
anvil. <gap> I think it's around 150 years old. I was going to call my sister last night to see
because my daddy bought it in 1909 from his sister, and then it had been handed down
from them, and then when my daddy died I bought it from him, and then we used it, and
that's been a long, long time ago. My daddy before he died had it around 70 years, and

husband's mind wasn't too good; he was in World War I and it only got worse all the time.
And they persuaded him to let him have it. Of course, I couldn't do anything about it, you
know, then. It had had this <gap> And I've been thinking that when I had somebody help
me what I got left I'd like to put them all in a house together and keep them locked up,
so they wouldn't get 'em cause they got so many I had <gap> I'd be gone and so many
fishers come in you know, and I couldn't tell where they were

iron wedges to split wood with and they got <gap> I think I know where they went to, but
