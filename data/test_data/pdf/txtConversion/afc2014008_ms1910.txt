"Yolk Teaching Technique and Lear*ing a
 
Traditional Style"
 
Some years ago, in a paper read before the Calif. Folklore Society, I
 
suggested that a simple, but useful strategy might be f
or the investigator to
 
try learning a traditional technique under the instruction of a traditional
 
performer.  My hypothesis--based on a certain amount of personal experience--
was that traditional
. performers would be unable to tolerate errors in execution
 
in c
ases whet, really significant cultural norms were being violated.  On the
 
other hand, errors considered to be of minor importance or s.lf-corr.ctible when
 
more physical proficiency had been gained would be passed over or not mentioned.
 
(
I do hope that i
t i
s c
lear I am speaking of natural
, or unintentional errors.
 
In my own l
imited experience with learning traditional musical and dance techniquqs,
 
I have found that I have made q
uite enough mistakes out of sheer ineptness,
 
without needing to fake any for experimental purposes.  Nor would I want to consider
 
doing s
o; to me.
, this would risk violating the
' mutual trust that must obtain between
 
teacher and pupil, informant and folklorist.)
 
The entire process I an suggesting here represents, of curse, an *kims abnormal
 
cultural occurrence.  With the possible historical exception of the singing school
 
(
where the emphasis so me t
o have been on l
earning note reading rather than
 
repertoire or singing s
tyle) tradidional educational processes in the United
 
S
tates are ordinarily informal rather than formal.  It seems most probable, indeed,
 
t
hat formal teaching may occur •xclu*ibely when s
omeone outside the tradition i
s
 
being i
nstructed.  Novices Inside the culture group are expected to "pick up" their
 
skills--a process which seems most often to involve selecting • model, carefully
 
observing him and retiring alone to practice.  Traditional paifaz a
m perfo e
mers I
 
have consulted on this point do occasionally mention that someone '
showed" them
 
something:  that l
j, a complex instrumental piece or a dance step was demonstrated on
 
/

Of course, as any college student can tell you, even the most formal of
 
instructional interactions contain a certain element of "picking up" on the part
 
of the student and "showing" on the part of the instructor •
 There i
s no human
 
situation I know of in which all the values being called into play are explicitly
 
stated.  Even in the most extreme cross -c
ultural confrontations, human beings are
 
simply sensitive to each other's cues; and we must be eternally thankful for this.
 
However, I think the point still holds that totally informal education can only'
 
occur when the essential cultural norms have already been internalized by the
 
l
earner.  And thus the formal instructional situation may help to make explicit
 
those levels of cultural propriety that the outsider must otherwise either intuit
 
or dig for by various analytical techniques.
 
Personally, I should uke to see the learning of a traditinel technique from
 
a tradicl
i,n-carrier become as or
f
tiary a part of the training of 2o1k-lorists as
 
is field-work experience or learning bow to use the Motif lndaa•  In the first
 
p
lace, i
t puts folk-lorist and 4afv-
 informant into their proper rehationship: as
 
student and teacher.  Secondly, i
t provides the folk-l
.oriat with opportunities for
 
insight as well as access to certain kinds of data often unavailable throu-
Interviews or observation.  Lastly, if the results of a sufficient number u
 
such exp e
riences could be pooled, we might be in a position bo make some a
t
 
concerning a few of the troublesome questions involved not only in the initial
 
problem of folk aesthetics but in the l
arger pax problems of
 rm
cii
'
 
As an example of the kinds of insights and the variety o
f o er
t 's fiet
 
can be made through a such experiences, Barbara W an will give a preliminary
 
report on her training by a traditional fiddle player during the past year.
 
Miss LaPan obtained her B.A. degree in anthropology at SFVSC; she has also
 
received graduate training in the Dept. of Folklore and Folklife and the U
. of Perna.,
 
and i
s currently a graduate a
sSistank in the Anthropolo gy Dept. at SFVSC

Soon after I became a member of the So. Calif. Old-T i
m. Fiddler's Assoc. I
 
decided to t
ry my hand a
t l
earning hoedown f
iddle.  I would need a teacher but
 
didn't quite know how to go about getting one.  I "casually" mentio n
ed my dilemma
 
t
o one of the members whith whom I was better acquainted and he volunteered to try
 
t
o teach me.
 
When I a
rrived a
t his house f
or my f
irst l
esson, I wasn't quite prepared f
or
 
what I f
ound.  ft expectation of the teaching situation was that i
t would include
 
only the two of us.  Instead, I found a group of men, neighbors, who had cove
 
together f
or a j
am session.  My new-found teacher's stsategy was vague.  After
 
they played a
round a bit, while I just l
istened and watched, i
t became * clear
 
to me that Manuel, my volunteer teacher, didn't have the slightest i
t.a ,
f how t
o
 
g
o about teaching me to play old-time fiddle.  Apparently he felt this inadequacy
 
himself and f
inally allowed a
s how he didn't think he'd really have enough time to
 
be a
ble t
o teach we but would try to l
ine up someone else f
or the j
ob.
 
Several days l
ater he called and said that he had arranged f
or me to most
 
a man by t
he name of Earl Collins, also a member of the fiddler's assoc atton.  Me
 
t
old me t
hat Earl had been sick all year  
,couldn't work, was around the house all
 
day, and so would have pleanty of time to teach as.  In a most aff.ctionaXts and
 
appreciative tone of voice, Manuel assured we that Earl was a good man and a f
ine
 
f
iddler a
nd that he would be expecting my call.
 
Although I felt awkward about barging in on someone I didn't know--especially
 
i
f he were sick--I called.  Earl was encouraging without sounding compelling.  We
 
set up a date f
or ch.
' f
ollov ng evening at his house.  This was to t
he early Spring
 
of 1
970.  I
t was only after I had known Earl awhile that I l
earned he was born i
n
 
t
he Osarks i
n Douglas County, Missouri sisty years ago and i
s the f
ifth of nine
 
children.  His 4'
aaily l
ive'4 and sbar.crnpped in Missouri until Earl was seven wbpn
 
they moved t
o Shawnee, Oklahoma.  Earl remained on the f
arm until h2 married and
 
c
ame t
o California i
n l
93 .

Champion f
iddlers in the Collins f
amily go back at l
east four generations on
 
Earl's f
ather's aide of the f
amily.  Earl onc* told as that his f
ather was the
 
championship f
iddler of Missouri.  When I asked i
t his f
ather had von i
ota of
 
contests Earl said no, his f
ather had never entered a aingel contest.  In my
 
naivete I a
sked, how then d
id he know he was a championship fiddler if hadn't ever
 
won a contest.  Earl's smile broke into an indulgent l
augh, he shrugged his shoulders
 
and simply s
tated the obvious:  "everyone just told him hevas a championship fiddler."
 
Initially, I came to Earl a
s a s
tudent interested in l
earning old-time f
iddle,
 
n
ot in collecting f
olk teaching techniques.  From his point of view I am the first
 
person he has e
ver taught.  Is a sense, we have l
earned from each other.  As I
 
l
earned more about traditional f
iddle techniques  Earl has l
earned more about
 
teaching techniques.  From this experience he has become increasingly aware of the
 
discrete unite bhat make up the whole of his own style and increasingly able to
 
break down
 this gestalt into particulars for the purposes of teaching.
 
As with many country fiddlers, Earl knows that all old-time f
iddling does not
 
sound t
he s
ame.  (
The way they play in Texas i
s different from the way they play
 
i
n Oklahoma i
s different f
rom Georgia, e
tc.).  The e
ssential difference i
s what
 
ink* f
olklorists and •bhnomeisicologists call s
tyl.  and what Earl calls tone.
  
! L
.
e i
s what he wants to teach me--not repertoire or technique except in5o6ar a
s
 
t
hey produce traditional t
ome.
 
His i
nitial s
trategy was to instruct as verbally a
s to the extent of the
 
variations possible L
eading up to the production of sound.  It became c
lear to me
 
that he had worked out and f
ormulated these basic points f
or himself and had
 
p
robably explained theato others t
ong before we ever not.
 
To begin, I think i
t would be helpful to describe parts of my xIfxfa f
irst

taggered.  This
 
arrangement gave i
sa a clear view of Ian 's l
eft hand and the position
 
of his f
ingers f
or noting.

.  He shoved me how he  .
ld his bow and explained that his grasp was not
 
s
tandard (
he only uses two fingers) and that  this was a difficult
 
snip f
or most.
 
3
.  At the same t
ime he drew my attention to the fact that be played with a
 
very slack bow, t
hat i
s, l
oons bow hair.

.  The importance of h
2w and where to hold the fiddle i
s a problem germane
 
only to violinists, a
ccording to Ian .  Arching the left wrist i
s essential
 
in that i
t prevents bbe butt of the violin f
rom resting on the wrist
 
which in turn insures maximum f
reedom of movement into second and third
 
positions.  Earl points out that since old-time fiddlers rarely play in
 
anything but first position, how the f
iddle i
s hold i
s of u n
tie consequence.  Of
 
similar inconsequence i
s where th. fiddle i
s placed.  I
t doens't matter if i
t
 
rests on the chest, under the chin, or even if i
t's b
raid up against the mid-section.
 
In the l
ast three $ints mentioned, the critical f
actor involved i
s that of
 
personal preference or, a
s Earl puts i
t, '
whatever feels good to you." He has
 
repeatedly emphasized that he i
s aware of t
he various different ways in which
 
others do things but that this i
s how he does i
t and if I want to do i
t the same
 
way,  fine; it not, I should j
ust do what feels right,  in other words, the range
 
of choice i
s maximum.
 
Introducing the bow to the strings of the f
iddle presented three additional
 
problems of technique:
 
1
.  What part of the bow i
s used?  Fail explained that he only uses the t
 
part of his bow--approximately
 the first third starting f
rom the ivor
 
t
ip.  On this p
oint maximum f
lexibility o
btains.
 
S 
/
 
2
.  On what part of the strings does one place the bow?  Earl positions the
 
bow on the portion of the strings that stretch over the end of the finger-
b
oard.  On t
his second point be i
s notable l
ess f
lexible.
 
'.
 At what angle s
hould phe bow be manipulated'  Quoting Earl:  "Wherever
 
i
t f
eels good t
o you.  But t
ry to run i
t straight up and down  bear
 
down, and keep i
t smooth."  On this f
inal p
oint he i
s what I can only
 
d
escribe a
s f
lexibly i
nsistent.
 
C
lose e
<siIn tion of te p
receding parameters of style and Earl's teaching
 
techni que  yi el ds  t
he f
o f
low!ng o
bservations.  He indicates a great deal of
 
f
lexibility s
o l
ong a
s t
he bow and f
iddle are not i
n c
ontact with each o
ther.  As
 
e
 would a
pproach the dimensions that bring we closer to producing sounds ) that
 
i
s  an interaction between the bow and r
iddle, Earl becomes increasingly jj j
 
f
lexible and more intent on impressing me with the importance of doing i
t as he
 
does s
o t
hat I have t
he greatest pea*ihlf p
ossibility of replicating his sound.
 
A
lso i
mportant to note i
s that unlike Western classi
cal music teachers, Earl
 
has never v
iolated t
he physical distance that separate. us.  He has never taught
 
me initially or c
orrected me procedurally by t
ouching or moving z
ae.
 Re has never
 
manipulated t
he fingers on my l
eft hand to correct my not infrequent sour noting,
 
he has never reached out and moved my wandering bow into the correct position of
i
 
t
he s
trings, and he has waver put my uncertain fingers in the correct place on the
 
f
rog of t
he bow.
 
Though t
his may i
n part be due to his notion of proper behavior between t
he
 
sexes, the c
rux of Earl's teaching technique rests, nevertheless, on t
he basis of
 
imi example and imitation--imitation which L
. judged and verified visusily. 
At t
his point, we began to p
lay, a
t which time the p
roblems of tone, or s
tyle,
 
become t
he f
ocus of our j
oint efforts.
 
According t
o
 s
tandards,
 s
 ,
 
fiddling.  He says that i
t's hard to get an old hoedown fiddler's tone and as far
 
as hi' s concerned, there '
s not too many around that have i
.t •  When I a
sked his how
 
one would go about getting that tone he chuckled l
ightly and answered:
 
I don't know, you gotta pick i
t up off of somebody.  Just like you now,
 
see.  You're slaying "Turkey in the S
traw."  You're playing with the same
 
tone I
'm playing in .
 Only you're playing a lot slower.  If y
ou like
 
my tone, or if you like someone else's, why you'll pick up after him.
 
You'll get as close a
s you can.  I
t's a touch on the s
trings and smooth
 
'
)ovt!lg what makes a fiddler.
 
Bowing, !arl says, i
s i
SV
, of old-time fiddling.  it i
s of course, a major
 
factor contributing to the production of dynamics and rhythm.  Included in the other
 
25% i
s whet gerl
, calls clear noting.  This refers to the stopping of a s
tring, by
 
a finger on the left b.dd hand in order to yield an accurately pitched note--not
 
flat and not sharp.  A key factor in clear noting i
s memory, which i
s, of course,
 
essential to most traditional performers.  Rarl puts i
t this ways
 
You to got i
t in your mind and you know j
ust exactly bow i
t goes.  You
 
know how i
t goes on the fiddle.  You know when you miii i
t and you know
 
when you're right.  Th*t's the f
Irst thing you gct'.a do 'oi v
oi're
 
playing by memory.
 
When we start on a new tune, he plays i
t a coup e of t
imes so that I can
 
begin to recognise it; he then breaks i
t up into muaicâly logical segments and
 
p
lays the first one several times.  Overall, he prefers to teach l
ong rather than
 
short phrases.  With my eyes glued to his fingerboard, I try to imitate the
 
sound I hear by placing my fingers on the some spot on the fingerboard of my own
 
f
iddle a
s he does •
 We repeat this process of example and imitation until I manage
 
reasonably accurate pitch.  Once I
've accomplished this, larl goes on to the next
 
phrase repeating the some process.  I should emphasize here that once I master the
 
basic tune, i
t's not e
ssential that I hit the exact sa
me notes a
s Han .  However,
 
the notes I do hit must be true.  Bart has never taught me or given me an example
 
of a melodic line outside the context of the rhythmic dimension.  To do that would
 
be very close to teaching scales and a
s Zarl points out, "scales are for violinists;
 
t
hey don't mean a doggone thing in hoedowns."
 
As well a
s emphasising clear noting, torl i
s simultaneously concerned with
 
smooth bowing- -which refers to the mariner in which the bow passes over the strings,
 
not how much l
ength i
s used.  A smooch bow i
s achieved by placing the bow on the
 
s
trings and applying the appropriate stress.  It has nothing to do with jerky or
 
uneven a
rm, wrist or hand movements
 If I exert the proper pressure I can avoid
 
making scratchy or squeaky sounds while pushing and pulling the bow over the s
trings.
 
As a y
oungster, Earl played fiddler f
or l
ocal square dances.  I
t appears t
hat
 
his very early participation in the coordination of music and d
ance has nurtured
 
and intensified his concern with rhythm.  When we s
tart to play a tune, Earl
.
 
i
nsures proper rhythm f
rom the outset by insisting on, what he calls t
he kick-of f
- -
that i
s, bowing a chord of the key the tune i
s played in.  This sets up the rhythm
 
we're going to play in and a
ssures a simultaneous commencement.  Assuming we have
 
s
tarted together, i
f I b begin to l
ag behind, Earl begins to tap his siread'
 
t
apping toe such more f
irmly.  H. does this as such for his on need to
 
proper rhythm and thereby set a peoper •xamply, as he dove to si na'
 . j
o
 
c
ase I haven't heard, I
've l
ost my rhythm and better find i
t.
 
Before the two of us ever talked about i
t, Earl managed to communicate the
 
significance of t
he stylistic parameters just mentioned in a variety of axktir subtle
 
ways.  I
'm sure it's n
o accident that he has reminded ma that I am playing with and
 
not jq the same tone as he.  By his own varying degrees of reaction and non-reaction,
 
he continually provides c
lues and persistently encourages me to sa race and hopefully
 
internalize his own stylistic values.
 
Though his e
ssential teaching technique i
s grounded in example and imitation--
example by Earl and imitation by me--one important distinction to make i
s t
his:
 
on one level my accomplishments are evaluated primarily vis.tsll ; on a for more
 
important l
evel j
udgment and verification rely on aural perception, that is, they
 
a
re based on my relative success in the actual production of sound.  In other words,
 
I me expected primarily to watch Earl; he, on the other hand listens to me.
 
On balance, I believe I
 have the bett e
r part of the deal.
 
I suppose I c
ould have learned to play old-time fiddle on my own by l
istening
 
t
o records and reading music books.  Even now a f
riend of mine asks why I don't
 
l
earn the scales; he suggests that by doing so I could make i
t a l
ot easier on
 
myself--and perhaps he i
s right.  However  
,the "easier" way i
s n
ot always the
 
most intellectually rewarding or emotionally s
taisfying way of doing things.  After
 
all, I
 want t
o l
earn old-time f
iddle gat the easiest way to
 fiddle.
 
As a human being, Earl collins extends far beyond the uni-dimensions of
 
sound and print.  In stature he i
s a f
rail wisp of a man whose cultural background
 
and experience i
s quite different f
rom my own.  Taken as a wholø, our relationship
 
represents a coming t
ogether and exchange of human experience.  To our social
 
relationship, Earl has brought the "old-time"
' and to our teaching relationship
 
be has brought t
he "fiddling."  in experiential terms, he could give me mex no
 
greater gifts.
