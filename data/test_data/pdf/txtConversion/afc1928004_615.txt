BOUM DOYLE. 
Beautiful waltz song written expressly for PAT REILLY by " James 
O'Neil," Music published and copyrighted by E. H. Harding. 
229 Bowery. 
I'm a 
masher among the shop girls, 
I 
carry on business down-town; 
Every morning at eight me breakfast I 
cat, 
With coffee and doughnuts done brown. 
The ladies they all at me smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style; 
And the boys on the street when ever I 
meet, 
Say how do you do Boquet Doyle. 
CHORUS. 
Boquets I 
wear in my coat, 
Da-ies and Posies and Pink and White roses, 
With Perfume I'm ready to choke, 
Oh! carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn , 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park, 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street, 
I 
always do give him a 
dime.

THE GEM OF THE 'SEA. 
Written by PIT REILLY. 
—: 0:— 
With all condescension I'd turn your attention, 
To what I 
would mention of Erin so green; 
And without hesitation, I'd show how that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
It happened one morning without any warning, 
That Venus was born in the beautiful sea, 
And be that same token, aud sure 'was prevoking, 
Her pinions were soaking and would not give play, 
Till Neptune who knew her began to pursue her 
In order to woo her, the wicked old Jew; 
And he very nigh caught her on the top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter who cried philaloo. 
So jove, the great genius looked down and saw Venus, 
And Neptune so heinous pursuing her wild; 
So he roared out in thunder I'd tear him asunder, 
And sure 'twas no wonder for teasing his child. 
So a 
star that was flying around him aspiring, 
He seized without sighing and hurled it below, 
Where it tumbled like winking on Neptune while 
• 
sinking, 
And gave him I'm thinking a 
broth of a 
blow, 
That star was dryland both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the land of my birth; 
Thus plain is the story, case sent down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary is a 
heaven on earth. 
So Venus jumped neatly on Erin so stately,-
But fainted case lately so bothered and pressed; 
Which much did bewilder but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That glass so victorious it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might proove; 
Hence how can ye's blame us that Erin's so famous, 
For beauty and murder and whiskey and love,

McCORMACK THE MASHER.

Written by " Edwin Talbot," Comedian, and sung by PAT REILLY 
with great success at Harry Miner's Theatre, N. Y.

McCormack's my name I'm noted for fame, 
I 
travel on gall you can bet I 
am game, 
I 
mash all the ladies wherever they may be, 
You can bet there's no masher like McCormack. 
Clionus. 
You can bet I 
am game and McCormack's my name, 
I 
wear a 
large ulster and gold-headed cane, 
I 
live on wind-hash, I 
cut a 
great dash, 
And there's not such a 
masher as McCormack. 
While going down the street a 
young lady I 
did meet, 
She was quite captivating with white pearly teeth, 
Says I 
how do you do Miss, grabbed her in me arms and 
gave her a 
kiss, 
And I 
swallowed the teeth of the lady. 
I 
am going to change life and get me a 
wife, 
A 
darling young creature to cheer me when old, 
And every night in the week of me love I 
will speak, 
And tell stories to all our young mashers

PAPA'S LITTLE BABY BOY, 
:0: 
Written by EDWIN FRANCIS, Providence, R. 1., and respectfully 
dedicated to my little nephew, JOEY. 
• 
0 : 
" 
I 
am papa's baby boy," thus said a 
little child 
As he toddled about on the floor, 
While on his sunny face a 
smile did brightly shine 
As those words he repeated o'er and o'er; 
They sounded sweet and pretty as they fell from his lips, 
Each word was full of love and joy, 
And I 
prayed in my heart that God would spare the life 
Of papa's little baby boy. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ho 
Nx man: - things the children may do 
If their little hands they rightly employ, 
And how much joy and sunshine there is in a 
home 
Where there's a 
little baby boy. 
When the great Master was here upon earth, 
The children he loved to behold; 
He took them tenderly up in his arms, 
And called them the lambs of his fold. 
Oh, may our heavenly Father watch o'er papa's baby boy 
And keep him from harm every day; 
And as from childhood to manhood he grows, 
May he walk in the blessed narrow way. ( Chorus),

Soft I 
sing of Mattie, dear, 
Sweetest young maiden far 
Dearest yet, she's my pet, 
Warming up my heart so queer. 
On the fires of love that lie 
In the sweet corners of her eye, 
Oh, I'm gone, I'm killed with joy, 
About my Mattie, dear. 
Clionts: 
or near; 
Mattie mine, girl so fine,—Sym. 
Dearest yet, she's my pet.—Sym. 
She's the belle, the daisy grand, 
Sure she's the Queen of Ireland; 
On my royal head I'd stand, 
For my sweet Mattie, dear. 
In a 
dry good's store below, 
Juggling- 
silks and calico; 
All the day there she'll stay, 
Wasting her sweet life away. 
Oh, if I 
had gold in store, 
I 
would let her work no more; 
For it's in a 
birdie's cage, 
I'd put my Matt le. dear.

NICHOLAS MURPHY. 
Written by " James Richmond" for PAT Rzn.i.x. 
Air--Tral-a-La, La. 
—:o:— 
Arrah my name is Nicholas Murphy, 
I 
work in a 
drug store laying bricks; 
The loafers say hn too light to drown, 
And I 
am the king of full-blooded 'nicks. 
They nailed my Sunday suit. of clothes to the 
wall, 
Nearly seared my wife to death; 
Threw me down the sewer, danced on my lungs 
And told me to bottle my breath. 
Ctionus. 
Sure they shot out the eye of my eldest son, 
Them dirty blackguards and bums; 
Sure they holler McNally, chase yourself up the 
alley, 
And shave the whiskers off your gums. 
They hung me on a 
clothes line, 
Dropped a 
cannon ball on my head; 
Brought me on the roof and dropped me off, 
Seven gallons of blood I 
bled. 
They hired an undertaker to bury me, 
When he discovered I 
was in a 
trance; 
There was a 
hundred blackguards and a 
German 
band, 
Around my coffin to have a 
dance. 
'RECITATION. 
Written by " James Richmond" for PAT REILLY, and delivered 
with great success. 
The boy stood on the edge of a 
razor, 
Trying to shave his toes; 
lie was throwing bricks at his little sister, 
And balancing eggs upon his nose. 
His father's lead- pipe was all cut up, 
To make bullets for the Fourth of July; 
But when his father found it out, 
lie made him a 
present of a 
lovely big black eye. 
Little Mikey swore he'd be revenged, 
And kept up to his belief ; 
So heliilled the cat for supper one night, 
And told the family it was corn-beef. 
They all took sick and nearly died 
From the ugly grease and fat, 
And when the doctor asked who done it, 
He said, " Be Heavens, it was the cat." 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, and sung with success by 
PAT REILLY.

J. 
FISHER, tw.o. 
I've a 
daughter, her name, is Rose, 
She dances the Can Can upon her nose; 
She wears brass diamonds and makes clothes, 
And waltzes with the clown; 
Her name on the bills is Madame McGuire, 
For ten million a 
night she walks the slack- wire; 
Drinks Cod-Liver- Oil and spits red fire, 
With P. T. Barnum's show. 
Ctront-s: 
My daughter Mary Ellen goes on the trapeze, 
Walks on the tight-rope from trees to trees; 
She is a 
terrible masher and takes her ease, 
My daughter Mary Ellen McGuire. 
She'll put on the gloves with tigers to fight, 
She'll work no less than ten million a 
night; 
She shoots from a 
cannon higher than a 
kite, 
She wrestles all the bears; 
She'll soon buy a 
mansion of solid gold, 
Next July she'll be nineteen years old • 
Then she'll be more cheeky and bold, 
Than her Nobbs, the Queen of Ireland. 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, for and sung by PAT REILLY 
with great success. 
Air—What Do You Say. 
I 
am Senator McCann and ex-Alderman, 
I've refused the President's Chair; 
I 
eat Webster's Dictionary for pills. 
I've made a 
fortune bottling air; 
If I 
was President, I'd have the Mississippi River 
run dry, 
I'd make girls wear mustaches and pants; 
We'd have moonlight picnics in the clouds, 
And dance an Irish Can Can dance. 
CHORUS: 
I'd make all the Chinese do washing free, 
Hang the organ grinders for fun; 
Oh, I'll build an iron ladder to Heaven, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Dance. 
I'd put all the old maids upon the Police, 
In the Gas House I'd put Jim Blaine; 
I'd have a 
tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean, 
And have a 
law to prevent snow and rain; 
I'd paint the moon, kalsomine the clouds, 
Whitewash the stars and sun; 
You can live forever, have your breath insured, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Chorus

Jeremiah McCarthy is the name I 
bear, 
I 
work hard laying stones and bricks; 
But the loafers say I 
am too light to sink, 
And I 
am the king of full blooded micks; 
They nailed my Sunday clothes and hat to the wall 
Stabbed my wife with an eight-day gun; 
Threw me down the sewer, danced on my lungs, 
And called me an Irish bum. 
Cnonus: 
But worse than that, they killed my eldest son, 
Those dirty loafers and bums; 
They holler McNally, chase yourself up the alley, 
And shave the whiskers off your gunis. 
They stole the shoes right off my feet, 
Dropped a 
cannon ball on my head; 
Took me up on the roof and threw me off, 
Eleven gallon of blood I 
bled: 
They hired an undertaker to bury me alive, 
ITe discovered I 
was in a 
trance: 
There was a 
hundred blackguards with a 
German 
Band, 
On my coffin to have a 
dance. 
Cuonus: 
I 
had them sent to jail for seventeen years, 
They nearly seared the old woman to death; 
Then set me on a 
cake of ice, 
And asked me for to sweat. 
Recitation. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT REILLY, and recited by hire 
with great success. 
McNally stood on a 
barrel of flour, 
Trying to earn a 
stamp; 
Lecturing for politicians, some one 
Hollered you are a 
tramp; 
You are a 
liar! says McNally, 
I 
can prove you are a 
bum; 
Alt, cheese it Jack, don't guy him, 
The J 
is full of rum. 
Forty years ago I 
was a 
banker, 
And lived in finest style; 
I 
had an only daughter, 
The beauty for many a 
mile; 
She fell in love with a 
blackguard, 
One Terry Ryan by name, 
Who made me make my will to them, 
On the plea I 
was insane—oh! 
Soon I 
was forsaken, 
And left in pain to groan; 
And I 
found out by the looks of things, 
I 
was left forever alone! 
They sold my home, took all my money, 
Did not leave me a 
dollar; 
I 
could not get a 
position then, 
Even being a 
first-rate scholar. 
But never mind, my time will come 
When it's my turn to light the lamp, 
But I'll wait patiently for it, 
For I 
am only a 
sample tramp.

It was on a 
Saturday night. 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Henderson Carter 
Our Captain for to be; 
He accepted the office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers, 
For to march in front of the ranks 
Of The Big " 4" Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
We march like Soldiers, through the strix44, 
With our new flags flying so gay; 
And beat the time with both our feet, 
While the Rand does sweetly play ; 
From windows high, the girls do look, 
And smile on us, Pioneers! 
And then their handkerchiefs they wave. 
At the Big " 4" Musketeers. 
As we're marching down the street, 
With our Band a 
playing, so gay, 
Some people we chance to meet, 
And this we heard them say— 
Who are those Soldiers so bold? 
They look so very queer ! 
The crowd then all did shout— 
That's The Big " 4" Musketeers ! 
We march, .3x. 
MARIE THE TRAMP. 
'Written and sung by Billy Barry, with great success. 
(The great hit of Brooklyn.) 
We sat on Blackwell's Island, Marie, 
It was far better than Sing Sing ; 
You remember down at Geoghegan's, Marie, 
We got two year's for stealing a 
watch and ring. 
We sat upon a 
beer keg, Marie, 
A policeman our breeches he did fan; 
It 
was a 
nice June morn in January, Marie, 
We were trying to work the racket with a 
can, 
We sat upon a 
church steeple, Marie, 
Nearly on the verge of ruin; 
We were eating freckled pies, seven miles just from 
the skies, 
And trying to mash the man lives in the moon.

Sung by 
the great JOHN REILLY. 
Arrah, give me your attention every one, 
And hear what I've to say ; 
It's all about a 
daughter of mine 
:That's bound to have her way. 
She goes to the theatre every night, 
For the stage sure she's got spooney; 
And now she's got a 
date, and is making out first-rate, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she walks, shure she catches the gawks, 
By my sowl I 
think she's looney ; 
On me she's brought disgrace since she went off her base, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. ( Dance.) 
Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates, 
And I 
ask her for God's sake to give it up, 
She says go away your feet ain't mates. 
Sure the actors all give her the laugh, 
And say that her act is Juney ; 
The gillies she does mash, she gets seven dollars cash, 
For imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
Shure she washed up in Pat Rooney's sponge, 
And stole his dialect; 
She tried to do his funny run off, 
And nearly broke her neck.

Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a 
steeple, 
All the gang will sure be down. 
CHORUS: 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
"Won't there be a

When the gang gets in a 
row; 
one but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
lie will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall.

VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE 
Words and Music by WILL II. Fox. 
Sung by Wm. McALoos in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL & CO1CROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
Cnottus: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
pluck(Al from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old aria chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to rotun; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy clay ; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the tine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coining, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain ; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam ; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love ; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Dance of Cupid may it be, 
Come, love, waltz with me.

Sure I'm a 
high-toned ' ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter -where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS: 
For Maloney's a 
man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
His influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every ore, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Alaloney is the man.

Air.—Empty Cradle. 
Little empty pig pen smells so nice and sweet, 
How the precious burden used to squeal; 
We can have some roast pork and pickled pig's feet, 
And some fresh spare ribs every meal. 
We killed him with a 
knife at the right time of the moor, 
And scrubbed him till the break of dawn; 
Now he's in the barrel, salted for evermore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Piggy's left the swill-trough to eat from it no more, 
O'er the briny water he has flown; 
Gone to join the Boers on Africa's shore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Near the cellar door stands a 
barrel now, 
Overhead the cob-webs are thick; 
It always makes us sad when we think of him now, 
And the many times we scratched him with a 
stick. 
He could play seven up, and draw poker too, 
And sing all the latest songs; 
Now he's in a 
barrel packed forever more, 
Empt2,- is the hog pen piggy's gone.

Tt's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here St 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you cannel ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPoKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many- of me there arc in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw 
tt abcw, ill they wildly ask— 
What is it, &c.

McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes.

This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a

lie broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they hell McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
lie was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died.

Sung by BILLY BIRCH, ESQ. 
I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower, 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross tile 
sea, 
And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
And this little faded dower blossomed on the grassy 
mound, 
For they sent me a 
rose from mother's grave. 
Ctroitus: 
When you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose from mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother could return to me again ; 
I 
would strive then to repay her many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it call, in vain. 
Never more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid Inc hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keel) my little flower ever near where e.er I 
go. 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave.

-: o: 
All the earth is filled with blessing, 
Which no sorrow can destroy, 
And for even,' day of trouble, 
There shall come a 
day of joy; 
There are moments full of silver, 
All the showers from heaven which fall, 
And the tenderness of loving, 
Is the blessing of them all, 
Cno 
Ruts 
Though the clouds may hang above us, 
Somewhere sunlight lingers still; 
And the good of every moment. 
Shall surpas,s 
the moment's ill; 
Love and trust are yet immortal, 
Loving souls immortal, too; 
And the glory of a 
jewel, 
Sparkles in a 
drop of dew. 
Take the dew-drops as God gives them, 
Be they moments be they hours, 
So the stream of life which bears you, 
Shall flow on through banks of flowers; 
There are moments full of blessing, 
As the showers from heaven which fall, 
But the tenderness of loving, 
Is the blessedness of all.

About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But 1 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
lie tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes Abe 
says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor upjown, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum: 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps. he will find it out some future day, 
he'll keep it mum.

dreadful character, in vice I 
go the pace, 
I'll give a 
start to any man, and win an easy race;

crimes, 
Committed theft and perjury at least a 
dozen times; 
I've had my fling at forgery, at felony and fraud, 
And when I 
go marauding, you can bet I 
do maraud ; 
But I 
never condescended, though of crime I've made

You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's safest to swindle the poor; 
For the rich make a 
row, 
But the poor folks we cow, 
So it's safest to swindle the poor. 
If my little game were murder, still I'd keep my maw-

could bribe my poorer brothers—monarchs do the

But you mustn't be a 
villain if you happen to be poor.

MULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN. 
A 
Recitation. 
Written for PAT ROONEY by " Den Morton." 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. 
FISHER. 188. 
The Half-Breeds and the Stalwarts 
Had a 
rough-and-tumble fight, 
The Half-Breeds had Jim Blaine for a 
leader, 
The Stalwarts said Conklin was right; 
Like Kilkenny cats they fought, 
Like bull- dogs, did growl and grin ; 
And though Conklin's friends fought nobly, 
The man from Maine did win. 
Now, I'm neither a 
Half-Breed or Stalwart, 
To no party do I 
belong; 
And though for the spoils they wrangle, 
I 
say both sides were wrong. 
To settle this whole question, 
I 
have an easy plan; 
it is, to make a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcalley's Cousin Dan. 
If Mulcalley's cousin was Senator, 
He'd make a 
change all round; 
No thieving star route jobbers 
In this country would be found; 
Beecher who says that a 
poor man 
Should live upon water and bread, 
Would have to kiss the Plymouth Church ladies, 
While he stood upon his head. 
In the Tombs windy Talmadge, 
Four months, three times a 
year would get; 
I 
would play Billee Taylor 
In the tragedy of Olivette. 
I'd then take Susan Anthony, 
And turn her into a 
man; 
If they made a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
He'd sweep the sLeets of New York with Captain 
Williams, 
He'd then bounce Mayor Grace; 
And make Owney Geoghegan 
Run the City Hall in his place. 
He'd run the 3d avenue cars to Ireland, 
And steamboats to the skies; 
He'd make bran new electric lights 
Out of the crusts of apple pies. 
He'd make Dennis Kearney president, 
Then the Chinese would have to go; 
Christmas would come in summer, 
On 4th of July we'd have snow. 
The Bulls and Bears of Wall street, 
In the Central Park would stand; 
When we make a 
United States' senator of 
Muicahey's Cousin Dan.

THE ABSENT MINDED MAN! 
Written and Sung by A. H. SurimoN. 
I'm troubled and vexed, the reason why— 
I'll now explain to you. 
I'm so forgetful all the time— 
I 
know not what to do, 
When—but a 
little boy of ten— 
If mother sent me out, 
To buy the stuff for baby's pap, 
I 
brought home sourkraut! 
SPOKEN.—It's an actual fact, ever since I 
came into this 
great and glorious world, I 
have been absent minded. I 
am not sure that I 
was ever born. 
Perhaps I 
was hatched 
by steam! I 
will swear I 
do not know who my father was 
—ehl—why—swipes? 
I'm an absent minded man, 
Have been so since my birth, 
And have done naught but silly things, 
Since I've been on this earth. 
The many foolish things I 
do, 
Are hard to understand; 
I've often hunted for my glove, 
When it was on my hand. 
-While riding in a 
Broadway stage, 
I 
met with a 
sad mishap; 
I 
pulled my left hand neighbor's nose, 
Instead of the driver's strap.

I

absent minded. 
Last evening as I 
was returning from the 
Laundry, smoking a 
for de rank a 
peedie segar, I 
felt 
weary, and concluded to retire for the night. 
Well, I 
took 
off my clothes, placed my segar in bed, chucked my 
clothes out of the window, and went to sleep in the wash 
tub—why—because—

You Were False, But 
Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

SUNNY MOUNTAIN HOME. 
This is a 
very popular song in New York. 
Written by " Ben. J. Miles." and sung only by MURPHY & M ILES, the 
great favorites. 
Why did we ever roam from our dear old Irish home, 
The dear old home that was so bright and gay; 
And the friends we left behind to us were good and kind, 
When we left old Ireland for America. 
They kindly cheered us on that bright summer's morn, 
As we parted from our loved ones at the shore; 
We are never free from care for our hearts are ever there, 
In our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin. 
CHORUS. 
Our hearts are never glad, for our thoughts do make us 
sad, 
And it's for our sweet-hearts now that we are caring; 
We do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our sunny mountain home in dear oid Erin. 
We have traveled through this land, and saw places that 
were grand, 
But there's sights to see in Ireland all the same; 
These dear familiar scenes, we can see them in our dreams, 
Around that dear old home from where we came. 
Where the lads are gay and witty, and the girls so sweet 
and pretty, 
The day that we shall see them it is nearing; 
But we do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin. 
(Chorus).

friend a $5 
note. 
CHORUS: 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things I'll quote, 
I'll tell you how I 
spent that e5 note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
Up went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

Grandmother's Chair. 
Written by JOHN READ, and sung with great success as the latest hit os 
the season at HARRIGAN at HART S 
Theatre Comique by EDWIN BARRY, 
Music at E. H. HARDING'S, 229 Bowery, 
Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life. 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was ray wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, • 
A lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, Sm. 
NEVER GIVE WAY TO SORROW, 
Written by JOHN WALen, and sung with great success 
all over the world. 
0:-
Many a 
man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with you be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn; 
Luck someday may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. (Chorus}

I'm not a

I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
I 
can't understand, can you?

Why Russia's great Czar was blown from 1i

I

Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's been married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me,

Now there's General Grant, our Ex-President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a

He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a

Why we have a

There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you?

Your voice is sad when e'er you speak,

To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green,

Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I

That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me,

TOSS THE TURK.

Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Oh! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug-hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hihernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic7nic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh 1 
the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it 1 " 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pie-the when they toss'd the Turk. 
• 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Ohl they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Thor'- the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl. 
Spoken after 3d verse.—" Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, Who are you?' 
Well, says I, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and.

Last Night I 
was Dreaming of You. 
As sung by MR. STANLEY GREY with tremendous success, at the 
SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. 
Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew, 
I 
heard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem— 
Oh vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child.

Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie,

And they jumped together on the floor, 
And•had a

Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't' give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis,

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
As sung with great success by Tcricy PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in New York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen. 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus) 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze. 
(Chorus).

GEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
Words and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN WALsti, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. 
Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame ua, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselve* 
famous„ 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their st2,71
; 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, • 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
lie is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie. 
Chorus. 
(Chorus), 
They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
He's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup.

Pity the poor this cold winter night, 
Keen blows the wind with merciless might, 
Fast falls the snow, oh, turn not away! 
Hunger and want on every hand stray; 
Give of a 
portion heaven has sent, 
Ye who are blessed with wealth and content, 
Ye who have homes so cheerful and bright, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
CHOIVITS: 
Turn not away, give, give of your store, 
Some weary heart make happy once more; 
hark to their cry, their pleading don't slight, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Cheerfully give and God will return, 
Thy brother's call, oh never more spurn, 
Always with us the poor still abide, 
Pass them not by, and turn not aside; 
Shivering forms with no where to go, 
Wearily plod, or crouch in the snow; 
Sparc what you can, if only a 
mite, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. (Chorus) 
-Do what you can, while journeying here, 
Some weary soul we always may cheer, 
Lighten the load of poverty's curse, 
All can spare some, though meagre their purse; 
Blessings and joys your days will pursue, 
Many are poor, the wealthy are few; 
All could be helped, if all give their mite,

The Tramp. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish 1 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He sTaq the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or 
fter we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic-with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
rt is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept

.Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
iiIIMPTY Duatt-rr,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear. 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap• 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
