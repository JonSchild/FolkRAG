TO THE PUBLIC. 
In offering this collection of Songs for the appro-
bation of the Public, I 
beg leave, most respectfully, 
to thank my numerous patrons for their kind sup-
port during my career as a 
Vocalist. 
Entering in 
the Musical Profession, young and inexperienced, 
I 
take the present opportunity of thanking you, 
kindly, for the success which has crowned my 
efforts, a 
success due, not so much to any superior 
ability on my part, as to the leniency with which 
my efforts were received. 
Hoping ever to retain 
this appreciation of my friends and patrons, I 
re-
main the Public's most obedient Servant, 
FRANK LEWIS, 
Epic& Vocalist. 
This '.Vork is Respectfully Dedicated to my esteemed friend, -3IM 
KATIE CAMPBELL, of Philadelphia, with best 
wishes of the Autho:. 
4I 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND ; CAN YOU? 
Written and sung at Harry Miner's Theatre. N, V., by FRANK LEWls, 
with unbounded applause. 
I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why Russia's great Czar was blown from his car, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door? 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
lie's loeen married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But, why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me, 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why our Commissioners haven't seen that our 
streets arc kept clean, 
I 
can't understand it, can you? 
5 
I 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND, CAN YOU?—CONTINUED 
Now there's General Grant, our Ex- President, 
lie fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a 
Tanner; 
He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUs; 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who says 
Grace every day, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little hang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
If John Kelly went back on his brother Democrats 
1 
can't understand it, can you?

THE KINGDOM IN THE SKY. 
A Dream Linvis had one night. 
Sung by him with the Comedy and 
American Four Combination. Murphy & Shannon, 
Murphy 4
R: 
Mack and Company. 
While thinking of a 
subject for a 
song the other night, 
While seated by my cheerful fire which then was blazing 
bright; 
I 
fancied I 
was roaming in a 
kingdom in the sky, 
AID! I 
really saw curious sights, to sing you them I'll try; 
I 
found myself surrounded by all people of renown. 
Who acted as if crazy, and their tricks l've noted down; 
So if you pay attention, while the moments they pass by, 
I'll tell you all the sights I 
saw in the kingdom in the sky. 
Our railroads they stood firm again, our companies took 
more care, 
Politicians they were honest, and acted on the square; 
Olive Logan she went on the stage, in the ballet she was set 
Jake Aberle was looking for a 
place in Garfield's Cabinet ; 
Little Lona played a 
jewsharp, John McCullough danced 
a 
jig, 
Harry Miner shaved his moustache off, because it grew so big 
Kate Claxton was a 
fireman, for fame she soared most high 
And Beecher preached for a 
dollar a 
day in the kingdom 
in the sky. 
Mr. Hayes gave up the President's chair, and temperance 
lectures gave, 
Sammy Tilden said the White House was the only thing 
he craved; 
Garfield he was trading mules through the country far and 
near, 
Francis Murphy and Moody and Sankey they played seven 
• up for beer; 
Joe Emmet joined a 
circus and comic songs he sung, 
Senator Conkling he was getting away -from Sprague's 
barreled gun; 
Tony Pastor was dressed up in tights and playing the 
French Spy, 
John Hart was Barnum's skeleton in the kingdom in the 
sky.

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I 
ltave sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I *ill speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
lie's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A 
Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue crunbined; 
lie was murdered in Washington sonic years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in it 
day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage ha; had yet, 
Ella Mayo's sweet face we should new forget. 
LION BREWERY BEER. 
A 
comic effusion sang by FRANK LEWIS, at Harry Miners 
Theatre, New York. 
The other night while feeling blue, 
I 
thought IA stroll around; 
And see some of the famous sights 
With which this town abounds; 
A 
strange sensation thrilled me, 
And my throat felt dry and queer; 
So I 
stepped into a 
beer saloon, 
To get a 
glass of beer. 
I 
found it so refreshing, 
I 
thought I'd try one more; 
And liking the experiment, 
I 
repeated o'er and o'er; 
Some very funny fancies 
To my mind did soon appear, 
I'll tell you some of the sights I 
saw, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
I 
tu.v the waiters in this house, 
When schooners they (lid bring; 
Peep slyly through the door to see 
If the Cap was on the wing; 
I 
saw spy Kimball on the train 
Where Whitney round (lid tear; 
I3ecause he'd not appear in Court, 
And bring the gamblers there. 
Captain Williams in a 
garbage box, 
Was sentenced there to dwell; - 
And stay until the Judgment day, 
And live upon the smell; 
The Salvation Army the other night 
Were off upon a 
tear, 
They were found up at Harry Hill's, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
LION BREWERY BEER—CONTINUED. 
We had no railroad accidents, 
And stocks were above par; 
Beecher kept a 
beer saloon, 
John B. Gough tended bar; 
I 
saw Conkling commit suicide, 
When Jim Blaine won the race; 
When they both ran like Garfield's nuii 
In his Cabinet for a 
place. 
Steve Taylor and George Rooke I 
saw, 
Fight the other day; 
That is, I 
would have seen them fight, 
But Taylor ran away; 
I 
saw the exhibition start, 
Which Grant is trying to stew; 
I 
saw our dirty streets kept clean 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
But there's one thing I 
will say; 
I 
hope I 
have amused you with 
My quiet little lay; 
I 
hook it for a 
topic, 
To pass the time along; 
And try and sing you something new, 
In the way of a 
comic song. 
There's many times that I've appeared 
Before you one and all, 
A warm and loving welcome 
I've received from great and small; 
So to my New York friends 
I 
now return my thanks again, 
I'll drink your health in a 
social glass 
Of Lion Brewery Beer.

THE BOWERY AND HESTER FIRE. 
Written when the London Clothing Store was on fire. 
Sung by 
FRANK LEWIS to describe scenes on the Bowery, to which 
he appeared to ten encores. 
A week ago while strolling down 
The Bowery by daylight, 
I 
saw a 
clothing store on fire, 
It was a 
fearful sight; 
The smoke hung o'er me like a 
pall, 
But when the wind arose, 
Some funny sights they met my gaze, 
Which I 
will now disclose. 
There was Tony Pastor couldn't move, 
He seemed so jolly fat, 
'Till shot by George Rickert's gun, 
Which wouldn't kill a 
cat; 
Wrapped up in Coogan's banner, 
The sights he did admire; 
Was Talmadge looking for a 
text 
At the London clothing fire. 
There was Billy Cameron trying hard 
Through Mrs. Falk to see, 
Harry Miner trading litho's off 
With great Jack Haverly; 
Cleopatra's needle stalking round, 
The thing that Nicoll wants, 
By his electric light to mend 
His latest style of pants. 
The Atlantic Garden Female Band 
Were trying to play a 
tune, 
The big drum lost her hoopskirt, 
Which was found by the trombone; . 
Pat Rooney lost his diamond ring, 
Which considerably raised his ire, 
They burnt up the Chinese letter 
At the London clothing fire. 
If 
TM: BOWERY AND HESTER FIRE—CosTrNuED. 
From the market down in Hester Strcet 
The bums they came to look, 
They drank some whisky on the way 
They bought of Barney Rourke; 
Mr. Finck the Alderman, he stood 
And brandy wished to take, 
To brace bun up when he should vote 
For John O'Brien's sake. 
The big dwarf at the museum 
The big-headed boy did mash, 
Fred Lubin got his dye-brush out 
And touched up his moustache; 
Owney Geoghe ,Tan's English Boxers 
To a 
black eye did aspire, 
Threw George Hall and Patrick Hickey 
At the London clothing fire. 
Clara Morris she was there, 
With the crowd she had a 
tussle, 
She was struck in the back with a 
beer-keg, 
And it busted her paper bustle; 
Dan Paterson stood up to fight 
A 
round with Buffalo Bill, 
Henry Witt he took a 
Russian Bath 
The beer inside to kill. 
Peter Cooper came to celebrate 
His ninetieth birthday, 
Gordon Bennett had another row 
With little Freddy May; 
Mayor Grace then walked in and sat down 
The ladies to admire, 
Had the seat of his pants burnt full of holes, 
At the London clothing fire.

HAVE YOU SEEN BERNHARDT? 
Sung with great applause at Colisseum Theatre, and Vine Street 
Opera House, Cincinnati, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've been to the North Pole, I've sat me down upon it, 
I've swung around this great, big world, on the tail- end of 
a 
comet; 
I've seen Salvini on the stage poor Desdemona smother, 
Heard Beecher preach, and Talmage screech, and kick up 
such a 
bother; 
I've also been to Salt Lake Town, where poor emigrants 
are wheedled, 
I 
had a 
patch put in my pants by Cleopatra's needle; 
I've seen the pyramids so large, they say was built by Mi-
ro* 
But still I'm behind the times, because I've not seen Sarah. 
Cuonus: 
Have you seen Sarah, none thinner and sparer, 
She can parlez-vous francais with a 
comical squall; 
There's no one can scare her, she is such a 
teaser, 
If you've not seen Sarah, you've seen naught at all. 
I've also been to Washington, with treasury girls been frisky 
With Mr. Hayes in the 'White House, I 
have drank some 
good old whisky; 
I've seen the Passion Play produced, and nothing could is 
finer, 
I 
have a 
pig tail from the head of the Emperor of China; 
I've also heard Bob Ingersoll preach there is no hereafter, 
I've seen the great Hobson & Crane, and they caused me 
so much laught er; 
I've been with Grant around the world, dined with the 
Shah of Cairo, 
But still I 
am behind the times, because I've not seen Sarah. 
CHOR 
US : 
Have you seen Sarah, none thinner and sparer,. 
From clay with her hands she makes babies with 
wings; 
There's no one can scare her, she is such a 
teaser, 
This damsel called Sarah% who does such funny lb

KEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
success, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to- night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, be may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum. 
THE WINNER IN THE END. 
Written and sung with success by FRANK LEWIS at Buckingham 
Theatre, Louisville, Ky., and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N. Y. 
As new songs are all the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
There is many a 
glorious maxim you will find ; 
But there's one more than the rest, seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often it comes stealing o'er my mind; 
So this advice I'll give you all to-night, 
Endeavor to look manly, strong and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's battle's 
fought, 
You'll find you'll be the winner ill the end. 
They are killing Kings and Queens, and tramping down 
the green, 
In Europe all the Monarchs feel afraid; 
That the people they will light, and stand up for their Hold:7 
And on the grunt nobility they'll raid; 
But why don't they come here, where men can live, 
Where freedom ' two all we freely give; 
Where the whole world finds a 
home, leaves Kings unto 
their doom, 
Uncle Sam is always winner in the end. 
In the papers we oft read, of peculiar things, indeed, 
And many changes that we see in life; 
It is custom in this land, for each and every man, 
To take unto himself a 
little wife; 
if there's any lately married here to-night, 
May your fireside be always cosy, bright; 
And if in your future days, a 
flock of boys you try to raise 
I 
hope you'll come out winner in the end. 
About every week or so, we have walking matches, true, 
And one city patronizes them quite free; 
How each pedestrian tries, to gain the given prize, 
And sometimes they succeed most manfully; 
There's Hughes who made the best recorded tl• , e, 
And others have shown a 
record fine; 
But what seems to me so queer, when Rowell does walk here 
We never come out winner in the end. 
GRANDFATHER'S PANTS. 
A Parody on Grandma's Old Arm Chair. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS 
at Comstock's Opera House, Columbus. 
My grandfather, he, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion he would die; 
And after he was dead, of course the will was real, 
By a 
lawyer as we all were passing by; 
Unto my brother Bill, he left an old saw mill, 
To my sister he bequeated our gray mare, Nance; 
But when it came to me, the-lawyer then, said he 
has left to you his old brown pants 
CHORUS: 
But how they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, my dear Isabel; 
Gave me the laugh whene'er she had t 
he chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants. 
My brother Bill one day, just to pass the time away, 
In the river, why he thought he'd take a 
swim; 
When a 
stray goat showed his nose, and he eat up 
poor Bill's clothes, 
It was Summer, and his garments they were thin 
Now Bill he kicked and swore, when he couldn't 
leave the shore, 
And I 
saw his situation at a 
glance; 
I 
give one laugh and yell, I 
said now brother. Bill, 
Don't you wish you had the old brown pants. 
(Chorus).

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG. 
THE $5 
NOTE. 
Writ t 
en and sung with immense success at Olympic Theatre, Chicago, 
by FRANK LEWIS. 
Also the Great Hit in New York. 
This world is hut a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, distinction and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in way behind, and you'll very often find 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
I 
will tell you here to- night, things that pass before my sight 
The migakes of many folks I'll put in song, 
These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
They say, another good man has gone wrong. 
In days that nov., are past, there is one whose name will last, 
As a 
warning strong to hundreds in our land; 
lie was once the Tammany boss, and New York feels his 
loss, 
A 
true friend to the honest workingman; 
Though he robbed our city sure, still he helped our starving 
poor, 
And comfort brought to many a 
pitiful throng; 
'Tis of poor Tweed now I 
sing, but remember just one thing 
He was but another good man that's gone wrong. 
Throughout this glorious land, you will often find a 
man, 
Who has fallen and weaved in a 
depth of crime; 
He possesses manly traits, but is working against fate, 
To a 
life of degradation seems resigned; 
I 
am not out here to preach, but a 
lesson I 
would Wadi, 
A motto I 
would give you in my song; 
Do not pass him with a 
frown, lift him up when he is down 
Ile may have been a 
good man that's gone wrong. 
Our preachers now so meek, they took a 
sudden freak, 
By denouncing an actress of great fame; 
From their pulpits now they preach, and their congrega-
tion teach, 
Sarah Bernhardt is a 
woman of bad name; 
In the town of Montreal, the clergymen there all ; 
Denounced her in language loud and strong; 
But if they'd look more to home, they would find among 
their own, 
There is many a 
good old preacher that's gone wrong. 
so, 
A Comic Song sung by FRANK LEWIS, Esq., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. Written by- FRED SHAW. 
One night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree, 
'tiro drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be; 
My 'cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
So I 
borrowed from a 
friend a $5 
note. 
CHORUS : 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things I'll quote, 
I'll tell you how I 
spent that e5 note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
tTp went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews 'till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A 
poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
his family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

HURRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND! 
Dedicated to HARRY SANDERSON. Originally sung by FRANK LEWIS 
Mnsie published by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price, to eti 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would over go back on a 
friend ; 
Tho dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which through life him attend. 
I 
hear the trumpet sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land-. 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice ; 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band I 
Then Hurrah! then Hurrah! 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
I 
will speak first of one who we loved in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave— 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last (lime, 
If he thought you from hunger stwould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
The tall Son of York, he died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
And the pride !—and the pride ! 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so truo 
'Till defeated at last by grim death ; 
And Budworth, alas ! broke his old banjo string, 
Which he loved 'till he parted With breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
They lived and they died with the Boys that they lov'd, 
The dear Boys of the Minstrel Band ! 
The Dear Boys ! the Dear Boys ! 
The Dear Boys of the Minstrel Band! 
But now I 
must speak of the Prince of them all— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan ! 
Let every one mourn tor our Chieftan is gone— 
Dan Bryant! the Minstrel and Man ! 
_I hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
He lived and he died, both our glory and pride ; 
He was King of the Minstrel Band ! 
He was King ! he was King ! 
He was King of the Minstrel Band

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANK LRwis. 
How the world has wrote the praises of our politicans of fame, Mir— 
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too. have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those Who get no thanks Sir; 
The tide of vietory oft been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A 
trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Vow, I 
think it would be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man. End feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for wine, big suppers and fin. 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our honest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for-
lorn, Sir, 
They meet the ignorant snob's contempt, the haughty rich man's 
scorn Sir; 
But some may go to Congress, and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of our honeseworking classes. 
Now, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And who will not be offended at any insinuations: 
There are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold ea' 
clink of glasses, 
Slut have nobly risen, step by step, from our honest warring C18.9008

)ow a 
few days ago while on things ruminating, 
I 
thought of the present, I 
thought of the past. 
I 
thought of the strange things we're every day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our ireedom ; 
We have not Lafayette, who from France came to fight— 
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third term, just to set matters right. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Gettysburgh's Hero, 
But we have the brave Sherman, vrno marched to the Sea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend— 
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago, 
When the fire fiend upon them made such a 
great raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send you to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom I 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have oar gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's great Hero. 
He strove for his country bright laurels to win. 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have &haat Little Mae, who at Antietam fighting, 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also; 
Ben Butler's still with us, one eye on the spoons— 
And 131.11,nam Young still keeps a

DON'T PLY YOUR RITE TOO HIGH, 
Motto Song.

Bowery, New York. 
Price, 10 cents. 
a 
fellow that's ever kind-hearted, 
And sometimes I've plenty of cash; 
But a 
fool and his money's soon parted, 
For he's happy when cutting a 
dash. 
But of one thing I 
wish to remind you, 
When for sporting and drinking you sigh, 
Yoar best friend you keep in your pocket,. 
And don't fly your kite up.too high. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't fly your kite up too high, boys; 
Don't fly your kite up too high. 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
If you go to a 
friend to assist you, 
He'll say that his money's play'd out, 
But when he was down, you to help him, 
Put your hand in your pocket, no doubt. 
But this world it is cruel and cold, boys, 
Though good times may come by and by; 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
Then don't fly, etc. 
There's many a 
good-natured fellow 
That's been ruined by just what I 
say, 
For if he'd a " Five" in his pocket, 
He'd feel like a 
rich man to- day. 
Just listen to me what I 
say, boys, 
If you've money, put some of it by; 
When your out keep your friend in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
Than don't fly, etc.

LATE TELEGRAM SONG. 
As Sung Originally by Mr. FlIANX LEWIS. 
I 
am going to sing a 
little song, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches that have come o'er land and sea: 
There are some will make you sob and cry, and others make you laugh 
The many funny messages sent through my telegraph. 
The Feniaus have conquered Holland, old Turkey's taken sick; 
They've made an Indian Princess of our good old friend Queen Vic. 
They're impeaching gr. Belknap, because his Agents tried 
To find how long ' twould take to starve a 
soldier, ere he died. 
Dom Ped; o's caught the measles from off the Prince of Wales; 
Ward Beecher has joined the Mormons, so quietness prevails. 
Fred Grant has killed old Sitting Bull, he's earned his monthly pay: 
He left his Pop in Washington, he couldn't stay away : 
The Italian nation have come o'er, they would rather work than beg; 
They spend their time in emptying out each Dutchman's lager keg. 
Boss Tweed has been d'scovered, a 
strange thing you will say; 
He was shoveling garbage from the scows to fill up New York Bay, 
The working men are still crushed down beneath reformei's power; 
They manage just to starve themselves on 20 cents an hour. 
Prince Pismark has a 
Baby, he's now lelt in the lurch; 
The ladies sweet of Boston town, have bought the old South Church, 
Billy Wickham shaved his whiskers off, Dan Drew his debts has paid. 
Dr. Dix has learned the Can-Can along with Whitelaw Reid. 
l3en Butler's lost his larboard eye, so he can see no more; 
•Twas found in Mike Norton's chowder pot, on Coney Island shore. 
Harry Hill has joined the T. A. I3.'s, along with Peter Dwyer; 
The cow has broken loose again that caused the Chicago fire. 
Count Johannes and Doctor Landis have got into a 
fight; 
As to seo which of the two can play the ghost of Hamlet right. 
Sammy Tilden soon will married be and have some babies born; 
Be proposed to Susan Anthony, TennieClaflin and Rate Thorn. 
Mr. Belzebub's arrived in town to visit Uncle Sam; 
And what his business is I'll tell in my next Telegram.

SCENES ON THE BOWERY. 
• 
Dedicated to Mn. HARR,. isiINER, 
tin Original Song, as Sung by FRAM( Lzwts, with im-
mense success. 
I 
have been thro' the streets in each City 
In Germany, Englan i 
and Rome; 
But the street on which I've made this ditty, 
Is the pride of them all here at home. 
From the pole to the great fiery regions, 
Where the sun in its fierceness is seen, 
There is nought like the Bowery for pleasure, 
And in all the great places I've been. 
CHORUS. 
They may talk of the pleasures of Peri*, 
The buildings you see in Berlin; 
The remains of Solomon's Great Temple. 
But the Bowery I 
would rather live in. 
Of course we don't do the Grand Opera, 
With gloves and a 
spy-glass to peep; 
Nor our gents part their hair in the middle, 
And appear like San key's lost sheep, 
But you bring your dear wife or your sweetheart, 
Your sister or mother—with glee, 
You enjoy a 
good song and some lager, 
The Bowery's the place, boys, for me. 
They may talk, Am, 
Is the Homestead of mighty Frank Duffy, 
And our great Harry Howard, so brave; 
The place where he risked his life boldly, 
When the child from the fire he did save. 
'Tis the home of Ton_ Hamblin and Kirby, 
The triumph of Fox as a 
clown; 
The place Tony Pastor coined money, 
And made his big h t 
in the town. 
They may talk, &a. 
'Tis the spot Barney Williams appeared in, 
Our Lingard, aLd many ot the rest; 
And our New York's Great favorite, Gus Williams, 
Whose efforts were crowned with success. 
We have not the Swers as cr. Broadway, 
Nor the damsels of fashion you' l 
see ; 
But for bright eyes and sons of hard labor, 
They can't beat the Old Bowery. 
They may talk, As.

Many Things that Ought not to NI 
An Original Song by PRANK LEwls. 
As sting by him 
at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
There is n,,t 
a .1.1y as we pass thro' this life, 
And I 
think you will with me agree. 
There a 
re many mistakes in this world we do meet. 
And things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that a 
soldier who fought in the war, 
And lost. perhaps an arm or a 
leg, 
Should grind a 
hand-organ to please passers by, 
And for food, on our charity beg ? 
Cuonus. 
These thin s 
should be stopped it this great land of ours' 
Where every man boasts he is free; 
So I 
thought I'd tell you, by words in my song, 
Many things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that each Savings Bank always should break, 
And the depositors receive not a 
dime; 
Is it right, the ladies, striped stockings should wear, 
And knock us poor men out of time. 
Is it right a 
poor workman should wear out his life, 
And earn but one sixty a 
day, 
While some roll in riches, big sinecures hold ? 
These are things that ought not to be. 
Theae things should be, & c. 
Is it right that our army it should be cut down 
To save but a 
dollar or two; 
Was it right to send Custer and a 
few hundred men, 
To be killed by the wild Indian foe; 
Is it right to mix silver with copper and brass, 
And give it to us to make change; 
Is it right to let Spain still give us the laugh. 
When the Virginius we've yet to revenge ? - 
These things should be, &e. 
Is it right that the White House should bear tLe name 
Of Headquarters! where swindles are done; 
Where they steal all they can from a 
poor soldier's food, 
To a 
barrel of whiskey or rum; 
Is it right, when we've millions of acres to spare, 
And all the whole world we could feed, 
That a 
man should be poor, in ; his great land of ours, 
For which our bravo fathers did bleed? 
These thing.; sheald be, &O.

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N. Y. 
Herald, called the " Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, Piltsburg. 
Of course in seareh of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
SPOKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book?" 
SPOKEN.—In regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down Om 
the book. 
El'OKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have ',either 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
funny there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book?"

THE BUSY B'S. 
An Original Song, 
is Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with i- rct. 
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name ; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
Cuouns. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, six; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred. 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee Sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher, to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks of apologies given— 
Will that bring the dead back to life? 
• 
Will that aid the wives and the children 
Of the victims who fell in the strife? 
Cuoints. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
"On a 
gibbet that shall reach the sky, sir . 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B, was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin; - 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, siz, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
I3ut the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill-
- 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
Traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap; 
Though, pefhaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap? 
4 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's.

As Sung by him with Great Success. 
A stands for alphabet, which we learned in school. 
stands for Beecher and old Sitting Bull ! 
And for Belknap, who lately they tried to impeach. 
C 
stands for Custar! he charged on the foe, 
And died where the Big Horn's dark waters flow ! 
And D is the the DulTerin ! the Yacht that we beat. 
And E is old England, which we did always defeat. 
The country which Miss Emma Mine went to cheat. 
Now F is Young Farragut! who nailed to the mast, 
The Flag of his country, so firm and so fast. 
And Fox the great Clown, we have lost evermore. 
And G stands for Garner! who gave up his life 
On board the Mohawk, for to save his dear wife. 
And II stands for Horace, the gr..atest and best! 
Who told all the people they'd better go West! 
And I 
for old Ireland! that gem of the sea. 
J is John Morrissey, the workingman's friend ; 
And K is King Pedro! who home we did send. 
And L is Liberty! for which we fought. 
III is a 
Morman, who ten wives can stand! 
N is Napoleon, who found his Sedan! 
0 is Old Brigham! not lone and forlorn — 
For to him each morn a 
baby is born! 
And I' the Prince of Wales, who went Tigers to shoot-
Q is Queen Victoria! an Empress now made. 
it is bold Reno! of the foe not afraid; 
He fought the red demons as a 
soldier should fight. 
And S 
is the Surplus there never will be, 
'Ti. - the poor man on Sunday the big show can see. 
'1 is Tom Scott! he's of Railroads the King. 
U is Ulysses! the Chief of the Ring ! 
But he'll soon leave the White House, which will be a 
big 
thing. 
V that is Virtue, a 
thing now forgot ; 
Go search the world over and you'll find it not ; 
Our Congressmen, certain, did out -the name blot. 
But W stands for a 
man with a 
name, 
The greatest of all, in the Temple of Fame !— 
Tic braved every tyrant, our freedom he won— 
God bless him, forever, our cwn Washington! 
The bravest of all since the world it begun. 
X stands for example, if you leave out the E. 
And V the Young Ladies, who around me I 
see— 
At the bottom of most trouble they are always the cause. 
And Z is the Zenith of all things—the end— 
Which a 
man surely feels if he has not a 
friend. 
And now that I've sung my Alphabet through, 
I, for your kind attention, respectfully thank you, 
And I 
hope I've deserved your kind applause, 
Sung Originally by Mr. FRucx LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre. 
Up, up, with the banner of Freedom, 
Which a 
Century ago was unfurled; 
And now we'll invite every nation 
To 
j °in in our oy through the world. 
And France tha. dear country we'll welcome, 
That gave us the grea Lafayette; 
And reland's sweet anner, we'll greet it— 
Patrick Henry we ne'er can forget. 
CHORUS. 
We will welcome the world to our qandard, 
Let them come o'er mom. Min and sea; 
Comejoin with our sons in their gladness, 
Welcome all to the land of the Free. 
Up, up, with the banner of Freedom, 
To England we'll give warm our hand; 
Remember that our great forefathers 
Did come from that old Mother-land. 
Let Russia, each stout sou send over, 
And come from each ice covered plain; 
Let us not forget that Columbus, 
He sprung from the dear land of Spain. 
We will welcome the world, he. 
Up, up, with the banner of Freedom,

WHERE IS 0AtiEY HALL? 
The hit of the season, as sung for three consecutive months at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelehia, by FRANK 
LEWIS. 
Written after the sudden disap-
pearance of OAKEY HALL. 
We read in the papers every day some one does disappear. 
The people all will run away and none be left I 
fear; 
Father Adam left his garden, and Eve could not prevail, 
To make him stop a 
moment when he saw the serpent's tail. 
Now Jonah hid himself one day in the tail-fin of a 
shark, 
.1oss Tweed lie travelled o'er the sea but only for a 
lark. 
The railroad engineers have struck, and for higher wages call, 
The Reading Road is going to smash, but where is Oakey Hall ? 
The policemen, so the prisoners say, they think that clubs are 
trumps, 
Dr. Landis took a 
blue glass pill to cure him of the dumps; 
Jim Bennett is in Europe fighting duels o'er the sea, 
Steve Nash has signed the temperance pledge and joined the 
T. A. B.'s. 
Geo. W. Childs each and every day does affecting rhymes indite, 
He's the champion poet of them all, who epitaphs do write; 
Peter Cooper's wind-bag lately burst, when the price of glue did 
fall, 
They're killing goats for the alms-house poor, but where is 
Oakey Hall ? 
Bill McMullen joined the Free Love Church, he with the box 
goes round, 
But when the eollection is turned in there's nothing to be 
fotulds 
FRANK LEWIS'S Great Song. 
'TWAS a 
cold winter's night, when King Frost held the swa,r. 
And darkness it reigned all around, 
A 
mysterious man with revenge in his mind, 
Did wait till his victim was found, 
Waiting, he'd sworn he would wait till the dawn, 
For the man who had promised to wed 
The sister he loved, and he vowed in his wrath, 
He would " punch" the young editor's head. 
At last a 
tall figure appeared on the steps, 
As down to his sleigh he did hie, 
But he scarcely had gained the sidewalk, ere a 
blow 
Caused him in the glitter to lie. 
The mysterious man cried " Revenge I 
will have 
And the wrongs of my sister efface." 
And " May" to " December," he quickly did turn 
In a 
map on the editor's face. 
Fighting, they fought, as young heroes did tight 
In the glorious days of old Greece. 
When to part them, alas, not a " cop" was in sight, 
Nor a 
blue-coated squad of police. 
The poor man was lifted up by his friends, 
They his story of wrong tried to draw, 
lie muttered, " The girl I 
did love as my life 
But could not stand that old mother-in-law." 
The scene it is changed to a 
bleak turnip field, 
And grim death, hovered high in the air. 
Not knowing which State, human blood would be she4„, 
Maryland, or the great Delaware. 
Slaughter, yes that was the name of the town, 
Where the foemen were ready to fight, 
But they stood such a 
distance, where the seconds them placed 
That they seemed for to be out of sight. 
Blood-thirsty, you bet, for red blood it was shed, 
The foeman they can't explain how. 
At the word, quick they fired, but a 
strange thing to say, 
The only man shot was a 
cow. 
Go;don Bennett he winked, Fred May blew his nose, 
Their hearts with forgiveness did swell, 
They threw down their pistols, ran quick o'er the snow, 
Into each others arms quick they fell. 
Dr. Phelps then his surgical instrument drew, 
Not a 
ball from the men to pull back, 
But to put it by far, to a 
much better use, 
A cork from a 
bottle extract. 
They 
did shake hands, ana soon started for home, 
With blood-thirsty duels content, 
Jt.thd the world still moves on, though the battle is 0'01".

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying ' Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best.. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
"'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
Its no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert;. 
And our politicians all for their living shout „.-./1 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"To the aernagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March 'twill be all right, I 
sa) 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
Far, supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
took it from the r14 4.44 give the poor! 
1,41,  
35 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please: 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

THE PATRIOT'S DREAM. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music Pub. E. H. HARD/NG, 229 Bowery, N. 
Written and adapted by FRANK LEWIS, 
Ole morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
On a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate; 
When sleep o'ercatne me for a 
time, 
A 
dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes! 
I 
raised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pass'd, in strange array, 
A 
great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
They e 
shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft — she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
(Intl the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men of Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
*And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop, 
By Freedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle stall.:. 
• 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steed 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift! 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn; 
And still their hearts with patriot fire 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold, 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no nfore 
Our glorious Constitution, boys! 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling! 
I 
saw old Independence Hall, 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
" 'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six--
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag, and proudly said— 
" 
It has the woll 
defied !"

THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
Mn. FRANK LEWIS' Great Original Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
Wonderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free, 
The stars and stripes which brightly wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
It floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mire, 
It filled brave men in every clime with patriotic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Green! 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen. 
It stood on Bunker's Mountain Coast, where Warren nobly died, 
And in the cause of Freedom boys, it all the world defied. 
It spread its folds at Valley Forge, 'mid storm of rain and snow; 
It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washington it placed its wings, as In the beat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flood. 
It brightly waved at DAlyrnount, when Gildersleeve he shot; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down 'mid screams of wild despair, 
It proudly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there. 
ts folds protected Sheridan when he did swiftly ride; 
Tit went with Sherman to the sea, when he to conquer tried. 
Defending it young Ellsworth fell, and free without a 
stain. 
It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott at Lundy's Lane. 
It went with Rough and Ready against a 
foreign foe; 
Its shadow spread destruction o'er the plains of Mexico: 
And down with Jackson, in the South, behind his cotton bales, 
That starry emblem was unfurled 'till victory prevailed. 
It floats on every foreign shore, our own beloved flag! 
And curses light on him, my boys, who low its folds would drag; 
On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped by our tars; 
On land each Freedom's loving Son does bless its Stripes and Stars! 
But brighter, boys, it ne'er did shine, than when the people all, 
Met on the Fourth of last July, in Independence Hall— 
And raised that banner to the clouds with loud triumphant cry— 
That just one hundred years had passed, since it did the world defy, 
THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
As sung by hint 
with Great Success. 
A comical story I'm going to tell you, 
• I 
wrote it to please both the great and the Small; 
• 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced by Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you can bet at the Actor's Great Ball! 
4 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he took 
Lester Wallach, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave theat 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced tb! Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her fiigs used in singing, 
And Sot smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Aden do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his b - der, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar. e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett & Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the daylights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned 'gainst the wall. 
Harrigan & Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
And that put an sandf.t
ottators Groat Ball!

friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh! if the sun of prospority

So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow way fall unto you,

What if, when youlad not a

Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they want . d

You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a

You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted

Frank Lewis's Great Local Statue Song. 
As sung by him at the different Theatres with success. 
WE are erecting many statues to great people in our land, 
And well I 
love to honor them, a 
noble gallant band. 
In Union Square stands Washington, the chief who made out 
name, 
And honest Abraham Lincoln, almost of an equal fame. 
And in the centre Lafayette beholds the noble work, 
And fifty others proudly stand, in the City of New York. 
So I 
myself have made a 
list of men who fame have won, 
That should have statues made for them, for things which they 
have done. 
So now I'll open out my list, and tell you in my song, 
The position that each statue holds, as best to him belongs. 
I'd have Belknap cheating soldiers out of rations every day, 
And Mr. Schenck slipping the cut, when poker he did play. 
I'd have a 
crucible fast tied on the back of Oakey Hall, 
And Grant a 
smoking a 
cheap segar, with two bull-dogs great 
and small. 
I'd have Harriet Beecher Stowe, f,,st tied on the back of Byroni 
• 
Ghost, 
And Sankey's hundred sheep, served up in one big mutton roast. 
I'd have an Alderman in great surprise, putting on a 
nice clean 
shirt, 
A Policeman seeking danger, where there's no chance to be hurt. 
A 
Ballet Girl with nothing on, whirlinE,- round upon her toes, 
Each Politician sat: in jail, playing chequers with his nose. 
I'd have Pet:r Cuopeez Grcenbaths, spread around like the 
:'.)''uns' ray 
And every workingman shouE earn, lot of them every day. 
I'd ha-.'e 
Ben. Butler vith hi hs,rboam eye, out upon a

IT IS SURE TO PAY IN THE 
Orignal Motto Song, Sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
SOME hundreds of mottoes to you have been sung, 
But this I 
can greatly defend, 
It teaches you all to act upright and square, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
Wherever your pathway may lead you through life, 
_ Unto this great maxim attend, 
Do unto others as you would be done by, 
And it is sure to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, while life it shall last, 
And the true workingman I' 
defend, 
Stand firm by the Anvil, the Axeoane the Plough, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
Let the nobleman boas 1 
ol his wealth and his name, 
Of tho honor hi:. ancestors won, 
Let the general who gains, on the battle-field fame, 
Proclaim thc great deed:: ho ha; done, 
Let the miser count over hi: thousands 
gold, 
To th) clolinrs :7avec: close Atend.

I'll stand by  
Our great politicians, the people do cheat, 
Our congressmen, draw their back pay, 
When their pockets are full, and they get all they can, 
from the country they quickly away. 
Out the laboring man is our safeguard and ho'pe, 
The nation must on him depend, 
Though his troubles are great, aria his life it is hard, 
It is sure to pay in the enu. 
I'll stand by my, &e. 
The men who wear broad-cloth, and in diamonds do shine, 
And at poverty they look with scorn, 
They had better the wages of fraud decline, 
Or better by far ne'er been born. 
'Tis better the dry loaf of honesty eat, 
When a 
dollar well earned you can spend, 
Live truthful and honest, and you will find at last, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my, ie. 
An origninal song, sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Theatre 
Comique, St. Louis, Mo., with rounds of applause. 
In the century now gone, there has been many battles won 
And upon this subject I 
will take my text; 
From things that are absurd, this idea to me occurred— 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next ? 
When this world it first began, Father Adam was the man, 
lie lived alone—which made him much perplexed; 
So a 
rib he gave away, a 
nice wife to make, they say, 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
Mr. Moody lost a 
sheep when the shepherd was asleep, 
And Sankey counted only ninety-nine; 
Anna Dickinson wrote a 
play on the topics of the day, 
Gordon Bennett's roaming in a 
foreign clinic. 
The ladies in our land, they have formed a 
temperance band, 
But their husbands only stronger cocktails mixed; 
Theodore Tilton, it is said, has been getting in the wrong bed, 
I 
wonder what he's going to do next ? 
They've made a 
saint of Brigham Young, so many babes to him 
belong, 
Sent Quakers to fight the Indian foe; 
They let Custer lose his life, in the battle's deadly strife, 
Because they had no soldiers there to go. 
They have lowered the poor man's pay—he but a 
dollar gets 
a 
day! 
While the heads of each department are well fixed; 
When their swindles are found out, they laugh at us and shout) 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. E. DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
,1 often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
Ho tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our dea, 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick and 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat, 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hour, 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
his emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
Re swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
`The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wasegurPd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burnineelime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they etV, God bless that dear old flag!

GIVE BREAD TO THE POOR. 
WE 
WANT A 
PRtSibEgT, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates. 
Now I 
show no partiality, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present-taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
man who'll bring us back, the good old-times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land, and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe. for our next President. 
Our Country is a 
glorious one, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions, last September at Creedmoor 
But to make our rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in office who will violate their trust, 
By shielding " Crooked Whiskey Rings," or doing things unjust 
We care not for their politics, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
We want a 
true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want no men who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And trieN to thro-.7 our hone-t 
name forever In the shade. 
We've had enough of 'Useless Grant, and his relations too, 
We, want a 
man who'll keep his oa"i and the constituti-n too. 
Iro do not want a 
wooden man, we do not want a 
fool, 
We want a 
man with :omr.-ton 
who can't be made a 
tool, 
We want a 
man like Washington, who never stole a 
cent,

)..E1 sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
, 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though 'tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of the many poor families who had nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Itaaven, " Prive bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
ho some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot, gave his office for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at their ease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
stood Governor Wade. .1:alluPtiwa giving bread to the poor. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
Give me the man with an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be, 
He may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me; 
He may not wear a 
silken vest, 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest heart, 
his nature's all to me. 
CHORUS. 
All praise then be to him 
Who acts a 
noble part, 
For a 
right good man is he, 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What if a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor ; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank, 
They are bubbles on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not honest be. 
All praise then, etc. 
Now if he owns an honest heart, 
So gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er; 
A 
better man to find. 
Then give to every man his due, 
Who acts an honest plan, 
It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then, etc.

GIVE A 
THOUGHT TO THE HONEST WORK. 
INGMAN. 
An original song sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Grand Central 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
This is a 
world of luck and chance, of losses and of gain, 
Some lives are filled with pleasure, while others naught but pain, 
If yours is filled with comfort enjoy it while you can, 
But sometimes try and give a 
thought to the honest workingman, 
There's many a 
mighty millionaire who now sleeps in his grave, 
Who never gave a 
single dime the laboring man to save, 
Of such as these to sing about ' tis not my aim or plan, 
For I'll sing of men who gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There is one, who though in wealth he rolled, whose charity 
was sure, 
And the clink of his bright yellow gold was music to the poor, 
And many a 
cheerless hearthstone by his kindness was made 
bright 
In noble deeds of charity that never saw the light. 
By some beloved, by some adored,. by others fawned around, 
He turned not to the right or left but nobly stood his ground, 
In every mrghty enterprise each project or each plan, 
George Peabody always gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There was a 
man who rose to fame and fortune, swift and sure, 
Whose name will be remembered in our hearts forevermore; 
Though wealth rolled in his coffers for years on every hand, 
He shared it with the hungry and the poor of this bright land. 
He was a 
Nature's nobleman if ever there was one, 
A 
tender, loving husband, a 
kind and gentle son; 
His bright face we will see no more, forget him now who can? 
Abe Lincoln always gave a 
thouglit to the honest workingman, 
THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my fire so bright, . 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet mnsic from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Daddy " Rice in ecstacy, those lQgs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow ;" 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twas down the house 
he'd brig, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-known faces came to fill my minstrel's dream, 
Nelso Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
A 
friend to every one in need, the minstrel's ftworite child, 
How oft I've heard his merry laugh, as he made the nielt pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever set the audience in a 
roa-, 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
man, 
The glory of the boys in black—the merfrlaughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed me by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
Re cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the Bryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by, 
And Unsworth gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar to us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Epli Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, lie threw a 
radiant gleam 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream. 
Sung originally by FRANK LEWIS, at the Holliday Street 
Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
In New York they had a 
carnival which did not come off well, 
Like man, things in that great town, " King Rex" was but a 
" 
sell ;" 
Mr. Barnum will ten thousand give, if he can run across 
And find the mystery of the age—the long-lost Chancy Ross. 
They say that three beds you must have if iquor you will sell, 
The law of the Excise reads you must keep a 
large hotel; 
You dare not to a 
laborer a 
glass of lager give, 
In fact a 
workingman has now no earthly chance to live. 
You know there's been a 
mighty strike throughout our own 
dear land, 
And brothers fought with brothers brave, when as foemen they 
did stand; 
'Twas not against the soldiers the strikers stood at bay, 
But the railroad kings who grind them down to seventy cents 
a 
day. 
We ask for peace and friendship, and hope none will destroy 
The flag that now protects our land—both woman, man and 
boy; 
We also ask that rich men all a 
fair day's pay will give, 
For it's only right a 
workingman should have a 
chance to live. 
Our great Beecher he a 
sermon preached, a 
few short years 
ago, 
That men should guns to Kansas take, to shoot down every 
foe; 
I 
thought it a 
strange doctrine (scarcely Christian, by the way,) 
That he should think the laboring man, who gets but a 
dollar a 
day, 
Should live on bread and water, with his wife aivi children 
dear, 
While he himself does drink his wine, and thousands gets a 
year; 
Let him try bread and water once, and a 
new sermon he will 
give, 
He'll say it's riifitt a 
workingpan should have a 
chance to live. 
A 
true illustration of life, written expressly for FRANK LEWIE 
by BOBBY NEWCOMB, America's Character Artist. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little sum; 
He says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few mepths before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with mo dine, drink or smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'd 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
Thesirls all so fair, admired my hair, 
It—was auburn—before it was red; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." • 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to ]ea, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time. 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day, 
A poor goose with a 
golden grail_

Our ACTORS and ACTRESSES that are Gone. 
Respectfully dedicated to Mr. W. H. 
MORTON, 
Theatre Comique, Washington, D. C. 
A 
companion song to the Minstrel Band, an original Bong, 
as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athenteum, Boston, Mass. 
I 'HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Uusworth, 
And Eph. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a 
token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on these boards, 
But whose memory shall never be dead. 
C
IIORUS. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall last, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to the land of the blest. 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has wore.

OUR ACTORS OF THE PAST. 
As originally sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Howard Athenmum, 
Boston, Mass. 
- 
I 
have told you of the minstrel of our past and by-gone day, 
• 
I 
will sing you now of actors great who from us have passed 
away, 
Of men who trod the mimic stage, our glory aud our pride, 
Of women who have shown so bright, and all the world defied. 
No more will Burton's merry laugh, as " Toodles," greet our ears, 
No more George Holland, in " Rosedale," awake our smiles or 
tears; 
No more will Mrs. Conway her brightest comedies play, 
She was an actress of the past, one of the by-gone day. 
No more as " Sir Giles Overreach" will our great Davenport 
stand, 
Nor yet matilde Heron as " Camille " entrance the land. 
No more. will Lucille Western as " Poor Nancy Sykes" defy 
The Brutal husband she still loved and yet not fear to die. 
No more will dear old Ben de Bar with joy the footlights see, 
Nor G. L. Fox, the king of clowns, " Humpty Dumpty" act for 
me. 
And Charlotte Cushman we will love while life itself shall last, 
Though as " Meg Merillies" she has gone a 
bright actress of the 
past. 
No more Claude Burroughs speak his lines, our hearts with 
love inspire, 
He fell with Murdock 'midst the flames a 
victim to the fire. 
No more will Barney Williams as the " Connie Soogah" stand, 
Within the fairy circle with his Colleen hand in hand. 
No more will Mark Smith tune his note to sing his jovial song, 
Ned Forrest face the footlights where his gloric as fame be-
longs; 
No more will Edwin Adams his " Enoch Arden" play, 
A 
brilliant actor of the past from us now torn away.

ALWAYS HELP THE POOR, 
Written by CHARLES BURKE, for FRANK LEWIS, and sung by 
him with marked success. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure 'tis to have a 
man extend the hand 
Of friendship to you, when perhaps a 
stranger in his land; 
But greater still to know and feel on him you can depend, 
Who proves by acts, and not mere words, the value of a 
friend. 
Then never turn your back upon a 
man because he's down, 
But always lend a 
helping hand with smiles and not with 
frowns; 
Let him but think that happiness is yet for him in store, 
And he will bless the giver, boys, who always helps the poor. 
There's the poor boys, one and all, they've many noble traits, 
The millionaire might well be proud to have within his gates; 
The poorest bootblack on our streets may yet gain wealth and 
fame, 
And smile to hear them say, he once was poor, but that's no 
shame. 
Upon the crossing of the streets you'll find them every day, 
Some with barely clothes enough to keep the cold away; 
Yet happiness is beaming upon each face secure, 
For well they know they're numbered to be helped among the 
poor. 
There's the working-girls, God save them from poverty and 
shame, 
A 
cruel word in idle jest might blacken their fair name; 
Then do them all the good you can, and ne'er let it be said— 
You gave them cause to wish themselves as numbered with the 
dead. 
From midnight until early dawn you'll find some hard at work, 
While others in the stores, by day, they gain their bread as 
clerks; 
They do the best they can to keep the wolf from out their door, 
Some future day God will repay the man who helps the poor. 
HITS ON THE TIMES, 
57 
As sung by FR.ANK LEWIS, at Irving Hall, N. Y. 
Here's my latest batch of telegrams that's come o'er land and 
sea, 
From the snow-clad hills of Greenland to the fields of Tennes-
- 
see; 
There's some very funny incidents transpiring every day, 
And which I'll tell you in my song, but don't you give them 
a 
way. 
We've had some funny lawsuits in this, onr glorious town, 
But the strangest one that I 
have heard, and the latest going 
'round; 
Count Joannes he has lately sued our Sothern for damage done, 
Because, as a 
crushed tragedian, he the Count's great fame has 
won. 
Our ex-President, now in Europe, is in that land across the sea, 
lie treads upon a 
foreign shore, so gallant and so free; 
Whether Russia or old Turkey in their struggle may be right, 
Our General Grant, the soldier bold, can show them how to 
fight. 
Some did not like him as a 
President, but this much we can 
say— 
That he did his duty nobly in the thickest of the fray; 
God bless him on his journey, for he is a 
warrior brave, 
And well he fought in days gone by, our country's flag to save. 
We're having strange scenes in our courts, a 
case occurred last 
week, 
Where two fathers tried, at the same time, a 
little girl to seek; 
Now I 
know there's many children who do not their father 
know, 
But one to have two at a 
time is a 
curious thing to show. 
Still I'm glad she's not lost to the stage, but give her genius 
scope, 
She'll become, like Clara Morris, the people's pride and hope; 
I'm sure that in the future Mabel Leonard will be seen— 
The brilliant actress of her day, upon the stage a 
queen. 
SS 
I'll Laugh! And that's Always the 
Last of It, 
Original Music by PROF. Jes. KENNEDY. 
Sung by M R. 
FRANE LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'Tis my maxim in life to a% oid care and strife, 
And to walk through this world with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile. 
Let us live by the way, think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You will act a 
wlse part if you take to your heart, 
Avery bright ray of light that is shining. 
CHORUS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away cart, 
I 
regret not my life what is past of it; 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try; 
rit laugh I 
and that's the last of it. 
If the girl that I 
love, she should false to me pro's, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble, would try. 
i'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe ever scorning; 
Though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cloud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for despair, ire. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the sweet cup of joy I 
would quaff;-
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame, 
But my manhood I'd rouse wi.h a 
laugh; 
}Tot a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could borrow; 
I'd with patience abide, ' till the turn of the tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a 
fig for despair, &a.

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE, 
Motto Song. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
This world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power. 
All others to throw in the shade. 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction, he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss, 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clear., 
My idea for improvement is this. 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
They are willing to toil, let us give them the chance 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too. 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
de.And the prospect at present looks blue. 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our Lang? 
It is something that ought to he clone. 
60 
PENNSYLVANIA'S FAVORITE SONS. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, with great success. 
I'll sing to you of men so great we lost with deep regret, 
And men whose present deeds are such we never "shall forget, 
Whose names are written boldly on the title page of fame, 
That our children in the future might seek for such a 
name. 
To lead an honest, upright life some people think it hard, 
It is the sure and only way our future peace to guard; 
Look always on the brighter side as the sands of life it runs, 
You may be numbered e'er you die with Pennsylvania's favor-
ite sons. 
Ned Forrest formed the actor's home, a 
rest for poor old men; 
Whose life was passed upon the stage, a 
home he made foi 
them; 
Great Curtin, our war Governor, each regiment well manned, 
Stephen Girard he won a 
name when he our college planned. 
Sam Randall, now our Speaker, in this State first did live, 
And the patriots in the days of old did freedom to us give; 
Our library stands supreme, more thanks to Dr. Rush, 
Who left a 
million dollars cash that none its power could crush. 
In this State John Morton lived, in it " Thad." Stevens died, 
From here brave Hancock went to fight when he the foe defied; 
Within this town Ben. Franklin lies, the glory of all.men, 
I 
glory when I 
sing to you ye sons of William Penn. 
Plc:dace Binney was a 
lawyer great, and many cases won, "lib 
James G. Blaine, now great in Maine, is Philadelphia's favorite 
son; 
'Tis here that liberty was born and tyrants met their fate, 
It is the pride of free-born men our noble " Keystone State."

IIMPTY DL1MPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by al, 
the _Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"Au ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordel 
has been sent us, called ' HumprY DIMIPTY, and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking if 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phi/a. Evening Bulletin.
