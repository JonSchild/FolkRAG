[Harold Spivacke's recommendation that the Library
authorize the recording expedition, with an estimate of
the cost]
Lomax, John
Division of Music March 17, 1939
I recommend that the Library authorize Mr. John A. Lomax to set out on a recording
expedition for the Archive of American Folk-Song. In addition to the loan of a recording
machine, Mr. Lomax should receive mileage and per diem allowance.
According to the estimates furnished by Mr. Lomax, the following will be the approximate
sums necessary for the trip:
3550 miles at five cents per mile $177.50
50 days at $5. per day 250.00
200 blank discs 150.00
Miscellaneous expenses (needles, etc.) 25.00
$602.50
These expenditures are to be charged to Increase.
Chief, Division of Music
