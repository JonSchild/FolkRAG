Good Old Days of Adam and Eve
GOOD OLD DAYS OF ADAM AND EVE
Arthur Meyer Lily Dale, N.Y., 1941
When this world was first made over Fields of corn, perhaps some clover, Great big trees
for the cows to go under Protect them from the lightning and thunder Heigh ho, and I can
but grieve For the grand old days of Adam and Eve.
Now they've got their big high steeples Bells in the top to frighten the peoples Temperance
societies and all corporation Everything that is vexation Heigh ho, and I can but grieve For
the grand old days of Adam and Eve.
