No, Sir, No [Textual Transcription]
2591 B1
NO, SIR, NO
Tell me one thing; tell me truly; Tell me why you scorn me so. Tell me why when I ask a
question, You always answer “No.”
Chorus:
“No sir, no sir, no sir, no; No sir, no sir, no sir, no sir.”
My father was a Spanish merchant; And before he went to sea, He told me to be sure and
say “No.” To all you asked of me.
Chorus:
If we should walk into the garden And pluck flowers white as snow; If I should ask you if
you loved me, Would you then say “No”?
Chorus:
Sung by Mrs. Grace Lungino, Huntsville, Texas, May, 1939.
