"Anything to get out of the 
house." 
Sleighrides on planks 
Household chores: dried * 
apples on a tin roof over 
the kitchen; they'd sell 
them at the local store to 
buy their fall shoes. 
Drying green beans by 
stringing them on a string 
or spreading them on a cloth.

Making dried pies. 
Growing their own vegetables: 
She didn't care for picking 
shell heans. 
The family: she was the 
sixth child in the Green 
family. Her family farm 
has changed; "it just don't 
look like home no more." 
Quilting done at home; they 
tacked more quilts than they 
quilted because it was easier. 
They needed the quilts to 
keep warm and used about 
three on one bed. They used 
cotton, blankets, and wool 
from the sheep as filler 
in the quilts. She never 
quilted with a church group. 
Began making rugs in 1969- 
Jessie Cooley encouraged her 
to start weaving and showed 
her all she knows about rug 
making. Someone from 
Burlington Mills may have 
taught Mrs. Cooley how to 
weave. 
Time of year to weave: fall. 
Time of day to weave: morning 
and evening. She tries not 
to stay with it for a long 
time. 
Family response to weaving: 
They want her to have a 
pastime.

Doing the laundry. Washed on 
a washboard. Sun does 
something for clothes that 
a dryer can never do. 
Time of year for canning. An 
old saying is that if it 
frosts or a frost is predicted, 
cut the vine from the potato

rain will drive the frost into 
the potato and ruin the taste. 
It must be true because she's 
heard too many old people say 
it. Starts canning in July

"was the sorriest thing to 
hoe corn."

Made 40 tops during one winter. ^ 
Made a quilt lining out of small 
smoking tobacco sacks. She's 
given a lot of the tops away.

Loves to quilt and crochet, hut 
she can't crochet. She can

She's quilted all her life. She 
didn't piece as much when she 
was raising kids. There ain't 
much I like to do around the 
house. I love to make quilts 
and work outside. 
Quilts in the winter. Helps 
him with the chores. Works on 
quilts in the evening. Can't 
watch television while she's 
quilting. The Lone Star is 
hard to put together. She 
pieces each point and then 
puts them together. Wants 
to try Round the World—"the 
prettiest thing I've ever 
seen." 
Family response to the quilting. 
The girls work with quilts. 
Her daughter at Laurel Fork 
pieces hers with the machine. 
The machine draws up the

Fabrics used for tops. Polyester. 
Uses any kind of scraps she can 
get. Gets her fabrics from 
family and neighbors. Doesn't

Filler. Quilting padding has 
gotten "hateful." She uses 
blankets from Chatham Blanket 
Factory. That makes a good 
quilt. Padding will wad up; 
the blanket is easier to quilt. 
The blankets are made from wool 
or cotton. Bought enough blanket 
for three quilts for $3-00. 
The needle just slips through 
that stuff when you quilt. 
She used to buy wool quilt padding; 
now they have the cotton and she 
doesn't like it. She carded her 
own wool to put in the quilt. 
Wool will stay puffy, but it 
does work through the fabric. 
Her mother used to fix all her 
quilts with wool. She made 
her children help her pick the 
wool.

Polyester is good, but it is

Favorite patterns. Lone Star. 
Bow Ties. Squares. Tree. 
Wheel quilts. Ed's sister-in-law 
gave her this pattern. Lone 
Star came from a neighbor. She 
perhaps got the Bow Tie from her 
Aunt. Log Cabin. Makes people 
cut her a pattern when she sees 
a quilt she likes. She doesn't 
like the applique quilt; they 
take too much fabric. She 
has never done an applique. 
Starts a quilt. Snowball quilt.

Quilting patterns from thebox 
of patterns. Lone Star pattern 
cut from sandpaper. Log Cabin 
She wants to get some new 
patterns from her neighbors. 
She doesn't use applique patterns 
from books. 
She couldn't quilt one winter 
because she was too busy helping 
her husband. 
Setting up the quilt. She hangs 
the quilting frame in the 
front bedroom. She quilts 
alone; sometimes her daughter 
helps her. She doesn't like 
to tack quilts. Tacking is 
faster. Never quilted in a 
group. She has never had an 
opportunity to quilt in a group. 
What makes a quilt attractive. 
Pattern is important. Trip 
around the world. 
Quilting. Some are laid off in 
fans. The fans are prettier. 
Others are quilted according 
to the pattern. Set up the 
fans with chalk. Her husband 
lays off the fan pattern for 
her. She makes out she can't 
do it. Crayon is easier to 
use to mark them off. 
Washes her quilts. She washes 
them once a year. If she 
thinks a quilt will fade, she 
takes it to the dry cleaners.

Airing them out does them as

How to quilt. Several stitches 
on the needle at one time. 
Pulls the knots through the 
lining and leaves the thread 
hanging. The hardest part 
is putting them in the frames. 
She uses clamps in her frames. 
Mother had her frames made 
for her. 
Hemming the quilt. She turns 
the lining over the top or 
turns the top over the 
lining. She hardly ever uses 
the binding. 
Why do you like to quilt. 
She just loves to mess with 
quilts. She hasn't changed 
her quilting style. She 
sometimes quilts in rows. 
Conclusion. "I'd rather quilt 
than eat." 
Terry Eiler talking to Carrie. 
"This is a pretty old house." 
The ceiling was hand dressed 
with a plane. Planing is 
hard work. They've been in 
this house for seventeen years. 
The barn across the road used 
to be a schoolhouse. They 
lived in Laurel Springs before 
they moved here. This place 
is prettier and more convenient. 
It's easier to get out to the 
road from this house. She used 
to live in a place where you 
had to pack in your supplies. 
Children had a hard time getting 
to school.

Young doctors. Midwives. She 
had a midwife for all her 
children except one. Her 
grandmother was a midwife. 
The midwife made you stay in 
bed for nine days. 
Grandmother prepared dinner; 
Mommie made supper. She 
can't use her right hand to 
milk anymore since she broke 
it. Her hand was numb after 
she broke it; an operation cured 
that, but it is still weak. 
Story of how she broke her 
wrist.

Grandmother's house. Story 
about the cow breaking into 
the house. Had a chicken 
house and a pine tree in the 
yard. Had a spring house and 
drank water with a gourd. 
Quilting. Tacked a lot of 
quilt. Nine Diamond was 
popular. They didn't have 
room to leave them up in 
the frame. 
Corn shuckings. Apple peelings. 
Apron party—the boys hemmed 
aprons and the girls drove 
a nail into the board. They 
didn't have dances in the 
neighborhood. Dances are coming 
back now. Box suppers. 
Met her husband. He talked to 
another girl the night they 
met, but he came back to see 
her. Wedding. They were 
married while they sat in a 
buggy; the witnesses stood on 
the porch. 
They went to live in a log cabin. 
Those were the happiest days 
of my life. Married in 1920. 
She spent a lot of time with 
her husband's four sisters. 
They said she seemed more like 
one of the family than an in¬ 
law. 
Lived in the log cabin for a year. 
Moved to a house in Woodlawn

that was far from the road. She r 
hated to get her white shoes 
dirty when she went to open 
the gate. They couldn't keep 
a roof on that house, so they 
moved up to Coal Creek. 
Worked in a furniture factory 
during the war. Used the money 
to dig a well. 
Depression. Helped people fill 
out ration books at the school- 
house. Her husband had a 
pension. She doesn't remember 
hearing too much complaining 
about the Depression. Many 
had a garden and raised their 
own meat. 
Worked in the factory while her ^ 
son was in the war. It helped 
to pass the time away. When 
the war was over, they laid 
the women off. She wishes she 
would have worked in a textile 
factory. She sprayed furniture 
with shellac. She was glad 
for the men to have the job 
when they got back. She just 
wishes she would have worked 
in a shirt factory; "That's 
women's work." A furniture 
factory is men's work. Some 
women who had experience at 
the textile factory went to 
furniture factory, but returned 
to their old jobs when they 
were laid off. .w 
Rug weaving. Started in 1969. 
Story about how she started 
weaving. There were three looms 
at the Coal Creek Community 
Center. They had to move their 
looms out when the building 
became a plumbing shop. Jessie 
Cooley was the instructor and 
Charlie Burcham helped to repair 
the equipment. She didn't go 
much when the community center 
started.

The Coal Creek Community Center. 
Mrs. Etoile Berry and Jessie 
Cooley ran the program. Mazie 
Beamer, Vera Robinson, 
Hazel Bartlett, and Daisy Cox 
learned through this program. 
Mrs. Berry began providing the 
weavers with the rags. They 
had to cut these rags. They 
moved the looms to a campsite 
and then had to move them from 
there. Bill Patterson had a 
solid oak loom. Mazie Beamer 
has one that was in the neighbor¬ 
hood. There are now four looms 
in this area. 
She buys her rags from WonderKnit. 
She won't take in other people’s 
rags; she has too many of her 
own. 
Wall-to-wall carpeting. She has 
never made any; "it'd be so 
heavy." 
How do you start weaving a rug. 
She just starts the rug; if it 
doesn't suit her, she stops 
and makes a short rug. 
Size of rug. Forty-eight inches 
is what she tries for. They 
are 25 to 30 inches wide. The 
wider ones were hard to wash. 
Favorite color rug is red. 
Some people order rugs from her. ^ 
People from California use the 
rugs on the car seat.

People send her orders through 
somebody. It's more of a 
hobby than anything else. 
It is good therapy for her. 
Borders in the rugs. She likes 
to do them once in a while. 
She puts in a contrasting color 
to make the rug longer or just 
because she thinks it looks 
pretty. Brown and gold. 
Dark green and light green 
looked pretty. 
She has never made a hit and 
miss rug. They sell well, but 
they take a long time to sew 
together. 
Striped rug. They are harder to 
make too, but a good way to 
use up smaller amounts of rags. 
She puts in her stripes repeating 
the order of the colors. She 
stacks up her different colors 
now so she can remember the 
order. 
Doesn't make the twisted rug. 
Solid rug is pretty if it's 
a pretty color. She can make 
them much faster. 
Not familiar with Turkey Track 
Borders. 
Unusual fabrics. Some people 
crochet bread wrapper rugs, 
but she doesn't see the 
benefit in weaving one from 
plastic. She likes a rug in 
front of her kitchen andstove. 
It will absorb water she spills. 
The linoleum wore out there 
first. 
Combining fabrics. It doesn't 
work well. She likes polyester. 
It washes well. She used more 
cotton when she started. It 
faded worse than polyester does. 
Polyester is easier to work with. 
She's never dyed her fabrics. 
Cutting the fabric. Used to use 
a cutter, but now she uses the 
scissors. Cut it 2 inches wide. 
Cut heavier fabrics narrower. 
She only uses new fabrics. Rugs 
from older fabrics are beautiful, 
but why should she use the old 
when she has all these new scraps 
that are already cut. 
Stitching the pieces together. 
She has done this, but now she 
just tapers the ends and the 
26 - 28 
26 - 28

warp will hold it together. 
If you sew them, the string will 
show through the warp. 
When she sewed them, she tapered 
the ends and sewed them hy hand. 
She winds them into a hall and 
then onto a shuttle as she 
weaves. 
Rug House. Keeps her loom, 
strings, radio, and coffeepot. 
She can hear the telephone from 
the Rug House. Earnest Walker 
built it for her in the 
simmer of 1977. She needed 
a place to put the loom; she 
bought the materials and he 
built it for her. She used 
to go up to the campsite and 
make a rug in a day. The Rug 
House is very comfortable.

0-5 The Loom. Mrs. Berry gave her 
the loom in 1969- It suits 
her because it's not as large 
as some. The pedals are the 
the only new part of it. 
Learned to weave on Patterson's 
loom. They wove rugs of 
different widths: she's narrowed 
this one down. She likes the 
rocker-type beater. The crank 
is on the inside on her loom. 
5 _ 7 Warp. Comes from a cotton 
factory in Jamestown, N.C. 
Colored warp costs more, so 
she used the white warp. Now 
they seem to cost the same. 
They had different colors on the 
different looms.

"I'd rather make this bread than 
eat." Eleven or twelve cups 
of flour, but she doesn't 
measure it. Have to stir it in 
until it gets kind of elastic¬ 
like . 
Ingredients. Yeast in warm 
water, scalded milk, salt, 
shortening; "the yeast is 
fussy stuff." Has to knead 
it awhile. This kind of batter 
bread rises twice. This recipe 
she found in a newspaper twenty 
years ago. She did bake one 
"real pretty loaf." Even if 
she gave her Aunts the recipe, 
they wouldn't bake it. Cooking 
is her favorite pastime. Her 
mother made her dress 15 or 16 
years ago. 
The dough is now "bouncy;" that's 
good because now it will rise 
up. If its real cold or damp, 
the dough won't rise. She 
folds it, mashes it, and beats 
it. "Hit it in the mouth with 
your fist." "You may have to 
go to the dentist after you 
try this." 
Turns the burner on warm under¬ 
neath the bowls (one is plastic). 
She just loves to play with 
the electric stove. Likes 
to play with the running water

too. She covers the dough 
with a plate and a towel. 
She turned off the turners 
and let the dough sit. 
She lines the oven with foil to 
keep it from getting too hot 
on the bottom. 
Galax leaves. Articles in the 
newspaper. Her notebooks. 
Setting the oven. Determines 
how hot the oven is by the 
amount of wood she's put in. 
Cracklings. Ethel Brewer likes 
to render out her own lard and 
make her own cracklings. She 
put together her own recipe 
for crackling bread. Ethel 
never measures the ingredients 
for crackling bread. She can 
make a whole meal out of it. 
Tells about rendering out her 
own lard again. Her own 
cracklings are better than 
those she buys in the store. 
Uses Martha White self-rising ylff 
corn meal. She puts vinegar 
into evaporated milk to make 
sour milk. "I wish I could 
cook all day long." She 
adds two eggs to the batter. 
She rinses out the eggshell 
with her thumb. She beats 
the egg with a fork. She 
puts in a half pound of the 
cracklings. "That is a real 
old country dish." Crackling 
bread has to bake at 500 for 
about a half hour. 
Testing the light bread dough. 
The dough isn't bouncing 
back fast enough. The first 
time I made light bread that 
yeast smell made me sick. I 
started cooking when I was six 
or seven. 
Leather Britches and shuck beans. 
Fried biscuits.

0-4 Recipes from her mother. Fish 
Scramble. Pan-fried trout. 
Mrs. Dotson likes to fish. 
Fish Scramble has okra in it. 
Ruth loves okra with tomatoes 
and onions. 
4-8 Light bread is ready to shape. 
Crackling bread is just like 
cornbread, except for the 
the cracklings. She likes 
to cook beef. Beef stew. 
Sweet potato pie. Parsnip 
pie. Her father wouldn't eat 
it because he thought it was 
coconut. She likes coconut 
pie. She likes any kind of 
recipe. She gets them from 
magazines and newspapers. She 
copies them on file cards and 
in notebooks. "It gives me 
something to do." 
8 - Crackling bread is almost done. 
Light bread is bubbly on the 
top; it is almost ready too. 
She spreads the flour out on 
the table. She pats out the 
dough. "That makes a pretty 
loaf." She makes the loaves 
and uses the rest for biscuits. 
"That's the way people used to 
make biscuits around here." 
Color of the crust makes it 
pretty.

Southern bread. It's stubborn 
to cut it with the lumpy 
cracklings. 
Light bread. Aunt Ethel doesn't 
make it because she hates to 
wait for it. Her oven holds 
even heat; on the wood stove 
she has to watch real close 
to see that the heat is even. 
Her cousin could eat a half 
dozen biscuits. "I wish this 
is all I had to do." Now it 
will take them another half 
an hour to rise. Now she's 
making the Ethel biscuit. "It's 
a tradition, I reckon." Now 
she makes three long rolls. 
"Beat you into submission." 
That's rising about the best 
I've ever had it. "I love to 
cook, make bread. It's so 
easy." 
Chicken and dumplings. Now she 
makes one square loaf. "That'll 
be a pretty one." "That is so 
stretchy." She has six pans 
full of bread. Sometimes she 
puts the biscuits in a muffin 
pan; it makes them a bit 
fancier. Ends up with seven 
pans of bread. She covers the 
pans with a newspaper. She 
puts the flour back in the bag 
to take home with her. 
Rinses out the pan. "Done with 
the messy part." 
Coffee and crackling bread. 
"I cook by nose." I never 
taste anything when I cook. 
Use your fingers; it's easier. 
Southern fried chicken. Grits 
and ground beef. Learned from 
her mother or made up herself. 
Don't put butter on the crackling 
bread; it's already so greasy. 
The bread is delicious. 
Virginia method of cooking greens 
is different from the Georgia 
method. Bibb lettuce.

Ethel's biscuit. Recipes 
from the notebook; fruit 
and dumplings. 
She started school in the sixth 
grade. "How Galax got its 
name." Galax leaves. 
Bread is rising. Ruth likes to 
play with her sink and stove. 
The water from the spring 
house is good. This water 
had more chlorine in it 
than water. 
Making hominy. Uses hominy in 
place of bread. They just 
made hominy as they needed it. 
When they lived at Woodlawn, 
was a long walk to the spring. 
They don't sell the Galax leaves. 
Oswego leaves for Oswego tea. 
She dries it and stores it in 
a brown paper bag. It makes 
you generally feel better. 
She turns the bread around so 
it will bake better. The s^ound 
of the cars bothers her. 
Canned 28 quarts of beans although 
they didn't have a garden. 
Gathers wild greens from the 
front yard. Puts butter on 
the crust of the bread. She 
thumps it on the top to see 
if it sounds hollow. If its 
doughy, it will just make a 
dull thud. Looks floury on 
top.

Her favorite loaf is in the 
French bread pan. Ethel is 
getting ready to eat her 
biscuit. She puts a lot of 
butter on it. She buys a 
special margerine that tastes 
a lot like butter. Gives her 
cats a little milk. "If you 
don't want it, you can throw 
it out." 
This has been a fun day so far. 
Ruth's wood stove doesn't hold 
even heat. She cooks two or 
three dishes for every meal. 
Making a pie crust. Breakfast 
consists of eggs and biscuits. 
Ethel fixes biscuits and gravy 
for breakfast. Her husband 
has tomatoes with his biscuits 
and gravy. The meat—fatback 
or sausage--is used to make 
the gravy. 
Chicken and dumplings. For 
supper they just have left¬ 
overs or a sandwich. "See if 
you like this." The bread is 
good when it's hot. She read 
the dictionary like some people 
a novel. She is weak in 
mathematics; she missed all 
the basic rules. 
When she started school, she 
read at the college level, 
but her math held her back.

0-5 Biscuits are made out of light 
bread dough. I cook by ear 
and nose in place of taste. 
Ruth usually eats one biscuit, 
but she won't today. She 
used to be shy, but a teacher 
made her speak extemporaneously. 
One loaf didn't brown quite 
like the others. "Those look 
good too, don't they." Now 
she has six loaves, 12 biscuits, 
and one large biscuit. She 
has finished for the day. 
5-10 Baking cakes. She uses mixes 
and makes some from scratch. 
Sometimes she uses the frosting 
as a kind of confection. She 
likes frosting "kke-deep" on 
her cakes. She likes anything 
rich and fattening. Fried 
potatoes. When she's not 
cooking, she's looking through 
her recipes or copying them. 
10 - 18 Mother's recipes. Salasify. 
She wilts it and cans it. 
She uses a pressure canner. 
Hex mother sewed her dress. 
Canning cabbage. Sauerkraut. 
Let iit sit until it gets through 
"stinking." Pickle beans. 
They would pickle the beans 
that had not canned well. 
Curing meat. They have only 
a pet chicken. Old Donnie, 
a twenty-six year old duck.

They raised the corn to feed the 
chicken and ducks. 
She was horn in Hehron, Virginia 
in 1929. She brought in the 
first depression. She remembers 
a wagon her father bought her 
the day Roosevelt was elected. 
People were out of work, but 
most people had a garden. She 
has never lived in a town or 
a city. 
Her father worked in a sawmill. 
They lived near Bland, Virginia 
for awhile. They came back 
to Woodlawn to stay until the 
highway came through. They 
bought twelve acres near 
Galax. Garland Allen built 
their three room house. Her 
father worked at a furniture 
factory. She didn't like it 
at first because she had 
lived at Woodlawn for thirteen 
years. 
Her mother whittled, sewed, 
painted. She made the covered 
wagoiS, but always sold them. 
The family never did get one 
to keep. The oxen were carved 
too, and the wagon was a foot 
and a half long. She had 
always painted. She painted ov\ 
any scrap of materials she 
could find. She used water 
colors mostly, but couldn't 
stand the stink of oils. 
Sometimes she used poster 
paint. She started when she 
was in school at the Blue 
Ridge School. Her mother 
was born in 1908. She sold 
some of her paintings. Story 
of Fannie Dotson's request 
for a painting. 
Schooldays. First word she said 
was model. She could always 
put words together and she 
could spell.

She couldn't finish 3rd grade 
because she was sick. She 
then finished 11 years of 
school. She learned to read 
from magazines and newspapers. 
She didn't attend grades 1 - 
5 because she lived so far 
from school. She was valedictorian 
of her class and received a 
subscription to Reader's Digest. 
College. She couldn't go because^ 
her parents were sick. Story ^ 
about how she had to take care 
of the housework while her 
mother was sick. Some teachers 
encouraged her to continue her 
education. 
Job. They didn't encourage her 
to get a job because they knew 
she was needed at home. She ^ 
wanted to be a doctor, but 
they wouldn't let her because 
she was a girl. "Seems like 
they thought a girl; shouldn't 
be anything." They said she 
couldn't stand the eight hour 
day. 
Cures. What to do for a sprained 
ankle; wrap it with a mullen

don't bother her. She found 
the brown spider in bed with 
her.

The children in school didn't 
take to her too much because 
she studied so much. She 
graduated in 1950. She missed 
out on knowing how to join in 
and get along. They seemed 
like babies to her. Dolls 
didn't interest her too much; 
they didn't do anything. She 
liked school. She liked to 
learn about different types of 
people. She found a basis to 
build a life on. She took 
chemistry instead of home ec. 
Story about the chemistry 
teacher who made a poisonous 
gas and put two or three boys 
in the hospital. "If she would 
have had one more ingredient 
it would have been fatal." 
She liked science and biology. 
She taught herself how to type. 
She didn't like physical ed. 
Scholarship. They never tried 
to find out about one. "Maybe ^ 
if I wouldn't have been the 
only one, I would have had a 
chance. Women's liberation 
maybe came to late for me." 
Poetry club. She let the poetry 
drop when she started doing 
the craft work for Mrs. Berry. 
Recipe collection. It's a 
pastime. She used to get tense 
about not being able to do what 
she wanted, so she later decided^ 
not to worry about it. They 
encouraged her recipe collection; 
"anything but getting out of 
the house and doing anything." 
Read The Gift of Inner Peace. 
Getting angry doesn't do you 
a bit of good. 
Cooking. She started cooking 
when she was 7 years old. 
How she cooked with her mother. 
Cornbread was one of the first 
things she learned how to cook. \L 
Story of the first time she ^ 
cooked; she made pears and 
apples. She made plain cakes 
when she was young. 75% of 
what she cooks she learned from 
her mother. The rest are from 
her recipes. Fried chicken. 
Wild greens. Plantain. Dandelion.

She made quilts because she needed 
them. She "kinda matched up her 
colors to make them look pretty." 
Patterns. She didn't have any patterns. 
She tacked some and quilted some. 
She likes them quilted best because 
they last. "These is sewed close 
together." They last longer. 
Washes quilts. She washes them in 
two big tubs. She throws the water 
over them on the lines. "That's 
old timey washing." Let the water 
drain out. She had to go to the 
branch to get the water. She liked 
to wash, but she didn't like to 
iron. 
She never thought the quilts were 
special. She has given the children 
quilts. They don't use quilts; they 
use blankets. The old-timey way is 
is to use quilts. 
Fabrics. Pieces from sewing. She 
bought silk pieces for the counterpane. 
"I'm awful to make quilts." 
"Every quilt in my house has been pieced 
by my fingers." She'd hang her quilting 
frames anywhere. "It's nice" to have 
a quilt in the frames. She would 
quilt one out in three days. "I just 
love to quilt." 
She'd take small pieces and piece them 
together. Only her children helped 
her quilt.

Lining was hard to get. She'd put 
two or three sheets together for 
the lining. The sheets were the 
filler and the lining. You couldn't 
get everything. You'd use the good 
pieces of clothing for the lining of 
the quilt. 
Old times like that is done passed. 
He was a fox hunter, and she'd sit 
up and quilt while waiting for him. 
Andrew. 
Strip quilt—no patterns. These quilts 
are made out of their old clothing. 
She tacked it with red thread. The 
lining was window curtains. There 
is cotton in this one; "it's kind 
of a new quilt." 
Match colors. Tacked with gray 
thread. 
Block quilt. Another new one. It is 
put together in blocks. This is a 
tacked one. She uses tack thread. 
That is regular thread; no, it is 
done with yarn. 
String quilt. Dutch Girl counterpane. 
A fancy Dutch woman. Leonard Bryan's 
mother made it; tufted on the top. 
She whipped the thread over a pencil, 
and cut it. She didn't want it as 
a counterpane, but rather as a quilt. 
She paid $1.00 for those pieces. 
She pieced them in strips and then 
sewed the strips together. You have 
to do any of them that way. She 
has never worked around in a circle. 
Counterpane was made between 1858 to 
1958. She made it when she was 
older. She pieced quilts too. Story 
of her death. 
"They ain't a thing but straight quilts." 
These are blues and browns and yellow 
in the middle. She didn't buy the 
pieces. Quilting pattern. Laid off 
the pattern with a piece of chalk. 
They are pieced in a fan. It ends 
in a square. Leonard's mother 
showed her how to quilt. She didn't 
know too much about it.

Block Quilt - It takes a long time to 
piece a quilt like this. Sewed them 
together in blocks and then in a 
strip. Sixteen blocks in a square. 
She dyed the backing. The quilt 
would keep you warm. Quilted in 
the fan. They will last. 
Counterpanes - both the top and the 
bottom are counterpanes she bought 
from a peddler. Some have sheets in 
them and some have cotton. The 
government wants to know about our 
heritage. Everything she has is old. 
Log Cabin Quilt. She started one, but 
then it went to slow, so she just 
put it together in blocks. They are 
all in blocks and strips. "It was 
too slow." She colored all her 
linings. 
Old Quilt. She pieced the blocks 
together and sewed them in strips. 
Another one made out of old clothes. 
The lining is made out of her old 
dresses. They wore "big, old wide 
dresses." This is tacked with a 
single piece of yarn. Tacking is 
easy to do; they are close together. 
She just guesses at it when she 
tacks them. 
Turns the linings up on top of the 
quilt. Church quiltings. She never 
participated in group quiltings. She 
just quilted with the family. She 
raised the family while he worked in

in the mines in WestVirginia. Those 
days were difficult. 
She liked to stay busy. Now she 
works with flowers. She can't 
quilt "because her eyesight is 
bad. It's been three years since 
she pieced a quilt. She has 
quilted ever since she's been 
married. 
She takes special care of the new 
ones . The silk quilt was the 
hardest to quilt. 
Knotted quilt. It is a counterpane. 
She would like to make a quilt out 
of it. She simply knots baling 
thread. She learned how to make it 
from Leonard's mother. It looks 
like white string done in a French 
knot. No one will use it as a 
counterpane. "Well, now you've 
seen my sorry stuff." It's 
raining outside. 
Choosing the quilts to photograph. 
One quilt on a bed is about all you 
need. Dogs and puppies. Andrew. 
Do you reckon people will enjoy 
seeing quilts like this? I didn't 
think I'd ever have them out of the 
trunk. They haven't been out for 
two years.

Children and grandchildren have her quilts; 
they use them as spreads. Appliques 
are made from kits. Her sister-in-law 
has two; her doctor has one. Children 
have Drunkard's Trail and Log Cabin. 
"They value them." 
She remembers a Log Cabin her husband's 
mother had in red and black. Those 
colors are too dark for today. She 
wants to do a Crook Rail fence next. 
She got the idea from a book. She 
bought a blue and three types of 
print that will blend with blue. 
Patterns. Wedding Band is different 
from Double Wedding Ring. 
She always enjoyed sewing and hand work. 
The .first quilt she made was the 
Drunkard's Path when her daughter 
was born. She has been quilting for 
45 years. 
Background. Born in Patrick County in 
a family of 11. Parents tried to 
educate the children. She taught 
school for 12 years. She was asked 
to work with the mentally retarded, 
but she was sick and couldn't do it. 
She does volunteer work at the local 
hospital. 
Household tasks. Her sisters wouldn't 
let her do their crochet work; she'd 
do it when they were gone. Her 
mother would let her sew. "Most 
likely I ripped it out before they 
caught me."

Her mother didn't quilt well. Her 
stitches and her patterns were not 
what I would call "nice" quilts. 
She made them for warmth. She 
made crazy quilts; she sewed them 
on paper and then rip the paper off. 
She made squares or oblong squares. 
"That was quite an art." Some crazy 
quilts are embroidered on every 
seam. Crystal just relined a crazy 
quilt. Her mother stitched the 
pieces on the machine. "They didn't 
know as much about the patterns as 
we know today," and it took so many 
quilts. "I never saw anythin^ like 
the flower garden or the drunkard's 
path. 
Filler. Old blankets. The batting 
was heavier cotton. The one she 
did from 1885 was filled with an 
old blanket. 
Household tasks. Cooking and canning. 
Her mother was an outdoor person; her 
mother had to supervise the outside 
chores and Crystal did most of the 
cooking and canning. They dried a 
lot of food; they dried almost as 
much as they canned. Evaporator. 
They still dry the apples for fried 
apple pies. Her mother's recipe. 
She made them the size of a plate; 
Crystal makes her's smaller. "They 
look nicer." The first thing her 
sister asked for when she moved down 
from New York was fried apple pies. 
Evaporator was open all the way around. 
The built a furnace under the slatted 
floor. It was six or eight feet high. 
It was similar to the tobacco curing 
shed. The roof kept the rain from 
getting into them. They were stirred 
every so often with a paddle. They 
were sold for 4 to 10 cents a pound. 
One of Crystal's jobs was to slice 
them. They put the apples in a sulfur 
solution to keep them from turning 
brown. The insects weren't a problem. 
They dried sweet potatoes, corn. Some 
familes here still dry corn. Canned 
corn isn't very good. They put the 
corn in screen wire in the sun to dry. 
This family dries a small amount of 
corn because they like the taste ofit.

salt in kraut; it will ruin it. The 
scum must be removed from the beans 
and kraut as it works. They let the 
kraut sit about 3 weeks before they 
disturbShe cooks the kraut with 
spare ribs. 
Hominy. Her mother made it with a 
lye solution. She never makes hominy 
or molasses. She makes apple butter, 
and she used to make her own butter. 
They had a grade A Dairy. She has 
had as high as 25 pounds of butter 
in her freezer at one time. She 
still' has her butter mold. She made 
cheese and cottage cheese. They 
went out of the dairy business when 
her husband's health got bad. The 
man who has the farm now does Grade 
B milk which they are not so particular 
about.

Early life. Born in 1910 in Stuart. 
Family background. Father's family 
was Dutch from Hollands Preacher 
Williams came over on the Mayflower. 
Her mother had an excellent memory, and 
so does her brother. Crystal has 
lived in the County for most of her 
life, except during the Depression 
they lived in Tazwell for 10 years. 
Mr. Cruise worked for the Buick Co. 
and made $25 a week. They set up 
housekeeping for less than $15, and 
rented a nice house for $15 a month. 
Depression. Things were rough in 1929 
and 1930* Mr. Cruise has worked in 
Chicago and Pennsylvania. He got 
this job in Tazwell through an uncle. 
Both her daughters worlaAfor the FBI. 
Depression. There were no factories 
to work in like there are now. Many 
families left the areas some went 
into the coal fields. As a teacher, 
she made less than $100 a month. 
They only had from 3 to 5 months of 
school. 
Her school was a one room school with 
grades one through seven. They 
taught reading, writing, and arithmeti 
Square dances. They did the Virginia 
Reel, but she doesn't recognize it 
now the way they do it. They had the 
dances in the homes. At Christmastime 
they would have a dance every night. 
That was the only form of entertain¬ 
ment they had.

266 - 330 
The dancing has changed so much. Story 
about her daughter flat-foot dancing 
in Minnesota. 
Crystal met her husband at church through 
a cousin. She told her mother she saw 
the man she was going to marry. Three 
years later she met him again. She 
met him in November, and they married 
in April. They are planning their 
50th wedding anniversary party. 
Her wedding. They had no church wedding. 
It rained on Sunday so they married 
on Tuesday instead at a minister’s 
house. Her parents didn't know she 
was getting married, but a friend 
told her family. They were going 
to run away. She was staying with 
an Aunt who knew about the wedding, 
but she was going to keep it a 
secret from her mother. When her 
mother found out, she accepted it. 
She began quilting after she was married. 
When you have three children, there 
isn't much you can do except take 
care of them. If you have to be 
housed up with them, why not do some¬ 
thing. She sewed and did her first 
crib quilt. She needed the blanket 
and she had the time. When they 
took a nap, she would take one too. 
She quilted in the evening after her 
husband came home, and at night after 
the children were in bed. She still 
quilts at night with the TV on. 
She learned how to quilt better through 
practice. She saw an early applique 
quilt she made, and her work now is 
much better. She has seen quilts 
that aren't very nice; generally her's 
are pretty good. The pink rosebud 
quilt has 19 different colors, and 
she keeps that many needles threaded 
up to sew them. She buys her thread 
to match the fabrics. Sometimes 
she'll have six needles threaded up. 
She uses a regular quilting needle 
for the quilting. She matches the 
thread to the backing. She'll use 
an off-white quilting thread on 
Thursday. She would like to use a 
60 because it is finer; regular 
quilting thread is sometimes heavier. 
The thread should match the lining, 
but it shouldn't show on the top. 
It is better to match the lining; 
the top stitching doesn't show that 
much. 
page 3 
GT- 
330 - 363 She never pulls the lining up over the 
quiltj the older people did. She 
uses a border and puts it on the 
top and sews it to the bottom. If 
the thread and lining didn't match, 
she wouldn't buy the quilt. She 
uses the binding on the quilt. She'll 
make an off-white binding to match 
the lining, but if she can't do that, 
she'll buy some yellow bias tape to 
match the flowers in the quilt. The 
quilting books tell you to match the 
backing or the dominant color in the 
quilt. 
363 - 400 Other types of needle work. Swedish 
embroidery, crocheting, needlepoint, 
crewel work. She prefers quilting. 
Her husband likes to help her; it's 
good therapy for him. He does a 
nice job; better than many women. 
The stitch must be uniform, not a 
short one and a long one or one turned 
this way and one that way. 
400 - 433 We do a whole lot in fans. But as a 
rule we follow the pattern on the 
quilt; we do more of them these days. 
Flower Garden; Drunkard’s Trail, 
Crooked Fence all follow the pattern. 
Following the pattern is easier, 
and you want it to look the same on 
the bottom as it does on the top. 
She has a lot of quilting patterns 
she can use, but she doesn't think 
they're appropriate to thejpieced 
pattern. A log cabin pattern for 
a log cabin quilt is important. 
On an applique, real pretty quilting 
is important.

Story about her children's friends 
who ate all of the cake. They all y. 
tipped her. Story about a loud ffr 
party; the boys ran and climbed a 
tree; she got a broom and stood on 
the porch and wouldn't let them 
down. Her younger son was visiting 
her sister; he didn't like margarine; 
"I don't want that old lard on my 
tater." They wanted his picture to 
advertise Karo syrup; they offered 
the family $25 for the photo. She 
said no. It was hard to re-adjust 
to having all the children gone. 
She has stayed busy; even when her 
children visit now, she tries to keep 
busy after they leave. "It helps." 
You need to have something to do during 
the wintertime—"especially older 
people." Otherwise you sit around 
waiting for your turn. 
When she and her husband quilt, no one 
helps them. They know the type of 
work they do, and you don't know the 
type of work other people do. She 
quilts with groups some; she doesn’t 
have her quilts quilted in a group. 
She quilts in the wintertime, beginning 
in October even. They go to Florida 
in the winter, so she tries to get 
her quilts done before she leaves. 
She does most of her work before 
Christmas or perhaps into January. 
It gives them something to do when 
the weather is bad. 
page 2 
110 - 118 They quilt all day. They'll quilt 
until they get tired, rest some, 
and then quilt again. It is 
tiresome, but fascinating. 
118 - 177 Family thinks her quilting is marvelous. 
Her son took one to Marty Robbins. 
It was a red, white and blue star 
quilt. "It was so pretty." She 
often makes them for herself, but 
her family claims them for them¬ 
selves. They use blankets on their 
beds although she does have a flower 
garden on the bed now. She prefers 
blankets because they can be laundered 
easier. She dry cleans quilts. "They're 
easier laundered." The children have 
her quilts, but they don't use them 
either; they keep them in plastic 
and store them. One girl has five 
quilts, but she laundered one of them. 
Another daughter is keeping them for 
her children. She mailed each of 
her grandchildren one. They were 
"freezing to death." Her granddaughter 
has her's in her hope chest. She 
has made 30 appliques alone. 
177 - 214 She started the applique work eight 
years ago. She first saw the patterns 
that many years ago. All the applique 
shows, and if you don't do a nice 
job it ruins the value of your quilt. 
You have to blind stitch the applique 
on; the hand-pieced doesn't show as 
much. The quilting pattern is much 
fancier and much more work. "That's 
part of your quilt, making it pretty." 
It is so much more noticeable. The 
quilting is the making of your applique 
quilt. The patterns are stamped on. 
She could make up her own patterns, 
but she doesn't. She could put them 
on her other quilts, but it wouldn't 
show up as well. They quilt by the 
fan and by the pattern. 
214 - One doctor friend of theirs preferred 
the quilt top to be quilted in the fans. 
They did the lines very close together, 
and it was very pretty. She uses 
quilting chalk tied to a cord to mark 
off the pattern on one side of the 
quilt. If she makes 12 lines in the 
first fan, she'll make 12 in the 
second. She enjoys quilting in the 
fan. In the center, you ^o diagonal 
between the fans. Her husband 
usually lays off the fans on the 
quilt because he is more accurate. 
6X-^ 
You can start with your inside lines, 
but then.you can roll it and finish 
the outside lines. It is very pretty 
quilting if you do nice circle lines 
and have them close together. 
Choosing between fans and the pattern 
in quilting. If the pattern is simple, 
she would do a fan. If it’s a busy 
pattern, she would do it by the pattern. 
The first quilt she saw was in the 
fans. A third of her quilts are done 
in the fans. She would not want a 
log cabin or flower garden in fans. 
The bottom would be much prettier 
done in the pattern. You always have 
a sore finger when you quilt. She 
uses a thimble? her husband has cut 
the ends of two fingers off a leather 
glove and that is his thimble. Most 
thimbles are too small for him. No 
one can quilt without a thimble and 
do a nice job. 
289 - 297 She puts.three stitches on the needle 
at a time because she uses the short, 
sharp, strong quilting needle. 
297 - 353 Quilting by the fan is the old handed 
down method of quilting. Her mother 
and grandmother did it. She learned 
to lay off a fan by watching her 
mother. "I never saw her quilt a 
quilt other than by fans.” She did 
a lot of quilts. Most often it was 
done by the fan, not by the pattern. 
The early log cabin she saw was done 
in the fans, but to her it would have 
been much prettier done by the pattern. 
She saw a log cabin with a window and 
chimney which she did not like. It 
wasn't like the log cabin she knew. 
Her log cabin will be done in squares. 
The older one was done as a piece. 
She plans to use only two colors— 
a solid and a print. She will do a 
brown solid and a brown figure. It 
resembles the log cabins she knew 
with the brown in it. The one at 
Lover's Leap Craft Shop is not the 
old log cabin that has been handed 
down. 
353 - 421 Giving away quilts. Her family claims 
most of her quilts; she has friends 
she would like to give them to. She 
gave one to her Doctor. She has 
given them mainly to the family. 
She doesn't sell quilts; she could, 
but she won't. They pay less. If 
she would sell them, she could sell 
page 3 
253 - 289 
page 4 
353 - 421 them herself. She did sell some to 
a craft shop in Richmond, hut he 
didn’t return when she raised her 
price. Single bed size lone star 
was $50. "That's ridiculous." They 
went up $25, and he thought that was 
too high. If I wanted to go into 
the business, I could get that and 
more for just quilting. A lady from 
a Ferrum Craft Shop visited her too, 
but thought her price was too high. 
She quilts for friends. She charged 
$40 for quilting a quilt for a 
neighbor recently.

0 - ^7 Difficult quilting material. Cotton 
material is easy to quilt through. 
Stripped means the blocks have 
material stripped inbetween them. 
Every seam has to match when putting 
the strips together. Basket pattern. 
The group quilted this quilt for 
Dr. Flint. Crystal put it together, 
but not all the blocks were the same 
size. Anyone who doesn't quilt 
doesn't know what is involved. Cne 
strip goes all the way through, and 
the other goes from block to block. 
^7 - 83 In the quilt for the Flints, she put 
all the blocks of similar colors 
together. She mixed up the blocks 
for the flower because she thinks 
that's prettier, but the Flints 
she thought looked better with the 
blocks mixed. She laid out the blocks 
on the floor and arranged them in 
a way she thought was pretty. Story 
about how they surprised the Flints 
with the quilt. Dr. Flint wanted 
to buy the quilt. They planned a 
reception for them and gave them the 
quilt. He was really surprised. 
83 -104 People from craft shops trying to get 
her to sell quilts or quilt for them. 
Woman from Ferrum. She determines 
the price by the amount of work in 
the quilt. The fan is easy. She 
charges by the quilt itself.

The knots. She pulls her knots through 
from the top. Some people pull them 
from the bottom. If her thread runs 
out before she's finished a line, 
she backstitches, and clips the end. 
In group quilting, too many knots are 
showing and you have to cut them off. 
Group quilting. Only about half the 
ladies will do a nice job on the quilt. 
She would not have a group do a quilt 
for her. Some women will not have 
straight stitches; they will sort of 
zig-zag down the line. Crystal has 
brought a number of quilts home from 
group quilting and taken the stitches 
out and redone the quilting. They 
were doing them for other people, but 
she couldn't put up with that kind of 
quilting. This quilt is different. 
The woman knows all the ladies who 
are quilting, and Crystal will leave 
all their stitches in. The woman 
who owns the quilt is from Takoma, 
Washington. The bad thing is for 
someone to come in a learn to quilt 
on your quilt. 
Special terms. She doesn't use the 
term "good hand.” Someone does 
especially nice quilting or 
especially poor quilting. One lady 
in their group does very fine quilting, 
but she can’t quilt anymore. She has 
to have her quilts done which must 
bother her. 
Fabrics for the quilt tops. She uses 
a muslin sheet for the backing; percale 
is hard to quilt through. For the 
top, she would never put an applique 
on anything but unbleached muslin. 
It doesn't look right otherwise. She 
would only put some of her quilts on 
white; the rest look better on off- 
white. Then she uses the same fabric 
for the backing. She saw a quilt at 
the craft shop with a pretty top, but 
the white backing was brought over 
the top, and it looked terrible. 
The lady at the craft shop agreed. 
Crystal would have use bias tape to 
match the top on the edges. Anyone 
who didn't know quilting could have 
seen that. Finishing the quilt is 
very important. 
She is planning to make a quilt out of 
pretty autumn colors. She has a beige 
print with three colors as a border 
around the quilt. It's a gorgeous 
GT- R ‘/O 
224 - 321 
321 - 334 
334 - 377 
thing. She'll probably use a beige 
lining for that to blend in with 
those colors. Your colors and your 
finishing is very important. 
She prefers cotton for piecing a quilt. 
She has done a couple with double-knit; 
it was a particular pattern that needed 
to puff. She would not use double-knit, 
She doesn't think it goes with quilts. 
She thinks the drip-dry cotton is all 
right, but she has a Dresden Plate 
that she didn’t like because it 
wasn't smooth. The Cathedral Window 
was not smooth, but some people have 
said they liked it wrinkled. She 
has always used cotton for her tops. 
She quilted one Bow Tie out of double 
knit, but the colors were pretty. 
Both of her double knits were pretty. 
You cannot sell a double knit at a 
craft shop. They'd be easy laundering. 
Crystal has a lot of scraps of double 
knit that she can't use. She gets 
her fabrics from Walkertown, N.C. 
about 45 minutes away. They have 
a lot of cotton materials; Sears has 
a good selection of cotton; Leggett's 
sells good cottons. Many shops 
won't cut less than a yard of material 
for quilters. She buys all new fabrics 
for her quilts. In a wedding ring you 
can' use all sorts of small fabrics. 
It takes 18 pieces for a ring; she 
uses anything she has for that pattern. 
Most of the time she has to buy fabrics 
for her quilts. For her rail fence 
pattern, it took 2-| yards of each 
color. She has $20 in that quilt. 
A spool of quilting thread is 800. 
You don't get 20 an hour for your 
quilting. 
The tree of Life takes them four days 
to quilt. They put in 100 hours a 
piece on the quilts. The binding has 
to be done by hand. 
Filler. She uses polyester; it launders 
or dry cleans well. Mountain Mist 
make a good batting of polyester. It 
puffs out nicely to bring out your 
design. She does not use a heavy 
batting because it makes the quilt too 
heavy. Sears makes a good batting; 
it's easier to buy from a catalog. 
There aren't any hard places in the 
Mountain Mist batting; it also stays 
together well. Either their cotton 
or polyester is good. 
It has been only a few years that 
you could get polyester. She always 
used cotton batting. She never used 
blankets. 
The backing. Muslin is easier to quilt 
through. She doesn't shrink it before 
using it. The top hasn't been shrunk.. 
If she is using a kit and the top is 
bleached muslin, then she would use 
a white sheet for the backing, 81 X 
108. She always buys the sheet or 
uses unbleached muslin. That is 
what she has always used. The 
flower garden has been set up on 
unbleached muslin so naturally she 
would use it for the lining. She 
used 1500 octagons in the flower 
garden setting it up.

Index # Outline 
4-81 Pieced Quilts. Favorite patterns. 
Turkey Track. Flower Garden. 
Log Cabin. Drunkard's Path. This 
was one of the first quilts she 
made in the crib size. She consults 
a book to show me the pattern, 
Heirloom Quilts to Treasure. It 
is from the Progressive Farmer. 
She gets her patterns from friends. 
The books give you the ideas if not 
the pattern. She makes her own 
patterns out of sandpaper after looking 
at the picture and studying the 
dimensions. The material doesn't 
stick to sandpaper. This book is 
too simple for her; she is too 
advanced for the ideas. Only the 
one pattern interested her. There 
are some patterns she hasn’t seen 
before, but many are old patterns 
she was familiar with—Flower Garden, 
for example. She was looking for a 
Tulip pillow top, but she wanted the 
whole pattern. She has more quilting 
patterns than quilting books. Most 
of her friends and neighbors have the 
patterns. She gave her Drunkard's 
Path to a neighbor. The woman had 
to bring the quilt back to have it 
set up and to finish the edge. "I 
think I got her pretty well trained 
now." 
Applique patterns. Favorites. The 
Tree of Life is the prettiest she 
has seen. She has made every pattern 
81 -

she has seen in a book. She has 
made 5 Tree of Life quilts. She 
is going to do one of those for 
herself. It is in Hershner’s 
Catalog. Lee Ward's and Good 
Housekeeping also have applique 
patterns. Mary Maxim has some. 
The work in the corners of the quilt 
is enough for the whole quilt. She 
does a corner first as a model for 
the colors in the rest of the quilt. 
She gets her applique patterns from 
various places. McCall's sends out 
a catalog too. 
Setting up the quilt. She puts her 
frames on the floor, tacks the lining 
to the frame, and clamps the end 
pieces to the top of the side pieces. 
Then she has room to roll the quilt. 
She puts the frame on chairs. Then 
she pins the batting to the lining. 
She puts the top on starting in the 
middle to be sure you get it straight. 
It must be real tight. After you 
have quilted one round around, you 
can take your pins out. They roll 
only from one side so they can work 
out the wrinkles. It takes time 
to put them in. Older people used 
nails to hold the frames together; 
she uses clamps. She repeats the 
process of putting in the quilt. 
They'11 probably take 10 days to 
finish the quilt. Some days you'll 
be quilting by yourself. They all 
meet together on the first day; 
then they get together and quilt as 
they can. They should get it out 
in a week. Somebody will be there 
most every day quilting. 
Crystal quilts in the living room. It 
is a little crowded when she starts 
out. It’s warm in here and you can 
watch television. Usually the first 
day of quilting they don't watch 
much television. They get the quilt 
out of their way. They get tired, 
and before they know it, they're back 
quilting again. They can complete a 
quilt in 4 days. 
Frames. Her husband made them. He had 
to put an extension of them. A 
neighbor never could figure out how 
to do it. He cut out the top of one 
and the bottom of the extension and 
screwed them together. He made them 
5 years ago. She wore one pair out.

tfhey cost him $4. Store bought 
frames, especially those that tilt, 
would be expensive. 
Tools for quilting. Scissors. Needles. 
Thimbles. Two spools of thread. 
Hammer for tacks. Clamps. Extra 
needles because quite often you'll 
break a needle. Quilting needles 
were hard to get, but now that 
quilting is more popular they are 
easier to come by. 
New popularity of quilting. Three to 
four years ago there was quite a 
change in quilting. The Bicentennial 
year was quite a year for quilting. 
Now is even a busier time for quilting. 
It was at a standstill for a long time. 
They use quilts in new, modern homes 
and have them match their decor. 
Attractive quilt. Color scheme. Pattern 
is the first thing. Color. Quality 
of work. "That's the first thing I 
look for." If it is handmade, it is 
more valuable than if it is machine 
made. A craft shop owner said, 
no body would notice the poor work 
but you. Tourists don't notice 
the workmanship. Quilting, how the 
quilt is finished, where the quilting 
is done—inside the pattern or in the 
seam. It is hard quilting to quilt 
in the seam; you can't do as nice a 
job. She likes to quilt l/8 inch 
from the seam. That’s a matter of 
opinion. In the seams it is hard. 
That's why you should press your 
seams open to make it easier to quilt, 
especially on a hand made quilt. 
She is not sure whether to do the 
flower garden in the seam or outside 
the seam. 
The piecing or quilting most important. 
The piecing is most important. The 
corners must match; you can't do as 
nice a job in quilting. This is 
true with the Double Wedding Ring 
especially. Story about a lady 
who donated two Double Wedding Rings 
that didn’t match in the corners. 
The corners must match; second would 
come the quilting. The squares must 
match; the seams must line up. 
Comments about her quilts. Only 
complements. The quality of quilting, 
the quality of putting them together. 
"I am kind of fussy about that.” 
"If it's worth taking all that time, 
page 4 
GT-t4| 
370 - 377 
377 - 400

429 - 431 
it's worth doing well." In the 
flower garden, she had to take up 
the seams in some of the squares to 
make them match. "It wasn't easy," 
hut I enjoy it. 
Why she enjoys it. It's something I 
feel I can do a nice joh on. "I 
know I can do it." 
Changes. "I have improved in the 
quality of work I do." She looked 
at an applique she had done; she 
does better work now. She can do 
a better job. 
She had made 30 applique quilts, and 
more pieced quilts. Most people 
shy away from the appliques. She 
has done a number of Lone Stars. 
In a year, you wouldn't do too 
many. They did five last winter. 
They did seven all totaled last 
year.

Missouri. Quilt No. 58. She never 
made any of these quilts. Ladies 
Art Company, St. Louis, Missouri. 
Quilt No. 58, The Cherry Basket. 
She just never got around to making 
it although it is pretty. A lady 
from the state mental hospital 
wanted patterns for her patients to 
work on. 
Gentlemen’s Fancy. They list the colors 
for you, tell you the sizes, the 
number of pieces to cut, and suggest 
you use sandpapter or cardboard. Ladies 
Art Company, established 1889. 
Crystal is sure they are 25 years old. 
Lily Quilt. She made some patterns from 
the Ladies Art Company, but none that 
she is showing now. She never made 
any of these we looked at. Merry 
Kite. The Goose Tracks is very pretty 
made out of pale yellow and orange. 
"I don't know what colors they call 
for here." They use lavender and 
white. They tell you how much material 
to use. They suggest that you quilt 
by the piece. Often they left it up 
to you. 
Devil's Claws. Her sister is a quilt 
fan and does such a poor job. Star 
Patchwork. Now that's pretty and 
that's not hard to do. Diamond 
Star. Eleven yards for that one, if 
you buy new fabric. Cube Lattis.

any of them in your quilt. Star and 
Cubes. Hands All Around. That’s kind 
of cute. 
Lockhart's C otton Batting Company. 
Wurtzburg's Original Master Quilting 
Patterns, a book of quilting patterns. 
Many of these patterns are not common 
because they're too hard. Clam Shell 
quilting. Carbon paper for tracing 
off the quilting patterns. Double 
Feather border is real hard. I 
usually do it the way it is easier. 
This book is from 19^1» These 
patterns came from the same period 
of time, so they must be almost 40 
years old. "I doubt if you could 
buy them now.” Cable pattern quilting 
wouldn't be hard. I still have more 
of them packed away somewhere. 
Crystal's sister bought them for her 
all at the same time. Some may be 
from Ladies Art, and some might not. 
Crystal says she has a lot more 
patterns. 
Books. Herrschners Catalog, Fall 1978, 
Steven's Point, Wisconsin. Out of 
Circulation, Heirloom Quilts to 
Treasure* Thirty Traditional Patterns 
for Piecing and Appliquing, Compiled 
and edited by the editors of the 
Progressive Farmer Magazine, Oxmoor 
House, Birmingham, Alabama; Southern

uses the suggested color schemes. 
Patterned materials in the Calico 
Rose. McCall's Catalog. She also 
had another catalog, but she can't 
remember the name of it. 
Her husband hooks rugs and does a 
beautiful job with needlepoint. He 
does a nicer job on the back than 
she does.

They hook their rugs from kits most of 
the time. Her niece, who is an 
artist, draws pictures on canvas 
for them to hook. Her husband 
taught her niece how to hook rugs 
the faster way. They are very 
expensive.

Food Preservation 
Index # Outline 
5-71 Potatoes. Forty bushels being stored 
with lime. They won't rot at all 
with white lime on them. She will 
sell some of the potatoes because 
they will freeze down here in the 
root cellar. Her family gets their 
potatoes from her all winter. A 
bushel would last them all winter. 
They will keep a bushel down here 
and cover them up so they won’t 
freeze. She sells them to people 
who stop by the house. They sell 
for $5 a bushel. She put them in 
the cellar two weeks ago. The lime 
dries them out and won't let them 
rot. It is just plain white lime. 
One of their sons told them to use 
the lime. They had ten rows of 
potatoes this time, but it was a 
good season for potatoes. 
71 - Planting signs. She uses them when 
she can; sometimes you can't wait 
until the sign is right. Good sign 
is in the Head, Twins; she doesn't 
like to plant when the points of 
the moon are up. All the roots will 
come up above the ground. She watche 
the points of the moon most often. 
Roots of onions won't stay in the 
ground; she believes in the signs. 
Bad signs. She doesn't follow the 
almanac; she only uses the good 
signs in the head or twins, or when 
the moons are turned down.

Story about the signs. She told 
Van Miller that if he planted his 
corn by the signs, he'd have a 
better crop. He said he wasn't 
planting on the moon. She said 
she knew that. All the old people 
went by the signs. The young 
people don't pay any attention to 
them. 
She doesn't can by the signs. She 
won't pickle beans if the sign is 
not in the head. She won't pickle 
any beans when the signs get below 
the waist. She follows the signs 
for kraut and beans. She never 
went by signs for other types of 
pickles. 
Canned foods. Some of it is from 
last year. She has canned beans, 
peaches, tomatoes, corn, pears, 
bread and butter pickles; she 
can't remember what all she has. 
Applesauce and pickle beans are 
upstairs yet. Preserves and apple 
butter. She has no idea how many 
cans she has in here. She never 
counts them. She poured out a lot 
of stuff last spring; it had been 
canned so long that it had spoiled. 
Some beets they kept over the 
winter weren’t fit to eat, so she 
poured them out to get the cans. 
They didn't put them in the ground; 
they just kept them in the cellar 
and they were tough. 
Canned foods. Carrots; made last 
year, they are a little darker than 
the newer ones. Cracklings. After 
you stew your lard out, you just 
put the cracklings in a can and 
seal them up. Her son puts the 
cracklings between two pieces of 
bread and makes a sandwich. You 
can make shortening bread out of 
them. Crackling bread and shortening 
bread are the same thing. Her mother 
always canned the cracklings. They 
also made soap out of the cracklings; 
they put lye in a bag with the cracklings 
in a pot. The grease that is left is 
used to make soap. She never made 
any soap because she didn't have 
a giim to drip the lye from. 
Kraut. Grape Juice. She makes the 
jelly out of it as she wants to. 
It's better to make it fresh.

GT-f-1/! 
254 - 369 Bread and butter pickles. Mustard 
pickles. It makes good potato 
salad because it is so sour. Tomatoes. 
Peach preserves. Pickle beans. Apple 
Butter. She put cinnamon candies in 
it to make it red, and give it a 
cinamon flavor. She makes another 
kind that you can make in 20 minutes 
but you add vinegar to it; she doesn’t 
like it as well. Her daughter-in-law 
gave her the recipe. They also made 
some outside in an old black pot. 
Apple butter made in the pot is 
darker and tastes really good. 
369 - 474 Blackberries. "First one and then 
another one" told her how to make 
preserves. She made apple butter 
three different ways. One made in 
the black pot had sugar in it instead 
of the molasses the old people used 
to use. Edd's mother made her apple 
butter in a small molasses boiler. 
She could make 15 bushels of apples 
in that thing. Took all day long 
to make it. Another way to make 
apple butter is to use 11 cups of 
fruit and 13 cups of sugar and 
some cinamon candy; it takes a half 
day to cook it. When you use vinegar, 
it takes only 20 minutes to cook it. 
She cooks it in the oven. It pops 
too much when it is cooked in the 
house. Can of blackberries. Apple 
relish. Pickle beans. Canned 
green beans. Apple sauce. 
Pickle beets.

Cellar was built when the house was 
built. Mr. Higgins father probably 
built it; it might be 100 years old. 
Mr. Higgins, who is 75 years old, was 
born here. 
Jelly. Apple jelly. Made it this year 
from apple peelings and apples; she 
cooks the apples, uses the juice for 
apple jelly, and the apples for apple 
butter. Chow-chow. Applesauce. It 
is trying to separate because it is 
from early harvest apples. They are 
a watery apple. Chow-chow made with¬ 
out red pepper. Peaches. Pears. 
Carrots. Strawberries. Tomatoes. 
Beets. Sausage. You just grind it, 
fry it, and put it in your cans, and 
seal it up. Ribs. Not many people 
can meat these days; she loves to 
can. Sweet potatoes. Peaches are 
about to spoil. Corn. She never 
has trouble keeping corn. Margaret’s 
always flat sours. Beef stock for 
soup. Peas. Pickled cucumbers. 
"I don't know what-all is back in 
yonder.” It's been several years 
since I canned some of it. Corn. 
Apple juice for jelly. Grape juice. 
Tomato juice. Kraut. Pumpkin. She 
hasn’t made kraut in a crock in a long 
time. 
She used to make it in a jar, but it's 
easier to make it in a can. Cabbage 
heads. Pickled corn. She pickles 
it in a jar, and when it sours, she 
puts it in a can. You just take it

out of the jar on the cob and eat 
it as a relish. The young-un's just 
come down here and get it out of 
the can. 
Hominy. "I love that stuff too." 
Recipe. "Takes you all day to make 
it." She didn't have time to make 
last year. Her mother used to take 
the husk off of hers with soda. 
Beans. She cans the most beans and 
peaches. She has canned 80 quarts 
of beans, and sixty quarts of peaches. 
She cans a bushel of sweet potatoes. 
She doesn't can if she already has 
enough cans in the cellar. 
Pumpkin butter. Her mother made it, 
and you could cut it out like jelly. 
Her's all spoiled. Her mother's 
would keep for two or three years. 
She made it with sugar just like 
you do apple butter. She cooked 
it a lot longer. She can mix 
molasses with it and it will keep, 
but she can't make it last with 
pure sugar. Her mother didn't know 
what was wrong with it either. 
She has never made peach butter. 
She did make tomato butter. You just 
put it on biscuits and butter. It 
takes a long time to cook, and she 
thinks it is really good. 
All this canned food will last her 
a lifetime. She cans to keep the 
food from wasting. She shares with 
her family. But most of her 
children have all they use, except 
for those in Raleigh. The gardens 
burn up down there. She has seen 
beans down there just burned up; 
they look like they were scalded. 
She also thinks that the garden 
next year might not be so good; last 
year they didn't have many beans. 
Black-eyed peas. She doesn't eat 
shell beans. People can to keep 
from buying it from the store. 
"They can raise it cheaper than they 
can buy it." It tastes better. 
"I'd rather have mine than buy it 
out of the store." She doesn't 
like to buy vegetables from the 
supermarket. Meats are okay. She 
used to her own canned food. Her 
canned food has a better taste. 
They used to raise their own beef, 
which tasted better to her. Now 
they have to buy it from the store. 
page 3 
GT- £-4 ^ 
35^ - ^85 She goes to grocery store to buy 
flour, sugar, and a few things 
they don't raise themselves. 
They raised two hogs last year. 
She doesn't want smoked meat; 
they use sugar cure salt on the 
pork. In the spring they wash 
the meat, put it in sacks, and put 
borax and pepper on it to keep the 
bugs off it. They make sausage 
and cure the rest of it to use as 
they need. She grinds her own 
sausage, but it is pretty hard to 
turn on her own. Last year she 
took it to Smithy's. She has a 
hard time grinding the meat. 
The family helped her grind it in 
the past. She cans 80 pounds of 
sausage each year. She doesn't like 
the cold pack method of canning 
sausage; she prefers to make her's 
in patties and fry it before she 
puts it into the can. She cans 
70 pints of sausage. That lasts 
about one year. They didn’t buy 
a hog last year, so they won't 
have one to slaughter this year.

broomstraws. Her father made her 
some knitting needles which she still

he made some of the furniture she 
has in her house. Her father was a 
natural born miller. 
One of her father’s brothers was "a 
roving gambler." He moved to Texas 
and back; he was a trader. There 
were three preachers in the family. 
She has the Simmons family book; it 
was a big family and she paid $5 for 
the book. Her father didn't move 
around much; once when there was

They went out and caught two horses 
and road the mountain trails. They 
led the nags along the trail. On 
the way home they went along the 
highway. They switched horses, and 
her's ran away. She was the only 
"monkey" in the family; she liked 
adventure. 
Her brother depends on her; she is like 
his mother. She loves her family, 
her friends, and her Club. The only 
reason I hate to die is because I'll 
leave my friends behind. The sting 
of death is having to leave your 
friends. "I have done lived." She 
is still trying to keep on keeping on. 
Courtship Days. She started courting 
at 16. She only dated two fellows 
before she married. She met Kelly 
near Christmas, and they were married 
in the following October. The boys

Story about a visit to Uncle Emory. 
She asked him if he would like to 
hear a joke or be told about the 
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He 
preferred the joke. She told him 
the joke about Democrats and 
Republicans. "I didn’t know there 
was that much difference in a 
Democrat and Republican." Another 
joke. Two children wanted to be 
Christians. "I know. We're 
Pisscopalians." 
She goes to the rest home, but doesn’t 
tell these jokes down there. Story 
about "an old colored girl," Beulah, 
who is in the rest home. She brought 
her some presents on her birthday; 
"she just shouted all over everything. 
Story about Rufus who also stayed 
with Beulah's grandparents. She cut 
of his finger on a dare. He didn't 
have to go to the army because it 
was his trigger finger. They whipped 
her for that. They used to beat her 
with a stick of stovewood; Roxie's 
father went down and told them to 
quit beating her. "Colored people's 
head was hard." She is a good, 
Christian girl. 
She is on the child abuse committee for 
the county. Too many children in 
Surry County have no home to go to.

100 - 146 Her work with a poverty program. People 
on food stamps don't buy their food 
wisely. Parents are too lazy to fix 
a balanced meal. 
146 - 210 Depression. People working on the road 
for the WPA cleaned out the road banks 
and cemetery. Tobacco brought $9; 
didn't even pay for the fertilizer. 
Big Mac overalls were $49 a pair. She 
made a dress for her little girl for 
30. She used the buttons from her 
mother's wedding blouse. She canned. 
She quilted for $1. Some people 
probably went hungry. No one would 
plow their corn. She took a boy out 
of the County Home; she also raised 
a niece after her mother died. Her 
brother was killed when he ran into 
the Alamance Bridge. 
210 - 322 She tried to get help to plow so she 
could plant a crop. No one would 
plow for them for wages; they would 
go to town and get the commodity 
foods. She and the boy plowed the 
field. They would plow two rows and 
rest; they plowed the 12 acres of 
corn while the Chatham boys rode by 
and laughed. Kelly had a wrenched 
leg. The doctors took his tonsils 
out, but the doctors finally dis¬ 
covered the wrenched knee. During 
the Depression, people were able 
to work but they wouldn't. They 
were too lazy. They were getting 
their food and had easy jobs working

on the roads. They would go to Dobson 
on Thursday nights and get their new 
clothes. But, "we lived." They had 
to take care of the old people too. 
No one was drawing social security 
or county checks. People were living 
too good to work. Story about taking 
a man to Mt. Airy to get a welfare 
child to work on the farm. His 
brother went to pick up his free food. 
"That's the only time I think I ever 
got mad." He didn't pay a thing for 
going over there. Mr. Hays didn't 
need the boy, so Roxie took him. 
She got 10 or 15 dollars a month for 
taking care of him. He was eleven 
years old. "I forgot I was on tape." 
That's the way we had to live; now 
look how they're doing. They can 
get most anything from welfare. Those 
girls have two or three children and 
they're not married. She has worked 
with welfare. At one time, she had 
three aged parents to take care of. 
Washing clothes. Sometimes she had to 
hang out 13 feed meal sack sheets at 
a time. Kelly's father had a skin 
disease. It was a hard life, but 
it's been worth it. Her early days 
were more enjoyable. 
She loves that Old mill with a passion. 
She kept her Dad's books at the mill. 
She used a ledger. The Sexton at 
church would tote the Intern. She 
bought the lantern and found the 
pump later. 
We was mean when we went to school. 
There were no kids involved with 
sex or drugs. They would get around 
the stove, and their feet would stink.7* 
Story about dipping snuff in school. 
"We'd keep that thing in a fog all 
the time." Story about Miss Elsie 
and the time someone pulled the 
chair out from under her. "I 
was good enough' to let you laugh, 
now you be good enough not to tell

4-37 Childhood pranks. Father told stories 
about ghosts and pranks. Story 
about walking by a Church with a 
ghost in the window. She believed 
what her father said. "Rock them" 
means to throw rocks at a rival. 
37 - 75 She was afraid of Santa Claus. Story 
about the first time Santa visited 
her house. She was afraid. She 
got a doll, Doughface, when she was 
13* "It's a doozy." Santa Claus 
had rabbit skins on as beards. Got 
a stick of candy, an orange, and a 
apple. The first thing she got for 
Christmas was a set of tin silverware. 
They had Christmas programs at school 
and Church. 
75 - 188 Box Suppers. One night they were bidding 
on a box of her's; she didn't want 
to eat with him. Her boyfriend paid 
$8 for her box lunch. That started 
their courtship. He married some of 
his own folks. Her father told her, 
"If it's char-ac-ter, that's all 
you've got Roxie." When you lose 
that, you can't ever get it back. 
She didn’t know what character meant. 
She has learned so many things since 
she got out of school. She didn't 
want to go to high school and ride 
the bus. She has lived within 8 miles 
of Elkin all her life. They worked 
on the community building. They 
went over to Picshin for the Home¬ 
maker's Club where they were going 
to have a barn raising. The women

put in a floor. She wants to keep 
busy. The world is full of people 
who are just sitting around. "They 
don't get a thing out of life." 
The women are worser than men. Story 
about women who help men rob cars. 
She is never going to stop for a 
blue light. There hafftbeen 20 incidents 
of a woman stopping for a man she 
thinks is a policeman. She keeps her 
car doors locked. 
Some women have had a hard time. Some 
women have made it hard of them¬ 
selves. I don't think it should 
all be packed off on the men. 
Jealousy is a problem. We all try 
to keep up with the Joneses. When 
she had little children, she had to 
charge items; now she doesn't. Maybe 
it was because women went to work and 
let someone else take care of their 
children. Some just left their 
children with just anybody. 
Quilting. Not many women bother with 
quilting. Her niece is a seamstress, 
but she can't quilt. Quilting is her 
hobby; she can do the fans because 
she is really long. She will put the 
quilt in'on Tuesday if we can come 
back then. 
Some of the women don't know anything 
about quilting. They quilted one 
for the Senior Citizens and got points 
for their club. Only three of the 
ladies in the Club quilt. Marie Snyder 
doesn't know anything about quilts. 
Alice Cockerham cooks dinner for them. 
Kate Henson and Eileen Henson are the 
other quilters. They will quilt this 
quilt. They might quilt it by the fan; 
Roxie likes the fan awfully well. 
She may bind it or put the lining up 
on the top. They just chalk the first 
fan. There are only 9 in the club. 
Learned how to quilt since she was 
married. Her mother never quilted; 
she never had quilting frames. She 
picked the seeds out of the cotton 
and made their own bats for the filler. 
She would quilt out a quilt in one 
day. It was hard work to get one out 
in a day. Her mother-in-law could

brings them to a meeting. They are 
too much trouble, especially for an 
Association. 
Cooking ori the stove. String beans. 
Hot dogs. Chili. Slaw for hot dogs. 
Ketschup and onions. Fried chicken. 
Potato salad. Macaroni salad. Green 
Bean salad. Fruit salad. Tomatoes. 
Cucumbers. Onions. More fried 
chicken. 
How to make good fried chicken. Put 
butter or Crisco in the pan. Put 
flour, salt and pepper, and chicken 
seasonings on the chicken, and put 
it in the pan and let it brown. 
Slaw. Recipe. Onions are optional. 
Slaw dressing is like mayonaise; you 
can buy it in the store. Tomatoes. 
Sandwiches. Chocolate pie. Sweet 
potato pie. Potato salad. 
They have been feeding at least 100 a 
day. Today there will be 300 or 400 
people at the meeting. Sodas are 
outside. Coffee. 
They feed the delegates on Friday and 
Saturday. On Sunday they feed every¬ 
one. A committee from the church 
has organized the food for the 
meeting. They will make a profit 
today. They want to enlarge the 
building in which they fix the food. 
The building was built for the last 
Association meeting 13 years ago. 
They Use it for Communion once a year; 
they have special dinners in the building. 
They don't have a basement. They serve 
the food outside when the weather is 
good. They need a bigger building 
because they don't have enough seating 
room. They could feed a lot more 
people. If they sell out the food, 
they might make $600 or $700. Some 
people bring their own food to the 
meeting. 
"you should have been here yesterday 
when we had all the food set up." 
Everybody just served themselves. 
Yesterday they had ham, deviled eggs, 
sweet potatoes, macaroni and cheese, 
potato salad, green bean salad, macaroni 
salad, rolls, light bread, chocolate 
pie, lemon pie, coconut pie, apple pie, 
pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, pecan 
pie, all the cakes, tomatoes, cucumbers. 
They have chicken and dumplings in the 
homes but not at Church. I’ve never 
seen that out at church. It is 
more difficult to serve. They have 
turkey and dressing and gravy, string

beans, sweet potatoes sometimes. They 
may have a ham dinner at the church. 
Some people don't like chicken and 
dumplings; we have never tried it. 
Chicken pie has never been served 
here. They had baked beans yesterday. 
They bring corn bread sometimes and 
greens. They didn't bring any this 
time. They bring mustard greens, turnip 
greens. Crackling bread. People are 
getting away from that now. She likes 
it about once a year; they never 
bring it to church. Baked apples and 
baked pears they bring to meetings. 
Stuffed peppers. Picklebeets. Bread 
and butter pickles. Dill pickles. 
Pickled peaches. 
Good canner or cook in the area. Mrs. 
Young freezes a lot; she has done more 
canning than usual this year. She 
made pickles and jellies this year 
and she never has before. They turned 
out well. She used a cookbook. Her 
aunt always canned and froze food. 
She canned all sorts of food. Now 
most people freeze. Her aunt made 
kraut and pickle beans. She made 
kraut last year. They bring out 
pickle beans for a family reunion, 
so many people come from out of town 
and you bring out everything you can. 
It is too much trouble to get it all 
together. 
A few people make leather britches. She 
hasn't done it in years. They have 
never served any at church. The 
younger people don't know too much 
about leather britches. Dried apples 
for pies. Her aunt sliced the apples 
and put them on brown paper and set 
them in the sun. She would string 
the leather britches. Apple butter. 
She made it in a big black kettle. 
It takes all day to make it. Mrs. 
Young made it the old-timey way a 
few years ago; it is better to cook 
it outside. Her grandmother made 
hominy in a big iron pot outside. 
People don't do that anymore.

Explaining how to crochet an afghan. 
"She's making a Navajo Indian blanket. 
Rozella tells a story about a possum 
eating her cat's food. Another 
story about shooting a bear who 
turned out to be a man. Rozella 
tells another story about a peach 
salesman. He asked if she had a 
gun. "Dad burn if you're ready to 
die, I ain't got a bit more sense 
than to shoot you." That man never 
came back. She would have shot him. 
"I could tell you another tale. It's 
the truth." Story about some varmint 
making noise one hour after they 
went to bed. Her son shot at the r 
sound of the varmint. If you see 
buzzards, don't go up there. It 
was somebody up there trying to scare 
them. She ran off one intruder with 
the dogs. 
Ruth tells a story of someone messing 
around her house when the power was ^ 
off. "The bulldog was under the ** 
bed." 
Rozella's story about someone bothering 
her house. She sent the dog after 
the man's britches. He didn't mess 
around anymore either. 
Rozella tells another story; no one 
answered when she asked who was at 
the door. It was her sons-in-law. 
People will stand in the yard and 
call her. She would have shot them.

Most of the drunks are dead or moved 
away. No more varmints around now 
either. 
One of Rozella's hoys almost got shot 
one night. They were going to scare 
her by making noise. The flashlight 
shown just above their heads; they 
got scared and thought they would 
be shot. 
She had a dog that would cuss. The 
dog would bark and say, "dam, dam, 
god damn. "It got on my nerves." 
She gave it to a preacher. I have 
wished I had that dog back. 
She laughed at that dog; he cussed all h/ 
night long. It was part wire-haired 
terrier. She gave it to a young 
preacher in Elkin. 
Big rattlesnake. It was 39" long. It 
made a good pot of dumplings. That's 
the highest priced meat you can buy; 
marsh rabbit. High priced meats; I 
don't know whether it's horse or dog. 
Rozella tells a story about her son's 
pheasants. He thought it was dead 
until the old turkey gobbler came 
running up. 
Discussion of the width of the afghan. 
You could make baby afghans if you 
used baby colors on it. You could 
use it as a shawl. Rozella says 
she is part Indian. 
Ruth says, "The last time I cut my finger 
I had colored blood." It was red. 
Juanita can crochet fast. She uses powder 
on her hands when they sweat while she 
is crocheting. Wool makes Rozella’s 
hands itch. 
Embroidery design that is 80 years old. 
She copied the design off an embroidered 
piece and painted it on cloth with 
Artex paint. She made some for her 
granddaughters. She is just learning 
how to paint on fabric. Paint work 
is "pretty work;" it’s smooth although 
it looks like it's raised up. They 
will sell as fast as she can make them. 
She makes the pillowcases out of bed- 
sheets. Clothespin bags and dresser 
scarves have been sold. She copies 
off the embroidery designs and paints 
them. 
Juanita has a pattern her mother embroidered. 
She would like to copy it on a piece 
of cloth. Ruth is looking for her old 
pillowcase. Rozella’s piece is at 
least 80 years old.

Ruth has some old patterns upstairs in 
an old trunk. 
Rozella borrowed the pattern she copied 
from her daughter? her daughter thought 
she had made it. She had forgotten 
about it. She had crocheted around the 
scarf. 
Ruth can’t afford to sell the dresser 
scarves she bought the other day. The 
scarves cost $3 apiece. 
Rozella says you have to buy the seconds 
bed sheets; then, she can make clothes¬ 
pin bags and sell them. 
Betty's crochet work. She didn’t make a 
chain between each row.

Juanita tells about granddaughter seeing 
a corncob; "that's toilet paper." 
Rozella tells about "buttwipers;" they 
got some longer sticks and made back¬ 
scratchers. 
Ruth tells how to flush the toilet; ^1^ 
"pull a weed through the crack and ^ 
twist it." 
Rozella tells about Sunday School teacher 
who said all the clothes people had 
on was two little square pieces. 
Ruth tells story of girl who had on a 
small bikini—two bandaids on her 
nipples. The boys whistled and she 
got mad. "There were no bandaids in 
Elkin as big as the ones she had on." 
Juanita tells a story about a man and 
a woman riding horseback; the girl 
took her shirt off. "She didn’t have 
on a bra." 
Rozella tells about a see through blouse. 
Ruth tells about the boy who came in . 
in cut-offs; there was something white 
hanging down and it wasn’t the corner ^ 
of his pocket either. "I didn't say 
a word ugly." . 
A lot of people make fun oflbur out-door 
plumbing. An artist wanted a photo 
of the outhouse; she wanted Ruth to 
go in and sit down. 
One girl had on ruffled step-ins and a 
man's undershirt for a dress. "The 
road is quiet today compared to what 
it generally is." 
Ruth didn't want to go for a ride;"I 
can see enough here at the shop."

She hasn't been to the park when there’s 
a crowd there. Discussion of the road 
to the park from Roaring Gap. 
Story about getting lost in Airedale County 
told by Rozella. "The roads is got 
signs on them." 
Ruth tells a joke she read in Blum's 
Almanac. She's got"a good chair on 
the porch." 
"Tell her about the hillside shoes." 
Marvin Lyons. Made a mistake in the 
crocheting. Marvin helped her with the 
hillside shoes joke. 
You meet all kinds of things in a public 
place. Rozella tells of an old white 
haired in her husband's jogging shorts. 
Painted up woman who looked more like 
a mannequin. Her eyelids were blue. 
Rozella looks to see how the "bottom 
end is painted." 
Rozella tells about the woman with a 
butterfly tatooed on her butt. The 
last thing that goes out the door is 
a butterfly. She saw a man who had a 
rabbit tatooed on his belly; the naval 
was its butt-end. "Ive often wondered 
what was on the other side." 
Ruth tells a joke about a little boy crying. 
"Her coattails so short I can't reach it." 
Rozella tells of the old man who went to 
Mt. Airy. He wet on the street. "I may 
want to wet again before I get out of 
Mt. Airy." 
Police wet along the road "for you can see 
the water falling." What can we do about 
it. They throw rocks at the signboard. 
They should obey the laws themselves. 
The bathrooms at Elkin are locked up. Rozella 
is going to get a johnny for her car. A 
family uses that bathroom regularly and 
they tear the public one up. 
Rozella's family will be hunting her. She 
needs to get some dirt. She's going to 
draw a pattern. She needs a box. They 
have some Indian patterns, an owl, a 
woman. "That's a beautiful pillowcase." 
A woman ironing. A woman hanging clothes. 
Some of them won't be so hard to paint. 
"Smile, God loves you." If you get your 
iron too hot the first time, they don't 
do so good the second time. That one 
needs some more added to it. "How 
about this little basket."

Rozella looking for the apron she 
painted. They don't know if it 
is sold or not. They were going 
to put it on the mannequin. "Here 
it is." She would rather paint them 
than embroider them. The paint won’t 
fade. She painted some shirts for 
her grandson. 
Juanita's crochet work. She works on 
her crocheting everytime she sits 
down. Ruth would like to crochet 
if the dog won't interfere. "He's 
a bull." Rozella's kitten kept 
getting her balls of yarn so she 
threw him on the porch. 
Bull came through the screendoor when 
he heard the backhoe come down the 
road.

The three room house where she was 
born. She was born in the middle 
room. The house burned down 16 
years ago. Her mother carried water 
one-quarter mile up hill to their 
house. It was located four miles 
from here, on the Carrico farm. 
The family moved to Maryland after 
she was born; theey went to North 
Wilkesboro in a covered wagon. 
Her brothers and sisters were dead. 
The twin girls starved to death; her 
mother didn't give milk and no one 
would sell it to them. There was 
nine in all. Two children died in 
Baltimore. They lived on a dairy 
farm in Maryland; the man took her 
to the hospital because she had 
rickets. "I really don't think 
my mother fed the children if you 
want to know the truth about it." 
She didn't want us. Her brother was 
9 years 6 months when he died; he 
did the washing and cooking. Her 
mother was German and the Carricos 
wouldn't sell them milk. They fed 
the milk to the hogs and chickens. 
He quit working for them after they 
refused to sell him milk in 1920. 
She grew up during the Depression. 
Her brother died of appendicitis; 
her mother wouldn’t let him go to 
the hospital. Dr. Higgins operated 
on him on the kitchen table. He 
got blood poisoning.

Seven were born to her. One died at 9. 
The twins were just under a year old. 
The rest died before they were six 
months old. One in Maryland had crib 
disease and the other one had croup. 
They were born in Maryland. She 
would have died if the nurse wouldn’t 
have taken her away. They stole her 
out of the hospital. She had rickets 
brought on by starvation. Her father 
told her later; her mother denied it. 
She can't remember. She stayed with 
her grandparents after they returned. 
Her grandmother was a midwife and fed 
her. 
She was born July 4, 1924. She was number 
seven and then there were two more. She 
remembers the baby ones. She called it 
Dolly; she cried when she heard Dolly was 
dead. She made a little casket. It’s 
buried in Baltimore; the other one is 
buried in Shuckses Corner, Maryland. 
All the others -were dead before she 
was born. He lived the longest of those 
before her. 
Her father and brother did the washing and 
ironing; her mother either was not able 
or wouldn’t do it. She stayed with a 
woman, Mae Holler, and she helped her father 
wash. She doesn't know why her mother 
didn't wash. Mae Holler, Maude Myers, 
and her grandparents raised her. "I coould 
get something to eat over there.” I coould 
eat at home when Daddy was there. "I 
have an idea there was food there." Daddy 
got a cow and we did have milk and bread. 
She could cook if preachers would be there. 
That's about the only time she fed us. 
If her father killed a chicken, he'd 
have domething else for her to eat. They 
had leather britches and canned goods. 
Leather Britches. There were times when 
they did not have anything to eat. They 
had milk and mush during the depression. 
She was in and out of the home during 
that time. Her father worked at the 
sawmill and farmed. Some paid him in 
food and others paid him cash. In bad 
weather, they sometimes didn’t have 
enough to eat. In 1941 they all moved 
into one house. Her mother worked there; 
they quilted, milked cows, and kept the 
fires going. It was right after the 
depression, but still it was real rough 
times. Her father was the constable. 
Her father had two pairs of patched 
overalls. Constable job paid 250 a 
day. Liquor cost 500 a gallon. He 
worked on the sawmill too; the man 
who owned the sawmill had six kids too. 
303 - 330 
330 - 455 
455 - 470 
He had it rougher than they did and he 
owned the sawmill. 
He took up milling after he stopped work 
at the sawmill. He did milling before 
she was born; he moved back to the mill 
in 1945 until 1958. She couldn't run 
the mill herself, and he couldn't help 
her, so they quit. He could draw a 
welfare check. He ruptured his stomach 
and couldn't work again. 
He went to Baltimar because his people were 
up there; he went there to strike it 
rich. They sold everything to get up 
there; it wasn't any better up there 
than it was down here. He worked at 
a dairy and moved from one to another. 
His uncle gave them the money to send 
Ruth and her mother home. Her father 
worked to pay for their transportation 
home. "They may be hunting for me 
in Baltimore yet." They stole her 
away in 1926 or 192? from John Hopkins 
in Bethesda (?). She had been there 
three weeks. They thought the hospital 
would put her up for adoption; "I might 
have been better off." I wouldn't have 
been treated the way I was; she had to 
give her mother half of her pay. She 
had to work for two hours to get a bottle 
of pop. It's easy now to what it was 
then. Menfolks got 500 a day and flour 
was 800 a bag. n 
People enjoyed themselves more. They 
visited. They went to church or 
revivals.

Early life, Quilting 
Index # Outline 
1-46 Learned how to quilt at six. Her 
mother quilted. She made her 
first quilt by herself at 12; 
it was a rag quilt made out of old 
shirttails and dresses. It was 
padded with rags and had chop sacks 
for the bottom. Maybe they were sacks 
from the still place. She made her 
clothes out of sacks. She picked 
blackberries for two sacks to make 
a dress. The sacks were dyed green; 
her mother wouldn't let her have a 
red dress. Everything she cwnshas 
some red in it. Her top is a sack. 
She still wears sacks. Hog feed 
bag sacks. 
46 - 106 She made two quilts this year. She 
teaches the class for Wilkes Community 
College. She quilts in the summertime 
because there's no place to quilt in 
the house in the winter. She pieces 
in the wintertime. She is also 
crocheting a bedspread. She quilts 
in the evening when the soap operas 
are on—she watches them from 1:30 
to 4:00. The quilts at the shop. 
She sells her quilts. She kept 
enough to keep her bed warm, but 
she sold most of them. The ones 
she uses at the house, "there's not 
much work in them." She sews them 
on the sewing machine and quilts them 
with big stitches. If she can get 
sacks, she sews them together, and 
that's it. She fills them with rags.

She bastes the rags together and sews 
the top on. She uses old curtains for 
a backing if she has them. She has one 
now made totally of sacks. She does the 
fan pattern of four lines. She can 
do one in a day. 
Fancy quilting. It takes from 6 to 12 weeks 
to quilt one. She uses Mountain Mist 
cotton or polyester for filler. She 
uses matching material for the backing. 
She pieces the tops for fancy quilts. 
The quilt she has now is printed; it is 
quilted by the design. The wife of 
the president of Chatham Manufacturing 
brought in those quilts. They are the 
only ones she has ever done. The 
printed pattern makes easier quilting, 
but yet it is not the old original thing. 
In piecing, you put 16 stitches to an inch. 
In quilting, it's 10 to 12 per inch for 
fancy quilts. Fancy quilts are to be 
sold; she gave two to her son who didn’t 
appreciate them. He won't get anymore. 
She is going to make a crocheted bedspread 
for him. 
She still makes the plain ones for her own 
use. She never tacks a quilt unless she 
is covering an old quilt. The tacks 
tickle her face. 
Visit from Ila Parks Fletcher Campbell. 
Had to get food out of the slop bucket. 
She wanted some jelly so bad. Story about 
taking some jelly. She had to eat 
boiled fish heads while the rest of the 
family ate the fish. Story about the 
little girl in the house she lived in; 
she'd tear up her clothes and tease her 
and Ila would get the beating. She'd 
get beaten with a cane or umbrella. 
She would tote water, wood, and rake 
leaves. She didn't know what a good 
pair of shoes was. "I've come through 
so much." Then she came to Traphill. 
It wasn't much better. Story about 
having to get the cows in waist-deep 
snow in her tennis shoes. She got 
married and thought she would have 
a good time, but he drank and just wanted 
someone to take care of the children. 
"It's been hard all along. Too much. 
Too much." Then she married Preacher 
Campbell; after one year, he died in 
their pickup truck. "I can't tell no 
more." 
Fabrics in the tops of quilts. Ruth 
prefers cotton or cotton and polyester 
blends. It quilts and pieces easier. 
Heavy fabrics are too hard to sew through. 
It takes more wax on your thread.

She uses cotton when she can get it. She 
never has pieced one of doubleknit 
polyester. It just don't look right. 
"I guess I'm old-fashioned." Cotton is 
a God-made fabric. 
Filler. Uses polyester batting for anyone 
else; quilts for the house, I use rags. 
She can throw them in the washing machine. 
Backing. For the house, she uses anything 
she can get ahold of except wool or 
fiberglass. She uses cotton for the fancy 
quilts if the top is cotton; if the top 
is polyester and cotton, she uses the 
same combination for the backing. 
Favorite patterns. Poplar Leaf is the first 
quilt she ever pieced by pattern. It is 
easy pieced and easy quilted. Double 
Wedding Ring is okay, but you have to 
break your thread so much. Sometimes she 
quilts around the rings with her right 
then her left hand. She doesn't like 
to break her thread. You have to go 
into your other stitches to fasten your 
thread. Joseph Coat. Drunkard's Path. 
They are old patterns too. Some of the 
newer patterns are like a maze to put 
together; you can’t make them come out 
right. 
She orders her patterns from Grit. She 
got the Drunkard's Path from Grit and 
Trip Around the World, Maple Leaf, 
Sunbonnet Sue. She has about a thousand 
patterns in all. She keeps them in a 
dresser drawer.

Ruth made quilts since she was 6 years 
old; she had to stand at the quilting 
frame. She helped her mother and 
made quilts herself to sell. She 
sold her first one at 15 to her cousin. 
She got $3 for the first quilt she 
made, a Poplar Leaf in red and black. 
She should have made black leaves and 
red background, but she didn’t know 
the difference. She had only seen 
quilts made to use. This one was one 
of the prettiest they ever saw. It 
was big money. She made doillies for 
500 a piece. 
Teaching quilting. She started teaching 
in 1973• The Blue Ridge Opportunity 
Commission hired her. It was a program 
for supplementary income. They picked 
her because her work was the neatest. 
They bought, a number of quilts and 
showed them to Dr. Bolick at Boone. 
He picked her work. A Home Ec teacher 
helped him. They came to her, and 
she took a course in quilting. She 
took the whole course in 3 days taught 
by the lady from Boone. Ruth didn't 
want to teach the course; she helped 
organize Stone Mountain Crafts and 
the Fire Department. No one knows 
who backed it. 
She has taught the class since 1973 
everytime they get a class together. 
She teaches from threading the needle 
on up. Which end to tie the knot in.

How much wax to put on it. How to 
cut the pattern. How to cut the 
pieces. How^to press your quilt 
blocks. How to sew them together. 
How to put the lining, batten, and 
top in the frame. How to quilt. 
Learning to thread the needle is 
difficult; Ruth can do it with her 
eyes shut. She demonstrates. Some¬ 
times they make a quilt; sometimes 
they make a pillow. She shows them 
how to use a cardboard box to make 
a frame to build a pillow. Then 
sew the lining to the frame. You 
can take two yarksticks and saw 
them in half for a quilting frame 
for pillows. 
An attractive quilt. Fine stitches 
are important. The pattern it is 
quilted in and the pattern it is 
pieced in. Not all quilting patterns 
go with a quilt design. The design 
of the quilt is most important. 
Quilting patterns. Feather. Plates. 
Sunflowers. Turkey Tracks. Beehive. 
Eagle. Anyone can lay off a pattern 
in any style they want to. She uses 
Diamonds most often; they go with 
everything. You CLUi-iJ "the Star in 
the diamonds. ThenTifocks are quilted 
in either another star or in diamonds. 
Most popular patterns are Turkey Track, 
WeddingRing, Bear Paw. The Turkey 
Track is applique. The Wedding Ring 
and Bear Paw are pieced. The Poplar 
Leaf. Maple Leaf is pieced and applique. 
Dresden Plate. 
Quilting pattern. Diamond, Fan are 
popular. Quilting by the Piece. The 
patch quilts are quilted by the patch. 
By the piece is a square block. Quilting 
by the patch is around every seam. One - 
quarter of an inch from the seam. The 
piece is by the block; the patch is 
around each scrap. Ruth draws a chart 
for me.

Four ways to quilt: By the piece, 
By the patch, By the fan, diamond. 
Diamonds will go with anything; fans 
will go with crazy quilts or block 
quilts. By the piece will go with 
any of them as will by the patch. 
The patch is the most difficult and 
the most expensive. The fan is the 
"easiest and the oldest quilting pattern. 
It is coming back. Quilts completely 
faded away for awhile; everyone wanted 
Chatham blankets. They can keep a 
quilt clean as easy as a blanket and 
they’re is no lint. 
Piecing and quilting are both important. 
The fan will not go with the Trip 
Around the World; diamonds will. 
An applique quilt is ruined by quilting 
in the fans; it's supposed to be quilted 
by the design. The plain block should 
be quilted' with the design or in 
diamonds. "If you know what goes to¬ 
gether, there’s not much planning to 
do." 
Color of thread. Ruth uses the same 
color as the lining. If you want to 
reverse the quilt, you don’t want the 
quilting to show. If the thread 
matches the lining, it’s just as 
pretty on the reverse as it is on 
top. On the top it doesn't matter 
because you have all colors on the 
top. 
The lining should harmonize with the 
top of the quilt. The quilt in

frame is being made for a lady. She 
v/anted brown to match the walls in 
her room. She is quilting it in 
buttonhole thread; it is prettier but 
hard to work with. Ruth uses size 7 
quilting needle. A dressmaker's needle 
will break too much, and pop into your 
knuckle. 
Finishing up the quilt. She'll trim off 
the excess and pull the lining to the 
top and hem it. She miters the corners. 
She often pulls the lining to the top, 
which is easier done. When you bias 
tape the edge, you have to go around 
it twice. It is strongest for the 
lining to be the hem. If you sew 
anything less than one-quarter inch 
on a quilt, you’re in trouble. 
Changes. Cn the fancy quilts, she 
didn't do as good a job as she does ^ 
now. She didn't know as much about 
quilting. She used coarse thread 
such as sack ravellings on the quilt. 
They made their own thread from 
cotton. Their spool thread was not 
strong enough to quilt with. She 
used a big needle; now she knows you 
can do a better job with a shorter 
needle. 
Quilting is better. She just used 
the same materials her dresses were 
made of; she didn't press her seams 
open. She used big thread. She 
quilted them all in fans or diamonds. 
After she read some books and took 
the class, she tried to match her 
colors and her materials. She can 
sell them faster than she can make 
them. She copied patterns from books 
in those days. Now she can buy 
patterns. She matches the top and 
the bottom. She does not use knit. 
She never used polyester.

Early life. Lived with her grandparents. 
Married at 19; has 5 boys. Born in 
Yadkin County on Nov. 1, I896. Went 
to live with her grandparents at 2? 
months. 
In 1930 she moved from Yadkin County to 
Dobson. She met her husband through 
a friend in 1929* They courted in 
secret because she had been married 
before; her husband had been dead 
7 years. She had two mighty fine 
husbands. 
In Hoover time, they went to Canada to 
grow tobacco for four years. They 
got a better price for it, and it was 
easier to grow. Times were rough 
then. They could hardly pay their 
taxes and doctor bills. They worked 
in Canada so they wouldn't lose their 
home here. They had plenty to eat, 
but they didn't have the clothes people 
have now. They didn't get the money 
for their tobacco. 
Mr. Hemmings went to Canada to cure 
to^jDacco, and rented a farm there. 
They came back here to send the 
children to school. He would go up 
there early to start the tobacco in 
greenhouses; they lived on Lake Erie. 
Many people from this area went up to 
Canada to grow tobacco; many went up 
there to cure it because they didn't 
have the experienced hands to do it. 
Some still go up there to cure tobacco. 
It helped them get on their feet 
page 2 
and pay their bills here. 
102 - 173 Household tasks. She made coverlets, 
blankets, and quilts. They had a 
500 acre farm. She helped her 
grandmother quilt; she made 3 quilts 
last winter for her grandchildren. 
Her grandmother taught her to quilt; 
she made them from scraps. They 
bought pieces to "set" them together. 
They padded them with cotton. We 
don't make thick quilts like we used 
to because we have warmer houses. 
They always bought their cotton padding, 
and quilted it by the fans or by the 
piece; mostly her grandmother quilted 
by the fans. She marked it off with 
a crayon and a thread. Alma usually 
quilts her's in the fans. If she 
would have made fancy quilts, she 
would have quilted them by the piece. 
You go around the square or the diamond 
piece in quilting by the piece. She 
makes mostly block quilts lately. 
Trip Around the World. 
173 - 280 Her grandmother wove carpet, coverlets, 
and blankets. She has one of her 
grandmother's coverlets. She painted 
the old homeplace. The carpet was 
striped in the warp. They wove it 
in stripes, solid, or kind of mixed 
up. They used old clothes then, and 
cut it in strips and tackUit. Alma 
wove carpet on the old loom. She was 
small when they quit weaving; they 
could buy it cheaper. Alma wore home¬ 
made clothes and petticoats. Her 
grandmother wove the material for her 
grandfather's pants. They used the 
carpet in the living room and the parlor. 
Sometimes they had it in the kitchen 
in front of the stove. She had one 
layer of carpet. They would whip the 
pieces together to fit the room. 
Her grandmother was a Flemming; they 
were "Dutch." Uncle John Flemming 
also had homemade carpet in the living 
room, bedroom, parlor, and on the stair¬ 
way. They made their wool blankets 
too. No one has the homemade carpet 
now. They bought carpet with flowers 
and didn't want to use the homemade 
carpet. They used it to cover the 
tobacco or potatoes. 
Cooking. Alma did the cooking because 
her grandmother was older. She did 
the cooking, ironing, washing, and 
worked in the field. She tried to

embroider or crochet inbetween chores. 
They cooked green beans, cabbage, and 
sweet potatoes. They had an evaporator 
to make molasses for the neighbors. 
They raised bees. They didn’t have to 
buy too much. They made their own 
soap, and vinegar. They cooked 
chicken and dumplings, chicken pie, 
pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, apple 
pie. They had a peach orchard and 
canned in tin cans. They made a wooden 
barrel full of kraut. They soldered 
the lid to the can and boiled them in 
a big boiler. They dried peaches, 
apples. She usually dries and gives 
the children dried fruit. She had 
canned and frozen a lot this year— 
corn, peas, and meat. Leather 
Britches they would cure on the floor 
of the tobacco barn after the tobacco 
leaf was cured. If you didn't wait 
until the tobacco was cured, it would 
make you sick. They put the beans on 
dryers on the floor of the tobacco 
barn. She didn't dry her's on the 
string very much. They canned beets, 
cucumbers, apples, pears, blackberries. 
People can because they would rather 
have their own food and it's cheaper 
too. She never thinks about buying 
canned foods. She buys molasses and 
honey every once in awhile. She buys 
sugar.

Quilting. She prefers to sew or lace 
her quilts into the frame. Putting 
the quilt in is not any harder than 
the quilting. 
Learned how to make baskets by looking 
at one her grandmother had made. She 
gathered willows, boiled and peeled 
them, and kept them in water. The 
first one she made, she didn't know 
how to make it come up. She had to 
learn by looking at the basket; she 
never had anyone to help her. Her 
grandmother told her how she fixed 
the reed. 
First basket made in 1916 when she was 
20 or 21. She saw the willows and 
wanted to try a basket. She just kept 
trying. She worked and learned as she 
went along. Sometimes she makes the 
scalloped tops and sometimes she makes 
them smooth. 
She kept using the willow until she found 
out she could order the reed. She 
started making them out of the reed 
because they're so much longer and 
make nicer, smoother work. She 
hasn't made a willow basket in years. 
She makes them out of honeysuckle vine. 
She pulls up the runners, boils them, 
and pee]S them; they make nice baskets. 
She made some out of bullrush too, but 
she had to put a lot of shellac on 
it to make it substantial. She used 
bamboo briar once to make a basket; 
she did that just to see if she could.

She also made one out of shucks. She 
made rugs out of shucks too; she 
braided them. Her grandmother made 
the braided rugs out of shucks. She 
never did see her grandmother make a 
basket or prepare the materials. 
She keeps the materials in water so they 
won't break. They boil(j|r the willows 
in the wash pot, peel the bark off, and 
keep them in water until you use them. 
She do^h't boil any now. If she boils 
some now, she just does a few in a 
kettle on the stove. You just boil 
them a few minutes. You gather the 
honeysuckle vines in February before 
the sap rises. You can let it dry and 
boil it later if you want to. 
Pine needles. Started using them 20 or 
25 years ago. She saw someone who 
had a pine needle basket and she just 
took it up. She tried it. She feeds 
the pine needles through the copper 
tube. 
Preparing the pine needles. The pine 
needles have a little end that needs 
to be pulled off. She soaks them in 
water and her son pulls off the ends. 
She keeps them covered with a towel to 
keep them moist. They have been in 
water, but a we^* towel keeps them moist. 
Gathers the pine needles in September. 
Her son has four pine trees, and she 
gets pine needles from him. A relative 
gives her some; she gives her a basket 
for them. She gets some from down in 
the Sand Hills in Lee County and Moore 
County. Her neices bring them to her. 
She gets tired of working and comes in 
the house and picks up her pine needles. 
She'd rather work on baskets than to 
read. 
She makes baskets for the flower arrange¬ 
ments too. Interruption. She makes 
string bonnets, quilts, and crochets 
rugs too. She doesn't know how many 
she makes per year. 
She makes the baskets mostly out of pine 
needles and reed. It is Hong Kong reed 
she orders from Ohio. She never made 
a split oak basket. She bought some 
similar to what she uses to bottom 
chairs; she hasn't made many out of 
that however. Reed and pine needle is 
what she uses mostly. She can't get 
out and get the honeysuckle now; they 
tore up her honeysuckle patch. She 
couldri^t order tne reed far awhile.

Then.she found another place she could 
buy it for $3 a pound. She primarily 
uses pine needles now. 
She.prefers pine needles because she can 
sit down and work on it. She has to 
stand for the reed; she puts it on a 
stool when she works the bottom. She 
gets tired when she is on her feet 
so long. 
She makes small baskets now. She doesn't 
try to make big baskets; she almost 
made herself sick making the one up¬ 
stairs. Not many people want a large 
one like that. 
She made the big basket 15 or 20 years 
ago. She just made up the pattern. 
A preacher Double Creek wanted a 
basket for the communion trays. He 
said it was too large and he would 
auction it off. She decided to keep 
it herself. She made it for a church 
in the mountains, and she was going to 
give the money to her church. She 
thought if they can't use it, she’ll 
keep it. It is a reed basket she 
ordered; it has several dollars worth 
of reed in it. It would make a nice 
clothes basket. 
She makes primarily a little round 
basket now. Big reed basket. The 
one her grandmother made was probably 
made in the 1890's. She doesn't 
remember what her grandmother used her's 
for. She made the bigger one in 1918. 
Her grandmother had one she kept her 
yarn in and knitting needles. She 
wanted one to put quilt scraps and 
yarn in. "It was more to look at than 
to use." 
Cylinder shaped basket. "I just made it 
to be making a basket." Lyntha 
arrives. 
Her baskets sell well at Rooftop. She 
has been making them for Mrs/Berry 
for 8 years. A friend told Mis. Berry 
about her. 
The process. Get the pine needles. 
Get the ends laying the same way, and 
then soak them. Get the end off, and 
put them in water and get them soft 
before you go to working on them. Get 
your thread and needle and "keep a 
sewing and a-going." 
Thread. She uses Chatham's thread. It 
is real strong. At first she tried 
to use rafia grass, but it.breaks so 
bad and wears out. The twine lasts.

Making a basket. Sewing the strands 
together. She uses a thimble. She 
tries to put the needle in under 
the previous thread. She adds a 
pine needle every so often. 
The copper device is a piece of copper 
tubing. This gives her the same 
thickness. 
She is making a mat. She makes three 
sizes--l8 rounds, 16 and 14 rounds. 
Starting the mat. She starts with 
about three pine needles, folds them 
over, and ties them. 
Making the base on the baskets. She 
sews an extra piece on the bottom. 
Making the lids. She keeps cupping 
it to fit the basket. Putting on 
the pine burr. She made it up. 
Adding in a stitch as she sews the 
mat. She likes to sew them close 
together because the pine ends don't 
stick out. 
Making a reed basket. She starts with 
three or four reeds across. She adds 
in four more and puts in an extra. 
She always has to have an odd number 
of reeds. She adds reed to make the 
fancy top too. 
Making the bottom of the basket. She 
uses the top reeds to make the bottom 
stand. 
She has to stand to weave a reed basket. 
The reeds are long and she needs a 
flat surfact to make the bottoms.

She can sit down when she weaves a pine 
needle "basket. 
The willow reeds she gathered herself. 
She boiled and peeled them. 
The lamp basket. She saw a lamp like 
it in a book. She wove the lamp base 
over a gourd with sand in it. She 
gets some of her ideas from books. 
One of her pine needle baskets is like 
an Indian basket she saw in a book. 
She gets some of her ideas from vases 
and pottery. She takes her imagination 
and pine needles and works them all 
together. 
Chicken basket. Mrs. Berry showed her 
a smaller chicken basket that she 
copied. 
Sewing the baskets together with rafia 
grass. The earlier baskets don’t hold 
up as well. Now she uses twine to 
sew them together. The twine is strong. 
Repairing baskets. She may try to 
re-work the magazine rack that is torn. 
Magazine rack. She copied a reed basket 
she had made. She saw a picture in 
a magazine with someone carrying a 
basket like this. It was made in the 
1950’s. 
Handbag basket was made in the 1960's. 
She saw a basket with the intertwined 
lid. 
She shellacs the pine needle baskets. 
Basket with a bird on top. She made it 
for a sewing basket. It is a paper 
mache bird. She made in 10 or 12 years 
ago. 
She started making placemats when she 
started making baskets. She makes 
smaller ones too. There is a lot of 
work in a large placemat. You can’t 
make it in a day. She doesn't make 
a dollar an hour. 
Small pot with a pine cone cover. She 
made up the pattern. She can't make 
two baskets alike. 
Putting the bottom on after she gets the 
basket made. She cuts away the area 
where she is attaching the bottom. 
Then you can't tell where you added 
the bottom. 
Ending the basket. She tapers off the 
pine needles. It doesn't look exactly 
the same. 
A large base on a basket. She wanted to 
make them different. She has seen dishes

A large tray could be used to serve 
sandwiches on. 
She gets most of her ideas for baskets 
from books, seeing ether baskets; 
she makes some up. 
She hasn't changed her basketmaking 
style too much. She has started making 
the walnut trays a good deal lately. 
They sell real well. People can use 
them.

for the scissors. Part of them don't 
have to mark off the fan, only the 
first row. One quilter hasn't been 
quilting much lately. 
Discussing the meeting again. They had 
a visitor from the Galax area. Discusses 
her some. Asked us if we had anyone 
working in tobacco. Someone asked to 
take a woman's picture; she refused. 
Roxie asks us if we’ve taken a picture 
of the old mill. She asks us if this 
is the first quilting we’ve been too. 
"Now you have to hold your mouth just 7|T 
right to do this." Sometimes "you have 
to sleep with a sheet next to the quilt 
to keep from getting your toenails 
hung up in the stitches." 
Tacked quilts. "I don't like a tacked, 
period." The Hinsons and Roxie do 
most of the quilting; Bertha has not 
been well. Roxie busted her tail bone. 
If you all are married, "you've got a

Roxie tells it. Ilene tells another 
story about her granddaughter. 
The quilting thread is not very good. 
Ilene's hands are sweating. Roxie 
wants the quilt fixed right. "Just 
be yourselves." The needle gets too 
damp it won't pull through the fabric. 
Put some more leather britches up in the 
attic. She's going to fix some green 
beans for supper and gave some to her

a recipe in the Sunday paper. That 
was a delicious cake made out of self¬ 
rising flour. "Do you put baking 
powder in your pound cake." Bertha 
never does;the egg whites will make it 
rise. I didn't know you could make a 
cake without it.

Lyntha's leaving. The quilters are 
talking about leaving. They discuss 
how far it is to Galax. We are all 
staying at the same motel. 
They continue to talk about going home. 
They waited to put the quilt in until 
we got there. Roxie doesn't have 
any small thimbles. 
She has herself in a corner, and she can't 
get out. They discuss Puddles, Roxie's 
dog. One quilter leaves. 
Roxie has to go Jo school tomorrow to 
finish sewing her dress. Roxie had to 
carry a patient to Winston twice last 
week. She has some reports to fill 
out. 
Discuss the cooking for the Homemaker's 
Club. She can carry some dried beans; 
she puts peanut butter in them. Dried 
bean soup. She makes pinto beans with 
a teaspoon of peanut butter in them. 
Bertha puts some meat and corn oil in 
her green beans to give them some flavor. 
Sweet potato crunch. Do I like the pattern 
of the quilt; Roxie likes it. There 
are only a few pieces in the quilt alike.

Roxie tells a story. "That's a long 
time to live with one old hag." 
"How in the hell have you ever stood 
to live with my Daddy, as long as you 
have." She says, 'Your Daddy stays 
downtown, and I stay at home." The 
word, hell, needs to be said more 
often. If it was preached on a little 
bit more, maybe there wouldn't be so 
many folks going there. There is only 
one person the Bible says has been to 
Hell and returned. Mrs. Cooley's 
joke. The cat returns; it follows 
Roxie wherever she goes. Roxie put 
her food away; they ate up her baked 
apples. 
Bertha tells Mrs. Cooley's joke. Grand- 
daughter, mother, and grandmother went 
to New York. They needed some money 
and decided to stand on a streetcorner. 
The granddaughter, daughter didn't 
earn much. The grandmother said, 
not much; "how much is forty quarters." 
Mrs. Cooley told the joke on a bus 
tour. It's not a bad joke. 
Kelly may work all day. Roxie says it 
is getting "too." Bertha sings "Aunt 
Dinah's Quilting Party." She cleaned 
and decorated her house. Ileene's 
sister is working at T G and Y. Bertha 
saves everything anyone gives her. 
Roxie wants to know how she'll heat 
her new room. She has an iron heater. 
She wants the sun to shine in the room, 
and she wants to keep the tree in the 
yard. The big oak is perfect for a 
swing for the grandchildren. That may 
be the largest oak tree in Surry 
County. 
Roxie asks me how many weeks we have 
left. They'll have other projects in 
other parts of the country. 
Quilting is hard on the fingers. It 
is prettier in fans and easier. 
The men in the project work with men. 
Discussion of County Extension Agent. 
The other women can tell me how they 
grew up. What do we want? "Nothing 
happened to me but hard work." vj. 
Courtship days. Granny went with four 
boys. How Bertha met Fletcher. They 
went to a singing at a furniture 
factory. They went Chickapin hunting. 
What do we want on the tape.

"That's what women usually do when theyv^ 
have a quilting." They either gossip" 
about somebody, reminisce about their 
past, or tell jokes. Roxie tells how 
she met Kelly. They went to Church 
that night. 
Bertha caught her second husband with 
ice cream. She tells the story of 
how she met her husband in a 
drug store. "He kept trying to run me 
down until he finally caught me." 
How Cranny Kate met her husband. Roxie 
would like to know how the rest of 
them met their husbands. Bertha tells 
of someone who urged Pearl to "Beat 
her time"; that's fun, the woman said.

Roxie asks Bertha if she bought some 
fabric. Roxie is looking for the 
wax. Roxie hasn't made her dress yet 
either. She is drying fruit. 
Dried apples don't need to be frozen. 
They can just be put in a bag and 
stored. She fixed some for some ladies 
who wouldn't pay her $1.75 a pound. 
If they knew how long it took to do 
it, they wouldn't object. Drying 
apples. 
The gardens are almost done. Peas need 
to be picked. They are going to can 
the late sweet corn. You got enough 
children, consume everything that you 
grow. 
Someone wants a cold drink. 
Bertha's husband likes to talk. The 
men enjoyed going to the Homemaker's 
meeting. Harley hardly ever goes any¬ 
place without her. A woman had to 
drive the firetruck to a funeral 
yesterday. 
A woman is talking about quiting the club. 
Her husband is nervous. Bertha never 
takes pills.. Kelly doesn’t like 
crowds. Roxie doesn’t mind washing 
the dishes. Bertha's husband washes 
the dishes for her. The men don't 
wash the dishes correctly. 
It is difficult to find someone to 
clean the windows and do the bigger 
jobs. Roxie's windows are dirty 
because she lives on a dirt road.

The dog is going to stay where she is 
happy at on the front porch. She 
got the dog a new box for the front 
porch. Anyone who keeps a dog in the 
house, it's nasty. Cats and dogs live 
outside. Roxie keeps her beds and her 
body clean. She has hobbies she'd 
rather do than mop all the time. 
She put down linoleum because she was 
allergic to carpet. The dust stays 
in the carpet. The fiber of the carpet 
smells like fish. 
Roxie asks if we have done any work in 
Mount Airy. Fern Evans is a good 
girl. Her daughter was Miss Mount 
Airy. She has been a sick woman. She 
has a kidney problem. They discussed 
the times she has provided the enter¬ 
tainment. Fern is a remarkable person 
to Roxie. 
Roxie tells a story about the man who 
asked her to teach knitting class. 
She said she couldn't do it. He 
told her that everyone had a talent. 
They were looking for someone to make 
gunstocks. They have a lot of people 
in that college who already have the 
knowhow. 
Cross-stitching is the newest fad. She 
still likes her quilts. She would 
rather have a quilt and a blanket on 
her bed. 
Granny's schooldays were her happiest. .\l> 
Courting days were pretty good too. A*’ 
Post Office. Smile and Go for it. 
Pass the Thimble. King and Queen. 
Story about Hugh Harmon playing the 
game. Pretty, Pretty Mock Up. How 
to play Post Cffice. Discussion of 
the quilt and how the fan should be 
drawn in. Looking for the chalk tied 
to a string. 
Roxie misses her long-line bra. She wants 
to know where to find the extra pieces 
to widen the bra. 
Post Cffice. Story about some girls 
who tricked a boy. She made him sit jr 
on a hot skillet. He had aggravated 
the girls too much. 
Teenagers today. If the old folks told 
some of the things they’ve done, the 
teenagers would be surprised. Bertha ^ 
tells a story about what her father 
did as a boy. They piled some black¬ 
berry briars in front of a man’s door. 
One man jumped in the briar with his

devilish and mean. There are so many 
of them now, and they have a way of 
getting away. Dope. Story from 
the newspapers about a man who 
committed suicide in a local motel. 
Worried about me driving on the high¬ 
way by myself. A lot of the stuff 
they did as children, they didn't 
know the consequences. Their parents 
didn't tell them a lot. 
Church and Box Suppers. Bertha is 
looking for her husband. They are

Looking at thimbles and leadership record 
Lady of the Year. Everybody should get 
it. Bertha has made a cake for every¬ 
body who had a birthday. Many members 
have won the award. 
Where the man was buried. 
Quilting the fan. Roxie pieced the 
quilt by hand. Bertha made three 
Trips around the World by her fingers. 
They don’t look as pretty on the 
machine; it flattens them out. This 
quilt is all cotton. You can't sell 
a polyester quilt. Polyester slacks 
are nice in the winter, but hot in 
the summer. Seersucker is nice in the 
summer. 
Looking for the thread. Bertha has all 
the thread. Bertha hurst so she can’t 
do her work well. She wants to do some 
embroidery thread. She is making some 
macrame too; she took a class so her 
daughter wouldn't have to go alone. 
She was tired last week from crocheting. 
She couldn’t learn anything and was 
ashamed of herself. She may be the 
same way tonight. They’ll have to go. 
Granny is trying to finish a fan. Roxie 
can't quilt left-handed. She is going 
to finish this herself. She can call 
them on a cooler day or a rainy day. 
They just started this one for us. 
Mr. Hanes asks about gossip. Roxie 
asks for a relative to hear the tape.

They sort out the thimbles. Roxie is 
waiting to roll the quilt. Will the 
dog be okay. 
Roxie is alone. This is a Friendship 
Quilt made from materials given to 
her by friends. There wouldn't be a 
piece in it alike. She likes this 
pattern. 
This pattern can be started in the middle 
like the Trip Around the World. She 
staggered hers hit and miss. She 
couldn't use up all her pieces the 
other way. Granny Hinson returns for 
her food. 
Friendship Quilt. It is 2j yards long. 
She bought the fabric for the backing. 
They used to make them out of feed 
sacks. They would dye the linings. 
They used scraps for the quilts, 
especially where there was a big 
bunch of kids to sew for. They used 
cotton checks for shirts and sheets. 
The cat. They had a blanket to keep 
from sleeping next to the quilt. They 
didn't want to wear the lining out. 
They never did wash a quilt. She washes 
hers now. It is not as cold as it used 
to be with modern heating devices. Quilts 
were used to keep warm. 
Quilts were made out of scraps. The 
filler was cotton, or an old blanket, 
or old clothes. Roxie's mother would 
never let her roughhouse on her quilts. 
She used the coffeepaddle on them if 
they were caught on the bed. She 
protected her quilts. 
Patterns. They were pieced on the pages 
of a Sears, Roebuck catalog. They ^ 
filled them with raw cotton; later ” 
they got the seeds out. Roxie batted 
the cotton herself. The store bought 
cotton is hard. Home grown cotton is 
better. 
They tacked with thrums from the mill. 
They also used balls of twine they ^ 
dyed a suitable color. Eroomstraws, 
onion hulls were used to make the dye. 
Wool thread isn’t good to tack a quilt 
with. 
People used to trade their wool for 
blankets at Chatham's. They wove 
cloth and clothes on an old loom that 
Roxie used to have in her loft. There 
is a woman up the road who weaves 
coverlets. Roxie values the old 
page 3

coverlets. They tufted the counter¬ 
panes and made the fringe by tying 
yarn around a board. Someone now 
teaches the women how to tie fringe. 
Patches from the Sears, Roebuck catalog. 
They'd piece the square according to 
the page of the catalog with the first 
piece going diagonally across the page. 
Sometimes they put a block of solid 
with a block of pieced materials. 
If you had little scraps, you made 
little blocks. 
Demonstrating how to piece a block on 
the catalog page. The longest scrap 
was placed across the middle. They 
were sewed by hand. They'd turn it 
over and the seam wouldn’t show. 
They sewed it to the paper and tore 
the paper off afterwards. The solid 
blocks alternated with the pieced 
blocks. 
Strip quilts. Roxie has one quilt that 
has seven pieces in it all the way 
down. Solid alternates with prints 
in the strips. 
Fancy quilts. Roxie has a pattern 
book. Flower Garden. Dresden Plate. 
Sunflower. The Wrench. She did the 
fancy patterns at home. Roxie had a 
shoe box full of them. Now she has 
a book. Road to Damascus. Road to 
California. Drunkard's Path.

Flowers on feed meal sacks or sugar

used them for quilts or bedspreads. 
Tried to make the quilts dark and used 
dark outing for the linings. Gray 
outing. ^ 
They were dark so people wouldn't have ^ 
to wash them so much. The quilts were 
washed by hand. Story about using the 
backing from a sander for strip quilts. 
She soaked the sandbelt in water, bleach 
them and dye them to use in quilts. 
She tacked her quilts. Story about 
the lightning striking her house; it 
burned the quilts in the bed quilt pack. 
Her mother-had to make more quilts 
to keep warm; it took her almost a 
whole winter. They had three beds with 
from 5 to 7 quilts on a bed. It was 
cold, and it stayed cold. They wore 
homemade mittens and stockings. Roxie 
remembers her black long stockings. 
They lasted all winter. She was lucky 
to be in a family with only one girl. 
Lone Star quilt. Roxie's favorite quilt. 
How she pieces it. She is describing the 
Eight-pointed Star. You can piece them 
on cloth or on PaP^r She ^pieced it 
in blocks and put aj^iaff1 inch strip 
between each block. It's beautiful.

There is a star in every block. A 
standard size has 20 blocks; 4 across 
and 5 long. She has used solid colors 
but you can piece it on paper. Every 
piece in the star was a different 
color, but the corners were one color. 
Pansy Bed or Flower Garden. It’s 
however you want to put it together 
that makes the pattern. Trip Around 
the World. She likes the Friendship 
Pattern. 
Quilting in the Fan. It was too narrow 
to quilt in the piece. The fan quilting 
sells better because it is "the old 
time way." They sometimes lay them off 
with chalk in the diagonals about two 
inches apart. The fancy patterns you 
buy. The Bear's Paw. The quilt was 
quilted on each side of the seam. It 
was stiff because it had so much quilting 
on it. Roxie likes a fluffy quilt. 
A friend visited the Trading Post and 
Brinegar's Cabin; the quilts were $600 
and were not constructed good. 
Fan quilting sells better. Pieced fan 
quilt. She had the patterns as a kid; 
then, it was a lost art. Now it’s one 
of the biggest things they've got. 
Quilts became popular a year or two 
ago. Around the World out of polyester 
is used as bedspreads. Cne sold for 
$400. A perfect Cathedral Window quilt 
only sold for $125- Thirty-five yards 
of domestic goes into a Cathedral quilt. 
She made king size. The quilts are up 
in Washington; it takes her a year to 
do them. Roxie couldn’t do that. 
She likes the Friendship; you'll find 
fancier ones up on the mountain. She 
doesn't like the polyester quilt. 
Changes. Some are quilted by the piece. 
Some quilt in circles or diamonds. The 
cotton must be quilted close or it will 
ball up. Those with Chatham blankets 
in them will not ball up. The quilts 
are better if the stitches are longer. 
It's hard to get good cotton. The 
polyester and cotton costs $5. The cloth 
costs $1.49 a yard. It's hard to make 
money selling a quilt. This Friendship 
Quilt is already sold. 
Beeswax. It keeps the thread from fuzzing 
up. This is good thread from the 
Tanner place. She is sewing a dress 
with the same thread. This is polyester 
thread; she also uses cotton thread. 
page 3 
&T- ft 7 5 
She has thread she likes at the house. 
They used this thread to hem two quilts 
while they waited for us. They are 
making quilts and lap rugs for charity. 
One woman made 39 taby blankets. They 
are zig-zag stitching the Chatham 
blankets for the nursing homes. Few 
people will stick to the quilting. 
Bertha does a lot of handwork. The 
Hinsons and Roxie do most of the quilting. 
314 - 351 She quilts during the cool weather. In 
the summer, they're busy with the 
gardens. They take orders and quilt 
them for people. They did 17 last 
winter. Roxie has been selling them 
for 3 years. She gave her girls 6 
apiece. She gave her nieces and grand¬ 
daughters a quilt. 
351 - 40? She was asked to demonstrate quilting 
a few years ago, and didn’t sell a quilt. 
She stopped at a restaurant and sold 
them for $300. She also sold quilts 
in Sparta at a Church. Cne woman bought 
one pieced out of denim. Roxie didn't 
sell any camp quilts. She also sold 
some in Winston through a furniture 
store. They displayed it in the store. 
407 - 469 Fabrics for the tops of the quilts. 
She will not use polyester. She doesn't 
like it and it won’t sell. Showing 
me a quilt and quilt scraps. They 
won't take a polyester quilt at the 
Brinegar’s Cabin. She gets the scraps 
from things she has made; people give 
her scraps. She picks out all the 
polyester. She doesn't like too much 
red in the quilts. She makes Raggedy 
Anne dolls to sell at the Cabin.

Roxie will sell the quilt through 
Brinegar's Cabin. 
Filler. She uses cotton and polyester 
fillers. The filler is $4.49 for a 
quilt, but it's kind of wiry. It 
quilts good. A friend had this filler 
in her Post Office. Roxie showed her 
how to put them in the frame. They 
tied them to a chair with nylon 
stockings. The woman gave Roxie this 
cotton. Cotton to go in a quilt is 
less expensive, but cotton fabrics 
are expensive. 
She uses polyester and dacron for the 
backing. She sometimes tries to match 
the lining with the top. She some¬ 
times uses a polyester sheet. She 
would like to use a cotton lining, but 
it is hard to find. Polyester and 
cotton is perma-jrest. She used a 
figured lining because there was all 
colors in the top. The figured material 
had a white background in it. It would 
have been hard to choose a color from 
all those in the top. A red lining is 
not pretty on anything. She once made 
a red Drunkard's Path that she sold to 
a drunk man. She sells them as fast as 
she can get them made. 
Favorite pieced pattern is Friendship and 
Eight-pointed star. The Star is color¬ 
ful. There were eight colors in the 
star. Nine Square or Nine Diamonds. 
Story about selling the Nine Patch at 
the Senior Citizen Fair. It was quilted 
page 2 
G3-- 
in the fans. It sold for $50* It 
is an old time pattern, the same as 
the Nine Chariot Wheel woven on the 
looms. Roxie goes to get two quilts. 
Ill - 140 Applique patterns. Farmer Boy. Maple 
Leaf. Little Dutch Girl. She doesn't 
like one Dutch Girl pattern because 
it only has one foot. She likes one 
of the patterns turned under and 
embroidered on, not buttonhole stitched 
on. She knows they have two feet. 
Roxie doesn't like sewing machined 
quilts. Her neice zig-zagged the 
Dutch Girl onto a quilt. 
140 - 204 A quilt is pretty if the colors are ^Ji 
pretty. It should be done good. They^ 
must be neat and colorful. This quilt 
can be used as a quilt top or spread. 
This top would match any color curtain. 
Roxie likes a colorful quilt. The 
quilting and piecing must be neat. 
The corners must match. She tells a 
story about a log cabin quilt in which 
the logs and window did not match. 
Roxie has ordered the true log cabin. 
The cloth must be cut all the right way. 
None of the pieces should be cut on 
the bias. All the patterns must run 
one way on the cloth, just as if you 
were making a dress. Every piece of 
this quilt is hand sewn. Granny forgot 
to fasten her thread. 
204 - 308 Stitches should not be too small. They 
need to be long enough so they won't 
pull through. They should be straight 
and not back-stitched. Roxie doesn't 
like the backstitching. She has just 
learned these things herself, not 
from a book. She learned some things 
at school. She got her patterns when 
she was young from the Elkin Tribune 
or the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Some¬ 
times you could copy a pattern from 
them. Some people have a talent for 
sewing. They made their own lye soap. 
Her mother dripped down ashes and made 
ash lye soap. She is going to sell 
the soap at the Cabin. Grace had some 
soap that melted. She uses the soap 
to get spots out of her clothing. 
It took three of them to hang a big 
quilt on the line after it had been 
washed. It would freeze on the line 
sometimes. People used to fumigate 
after a sickness with sulfur. Children 
used to catch the Itch. Roxie tells 
a story about her brother who caught 
the Itch after he was married at his 
page 3 
G T- (2-1 ^ 
in-law's home. Her mother made a straw 
tick and covered it with burlap sacks. 
They had to grease with sulfur and lard. 
They still have it in schools now. Head 
lice. 
308 - 329 
In the spring they would wash the quilts 
They boiled them and rinsed them out. 
They could dip them in the deep water 
of the mill pond. They would hang them 
on the line. It was a problem to get 
them washed. They washed them in 
the spring and scrub the floor. They 
scrubbed the floor with lye soap and 
put white dirt on the floor. That 
kept the grease from getting on it. 
They had it made when they were kids 
growing up. 
329 - 353 
Washing the quilts. They built the fire 
under the wash pot and boiled them. 
Then they took them to the creek to 
rinse them and finally hung them on the 
line. Her father had 5 to 7 quilts on 
the bed. Her father kept a fire in 
the house. They had somebody to take 
care of them. 
353 - 380 
Quilting changes. Modern frames. You can 
order them from Sears, Roebuck. She 
would rather have the old frames. The 
cat. They used to make soap, dig roots, 
and beat off sassafrass bark. They 
got 500 a pound for them. They 
picked blackberries. They bought 
white sheeting to dye for quilt linings, 
lilting changes. Her frame is the same. 
The modern frames sit up on legs; they 
don't work as good. People did them 
neater than they do now. They pay 
$15 to quilt a quilt. People now 
don't quilt. The patterns are the 
same. Roxie didn't quilt again until 
it became popular. She gave the 
money to the club. Now the three of 
them who quilt keep the money. She 
sells used clothes for the club. She 
went to visit the Crossnor School. It 
started in the mountains by selling old 
clothes. They dye their own yarns. 
They weave at the school.

Outline 
3 - 28 Background. She was born in the last 
month of the year. Her mother died 
when she was six. She lived with her 
grandmother; married at 16. She has 
a boy and a girl. One granddaughter 
is in college. Born near Elkhorn in 
Carroll County. Her mother died in 
1920. They moved in with grandmother's 
and moved from place to place where 
ever work needed to be done. 
28-40 Tasks. Dried apples, beans, pumpkin. 
Planted corn and beans. They shelled 
beans. They pulled and thrashed 
some beans. They had a mill they 
turned with a crank to clean the 
dirt out of the beans. 
40 - 103 Drying beans. They had a dry kiln. 
They had just enough fire to dry them 
slow. Snap beans they would dry on a 
string outside or behind the stove. 
She has some outside now; they will 
dry in four or five days, then she'll 
put them in the oven and heat them to 
kill the bugs' eggs. She loves leather 
britches. Story about "leather jackets. 
Her husband and children don't like 
them. Most older people like them. 
You have to chew them. The whole 
family likes dried apple pies. When 
she had a wood stove, she put them in 
the oven. Now she just dries them in 
the sunshine. She just slices them 
and puts them on a cloth. Some people 
have a frame fixed for them. Some 
people put them in the car. She puts 
6T-R7'/ 
page 2 
hers on the metal roof of the cellar. 
When its hot, the roof gets plenty 
hot. You can slice the apples any 
way; sometimes she gust quarters 
them, although it takes them longer 
to dry that way. Her grandmother 
liked them better that way. Everyone 
likes the fried pies with dried apples. 
Some call them moon pies. Fried pies 
and moon pies are the same thing. 
When you buy them, they are called 
moon pies. She^preferred them to 
any kind of pie when she was a kid. 
Mazie loves to cook. She is not a 
fancy cook. 
103 - 170 Baking fried pies. She makes biscuit 
dough. She fries them in bacon 
grease, oil, or butter. She soaks 
the leather britches overnight and 
cooks them a good long while. Cook 
them like pinto beans; put bacon or 
ham in it. She cooks them all day 
on a wood stove while she's weaving 
rugs or working in the basement. 
Some people say they're never done, 
even if you cook them a week, but 
they are done. You used to string 
them with a needle and string them 
by the stove or on theporch. It 
takes them 4 or 5 days to dry if 
its hot weather. If its damp, it 
may take 2 or 3 weeks for them to 
dry. Pumpkin is sliced up and 
dried like the beans; run a needle 
through it and letting it dry. Long 
ago people didn't have cans to preserve 
food in. If there's a big family you 
had to have a lot of food put away. 
It took a lot of food for her grand¬ 
mother's family. Today you couldn't 
feed a family that large; people 
don't raise and preserve as much food. 
They all have some kind of public 
gob. The children didn't have time 
to play; they had to help with the 
family chores. 
170 - 260 Canning. Canning beans was an all day 
gob. They had a barrel cut in two, 
and boiled the cans in the barrel. 
They had 18 to 20 cans that had to 
boil for 6 hours outside. They did 
a whole lot of them at one time; 
it was a day's gob. They didn't buy 
page 3 
260 - 316

much, at the store. They had their 
own cane patch for molasses. They 
grew apples, sweet potatoes. They 
put away apples in boxes underneath 
the house. Some they buried down in 
the ground. They made kraut. She 
loved to eat the kraut gust as it 
was. Her grandmother put the stalk 
in the kraut barrel. Today not many 
people make kraut in the barrel. She 
makes her's in the gars. She has 
a recipe she follows from the Agriculture 
Dept. Her grandmother didn't measure; 
she made it by taste. Mazie tries to 
follow directions. Pickle Beans. 
Cucumber pickles. They made apple 
butter in the molasses boiler when 
they were done with molasses. They 
didn't have to can it up. She put 
it in crocks. She made sweet apple 
preserves from a special apple tree. 
They had them in big gars to eat on 
on all winter. They had a bowl of 
apple preserves and molasses on the 
table all the time. Buckwheat flour 
doesn't Imake pancakes like it used 
to. They made theirs the night before. 
She didn't like hominy, so she has 
never made it. 
Pickle beans. She makes her's in gars; 
her grandmother made her's in crocks 
and barrels. They had a spring house 
for the kraut and beans. Her grand¬ 
mother canned rhubard in half gallon 
gars. She cut and filled the gars 
with rhubard and spring water. She 
left it in the spring house, and it 
didn't spoil. They put her flowers 
in the ground for the winter and 
covered them with a board. They 
wouldn't freeze during the winter. 
They had it up on a hill so the water 
wouldn't get in it. They buried 
potatoes, turnips, cabbage like that. 
They turned the row in the cabbage 
patch with the roots turned up. When 
they wanted a cabbage, they'd go to 
the garden to get one. 
Canning by the signs. You can't make 
pickles or kraut when the sign is in 
the bowels. Pointers should be up 
for pickles and kraut. If the sign 
is in the bowels, the food will rot. 
Planting signs. The sign in the breast 
is a good time to plant everything. 
Parsnips, beets needed sign in the 
page 4

339 - 394

thiglis. Mazie likes to go by the 
signs when she can. She likes to 
plant by the sign of the breast. 
Cures. They picked and dried catnip 
and pinerile. Babies had to have 
catnip for colds. They ground ivy. 
Eatsvain for kidney trouble. They 
used Virginia Creeper for kidney 
trouble and Gravel Weed. They drank 
a tea of Gravel Weed for kidney stones. 
She has used some of these cures. 
Yellow Root was good for sores in the 
mouth. Eowl Root was good for a cow 
that was sick. They used this yearS 
ago, but not now. He used to split 
the cow's tail when they had hollow 
tail. 
Cures she has used. She used Gravel 
Weed tea. Rats Vein. Penerail, they 
liked to smoke in a corncob pipe. 
They grew five rows of popcorn. They 
ate it in the evening and strung it 
on their tree. Her grandchildren made 
her an old fashioned tree a while ago. 
Story about breaking her leg; her 
grandmother re-broke it and set it 
right. Her grandmother tied her 
uncle's toes back after he chopped 
them off. They put a brown paper bag 
soaked in vinegar to take the swelling 
out of the broken arms.

The old man's getting a rest while 
you can't talk, told to her by her 
doctor. She was married at 18. She 
knew her husband when she was young. 
Story about how they met at a church 
meeting. They went together for a 
couple years. 
Wedding. They went to Hillsville to get 
a license; went to the preacher's and 
got married. They moved in with his 
father; this is the old homeplace. 
The old house sat in front of it. 
Story about how difficult it was to 
live in the old house. The new house 
with the furnace was a blessing. The 
wind blew through the house because 
the old houses were so poorly built. 
Snow would be 6 inches deep inside the 
house. Had to get it out before the 
house warmed up and the snow lie 1 ted. 
It was an L shaped house, with 8 rooms. 
They were sick the first winter in the 
new house. The house is wonderful 
because they don't have to go out and 
get wood. One winter it was so icy 
they couldn't get the cow and horse 
out of the barn. For weeks last year 
it was terribly icy. 
62 - 98 Winter of i960. They had more snow then. 
They had a fence around the old house; 
story about the station wagon parked 
near their fence. It was left over 
night, and the snow buried it. Most 
people were prepared for that snow.

One lady said she didn't need the 
food, hut needed cow feed. She 
lived across the parkway on the 
mountain. Most of the folks were 
prepared because the snow fell every 
Wednesday each week through February; 
they got 10 to 18 inches of snow. 
Depression. She was married in 1952. 
People grew what they needed; they 
didn't go to the store much. Things 
didn't cost much at the store. They 
carried Double L sheeting to make a 
sheet. No one around here suffered. 
No one made much money. Everybody 
survived. No one should get everything 
they want anyway. Kids used to have 
to work for what they got. Story 
about her cousin who asked why she 
worked her kids so hard. Her son is 
a good cook; he can cook as well as 
the girls. Story about Bobby buying 
the ingredients for a cake. The 
storekeeper didn't believe he was 
baking a cake. Boys should learn how 
to cook; some times there may be sick 
ness in a home and they'll need to 
know how to cook. Neighbors used to 
help one another, but they don't do that 
now. They are busy. 
Her son could crochet rugs. He could 
embroider. He liked to bake cakes 
and pies. He didn't care to fix 
bread or biscuits. He could fry 
potatoes and eggs and fix sandwiches. 
Parkway. It came through when her son 
was born. There was lots more traffic 
after the parkway. Before the Parkway 
came through, you didn't lock your 
doors. But today you have to lock 
your doors. They have had so many 
things carried off. Someone stole 
their fruit jars and crocks. She 
had a lot of half gallon fruit jars 
that someone stole from her smokehouse. 
A crock with flowers in it was stolen 
from her front porch. Now the roads 
are good and people get away with those 
things. They will answer for it later. 
Hard-surfaced road. This road is not 
part of the agreement with the Parkway. 
It was a gravel road from 1932; it 
was paved about five years ago. The 
agreements between people and the 
Parkway were not kept. People were 
promised a good road to haul their 
lumber and foodstuffs to market.

Now they're not allowed to use the 
Parkway for commercial transportation. 
Some people didn't want to give up 
their land. Many times it split a 
farm in two. It is mean to cross the 
Parkway with 30 head of cattle. There 
was a time when it was nothing to move 
cattle from one pasture to another. 
Now some people have to haul them with 
a truck. 
People are upset now. They are worried 
that they might not he able to leave 
their land to their children. Most 
folks want to leave what they have to 
their children. No one knows what 
the Parkway wants. They can't keep 
up the land they've got. Not many 
people want to be told what they can 
and can't do. We would be better off 
we didn't have a Parkway. We didn't 
have the strangers around, didn't 
have the stealing. They are off in 
another state before you can catch 
up with them. 
She found out about the Parkway business 
from general conversation. Someone 
came with a petition. She read a 
little in the newspapers about it. 
Quilting. She has done a lot of quilting 
She tacked some for other people. She 
pieced on the share. She pieced 21 
one winter. Story about her brother- 
in-law who said she had quilt pieces 
everywhere. She loves to sew. Now 
she is so nervous, she can't do that. 
She made a trip-around-the-world two 
years ago. She is having to hire the 
quilting done. She loves the quilting. 
Quilting by the share. They furnished 
the pieces and she did the work. She 
would get one half of them. They used 
them. She got 10 of the 21 and the 
other woman got 10. She did the 
piecing, and each woman quilted their 
own quilt. She had the material; and 
Mazie did the piecing and quilted her 
own quilts. A lady in town hired 
Mazie to do her quilting. She can't 
do that anymore. She made them 
for her family; she never made one 
to sell. She made them for a family 
that needed them. She gave away 6 
one winter. Her church did a lot of 
work for "someone in a hard place."

You never know, you might need the 
help yourself. 
Favorite piecing patterns. Only pieced 
one Crazy Quilt. That one almost 
made her crazy. She would rather 
put them in a pattern. She gets 
along better with a pattern. Her 
mother used to piece them. Her 
mother pieced a Log Cabin by the 
fingers. Mazie pieces her on the 
sewing machine. She loves to piece 
the Trip-Around-The World. They are 
all for the grandchildren. She used 
pieces of their clothing, so they 
call it a memory quilt. It brings 
back memories. One row in each quilt 
is made from the clothing of an aunt 
who is dead. They all have a memory 
of Aunt Irene. 
She still has a lot of quilt patterns. 
Her neighbor thought they were too 
complicated. They used tiny pieces 
that no one saves today. She doesn't 
know the names of them. 
They quilted in the fan, unless it was 
something special. The trip around 
the world they quilted by the piece. 
They have pieced them all the way 
straight across. She likes the fan 
because it shows up. If you have 
good padding, it shows up in circles 
nice. 
Used to pad with wool and cotton. Today 
people use a lot of synthetic fabric. 
One has a foam rubber inside it.

Rugmaking 
Index # 
Outline 
1 - 30 She began weaving rugs through a gov't 
program. The neighbors kept the 
building after the government gave 
up the program. Her Uncle Charlie 
coaxed her into going down and 
learning how to weave. They moved 
the looms into another house. She 
borrowed a loom from a neighbor; it 
hadn't been threaded up since 1920. 
She started weaving rugs; later she 
bought the loom. She borrowed it in 
July and bought it for Christmas. 
She doesn't weave in the summer because 
there is so much outside work to do. 
During severe.winters, she weaves a 
lot. She wove 120 last winter. 
She was ill part of last winter. 
50 - 40 She learned how to weave from her Uncle 
Charlie who learned from his grand¬ 
mother. He used to help her. He 
liked to weave rugs himself. He wove 
a lot of placemats on small looms. 
He made belts. 
40 - 67 Her grandmother wove blankets, cloth. 
Story about a neighbor who didn't 
know what they were doing. The loom 
was used to v^eave clothing and cover¬ 
lets. Dresses lasted years and years. 
One red petticoat was made out of wool; 
she was so happy when she outgrew it. 
Her grandmother knit socks for the 
children; they didn't wear out, but 
were passed down to the next child. 
She still has her daddy's dress. 
Her grandchildren, had their photos 
taken in that dress. 
Weaving rugs is the same as weaving 
material. A neighbor works at 
Burlington Mills and says the process 
is the same. Her grandmother wove 
rugs out of old clothing. His mother 
had wall-to-wall carpeting that they 
used to cover potatoes and canned goods. 
Someone in the area had woven wall- 
to-wall carpet. Some were striped and 
some were hit and miss. There were 
some woven in small stripes. In 1976 
she wove some in red, white, and blue 
stripes. 
She weaves in the wintertime. She starts 
after hog-killing. Then she straightens 
up the house; she doesn't keep house 
in the simmer. After the gardening, 
you can clean the house and start 
weaving and crocheting. It would 
be in November when hog-killing occurs. 
So mid-November to April is when she 
weaves. 
If she can't sleep, she weaves at night. 
Sometimes she would weave in the early 
morning before she went to the barn 
and then she wove until bedtime at 
night. She will tie fringe and not 
make any noise at night. She works 
whenever she can and whenever she 
feels like it. She can cut strings 
without making any noise. It takes 
more time to do that than weave the 
the rug. She weaves two colors at 
a time; she calls them streaked rugs. 
When you have a lot of little strings, 
you can get rid of them. 
Her family teases her about her weaving. 
They call it Granny's Weaving Factory. 
She has to do something with her 
hands while she sits down. She likes 
to weave and crochet as a pastime. 
She does sell some, and it helps. The 
warp is expensive. It is more expen¬ 
sive to weave. "I was born poor, and 
I'm going to leave it the same way." 
She would like to leave the world 
looking better than when she came 
here. That's why she plants a lot 
of flowers too. She wants to make 
the world a better place. 
The family all wants her rugs. Her 
granddaughter and friends liked the 
rugs, so she shared with all of them.

G^r- 
The craft shop sells her rugs. She 
sells some at home. Some months 
they don't sell any at the shop, 
some months they sell six or so. 
She gives them away as gifts. She 
gives them as wedding gifts; they 
can sell the rug if they want to. 
No one ever brings in rags or material 
to make rugs. One person brought 
in a batch of material, but it was 
too coarse and the pieces were too 
short. 
She uses her rugs on the chairs and 
underneath the chairs. She has 
the first rug she ever made. She 
will make a special rug if she can 
get that material. When you get 
strings, you have no choice in color. 
She buys her fabrics at the shirt 
factory—Bluemont, Penry's, and 
Hanes. 
Her rugs cost §2 a foot. They didn't 
cost that much until the warp went 
up in cost. The income helps a lot. 
She can sell enough to pay the light 
bill or the phone bill. She has the 
phone in the basement because of 
the rugs she has sold. It has been 
handy to have the phone in the base¬ 
ment. 
She doesn't make rugs for people who 
bring in their own rags. She never 
made carpet. She made some 12 or 14 
foot long rugs. She calls them rugs. 
She has a 6 or 7 foot long rug in 
her living room. She has some long 
ones now. Most people want them 4 
feet long. 
You have to thread the loom to begin; 
she puts 17 dozen and 2 strings to 
thread the loom. She weaves in some 
warp to keep it from raveling out. 
She takes 12 hours to thread her 
loom. She can weave a rug in 2 hours. 
She plans the colors. As a general 
rule she weaves out of whatever color 
is handy. She may weave 2 or 3 rugs 
alike. Gold, red, green, yellow, 
brown are hard to get. You get some 
colors that don't sell. Blue doesn't sell 
well. Green, red, orchid, yellow are 
her favorite colors. 
Her rugs are 2 feet wide, or 26 inches 
wide. They are as long as you want, 
them. She tries to use up her fabrics.

Hit and miss are hard to make. She 
can't make the colors match. 
She is not particular about combining 
colors. She has some striped strings 
that made beautiful rugs. Her cousin 
bought her a book on weaving that 
she doesn't use. 
She never uses borders in her rugs. 
She makes hit and miss rugs. It is 
slower and she is afraid her colors 
won't blend. They are more work. 
She likes long strings that fill the 
shuttle full. 
She makes quite a few striped rugs. 
She thinks striped rugs are pretty. 
She streaked some for a cousin that 
wanted some striped ones. In a 
streaked rug she runs 2 colors through 
at the same time. She had strings 
that were too little to make a rug. 
She tried putting two together and 
it worked out all right. She made 
a black and red streaked rug$ they 
sold right away. 
She makes a lot of solid rugs. If the 
strings are not striped, she makes 
a solid rug. She told the man who 
gets the strings for her that she 
wanted all the red he could get. 
She wants more red and black rugs. 
She has some striped material. It 
is mixed if the fabric is patterned. 
You have to have solid colors to make 
stripes. A solid rug would be made 
out of one solid color. Rugs made 
from patterned fabric are spotted 
rugs. 
Turkey Track Borders. She has never 
made a rug out of old fabrics. It is 
too much work and you want it to last 
a long time. She saw some made out of 
bread bags and one woman made some out 
of hoisery. It would be too slow to 
make them out of bread bags. Mazie 
prefers new fabrics. 
She prefers fabrics that are a blend 
with cotton in it. She has made 
some that are all nylon; they are 
too slippery. She would not 
necessarily prefer cotton.

2-26 She doesn't stitch her rags together. 
She cuts them the length they come 
from the shirt factory. She 'may 
cut them to be so many rounds on the 
shuttle. She usually just leaves 
them the length they come in; some¬ 
times they're 50 yards long. If the 
people at the factory knows she wants 
them, they leave them long. She prefers 
them long. She has to straighten them 
out$ she has to separate out the colors. 
She cuts them with a scissors. Some¬ 
times she cuts them thicker if the 
material is heavy. She has some she 
wove just as they come; they worked 
out okay, but some others she did were 
too heavy. If they're too heavy, they 
don't make good rugs. 
26 - 33 She doesn't stitch them together; she 
cuts the ends pointed and overlaps 
them. If you sew it, there would be 
a seam there. 
33 - 39 Her Uncle Charlie showed her how to 
prepare rags. He was particular about 
his rags. Each point had to be cut 
just the same and he had to pull it 
through just the same. 
39 - 56 She gets her rags from Bluemont or 
Penry's. She has someone who works 
there tell them to save the rags. It 
helps to have someone who works there. 
Then they will leave them long. Some¬ 
times she picks them up and sometimes 
someone else does. 
She pays 150 a pound for the rags. 
They come in a big burlap bag. 
She has to sort and separate them 
in the basement. She mops the 
floor before she starts cutting. 
She has the loom in the basement. 
She keeps her stove down there and 
does her canning down there. She 
separates the milk down there. She 
keeps her strings and shuttles down 
there. Sometimes a string will get 
loose and she puts a spool to keep 
that string as tight. 
She bought the loom from Ray Burcham; 
it belonged to his great -grandmother 
and the Paris sisters. It was used 
in 1920. She made two coverlets 
on the loom. She had wanted tolearn 
to weave while her grandmother was 
still alive. She could weave a yard 
a day. 
She learned to weave on a loom down at 
Coal Creek. She learned on one of 
three looms; one owned by Bill Patterson 
and two owned by Mrs. Berry. They 
had a pottery machine too. She liked 
Bill's loom the best; he gave it to 
his neice. Her loom is old and put 
together with pegs. 
She uses cotton warp from Oakdale Cotton 
Mills in Jamestown, N.C. She orders 
is; they don't have it in the stores 
here. It is supposed to be boilproof 
warp. She likes to use a blend of 
colors. She made some with shades of 
green and she saw some done in green 
and red. She does some in natural 
warp. She likes the warp in the same 
color. Natural warp is cheaper and 
makes yellow and gold look prettier. 
At Coal Creek, they used just what 
they got. Mrs. Berry used warp from 
Oakdale. They send it by overnight 
shipping^ she didn't like paying the 
charges. You never know what the 
shipping charges will be. Five dozen 
is her limit,for UPS. They used 
some nylon warp, but it was too 
awkward to use. Mazie made one rug 
on that. It tangled so easily. 
Cotton is easier to manage. 
Her Uncle Charlie showed her how to 
thread up the loom. She doesn't 
know where he got the pattern. The 
strings go through the loom all to¬ 
gether. You put on 14- with two in 
each beater; in the other one you put 
V7-.

in one and miss one. You have 14 
where you put two in and 12 where you 
put one in each one. 
Shuttles. Her Uncle Charlie and her son 
made her shuttles. She got shuttles 
with the loom, but they were for the 
fine thread and they don't work with 
the strings they use. You need a real 
think piece of wood to notch. The 
one her son made out of paneling worked 
well until it broke. 
Her son called the loom area her play¬ 
house. She said it was something to 
keep her from going insane. It has 
been a lifesaver for her. She calls 
the warp, warp. She calls the filler 
the strings. She cuts strings in the 
winter and her husband winds them up. 
She has quite a few ready for this 
winter. They work on it together, but 
he won't weave. She puts as many 
rounds on the shuttle as it will hold. 
When she stripes the rug, she puts 
as many rounds on the shuttle as she 
wants the stripe wide. She follows 
the same color pattern when she stripes 
a rug. She tries to end with the same 
color she started with. When she did 
red, white, and blue, she ended with 
the red. 
She listens to the radio or stereo while 
she weaves, but the weaving is enter¬ 
taining enough itself. You have to 
concentrate on what you're doing. She 
doesn't like to take out her mistakes. 
She has had to take out 6 or 8 inches 
where she has missed it somehow. You 
take it out like you put it in there, 
one row at a time. If you miss a string, 
you have to take a row out. It will 
show if you don't take it out. 
Weaving hasn't changed much and she 
hasn't changed her weaving much since 
she started. She made 120 last 
year which is the most she has ever 
made. The weather was so bad she 
couldn't get out, so she made rugs. 
She weaves 4 rugs a day if she stays 
right with it. She gets about 7 
rugs on the carpet roll unless they 
are very heavy. Sometimes you can 
get 9 rugs if the rags are fine. 
She just weaves until it rubs the

beater. 
Sometimes she is anxious to see what 
they look like, especially if they 
are different colors. Sometimes 
they surprise you. 
Pretty colors make a woven rug 
attractive. She can tell who has 
made each rug in the Craft shop. Some¬ 
one who takes as much time as necessary 
is a good weaver. One woman can't 
see well enough to weave good rugs. 
Pugs must be tight; when you weave a 
rug you never know how long it is 
going to be. Sometimes it will 
tighten up more than you expect. She 
can only generally estimate the length. 
The surface of the rug must be smooth. 
The edges should be all alike. She 
didn't know on her first rug to make 
the edges even. Her Uncle Charlie 
taught her how to pull the rags to make 
the margins even. She pulls the string 
through as tight as she can so it won't 
be long and short. 
Either the color of the warp or the color 
of the strings is important. The strings 
seem to be more important. 
She enjoys weaving because it is different. 
Not many people do it. Many people 
don't have the time or the patience. 
They can buy them cheaper than they can 
make one. It takes too many hours 
work to make one. She gets nervous 
if she isn't doing anything. She always 
has something to worry about. She 
can't quilt anymore because of her 
arthritis. She would rather quilt. 
She can weave when she can't quilt. 
She would rather garden and cook more 
than anything. There aren't enough 
people at home to do that anymore. 
She likes to cook anything. She likes 
to bake cakes, can, and freeze.

Meeting of the WMU tonight. 
Request for pictures. They'll 
march on us if we don't send 
the pictures. Fire Department 
and Rescue Squad. State wanted 
to take over the control of the 
rescue squad. Stories of

nurse went over the edge of 
a cliff; the rescue squad had 
to carry her up in a basket. 
A boy went over lover's leap. 
Helicopter came to pick him

Eileen Flint's quilting is 
good. Crystal has written 
a letter; people are very 
angry about it. They want 
to cut the access to the 
roads that were here before 
the parkway. During the fall 
you can't get down the road. 
Route 58 has been bumper to 
bumper down to the foot of the 
Mountain. They couldn't get 
into an Eastern Star banquet. 
Farm owners can't do anything 
to their property, and the 
Park Service will not give 
them permission. One man 
could not build a new home 
on his property. "That's 
Socialism." If they want 
a Revolution." "They'll 
blow the thing up." No body 
should come in and tell you 
what you can and can't do. 
No commercial vehicle can go 
on it. They want a half mile 
on each side, and "for what, 
I don't know." A beauty 
parlor operator wouldn't be 
able to have her shop. 
They want half a mile of 
land on each side. They want 
more land and to close the 
access roads. They can't close 
off access roads to a person's 
home. 
I know a family, they closed her 
access road, but they built 
her a new one. That could be 
done, but at great expense, 
and it's the taxpayer's moneey. 
Accidents. Two children have 
been hit at Mabry Mill. You 
don't always know the problems * 
m one area. 
Dairy Farmer had to cross the 
Parkway. You turn it around, 
and I'll get it off. 
The Parkway is owned by the 
people, but they act like it 
it owned by them. 
They are radical environmentalists. 
Terry Eiler explains his 
attitude. 
There is so much land, and food 
has to be produced. This land 
has been farmed for ages; why 
turn it into forrests.

the Parkway split us in two.

of some local officials.

One Ranger was always giving 
people tickets. 
Access road at Groundhog Mountain. 
Park Service didn't show up at 
the meeting. Groundhog Mtn. 
adds to the Parkway. The 
tourists appreciate it; local 
folk go there for dinner. Mabry 
Mill is so independent about 
their service. They want to 
close Groundhog Mountain because 
of competition. They play 
bridge out there. 
Many people supported the Parkway 
at first. Promises have not 
been kept. Story about the 
cow on the Parkway right-of- 
way. Ambulance was not 
allowed on the Parkway. 
Had to show the Park Service the 
stump of the Christmas tree. 
The funeral procession was 
going too slow. Crystal's 
husband had his gun broke 
down; Ranger stopped them. 
They couldn't break the guns 
down. They took their rifles 
away from them. The funeral 
was in December; there was 
hardly anyone on the Parkway. 
The road was supposed to \j/ 
connect a series of parks, 
not become a park itself. 
Once you've seen one tree; 
"they all look alike."

Flint had to get away from 
Oklahoma to realize how many 
Indians there are in that

Eunice is basting the quilt so 
it can be bound. The lady 
made thepieces, and Crystal's 
husband put it together. It 
was better to mix up the colors. 
They'll soon be ready to roll 
again. 
I thought you were going to say 
you liked any color as long as 
it was blue. Quilts should 
be sent to the cleaners. It's 
worth it to have them cleaned. 
We have to re-set our pins as 
we quilt. 
Now they'll just quilt on the 
two sides. It will probably 
take just one more day with 
this many people. 
Now quilts are a prized possession. 
For four or five years, they've 
been special. The Sunday School 
class fixed their teacher a 
quilt. This group has been 
quilting for two or three years. 
They sell them and bought the 
stove and refrigerator with 
the money. They sent one to 
Guatamala. 
Let's roll the quilt. Talking 
to Eunice McAlexander. They 
sell their quilts; how many 
they make depends upon how 
low the treasury is. This 
quilt will stay here until it's 
finished. Hillside heels and 
hillside cows.

Early life, quilting 
Index # 
Outline 
4-33 She was born 1906 in Virginia; her 
family included six children. She 
did all kinds of work on the farm. 
She did the cooking before she was 
11. She tended to the baby and took 
care of the washing. She used a 
wash tub and board at the spring. 
She could milk a cow before she was 
9. She cut tobacco. She has done 
all kinds of work. 
33 - 67 She cooked beans, potatoes, or green 
beans. They raised hogs and kept a 
cow. They hand-churned butter. They 
canned a lot of food. She had two 
stone jars for kraut and pickled 
cucumbers. She helped her mother. 
Her mother mostly mashed it down, 
added the salt, and did the tasting. 
She wishes she could go back to 
those times. She would like to see 
someone doing that. The whole family 
and the house is gone. She would 
like to go back home again, but you 
can't. 
67 - 82 She canned beans, berries, peaches, 
apples, huckleberries. Now they call 
them blueberries. You had to watch 
for the rattlers when you picked 
huckleberries. They had to haul 
water from the spring. She would 
kill the rattler with a rock or else 
run. They are all right if they 
don't start singing. 
page 2 
82 - 105 There were 6 children in the family. 
They dried apples and green beans. 
They called them shuck beans. She 
didn't string them; she spread them 
on a big white cloth. They were 
good. You soaked them overnight, 
and cooked them all day. She 
doesn't dry them because the 
chickens will get into them. A lot 
of times she didn't have a place to 
spread them out. 
105 - 1?6 She married at 21. She and her husband 
didn't agree, so she went back to her 
family. At 29, she married the second 
time. She left again; she got along 
with his children except one. She 
stayed with her first husband for 
about a year. Her first husband 
drank too much. She said if she had 
to make a living for her child, she 
would. She worked at home on the 
farm. She stayed with other people 
and helped them do things. She made 
enough to buy her boy some clothes. 
Getting a divorce was a little more 
trouble than it is now. Her husband 
would not support the child. She 
paid $100 for her divorce to Edgar 
Woolwine. The money was hard to get. 
She only Imade 500 an hour working for 
somebody else. It took a long time 
to get that much money. She had an 
acre of tobacco, she sold to pay for 
the divorce. She kept a calf; she 
sold it to get some money. 
176 - 257 She married the second time at 29. In 
the fall after he sold the tobacco, 
he would drink pretty bad. She had 
to wait on her husband like a baby 
after he had the stroke. She and 
Sam, his son, get along good. Some 
days her husband only had half a 
mind. Some days he was in good 
spirits and other days everything 
would upset him. She put wood in 
the stove each night to heat the 
house. Story about his death. There 
were no telephones, so they had to 
go for the doctor. He died at about 
6:00 in the morning. They brought 
him back to the house for the funeral. 
The children didn't want him left at 
the funeral home. 
She doesn't remember how she met him. 
She was friendly with his sisters.

She had met Lawrence although he 
wasn't staying at home. She was 
staying at a private home. She had 
to leave Herb one Sunday night when 
he was sick. She thought it would be 
better to be married and give her son 
a home. They got on well except when 
he was drinking. He would make a lot 
of money on the tobacco and buy a 
bottle or two. He didn't drink when 
he worked. He tried to keep something 
to eat. 
Things were rough during the Depression. 
Things are pretty rough now too. She 
pays the light and phone bill. Her 
son owes on the trailer and the pickup. 
She has a hard time getting around 
from month to month. He buys the 
groceries. Selling a quilt helps. 
He has a good job, but the payments 
are stiff. He has to pay gas for the 
driving he does. 
Times were worse during the depression. 
You couldn't get nothing then. They 
had stamps to buy sugar, coffee, or 
flour. You got a pair of shoes every 
six months. You don't have to have 
stamps now. People always had some¬ 
thing to eat. People wanted a little 
something extra. They ate beans and 
potatoes. 
There was plenty of moonshining going 
on then. You could hear one being 
destroyed every few days. There was 
more of than bottled and bonded. The 
people drank moonshine. She never 
did see a stilly she saw one after it 
had been destroyed. The liquor did 
stink. The beer barrels would be 
cut and dynamited. It didn't smell 
good. Everyone knew where to get the 
best liquor. She didn't know who 
some of the people were who were 
involved in moonshine. They moved 
the stills from place to place. She 
didn't know who did the work. She 
lived in Virginia during that time. 
Most of it was in Virginia. She 
came to North Carolina until 1940. 
She lived near Claudeville, Virginia. 
The moonshining went on in Patrick 
County; her mother and father lived 
in Patrick County and she was raised 
there. 
Her mother quilted; Elizabeth would do 
the outside work and her mother stayed 
422

in the house. She had old-time 
frames that would swing down from 
the ceiling. Elizabeth would help 
with the cooking and run the sewing 
machine. Her mother was good at 
cutting and Elizabeth would do the 
sewing. Her mother was good at 
dressmaking. Elizabeth did the 
straight seams. She sewed the quilt 
linings. 
450 - 470 She made a crossed T quilt once. It 
was the prettiest one she had seen. 
She had a pattern that was torn up, 
so she made herself one square as a 
pattern.

Outline 
Her mother marked off the quilt with 
chalk. She quilted in the fan$ she 
started with a small cirlce and made 
each one bigger until she started on 
a new one. Sometimes she went straight 
across the corners; it would be a square 
in the middle. 
She quilted with number 8 thread on spools. 
She would get black or white. If it 
was a light color, she would use dark 
thread. If it was dark color, she 
would use white thread so it would 
show. She wanted her design to show. 
She used a cotton backing. She would 
use a print. It took 5 yards for a 
lining. She got cotton padding in 
bats. She would spread that between 
the lining and top. 
33 - ^3 She never used old clothes for the filling. 
The only lining you could buy was 
cotton or yarn lining. It was a wool 
yarn lining. No one wanted yarn. 
43 - 62 Elizabeth learned from her mother. She 
started quilting when her husband died 
and she had more time on her hands. 
She had to have something to do. She 
never made quilts for her own family. 
She crocheted. She had pretty drawn 
work too. She pulled the threads out 
of a piece of white cloth. They were 
all burned up in the fire 2 years 
before her husband died. She didn't 
try any more handwork until after her 
husband died.

Drawn work is where you take a piece 
of coarse material, and tear out threds 
in a block design. Then you take a 
piece of thread and catch around the 
drawn work. She demonstrates how to 
do the drawn work. She showed me a 
piece of coarse fabric and how to do 
the drawn work. You pull out one or 
two threads until you get the pattern 
you want. You can make your design in 
different colors. She learned how to 
do that from her sister who learned at 
school. 
She learned how to crochet at school. 
It was a two room school. She would 
crochet while they did their work. 
Elizabeth asked her to teach her to 
crochet on her lunch hour. She showed 
her how to do the chain stitch. It 
didn't take long to catch on. 
She can't see to crochet that good. She 
likes to switch between quilting and 
crocheting. She can't see fine thread 
so much any more. She does the quilting 
because the crochet work is difficult 
to do. 
She quilts in the winter. It is warm in 
the house and you can go to town. She 
shows the yo-yo quilt pieces. She 
made up the pattern herself. She has 
seen them out of french knots and 
adapted it to quilts. 
She quilts after her chores are done in 
the morning. She has plenty of quilts 
for them to use. She is going to sell 
what she can. She has given all the 
children except one a quilt. Her 
son wants a counterpane not a quilt. 
She has given away a quilt to her 
granddaughter too. 
She got $65 for the yo-yo quilt. She 
took it to a craft shop on Eancy Gap 
road. She asked $65 for it; she was 
selling it at the shop for $95* She 
took the quilt back. She took it 
home because the woman was making 
too much on it. She sold it at the 
fair. Someone saw it at the fair and 
bought it. She bought some at her 
daughter-in-law's too. She got $65 
for it. 
She has been selling quilts since she 
started making them. She has been 
selling them for 20 years off and on. 
People want them by spells; this year 
several people want them. Later only

a few people may wan/t lliem. Sh.e lias 
no idea how many she sells per year. 
A neighbor sells them in Asheville 
and Richmond; her daughter-in-law 
will take a carload down there and 
sell them. She has sold twice as 
many as she has. She can tack the 
quilts too. She has sold quilt a 
few. 
She uses some polyester and some cotton 
in her quilts. She can't make a yo¬ 
yo out of polyester; it is too thick 
and you couldn't turn it under. It 
won't be close together when you pull 
it together. 
She uses what she has on hand for her 
other quilt tops. She doesn't care 
whether they are polyester or cotton. 
She has used polyester since it came 
in fashion. She used to be a dressmaker 
and she had a lot of pieces. She would 
use what she had on hand. 
She gets her fabrics from many places. 
She liked Rotenhauser; they sell the 
material cheap. They can find the 
material on sale. Bolt's Dress Shop 
sells short lengths just right for a 
yo-yo. They shop at places like fabric 
stores. She can get cotton material 
cheap er there than anywhere else. 
It is 250 a yard off the bolt. 
She uses cotton filler. If she uses 
the heavy knit fabric, she doesn't 
use a filler. She buys cotton batting 
available anywhere in the area. For 
the lining, she uses cotton from 
Rotenhauser's. Five yards will make 
a quilt lining. 
Making yo-yo's. She used to make yo-yo 
pillowtops about five years ago. She 
made the quilt tops later. She 
decided she wanted some new pillow 
tops, cut herself a pattern, and 
made some yo-yo's. She saw one in 
the newspaper. She went by the 
looks of it. You cut out a round 
circle, gather it all the way around, 
gather it up and tie it. Then put 
it together in different designs. 
You fit it together anyway it suits 
you. You couldimake some bigger 
than others. The other quilt was 
made in smaller yo-yo's because she 
had smaller pieces of material. 
She makes a new pattern for the yo-yo. 
She stitches it by hand round the

Favorite piecing patterns. Double 
Bow. She likes the yo-yo better than 
the flower garden. The flower garden 
is difficult to make, especially the 
path. She likes the yo-yo and the 
Double Bow. 
She learned to make the flower garden 
from someone in Virginia; she learned 
it recently. She saw the quilts at 
the woman's house; it was the first 
time she had seen it and the woman 
gave her the pattern. She told her 
how to put it together. 
vfhen she has a lot of little pieces she 
she puts them in squares. She got a 
little one from West Virginia; it 
used up a lot of small pieces. She 
likes to do that. She calls it her 
West Virginia pattern. 
She never appliques quilts. She wants 
a butterfly pattern. She wouldn't 
applique it; she would put it on with 
a zig-zag stitch. It's faster. 
Some she pieces on the machine; some she 
pieces by hand. The smaller pieces( 
can't be pieced by machine; j/ou can t 
hold them. Shows me a square of hex 
West Virginia quilt. They are made 
of small pieces, and had to be sewed 
by hand. Larger pieces can be done_ 
on the machine. She has never appliqued

work at the machine because she can't 
hear the TV. She likes to have some¬ 
one talking to her. The smaller pieces 
she can do with the television set on; 
if she sewed the larger pieces on the 
machine, she couldn't hear the TV. 
She works with her fingers. She has 
a set of quilting frames she has never 
used. She doesn't have enough room 
in the trailer. Mainly she tacks them. 
She makes patterns she doesn't have to 
quilt. The yo-yo doesn't have to be 
quilted. She has no room to quilt. 
She tacks them on the bed in the bedroom. 
She pins the corners down with safety 
pins and stretches the lining. She 
stretches the top and puts in some 
more pins. She sews all the way around 
it. 
The colors make a quilt pretty. The 
pattern has something to do with it. 
The tacking is not as pretty as the 
quilting. She likes the quilted ones 
better, but she can't do them. She 
has no where to do it. 
She would use different colored thread 
in her quilting; whatever would match 
the best. Crochet thread is good to 
quilt with. She doesn't try to make 
it contrast. She tries to pick out 
the dominant color and choose a 
thread to match that color. She 
wouldn't do it the way her mother 
did. She would go on with one color. 
Her mother used different colors to 
contrast with the colors in the quilt. 
That is too difficult for Elizabeth. 
She would make her circles in different 
colors; sometimes she would use one 
color. Her mother changed colors 
according to the colors in the pattern 
or made the lines in the fan different 
colors. At times she used one color. 
Elizabeth wouldn't do that. Offers 
me a cold drink. 
Elizabeth has not changed the way she 
quilts; she works at it a little more. 
Many people in the area quilt. Some 
quilt in the basement. On Piper 
Gap Road, a Mrs. Michael does some 
quilting. On her road, Mrs. Howell 
and Annice, her daughter-in-law. 
They do more than she does. They 
give the quilts to family who sell 
them for the women. They all quilt 
to sell them. Eor the past 10 
years they have been selling quilts. 
page 3 
When Annice quit' farming, she had 
more time to quilt. She learned to 
quilt from her mother. 
165 - 197 Strip quilts. String quilts. They were 
pieced in different designs. Little 
pieces, like log cabin or rail fence, 
were pieced together. They were called 
string quilts because they were little 
pieces joined together. Her grand¬ 
mother made them. She never heard of 
people sewing quilt pieces on paper. 
She heard of people sewing them on a 
piece of cloth so it looked like a 
shag rug. She has a rug crocheted 
out of bread wrapper paper from West 
Virginia. She could do it if she 
had a big needle. 
197 - 242 She will continue doing the yo-yo quilt 
because she needs something to work 
at. She wants to finish a quilt and 
then she'll start on a counterpane. 
She ran out of red material for her 
yo-yo. She made up the arrangement 
of the flowers on that quilt. The 
one at the fair is in straight rows. 
She put a ruffle around it. They were 
a smaller size. There is over a 
thousand yo-yo's in the quilt. It 
is harder to make than a regular 
quilt and it is harder to do too. 
You have to sew around each yo-yo and 
then sew all the pieces together. It 
takes longer. She just likes this 
kind of quilt; they sell well. She 
gets $65 for them. 
She wants to find a butterfly design. 
She wants to applique the pattern on 
by machine.

Born in Lowgap. She was a Ramey. 
They had a part of the old Ramey 
land grant. The family farmed; 
they grew wheat, corn, buckwheat, 
and raised cattle. She had to tie 
up the wheat in bundles. The 
threashing machine would come through 
the community. They had to cook 
everything in the house. They 
wore floursack dresses and long 
bloomers with white stocking and 
bonnets. 
There were four girls in the family. 
Fern was one of the oldest ones. 
Her younger brother was spoiled; Fern 
had to do his work. Many people 
didn't have wheat bread for breakfast. 
Her father always took their wheat 
to the flour mill in Galax. They 
raised cane and had molasses. They 
all hoed the corn three times. Her 
daddy let her ride the mules. 
Story about her little brother who never 
got punished. Her father was strict, 
and they respected him. Her brother 
died very young. Story about her w 
little brother and her walking to 
school. They took their dinner in 
a little lard bucket. The dinner 
bucket hit him in the mouth. "I told * 
you to leave her alone." A story 7 
about having to entertain in the 
Assembly at school. The next morning 
they had to do their numbers with 
his mouth all swollen.

We had a good life. They made their 
molasses to sweeten with. They 
had tenderloin, spare ribs, turnips, 
potatoes, candied yams, and sugar 
cookies for the threshers. They'd 
have pumpkin pies, and sweet potato 
pies. They made jellies and preserves 
but saved them for company. They 
had molasses everyday; they hated it. 
They ate it with biscuits and butter. 
They had to sell the eggs. Breakfast 
would be ham, gravy, biscuit, molasses 
and butter. 
She never had a store bought toothbrush. 
They brushed their teeth with a black- 
gum toothbrush. They brushed their 
teeth everyday with soda and salt. 
The dentist told her she had done a 
good job with the blackgum toothbrush. 
One would last a week. They would 
find one while walking. They used 
it brushing up and down. The dentist 
told her it would remove plaque. The 
stick was better than the toothbrush 
the dentist said. They dipped the 
brush in soda. She got a small tube 
of toothpaste when they started to 
promote it. In 1926, people didn’t 
know they needed a toothbrush and 
toothpaste. She made her paste 
last. She used it with her blackgum 
toothbrush. 
They made their own soap. He burned a 
certain kind of wood before they made /p* 
soap. He wouldn't let anyone get 
the ashes dirty. Her father would put 
them in a barrel to get the lye. They 
used the fat from the pig and boiled it 
to make cakes of soap. They used it 
to wash clothes. The two older girls 
had to stay home to wash clothes. 
They would race to school to be 
counted present. She had a good 
education. 
School days. Fern loved it. She was 
in plays. She started out with an 
inferiority complex, but she had 
nerve enough to get on the stage. 
Story about how she had to learn a 
part in one day and one night. 
All the kids were raised in the mountains, 
but some had more money than she did. 
During the depression, it was a really 
bad time. Fern can remember taking 
her daddy’s last 990 to buy a pair 
of shoes. Story about getting the 
money to buy the shoes from her father. 
page 3

That was in the 1930's. 
Life during the Depression. Many people 
didn't have any food at all. Her 
parents took meat and divided with 
neighbors. People could go to Dobson 
to get free food. They were too 
proud to get a handout. They might 
have gone hungry before they went 
to get food. No one starved to 
death. No one did any stealing. 
Neighbors would help one another. 
Fern has never been lonely. At night 
they would gather on the porch and 
played music. People could hear 
them a mile and a half away. Her 
brother played banjo, Fern played 
guitar and her sister played guitar. 
Her father played a Jew's Harp. He 
loved music and would get between 
the players. He loved his children. 
They are a close-knit family. They 
never wasted anything. They saved 
apple peeling for the pigs. Seeds 
should be saved for the birds. He 
taught them the trees and nature. 
He read newspapers avidly. They 
walked everywhere and he walked with 
them. Fern graduated from high 
school at sixteen. They all used 
the same dipper at school and they 
didn't even have an outdoor toilet.

She was called Dixie. Story about 
how she was named Dixie. "I've just 
got to see my Dixie." He named 
everybody. She started school in the 
third grade and graduated when she 
was just barely 16. There were no

Fern wanted to go to college, but 
she couldn’t afford it. She went 
to Mount Airy to work. She felt 
she was 18. 
She got a job in Rose's Five and Ten 
Cent Store. She made $9 a week. 
They had to ride with the mailman

music. She played with her girlfriend 
at schoolhouses in the area. She 
won a wristwatch as a prize in a music 
contest. The boys got jealous because 
the girls won the contest. "You just 
won because you was a girl." 
Her father talked to her before she 
moved to Mount Airy. He told her 
that he knew she would do the right 
thing in Mount Airy. She would have 
died before she did anything to 
shame him. She has tried to do that 
in her family.

It's important to let children

husband wouldn't even look at 
eachother. 
Story about how she and her husband 
finally decided they liked one 
another. "You're the only girl ^ 
I don't ever get tired of." That 
put me in seventh heaven. At his 
house they didn't talk to one another 
much. She moved back home. She 
couldn’t live in his house and date 
him. They used to double-date. 
Story about a girl who brought a 
big picture of him to Fern. He

married on Dec. 20. Everybody went 
to York, South Carolina to get 
married. His cousin went with them. 
Everybody knew itj they weren't eloping.

The band played all during their lifetime. 
They just had a good time with the 
family. They started playing for a 
Homemaker's Club Achievement Day. Fern

The visit with Ronnie Stoneman. They 
were planning a trip to New Mexico. ^1^ 
Ronnie Stoneman wanted them to visit. ^ 
She always takes them out to hear 
good music. Ronnie said, "Don't you 
come without bringing me some leather 
britches." Fern cooked Ronnie some 
beans. She took a lot of food with 
her, and when they set it on the table, 
Ronnie said, "You have brought me 
right back to my grandma's table. 
This is the best food I've ever 
eaten." She invited her sister, Donna, 
over. Everytime Fern goes to Nashville 
she brings Ronnie some leather britches. 
She never gets any any other time. 
Ronnie Stoneman was raised in Galax. 
She has a lot of people who live in 
Galax. They met through music. She's 
a real nice, conscientious person. 
She has discipline in her home. In these 
days, that’s just about a miracle. 
Family business. They started the Chain 
Saw business in 1955- Her husband 
didn't want to go back to the knitting 
business. He bought a sawmill. The 
chainsaws came in and they were much 
faster than a crosscut saw. He 
thought it was a good investment. They 
had a sawmill, chainsaw business, and 
dressing plant. Fern could count a 
load of lumber faster than any man 
could. She counted the loads of 
lumber. She took the lumber off the 
pully and put it on the truck. She

said she was not going to get involved 
in the chain saw "business. She did 
the bookkeeping work. Her husband 
got out of the sawmill business and 
began buying big equipment. He said 
she would have to take over the 
chain saw business. The business was 
next door to her home, so she was able 
to take care of her family too. She 
really took to chain saw selling. That 
winter she sold more than any other 
dealer in North or South Carolina. 
People call her the chain saw lady. 
She took over the business 18 years ago 
and ran it until 3 years ago. At 
a dealer's meeting she was the only 
woman there. She cramped their style. 
She was respected as one of the dealers. 
She always got an award for high sales. 
They were one of the top dealers; she'd 
have them put her husband's name on 
the award. 
The men trusted her. She still gets calls 
for advice. She read the books care¬ 
fully. The McCulloch saw had a piston 
that ran with the engine. She knew 
every part in the machine. She also 
likes to talk. She could tell them 
she had the best product. 
Disgruntled customer. She could kid him 
out of it. If someone complained aboux*' 
overcharging, she would kid him out of 
it. They would listen to hear when 
they wouldn’t listen to a man. She 
joked all the time. They want to 
"jew" you down all the time. She 
didn't price her product up. 
Jokes. Story about a man who bought JnT 
a saw chain for a saw mill. Man said 
the chain was no good; she sent it to 
McCulloch. Another story about a man 
who wanted to trade his saw in. He 
had the chain on backwards. She had 
a good saw. Another story about a 
man who had his chain on backwards. 
You know, "a man don't care about a 
woman knowing a whole lot." She didn’t 
act like she knew much. He had the 
chain on backwards. "When you got 
your saw chain on like this, you have 
to get on the other side of the tree 
to cut." He felt like a fool. She 
made a joke of it. Her husband didn't 
mind her working around men. Another 
story about the farmer who thought 
Fern was a widow-woman. That made 
her feel funny.

Her children helped her in the business. 
They are now in business for herself. 
She doesn't know how she had the 
strength to do it all. She would 
hang out the clothes to dry at night. 
She sewed all their clothes. Her 
husband made her quit working at 
midnight. She canned too; she set 
her alarm clock to wake up to take 
the cans out. She would go over to 
the store after the children went to 
school at 8s30. She would plan the 
evening meal that morning. Sometimes 
during a lull in the business, she 
would run back over to the house to 
do some chore. She enjoyed it. 
The mechanic who worked for her. He 
paid more attention to her than to 
her husband. Only once or twice did 
someone say, "what does a woman know 
about this." Evans Chain Store Co. 
Her brother-in-law also has a chain 
store co. now. 
Everyone thought the mechanic was her 
son. He was short, about 5 feet. 
Customers would say, "where’s your 
Mama?" They'd ask, "are you Evans's 
boy." Fern was having health problems, 
so her husband just sold it out from 
under her. She would not quit. They 
sold the property, and now she has time 
to do what she wants to do. 
Hobbies. Club work. She likes to help 
the old folks in the area. Cooks. 
She likes to have her whole family 
here to cook for. She cooks ham, 
green beans, potato salad, congealed 
salad, cake, pie, and biscuits. For 
a hot meal, she cooks chicken pie, 
two vegetables, and a dessert. Her 
children love her green beans and 
chicken pie. She doesn't overcook 
her beans. She cooks them the same 
way everytime. She doesn't know 
who taught her how to cook. She 
just learned to do those things. 
She makes biscuits with the tips of 
her fingers.

She was 75 this month; she was born 
September 9, 1905 in Grayson County 
not far from here. She married in 
1921. She made a picture of her 
wedding certificate 15 years ago. 
She did a lot of croceting, piecing 
quilts, and housework as a young 
girl. She lived on a farm with 9 
brothers and sisters. She had 3 
sisters. 
She did a lot of canning. She canned 
vegetable, beans, peaches, apples. 
She put up about 500 cans a year. 
She made homemade soap; they washed 
on a tub and washboard. She washed 
along a stream where she boiled the 
clothes over a fire. She scrubbed 
them on a board; she would run through 
two wash waters and two rinse waters. 
She hung them along the line with pins. 
They were pretty and clean. They 
sprinkled them and ironed them. They 
used starch in them. She washed clothes 
that way for 30 years. 
Making soap. Put on a big iron kettle. 
She used red devil lye with 3 gallons 
in a big kettle. She boiled it until 
the grease was eaten up. Let is set 
overnight and cut it into pieces. 
They used it for clothes and dish 
washing. They would chip it up and 
put it in the boiler to boil the clothes 
You would rub the soap on the clothes 
before you scrubbed them on the board. 
They would be clean before they were

■boiled. It is easier now to wash 
clothes. 
She made her own kraut and pickled beans. 
She put a layer of cabbage and a layer 
of salt in a 20 gallon jar. She put 
a big weight on it. It would keep all 
winter. Pickle beans were made the same 
way. They were cooked before they were 
put in the jar. 
Making hominy. She would cook 2 gallons 
of corn to get the husk off. She made 
a lot of it. She doesn't make it 
anymore. She cans all she needs now. 
She makes cucumber pickles, beets, and 
chow-chow. She makes pear preserves 
and apple, grape jelly. She makes 
apple butter in a big copper kettle 
in the back yard. They make 10 or 
12 gallons every other year. Some¬ 
times she makes it in the oven. She 
runs the apples through a coHander 
and cooks them several hours in the 
oven. It looks pretty. They can make 
so much more when they cook it in the 
back yard. They get together as a 
family to make it in the back yard. 
They do it when there are a lot of 
apples. They dry the apples they 
don't use for apple butter. 
They put the apples on a screen wire 
and dry them outside. She puts them 
in the oven after a few days to kill 
the bugs and worms. She stores them 
in jars. She also dries beans. She 
doesn't dry peaches anymore. You have 
to dry peaches quickly to have them 
look pretty. It takes hot sun to dry 
peaches. She dries beans on a screen 
wire; sometimes she dries them upstairs 
where it is hot, but it takes a few 
weeks for them to dry there. You 
have to heat them too. She puts them 
in a cloth bag and dips it in a kettle 
of hot water. That kills the insects. 
You dry them again and put them in jars 
or sacks. They will keep for years. 
Years ago she dried them by putting them 
on a string. You don't break them, 
but just hang them on a string. It 
is easier to break them first; they 
are ready to cook with your meat for 
2 or 3 hours. They are really good. 
She calls them leather britches or 
shuck beans. She loves them when they 
are full. They need to be dried when

they are really full.with no specks 
on them. They dry nice. 
She built the screen to dry food on. 
Just take some strips and some screen 
wire. They built it 3 of 4 feet long 
and 2 or 3 feet wide. The air goes 
through them and they dry faster. You 
have to stir them once in awhile. She 
dried peaches a few years ago. You 
have to lay them carefully in the sun. 
She cooks the peaches in sugar or syrupy 
they are good. She cooks the apples 
and puts sugar on them to make fried 
pies, or baked pies. How to make 
fried pies. You need a lot of grease 
to fry them pretty and brown. The 
family loves fried pies. She tries 
to get them crisp and light brown. 
Leather Britches. She soaks them over 
night. Par-boil them for awhile and 
rinse them off. Then she boils them 
with the meat, and cooks them until 
they are tender. They are good on a 
snowy day. 
The family likes green beans and apple 
pie, and pancakes. They like hot 
biscuits and cornbread. The family 
doesn't eat as much cornbread anymore. 
They like ham and gravy and eggs. She 
made crackling bread a lot; she doesn't 
anymore. She made chicken and dumplings 
too. They still like that. She learned 
to cook these things before she left 
home. 
Her husband lived here near her home. 
They went together 2 years. They 
built a home nearby, and later moved 
back to the homeplace. They have lived 
here ever since. It is a pretty old 
house. It has been here over 100 years. 
This used to be called the Patton 
Plantation; the family owned many acres 
in this area. They remodeled it on 
the inside and outside. They added 
on a bedroom and furnace room. The 
main house is just like it was. The 
original house had five rooms. It 
had three rooms on the first floor 
and two above the two front rooms. 
It had a porch on the back too. The 
house is built on logs; the walls are 
frame. The whole foundation is logs. 
They are 8 or 10 inches across. 
She and her husband lived here when they 
were first married. They stayed here 
11 months, moved one half mile away j-or 
page 4 
12 or 15 years, and then moved back 
here. 
340 - 356 She and her husband were always meeting 
somewhere. They were together every 
weekend; sometimes a neighbor had 
fiddle and banjo music. They had 
singing or Church on Sunday. 
330 _ 429 They were married in the car in Galax. 
She enjoyed it. They just sat in.the 
car. They didn't have a big wedding. 
They got along good all her married 
life. He has been dead 6 years. 
A neighbor was a witness to the wedding. 
They went in front of the preacher's 
home; they chose to be married in the 
car. They didn't want to go up to his 
home. The ceremony didn't take very 
long. She stayed at her mother's 
for a few weeks while they kept the 
wedding a secret. Then they decided 
they better tell people. That was 
56 years ago. Young folks today like 
to have a big wedding. They are out 
in the public a lot more than she was. 
429 - 463 Their parents knew they were going to 
get married. Other folks didn't know; 
they just decided they wouldn't tell 
for awhile. They stayed with his 
widowed mother for 11 months. They 
decided they wanted to live by 
themselves. They got along just fine. 
She had another son in his teens. After 
she died, they bought the house.

Early life, witch stories, quilting 
Index # 
Outline 
2-57 Witch stories. Story of a neighbor 
whose spinning wheel would go back¬ 
wards. The woman got sick; the 
witch would come to see her in a 
certain color. Telephone interruption. 
Repeats story of spinning wheel. 
Repeats story of woman getting sick. 
When the witch wore a black dress, the 
woman would die. They would put horse 
shoes over the door to protect the 
house from witches. A man when to eat 
with the witch; she asked him if he 
wanted milk. She got the milk from a 
hand towel. The witches would draw 
the milk from the cows. 
57-78 She used to tell her grandchildren the 
witch stories at bedtime. They enjoyed 
the stories. They weren't scared. Times 
have changed. Children would walk to 
school and they had plays at Christmas. 
Now the children go on the bus; they 
used to walk together to school and 
they enjoyed it. 
78 - 97 Shn has been quilting since she was 12 
or 14. She pieced them with her fingers 
with her grandmother. She pieced them 
on the machine, put them in frames, 
padded them, tacked, and quilted them. 
Her grandmother was a good hand at 
quilting. She enjoyed making pillow 
tops and quilts. She did a lot of 
crochet work too. She stopped the 
crochet work when her eyes got bad 
and she didn't have the time.

Quilting patterns. Slie had a Sawtooth 
pattern, Poplar Leaf. Crazy Quilt. 
She did most Crazy quilts. You use 
little strips on a larger strip of 
cloth. These quilts were pretty. 
You would sew these strips together. 
Put the cotton in between and line 
them. You could quilt them in fans 
or quilt them in rows. Some would 
quilt close and some wouldn’t. The 
closer you quilted them, the longer 
they would last. The shorter the 
stitch, the prettier they were. Then 
you turn the hems down and whip it 
around so the thread didn't show. 
Strip quilts. She sewed the strips of 
cloth to a piece of paper. Then she 
would tear the paper off and put on 
the wadding and lining. They used 
old catalogs because it was thinner 
than regular paper. They called it 
Roebuck catalog or Wards. They would 
piece the squares on a page of Sears 
catalog. Then they would sew the 
blocks together. She has some that 
way. When they didn't have worn out 
cloth to use, they used paper. You 
could cut your strips from catalog 
sheets. She doesn't have one now. 
She quilted to keep warm. They didn't 
have heat in the house and they 
didn't keep a fire all night. They 
needed 3 or 4 quilts to keep warm. 
You had to have a lot to keep warm. 
She quilted in the fall or winter. 
There was too much gardening and 
canning to do it in the summer. They 
quilt most of the day; it would take 
most of one day to quilt. They would 
put it in in the morning and get it 
out by evening. A group would get 
together to fix the quilt. They would 
help eachother a lot. 
They had the quilting frames hung from 
the loft, or they set them on four 
chairs. They would set around it and 
quilt. In this house, they did it 
in the loft. It was easier to keep 
up there where there weren't so many 
people coming in and out. They some¬ 
times left one up over night in a 
room they didn't use. She didn't 
spend much more than one or two days 
on the quilt. If she did it by herself, 
it took her more than one day.

217 She would have several quilts to quilt 
or tack so she wouldn't have to get 
the frames out again. She would 
quilt or tack 3 or 4 at a time. If 
the top wasn't too heavy she would 
quilt them. If they were heavy, she 
would tack them. 
227 Some are quilted, some are tacked, and 
some are joined with secret tacking. 
You run the needle under an inch, and 
make the stitches about every inch or 
inch and a half apart. There weren't 
any ties on it. 
234 They decided it was easier and quicker 
to do it that way. It was quicker 
than the tacks because you didn't have 
to tie it. The secret tacking wasn't 
tied. 
255 She made quilts for family use. She 
never sold any. She quilted for other 
people who paid her for it. It was 
10 or 15 years ago. She made quilts 
to give to the grandchildren. She 
made patterns she was used to making. 
266 Ila used cotton for her tops in the past, 
but lately she has been using polyester. 
It works well. Different patterns of 
polyester are pretty. When you use 
polyester tops, you need to use poly¬ 
ester linings. She has done several 
for the grandchildren. 
285 She used cotton because that was what she 
had. She used cotton backing with them. 
Eight or ten years ago she started 
using polyester. She uses leftover 
scraps. The needle goes through 
polyester good. It works better than 
cotton; it goes in the frame good. 
Jl^ She used cotton batting padding. It 
comes in rolls and she spreads it on 
the lining and pins it in. You had 
to tack it to get all three layers 
together. She bought her own cotton 
batting; her grandmother made her own 
cotton batting in the loom. Her made 
wool blankets too. She had a big hand 
loom and made her cotton batting. 
350 Ila never used old clothes in the quilts. 
She might have made a couple like 
that; she did use old blankets in the 
quilts. You can use worn clothes, 
cut them in big pieces and use them 
in quilts. She did it, but not too 
often. She never used wool as a filler. 
(rJ- 
page 4 
330 - 363 
The lining. She used cotton and later 
polyester. Her grandmother used to 
use wool. She dyed the linings 
different colors. Sometimes she would 
dye the squares for the tops different 
colors. Sometimes she would strip 
them through. She would dye 4 inch 
strips for the quilts, or she would 
put them in diamond shapes. If she 
pieced them in blocks, she would dye 
the fabric for the strips inbetween. 
She has pieced them in crazy blocks 
and run a 4 inch strip inbetween 
them. 
363 - 388 
Thread. She bought quilting thread 
She would buy different colors for 
tacking. In quilting she would also 
use different colors, but she used 
white too. She would get the colors 
that matched the top of the quilt. 
Like making a dress, you have to buy 
the thread to match the material. 
She matched sometimes the color of 
the lining and sometimes the color 
of the top. You couldn't match the 
top if you had too many colors. 
ie quilt is quilted with red thread. 
She just had that color and decided 
to use it. 
396 - 428 
Favorite piecing patterns. She liked 
to piece Crazy Quilts. She didn't 
cut any patterns; it took a lot of 
material to do that. A Crazy Quilt 
uses every scrap of material. She 
would sometimes cut a big block out 
of paper or material, and just start 
in the corner and go backwards and 
forwards until she had it pieced. 
Sometimes she would just sew them 
together or sometimes she would set 
them up. Sometimes she would take 
a 6 or 8 inch strip and piece them 
in strips. She did most of her like 
that; she didn't have time to piece 
them. She had too many other things 
to do. 
•azy Quilts. Sometimes she would piece 
them in a block and turn them and put 
them in a diamond shape. She would 
put half block in the quilt and then 
start another row like that. Sometimes 
she would sew the crazy blocks on a 
piece of paper starting with the biggest 
piece of fabric diagonally and filling 
in with the smaller pieces. 
page 5 
She would trim away the excess fabric 
around the squares. Then she would 
fit the squares together with strips 
around them sometimes, or put the 
blocks in a diamond shape.

Appliqued quilts. She has only done 
several^ The Dutch Girl and the 
Dutch Boy. She would set down with 
a needle and applique them; sometimes 
she used a machine. She got the 
patterns from a neighbor. The Dutch 
Boy is her own pattern; she saw a 
picture and drew the pattern herself. 
She had seen a quilt top and kept it 
in mind. She drew it out and pieced 
it. Those are the only appliqued 
quilts she has made. She helped her 
granddaughter make an appliqued Bird 
quilt years ago. Sometimes the Crazy 
Quilt strips were appliqued; she would 
do a feather stitch around the pieces 
with different colored thread. It made 
them pretty. It made them look a heap 
fancier. Sometimes she would do that 
just to pass the time. She called it 
the feather stitch. 
She pieced her quilts by hand at first 
and then she started using a machine. 
The machine was quicker. She didn't 
quilt on a machine; she quilted by 
hand. She pieces them now by machine. 
She can get more done, and the quilts 
last longer. 
Favorite quilting patterns. She usually 
quilts in the fans. Sometimes she 
goes from one corner to another. Some¬ 
times she would go straight from one 
end to the other. Most of the time 
she would use the fan. She would take

a string, tie it on a piece of chalk, 
and mark the quilt. She made 6 or 
8 lines in each fan about an inch 
apart. Some you would put closer and 
some farther apart. The smaller the 
fans, the prettier they are. They are 
closer together, and they last a lot 
longer. They will hold up in the 
laundry better. She would quilt in 
the fan, in straight lines, and 
sometimes in rectangles an inch apart. 
She often quilted by the pieces the 
Dutch Girl is done that way. Little 
blocks or patterns are done that way. 
Quilting by the pattern is more 
modern; she did it several years ago. 
Nine of Diamonds. She has seen them 
pieced in the Nine Patch, but she has 
never done one. Her sister liked to 
piece different patterns, and Ila 
helped her. She had all kinds of 
different patterns. She has names for 
all of them. 
The smaller the pieces you put in quilts 
makes them pretty. The different colors 
and patterns makes them pretty. 
Matching the colors makes them pretty; 
it is best to use two colors, or 
piece them in two colors and add another 
color. Piecing blocks with smaller 
blocks makes a pretty quilt. The whole 
quilt may be made of 1)1 inch squares; 
you save a lot that way. 
The smaller the stitch the prettier and 
neater the quilt looks. The thread 
should match the scraps used to piece 
the quilt. It shows the quilting 
much better to use different colors 
of thread. Little, small stitches 
are better; they should be straight 
and even. Make them all the same 
size. 
The quilting is more important in a 
quilt. They should be pieced neat 
and nice and quilted neat and nice. 
That will make them last a long time. 
She wants to know if I quilt. 
Finishing the quilt off. She binds it 
around to match the lining or the top. 
It is prettier than it is to hem the 
quilt. She sews it on and then turns 
it over and stitches it down. She 
used to hem them; sometimes she would 
turn the lining on the top if it was 
a pretty color. She would whip it 
page 3 
34 inch around the top. She has also 
taken the top and hemmed it around 
the bottom. Sometimes the top or the 
lining was bigger, so that determined 
which side would be the hem. Some¬ 
times they are even, and you can just 
sew the two sides together and not have 
a hem at all. She prefers a nice hem; 
she likes the lining over the top if 
it is a pretty color. 
202 - 258 She hasn't changed the way she quilts at 
all. She never quilted with a quilting 
group. She quilted with her neighbors 
when they helped one another out. She 
would go help them, or they would come 
help her. She quilted a half dozen 
quilts for her neighbors. They furnished 
the pieces, tops, and linings. They 
wanted some pretty quilts. They worked 
and didn't have the time to quilt. 
They paid her $5 or &6, a pretty good 
price, for her to quilt the quilts. 
They pay a lot more than that now, 
about $10 she thinks. She hasn't 
made quilts for several years. She 
just uses blankets; the quilts are too 
hard to clean. Blankets are softer, 
lighter, and easier to handle and 
maintain. She likes blankets better. 
She uses an electric blanket. She 
still uses them on company beds. She 
stopped using them 10 or 15 years ago. 
258 - 289 Quilts. Pieced in blocks quilt. It 
has a white cotton lining and is 
quilted in the fans with red thread. 
She chose the red thread to match the 
top. She has a lot of red in the top. 
She turned the lining over the top 
about an inch wide. The fans are close 
together; there isn't an inch between 
them. 
289 - 332 Dutch Girl quilted by the piece. It is 
appliqued on to cotton. She turned the 
top down and stitched it on the back. 
She made this 6 or 8 years ago. She 
made the blocks out of feed sacks that 
were dyed yellow. The lining is 
domestic used to make sheets out of. 
It is new. It is quilted around the 
Dutch Girl, and around each block. 
The earlier quilt was made 25 years 
ago. 
This quilt was made 25 years ago too. 
The quilt done in secret tacking in 
straight lines. There is an inch

between each, stitch^ instead of tying 
it, they secret tack it. A second 
quilt is stitched diagonally. It 
is in squares. It is pieced in a 
three block each way and set up with 
a diamond in each corner. It has 
two inch strips between each block. 
It is quilted from one corner to the 
other corner. It is quilted with white 
thread to match the lining. She turned 
the top over and hemmed it on the 
back side. 
A tacked quilt. It is pieced in blocks; 
some are pieced and some are solid. 
A block has nine blocks in it. 
Cathedral Window. She made it 4 or 5 
years ago. It is the most recent one 
she made. She got it from a friend 
who quilts a lot. 
Navy blue quilt was made a long time 
ago. It was marked with chalk. They 
dipped the yarn string in flour and 
water and fastened it from one corner 
to another to mark the quilt. They 
flick the string and the mark will be 
on the quilt. It shows the line when 
it dries. It would wash out, but you 
can see some on it now. They did 
that a lot of time. If they laid out 
the fans, they had to use the chalk. 
If they used straight lines, they 
dipped the yarn in flour and water. 
They mixed it thin like paste. That 
was a quick and easy way to do it. 
They would draw each straight line 
so they didn't get them crooked.

Early life 
Index # Outline 
2 - 42 She was born near Baywood, Va. in 1909; 
her grandmother was a slave. Her 
mother was raised by white people. 
Her grandmother died when her mother 
was little, and the white people raised 
her. She went to school. She was 
raised by the Higgins who family is 
in Galax now. She has 3 sisters and 
7 brothers. She finished the 7th 
grade; high school was not open to 
Blacks. She did a lot of reading. 
Her parents would bring home papers 
and she would read them. She could 
read well because she didn’t like to 
do dishes. She married in 1933- They 
have one child in Chicago. They 
moved to North Carolina in 1921. 
4-2 - 97 Her grandmother died when whe was 6 
year's old. Her mother taught her to 
read and write. She never heard any 
stories about her grandmother's slave 
days. Donna's mother says they treated 
her like one of the family. Donna 
thinks she was because her mother was 
so white. Her older sister took her 
mother, and she lived with her until 
she married. She was raised down near 
the New River. Independence was the 
county seat. They had to cross the 
river to get to Independence, and they 
had to cross it in a boat. Baywood 
was their post office. She had to 
walk 4 miles to school. Some elderly 
ladies kept Donna so she could live, 
closer to school. They made her sleep

sleep in a trundle bed, and it scared 
her. These ladies were good to her; 
she was 7 years old. She learned her 
spelling from the people her mother 
worked for. The lady crocheted and 
made Donna would read to her. It was 
a help to her. 
Her father and mother worked for the 
same family, the Pooles. Some of 
the family still lives at Wytheville. 
The daughter lived in Independence for 
awhile. She has a sister 7^; s&e 
lives next to the Laurel Glenn Church. 
The property belongs to her husband. 
Her daughter lived there for awhile, 
and then moved to Illinois. Her sister 
lived in Maryland, and lives in the 
house; she stays with sick people. 
She works for the Dr. Thompsons in 
Sparta and Marion of Marion's Hen 
House. She likes to have someone 
to talk to, and she cleans the house 
and does ironing. She puts in 4 or 5 
hours a week for each family. She 
goes to each place one day a week. 
She had an easy life. She doesn't 
remember much except going to work 
with her mother. The lady's daughter 
had dolls they could look at but not 
handle. The woman taught her to read 
and spell. Her father could not read 
and write, but her mother did. She 
did not have time to teach Donna how 
to read. 
They had a four room house. There were 
10 children, but she was the last one. 
Only one was at home when she was 
there. They were all gone, except 
when they would come over to visit. 
She grew up with her sister who lives 
nearby and is 4 or 5 years older. She 
likes to stay with sick people; it is 
better than being alone. She only 
comes home every 2 or 3 weeks. They 
grew up together. Her mother would 
take both of them to her job. It was 
a treat to go to the big house. They 
had a girl who was nice to them; they 
cut out paper dolls. 
Donna started school at 8. Her older 
sister was sick, and Donna had to walk 
3 miles alone. The superintendent 
made the family see that she attended 
school. He had her spelling and doing 
math problems. They said a child who 
reads as well as she does should be

in school. Her parents sent her to 
live with these two ladies; she was 
afraid of the trundle bed. 'They were 
good to her. She used to visit them 
later. She didn't have much encourage¬ 
ment at home; these two ladies helped 
her. Her schooling ended at the 71k 
grade. They had a high school at 
Glade Valley; it was a private school. 
The students come from many places to 
go to school there. 
Donna hoarded with these ladies until 
she was 11. The family moved to 
North Carolina. She went to the 71k 
grade here. She lived 2 miles from 
here at Glade Creek. It was too far 
for her to walk. She had a hard time 
getting an education. Even her daughter 
couldn't attend school. Poor people 
couldn't afford to send her to 
Greensboro or High Point. 
The family had a small farm. Her mother 
was raised by an aunt and uncle, and 
she inherited a farm. Donna's father 
was getting old, and he had always 
rented land. He wasn't able to be 
a sharecropper anymore. They went 
to take care of the uncle and they 
would get the land for their lifetime. 
Donna's father went blind from diabetes. 
At the end, he could hardly take care 
of himself. They lost their family 
Bible, and she doesn't have a record 
of family births. She had to get a 
report from the Bureau of Census to 
get social security. 
Her family wanted her to move to North 
Carolina with them. The school was 
where they could get an old empty 
house. They always had a very good 
teacher. Donna could read, write, and 
spell as well as they could. Most 
of the teachers were local people, 
perhaps they had finished the 71k grade. 
Donna's daughter didn't have to go to 
a school like that. They did have to 
board her one year because the school 
was so far away. One year they had 
school at the Macedonia Church. She 
went to school at 7 or 8 years. 
Donna learned to read and write at home 
and from other people. The two ladies 
with whom she boarded were white. One 
lady, the Coxes, for whom her mother 
worked, taught Donna a lot. Her sister 
would stay at home before she would 
have lessons with Mrs. Cox. She didn't

like scliool, and she could play sick 
and not go to school. Mrs. Cox had 
10 children of her own. The Pooles 
was where she would take Alma and 
Donna. What little she learned, she 
learned from Betty Poole. She knew 
her ABCs and knew how to spell. 
Donna thought it was awful to be taken 
away from home. The two ladies had 
very good learning, and so did Donna's 
mother. Her father had to make a 
straight mark to keep track of his 
time. On the fifth day, he would 
make a cross mark. He worked many 
a day for 500. Her mother said she 
washed all day for 500. They felt the 
people were good to give them that 
work. The people were not cruel to 
them. The people helped them a lot. 
The people moved away to a place near 
Baywood. Story about how Donna stopped 
by to see them. They hadn't seen her 
in years, but he recognized her.

1-22 Sometimes her younger days were not 
happy because they were left at home 
alone. Her parents would go if some¬ 
one had died. They would play with 
paperdolls after their parents,left. 
When they thought their parents should 
be coming home, they would start 
hollering through the open window. 
Soon they would hear them respond. 
There were no other black children in 
the area at all. She didn't know 
what it was like to play with black 
children. Her fatherhad 21 acres. 
22 - 81 She was in North Carolina during the 
Depression. She married in 1933* 
They moved up here in 1919, and she 
went to school through the 6th grade. 
There was no school that blacks could 
attend. They didn't have any school 
for blacks at Galax, Sparta, or 
Independence. They didn't have a ' 
school building in Allegany County for 
the black children until the 19A0's. 
She walked from Glade Creek to an 
old log cabin for school. They 
finally had school in the church; 
the children scarred up the pews, so 
they had to stop that/ Ms. Clyde 
Fields got a school building for the 
black children. It is on the old 
highway. The children would mark up 
the pews, so Ms. Fields got them a 
good church building. Ms. Fields 
retired. Then the integration thing 
came around. That was the end of the

school. She doesn't know what they 
did with the old building. Integration 
was a good thing for those who tried 
to make it work. When they finished 
elementary school, they were able to 
go to high school. A lot of people 
here went to West Virginia; they 
would take their children there to 
go to high school. They had good 
teachers and good superintendents. 
She was scared to death the first day, 
but they didn't have any serious 
trouble. 
She married in 1933* She met her 
husband in school. They would walk 
to school together. She was looking 
at a lot of men then. They just 
got a license and went to a minister. 
His cousin was a minister,and he 
performed the ceremony. 
Depression. It wasn't too bad. The 
people made their living on the farm. 
This house and farm was handed down. 
Sabe's father bought the place from 
his grandfather. The farm has stayed 
in the family. The old house was on 
this spot. The old house caved in. 
Sabe built this house himself. 
Sabe never worked in West Virginia. He 
worked on a Dairy farm in Maryland. 
He started in the late 20's and came 
back in 1933• When he came back, 
they married and lived with her mother 
for a year or two. Sabe built two 
rooms of the house to start with, the 
Iving room and the kitchen. He kept 
enlarging and adding on rooms. It's 
hard to heat in the winter. Story 
about Sabe's illness. Sabe didn't 
want to go; they had to get someone 
to drive them to Winston-Salemn. Her 
son-in-law drove them down. He had 
a bad thyroid condition. She stayed 
with a cousin every night. He is 
nervous and works hard. The Doctor 
said it won't come back. 
Cooking. They canned in a brass kettle. 
They didn't have a fancy kettle to put 
on the stove. They filled the jars 
and put 7 in the kettle outside. 
They canned peaches, beans, sweet 
potatoes. They dried beans, apples, 
and peaches. They had their own 
wheat flour and corn meal. They 
didn't know what it was to go to the 
store and buy food. They had a cow

than it is now. It is a rat race 
now. 
iey dried beans on a flat rooftop 
or put them on boards on a chair. 
They would put a newspaper or cloth 
under them and they would dry in 2 
or 3 days. She doesn't know much 
about pickle beans. She made many 
gallons of kraut. They chopped the 
cabbage and put it in with salt 
layer by layer. They put a plate on 
top of the kraut and put a stone on 
top of the plate. The beans will 
work. They couldn't touch their 
mother's beans or kraut until they 
were done. 
miiny. Her mother made it, but Donna 
never has. You boil the corn until 
the husk comes off, and then you boil 
it somemore. It is an all day job of 
boiling. Her mother would put a spoon 
fully of lye in the water to make the 
husk come off. Her mother was raised 
by white people, and she learned to 
use the lye from them. They used 
ashes, but her mother used lye. She 
They boiled the liver and the lower 
jaws pf the hog. They cooked it; 
some people included the kidney, but 
her mother wouldn't because she said 
poisons were in the kidney. They 
would boil it and she would work it 
up with her hands until it was mush. 
She would add fat to it. It was good. 
She makes that. They only killed one 
pig last year; she didn't make any 
dumplings. Donna makes it occasionally. 
Recipe for chicken and dumplings,

Quilts. Around the World quilt. How she 
pieced the pattern. She starts with 
one square and keeps adding squares to 
it. As you add, it gets longer and 
longer on each corner. She planned 
her colors from a pattern she got from 
a lady she works for. She quilted it 
in straight lines; she followed the 
lines of the square. It is quilted by 
hand; it is all top work. No wonder 
she had bursitis. She had the quilt 
in frames and had to stretch to reach 
it. She has given her daughter and 
grandchildren many of her quilts. She 
doesn't plan to make any more. People 
don't need as many as they used to. 
Now everybody had heated houses. Now 
all you need is one quilt, a blanket, 
and a sheet on the bed. She uses a 
sheet to keep the lining from getting 
soiled. The quilts will wash, but 
the cotton will wad up inside. She 
sleeps next to a sheet, a blanket on 
top of it, and then the quilt. That 
way her quilts don't get old and 
dirty looking. 
She never sold a quilt. She just gives 
them to the children. She has three 
grown granddaughters and one son. She 
gives them quilts. She won't be able 
to make them for her great grandchildre 
Her mother taught her to make quilts. 
People would give her quilt pieces. 
Black people had it rough. She 
noticed that in the homes of her

friends. 'Their quilts were not as 
good. Her mother was a good cook and 
she worked too. She came up with 
white people where she got her learning. 
Donna learned from white people too. 
She never did any sewing, just housework, 
Donna's mother taught her to quilt with 
patterns she got from white people. 
The family pieced and quilted together. 
They pieced them by hand, but Donna 
pieces her's at the machine. There 
are a lot of pieces in a quilt. 
Fabrics. She likes to use prints. A 
solid color sets it off nicely. She 
alternates solid and print fabrics. 
Mrs. Thompson's mother worked on 
quilts all the time. She quilted 
around the flower by finger. That is 
finger work. Someone gave her the top 
and she did the rest. She has managed 
to work with some good white people. 
She started working for Dr. Thompson 
in 1945. They haven't always had this 
good road, and sometimes she couldn't 
get to work. She hasn't missed a week 
since 1945. Mrs. Thompson's mother 
gave her the Trip Around the Weald 
pattern. She had some beautiful quilts. 
Donna always uses cotton fabrics in her 
quilts. They didn't have polyester. 
She got her scraps from people who made 
their clothing, and that was from 
cotton. She used cotton scraps from 
clothing. Cotton isn't any better 
than polyester, but polyester hadn't 
got here yet. 
Filler. She used rolls of cotton for 
her filler. She .would spread a sheet 
of it on her lining. You have to have 
a quilting frame 2$> yards long and 2 
yards wide. You put your lining on the 
frame with shoe tacks and draw it as 
tight as you can. The cotton comes 
in a big roll and you put it on the 
lining. You put your quilt top on top 
of that, and fasten it down with shoe 
tacks. Then you start quilting. 
She never used old clothing or blankets 
in her quilts. She is sure her mother 
did though. You can use a worn 
blanket for filling. Older people 
used anything they could get for a 
quilt. They used flour or salt bags 
for hand towels or sheets. Her mother 
159 - 200 
200 - 210

never did that because all the 
children were gone. Her mother told 
her that she made sheets and petticoats 
out of salt and flour sacks. They 
fared better because times were getting 
better. Donna has used feed sacks as 
quilt linings. She dyed the sacks; 
she never uses a white lining because 
they get dirty. If you wash them, the 
cotton padding will wad up. If you 
don't quilt them close together the 
cotton will lump up. 
She sleeps next to a sheet, and she has 
never washed a quilt. She has had some 
wear out, but she has never washed one. 
If the quilt doesn't touch your body, 
it doesn't get dirty. All her quilts 
have been used for years and they don't 
get dirty. She uses a sheet on each 
side of the quilt and it doesn't get 
dirty. Her mother doesn't wash quilts, 
and she follows her practice. You 
ruin quilts when you wash them. Mr. 
Thompson's mother had a lot of old 
blankets that were homemade. They 
were woven on looms. She doesn't 
remember her mother having a loom. 
People used to use blankets in their 
quilts, and she is sure her mother 
did. People were always giving her 
things. She didn't use old clothing 
unless it was wool. There is no warmth 
in cotton she said. Donna doesn't 
know how she raised the first 8 children. 
Donna has two sets of quilts: her Sunday 
quilts and her everyday quilts. She 
only has one or two everyday quilts. 
She doesn't have a big family and 
doesn't need them. She has given 
them to the family. She just keeps 
enough quilts to use on the bed if 
she has company. 
The everyday ones are just everyday 
patterns. She keeps one under the 
cushion on the couch. It is an old 
quilt in a star pattern. She did 
make some in strips, but she doesn't 
have many of those. The star quilt 
is one of the oldest she has. It 
is 10 or 15 years old. She keeps 
it under the cushion for additional 
support. 
Donna has never made an applique quilt. 
She knows how it is done, but she lost 
her ambition to make one. She had 
enough to take care of her family, 
page 4

and the bursitis bothered her. She 
thought her shoulder was out of place. 
It comes back on her occasionally. 
It just tore her arm up; she hasn't 
made any since she made those 3 or 4 
quilts 4 or 5 years ago. 
Quilting patterns. She uses the fan or 
half moon pattern most often. She 
draws it off from her head. She 
doesn't use any marking. She never 
didn mark one although her mother did 
with chalk. She learned to do the 
quilting without all that chalking. 
Sometimes the chalk won't come out. 
She just did it in her head. There 
are no other quilting patterns she 
likes to use. Most of the time she 
follows the design of the square 
because she usually goes by squares. 
If you get into making designs, you 
get into a lot of work. 
Piecing the squares. Donna never used 
a piece of paper as a backing, but 
her mother did. They would leave that 
paper on that square; she would hear 
them say, leave the paper on, it makes 
the quilt that much warmer. Her mother 
would tear the newspaper off, but some 
ladies left it on there. She used 
newspaper or sometimes a catalog. A 
catalog was a rarity in those days, 
so they wouldn't tear one up often. 
They pieced it in squares and put 
them in strips. 
Patterns. Her mother had Trip Around 
the World and Plower Basket. She 
would use a solid piece at the top of the 
square for that pattern. The solid 
piece was a V; she would piece the 
basket and leave the center a triangle. 
She would put a piece on for the handle. 
Donna has never made one. Her sister 
might have had one, but her children 
might have worn them all out. Her 
sister made one or two since she has 
been home. Today you just make strips 
or a solid piece of material like 
calico or a print and put it on a 
piece of cotton and you have a quilt. 
You don't have to do all that piecing. 
She doesn't know what people do with 
sewing scraps anymore. 
Thread. She used #8 cotton thread. Some¬ 
times you had to change your colors 
quite a bit. She tried to match her 
colors. She was able to use white

thread all the way through. She 
never used red or black. The thread 
showed up in those pieces. They 
didn't pay that much attention to 
making quilts. They didn't treasure 
them. She would like to make one now 
if she had pieces. 
She never used a contrasting thread. 
They do that now days. A few people 
these days are making quilts. She 
hears them advertised on the radio. 
Her mother could weave; she had a 
loom. She never did see her use it, 
but she does remember the loom. 
She would set up her quilt frame in 
the living room. If anybody came to 
the house, they had to come through 
the kitchen. 
She never quilted with a group. Her 
mother would have quiltings with 
3 or 4 ladies putting out a quilt in 
one day. They would tack quilts too. 
That takes a lot of time to cut the 
threads. Donna never tacks quilts. 
Her mother didn't like the tacks; she 
said they fell apart. She never used 
old clothing either, just old blankets. 
The design makes a quilt pretty. A strip 
just pieced in anyway isn't very pretty. 
Donna would rather piece squares and 
make a quilt. A lot of people make 
quilts out of remnants of many colors. 
Her mother taught her to use designs. 
She likes a design better than strips. 
She likes a star or a half moon pattern. 
The half moon is an applique quilt. 
Her mother made a quilt called the half 
moon. Half of the points were in one 
direction and half in another. 
Quilting has ceased; you hardly hear of 
anyone making quilts. Mrs. Thompson's 
mother just liked to quilt even if 
the family didn't need quilts.

The quilt. Cne of the oldest patterns 
called the log Cabin. It's put 
together with a small patterned print. 
The top is well coordinated; it came 
from Alabama. Nora is doing the 
quilting for her. She had to add a 
3i inch border. She had the material 
sent from Alabama. It matched the quilt 
very well. It is already sold to 
someone in the north. 
Most all quilts have one corner that is 
wider than the rest. Everyone ends up 
with one long end, but it doesn't show 
after it's quilted. This quilt was 
pieced on the machine. Most people 
these days piece them on the machine. 
They are also appliqued on the machine 
with a zig-zag stitch. You have to use 
a material with a firm body. 
Quilting pattern. The lady she is quilting 
for said the correct way to quilt this 
pattern is by the block. She will quilt 
on the outside edge of each square. 
She hasn't decided which pattern to do 
on the outside edge. She needs to find 
a pattern that will go with the block 
quilting pattern. She makes up her own 
patterns. She sees them in magazines or 
just copies things she has sitting around 
the house. She picked up one design from 
the shape of a bottle. Her grandson had 
cut out a pattern and she used that in 
a quilt. She also gets them from 
Quilt World and Quilters Newsletter. 
Catalogs and pattern books have quilting 
patterns. Iarade sometimes has patterns

too. She has a lot of pattern hooks. 
Thread. She uses white thread even in 
the brown area. The lining is off 
white and the thread matches the lining. 
You always use the color that is the 
back. It doesn't really show on the 
top, but a lot of people like it to 
show. Many people use them on the 
back side too. With the price of a 
good size quilt, you have to use 
both sides. 
Nora doesn't know the cost of this 
quilt. She doesn't put her prices out, 
but Nora guesses they'd be from C:l?5 
$200. She gets paid $40 to quilt and 
hem the quilt. She doesn't charge by 
the yard of thread. When the group 
quilted, they just set a price. Nora 
doesn't charge as much as some because 
she donates her earnings to the church. 
Early life. She married young and has 
3 children. Her son is a microbiologist. 
Her daughter is a college student 
married to a dentist. Her other daughter 
is married to an army man. She likes 
to cook. She finished school after she 
was married and too some college courses. 
Worked in a sewing factory for 1? years. 
After the kids got through college, she 
quit work and decided to take up quilting 
to keep her hands busy. Quilting is 
good therapy for her arthritis. 
She was born in this area in 1930. She 
came from a family of 7 children. She 
carried wood. She remembers working in 
the garden a little bit. Her father was 
a carpenter. Her mother canned every¬ 
thing she could get her hands on. She 
was a thrifty woman. Children made 
their own entertainment with small pieces 
of cloth they were given to sew on. They 
made a lot of their own things to play 
with. 
They made rag dolls. They made their own 
balls to play with. They ravelled the 
string from feed bags, rolled it up, 
and co vered it with material. They 
had chickens to play with. 
Story about one lady during the depression. 
Her father shared feed to feed her 
cattle. Cne Christmas her father caught 
rabbits in a rabbit gum to buy presents. 
Household tasks. They scrubbed the clothes 
on a scrub board. They picked beetles 
from the beans. Kept weeds from the

garden. They helped her can some. 
They helped her gather the food. 
She began cooking as soon as she was 
old enough to stand at the stove. She 
cooked beans, apples, blackberries, 
pies, cake, butter; they had their own 
milk and eggs. It was plain country 
cooking. Very little was bought at 
the store; no one had any money. 
Most people would barter for goods. 
Chicken dumplings. They would have a 
table full of food for Sunday company. 
Cornbread. Story about sending her 
children cornmeal when they were over¬ 
seas. 
283 - 308 She helped her mother quilt at home. 
She wasn't a nice quilter. They were 
more concerned about warmth. They made 
long stitches and crooked seams. The 
quilts were thick. It was hard to turn 
over in bed because they were so heavy. 
They sometimes tacked a new top onto an 
old quilt. They also used a "hidden 
tack," which is one shorter stitch and 
it bonds the two pieces together. People 
used it a lot because it was easier and 
quicker. Tack and cut and tie was 
easier. 
308 - 419 Quilt tops were plain long ago. Her 
mother liked to piece a pretty pattern. 
Her grandmother pieced those I took 
photos of, probably 30 years ago. Her 
mother was a nice seamstress, and her 
grandmother used the pieces for quilts. 
The colors weren’t as good in those 
days. Most of her mother's quilts 
were pieced. lone Star was the favorite. 
She did one for each of the 7 children. 
Flower Garden was another favorite. 
They found many quilts when they went 
through the house after their father 
died; they burned a lot of them. Later 
people told them those quilts were 
worth a lot of money. They have one 
or two quilts that have been in the 
family for 5 or 6 generations. The 
Pineapple Pattern was an old family 
pattern. They have a family history. 
Cne of their family quilts is at the 
Renwick. They made several quilts for 
the Gallery. Eight-pointed Stars. 
Log Cabin. Lone Star. Nine Patch. 
Renwich located them through Mrs. Perry. 
She is a dedicated person. 
^19 - 482 She taught herself how to quilt. Her 
mother started her in quilting. It 
is something you have to pick up on

your own. She was ? or 8 when she 
helped with her first quilt. When 
they started building the Church, 
they started doing a lot of quilting. 
They did it more for entertainment 
than for the quilting; she was an 
entertaining person. She did not do 
much quilting for her family. She 
didn't start until after she quit her 
job. She needed something to fill the 
time and keep her fingers limber. She 
has been quilting actively for seven 
years. She did enough to keep the beds 
warm for the family before that.

1-25 Mrs. Yates is good at getting her colors 
coordinated. It is important to choose 
good colors; hot pinks don’t fit into 
someone's bedroom. Most people like 
brown, greens, red, and yellows. When 
they first started quilting, brown was 
a poor color, now it is popular. The 
colors then were the solt colors. Now 
they use bright colors. Years ago 
people wanted to brighten their lives 
so they used bright colors. Her mother 
said that often the quilt was the bright 
color in the room. They were proud 
of their quilts. 
25 - 62 Small stitches help to sell a quilt. It 
takes a lot of practice and patience 
to make a small stitch. You have to 
use a size 7 or 8 crewel embroidery 
needle is better than a quilting needle. 
English needles don't bend as quickly; 
they don’t last as long but they are 
easier to get through the material, 
and make a smaller stitch. Your needle 
gets hot and bends when you quilt. You 
go through 2 packs of needles in one 
quilt. In a real heavy material, this 
needle might not v/ork well. They use 
soft material, and this needle works 
well. The polyester filling helps to 
get the needle through better than the 
cotton filling. Cotton filling gives 
you blunt, dull ends on your needle. 
82 - 114 Married at 15; she's been married 33 years. 
Her husband was a local boy; they went 
to Church together. Her folks wanted her

to finish school, and she did after 
she was married. They didn’t want 
her to marry that young; they liked 
her husband. She wouldn't want her 
children to get married that young. 
She was a few months pregnant when she 
graduated from high school. After 
her children were older, she attended 
a lot of college classes at the local 
community college. It helped her a 
lot._ She studied psychology, math, 
English, public speaking, accounting, 
typing. 
The Hanes plant opened the year her last 
child was born. They wanted to build 
a new house, and they had had a lot of 
sickness. She went to work to help them 
build two houses. She stopped working 
7 or.8 years ago. At Hanes, she was a 
utility girl; she sewed the sides of 
T-Shirts, bagging, sewed bands on men's 
briefs, and folding. She liked the 
people, not the work. Some of it she 
would not do again. In factory work, ^" 
your.life revolves around a machine, wiy 
Working with.your family, your church, 
makes your life seem more V/holesome. 
Factory work is fine for those who 
enjoy it; she did not. She met some 
of the nicest people there. After 1? 
years she can say that. 
Her children helped her with the household 
tasks. Her husband worked out of town 
and was only home on weekends. Some¬ 
how she found time for activities then. 
She reads a lot. Her husband says she 
reads instead of sleeps. 
Her children helped with the garden and 
canning. She stayed up late and did 
400 or 500 cans of food. She didn't 
do very much quilting when she worked 
at the factory. 
She quilts in the wintertime. They have 
a problem heating the building, so they 
do most of their work in the spring and 
fall. In the winter, it helps to pass 
the days. They make toys and quilt tops 
on.the days they can’t come to the 
building. They do some piecing during 
the winter. 
She quilts in the evening. In the morning 
she has trouble with the arthritis. 
The family thinks her quilting is the 
most wonderful thing in the world. Her 
husband.really likes it. Her children 
want quilts and handmade items for 
presents instead of store bought items.

She doesn't fill her time with 
quilting; she doesn't enjoy it that 
much. Her older daughter is hung up 
on quilts and older things. He likes 
quilting because he knows it is good 
for her, and he is color conscious and 
likes to see something well done. The 
men in this area appreciate the quilts. 
The men come in when they are quilting 
to see the quilts. She doesn't know 
why the men like the quilts. They 
don’t have any men who quilt. She 
has seen pictures of men quilting in 
the Quilters Newspapers. 
The quilts she does herself she gives 
away to family. She does not sell the 
quilts she pieces or quilts herself. 
They sometimes buy a top and quilt it 
to sell. They send their quilts to 
quilt shows and sell them there. They 
sold a few at Rooftop. Sometimes people 
will give them an order. They piece and 
quilt the whole quilt. They have orders 
from a doctor in Winston-Salem. Some 
quilts have gone overseas; they have 
gone.to every state in the United States. 
Nora will be doing very little quilting 
now that her sister is gone. She will 
not be doing quilting as a money-making 
project; she will just do it as therapy. 
She might do one for Mrs. Yates. She 
will do them for the family. 
Her sister, her mother, and Nora used to 
quilt 8 or 10 dozen a year when they 
made them to sell. They have quilted 
100 a year. They probably did that 
two years. Her mother was sick one 
year. For two or three years they didn't 
do_very much. They were really active 
quilters three or four years ago. Some¬ 
times they only did 8 or 10 a year. 
Her mother would bind the quilts. They 
got to be pretty fast at it. They 
quilted mostly for other people. The 
people often had quilt tops they were 
family heirlooms, and they quilted these 
tops for 8 or 10 dollars at first. 
Later they charged up to $40. You have 
to enjoy the work, because you don’t 
make any money. 
Fabrics. Nora likes to use a polyester 
and cotton blend for the quilt top. 
She finds the blend is easier to use 
than just plain cotton; you have better 
stitches because it is softer. She 
pieces only 2 or 3 a year; she does 
a baby quilt usually for the family. 
page 4 
440 - 482 Polyester is a newer fabric. When 
she first started piecing quilts, 
she used cotton feedbags. Her 
family had cows and they had a lot 
of feedbags. They always tried to 
pick a pretty pattern feedbag, and 
she would make her quilts out of 
them. They are very popular today. 
She cut patterns for her quilts. 
At home, she used scraps from material 
too for her quilts. She would buy 
remnants for the quilts. She wasn't 
as color conscious, and used what 
she had. She used a lot of prints 
with prints.

Her mother sewed all their clothes, some 
were made from feedbags. 
She no longer uses used fabrics for the 
quilt tops. She only makes 2 or 3 
quilt tops per year. 
Nora uses polyester filler. It is washabl 
It looks new after being washed in the 
v/ashing machine and dried in the dryer. 
She fills baby quilts with pieces; they 
never wad up like cotton does. 
She washes her quiltsShe puts them in 
cold water and uses Woolite. She may 
put in a half cup of salt to keep the 
colors from running. She has very few 
quilts at her house; she doesn't use 
them. Her children want the ones she 
makes. She has a top her mother pieced 
for her; she has another her grandmother 
pieced. 
She used to use the cotton batting 
She did not like it. It makes your 
needles bend, and it wads up when you 
wash it. They bought their's. They 
bought Mountain Mist or batting in a 
loose bag. Her grandmother wove cover¬ 
lets; she carded wool and probably used 
some in the quilts 
She likes to use a cotton-polyester blend 
for the lining. They have used sheets; 
they come in beautiful colors and don't 
have a seam in them, but they are hard 
to quilt. The close-wovenness of the 
material makes it hard. They use white 
and off-white for the linings. Cne

the quilt over and using the other side, 
tone it down a little. They have used 
cotton flannel for the linings. Some 
people wanted a warmer back if they were 
going to use the quilt for everyday. 
Some people would shrink their flannel 
and use it inside the quilt. It 
wouldn't bunch up in the quilt. 
Cotton filling was a problem because 
it would wad up when it was used in 
the quilt. Many people still like the 
cotton filler: Mrs. Berry says it is the 
old time way of quilting. It is hard 
to quilt and doesn't hold up well. 
Mrs. Berry likes it just because it is 
the old-time way. She tries to keep the 
shop filled with things from yesteryear. 
She won't have plastic in the shop. 
She includes original ideas and stuff 
that local people use and make. 
Applique quilts. At one time that was 
the only kind she made. It takes a 
long time to do them by hand, and 
machine applique quilts do not sell 
well. She does Dutch Boy, Farmer 
Boy, and Dutch Girl on occasion. 
She started on applique quilts. She 
never used kits. She got her patterns 
from quilt books. Tulip and Rose. 
Sunbonnet Girl. Sometimes she did her 
own patterns. Foinsettia. Violets was 
pretty much her own pattern. Strawberry 
quilts were original patterns. They had 
an artist friend drew her own pattern. 
Cne woman asked for quilts to match 
her children's rooms. An interior 
decorator did the house; they were 
honored to do the quilts. They never 
used kits themselves, but they quilted 
other people’s quilts from kits. 
People went back to the pieced quilts and 
gave up the applique. She learned more 
about piecing. Her mother was fabulous 
at it; piecing is an art. You have to 
keep practicing. She could always get 
her corners to meet and the quilt to 
coordinate. 
Nora's sister was working with a craft 
group, and Nora got involved in crafts 
through the group. It was an CEO 
program set up by Nixon and Johnson. 
It wasn't carried out right; it didn't 
have quialified people in it. The 
people didn't understand what craft 
was all about. They had older people; 
young married people; they had people 
from all walks of life, not just the

poor. Some people wanted to supplement 
their income. They had classes in 
quilting, sewing, and doll-making. 
Zenna Todd and Nora's sister taught 
the classes. 
Nora changed her quilting style after 
she became involved in the quilting 
class. Quilts were an important part 
of the Bicentennial. They have never 
quilted a state bird or flower quilt. 
Her quilting changed in that she started 
making smaller stitches. She decided 
that a quilt was not just something to 
keep people warm; it was a thing of 
beauty, and you did your best work. 
She also had more time. You can't 
hurry up on it. You have to try to 
do a good job. Putting colors together 
was another important part of quilting. 
They would go and select fabrics from 
the fabric shops with a grant. They 
matched their colors and looked for the 
quality of material, the fastness of it. 
The quality of the material was most 
important. They didn't want the colors 
to run together. You wanted to get the 
same types of material, not one heavy 
and one light. It needed to be of good 
quality. Quilts are something to be 
handed down for a hundred years. They 
had funds to work with. They shopped 
for small prints and colors that would 
blend. They didn’t want a bold print. 
They tried to balance out colors in 
solids or prints. They shopped for 
fabrics for many quilts at one time. 
They had 20 or 25 working on quilts at 
that time. 
They shopped in Winston-Salem or Mount 
Airy. They would hear of a shop that 
had good fabrics and small prints. 
They tried factory outlets without 
much luck. Not many factories that 
were here had fabrics they could use. 
They sometimes went to Asheville. They 
wouldn't use polyester. Her sister 
and mother bought polyester for them 
to use, but not for a show. The rules 
of the show say thatpolyester cannot 
be used. 
Nora only went to local craft shows. 
Her mother and sister went to many. 
They went to Washington, D.C., Roanoke, 
Greensboro, Georgia, Virginia Beach, 
Connecticutt. She would go with a 
craft group from the state. She was 
a widow and enjoyed the trips.

The group would show and sell her 
quilts. She would get some ideas from 
the work she saw. They were proud of 
their quilts. 
351 - ^12 Setting up the quilt. They have four 
wooden frame, some 120 or 130 inches 
long. They are a 1 by 2 with holes 
drilled in them. She uses tacks to 
put the material in with. She puts 
the frames together and puts the back 
on the frames. Then you lay your 
padding on. Before thay, you have to 
stretch the lining as much as you can. 
Try to get the filling straight and 
pin it in. The lining must be stretched 
or it will get wrinkles in it when it 
is rolled. The top must be stretched 
too. It takes an hour or an hour and 
a half to put one in. It is the 
success of your quilt as much as 
anything. Getting it in the frames 
and keeping it stretched straight is 
important. If you have a loose top, 
you have wrinkles in it when its done. 
412 - 480 They quilted together or sometimes by 
themselves if they had time. Mora only 
quilted with her local Methodist besides 
her own family. They quilted for the 
local Lord's Acre Day. They built a 
new church, $40,000 or $50,000 building, 
with small projects like quilting. She 
quilted with the Church before she 
started working with the family. There 
was a lot of socializing. They laughed 
and talked at the quiltings. They 
tried not to talk about the preacher. 
The quilts helped to pay for the Church. 
They did 6 or 8 a year, and sold them 
at the Lord’s Acre. They did this in 
the late 50's or early 60's.

Nora would not want more than two 
people quilting on a quilt of her's. 
It is rare that two people make the 
same kind of stitches. No two people 
quilt the same. 
Her favorite quilting patterns are 
Double Wedding Ring, Dahlia, and 
Lone Star. In Double Wedding Ring, 
you can use up small scraps. They 
sell fast. She uses different quilting 
patterns for the border and center of 
the Wedding Ring. They did one in two 
colors with a spider quilting pattern. 
They use a flower pattern. They get 
patterns from local craft shops; they 
are stencils. They make their own 
stencils. They sometimes go by the 
old patterns. This one doesn’t have 
a particular pattern to it. They always 
try to do something different. They 
order stencils from the craft books. 
^2 - ioi The Quilter's Newsletter. The Quilt 
Book. Farm magazines have quilt 
patterns. Bookstores have quilt books. 
She hunts for books when they travel. 
Aunt Martha’s Quilting books have the 
truest patterns. The corners fit. 
She has been buying the Newsletter for 
4 or 5 years. They have a lot of older 
quilt patterns. Ruby Henson has quilt 
patterns that she makes. They are in 
Quilter's World and other magazines. 
Nora likes the full-sized patterns 
because she has a hard time enlarging 
the patterns. She uses some patterns

from the magazines. They have both 
traditional and unusual patterns, and 
she uses both. She likes 101 Quilting 
Ideas. She uses it more than any other 
book. It has full-sized patterns. Toy 
patterns and doll patterns are often 
not full-sized either. 
The quilting building. It was built 
many years ago. She didn't want to 
work in the basement of her house. 
They put doors and windows in the 
building; they added a used furnace 
and now it's comfortable room for 
quilting. She likes to see people. 
Quilting is also a messy job to have 
in your house. Her husband also uses 
the basement for storing construction 
items. They will turn it into apart¬ 
ments some day. 
Her husband made the frames. Some came 
from a craft group, but her husband 
made the longer ones. They ripped 
the boards, drilled the holes, and 
sanded them. She has another set at 
that don't swing from the ceiling. 
They are good for baby quilts, but 
not for larger quilts because they 
tip over. A lot of people use them. 
Nora likes the kind that swing from 
the ceiling. You can adjust the 
height. The other is just a standard 
height. Not many rooms in houses are 
able to accomodate the large quilt 
frames. 
Tools. Four nails. Tacks. Straight 
pins. Needles. Quilting thread. 
She is using two different colors of 
thread. She is not using the off 
white on this quilt. Regular scissors. 
Her mother had some special smaller 
scissors used by her grandmother. 
Yardstick. They have a long board 
to draw on the quilting lines that go 
from corner to corner. They use the 
yardstick to draw off the lines too. 
They seldom quilt in the fan. People 
don't like it even if it is one of 
the older quilting patterns. They like 
the quilt done by the piece. They like 
unusual patterns that they have thought 
up themselves. People don't like the 
fan much; they have some at the Roof¬ 
top. They quilted in the fan at the 
Church; it was all they knew. Her 
mother quilted by the fan all the 
time. They used the string and chalk 
to make the fan. They put knots in 
the string to make each line uniform 
page 3 
with the next one. They started in the 
corner and went from there. They later 
made up their own patterns and got some 
from the quilting hooks. They thought 
they would be prettier quilted by the 
piece. They show up on the back. Some 
people do use the back of the quilt. 
Quilted by the piece shows up better 
on the back. Nora has seen people 
who are using quilts as tablecloths. 
They are beautiful. They fill the 
Lone Star pattern in with a solid 
color. They did one Log Cabin for a 
table cloth. They did one old one that 
had been pieced for 50 or 75 years. The 
lady made it into a tablecloth. They 
quilted pillow shams for awhile. They 
matched them to the quilt. Her sister 
has quilted a lot of pillows in the 
old patterns. They make beautiful 
pillows. Nora has done quite a few 
applique pillows and corduroy pillows. 
Corduroy is a good fabric this year. 
27o - 329 Color coordination is important in 
making a quilt attractive. The way 
it is put together is second. The 
quilting is next. The colors in 
this quilt are good. All their colors 
harmonize and are not garish. Most 
quilters coordinate their colors before 
they cut their first piece. Her mother 
did that a lot. Color is what other 
people notice too. The size of the 
quilt is important. They want one 
large enough for the bed, with an over¬ 
hang of at least 10 inches. They 
notice the quilting. Many people don't 
notice the quilting as much as the 
color. They are more conscious of the 
quilting than they were 5 years ago. 
Some people are not sophistocated. 
People want something that will last 
and that people will notice. 
329 - 3^8 Small stitches. Some older stitches were 
very nice. In Pennsylvania the stitches 
are just perfect; they have quilted for 
50 or 75 years. Some people here did 
quilting for the warmth of the quilt. 
Tacking was more popular because it 
was quicker and easier and people were 
limited for space. They had to do the 
quilt in one day. Some people tried 
to make pretty quilts then, but more 
people try to make them pretty now. 
It was whether they had an artistic 
taste as much as anything else.

Nora is glad people can't see the first 
quilts she made. The quilts are nicer 
now; the materials are nicer; the 
filling is easier to work with and makes 
a nicer quilt. The quality is much 
better. People are prouder of their 
quilts. 
A quality quilter. Some people could 
quilt for the rest of their lives and 
never make nice quilts. Some people 
are gifted. It is like a musical 
talent. If you want to make nicer 
stitches, you can make nicer quilts. 
She did a lot of ripping out of her 
colors and stitches. She worked in 
a factory for 1? years, and she had 
to do quality work there in order to 
pass inspection. It was easier to do 
it right the first time. She has a 
son who is a perfectionist; in fact, 
they are all perfectionists in their 
own way. Her daughter is a perfectionist 
and careful about the housecleaning. 
Her husband does concrete work and so 
does her son. Each person is qualified 
for something in this world. 
There should be 10 to 11 stitches to an 
inch in a quilt. She has 12 in her's. 
That may be a national standard. You 
can get by with 8 per inch.

Background. Married in 1934 and has three 
boys. She started quilting when she 
was 25. She didn't do the fancy 
quilting. They didn't have too much to 
do with. They sewed them up however 
the pieces came. Crazy quilt. Later 
they cut out by pattern and could 
afford to buy material. Story about 
the first quilt she cut out by pattern. 
Monkey Wrench. The lining was a rose 
color; her mother-in-law said to use 
black thread. "She didn’t tell me to 
pull the knots through the lining." 
The black knots showed on the under¬ 
neath side. "It looked like flies 
a-settin on the quilt." My goodness, 
"why didn't you pull them through." 
From then on, she has really made 
progress. She has been quilting for 
32 years. 'She has made a lot to sell; 
it is a pastime in the winter. 
She first made quilts to keep the beds 
warm. Her quilts are all handmade even 
though she has a sewing machine. They 
needed a lot of quilts in the winter¬ 
time. You had to do them in a hurry. 
She kept her first quilt until a few 
years a go and recovered it. It was 
mostly feedbags. A real good quilt 
would last 100 years. She has another 
she has recovered. She should have 
have kept that old quilt because she 
got such a laugh out of all those 
knots on it.

The early crazy quilts. Zenna used an 
old bed linen sheet to sew the pieces 
on. This was the crazy quilt. They 
had different ways to put it together. 
Some went from corner to corner; some 
used dark and light. They tore the 
blocks 8" by 8'' or 6" by 6" and put 
a 2" strip inbetween them. It made 
them pretty and it kept you warm. 
Filler. Cotton batting. Zenna made 
one or two with wool from the sheep. 
Her mother-in-law would get the wool 
and make 3 by 6 inch bats. It made one 
of the softest and warmest quilts. There 
was a lot of work in it, but people had 
more time than money. She has used 
blankets as filler. They didn’t have 
good filling for quilts until 1950. 
Polyester and cotton makes a good 
filler. Zenna likes a lightweight 
quilt. She likes to use quilts more 
than blankets; they have less lint. 
lining. Cotton feedbags. They made 
a real good, soft quilt. later she 
used unbleached muslin. 
Quilting. The first one she quilted in 
the fan. She had to make 5 circles. 
She had tacked them. Her mother-in- 
law used a pencil tied to a string. 
Now she quilts with "Better patterns," 
patterns that you buy. Some people 
still like the fan. Zenna quilted for 
Mrs. Yates and she said, "for goodness 
sake, don't do any in the fan." She 
doesn't like that. They quilted them 
by the piece. If there is too much 
filling in in the border, you have to 
get a pattern to do it. She didn't 
want a fan pattern. Zenna also did 
a pattern with a yardstick diagonal 
across the quilt. She would put three 
together and skip a space. Sometimes 
she would check it. She has done this 
for a long time; she did it on the 
early crazy quilts she made. She 
just "thought that up." You have 
to use your imagination to quilt. The 
older people didn't do the fancy 
quilting. They did the fan and the 
inch strip diagonal. They just used 
them for the warmth. Now people use 
them for bedspreads. 
Fancy quilt. One pieced by a pattern and >|£ 
quilted around each piece on each side 
of the seam. It is put together with 
a solid block with pretty quilting. 
It has a border.

252 Ordinary quilt. Quilt to keep the bed J 
warm. Zenna has made "them in a 'I 
hurry." The kids soon "kick the quilts 
out." They need to be washed more. 
Feopledidn't have warm houses, and they 
had 4 or 5 quilts on the bed. Story 
about her growing up; "we had so many 
quilts on us, we couldn't hardly turn 
over." You had to to keep warm. It 
took a lot of quilts. It is hard on 
them to launder them because they are 
so heavy. Now people realize that if 
they make them lighter, they'll last 
longer. Her's last better now than 
they used to. 
287 Washing the quilt. She uses her wringer 
washing machine. She tries to use a 
mild detergent and doesn't wash it too 
long. The quilt must be quilted close 
enough so the cotton won't knot up. 
Today's filler won’t knot up. She used 
to wash them by hand. They would soak 
them in a tub of water; they were hard 
to rub them. Not many people washed 
them back then. She learned to have 
lighter quilts because you can take 
care of them more easily. She would 
prefer two light quilts on a bed rather 
than one heavy quilt. 
329 Making a lightweight quilt. The crazy 
quilt only needed a very thin sheet 
blanket as a filler. If you use the 
batting, it weighed 3 pounds; the 
top weighed If pounds, and the lining 
If pounds. That's a lot of weight. 
Now the mountain mist blend is only 
one pound. It is easier to launder. 
The heavier it is, the harder it is 
on the quilt to launder. She only 
uses one quilt now; she used to use 
4 quilts. Snow would be on the floor 
of the bedroom. Her father always had 
a fire going and they got dressed by 
the fire. 
Grew up in Allegany County, a couple of 
miles from here. Born in 1916. Early 
life. They had a lot of cold winters. 
She walked two miles to school. She 
had to leave home to finish the ninth 
grade. She had to board in lowgap. 
Her father was married twice. They 
had three girls; his new wife was 15. 
She is one of 15 children. He never 
worked on a job in his life; they 
farmed. Zenna helped raise the other 
children. They had an apple orchard. 
Each one knew what he had to do. They

had to carry water a quarter of a mile. 
They hoed corn all day long. He plowed 
the corn with steers; they'd just get 
through the 6 acres and they'd have to 
start over again. They didn't have 
the leisure time. Children today have 
too much leisure time. 
Games. When the n eighhors came, they 
would really play. Hide and Go Seek. 
They would go to the mountains and 
swing on the grape vines and climb rocks. 
Checkerboard. They had a board they 
played with red corn and white corn. 
They didn't have a lot of toys. 
4?0 Cooking. She knew how to do anything 
you named when she got married. 
Canning. They dried a lot of stuff. 
Apples. Pumpkin. Sweet potatoes. 
Green Beans. They canned berries. 
Pickling. Her father built 12 to 15 
dryers about 30" square.

Drying food. They had to bring them in 
every night. They had to stack them 
back on the two poles the next morning. 
They didn't know how to can pumpkin 
at the time. Her father said that 
his mother dried berries. They didn't 
have jars to can in. 
Dryer. Two forked poles were 15 feet 
long. He built it long enough to take 
care of the dryers. They dried in the 
sun. They sometimes had 200 pound bags 
of apples and 100 pound bags of leather 
britches. 
Storage. They would stay up in the night 
and slice apples. They would dry in a 
couple of days. They just put them in 
white chop bags and put them upstairs. 
They made molasses stack cake. It is 
delicious. They made their own 
molasses and buckwheat. Recipe for 
molasses stack cake. They rolled it 
very thin, put apples inbetween 6 or 
7 of them. They let it set a day or 
night. That was all the cake they had. 
They had plenty of molasses. They 
made molasses or gingerbread cookies. 
Apple butter. Peach butter. Grape 
butter. They didn't go to the store. 
Pickles. Pickle Beans. They made a 
10 gallon barrel. Kraut. They put 
the beans in a wooden barrel with water 
and salt; they had to be weighted down. 
She never made that many after she was 
married. Her father put a wooden lid and

clean rock on top of the beans. They 
would push up. They enjoyed it 
They never made hominy. People said 
her mother made the best hominy. No 
one in the family learned how to do it. 
Quilting at home. They tacked quilts at 
home. They put them in the frames and 
tacked them. She didn't learn how to 
quilt until after she got married. She 
taught Zenna how to use patterns. 
Monkey Wrench was the first quilt she 
made by pattern. She thought they were 
prettier. She didn't do all of them by 
pattern. She didn't have a lot of 
scraps. She would piece one up by 
pattern and then use the other pieces 
in a crazy quilt. She quilted and tacked 
the crazy quilt. Zenna doesn't like a 
tacked quilt so she tacked them real 
close. A tacked quilt doesn’t last as 
long. It doesn't hold up as good. A 
quilted quilt will hold up. It will last 
more than 50 years. The more sewing you 
put in it ithe better it is. 
She did the pieced quilting and fancy 
quilting after she was married in 193^* 
She tacked the first quilts she made. 
Her mother-in-law shov/ed her how to do 
her first quilt in 1936 and 1937* She 
doesn’t call tacking quilts quilting. 
She was married at 18 
Zenna met her husband because they lived 
near one another. Her sister married his 
brother. They were married in the 
preacher's home in Galax. The depression 
was getting over when they were married. 
It was a hard go in those days. People 
today wouldn’t know how to cope with 15 
children. When she got married, she 
was ready to throw her hands up several 
times. 
The Depression. She worked at Mt. Airy. 
Things had begun to pick up then. She 
lived with her uncle and did housekeeping. 
Conditions were worse here. Close to 
town you could get a bit of work. The 
men worked at the sawmill. Her husband 
got a job on the Parkway in 1937* He 
worked near Doughton Park; he did 
masonry work. He drove a truck for the 
employees. This was his first job after 
they were married. It began to pick up 
in 1937. 1938. People didn’t go 
hungry, but they could have used more. 
People in the country had a hard time. 
If you don't have anything, it is hard 
to live in the country. They didn't

have plenty. If you had land in the 
country, you could create what you 
needed. 
Her.father had been married for a long 
time and he had accumulated something. 
Still it was hard for him too. Story 
about selling the heifers for $16.50 
each to pay his taxes. They all knew 
their job. They didn't complain. 
In 1938 people began to get work especially 
on the Parkway. It is close to her 
home. It had a good impact on people 
close to it. Zenna likes the Parkway. 
She feels most people do. She loves 
to ride on it. It's not too much 
benefit for people to haul things on. 
They bought this place in 1944 and part 
of their land joined the Parkway. They 
sold the lower end that joined the 
Parkway to another person. Zenna uses 
it to.drive to Galax or Sparta. In 
the winter, she can't travel it. 
She started quilting in 1937 when times 
began to get better. When she got 
married, she had to get quilts in a 
hurry. She started with the quilting 
when she had more time. Her mother- 
in-law is 90 and still pieces quilts. 
They just let her fool with the quilts 
and do what she wants too. At first they 
fussed at her because it made such a 
mess in the house. Zenna told them to 
let her do what she wants. She’s not 
the.best in the world, but she keeps 
at it. She doesn’t get her patterns 
true; she doesn’t put them together 
well. She keeps doing the older 
patterns. Quilting has advanced a lot. 
People have learned quite a bit. She 
has.stayed the same; she is behind a bit. 
Quilting has advanced. More people want 
to get into it. People like herself 
have learned a lot. She has gotten 
better. She learned by doing it. She 
learned to crochet and knit too after 
she was married. She didn’t take classes 
or ready magazines. She bought a book 
to learn to crochet. She followed the 
directions. That is better than looking 
at something. In quilting you have to 
have a true pattern to start with. When 
it gets worn, make a new pattern and 
have it true. Then your pieces will all 
fit together. If you let one side of 
your pattern be off, the quilt will have 
a long end. That is one of the main 
things to remember in quilting. 
Gt-^-ioo

If each piece is true, the pattern 
will come out perfect. 
428 - 470 Zenna taught a quilting class in 1972. 
She worked through a community college 
in North Wilkesboro. She had to have 
12 or 15 women in a class. She had 
a couple classes. They ran it as a 
sewing and quilting class. Many people 
wouldn’t have anything to do with 
quilting. They found her through the 
Blue Ridge Opportunity Commission. It 
is for low income people. Zenna 
thought it was a wonderful thing.

Quilting helps supplement her income. 
She likes to quilt and teach quilting. 
Time of year for quilting. She starts 
after Christmas. She can finish quilting 
a quilt in a week. She puts another one 
in the frames right away, but she 
doesn't quilt it right away. She gives 
herself a few days rest. Last year 
she quilted four and pieced two. She 
would put 8 or 9 hours in on them. 
She sells most of the quilts she makes. 
If she has one in the shop that doesn't 
sell, she gives it to her grandchildren. 
She has 4 or 5 quilts in various shops 
now. 
Story about making a quilted wall-hanging 
about 40 by 40. She put a log cabin 
and George Washington on it. She put 
red and blue stars in the corners and 
strips around the edge. She put 1776 and 
1976 on the quilt and quilted it 
diagonally. She appliqued an eagle on 
another one for Roaring Gap. She just 
wanted to fix something unusual for the 
Bicentennial. 
She sells her quilts Rooftop and the 
Trading Post. That helps out with her 
income. The price varies according to 
the size, pattern, and quilting. The 
standard size she charges $125 to $130 
for. The Double Wedding Ring brings 
$150. 
The easier patterns. Monkey Wrench.

Star quilt. Pinwheel. The Double 
Wedding Ring has little pieces and 
four corners with rings to fit together. 
Orders. Most of the time she makes them 
and puts them in a shop. Sometimes she 
gets orders. It takes many hours to 
make a quilt, but its better to use 
your time, to keep your mind occupied. 
She doesn't know how many hours she 
puts into a quilt. You sure wouldn't 
make much an hour, but Zenna loves to 
do it. 
Difficult patterns. Bear Faw. Turkey 
Track. None are too hard for her to 
do. She did a Sunburst once. It was 
the "most prettiest thing." She got 
her colors together good. 
Popular colors. You have to coordinate 
your colors. Earth tones. Dark reds. 
Browns. Burnt Grange. When you get 
your colors together, you've got your 
quilt made. That is the hardest part. 
It has taken her all day to work the 
colors out. What you think would work 
with any room color. 
Buying fabrics. She tries to get her 
fabrics on sale. She'll buy fabrics 
that she thinks will blend together. 
Sometimes she has to buy extra fabrics 
to match those she already has. You 
have to use a lot of imagination. 
Prints. She buys the little calico prints. 
They look better. She tries to get the 
smallestprints she can get. She mixes 
solids and prints. She tries to blend 
the colors of the solids and the prints. 
Remnants and factory outlets. She bought 
cutaways at one time. They won't let 
her have it; they take it to the dump. 
The cheaper you get your material, the 
less you have in your quilt. She has 
paid $2.49 for material for her quilt. 
You can't do that. The filling is 
expensive. You have to plan ahead. 
The toughest problem now is getting 
unbleached muslin; what they sell now 
is too lightweight. It is too thin 
for lining. They're making a new kind 
now with some synthetic fibers in it, and 
it's hard to quilt through. You have to 
be careful what you quilt with or you 
can't do a good job. 
She prefers ail cotton for the tops of 
her quilts. She has only done one 
or two quilts from polyester; the 
shops don't like polyester. Poly¬ 
ester will give a bit. Cotton doesn’t. 
\ 
page 3 
G r-f-lt)' 
Craft shops won't take polyester 
quilts at all. She has seen a few 
at the Trading Post, but not at 
Rooftop. She likes to put her stuff 
in those shops because it will look 
nice. She wants it to stay clean 
and nice in the shop. The neater 
your work it, the better it sells. 
The Trading Post has given people 
something to look forward to. They 
have a good woodcarver. People in 
the mountains have grown up learning 
to do something with their hands. 
People want to sell their crafts. 
The canes are made from Sourwood. 
The people who made the crafts are 
named. Mrs. Berry told Zenna to 
embroider her name and date on the 
quilt. Some people don't want you 
to identify yourself. Zenna now 
puts her name and the date on each 
quilt she makes. 
291 - 320 She uses cotton for the top and blend 
for the filling. She uses Mountain 
Mist, which is all cotton, for the 
filler sometimes. She uses unbleached 
muslin. She tries to use cotton all 
the way through. She has always used 
muslin for the linings; it is one of 
the oldest types of fabrics. Her 
first quilting was done out of feed- 
bags which were made out of unbleached 
muslin. She uses white sheets on 
occasion for the back if she has set 
the quilt up in white. She usually 
uses unbleached muslin for all the 
quilt. 
320 - 354 Thread. She uses 40 or 50 spool of 
thread. She pieces them on the 
machine and quilts them by finger. 
She doesn't like the quilting thread5 
it's stiff and looks ugly. She can 
do a better job with cotton mercerized 
thread. She uses a color to blend 
in with the top and the lining. She 
had a quilt that had a dark top and 
unbleached muslin lining. She used 
white thread on it. If you make tiny 
stitches, it doesn't show up. 
354 - 405 She used black thread on her first 
quilt. The thread was coarse and she 
made big stitches. That was the 
fashion then. Her mother-in-law 
raved about her quilt. She didn't 
say anything about the stitches; it 
was the knots she disliked. She 
had bought balls of thread for the 
* )

quilt. They sold 2 for a nickel. 
Two halls would do the quilt. She 
used black on the rusty-rose top. 
The knots looked awful; she didn't 
mention the stitches. She didn't 
use the black thread herself later 
on. 
.Changes in her quilting. She used 
different thread. She wanted to 
quilt and piece by a pattern. She 
wanted to "step up a little." 
She matches the thread to the top or 
the lining. She uses unbleached 
muslin and white thread. A dark 
top doesn’t matter. 
Favorite pieced patterns. Double 
Wedding Ring is hard to do, but 
she likes it. You have to concentrate 
on it while you're piecing it. She 
often pieces several quilts at one 
time. If you quit doing the Double 
Ring, and come back to it, you're 
lost. She just does the Wedding 
Rings and doesn’t do anything else 
until they're done. She cuts all 
day long for one day, and the next 
day she sews all day long. She 
cuts one quilt in one day and sews 
it the next day. She doen't cut a 
few and sew a few.

1-9 How she cuts a quilt. She starts 
with the little pieces. She used 
to know how much it took for each 
quilt. She has been away from it 
for awhile, and now doesn't remember 
how many pieces the quilt will take. 
9-31 Nine-Patch quilt. It takes 3 inch 
squares; they can be as big as you 
want. You can "strip it," or put 
strips inbetween the nine patch. 
She saw one where they had used a 
solid square with fancy quilting. 
Usually they did the nine patch and 
the stripping. If the nine patch was 
printed material, you used a solid 
2^ inch strip. If it's done with 
solids, you use the print. It takes 
a lot of imagination to make a quilt. 
Getting ready for it is the hardest 
thing. 
31 - 186 Applique quilts. She has made the 
Dutch Girl. She has never made an 
applique from a kit. It was nice; 
the craft shops want you to create 
your own quilt. It is better to use 
your own imagination. You can change 
a quilt if you use your imagination; 
the craft shops like that. The Craft 
Shop wanted her to create her own 
pattern; she never did. She didn't 
want to concentrate on it that much. 
She doesn't mind changing patterns, 
but she can't make them up. The Craft 
Shop people said that was really "craft" 
when you made up your own patterns.

Mrs. Yates, The Rooftop, and the Trading 
Post told her that. You don't need 
to let everybody have your patterns. 
She has a swan pattern that she crochets; 
she made one for Mrs. Eerry. Zenna 
said she couldn't get the thread. Mrs. 
Berry wanted the pattern so another lady 
could make them too. Zenna wouldn't 
let her have the pattern. It is good 
to have something unique. 
People have tried to copy her tulip pattern, 
but they haven't been able to do it. She 
copied it from a magazine. She has never 
made a quilt from the pattern; she has 
made several pillows. It is an applique 
pattern, a bit complicated, and she 
quilts on it too. 
She gets her patterns out of magazines, 
especially i4uilt World. She also has 
a lot of hand-me-downs that have been 
handed down from generation to generation. 
The Dutch Girl, Monkey Wrench, The Fan 
are all old patterns. You get patterns 
from neighbors when you visit them and 
see a pattern. She draws them on sand¬ 
paper. If you have a lot of pieces to 
cut, you'll need at least two patterns 
before you get the top cut out. 
She lays her material on the floor and 
lays the pattern on the back side. She 
marks it with a pencil or pen. When she 
lays her quilts off with a hard lead 
pencil. The mark disappears after a 
little use. 
Setting up the quilting frames. She uses 
the bedroom and suspends the frames from 
the ceiling. She has to move things out 
of her bedroom. She quilts three or 
four tops at a time. She hates to set 
up the frames in her house. She could 
set it up upstairs or in her building, 
but it is not handy. When she gets 
through, she rolls it up so she can 
walk under it. She has ropes and rolls 
it up to within 6 inches of the ceiling. 
She has to move out a dresser or a 
stand. It makes it kind of tight to 
quilt. 
She had her quilting frames made. They 
are 2f by 2f each way. Her husband 
put the holes in them. She has the 
lining 4 inches bigger than the top. 
She tacks it in, put the filling in, 
and stretches the top as tight as she 
can and pins it. She pins it close, 
about 2^ inches apart.

Group quilting. She quilted at Union 
Grove with a group. It was very 
interesting; she went a couple of 
days. Some Wilkes County women has 
pieced the Double Wedding Ring quilt. 
Taught quilting in 19?1 or 1972. Group 
quilting is good if you can get 
enough people interested. Many people 
need the room to quilt. No two people 
quilt alike. You can tell when a new 
person comes in. It is fun to quilt 
with a group; they talk, laugh, and 
make mistakes. They bring their own 
food. They had a good time. Most 
of the time its elderly people. Young 
people need to learn how to quilt. 
Story about Nora Virginia's sister and 
Zenna trying to sell their crafts at 
Yatkinville. One woman said her mother 
should do something like this. Since 
her mother quilt work, she just walks 
the floor and worries herself to death. 
Even if they don't sell it, they can 
give it away. 
Some younger people are learning to quilt. 
They don’t take it up because it is not 
easy. You have to like it and hang in 
there and do it. Story about a lady 
who has been going to class and all she 
has is a pillow. The lady bought some 
quilts from Zenna. It takes a lot of 
time and patience. 
The colors make a quilt pretty. The work 
is important; 8 or 10 stitches to the 
inch. It needs to be pieced good. It 
must be neat and clean and the colors 
need to blend together. 
Pretty colors. Wine and rust and gold. 
Shades of green. A little print should 
coordinate with the colors. 
Finishing off the quilt. She trims the 
quilt first after she spreads it on the 
bed. She stitches it close to the edge 
on the sewing machine. If she uses 
unbleached muslin, she cuts a piece of 
bias to bind it. She finishes it with 
her fingers on the top. She tries to 
make it a small binding. If she makes 
if for herself she hems the lining up 
over the top. 
Differences between fancy and plain quilts. 
A quilt for your own use, you won't do 
a lot of fancy things for. To put a 
quilt in the shop, they have to be done 
right. Zenna wants to do one to use

right; she quilt it close, plan colors 
carefully. Some shades of blue or green 
sell better in the shops than the pink. 
She made a lone Star quilt in red that 
sold quickly. Certain colors can bring 
out all the rest. 
She plans to do the Double Wedding Ring 
for herself or an applique quilt of the 
Tulip. She wants to hook a rug to match 
it. She has a lot of pieces to use in 
a quilt; she wants to get rid of the 
pieces. She hooks rugs. She sells 
everything she makes. She sold some 
through Mrs. Berry's shop. She used 
a burlap bag, v/ashed it and startched 
it. She draws her own patterns. This 
one was a quilt pattern. She had to 
concentrate on it

1-35 Maggie learned to quilt by using her 
mother’s scraps. She used old dresses 
and feed sacks for quilts. Many of 
her quilts were pieced out of feed 
sacks. Her mother has pieced thousands 
of quilts and quilted for the neighbors. 
Each member of the family has a quilt 
made by her mother. Every year she 
pieced and quilted quilts for 7 
children, 14, grandchildren, and 4 
great-grandchildren. She has quilts 
in many states. They gave many of 
them away and sold some. Her mother 
sold them for $15 each. Maggie has 
many quilt tops; she never knew how 
valuable they would be. 
35 - 58 She took some to a flea market; she 
sold them for $35 to $50 for the 
tops to women who wanted to quilt them. 
She realized the quilt tops were worth 
something two or three years ago; the 
home demonstration club discussed the 
value of quilts. She had no idea she 
had a fortune in her closet; she has 
squares for about 50 quilt tops in 
her closet. She has 12 or 15 quilts 
she uses all the time on her beds. 
Her mother pieces them out of small 
pieces; she would piece people a set 
for the scraps. They would give her 
the pieces and she would piece one for 
herself and one for them. Then she 
got wise.

Her mother has quilted all of her 
life. Her parents died when she 
was 15 or 16. The family was 
separated; the ladies she stayed 
with quilted all the time and that 
is how she learned to quilt. They 
used linsey (Maggie doesn't know 
what that is) for the tops. 
She got her patterns from these ladies. 
She used to piece a crazy quilt. She 
would use old cloth or paper to piece 
the quilt. She would tear the paper 
off the back when she was finished, 
and pad and quilt it. The first one 
her mother did was a crazy quilt and 
later a star. They pieced the strings 
on the diamonds. Later she found 
pictures in magazine and drew them 
off for quilt patterns. Maggie has 
drawn off quilt patterns for her. 
Over the years neighbors shared 
patterns too. 
The first quilts her mother made were 
strip quilts. Then she found patterns 
and made pieced quilts. Progressive 
Parmer and magazines had just the 
pictures of quilt patterns; they had 
to draw them themselves. How magazinea 
have the patterns too. Maggie is 
buying some of these books and 
magazines to try to name these quilt 
patterns. She didn't find too many 
of her mother's patterns in the 
magazines. She found a log cabin; 
that is the next one she'll piece. 
You can use your strings. She did 
piece the Mariner's Wheel. She has 
some of her mother's patterns where 
she quilted one square. Maggie is 
going to put the squares together 
into one quilt. The Log Cabin. 
This was one of the oldest patterns 
her mother had. 
Maggie was born in 1915 not too far from 
here. She is one of seven children. 
She graduated from Hillsville High 
School. She wanted to go to college, 
but they were too poor. At 58, she 
started back to school. She almost 
has a 2 year degree, but she has 
credits toward the third year of 
college. She worked as a teacher's 
aide until her mother got sick. She 
worked with retarded children. She 
enjoyed it.

Slie milked the cows, churned the 
butter and printed the butter. She 
did all the faun chores: hoed 
corn, made garden, canned. Each 
year they canned 1,000 cans worth 
of food. They packed apples in 
newspapers and stored them in barrels. 
She cooked and did all the things her 
mother did. They ground the coffee. 
It was enjoyable. She only had 3 
children and it seems different 
coming from a large family. 
She was 12 or 13 when she made her first 
quilt. She helped her mother quilt 
when she was a teenager. All the 
family would get around the quilting 
frames; they had to be careful about 
their stitches or her mother would 
pull them out. Her mother's later 
quilts were not as neat. In her 
first quilts the stitches were tiny, 
no knots showed, and everything was 
pretty. She made her first dress 
when she was 18; they cut their 
patterns from newspapers. She still 
makes her clothes. 
Her first quilt was made like the Lone 
Star. They would take large diamonds 
and they would sew strips of cloth 
across the pattern. The pattern was 
paper. They sewed the pieces diagonally. 
She made sure they knotted them care¬ 
fully and then trimmed the excess cloth 
away. She sewed it together to make 
a big star. It was every color. 
They were all under an inch. If 
they were bigger than an inch, they 
didn't get them. The children put 
the tiny pieces together. All the 
piecing was done by hand. Maggie 
has sewed her's on the sewing machine. 
All of her mother's quilts are hand 
pieced. 
She also made paper patterns out of 
squares. She would sew the larger 
squares together to make the quilt. 
It was sewed down in whatever piece 
it came in. They probably used 
catalogs more than anything else for 
their patterns; they only subscribed 
to one newspaper. That never made 
enough. They probably used Sears, 
Montgomery Wards, and others. 
Her mother also used worn out sheets 
for the pattern. Most of the time 
worn out sheets were used for a dish 
page 4

towel, so patterns came from paper. 
Filler. Her mother used old blankets 
or cotton filler. The backing was 
made from feedsacks. She sometimes 
bought material: gingham or cambric. 
Once she sewed a quilt backing out 
of Prince Albert smoking tobacco 
bags. They were 5 " long. She 
washed them and used them as the 
lining. It was a lot of sewing. 
She was a hard working woman. She 
is 95 now. 
Thread. She knit the boy's socks. 
She -would ravel old stockings and 
pull the ravellings off the edge 
of old material. The tops of the 
socks were made out of better 
material. She made the balls out of 
the sock tops. Later people would 
bring her the remnants of the cones. 
She wound it up in balls. The stars 
and stripes is pieced with this kind 
of thread. Maggie has enough thread 
to quilt the tops with. She never 
bought thread to do her quilts. At 
times she would buy thread to quilt 
with. She used a heavy thread, No. 
8, to quilt with. In later years she 
used the finer polyester thread. 
The other thread she used to piece 
the quilt; she bought the thread to 
quilt with. 
Colors. She used whatever she could 
find. Some of her old quilts are 
quilted in black thread. Sometimes 
she chose her thread to match the 
lining. Maggie chooses hen's to 
match the top of her quilt. Most 
of her linings are a solid color, 
and if she quilts with the pattern 
it shows up. She likes the back' 
be as pretty as the top. She didn't 
like the way the stitching showed 
up on her backings. She used unbleached 
muslin for some of her linings and 
a dark top; the white thr ead showed 
up on the top. 
Her mother quilted in the fan when she 
was younger. She did not do fancy 
quilting; most was diagonal because 
it was easier to quilt. It was 
easier to reach the diagonal line. 
Most of Maggie's quilts are quilted 
by the pattern instead of the fan 
or the diagonal. It shows up 
prettier on the lining. She has 
never done the fancy scrolls. 
6r^ -HIC>3 
She has done quite a few by the fan, 
but she is getting away from it. She 
will use it if she has a big pattern 
and can't quilt it by the piece. She 
thinks the fan is prettier than the 
diagonal. They use polyester for the 
padding, and quilting by the piece 
shows up the pattern better. She 
never thought about her reasons for 
doing it; she just did it. 
Her mother drew off the diagonals with 
a yardstick and chalk. Sometimes 
she would use a string and fasten 
it to one corner of the quilt. The 
string was chalked, and she would 
pop it so it left a mark on the quilt. 
She drew the fans with a string and 
a piece of chalk. She drew her lines 
an inch apart. She started from the 
corner each time. 
Her mother's favorite patterns. She 
liked to do something different. 
She seemed to like star patterns. 
She did not do too many Lone Stars; 
most have a star somewhere in the 
block. She liked the Nine of 
Diamonds^ they were nine blocks of 
two different colors. Some she 
would make a full quilt from just 
the blocks; others she would join 
with a strip of fabric between the 
squares. It makes a pattern all over 
the bed to join the squares.

She begins to quilt about this time 
of year. Maggie doesn't quilt much 
because she doesn't have room to 
quilt. She pieces them only because 
she likes the big quilts and she 
can't piece them. She likes the 
old time quilting frames. Her 
brother-in-law made her a set of 
frames just like her mother had. 
Old time frames. The new frames are 
held up on a center bar. The old. 
time frames had to be set on a chair 
or suspended from a hook in the 
ceiling. Her frames are set on the 
backs of chairs. Her sister quilts 
on her lap. Maggie doesn't like 
to do it that way, she likes to 
do things like her mother did. 
It is harder for her do quilt on her 
lap* 
She has only quilted one quilt in this 
house. When she quilted in the 
other house was when her children were 
small. She could get a quilt out in 
a day, she started at 5:00 a.m. and 
had it out before he got.home in the 
evening. She could hem it and get 
it ready the next day. She would have 
it all ready to put in the frame that 
morning. She put the quilts in her¬ 
self. She would quilt all day. She 
made quite a few quilts then; in the 
last 15 years, she hasn't made many. 
She went to work and didn't have time

to quilt. Since she is staying with 
her mother, she doesn’t have the time. 
They are quilting at her mother's 
house now and have it half finished. 
When she quilted them in a day, she was 
making them just to use. She never 
sold any until the past years. Her 
mother gave her quilts away, and she 
hardly had enough to cover her own 
beds. They put an electric blanket 
on her bed. Maggie just quilted for 
her own family and her own use. 
Maggie now gives her quilts to the 
children. If she sells one, it is just 
the top. Later on she plans to put 
all the pieces together and she will 
quilt them. She quilted some quilts 
in her kitchen; they could fit in 
two quilts and the church groups 
would quilt them in one day. 
Quilting groups. She used to quilt 
a lot with her church group; they 
don't do much of that now. They 
quilted in a group 15 or 16 years ago. 
Maggie sells the quilt tops at flea 
markets or to her neighbors. Story 
about one woman who bought a top and 
is having it quilted. She quilts the 
ones she gives to her family. The 
Cathedral Window quilt is for a 
Christmas present. She did two for 
one year. She started just to have 
something to do. She was making rag 
dolls for a craft shop in Winston- 
Salem. Her sister was making a 
Cathedral Window quilt. Maggie 
finally tried one; they bring pretty 
good prices for retired people. She 
would have sold it, but her son said 
he wanted it. Now she has three 
Cathedral Windows for her children. 
Someone always wants quilts. She could 
sell them at a craft shop. 
Fabrics for tops. Maggie prefers good 
cotton. Her mother used polyester, 
but Maggie doesn't like it. She thinks 
the quilts aren't as pretty and the 
patterns are harder to do. She just 
uses new fabrics. Her mother used 
the good parts of old fabrics and 
padded the quilts with old clothes, 
blankets, or sheets. Maggie uses 
Mountain Mist or polyester padding. 
She likes the polyester padding because 
it is soft and fluffy and washes well. 
Maggie doesn't like to use polyester 
page 3 
pieces for her tops. She has seen 
beautiful quilts made from polyester, 
but she just doesn't care about using 
it. She does like the polyester filler. 
She has some of the cotton filler that 
she bought for her mother 12 years ago. 
She hasn't used it; she bought polyester 
for the quilt she is making now. She 
will use it eventually because it was 
only $2 for a quilt; now it is S3 or 
S4- in price. 
160 - 185 She bought all new fabric for the Bi¬ 
centennial quilt. Most of the time 
friends give her scraps that are new. 
If you can coordinate your colors, that 
is okay. She orders cutaways from 
factories. She gets a lot of pieces 
that are alike from that; you can 
specify dark or light colors according 
to what you need. They send what you've 
ordered. Cotton is expensive. She 
gets the fabrics from Arcadia, S.C. 
She found it in a quilt magazine. 
185 - 200 Maggie uses muslin for the lining. On 
the Stars and Stripes she matched the 
lining to the quilt top. It is a 
polyester and cotton fabric from Sears. 
It is easier to order it from a catalog. 
She would rather pick out her fabrics, 
but she doesn't have time. Until 3 
or 4 years ago, she did sewing for 
others and got a lot of scraps that 
way. 
200 - 243 She doesn't know how many she makes a 
year. She has made quite a few. She 
will piece 2 or 3 a year. When the 
children were small, she made 5 or 6 
per year because they wore out quickly. 
Her mother has probably made a thousand 
quilts. Each year for Christmas, 7 
children..,: 14 grandchildren, and 14 
great-grandchildren got a quilt. She 
also gave away a lot. She probably 
pieced 50 or more a year. She would 
quilt during the winter perhaps 25 
quilts. She got S3 for quilting a 
quilt when she started doing it; later 
she got $5- To her, it was quite a 
fortune. 
243 - 272 Maggie's favorite pattern is the Cathedral 
Window. She likes the Maple Leaf. 
She enjoyed the Cathedral Window 
because it is a challenge. The average 
quilt has 900 squares, and in one each 
print is different. She never likes 
to do the same designs and colors over.

She used to sew for twin neices and 
hated doing the second outfit. She 
likes to do something different each 
time. 
Applique quilt. Maggie has never made 
one. She never made the Dutch Girl. 
She also has the Dutch Boy and Colonial 
Lady. She plans to make them. 
She likes to quilt by the square or by 
the fan. Most mountain people quilted 
by the fan, diagonal, or by the block. 
Later, a lot has been done with the 
fancy scrolls since quilting became a 
fad. Maggie has some of the patterns 
in a book, but she hasn’t tried them. 
The colors make a quilt attractive. Some 
of her older quilts, the colors are not 
matched too well. Sometimes she might 
have two colors for each block} it made 
the pattern show up. The Basket Quilt 
and Maple Leaf, each basket and leaf 
is different. You have to have pretty 
colors, and get them placed right. The 
Maple Leaf has darks and light scattered 
throughout the quilt like the fallen 
leaves in the fall. You don't want 
all of one color in one place. 
The design of the quilting pattern is 
important as well as the size of 
the stitches. When you grow up with 
this, you don't think too much about 
what made a quilt pretty. When we 
made a quilt, we made it for the 
service we got out of it. We always 
covered them with a spread. Now 
people are using them as a spread. 
They were just something to be used.. 
They didn't become something special 
until her mother was older and she 
realized this was her legacy. Her 
children will probably feel the same 
way. Maggie has thrown quilts away 
that she should have mended. Her 
mother-in-law made a Double Wedding 
Ring that she did mend and keep. She 
is doing some of that with her mother's 
quilts. Maggie did a lot of knitting 
and only started making quilts again 
recently. She started doing it to 
have something to do. She can't just 
sit. Now that she has to stay with 
her mother, she needs something to do. 
She wanted something she could drop 
off and pick up again. 
Maggie isn't sure she was influenced by 
the new popularity of quilts. She did

it because her mother quilted. She 
always like to quilt. She didn't 
like embroidery or stuffed toys. That 
was doing the same thing over and over. 
Quilting is different every time you 
work on a new pattern. 
433 _ 470 Maggie has not changed the way she quilts. 
It gets to be a habit; she quilts the 
way her mother does. She uses the 
same material her mother did. The only 
thing she doesn't like to do is piece 
linings out of small pieces of material. 
Maggie wants a lining all the same 
color. The patterns are the same 
because she has picked them up from 
her mother. She is trying to save all 
her mother's patterns.

2-33 She was born on a farm; they grew 
their own food. Her mother wove 
blankets on a loom. Lura would 
hunt quill weed to run the wool on 
to go on her shuttle. The wool 
yarn would be put on the hollow weed 
to go in the shuttle. Her mother 
would weave with this wool. Lura 
has always been interested in blankets, 
quilts, and coverlets. Her mother 
never wove coverlets. The people 
used these to keep warm because the 
houses were cold. The quilts were 
necessary so they were heavier. Lura 
makes her’s as spreads for the beauty 
of them. She always stops at a shop 
to look at quilts. It is a tedious 
job to make a quilt. When she was 
growing up, they made the quilt from 
used material, now Lura buys new 
cotton for her quilt. She likes cotton 
more than man-made fabrics. It is 
hard to get cotton today. 
33 - 36 She tries to use cotton all the time. 
Some of her quilts are woven polyester, 
not knit polyester. 
36 - 61 She was born in Laurel Fork in 1906. 
She loved beautiful quilts as a child. 
She wanted to make one; her mother let 
her have some scraps. She made big 
seams, and her mother said the stitches 
were so big the quilt pulled apart. You 
have to have little stitches so it will 
hold together. Some people use the 
sewing maching, but Lura pieces her's

by band. She can make a quilt more 
easily by hand; you can't make the 
little seams as true by macnine as 
you can by hand. It makes a better 
quilt; it is truer and more even. 
A quilt may have little tiny square. 
You must have them true and all running 
together. Piecing a quilt is a pastime 
for Lura. She does it at night while 
she watches TV. 
She pieced and quilted 4 last year. She 
puts a lot of quilting in her quilts. 
She makes them as gifts. She has 10 
grandchildren and she hopes to make 
each a quilt. She is about half 
through. They seem to care about 
them because they see how much time 
it takes to make one. A quilt doesn't 
look good after it is put through a 
washing machine. She dry cleans her's. 
A quilt never looks good after it has 
been washed. You can't iron a quilt. 
Cotton needs to be ironed. Polyester 
washes better than cotton. If you 
soil a quilt, have them dry cleaned. 
She worked on the farm; she hoed corn, 
milked cows, and helped her mother 
make lye soap. They got ashes from 
the fireplace, poured them in a hollow 
log. They poured water through the 
ashes to get lye. The lye was mixed 
with grease and boiled all day; then 
you had soap for washing. It wasn't 
as good as our detergent today. They 
washed on the boards. They didn't have 
electricity in this community until 
1940. They had some gasoline powered 
washing machines. They were always 
busy. She always liked school; she 
wanted to be a teacher. She got a 
degree in 1957 from Radford College. 
She taught before then. She started 
teaching at 18; she got married and 
stopped teaching when her children 
were small. During WWII they asked 
her to come back, so she started 
college. Her daughter graduated from 
the same college 10 years earlier. 
Canning. Most farm people do a lot of 
canning. She knew how to can when 
she got married and she always canned. 
She started teaching at 18 in Buchanen 
County; she had never been away from 
home before. She stayed away from home 
for 7 months and made $85 permonth. 
The next year she taught at home.

Sh.e got married at 19 and quit when 
her oldest daughter was born. She 
quit teaching until WWII. She 
retired in 1971. 
Her first school was 1 through 7- Most 
schools were one room schools. The 
children did learn; they learned from 
eachother. One year she had 7 in the 
first grade and 39 in the school. All 
seven except one learned how to read 
well. You couldn't give any individual 
attention. The school was at Crooked 
Oak. She stayed at Laurel Fork for 
21 years teaching 4th and 5th grade. 
She enjoyed teaching; she feels more 
at ease with younger children than 
adults. She loves children. She has 
10 grandchildren. 
She didn't start quilting until several 
years after she was married. At home 
she pieced the quilts, and her mother 
would quilt them. She didn't do very 
good quilting in the beginning. When 
she first started quilting, she did 
it just to have something to put on 
the beds. She uses them for spreads 
now. She wants something to beautiful 
to have and enjoy. Some quilts she 
doesn't see for a year, but she 
knows she has them. It is a big job 
to quilt. You have to stretch your 
lining, put your filling in, put the 
top on, and you have to stretch and 
sew it in your frame. It needs to be 
stretched tight in the frames. 
Her first quilts. The basket quilt 
was one of the first she made; it was 
similar to the one her great-grand 
mother made. Her's wasn't as good 
quality as that, but she kept it. 
It was the basket pattern. Her mother 
did all her quilts in the fan. Lura 
quilts her's more fancy, and with a 
piece more. She quilts by the piece. 
She used to quilt on the seam, but 
decided it didn't show up enough. 
How she quilts a little farther away 
from the seam. 
Lura quilts in the wintertime. In the 
summer she likes to garden and travel. 
In the winter, when you have to stay 
in is a good time to quilt. Sometimes 
she starts before Christmas. The 
Tumbling Star she started before 
Christmas; it took her till spring to 
finish that quilt. Last year she did 
four during that time. She did a

Turkey Track the year ‘before. She 
made it for her son for Christmas, 
hut finished it up later. 
If it’s had weather, she quilts all day 
long. Her arthritis gets her between 
the shoulders. She doesn't see to 
quilt well at night. She uses a 
circle frame on a stand. She stretches 
the quilt and hastes it together and 
uses the circle frame to quilt. She 
can move it to any room she wants to. 
She has heen using it 6 or 7 years. 
You can't do fancy quilting in a hig 
frame. She can turn and twist the 
little frame to do the fancy wreath 
in a little frame. She can't get to 
it in a hig frame. 
The frame is 18 inches wide, and you 
just let the quilt fall on the floor. 
She quilts where she has carpet so it 
stays clean. 
Lura quilts in the daytime. Her family 
thinks her quilting is beautiful. They 
like to get the quilts. They want her 
to do what she wants to do. She 
would rather quilt than embroider or 
crochet, or knit. She has always 
loved quilts. 
She never quilted when she taught school. 
She would knit then. Teaching is a 
full time job. She did some piecing 
at home and some quilting when she was 
married; she stopped doing it when she 
taught school and picked it up again 
10 years ago. 
She started quilting again when she saw 
all the beautiful quilts in magazines 
and shops. She would not sell a quilt. 
She gives her quilts away. There is 
too much time in a quilt for her to 
sell. 1. People couldn't pay her what 
they are worth. She has never sold 
a quilt. 
Lura has made 8 or 10 quilts since 1971* 
She gave them away. The first one she 
gave was to her oldest daughter. There 
is a lot of work in each one. She 
would have had to have $250 for it. 
She has seen quilts selling for high 
prices. Some are pretty and well done. 
The work depends upon the talent of 
the person. She is not the best at 
making quilts; they are passable.

401 - 444 Quilting patterns. She orders them 
from Mountain Mist. She has a lot 
of quilt books that she gets patterns 
from. She made two Dresden Plates 
last year. She can look at aj picture 
and cut the pattern she wants. She 
gets patterns from friends. Story 
about friend who told her about 
Wishing Star quilt. The friend 
sent her the pattern. Country people 
make more quilts than city people. 
A lot of people in this area are 
making quilts now. 
444 - 470 A lot of the people started making the 
quilts for the money; a lot of people 
started quilting for the craft shops. 
Virginia Yates' Craft Shop. She 
has some quilts that are done well 
and some that are not done well.

Outline 
1 - 27 The Red Quilt. People asked her if 
she did the feather wreath on the 
machine. You couldn't do it on the 
machine. Machine quilting is serviceable 
not beautiful. The fancy quilting has 
to be done by hand. She marks it with 
a pencil lightly and then covers it'r 
up with her quilting. She dots it 
with a pencil. With some difficult 
patterns, she puts them on a durable 
paper and punches holes in it. She 
puts that over her square and then 
dots the square. You don't notice the 
pencil marks on her quilts. She has 
seen quilts that weren't that pretty 
when she looks closely at them. Lura 
has trouble getting her quilts stretched. 
They need to be stretched real tight 
so that they are smooth when they come 
out of the frames. 
27 - 4-2 Sometimes her .-quilts have little pockets 
in them. When you cut bias, it is hard 
to get a quilt stretched in a frame. 
A quilt is many different pieces. 
The orange, brown, and yellow quilt 
isn't stretched tight enough. This 
is the problem of not having help to 
stretch it in the frames. 
4-2 - 54 She stretches the lining on the carpet 
and pins it to the carpet. She puts 
the padding and quilt top on that and 
pins it to the lining and carpet. She 
pins and sews it together so it won't 
slip. The carpet is a little hard to 
pin through. 
54- - 59 
Slie lias quilted in frames. She can't 
do fancy quilts in a big frame; 
you can't get back and forth to it. 
She prefers the little frame. She 
has encouraged others to use the 
little frame. 
59 - 68 
It is not quite as much trouble to use 
the big frame once you get the quilt 
in the frame. She did a Flower 
Garden in the big frame; it wasn't 
as much turning as fancy quilting. 
She got the pattern out of a book 
and gave it to her granddaughter. 
68 - 91 
She has quite a few quilting books, 
but she doesn't get quilting magazines. 
Family Circle and Women's Day sometimes 
have designs. She doesn't need the 
pattern; she can get it from the picture. 
She doesn't use any old pattern from 
her mother. The Turkey Track and 
Dresden Plate are old patterns; most 
of her patterns are old patterns, but 
not copied from her mother's quilts. 
Lura doesn't have her mother's quilts . 
She got the old patterns out of books 
or magazines. They say they are old. 
She has 15 or 20 quilt books. She 
tries to visualize what will be 
pretty in an over-all design. 
She gets her piecing and quilting 
91 - 111 
patterns from books. The feather 
wreath needs a plate or something 
round as a pattern. She traces it 
lightly with a pencil; she uses a #2 
pencil. You can stamp patterns; she 
has never used them. 
Lura can't quilt a straight line. Curved 
111 - 128 
lines are easier. Her straight lines 
don't look straight. She did quilt 
a Lone Star in straight lines; she 
quilted around each piece. She stays 
away from straight lines. 
128 - 150 
She used to quilt in the fan, but she 
doesn't anymore. Quilting by the piece 
and using a pretty design is more 
attractive. The fan is pretty, but 
they are hard to do too. She joins 
with squares a lot and that is not 
good with fans. She has nothing 
against fans, but basically she quilts 
by the piece. She fills in with fancy 
patterns. She works it out to fit the 
quilt. She had to do a lot of thinking 
to fill in the orange and brown quilt. 
The colors in that quilt are pretty.

Lura uses regular quilting thread. To 
piece, she uses a soft thread that 
will hold the pieces together. Two 
strands of embroidery thread are good. 
Some people use #20 sewing thread. 
Embroidery thread is expensive, but it 
is soft. She uses regular quilting 
thread to quilt. She ignores the 
lining when she quilts; she chooses 
the color to match the quilt top. 
The lining should not be seen as much 
anyway. If the top is red, she quilts 
it in red. She shows me a quilt. She 
ignored the light green lining. The 
top is quilted in red thread and white 
thread according to the color of the 
piece. She quiltedoon the cream 
because it made the flower show up 
more. She didn't use green because 
she wasn't quilting on the green. 
If she would have quilted with the 
green, it would have ruined the top. 
Lura likes figured linings; it doesn't 
show up your quilting on the back. Her 
stitches are longer on the back than 
on the front. She has learned to make 
short stitches; the thinner your padding 
the shorter your stitches. You can 
make three or four stitches at a time 
all of them short. She likes small 
stitches. Long basting stitches don't 
look good in a quilt. 
Lura prefers cotton for the tops of the 
quilts. She would always prefer to 
use cotton, but it is expensive. Her 
granddaughter, Mary Turner, bought her 
some pretty cottons for her birthday. 
She needed them for the Dresden Plate. 
Lura doesn't sew that much, so she 
needs to buy her fabrics by the yard. 
She has some old clothes, but she has 
never used them. She doesn't object 
to them, but it is too much time. 
She likes her colors to be right. Shows 
me another quilt. The quilting doesn't 
show up on the figured lining. The 
red, black, and blue cotton prints 
were made into Wishing Star. The 
squares could be the same, but she 
made her's different. She had a lot 
of red in everyone. It was quilted 
in white. She worked out the quilting 
pattern herself; she traced a spool 
or 500 piece and cut it out of card¬ 
board. She used a plate for her 
wreath. She varies the wreath pattern.

She just cuts the pattern out of 
cardboard and marks around it. The 
store bought pattern is not the right 
size. Her saucer gives her the right 
size and then she fills in the petals. 
She makes up a feather pattern to fit 
the circle in her quilt. The feather 
wreaths are different. She has one 
now that has a big square in it, and 
she'11 have to figure out some way 
to fill it in. It is Road to California. 
She is piecing it now. She started 
it in the spring and she hasn't worked 
on it this summer. She drives the 
tractor on her farm. She drives on 
the farm checking on her cattle. She 
is an outdoor person who likes to be 
out even in the winter. If she gets 
depressed, she gets outdoors. The 
trees and birds make you feel better. 
Wild animals are not afraid of tractors. 
She wants to show me the quilt she has 
started. She is glad we don't have to 
give out blue and white ribbons. She 
could learn a lot from me. She wants 
to see our book on quilts. Someone 
might write a book about Mountain 
crafts. Picture book and scholarly 
books. She hopes the book is in color 
so people can see these beautiful quilts. 
The brown and orange quilt would not 
look as good in black and white. Many 
things go into the beauty of a quilt. 
She is not good on selecting colors. 
Knowing what would be good is one thing, 
and finding it is another. She would 
like to do a Lone Star in different 
shades of orange. Rinding the material 
is the problem. 
She would like to use cotton, but she is 
using polyester now. She tries to 
choose colors that will go in her rooms. 
She likes reds and cream. She doesn't 
like white; it yellows with age. She 
prefers a light beige or cream color 
which doesn't yellow. She hopes her 
quilts will be here for a few years. 
She looks for small figured patterns. 
She likes antiques and old things. The 
calicos of long ago were small-figured. 
Small patterns best represent what 
they had long ago. When she was a 
little girl they wore calico dresses. 
She prefers cotton; it is expensive.

Outline 
Showing me the Road to California quilt. 
She got the pattern out of a quilting 
book. The fabric is polyester. Why 
did she use these colors? The solid rose 
color picks up a color in the print. 
Her stitches are not all that small. 
The polyester doesn't look like a 
man made fabric. The bias fabric is 
hard to stretch smooth. Shows me her 
collection of fabrics with small patterns 
She matches the colors. The red cotton 
fabric would go well with red patterned 
fabric. She found one piece of cotton 
in the 5 and 10 cent store. It was a 
dollar a yard. She shows me one that 
is an old time calico print. Big print 
doesn't adapt itself to the small pieces 
in a quilt. My blouse would be pretty 
in a quilt. 
38 - 46 She will be using all these fabrics in 
quilts or pillows. She thinks the 
pillows are pretty. She saw some at 
the craft shop and wants to make one 
for a birthday present. She would make 
them to match her colors. 
46 - 63 Filler. She thinks cotton is nice, but 
she likes polyester blanket pieces. 
They shouldn't be too heavy. They are 
a yard and a half long; you have to 
whip them together so you don't have 
a heavy place in them. She gets the 
blanket remnants at fabric shops in 
the area. She would like to go to 
the blanket factory. She would like

to braid a rug this year and would 
like to use blanket material. 
She used to use cotton batting for tbe 
filler. Quilts used to be made 
heavier than they are now, but they 
are harder to quilt. Some people 
tack quilts. Lura has only tacked one 
quilt in her life; she prefers them 
quilted. Tacked quilts are attractive. 
Heavy wool materials are pretty tacked. 
She has one heavy wool tacked quilt; 
it is pieced out of her mother's dresses, 
like a crazy quilt. 
People used to make crazy quilts around 
here. Lura always pieced her quilts, 
and used some kind of pattern. 
She never filled the quilt with old 
clothes; neither did her mother. She 
sometimes covered an old quilt. It 
could be done for warmth, but it would 
be heavy. 
She used polyester batting; it makes a 
light, fluffy quilt. It is easy to 
quilt through. You have to use for 
your lining and top something that is 
easy to quilt through. Sheeting is 
too hard to quilt with. She has one 
quilt joined with sheeting; it was 
hard to quilt because the sheeting is 
so closely woven. You need something 
you can get your needle through. 
She prefers cotton lining. The other 
materials are pretty, but she prefers 
cotton. She wants more pretty cottons 
in the store. She likes the printed 
fabric to hide her big stitches. 
Favorite piecing patterns. The Turkey 
Track pattern is one of her favorites. 
She made it out of 9 inch squares. 
She also made one out of 14 inch*' 
squares. It was hard to piece because 
of the curved pieces. She likes Dresden 
Plate and Double Wedding Ring. She 
would like to make another one. They 
are difficult to fit together well. 
Every seam has to match. She likes 
The Lone Star too. She has seen the 
Nine of Diamonds. She would like to 
make the Log Cabin, but doesn't think 
she could go from dark to light in the 
fabrics. It is a beautiful quilt. 
Appliqu quilts. She has done some 
applique work on the Tumbling Star. 
She did the Grapes and Leaves and 
Ohio Rose. The border is_appliqued 
on the red and green Rolling Star. 
page 3 
The blue one is the Tumbling Star. 
The Turkey Track is also appliqued* 
she pieced one and appliqued the other. 
It is difficult to piece because it 
has curves in it. She got a pattern 
from a friend that was appliqued so 
she appliqued it. She liked the pieced 
one better. It was prettier and a 
smaller square. Many patterns can be 
done either way. Dresden Plate is 
appliqued. You piece and then appliqued. 
She appliqued it to unbleached muslin 
and then cut the muslin away, so it 
wouldn’t be so stiff. It is an easy 
quilt. She told a young neighbor that 
it would be good to start with. It 
is not difficult; you piece the wheel 
together and fit it on to your center. 
You have to press and baste it down, 
and then stitch it down. It is one of 
the easier quilts she has done. Some 
people don't join them, but she joins 
them with strips. She is afraid of 
straight lines, so she joined her's. 
Some people have just sewed the squares 
together. It takes more squares, but 
it looks pretty. 
211 -224 She would like to quilt in groups, but 
the senior citizen group doesn't. The 
fancy quilting Lura does couldn't be 
done by everyone. The product would 
not be good because there would be" 
be too much variety in quilting. They 
could do the fans. It would be 
enjoyable. She has not done much with 
a group. 
224 - 250 She quilts with her granddaughter. She 
has taught her to knit and crochet 
and quilt. She is busy and doesn't 
have the time. She is active in 
school at 16. She can do them better 
than Lura. It takes more than a month 
or year to be good at quilting. You 
have to have interest in it. Mary 
wants to make them, but she doesn't 
have the time. 
250 - 300 Lura taught her how to piece a square. 
She taught her to piece and quilt a 
pillow. Mary hasn't done a lot of 
quilting. She helped Mary cut and 
piece a square. She has not worked 
on any of Lura's quilts. She saw 
it was more difficult than she 
thought. You have to know how to use 
a thimble. You can't piece and quilt 
page 4 
300 - 345 
345 - 353 
353 - 371 
371 - 394 
a quilt without using a thimble. You 
have to learn to use a thimble. Lura 
was taught by her mother to use a 
thimble; now she can't sew on a button 
without using a thimble. You can't 
piece quilts and quilt without using 
a thimble. Your fingers get tender 
quilting anyway. She enjoys quilting; 
that is why she does it. She gets 
tired of it sometimes when it takes 
her months to quilt a quilt. There 
are thousands of stitches in her 
quilts. 
Quilting frames. A neighbor gave them 
to her. In her old home, she found 
the frames her mother had and she 
has them. She bought the hoop from 
Sears. She got the idea from the 
catalog; she had heard of them. They 
are $10. When she returned from 
California, she couldn't find her 
frames anywhere. She ordered another 
set and Mary, whohad borrowed them,was 
given the old set. Lura has used the 
oval small frame for many years. She 
likes to turn and move her quilt 
around for the fancy quilting. She 
calls it fancy quilting. The grape 
design in the applique quilt was 
tedious. The pattern suggested she 
do that. 
She has never appliqued a quilt from a 
kit. She bought one but never got 
to it. She would rather work out 
her own pattern. 
How she sets up her quilt. She puts 
part of it in her frame after it is 
pinned and sewed together. You begin 
in the middle of the quilt, so you 
can push the wrinkles to the outside 
of the quilt. On the big frame you 
start on the outside of the quilt, 
but on the little frame, you start 
in the middle. 
Many things make a quilt attractive: 
workmanship, colors are most important. 
Bright colors and colors that blend 
together are good. Workmanship is 
small stitches, smooth, even stitches. 
It is piecing the quilt properly. It 
should be hand made and pressed and 
ironed well before it is quilted. Many 
things go into a good quilt. The 
pieces should meet where they are 
supposed to.

Evaluating other people's quilts. 
She looks at the colors first. She 
looks at the quilting next. She 
doesn't like long stitches. She 
tries to see if it was hand done, 
hut it doesn't matter if it was 
machine made as long as it was put 
together well. 
She would like the people she give quilts 
to to use them some, hut she doesn't 
want them abused. She has seen quilts 
hanging on fences and dirty. She 
wouldn't want her's used like that. 
She wants her people to enjoy them 
some and take care of them. She 
wants them to he cherished. She doesn't 
want them thrown around. 
Changes in her quilting. She used to 
quilt on the seam, now she quilts 
1/8 to 1/4 inch away and it shows 
up the quilting better. The quilting 
is part of the quilt; it has to show 
up. She has changed from plain 
quilting to fancy wreaths and fancy 
designs. It adds to the quilt. 
Plain quilting. It was just quilting 
around the piece or fan quilting just 
to hold it together for service. 
Now she quilts for the beauty of a 
quilt. She makes them for the beauty 
not for the service. She uses them 
as spreads.

Index # Outline 
1 - 33 Discussing Terry and Lyntha. A quilt 
her mother gave her before she was 
married. Her great Grandmother Terman 
made it. She doesn't use it; it has 
beautiful quilting on it. It is a 
Flower Basket with unbleached muslin 
dyed with walnut hulls. They boiled 
the hulls and used the strained liquid 
for a dye. She made it in the early 
1800's. Her grandmother died in 1903. 
She always understood that her great 
Grandmother made it. It was pieced 
with calico prints and store bought 
material. They had peddlars selling 
the cotton materials. 
33-36 Crazy Quilt. They made the Crazy Quilt 
out of silk 
36 - 58 Drunkard's Path. Lura made it 10 to 15 
year's ago. She quilted it on the 
seam. She changed to quilting 1/4- 
inch from the edge. If you make big 
stitches, they don't show up in the 
seam, but it you do small stitches it 
is better to have them show. She 
tries to stitch 1/8 to 1/4- inch away 
jfrom the seam. It depends on your 
seam^ sometimes you can't get your 
needle through close to the seam. 
You leave enough raw edge inside your 
seam to hold it, and sometimes you 
can't stitch that close to the seam. 
Wishing Star. It has right much quilting 
on it. It is done in blues; cotton 
calico and woven polyester outside. 
58 - 11?

She made this last winter. It is hard 
to find cotton. The feather wreath 
is quilted in the white squares. She 
fills in the center; she blocked the 
center of it. It is a little faster. 
She used a printed back. You make 
longer stitches on the back, and it 
doesn't show up as much. It goes well 
with the front too. She turned the 
back up as the binding. It was con¬ 
venient. She was trying to finish it 
up for Christmas. She gave it to her 
grandson. She didn't have the squares 
finished when she gave it to him. She 
has finished it, but not given it back 
to him. Blue seemed to suit a man. 
She doesn't know whether men appreciate 
quilts as much as women or not. He 
appreciates this quilt. She gave 
another grandson a Dresden Plate; he 
saw it and wanted it. She gave it to 
him and made the Wishing Star for her 
other grandson. The first grandson took 
the Dresden Plate to college and used 
it on his bed. 
117 - 184 "Isn't that a beautiful thing." She 
sees them hanging on the line; she 
didn't know her quilts looked so 
beautiful hanging on the line. This 
is the Ohio Pose. She made it 10 or 
15 years ago. She got the pattern 
from Mountain Mist. They sell many 
of them for 250. She quilted it in 
a small frame. It is cotton and they 
gave her all the patterns. She bought 
the fabrics at shops around the area. 
She buys fabrics that she thinks would 
be nice for quilts. She has right 
much on hand; she wonders if she will 
ever use all her fabrics. Usually 
she has to buy something else when she 
starts a quilt. She could make the 
quilt in any color, but you need to 
have the different shades. Pink and 
blues seem to have the most shades. 
There are two shades in the quilt. 
She also made Oregon Daisy. She hasn't 
seen it since she gave it to Mary. 
She bordered it differently. The 
Daisy is made out of a small print. 
She made it for a single bed. Her 
grandchildren know how to work her. 
She is fond of her grandchildren. She 
plans to make all of her grandchildren 
a quilt. 
page 3 
184 - 254 She made this one for one of her 
grandchldren, but her son liked it 
so much that she gave it to him. 
"Isn't that a gorgeous thing." She 
might put up a line and price the 
quilts out of reason when she puts 
them up. That way people can see 
them. She didn't know they were so 
pretty. She has never seen them out¬ 
doors. She doesn't know the name of 
it. She started out with the center 
and didn't know how to end-it. She 
decided to end up with the blocks 
around it. She made up the blocks 
around it herself. It is the Sunburst. 
She copies it from a picture in a 
magazine of a famous quilt. It didn't 
show the outside. It just showed the 
center. She just filled in the spaces 
with quilting. She did the edges 
around the square; she has two different 
patterns in the beige. She had the 
corners to do too. She got some ideas 
from book. She had to choose what 
would fit in the space. She used 
several different patterns in the quilt. 
She hated to give it up; she might 
not get all those colors together 
again. She didn't have enought colors 
for the small stars, so she had to 
alternate the colors. She doesn't 
usually brag on her handiwork, but 
they look pretty on the line. Other 
people have some just as pretty. She 
never takes her's to quilt fairs; 
something might happen to them over¬ 
night . 
254 - 286 Double Wedding Ring. She made it 15 
years ago. She felt it was over¬ 
quilted. She thinks she could have 
quilted less and it would have looked 
just as pretty. She got so tired of 
that Sunburst quilt. Each diamond is 
quilted allthe way around. She 
started it one year and finished it 
the next. A small frame is nice for 
that reason. She asked them to bring 
the quilt for us to see. She quilted 
on the Sunburst one winter and one 
fall. The Wedding Ring she quilted 
on for a long time too. She can't 
sell quilts because she spends too 
much time on them. 
286 - 336 "Isn't that gorgeous." She hasn't 
seen them outdoors. She shouldn't 
say that about her own work; but 
GrJ-RlOZ 
she isn't looking at them closely. 
She used to do some oil painting, and 
she has loved art. Her eye appreciates 
beautiful thing. The quilts are art 
work. The pieces are fitted in closely 
in the Wedding Ring. If they were 
irregular, it wouldn't be beautiful. 
Is it a thing of beauty? She would 
not have advertised her quilts. 
She would like to do one in color, 
but she likes the cream background. 
White turns yellow. She hopes her 
quilts see the 21st century. She wants 
her quilts to be used but not abused. 
Crazy Quilts. They were pieced out of 
dress material in the early 1900's. 
They used scraps and put it on an old 
cotton background. They pieced them 
in squares on old material and put 
them together. They embroidered 
the seams after it was made; they may 
have embroidered the squares before. 
She has never made one. They must 
have made it one winter. 
She bought them at auctions 20 years 
ago. Lura collects antiques. Her 
daughter wants her to write about 
her collection. She is a busy person. 
She paid S3.50 for one and $30 for 
the other. When she sees something 
she really wants, she concentrates on 
it and is willing to pay the price for 
it. That was not a high price. She 
paid $35 for the most beautifully 
embroidered one. She paid $3.50 for 
the one with the dates. They came 
from Floyd and Patrick counties. 
She bought a lot of clocks. She 
doesn't know the families from which 
the quilts came. 
The Double Wedding Ring is a small 
quilt; it is not as large as she would 
like it. She uses her quilts as 
spreads or folds them and puts them 
on the foot of the bed; she never uses 
them as quilts. She has wallpaper, 
and some of the quilts don't go well 
in there. The Ocean Waves goes well 
as a spread. She tried the Rolling 
star as a spread, but it didn't work 
well. She copied it from an old 
quilt. The old quilt had smaller 
squares. It is well proportioned as 
it is. She made it two years ago. 
She thought she would never get it 
quilted. It takes her an hour and

a half to make a feather wreath. 
She quilts on both sides of the 
circle.

Making a blackgum toothbrush

Mrs. Largen describes making tooth 
powder and homemade toothbrushes. 
Powder from burned willow twigs and 
toothbrushes from blackgum and birch. 
Kept the willow charcoal in a glass 
jar and used it as tooth powder. Her 
aunt had beautiful teeth. She would dip 
the stick brush into the powder and 
brush her teeth. Black gum makes the 
best brush but can also use mahogany. 
Toothache remedies such as clove oil 
and hot poltice to the face. Tooth 
would get easy once you stzrted to the 
dentist. 
Mr largen worked in a hosiery mill 15 
years and in the tiavy 2 years in W.W.2. 
Went into saw mill business in Richmond, 
Roanoke and retired at age 62. He and 
brother had Largen upolstery shop in 
Roanoke. Gets ideas for furniture 
from head and pictures. 
Looking for blackgum. Mainly the snuff 
chewing women used the blackgum brushes. 
Blackgum tree has round leaf. A lot of 
blackgum trees around. Ring the twig with 
the teeth and clean the bark off and then 
make the brush. Get the brush good and 
wet and then roll it round and round in 
the snuff and then lay in their 
jaw and then leave it in there. Somnetime 
they'd then brush their teeth with it 
and then lay it right back in there. 
End with a knot makes a bigger brush.

Used a Razor Back Hog Pocket Knife 
to cut off the branches and trim off 
the bark. 
Used a 20 guage shotgun to kill 10 
squirrels. At the sawmill in richmond 
Mr. Largen was cutting a small blackgum 
tree and cut into a cannon ball and 
then found lots of bullets in the tree. 
Still has the cannon ball at home. 
Tree was at chickahominy swamps. 
Women used the bru hes to dip snuff but 
other poeple just used them to brush 
their teeth. Used willow charcoal and 
regular tooth paste with the brushes. 
Years ago you didn’t see toothpaste 
around everywhere the way you do now. 
Finally found some toothbrush timber. 
Wanted gerri to do the chewing. Cut 
the twig off right at the knot which 
makes a finer and a better brush. Takes a 
lot of chewing to get one down right. 
Slick bark makes the finished brush 
look a little better but doesn't work 
any better. Brush end gets fuzzy. Need 
good teeth to chew the ends. Store 
teeth don't work. Mr. Largen kidded the 
"flat lander" about using a hammer to 
beat the ends. Mr. largen claims his 
horse teeth a good for chewing the ends. 
Used to clean his teeth with them all 
the time.

Mr. Largen used the brushes all the time 
as a child. He feels blessed with good 
teeth. Just turned 70 Sept 22. Doesn't 
know if gum brushes are responsible for 
good teeth or not. 
Describes method of use. Rubbed it around 
and in between everything. Go back and 
under gum. Dentist keeps Mr. Largen 
supplied with tooth brushes and the other 
day gave him a thing to hold a tooth pick 
to get around all the teeth to get all 
the dirt out of there. A good gum brush 
would work about as well as a store 
bought brush. Turn it as it is used and 
also able to get jaw teeth. Stick with 
a brush on it. Used a scrubbing and 
rotating mot ion. 
Talks about fox hunting with Rusty Marshall. 
Garden is about finished. Aging some 
cherry wood to make some furniture 
later. Going to see hunting dogs. 
Offered us some grapes from vine. 
Tell a few jokes when sitting around 
but not when the dogs are running. 
Got an automobile for his dogs to live in. 
It makes a good house. Its warm, dry 
and they can see out. Get in and out 
thro^h open door. Dog named Joe is a 
good dog. Can get a fox quicker than 
any dog he has ever seen. Five years 
old. Joe is the star. He is a dog. 
He just get out and get one up the quickest 
You hear Joe you know the race is on. 
Race is between the fox andthe dogs.

The dogs all stay together. You don't 
hear any harking behind. If one gets 
behind you don't hear anything out of him 
until he is up there again. It is 
natural for them to chase the fox. No 
training is necessary. They stay n the 
carry-all year round. The dogs are 
English Walkers. 3 males and 2 females. 
Don't know how the dogs know when it is time 
to go hunting but they know and sart 
howling and carrying on. They know its 
time. The puppy is going to be a dandy. 
He is a hard-headed thing. 
Sold cows last fall and rents pasture to 
the man who bought them. 
Went into basement workshop. Has a lathe, 
drill press, jigsaw, joiner. 
Has a big box of toast for dogs. Gets it 
from the toaster factory. It is test 
toast from Procter at Mt. Airey. Has a 
pin up photo of Farrah-Fawcett Majors. 
Put it up just to see what Ruby would 
say. She said, "Take that thihg down." 
Sometimes lets the dogs go in his yard 
and the dogs chase the fox around the 
nearby woods. Stand and listen to the 
dogs bark. Sounds like music. 
Story about man who said, "I can't 
hear a thing for them dogs barking." 
Eerlie is not a joke teller; he can't 
remember them. 
Clint Iroler’s dogs. He has had some 
bad luck with them. Three or four 
got run over on the Parkway. Cne 
came in the other day and died. 
Eerlie has been lucky; he hasn't lost 
too many dogs. Clint has five dogs. 
They raise them; they don't inbreed 
them. Eerlie doesn't keep his dogs 
registered. 
Dogs on the Parkway. Eerlie knows of 
a lot that got killed up there; they 
are two miles from the Parkway. The 
dogs never catch the fox. He had 
them run eleven hours one night. 
The fox enjoys the chase. They leave 
the dogs and they come in later. They 
used to stay with them all night long. 
They hunt mostly in the day now. 
He saw the fox six times crossing the 
road the other day. They have plenty 
of foxes. They've been trapping them 
a lot lately. Pelts are worth $40 to 
$50. People around here are doing it. 
Eerlie wouldn't kill a red or gray fox 
for nothing. They are just out there 
to run; they don't hurt anything, 
They catch a chicken once in awhile.

dogs were in the lot. He wanted 
an old hen on the other side of 
the pen. Talking about Rusty, 
Blanton. Rusty is a pretty good 
fiddler and Blanton can play the 
banjo. He saw himself on video 
tape doing some flat foot dancing.
