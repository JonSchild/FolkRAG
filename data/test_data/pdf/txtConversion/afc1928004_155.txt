CLOWN'S SPARIC5 OF WISDOM. 
Heaven bless the wives, they fill our hives with little 
bees and honey. 
They soothe Lire's shocks they mend 
our socks, but don't they spend the money. 
If a 
woman were as little as she is good, a 
peashell would 
make her a 
gown and a 
hood. 
A man of words and not of deeds, is like a 
garden full of 
weeds. 
In times of prosperity, friends will be plenty : in times 
of adversity not one in twenty. 
If you wish to get rich, get married, when was ever 
honey made with one bee in the hive. 
lie who is a 
tiger in his own family, is generally a 
sheep 
in society. 
Fixed stars shine with a 
steady lustre. 
Those who jump at conclusions, are apt to fall upon un-
certainties. 
A near.lantern is better than a 
distant star. 
When you despair of good, beware of evil. 
A pea is as big as a 
mountain to a 
blind man. 
Husbands and letter-paper should be well ruled. 
Ladies please be sweet, but don't be too formal; be roses, 
but don't be prim-roses. 
The darker the setting, the brighter the diamond. 
Sorrows are the shadows of past joys. 
HUMAN LIFE.— The average of human life is 33 years. 
One-fourth of the population dies at or before the age 
of seven years. 
One-half at or before seventeen years. 
Among 10.000 persons one arrives at the age of 100 years; 
one in 5..i0 attains the age of 90, and one in a 
hundred lives 
to the age of GO. 
Married men live longer than single ones. 
In 1,000 persons, 95 marry, and more marriages occur in 
June and December than in any other month of the year. 
One-eighth of the whole population is military.

CLOWN'S SPARKS OF WISDOM.—[CoNTINuED. 
Professions exercise a 
great influence on longevity. 
In 
1,000 individuals who arrive at the age of 70 years. 43 are 
priests, orators. or public speakers, 30 are agriculturists, 33 
are workmen, 32 are soldiers or military employes, 20 are 
advocates or engineers, 27 are professors, and 24 are doc-
tors. 
" 
Sir, you have broken your promise," said one gentle-
man to another. 
" 
Oh, never mind ! I 
can make another just as good." 
Foun Goof) POINTS.—They are essentially necessary for 
the management of temporal concerns. 
These are-
1. Punctuality. 2 
Accuracy. 3. Steadiness. 4. Dispatch. 
Without the first, time is wasted. 
Without the second, mistakes latal to our own interest 
and that of others, may be committed. 
Without the third, nothing can be Nx-ell done. 
Without the fourth, opportunities for good are lost, 
which it is impossible to recall. 
Goo") DOCTRINE,.—Every good doctrine leaves behind it 
an etherial furrow ready for the planting of seeds which 
shall bring an abundant harvest. 
GOLD.—A cubic inch of gold is worth $210; a 
cubic foot 
$302.8S0 ; a 
cubic yard, $0,797,762. 
This is valuing it at 
$1S.69 an ounce. 
At the commencement of the Christian 
era. there was then in the world $427,000,000 in gold. This 
had diminished to $57,000.000 at the time America was dis-
covered. 
Then it began to increase. 
Now, the amount of 
gold in nse is estimated to be $6,000,001.000. 
Yet all this 
welded into one mass, \voted be contained in a 
cube of 
twenty-six feet. 
CLOWN'S GOOD AIM-CR.—Do 
not choose your friend by 
his looks! handsome shoes often pinch the feet. 
Don't be fond of compliments ; remember, " 'hank you 
pussy, and thank you pussy," killed the cat. 
Don't believe the man who talks most ; for mewing cats 
are seldom good mousers. 
By no means put yourself in another person's power ; if 
you put your thumb between ~ wo grinders, they are apt to 
bite. 
Drink nothing without seeing it ; sign nothing without 
reading it, and make sure that it means no more than it 
says. 
[2] 
CLOW..VS SPARKS OF WISDOM.---( CONTINUED. 
Don't go to law, unless you have nothing to lose ; law-
yers' houses are built on fools' heads. 
In any business, never wade into water where you can-
not see the bottom. 
Put no dependence upon the label of a 
bag, and count 
money alter your own. kin. 
See the sack open before you buy what is in it ; for he 
who trades in the dark asks to be cheated. 
Keep clear of the man who does not value his own char-
aeLer. 
Beware of any man who swears ; he who would blas-
pheme his Maker, would make no bones in lying or steal-
ing. 
Beware of no man more than yourself; we carry our 
worst enemies with us. 
When a 
new opinion or doctrine comes before you, do 
not bite till you know whether it is bread or a 
stone ; and 
do not be sure that the gingerbread is good because of the 
gilt on it. 
Never shout halloo ! till you are quite out of the wood ; 
and never cry fried fish, till they arc caught in the net. 
There is always time enough to boast— wait alittle longer. 
Don't throw away dirty water till you have got clean ; 
keep on scraping the roads till you can get better work, for 
(lie poorest pay is better than none, and the humblest 
office is better than being out of employment. 
Always give up the road to bu Is and bad men ; and 
never tight with a 
coal heaver, nor contend with a 
base 
character, for they will be sure to blacken you. 
Deliberate with caution, but act with decision, and yield 
with graciousness or oppose with firmness. 
There is no folly equal to that of throwing away friend--
011p in a 
world where friendship is so rare. 
To CURE CORNS.—Hold your feet near the fire until the 
corns pop. 
This is said to be a " sure pop." 
The road ambition travels is too narrow for friendship, 
too crooked for love, too rugged for honesty, and too dark 
for conscience.

VALUABLE RECIPES. 
SCARLET FEVER AND SMALL PDX.— Dr. W. Fields of 
Wilmington. Del., says : 
Having much experience in the 
cure of Scarlet Fever zuvl Small Pox. of the most malignant 
type. I 
would thank you for the sake of humanity, to pub-
lish a 
recipe, which, if faithfully carried out will cure 
forty-five cases out of every fifty, without calling a 
physi-
cian. 
SCARLET F 
EV ER.—For adults give one tablespoonful of 
brewer's yeast in three tablespoon fulls of sweetened water. 
three times a 
day, and, if the throat is much swollen, 
gargle with the yeast, and apply yeast to the throat as 
a 
poultice, mixed with Indian meal. 
Use plenty of catnip 
tea, to keep the eruption out on the skin several days. 
SMALL PDX.—Use the above dose of yeast three times a 
day ; and milk diet throughout the entire disease. 
Near-
ly every case can be cured without leaving a 
pock mark. 
SWEET OIL, according to the American ..-1rtisan, is an 
antidote for poison. 
It says that " poison of any conceiva-
ble description and degree of potency, which has been 
swallowed. intentionally or by accident. may be rendered 
instantly harmless by swallowing two gills of sweet oil. 
An individual with a strong constitution should take 
twice the quantity. 
This oil will neutralize every form 
of vegetable or mineral poison with which physicians and 
chemists are acquainted. 
We give this as we find it, and 
hope for the sake of suffering humanity, that it may prove 
true. 
M OCK M INCE PIES.—One cup chopped cracker, one 
sugar, one cup chopped raisins, two cups water, one cup 
half cup molasses, one half cup vinegar, two tablespoonfuls 
butter ; spice same as mince pie. The above makes four pies. 
To kill vermin on plants or animals, pour a gallon of 
boiling water on one pound of tobacco leaves, let it stand 
half an hour and then strain. 
This decoction is certain 
death on plants or animals. 
GRAFTING NV AX.—Take one pound of rosin, ball pound 
bees-wax. and quarter of a 
pound of tallow or lard, and 
melt them together. 
POISONS.—A large t 
tblespoonful of mustard, mixed in 
warm water and swallowed, is an an ever ready emetic 
that acts safely and surely. 
It should be taken promptly 
where dangerous poisons have been taken into the stomach, 
to throw them off.

FRIENDS VERSUS MONEY. 
You may all talk of friends, as much as you like, 
But he, who trusts to them is an unlucky wight, 
You may count them by scores, when you've money to 
spend, 
But wait till you're " broke," then how are you friends, 
Experience we're told, is a 
very good teacher, 
And experience has taught us, that money's the feature. 
You may call it vile dross, but on it depends, 
Your own future prospects, and also your friends; 
If humbly attired for a 
position you go, 
You're quickly informed " we can't give you a 
show," 
If you ask for the reason, they'll sneeringly smile 
And say, " ' tis because you have'nt the style." 
But if fashionably dress'd, alt ! that is sufficient, 
Although in much learning, you may be deficient, 
You're -accomplished—" genteel "—no matter how vile, 
Because you've the spondoolies " money and style," 
As you go through the world bear this fact in mind, 
To treat every one well, and pleasure you'll find, 
Do good where you can, and no one revile 
" 'Twill make you more happy than " Money or Style." 
CORNS.—Apply Lunar Caustic from time to time, re-
moving the dead skin it produces over the corn until it is 
cured. 
Wild Turnip scraped and bound upon a 
corn, 
pared until it is tender, will generally cure it. 
Saleratus 
bound on a 
corn removes it.

BACHELOR. 
When I 
was a 
Bachelor, bright was my eye, 
I 
never knew trouble or either a 
sigh, 
Until one day I 
met Miss Fan, 
She declared I 
would make a 
nice family man. 
Oh ! dear, deny it who can, 
Now I 
am the style for a 
family man. 
We lived and we loved, and a 
year passed away, 
She drove me around like a 
horse every day; 
See the cradle in the corner, deny it you can, 
Now I 
am a 
father and a 
family man. 
Oh: dear, deny it who can, 
Now I 
an a 
father and a 
family man 
There is Mr. Moustache with his silvery talk, 
He politely solicits my wife for a 
walk ; 
I 
fall in behind, look pleased if I 
can, 
And carry the baby like a 
family man, 
Oh ! dear, deny it who can, 
And carry the baby like a 
family man. 
Now husbands and wives, take warning by me, 
Be kind' to your families, and always agree ; 
Be kind to your neighbors I 
know you can, 
This ends the song of the family man. 
Oh ! dear, deny it' you can, 
This ends the song of the family man. 
JOHN FOSTER'S VERSION OF " THE STYLE Ili 
WHICH IT'S DONE. 
By JAMES COOKE. 
Some politicians of this age, 
They cut a 
mighty dash; 
They care nothing for the country, 
If they can get it's cash. 
It matters not how bad they be, 
They are not afraid to run— 
I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
Those Alabama Claims we want, 
They are a 
lawful debt; 
There has been such talk about them, 
And they not settled yet. 
We have made demands on Fngland, 
Which it's clear she wants to shun ; 
I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A young man- takes his girl out, 
For a 
drive, a 
ride, or walk; 
And ere they go a 
half a 
mile, 
Ott love lie's sure to talk. 
He says, " my dear, I'll marry you 1" 
But she thinks he's just in fun, 
I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
I 
can't make out how some men drc:ls, 
And look so well each day ; 
And borrow people's money; 
Which they ne'er intend to pay. 
They never do al hour's work 
And still have lots of fun, 
I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
Now I've given my 
opinion, 
And I 
hope you think I'm right; 
For it is my wish to satisfy 
The people here to-night. 
If I've gained your approbation, 
In t'.e humble course I've run ; 
I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done.

WATERFALL SONG. 
Ail you that have ever been in love, 
Can sympathize with me, 
For I 
have loved the fairest girl 
That ever you did see. 
Her age is scarcely seventeen— 
She is a 
figure straight and tall— 
She dressed so neat, and looked so sweet, 
And wore a 
Waterfall. 
The first time that I 
met her, 
I 
never can forget— 
I 
went into a 
Dry Good Store 
Some handkerchiefs to get— 
She stood behind the counter 
Dressed up like a 
Doll— 
I 
never saw a 
face so fair, 
Or such a 
Waterfall. 
It was at a 
Pic-nic Party 
I 
met her after that— 
I 
quickly introduced myself 
And had a 
pleasant chat. 
Lots of pretty girls were there, 
But none among them all 
Could dance with me except the girl 
That wore the Waterfall. 
I 
saw her home, we walked alone, 
I 
vowed we never would pal t— 
And -when I 
left her at the door, 
I 
knew she had won my heart. 
I 
heard a 
footstep coming— 
A footstep in the Hall— 
All sorts of colors turned the girl 
That wore the Waterfall. 
A pretty big fellow six foot high, 
Conic marching in the room— 
And when he saw me standing there 
lie at once began to fume. 
With eyes so fierce, and voice so harsh, 
lie did my heart appal, 
" 
This is my husband," said the girl 
That wore the Waterfall. 
Before I 
had time to say a 
word 
This felloto at me flew, 
And while the maiden held me down,' 
He beat me black and blue. 
When I 
got up, 1 
found I 
had lost 
Money, watch, chain, and all, 
I 
never since went near a 
girl 
That wears a 
Waterfall. 
JOHN HOWARD PAYNE'S 
66 HOXE, SWEET 
11011E." 
[These words were by John Howard Payne, and were sung in 
" 
Clan, the Maid of Milan." The air was originally Sicilian, and 
was, with slight alterations, introduced by Donizetti in his opera of 
• 
Anna Bolena," at the suggestion of the prima donna, Pasta.] 
Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home! 
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there. 
Which, seek thro' the world, is ,ne'er met with elsewhere; 
Home! home ! sweet, sweet home, 
There's no place like tome; there's no place like home. 
An exile from home., splendor dazzles in vain; 
Oh! give me my lowly thatch'd cottage again; 
The birds singing gayly, thet come at my call; 
Give me them, with the peace of mind dearer than all. 
Home ! home ! sweet, sweet home ! 
There's no place like home; there's no place like home. 
How sweet ' tis to sit 'neath a 
loud father's smile, 
And the cares of a 
mother to soothe and beguile. 
Let others delight 'mid new pleasures to roam, 
But give me, oh ! give rue the pleasures of home. 
Home ! home ! sweet, sweet home! 
But give me, oh! give me the pleasures of home. 
I 
gaze on the moon, as I 
trace the drear wild, 
A rid feel that my parent now thildiS of her child ; 
She looks on that moon from her own cottage door, 
Through woodbines whose fragrance shall cheer me no more. 
Home 1 
home I 
sweet, sweet home! 
There's no place like home ; there's no place like home. 
To thee I'll return, over-burden'd with care, 
The heart's dearest solace will smite on me there ; 
N., more from that cottage, again will I 
roam. 
Be it ever so humble, there's tie place like home. 
Home ! home ! sweet, sweet home ! 
There's no place like home ; there's no place like home.

Some fellas go in for the army, 
And some fellas go in for trade, 
But I 
havn't such bores to alarm me, 
My fortune was already made. 
And some fellas go in for brains, 
And scribble to turn in a

Whenever I

To keep them alive in I

Whenever they ask me sing 
They're certain to fall fast asleep.

Oh ! cease thy reposing, 
Night's stars are closing, 
Dreamily dozing, 
Into the day. 
Gaily awaking, 
Slumber forsaking, 
While morn is breaking, 
Let us away. 
Longing to cheer thee, 
And to be near thee, 
hoping to hear thee, 
hither I 
came. 
Soft words, in sighing, 
Cadences dying, 
Echoes in flying, 
Breathe thy dear name, 
Oh I 
cease thy reposing, 
When slumber bath found me, 
And lovingly hound me, 
hovering around me, 
Thy spirit seems. 
Silently blessing, 
Mutely confessing, 
Thy soul caressing, 
Mine in my dreams. 
When moonlight is beaming, 
And bright stars are g.eaming 
Whilst thou art dreaming, 
Haply of me.

FALSE AMELIA. 
Kind friends, your sympathy pray give, 
To one who's broken hearted, 
For truly I 
don't care to live, 
Since me and my girl's parted ; 
For Amelia was a 
nice young girl, 
Noue with her could compare, 
She had dark blue eyes and pearly teeth, 
And glossy jet black hair. 
Cuortus.—For once sweet Amelia was always my pride, 
I 
now wish I 
never had seen her, 
She has wounded my feelings and thrown me aside 
For a 
dashing young Comic Singer. 
Now if you'll 
list my friends, I'll tell you all, 
how I 
lost my little dear, 
I 
took her to a 
Music Hall, 
Not very far from here, 
We were happy till a 
young man came, 
Who seem'd so full of fun, 
lie sang a 
song with a 
break-jaw name, 
And Amelia's heart he won. 
Spoken.—How cruel. [For once, dc. 
Now he sang his songs in such a 
style, 
That kept us all in roars, 
And frequently would Amelia smile, 
And give . him great applause ; 
But the thing that put me in a 
rage, 
I 
oft think of now in pain, 
lied wink at my love while on the Str,ge, 
And she'd wink back again. 
Spoken.—Yes she would. [For once, &
c. 
Now when he sang three songs, 
This comic " Pro " came, and at our table sat, 
So of course I 
quickly let him know, 
That I 
was not a 
flat; 
But, when he found Amelia took his part, 
Of course high words arose, 
He shot out his fist like a 
dart, 
And hit me on the nose. 
Spoken.—Which I 
did not relish. 
But I 
returned the blow, and with such force 
That knocked him off his feet, 
But of course the waiters took his part, 
And kicked me into the street ; 
And it is about three months ago, 
And as yet I 
have not Seel], 
Anything of that comic " Pro," 
Or false Amelia Green.

Prico lu cents. 
Oh dear me ! these are troubleust mos, 
There really is no seein' 
Which is the best locality 
" 
To be or not to he in." 
Tax gatherers stand on ey'ry hand, 
With arms outstretched to collar US; 
And take away our dimes. by means 
of which our miens are Dolorous. 
CHORUS. 
And it's oh ! dear, oh! 
We're all going tip in a 
Balloon 
As high as we can go. 
On ey'ry side there seems to glide 
A spirit of dejection; 
To think the only food ihat's cheap 
Is food for our reflection. 
But if things should much higher go, 
To reach them we'll be flustered ; 
For we'll only just be 
wor Ii our salt," 
When all our funds are Mustered. 
And it's oh ! dear, oh ! Sze. 
But our consciences are getting seared, 
Eaeh day we grow more callous; 
Our gals are all less buoy oils, 
And our boys all more galls. 
And that the unfe. to husband her supplies, 
Finds it bewilderir' 
Whilst the father finds his " Uncle" 
Is apparent to the Children. 
Ana it's oh ! dear, oh ! &c 
There's not a 
business in the laud 
But of the times afraid is ; 
And even Hackney Coachmen say 
Its at a 
stand their trade is. 
And milkmen, When we ask for cream, 
All tell us we must stop a 
bit ; 
Because the milk has " riz" so high 
The cream can't get—atop of it.

Chopfallen thus the ,

His " rib" grows spare and slender; 
W ith " heaps " of little tender loins 
But nary legal tender. 
And it's oh! dear, oh ! 
The Baker rolls his eyes, and twists 
his head at doleful " Clackers ;" 
Bat never in his fancy bred 
Such times its these for Crackers. 
And tho' he's not a

Shoemakers say ( poor souls) its bootless

They know their all won't last till 
"Dead men's shoes" relief are giving. 
The Doctors lose their patience 
And for physic— they might make it; 
And ' throw it to the Dogs,' but well 
They know the dogs won't take it. 
And it's oh ! dear,oh! &c. 
They've taxed our stages and our cars,

They've taxed our lights, and probably

And it's oh! dear, oh ! & c. 
But where's the use of grumbling 
At the fiddler or the fifer ; 
When it's well known that all who dance 
Must surely pay the piper. 
So let's support the Government, 
And cry, " Long live the President ;" 
Thankful, as yet no income tax 
Debars an Alms House resident.

THE STYLE IN WHICH IT'S DONE. 
As Snug by BILLY Gown:v. 
1 
stand before you once again, 
A few words just to say; 
The subject of my song Fm sure, 
We each meet every day. 
Some men live fast and others slow, 
As through the world we run ; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be 
brought to book; 
While another man across a 
hedge 
Is not allowed to look. 
This may seem contradictory, 
Indeed, to many a 
one; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
The politician speechifies, 
And makes a 
great hurrah, 
Till another man he mounts the stand, 
And points out every flaw. 
lie gets the nomination, 
And for Congress he tines run ; 
tinceeeds and laughs to think he knows 
The style in vlueli it's done. 
Now has it ne'er occurred to you, 
How strange the mystery seems; 
That girls can dash along _Broadway, 
Who scarce are in their teens? 
Their pas are poor, but still they dress. 
In a 
style that's number one. 
But I 
suppose it all depends upon 
'The style in Nvhich it's done. 
I 
think I'll conclude my song. 
Perhaps you'll say ; 
it's time," 
But I 
hope that I 
have pleased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
Some may think it is too slim% 
And others it's too long : 
But very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done.

If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

CASTLES IN THE AIR.. 
As 
sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing- here but troubles, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
.`-nd at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
Wo are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
-Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the- 
Air. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
When first his plays came en the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, whiles building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each /sentiment so true ; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as if you had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles inthe Air. 
But yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scotti.sh heart, ' twill make the blood to 
And though this world to him had been, a 
world full of care; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was seen. 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean ; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Peon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sore. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Th011las Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he had his share, 
Yet M. ) ore was always happy, building Castles in th 
Air. 
Pe sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrolv.:4, 
And many loving Trish hearts, wil' cherish yet ilk: 
He made the Trish heart rejoice, he, bade thrin ne'cr despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air.

BEAUTIFUL ARABELLA. 
Miss Arabella Winkletop 
Was daughter to a 
Plumber, 
As bright and fair as birds that hop 
Upon the trees in summer, 
The hearts of lovers couldn't she rend, 
And didn't she look the cheese ? 
Oh ! couldn't she do the " Grecian,bend," 
And didn't she try to please ? 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful Arabella, 
Beautiful Arabella, 
She stole my heart, and made me smart, 
Did beautiful Arabella. 
I 
took her to all sorts of fetes, 
Cremorne and Crystal Palace; 
We also crossed the Dover straits, 
To Dieppe, Boulogne and Calais, 
Where'er we went she fixed the gaze 
Of swells in Music halls ; 
Their hearts she moved, and always proved 
A magnet in the stalls. 
81,07,-cn.-011! she was it beauty ! and so graceful ! 
nearly broke my heart trying to walk in her alleetion-, 
and I 
nearly broke my back trying to do the 
Roman 
Fall," walking in her company. 
Beautiful Arabella, &: e. 
y 
heart with love was glowing hot, 
As forty Blacksmiths' forges, 
And soon I 
hoped to tie the knot 
Connubial. at Sr. George's; 
BEAUTIFUL ARABELLA —[CONCLUDED. 
But aim ! that " slip—'twixt cup and lip," 
With which so many meet, 
It fell to me—and here you see 
The victim of deceit. 
Beautiful Arabella. & c. 
To the Easter 'Volunteer Review, 
Of " Period" crack Rifles, 
Niss A., she went, escorted too, 
By Captain Blazer Bifles, 
Her Dad— the Plumber— thought it grand, 
A titled swell should win, 
Instead of me, his daughter's hand, 
As I 
had little tin. 
Spoken.— Ah ! it often happens, if a 
fellow's got a 
handle 
to his name, Om' he's a 
pump himself he can throw cold 
water on a 
rival ; such was the case Nvith me. But l 
ill, I 
shall never forget 
Beautiful Arabella, Su% 
She's his, but p'rhaps might have been mine— 
This daughter of the Plumber— 
Had I 
been in the soldering line, 
If only a 
boy drummer. 
The uniform, it did the trick, 
And won her fickle heart; 
Now what girl in my heart will stick 
Another Cupid's dart ? 
Spoken.—Tho', If I 
can't change my gold.] mean to 
change my note, and say " undutiful!" instead of— 
Beautiful Arabella, 4k e.

those we have managed to 
take; 
So don't be too proud, and 
- 
L 
don't crow too loud, For that's where you make the mis 
take. 
Don't imagine youtil ineet with a 
bobby, 
Whene'er there's a 
row in the street; 
Don't imagine you'll find a 
fishmonger 
Declare that his fish tine not sweet; 
(1) 
THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell, 
A 
book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the fam'ly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shako: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you xvike the mistake.

THE AMERICAN BAR, IN THE STRAND. 
There's plenty of traps in London town 
For luring silly men, 
And it doesn't take a 
fellow long 
To fall in the lion's den. 
A famous place for Yankee drinks, 
From Somerset House not far, 
Where weary swells may quench their thirst 
Is the American Bar. 
CHORUS. 
The American Bar, in the Strand, 
The American Bar, in the Strand, 
I 
lost my tin through going in 
The American Bar, in the Strand. 
At the American Bar one day,

One seem'd a

A " Brandy Smash," a Lightning flash," 
A " Sling," or a " Sangaree !"

We spoke, in confidential chat, 
About each others aims ; 
Talked po:ities, and got, from that,

I 
also grew extremely wild. 
To hear John Bull abused.

for nothing didn't care,

" 
No riot here we'll stand,"

I'M SORRY I MADE THE REM 
ARR. 
As Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I'm careful whenever I 
open my lips, 
And know pretty well what I'm at ; 
But a 
word now and then from the best of us slips, 
And I'm no exception to that. 
A 
careless expression, no matter how slight, 
Is taking a 
leap in the dark ; 
So if I 
transgress, I 
freely confess, 
I'm sorry I 
made the remark. 
I 
say, "'t 
was a 
joke," 
" 
I 
regret that I 
spoke," 
Or, " I'm sorry I 
made the remark." 
A 
fancied indignity often will cause 
A man to fall out with his friend ; 
And then in a 
passion he flies to the laws, 
Ills wounded self-love to defend. 
He seeks his attorney, and says, " For revenge, 
All my fortune I'll gladly embark;" 
But when he has lost, and has reckoned the cost, 
He's sorry he made the remark. 
He finds it no joke, 
He regrets that he spoke, 
He's sorry he made the remark. 
A dandy will meet with a 
damsel so sweet, 
That he offers all cost to defray; 
To the opera, perhaps, or in smartest of traps, 
To Long Branch go for the day. 
But if this gay youth—as is often the truth, 
Is only a 
poor city clerk; 
By the_time he takes flight to his garret at night, 
lie is sorry he made the remark. 
To his uncle he goes, 
With his best suit of clothes, 
And he's sorry he made the remark. 
[1] - 
I'M SORRY I MADE THE REMARK.-rCONCLUDED. 
A 
bachelor often will jeeringly say, 
That Cupid will never wound him; 
Or at least, if he does, he will have his own way, 
And gratify every whim. 
Hell perch-Ince say his bride must be slim and beside 
Her beautiful eyes must be dark; 
But when he gets fond of a 
plump little blonde, 
lie's sorry he made the remark-. 
He'll say, 't 
was a 
jest," 
But it must be confessed, 
lie's sorry he made the remark 
A 
troubtesome tailor will send you his bill 
And " touching that little account ;" 
Hell plainly inform you he must, and he will 
Immediately have the amount. 
But if by a 
chance you can pay him at once, 
Of his valor there isn't a 
spark; 
He says " I 
was rash, I 
don't want the cash," 
"I'm sorry I 
made the remark." 
It was foolish to make, 
Such a 
stupid mistake, 
And I'm sorry I 
made the remark." 
The lover is wooing the girl of his heart, 
And plumps himself down on his knees'; 
lie joyfully hears her consent to take part 
Of his home, and his bread, and his cheese. 
The, fragrance he sips from her pretty red lips, 
And he's happy and blithe as a 
lark, 
But ere two years elapse, he'll discover, perhaps, 
He is sorry he made the remark. 
He'll sigh, and confess 
He's got into a 
mess, 
And he's sorry he made the remark.

THE RETIRED PHYSICIAN. 
Now, white folks, listen unto my song, 
A lovely ditty I'll sing for you, 
rn sing it so loud, so you all can hear, 
And play it upon de banjo, too. 
It's all about a 
retired physician. 
Whose sands of life had near run out; 
For. the Sunday papers got down upon him, 
And his business all went up the spout. 
Oh ! he wrote for Branch's Alligator, 
And paragraphs for the New-York Tribune, 
He cured every ill in human nature, 
And made funny Nvoodeuts for the Picayune. 
Ile pulled out teeth for a 
shilling a 
dozen, 
Sold wooden legs made of Jersey bark, 
lie was father-in-law to the four cent man, 
That sells enwellopes round the Park. 
He made Brandeth's pills of castile soap, 
Which used to sell very well in a 
crowd 
lie inwented a 
cylinder escapement shower bath, 
Which used to make him feel so proud. 
But the Sunday Leader exposed him quite, 
And he'll have .a 
speedy revenge he vows, 
So he's gone to Brooklyn out of spite. 
And opened an office for stump tail cows.

A beautiful erature was Teddy O'Lynch;

He left all his fri'nds and relations in Cork, 
And sailed in a

And whin his feet touched on American gt ound, 
A

So nearly cleaned out was our Teddy. 
'A slain' I" says Teddy—" sure that isn't much;

Such a 
jinerous b'y was our Teddy. 
'Twas the time whin the North and the South had a 
foight, 
And vor poundin aiteh other from mornin' till night; 
And Teddy be shtumbled right into a 
din 
Where a 
Federal sarjint was lookin' for min— 
'Twas a 
bit of good luck for our Teddy. 
Says the sarjint to Teddy,. " A h'y like yerself 
Should rush to the battle regardless of pelf; 
But yell give you good wages, an' fightin' aich day, 
And three hundred dollars for bounty I'll pay," 
And he flirted the greenbacks at Teddy.

"Is there half so much money in all the wide world ? 
Sure glory's inticing ; so give me your fisht, 
And the three hundred down, an,' head ! Ill inlisht— 
So ready for foight was our Teddy. 
Then down to the wilderness Teddy he wint,

Or marchin,' or fightit, or any such sport,

But his own skin was safe, so a

Says Teddy, " Be jahers, it's warm here," says he; 
So alone by himself he took Gineral Lee— 
And he ended the war, did our Teddy. 
And but for cur Teddy, historians say, 
The North and the South ud be foighin to-day 
So the Govermint gave him—he losht his right leg— 
A

So grateful they WOr to our Teddy. 
"Och musha !' says Teddy, " a

And he opened a

My dear boys, I'd like you to see, 
A 
pretty little girl that I 
fell in love with 
I'm sure with me you would agree 
That she is just the style. 
My thoughts on her are solely bent— 
I 
met her quite by accident, 
It was one evening when I 
went 
For a 
dance to the Argyle. 
My lovely dancing Rose. 
Round the room she goes— 
And everywhere the people stare 
At beautiful dancing Rose. 
I 
had not long been in the room 
Looking for a 
partner to have a 
dance with, 
I 
turned and spied up by my side 
A damsel standing close. 
said, " Beg pardon will you dance?" 
She turned and gave me such a 
glance, 
Said: " yes I 
and glad to get chance 
For, they call me dancing Rose."

It is useless to niop_ o'er our troubles all day, 
And to rail at the lot we inherit ; 
Bear in mind that success is the crown of hard work, 
And we all have fltr more than we merit ; 
Though the past has been dark,though the present is drear, 
And a 
storm o'er the future be brewing; 
Bright sunshine will smile ere a 
very long while, 
if you'll only he up and be doing. 
CHORUS . 
Then get up with the lark, and to work like a 
man, 
The dictates of conscience pursuing, 
And to o'ercome the strrfe in the battle of life, 
Never yield, but be up and be doing. 
Never think it beneath you to dirty your hands, 
Should duty require you to do so ; 
But ready and willing take things as they come, 
And fear nothing like Robinson Crusoe ; 
As you steadily plod o'er lile's dangerous road, 
The chart of the past keep reviewing ; 
Yet while you look back o'er the desolate track, 
Still keep traveling on and be doing. 
Then get up with the lark, &c. 
The drop that is constant will wear out the stone; 
So, if fortune is slow to reward you. 
Be cheerful and patient. and toil on in life, 
And your conscience approving, will guard you; 
Make hay while the sun of your youth brightly shines, 
Or else all your life you'll be rueing 
The time you have spent and the chances you've lost, 
So don't fret, but be up and be doing. 
Thea get up with the lark, &c. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a

Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game-lowls, fine and. tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of alL 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle. 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show. 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-picled race— 
Ben-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If yon peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys," 
It was cackle, tie. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show, 
It was enotle, &a.

OH, SMILE, SWEET LOVE. 
Oh, smile, sweet love, there's a 
magic in thy glances, 
A charm more potent than I 
e'er can say; 
A 
spell my very spirit that entrances, 
And makes me think my darkest moment day. 
I 
cannot help confessing, 
That I'm si eTbound 'neath thy dreamy eyes, 
That beam like holy angels giving blessing, 
And shine like lovely stars in boundless skies. 
Oh, smile, sweet love, I 
cannot feel faint-hearted, 
When thou art by my side—my lot to cheer; 
Tho' all else good on earth may seem departed, 
The world is always bright when thou art near 
Oh ! smile, sweet love, methinks that thou art given, 
To cheer me when the cares of life annoy ; 
To make my journey here a 
path to heaven, 
Oh, smile, sweet love, and life will all be joy.

NEVER GO BACK ON YOUR WORD. 
Oh, white folks, I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
If you will listen to my little song, 
And if it don't please it's a 
pity, 
And I 
promise to not keep you long, 
The subject of my song it is wholesome, 
The music no doubt you have heard, 
And I 
promised to sing vou a 
new one, 
And I'll never go back on my word. 
There was Old Hickory Jackson, 
At the battle of New Orleans, 
It was there he gave General Packenham 
The best of his good Yankee beans, 
lie says now boys we must whip them, 
And he looked at his trusty old sword, 
lie gave them gunpowder and cotton, 
And he did not go back on his word 
In the days of the old revolution, 
Or in the days of old seventy-six, 
Our ccuotry was in a 
commotion, 
And the British were playing dirtv tricks,

To drive off tl:at tyrannical horde,

And easily through life I 
glide, 
'Tis always the best I 
find, 
To carry my troubles cheerfully,

For what's the use of looking back, 
Or giving way to sorrow, 
The skies to-day that looks so black, 
May brighter be to-morrow. 
'Tis easy to drive dull care away, 
It you've the strength of mind, 
To carry your troubles cheerfully; 
And never look behind. 
In journeying 'long the road of Life, 
You'll surely meet with many 
A man who'll throw an X away, 
Because he's lost a 
penny, 
And wander from the beaten track, 
As if he felt inclined, 
To look for some new trouble, 
Which he inig-ht have left behind.

A fortune in a

And if they don't succeed at once, 
Will fret and fume and worry. 
What can't be cured must be endured, 
Is a 
maxim old and true, 
Don't care for care, then rest assured, 
That care won't care for you. 
For what's the use of looking back, &c. 
In life at times we must expect 
To meet with things unpleasant, 
We can't recall the time that's past, 
But may improve the present.

My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
PI:is the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, etc. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously toy kindred wait, 
And watch for my return : 
For death that levels all alike. 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid tke fire and damp may strike 
And ding his darts at me. 
Down in a 
coal mine, 6to. 
How little do the great ones care 
Wi,o sit at home secure, 
What hidden danzers colliers dare— 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansdons boast 
To cheer thetoselves and wives, 
Ilayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &s. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye min 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man ; 
rrowever fortune terns about 
We'll stil be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &e. 
OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN, 
INTO THE FIRE. 
Pity my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What l've put up with you would not suppose, 
flow I've been treated and snubbed all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song ; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
In the last form I 
continued to nest, 
Getting well flogged when I 
tried to rise higher, 
Twas out of the frying pan into the are. 
ctionus. 
Out of the frying pan, out of the frying pan, 
Perhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire. 
Out of the frying-pan, out of the frying-pan, 
Out of the frying-pan, into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
bachelor's life, 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
cherub's that sits up aloft. 
Oh ! how 1 
picture our lives free from care, 
Happy as Dicky-birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria 
Twas out of the frying-p . 11 jute the fire. 
Out of the frying pan, (Ix. 
Denting on children, to badies endeared, 
Happy was I 
when first twins appear'd 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
Somehow or other I 
wasn t 
so glad ; 
Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see. 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did I 
ever to marriage aspire 
Twas out of the frying-pan into the fire. 
Once I 
bought shares in a 
line that they made, 
Twenty per cent was the dividend paid, 
Crash went the bubble, my savings entire, 
Went Out of the frying-pan into the fire.

DRESSED IN A DOLLY VARDEN. 
Written and Composed by G. W. M OORE. 
HE WILL NEVER JOIN HIS PLAYMATES 
AGAIN. 
The ev'ning was fair ere the sun went down, 
Not a 
cloud in the blue sky was seen, 
And all look'd gay in the bright little town, 
When the village lads play'd upon the green, 
The sound of their mirth reach'd a 
poor little child, 
On a 
lone bed of sickness and pain, 
He heard them and said, as so sadly he smird, 
" 
I 
shall ne'er join my playmates again." 
Then gently they rais'd him that he might see 
Where he play'd in the days that were pass'd, 
And he said, " Dear friends, pray tell them from me, 
They were thought of and lov'd to the last." 
The nightingale's song in the distant tree, 
And the rivulet's murmur so gay, 
With the sounds of mirth were borne on the breeze, 
To the room where the little boy lay; 
But he heard them not for so soundly he slept, 
They might try to awake him in vain, 
And his friends well knew, as so sadly they wept, 
He would ne'er join his playmates again. 
Then softly they stole from the room so drear, 
And their hearts were with sadness o'er 
ast, 
When they told his friends and playmate... 
dear, 
They were thought of and lov'd to the last. 
I 
know in this world there is plenty of strife, 
Each morning some trouble discloses; 
I 
know we all find in the garden of life, 
A 
fair share of thorns with the roses. 
But if we face trouble we surely shall see, 
'Twill soon disappear altogcher; 
An. American's boast it ever should be, 
He never has shown the white feather. 
CHORUS. 
Don't show the white feather! don't show the white feather 
Tho' danger and trouble perplex you together, 
Don't show the white feather, tho' stormy the weather, 
An American never should show the white feather. 
When debtors and duns both annoy and perplex, 
And grief casts a 
shadow of sorrow; 
When fortune so fickle does nothing but vex, 
Then hopefully wait for the morrow. 
Although it may be dark at the close of the day, 
The dawn may bring forth brighter weather; 
Keep on persevering, but don't let folks say, 
You ever have shown the white feather. 
Don't show, dr,c. 
In love as in war you must never turn back, 
Altho' your chance may appear shady; 
If beaten at first yet renew the attack, 
For faint heart ne'er won fair lady. 
The battle of life ever falls to the brave, 
You'll get to the end of the tether; 
And win the good fight, if you boldly behave, 
So never, boys, show the white feather,

PARODY ON TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
I 
wandered by the village, Tom— 
I 
sat beneath the tree ; 
And gazed upon that dear old jail, 
That oft sheltered you and me. 
But none was there to bail me out, 
At least they told me so; 
I 
was not acquainted with the judge, 
Like twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered some, dear Tom, 
It's larger now than then ; 
It's cells are twice as wide, dear Tom, 
To accommodate more men. 
The bell is there that used to ling, 
When to work we had to go ; 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom 
As twenty years ago. 
The boys are at the same old game, 
Of hooking on the sly ; 
They stole a 
ham the other night, 
'Twos oft done by you and I. 
They're gambling, too, for money, Tom, 
At seven-up, you know ; 
That good old game we loved so well 
Just twenty years ago. 
Down by the spring, close to the elm, 
You know poor William Way ; 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, 
I 
saw him yesterday. 
Some wretch has kicked his stuffing out, 
lies dying, sure but slow ; 
Just as the one you wolloped so, 
Died twenty years ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, 
But tears came to my eyes ; 
When I 
think upon that good old hash 
And those dear old mutton pies. 
I 
went into Poet's to get a 
drink, 
But, Tom, I 
started so, 
I 
had flurry red-i was dead broko-
Like twenty years ago. 
YOU SHOULD SEE THEM DANCE AT THE GAY` 
MABILLE. 
My name is spicy George, 
A Whitechapel Coster— that's me, 
I've made so much money with turnips and beans, 
I 
thought I'd go on a 
spree ; 
Not drinking with vas in the East, 
Bat something a 
little genteel, 
So pack'd up my ( lothes—off to Paris I 
went 
To visit the gay Alabille. 
Spoken—Arrived in Paris, done the Whitechapel heavy in a 
most 
respectable style until I 
reached the place where— 
You should see them dance, 
At the gay Alabille, 
Zig. zig, zig, soug, song, song, 
Never, never still—zig ! 
When I 
arriv'd in Franco, 
There was no fellows dress'd like me, 
The swells they thought this Wuitechapel cut, 
Was the fashion that was to be. 
I 
look'd round about for a " pub I" 
But no public-hose could I 
see, 
I 
long'd for a 
quart of my English beer, 
But I 
had to drink coffee and tea. 
Spoken—Cruelty to animals, no beer, no cooper, couldn't I 
have done 
justice to Barclay and Perkins. A lady said to me, '' Como ong do 
parte volts, Musseer 1" I 
thought she said, " Come and have a 
quart 
of beer l" but never mind— 
You should see, &c. 
I 
danc'd with the hOes there, 
The money it flew by the load, 
Away went my profit on turnips and peas 
I'd made in the AVhitechapel road. 
Mv sweetheart that I 
loft behi. d 
In London. I 
now will reveal, 
She'd torn all their bonnets if she'd seen me dance 
With those belles Lt the gay Mabille. 
Spoken—When I 
came back I 
taught my Sarah to dance the Can.

PRETTY POLLY BANGLE ; 
OR, MANGLING DONE HERE. 
Written and composed by G. W. Ift:.NT. 
I'm a 
flower cut down in the bloom of my youth, 
And all through a 
damsel who spoke not the truth; 
In a 
snug little house lived the one 1 
held dear, 
And over the door it said, " Mangling done here." 
Whenever I 
pass,d pretty Polly l'd see, 
A-turning her mangle, which quite mangled me, 
To think such sweet hands such hard work endured, 
And thus 'twas I 
loved her, and would not be cured. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty Polly Bangle 
Used to turn a 
mangle, 
But she's sold her old mangle and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of Camden Town. 
One day I 
spoke to her, with love did I 
burn, 
Said I, you look tired, miss, let me have turn : 
She smiled a 
consent, and to work I 
did go, 
low long I 
was at it I 
really don't kuow; 
I 
soon felt fatigued, but I 
didn't care, 
I'd have turned for a 
month her sweet presence to share., 
At last I 
fell on my knees and while on the floor, 
told her I 
loved her and would evermore. 
Pretty Polly Bangle 
Used to turn a 
mangle, 
But she's sold her old mangle and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of Whitechapel Road. 
[1 } 
PRETTY POLLY BANGLE. [CONTINUED. 
I'd go there every day, and I'd turn for my life, 
At length she consented that she'd be my wife ; 
I 
was happy until 1 
was told one find day, 
Someone else turned her mangle when I 
was away. 
I 
told pretty Polly the tale I 
had heard, 
She said, 'twas redekclus, horful, habsurd ;" 
Said I, I've your promise and hope you're sincere, 
For if I've a 
rival, there'll be Mangling done here. 
(Pugilistic Mangling.) 
Pretty Polly Bangle, 
Used to turn a 
Mangle, 
But she's sold her old Mangle and bought a 
Piano, 
And married the Marquis of Bloo 
bury Square. 
After that she appeared to quite change in her manner, 
She sold her old Mangle and bought a 
Planner, 
Now, I 
couldn't turn that, and—ah, me, one day, 
I 
found her lions° closed and my love gone away; 
They say she's retired from mangling for life, 
That some Duke or some Marquis has made her his wlfe 
So I 
sighs and I 
mourns, and oft drop a 
tear, 
When 1 
think of my love, and the Mangling done here. 
(Mangling of the heart.) 
Pretty Polly Bangle, 
Used to turn a 
Mangle, 
But she's sold her old Mangle and bought a 
Piano, 
And married the Marquis of I3lackfriars Bridge.

BROKEN DOWN. 
Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seems to know me, 
I'm completely broken down 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frarD, 
No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to 
fast' instead.

The immortal Shakespeare 
Says,

How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I

Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat, 
But when I 
had no 'Note to change:

I 
wander thro' the town, 
A 
living paradox am I, 
'

I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a

The time to try your friends you'll end, 
Is when you're broken down. 
I'LL GO AND ENLIST FOR A SAILOR. 
List! oh list! to my sorrowful lay, 
Attention give to my song, I 
pray ; 
And when you've heard it all, you'll say 
That I'm " an unfortunate tailor." 
I 
once was as happy as a 
bird on a 
tree, 
My Sarah was all in the world to me ; 
But I'm cut out by a 
son of the sea, 
She has left me here to bewail her. 
ClIORUS. 
Oh! why did my Sarah serve me so 
No more will I 
stitch, no more will I 
sew; 
My thimble and my needle to the winds I'll throw, 
And go and enlist for a 
sailoi. 
My Sarah was the daughter of a 
publican, 
A geu'rous, kind, good sort of a 
man ; 
-Who spoke very plain what he thought of a 
man, 
But he never look'd cross at the tailor. 
My Sarah was as tall as a 
poplar tree, 
As fair as a 
lily, and as brisk as a 
bee; 
And many were the smiles that she sminl on me, 
Oh ! why am I 
left to bewail her ? 
! 
why did & c. 
My days were happy and my nights the same, 
Till a 
man nam'd Cobb fi om the ocean came ; 
With a 
big black beard and a 
muskilar frame, 
A captain on board of a 
wh her. 
Ile spent his money so frank and free, 
With his tales of the land and his songs of the sea 
lie stole my Sarah's heart f 
oin me. 
And blighted the hopes of the tailor! 
Oh! why did, &c. 
I 
went to plead. but she did refuse, 
She lov'd another so I 
must excuse 
caodor; but it was no use, 
She never could marry a 
tailor. 
When telling my love, in came that " Cobb," 
Who cried, " Avast there, you lubberly swab ! 
If you don't belay. I'll scuttle your nob." 
And Sarah smiled at the tailor. 
_Oh 1 
why did, & e. 
And so I'll cross the raging sea, 
Since Sarah is untrue to me ; 
My heart's lock'd up. and she's the key— 
A very unfeeling jailor. 
Farewell, kind friends, a 
last adoo, 
No more my woes shall trouble you: 
The world I'll wander through and through, 
I'll go and enlist for a 
sailor. 
Oh! why did, azt.

THE DIAMOND TAKE THE HEART. 
Ala:—" Wearing of the Green." 
Kind friends I 
come to sing a 
song of what I 
do not know, 
Unless it is of what you've seen in the news some days ago; 
If there's some that have not seen it, and studied well its part, 
I 
now tell them its title is—" The diamond takes the heart." 
You'll find it so in every place, whether you're good or bad, 
No matter if you're homely, if you but own a 
nag; 
And have plenty of money, why strangers will take your part, 
And say you're a 
good fellow, for the diamond takes the heart. 
You may be a 
noted vagabond, and have just knocked off the link, 
In a 
minute you're an honest man, if you but show the chink; 
And if a 
courting you should go, and cupid sends his dart, 
Though bad you be, if you've money, you're sure to win her heart: 
Mind I 
do not say in every case, that this is sure to pass; 
But nine-tenths I 
know will have you for your money in a 
mass. 
Shell not have you if you've on poor clothes, no matt'er if you're 
smart, 
Put a 
good rig on, she'll die for you—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now when a 
man gets about forty, young girls will laugh at him 
And say he's an old fogy, and but a 
played out limb. 
They'll make all sorts of fun of him, and if he should propose, 
We may expect to hear the young girl say, " old man go wipe 
your nose." 
If his mouth does stretch from ear to ear, or if a 
byword be his 
name; 
Or if he has no principle, or is broken down and lame; 
Or if he's forced to wear a 
wig, or on his nose there'd be a 
wart: 
Yet if he's rich, why she'll have him—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now I 
think I've proven in my song, all what I've said is true: 
Yet still I 
hope and pray, it may never happen to you. 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat, 
You'll find an honest heart, beneath, and staunch as a 
life-boat, 
Then if you are a 
young girl, love him because he's poor ; 
He may be rich one of these days, then can you wish for more ? 
Or if a 
young man you may be, then take her, do not start, 
Altho' she's poor, let it ne'er be said, that the diamond took the 
heart. 
ICILL OR CURE. 
I'm a 
roving Irish boy, I 
was born in Ballaragban, 
And christened with much joy, after my father, Patrick Faghan ; 
I 
had a 
sweetheart Kitty, and I 
courted her so gaily, 
Devil a 
thought had I 
of trouble, as I 
twisted my shelalagh. 
ClIORUS• 
Muslin, Kitty O'Shaughnessy, she's the girl for me, 
Whack fal de daddy, musha O'Shaughnessy. 
Oeh, ' twas herself I 
courted, a 
girl so neat and cosy, 
She said she loved me in return—her cheeks were red and rosy; 
Of sovereigns I 
had twenty, says she, I've seventeen, 
Faith, well join ourselves and them together, and live like king 
and queen. 
Musha, ttc. 
So we both set sail for Liverpool, and packed our kits together, 
And married got so neat and cool, in spite of wind and weather; 
With our money we opened a 
shop, in business not amiss, 
We sold oysters, haddocks, mac'ral, mussels, praties, and fried 
fish. 
Musha, (17c. 
In business we did well, till one day she was taken ill, sirs, 
And the doctor almost ruined inn by sending in his bill, sirs; 
So I 
made a 
bargain with him, " kill or cure," for twenty pounds 
so frisky, 
He was a 
dacent sort, so I 
thought I'd stand a 
noggin of Irish 
whiskey. 
Musha, dze. 
But she grew worse and worse, which made me quake with fear, 
sir, 
The doctor he attended her for more than half a 
year, sir; 
Till one fine morn she died, and myself i did bewilder, 
And the doctor he wanted his twenty pounds, ( spoken) says 
I, you never cured her! 
No, says he—then says I, (singing) you dare not say you 
killed her 
Musha, & c. 
So gentlemen enjoy themselves, the whiskey drink like thunder, 
You cannot help but own yourselves, there's mirth in an Irish 
blunder; 
But when for your wives a 
doctor you want, mind and yer be sure, 
Make the bargain as I 
did myself, wid the doctor, ‘• kill or cure.' 
Musha,

ITS A SORT OF THING YOU READ ABOUT. 
Words by GEORGE Coormt. 
I'm going to sing a 
little song, 
If you will list to me; 
It's not too short and not too long; 
But that you'll quickly see. 
I 
don't say my song will please you, 
Tho' your verdict I 
don't fear; 
In fact, its a 
sort of song you read about 
But very seldom hear. 
Now, politics are all the rage, 
And bribes are changing hands; 
On either side it's just the same 
No matter how it stands. 
I 
don't say, among politicians, 
That no honesty can be, 
And yet it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
Divorces are the fashion now, 
Chicago is the place 
Where, if a 
man don't like his spouse 
He goes to charge his base. 
There are many wedded people, 
Who, of course, in peace agree; 
But then, it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
The girls are trying hard to vote 
And Nvear the breeches, too ; 
They're ! vying lmrd to Doctor us, 
But then,:twould never do. 
They would have us nurse the bal,ies, 
And to cook and ! oak" their tea, 
But then, its a 
sort of thing we read about 
And hope we 11 never see.
