THE OLD BROWN COT. 
Among the scenes to memory dear, 
To which my fancy oft returns 
And for those long-
lost days of joy 
My spirit in its sadness yearns— 
There's none which seems so dear to me 
As that where past life's early morn ; 
There's none for which I 
sigh so oft 
As for the cot where I 
was born. 
CI1OR Us. 
The old brown cot, the low brown cot, 
The moss-grown cot beneath the ; 
Though years have passed since I 
was there, 
I 
love it. oh ' I 
love it still I 
It stood beside the running brook, 
Whose waters turned the noisy mill • 
And close beside the tall old oaks, 
That nodded on the sloping hill. 
The woodbine creeping o'er the walls, 
The sunshine on the grassy plot; 
flow beautiful were they to me, 
When home was in that old brown cot 
The old brown cot, drc. 
hough I 
may -view the fairest land, 
On which the sun in glory beams; 
And dwell in climes more beautiful 
Than poets visit in their dreaing. 
Still with affection linger round 
That loved and consecrated spot; 
And tears will fall as I 
go back 
To boyhood and the old brown cot—

Oh have you seen my little girl ? 
She doesn't wear a 
bonnet ; 
She's got a 
monstrous flip flop hat 
With cherry ribbons on it. 
She dresses in bed furniture, 
Just like a 
flower garden ; 
A blowin' and a

They call it " Dolly Varden." 
ClIORUS. 
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly Varden 
Dresses like a 
little flower garden ; 
When she goes about, all the people shout, 
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly Varden." 
She started it one fatal day, 
Immediately, her mother, 
Whose weight is over sixteen stun, 
Rushed out and bought another. 
The cook, of course, must have one next, 
As bold as a

And now I'm bles'd if grandmother's 
Not got a " Dolly Varden."

DOLLY VARDEN.—[CoNcLuDED. 
To walk with them about the streets 
Is anything but jolly; 
When crowds of dirty little boys 
Will follow, shouting " Dolly !" 
I 
dare not pass a 
rag-shop now, 
My fate's indeed a 
hard un; 
The black dolls hanging up all seem 
To shout, " How's Dolly Varden?" 
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, &c. 
(rereome by Dolly Varden here, 
I 
rushed away to Brighton ; 
The frightful dress swarmed on the pier 
My shattered nerves to frighten. 
At Ramsgate, Searboro' and Boulogne, 
, And even Baden-Baden; 
was a 
wretched victim to 
, That awful " Dolly Varden." 
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, & c. 
I 
see it in my (hems at night. 
No rest I 
ever find, sirs; 
I've Dolly Varden on the brain, 
And chintz upon the mind, sirs. 
That fearful fashion haunts me now, 
I 
really beg your pardon ; 
But is there anybody here 
Who wears a " Dolly Varden ?”

DE SUBJECT

FELLOW remote descendants of de inhabitants ob de land

I'se 'peared afore yer dis ebenin' to 'cuss

rooster to scratch, de pigeon to coo, an' de cat to mew, de 
horse to neigh, an/ de jackass to bray an' shake himself, 
an' de human family to cut up more antics clan a 
chicken 
wid its head cut off ; an' dat am de subjeck ob lub. 
Der 
ar many kinds of lab ; dars de lab ob a 
madder, dat am de 
best; dar am de lub ob de family all freu ; an' den dere is' 
dat lub which makes so many oh de white people take cold 
poison, or blow off de top ob dare heads; and dat am de 
lab I'se gwine to 'cuss to-night. I

THERE'S SOMEBODY WAITING FOR ME. 
The moon's shining bright, and the stars give their light, 
And the evening invites us to stray, 
But in vain do 1 
talk of a 
bright moonlight walk,— 
I 
am here, and I 
can't get away. 
I'm a 
bird in a 
cage, and they say, " at my age."

can see 
In a 
walk in the cold, tho' the truth must be told, 
That there's somebody waiting for me. 
cuoncs. 
There's somebody waiting, there's somebody waiting, 
There's somebody waiting for me. 
They ask me to sing, and my music they bring, 
'Tis " Meet me by moonlight alone" again, 
And its getting quite late, and I 
know he wont wait, 
And he'll go if it comes on to rain. 
And now they propose all the shutters to close, 
As a 
form in the moonlight I 
see, 
But before they're aware I'll steal down the back stair, 
For there's somebody waiting for me. 
There's someboby waiting it:c 
DASHING YOUNG 
YOUNG GENT. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
As I 
through the Park, on a 
bright summer's day, 
Was leisurely walking to hear the band play, 
My thoughts for awhile were turned from the scene, 
As I 
passed the ramble near by the green, 
And on looking around, why, who should I 
see 
But a 
dashing young gent, who was winking at me. 
Oh, he looked so sweet, and he dressed so gay, 
With his pretty black moustache curled this way, 
And his jet black eyes ; oh, they Icoked so bright, 
And his features, too, were a 
most lovely sight; 
So I 
had to look around once more to see, 
When that dashing young gent gave a 
sweet smile at me. 
And if I 
was an old maid, I 
do declare 
The sight of that young gent would have made me stare, 
But the fun of it is I 
am not—much less, 
And what is more, I 
love it, I 
must confess; 
Oh, dear! he smiles: I 
will faint ; oh, no, not me; 
For that da,:hing young gent is in real love with me.

WHO'LL HAVE ONE FOR A SHILLING. 
No doubt there's many here that may 
have met with me before; 
My mission is to make you rich. 
And benefit the poor ; 
So come along and round me throng, 
All you that now are willing, 
You'll quickly make your fortune, if 
You'll speculate a 
shilling. 
Spoken.—Yes I've come here expressly to-night to make 
you all millionaires and Nabobs; I've only just returned 
from the diggings where I've been coleeting gold for the 
last forty years. Now all my pockets are filled with five 
pound notes, and I've got hats-full of sovereigns beside; 
which I'm willing to put in your possession if you'll only 
speculate. Now the way I 
distribute the coin is in these 
purses, and whoever buys one will never fear Fortune's 
reverses. 
Each one of these I 
now hold contains at least 
a 
piece of gold. 
CIMPXS. 
Who'll buy one, who'll buy one ? 
To serve you all I'm willing ; 
Who'll buy one, who'll buy one ? 
Who'll have this one for a ? 
Perhaps you think Pm joking, 
Or cheating you somehow; 
To prove that I'm in earnest, 
I'm going to fill one now, 
But you must be very careful, and 
To watch me you must try, 
For the quickness of the hand, 
Sometimes deceives the eye. 
I 
11 
WHO'LL HAVE ONE, 
&c.,— [CONCLUDED. 
Spoken.—Yes now I'm going to fill one with coin before 
you ; now take sights, there's no deception you know; 
now here's the purse and here's the coin ; now vardo ! one, 
two, three; not enough ? then here's one more—who'll have 
it, you ? sold again to a 
fat old lady who is just going 
round the corner to join Laburnum's Goose Club. 
Who'll buy, 
c. 
Sometimes I 
stand within a 
cart, 
And sometimes on a 
stool, 
The public with their pieces part, 
And think that I'm a 
fool ; 
But when they peep inside the purse, 
To see what they have bought, 
Although they find some coin, they think 
It's hardly the right sort. 
Spoken.—Yes, one old boy had the confounded cheek 
the other day to come back and tell me he'd only found a 
farthing in his purse instead of a 
sovereign, I 
said, " Buy 
another, old boy and don't open it till you get home. He 
did and when he got home what did he find in it ?—why 
Nanty ! 
Who'll buy, etc. 
visit all the races, 
I 
go to every fair, 
And while I 
play my little game, 
Oh ! don't the bumpkins stare ; 
But while the sun is shilling, 
My hay now I 
must make, 
For lately they're beginning 
To tumble to the fake. 
09pken.—Yes things are looking very queer lately, but 
here I'm going to try you once more for the last time. 
Now 
here we go again— more yellow boys. Now what person 
will take this purse in their possession? you 
Miss? Sold 
again to a 
young lady that is going to be married.

THE FORTUNE OF RALLY O'CONNOR, 
By T. RAMSAY. 
Ant :—" Och, Paddy, now can't you be Aisy." 
Och ! sure I'm not one of the fortunate lot, 
As I'll show you if you'll be belaying; 
All the wealth in the world that poor Rally has got, 
Sure there's nothing about me deceiving. 
And sure tho' I'm needy, 
I'm not at all greedy, 
I'm so bother'd I 
hardly know what to be at; 
After picking and choosing, 
Sure I'm nothing refusing, 
And I'm always contented if I 
don't get that. 
Spoken—Sure, and my first use in the world was falling in 
love wid a 
chap I 
don't like. 
Tho' Paddy was a 
mighty dacent 
good boy—so he was if he hadn't been such a 
blackguard—for 
he spent all his wages before he earned them, and gave me the 
remainder to keep house wid. 
The only shirt he'd got to his 
back was a 
pair of leather breeches, mad of an old blanket. 
Thin the only table we'd got was a 
three legged stool widout a 
top to it; a 
frying-pan widout a 
bottom ; an empty iron pot wid 
something in it, and that was a 
great hole; half-a- dozen knives 
widout blades, the only forks we had was an iron spoon, made 
of wood, wid a 
broken- winded bellus, a 
feather bed stuffed wid 
straw; then there was a 
pail to milk the cow we hadn't got, so I 
used to make a 
dust-hole of it to save window lights; there was 
an elegant poker that served us for a 
rolling pin and a 
street, 
door-key; a 
chopper, but so worn away that there was only the 
handle left. 
There was a 
teapot widout a 
nose, a 
bottle widout a 
mouth, that served us for a 
candlestick when we sit in the dark ; 
wid a 
bushel of inions in the rot, the potatoes hail got the de-
t
,cas, wid young Paddy had got the small- pox ; tlw pig had got 
the mazles, and I 
had got everything in the world J 
didn't wish 
to have. 
Och ! sure I'm not, aze.

FORTUNE OF RALLY O'CONNOR—[CoNcLunr,D.] 
Och I 
there are many more things I 
could mention I'm sure, 
But faith, what's the use of me fret,ing; 
The pleasure of trouble I've had to endure, 
Wid the change for the better worse gettin. 
'Twould drive some girls crazy, 
But I 
take it aisy, 
By the loss of my fortune sure worse luck I 
found ; 
But the little and great sure, 
Must all bow to fate sure, 
All those born to die, sure will never be drowned. 
Spoken—Sure, and that's true for me, for every change for the 
tetter kept getting worse, and the end of my troubles was the 
leginning of more. 
The rint run away wid the money, the rats 
nin away wid the cheese, the pig run away wid the pratie gar-
Jen, and to make it complate, Paddy run away wid Biddy 0' 
Shoeknasy, and left me a 
young widdy, for the only husband I 
had to my back was my own sister. 
Thin, one night about the 
middle of the morning the thieves broke into the house, by pick-
ing the back door at the front of the house, which had been left 
open by mistake made for the purpose, and tuck away every-
thing they did not leave behind thim. 
But the worst of all my 
troubles was the house taking fire; for I 
came home one day 
from market, and I 
found the house burned down to the ground, 
and the only furniture that was saved was destroyed. 
Och! 
there was my poor dear blind father crying his eyes out, and 
pulling all the hair off his bald head, to think he should ever 
have seen such a 
day. " Oa, Nora, Nora," said I, " why did 
you let this happen ?" " Sure," said she, " I 
couldn't extinguish 
it till after it was burnt down." " Arrah I" says I, " why didn't 
you put it out before it tuck light ?"

there are many things, (L

So pass along the gangway 
Onward quickly go, 
For when upon the tramway, 
You're the first you know ; 
Yes, whether to the city, 
Or go where'er you can, 
There's always lots of room, 
On the tram, tram, tram. 
There's oftentimes commotion, 
By the pressing of the knees, 
Some losing all their money, 
As they do a 
gentle squeeze, 
And then to see the fat ones, 
A running up behind, 
Like a 
ship in full sail, 
Bearing up against the wind.

'Twas only yesterday, 
As a

Dropp'd her crinoline so gay, 
To the grin of passers by;

IN THE BOWERY. 
TONY PASTOR'S great Sensation Song. 
AIR.— " 
This song has been called for nightly for months in succession and 
having been sung by Mr PASTOR in his own inimitable slyle, has been 
received with thunders of applause.] 
Some say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind; 
On Broadway and Fifth avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, your 
Fifth avenue swells, your exquisitely-dressed creatures, with 
their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do they know 
about enjoyment? They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for 
fear of disarranging their toilets; and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say ? " Charles Frederick Augustus is getting decidedly 
vulgar ; Seraphina Emelia is positively shocking !" 
But here in 
the flowery, people enjoy themselves just when they f(- el like it. 
They- don't care a 
curse what others may say, for that's the cus-
tom. 
CHORUS. 
In the flowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery. in the Bowery, 
That's were I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned ; 
Men who, to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on ether folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
.cpoken.—Yes, there is no place in. the flowery for those well-
dressed corner statues to try to look like millionaire's sons, while 
their mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to support 
them in idleness. 
A fellow has no business on the east side of 
town unless be wants to work and earn his own living.

The other day a 
well- dressed fop, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said. 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
Spoken. — Yes, he laid the cowardly rascal out. " Now," he 
says, " g,it up and git, and if ever I 
catch you insulting a 
female 
again I'll add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you." The 
dandy quietly sneaked away; the young lady turned to her 
preserver, with tears in her eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how 
can I 
ever thank you for the kindness which you have shown me 
in protecting me from the insults of that ruffian, and I 
hope, sir, 
we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ?" Certainly, young 
lady, 
always found— 
In the Bowery, eic. 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war Cerspread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among- the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still out starry flag, 
Was found the flowery boys. 
Spoken—When the call came for soldiers in the hour of danger, 
the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly did 
they do their duty. 
Who does not remember that incident at 
the battle of Anteatam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a 
terrific fire 
and changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of glorious vktory. 
This was noticed by General McClellan, who exclaimed ; " What

BLACKWELL'S ISLAND. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Ant.—" Ten Thousand Miles away." 
Sing I 
of a 
gallant Isle, my boys, not many miles away, 
Where there's lots of time for digging stone, and little time for play; 
Where we got no lush, but lots of mush, and they w'ollop you if you 
smile: 
It's opposite to Jones' Wood, and they call it Blackwell's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Judge fowling told me so, to Blackwell's Isle I'll go, 
Just, at Bellevue, 1'11 say adieu, to my true love so gay; 
For the steamboat now does wait, 
To carry me in state, 
And I'll stay for a 
while on Blackwell's Isle, 
Not many miles away. 
While buzzing in a 
Broadway stage, I 
met a 
country bloke, 
I 
faked his cly, so nice and sly, went through him for a 
joke, 
But a 
cop did drop, be caught me pop, he stagged my game in style, 
And they didn't send me to Ludlow street, but up to Blackwell's Isle, 
For the Judge, &c. 
When I'm at that summer resort, which aint much like Long Branch. 
How many a 
day I'll feel quite gay, could I 
vamoose the ranche ; 
When I 
think of my girl at Jones' Wood, with another cull waltzing 
gay, 
Then I'll teel 80 melancholy when the band begins to play. 
For the Judge, &c. 
When Jim Fislt's boats so gaily floats, close to the Tiellgate shore, 
And I 
think of the state- room I 
have cracked, and like to do once 
more ; 
Of the wallets fail I 
used to pull, with my well to work the pay, 
While all alone Pm breaking stone, from my pals so far away. 
For the Judge, & c. 
It I 
had my way on some fine day, I'd set the Tombs on fire, 
Such a 
flame I'd raise, and in the blaze I'd burn the Black Maria. 
Thu peelers, too, 141 catch the crew, and roast them on the pile ; 
And eseb jodgoe what lives, six moons I'd give way up at Blackwell's 
Isle.

We'd have 
all our own way the;,, and—

GINGER BLUE. 
Aiv name is Ginger Blue, and I 
tell you mighty true 
I 
come from old Tennessee Mountain, 
My paragraph is short, and my life it is as sweet, 
As de water dat flows from de fountain. 
De first word I 
said when I 
shoved up my bead 
To de darkies that lived on dat plantation. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
got on de ole plantation, why de first thing 
dat I found was all de little niggars a 
fighting ; but I 
just 
jumped in amongst 'em and I 
made 'em sing— 
CHORUS. 
Walk, chalk, Ginger Blue, 
Get ober double trouble, 
For its ole Virginny never tire. 
One night Clem Green was a 
gwine to give a 
hall, 
To de darkies that lived in that quarter, 
And says he, Ginger Blue, if you'll come down and dance, 
I'll let you marry my daughter ; 
He no sooner said the word den I 
was up like a 
bird, 
Which caused a 
kind of sensation. 
SroxEN.—When I 
got to de ball de first thing tint I 
found 
was a 
great big nigger a 
making love to my gal, but I 
just 
walked up to him, and I said: Look here young man, if you 
don't clear out, and leave dat gal of mine be, I'll just, make you 
sing— 
Walk, chalk, Ginger Blue, etc. 
Now when de ball was done, all de darkies dey did run 
To take all de ladies home according, 
But Clem Green and me, why we both got on de spree, 
And never got home till de morning. 
He up wid a 
brick, and he gave me such a 
lick, 
Dat I 
never shall forget it till I 
die. 
SPOKEN. — But I just drew back dis way once and I 
made 
him sing— 
Walk, chalk, Ginger Blue, 
Get ober double trouble, 
For it's Virginity never tire 
Walk, chalk, Ginger Blue,

Decked with a 
feather, so neat and trim, 
Pretty rosette and bugle lace; 
Or with a 
saucily turned-up brim, 
None can resist its winning grace. 
Bright eyes, from out of it, glow more delightiugly, 
Soft lips, no doubt of it, pout more invitingly; 
Dimples look cosier, profiles completer are, 
Rosy cheeks rosier, everything sweeter far; 
Surely the man must be blind as a 
bat, 
Who's not in love with the little round hat. 
Hard is the fate of the maid, I 
trow, 
Much to be pitied her mournful lot, 
Who, wearing its ribbons, yet lacks a 
beau, 
Seeking but finding a 
true love not. 
Cross old maids, yearning all, laughed out of using it, 
Noses upturning, all fall to abusing it; 
"Bold is the mien in it," say they, while many sing, 
" 
Wouldn't be seen in it! no, not for anything." 
So they will tell you, but never mind that, 
All the world's wearing the little round hat.

ONE-RY, TWO-ERY, TICICERY SEVEN; 
OR, HIDE AND SEEK. 
As Sang by TONY resToR. 
I 
remember when a 
little boy I 
used to play a 
game 
Called " Hide and Seek," and even now, it still goes by 
that name ; 
We'd gather in a 
circle, those who wished to join in play, 
And who would hide and who would seek, settled in this 
way ; 
Spoken.—The boys all used to gather round, and the last 
boy had to seek those who were hiding. I 
remember I 
had a 
spite against one boy called Tommy Bouser. I 
used 
to manage always to make it count out, so that he had to 
seek. I 
remember I 
also gave that same boy a 
good hid-
ing; but the way we used to count was as follows:

Tiddletum, toddletum, twenty-one. 
Altho' grown up to man's estate, I 
can't forget the day, 
And very often settle things in that old-fashioned way ; 
For instance, now, my tailor brought his bill the other day 
The question to decide, then, was to pay or not to pay. 
,poken.—That was the question. " Look here, old fel-
low," said I, " suppose we count out. If you're out, I 
pay ; 
if I'm out, I 
don't pay ; and I 
sincerely hope that, not 
only now, but at anytime you change to call, that you 
may find me out." 
So I 
commenced, 
One-ry, two-cry, &e. 
Spoken.—I'm out; I 
don't pay. 
My father wanted me to wed a 
girl called Sarah Ann, 
She had some wealth, but I 
adored a 
simple girl called 
Fan ; 
" 
Well, look here, dad, I 
like to please you, that is if I 
can, 
[1] 
ONE-RY, TWO-ERY &e.—[CoNcLuDED. 
So I'll count out, whether I 
shall wed my love or Sarah 
Ann," 
Spoken.—I 
did love Fanny, and I 
couldn't bear Sarah ; 
so I 
got the two young ladies together; explained every-
thing; asked them if they were willing to abide by the 
result of my favorite way of settling things. 
They seemed 
satisfied, so I 
began with Sarah. 
One-ry, two-cry, & e. 
Spoken.— Fanny's out; go home, Sarah. 
For many years our married life has been serene and true, 
My better half I 
really think's the best I 
ever knew ; 
We have one or two little dears I 
love to see at play, 
And I 
have taught my eldest boy my favorite words to say. 
Spoken.—Yes, and often join in a 
game with them, too; 
you know we are but children of a 
larger growth. You 
should hear my little fellow lisp out— 
CHOItUS.—(Sung lispingly, imitation of a 
little child)— 
One-ry, two-cry, & c. 
Spoken.— Brayvo ! 
first-rate! 
I 
hope I 
am not tiring you by all this stupid talk, 
But if I 
am, Fin willing now my chalks at once to walk ; 
You may not, p'rhaps, have thought the time I've taken 
up too long, 
And may be pleased enough to wish I'd sing another song. 
,5poken.—If such is your wish, I 
must settle it in the old 
way, you know ; I 
must count out. (To the audience.) 
Now, I'll begin with you. 
One-ay, two-cry, tte. 
Spoken, I'm out ; I 
don't sing again.

WONDERFUL OULD OIRELAND. 
Ant :—" radtly O'Rafferty." 
There's wonderful spots in this wonderful nnivarse, 
But of OuId Oireland just hear Paddy tune a 
varse; 
She's louder than lightning, and quicker than thunder, 
Of wonderful wonders, ould Oireland's the wonder ! 
Show me bould heroes like O'Fagins and Flanningans, 
Tell me the boys to bate Learys and Lannigans ; 
Shure there's no beauties to equal the Doggertys, 
Sich Venus of girls as Foyles and O'Foggertys. 
CHORUS. 
Wirra, more power to wonderful ould Oireland, 
Thread on her coat-o'-arms tail an ye dare. 
Shure, didn't Paddy invent navigation ? 
For Pat's the best navvy there is in the nation; 
Praties were born in ould Oireland for son o' mans, 
For green Erin's full of the Murphys and Donovans 
Mountain dew, buttermilk, beauty and blarney, 
Live everlasting from Cork to Killarney 
As slime as Lough Dearg's not the big Bay of Biscay, 
The fruit of shillaleh is pigtail and whiskey. 
Wirra ! more power, ctc. 
Talk of Ireland being cold her high mountain quarter in, 
how can she be cold, when she's always hot water in ? 
Won't Irish warriors the enemy track again, 
And go so far to fight, they never come back again ? 
Isn't brave Paddy the pink o' politeness ? 
On a 
friend's head he drops his shillaleh wid lightness ; 
In the wide world for poultry what pigs can he finer 
Than Paddy breeds ? bating the tigers of China. 
Wirra! more power, drc.

WONDERFUL OULD OIRELAND—[CONCLUDED.} 
In the Shannon swim eels big as Nile alligators, 
And " spuds " grow as large as the dome of St. Pater's, 
Catshead apples spring up in the bogs just for asking, 
Wid Dick birds o' Paradise on cabins basking; 
Shure English visitors vow by the powers, 
Irish cabbage the finest of trop!cal flowers; 
And faith, Paddy wears, when of luck he's no run at all, 
The same shute o' clothes Adam wore, and that's none at all. 
Wirra! more power, & c. 
All the mighty great men who the world stand so high in it, 
Were born in ould Oireland, if they didn't die in it : 
Alexander, old Moses, and Nebuchadnezzar, 
General Tom Thumb, and bould Julius Czesar; 
Billy Waters and Shakespeare were brought up in Derry, 
Queen Sheba, and other famed fellows in Kerry; 
If it's not all true, I 
don't see any sin in it, 
For if they were not born, they ought to have been in it. 
Wirra ! more power, & c. 
Such beautiful damsels ould Oireland can rear 'em, 
They beat all the girls in the Turks' Harem-Scat:cm; 
For breaking boys' hearts no fair ones can transcend 'ern, 
And breaking their heads, too, if spalpeens offend en% 
And to none, then, will ould Oireland knock under, 
Of wonders of earth Erin's the Eighth Wonder ; 
But what is most wonderful when you just view her, 
Is the wonder her natives don't stick closer to her !

WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD IT WOULD BE. 
I've seen life in its changes. in towns, low and high. 
And know what it is to be sad ; 
But I 
find that it's better to laugh than to cry, 
And always take good with the bad. 
I 
can look at the world and find plenty like me, 
With little or nothing in purse ; 
For, no matter, how wretched and poor I 
may be, 
I 
can always find somebody worse. 
CIIORUS . 
Try then to smile, never be sad, 
Whatever your station may be, 
If we would bear our sorrows and only be glad, 
What a 
wonderful world it would be ! 
I 
envy no man tho' great he may be, 
Nor utter my feelings too rash; 
For I 
know that some climb to the top of the tree, 
And often come down with a 
crash. 
If my neighbor is poor, I 
open the door, 
And if I 
can, give him some help; 
For I 
know very well I 
never can tell 
how soon I 
might want it myself. 
Try then to smile, & e. 
Then never say die—for, we never can buy 
That treasure called health with our pounds ; 
There is many a 
king, to be happy as I, 
Would give up his kingdom and crown. 
There are princess as well. with me you'll agree, 
Now paying a 
debt of remorse; 
And if our aristocrats were as happy as we, 
They never would want a 
divorce. 
Then try to smile, & e. 
Never hold down your head, be happy instead, 
Bid your cares and your troubles be gone— 
There's many a 
dark and shadowy night 
Makes way for a 
bright sunny morn. 
If your friends see you're poor, and they knock at the door 
And you in your poverty sigh— 
They'll take things quite cool 116 a 
general rule, 
Aml tell you they'll call by-and-by. 
Then try to smile, Sc. 
THE WILD BOY. 
A s 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
He sat upon the wave-washed shore 
With madness in his eye, 
The surges dash, the breakers roar, 
Passed unregarded by. 
He noticed not the billows roll, , 
lie heeded not their strife, 
For terror had usurped his soul. 
And stopped the streams of life. 
They spoke him kindly—but he gazed 
And offered no reply ; 
They gave him food— he looked amazed, 
And threw the morsel by. 
He was as one o'er whom a 
spell 
Of darkness had been east: 
his spirit seems alone to dwell 
With dangers of the past. 
'The city of his home and heart 
So grand—so gaily bright. 
Now touched by fate's unerring dart, 
had vanished from his sight. 
The earthquake's paralyzing shake 
Mid rent it from his hold, 
And nothing but a 
putrid lake 
Its tale of terror told. 
Iiis kindred there, a 
numerous band, 
Had watched his youthful bloom 
In the broad ruin of the land, 
All, all had met their doom. 
But the last night a 
mother's voice 
Breathed o'er him in prayer, 
See perished— he was left no choice 
But mute and blank despair. 
Ho sat alone of all the, crowd 
That lately thronged around, 
The occail winds were piping loud, 
lie did not heed their soupd, 
They asked him ot' the city's fate. 
But reason's reign was o'er, 
lie pointed to her ruined state, 
Then lied and spoke 110 more.

OH! THE SHAMROCK,

As softly green 
As emerald seen

Old Erin's native Shamrock ! 
Says Valor, " See, 
They spring for me, 
Those leafy gems of morning r'-
Says Love, " No, no, 
For me they grow, 
My fragrant path adorning." 
But Wit perceives 
The triple leaves, 
And cries, " Oh I 
do not sever 
A

Three godlike friends, 
Love, Valor, Wit, for ever I" 
Oh ! the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock!

So firm'y fond 
May last the bond 
They wove that morn together, 
And ne'ur may fall 
One drop of gall 
On Wit's celestial feath r; 
May Love, as twine

Of thorny falsehood weed 'ern I 
May Valor ne'er

Against the cause of Freedom

Ah! believe me, fond fly, 'tis excessively sinful, 
This habit, which knocks even blue-bottles up; 
Remember what Cassio, on taking a 
skinful, 
Remarked about every inordinate cup. 
Pray, reflect on that proverb, diminutive being, 
Which says that " enough is as good as a 
feast;" 
And, believe me, there's nothing more painful, than seeing 
An insect behaving so much like a 
beast.-Cfro. 
Nay! in vain would you seek to escape while I'm talking, 
And shake from your pinions the fast clinging drops; 
While it's painfully clear ( from your efforts at walking), 
That after your malt you intend to take hops. 
Say, where is your home, and, oh ! how will you get there, 
And what will your wife and your family think; 
And how shall you venture to show the whole set there, 
That Paterfamilias is given to drink ?-Cuo. 
Oh! think of the moment when conscience returning, 
Shall put the brief pleasures of Bacchus to flight; 
When the tongue shall be parched, and the brow shall be burning, 
And inost of to-morrow shall taste of to-night. 
For thy toast shall be hard, and thy tea shall be bitter, 
And all through the breakfast one thought shall intrude: 
That a 
little pale brandy and seltzer were fitter 
For such an occasion, than animal food.-Cno. 
have known, silly fly, the delight beyond measure, 
The blissful emotion, prolonged and intense; 
The rapturous, wild, and ineffable pleasure 
Of drinking at somebody else's expense. 
But. all! when I've not used this privilege rightly, 
I've thought the next morning, on quitting my bed. 
That the skin was pulled over my countenance tightly, 
And tied in a 
knot at the back of my head.-Cuo.

Aly father was the broth of a

I'm the broth of a

And my mother's a

There's the English, the Irish, the Scotch, and the Welch, 
And success to them all jolly four ; 
And bad luck to me if one of them will flinch, 
If there was but one to a 
score. 
For John Bull's cold steel will make them freeze; 
Paddy's shillaleh will warm them enough ; 
Taffy will choke them with red-hot toasted cheese; 
And Scotchey will blind them with snuff. 
'Tis a

John Bull, Taffy, Scotchey, and an Irishman ! 
'Tis a

At the city of Delhi we gave them cayanne, 
And our sojers they fought first-rate; 
And with determination went in every man, 
When they blew up the Cashmere gate. 
The word of command from our generals did fly, 
And lion-hearted fought officers and men, 
Blood for blood, was our country's cry, 
And we'll never trust the Indians again. 
For our country can conquer by land or sea, 
On, boys, for death or victory ! 
On, brave army !
on, my boys ! 
One Irishman can lick ten senoys !

SWEET ECHOES. 
I 
think of thee when early dawn, 
Leads on with golden light the day; 
On dewy meads and shadow'd lawn 
My thoughts to thee will stray. 
I 
think of thee when riplets break 
At sunset on the lonely shore, 
The sounds that reach me oft awake 
Sweet echoes heard before. 
At times it seems thy voice s) dear 
Is borne upon the ev'ning breeze, 
And oft—rbow oft, thy name I 
hear, 
Half whisper'd ' mid the trees. 
I 
think of thee when stars are bright. 
When silver moonbeams glancing fly; 
And chequer'd shade, with fitful light, 
The clouds cast spreading by. 
Deep in the tangled forest brake, 
Thy fleeting form comes back to me ; 
By rushing stream or silent lake— 
I 
think alone of thee. 
With all that's lovely—all that's dear, 
My thoughts wing swift their way to thee; 
'Tis thine own sweet voice I 
hear, 
Thy form— so lov'd—I see. 
THE SISTER'S PARTING. 
My sister dear, we now mnst part, 
Mine own— my dearest friend. 
Still with the hope we soon shall meet,

Yes, all my joys and cares the same 
Alike will e'er be shar'd, 
Tho' fortune soon may change our lot, 
Oh ! may we both be spar'll 
To share a 
sister's love so true, 
Yes ! ever, ever dear; 
Sweet sister kind, I 
bid farewell I 
With many a 
bitter tear. 
My heart is sad to see yon go, 
And leave me all alone, 
'With this lone thought to ponder o'er, 
Mv fav'rite bird has flown ; 
But like the swallow, still I 
trust, 
"We soon shall meet again, 
To cheer my heart in lonely hours, 
And share Inv jo-y o•i• pain.

With a

Now I'm engaged to be married. 
The first 
engagement I've taken part in. 
I 
was better off though, before

was accepted. When I 
first called upon Mr. and Mrs. Catchem 
anything was good enough for me. All the daughters dressed up 
to the nines to receive me. Champagne dinners, soups, fish; joints, 
sweets, etc. 
I've noticed since I've been engaged, a 
falling off in 
the dinners. 
They've cut off the soups and fish; plain joints 
now, cheese to follow, bad sherry and bottled cooper.

MY NATIVE TOWN. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
We have heard of Charybdis and Scylla of old; • 
Of Maelstrom the Modern enough has been told; 
Of Vesuvius's blazes all travellers bold 
have established the bright renown ; 
But spite of' what ancients or moderns have said 
Of whirlpools so deep, or volcanoes so red, 
The Place of all other on earth that I 
dread 
Is my beautiful native town

if 
you're rich, 
They know ev'ry cut that you make in your Bitch : 
If your hose should be _darti'd, they can tell ev'ry 
stitch ; 
And they know when your wife got a 
gown. 
They old one, they say, was made new—for the brat ; 
And they're sure you love mice—for you can't keep a 
cat; 
In the hot flame of scandal, how blazes the fat, 
When it falls in your own native town. 
If a 
good stream of blood chance to run in your veins, 
They think to remember it not worth the pains, 
For the losses of caste are to them all the gains, 
So they treasure each base renown. 
If your mother sold apples—your father his oath. 
And was cropp'd of his ears—yet you'll hear ofthem 
both, 
For loathing all low things they never are loth 
In your virtuous native town. 
!f the dangerous heights of renown you should try. 
And give all the laggards below the go-by. 
For fear you'd be hurt with your climbing so 
They're the first to pull you down. 
Should Fame give you wings, and you mount in des-
pite. 
They swear Fame is wrong. and that they're in the 
right,

SHE RAN AWAY TO FOREIGN CLIMES. 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR.. 
I 
sat me down and wrote a 
song, 
I 
wrote it well, I 
wrote it long. 
At every line I 
shed a 
tear, 
At every verse I've lost my dear. 
My will will break and I 
shall die. 
And when I 
think, it makes me sigh, 
That I 
should love with such a 
love, 
And now I've lost my turtle dove. 
CHORUS. 
She ran away to foreign climes, 
She loves the man who plays the chimes. [Repeat. 
Iler name was Susan Sarah Jane, 
And don't you think it quite a 
shame 
That I 
should pine in such like times 
Just for a 
man that plays the chimes? 
She's not so tall, but very tine, 
Alas, she never can be mine ; 
Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her mouth is small, with teeth so white. 
She ran away, 6.5c. 
She's curly hair, as dark as night, 
liter skin is fair as lilies white ; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing rose, 
P. 
A merry laugh and Roman nose ; 
She's rather stout and full of pride, 
And when she \\Talks she takes a 
stride ; 
She swings her mans with such a 
grace, 
No Venus e'er had such a 
face. 
She ran away, &c. 
I 
decked my hair with violets blue, 
To let you know I 
loved her true ; 
I 
bound my calves in black and white, 
Because I 
lost my heart's delight ; 
My coat I 
changed to cabbage green, 
Which means forsaken by my queen ; 
My corpus thus in colors slashed, 
To let you know my heart is mashed. 
She Fall away, Sce. 
I'll seek some spot where lambkins play, 
And gently breathe my grief away. 
Where little pigs and ducklitors quack. 
You ll lind me stretched upon it 
back, 
And in my hand a 
carving knife, 
To let you know I 
took my life, 
Through loving one that ne'er loved inc.

The picquets are fast retreating, boys. 
The last tattoo is beating, boys;

For somehow he's no taste for a

As Snug by TONY PASTOR. 
When the stars were shining dimly, 
And the peaceful close of day, 
And a 
veil of pearly dew-drops 
O'er the sleeping blossoms lay, 
Little baby's eyes were closing, 
And her sweet and patient smile 
Seemed to tell us of the angels, 
Who were watching all the while. 
Now her laugh no more is ringing 
In our lone and quiet room, 
And the robins miss her foot-fall 
In the orchard bright with bloom. 
1 
can hear their voices calling, 
As among the clouds they soar, 
For the 1:ttle baby-angel 
Who has passed the golden door. 
Ever near me, waking, sleeping, 
Seems the little cherub form, 
That the shining hosts have sheltered, 
Safe from every earthly storm. 
And in dreams, the wee lips smiling, 
Press my forehead as of yore, 
While they whisper of the glory 
Just beyond the golden door.

CHIDING IS THE JOY OF OUR WEDLOCK; 
OR, GRUMBLING'S SUGAR TO OUR TEA. 
As Sang by TONY PasTon. 
THERE are some who delight in the race or the fight, 
Or others in boating take pleasure ; 
Some exult in the Ivars, and glory in scars, 
While some think a 
drive quite a 
pleasure. 
There are some like the sea, when afloat they are free. 
And others rejoice when they're riding ; 
But my great delight, from morning till night, 
Is to hear my dear husband keep chiding. 
cllokus. 
For chiding is the joy of wedlock, 
Grumbling is the thing for me ; 
When we're locked by Hymen's padlock, 
That's the sugar to our tea. 
In the morn 'ere he rise, and scarce opened his eyes, 
lie begins with his grumbling and chatter ; 
First, he says. I'm too tall, then he thinks I'm too small, 
Then he chides me because I 
am not fatter. 
It is his delight, both morning and night, 
When I 
hear him I 
know it's good tidings, 
I 
can very soon tell, my dear husband's unwell. 
If he were to leave off his chiding. 
For chiding is the joy. &c. 
When he sits in his place, with a 
black, surly thee, 
You would laugh if you heard him complaining, 
Of the tea being cold, or the bread far too old. 
And faults both great and mighty he's feigning. 
Be it flesh, fowl, or fish, he'll complain of the dish, 
And he'll grumble in words most deriding; 
But in that I 
delight, for I 
know it's all right. 
When I 
hear him indulge in his chiding. 
For chiding is the joy, &c. 
Then he grumble at night, to lose the delight 
Of chiding in bed as he's sleeping; 
So 10 soften his sorrow, I 
speak of to-morrow 
Then off to the bedroom he's creeping. 
It is his delight, and to me it's all 
For his love is still with me confiding; 
it's a 
failing he's got, and I 
don't care one jot. 
May he live long and keep on his chiding. 
For chiding is the joy, & e. 
PADDY'S DREAM. 
Ala:— " The Priest in his Boots." 
My grandmother Judy had oft made me wonder, 
such marvellous stories of ghosts she'd relate, 
How they'd speak, arrah honey, much louder than thunder; 
Till by Jasus, d'ye see, joy, she bodder'd my Pate. 
So the phantasmagoria being much the same thing, sir. 
Like a 
mad man to see it I 
straight ran away, 
That they coax'd me, agran, just two thirteens to pay. 
With my tal de ral, & c. 
And sing gramachree, didderoo, smilliloo huh, 
Musha whack, Ally Croaker, and Sally Maegee. 
Not a 
thing could I 
see when I 
entered the place, sir, 
So I 
looked with my fist, honey, where I 
might sit, 
Till a 
post, unjonteel, run its head in my face, Si!', 
And bodder'd my senses, agrab, for a 
bit. 
But the show once begun, beat my grandmother hollow ; 
They were now small as giants, then big as a 
span ; 
But the Turk, musha gra! with his damnable swallow, 
Made me think he might eat me, and so off I 
ran. 
With my tal de ral, (ke 
Got home, I 
in no time at all went to bed, sir, 
But still on these spectres, my fancy did keep, 
And such comical whimsies kick'd up in my head, sir, 
That made me get up, and walk out in my sleep. 
I 
thought that Howth's IIill to a 
giant had chang'd, 
And to wrestle with him did me strongly invite : 
In a 
case now like this, sure it wasn't strange, sir, 
That I 
chose, joy, much rather to run than to fight. 
With my tal de ral, 
He followed me down stairs, agrah, in a 
jiffey. 
And to catch me he gave a 
most damnable stride 
When finding myself on the banks ot the Lilley, 
I 
jump'd in. and swain till I 
reach'd Cother side. 
The chill of the water soon made ine awake, sir, 
When, fait, a 
delectable figure 1 
cut; 
For I'd made, arrah, fait, a 
most curious mistake, sir, 
And instead of the Liffey, jump'd into a 
butt. 
With my tal de ral, & e.

LOVE AND HOME AND NATIVE LAND. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
When o'er the silent deep we rove, 
More fondly then our thoughts will stray 
To those we leave—to those we love, 
Whose prayers pursue our wat'ry way. 
When in the lonely midnight hour 
The sailor takes his watchful stand, 
Ills heart then feels the holiest power 
Of love, and home, and native 'mid. 
In vain may tropic climes display, 
Their glittering shores—their gorgeous shells; 
Though bright birds wing their dazzling way, 
And glorious flowers adorn the dells ; 
Though nature there prolific, pours 
The treasures of her magic hand, 
The eye—but not the heart, adores: 
The heart still beats for native land. 
' 
THE LEGACY. 
By Thomas MoORE. 
When in death I 
shall calm recline, 
0 
bear my heart to my mistress dear, 
Tell her it liv'd upon smiles and wine ; 
Of the brightest hue, while it linger'd here 
Bid her not shed one tear of sorrow, 
To sully a 
heart so brilliant and light; 
But balmy drops of the red grape borrow, 
To bathe the relic from morn till night. 
When the light of my song is o'er, 
Then take my harp to your ancient hall ; 
Hang it up at that friendly door, 
Where weary travellers love to call. 
Then if some bard, who roams forsaken, 
Revive its soft note in passing along, 
Oh ! let one thought of its master waken 
Your warmest smile for the child of song. 
Keep this cup, which is now o'erflowing, 
To grace your revel when I'm at rest ; 
Never, oh ! never its balm bestowing, 
On lips that beauty hath seldom blest. 
But when some warm devoted lover 
To her he adores shall bathe its brim, 
Then, then my spirit around shall hover. 
And hallow each drop that foams for him. 
.0^ 
WHO WILL CARE WHEN I AM GONE. 
As 
Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
When my heart has ceased its yearning, 
For the joys that will not stay, 
And my rested feet are roaming 
In the angels' shining way, 
Who will sigh for words of greeting— 
Who will moan for smiles withdrawn ? 
Never more my welcome meeting, 
Who will care when I 
am gone ? 
When with still and painless bosom, 
I 
am lying fast asleep, 
Underneath the dew and bla-som, 
In the grave so dark and deep. 
Who will grieve for words unspoken— 
Tender greetings at the dawn. 
From the lips by death o'ertaken, 
Who will care when I 
am gone ? 
When the birds have hushed their music, 
At the twilight dim and gray : 
Who my name will softly whisper, 
Who for me will kindly pray, 
Gazing at the dew- wet blossoms, 
Leaning o'er my narrow bed, 
Who will breathe a 
word in blessing, 
For the soul from sorrow fled ?

NORAII MY DARLING. 
By TH0MAS III:Ds0s. 
Oh ! Norah, my darling, yours is a 
sweet name, 
Your face just like Flora, is sweet as that same ; 
For your roses and lilies, and graces combine 
r10 bother this heart, that is yours and not mine. 
There's the moon with a 
ring on, all shining so brigh t— 
I 
suppose she gof married to-day or last night ; 
Let me buy a 
small ring your size, dear, the least. 
And let me persuade you to go to the priest. 
Och—hone ; you had better be kind, 
And take me—tis now Fin just in the mind 
To marry my darling Norah 
Tiler's the moon looking down still—she hears all we're 
saying, 
Her ring's turned to mist, that's a 
great sign of rain, 
And a 
shower of tears have made both my eyes blind, 
So Fin in a 
mist because Norah's unkind ; 
If you won't have me, Nora'', I 
won't have no rest, 
Then the Crowner will come with his jury inquest, 
They'll sit on my body—hear evidence true, 
And I'll swear that tis all wilful murder gainst you. 
Oeh—hone ! you had better be kind 
And take me —tis now that I'm just in the mind 
To marry my darling 1N-oralt ! 
Get the Best! Get the Best!

'WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct, the 
reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank. 
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundieds of thousands of persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body at the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mar. 
/gentile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the general reader. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dize: end 
3. Several forms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
irorks upon book-keeping. 
This work has been submitted to the perusal of several of our most eminent 
aaankers and traders, and has invariably met with their approval.
