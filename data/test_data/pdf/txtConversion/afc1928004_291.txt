Mr. Courtright, the comedian, in his act of " My Only Friend," opens 
with some wild drollery, which sets the house in a 
roar; the rest of the 
act is of a 
pathetic character, almost too much so for a 
house devoted 
entirely to laughter; but in his sketch of " The poor old Slave's Return 
to the Home of Other Days," Mr. Courtright displays dramatic ability 
which is considerably above burnt cork.

THE DAYS OF '49. 
Bung with great success by WiLwat CotTaxialTZ 
YOU'RE looking now on old Tom Moore, a 
relic of former days, 
A 
bummer, too, they call me now, but what care I 
for praise; 
For my heart is filled with the days of old, and oft' do I 
repine 
For those days of old, those days of gold,, those days of '
0. 
I 
had comrades, too, a 
saucy crew, hard cases I 
must eciifisni; 
But still they were brave and true, my boys, as Minters from 
the West; 
They'd stand the pinch, and never flinch, and never fret 
tes 
• 
whine, 
But like good old bricks, they stood the kicks, in the days of 
There's Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget, for the luck that he 
always had; 
He'd deal for you both night and day, or as long as you had a " 
acad. 
One night a 
pistol laid him low, 'twas his last lay out in fin% 
For it caught Pete sure, dead in the door, in the days of :49. 
There was Poker Bill, he was one of the boys, he was always 
in for a 
game, 
And -whether he lost, or whether he won, it Was rives

Be would ante a 
slug, or rush the buck, or go a 
hat-fall blind; 
But in a 
game with death, poor Bill lost his breath, in the days 
of'49. 
NO 
There was Buffalo Bill, he could outroar a 
buffalo bull, you bet; 
He'd roar all night, and he'd roar all day, and I 
guess Bill's 
roaring yet. 
One night he fell in a 
prospect hole, t' was a 
roarin' bad design, 
For in that hole Bill rolled out his soul, in the days of '49. 
There was Galous Jake, a 
butcher boy, so fond of getting tight, 
And whenever he got on a 
spree he was spilin' for a 
fight. 
One night he ran against a 
knife in the hands of old Bob Cline, 
So over Jake we held a 
wake, in the days of ' 49. 
There was old lame Jesse, a 
hard old cuss, and he never 
wOuld repent, 
He never missed a 
single meal, and he never put up a 
cent. 
But poor old Jesse, like all the rest, did at last to death resign, 
And in his bloom he went up the flume, in the days of '49. 
Of all the comrades I 
had then, not one remains to boast, 
I'm left alone in my misery, like some poor wandering ghost;

No star sheds its rap; 
No danger, love, affrights thee,—

But now closed is ev'ry eye ;—

SWEET DORA DARE. 
Music to-be had of Win. A. Pond, 547 Broadw-sy. 
TRIPPING down the valley, skipping o'er the lea, 
Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid can be; 
Liko a 
plume of raven is the bright sheen of her hair, 
Happy as a 
little queen is my darling Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song-birds, as they sweetly sing, 
Hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring; 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who.heal: 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare, 
Dora with the lilies of the valley in her hair, 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair, 
My heart it will go pit-a-pat at signt of Dora Dank 
All the lads arc sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet, 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the while. 
What has passed between us; Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again my Dora Dare will wear 
Orange tower6 with lilies of the valley in heihair.

FRIENDS THAT STAND BY US, 
Written and Sung, with great success, by War. Courramsrr. 
NOW, then, subjects for songs nowadays are so scarce, 
And to find one I've looked far and near every day; 
i.nd the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For its something like looking for needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through 
thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as its nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little elf, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works your-
self. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right its their wish you can wager to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you through thick an,4 
through thin.

Our country's made up of all 'classes, all nations, 
Ev'ry mixture, all colors, all kinds and all creeds; 
Don't frown on a 
man in a 
poor humble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds.' 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger,.. 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
' 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now, wave. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their grave. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and tried hard to win. 
And should they be called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through 
thin.

MY ONLY FRIEND. 
(Song to the Banjo.) By Cams. E. HELM. 
OLD scenes, take me back on de old pine-wooded track, 
I 
think I 
see de massa's face once more; 
Then there's my good old wife, the main-stay of my life, 
Waiting and watching at de cabin door. 
Yes, memories of the past, old friend, you've woke, at last, 
I'm broken down, and cannot long remain: 
rio cheer me, if you can, I'll reach dat better land, 
And this old man will never more complain. 
Camius. 
Then comfort I 
will take, my heart it cannot break, 
My -voice with yours, old comrade, I 
will blend; 
My sorrow's almost o'er, dey's knocking at de door, 
Dim dear old banjo, here's my only friend. 
Utak what is dat? I 
hear de angels drawing near— 
I 
hear dam singing at de cabin door; 
Old massa, he is dar, young misses—young and fair, 
And de liltle nigs, long dead and gone before. 
I 
cannot see to read; I'm helpless now, indeed, 
But my troubles dey will surely soon be o'er; 
Although I'm broken down, dey's got for me a 
crown, 
)Tow just wait,

Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along. 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in the pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a

Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeter%

THE GAY MASQUERADE, 
Sung by ELLA. W ESSER. 
SOME like garden parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spooning, just " under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weakness, I 
fear, is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pretty darlings ia costume arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Some dances are like Quakers' meetings in style, 
So " starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smile; 
But to do as one likes without feeling afraid, 
By jove the right place is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the dear masquerade, 
With sweet " tootsie wootsies" so sweetly arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' tis the easiest:task, 
To some elegant creature whilst wearing a 
mask; 
Oh the tales I 
have told, and the vows I 
have made— 
There's no place for flirting like the gay masquerade, 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With dear " popsy wopsies," so gaily arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Each lady that' S 
masked, for " a 
beauty," don't take 
If you do then, " that's where you will make a 
mistake," 
Some darling old spinsters you'll oft find arrayed, 
Who are fishing for flats at the gay masquerade, 
SrorEN.—I generally go a3 " Romeo," and naturally look 
out for my Juliet; my last " Juliet," was more fit for the 
part of " Nurse"—fifty if she was an hour, and when she un-
masked Oh! Nabob's Pickles! an awful take in, but still, if 
there's anything I 
adore, by Jove it is—

LITTLE DARLING, DO. YOU MISS KV 
Music Published by Wm. A. Pond, 517 Broadway. 
Price 40 cents 
LITTLE darling, do you miss me, 
Wand'ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me, 
As you did in days before? 
Is your gentle heart repining 
For the joys that once were .thine, 
With my arms around you twining 
And your little hand in mine. 
CHORUS. ' 
Little darlinT, do you miss me, 
As you dream of days before, 
Do you linger still to kiss me, 
By the little cottage door? 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
Roaming by the stream let tide? 
Where I 
whispered as I 
kissed thee. 
You were more than all beside? 
Does sweet memory returning, 
Bring again those happy days, 
With the never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ? 
Little darling, etc. 
Little darling, do you miss me. 
Do you long to hear my voice, 
Breathing words so sweet and tender, 
That would make your heart rejoice? 
By and by I 
hope 1

greet thee, 
As I 
did so long before, 
Are you waiting still to meet me, 
As you've done in days of yore ?

Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
With a 
basket to put in her fish, 
Every morning with line and a 
hook 
This sweet little lass, 
Through the tall heavy grass, 
Steals along by the clear running brook 
She throws her line into the stream, 
And trips it along the brook side; 
0 
how I 
do wisn 
That I 
was a 
fish, 
To be caught by sweet Kitty Clyde, 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty 
My own sweet Eitty Ciyde, 
23 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
How I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
not gather honey from the flowers, 
But would steal a 
dear sip 
From Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers. 
Oh, if I 
was some little bird, 
It would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side 
Of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
And sleep in her soft silken hair. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Ode.

While the silver tints the gold, 
And together we grow old, 
I 
will linger ever near, 
Speaking words of hope and cheer.2 
For to me you seem as young, 
As when first my praise you sung, 
And I 
love you just the same, 
' 
As the day I 
took your name. 
CHORUS. 
While the silver tints the gold, 
And together we grow old, 
I 
will love you just the same, 
As the day I 
took your name. 
Yes, our locks may lose their gold, 
And our faces, too, grow old. 
But our hearts will be the same, 
Naught ca 
ft dim love's holy flame. 
We have journeyed on in life, 
Side by side, through storm and strife, 
Still together, hand in hand, 
Seek we now another land. 
While the silver tints the gold, etc. 
Let us down life's sunny slope, 
Wander with the blissful hope, 
That when shadows ' round us creep, 
And we lay us down to sleep, 
Sleep to know no pain or care, 
We 
shall meet just over there, 
By the shining gates of gold, 
Where our faces ne'er grow old, 
While the silver tints the gold, eta, 
I 
LOVE the white girl and the black, 
And I 
love all the rest; 
I 
love the girls for loving me, 
But I 
love myself the best. 
Oh dear, I 
am so thirsty; 
I've just been down to supper; 
I 
drank three pails of apple-jack, 
And a 
tub of apple-butter. 
CHORUS. 
0, a 
little more cider too, 
A 
little more cider too; 
A 
little more cider for Miss" Dinah, 
A little more cider too. 
When first I 
saw Miss Snow Flake, 
'Twas on Broadway I 
spied her; 
I'd give my hat and boots, I 
would, 
If I 
could been beside her. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
And then I 
crossed the street; 
And then she smiling said to me, 
A 
little more cider sweet. 
0, a 
little more cider too, etc. 
Oh, I 
wish I 
was an apple, 
And Snow Flake was another; 
Oh what a 
pretty pair we'd make, 
Upon a 
tree together 
How bad de darkies all would feel, 
When on the tree they spied her, 
To think how we would be 
When we're made into cider. 
0, a 
little more cider too, etc. 
But now old age came creeping, 
We grow down and don't get bigger; 
And cider sweet and sour then, 
And I 
am just the nigger; 
But let the cause be what it will, 
Short, small, or wider, 
She am de apple of my soul, 
And I'm bound to be beside her. 
0, a 
little more cider too, etc.

'Tis pleasant on a 
summer night, 
I 
think you won't deny, 
When stars, like wicked laughing eyes, 
Are winking in the sky ; 
With some one by your side whose eyes 
Are bright as any star, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
Enjoying your cigar. 
CHORUS. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
Talking to a 
pretty girl, 
Heedless of her pa ; 
Though some may like to strut about, 
I 
like it better far, 
Leaning on a 
balcony 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
You're glad to leave the crowded room, 
And if the night be fair, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
To.get a 
breath of air; 
And if you've some one by your side, 
She won't take it amiss, 
If, in a 
quiet sort of way, 
You steal a 
little kiss. 
Leaning on a 
ha:cony, etc. 
When curtains screen you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop the question quietly, 
What better place can be; 
The coldest- hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
gays never proved unkiect , 
Leaning on a

Then married we will be, 
When we have crossed the sea; 
In that glorious land where every man, 
Has got his liberty. 
No tyrants there we'll see, 
For every man is free; 
May God be with George Washington, 
The Father of Liberty. 
When we be in that land, 
I'll work both night and day; 
And all the money I 
make, dear rate, 
You shall have to put away-
And when we have enough, 
A

Then we shall live like turtle doves, 
We

The Old Man's Drunk Again.1 
YOU' VE no doubt beard the song, 
Of " Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
Flow the old man used to " smile," 
• 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That lie would drink no more; 
But then lie would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say, 
" 
The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, 
c. 
He'd smash poor rootbz., s 
Lose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for go, St. 
"0! Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow; 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow;

I 
don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go ior you," 
When you get drunL again;

CHORUS. 
She was sweeter than the sweetest, 
And neater than the neatest, 
You may talk about your fashion, 
She really was the belle, 
But where she lives, or what's her name,

Her card de visite she gave me, and then I

THE SHANGHAI MUSKETEERS. 
Sung by EDGAR A. 
DA.Nutts. 
Air: " 17w Little German Band." 
THANKSGIVING day has come at last, 
And we march in the grand parade; 
As the drums do beat and the pipes do play 
We 
feel that we are made; 
The people cry and shout " huzza I" 
As we gallantly pass by; 
With a 
stiff upper lip we keep in step, 
And wave our flags on high. 
Cnonts. 
March time, march we hear; 
And forward march we go; 
We grasp our guns while stars and stripes 
Wave nobly to and fro; 
The Shanghai Musketeers ! 
The Shanghai Musketeers! 
We jolly boys do march away 
In the Shanghai Musketeers. 
Our nobby suits and flashing gnu, 
Such splendid marching, too; 
The people wondered and would sag 
Oh I 
what a 
handsome crew; 
„ - 
When e'er we would receive a 
prize-
Our Captain, ' mid loud cheers 
Would bow profound and then give thanks 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, ctc, 
When up the Boulevard we did go 
To shoot for prizes there, 
And after that to dinner went 
And, oh! such a 
grand affair; 
Roast chicken, pork and beans, and ham, 
Wines, whiskey, all kinds of beers, 
Long life as a 
toast was given 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, Ltc. 
At last toward home we march again 
A 
singing all the way; 
We couldn't keep straight to save our necks, 
And the band too drunk to play ;-
When we reached home in the morning 
We were frisky as young steers; 
Thus ended the glorious first parade 
Of the Shanghai Musketeers.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL TILE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
1WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother 
Waste not, 
not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be 4' 
dispatch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
- 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
flow father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, Jce. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark'd in public life, 
And found it 
as a 
rugged road bestrewn with eare and strife; 
I 
speculated foo!ishly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, 3tc. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise*, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twat, 
hot, 
I 
seiz'd my opportunities and never once forgot— 
Waste not, 
IM' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Ls, waste not, &a

THE HAT ME FATHER WORE, 
Air- 4 IRISH M OLLY 0 
1" 
I'M Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or br dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CHORITS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From mifather's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old decency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc..

OH! I

For beauty and education the 1110Itillin's bate Ilium all, 
The name is handed down from the days of Adam's time, 
\Vic1 the greatest admiration, I

CHORUS. 
For I

I'm a 
credit to my country, Erin's Isle, 
McMullin is my name, without any fear or shame, 
I'd stand out here forninst you in the rale McMullin style. 
My father often tould me to never tell a 
lie, 
I

beggar if I 
saw him passing by, 
Be free and independent as a 
bird that flies the air, 
Let my heart be like a 
dove and my spirit like a 
bear.

Mr. Shakespere's brain said there's nothing in a 
name, 
But he was a 
total stranger to McMullin all the wh.le, 
For if he'd lived to-day, one thing he'd surely say, 
There's nothing can compare, my boys, to Lilo McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
My father's blood is in my veine, and McMullin is my name. 
It's known from Ireland unto the river N 
le, 
And when you have bad lock, don't cry out like a 
duck, 
But put your shoulder to it in the rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc.

PAT -MALONY'S FAMILY, 
Written and sung by ED. Henault's, in Harrigan & Hart's 
sketch, " Who Owns the Line'' , 
ME name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgiirs, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed me iamily. 
CHORES. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And ner sister, 
And her brother.' 
1700 babies laying on their knees, 
Her uncles anti her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozen 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece; * 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof; 
Or I 
never have no peace.

They made me buy them dainties, 
-Root beer by the pail; 
rd have to wait ' till they were full 
Before rd . git me male. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you burst a 
button, 
And a 
fiery- head Corkonian 
By the name oi Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick Malony. 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue, 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew. 
Cuonus. 
There's her nephews 
And her nieces

1700 grandmothers 
And mothers-in-law you see; 
A 
wagon load of Dalys;

Lived on the earnings of Patrick Malony., 
There's her second cousin's brother, 
And his toothless old step-mother.

There's the Brads

Always axing charity

Depending on the friendship of Patrick Malony.

STEIRLY. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When we're dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never Lrcet. us, 
In the flash f 
tho beautiful night, 
Ent the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We mu:t part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home I,oking slee;y and sore. 
. SrorrN.—Yes we 
t:Icre 13 nothing- more delig,litral 
than to go to a 
ball, and dunce all Light with a 
pret'y girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and firt a 
1:ttie in a 
qt:' `, corner, and 
all that you know; .but when reacting on it the next day, ono 
Can't help but think, 
cnont:s. 
Ch it's all very we:I to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall, 
Dut you know how we feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the hal 
There the ladies are iivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry face wears a 
mantle cf giaaness, 
There 13 welcome where ever we go; 
54 
But when morning come# grind we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thinl. we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOKEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while it 
lasts, but we have to pay for it in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
my, I'm so sleepy." 
Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another Will complain of 
being chilly, and so on. 
And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc, 
All around us the music is floating, 
Liglit'and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
sympathize with each other in our misery: and go home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Oh it's all qery well to go waltzing, etc.

BENEATH THE GREENWOOD TREE

ONE pleasant noon I 
tallied forth, 
My darling one to meet, 
The glittering clew was on the leaves, 
And the suu was shining sweet, 
And as we Ltood within the glade, 
From noi-ie and strife quite free, 
Near by we 1.1d to tell,our love, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
Cnonus. 
Yes, indeed, I 
must confess 
On her depends my happiness, 
Elvira is a 
darling, 
And truly so to me, 
I'll ne'er forget where first we met, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
Her name it is Elvira Jane, 
That name sounds sweet to me, 
My wife I 
intend to make this dear, 
If thus to me she'll be. 
As meny moments they pass by, 
Eitr heart to judge is tree, 
I've popped the question to my love, 
Beneath tha greenwood tree. 
..She promised then td be mine, 
We've fixed the happy day, 
I 
shall take her to my heart, 
Just one week next Sunday. 
Down in the 1:ttle trysting place, 
Our wedding is to be, 
There where Erst we told our love, 
Beneath the gree.uwood tree.
