W. F. S. LAWLOR'S 
ORIGINAL 
BARNEY, THE GUIDE 
SONGSTER. 
Containing all the Comic and Sentimental Songs sung in 
CHAS. 351AnEVOY'S ORIGINAL HIBERNICON. 
Written, Arranged, and compiled by 
WM. F. 
S. 
LA.WLOR, 
And Respectfully Dedicated to Charles MacEvoy. 
Brief Sketch of W. F. S. Lawlor, 
The subject of this sketch was barn in Dublin, Ireland, In 1844. 
Ile adopted his present profession at the early age of thirteen, in his 
native city. 
As a 
vocalist and comedian, he appeared with marked 
success in London, Liverpool, and all the principal cities of Great 
Britain under the name of W. F. SiNcLAnt. 
He arrived in New York in March, 1869, and shortly afterward Fir-
sued his profession, becoming very popular tinder that ram° ; and 
was the first to introduce to the New York public the following songs 
(which have since become such universal favorites) viz:—" Never Push 
a 
Man Because he's Going Down the Bill;" " Jim the Carter Lad;" 
" 
Shabby Genteel;" " Broken Down;" cte., dec. 
He engaged with CHAR. MacEvoy, proprietor of the " Original 
Hibernicon, 
in August, 1870, to perform the character of "Barney 
the Guide," taking his real name, W. F. S. 
LAWLOR. The picture on 
the cover is deemed to be a 
very faithful likeness of Mr. L., as "Bar-
ney the Guide." 
His success as an Irish comedian is complete, almost amounting to 
a 
furo,- 
wherever he ha s 
app eared. He possesses a 
high tenor voice 
of remarkable purity and cultivation; a 
rich brogue, and is a 
capital 
dancer. 
These qualities, so re(juisite for this line of business, are 
seldom to be found in one individual. Vide opinions of the press and 
public of the United States.

PREFACE. 
In presenting the original " Barney the Guido" Songster, to the 
public, it may not be out of place to give a 
short sketch of the hi y 
stor 
of the Exhibition known as 
Cuss. MAcEvov's Original Ilthernicon.." 
As the name implies, it has reference to Ireland; and is, in fact, a 
panorama of Irish scenery ; and with its many adjuncts—illustrates 
the scenery, music, and antiquities of Ireland. 
It was the first exhibition of the kind ever presented to an American 
audience, and was gotten up, with great care, after years of mature 
study and deliberation. 
Ths sketches, engravings, and photographs, were imported from 
London, and Dublin, expressly for the work, and executed on canvas 
at a 
vast outlay, by the celebrated French Scenic Artists, M. M. Duf-
loeg and Foncheve, of the Grand Opera blouse. Paris, 
Many of the " Historical Pictures," added to the series from time 
to time, are from the pencils of the best European Artists. 
To give vitality to the exhibition, and render it acceptable to all 
classes,—both young and old,—a " Dramatic Episod e,' written ex-
pressly for it, and entitled " The Adventures of Barney the Guide,"— 
Is performed in connection with the panoramic views as they pass 
before the spectator— introducing also— appropriate, patriotic, senti-
mental, and comic songs— many f 
them original, and nearly all of 
which will be found in this connection. 
These adjuncts to the paintings—improved upon by many years of 
experience—have proved to be an important element in the success of 
the " Original llibernicon." 
To produce a 
refined Irish entertainment of this style—of only two 
hours duration—and give in that short time—glances at the most 
beautiful scenery of the" Emerald Isle," reminiscences of her glmious 
past history, together with life-like sketches of the grave and humor-
ous sides of the character of her extraordinary people— is no small 
task. 
Yet, all these things have been successfully accomplished in the 
" 
Hibernicon," and from its first exhibition in 1860, to the present 
time, has delighted hundreds of thousands of people, and received the 
highest encomiums of the entire press of the United States and 
Canada. 
Its extraordinary success, since the " Inaugural Exhibition " given 
in New York, in 1860, has recently induced onprincipled speculators 
to imitate it. 
And, although the title, episode, and other accessories 
are protected by the latest " copy-right " laws.—these miserable 
" 
Frauds" usurp the legal rights of the proprietor under cover of 
mere techn calities—palm off their miserable daubs and plagiarisms on 
the public as the genuine article. 
Ilene-. the word " Original" is used 
to distinguish it from the many counterfeits now traveling through 
the country.

BARNEY BE AISY. 
Composed by CHAS, MACEWOY, and sung by W. F. S. LAWLOR at the 
Original Mberuicon. 
Arrab I 
Nellie my dear, Ime stand by me here, 
Till I 
tip you a 
bit of my blarney, 
I'll sing you fine songs, ' bout the poker and tongs, 
And the beautiful Lakes of Killarney. 
I'll wrap my big coat,round your neck and your throat, 
For to keep the night dew from my daisy, 
Then my arm your dear waist, shall most lovingly taste, 
And you'll giggle " Now, Barney, be aisy." 
Then I'll tell you about, my own darling Isle, 
The nate Emerald gem of the Ocean, 
About the kings and the bogs, the priests and the frogs, 
And other strange things of my notion; 
III tell of St. Ruth, of Sarsfield too, 
And all about Corporal Casey, 
For its sogers you like, whether bayonet or pike, 
And you'll giggle out " Barney be aisy." 
Then I'll spate of a 
cot—on the hills of Arctoe, 
With the ships and the sea underneath us, 
For fresh air and fish, an illegant dish, ' 
Not a 
Lord in the land can ere bate us; 
Then we'll stand on the rocks of a 
fine summer's day, 
With our ehilder so fat and so greasy, 
With the salmon and trout a 
jumpin about. 
Then you'll whisper, now " Barney, be aisy."

WHO'S FOR DONNYBROOK. 
Wrate and sung by W. F. S. LAWLOR, in Chas. MacEvoy's_Original 
llibernicon. 
You've heard of Barney Brallaghan the purty colleen's joy, 
And if ye's want to know him, bedad here stands the boy. 
There's not a 
girl in Dublin town, but by me is well known, 
And don't they seem to like we, for I've kissed the blarney stone. 
CHORUS. 
Who's for Donnybrook I 
cry? swate spot to view the fair, 
Arrali! jump upon my outside car, and I'll quickly drive you 
there. 
And there's the girl of my heart, you'd travel near and far 
To find a 
prettier colleen, to grace a 
jaunting car: 
Married we'll be shortly, now boys won't that be grand— 
So here's success to Norah dear, and the boys of Ireland. 
Who's for Donnybrook, &c, 
Then prosperity to Ireland, the swatest spot on earth, 
The haven of all havens, the land that gave me birth: 
And, when by old time hired, and he my fare bath paid, 
My only dearest wish is 'neath the shamrock to be laid. 
(Spoken) 
What's that you say, main ? take yer self and the 
child, and the bundle of rags for six pence, get out, d'ye think 
I 
stole the horse ? 
She says, why don't you make your horse 
fatter, Barney ? . Oh ? hedad she's fat enough, mam, she's hard-
set now to carry all the fat she's got on her, I 
had to light a 
fire under her this mornin' to get her up, anyhow, 
goin to 
kill that horse next week. I'd get more for the skin than I 
would 
for the horse. How's that says she ? 
Well, mam, says I. only 
it's such a 
illegant fine skirt the hones would be out through it 
long ago—anyhow, I 
took her up on the car, and off I 
started 
singing out ;—

Sung by M ARIE DALTON M AC EVOY, and W. F. S. LAWLOR. 
Music by ClIAS.MACEVOY. 
Barney. 
Sweet Norah come, my jewel, 
Our trials are over now ; 
We've got your mother's blessing, 
how dear is our plighted vow ; 
Hurrah for the farm and plough! 
Who'll be the pride of the fair I 
Who dances best on the fiure I 
If prizes were given for beauty, 
You'd take the best I 
am sure. 
-Whose song is the best when the turn 
Collies to my Novak to sing ; 
Jewel, you'd bate the bould robin, 
When he first welcomes the Spring. 
Spoken.—Oeb, but you did cut the dash among them last night! 
That villain, Tim Keaii. looked at me all as one as if he could ate ine 
without a 
grain of salt, well, sure it's not my fault that you could not

dozen of us, it's better, Norah, as it is, darliot. 
Norah. 
Dear Barney come, my darling, 
Our trials are over ROW; 
We've got my mother's blessing, 
how sweet is our plighted vow; 
I'll spin while you guide the plough! 
But promise never to go 
Away from Norah for long; 
For then I 
no more would spin, 
Nor think of a 
single song. 
With you beside me ever. 
I'll face a 
whole world of care; 
Preferring home where you are, 
To empty joys elsewhere? 
Spoken.—Yes, Barney! Acushla! I 
feel I'm ready for anything. 
Fortune, or misfortune, while your strong arm is at my side, and 
your kind voice to cheer me. 
Together.

THE WIDOW McCARTY. 
Sang by W . 
F. 
S. 
LAWLott at Mr. CHAS. MAcEvoY's Original 
Hibernicon. 
Air :—" Kate Kearney." 
Oh I 
have you not heard of McCarty, 
Who lived in Tralee, good and hearty I 
He had scarce lived two score, when death came to his door. 
And made a 
widdy of Mrs. McCarty. 
Near by, lived one Paddy Mc Manus, 
Who, by the way, was a 
bit of a 
Genius: 
At his trade he was good: Cuttin' figures of wood. 
Says he; I'll go see the Widdy McCarty. 
Now Paddy, you know, was no ninny; 
He agreed for a 
couple of guineas, 
To cut out a 
stick, the dead image of Mick 
And take it home to Widdy McCarty. 
As the Widdy she'd sit by the fire, 
Every night, before she'd retire, 
She'd take the stick that was dead put it into the bed, 
And lay down by the wooden McCarty. 
Now Pat wasn't long to discover 
That the Widdy was wanting a 
lover; 
He made love to her strong; and you'll say be wasn't wrong, 
For in three days, he wed the Widdy McCarty. 
Their friends for to see them long tarried; 
To bed Pat and the Widdy they carried; 
She took up the stick, that was cut out for Mike 
And under the bed shoved the wooden McCarty. 
In the mornin', when Paddy was raisin', 
lie wanted somethin' to set the fire blazin', 
Says she If you're'in want of a 
stick just out a 
slice off of MO:a 
For, I'm done with my wooden McCarty I

BETTER DAYS IN STORE.

Ant.—" Jim the Carter Lad.' 
As through this weary world you roam, I'm sure you'll often 
find, 
That fortune she is fickle, and very oft unkind, 
Lire's but a 
battle at the best in which we all must share, 
Su as you journey on, my boys, for the worst prepare. 
Whate'er your lot, contented be, grieve not, nor yet despair, 
Behind a 
dark and gloomy cloud the weather may be fair, 
Should grim misfortune visit you, don't give the struggle o'er, 
With patience wait, it may be fate has brighter days in store. 
The road through life for some is smooth, lit up with fortunes 
ray, 
For others it is hackneyed so, they perish by the way, 
The man of station, rank and wealth, may thirtk his troubles 
past, 
But sliding slowly down the hill, is forced to beg at last. 
What e'er your lot, dic. 
Some tradesmen labor long and hard, independence to secure, 
But fortune goes against him and keeps him always poor ; 
While other undeserving men, uncaring how things go, 
Dame Fortune lifts them step by step, and brings the worthy 
What e'er your lot, dic. 
Though poverty should be your lot, oh I 
envy not the wealth 
1.'hat some possess if you're blessed with, that precious boon,.

Steer steady as you sail along, you'll reach the port at last.

PUSH ON AHEAD, BOYS. 
Written and snug by W . 
F. 
STNCLAM LAwLoa. 
Air: " Act on the Square." 
It very plainly seems to me, this life is like a 
race, 
And on its rugged course we see, men differ in their pace; 
Some going quick but others they, at snails rate onward tread, 
But to get on in life, I 
say, you must push on ahead. 
Push on ahead, boys, push on ahead, 
Life's like a 
race, boys, so dont be afraid, 
Push on ahead, boys, push on ahead, 
Don't lay behind: boys, but push on ahead. 
In business now as you all know, there are some who succeed, 
The chances they pick up soon show, may on to fortune lead; 
But there are some who hesitate until the chance has fled, 
And then they grieve that they're too late, and wisht hey'd 
pushed ahead. 
Push on ahead, boys, &c. 
I 
know a 
young man, he's a 
friend, he loved a 
nice young maid, 
To marry her he did intend, to ask her felt afraid. 
He thus her patience sorely tried, she's now another wed, 
When she might have been his bride, if he pushed on ahead. 
Push on ahead, boys, &c. 
But life is rugged as I've said, and some, good fortune lack, 
Along the road they just have trod, they may be carried back. 
Yet don't despair and never be by bad example led, 
But start again quite cheerily and onward push ahead.

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
As sung by W. F. S. LAwLon. 
Eight years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On my wedding-day these clothes were new 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hist'ry 
Of where we go, and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
misery— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
l 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth, 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied, 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair. 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ey'rywbere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
How different now, then you were new. 
And von. poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell, clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
pauper's suit, grey or blue. 
I 
Inn.,,t 
die in a 
poor-law union, 
In clothes I 
hate, though perhaps quite new.

PRETTY NARY, THE DAIRYMAN'S 
DAIJGHTER. 
As snug only by Wm. F. S. Lawton, in CHAS. MAcEvoY's Original 
llibernicon. 
FAix it's I'll sing a 
ditty that's funny an' witty, 
Yet ' ill waken the pity iv every one; 
It's in vain ye'll be thryin, to prevint yeersels cryin' 
An' year eyes ye'll be dliry in' when me song it is done. 
'Twas in sweet Tipperary there stud a 
nate dairy, 
Wid the name iv ' Ned Carey' wraute rawer -the door; 
An' sure Ned sould good butther, so it said on the shutther, 
'An beautiful ` googeens' a 
shillin' a 
score. 
An' he had a 
fair daughter called Mary, 
The pride iv her dad an' his dairy ; 
Oh ! she was his delight an' the pearl iv his sight, 
An' as frishky an' blythe as a 
fairy. 
Poor old Ned loved his daughter, for an angel he thought her, 
An' fine chase he bought her to make her look gay; 
An' she was the sweet crathure so full of good nathnre, 
An' as fair in ach fathure iz the blossoms o' May, 
She was naways inthrudin' an' nivir a 
feud in, 
So ye'll all be kincludite she'd ov lovers her share; 
There were thradestnin, an' dochtors, an lawyers, an' procthors, 
Cain naw ind o' miles from the divil knaws where, 
Just to get but a 
smile from, &e. 
But, so plaza you, sweet Mary loved one Paddy Ittirey, 
Who could dance like a 
fairy and twerl a 
stick ; 
'Tho his birth was a 
mysthry, he could trace his ancisthry, 
Tro the page iv histhry to Atnanochnie. 
But Mary's ould daddy didn't care for young Paddy, 
For na money had he sure a 
wife to support, 
An' a 
silky ould waver, a 
well-to-do shaver. 
Crept into Ned's favor his daughter to coort, 
An' was promised the hand, &c. 
[1] 
PRETTY MARY. (Co:cum:um 
So one day to her father, sez Mary, " 
rather 
Be single for life, than that life shud be ruled 
By a 
crawlin' old waver, an' I'd not have the craver, 
If the hair iv his head hoong wid dimonds an' goold."' 
Sez her father, " Daunt raise me, for the divil may saize me, 
If yer ever have Pat I'd as have see yer dead ;" 
Then he turned like a 
wild boor, an' bullied his child shure, 
'Till she fell on the tiled fibre, her sines all fled, 
And you wouldn't give that (
snaps the fingers) for poor Mary, (1.7c. 
But Et last she got betthur, an' wrauto Pat a 
letthur, 
Tdlin' him to forget her, an' bid him good-by,. 
Thes she gave a 
great shiver, flue away to the river, 
Axed heaven to forgive her, an' prepared for to-die 
"Come away Trom the watha,” shouted Ned, " my dear daugh-
ter, 
An' you shall wed Pat, au' have all yer dad's tin." 
But it wasn't so aisy, for the spot bein grazy, 
An' her mind belie crazy, she slipped and fell in I 
An' all down to the bottom went Mary, 
In sight iv her dad an' his dairy, itc. 
An' Mary's poor lover did never recover, 
An' his antics an' tanthrums ' twas horrid to see, 
Till he took off his garther—some forty years after, 
An' hoong himself up to—a 
mulberry tree 
An' shure ould Ned Carey follied Paddy an' Mary, 
An' haunted the dairy and kicked up a 
great din : 
An' sich shriekine an' laughter, from foundation to rafther, 
Was heard for years afther, till the house it fell in 
An' that was the end o' poor Mary, 
Her Paddy, her dad, and the dairy, 
An' from that same night I've never seen sight 
Iv the borne iv the beautiful fairy.

Who turns summersaults, boys, up in the air.

Up in the air, trp in the air, 
Swinging from swing to swing, up in the air,

thought her so handsome, so young and so fait, 
Swinging from swing to swing, up in the air. 
Her name I 
must tell was 1Sladame Devine, 
And up in the air she nightly would shine ; 
She'd hang by her jaws and then by her toes, 
And receives great applause wherever she goes. 
Up in the air, dm 
Now Lawlor the comic in love with her fell, 
And sang comic songs to charm this young irl; 
This filled me with rage and caused Inc much strife, 
To see them engaged in the great leap for life. 
Up in the air, 43:-c. 
I 
lent her ten dollars each night that I'd call, 
Gave her great . applause when she ventured to fall ; 
But now they've got married in Washington Square, 
And Wm F. and her now performs everywhere.

There are curious paple in this rum world, 
And curious things they do ; 
But I

Yes sure, its a

Who envy this mortal taste ; 
They've trot all the ingradients, but what's the odds,

Written and composed by Mn. CIIAS. MACEvOY, for his entertainment, 
and sung by W. F. S. LAWLOR. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, I'm dreaming still of thee, 
Thy spirit haunts me ever, . like fairy melody; 
When in loneliness I 
wander, or in halls of mirth and glee, 
Ah I 
my heart to thine is turning, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, dearest, I 
dream of thee alone. 
I 
think how well I 
love thee, and feel we shall be one ; 
For I 
know there is no other, e'er can be so dear to nie, 
Ali I 
when e'er I 
dream of Angels, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norali, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
ERIN TILAVOITRNEEN. 
When the pure sense of honor shall cease to inspire thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore ; 
When the nations that know thee, no longer admire thee— 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee. 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore; 
When the muse, and the record of genius disclaim tin e, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are generous and witty, 
And cease to be loved by the fair they adore; 
When thy daughters no longer are virtuous and pretty— 
Then Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more.

The birds are in their bowers, 
And the holy light 
Of the moon falls bright 
On the beautiful sleeping flowers, 
Oh ! Numb, are you waking? 
Or don't you hear me spaking? 
You know my heart is breaking 
For the love of you, Norah dear 
Ah! why don't. you speak tnavrone ? 
Sure I 
think that you're made of stone, 
Just like Venus of old 
All so white and so cold, 
But no morsel of flesh or bone. 
There's not a 
soul astir, love, 
No sound fills on the ear, 
But that rogue of a 
breeze. 
That's whispering the trees. 
'Till they tremble all through with fear. 
All ! them happy flowers that's creeping 
To your window where you're sleephig;, 
Sure they are not chid for peeping 
At your beauties, my Norah dear. 
You've the heart of a 
Turk, by my sowl, 
To leave me perched here like an owl, 
'Tis treatment too bad, 
For a 
true-hearted lad, 
To be served like a 
desolate fowl. 
You know the vow you made, love ? 
You know you've fixed the day ; 
And here I'm now 
To claim that vow,

Sure may be l'd change my mind; 
For you know I'm a 
bit of a 
rake, 
And a 
trifle would tempt nie to break; 
Faix but for your blue eye, 
I've a 
notion to try 
What a 
sort of ould maid you'd make, 
"Oh I 
Barney, win me not, love 
To be your bride to-night: 
How could I 
bear 
A mother's tear 
A father's scorn and slight ? 
So Barney, cease your sueing, 
Don't work your Norah's ruin; 
'Twould be my sore undoing, 
If you're found at my window, dear." 
"Ah I 
for shame with your sudden alarms. 
Just drop into your own Barney's arms; 
Don't mind looking at all 
For your cloak or your shawl— 
They were made but to smother your charms." 
And now a 
dark cloud rising 
Across the moon is cast, 
The lattice opes 
And anxious hopes 
Makes Barney's heart beat fast, 
And soon a 
form entrancing, 
With arms and fair neck glancing, 
Half shrinking, half advancing, 
Steps light on the lattice sill, 
When a 
terrible arm in the air 
Clutching the head of the lover all bare, 
And a 
voice with a 
scoff, 
Cried as Barney made off; 
" 
Won't you leave us a 
lock of your hair?"

Some say '

While the creature looks sly, as if nothing occured, 
While the husband looks daggers, but (Jaren% say a

TERRIBLE TINES. 
As sung by W. F. S. Lawlor in Mr. 1LtcEvor's Original Ilibernicon. 
Oh thin these are the terrible times, if you're single why so you 
must tarry 
Except a 
few fools that are mad,enough for to venture to marry 
For the bacon is ninepence a 
pound, and sorra much cheaper 
the meat is, 
And altho' but there's two of them sound, nine and a' half we 
pay for potatoes 
Oh thin these are the terrible times. 
If a 
friendly neighbour drop in, sure he walks with such funeral 
paces 
You'd think he could walk on his head he puts on such awful 
long faces. 
If a 
country friend comes up to town, he's not asked for his 
wife or his babies 
But before he has time to sit down he must tell how he left 
the potatoes. 
Oh thin these are the terrible times. 
The American bacon they say, (though the prices now and then 
vary), 
Every bit of it comes all the way, from that darlin' ould town 
Tipperary ; 
If you take a 
walk up the main street, sure its there where the 
wonderful trade is, 
Fine Cumberland cuts there you'll get, and beautiful 
floury 
potatoes, 
Notwithstanding the terrible times. 
And sure when the boys at home riz, sure the ructions were 
terribly awful, 
But the peelers soon showed them that rows, were unpleasant 
as well as unlawful ; 
[I] 
23 
TERBABL:E TIMES. [CONCLUDED. 
But sure what the row was about, there wasn't one of them 
able to state to us. 
But if "Tenant Light" wasn't the cause ! perhaps t'was about 
the potatoes, 
Or may be the terrible times. 
The Reform Bill is now all the go, but ould Ireland's left out of 
the measure, 
There's faults sure, we all of us know, which D' Israeli can see at 
his lasure; 
But if John Bright would again cross the sea, to see what our 
home borough rate is, 
We would treat him to lashons of tea, and beautiful mealy 
potatoes, 
And tell him the terrible times. 
If there was any young lady in here, who would like for to 
change her condition, 
I'm the the boy that could talk in her ear and :whisper my 
little petition ; 
l'd tell her I 
came for to woo, and move her by all my entree-
ties— 
But what else sure its nothing to you, but it wouldn't be about 
the potatoes. 
Nor yet of the terrible times. 
And now that the winter is come, its worse that the times they 
are gettin' 
But as Solomon said to his son, the divil a 
use there's in fret-
tin.' 
I'm told that Holloway's pills, cured a 
shocking bad leg of 
Tim Brady's, 
And as it cures all sorts of ills perhaps it might cure the potatoes. 
And get rid of the terrible times.

My name is Barney Brallaglien, I'm a 
gardener by trade, 
Served seven years in one situation ; 
I 
first lost my heart, then threw away my spad e ; 
Oh ! listen to my long lamentation 
Oh, my I

I

And return'd in a

Her father was a 
baker, and her mother was a 
cook, 
And they gave her a 
good education; 
She could " Parly voo Fransay," and talk it like a 
book, 
And sing it with a 
deal of animation. 
Oh, my I 
then to hear her play 
The piano, it was worth a 
fortune ; 
For hours I 
have stood at" In my cottage near a 
wood:, 
And " Love among the roses," was a 
caution. 
Oh, my I 
look upon inc now, ct.c. 
I 
courted her in silence, for " I 
never told my love," 
I 
thought she was so much above my station; 
To gain her hand and heart across the seas I'd rove, 
And try my hand at foreign emigration. 
Oh ! why did I 
leave my love behind ? 
I 
must have been a 
piece of vegetation, 
To leave off digging mould to go and dig for gold, 
And return in a 
state of agitation. 
Oh, niv ! look upon my agitation, cl:e.

Oh, my ! digging every day, 
My brow in a 
broiling perspiration; 
But credit to the bold, I 
found a 
lump of gold, 
And return'd in state of agitation 
Oh, my look upon me now, ttc. 
I 
hurried to her father's, and asked for Biddy Toole, 
And told him I'd conic across the ocean, 
With my pocket full of gold, and my heart and my liana, 
To offer my " true love's devotion." 
Oh, my ! list to his reply,—

THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
Sung by Wm 
F. SINCLAIR LAWLOR, in the laughable sketch of Barney 
and the Ghost, as performed by ClIAS. 
L&c Evor's original 
Hibernicon Troupe. 
°oh hone, wirrastrew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world 'twits the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner ; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner ; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in 
The wide mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh 'twould make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in 
To the hames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimmy the piper walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner ; 
Then at it they went dear with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner.

NEVER BE DOWN HEARTED, BOYS. 
Sung by W. F. S. LAwLoa. 
This world to some is like a

Some are always up and doing, others pine and mope,

CLIORUS. 
Should fortune frown upon you, or dark thoughts interlope, 
Banish then at once my boys,for while there's life there's liepe. 
Let's watch your noble vessel, with her happy crew on deck, 
Ere long upon the waves she's dashed, a 
dull and dismal wreck ; 
Her boats are lost, her mainmast gone, but clinging to the rope, 
You hear her seamen whisper still— while there's life there's hope 
Should fortune, arc. 
The miner underneath the ground, toils on from day to day, 
In darkness and oblivion, his life is passed away ; 
With sad mishap, or deadly damp, he often has to cope. 
His comfort still while waiting kelp— is while there's life there's 
hope. 
Should fortune, (te.

And let this little maxim cheer you, while there's life there's

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN. 
Sung by W. F. S. 
LAWLOR at Mr. Cuns. MAcEvor's Original 
lliberuicon. 
am a 
true-born Irishman, I 
come from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of friendship's 
hand; 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good-nature, mix'd together, in abundance can be found. 
'Where the boys are all so jolly, at a 
pattern, race or fair, 
For courting purty girls,none with them can compare; 
They're the bravest set or boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend; 
If his cabin you should enter, you know as well as me, 
he'll treat you with the very best—quite welcome you will be. 
he'll share his pipe and whisky, your spirits he will cheer, 
Oh! mild Ireland, you're my darling— the spot I 
love so dear ; 
For true hospitality—no matter where I've been— 
There's no place like ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have at home; 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful, as every one must own, 
And if your fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scene.ry in 'Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway, too, 
The Bay and sights round Dublin, are splendid to the view; 
I 
have traveled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle—my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin! my own dear native Isle I 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile; 
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee, as it did in days of yore. 
I 
only wish for happiness—that our troubles soon would cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace; 
May trade increase and flourish, and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so 'green.

I MAKE NO NOISE AT ALL. 
Song and dance. 
Written and composed by MR. CHAS. MAcEvoY, for the Original 
Published by W HITE, SMITH, and PERRY, Boston. 
Some people think that they must make a 
noise to get through life, 
While others are more sensible, avoiding every strife; 
The wise lay low and wait their chance, the foolish loudly bawl, 
So here's my subject when I 
dance, I 
make no noise at alL 
Dance—Then watch my motion to and fro, 
So silently about I 
go; 
You'll see the movement of my foot, you cannot hear it fall, 
For when I 
do my little dance, I 
make no noise at all. 
I 
think it very foolish to confide in every friend, 
And toll hint all your business from beginning to the end; 
You c:in't trust everybody, if you do you'll surely fall. 
Be wise in speaking of yourself, so make no noise at all. 
CHORUS. 
Now as I 
think I've said enough, then silently I'll go, 
And it I 
have made too much noise, of course you ought to know; 
I 
hope to see you here again, you're welcome when you call, 
So recommend us to your friends, but make no noise at all.

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by MARIE DALTON MACEVOY, and W. F. S. LAWLOR, In CHAS. 
MacEvor's Original llibernicon. 
There's a 
sweet little spot, away down by Cape Clear, 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear ; 
Where the white praties blossom like illigant flowers, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly above the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland. 
In his hat, good St. Patrick used always to wear, 
The Shamrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebucimdnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A bit of the blossom when he went disguised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
"When bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of Shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two twins, on the bogs and the bills, 
With a 
drop in my eye, that with joy my heart fills; 
And I've blessed the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

THE POOR HOUSE. 
Written, composed, and sung by Wm. F. SiseLAnt LAWLOR.

And if by chance you ask for relief, 
You're knocked about and called a 
thief. 
CHORUS. 
Eat, you paupers, eat, eat, you paupers, eat. 
Chop and bite lvith all your might, 
For you'll get no more till morning; 
Heigh°! here we go, into the Poor House, oh! dear oh! 
Spoken.—Beda,d, I 
was forced to go into the Poor House, that's the 
fine building, " outside," but it's awful hungry " inside," bad luck to 
the architect, every two ends of the year we're brought into a 
big 
yard and we're fed by telegraph, there's half a 
pound of meat stuak 
on the end of the telegraph wire, and there's about five hundred of 
us for that, now then, stand round, the Governor says, oh ! we're 
round enough for all we're going to get. 
Heads up—toe the line— are 
ye's ready; bang—it's gone; did you see it, Murphy ? no, no more 
didn't I, nor didn't smell it; and that's all we get from one year's end 
to the — come on, says I, to the rest of the cripples.—come on, and 
we'll make complaints, and up we went, and tho governor was sitting 
down to a 
dinner,—none of your common bits of bacon,— but beef! 
beef! be the hokey, beef—the smell of it gave me cramps—Mr. Gover-
nor, says I 
to the governor; that's the first remark I 
made to the 
governor. Well, young man, what's the nature of your complaint 
Bedad, if you only say'd the word, you'd )( Bow it. 
Hunger, that's the 
natty e 
of my complaint. Oh 1 
say'd he, I 
see you're finding fault with 
the grub of the Union, and as you're the head of these paok of revolu-
tionists, I 
shall pardon them, and punish you. 
I'll send you for two 
hours next door, on the "treadmill," and I 
was forced to go. 
Oh ! the 
" 
tread mill" is what will give you an appetite for your breakfast. 
Well, Mr. Governor, I 
don't wish you any harm, but may I 
never die. 
mail I 
see yourself and Betty, and all the ander (lancing the same 
jig that I'm dancing now. Hallo. Rooney, is this where you are? 
What are you in for. 
I'm in for nothing. Sarve you right. The next 
time you come hero for doing nothing, we'll kick you out. 
You're 
not fit to be in docent company. What's that other fellow in for ? 
Well, he was sick and the doctor told him to take something. What 
did he take 
He took a 
geoid watch! oh ! the blaguard. Well, 31r. 
Governor, how long have I 
got to go ? Two minutes. 
Ali, bedad, says 
I, I'll have the jail first. 
Well, says ho, I'll let you off this time, but 
if you ever commit the same crime, you'll go for seven days. 
So I 
started off singing— 
Bei ! here we go, out of the Poor House, oh! dear oh! 
Heigho! here we go, out of the Poor House, oh ! dear oh!

That little church around the corner," 
How dear to me the spot! 
And the' far o'er the earth I 
wander, 
It ne'er can he forgot. 
'Twas there in childhood's days I 
listened 
To the songs I

Where holy angels ever dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The sun may shine, the el uds may darken, 
No gloom this life can cast ; 
That little church around the corner, 
Will take me home at last. 
Alas! the days that were so sunny, 
Have slowly passed awti'y; 
And clouds have gathered o'er my pathway, 
Old friends no longer stay. 
Yet still I 
hear the sweet birds singing, 
'Round above the old church door; 
And holy hymns glad thoughts are bringing, 
To cheer my heart forever more! 
The sun may, &c. 
I 
care not how the world may darken, 
Or earthly friends prove cold ; 
I 
know there is a 
future for me, 
Within my Father's fold. 
And when my soul shall leave its casket, 
Free from all life's sun or storm ; 
That little church around the corner, 
Shall welcome home my mortal form.

CASTLES IN,THE AIR. 
- First introd•nced and sung in America by W . 
F. 
S. 
LAWLOR. 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing hero but troubles, hardship, toil and woe ; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, aud our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
'When first his plays came on the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find his sayings are so wise, each sentimert so true; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as if yon had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles in the Air. 
nit yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world to him had been, a 
world full of care ; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean ; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Dorm, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he bad his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in th ,‘ 
Air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wit' cherish yet his songs ; 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air.

O'er Paddy's grave the boys and girls all press'd, 
To have a

But all their sighing and their bitter woes 
Were turned from mourning into kicks and blows.

'Twas at the " Pig and Cat" 
Where Judy met her Pat, 
With his big nose so red; 
"Oh l" says he, " you're untrue; 
And, Mith, I'll punish you; 
And then she broke his head, 
Her brother `red was standing by, 
Who nately blacked her father's eye; 
For he was bold and frisky. 
Then through the boys this was the cry, 
"Ireland expects you won't be shy, 
But die for love and whiskey 1" 
The whiskey now went round, 
While hundreds deck'd the ground 
With ninny a 
broken crown 
Then Judy, danger mocking, 
A stone put in her stocking, 
To knock the devils down! 
She beat Tim Connor on the sconce, 
Floor'd dirty Dick and Joe at once, 
And killd poor Corney Disky. 
Then through the boys this was the cry, 
"Ireland expects you won't be shy, 
But die for love and whiskey l" 
At last a 
dreadful row 
Began— Ill tell you how ; 
And Paddy's nose it bled I 
It was a 
dreadful knock, 
And Patrick felt the shock, 
And then he hung his head. 
" 
0, Lord I" he cries, " I'm kilt, I 
fear; 
See how my nose is bleeding here; 
But still, my boys, I'm frisky." 
He died blind drunk upon the field, 
Crying, " Ireland expects you'll never yield, 
But die for love aud whisky."

11th May, 1745.) 
By our camp-fires rose a 
murmur 
At the dawning of the day, 
And the tread of many footsteps 
Spoke the advent of the fray; 
And as we took our places, 
Few and stern were our words, 
While some were tightening horse-girths, 
And others girding swords. 
The trumpet blast has sounded 
Our footmen to array— 
The willing steed has bounded, 
Impatient for the fray— 
The green flag is unfolded, 
While rose the cry of joy: 
"Heaven speed dear Ireland's banner, 
To-day at Fontenoy F' 
We looked upon that banner, 
And the memory arose 
Of our homes and perished kindred, 
Wftere the Lee or Shannon flows; 
We looked upon that banner, 
And we swore to God on high, 
To smite to-day the Saxons' might, 
To conquer or to die 
Loud swells the charging trumpet— 
'Tis a 
voice from our own land--
God of battles—God of vengeance, 
Guide to-day the patriot's brand; 
There are stains to wash away— 
There are memories to destroy,

true man of your word. 
Some meet a 
friend who needs their aid, they tell him witat 
they'll do, 
To help hiat on his way and at The time they mean it too; 
But out of eight, is out of mind, I've very often heard, 
And our poor friend finds out they are not true men of their 
word. 
Remember, arc. 
The trouble that such people give, is more than I 
can say, 
Appointments broken, chances lost, and caused by them each 
day; 
Through their neglect misfortunes deep, too often have occurred, 
They promise, but they don't perform, as true men o-f 
their 
word. 
Remember, Ace. 
Then learn a 
lesson from this song, in age as well as youth, 
He cannot be an honest man, who does not speak the truth; 
Unthinking men may sneer and call, my theory absurd, 
I 
ask no prouder title than, a 
true man of my word.

THE GREEN LINNET. 
Curiosity bore a 
young native of Erin, 
To view the gay banks of the Rhine, 
When an empress he saw, and the robe she was wearing 
All over with diamonds did shine; 
A 
goddess in splendor was never yet seen, 
To equal this fair one so mild and serene, 
In soft murmur she says, My sweet linnet so green, 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
The cold lofty Alps you freely went over, 
Which Nature had placed in your way, 
That Marengo, Saloney, around you did hover, 
And Paris did rejoice the next day. 
It grieves me the hardships you did undergo, 
Over mountains you travelled all covered with snow. 
The balance of power your courage laid low, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more? 
The crowned heads of Europe when you were in splendor, 
Fain would they have you submit 
But the Goddess of Freedom soon bid them surrender, 
And lowered the standard to your -wit; 
Old Frederick's colors in France you did bring, 
Yet his offspring found shelter under your wing, 
That year in Virginia you sweetly did sing, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
That numbers of men are eager to slay you, 
Their malice you viewed with a 
smile, 
Their gold through all Europe they sowed to betray you, 
And they joinea the Mtnnelitl“-
--1 on the Nile . 
THE GREEN LINNE1%—jeoNrucego.r 
Like ravens for blood their vile passions did burn, 
The orphans they slew, and caused the widow to mourn, 
They say my linnet's gone, and ne'er will return, 
Is he gone, will I 
never see him more ? 
When the trumpet of war the grand blast was sounding, 
You marched to the north with good will, 
To relieve the poor slave in their vile sack clothing. 
You used your exertion and skill. 
You spread out the wings of your envied train, 
While tyrants great emsar's old nest set in flames, 
Their own subjects they caused to eat herbs on the plains, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
In great Waterloo, where numbers laid sprawling, 
In every field, high or low, 
Fame on her trumpets thro' Frenchmen was calling, 
Fresh laurels to place on her brow. 
Usurpers did tremble to hear the loud call. 
The third old Babe's new buildings did fail, 
The Spaniards their fleet in the harbor did call, 
Are you gone, I 
will never see you more. 
I'll roam thro' the deserts of wild Abyssinia, 
And yet find no cure for my pain. 
Will I 
go and inquire in the isle of St. Helena, 
No, we will whisper in vain. 
Tell me, you critics, now tell me in time, 
The nation I 
will range my sweet linnet to find, 
Was he slain at Waterloo, on Elba on the Rhine? 
If he was I 
will never see him more.

WATERFORD BOYS.—[eoNeLuDED.1 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I; ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost! 
We are the boys, cte. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Milla murther! what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat, 
With a 
leap from the floor, came a 
top of my nose. 
Divil swape yet says I, for a 
scheming ould vagabone; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh! Moses; blue fire, Biddy! Sophia! 
The rata they are eating me up by the score! 
We are the boys, (to. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm near dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings! for what? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
When I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the divil's own face on ye, 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese! 
We are the boys, &c. 
Says he: Och ! those rats, I 
wish they would leave me, 
They ruin my trade. 
I'm not worth a 
rap. 
Says I: The five shillings now would you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every rat ? 
I 
will.—Says I; Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five shillings, 
Bad luck to the at that ye'll ever se more ! 
We are the boys, & c. 
WATERFORD BOYS. 
A IR I-" The Flaming O'Flannigana." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all in4 together; 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came; 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the same. 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
tknd, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
C11011US. 
But we are the' boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys? 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled; 
Good mornin', says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are queer, and provisions are dear; 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content. 
Says the landlord: You're right, as he brought me the bite; 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I 
went. 
We are the boys, <
h. 
My bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose: so, I 
bade ' em good-night. 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed-post.

FATHER TOM O'NEIL. 
l'ART FIRST. 
There was a 
widow lived in this place, she had three charming 
sons; 
Their father died, and left them when they were very young. 
A 
long time she endeavored to _maintain her darling sons, 
Until the youngest one becam8 f 
a 
man at the age of twenty-one. 
One night, he discoursed with his mother, these words to her did 
say: 
I 
think it will fall on one of us to go far away; 
Your land is too small to support us all, and if you would agree, 
I 
am fully bent and well content a 
clergyman to be. 
His mother being glad to hear such a 
thought come in his mind, 
She says, I 
will do all I 
can to help my darling child. 
She spoke unto his brothers, and they did soon agree 
They'd send him off to college, a 
clergymen to be. 
He was not long in college, when the Rev. Bishop Brown 
Came to examine the collegians, and viewed them all around. 
He saw this clever young man, marked him above them all, 
He was the first he did discourse when on them he did call. 
He says: Young man, where are you from ? come tell to me your 
name. 
I 
am from the County Armagh, they call me Tom O'Neil; 
My mother, she is a 
widow of a 
low degree; 
She has done her best endeavors to make a 
priest of me. 
As Thomas O'Neil then is your name, the Bishop he did say, 
Go study hard, both night and day ; 
I 
will have you soon ordained, to help your tender mother that did 
so well for thee; 
I 
will send you home, a 
credit your country boys to see. 
When this young man came home ordained ; the neighbors were 
glad to hear, 
And all that came to welcome him, came in twos and threes; 
Particularly his own dear friend to welcome him they ran, 
And you never saw such welcome as was for the widow's son. 
There was a 
man lived in this place, he was as rich as a 
Duke or 
Knight; 
He had an only daughter, she was a 
beauty bright. 
She says unto her father ; I 
will go this young man to see, 
For before he went to college he was a 
school-boy along with me. 
She was brought into a 
parlor, where she drank ale and wine ; 
She says: You are a 
clever young man, I 
would have you resign. 
What made you be a 
clergyman? you know you are astray; 
For a 
clergyman must rise by night, and travel hard by day. 
Come, take some noble lady, whose fortune will he grand ; 
You will have men to wait on you, and be a 
gentleman. 
Come, take myself, now, as I 
stand; you know my fortune is great ; 
1 
have ten thousand pounds a.year, and, at a 
death, a 
whole estate. 
FATHER TO 
O'NEIL, 
PART SECOND AND LAST. 
Re says: My noble lady, do not explain your mind; 
For, if you offer ten times more, I 
would not resign; 
For, in this holy station I 
mean to lead my life ; 
So, say lo more, my dearest dear, I 
will never take a 
wife. 
It was when he did deny her, this villain she came home: 
And in eight weeks after, her secret she let know: 
She swore, before the magistrate, that he did her beguile, 
And fur four long weeks, before she went to him, she was with 
child. 
The morning of his trial, it grieved our hearts full sore 
To see his tender mother: It grieved her ten times more 
To see her soa, a 
clergyman 
age about twenty-three, 
To be cat down, in his prime, by cruel perjury. 
Now, Tom, what is therreasou you don't marry this fair ? 
I 
think she is a 
companion for a 
duke, I 
declare: 
What are you, but a 
widow's sou, that is both poor and mean I 
You might think it a 
great honor such a 
lady to obtain 
Then Father Tom stood up and said; I 
have no witness here: 
I 
call on the Almighty and he will make Inc clear: 
I 
never said I 
would marry her, or make her my wife; 
For, I 
ueve_ knew a 
female from a 
man in all my life. 
Now, Tom, as you won't marry her, I 
will give you to understand: 
Seven long years transportation into Van Dieman's Land: 
That is bad, but it .might be worse. 
Then Father Tom did say 
Our Savior suffered more than that, when he died on calvary. 
These words were hardly spoken, when a 
horse came as swift as 
wind, 
And on him came a 
rider, saying : I 
was not here in time I 
I 
call that trial over again, I 
am lone that can reply: 
She wants two fathers for her child; that's Father Tom and I. 
I 
can tell the very moment, likewise the very spot. 
She gave me ten thousaud pounds the night the child was got. 
She said she would give me a 
thousaud more, if I 
would not let on 
She wants to make a 
husband of the Right Reverend Father Tom I 
Then, Father Tom put on his hat, and then began tt_ smile ; 
He says unto his mother ' you see how God assists your child I 
They looked on one anothee, when they found her perjury ; 
The villain was found guilty, mil his Reverence came home free,

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH. 
Words by II . 
W . 
LONGFELLOW. 
llusic by W. II. WEiss. 
Under a 
spre9ding chestnut trce 
The village smithy stands: 
The smith, a 
mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands, 
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands. 
His hair is crisp, and black and long; 
His face is like the tan; 
His brow is wet with hone t 
sweat, 
He earns whate'e he can, 
And looks the whole world in the face, 
For he owes not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn ' till n'ght, 
(14 
You can hear his beLows blo ; 
You can hear hnn swing his heavy sledge, 
With m asured beat and slow, 
Like a 
sexton ringing the village bell 
When evening sun is low. 
And children coming home from school 
Look in at the open door— 
They love to see the flaming forge 
And hear the bellows roar, 
And catch the sparks that fly 
Like chaff from from a 
threshing floor. 
Ile goes on Sunday to the church, 
And sits amongst his boys ; 
Be hears the par,on pray and preach; 
He hears his daughter's voice 
Singing in the village choir, 
And it makes his heart rejoice ; 
It sounds to him 1 
ke her mother's voice 
Singing in P.,radise; - 
Ile needs must think of her once more, 
How in the grave she lies, 
And with h 
a 
rard r )ugh hand he wii ,es 
A 
tear from out his eyes. 
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 
Onward through life he goes: 
Each morning aces some task begun, 
Each evening se 
it-- close; 
Something attempted, something donc, 
Has e:Irned a 
night's repose. 
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy fr.end, 
For the lesson thou hast aught; 
Thus at the flaming forge of life, 
Our fortunes must be wrought; 
Thus, on its sounding anvil shaped 
Each burning deed each thought.

AS GOOD AS GOLD. 
By J. II. lluanntx. 
Though fond of jollity sometimes,' 
I 
like a 
quiet life, 
And love a 
cosy ev'ning pass'd, 
At home with my old. wife; 
She brought me neither house nor land. 
Her wealth could soon be told, 
But she's a 
fortune in herself, 
And that's as good as gold. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she's as good as gold, she is, 
She's just as good as gold, 
And I 
can see she's fond of me, 
For she's as good as gold. 
She does not wear the finest robes, 
Nor dress in silk attire, 
But then if she looks fair to me, 
What more can I 
desire, 
Our house is not the grandest, but, 
As it keeps out the cold, 
It pleases me and pleases her, 
And she's as good as gold. 
Yes, she's, (te. 
When matters go a 
little wrong, 
And fortune seems to frown, 
If one's a 
wife as good as gold, 
One can't be long cast down; 
For when I 
reach my home at night, . 
She does not fret or scold, 
But always greets me with a 
smile, 
And that's as good as gold. 
For she's, &e. 
Contented, folks are happier, 
Than those who've greatest wealth, 
For gold. does not buy happiness, 
Nor can it purchase health; 
My wife and I 
will be content, 
When we have grown old, 
To be as happy then as now, 
And that's as good as gold.

WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And hero, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
ClIORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tho' richer land's I've seem. 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality., 
has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, dr.o. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &e. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &a 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass growsi green! 
For I 
love my, eco. 
THE SHAN VAN VOGH. 
You Erin's sons draw near, 
Says the elan van vogh, 
To the few lines I 
have here. 
Says the shan van vogh. 
Come join in unity, 
We'll set our country free, 
Pat an end to tyranny— 
Says the shan van vogh. 
It is the time or never, 
Says the shun van vogh, 
We are taught to act so clever

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. 
in this world of care and troub!e, 
Where men toil with hand and brain; 
Seeking fame— that airy bubble— 
And not always seek in vain. 
Though the path be strew'd with flowers, 
And the laurels bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his powers, 
lie can do without them now, 
Still he's wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds he's growing old; 
Remember thou the sage's adage— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See the warrior, brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray! 
Sternly, nobly, scorns all faction, 
And to freedom fights his way. 
flow he bears with cold and hunger, 
Houseless, homeless, 'neath the sky, 
He must march a 
little longer, 
Till he hears the battle cry. 
Then his soul is filled with glory, 
Tho' his friends lie stark and cold, 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See that great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
His seems such a 
happy fate; 
He has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely wife and children fair, 
What a 
grand ancestral dwelling, 
Surely he has not a 
care ? 
Ask his friends and they will mutter, 
By his bankers he's been sold, 
And this proves the truth I 
utter, 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
THE HUNGRY ARMY. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
thought I'd go 
and join the line, 
And as a 
soldier cut a 
shine, 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said the sergeant you are just the chap, 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back, 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army. 
cnonns. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight for glory night and morn, 
Hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout, and join us in the chorus, 
March, boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, & c. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, - 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And. fed Inc on some cabbage broth, 
To fight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A 
teaspoonful to every man, 
I 
got so fat I 
could'ut stand, 
To fight in the hungry army 
Then sound the bugle, ttc. 
They sent me out to drill recruits, 
But they kicked me with their hobnailed boots; 
Oh, take! oh, take away these brutes, 
Of this glorious hungry army. 
Now kind friends I 
must be off, 
I 
think I 
smell the mutton broth, 
Here comes Generals Howl and Scoff, 
The heads of the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, dr.c.

There are traces of wear on my elbows and knees,

Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seems to know me, 
I'm completely broken down

And meet with many a

No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to fast' instead.

Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I

Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat, 
But when I 
had no 'Note to change,' 
How soon they changed their notes 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A 
living paradox am I, 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.' 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
The time to try your friends you'll fin, 
Is when you're broken down.

fine ould Irish gintlemsn, the boy of the oulden time. 
To Donnybrook his custom was to go to every fair, 
And though he'd seen a 
few score years, he still was young when 
there, 
And while the rich they feasted him, he still among the poor, 
Would sing, and dance, and hurl and fight, and make the spal-

Like a

But och mavrone I 
once at a 
row ould Barney got a

And one that kilt him, 'cause he couldn't get o'er the shock; 
They laid him out so beautiful, and then set up a 
groan,

The shrine of holy Charity and love; 
Its doors are ever open unto sorrow,

The rich and poor are equal 'neath its portals, 
And be our path in life whate'er it may; 
No heart that needed comfort in affliction 
Was over turned uncomforted away.

No matter what the creed that it may bear! 
However we may differ in opinion, 
The warmth of Christian sympathy is there 
A word of hope and kindliness awaits ns, 
When clouds of sorrow hover overhead ; 
With no ded words of pity for the living. 
And rev'rence for the cold and silent dead. [Repeat first four lines.
