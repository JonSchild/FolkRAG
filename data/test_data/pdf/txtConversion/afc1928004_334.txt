SCANLAN & 
CRONIN'S 
" 
OUR IRISH BOYS " 
SONGSTER, 
BRIEF SKETCH OF Messrs. SCANLAN & 
CRONIN. 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN was born in Springfield, Mass., Feb. 14th, 1856, where 
his parents were of high respectability 
In 1865 William accompanied his 
parents to New York, where he regularly attended school until he was 
fourteen. 
Then the death of his father induced him to seek employment 
at the picture-frame business, in order to help his widowed mother. He 
gave much satisfaction by his intelligence and diligence to his employer, 
Mr. H. Dersenheim, of Beekruan street; but both inclination and ability 
induced him to try the stage. He made Ins debut at the Metropolitan The-
atre, Washington, D. C., meeting with great success as a 
comic singer. 
Since that time M R. SCANLAN has had very successful engagements West 
and South; but was soon induced to appear at the Olympic Theatre, New 
York, greatly to his own advantage, and much to the pleasure of the 
large audiences at that house. 
W ILLIAM CRONIN was born in the city of New York, Aug. 12th, 1854. 
As early as his eleventh year he evinced taste and talent for the stage, 
making his first appearance at the Old Bowery, where be elicited hearty 
applause by his superior dancing. 
From this time he filled excellent en-
gagements in leading houses, in various cities of the Union. 
April 9th, 1875, saw the first appearance of these two talented young 
persons as partners. 
Their that great joint hit was at Tony Pastor's Op-
era House, where SCANLAN and CnoNix " struck ile," with their great 
original " Since Terry First Joined the Gang." 
At Hooley's Theatre, 
Brooklyn, they repeated their success. 
August 23, 1875, found them com-
mencing an engagement with Mr. Josh Hart, manager of the Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway. 
Occasionally—by Mr. Hart's permission — they 
have appeared in Boston and other cities. 
Wherever they appear they 
'win applause by their great talents and undoubted originality as singers 
and dancers, and respect and friendship by their honorable conduct and 
genial manners as gentlemen. 
SciticrAN and CRONIN are sure to rise to 
the crest of the wave of popularity on which they are now borne upwards.

VTR BROADWAY POLICEMAN 
Composed by CHARLET HOWARD, and sung by EDDIE B AT. 
I 
Am a 
Broadway policeman, as you may plainly see; 
I 
was appointed to the force in eighteen seventy-three; 
I 
came from dear old Ireland, the land of the old sod, 
So now behold me here so bold, as I 
march in the Broadway 
squad. 
CTIORTIS. 
And on Broadway I 
march so gay, all rows and fights I 
stop on 
the way; 
The boys all shout as I 
turn out, " Cheese it! there's a 
cop! 
run away." 
bid good-bye to Ireland, and came across the sea, 
To land on sweet Columbia's shore, where one and all are free; 
When I 
came to this country I 
used to carry the hod, 
Till I 
fell in with an alderman, who put me on the Broadway 
squad. 
And on Broadway, etc. 
When I 
go out on duty I'm always dressed so neat; 
I 
assist the pretty girls with auburn curls across the crowded 
street; 
Then ask of them their number just merely as a 
cod; 
You'd be amazed at the girls I 
raise as I 
march in the Broad-
way squad. 
And on Broadway, etc. 
" OUR IRISH BOYS." 
As sung by Sce.rmax and ertomil, with great success. 
Ant.—" Our Boys." 
You may talk of " your boys," and your heroes Mold 
By the powers, but the Irish can boast 
A long list of heroes, of Erin the pride, 
We number " our " Boys by the host; 
Saint Patrick the first on the list I 
will place, 
Then I'll name -quite a 
lot great and small; 
From Brian Buru and the great Donagal, 
To O'Connell, the pride of them all. 
CHORUS. 
He was one of Our Boys, he was I 
We are proud of Our Boys, we are; 
He was honest and true, so give him his due, 
He was one of" Our Boys," hurrah! 
To speak of the year '98 we don't fear, 
We had many brave boys then, I 
vow, 
And in ' 48, too, we had heroes a 
few, 
With pride we remember them now; 
Robert Emmett, M'Mantts, O'Brien, O'Neil, 
0 
Donavon Rossa, O'More; 
O'Connor, and Martin, and one more I'll name, 
John Mitchell, whose loss we deplore. 
He was, etc. 
Sam Lover and Moore, were Our Boys, to be sure, 
They were Irish, there's divil a 
doubt; 
Your soldiers are Irish, wherever they show 
They soon put their foemen to rout; 
In this land of the free, where we happen to be, 
We are modest and don't make a 
noise; 
But your generals, your statesmen, and all solid men, 
Belong to the ranks of Our Boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to Our Boys, they do! 
And we're proud of Our Boys, we are; 
If they're honest and true, we give them their due, 
We are proud of " Our Boys," hurrah!

SINCE TEEM( FIRST JOINED THE GANG. 
COMIC SONG. 
Words by W M. SCANLON. 
Music by W M. CRONIN. 
The Music of this song is published by E. lIT. ITARDING, '
229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
MY 
name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terence is his name; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And he calls it a " super" and a " slang." 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joilied the " gang." 
CHORUS. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning, 
And he'll give the door the devil's own bang; 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home last Thursday night, 
Sure, I 
talked to him very nice ; 
When he said, " Old man, you're getting too fresh, 
And well soon have to put you on the ice." 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh, her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
He'll come, ete. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until nioht, 
And if the policeman says " move on," 
He'll spit, at him with spite ; 
He went to the market only yerterday, 
And there he stole a " wipe" and a " slarrr:" 
Now he's got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang." 
He'll come, etc, 
SINCE TERRY SHOOK THE GANG. 
7 
A new and original song, written and sung by 1Vrt,LIAm SCANLAN, in the 
great Irish sketch, entitled, " Since Terry Shook the Gang," 
as performed by SCAN LAN and CRONIN'. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by SCANLAN and 
Oi:oNix, in the Office ot the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'VE just came here before you 
To tell ye who I 
am, 
And about a 
darling son of mine 
Who once did lead a 
gang; 
He was the terror of the neighborhood, 
And the corners where he'd hang, 
But he's taken his father's and mother's advice, 
And entirely shook the gang. 
CHORUS. 
He's working now and lip steals no more, 
He's given up all the slang; 
God only knows how proud I 
feel 
Since Terry shook the gang. 
When he came from the Island, 
I 
was as happy as a 
duke; 
He sat down there beside the stove, 
And began to read his book; 
He says, dear father, I'll never go away, 
For I'll never more steal a 
ham; 
Oh, I've given up all card playing, 
And entirely shook the gang. 
He's working now, etc. 
He goes to church every Sunday now, 
And works then all the week, 
He stays home in the evening, 
He no longer roams the street; 
He never goes to hops or balls, 
Or strikes the door the oule bang! 
Oh, our hearts are filled with joy, my friends, 
Since Terry shook the gang. 
He's working now, etc.

O'HALLERAN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
A. new and original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, in his 
new and original sketch, entitled, " Wanted, a Lodger; Or, 
The Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
MY 
name is O'Hallera.n, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my heroism and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat as I 
walk to and fro, 
The blackguards they see me, arrah, from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar- room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all cle;p in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
plucked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'Halleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman." 
For as I 
promenade, etc_ 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I 
promenade, etc.

There's no common stock about me. 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore ; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war, 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahy, or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations ; 
With a 
good deal of larnin' in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, and wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me

GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DEWITT.) 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
cabin with, an open window. 
Enter TEDDY, with a 
bundle slung over his shoulder.] 
TEDDY.—I've had a 
hard time of it here in ould Erin, and 
although I've tried to keep up my spirits for the sake of my 
dear colleen, I've at last been forced to go over the sea. 
It's 
hard, hard times in the ould land, and I 
must be off to the 
new. 
But do you think that I 
ever can forget you, Erin dar-
ling? 
Bad luck to the Irishman that ever did! 
One more 
sweet kiss from the girl I 
love, and then for the big ship. 
This is Biddy's cabin. 
She must be up. 
I'll knock. [Knocks 
at cabin door.] 
Biddy ac,ushla 1 
[BIDDY at the open window.] 
BIDDY.—IS that you, Teddy? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint, and I'm going away; so I 
thought I'd 
come and say good-bye. 
BIDDY.—Going away so soon? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint; but it won't be for long. 
I'll soon 
clasp you to my heart again, and we shall be as happy as the 
starling. 
BIDDY.—But you'll forget me, Teddy; they say there's pret-
tier faces over there than you'll find at home, to steal away 
your heart. 
TEDDY.—IS it prettier faces there than here ? 
Why, beau-
tiful girls in ould Ireland are as plentiful as the daisies; and 
you are the queen of them all. 
I 
could never forget you, 
Biddy; don't speak like that. 
Sure among ten thousand lovely 
girls I 
couldn't see one but you. 
[Music plays the symphony of the song. 
BIDDY and TEDDY 
clasp hands at the window.] 
TEDDY sings.

We soon will meet again, love, 
When these gloomy days are gone.

There'll be joy within my soul,

The last words that you say will still 
Be ringing in my ears.

H.A 
BIDDY DOOLAN. 
AN IRISH SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by SCANLAN and CnosiN, with great success. 
IF 
you'll listen awhile unto me 
A 
purty little Irish song I'll sing you; 
It's about a 
purty Irish girl 
I 
met while I 
was walking ; 
She was standing by the slaughter- house gate; 
Says I, " Excuse me, my dear, 
Is not your name Bidelia ?" 
Oh! she gave me such a 
poke, 
Oh ! be heavens it's no joke, 
And she knocked me into 
The hands of a 
peeler. 
CHORUS. 
And it's oh, my! wasn't she purty 7 
(Symp.) 
Wrestling pots, arrah ! was her duty; 
" 
Oh," says she, " quit your fooling, 
For my name is Biddy Doolan! 
I'm an actor at the Theatre Comique, ha, ha." 
(Repeat last three lines.) 
I 
took her to a 
ball the other night, 
To Prince, one forty-two; 
Oh! the music struck a 
prance, 
And we all commenced to dance, 
And I 
did a 
Highland fling 
Through and through; 
You may talk about your Harry Clay cigars, 
Your champagne and your Vichy waters; 
Oh, we danced the whole night long, 
And I 
sung a 
bit of a 
song, 
And wound up with the mayor's daughter. 
And it's oh, my, etc. 
ADIEU TO INNISFAIL. 
Words by It. D. W ILLIAMS. AIR.—" Cruiskin Lawn." 
ADIEU! the snowy sail swells her bosom to the gale, 
And our bark from Innisfail bounds away, 
While we gaze upon thy shore, that we never shall see more, 
And the blinding tears flow o'er, we pray. 
Mavourneen, be thou long in peace the queen of song— 
In battle proud and strong as the sea! 
Be saints thine offspring still—true heroes guard each hill, 
The harps by ev'ry rill sounds free! 
Tho' round her Indian bowers, the hand of Nature showers 
The brightest blooming flowers of our sphere; 
Yet, not the richest rose in an alien clime that blows, 
Like the brier at home that grows, is dear. 
Though glowing breasts may be in soft vales beyond the sea, 
Yet ever, Gramachree, shall I 
wail 
For the heart of love I 
leave, in the dreary hours of eve, 
On thy stormy shore to grieve, Innisfail. 
But mem'ry o'er the deep on her dewy wing shall sweep, 
When in midnight hours I 
weep o'er thy wrongs; 
And bring me, steeped in tears, the dead flow'rs of other years, 
And waft into my ears home songs. 
When I 
slumber in the gloom of a 
nameless foreign tomb, 
By a 
distant ocean's boom, Innisfail! 
Around thy emerald shore, may the clasping sea adore, 
And each wave in thunder roar, " All hail 1" 
And when the final sigh shall bear my soul on high, 
And on chainless wing I 
fly through the blue, 
Earth's latest thought shall be, as I 
soar above the sea, 
" 
Green Erin, dear, to thee—Adieu

IRISH PADDIES. 
A NEW AND ORIGINAL IRISH SONG AND DANCE . 
Written by Wm/Jam SCANLAN, and performed by SCANLAN and CRONIN, 
in their original Irish sketch, entitled " The Arrival of the Delaney's." 
ARRAH, we've just come over from Ireland, 
As you can plainly see; 
We are the Tipperary couple, 
That's full of fun and glee ; 
For to sing and dance is our delight, 
We'll have yes all to know, 
And at it we always jump, my boys, 
Wherever we may go. 
CHORUS. 
For we're two Irish Paddies, (Syn.) 
Yes, we're two Irish Paddies ; 
Arrah, we are the Tipperary couple, 
That's full of fun and glee; 
For to sing and dance is our delight, 
Wherever we may be. 
Oh, the day we left ould Ireland, 
The morning it was clear, 
And as we sailed away our friends 
They all did weep in tears ; 
Saying, good-bye, my nate little Irish couple, 
We ne'er shall see yez more ; 
For ye're going away to the land of the free— 
America, lovely shore. 
For we're two, etc. 
When we landed here, in America, 
We didn't know where to go; 
We had no friends to harbor us, 
Faith! we didn't know what to do ; 
So we walked up along Broadway, 
When a 
man took us by the hand, 
Saying, I 
know by the shape of your mugs, my friends, 
Yez are from Paddy's land. 
For we're two, etc.

TED AND NORAII'S DEPARTURE FROM 
IRELAN 
D. 
A 
new and original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, in his 
original Irish sketch, entitled, " Ted and Norah's 
Departure from Ireland." 
THERE'S a 
country, Norah, darling, that lays far beyond the sea, 
Where for years I've been waiting and longing to be; 
But the time is coming, Norah, when with me you'll sail away, 
And for ever, Norah, darling, oh, happy we will be. 
CHORUS. 
Then come, love, with me, to swate America, 
And there for ever, Norah, oh, happy we'll be; 
Oh I 
come, love, with me, to swate America, 
And there for ever, Norah, oh, happy we will be. 
Don't be backward, Norab. darling., 
but remember what I 
say; 
When we've crossed the stormy ocean it will be a 
happy day; 
For it's then we'll have our freedom, and our hearts will beat 
with glee, 
In America, swate America, that dear laud of the free. 
Then come, love, etc. 
The ship's waiting, Norah, darling, so bid your friends adieu, 
I'll away and see my parents, at the ship I'll wait for you. 
NORAH.—But, Ted, my own swate darling, it gives my heart 
great pain, 
For to leave my father and mother, and cross the raging main. 
Then come, love, etc. 
I'VE A LETTER FROM MY DARLING. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by W ILL C. 
HASTINGS. 
I'VE a 
letter from my darling, 
And it came across the sea; 
Oh, it's full of sweet affection, 
That he says he has for me, 
And I 
never more will doubt him, 
For I 
know he's kind and true; 
Oh, his cheeks are like the roses, 
Dimpled with a 
mountain dew. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
letter from my darling, 
I 
will never doubt him more; 
'Tis a 
precious little letter, 
And I've kissed it o'er and o'er. 
I've a 
letter from my darling, 
And he's coming borne again; 
Ah! I 
know he fondly loves me, 
In the sunlight and th.2 rain ; 
So I'll write a 
little answer, 
But I 
scarce know what to say; 
Yes, I'll tell him that I 
love him,

MURPHY, 
LAY DOWN, 
YOU'RE NO GOOD. 
As sung by SCA.NLAN and CRONIN, with great success. 
THOUGH only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this beautiful town, 
Many strange things I've seen, and stranger ones heard, 
Which to me appeared queer, I 
must own; 
I 
don't want you to think I'm perfection, 
Nor wouldn't be, indeed, if I 
could ; 
Yet wherever I 
go, among the rich or the poor, 
There is some one to say I'm no good. 
CHORUS. 
For the boys in the shtreet they cry at me, 
In a 
way can't be misunderstood— 
" 
Will you ever go home to ould Ireland 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good." 
When first I 
arrived in this city, 
For a 
first-class hotel sure I 
went ; 
Straight up Broadway I 
wandered, 
On seeing the sights I 
was bent ; 
Into a 
neat little gin mill I 
wandered, 
Like a 
rale Irish gentleman should; 
When the puppy that stood behind the bar 
Says, you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the boys, etc. 
Says I, " My friend, do I 
look like a 
hangman, 
Or like any of that rascally crowd, 
Who in Ireland, for less than a 
shilling, 
To take a 
man's life would be proud ? 
No, indeed now, my friend, you don't know me, 
Though poor I 
may be and need food; 
Yet there's not a 
man in this country, 
Begorra, can say I'm no good." 
For the boys, etc. 
When at home I 
was a 
bit of a 
boxer, 
And could hoe my own row with the rest, 
And in many an off- hand encounter 
I 
was known to have come out the best; 
Yet I 
scarcely had reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely known, bedad, where I 
stood, 
When a 
laddy scarce up to my shoulder 
Says, Murphy, lay down, you're no good 
For th2, 
01 
MURPHY, 
LAY DOWN, 
YOU'RE NO GOOD.— 
Concluded. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang 
I 
can daily be seen at the Hall; 
And when the poor or the rich need assistance, 
By you all it must be understood, 
That there is not a 
man in the ward 
Will say, Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the boys, etc. 
THERE'S A SMILE WAITING FOR ME AT 
HOME. 
As sung by WILLIAM SCANLAN. 
TRounnE we fancy is heavy to bear, 
While travelling life's dreary way; 
Some are heart- broken with sorrow and care, 
While others are cheerful and gay ; 
The road may be rough and the journey be long, 
As over its pathway I 
roam, 
Contented I 
sing this the theme of my song— 
There's a 
smile waiting for me at home. 
CHORUS. 
The frowns of this world are nothing to me, 
Trials and troubles may come; 
I've this consolation where'er I 
may roam— 
There's a 
smile waiting for me at home. 
Weary and worn, or by labor oppressed, 
Or sneered at by folks in their pride; 
The shrine of my love and the haven of reNt, 
I 
find at my own fireside. 
Voices so gentle and hearts that are warm, 
To cheer me when trouble does come, 
I 
know there's a 
shelter in every storm, 
In the smile that awaits me at home. 
The frowns,

APPLE WOMEN. 
As sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, with great success. 
OH, we are two lonely women, 
And to you will explain; 
We have to peddle apples 
Our living for to gain; 
We had stands on the corner, 
And was doing, well every day; 
Oh, until the police came around 
And ordered us away. 
CHORUS. 
For we peddle, (Symp.) 
We peddle, (Symp.) 
Arid we're very sorry to say; 
But of course we cannot help it, 
From the corners we're turned away. 
In the papers we've looked for employment, 
But none could we get at all, 
And many an application 
We put in at the City Hall ; 
But when we'd go for our answer, 
A 
divil word would they say, 
Oh ! but take your apples and your stands, 
From the corners you must away. 
For we peddle, etc. 
Oh! if Superintendent Kennedy, 
He was alive to-day, 
We'd have our stands on the corner, 
And wouldn't, be turned away; 
But if things keep on much longer, 
I'm afraid we'll have to roam, 
And go down to the Battery, 
And tak7 ;:: c - t 
for home. 
we peddle, etc. 
APPLE VEN 
DERS. 
As sung by SCAN'LAN and CRONIN, with great success. 
IF 
you plaze, sure we are two lone widows, 
Our husbands was killed in the war; 
They enlisted one day as two soldiers, 
Faith they murdered our darlings, agra! 
From the Government we get a 
small pension, 
For us and our children to share, 
But it isn't enough to maintain us, 
So we have to sell apples and pears. 
CHORUS. 
Apples and pears, (Symp.) 
Apples and pears, (
Symp.) 
So we have to sell apples and pears. 
Sure if we were two men we could labor, 
Oh! but what can two poor women do ? 
Sure we can't sthand all day at the wash-tub, 
Oh, the reason we'll now tell to you! 
We're troubled bad with the rheumatics, 
And all other such cares, 
And that is the reason you see us 
Out here selling apples and pears. 
Apples and pears, etc. 
Ah, there's many a 
man we could marry! 
Sure there's Denny McCarty, so fat; 
There is Patsy O'Reagan, a 
foine boy, 
Be my sowl, he's a 
sound Democrat ; 
But they all do object to the children, 
And to marry us not one of them cares; 
SPOREN.—SO 
we'll let them all go to the devil, 
And we'll stick to our apples and pears. 
Apples and pears, etc.

STOWS' VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W I',treat J. SCANLON. 
AIR.—" Never go Back on the Poor." 
IP 
you'll listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this " glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference " Ill show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of " stamps," you can hold up our bead, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold— 
Let the " rich " go, but hang up the poor! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we've had now-a- days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor I 
Let me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his grave— 
A good man as ever was born— 
Jim Fisk he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast, the poor and forlorn. 
We all know be loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure; 
Though he lived like a " Prince " in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS . 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf" from the door; 
He strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his " heart on his sleeve," 
No matter what people would say, 
And he done all his deeds (both the good and the bad) 
In the broad open light of the day. 
With his grand " six- in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash " to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire" show'd the world that Jim ak, 
With his " wealth," still remembered the poor ! 
(1) 
STOKES' 
VERDICT.—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
His " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor 
New, what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this friend of the poor ? 
When such men get free, is there any one safe 
If they step from outside their own door ? 
Is there one law for the poor and one for the rich ? 
It seems so, at least so I 
say; 
If they hang up the poor, why—damn it !—the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way ! 
CHORUS. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe, 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back en the poor. 
Oh shame on this " land of the free and the brave," 
When such sights as this meet our eye! 
The poor in their prisons are treated like slaves 
While the rich in their cells they live high. 
A 
poor devil " crazy with drink," they will hang 
For a 
murder he didn't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " political friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to soend I 
CHORUS . 
But if things go on this way, we'll stand it no more; 
The people will rise up in bands; 
A Vigilance Committee we'll raise on our shore„ 
And take the law in our own hands !

THE TALK OF THE TOWN. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SHELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. 
IL H ARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
WANDER thro' life like a 
gentleman's son, 
For fortune has favored me well, 
I'm blest with good temper and love to make fun, 
No matter with whom I 
may dwell; 
I've made many friends in my rambles about, 
And gained a 
good share of renown, 
'Till now I'm so famous within and without, 
It seems I'm the talk of the town. 
CHORUS . 
I 
am the talk of the town, they say, 
Friends grow around me from day to day, 
Because I 
possess such a 
charming way, 
I'm really the talk of the town. 
Wherever I 
go it is always the same, 
I'm known just as soon as I'm seen, 
They point with their fingers and mention my name, 
While taking survey of my mien; 
I 
smile recognition and say nothing more, 
Tho' sometimes they force me to frown, 
But I 
find it's no use to give praise or abuse, 
When I 
am the talk of' the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
I'm known to the girls and I'm known to the boys, 
And legions of all human kind 
O'er- Shadow my footsteps in sorrows or joys, 
And give me a 
piece of their mind ; 
Some love me, some hate me, some say I'm a 
fraud, 
And many would fain crush me down. 
But such is the fate of the good and the great, 
It's because I'm the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc.

WE'RE ALL GOING TO FIGHT FOR DEAR 
OULD IRELAND. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and sung by ScANLAN and ClIONIN 
A111,--" Marching through Georgia." 
ARRAH, here we are, two Irishmen, as you can plainly see, 
We've lately left ould Ireland and come across the sea; 
But it won't be long till we return with comrades brave and 
bold, 
For we're all going to fight for dear ould Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah! hurrah! mild Ireland shall be free, 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! ould Ireland shall be free, 
With muskets bright and hearts so light, 
We'll gayly march away, for we're all going to fight 
For dear ould Ireland. 
And when we do return again with warriors brave and gay, 
Our friends will all join in the ranks as we gayly march away; 
We'll buy them guns and bayonets, and plenty of powder too, 
For we're all going to fight for dear ould Ireland. 
Hurrah! hurrah! etc. 
There was dear Robert Emmett, who's now laid in the clay, 
Likewise Daniel O'Connell, who suffered many a 
day, 
When clutched by British tyranny, 0! then was trampled 
down, 
But died in the cause of liberty. 
Hurrah! hurrah! etc.

REER WE HAVE AND HAVE NOT. 
As sung by SCANLAN and Citom 
Now, a 
few days ago, while on things ruminating, 
I 
thought of the Present, I 
thought of the Past; 
I 
thought of the strange things we're every day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task; 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom, 
We have not Lafayette, who from France came to fight; 
But we have Mr. Grant and his needy relations, 
Who want the third term, just to make matters right. 
We have not Andrew Jackson with cotton bales fighting, 
But we have the brave Shgrincen who marched to the sea; 
We have not Billy Tweed, who befriended the poor man, 
But we live in fond hopes that he'll soon be set free! 
We have not poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago; 
But we have John Gildersleeve, whom a 
judge we have made, 
And Moody and Sankey, who set people cranky, 
And send you to glory all stamped and prepared. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves freedom, 
But we've Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And I'm proud now to say we possess with great pleasure, 
The bold rifle team, who great laurels did win; 
We have lost our great father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade; 
But we've gallant Phil Sheridan, who at Winchester riding 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also, 
Ben Butler still with us, one eye on the spoons, 
And Brigham Young still keeps a- getting new wives, sir, 
And his life he's still spending in sweet honeymoons ; 
Though we've lost the brave leaders who won for us freedom, 
And the stars in our banners so firmly did fix, 
Yet in next year's Centennial we'll prove to the Nation 
We remember the heroes of old Seventy- Six.

beamed in 
the smile 
of 
my brave 
I - rish boy. 
'Tis true he has left me, but sure he'll return 
To the land of his fathers, nor leave me to mourn; 
The heart that is brave no inconstancy knows, 
Though honor compels it to conquer our foes. 
Then why should I 
grieve me? Though time linger slow, 
Its motion is certain as waters that flow: 
With him, then, I'll wander, nor know other joy 
Than the presence and smile of my brave Irish boy. 
As sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, with great success. 
ONE night as I 
was coming home 
I 
chanced to meet a 
friend ; 
He took me in a 
beer saloon, 
For he had twenty cents to spend ; 
I 
came rolling home next morning, 
So tipsy and so tight, 
That my wife she cried a- mourning: 
" 
Let him alone, he'll come all right." 
cuonus. 
So then, boys, of me take warning. 
And don't stay out at night, 
Or yell have the fo!ks a- bawling— 
" 
Let him alone, he'll come all right." 
It's yesterday, a 
week ago, 
I 
went down to Baxter street, 
In hopes to buy a 
suit of clothes, 
Of a 
man named MacGleet; 
He showed me a 
suit was handsome, 
But then so awful tight; 
He said he'd sell them at ransom, 
For he knew they'd come all right. 
So then, boys, etc 
I 
asked the Jew, then, what he meant : 
lie kicked up a 
terrible row ; 
He said I 
owed him fifty cents, 
So I 
struck one good blow; 
I 
just walked out the hallway, 
And then I 
took to flioht; 
When a 
police from Galway squealed : 
" 
Let him alone, he'll come all rioht!" 
So then, boys, etc. 
At last I 
was overtaken, 
And fetched down to the Tombs; 
My limbs they were a- shaking, 
As I 
heard the convicts' tunes ; 
The judge he then got seated, 
His name was Justice White ; 
He said I'd be elevated, 
For he knew I'd come all right. 
So then, boys, etc. 
31 
LET HIM ALONE, WE'LL CONFF1 ALL RIGHT. 
Concluded. 
A 
six months on the Island 
My sentence then was read; 
It's there that I 
got widened, 
For I 
was very seldom fed ; 
My cell was just two feet in height, 
Without a 
candle- light; 
But oh, it will be a 
horrible death, 
If you don't tumble to me to- night. 
So then, boys, etc. 
DINA KITTY ANNA. MARIA. 
As sung by WILLIAM SCANLAN, with great success. 
lwas in the merry month of June 
When the birds were in full tune; 
it was there I 
met my charming little creature, 
And her eyes they sparkled bright, 
Like the twinkling stars of night, 
And a 
smile, oh, she wore on every feature ; 
I 
says, my own dear belle, 
Your name to me, pray tell; 
You're just about the style to admire, 
And she tossed her pretty head, 
And so blissfully she said, 
Oh, my name is Dina Kitty Anna Maria. 
CHORUS. 
If you should see her feet, 
As she tripped along the street; 
She was just about the suite to admire, 
And she tossed her pretty head, 
And so blissfully she said, 
Oh, my name is Dina Kitty Anna Maria. 
Arrah, I 
took her to a 
ball, 
Down to Military Hall, 
And ' tis there you should see her dance the Lancers ; 
As round the room she'd go, 
On her light fantastic toe, 
Oh, great Gosh! she astonished all the dancers; 
A 
polka she could dance, 
Like any girl from France; 
I 
tell you, my boys, she's a 
flyer 
Oh, yes, she is a 
stunner, 
From her bonnet to boot-leather, 
Is my charming Dina Kitty Anna Maria. 
If you should see, etc.

A TERRIBLE EXAISIPLI. 
Words and Music by JosErn P. SHELIA'. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1875, by E. H. HARDING. 
MCGEE was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
He came from the divil knows where ; 
Of whiskey, he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a" tare." 
He was often persuaded to alter 
His habits, and live like a 
man ; 
But whenever he tried, he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS. 
McGee was a 
terrible man, 
He was always so flighty and frisky ; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he hadn't his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent ould woman. 
And scolded from mornin' till night ; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
McGee was, etc. 
She went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee ; 
He promised to help the poor creature— 
" 
go over next mornin'," says he. 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A song, with his glass in his hand ; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand ! 
McGee was, etc. 
" 
Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence, 
" 
I 
hope you will alter your ways ; 
I've come now to give you deliverance 
From the evil that's blighting your days !" 
"'Pon me sowl!" says McGee, " I 
am ready, 
I'll stop with the greatest of cheer ; 
But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
dhrop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was, etc. 
(1) 
A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.—Concluded. 
" 
Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
" 
You'll show us how good you can be ; 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance 
All drinks of whatever degree ; 
" 
Noble man, you shall have our assistance— 
In a 
week the result we will see." 
McGee was, etc. 
Spox IN —The reverend gentleman, after some further per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life had a 
severe effect upon him ; he lost all his exuberant spirits, br-
ing entirely under the control of his wife and the temperance 
advocates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, 
and worked him into such a 
queer state—half comfort, half de-
spair— that he Nvould often say to himself, " Beg-ob, Fm ncd, 
meself at all !" 
At last they induced him to state in a public 
meeting the various benefits he had derived from his adherence 
to the pledge—the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and 
peace of mind he had experienced during his short season of 
sobriety. 
He attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave 
countenance, related his experience as follows: 
RECITATION. 
Good people, 
stand here before you to- night, 
Me mouth very dhry, and me bead very light ; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined in the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left off me mild pranks! 
And ever since then, sure, me life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all me, debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
] 
took from the pawn shop me loin Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the ould woman's shoes— 
A moighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's !" 
I 
made a 
new sty for the fine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs ; 
whit to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday mornin' ( don't think that I'm scoffin'), 
I 
bought for me body an illigant coffin! 
For I 
know if my whiskey is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee. 
McGee was, etc.

MY INITIATION; OR, HOW I JOINED THE 
ODD FELLOWS. 
As sung by Wrwem SCANLAN, with great success. 
Words by JOHN POOLE, Esq. 
Copyrighted. 
YE 
brothers of the mystic tie, 
Unto my song give ear, while I 
Tell you the when, the where, the why, 
got initiated; 
One Jolly Green, a 
friend, d'ye see, 
With whom I'd often made quite free, 
One day he chanced to say to me, 
•‘ Why don't you an Odd Fellow be?" 
My name unto the Lodge I 
sent, 
The initiation fee I 
spent, 
And along with him one evening went— 
To be initiated. 
CHORES. 
That time I 
never have forgot, 
With the gridiron roaring hot, 
And the goat, which round the room did trot, 
When I 
was initiated. 
First my eyesight they did blind, 
Then they tied my hands behind ; 
I 
really thought it was unkind 
For to be so badly treated; 
While I 
around my way did feel, 
Upon sharp tacks they made me kneel; 
Then, with a 
grasp that made me reel. 
They bound me on a 
monstrous wheel! 
Then whirled me round with lightning speed. 
My agony they did not heed; 
Oh, I 
only wish my hands were freed, 
When I 
was initiated. 
Music by 'I'. YATES. 
That time, etc. 
They gave me next a 
shower- bath, 
Which further did increase n'y wrath, 
And one sang out, " The Rugged Path, 
There let the wretch be seated !" 
Then up a 
ladder, a 
mile or more, 
And down they plunged me with a 
roar, 
Until, with bones all bruised and sore, 
At length I 
sprawled upon the floor ; 
" 
Do let me up !" I 
cried, 
But I 
found my feet together tied, 
And on a 
rail I 
took a 
ride, 
While being initiated. 
(1) 
That time, etc. 
MY INITIATION.—Concluded. 
Then suddenly somebody said, 
" 
Let the unenlightened wretch be bled, 
And place the pitch- cap on his head, 
Let his nose be nutmeg grated; 
Put mustard piasters on his feet, 
And then to make the work complete, 
That he may have a 
warmer seat, 
The great gridiron quickly heat !" 
Then I 
thought I 
should give up the ghost, 
When on it I 
was placed to toast, 
I 
felt again, smelt something roast, 
When I 
was initiated. 
That time, etc. 
A 
sulphurous smell now filled the air, 
And I 
heard four hoofs behind me tear, 
When I 
knew that horrible goat was there! 
Oh, wasn't I 
aggravated ? 
I 
again was seized, on his back was bound, 
With a 
kick and a 
plunge he rushed around, 
With such terrible speed to go over the grotn, 1 
I'm sure no velocipede ever was found ; 
My ears were stunned by the awful din, 
As he sped up and down, and out and in ; 
I 
thought a 
whole bone wasn't left in my skin, 
When I 
was initiated. 
That time, etc. 
As I 
wondered what trial the next would be, 
A 
voice proclaimed : " Ye may set him free, 
If he'll take the oath he hears from me. 
That I'd do it I 
quickly stated, 
And these were the terrible words I 
spoke : 
" 
I 
promise never to drink or smoke, 
Never to laugh and never to joke, 
Or my nose into other folks' business poke." 
My eyes were unbound, and I 
looked around, 
Found myself in the Lodge-room safe arid sound, 
And I've never regretted the night, I'll be bound, 
When I 
was initiated. 
C110P.US. 
Oh, no, the time I'll ne'er forget, 
When first I 
saw that friendly set, 
Whom as brother Odd Fellows I've often met, 
Since I 
was initiated.

AN ILIGANT WAVE. 
Au.—" Darling OuId Stick." 
Sung by BILLY A SHCROFT. 
IN 
Dublin, that city of riches and fame, 
A shoemaker died, Jerry Flynn was his name, 
The neighbors all grieved, rich and poor, high and low, 
And to the wake of poor Jerry resolved for to go. 
Spatz Ex.—Poor Jerry! Though he often half-soled shoes, he 
was a 
tr.o/e-souled man himself, and many's the job he done for 
nothing 
lie mended Tim Reilly's brogans, and pegged Mrs. 
M'Carthy, and gave her a new patch on her upper, an' all for 
sixpence; so no wondher they all came to his wake. 
Tim 
Donohoe wint for a 
coach for the ladies ; he stuffed the fine soft 
straw feather bed in the bottom of Con Casey's wheelbarrow ; 
he smoothed down the long feathers for fear any of them might 
stick in the ladies, and hurt their—feelings, as he handed them 
in. 
CHORUS. 
Mrs. Casey and Mrs. O'Blaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow 11-!laney, 
An I 
the iligant Judy M'Shaney, 
To go to the beautiful wake. 
All dressed out so neat in their best Sunday clothes, 
Wid Doherty showing his jolly red nose, 
And another big party about twenty score, 
All met them a 
knocking at Jerry Flynn's door. 
SPOKEN —" Mrs. Flynn ! Mrs. Flynn ! why the blazes don't 
you open the door 7 
Here's the quality coming to Jerry's wake. 
Stick him up slantindickler in the bed; clap a 
cane pipe in his 
mouth and put a 
nightcap on him, that he may look nate and 
dacint. 
Mistress Biddy, will you shake some cane straw in the 
corner for the company to sit down on 
There yees are all now 
as snug as a 
bug in a 
rug. 
Come. now, Darby Reilly, while 
Nelly's mixing the punch, will you just tip us a 
bit of a 
song ?" 
" 
Faix I 
will, tnam; I'll give you a 
verse from the Opery of Go 
to the Divil and shake yourself." " Silence! Pat Doyle, I'll run 
a 
sod of turf in your gob if you don't hould your tongue. Darby 
Reilly is going to sing; silence." 
(Sings in a 
drawling tone.) 
A IR.—" Raging Canawl." 
Oh, once I 
never thought I'd be 
In this dejected state, 
A 
poor, forlorn effi2y 
Bound down by hardship's fate. 
(I) 
AN ILIGANT WAKE.—Continued. 
The birds that flutter on you tree, 
With terror strike my heart; 
Aich star I 
see alarums me— 
Oh, why did I 
des- art'? 
F-oKEN.—" Oh, wow, ow! I 
can't bear to sing any more, it's 
too distressing for my delicate nerves. 
Missus M'Nulty, will ye 
thry a 
song, mam ?" " Thoth I 
will, Darby. 
Here goes." 
(Mrs. ill'Nulty sings.) 
Och ! one evening for dervarsion's sake 
As I 
walked out alone, 
I 
heard a 
fay male lady bright 
Making her piteous moan. 
She wrung her hands and tore her hair, 
And to herself did cry. 
Aarrah, Sohnny dear, don't murther me, 
For if you do I'll die. 
SPEN.—Here's Nelly wid the punch, Low hand it round to 
Mrs. M'Carthy and Mrs. 0 
Blaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
And the beautiful Judy M'Shaney, 
And all at the iligant wake. 
Now the whiskey went ro-
ancl till they couldn't agree, 
Who was of the best rank or the best family; 
They from words came to blows, and their fists didn't spare, 
And by handfuls they pulled out each other's hair. 
SPOKEN — Oh, ladies! ladies! aren't you forshamed av your-
selves, to behave like a 
set of jackasses! Oh Judy, Judy ! Judy! 
Divil roast me but they've got Jerry in amongst them ; they'll 
bate the life out of the corpse. 
Here, catch bonit of his toe and 
pull him out of the scrimmage 
Haul away, here. 
We've got

Oh, bad luck to me, but they've faive MIT) a

The brutes! to murther a poor dead twin that way! 
Oh, he'll never g:et over it; give me the broonisick, tilt I

THE BLIND PIPER OF BLARNEY. 
By S. 
SIDNEY. 
Ant 
Kate Kearney." 
Have CoII been to the sweet groves of Blarney ? 
And heard of the Blind Piper Barney ; 
Who since he was born, 
Ne'er beheld the bright morn, 
Nor the bright charming scenes around Blarney 
He looked the picture of gladness, 
Ne'er a 
trace in his features of sadness; 
For mar 's 
the while, 
A 
sweet merry smile, 
Would escape from the lips of blind Barney. 
Ne'er a 
wake or a 
wedding in Blarney, 
But was graced with the presence of Barney, 
While jigging away. 
Would merrily play, 
On the pipes so nimble would Barn2y. 
Should von visit the sweet groves of Blarney, 
And ask for the blind piper Barney 
They answer och hone, 
Show von the stone, 
'Neath which lies the blind piper Barney. 
IT'S LITTLE FOR GLORY I CARE, 
By CHARLES LEVER, Esq. 
Aut—" The Grinder." 
It's little for glory f 
care ; 
Sure ambition is only a 
fable ; 
I'd as soon be myself as Lord Mayor, 
With lashins of drink on the table. 
.1 like to lie down in the sun 
And drame when my faytures is scorchin, 
That whi-n I'm too old for more fun. 
Why, I'll marry- a 
wife with a 
fortune. 
And in win er with bacon and eggs, 
And a 
place at the turf fire basking, 
Sip my pu-ch as I 
roasted my legs, 
Oh ! the divil a 
more I'd be asking. 
For I 
haven't a 
.janius for work, 
It was never the gift of the Bradiee, 
But I'd make a 
mot illigant Turk. 
For I'm fond of tobacco an I 
ladies. 
THE BELLS OF SHANDON. 
Composed by FATHER FROUT. 
k
-V.ith deep affection and recollection, 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
\Vhosc, sound so wild, would, in days of eniklioA, 
_Fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, whereer I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, ox 
"With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lec. 
rye heard bells chiming full many a 
clime 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrato; 
But all their music spoke not like thine! 
'or mem'ry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river tee. 
I've heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole in— 
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
ut thy sounds were sweeter than the dome cri 
Pete 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly— 
Oh! the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and ?Soak°, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud in air calls men to prayer, 
'From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
such an empty phantom I 
freely grant them` 
But•there's an anthem more dear to me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee!

Sad is my fate! said the heart-broken stranger; 
The wild-deer and wolf to a

But I 
have no refuge from famine and danger,— 
A 
home and a

Never again, in the green sunny bowers, 
Where my forefathers lived, shall I 
spend the sweet hours, 
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike to the numbers of Erin Go Bragh! 
Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken. 
In dreams I 
revisit thy sea- beaten shore ; 
But, alas! in a 
far foreign laud I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more. 
Oh ! cruel fate ! wilt thou never repla(.e me 
In a 
mansion of peace—where no perils can chase me ? 
Never again shall my brothers embrace me, 
They died to defend me, or live to deplore. 
Where is my cabin-door, fast by the wild wood? 
Sisters and sire! did ye weep for its fall ? 
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood ? 
And where is the bosom- friend, dearer than all ? 
Oh! my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure, 
Why did it doat on a 
fast fading treasure ? 
Tears, like the rain-drop, may fall without measure; 
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall. 
Yet all its sad recollection suppressing, 
One dying wish my lone bosom cau draw; 
Erin, an exile bequeathes thee his blessing! 
Land of my forefathers! Erin Go Bragh! 
Buried and cold, when my heart stills her motion, 
Green be thy fields, sweetest isle of the ocean ! 
And thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion— 
Erin Mavourneen!—Erin Go Bragh!

Price 40 cents. 
I 
was sighing in my sleep, love, 
When a 
bright pearly tear 
Came a- trickling down my cheek, love, 
For my dream was very dear; 
I 
dreamt thou'd learned to doubt me, 
I 
felt thine eyes were cold; 
For they shed no joy about me, 
As in loved days of old. 
CHORE'S. 
May the adage then hold true, dear, 
That reverses all our dreams, 
And the darkest clouds of night, dear, 
At morn be love's bright dreams. 
I 
was sighing in my sleep, love, 
And dreamt the love had flown, 
That in our bright youthful days, lov;!, 
Had made thee all my own; 
Then I 
tried to find the light, love, 
That was ever in those eyes; 
But tears had dimm'd the sight, love. 
And left me naught but sighs. 
May the adage etc. 
I 
was sighing in my sleep, love, 
But brushed away the tear; 
Quickly with it went the grief, love. 
That filled my soul with fear; 
For the storm was o'er, and stars, love, 
Twin stars be:ran to shine ; 
I 
awoke and found thy eyes, love, 
Were gazing into mine.

THERE'S a 
cot in old Ireland that stands near a 
brook, 
Where my daddy's own darling was born, 
And into the parlor the pigs used to look, 
And the cow with the crook in her horn, 
And the chickens and the ducks used to make n.orLing ca!is 
With the neighbors that around us did dwell ; 
But what was the charm in my father's mud \Valk 
'Twas the whiskey with exquisite h !
nen. 
'Twas our whiskey with exquisite smell. 
Our garden abounded with flowers so bright, 
The richest old Erin could boast; 
Such a 
beautiful blending of red green, and white, 
Which enchanted we knew not the most; 
But oh, not a 
flow'r where the bee could repose, 
With fragrance could ever excel 
The scent that at eventide always arose 
From our whiskey with exquisite smell. 
From our whiskey with exquiz,ite smell. 
0:d Erin, the maidens that trip o'er thy mounts, 
They're as bright and as fair as the day ; 
They're as pure as the Ivazers that flow from thy founts,

THAT GIRL ACROSS THE WAY. 
Words and Music by Joscrn P. SKELLY, 
Music may be had of E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New Yori. 
I 
SAW her peeping through the blind, 
With a 
laughing, roguish eye, 
And every time I 
looked at her, 
She smiled a 
sweet reply ; 
I 
fell so much in love with her, 
She led me quite astray; 
But soon I 
found she was a 
flirt, 
That girl across the way. 
CHORUS. 
For she was a 
naughty flirt, 
She fool'd me ev'ry day, 
Oh, boys, beware and never stare 
At girls across the way. 
My duties ail were left undone, 
Like a 
fool I 
did behave, 
I 
could not tear my eyes away, 
In truth I 
was a 
slave ; 
From morn till night it was the same, 
The same from day to day ; 
In fact I 
was enchanted by 
That girl across the way. 
For she was etc. 
She flirted with her handkerchief, 
She flirted with her fan ; 
You know how girls can use such things 
To captivate a 
man; 
Distraction fili'd my heart and brain. 
While she her tricks did play, 
Anil still I 
could but gaze upon 
That girl across the way. 
For she was, etc. 
I 
threw her kisses with my bands, 
And she returned the same, 
And soon I 
felt within my breast 
A 
strange consuming flame; 
At last I 
begged her to conic down, 
And hear what I 
should say, 
She came, and with her came a 
man 
Who lived across the way. 
For site was, etc.

" 
How dare you," said this man to me, 
" 
Make faces at my wife ? 
Be careful, sir, or you may find 
Yourself without a

I 
ventured to apologize, 
But such was my dismay, 
They only laughed, and said, " Beware 
Of girls across the way !"

Tell - ing her you'll wed her when the days grow short. 
See, when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays, 
Out in the midnight making the heart light, 
Waking the " dickey birds" before the break of day ; 
Tickling and teasing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots of little fibs, and saying they are true ; 
Some say 'tis naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait a 
moment, and I'll tell you what to d4. 
Cuo.—Wait till the moonlight, die. 
Homeward retreating, one sad heart heatinz. 
Now she must bid you the last good-night; 
She fondly wishes those stolen kisses 
Could last till to-morrow morning's broad daylight, 
Out goes the gas-light, then comes the " good-night," 
Carefully she raises the latch with her key; 
See then the dear miss rush for the last kiss, 
Mind what you tell her when you next m—t—

lie loves me, too, with heart so true, 
This charming beau of mine. 
He dresses in the latest style, 
And wears a 
diamond ring, 
And when he's out in company, 
How sweetly he can sing; 
His business, well, upon my word, 
It must be something fine ! 
For he has always lots of cash, 
This charming beau of mine. 
0, isn't ho, 
His collar reaches to his ears, 
And such a

That he may cut a

And says it's ( ah !) dooced fine ! 
While drinking lager beer with me—

As sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, in their original act, entitled, ‘ Tu 
Arrival of the Irish Emigrant" 
VE just come here from Ireland, 
And I'm trying to get some work, 
And I'm looking for an Irish girl, 
Miss Mary Ann McQuirck; 
She landed just two years ago, 
From darling ould Kildare; 
She wrote to me to Ireland, 
Saying, come to Mike O'Flayher. 
CHORUS. 
So I've c,)me here to find her, 
And I'm looking all around; 
My heart will break, I 
know it will, 
if soon she isn't found! 
But I'll go and look about a 
bit, 
For sure I'd not despair ; 
I 
am bound to find my Mary Ann, 
The girl from ould Kildare. 
W-11, I'm going to do the best I 
can; 
When I 
get a 
job of work, 
I'll settle down for life, 
And marry Mary Ann McQuirck, 
And then I'll write to Ireland, 
And tell the people there, 
That I 
am married to my Mary Ann, 
The girl from ould Kildare.

DON'T FORGET OULD IRELAND. 
As sung

Arrival of the Irish Emigrant." 
Ir's a 
welcome day for us, my friends, 
'Tis years since last we met, 
And though we're in America, 
Ireland we won't forget ; 
For there we many happy hours 
In gladness passed away, 
Ere poverty drove us from home, 
And darkened life's young day. 
CHORUS. 
There's the poor in poverty, 
Sick, and suffering sore; 
Will she ever be free from want, 
Dear ould Ireland's shore ? 
The land that dear Saint Patrick ble;N N i 
Now striving hard in vain 
To free herself from tyranny, 
And break her bondage chain. 
The darkest clouds hang like a 
pall 
About ould Ireland's shore ; 
Will rays of sunlight ever COIIIP, 
Shine on her poor once more ? 
To clear her troubled path of th ,,rn, 
And make her burden light ; 
To give her strength, that Irishmen 
May battle for her rights.

A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cabin. 
Enter TIM FLAHERTY, singing or whist-
ling "The Girl I 
left behind me." 
Bundle and stick on 
shoulder.] 
TIM — Bad luck to it, here I've been trotting over the bogs 
for the last week since I 
landed on me own native sod, and 
sorra a 
bit have I 
seen of the darlint I 
left behind me when I 
went over the say. 
I 
wonder where she hides her own pretty 
face. 
Sure, it's of her I've been dreaming since I 
sailed away 
in the big ship, night and day. I 
went over beyant to seek 
me fortune, and it's devil a 
fortune I 
was after finding at all at 
all. 
When I 
landed at Castle Garden, devil a 
castle or a 
garden 
I 
found there; but a 
big chap sez to me: " Can you work ?" 
sez he. " I 
can," sez I. " What at?" sez he. " Anything," 
sez I. " All right," sez he ; " I'll make a 
builder or an archi-
tect of ye," sez he. " What's an architect ? " sez I. " Why," sez 
he, " thim's the boys that builds up the houses." Sure I 
thought 
me fortune was made. " Follow me," sez he. " 
sez I; 
and away we went into an illegant part of the city, I 
think 
they called it Baxter Street, and there I 
met me old friend, 
Tim Finnegan, who lives there. 
And he was an architect, 
too ; and the first thing I 
knew after, I 
was breaking the 
small of me back going up a 
pair of stairs without any ban-
isters, and carrying a 
load of bricks. " Is this what you call an 
architect in this country ? " sez I. " It is," sez he, " Then I 
resign," sez I. " All right," sez he. 
And here I 
am. 
I'll 
sing ye a 
song all about me own adventures, and then I'll go 
on me travels again, for I 
feel like the devil knows what till I 
see me own little Irish girl once more. 
[Song is played. 
Between each verse "Rory OrMore" is 
played, or any other jig tune, and TIM dances. 
At the last 
verse he exits dancing and swinging stick.]

So I 
went to the wort, and explained to the judge. 
He called me a

vagrant and loafer,

So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
(Mid Erin for ever, oh, she is my joy! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
ride Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door, 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the sea; 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.— Cho.

HE 
takes me gently round the waist, 
He holds his arm just so, 
I 
place my willing hand in his, 
And gayly off we go; 
He's never weary of the dance, 
And I'm about the same, 
And when the music sounds no more, 
I 
cry, Oh, what a 
shame ! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed, Fin quite sorry when the dance is 
over; it seems like waking from a 
sweet little sleep. 
Of course 
my Charlie is the whole cause of it—everybody is aware of 
that— because you know— 
CHORES. 
He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
So graceful he can go, 
Oh, he's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
My darling, dancing beau ! 
Around the floor with many more, 
We go in wild delight ; 
We think of nothing but the dance. 
IVIdle in the mazy flight; 
We seem to float upon the air, 
Like angels from above, 
And everywhere we take our share 
Of music, dance, and love. 
SPOEEN.—Under some circumstances it might 
delightful, but with him it's—well, you can guess 
when I 
say— 
not seem so 
now nice it is 
ITe's such, etc. 
55 
HE'S SUCH A LOVELY WALTZER.—Continueu. 
• 
I 
can't endure those old quadrilles, 
And reels— oh, gracious, don't, 
Don't speak of them ; if you insist, 
I 
plainly say I 
won't ; 
I'm far above those worn out things, 
They're much too full of halts ; 
No dance to me can ever bring 
Such pleasure as the waltz. 
SPOKEN —And he's such a 
glorious fellow ! 
Sometimes when 
the dance is over he says," Come, love, and have some soda water. 
You like soda water, I 
suppose ?" I 
tell him I 
do like it very 
well. 
Then he says, " Soda I 
I" 
And if there happens to be a 
bright moon looking down from the sky, he often tells me that 
he wonders which looks the most glorious, the moon or my 
eyes. 
I 
say, " hush I 
don't talk nonsense." 
But then I 
don't 
care what he says—my admiration is all based upon the fact 
that— 
He's such, etc. 
With mellow strains from jolly Strauss, 
And gleaming lights around, 
Our forms entwined, our joy combined, 
We hear the gladsome sound; 
We think no more of worldly woe, 
While quickly flies the time; 
The music comes so soft and low. 
I 
think it quite sublime. 
SPOKEN.—Sublime, did I 
say 1 Yes, that's just the word. 
T 
may seem a 
little enthusiastic, but T 
can't help it 
It's all be-
cause—

For a 
single young man he vill stay.

And he has such a 
naughty way, 
That one girl to another will say: 
Beware! beware! beware !

There's old Mrs. Brown with a 
daughter so sweet, 
She thought him an excellent beau ; 
She allowed Mary Jane his attentions to meet, 
And told ber to never say no ! 
But then there came a " mutual friend," 
With tales that seemed to have no end ; 
These warning words she heard with pain : 
`• Believe me what I 
say, Mary Jane— 
Beware, beware, beware!" 
He isn't, etc.

To whisper these words in her ear— 
"Beware, beware, beware !"

HOME RULE. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Composed by M Any LENNEN. 
Copyright, 1875, by JOHN ROACH. 
IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free, and the star of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullin,gar. 
CHORITS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main? 
Gladstone he may rave, hut our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice be never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc.

You see I 
belong to New York, my boys, 
On dear old Manhattan Isle, 
Famed for its wealth and its beauty, boys, 
Its darling dear girls and their style ; 
On Broadway, my boys, or the Bowery 
No stranger e'er met with a 
frown ; 
Take my word, I 
belong to the city, 
And hail from the East Side of town. 
ClIGRUS. 
The East Side of town 
Beats the world up and down 
For plc- me, party, or ball, 
For boys without fear, 
And good lager beer, 
The East Side of town beats them all. 
The dandies they dance on the Avenue V, 
In aristocratic soirees, 
Champagne they drink as if it were tea, 
Their pa's and their mamma's to please; 
They should see the quadrille called the NMI Pin, 
Or a 
real old-fashioned break-down; 
They pivot, you bet, on a 
spangle, 
The girls from the East Side of town. 
The East Side, etc. 
.The mechanic you will find there too, 
The industrious laboring class, 
The sewing girl from her labor and toil 
On the sidewalk cloth cheerfully pass; 
She is happy indeed, and little doth need, 
If she has but a 
calico gown ; 
We all do agree that if jolly you'd be, 
You must live on the East Side of town.
