REGAN'S PARTY, 
WORDS AND MUSIC BY WM CARROLL. BUNG BY ME 
SITTRPHYs. 
MUSIC PUB. la COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. RIEDER. 
It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh ! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan be felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
Cnouus. 
Oh such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word 'twos really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in band, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the. sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really die, 
M'Gninness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
lie felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on hi s 
ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what, wound old Regan's party up.

By my brogue you can tell I'm a 
true son of Erin, 
By my dress you can see l'm a 
true sou ef Mars; 
Tho' for fighting and blood-shed I'm not much careing, 
I'll show no white feather if sent to the wars. 
But I'll fight with comrades protecting the banner, 
Beloved by all subjects that's loyal and true; 
'Tis the pride of the world always waving supremely, 
It will ne'er be disgraced by Fitzpatrick MacKew. 
CHORUS. 
Then bring in the punch and replenish your glasses, 
And drink to our soldiers and jolly jack tars, 
Here's a 
health to old Ireland and all her fair lasses, 
Long life to each boy in the Irish Huzzars. 
I 
remember the ranks when I 
was a 
wee fellow, 
My father, drum major, was just six feet high, 
My mother. God bless her, I 
often would tell her, 
When a 
man I 
would fight to win honor or die, 
Since then to the country I've seen a 
great service, 
I've smiled at all danger ne'er wincing at scars, 
When bullets were flying, where the fray was 
the thickest, 
The foremost of all were the Irish huzzars. 
Chorus. 
To the bugle's shrill notes I've obeyed like a 
soldier, 
When hungers sharp thorns in my bosom were deep; 
When darkness our forms has shielded from danger, 
The roar of the cannon has lulled me to sleep. 
At the close of the fight with the moon as our guardian, 
When peace was proclaimed ' neath the bright 
shining stars; 
Our commanders stern voices were heard 1Gudly calling 
God bless you, my bold gallant Irish Huzz,irs.

My father and mother so cheerful and gay, 
As happy as any young pair, 
Would join in the pleasure's and laugh at the fun, 
As they sat in the old family chair. 
CHORUS. 
Good-natured, contented they sit the long day, 
The blessings of old age to share; 
No thoughts of sorrow conies over them now, 
As they sit in the old family chair. 
With a

I 
wander again thro' the fields; 
With a 
step bright and merry the green grasses trod, 
To my loving embraces she yields. 
The linnets clear notes from the trees overhead, 
And the echoing peasantry sing; 
Recall slumbering thoughts that long since have fled, 
As in fancy we join the gay throng.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid.me, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och ! murther ! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, • my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now. 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say--
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I

But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is ply occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And Pm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation.

Oh I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell,

And it's known as fair Erin's green isle; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright , ummer:s morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be- sure, all the while. 
rhey shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and .grent men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin Can shOW, 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connellaud Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian BorogItue, and our bold _ Emmett too, 
tiaw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and rine 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are seeocti to no 
For their beauty i 
really sublime 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock,

You're my idol fair Erin'e Green Iele.

So deeply each hue is engraved in our heart 
Oh I 
Erin, dear Erin, remidst gladness and sorrow, 
For thee have we mingled the smile and the tear. 
When darkest the night, we have known 
that the morrow,

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin,. 
That" Emerald" set in the sea, 
.Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galore, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
CHORES. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Gisitnnuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear it, 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sevea, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world o'e4, 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Chorus.

BE HOME EARLY TO- MIGHT, MY 
DEAR BOY, 
 AMIN= 
SUNG WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY MISS QUEEN BETHERTON. 
AND LEW BAKER. 
I 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things, 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys. 
Chorus.

PAT MAY F 
F031.1811. 
CORRECT EDITION. - 
Lot cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. - 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
ChoruE_ 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as tr ue 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen. 
Chorus.

1HE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND 
HAS SEEN, 
irms MUSIC SENT TO ANY ADDRESS ON RECELPT OF 40ets, 
Now since I 
appear here before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shors, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
nd I'll sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Et 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shako, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone. 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
like the great men that Ireland ha .5 
seei. 
Oho.

little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes We, 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
Cnouus. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
'Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
;When we played on the tRrnpike gate.

P.OW OF TENEMENT HOUSES, 
BUNG BY NILES & EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of cheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger be ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew that day.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS: 
BY CLARABELL. 
MUSICr BY STEPHEN ADAM. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
.aigel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-do, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
.Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A- de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway.

There's O'brien with his high water pants-

They tell toe to go over to England, 
And pay a

And call them the high water pants.

Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a

I'll leave you both, 
My little stock and farm-, 
My horse, my cow, may sheep, my plow, 
My home, my pump. my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden. 
I 
loved this young dearly, 
And. I 
thought that she loved me, 
And every evehing I would go, 
Her lovely faro to see. 
And watch her milli ner father's cow, 
In it I 
saw n harm, 
And lots of tali 
d 
always have, 
Before I'd left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'll own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone.

Shure I'm a high-toned 'ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand, 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS. 
He's well educated and toney, 
His influence is great, 
Shure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Malow. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
But if the boys make fun of me. 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land, 
So if you want an honest friend. 
Then Maloney is the man.

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight. 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found or enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you, 
With a 
warm and welcome hand. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the Stars and Stripes. -.,.;lic.-net.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " schopl let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery streak 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime. may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother— you understand ! 
If ever she's poor and old Incl gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she suie 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's " prayer was heard.

THE TRAMP. 
RECITED BY FRANK LEM. 
!Aflame sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoo, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good. 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothes. 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far. 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my 
feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I

One night I 
was invited, 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
I 
dressed myself up in ray best, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd; 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'cl; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade--
4)1d Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
Fe waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave: 
it would make you die when to waltz be '
Tied 
The night of the masquerade.

Since Willie's left us it's so lonely, 
No more his cheery voice we hear; 
He was my darling, yes, mine only, 
For, oh! he loved his mamma dear. 
His rosy cheeks, his eyes of heavenly blue, 
The smile that round his sweet lips played, 
His curling locks of golden hue, 
But, oh! how quickly all did fade. 
CHORUS. 
Alas! they laid him in the cold, cold grave, 
His little spirit is at rest; 
tine token of remembrance I 
have saved, 
'Tis a 
blossom from our Angel Willis's breast 
While all around my boy were weeping, 
He lay so silent and so cold; 
It seemed that he was only sleeping, 
That soon he'd prattle as of old. 
knew the parting moments were so near, 
His pale cold lips to mine I 
pressed, 
Upon his face I 
dropped a 
tear, 
And plucked this blossom from his breast.

There's a 
little girl that charms, 
The world as well as ine, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true. 
And heart so free, 
Many hours among the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her.

Little one so dear. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, 
11 she's true to me, 
If I'm any of the many, 
Will she constant be. 
None completer, nom, is sweeter, 
In this world of ours, 
?Sallie Horner ' round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
cou'll discover how to love her, 
If you only try, 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye. 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten, 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen, 
As they pass her by. 
lite is very shy and merry, 
In her roguish way, 
I 
adore her more and more, 
In all my love- lit days 
Always sueing. fondly wooing, 
For her heart divine, 
&tine Horner ' round the corner, 
Oh 
she niuet be mine. 
l'APODY ON EMPTY CRADC. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
lie's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grounds 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The tiees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh I 
how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened, 
Cnonue. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
-Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

NEVER QUITE LOST TO GOOD FFLING, 
BY LEW BAKER. 
DEDICATED TO MISS ADA BURNETT. 
While it's true that fine feathers make fine 
loolfing birds, 
A 
tree's known by the fruit that it bears, 
And a 
man should be judged by his actions not words, 
Nor that of the coat that he wears. 
For you'll find in the ranks of this world's brotherhood 
Much that's pure and vicious and bad, 
But never a 
man that is all over good, 
Nor one that is all over bad. 
CHORUS. 
Then speak a 
kind word when a 
good deed you see, 
Fallen man's better nature revealing; 
For no matter Imwever debased be may be. 
He is never quite lost to good feeling. 
While a 
wolf in sheep's clothes shedding crocodile tears, 
Trys to pass himse-t off for a 
saint, 
And the proud Pharisee hurries onward with sneers, 
As the wayfarer looks sick and faint, 
How often we see some despised•Magdelene, 
Doing what good. Samaritans do, 
And relieving the sufferers passed by proud men, 
'Though they spend lifes of shame it is true. 
CHORUS. 
Then speak a 
kind word when a 
good deed you see. 
Fallen women's better nature revealing, 
For no matter how sunk in shame she may be, 
She is not quite lost to good feeling.

THE DYING MINSTREL_ 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACE. 
Copyright 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed oil nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my end sung, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my dance_ 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the saute old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A 
father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
He called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connections' 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinction, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the to 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more case, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
()illy a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh ! how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
_I shall there meet my old friends, 
The minstrel boys ne'er again will pazk,,

Here we are two factory lads, 
From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire. 
CHORUS. 
We 
will make the wooden clogs go tap, tap, tap, 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And 'twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night, 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

Down by a

A

chanced to meet, 
I 
never shall forget her look. 
With dark blue eyes and golden • hair, 
And teeth as white as snow, 
Her heart I 
won in the shining sun, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
CHORUS.

When the birds are singing in the glittering sunshine, 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine,

My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. . (Danoe.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A

When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
We'll ramble to and fro, 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bight stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer d,gy is gently dawning, 
Lifting night a 
be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May 11C1* future life be pure, 
Nay her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secnre, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes.

AS RECI.LED WITH TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, 
BY BABY HART. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LIEDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near, 
The columns are marehing, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. tho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim With provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor doth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigad• 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten ard stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
'Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigado.
