Washington,  D.C.  20506
 
Dear Jane Alexander,
 
When we were introduced during the various  celebrations of
 
the  1993 National Medal of Arts awards,  I told you that  if
 
there was any possible way I could be of assistance to you
 
now or in future  I should be delighted to try.
 
I write today to reaffirm this offer,  also to send along a
 
copy of a talk  I have given in various places  (
this
 
particular version was delivered in Colorado two months ago)
 
Even though you are probably already sinking into the sea of
 
print that engulfs one in Washington,  this is,  I think,  a
 
pleasant and informative read and might possibly provide some
 
interesting perspectives as you think about the folk arts.
 
(You will not,  of course,  be deceived by its personal
 
opening;  most  listeners  seem to be relaxed and intrigued by a
 
little pertinent autobiography)
 
Anyway,  I hope you find it of interest.  I hope also that you
 
really will think of me if something comes along that  I can
 
help with.  It's a very tough and exciting and worthwhile  job
 
you' ve taken on;  you have many friends and admirers  from
 
coast to coast wishing you well,  including
 
Yours very sincerely,

Mrs.  Hillary Clinton
 
White House
 
Washington,  D.C.
 
Dear Mrs.  Clinton:
 
When you and the President presented me with the Medal of
 
Arts that  lovely afternoon on the White House lawn,  you
 
mentioned the beaded necklace I was wearing.  I was given it
 
by its maker,  Balbina Kintaro,  a traditional weaver of
 
Carolinian descent on the  island of Saipan.  I met her some
 
years ago in a Saipan schoolroom helping some of the teen-
agers  learn the modern version of this ancient craft.
 
And at the banquet that evening I wore a pin given me by
 
Dr.Lorraine Sakata,  chair of the Department of
 
Ethnomusicology at the University of Washington.  Her
 
Japanese-American father had made it while interned during
 
World War  II out of a chip of firewood he picked up in the
 
encampment.  He first  forced an old safety pin into its back
 
and then carved it into the shape of a small bird painting it
 
delicately with drops of wall paint he and the other
 
internees  saved carefully for such purposes.  They had only
 
what they found to work with.  Dr.  Sakata gave the pin to me
 
upon my recent retirement,  and I regard it as both a treasure
 
and an honor.
 
I have written both these women that  I took their gifts with
 
me to the White House,  because I felt that my recognition was
 
truly a public validation of the genuine importance of the
 
traditional folk arts,  and I wanted at  least  some of my
 
friends and teachers to be there too if only through their
 
work.  This may seem sentimental but  it  is practical politics
 
too.  In my field public attentions are rare and have to be
 
shared.
 
I thank you and the President again for your warm and
 
intelligent hospitality and your evident interest  in all the
 
arts of all the people.  Maybe some day in return I can direct
 
you and the President to some of the remarkable folk artists
 
right close to the Beltway--just  for one example a 20+ man
 
trombone choir in a local black church that plays  so
 
magnificently I do believe their music could sweep us all
 
right through the Pearly Gates when that time comes.
 
Yours most  sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

"El corrido de la inundacio
'n de la Presa de San
 
Francisquito: The Story of a Local Ballad."
 
I have read the article before, but it is good
 
to have a copy autographed by you.
 
The persistence of the form of the Mexican
 
corrido is illustrated very well in your article.
 
Though Juan Encinas may have never composed another
 
corrido before or after the San MR Francisquito flood,
 
he knew exactly how to structure his corrido. The fox
 
was part of his consciousness.  He shared in what I
 
have called the "corrido tradition."  You have made
 
the point quite well.
 
Thank you for your congratulations and good
 
wishes.

Two friends alerted me to trils  l
etter which eooe red in the boston
 
lobe on 10/27/
9 3
.  
Sam Berman faxed it to me  (
 or rathe' to a grocery
 
store near me -
-
 I have no fax.
') today.
 I
'll be ca11 r
ig you ab ut
 
tel s
, but wanted to get it into the mail right away.
 
Sam tells me that Adeline Naiman used to be Adeline Libell, and th t
 
she was a member of our folk grouo (I do not remember her, which
 
doesn't necessarily mean anything).
 Sam called her yesterday,
 
and she,  "
claiming to have  '
total recall'" said she remember d
 
thet you and I were among the oeoole drinking red wine at her house.
 
On  t1ng that makes me suspicious is that John Clardi didn't heve
 
anything to do with
 our song, so why should it be played GI
 hi s
 
sound truck?
 We wrote  this for '
iall -7
7
.
 T
h't was Ci rdi running for
 
anyway?
 
k
lso,  in view of your r
ecollectien o  dete's song abour th  NY
 
City Councillors on a runaway subway train,  the sur
iDosed sc i-fi
 
writer was not the first or last
 r
n  to think of someone
 
lost on a subway.
 As to making uo a song that she later heard
 
on a saind truck, that s
trikes me as nonsense.
 I remember the
 
meeting we had where we soecifically "assigned" the idea of the
 
man without the nickel.
 I came in with the first version,  in which
 
the hero's name was Angus.
 The group rightly objected to that
 
i
s being chauvinistic, and Charlie was substituted, perhaos when
 
you came in to o
o ilaborate on the final version.
 
Anyhow,  I
 r
 ather resent the headline  "The sc000 on Charlie and
 
th  i
VTA,
 anc wonder whether we should respond,  and, if so, how.
 
Al
 the best,

I' m a little late  in thanking you for  suggesting that  I come
 
down to Washington for the National Heritage Award ceremonies.
 
I' m so glad  I came!
 It was  a tremendously m'
ving experienc
 
The concert was  a smash,  but the opportu?j dty to talk to
 
a few of the folk artists at  the reception and hear them pla
 
informally there,  as well  as  at the party after the concert
 
(where Melvin Wine could easily have played all his colleaqu
 
half his age under the table)  was especially thrilling.
 
Jack Coen told me he plays with friends  every Sunday ni' Hi
 
at  a pub called Dillon's on the Bronx-Yonkers border.  I' ve
 
already spoken to a few friends  about making up a party to
 
go down and hear him some evening.
 
CHarles  Kuralt's tribute to you was  touching,  and obviously
 
deeply  felt.
 It was  the  first glimpse  I got of  the work you
 
have been doing all  these years,  and  I too was moved.
 
I' m enclosing the tape of my new recording,  plus  a copy of
 
the  flyer  I' ve been sending out to various personal  lists.
 
I' m in the process of  sending press releases  locally and  some
 
review copies  to key places.
 
Someone  I know told me she knew someone at NPR  (Tom Vitali),  and
 
she sent a CD and press material  to him,  but  so far no answer.
 
You had  said that you' d be willing to go on the air  for an
 
interview some time,  and that would be great  -
-
 if the  interview
 
ever materializes!
 Since  I am doing all  this myself,  and
 
my business enthusiasm has  its  limits,  I don't know if  it will.
 
My favorite for an  interview on NPR would be  Scott  Simon.
 
Nevertheless,  I am contacting Faith Middleton of Connecticut
 
Public Radio to see  if there  is  interest  there.
 Certainly,  the
 
roar that went up from the audience when John Frohnmayer
 
mentioned  that you had written MTA is  another example of
 
its  popularity.
 Astounding.
 
It was good  to see you,  even on the  fly.
 Congratulations on the
 
fine  things you have done and are doing.
 
All  the best,
 
98  Comstock Hill  Road
 
Norwalk CT 06850

Please thank Pat  Sanders  for  arranging  for my ticket  to  the  concert.
