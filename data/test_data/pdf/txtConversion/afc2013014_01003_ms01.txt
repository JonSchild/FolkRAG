BRENT BJÖRKMAN: Okay, it’s June 24, 2014. This is Brent Björkman, the director of 
the Kentucky Folklife Program, and we’re working on our Ranger Lore project here 
in the Mammoth Cave area. Today we’re in, right outside Cave City, and we are with 
the Lees. Could you introduce yourselves and maybe talk to me about the last 
positions that you had before you retired from, from park service? 
 
DANIEL LEE: I’m Daniel Lee. I was born in Mammoth Cave area, just about two and a 
half miles from the entrance of Mammoth Cave. And what was it you wanted to . . . 
 
BB: And that, that, that sounds like a deep connection that you have to the park.  
 
DL: Right.  
 
BB: So how were you led into this type of work, I guess, is, is . . .  
 
DL: Well, I, I’ve stayed at Mammoth Cave then until I was ten years old. By that time, 
the National Park Service had taken over the park. And I was familiar with the 
rangers then. And at the age of ten, I was, that was on my mind from then on.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
DL: Then, we were moved out of the park in 1936. We moved to Cave City. And we 
lived in Cave City, and I went to high school here, and then to the military service. 
And I got out of the service in 1948, and then I met my wife here.  
 
BB:  Um-hm.  
 
Alice Lee: Well, you met me long before that. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Well, I’ll let you mention that. Yeah.  
 
BB: Uh-huh.  
 
DL: And what else we need to know? 
 
BB: Yeah. So you, you met here, and, and as far as getting into the, the park service 
after the military service is . . . 
 
DL: Right.  
 
BB: Did that help? Did having military service— 
 
DL:  I had— 
 
BB: Do you think that had a, helped to get in? 
 
DL: It did. I got my first appointment as a park guide in 1948 due to my veteran’s 
preference. Not necessarily that, but you had to be a veteran to, to qualify at that 
time. And I, I worked at the, as a park guide for 1948. And then— 
 
BB: Seasonal position? 
 
DL: Sea-, seasonal. That’s right. I’m trying to remember.  
 
AL: What? 
 
BB: And you all were married at that time?  
 
AL: No.  
 
BB: Not married.  
 
DL:  No. We were married the, the, let me see. 
 
AL: November. 
 
DL: November of that same year. And then, we both went to Western at that time. I 
went on the GI Bill, and we lived in the veterans’ village. If you know where the 
veterans’ village was? 
 
BB: Un-uhn.  
 
DL: Well, it was a, they had the barracks and trailers and apartment buildings down 
south of the, of the hill there. And then after a while we were at Western, I applied 
for a seasonal, and I got on seasonal at Shenandoah National Park. And for the next 
three years, in the summers, I worked at, as a seasonal, in Shenandoah National 
Park. [ ].  
 
BB: So what did you do, so, what would you do? So you were in Shenandoah. Did you 
come back here? How did you able, how were you able to sustain yourself during the 
rest of the year if you were a seasonal employee? 
 
AL: The GI Bill.  
 
DL:  GI Bill. 
 
BB: The GI Bill. 
 
AL: It was $90 a month. [Laughter] 
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL: Then we had our first, first child. Oh, let’s see, in June of— 
 
AL: Nineteen-fifty.  
 
DL:  Nineteen-fifty. Yeah.  
 
AL: Then we got a hundred and five a month, after she was born. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
BB: She’s a money-maker.  
 
DL: That’s right. Yeah.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL: Then after I’d been at Shenandoah, let’s see, in 1950-, what was it, ’53? 
 
AL: I don’t know. [Laughs] 
 
DL: I went to work at a parts department at— 
 
AL: Fifty-two.  
 
DL: Fifty-two. That’s right. Because there was no opening, and I didn’t qualify. Well, I 
did qualify, and I didn’t, no opening in the park service. And I worked in the parts 
department in a Ford garage in Cave City. Then there was an opening at [0:05:00] 
Abraham Lincoln Birthplace as an information receptionist. And I did qualify for 
that, so that was my first permanent, National Park Service job, at the Abraham 
Lincoln Birthplace in Hodgenville.  
 
AL: When the test was finally given for rangers after the war, there were over 1500 
men who took it for about 150 jobs. So— 
 
DL: It was pretty difficult to get in. 
 
AL: It was very difficult to get in.  
 
BB: Sure. People were looking for work, and good solid work.  
 
DL:  Oh, yeah.  
 
AL: Well, they just basically wanted to be in the park service, see? You know, and 
there were only a very limited amount of jobs. So, he took the test. I don’t remember 
what they called it.  
 
BB: And that’s a rel-, that’s a relatively small park compared to, to Ma-, and always 
has been.  
 
DL: Oh, it has. Oh, yes.  
 
AL: Yeah.  
 
DL: Well, we were there then nearly three years, and I got transferred to, back to 
Shenandoah National Park permanently as a park ranger. So, it was, Shenandoah 
was my first job as a park ranger. And we were there then— 
 
AL: Five years? 
 
DL: Yeah, five years, I believe, and then at, at Shenandoah National Park. And then 
there was a job opening at Vicks-, at Chickamauga Battlefield in North Georgia. And 
we were transferred from, from a district ranger in Shenandoah, to a park, to chief 
ranger at Chickamauga Battlefield. So we were there then— 
 
AL: Five years.  
 
DL: Nearly five years. And I got a job back in Shenandoah. No.  
 
AL: Blue Ridge.  
 
DL: Blue Ridge. As a district ranger. So we were at Blue Ridge Parkway, then as the 
district ranger for about four years. And then from Blue, Blue Ridge, we went to 
Custer Battlefield National—well, it’s not called Custer Battlefield now, but— 
 
AL: No. [Laughs] 
 
DL: It’s—what is it? Anyway— 
 
AL: Little Bighorn.  
 
DL: Little Bighorn.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL:  Battlefield. And that was my first job as a superintendent at . . .  
 
AL: Um-hm. 
 
BB: Wow.  
 
DL: In Montana. We were there— 
 
AL: Just two years.  
 
DL: Yeah, two and a half years. And they, I got a call from regional office one day, and 
asked me if I would be interested in superintendent at Vicksburg, and, and it, I asked 
them if, when do you need me? 
 
BB: Why, what was your draw to, to Vicksburg? 
 
AL: The Southeast.  
 
DL:  Southeast. Well, it was, it was different than, the weather there was, just, you 
wouldn’t believe in the wintertime. It was— 
 
AL: Forty below.  
 
DL: Yeah. So I told them we couldn’t possibly leave before one o’clock. [Laughter] 
So— 
 
BB: What year was this, would this have been? 
 
DL: This would have been 1970.  
 
AL: Um-hm.  
 
DL: So we moved into Vicksburg in 1970, and then I stayed there for fourteen years 
as a superintendent.  
 
BB: Um-hm. So, tell me about that first ranger position. Is it, how, how is that, I guess 
I’m also interested in the change in working, working in the park system. Was it a, 
you know, I’ve heard stories, for instance, about interpretation at Mammoth Cave, 
and some of the old-timers were more about joking around. And it’s maybe not as, 
maybe, not as historically accurate or something. And, and there was a change over 
time about transmitting different knowledge about that. And I just was wondering, 
you’ve had this long career, both of you in different ways, and we do need to talk to 
you, ma’am. You know, what was, what was a day like when you had that first job in 
Shenandoah? 
 
DL:  Shenandoah? 
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL: Well, I had, that’s the first time I’d had the own, own patrol car. Of course, we 
patrolled the Skyline Drive. And we lived in the park in a park housing. It was a, a 
converted ranger station— 
 
AL: CCC barracks. 
 
DL: From a CCC barracks. A tar paper type. It wasn’t— 
 
BB: That’s where you and your girls lived? Girl. 
 
DL:  Yeah, we had— 
 
AL: We had three by that time.  
 
DL: We had three, three girls by that time. But it was different. But I enjoyed it. I 
don’t know about, about the family [Laughter], but the work was excellent. I just 
enjoyed it.  
 
BB: What did you like about it? Was it just . . . 
 
DL: Well, we had, had a variation of jobs [0:10:00] to do. Mainly we had to run the 
boundary and make sure the boundary in that district was, was marked every five 
years. And that took us through the winter months when you didn’t have many va-, 
visitors. The Skyline Drive ran through Shenandoah National Park from Fort 
Oglethorpe to Waynesboro.  
 
AL: No. Front Royal.  
 
DL: I mean Front Royal to Waynesboro, which was a hundred and five miles. And 
my, my district was the central district from, well, let’s see. Thir-, mile thirty-three to 
about sixty-five. So it was about a little over thirty miles. And we had two, three 
campgrounds in, in my district, and that, of course, kept you pretty busy. And two, 
no, three concession areas, Big Meadows, and the Skyline tourist area, and then— 
 
AL: Otter Creek? 
 
DL: Otter Creek.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: Otter Creek may have been in the north.  
 
BB: Yeah. That was in the north.  
 
AL: He had an interesting experience there, though. He had the President’s son come 
and camp while he was at Big Meadows.  
 
DL:  Big Meadows. Uh-huh. Yeah, he— 
 
BB: The current president? 
 
AL: No.  
 
BB: At the time? No, at the time? 
 
AL: President, President Eisenhower’s son.  
 
DL: Eisenhower’s son.  
 
BB: Eisenhower’s son.  
 
DL:  Uh-huh.  
 
BB: Wow.  
 
DL: And he came to me and asked if, if he could camp there. I really don’t, it wasn’t a 
question of camping. He didn’t want to be known. And so we, we made sure that he 
was free to camp and not be bothered by visitors.  
 
AL: Not even the other rangers knew he, who he was. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
BB: Right.  
 
DL: So that was, it was quite an experience for him.  
 
BB: Right. It was really a question of building your career and climbing the ranks of 
the, the federal, national park system is what brought you there.  
 
DL:  Right.  
 
BB: Right. How did, tell me a little bit about how your job evolved over time. What 
does, what does it mean to be a ranger, and then to be a, a, a chief, and a— 
 
DL: I, I started out as a, you’ve familiar with the GS, right? I started out as a 4, as a 
seasonal. And a 4, GS4, as the information receptionist at Abraham Lincoln, and then 
from there all permanent rangers were 5 to start out with. So I, I went from a, a 5 to 
a, a GS6 as a sub-district ranger. And in fact I hit all of them.  
 
AL: Never missed a grade. [Laughs] 
 
DL: I didn’t miss any. I, from a, then to 7 as a district ranger, and then, an 8 as a, a 
chief ranger at, let’s see, Chickamauga. And then a, then as a 9 as a district ranger 
back on the Blue Ridge Parkway. And then a 10 at, let’s see, well, in Montana, 
anyway.  
 
BB: Um-hm. Yeah.  
 
DL:  So it, it, it was— 
 
AL: What did you do that was different? 
 
DL: Well, of course the, the administration from a park ranger to a superintendent 
was considerably different. I preferred the, the, the district ranger over the chief 
ranger because that’s what I was really interested in. The administrative part, I 
always had good, good employees to work with. They helped me out a lot. And 
then— 
 
BB: But what you preferred was to be maybe more, the visitors, is that what you 
mean, or no? 
 
DL: Pardon. 
 
BB: You, you liked, as you got more administrative, you, you liked, you maybe liked 
your day-to-day work less, or— 
 
DL:  Yeah. Well, I was, I was with the visitors until you get to be superintendent, and 
then you don’t have much contact with the visitors personally.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
DL: And I, I preferred it the other way. But that, it worked out real well. It, it, the pay 
was a little better, and so forth.  
 
BB: So Ms. Lee, how did your, how did your life, you know, raising the girls and, and, 
you know, following, and, and, and being part of it, how did your life evolve into, to 
doing some of the work over time that we talked about a little bit. And it, how did 
you start being involved with the park? 
 
AL: Well, if I can go back to how we met? 
 
BB: Sure.  
 
AL: We didn’t meet after he came out, back from the Army. [0:15:00] We met when I 
was twelve, and he was fifteen, out at the wigwams in Cave City. You know where 
the wigwams is? 
 
BB: Sure. I do.  
 
AL:  I was visiting here. My stepfather was from here. And his sister took us to the 
wigwams to get Cokes one afternoon at that little outside place they called the 
trading post. And he served us the Cokes. And that’s how we met. Like I say, I was 
twelve, he was fifteen.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: Little did we know. [Laughs] But then we moved here when I was thirteen, my 
stepdad’s home. And went to high school together. But we never dated until after he 
came back from the service. And he actually dated my best girlfriend, which was 
fine, because I got to know him really well as a friend. And then we, he, he got back 
in 1948, in January, and we were married in November of that year. I was seventeen, 
he was twenty-one. And here we are, sixty-five years later.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: So, that, being the wife of, of a ranger was kind of hard in some ways, because 
you were isolated. At least, we were isolated. It, that’s not true so much anymore. 
But we were very often the only employees who lived within twenty or thirty miles. 
Like at Big Meadows in Shenandoah, you know, there was nobody anywhere near. 
And, and that’s hard when you’re a young wife with three children, as I was then. It 
wasn’t that way, of course, at Abraham Lincoln. We lived in a little cottage right 
across the highway from the park for a while. And that’s where I first taught school, 
at a little town called Buffalo, Kentucky. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Well, you were in that one room school at first.  
 
AL: Well, yes, I was first, called West School. And I, I taught there. They came 
knocking on my door one day, said, “We’ve heard you have a little college.” And I 
said, “Well, yes.” I didn’t have my degree yet. And they said, “Well, we really need a 
teacher out at West School.” There were eighteen students in first through sixth 
grades. And we had the two little girls then. We found a wonderful African-American 
lady to keep them, and cook, and clean. She was just fantastic. And I took the job. 
And I only taught out there a half a year, one semester, and then they moved us into 
Buffalo, all of us, the, the kids and me. And then I was in a room with sixty-three 
children and two teachers that had been the school library.  
 
BB: Hm. 
 
AL: People think they have it bad now, you know. [Laughs] It was awful. But I didn’t 
particularly like teaching after that. I didn’t teach again for eight years, so, but that’s, 
that was how we got into it. Then we moved, as he said, to Shenandoah. And we did 
have one neighbor when we first moved to Shenandoah, the Stoddards. There were 
two of the CCC barracks, the old tarpaper. You could hold a match up to the wall, and 
the wind from outside would blow it out. [Laughs] But it was okay. We, we were in 
the park service, and that’s what we wanted, and, so— 
 
BB: Were there other, how did that park service and the children, how did the, you 
know, having the children, you know, relatively isolated. They went to school and 
had some kids— 
 
AL:  Very isolated.  
 
BB: Did you have other people that were in your situation that had kids, so you, did 
you have a cohort of, of— 
 
AL: Well, we got together as often as we could, you know, for, like, picnics, and 
birthday parties, and things like that, but we really didn’t see each other very much. 
We got to be good friends with the district ranger in the North district, and they had 
a little girl, the same age as our second one, so we got to be good friends with them. 
The main thing, I guess, was the doctor. We had to go to Front Royal to a doctor 
when we lived in Shenandoah, which was over thirty miles. And in the winter, you 
didn’t go on the Skyline Drive. You had to go down into the valley and around. I had 
our third little girl in March of the year that we moved back up there, 1955, and it 
was kind of hairy, knowing I had to get thirty-some miles in the winter, you know, 
with our, but we made it. Everything worked out very well, so, then by the time our 
fourth one was born, we were in, back in Virginia, but not Shenandoah. We were on 
the Blue Ridge Parkway. And it was pretty much the same thing. We had one 
neighbor. This is interesting. Of course, we’re the Lees. They were the Grants.  
 
DL:  Yeah. 
 
AL: And we were forty miles from Appomattox.  
 
DL: Yeah. [Laughs] 
 
AL: So, one day they put a little blurb in the Blue Ridge Parkway newspaper that 
they put out once a month. And it said, “Well, it’s come to bloodshed with the Lees 
and the Grants.” And what it was, he and Wilson had gone to give blood together for 
a blood drive. [0:20:00] 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: There, forty miles from Appomattox, so, but they were wonderful neighbors. 
And there were just the two of us there. Then when we got to Custer, there was a 
little community. We had several— 
 
DL:  Four houses.  
 
AL: Four houses.  
 
BB: With family-, like, families? 
 
AL:  With families, uh-huh. And we were still seventeen miles from town and school. 
I think this was the hardest thing for the girls. Like, when we were on the Blue 
Ridge, we were thirty miles from school. They couldn’t take part in a lot of 
afterschool activities, because they had to ride the bus home, you know, until they 
were able to drive and had a car. But— 
 
BB: I bet it was good to have a mother as a teacher though. I was thinking about that 
too.  
 
DL: Yeah, it was.  
 
AL: Of course, fy mother was a teacher, his mother was a teacher, so it was a natural 
thing for me to—and we have three daughters who are teachers. [Laughs] So, but, 
just one has an MBA, she, the youngest one. But it’s, it’s very interesting.  
 
BB: How did that group of that, those four out at the Custer site, that little group of, 
of four houses, or four families— 
 
AL: Uh-huh.  
 
BB: How, what was, what was the dynamic of that like? How did you, what was your 
day-to-day like?  
 
AL: It varied.  
 
DL:  Yeah.  
 
AL: We, most of the time it was very nice, but at one point, we had a mentally ill wife, 
seriously. And she would put on a, a uniform like Custer in the morning, and come 
out and blow her trumpet. And it was not pleasant when she was there. Eventually 
they were sent someplace else, and he was demoted. But it was, it was a very bad 
situation.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
AL: But other than that, it was a good situation most of the time. We had a seasonal 
ranger who insulted the Indian employees and all Indians totally. And of course, 
that, in Montana, that was the majority, you know. And he had to fire him. And when 
he did, this 220-pound football player picked up his camera, which was on the desk, 
and threw it at him, and fractured his skull. So we’ve had some interesting times. 
[Laughs]. They were filming Little Big Man at Custer Battlefield. I don’t know if you 
knew that or not.  
 
BB: Uh-huh. Dustin Hoffman? 
 
AL: With Dustin Hoffman. They actually filmed it between the, the park battlefields. 
There’s a space that’s not park. And that’s where it was filmed. And they had set up 
this beautiful tipi village down on the Little Big Horn, and had all kinds of things 
going on. And so he had put his telephoto lens on the camera to take pictures of the 
Little Big Man set, and that’s what he hit him with. [Laughs] We’ve, we’ve had some 
interesting experiences.  
 
BB: Yeah. Absolutely.  
 
AL: But I don’t know. We, we wouldn’t do anything else if we had to do it again, you 
know. It’s, it’s what he always wanted and— 
 
BB: Right. 
 
AL: He, he reached his goal.  
 
BB: So you retired in ’90? 
 
AL:  Nineteen-eighty-four.  
 
DL: Eighty— 
 
BB: Eighty-four.  
 
DL: Eighty-four.  
 
AL: [Laughs] He’s been retired thirty years.  
 
DL: Been thirty years now.  
 
BB: Thirty years retired.  
 
AL: Amazing.  
 
BB: But you kept your, one or both of you have kept your fingers in the, the park, 
working either in volunteer capacity— 
 
DL:  Right.  
 
BB: Tell me, tell me a little bit about what ha-, after you have, you’ve spent your life, 
[DL: Laughs] and you came, tell me about the transition back to this, where we are 
right here.  
 
DL: Well, of course it took us, oh, about eleven months to build a house, because it 
was pretty slow going. And once we got moved in here, then life became a little more 
bearable.  
 
BB: Was this in ’84? 
 
DL: Eighty— 
 
AL: Eighty-four, ’85.  
 
DL:  Eight-, eight-, that’s, we moved in ’85. Yeah.  
 
AL: Eighty-five. Um-hm.  
 
DL: So I’ve, of course, our life has been together. I mean, it hasn’t been a whole lot 
different because we, we’ve kept in touch with our park service retiree friends. And 
we don’t see them very often— 
 
AL: No.  
 
DL: But we do correspond.  
 
AL: One thing, this is just kind of a side thing, before we ever had children, he said, 
“If we ever have a family, I want them to see this country.” He said, “You know, you 
can go to Europe, but I want them to see this country.” So, by the time our first 
daughter graduated from high school, we had gotten the first three girls into all the 
forty-eight continental states. So I think that’s pretty special. And then we made the 
other two. We made Hawaii on our fiftieth anniversary. So, but, he’s always been a 
“See America” person. [0:25:00] 
 
BB: Right. You been to Alaska yet? 
 
DL: Um-hm.  
 
AL: Yep.  
 
DL: We have a daughter up there now.  
 
AL: That’s how our daughter got up there. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Daughter, and grandson, and— 
 
AL: Two great-grandchildren.  
 
DL: Yeah. 
 
BB: So you’re, you’ve been vol-, you’ve been volunteering, or you’ve been connect-, 
connected to the park a little bit with some— 
 
AL: Well, we did until, as I said, he got sick.  
 
BB: Yeah. Sure.  
 
AL: And after that.  
 
BB: For a few years after, right? 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: Right. After that, we just, since 2002, we haven’t really done a lot of, of 
volunteering— 
 
DL: Volunteering.  
 
AL: In the park.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
AL: We’ve done other things. I did adult literacy for several years. And we do a lot of 
visiting the nursing homes. We do a lot of church work.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: Our church is very small. [Laughs] We do—when we first got back, he did an 
awful lot of handy work for little old ladies who couldn’t get anybody to fix things 
for them, you know. I mean, we had one that would call him to come change a light 
bulb. It’s just, she’s gone now, but they, she and her sister both lived to be a hundred.  
 
DL: In fact, they’re all gone now.  
 
AL: Yeah, they’re all gone now. That’s the sad part. But we’ve always been busy. 
We’re into genealogy.  
 
BB: Of your own families? 
 
AL: Of our own family. If we could just find his great, great grandfather. Can’t find 
that man. I don’t know. [Laughs] This, this is Thomas Lee’s grandfather. Of course, 
we learned a lot about Thomas Lee as we were doing the volunteer work at the cave. 
We didn’t really know that much about him.  
 
BB: So there were records at the, at the cave in— 
 
AL: Oh, yes. Um-hm. Joy, Joy [ ].  
 
BB: What was his, what was, tell me about him.  
 
AL: You want to tell him? Thomas? 
 
DL: Oh, Thomas? Well, go ahead. You’re, [Laughs] you’re the— 
 
AL: Well, he was a guide.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: At the cave in the 1870s, 1880s.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: And very well known. I mean, he’s written up in Hovey’s books. You’re probably 
familiar with Hovey. He’s written up in several magazine type articles we have 
copies of. And his brother-in-law, not his brother, John L. Lee, was another very 
well-known guide. The two of them kind of worked together. And we, like I said, we 
really didn’t know that much about him until we started doing the vertical files. And 
there was Thomas Lee, Thomas Lee, Thomas Lee. Hm. So, Joy, her office at that point 
was right next door to the room that we were in, which is all gone now. And she was 
listening as we would learn things, you know, and, and we all got so excited. So one 
day, they called us. And Scott Teodorski would like to take us into the cave. They had 
been looking for a Wild Cave Tour, and went to the Giant’s Coffin, and then down 
somewhere from there. I don’t know. It’s not on any path. And they said they would 
like to show us what they found. So we said, “Sure.” So my sister was here from 
Florida, and our youngest daughter and her husband from Mississippi at that point, 
and he took all of us into the cave. Had I known that we were going to have to belly 
crawl as we did, you could not even raise your head. I mean it was scary. I’m scared 
to death of caves. I don’t like caves. But in order to see what they had to show us, we 
went. Then we did moonwalking, where you walk on, you know. It was a little bit of 
everything. Finally got to this place. Now, mind you, there are no lights except 
what’s on your helmet, the little carbide lights. We get into this space and it is so 
funny. All the way, Thomas had drawn arrows. He draws arrows. And to, I guess to 
find his way back out, you know, he would, he would draw the arrows going in. And 
when we got in, it’s a box canyon. So he turned this way, and then he came back and 
X’d out the arrows. And then he turned this way, and he came back and X’d out the 
arrows. You can’t get out either way from this box canyon. But in the left side of it, 
about this big, in cursive writing, is Thomas E Lee, October 1879. We have a 
photograph of it right there on the wall. And we just, we were just awestruck. You 
know, I mean, it’s just amazing to think this was his grandfather who he never knew, 
of course, because—  
 
BB: Did you know when you were young that he was a cave guide? Or did you not 
even know that? Did you know he was?  
 
DL: I, I didn’t know it. My dad didn’t mention anything about it. My dad was a, a 
guide at New Entrance, and the sea-, seasonal, but he didn’t mention his father 
hardly at all. I didn’t ask him. [0:30:00] But now, my, my dad was born in what is the 
park too. And Thomas, I’m not sure where he was born, but that, that is the 
grandfather.  
 
AL: Somewhere in Edmondson County.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: We know that.  
 
BB: What year was your dad born? Father born? 
 
DL: Pardon.  
 
BB: What year was your father born?  
 
DL: Eighteen-ninety-two.  
 
BB: Um-hm. 
 
AL: Yeah. 
 
BB: Wow. So you have some deep roots here in the caves.  
 
DL: Yeah. There were. Uh-huh.  
 
AL: Yes, he does. I’d like to show you— 
 
DL: It goes way back.  
 
AL: Show you some of the photos if we have time.  
 
BB: We’ll have to, we’ll have to definitely do that. What were some of your favorite 
parts about your, your service and, and working, you know. Did you have some 
mentors that you wanted to, some mentors or, or people that, that you were helpful 
to yourself? 
 
DL: Well, I, I’ve done, I just, I’ve enjoyed every place I’ve been. I really have.  
 
AL: Joe Calisa was one of the first men that he knew. You’re going to talk to his 
daughter, Mary Jo.  
 
DL: Yeah. 
 
BB: Tell me about Joe Calisa.  
 
DL:  Now, Joe was in the CCCs at Mammoth Cave back before the war, and then once 
the war started, then he went into the, of course, he went into service, but came back 
and he was a park ranger at Mammoth Cave later on. And he transferred to 
Shenandoah and, let’s see— 
 
AL: Cumberland Gap? 
 
DL: Yeah, Cumberland Gap and Great Smokies, and then he came back to Mammoth 
Cave. And he retired— 
 
AL: As superintendent. 
 
DL: As superintendent at Mammoth Cave. Now, that’s a, a, Calisa’s father.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: Mary Jo’s.  
 
DL: Mary Jo.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
DL: So— 
 
AL: But he, he sort of looked up to him. Of course, Joe was already in the CCCs when 
he was just a little boy.  
 
DL: Yeah, and Joe was a permanent ranger when I was a seasonal guide there, so I— 
 
BB: So he was always a little— 
 
DL: Oh, yeah.  
 
AL: Oh, yeah.  
 
DL: He was several years older than myself.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL: But I’ve just, I’ve enjoyed every place we’ve been. I’ve, I’ve liked some places a 
little better, but I can’t, I can’t say that I disliked any, any place we were.  
 
BB: What was your year, how many total years were you in the service, in the park 
service? How many years?  
 
DL: Thirty-one.  
 
BB: Okay. How did you know it was time to retire? 
 
DL: Well, that’s a good question. I guess she wanted to retire. I [Laughter]— 
 
AL: I didn’t want to retire.  
 
DL: I— 
 
AL: They were going to get a computer.  
 
DL: Yeah, well, we, com-, computers weren’t out yet, a least Vicksburg didn’t have a 
computer. And shortly after, they got computers, and I, I was gone by then.  
 
AL: Actually, it was partly his health. His, his blood pressure just went sky high the 
last few months and—  
 
DL: Well— 
 
AL: Once he retired, it came back down.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: So it was, it was stressful. We’ll put it that way.  
 
BB: Smart idea. Um-hm.  
 
DL: At times.  
 
AL: Yeah.  
 
BB: Well, you know, the Ken Burns film recently, America’s Greatest Idea. What do 
you think about that, that, that, I think that, I think—who actually coined that 
phrase? Stegner, I think.  
 
AL: Or Thoreau.   
 
DL: I’m not, I don’t know.  
 
BB: Thoreau? America’s greatest idea. What do you think about that as far as the, the 
park, the national park system? 
 
DL: Well I guess it’s a, well, it’s okay.  
 
AL: I think it’s wonderful that they’ve been held so that the average person can 
enjoy them, not just the wealthy. I, I think that’s the main thing about the parks.  
 
BB: Yeah, I was going to ask, what do you, what’s, what do you, what’s your hope for, 
I mean, it’s about visitors and education and all these kinds of things. What’s it you 
hope? Has your thought about what visitors take away from it, did that change over 
time? Or, you know, what— 
 
DL: Not really. I, I think that that’s what I enjoyed about it, being in the park service, 
the average person can really enjoy it. And we only just assist them in their 
enjoyment, hopefully. There were, of course, rules and regulations that we had to 
make sure that they abide by, but that was not a big problem back then. Now, I don’t 
know how they do it. All the time that I was a ranger, I never carried a gun. But now, 
you just, [0:35:00] all the rangers have guns and I, I wouldn’t know how to act, 
probably.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: It’s totally different, I think, now. But one example, my sister was here last 
month from Georgia. And she brought her granddaughter who was eleven years old. 
And they, we went out with them. And they went through the cave. We just stayed 
on top. And they were just blown away, you know. They just, oh, they loved it. They 
can’t wait to come back again. And I think that’s never changed. That’s always been 
the way it is. People enjoy the parks so much, just whatever the experience: the 
mountains, or the beach, or the cave, or whatever.  
 
BB: Um-hm. Was it a top-down kind of thing as far as, you know, you working your 
way into that system and, I guess I was, wanted to ask you if you saw something that 
should be changed or it would make a, a system better, did you, did the overseers in 
Washington or parks, did they, did they listen to you? Did you have some input into 
that? 
 
DL: Well, as far as the individual was concerned, if we had something, there was a 
way to go do it properly and you, you could sug-, put in suggestions, and most of the 
time you got a, well, I guess all, all the time, you got an answer back from what, what 
it was. I, I think it’s well done. I, I have no complaints about it.  
 
BB: So you were able to make changes if you saw them, or suggest changes.  
 
DL: Right. Um-hm. Um-hm.  
 
BB: Yeah. It’s a big system, so I was wondering that.  
 
DL: It is.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
DL: It really is. Yeah. It’s so much bigger now than what it was when we retired.  
 
AL: Oh, yeah.  
 
DL: They’ve, they’ve increased it considerably, which is good.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
AL: When we were in Vicksburg, we had the director of the park service as our 
guest. The gunboat Cairo, I don’t know if you’re familiar with that or not? 
 
BB: Uh-uhn.  
 
AL: It’s a gunboat that was sunk in the Civil War and was under the Mississippi, well 
the Yazoo mud.  
 
DL: Yazoo River.  
 
AL: For a hundred years, and then brought up. And— 
 
DL: It’s on display now.  
 
AL: And he was responsible. He was there during all the time that they were getting 
it restored and on a concrete foundation under an overhang. And he, that was a 
really, really big job. But there were things like, for instance, scissors. They used 
scissors that they found on the gunboat to cut the ribbon for the, that occasion.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: I mean, there, needles. There, it’s just amazing. They have the whole museum 
there now for the artifacts from the Cairo. And so when they had the dedication, the 
director came, and we had him at our house for lunch, and that was quite an, an 
undertaking. It took everybody in the park to get that done. [Laughs] 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
BB: Yeah. Pulled together as a team [ ].  
 
AL: Yes, oh, yes. Black and white. We found Vicksburg to be the most racially mixed 
place, which absolutely shocked us. You know, I had said to him, I’ll go anywhere 
with you but Mississippi. Don’t ask me to go to Mississippi. And then, as he said, 
when they called him from Mississippi, he said, “Well, we couldn’t possibly leave 
before two o’clock this afternoon.” And we got there and found that it was, it was 
just amazing. The schools were integrated for the first time the year we got there. 
No problems. Our girls were all there. That just, of course, I taught in that system for 
twelve years after I got my degree. And it, it was just the most amazing thing to me, 
after all the terrible things we had heard about Mississippi, it wasn’t that way at all.  
 
DL: Well, the Corps of Engineers— 
 
AL: Yeah, it was Vicksburg.  
 
DL: Supplied, it was the headquarters there, and it, it was a big place.  
 
AL: They probably had more PhDs per square foot— 
 
DL: Oh, yeah.  
 
AL: Than any other place in Mississippi. And that made a big difference, I’m sure. But 
it was, it was just wonderful. And we had black and white employees at our house 
for everything we ever had. We didn’t have, didn’t never segregate, you know. The 
first thing we had was a fish fry. [Laughs] I had no clue how to have a fish fry. So the, 
the maintenance people came in and taught me. And after that, we had a fish fry 
every year. And we always had all the employees, not matter what color, you know. 
And it was, it was just wonderful. It really was.  
 
BB: So you’ve had a good life.  
 
AL: We did.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
AL: It, I was really surprised when I got to Vicksburg and found out it was like that. I, 
I sort of dreaded it. But it, it was wonderful.  
 
BB: How much you’ve grown from that experience.  
 
AL: Oh, goodness, yes. Yes. Absolutely.  
 
BB: Is there anything else you’d like to tell us before we, you’ve had a nice interview 
here. [0:40:00] Anything you wanted to, any last thoughts— 
 
AL: I don’t know.  
 
BB: About your career in the park service? 
 
DL: No.  
 
AL: I think we had a really good life. I mean, it, there were times when it was hard, 
but when we were on top of sh-, of Skyline Drive and I had to try to get the kids to 
the school bus. Well, looky there—that’s amazing. But all in all, I don’t think we’d do 
anything different.  
 
DL: No, I can’t think of anything.  
 
AL: I don’t know of anything.  
 
BB: Thanks. Thank you.  
 
AL: Thank you.
