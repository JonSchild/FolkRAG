tiered according to Act of Congress, in the year 188o, by A. J. FISHER, 
in the Of/ice oi the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D.C. 
Thomas J. Searles, (his real name) versatile comedian and 
specialty artist, was born in Philadelphia, October 15, IS55. 
Dancing seemed to be a 
natural gift to this boy, for when he 
was a 
mere baby, not old enough to walk, his father would 
play the violin, and Tommy's mother would hold him down 
to the floor while he would keep correct time to the music 
with his little feet. 
His parents moved to Wilmington, Del., 
where Tom entered school at the age of five years, and con-
tinued until he arrived at the age of eleven, during which 
time he kept continually practicing and improving in his 
dancing. 
He made his first appearance in public at the Odd 
Fellows' Hall, Wilmington, where he was matched against a 
man old enough to be his father, but notwithstanding this 
Tommy carried off the honors. 
His father hearing of this, 
and being opposed to his son's appearing in public, gave him a 
sound thrashing. 
But this did not quench the boy's thirst for 
"tt 
public honors. 
So after this all the many contests between 
Torn and others (nearly all men) were kept secret from his 
father until Mr. Nolan, the manager of the Nolan Dramatic 
Company, heard of the wonderful talent this boy possessed. 
He determined upon securing the services of the boy as an 
attraction with his company. 
He went to Tommy's father 
for the purpose of engaging him, but received as answer, 
" 
What ! my boy go upon the stage? Ito, sir. 
I 
am trying to 
4 
bring him up for the pulpit." 
But after considerable talk and 
promise of a 
good salary the father's consent was gained. 
Thus Tommy commenced his career in the show business by 
playing child parts in the different plays, and appeadng be-
tween acts either to sing a 
ballad or dance a 
jig, at which he was 
then considered a 
champion. 
His next engagement was with 
Dan Rice's Circus Concert. 
After this he continued traveling 
in summer with different circus concerts, and in winter would 
go to school or run out for a 
mo.nth or so with some traveling 
hall show until he arrived at the age of sixteen, when, guided 
by the advice of his father, Tom secured a 
situation as ap-
prentice to the carriage blacksmith trade with the Robinson 
Brothers, carriage builders of Wilmington, Del., in the spring 
of 1371. 
In a 
few weeks after this he met Frank Beggs, who 
had quite a 
home reputation as an amateur clog dancer; so 
Tom and Frank concluded to join hands and learn the double 
clog and song and dance business. 
They practiced three 
years nearly every evening, appearing once in a 
while at 
a 
benefit and two or three times during this period went 
out on the road with a 
small company during the holidays for 
a 
week, until Tom was free from his trade; they then started 
in the variety business, playing their first engagement at Fox's 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
Soon after this they took Master 
Haney with, them, making the firm of Searles. Beggs and 
Master Haney, who acquired a 
big reputation with their triple 
statue clog and breakneck songs and dances. 
Beggs retired 
from the business in the fall of 1877, when Tom and Haney 
concluded to take Master Bob in with them, which formed the 
team known as the Searles Brothers, Tom, Haney, and Bob. 
Bob soon got tired of the business, and his place was easily 
filled by Master Dad. Master Haney retired from clog (lancing 
in Galveston, Texas, February, 1877. 
So Tom and Dad still 
uphold the firm of the Searles Brothers, and have played in 
nearly all the principal theatres of America, and at the time 
of writing are traveling with Welsh and Sands' New Orleans 
and San Francisco Circus, and Royal English Menagerie. 
Master Dad ( William Gluckin) boy comedian and specialty 
artist, was born in Wilmington, Del., June r, 1862, arid made 
his first appearance upon any stage at the Seventh Street 
Varieties as a 
jig dancer in the spring of 1878. 
He com-
menced a 
course of training as a 
clog dancer under Tom 
Searles, on July 15, same year, and made his first professional 
appearance as one of the Searles Brothers with Skiff and 
Gaylord's Minstrels at Columbia, Pa., on August 14, and 
since then has visited nearly all the principal cities in the 
United States, gaining in each city many friends and admirers. 
TESTIMONALS. 
The Searles Brothers are gentlemen in every sense of the 
word, and rank among the best and most versatile artists. 
To whom it may concern: 
I 
take great pleasure in recommending the Searles Brothers 
as gentlemen and artists of ability; they are without a 
doubt 
the most original and versatile artists I 
have ever seen; their 
statue clog is simply immense, they are the yery creme de la 
creme of the profession. 
Yours Truly, 
HARRY GUYON. 
Want of space prevents us from publishing the many 
recommendations from the best managers, and the hundreds of

Suffice it to say that for compos-
ing and producing they have ne equal.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by Tom SEARLES, and sung with great success by the SEARLES 
BROTHERS. 
Oh here we are, as you can see,

To see us tumble in de hay.

But we'll come back some other day •, 
If you'd be happy evermore 
Sing and dance on de kitchen floor.

The Sheeny Ball. 
Am.—" Hard Back Family." Sung with great success by isIEN Guaxim. 
I 
fell in love with a 
girl last night, 
While at a 
sheeny ball. 
She weighs three hundred and ninety-six, 
And she nearly broke my gall. 
Her father keeps a 
pawnshop, 
In Chatham street, near Broome; 
So help me, God, my sheeney girl 
Was the finest in the room. 
When my Rachel was a-dancing 
She wore a 
golden crown, 
She skipped the floor so lightly 
You could hear a 
house fall down. 
Now she has made me marry her, 
No more I'll live alone, 
I 
must have been blind or out of my mind 
When I 
married Rachel Cohen. 
Soon after we were married then 
I 
had no work to do, 
I 
borrowed a 
dollar of my wife 
And went out peddling glue. 
I 
got arrested without a 
license 
And I 
couldn't pay my fine, 
I 
lay three months in the Ludlow street jail 
A 
singing " Baby Mine." 
My friends they would not bail me, 
'Cause I 
married against their Vin, 
SO 
I 
am going to try and get a 
divorce, 
Of marriage I've got my fill. 
I'll leave that big fat wife of mine, 
On the world she wilt be thrown, 
Oh, I 
must have been blind or out of my mind 
When I 
married Rachel Cohen.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You, 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte, 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue. 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it he ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Sung with great success by Miss Georgie Melnotte, at

Waltz with me, love, with me, 
Thro' the dance of life and glee, 
Thrill our hearts with pure delight, 
Thro' the brilliant happy night. 
Come, let's dance, gaily dance,

Dance of Cupid may it be, 
Come, love, waltz with me. 
CHORUS. 
BEHIND THE SCENES 
As sung by WILL. MORTON, 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really WWI my joy - 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grau4 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look brigh$: 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aistare, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you d 
find. 
LBometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
nut be that as it may, who cause.; ail the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household tee= , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now].its just the sam •J 
in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then i.o matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whaterw we enjoy, there's something to annoy, 
, If we Aould only peep behind the scones.

When courting time with us begins, 
And love is in its prime, 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never find him bashful. 
The wine fills him with life, 
lie don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife? 
lie don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife? 
Cuo:—For Louis Renouf s 
the wine for me, &c. 
3. 
And when old age creeps on the scene, 
Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf fills us with life, 
And makes us young as May. 
Then happy's the Man that is married, 
To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a 
jolly good life, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's led a 
jolly good life. 
Cno: — For Louis Retiours the wine for me, &c.

By ED. HARRIGAN. 
With calm deliberation, 
Without any hesitation, 
I'll give a 
recitation 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder, 
You can observe its splinder, 
'Tis my duty to defind her— 
The Rue de Mulberry. 
Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the pianner, 
In a 
Lazeroner manns 
In the Rue ae Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters, 
And the lager-beer importers 
Iii the Rue de Mulberry. 
You could hear an Irish lecture, 
From the neighbors living next yer, 
In the splendid architecture 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
For pugilistic demonstration, 
Of men from every nation, 
The only real location 
Is the Rue de Mulberry. 
'Tis there the solid voters 
Eat eels and Yarmouth bloaters, 
And wear piccadilly chokers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
The perfume of the dowers, 
In the bucket shops and bowers, 
Waft their fragrance at all hours, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
For vast accumulation 
Of a 
mighty aggregation, 
No other congregation 
Equals Rue de Mulberry. 
On Sundays, then, the ladies, 
Taking out their day days, 
With a 
hundred million babies, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Original song ana dance by CHARLES D IANIONH. 
Sung with great success 
at Tony Pastor's theatre, New York. 
In this song M
. 
CHARLES D IAMOND gives an imitation of PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1820. 
Behold in me an Irishman, 
I 
am a 
wrestler and high kicker, 
I 
licked Joe Goss in a 
hundred rounds, 
You never saw a 
man look sicker. 
I'll walk a 
thousand miles in a 
thousand seconds, 
Play billiards with my toes, 
As I 
pass a 
crowd they yell aloud, 
Wash the terrier with a 
hose! 
CHORUS. 
For they say I 
look like jumping Jack, 
Or the Duke De Bum from France, 
When the bell does ring they pull the string; 
For I 
love to sing and dance. 
My father could dance on a 
bar of soap, 
He had a 
very smart family, 
He could turn a 
double somersault 
In the air when he was eighty-three. 
I 
am known at all the balls and hops, 
Sure I 
am the ladies' pet, 
They say I 
have to carry the hod next winter, 
Or else I'll freeze to death. 
CHORUS. 
They say I 
am too smart to live, 
Call me the man with the torn pants; 
As I 
pass their way I 
hear them say, 
He loves to sing and dance. 
A Motto Song. 
Dedieatt d 
to my Esteemed Friend, CLAUDE DR 
HAVEN. by SAM M ARLIN, One- Legged Song and Dance Artist. 
As motto songs are all the rage, 
I'll sing you one that's new; 
That's, always do to others 
As you'd have them do to you. 
Be upright in your course thr,Jugh life 
On this you may depend; 
Let honor be your beacon star, 
And never shake a 
friend. 
Citoans. 
Then always do the best you can, 
For friendship good and true, 
Let others say just what they may, 
You'll neler find cause to rue; 
Be always ready when you can 
A 
willing aid to lend; 
Remember, that your motto is— 
I'll never shake a 
friend. 
The Eacred bond of friendship should 
Be dear to every man, 
No matter what his color be— 
If black, or white, or tan; 
The man that's willing, in uistross 
His aid to me to lend, 
I'll give my hand to him and say, 
"I'll always stand ytmr friend." 
Then always do, the best, &c. 
Some there are I 
must confess, 
No matter what on d 
Who, prospering, will soon forget 
What they owe to you ; 
But this shall never change my mind, 
My motto I'll defend; 
With honor for my beacon star. 
I'll never shake a 
friend. 
Then always do the best, &e. 
When the sun of bright pro ,perity 
Is dimmed by clouds so drear, 
And cold and - hill adversity 
With all its ills draws near, 
Those you have stood by in distress 
Will then, you may depend, 
Remember what you've done for them, 
And always stand your friend. 
Then always do the best, Ao.

Can't She Dance the Can-Can! 
Sung all over the country with the greatest success by the " Artist 
Comique," H ARRY M ONTAGUR. 
There is a 
charming lady who lives around these parts, 
Who has gained a 
reputation for breaking young men's hearts; 
Her personal attractions have won for her renown, 
And I'm the latest victim of Miss Arabella Brown. 
Her attitude is pensive, and when she walks abroad 
Her style of sweet simplicity has all the fellows floored; 
If you could see her pretty face, you'd say you never saw 
Such simple, child-like innocence in any face before. 
CHORUS. 
But can't she dance the Can-Can 
Upon the strict Q. T.! 
She's the sort of a 
girl to p7ay the deuce 
With a 
man like me. 
Don't she dress in the fashion ! 
And can't she sing and play! 
She's the sort of a 
girl to make you feel 
In a 
happy sort of way. 
(quiet) 
Her little hat upon her head quietly was placed, 
Her gloves have twenty buttons, and her stockings look like 
lace ; 
Her little shoes are number one's, to put her ' tootsies in ; 
Her form—ah, well, it is superb, and she has such lovely skin. 
When she goes out to promenade, all the fellows rush 
To gaze at this dear creature, which makes the poor girl 
blush; 
She is so very bashful when she walks along the street, 
And she never shows her ankles, much less her pretty feet. 
29 
When I 
take her to the theatre I 
sit down by her side, 
Then she's the observed of all observers, and her face she 
tries to hide ; 
She puts her f
..n before her eyes, because she is so shy, 
And tells me all the sporting news she has heard upon the sly. 
She has worked me a 
pair of slippers and lots of pretty things, 
And I 
think she's an angel, born without her wings ; 
Although she's had many an offer, she still remains a 
maid, 
She says she'd like to marry, but she really is afraid. 
When she goes to a 
party, and stands up for a 
dance, 
She is so very bashful and has such a 
modest glance ; 
She waltzes, oh ! so stately, so gracefully and grand, 
And don't her partner often feel the pressure of her band 
To take her down to supper all the young men try, 
But somehow she doesn't see it, whenever I 
am by ; 
She sits down to the table with an air of sweet repose, 
And I 
often feel her tiny foot treading on my toes. 
SPOKEN—I 
can assure you she's a 
splendid girl, and when-
ever I 
go to see her she always shows me, in the back parlor, 
how elegantly she can dance the Can-Can. 
The other day I 
took her out for a 
promenade, when I 
met a 
particular friend 
of mine, who said to me the next day: " Harry, do you know 
who that lady was you were walking with yesterday?" I 
said, " Certainly ; she's a 
very nice girl ; I'm keeping com-
pany with her ; she lives on West Fourteenth street." 
So 
my friend commenced to laugh at me, and said, " Why, 
harry, she's one of the paid dancers up at the Buckingham 
Palace." 
I 
told him I 
didn't believe it. 
He says, " All right ; 
we'll go up there to- night and you'll be satisfied." 
Sure 
enough, when we got up town and on to the ball- room floor 
the 
first 
person 
that 
caught my eye was my beautiful 
Arabella— 
Put can't she dance the Can-Can, & c, 
I 
Would Like to be an Infant. 
Words and music by AL. W . FILSON, and sung with great success 
throughout the country. 
I 
would like to be an infant, a 
darling little cherub, 
Without a 
thing to bother hie, no ups and downs to trod, 
And the ladies, how I 
love them, they would hug me and caress, 
And always when they'd leave me they were sure to leave a 
kiss, 
CHORUS. 
For I 
would like to be an infant, 
What lots of things I 
did; 
How the girls would sometimes lay me down 
When I 
was but a 
kid. 
How the ladies loved to nurse me, they would hold me on 
their knees, 
They would fill my little stomach full of bread and milk and 
cheese ; 
And if they'd go to lay me down, oh, wouldn't I 
make a 
row, 
And then they would press me to their loving hearts, oh I 
wish they'd do it now. 
For I 
would like to be, Szc. 
When I 
was but a 
little babe, and in my cradle lay, 
How the girls would come and tease me, but meant it just in 
play; 
They would call me oh such tender names, till I 
felt well I 
don't know how, 
They would even put me in my bed, but they never do it now. 
For I 
would like to be, &c. 
In dot Little Old Log Cabin. 
Sung with great success by AL. W . 
FasoN. 
I 
am getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
I 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
Old Massa and old Missus they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest; 
Things are changed about the place, the darkies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little dog of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
CHORUS. 
For de chimney's falling down, 
And de roof am caving in, 
And I 
ain't got long around here to remain, 
For de angels dey watch over me, 
When I 
lay me down to sleep, 
In dot little old log cabin in the lane. 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years ago, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banjo, 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh! the only friend that's left me is that little dog of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
For de chimney's, Sze.

It's Really My Uncle Now, " Make No 
Mistake." 
Dedicated to ALP. McDowell, by AL. W . 
FILSON. 
I 
am an unfortunate man, and my troubles 111 tell you 
About the girl I 
married, whom I 
thought was so true; 
But the way she deceived me was dreadfully awful, 
And the scheme that she practiced I'll now show to you: 
Last Wednesday night, when I 
went to my dwelling— 
I 
had been to the club, and got home rather late— 
As I 
entered the door a 
young man stood before me; 
My wife, to explain, says, " Allow me to state 
CHORUS. 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy ; it's only my uncle; 
Don't let this small matter keep you awake ; 
Don't work yourself up to a 
pitch of excitement, 
For it's really my uncle; now, make no mistake." 
She says that her uncle has a 
very large fortune, 
And that when he dies she'll inherit her share ; 
But his being at my house that time in the morning 
Don't look right to me—now, it don't, I 
declare. 
Now, when her dear uncle said : " I 
must be going," 
He kissed her three times ere he went on his way; 
I 
jumped to the door, determined to kill him. 
But my wife soothed my passion, as to me she did say: 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," &c. 
All the next day I
. felt very uneasy; 
I 
did nothing at all but sit down and I 
moped; 
But when I 
got home I 
had good cause for action, 
For my wife and her uncle they both had eloped, 
I 
rushed to my room, I 
was perfectly frantic, 
To see if some trace of her I 
couldn't find; 
But instead of that I 
there found a 
letter, 
And in it were written the following lines: 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," &c.

I 
only had my way, 
In this bright land of ours, '-
There's many things I'd like to do, 
If I 
only had the power--
I'd have no care or grief 
To worry us each day, . 
I'd make all folks contented, 
If I 
only had my way. 
Our laws should be the same 
For the rich man and the poor, 
Our banks and instutions 
Should be solid to the core, 
And as regards our navy, 
To the government I 
would say, 
Don't send any damaged ships to seay 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
If I 
only had my way, 
Eight hours should be a 
fair day's work, 
And bosses they should pay 
Liberal wages to all, 
Now this I 
think you'll say, 
Is the very best thing that I 
could do 
If I 
only had my way. 
Street improvements I 
would make, 
And railroads I'd complete, 
I'd lower the price of coal, 
And everything we eat, 
And to those who had great wealth, 
To them I 
now would say, 
Just you share that with the poor man, 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
If I 
only had my way, 
All you batchelors should be married, 
And that without delay, 
And for all you girls I'd find 
A husband true and kind, 
And I'd marry all the old maids 
To some sharp and gay young sports. 
If I 
only had my way, 
To married folks I'd say, 
Now live in peace and happiness, 
Each year, each month, each day, 
And never let trouble come 
To lead man and wife astray, 
I'd close up all divorce courts 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
Our manager he should call 
For champagne, brandy, wine, cigars, 
Enough to treat you all, 
And the leader of our band, 
A 
jolly good fellow is he, 
We'd all go over to Boston 
Ansi have a 
jolly spree. 
And now I'll say good-night, 
If you like my little rhymes 
Pray let your kind applause 
Upon my efforts shine, 
For the more applause I 
get, 
The more money to me they pay; 
I'd sing you a 
song about four miles long 
If I 
only had my way.

Oh, good evening white folks, one and all, 
We ask your attention for awhile;

We hope you'll like our old plantation style, 
Down on the Mississippi, where we were bred and born. 
CHORUS. 
But now we're gwine away,' 
We ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all. 
How often we'd go up on the deck, 
'Twas then the moon was shining bright; 
We sang dar our good old nigger songs, 
And den we jump and dance with all our might. 
Thi white folks used to laugh, and clap their hands so loud, 
They'd make us sing and dance again, 
Then didn't we feel proud. 
CHORUS. 
But now we're gwine away, 
We ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all.

There's none half so joyful, for we are crazy gone, 
There's music in de kitchen, there's music everywhere, 
Each nigger's full of kissing for dere's honey in de air. 
Tc-night de bands are playing for to-morrow ant de day, 
-We're gwine to be married and throw ourselves away, 
You'll see us all a-marching for we'll be at de head, 
Dere'll be a

And the choir will sweetly sing,

When we four coons are wed. 
Now, you've heard de news, so let you all be dere, 
Your welcome, everyone, no matter who you are,

Wid everybody moving and everyone in time.

All rights reserved. 
Where are the old friends I 
knew long ago ? 
Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I 
wander where once I 
was gay, 
Dreaming of joys that have faded away. 
Back like a 
stranger I 
come from afar, 
Seeking in vain for my welcoming star! 
Bright were my hopes, but I 
feel them depart--
Where are the old friends so dear to my heart ? 
CHORUS. 
Where are the old friends I 
knew long ago? 
Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I 
wander where once I 
was gay, 
Dreaming of joys that have faded away, 
(Repeat chorus.) 
Where are the lov'd ones that wish'd me good-bye? 
Wild are the echoes that give me reply ; 
Strangers have come to the home of my heart, 
Sweet home of childhood again we must part! 
When far away in my silence and pain, 
Hope gave me courage to come back again ; 
Strangers now greet me, oh why did I 
come ! 
Where are the old friends, and where is my home ? 
Where are the old friends, &c. 
Where is the fair one I 
ne'er could forget? 
Her last word at parting is dear to me yet ; 
Vain were my dreams of her dear eyes of blue, 
Vain is the love I 
have brought back so true. 
Sad and forsaken my life now must be, 
No ray of sunshine is beaming for me ; 
Toss'd is my bark on a 
wild darken'd shore, 
Far from the old friends that greet me no more. 
Where are the old friends, &c.

Where the Little Roses Blom. 
OUR FAVORITE SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsyr. Sung by WALSH and KING. 
'Twas an evening in midsummer, 
When the stars did gently peep, 
Reclining in the meadow, 
I 
tried to doze asleep ; 
When a 
vision of surpassing beauty, 
Then passed me by too soon, 
With form so slight and step so light, 
Where the little roses bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Her name she would not tell me, ( Break.) 
'Twas love then that befell me, 
For the sweetest girl I 
knew ; 
Arm in arm we wandered gaily, 
By the light of the silvery moon ,
.; 
She said I'll meet you love again 
Where the little roses bloom. 
(Dance.) 
I 
was there on time next evening 
Ere the stars had shown their light; 
When tripping down the pathway 
She came with footstep slight ; 
Said s) - D 
let us wander 
All Iv °ugh the flowery dell; 
Sai3 t. your wish is dear to me, 
(rt- tales of love let's tell. 
Her name, &e. 
-.V: talked and chatted happy. 
The hours flew nimbly by; 
But when the hour of parting came, 
A 
tear was in her eye; 
I 
said it grieves me sorely, 
My love to part with thee; 
Just then I 
saw her handkerchief 
Marked A-N-N- I- E. 
Her name, & c. 
sung in character by Alyuts MORRIS atTony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
On dusty road, mid city strife, 
No matter where we travel, 
The world's against the poor. old. tramp, 
He's everywhere a , rebel. 
The farmer's wife denies him food, 
His very look speaks danger, 
Take pity on the poor_ old tramp, 
An outcast and a 
stranger, 
CHORUS. 
The house dog's barking at my heels, - 
The watchman springs his rattle ; 
The lockup is my bed and board, 
I 
sleep on straw like cattle. 
My hat is old, my shoes well worn, 
My toes all laughing through them; 
My pant-legs crawling to my knees, 
No patches cart renew them. 
My threadbare coat with buttons gone, 
Its tail has followed after; 
Misfortune claims me as its own, 
I 
hear but jeers and laughter. 
The house dog's barking, & c, 
TRAMP'S LAMENT. 
Continued. 
Once 1 
was young, and plenty filled 
The old red barn and byre; 
My mother's loving face I 
see, 
My brothel', sister, sire. 
My father's manly form was bent, 
- When years ago we parted, 
t My wife and children all are gone, 
Behold me broken-hearted. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
A 
burden on the town I've been, 
When.years ago I 
counted 
My lands and houses by the score, 
With love and cheer surrounded. 
Misfortune came, no hand to help, 
I 
beg, I -cannot borrow, 
The poor-
house soon will be my lot, 
I 
care not for the morrow. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
Kind friends, within your happy homes 
Where want ne'er casts a 
shadow, 
Take pity on the friendless tramp, 
Deal gently with his sorrow ; 
Deny him not a 
crust of bread, 
That saving cup of water, 
Nor lose reward in store for -those 
Who hope fir joy hereafter. 
The house dog's barking, &c.

The Wonderful Star. 
written by Cummts JERomz, and sung with great success in the origin) 
musical sketch, " Comedy." 
I 
am an actor, you se; and you will agree 
That I 
am a 
wonderful star ; 
My appearance is fine, they say I'm divine, 
And I'm sought after near and far. 
The managers say that I'll have my day, 
They can't tell how far off it may be; 
They know very well, but they don't like to tell, 
I'm the finest they ever did see. 
CHOR.US. 
So don't you forget that I'll show them yet 
That I 
am away above par; 
And I'm sure you will say, on some future day, 
That I 
am a " wonderful star." 
I've got letters here from managers " queer " 
That have heard of my talent before ; 
In their letters they say at night I'm to play, 
And take checks at the gallery door. 
And some want to know if I'll join a 
show 
Where my salary is paid in advance; 
To the " props " must attend, and sit on the " end," 
And also do a 
good song and dance. 
So don't you forget, &c. 
But I 
do not fear, the day will be here 
When my name they will often repeat; 
And I'll show them all that l've got the " gall," 
Count Joannes will take a 
back seat. 
Dr. Landis, old boy, will no more annoy, 
For he'll have to pack up and go West; 
And then you will see that out of the three 
The " wonderful star " is the best. 
So don't you forget, & c.

The Way We March. 
Original words and music by JoHN E. MURPHY, and sung by M' 
PRY 
and M ACK. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention ; 
The subject of our song ' tis one 
To you all now we'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we'll march away ; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St, Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended. 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout ; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, & c. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan ; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're telling. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
The bands will play, &e. 
The Wild Irish Rovers. 
Original, by Mutteriv and ). 1A.cir. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long ; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you're 
wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing. just stand out of that ; 
We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in.

"or we're the boys the shillelah to whack. ( Break.) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone ; 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train ; 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, &c.

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to rne; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day.

There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer.

Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride. (

Lively Micks from Keokuk, Iowa. 
Written by Huctt FAY. 
Here we are, two lively Mick- s, 
Sing and dance and full of tricks, 
We carry the mortar and the bricks, 
No matter where we go. 
A-working down upon the levee, 
Where the work is light and heavy. 
Listening to the niggers sing 
And play the old banjo. 
It amuses us to see a 
nigger 
Try to cut a 
handsome figger. 
When he says he is the Pompey . 
Just from Arkansaw. 
Some of them are very brash, 
When they're out upon the mash, 
It's funny to John and James McGuffin, 
From Keokuk, Iowa. 
Every day, when our work is done 
Then's the time we have our fun, 
We take a 
trip around the town. 
And get full of lager beer. 
Now, if with us you want to go, 
We'll take you to sweet Sligo. 
We're known as politicians 
In that part of the world. 
We're courting a 
gal, and she's a 
daisy, 
Upon my soul, she's fat and lazy, 
If we don't marry her, she'll go crazy, 
Her name is Mary Ann. 
I'd sigh for her, I'd cry for her, 
Upon my soul I'd die for her.

It was there we worked all day 
In the cotton fields so gay, 
Till old massa went and set us darkies free. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the high times on the old plantation 
We will not forget where'er we go, 
As our hearts are feeling light, 
We have come out here to night, 
purpose for to let you white folks know. 
When our work was o'er at night 
And the moon was shining bright, 
We'd sit beneath the porch above the door, 
With the bones and tambourine; 
Then we darkies could be seen, 
hile we'd break it down upon the kitchen floor.

Dedicated to HARRY IntNnu, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! (Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers ; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not I" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a

And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower.

Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower

Her pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt me with their brilliant dreamy shino.

courtitur Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 0. way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
inent. As a 
re.sult of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which miot t 
have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the difil. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
Tte sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted h•-• 
the parties to the game as their own,

accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age.

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HITMPTY DumPTv,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
