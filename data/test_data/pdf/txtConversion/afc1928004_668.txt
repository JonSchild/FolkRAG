At the peaceful close of day; 
And a 
veil of pearly dew drops, 
On the sleeping blossoms lay. 
Little Mamie's eyes were closing, 
And her sweet and patient smiles, 
Seems to tell us of the angels, 
Who were watching all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Listen how the birds are chirping, 
Calling for our Mamie dear; 
Do they know that she has left us, 
All alone, to shed our tears. 
Now her laugh no more is ringing. 
In our lone and quiet room; 
And the robins miss her foot-falls, 
In the orchard bright with bloom. 
I 
can hear their voices calling, 
As amongst.the clouds they rove, 
For our little 3Iamie darling, 
Who has passed the heavenly door.

In my lonely room I'm sitting, 
Thinking sadly of the past; 
When I 
was young and wayward, 
Reckless of time fleeting past. 
With wine and dice, and careless words, 
No warning I 
espied; 
'Till a 
sad event made me repent, 
'Twas when my mother died. 
It was then a 
change came o'er me, 
From my eyes the tears did flow; 
I 
raved with mental anguish, 
Sharp for e'en soul to know. 
'Twas then I 
knew I 
lost a 
friend, 
And thought of all I've said, 
That occasioned grief or angered her, 
Who lay there cold and dead. 
In ray darkest days of sickness, 
When I'd rave and toss in bed; 
How she so true and faithful, 
Sat and nursed my aching head, 
Before my mental vision, and 
With reverential dread, 
I 
beheld those scenes of by gone days, 
When she lay cold and dead. 
Then I 
thought of her soft pleadings, 
Though in fond endearing tone, 
I'd heed them not; but turning, 
Spurn the true love that she'd shown. 
?hen sitting down in sorrow, 
On her hand she'd rest her head, 
And while sighing, say; " My darling, you'll 
Repent when I 
am dead."

ORIGINAL CONUNDRUM SONG. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY SAM WESTON. 
'The song which I'm a-going to sing, 
Is a 
very witty one; 
I 
am going to crack some funny jokes 
And tell some conundrums. 
Why are the police of New York 
Like a 
rainbow in the sky ? 
Because they never do show up 
Until the storm passes by. 
I 
am going to tell a 
riddle now, 
Try and guess it if you can; 
Why are the stars on our American ilag, 
Like the stars in bright heaven ? 
The answer is an easy one, 
But to you it queer may sound; 
There is no power on earth to-day 
To pull our bright stars down. 
Oh! ear-conductors, do beware, 
If there's any here to-night; 
I 
think they ,are the biggest beats, 
Although ,they may be right. 
They sometimes punch you for five cents, 
Yet still they call it fare; 
They're sure to give their boss the slip, 
And still they call it square. 
But now I'm going to ena my song, 
And crack another joke; 
Who was the first man in the world 
That took la 
cab or coach ? 
It 
as General George ,Washington, 
Which you all can plainly.see, 
It was 'bout a 
hunclred years ago 
When he took a 
hack at a 
tree.

They commenced to scratch and bite. 
The ape held tight, would not let go, 
Ths cat did stratch and spit, 
The racoon he played possum, 
Oh ! I 
thought I'd take a 
fit. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I

KATIILEEN. 
SUNG BY JOHNNY REESE. ' 
I'll take you hoffie again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild, 
To where your heart has ever been 
Since first you were my bprinie bride. 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
Cnoaus. 
I'll take you back again, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain, 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
Totthat brislit home beyond the sea, 
AlyiKathleen shall again return, 
And When the old friend welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn; 
Where laugh that little silvery stream, 
Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam, 
Then all your grief will be forgot.

Is the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
Crtoaus. 
Wrapped up in my pocket in a 
yeller almanac, 
Though it's covered all o'er with grease and dirt, 
Were I 
hungry and wanted bread, I 
would not 
give up a 
thread, 
Of the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
How oft-times he's been licked, and how often 
he's been kicked, 
On this little piece of rag I 
love so true; 
And how often for protection to my certain recollection 
It, has served him as a 
shield from mother's shoe. 
And the day I 
now recall while climbing o'er the wall, 
The wall was high and caused him to exert; 
When the threads they gave away and I 
took 
from him that day. 
This tail from my angel brother's shirt.

BILLY GOAT SONG. 
warn.= AND SUNG BY CHAS ountaN, 
Oh? once there lived a 
snoozer, 
And he owned a 
billy goat; 
His skin was tough as leather, 
And shaggy was his coat. 
His head was nickel plated, 
And his teeth were like a 
file; 
He'd catch you on the fly, 
And he'd raise you half a 
mile. 
He bucked a 
Chinaman over a 
fence, 
And broke a 
nigger's back; 
He stopped a 
one horse street car, 
And he bucked it off the treat. 
Be bucked a 
policeman over a 
house, 
That took him for a 
fool; 
Be bit a 
yellow dog in two, 
And paralysed a 
mule. 
Be bucked a 
canal boat over a 
bridge, 
And split a 
one horse dray, 
He bucked an organ grinder 
Clean through a 
load of hay. 
Be bucked a 
brass band up the street, 
And the people held their breath, 
When he backed up to a 
big stone wail. 
And bucked himself to death.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing will. 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes bier 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
Cuouus. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart. 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brall‘ 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
THE, 
TURNPIKE GATE. 
SUNG )3Y REYNOLDS lc WALLING. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard --,s 
recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our Via% 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate: 
And those happy childhood days they'll coma 
again no moan. 
!Then we played on the turnpike gate.

la Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day. 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she hasn't come &spike. 
't he tiuth seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe hr true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS, 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie 
ono* waist 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said yon would meet me, but I've welted long in ve-
In lands 
far away she does rosin ; 
Her promise she will keep — oh I break it not my Jean 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let me long not wait, let me meet thee 
soon, my Jess 
And the Heavens will smile on our love. 
And when life is dead, we will leava- 
this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

JANE. 
WRITTEN BY BEN COLLINS FOR THE SHEER. 
Not many miles from here, 
Where they sell Milwaukee beer, 
Lives a 
maiden who has got me on a 
krill", 
She's the worst you ever saw, 
She has nearly broke my 
jaw, 
And wads me wear my left duke in a 
sling. 
She's a 
female pugilist, 
Howly suffering what a 
fist, 
It will send you where you won't come back again; 
Her nose looks like a 
cork, 
And she's the terror of New York, 
She's my freckled, fat consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Jane, Jane, my Kentucky Jane— pants, 
I 
busted Friday evening at the dance; 
Oh ! they say you have no sense, 
But I 
still think you insane, 
You're my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane. 
She promised she would meet me, 
When the clock struck seventeen, 
At the stock yards a 
mile outside of town; 
Where the pigs feet and pigs ears, 
And the tough old Texas steers, 
Were sold for sirlion steaks ten cents a 
pound. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She is cross-eyed, she is crazy, 
She's hump-backed, she's bow-legged, and she's lame; 
She's always full of blarney, - 
And sh..t's struck on Dennis Carney, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jan A. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Jane, my poor foolish Jane, 
Slug her with your suspenders once again, 
They say your teeth are false. 
From eating Rochelle salts, 
She's my skinny, lanky, Sarah Jane.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood,. 
With vile.compantons an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood,. 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
CHORUS. 
Co for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken. 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy,. 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voie.! has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing. 
Chills the poor wanderer, friendless afar; 
W lie in the darkness, which way is he going? 
Must he repose ' need' the pale evening star! 
pine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking. 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is waiting to wrIcome her boy.

Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor Mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy.

thought I'd make a

So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation.

self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you,

I 
sang in praise of kisses, 
As a 
soft and gentle hint, 
And soon upon my lips, my love 
A greeting did imprist ; 
But while intoxicated 
With its measure deep of bliss, 
Alas! nay mamma witness was, 
Of our delicious kiss. 
"Au explanation I 
demand," 
I 
heard to my dismay, 
And in Huoli trembling accents the% 
I 
ventured this to say.

couldn't help it, ma, 
I 
really couldn't ma; 
He spoke so sweet, and said, 
I 
was his guiding star. 
He showr d 
kisses fast, 
When no one else was nigh. 
I 
couldn't stod his kisses, ma, 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds, 
I've surely had my share, 
From formal kiss of friendship, 
To love's salutation rare ; 
But of them all I'm free to own, 
The sweetest one by far, 
Was the first kiss of love which ope'd 
The eyes of my mamma.

Flom pleasure unto pain. 
Ah! bow I

That" Emerald " set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galore, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore.

I

And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, 
And invited all the young ft lks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put there by a 
pol-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty.

Ali ! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six- day wale-', 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy.

And Murphy and Tim Lang,

Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Gift. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGuinness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the baud, 
When in stepped the famous boxer }like Me0exedty, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party,

Well, ' tie myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all. 
The politicians promised hint work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Alt! six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly go. 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet.

The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn for to stall 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cems a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring 0, ir money home, taste no gin or wine:.

Ildluiness will go back to Lis trade. shure he's a

You soould see him climbtlie ladder as nimble as a

Faith he's the boy can handle the mild three cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, • 
Ah ! the old man he is alway s

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died. 
This day one year ago. 
A tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's sin- tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in sweA compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in tiny ; krIns, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
to God's all- wise decree, 
lie only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe. 
But sending tears will start, 
And longly I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future borne could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
I'd ask to dwell with ongel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my baby died, 
Thie day one year ago.

Not knowing what to do;

With eyes of heavenly blue.

My heart was captivated quite, 
In love with her I 
fell.

I 
asked her bashful, how it was 
That on me she smiled so sweet; 
That afternoon in springtime, 
When we by chance did meet. :

That stole away her sweet young heart, 
But put mine in its place.

There are songs unsung in every heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope, that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded and withered anti dead, 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
! 
sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold. 
And they keep them to love and to cherish, 
Tho' some are sombre, and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears, and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Chorus. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of lov., 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad wild dream, 
Cherished and loved yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kiss'd by &Attu 
Oh I

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the kight stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining. 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer (i
agy is gently dawning, 
Lifting night s 
be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life he pure. 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim Borrow ne'er eemi re, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Bear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes„

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
CLABABELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPELEN AJOUNk. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
'Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning. 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and pasewA, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
'Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
.But the blue 
mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-de, A-do. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and r:tit alway. 
By the blue Alsatiar mountains, 
Came a 
stranger Li the spring, 
And he lingerea by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountain% 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
SUNG BY JOHNNY REESE. 
I 
am waiting in the wild-wood, Es sic dear, 
Beside the stream that murmurs soft and low, 
In the nook we've known since ch-ildhaod, Essie dear 
Where the sunbeams o'er the ripples come and go. 
Overhead the birds are singing in the tree, 
Their joyous carols echo through the dell, 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
Them our happy, happy tales of love we tell.

A 
ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES@ 
SUNG BY NILES & EVANS. AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAIlit3. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there.. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow,. 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair,. 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, -
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses. 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses' 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he 'was giving her taffyi, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew ::hat day..
