Rock the Cradle, Pat. 
WRITTEN AND BUNG BY JOHNNY ROACH WITH GREAT IIIICCEBB. 
Am—Rock the Cradle, John. 
Paddy Burke was a 
man of work, from Limerick town 
he came, 
He married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the 
name of Kane; 
Now Pat and his wife, through six years' strife, were 
never blessed with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is 
what she'd cry: 
CHORUS. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cridle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore 
he'd go and 'list; 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, twould 
drive him out of his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing 
so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing 
that beastly song: (Cnonns.) 
JOHNNY ROACH S NEW VARIETY SONGSTER 
Now Paddy Burke, this man of -work, be hadn't been 
long away, 
Till his wife fed in with a 
big spalpeen who soon led 
her astray ; 
For three years long their love was strong, till one 
.fine summer's day, - 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her 
favorite lay : (enouus.) 
looked round, and soon he found a 
baby 
- hale and strong, 
And turni-g to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
" 
Who has been here since I 
was g.one ?". 
" 
It was Providence. Pat." she said, " done that, he 
was good to me three years long, 
And now you can, with my other man, sing my fa-
Norite song:

Old Humphrey Hodge a 
farmer was, 
His age was fifty-seven, 
A bachelor too, and well to do, 
For he in the world had thriven ; 
And Humphrey Hodge, from dawn till dark, 
Was happy as the day was long, 
For he rose with the sun and he sung with the lark, 
And this wets his fav'rite song : 
Rock the cradle, John, 
Rock the cradle, John, 
An old man married had better be buried, 
Than rocking the cradle alone. 
Now Humphrey Hodge had a 
servant-girl, 
As blooming as the day, 
JOHNNY ROACH'S NEW VARIETY SONOSTEEL 
And she was fair as the lily or pearl, 
And fresh as the flow'rs in May ; 
And her eyes shot forth such lustrous beams, 
That somehow, ere ' twas long, 
Her image wAs ever in Humphrey's dreams, 
In spite of his fay.'rite song: 
Rock the cradle, etc. 
Now Humphrey Hodge, alas and alas! 
Grew tired of siml.le life, 
And ere the harvest moon could pass, 
lie made this maid his wife ; 
And the sun shone bright on his marriage morn, 
And the bells rung out ding-dong, 
And Humphrey felt like a 
man new-born, 
And fa;rly forgot the song: 
Rock the cradle, etc. 
Now Humphrey Hodge and his dear little wife 
Were happy as any pair, 
Until the time that he was blessed 
With a 
buxom son and heir ; 
And he sits and sighs as the baby cries, 
With its lungs so loud and strong, 
Yet he sings, forsooth, and reflects on the truth, 
Contained in his fav'rite song : 
Rock the cradle, etc. 
Now, Humphrey Hodge walks round his farm, 
And his hair is silver gray, 
With his wife before, and the child on his arm, 
The fruits of December and May ; 
And p::ople smile at the silly old man 
Being wed to a 
wife so young, 
And Humphrey thinks, as he wrillts and blinks, 
When his neighbors sing him the song: 
Ruck the cradle etc.

What care I 
if the house comes down? 
Let it come and come again! 
No matter if all night you pound, 
I'll still sing Bourbon on the brain.

For Bourbon Johnny was my name, 
Drinking Bourbon gave me pain; 
Some time ago, when on a 
spree, 
Bourbon had a 
fight with me. 
Some people may talk of their own dear home, 
And say it's the finest ever could be; 
But of all the countries in which I've roamed, 
Give me that dear old isle of the sea. 
Down by the bogs where the shamrock grows, 
Oh-i-ho! 
Oh-i-ho! 
Many a 
time whisky laid me low, 
04-i-ho! 
Oh-i-ho! 
(CHORUS.) 
The Dutchman can sing of his lager beer, 
The Frenchman with his wine may parlez-vous ; 
The swell may call for good champagne, 
But give me Bourbon whisky true. 
That is the stuff to make one bold, 
Oh-i-

Oh-i-

And imagine that half this world is your own,

waiter for the Black Crook, 
Horace Greeley for sale, price two dollars, 
The latest from Europe, John Brougham to let,• 
Use Mrs. Winslow's soothing paper collat:s ; 
Use Batchelor's hair dye for sacks, intsques and shawls, 
The night-blooming cereus for parties and balls, 
Spalding's glue recommended for the latest waterfalls, 
Cut your corns with the New Haven railroad. 
A furnished room to let in the steamer Vermont, 
Ten dollars reward for Dan Bryant, 
Nibto's Garden to- night, a 
prize fight between 
Mayor Hall and O'Baldwin the giant. 
For Savannah direct take a 
hot whisky punch, 
The candidate for Governor only a 
shilling a 
bunch, 
Coughs and colds cured by eating tack hammers. 
Stolen or strayed from State's prison, Sing Sing, 
Two end men eloped with a 
barber ; 
Barnum wants a 
place to take pea- nuts to sell, 
And a 
boy to sweep out atston harbor.

Twenty two tons of coal pickled oysters on hand,

Young men dressed up so gay,

And at billia,rds and faro play ;

'Twas all they brougut away ; 
And this fine young man was a 
Chore de vere 
For the gift store on Broadway. 
I 
turned to go_ home, when a 
nice young girl 
On the corner I 
chanced to meet, 
She says, " Oh, sir, 
vill you be so kind 
As to direct me to Mercer street ?" 
I 
showed her the way, she gave me a 
wink, 
Says, " My name is Matilda May, 
I 
live with my aunt—won't you see me home, 
For fear I 
should lose my way ?" 
But that I 
refused, for I 
know too much 
Of the girls you meet in Broadway. 
'Twas an elderly- looking gentleman 
I 
saw getting out of a 
stage, 
And after him came a 
country gent, 
Who foamed in a 
terrible rage ; 
" 
I've been robbed 1" he cried, the police they came, 
" 
Arrest that man," they did say, 
And this reverend-looking confidence- man 
Was in custody marched away ; 
He was one of the light-fingered buzzing brigade, 
That ride up anti down Broadway. 
It was now getting late, and I 
found myself 
In a 
beer saloon down stairs— 
There was quite a 
promiscuou5 crowd around, 
Waiter-girls and bank cashiers; 
There were•Jenkinses there with their girls, you 
know, 
And their cash and their diamonds gay, 
But forged checks and false accounts won't last, 
And then there's the devil to pay, 
And a 
cell up in Sing Sing there at last, 
For sporting it on Broadway.

Good Evening. 
AS WUNG MY JAMES H. MCGUIRE, THE GREAT COMIC VOCALIST. 
I 
had been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state, 
When I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening ; 
On fancies bent my steps were led, 
As onward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A lovely figure I 
saw ahead, 
Walked past and said, " Good-evening." 
I 
felt a 
disaPFointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once, 
"Good-evening, Miss, good- evening." 
At length she turned her head this way, 
And you can judge of my dismay, 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day, - 
And of cour--a I 
said " Good- evening." 
My disappointment made me queer, 
I 
stepped into an ale- house near, 
Addressed the har-maid thus: " My dear, 
A glass of ale—good- evening." 
With sparkling eyes she an ale soon served, 
What is it makes me so unnerved ? 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor, sir! 
Good-evening. 
his presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door, then heard her say, 
"Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir, then good:evening." 
" 
Pray, pardon, Miss, I 
beg of you, 
I 
quite forgot," (and that was true,) 
The tailor says, " You often do; 
Good-evening, Suuze, good-evening." 
18 
JOHNNY ROACH'S NEW VARIETY SONGSTEi 
I 
felt a 
blush come o'er my face, 
At such a 
crowd and such disgrace, 
They shunted, as I 
left the place, 
" 
Gliod-evening, Snuze, good- evening." 
Policeman Jones, outside the door, 
Increased my misery more and more, 
lie says," I've watched your little game before, 
Get out of my beat—good evening." 
I 
left his beat, it did not suit 
To argue with vie stupid brute, 
Or hear him make me that salute, 
" 
Good evening, Snuze, good-evening." 
Into a lane I 
made a 
dive, 
A fresh street reached more dead than alive, 
And there tgain met Miss Fitty-tive, 
Who simpered out, " Good-evening." 
I 
hired a 
hack myself to save, 
And handsome to him did behave, 
Two fares for one I 
did him give, 
On that unlucky evening. 
When I 
found out what I 
had done, 
I 
turned and found the cab had gone, 
But I'll not forget the driver's tone, 
As he remarked, " Good- evening." 
But strange things happen for the best, 
If you're amused I'll waive the rest, 
Like the hackman you'll enjoy the jest 
At my expense this evening ; 
But luckily he's left me here,

Ant—All Among the flay. 
I'm an Irishman so bold, as you can plainly see, 
Prehaps you don't know who I 
am, well my name 
is Mikey Free; 
In Ireland I 
was eared, where I 
lately came away, 
• 
It was there that I 
was born upon St. Patrick's Day. 
CHORUS. 
Upon St. Patrick's Day, boys, 
Upon St. Patrick's Day ; 
Don't an Irishman enjoy himself, 
Upon St. Patrick's Day. 
Each nation has their day, when pleasure they wish 
to find, 
And every one enjoys themselves just as they feels 
incli ned ; 
The English have their whitsuntide, the Germans 
comes in May, 
The Americans the Fourth of July, why not the Irish 
Patrick's Day ? (Chonus.) 
We meet people in this world, no matter where we 
go, 
That laugh at honest Pat, and slurs at him they 
throw ; 
But if they want a

No truer can be found than those that love St. Pat-

Castles in the Air. 
AS SUNG BY GEORGE MELVILLE, THE POPULAR COMIC VOCALIST. 
This world is but a 
bubble, there's nothing there but 
woe, 
Hardship, toil and trouble, no matter where we go; 
Do what we will, go where we may, we're never free 
from care, 
For, at the best this world is but a 
castle in the air. 
We are tossed upon the sea of life just like a 
little 
boat, 
Where some get cast upon the rocks and never get 
afloat ; 
But still we'll do the best we can, and never let de-

Usurp the place between us and our castles in the air. 
There is a 
name, known o'er the world, to English-
men most dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native 
bard, . Shak ,peare ; 
When first his plays came on the stage they made 
the whole world stare, 
And yet they were composed while building castles 
in the air. 
If you take the words of Shakspeare and study them 
well through, 
You'll find each saying is so wise, each sentiment so 
true, 
They make you feel while reading them as if you 
had been there, 
Yet the immortal Sitakspeare built his castles in the air. 
The Irish had their poet too; they loved him well;

And many a 
patriot heart still cherishes his song; 
lie bade the Irish heart rejoice and never more de-

And for Ireland in the future built bright castles in 
the air. 
And yet there is another name, to Scotehmen dearer 
still, 
And through each true Scottish heart ' twill make the 
blood 10 thrill; 
his name was Hubert Burns ; yet he, too, had his 
care, 
When Inn a 
simple shepherd, building castles in the

His home a lowly plowman's cot, where strife was 
never seen, 
For, happy and contented did he live with his Jean ; 
Down by the banks o' bonny Doon, near to the town 
o' Ayr, 
Nature's poet, Bobby Burns, built castles in the air. 
And yet there is another name, Americans adore, 
A 
stateman when in lime ot' peace, a 
lion when in war, 
Whether storming Bunker Hill, or on the Delaware, 
his genius in tde his soldiers build bright castles in 
the air. 
And in his country's darkest hours he nobly led the

The Hallelujah Band.

I

I'm a 
most exalted member of the Hallelujah Band; 
Our d'Angs are notorious, and here I 
may remark, 
We've, lately held a 
picnic in the grounds of Green- . 
wich Park ; 
It was a 
glorious morning and we made a 
jolly start, 
Like angels going to Dixie in a 
covered carrier's cart, 
So Itrotherly and sisterly, of friends about a 
score, 
And such a 
lot of loving Iambs you never saw before. 
CHORUS. 
Then you may go to Blackpool, Isle of Man or Har-

Southport, or Scarborough, or search through the land, 
But if you want a

saint can only see, 
You 1..ust join a 
jolly party in the Hallelujah Band. 
We reached the Park at two p. m., and wandering 
we went, 
On where to find a 
shady spot that we might pitch 
our tents, 
And soon NV e found a 
quiet spot where we could sit 
unseen, 
To smoke a 
pipe, to sing a 
song, or dance upon the 
green ; 
We introduced the eatables, the bottled ttout,

And drank success to temperance in a

We pledged each other manfully in wines of every

We satisfied the inner man, then cleared the crumbs

We danced and sung, declaring we had spent a

And vowed it was the jolliest day we'd spent in all

Where the blackest of douds are found.

But at present her intention was to stop at home with

And she couldn't think of parting with her dear old

And she travels about the country with a hurdy-

Now Fanny was not handsome, but I thought she 
was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, which made

Mermaids came to me, 
They sung and danced to welcome me, 
Far down in the sea.

A

" 
A furnished room to let 
A party came and took that room 
Whom I

Whose name was Brother Flam,

Cruel Jane JCillirna 
Left her darling Sam ; 
She's gone to be a

In New Jerusalatn—oh, dear me

A blissful Mormonite, 
While Jane Jemima listened to

He told us, oh, such glorious things, 
Did pious Brother Flom, 
That we thought no place could ever equal 
New Jerusalam. (Cuonus.) 
Ile told us how each happy Saint 
Had lots of happy wives ; 
I 
thought they'd fight, but oh, dear, no 
They led sw,7/ happy lives; 
They lived on turtle, duck and green peas, 
Fricaseed fruit and " Clam," 
For the saints they lived like fighting cocks, 
In this New Jerusalam. (Citonus.) 
My wife was always at me, 
To become a 
Mormon Saint; 
Said I, " Don't take me for a 
fool, 
Jemima, ' cause I 
ain't." 
Alas! one night I 
missed her, 
And was told that Brother Flam 
had taken my Jemima off 
To New Jerusalam. 
(thionus.) 
She's gone to be a 
Saintess, 
With that blessed Mormonite, 
And if he's got another wife, 
There's sure to be a 
fight; 
I 
hope she'll get the worst of it, 
And as for brother Flom, 
lie ought .to be shot, with all the lot 
In New Jerusalam. 
CHORUS. 
Goodly, Jane Jemima, 
Grieve no more will Sam, 
I 
don't believe in Mormonites, 
Nor New Jerusalam—no, not me.

Musical Miseries. 
I 
once was very happy 
With the partner of my choice, 
Till in an evil hour 
She discovered she'd a 
voice, 
And foolish friends they flattered her, 
And said if she'd but mind, 
She'd be a 
second nightingale, 
And sing like Jenny Lind. 
Years ago I 
used to think 
That music had a 
charm, 
But now I 
get so much of it, 
It fills my heart with alarm. 
All day she keeps on singing, 
My famly are as bad, 
They've grown so very musical, 
They nearly drive me mad. 
I 
will marry my own love, 
My own love, my own love, 
I 
will marry my own love,

For twice a

Her Musical Soiree; 
My house is filled with foreigners, 
Who squall, and bawl, and strum, 
Until I 
k‘ish that I 
was deaf, 
- 
Or else that they were dumb. 
My daughter, once so dutiful, 
On marriage now is bent, 
With a 
seedy-looking German, 
And she : str.ed for my consent ; 
And when I 
told her plainly 
I'd not hear of such a 
thing, 
She merely giggled in my face, 
And then began to sing : 
I 
will marry my own love, 
My own love, my own love, 
I 
will marry my own love, 
Or know the reason why. 
There's Fred, my son, who never gave 
Me reason to complain, 
Till silly songs and sentiment 
Completely turned his brain ; 
Imagines he's a 
gentleman, 
Though dresses like a 
cad, 
Calls his father Gov'nor, 
And addresses me as Dad. 
About the house from morn till night 
• 
Incessantly he bawls 
Slangy songs and simple strains 
Picked up at music halls ; 
Neglects his work, and fancies 
An heiress he will wed, 
And says he's quite a

And fashionable Fred.

If I

His activity to show,

And whistles, " Not for Joe " ; 
He stays with every org„anman 
That he may chance to meet, 
And follows any German band 
For hours through the street;

If I 
threaten to discharge him, 
As I 
must without a

And ask him who he thinks he is, 
he'll then begin to shout :

And get nothing but a 
din; 
Or if my nerves are shaken, 
And I

Or " Beethoven in C."

Had it not been for a

She might have belonged to me. 
She always wore a

When she near to the footlights came ; 
When she danced on one toe it affected me so,

There was scarcely a

I 
Really Can't Keep Still. 
AS SUNG BY J. H. MCGUIRE, TILE GREAT COMIC VOCALIST. 
In the days of my youthful innocence, 
I've heard my mother say, 
There was nothing could ever keep irte still, 
By night nor yet by day. 
How often they scolded and beat me too, 
And threatened for to kill, 
But the plague came on me day by day, 
And now I 
can't keep still. 
CitoRus—I really can't keep still, 
I 
really can't keep still ; • 
'Tis .a 
fact that whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't keep still. 
While sitting on my bench at school, 
My feet they went tap, tap ; 
When I 
said my task I 
was gig, gig, gig, 
And then I'd get the strap. 
If I 
went to church it was just the same, 
Though sitting in a 
pew; 
My mother would pinch me just because 
I 
took a 
step or two. (Cuouus.) 
As witness once in court I 
went, 
They told me to be still, 
As dancing was against their rules; 
I 
said, of course I 
will. 
But soon I 
commenced a 
lively tune, 
And the jury, judge and all - 
Commenced to jump and clamed about, 
As though it was a 
ball. (Cnonus.) 
To get married I 
went to church one day, 
And very strange to say,
