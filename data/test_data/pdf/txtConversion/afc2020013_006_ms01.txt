Walkthrough of Building First Car and Buying Chassis 
Memory of building first car with dad, ordering specific tubing and bending it, 
where in past before that would have to go to junkyard for materials 
Building cars for first 15 years then became more economical to prebuy them in 
part, like the car chassis 
Importance of tech support / customer support and pool of 
accessories/equipment 
Rules dictating what kind of stuff can be used at what track.  
 
[6:25]

Ransomville, starting with cleaning the car on Monday, and the maintenance that 
goes into the car 
 
 
 
[8:25]   
Track Conditions, Skills, and Challenge in Racing 
Tracks in the 80s tended to be kept heavier and thicker/muddier, while now the 
trend is slicker, with less mud build up on the underside/undercarriage of the car 
Discussion of experience and track time being central to dirt racing 
Financial challenges and expenses racing at regional tracks for local racers like 
him: sponsors tending to be more local small businesses and word of mouth, 
friends, farmers, etc.  
Description of how his team was setup – and his dad owning the car when he 
started – and his crew and people filling in to help here and there.  
 
[12:10]  
Racing Memories 
 
 
Winning championship on points at Ransomville 
Very first race and night racing at Ransomville flipped the car from the flagstand 
to Turn 1, and description of how he wrecked it being ‘young and inexperienced’ 
One of his favorite things with racing being that he has made/makes a lot of 
friends through racing 
Continuing discussion of financial burdens of racing  
 
[16:00]   
Shifting to main focus of interview: Spats Graphics 
Founding Spats Graphics around the same time he started racing (1980s), and 
started out lettering his own cars 
Doing it about 30-35 years, as a side business for helping fund his racing while he 
was racing 
Starting out with hand lettering to now being computerized graphics 
Early on lettered not only race cars but also trucks and anything 
Now scaling it back to just doing vehicle wraps for go karts primarily, not doing 
the helmet painting anymore or other decorative work 
 
[18:00]   
Early Lettering Tools and Technique 
Starting out with special sign paint and using special lettering quills 
Making templates and getting the numbers on and sometimes using an air brush 
Moving over to vinyl lettering in the mids 90s, and now to full printed vehicle 
wraps (i.e. numbers, lettering, logos, etc. all together)  
 
[19:00]   
Graphic Design for Race Cars and Helmets 
Difference in design from when he started: just numbers and sponsors 
Now having full graphics in background, number and sponsors over it 
Cost has gone up as design time has gone up a lot  
Custom painting racing helmets (used to do more but now rarely) 
How requests worked: usually just had a color, and then name or number, rest 
was usually up to him to go wild 
Moving away from the custom jobs for helmets as cost/expense was getting to be 
too much  
[22:00]   
Getting into Lettering and Graphic Design (continued) 
Discussion of why he got into lettering 
Difference between doing regular signs for making money, and designing race 
car graphics and doing lettering on race cars 
Difference between vehicle wraps and graphics now versus early on: used to be 
more minimal, now fluorescent colors and full graphics are popular 
 
[23:20]   
Walkthrough of Lettering Process and Growth of Go Kart Wraps 
Discussion of old process for lettering and design, and previously proofs not 
being as common (as they are now-proofs always sent out)  
Becoming popular for the go kart wraps, now selling not just locally but also out 
of state: estimates 90-95% of customers are out of state 
For locals he’ll install and do all that but doesn’t install for out of state (i.e. if 
sending the vehicle wrap to South Carolina, isn’t driving to South Carolina to 
install it) 
Impact of social media on his vehicle wraps 
 
[25:20]   
Lettering & Go Kart Wraps (continued)  
Impact of wrecks on graphics and lettering 
Workflow of repairing damaged graphics and lettering while racing 
Go kart wraps being faster to install as smaller 
Challenge in coming up with new designs quickly 
Pride in seeing own design out there on other cars 
 
[27:40]  
Graphic Design & Regional Styles 
New York state racing culture’s style, contrasted with the South 
Popularity of fluorescent colors 
Slight shift back to minimalist, simple designs, and muted colors 
 
[29:55]   
Inspiration for Designs & Busy Seasons 
 
 
Discussion of how a design for a car is reached 
Being able to tell different sign artists or graphics folks due to slight differences 
between them 
Busy season being January through April, leading into the racing season 
Summertime season being focused mostly on repair jobs 
 
[31:35]   
Lettering and Wrap Tech & Tools 
Different sizes in lettering quills 
Making templates out of pattern paper and rubbing charcoal 
Shift to computer  
Software (Flexisign) used for vehicle wraps  
Rolling plotter for cutting vinyl lettering 
Importance of vector images instead of bitmap type (jpeg) 
Flexisign as a software more specific to sign making 
Switching over to computer design software (Flexisign) in 1995-96 
Recent shift from plotters to digital printers, as vinyl lettering is being replaced 
by vehicle wraps 
Advantages & disadvantages between digital printer and plotter 
Mixing digital printed wraps and lettering 
 
[37:00]   
Graphic Design Process 
Customers having an exact idea of what they want  
Working off and adapting images to his style 
Shift in opinion and enjoying the cluttered and complex look now 
Challenge of getting writers / design block 
Enjoying different aspects of the hand lettering, vinyl, and vehicle wrap 
processes 
 
[39:15]   
Skills in Graphic Design 
Discussion of important concepts in designing signs, like balancing color and 
how they complement or talk to one another 
Using anchor colors to make other colors ‘pop out’ 
Importance of proportion to race car graphics, and being able to see from a 
distance 
 
[41:10]   
Workflow and Shift to Kart Wraps 
Race car graphic design as a habit – used to getting home from work and getting 
into designing 
Switching from doing race car wraps to focusing specifically on kart wraps as his 
son is racing karts now 
Differences between designing a race car wrap and a kart wrap, not only because 
of size / scale difference, but also proportion and body panel style 
Karts being ‘more flashy’ than race cars, even having holograms/holographic 
imagery now.  
Minor chassis differences between manufacturers, but not too much impact on 
design 
 
[45:30]   
Advice and Closing Thoughts 
Advice for someone looking to get into sign design / race car design 
Shadowing or apprenticing around someone who already does it 
Importance of scaling 
Current technology not changing much beyond digital printing 
Coming up with a graphic from scratch 
Racing culture at Ransomville 
Race car graphics as an extension of him / what’s going on in his head, and neat 
seeing that design on another car / place 
Designs on other cars make you feel like a part of their team, especially since a 
lot of same customers year in / year out
