Begin M17 B (3) CAL SURVEY OF AMERICAN DIALECTS CASSETTE 34 SIDE A The
first excerpt is taken from original tape W 87
SUBJECT A: And that does...
SUBJECT B: That does, yeah. That cuts down on a lot of labor of course it adds a little
more expense to the crop, but the labor is what wer're trying to cut out on. When you've
got, well let's say that you have six or seven acres of fire and ( ), you can't, if you ain't got
the labor on your property, you can't get the labor to pull them suckers off of it.
A: After you've got it cut, how do you get it into the barn?
B: Well, you have trailers, and then this time we had ...
A: Trailers?
B: some, I reckon you call them "trailer scaffolds". In other words a double concern on
wheels. We call those ( ). That's what we usually--the fact is I was, I'd have got caught, I'd
have had some ( ) if I hadn't had them two trailer scaffolds--I loaded it on them and pulled
it into the barn.

A: Oh, so you ( ) in the barn there.
B: Hanging on that scaffold see, when the weather's hot. But, ( ).
A: Well, I guess you'd like it on those.
B: Yeah, yeah I was tickled to death. I mean I figured it was the best what I ever made as
far as tobacco is concerned.
A: Yeah, now you said that it was there in the field a little bit before they take it into the
barn.
C 34 page 2
B: Well, it's better to. But assuming that the weather's right it's better to leave it out, say
three to four days. I'd rather have it three or four days.
A: Why?
B: Well, it yellows on the scaffold, I'd say ( ) tobacco, it's stay there four days, it'll be all
ready for ( ). Don't you say it'd stay there three or four days? I think it--and then again it
don't break up as fast. It houses a lot better. I mean it don't, it keels at the ( ) so it won't
break, you know. Fibers and everything.
A: (inaudible)

B: Oh it's awful. This year is a especially bad year. Had a lot of rain, you know, it's awful
( ), you know. When you first cut, it's a lot of sap in it, you see. And leaving out on that
scaffold does get rid of a, quite a bit of that sap, and it makes it not so brittle, you know.
A: How do they refer to that when it's brittle like that?
B: Well, "breaking up", you know, they'll say, "That tobacco's 'breaking-up' bad this time,
The leaves are falling off of it." And this year is a bad year for that.
A: Do they say "brickery"?
B: Yeah, something like that.
A: How, how's that ...
B: Well, a lot of times-- I'll tell you another thing, because that amount of time, maybe too
much nitrogen, or something like that will cause it to be too brickery like that, too, you
know.
A: Let me get at this barn. Now, tell me about the barn.
C 34 page 3
B: Well, you get to the barn, you've got a, you still ain't through with it when you get it to
the barn, especially when it's fired tobacco.

SUBJECT C: We call that housing tobacco.
A: Housing tobacco.
B: House, that's putting in the barn, in the house, I mean barn, we call it, you know.
A: It's called "housing tobacco", but it's in the barn, not in the house.
B: Yeah, yeah.
B: Ain't you got no fire to ( ).
C: Well, what she's interested in is the way we talk around here about this tobacco.
A: I want the terms that have to do with the industry--like "housing".
B: Well, they do have a little different accent and different neighborhoods, I reckon to say,
or locale. They have different terms of--I know, I came from Tennessee way on up ( ), and
( )
C: ...see who you're wanting to talk to ...
B: I came down here, of course I've been down here quite a while.
A: How long have you been here?

Conversation with white male, Adairville, Kentucky (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2501
B: Sixteen years.
A: And?
B: And I was talking to some of the boys here, and they speak of tobacco coming up off
the hills, you know. I never heard that expression in my life.
C 34 page 4
B: And this boy was telling me they'd have a little "hill" kind of in his tobacco. And I thought
that's what he meant, but that wasn't what he meant.
A: What did he mean?
B: He meant, in other words he said, "Coming in off the hill nice." He made that statement,
you know. And I thought he meant just a little hill. But really he meant the tobacco was
growing up here and it was coming over, you know. Looking good, you know.
C: Well, they used to, is set tobacco on hills. They "hilled" the ground, made a hill, a ridge
down through there, and they called it tobacco growing off the hill good. It's spreading
out...
B: It's spreading out, you know, looking healthy-looking. <gap> What a, actually ...
C: Wait a minute, no, no ...

Conversation with white male, Adairville, Kentucky (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2501
B: I thought he meant those little hills, he was talking about, his ( ). I thought he was
messing with me.
A: But he meant the way it was setting out.
B: Yes.
A: Yeah, that's what I wanted--these different expressions.
B: Well, that, you will find that in different, I noticed of course I hadn't been around too
much, before I was raised-up, I never <gap> heard that kind of remark made in my life.
A: Now, you heard that here, though.
B: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I tell you, <gap> is the first guy I heard say that. I looked, he said,
"What do you think," he said, "that's the way they coming up off of the hill." And I thought
he meant "on this little hill," you know. It was in his patch. I
C 34 page 5
thought he meant it was doing good in that stuff. For thatch.
A: Now, what expressions do they have when they talk about putting it in the barn, for
example. For "curing" <gap> you said? "Kill-down"?
Library of Congress
Conversation with white male, Adairville, Kentucky (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2501
B: Curing, I mean, well, I don't know hardly any.
C: Well, there's no expressions, really. We'd say we're housing tobacco and after a while
we'd say it's getting ready to "fire". I mean it begins to get yellow and ...
B: Strut. That's a ...
A: Strut? Now what about that?
B: Now today is a day, it's an ideal day for it to "strut". You go in your barn and say, after
it gets good and yellow, you know, and you, the way I would, well you really can see, I
mean, it's "strutted-out". It needs some fire. It needs some heat or something. I mean it
needs something done to it.
A: The stems are getting...
B: Real strut-out. They'll get a little thick, you know, fat.
A: The stems get fat.
B: And it'll kind of stand out. In other words you can fan it prove that it's tight. You can't--if
it's doing good it's hanging right straight down --it's soft. You know, pliable.
A: And the air can circulate, can't it?

B: In other words, a lot of moisture gets in there and ...
A: How do you get it up there?
C: Well, we ...
B: It takes about three months.
C: Most of the barns around here, you run about five to eight tiers

deep. It takes three men in the barn, one on the wagon.
A: One on the wagon.
C: The wagon man hands it to the bottom man, and the bottom man hands it to the
second, and the second to the third, and it's the same process all the way up.
B: ... the bottom man's got the hardest job!
C: You haven't been on the bottom tier for a week, ( ).
B: But that guy's got a hard job, he ought to get a dollar more an hour. The guy on the
top ...

A: It's not so hard, is it?
B: Well, he knows, see the top man don't have to handle every stick. See, in other words
he's got to handle about a third.
C: He handles more than just sticks.
B: The bottom man, see he got to handle every stick. I mean he's got to hand it on up, you
know, every one of them. And the top man don't have to handle but maybe a third, you
know.
A: Oh.
B: So one of these guys you've hired is stretched in there now, I guess I would, now, if I
wasn't so damn clumsy, I'd try to get to the top. These guys always stretch to try to get to
that top right fast! It's like ...
A: They climb up there first! What do they call the top tier up there?
C: Well, that's just the top of the barn. I tell you, that's all that it is.
A: Well, then they've got it up there, now it's going to ...
B: Well, of course it's liable to strut a little bit, you know.

When the humidity is high and raining, and you got that sap in that tobacco. And I would
say that using a lot of nitrate and such stuff is, we use, well, we didn't used to use, run into
more of that sap in tobacco. And this year is a really bad year for sap. in tobacco. I mean
they had a lot of rain.
A: How long do they leave it out there?
B: Oh, I'd say, I guess from now till ( ). Why they start taking these things down by, let's
see,...
C: First week in November.
A: When do they start firing-up? Right away?
C: Firing tobacco, well,..
B: We firing now.

B: Why, you'll start your fire slow.
A: What do they make the fire in?
B: It's on the ground.
A: On the ground?
B: With wood.
A: You don't have to ...
B: That's, we was figuring a fire ( ). Now some ( ), you know, a lot of times they use coke,
or they use ...

A: Coke stove?
B: And then a lot of people using charcoal, any more. That's something kind of new, I'd
say, the charcoal. But it is ( ) work right well, that stuff.
A: That's not the same thing as coke, is it?
B: Coke and charcoal, it's different. The reason that they do, charcoal doesn't have to have
a stove to burn it in, you might have ten of those stoves to burn coke. But the charcoal,
you can just lay it on top of ( ).
A: And how do they know then when it's cured?
B: Well, it can, by, the looks of it, you know. ( ). When you put it in, you know, it's green,
kind of yellow, and when it cured-up, why you got it looking, well, you know, cured-up you
can tell.
A: By it's color, or ...
B: It, color. Well, of course you have to use your own judgement about ...
C: I'll tell you what it looks like. Fire and fire it until it gets through and twisted-up.
A: Now, what's that?

C: My wife chews a lot of it.
