ALAN LOMAX
 
ALAN LOMAX was born in 1915 in Austin,  Texas.
 He is a world-
renowned American folklorist.
 He has devoted his life, his boundless
 
energy,  and his immense talent to collecting,  compiling and preserving
 
the folk music of the United States and other parts of the world.
 Like
 
his father,  the noted folklorist John A.  Lomax,  he has always concerned
 
himself not only with the academic areas of his discipline but with
 
making the results of his studies readily available to the general public.
 
In this cause he has pioneered in the preparation of songbooks,  recordings,
 
radio and concert series,  films and television programs,  all of which
 
act to alert the American people to their own frequently overlooked
 
indigenous cultural treasures of cowboy song,  blues,  Cajun music,  square
 
and contra dancing.
 
He was educated at Harvard,  the University of Texas,  and Columbia
 
University.
 When he was only 20,  he served as the Director of the
 
Archives of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress.
 He was
 
Director-Producer for several original folk music series on CBS radio
 
during the 30's and 40's when he presented for the first time before
 
a national audience the then unknown Burl Ives, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly
 
and Woody Guthrie.
 He "discovered"  the early jazz pioneer, Jelly Roll
 
Morton,  playing in a District of Columbia barroom and, by preparing a
 
seminal biography and issuing a ten album oral history of Mr. Morton's
 
recollections of the early jazz era,  helped bring this outstanding
 
composer-performer back into public attention.
 
During the 40's,  50's and 60's,  Lomax made lengthy and extensive
 
recording trips within the United States,  Great Britain and Ireland,
 
Spain,  Italy and the West Indies.
 The massive results of those field
 
trips now form the backbone of the archives of recorded folk music in
 
those areas.
 He has written or co-authored twelve books,  innumerable
 
articles  (including a special article on "Singing"  in the Encyclopedia  
Britannica (
1974 et seq)and has issued over 110 recordings,  including
 
three seminal collections of folk music from the southern United States
 
and the 19 volume Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music.
 
In recent years,  he has turned his attention to film and video, producing
 
such important works as Dance and Human History and Land Where the Blues
  
Began.
 
For the past fifteen years,  Lomax has been a resident scholar
 
at Columbia University as Director of the Cantometrics and Choreometrics
 
Projects,  developing an innovative anthropological approach to the study
 
of music and dance styles around the world.
 He says of his current
 
interests,  "I make my living as a very hardworking scientist.
 I do
 
that because it was important finally to take this huge world  (of
 
recorded music and dance)  and get down to the meat of it so that it can
 
be used for the betterment of our future.. .so that we can keep all the
 
treasures of the past and use them.. .I' m doing it in a scientific way
 
so that I can absolutely refute the ideas of those who say that Oklahoma
 
doesn't matter or that the pygmies might as well be exterminated.
 Each
 
of these people, we have found,  has something -
-
 some unique artistic
 
contribution -
-
 for the human future and the human destiny..."

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOHN HENRY FAULK,  1913-1990
 
People have said a lot of things about John Henry Faulk since his death
 
on April 9 at the age of  76.  These have generally been respectful  things,
 
warm things;  heartfelt statements that evoke his courage and his strength
 
of spirit.  All have cited his  landmark libel suit against Aware Inc.  He
 
had attacked blacklisting during the McCarthy era, and for his troubles
 
got blacklisted himself.  That's when CBS caved in and fired him.  Edward R.
 
Murrow thought  the suit was so important that he took out a mortgage to
 
help pay the initial costs.  You might have read about it  in John Henry's
 
wonderful account,  Fear On Trial, or you might have seen the 1975 movie
 
that  ran,  ironically,  on CBS.
 
When John Henry's eminent attorney,  Louis Nizer, won that suit, he won
 
big-the libel  jury,  you'll remember,  asked the judge if they could award
 
nim more money than Faulk had asked,  and the $3.5 million jugdment was a
 
tecord.  John Henry collected only a fraction of the judgment,  but that
 
victory broke the blacklist,  and signalled the end for the McCarthy Era.
 
Actor Ossie Davis,  said John Henry stood like steel,  comparing him to the
 
N rst steel skyscrapers  that survived earthquakes:  "all around him a sea
 
ot  twisted wreckage and  ruined lives,  but John Henry stood.  Steel stood!"
 
All of  this  is important.  But there is something else that  is as
 
important-wonderfully  important.  John Henry Faulk was a funny man.  He was
 
that  rarest of  things - a man of conviction who was also funny as Hell.  But
 
John Henry neither condescended nor stooped to easy cruelty;  his
 
characters were built with the gentle care of someone with a master's
 
degree in folklore, which he had.  His people made us laugh and laugh
 
because they were true and right,  whether prattling on,  blustering or
 
quietly reminiscing.  Bits of that magic have been preserved for us in the
 
recorded version of his one-man show,  Pear Orchard, Texas, which he taped
 
riaht at the end.
 
What most people who met John Henry Faulk will remember  is how he made
 
them feel-like one of  the most  important people in the world.  No matter
 
how awed you might be  to know this man,  it was he who seemed honored to
 
know you.
 
Yes,  he was a gentleman. But he carried with him the rage that guided
 
him in his lifelong fight against any abridgment of the First Amendment.
 
The pain of having been shunned by colleagues and friends during "the
 
scoundrel time"  stuck with John Henry to the end of his days;  he had no
 
patience with the ideologically weak.  Even in the frailness of his later
 
years,  he showed a fire  that compelled others to find their own strength.
 
So we come together  today for a celebration of the life of John Henry
 
Faulk.  We're gathering less to cry over our loss than to laugh with him
 
one more time.  We hope to gain a little courage from his courage,  to
 
remember his anger as well as his love - and to shake our  fists at the
 
threats  to liberty that  he stood up against,  and which threaten us still.

Dear Bess:
 
21 5 W est 95th Street
 
A pt. 12-E
 
(21 2) U N 5-571 2
 
I loved your letter to Ripley.
 My God,  you're so eloquent,
 
so vivid and such a fine writer
 Here's a contribution of
 
my own to the game---along with a very important article
 
you may have missed.
 
If,  by some chance,
 I fail to get the backing to do Patchwork 
(sent separately)  I do not know if I will have the energy to
 
generate another series.
 The first program--The Land Where
 
the Blues Began--has  just won a big award,  after all the fuss
 
and controversy.
 I hope you will keep that in mind and re-
member that I always delivered and that I have been for 40
 
years without missing a stroke.
 Sometimes there are days when
 
you look at me with the skepticism you should reserve  for
 
your applicants,  you give me spiritual leukemia...
 
You sometimes forget,  that,  where I' m slow in delivering
 
a book,  it's because I' m trying to figure out how to deliver
 
a new model for others to use.
 The present work on dance is
 
just that.
 
Yours as always,

Although accused by h

The Soviet Union has never
 
been a

a

hat s

s

not  used  f

he
 
s
tate should control t

(
low across i
ts f

doctrine has f
allen on some r
e-
ceptive  ears  i
n  UNESCO,
 
particularly
 among
 t
hose
 
developing countries with au-
t
horitarian r

Seeing t

 i
n
 
UNESCO as a
 chance t
o a
ttack
 
a f

ntroduced a

n
 
combating war propaganda,

As a means o
f hobbling a
 
f
ree press, t
he draft declara-
t
ion was n
icely crafted.  I
n

o t
he notion t
hat t

The politics, t
oo, were s
lick.
 
African support was assured
 
by r
eference t
o apartheid. At a
 
special drafting conference i
n
 
1
975, t
he Russians proposed
 
adding a
 denunciation o
f Z

i
sm by equating i
t with r
ac-
i

hereby  gaining  Arab
 
votes. When t

walked out  i

he
 
Soviet draft i

vailed  and  was  f

M'Bow's r

by consensus, he d
id not want
 
h
is  General  Conference  t

low up i

nfor ma-
t

he UNESCO
 
s

M'Bow gradually wooed Afri-
can and t

away f

The a

more
 confidently

Working c
losely with M'Bow
 
was a

moudi, t

t
o

ceived a

moudi,  entitled  "The  New

which proposed t

Mas moudi's  t
ext  d
id  not
 
specify who should do t

r
egulating  and  defining.  I
t
 
see ms c

such t
asks are more congenial

By a

and s

f t

The next s
tep, however, was
 
obvious. I
f UNESCO was "well
 
p
laced" t
o help bring about a
 
new  order,  i
t would  need
 
mechanis ms by which t
o do so.
 
One was t

t

A

he  case
 
f
orcefully  s
o me  years

he wrote, "their concern

The argu ment a

lthough
 
t

spawn t

I
t i
s
, a
t heart, a
 version o
f 
t
he age-old debate over
 
ends and means. I

and

One way, set f

and  t

t
o  a

he

o grow.
 
Another way, set f
orth by
 
t
he West and by some
 
developing countries, i
s t
o
 
concentrate  i
nstead  on
 
building up t
he t
echnical

Regardless o

I

 c

know t
hat h

hose two principles quite c
learly i

I
 don't t
hink we have t
o t
alk much about t
hat.
 
There i
s one more p
roblem t
hat I
 was t
hinking about. What
 
t
o do with t
he s
cholar s
uch a
s Mr. Pehrson, whom Mr. Lomax
 
mentioned. He s
howed h
is p
ictures f
rom t
he Lapps and he s
aid
 
he l
oved t
he Lapps. Well, t
here i
s a
 problem. There i
s Mr. Pehr-
s
on, o
r myself, c
oming among t
he Lapps and we both l
ove t
he
 
Lapps. There i
s s
omething dangerous i
n t
hat i
f we a
re t
o b
e
 
r
eal s
cholars. We have t
o wake up one morning i
n t
he c
ourtyard
 
and s
it i
n t
he h
igh b
ed and l
ook a
round and l
ook quite c
learly,
 
quite c
almly, and quite c
oldly upon what we s
ee. I
t i
s absolutely
 
necessary t
hat we do t
his now and t
hen. But i
n s
o f
ar a
s we
 
a
re human b
eings we c
an never l
eave out our l
ove f
or o
ther
 
people. I
t i
s v
ery e
asy t
o l
ove o
ther people and, o
f c
ourse, we
 
a
ll do t
hat i
n r
eality. Some o
f u
s don't t
hink much about i
t
, but
 
we do.
 
Now t
here i
s a
 t
echnical problem i
n t
his question o
f how t
o
 
d
eal with t
he l
ove I
 f
eel f
or t
he people. I
 have t
o s
tudy t
hem
 
and a
t t
he s
ame t
ime I
 s
hould s
tudy t
hem f
rom quite a
 s
cientific
 
point o
f v
iew. Now I
 t
hink t
hat i
s not s
o v
ery hard i
f one j
ust
 
u
ses t
he method I
 mention, and will l
ook a
round v
ery c
almly
 
and c
oldly —that must b
e done. That i
s t
he c
ritic's point o
f v
iew.
 
There i
s another point t
hat Mr. Lomax t
ook up f
or d
iscussion.
 
He c
alled t
he f
olklorist an advocate o
f t
he p
eople. Now he u
sed
 
another word t
oo; he c
alled a
 f
olklorist an i
nterpreter. Well, I
 
t
hink when I
 f
i
rst s
aw t
he word "advocate" I
 d
idn't l
ike i
t
. When
 
I
 heard "
interpreter," t
hat was s
omething t
hat a
t t
he s
ame t
ime
 
I
 c
ould t
ake. Of c
ourse, when a
 f
olklorist, d
evoted t
o pure s
cien-
t
if
ic work, has t
o t
ake over t
he r
ole o
f being i
nterpreter, t
hen
 
o
f c
ourse he has s
omething t
o do with t
he question o
f values.
 
We must t
hink t
hat what he i
s doing i
s a
 good t
hing t
o do. For
 
t
o be a
 good i
nterpreter i
s t
o build upon a
 quite c
lear s
cientif
ic
 
basis. So I
 would prefer t
o u
se t
he word "

Now you c
