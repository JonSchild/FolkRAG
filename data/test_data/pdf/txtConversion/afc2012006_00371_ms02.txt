Born in Feb 29, 1956 in Houston. Lived there till 2 years of age. Moved to East Houston 
area. to a suburb called El Dorado. Then 17 years later, went to the navy. Have family 
members that worked on the ship channel. Grew up associated with the POrt of Houston. 
Career started in 1972 at 16 years of age. OBservation tower. First job was for Kansas 
packing - food purveyor for ships calling on Houston port. Worked in warehouse and 
filled orders for dried goods etc. Sometimes used to drive the vehicles. Then would drive 
a bobtail truck. Was a really rewarding experience when got to travel to Beaumont etc. 
Got a lot of pleasure out of doing the work. THen after 18 was eligible to work as 
longshoreman. Had to work off social security card. Felt like was in a cattle drive or 
auction. The gang foreman would come and purvey the casualty workers and pick the 
workers to work for them. Had family that was established as longshoremen then. Was 
hired on individual virtue. Worked on social security till received a work number. Did a 
lot of "sacks back then." Sacks of corn or rice, 105 lb bags. Did get coffee in burlap bags. 
Had to find ship details and gang details on a huge blackboard. Had to report to work at 7 
am. Had a one hour lunch break and back to work. As a casualty worker, get some of the 
harder labor work - sack, pipe and steel. Had a lot of drums and cowhide. Tried to avoid 
cowhide jobs, but it pays 75 cents more per hour for cowhide jobs. It was real messy but 
was worth it. had to endure cowhide fluids all over the body and maggots etc. They were 
10-15 lbs bundles. Work as a longshoreman is hard, dangerous, laborious. Back in 1979, 
pay was $17 an hour. If ship was on a tight schedule gang would be called back to work 
at night and that was a pay and a half.

Lot of interesting men and places. Light ship , clipper class type. On it there were baby 
elephant and tortoise on board. They had to be taken off board. Lowered the ship and 
built a ramp to escort the elephants off board. Tortoise were caged and for their safe 
transport, 4 ft diameter across their back. Put them in cargo nets two at a time. 40-43 
south side docks are referred to as the cowhide docks. Had some good football games. 
Lot of camaraderie in the hold of the ship. Did a lot of family things t off time. Continued 
in the same career. Had brothers in the same field. Brother in law worked up the ranks to 
become an ILA president. After a few years wanted some adventure. Decided to 
volunteer for the Navy. Went to boot camp in Florida and then Virginia for four years. 
 
 
Worked on Admiral's barge. Played on the football team. Volunteered to re enlist because 
wanted to see the west coast. Spent two years on USS Roarke. After 7 years stepped 
away from the Navy.

Came back to Longshoreman in 1983. Post Oil embargo in the country. Economy was 
falling apart. ILA merged. ILA had two separate unions. Whites and HIspanics operated 
one union and blacks operated another one. Hiring hall was the same for everyone. With 
unions merging and the failed economy, anyone with low seniority starved. Shipping had 
slowed down tremendously. Containerization had come in big. Many people quit. Started 
out at the hiring hall in the morning, waited to see if anyone would quit the job etc. Then 
waited tables at night at a local steakhouse. Did that for several months. Decided to work 
at a lumberyard close to home. Pregnant wife, needed money. An old friend came along 
to the lumberyard. Charlie had gone to the coastguards. Fireboats on the ship channel. 
Charlie was working on a fireboat. Left immediately to the Manchester fire station. 
Applied for the opening position. Was referred to the marine department manager. Went 
to the Greensboro fire station for interview. Monday morning was given the job. Started 
out the following week. Began career on the fireboat.

working for a big company. First promotion from hose man to engineer. Studied and 
became aware of diesel mechanics operations. Qualified for first captains license. 
Received certificate of completion. Also coastguard federal license for inland operators. 
Was promoted to engineer soon. Became interested in handling ships etc. Worked on

Spent all the off time up and down the ship channel to catch the fleeting service. Could 
ride the outbound but couldn’t stop to get off. So decided to get a john boat. Had to 
depend on Dad to bring the boat so could ride it home. Had to keep up work schedule. 
Got to know some captains on the first name business. Were very supportive of 
intentions. Father used to pick him up whenever needed. Was able to start riding ships 
from a captain who owned clipper type ships. Made a lot of one way trips to Lake 
Charles, Brownsville, Corpus Christie. Did not go further away than the Gulf Coast. Did 
the shorter trips in the immediate gulf coast area. Felt like an Amway salesman. As a 
result of all this, got enough round trips to qualify for pilots license. In 1989, received 
pilots license with unlimited tonnage. Approached Houston pilots for an application to 
become deputy pilot.

Goal was to show experience on Houston ship channel. Faired well and got their 
attention. After 3 months was called for an interview. Unfortunately was not to happen. 5 
years ago, parents had divorced, and mother remarried a man who had a son who worked 
for harbor tugs for G&H. Both competed to become Houston pilots. He had more 
influence and support. Try to get a good mixture of both blue and brown water people. 
Interviewed both stepbrother and him. Houston ship pilots have a nepotism clause in their 
bylaws and as a result will not employ relatives. In 1990 Eric (stepbrother) was accepted 
to the position of Deputy pilot. Received promotions in fire boats. Was promoted as 
captain in 1994. With 24 hr on and 48 hr off schedule, most fireman take on second jobs

Fishing boat for 80 passengers. Wanted to pilot yachts. Harbor master called from 
watergate yacht club from Clearlake. Needed a boat in Galveston to pick up cadets from 
Texas A and M for a dinner cruise. 80 ft wooden hull, 1929 yacht. Made it to Galveston, 
and completed the job. Operated that boat a few times. Helped as a distraction from the 
pilots. Operated five different yachts out of  Clearlake.

Captained a yacht for the man who invented crazy straws. Fall of 1983 G Ray wanted to 
go to Fort Lauderdale. But couldn’t go because of fire boat schedule. Interviewed for Star 
Fleet Marine as vessel manager. After Labor Day in 1993, Star Gazer was launched.
