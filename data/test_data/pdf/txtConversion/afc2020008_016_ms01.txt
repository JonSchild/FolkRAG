Howard Evans interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Wednesday, May 26, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Howard Evans here at the Lehigh 
Cement Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your 
permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Howard Evans:  
Yes, that's correct.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and where 
you were born?  
 
HE: 
It's Howard James Evans. I was born 1959 in the Redding Hospital in Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And that's just around the corner? 
 
HE: 
Yeah, it's close.  
 
VP: 
Is it about an hour drive? 
 
HE: 
Uh, probably quicker, probably 30 to 45 minutes. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
And is that where you grew up?  
 
HE: 
Oh, I grew up in Redding till I was about five. And then we all moved out on the farm 
in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, which is only probably 20 minutes from here because I, it was a 
very big family. So, we moved very fast.  
 
VP: 
How many siblings did you have?  
 
HE: 
Oh, I had us one sister first and then it was my twin brother and I. And then 13 months 
later, there was triplets. And then there's two more singles after that, and then there's four 
halves.   
 
VP: 
So, when did you first learn about cement?  
 
[00:01:59] 
 
HE: 
Uh, well, I knew this was here because I used to go fishing around the back a lot. And 
then I worked at a window manufacturing plant and they closed so then I needed a job because 
I didn't want to go on unemployment. So, I was there on unemployment for a little bit and then 
2 
 
a friend of mine mentioned a cement plant. So, I came for an interview and by the lunchtime, 
the same day they told me that I was hired.  
 
VP: 
What year was that?  
 
HE: 
Uh, 1990. October.  
 
VP: 
Do you remember what the job was and what it paid?  
 
HE: 
Basically, everybody starts at labor and I think it was 7.35 because you got 80 percent 
of the rate. So, it was 7.35 and that was 5 cents cheaper than I was getting from unemployment. 
But I did not want to be on unemployment, so  
 
VP: 
And so, what types of different jobs did you do as part of the labor crew?  
 
[00:03:06] 
 
HE: 
Uh, the labor, the lowest labor got to be janitor. So, I was janitor up in central control. 
So, that's what you did, eight hours a day and then till the next group was hired, then the lowest 
man went. And then from there I went on clinker belts and all that stuff, which is no longer in 
this plant. And then somebody in the pack house needed knee replacements. So, he was going 
to be off for six months. So, then I went and got trained on that. And then pretty much I've been 
in the packhouse ever since for my whole thirty well, thirty years probably over there.  
 
VP: 
So, can you tell me what the packhouse is?  
 
HE: 
Packs bags, as a rotor packer upstairs, it's a ten spout and there’s conveyers that put the 
bags onto the spout each spout and dumps it off at the end and then goes down to a palletizer 
and we do, other companies give us their bags once in a while to run if they're broke down or 
need help. So, we're actually doing some right now, so. But it's, everything has changed a lot. 
Palletizers have been upgraded twice and the conveyor that puts the bags on the spout spin is 
a brand new one. The only thing we don't have is a brand new palletizer, which is pretty old, 
it’s the original.  
 
VP: 
From what year?  
 
HE: 
Oh, they were just putting it in when I started in 1990. The structure was there but all 
the wires and stuff were still laying out in the floor. So, I pretty much got an initiation on how 
all that works and the different things, how to fix it, and we've figured out a couple of things 
to try to make things better and it's probably not even close to the original way it was because 
it just wouldn't run in the beginning, so. But they got it going.  
 
VP: 
So, how many bags do you pack per day?  
 
HE: 
When everything is at full speed, it can pack 40 bags a minute. So, one pallet. We 
barely, barely, rarely can do that because the palletizer just can't keep up. You're basically at 
38, 37, 38 bags a minute because it just, it just can't keep up.  
 
VP: 
And how many workers do you have at the packhouse?  
 
3 
 
HE: 
The packhouse where I’m in, we have a repairman and then it's three regular workers 
and plus a fill in when somebody's on vacation. But he fills in bulk silos and backhouse.  
 
VP: 
And is everyone responsible for a different part of job?  
 
HE: 
Oh, no. We were basically trained on everything. Everybody has to know every job in 
there, except maintenance. But we know how to fix stuff because we see them when they fix 
it. So, sometimes if he's on vacation, we might have to step in. But for the most part, there's 
only that many. There used to be a lot more till they downsized. There used to be probably 
close to seven or eight. But, you know, things change and they downsize, things get more 
automated. So, it's, we only have for now.  
 
VP: 
So, how has automation changed your work?  
 
[00:06:59] 
 
HE: 
Sometimes, you think automation is supposed to make your job easier, but sometimes 
that actually makes it harder because things just are a little bit too complicated. It's just not 
simple. But we just had our the guy from Paver Products for the packer, he did a lot of fixing 
and changing and stuff. And it is, he's he was the best when we had so far and now everything 
is running very well.  
 
VP: 
So, can you give me an example of how automation has complicated the work?  
 
HE: 
Oh, well, sometimes there's, let me think. We have sometimes the palettes are actually 
breaking inside and there's no way to get them out except going in there and hand stacking all 
the pallets, there's no easy way to get them out. But I really don't know if there is would be an 
easy way to get them out except change pallet companies. But we had a lot of problems lately. 
But with a little talking to the company, the pallet company and stuff, it has gotten a lot better. 
That's one thing, because you don't want to be lifting bags, especially the 94 pound bags, and 
you're hunched over and trying to pull them out, especially at my age, but I'll do it if I have to.  
 
VP: 
Have you had some injuries or some kind of back pain? 
 
HE: 
I mean uh I've always had back pain some and my knees are pretty much shot because 
I drive a forklift for the most part, so I've been doing it for 30 years. And all the lifting you're 
doing, it's strenuous. But I am used to it on the farm and it's, you know, lifting rocks all the 
time, even when I was real small, so.  
 
VP: 
Besides the forklift, what other tools and machines do you use? 
 
HE: 
Well, you’re up on the pallet, you're up on the packer one day, then you come to, you’re 
the extra man on another day. So, that means you have to fill in wherever you're needed. And 
then the next day you're on the forklift and then it starts all over again. You open the pallet 
packer and some days you have very good days up there, where you don't hardly miss a bag 
and other times you get bad bags and it's, you hate being up there, but it's strenuous a lot of 
times and it's stressful sometimes, too. But luckily, I am getting close to the end of my career 
here, so.  
 
VP: 
When are you retired?  
4 
 
 
HE: 
I wanted to go at the end of this year, but that's not going to happen because the stock 
market 401 K just isn't doing what it's supposed to. So, I just have to wait another year.  
 
VP: 
What is it like to work around dust?  
 
[00:10:07] 
 
HE: 
The dust doesn't really bother me. I used to get the rashes when I first started here, but 
I pretty much got used to it and it doesn't bother me at all anymore.  
 
VP: 
What are the rashes?  
 
HE: 
You get, like, a cement burn from when you sweat and the cement gets on you. Even if 
you read the back of the bag, it talks about burns and that's what it does, it'll burn your skin. 
That's why we don't allow shorts or stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
What you say is the most challenging part of your work?  
 
HE: 
Oh, knowing all the equipment, because there's so many buttons and everything else. 
And you have to, you have to try to fix something fast when it goes down. Like, if your bag 
count gets off, if an empty bag comes down, which happens sometimes, it throws everything 
off, throws bag counts. Sometimes it goes through and then it messes up the pallet. Then you 
have to eject it and take it to the back and then you have to restack that by hand. So, it's a lot 
of buttons. And with the changes in upgrading and stuff that changes also. I know, I've seen 
videos of new palletizers and stuff running and how simple they seem to be compared to our 
old one, because everything's a touch screen on the new ones instead of buttons. But I'm pretty 
much well acquainted with all the stuff since I've been there for so long. Most of the time they 
will call me over if I'm somewhere else, just to take a look at it and fix it and stuff like that, so.  
 
VP: 
Um, did you get some additional training on for the incoming technology or...?  
 
HE: 
Uh, just when the tech, the new tech came to set it up. We were there with him and he 
showed us everything. But the very first one, he did a very bad job. The last, like I said, the last 
one was the best one we had so far because the first one showed us ways to do stuff and it 
wasn't supposed to be done that way. It's supposed to be done a different way. So, maybe that's 
why it's running a lot better. He showed us all the proper way of changing bag sizes and all that 
stuff, so.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned there are bag counts, so there's kind of a standard that you have to 
meet on a daily basis?  
 
HE: 
No, not really. It's we're not the busiest yet because we used to be very busy. But it's, 
with the economy and Covid, it just hasn't picked back up yet. So, it's good to have some of 
the other companies, if they're down, to have us do the bags, it helps us out.  
 
VP: 
So, they bring the cement here, and bag them? 
 
5 
 
HE: 
 No, they bring their bags here and we'll, we will bag them. We have, there’s one up in 
New York right now we’re doing and we finished one in New York two weeks ago. And there 
is another customer that has their name on their bag that we have to make it for them.  
 
VP: 
So, it's a different bag 
 
HE: 
Yeah, mhm.   
 
VP: 
So, how long do projects typically take?  
 
HE: 
Um, which? 
 
VP: 
Like, bagging.  
 
HE: 
Uh, it depends right now. The one we're on for New York, they're taking we took five 
loads yesterday and that's the one before that that just stopped, they were taking five loads 
every single day, which is good because sometimes you only get 10 trucks a day anymore right 
now, so everything helps out.  
 
VP: 
Could you tell me a little bit about like a typical day at work for you. When do you 
start?  
 
[00:14:12] 
 
HE: 
Oh, yeah, I start at 5 o'clock in the morning, so I start loading trucks at 5, so I'm only 5 
AM-1PM. And usually there's some trucks waiting already at the door as soon as I open it up 
and it only takes me 10 minutes or less to load a flatbed truck. And then they just, sometimes 
they'll just keep coming one right after the other and you just don't get to stop. You'll get a 
couple of minutes to do their tickets because you have to actually go in a computer, bring your 
ticket up and do that stuff, because I, I will catch a lot of the mistakes on the tickets because 
they're not always put in correctly. So, the guys will sometimes call me for that too—they have 
a computer issue, so. But it's strenuous, it's hard on your knees a lot of times and it's just sitting 
on the hard work of seats, they're not very comfortable. We should have a regular chair.  
 
VP: 
Do you get a lunch break?  
 
HE: 
Uh, yes. I get to stop maybe for 20 minutes sometimes, maybe halfway through my 
shift. And then that's about it for me. On the down day when we're not packing, which we're 
getting some of them right now, we'll just take, everybody will take lunch together. So, it is 
only three of us in the office at the time.  
 
VP: 
What do you talk about at lunch?  
 
HE: 
Uh, some a lot of times we'll talk about family because most of them have children, so 
they'll talk about that. And we were starting to get together on a Friday night and just play little 
cards and dominoes and stuff like that. But we, it's been a while since we did it lately.  
 
VP: 
Do you get together at someone's house or.  
 
6 
 
HE: 
Yes, yeah, we’ve been at my house once and were going to switch it off, but we just 
didn't get around to it yet.  
 
VP: 
And is this people working just out of the packhouse?  
 
HE: 
Mm hmm. Yes.  
 
VP: 
Oh, that’s nice.  
 
HE: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, do you ever talk about cement at some of these gatherings?  
 
HE: 
Uh, we try not to, but it does come up, you know, different things, different customers 
or truck drivers that we don't like or stuff like that, because there's always some you have 
problems with.  
 
VP: 
And so how has the pandemic changed work at the packhouse for you?  
 
[00:16:50] 
 
HE: 
Uh, well, wearing the mask isn't the easiest, especially in the dustier places. But it's, and 
you have to, of course, you have the social distance. We can't sit close to each other. And we 
always have to watch the drivers. They all have to have their masks and all their PPE, which a 
lot of them don't. You either have to supply it or let them stay in their truck and they'll have to 
go off site to tarp it or strap it, which I don't really like, but in case something happens, but. I 
didn't talk to my boss about that yet. But it's, it did really slow everything up too. But hopefully 
it's almost over, with the vaccines. Most of my friends have had the vaccines already, so. I 
know some that will not get them, but you'll always have those.  
 
VP: 
And so, um, have you ever considered working on a different part of the plan?  
 
HE: 
Uh, not really. I'm not, usually I'm one that likes to stay in one spot. There's not many 
jobs here that you like to do a lot of them are shift. So, that's the that's the rough part. It's just 
changing shifts every week. That would be a little difficult for me, so. There's not too many 
that aren't shift and I'm too old to do repair. And the only other place would be the bulk silos. 
That's where a lot of the older guys go. But I don't know if I really like that you're cooped up 
in a room all day.  
 
VP: 
Well, how does that work look like?  
 
HE: 
Oh, basically, you're sitting at a computer and the driver will tell you what he's getting. 
You punch it in and then you just line them up with your scope and you fill their tanker.  
 
VP: 
So, there is, sort of, the work in the plant is divided by age groups in some ways? 
 
HE: 
Yeah, in some ways. You won't find too many old repairman here. They always try to 
go somewhere else.  
 
VP: 
How about in the packhouse? Do you have newcomers?  
7 
 
 
HE: 
No, not very often, because usually when a job comes up, somebody does not like their 
job somewhere else in the plant and they're going to come over. So, we very rarely get a young 
guy.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you feel like there's a difference in the way that cement workers thought 
about their work when you started or kind of your generation versus the newcomers?  
 
[00:19:39] 
 
HE: 
Oh, yeah, a little bit. Because when I first started here, this, we had a whole lot more 
people, too. But when you, when the people started here, whoever they were, they stayed here. 
Now, even when the newer guys, the younger guys, they come and some of them don't stay 
very long at all and some of them miss days and stuff like that. Before, the guys just didn't miss 
days. They just like their work and they had pride in what they did and they just never left. 
Some of them, the oldest one here is now in his 70s and he has no plans on leaving, I don’t 
think, so.   
 
VP: 
Why do you think there's that difference?  
 
HE: 
Oh, I don't really know. I know people change, kids, children change as they’re 
growing. And maybe it was their upbringing because my whole family has a, work ethic is very 
strong. They never, we never miss days, they work all the overtime they can. And my nephew 
works here also. He's the same way. And there's other guys that just turn down all the overtime. 
They just don't want it.  
 
VP: 
What does your nephew do at the plant?  
 
HE: 
He fills in on the payloader, so he's filling big shoots and all that kind of stuff. He’s first 
shift this week, he's also on shift a lot and he's expecting their second child. So, they're having 
the reveal the Saturday. So, I'm supposed to go to that.  
 
VP: 
And so, did you encourage him to join the cement industry or did he choose it himself?  
 
HE: 
No, I told him when the job came up and he wanted to come here. His dad and all my 
other brothers work at the Deka Battery, and he just didn't want to go there. So, he came here 
with me. Oh, he's not here ten years yet, I don't think. But it's, like he's just in his early 30s.  
 
VP: 
So, what's it like to work with family?  
 
[00:21:57] 
 
HE: 
Oh, well, I don't see him very much, that's for sure, because he is shift. He'll come over 
and eat lunch with us once in a while. But he got injured pretty badly here when he first started, 
got his arm caught in between a couple of rollers. But he just has, he has some bad scarring, 
but he still loves to be here, so. He works all the overtime he can get.  
 
VP: 
He intends to stay in his position? 
 
8 
 
HE: 
Yes. He hasn't well, he did talk about going to maintenance because it's more money 
and you get your training. And if something ever would happen, he could go somewhere else 
because he has a maintenance training, so. Not that it would, but you just never know 
nowadays.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, the worker is concerned about the longevity of the industry? 
 
HE: 
Some of them, yes. One of the oldest plants in the whole East Coast. So, you just never 
know of that. If they would put a new palletizer in, I wouldn't be worried at all, because then, 
you know, that's probably a million dollars at least. So, then you'd know they, they're planning 
on staying and doing being here for a long time. There is a lot of stuff still in the quarry. So, 
that's another good thing. You can think, last time I heard it was like twenty or thirty years of 
stone left in there, so. But it's tough sometimes because it runs in the back of your mind. For 
me, it's not bad. If something happened, I just retire. But it's for the younger, all the younger 
people here and some people have been retiring. So, now younger ones are coming in and you 
can see what they're doing. They're not used to making the kind of money they do here. So, 
they buy new houses, they buy new trucks and they go into debt right away. So, my nephew’s 
like that a lot. He just, he has to have everything new, new phones, new everything.  
 
VP: 
Are they so are the younger workers talking about environmental concerns?  
 
[00:24:24] 
 
HE: 
Oh, not really. We always have to monitor the dust here. So, we always watch our dust 
collectors and see if they're shooting stuff out so we can bring it up and then they'll get them 
fixed. Uh, whenever I see a spill, there's always somebody putting the hydry on it to soak it up 
and so you can get rid of that. I saw that on Saturday when I was here, a big trail of something 
and they were put in hydry on it, keep it out of the ground. So, they pretty much will do that. 
If they, if they notice it, they will take care of it, take care of all that kind of stuff. And we have 
a lot of monitoring stuff in the plant for the exhaust and everything else, especially for the kilns.  
 
VP: 
And how about, like, the kind of broader conversations about how the cement industry 
contributes to climate change, and how maybe governments restrict manufacture a bit more, is 
that a concern at all?  
 
HE: 
No, not really, because cement is so much of a renewable thing. It's, you're always, it 
does last forever. Not yet anyway. I'm sure they're going to work on something to add to it 
that'll make it last even longer. But and I know the infrastructure now with the bridges and 
everything else, we’ll have to see how that goes. But they’ve been talking about that for years. 
Well, we do supply cement for runways and stuff like that. This time was where you're just 
loading continuously bulk mostly, because the trucks come all the time.  
 
VP: 
Is that exciting to know? Like, that's the cement I worked on, that’s the concrete my 
cement made.  
 
HE: 
Yeah. It's because, you know, it has to be good or they wouldn't be getting it. So, and I, 
I don't really ever remember anything breaking apart of our cement anyway. So, it's, I take a 
lot of pride in whatever I do here because I don't like to load a truck crooked or anything. I 
always want it straight and I and I would like to get them out fast, too.  
 
9 
 
VP: 
Why is it important to load it straight?  
 
HE: 
Uh, if we, if you don't, you have gaps in between the pallets and as they're riding, even 
though they're strapped and tarped, the bags move just on the way the roads are because they're 
not very flat anymore. Then, we've gotten loads back that were all shifted to one side. Some of 
them are hanging off into the pallet, into the tarps. So, you want them as tight together as 
possible.  
 
VP: 
And so, does the shifting make the truck unstable, too?  
 
HE: 
Uh, sometimes because they'll be hanging off the edge because it depends how some of 
truck divers go too fast, too. They go around the corner too fast and sometimes they'll lose the 
whole load on the road because the straps, as the straps will get loose if they do not stop and 
tighten them. Every, in the beginning, they should do it every twenty miles or so and then they 
can up that as they go down the road because they do just separate, even if you have shrink-
wrap and stuff. No, ours aren't shrink-wrapped, our palletizers are not set up for that. But we 
do have a portable one that we do wrap for customers and they'll still, they'll still shift even 
though they're wrapped.  
 
VP: 
So, that's why it's important to have a good relationship with the driver.  
 
HE: 
Yes, yeah. I know they will probably be a little disappointed when I retire because, you 
know, I try to make sure that it's always a good load and they're always pushed together.  
 
VP: 
And they’re contractors, right?  
 
HE: 
Uh, some are outside contractors, some are actual drivers for companies, it's about 
probably 75 percent are actual company drivers for other companies that pick our cement up. 
And then there's some that are just owner operators that just own their own truck and do it. But 
that's getting to be a little lost art because of getting your own insurance and all that stuff, so.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, what would you say is sort of the, because you've worked in the industry for some 
years, what would you say is like a major transformation?  
 
[00:29:11] 
 
HE: 
Oh, well, I know in over in the plant, hardly any of it is the way it used to be when I 
first started here. There's no more clinker belts, everything switched to draglines and others, I 
forget what the one's called now, but it's real steep. It has steps so you can go up if you want, 
but I would never try it. I mean, it's really steep. And I know when I first started here, you used 
to have to take a hole and hole out from underneath the belts and they were moving. Now, that's 
not allowed. And but luckily there's no belts here like that. Everything's lock-out-tag-out. If 
you’re working on something that has to be switched, has to be pulled and it has to be locked 
out and you have to check it, make sure it doesn't work.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is your favorite part of your job? Why do you keep working?  
 
HE: 
Uh, well, I do like the people I work with and for the most part, the same ones all the 
time. And I know what I'm doing. If, you know, if something breaks, I like, I'm usually the first 
one there to try to fix it. And so, I like to do that. Even though I don't like the repair part of it. 
10 
 
I still know what to fix because I've seen it for 30 years. So, it's very easy for me to just pick a 
wrench up and do it and redo anything that’s, just doesn't, some of them just don't know when 
something happens and they don't know what what's wrong. And they'll ask me and I'm pretty, 
usually I know exactly what it is. That's the one good thing about working in one department 
for so long. You just know, you just know everything about it.  
 
VP: 
You're the expert.  
 
HE: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, in closing out the interview, is there something that I didn't ask you about or 
something you'd like to comment on?  
 
HE: 
Mm. No, I don't think so. I just wish we were busier, but it's a little tough, economy 
stuff right now, so we just have to wait, wait it out.  
 
VP:
