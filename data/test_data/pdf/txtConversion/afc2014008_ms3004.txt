Assistant Trust Officer, and myself*  We explained to Mrs. Lorry
 
her community rights in the community estate of herself and your
 
deceased father.  We also gave Mrs. Lomax copies of the schedules
 
enclosed

the assets on hand at the death of your father, show n  in

have been divided between columns headed Mr. Lomax Separote
 
and 1/2  Community and the four columns headed Children's
 
Interest.
 
Purchases made by Mr. Lomax after his marriage to Mrs. Ru y
 
Terrill Lomax in 1935, which have been divided between coiu
 
headed Mr. Lo o:: Se: 'ot .
 
1/2 Community.
 
The values shown in this detailed schedule are those as of
 
Joi
oi'y  26, 1948.  On the other schedule we have attempted to consol
 
idate the detailed figures and show four of the various interpretations
 
that might be placed upon Mr. Lomax's will as to the distribution of
 
his estate.  The will might be interpreted as set out in No. 1 to mean
 
that your father intended to distribute to you children the 1/2 of
 
your mother's est te and to let Mrs. Lomex take her 1/2 of the commun-
