I'd Like to See Ole Massa's Face Again. 
Sung by EMILE AMES with unbounded success in the great sketch, " The 
Return from the War." 
I 
is gittin' ole an' gray, an' I 
soon will pass away 
From dis earth to better realms beyond de sky, 
Whar my bean will find its rest in dat Eden of de blest, 
'Case I 
know it won't be long afore I 
die. 
Dar's but little rest for me, l'se unhappy as can be, 
An' my heart is filled wid sadness and wid pain ; 
But afore I 
goes away to dat land of perfect day, 
I 
would like to see ole massa's face again. 
CHORUS. 
For de ole home am so drear, 
Dar is nuffin left to cheer, 
I'll be lonely in de hours dat still remain 
But afore I 
go to rest 
In dat Eden of de blest, 
I 
would like to see Ole massa's face again. 
When a 
boy I 
used to roam ' round dis good ole happy home, 
Here I 
used to hoe de cotton an' de corn, 
Here my heart was ever light, an' de ole home ever bright, 
Here no sorrows on my pathway ever dawn, 
But my heart am sad to-day, since de white folks went away, 
An' de wird comes sighin' froo de corn an' cane ; 
But afore I 
lebe dis earth an' de ole home ob my birth, 
I 
would like to see ole massa's face again. 
For de ole home, &c. 
Ole missus she am dead, an' de last words dat she said 
I 
Ias grown dearer to my heart from year to year. 
She is sleepin' on de hill, by de good ole cotton mill, 
And upon her grave I 
often drops a 
tear. 
But I 
ain't got long- to weep o'er her form dat lies asleep, 
For dey soon will lay me in Oc shady lane ; 
But afore I 
goes to rest in dat Eden of de blest, 
I 
would like to see olc massa's face again. 
For de ole home, Scp. 
Good Ghepherd, Where Art Thou? 
Written by EMILE ANIES, and sung by the AMES' in their sketch, " The 
Return from the War." 
John was a 
writing, 
Writing for de show, 
Be Lord came down an' spoke to John, 
Saying " John, don't write no 
Noah was a 
carpenter, 
'Case he built the ark, 
And Jonah was a 
fisherman 
'Case he swallowed de shark. 
CHORUS. 
Good shepherd, whar art thou ? 
Good shepherd, whar art thou ? 
Oh, oh, good shepherd, 
Be sheep am gwine astray. 
Be Lord made de alligator, 
Den he made de whale, 
Den he made de bull-dog, 
Wid a 
ring around his tail. 
I 
had a 
little rooster, 
He wouldn't crow for day, 
I 
prayed for a 
weasel to come along 
An' tote dat rooster away. 
Good shepherd, &c, 
Written expressly for Emma AMES by BEN DODGE. 
Darkies, my old heart am weary, 
Wandering from you far away, 
But I 
know I'll soon feel cheery, 
For I'se coming home to-clay. 
Give me back de ole plantation, 
Never more from it I'll roam, 
Naught so dear in all creation—. 
Tell de folks I'm coming home. 
CHORUS. 
I'se a 
coming, yes a 
coming, 
Never more from you to roam; 
All around de ole plantation, 
Tell de folks I'm corning home. 
Do de sweet magnolias blossom 
Round my little cabin door ? 
Do de darkies hunt de possum 
As dey did in days ob yore ? 
Never more from you I'll wander, 
Never far away to roam ; 
Take dis message ober yonder; 
Tell de folks I'm coming home. 
Dedicated to EMILE AMES by W ILLIAM R.4I)CLIFFE. 
Way down in ole Kentucky, many years ago, 
Whar I 
used to hunt de possum an' de coon, 
Whar de darkies used to gather ' round an' hab a 
little dance, 
An' de banjo an' de fiddle was in tune. 
No more I'll hear dose merry sounds, or see dose days ob yore, 
Nor de little darkies playin' on de green, 
Nor de merry smiles ob Rosie Lee, de only flower dat bloomed 
Near de little ole log cabin by de stream. 
CHORUS, 
Den hang up de fiddle an' de banjo on de wall, 
Lay away de bones an' tambourine ; 
Since Death has taken off my Rose, the only flower 
bloomed 
Near de little ole log cabin near de stream. 
never, never shall forget those happy hours we spent, 
As we wandered together o'er de hill, 
Or sat beneath de willow an' watched de rollin' tide, 
Or listened to de clatter ob de mill. 
An' when de night was comin' on, an' de darkies' work was 
done, 
How dey used to come an' gather on de ?Teen, 
An' de banjo an' de fiddle would make de forest ring, 
Near de little ole log cabin by de stream. 
Den hang up de fiddle, 8tc. 
De stream is running just de same, de willows on its side 
Are now waving o'er de grave of Rosie Lee ; 
'Tis dere I 
sit beside her grave to pass de hours away, 
An' wonder. when de same shall shelter me. 
My steps am growing feeble, my hair am turning gray, 
But still de grass am growin' fresh an' green, 
An' here I'll wait till Death shall take me to my Rosie Lee, 
From my little ole log cabin by de stream. 
Den hang up de fiddle, &c, 
My Own Dear Home. 
Written and sung by EMILE and PAULINE AMES. 
Home, dear home, I 
never shall forget; 
Friends, clear friends there often I 
have met, 
And though afar to distant lands I 
roam, 
Still I 
will cherish you, my own dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Tender mem'ries ' round thee twine, 
Like the ivies clinging ' round the pine ; 
Over land and sea we may roam, 
Still I 
will cherish thee, my own dear home. 
Home, dear home, from you I 
ne'er will part, 
You are deep, deep buried in my heart; 
And though afar to distant lands I 
roam, 
Still will I 
cherish you, my own dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Tender mem'ries round me twine, 
Like the ivies growing ' round the pine ; 
Over land and sea we may roam, 
Still I 
will cherish thee, my own dear home.

Precepts at Parting. 
Delivered by EMILE AMES to great applause. 
Well, son, you's gwine to leab us, your lubbin' ole mammy 
and me. 
And set you'sel up as a 
waiter, aboa'd oh de Robbut E. Lee, 
Along wid dem fancy young niggers, what's ' shamed for to 
look at a 
hoe, 
And acts like a 
passel oh rich folks, when dey isn't got nuffin 
to show. 
You's had better trainin' dan dey has; I 
hopes ' at you'll 
'zibit more sense, 
Such niggers is like a 
young rooster, a 
sittin' ob top ob a 
fence; 
He keeps on a 
stretchin' and crowin', and while he's a 
blowin' 
his horn, 
Dem chickens what ain't arter fussin' is pickin' up all de corn. 
Now listen, and min' what I 
tell you, and don't forget what 
I 
say; 
Take de advice of a ' sperienced pussun, and you'll git up de 
ladder and stay. 
Who knows? You mought git to be President, or Jestice 
perhaps of de Peace ; 
De man wot keeps pullin' de grape-vine shakes down a 
few 
bunches at leas'. 
Dein niggers what runs on de ribber am mostly a 
mighty 
sharp set, 
Dey'd find out some way to beat you if you bet dem de water 
wuz wet. 
Yo' s 
got to watch out for dem fellers—dey'd cheat off de 
horns ob a 
cow— 
1 
knows ' em! I 
follered de ribber ' fore eber I 
follered de plow. 
You'll easy git ' long wid de white folks—de captain, steward 
and clerks— 
Dey won't say a 
word to a nigger, as long as dey notice he 
works ; 
PRECEPTS AT PARTING. 
Continued. 
And work is de onlies' ingine we's any ' casion to tote, 
To keep us gwine on froo de currents dat pesters de spiritual 
boat. 
I 
heered dis idea from a 
preacher—he ' lowed dat dis life wuz 
a 
stream, 
And ebery one's soul wuz a 
packet, dat runs wid a 
full head 
ob steam; 
Dat some wuz only stern-wheelers, while oders was mon-
s'ously fine— 
And dt trip wuz made safes' an' quickus' by boats ob de 
Meffodis line. 
I 
want you, my son, to be ' ticular, and ' sociate only wid dei 
Dat's ' titled to go in de cabin—don't nebber have nuffin to say 
To dem low-minded roustabout niggers, what handles de 
cotton below, 
Dem common brack raskels ain't fitten for any cabin waiter 
to know. 
But 
e' ,bc r 
git airy—be ' spectful to all de white people you 
see, 
And nebber go back on de raisin' you's had from your 
mammy and me, 
It's hard on your mudder you's leabin'—I don't know what-
ebbe: 
do ; 
And shorely your father'll miss you—I'll alluz be tinkin' 
ob you. 
Well, now, I's done told you my say, dar ain't nuffin more 
as I 
knows— 
'Cept dis: Don't you nebber come back, sah, unless you has 
money and clo'es; 
I's kept you as long as I's gwine to, now you an' me is done, 
And calves is too scarce in dis country to kill for a 
Prodigal 
Son, 
Darling, Love Me Once Again. 
Originally sung by PAULINE AMES. 
Published by HENRY C. 
W YATT, 
Richmond, Va. 
Dear one, speak to me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Make me sad whene'er we meet. 
Do not leave me now in scorn, 
Is my pure love all in vain ? 
Are those vows false that were sworn? 
Darling, love me once again. 
CHORUS. 
Dear one, speak lo me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Darling, speak to me again. 
Darling, in thy tender heart 
Dost some fond love still abide? 
Dear, one, say not we must part, 
Let me still be near thy side. 
Has it all been but a 
dream ? 
Say not yes, and give me pain ; 
Let some fond hope o'er me gleam, 
Darling, love me once again. 
Dear one, speak, & c... 
Dear one, do come back to me, 
Say, oh ! say you'll love me still ; 
Then you'll my poor heart relieve, 
And my hopes of pleasure fill. 
Then will dark clouds pass away, 
Bearing with them all my pain, 
Night to me will then be day, 
Darling, love me once again. 
Dear one, speak, &C, 
Old Uncle Dan. 
Sung with tremendous success by EMILE AMES. 
Long years ago, ere my hair had turned gray, 
Friends gathered ' round de ole cabin home; 
Happy, "contented, we passed de hours away, 
But my dee's in Heaven, an' beck'ning me to come. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hear dem sweetly singing, 
Welcome, welcome o'er; 
Dey seem to smile and beckon me 
To dat golden shore, 
Whar I 
shall meet dem all, 
An' dar lubbin faces see— 
Comin', Children, comin', 
Oh, prepare to welcome me. 
Massa and missus both sleep on de hill, 
Whar de little birds dere songs lub to sing; 
Time has done its work arl' used de old place up, 
De weeds am high, de fences down, an' dried up am de 
spring. 
I 
hear dem, &c. 
Though I'm here alone, I 
won't hab long to stay, 
Children am calling me for to come; 
Dey's openin' up de gate, an' I 
think I 
hear dem say: 
Uncle Dan, dat good ole man, we'll welcome to his 
home. 
I 
hear dem, &c. 
Written and delivered by EMILE AMES.

I 
had a 
dream, a 
happy, happy dream, 
I 
dreamt that I 
was free ; 
And in my own dear far off distant home 
I

CHORUS. 
Eva, Eva, Tell me where my Eva's gone, 
She has left here to sigh and to mourn, 
Can't you tell me where my Eva's gone I 
And in this that seem'd a 
happy dream, 
I 
was so proud and brave; 
And when I 
woke and found ' twas but a 
dream 
I 
found myself a 
slave! 
Eva, Eva, &c. 
I 
long to dream that happy dream again, 
To see my home so fair; 
For now I 
roam where all is sad and drear 
And life is full of care.

TWILIGHT IN THE Pat 
'TWAS on a 
summer's day. 
I 
met her all by chance; 
her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the ' mall," 
We strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take! 
We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words! 
She leaned upon my arm ; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast! 
CHORUS. 
Twilight in the Park! 
Twilight in the Park! 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark! 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark! 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the Park I 
She left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said good bye; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh! 
She said she'd collie again, 
And nam'd the time and place ; 
Her absence gave my heart such pain, 
For heav'n shone in her face ! 
So every day I 
watched 
In love's delightful trance, 
And sure enough, we met again, 
She knew me at a 
glance ! 
'Twas love at sight, I 
said, 
And as the day grew dark, 
I 
won her heart for ever more, 
At twilight in the Park ! 
&c.

Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her waist -- steal a 
gentle kiss, 
Anti whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your hoar, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart? 
Oho. —It's all among the clover, &c. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then rohe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so 
sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle 
bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho. - It's all among the clover, & c. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you 
half so well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
with bliss, 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss.

Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gaios, 
As for brains be could do without any.

Our ole massa used to like de fun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the ' picaninny figs " would turn upon dar heels 
Dc ole man would join dem in dar merry prance ; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows,

And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
H

(Chorus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say 
lie was sleeping ' neath de ole Palmetto*tree; 
If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

In Houston Street I 
had a

At a

I'd a

Who wished me to foot the bills. 
'Twas then I

Said " I'm a

I 
heard a

Inoognitio 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc. 
At my hotel I'm treated well,

It's quite a

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE, 
BANJO SOLO. 
(Yew air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
Deception just now is the rule all around, 
Its practiced in all shades of life; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid: 
Be careful look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand- mothers' time, 
Girls did'nt enamel or paint; 
Didnt' wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didnt' lace themselves up till they'd faint; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheeks di'dnt fade 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck. 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didnt' pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now its combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I 
got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid, 
But before you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully Taade.

LIFE is full of toil and trouble; 
Care and sorrow hover near; 
Gloomy thoughts by day oppress us, 
All our nights are pass'd in fear. 
Still a 
brighter day is coining, 
But tow'rd earth our heads are bow'd, 
And we cannot see the sunlight, 
Hid, just now, behind a 
cloud. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed ; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Ne'er despair, tho' life seem weary, 
All the bitter cup must quaff ; 
Weeping will not mend the matter, 
Better far at care to laugh. 
Life's a 
farce in which your acting. 
Should be careless, gay and proud, 
Like to his who sees the sunlight, 
E'en tho' hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate, etc. 
Laugh with scorn an 
d 
defiance 
To the ills that life can bring ; 
Trouble flees when met undaunted, 
Grief is robbed of half its sting. 
Firmly stand, erect and manly, 
Bend not like the pliant crowd, 
Light will beam in time upon you, 
Altho' now hid behind a 
cloud. 
foot-steps, soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our catage door, 
How I 
love to hear their trample, 
A3 I 
heard in days of yore I 
Tiny 1.2e.t. that traveled lightly 
In this weary world of woe— 
Now silent lie in yonder church-yard, 
'Neath the dismal grave bolow— 
Little hot-steps soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
How, I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore ! 
Little foot-steps, soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
How I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore ! 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking. 
By the golden river's shore: 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door— 
Sweetly now the angels carol 
Tidings from our loved one far, 
That she still does hover o'er us, 
A.nd will be our guiding star, 
After Twelve O'Clock. 
I'm thinking now of one dark night, 
I 
rambled on the street ; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright, 
The police on their beat. 
Should I 
relate just all I 
saw, 
Perchance your nerves I'd shock, 
For fearful are the sights ,ve see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
CHORUS. 
Come, roam the city round with me, 
Perhaps your nerves ' twill shock, 
For fearful are the sights you see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
Now first I 
saw a 
lab'ring men, 
While passing through a 
lane; 
His wages he was giving fast 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, though she. was stary'd, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
lust after twelve o'clock. 
Come, roam & c. 
And then there was another scene, 
I 
think it has been told, 
I 
saw a 
man escape from jail, 
The guard was bought with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock; 
And who can tell where this man went 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, & c, 
Now soon I 
reached the river's side, 
And paused there for a 
rest ; 
'Twas there I 
saw a 
poor young girl, 
Her babe clasped to her breast: 
Her marriage was a 
mockery— 
She jumped out from the dock— 
A 
shriek ! a 
splash 
th waves rolled on, 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, & c. 
82 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore: 
And my heart it yearns with sadnesi 
When I 
pass that cottage door— 
Little foot-steps,SA. 
-Little foot-steps now will journey 
In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly 
By the golden rives shore— 
Mother, weep not: father grieve not: 
Try to smooth your troubles o'er--
For I'll think of her as sleeping, 
Not as dead, but gone before. 
Little foot-steps now will journey 
In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press Ole sand-banks liiitly 
By the golden river's shore 
Little foot-steps. ifze.

And Summer roses die, 
Ant... Winter winds blow fierce and cold, 
And daisies scattered lie ; 
My sweetheart's in another clime, 
Safe in his arms I'll be, 
The bells will toll our wedding chimes, 
And bring new joys to me. 
CHORUS. 
Ring, ring, ye merry chiming bells, 
Loud let your joyous echoes swell. 
Then flee away, ye present hours, 
With pleasures still untold, 
And bring again those happy hours 
When Autumn tints the leaves with gold. 
We'll wander through the falling leaves, 
Acros the russet plain, 
And down anh-mg the golden sheaves 
We'll talk of love again. 
Our lives will be like happy flowers, 
From care and troubles free ; 
Then flee away, ye present hours, 
And bring my love to me.

Charming Little Lu. 
Sung only as a 
Song and Dance by EANNIE 13EANE. 
'Twas at a 
fancy ball at St. James' Hall, 
With the prettiest fellow in the nation, 
I 
at once did go, thinking there to show 
My dancing skill, and gain his approbation, 
But, strange to say, I 
dared not dance, 
Nor could I 
leave my seat, 
Though poor dear Gussy came to me, 
And thus he did entreat: 
CHORUS. 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
In the mazy polka and the lanciers? 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
And mingle with the merry, merry dancers ? 
When we left the ball, I 
then told him all 
Of my sad determination, 
And, like all the rest, I 
did try lily best 
To keep down all his rash indignation. 
My hair- pins gone, my braids were loose, 
To dance I 
did not dare ; 
My chignon surely would came off, 
And make the people stare. 
SPOKEN.—Of course when I 
informed Gussy, dear, that 
was liable to lose all my back hair if I 
danced, he could not 
do otherwise than say— 
Clever little Lu, that was brave of you, 
Not to dance the polka or the lanciers, &c,

Let the music ring ; we'll dance and sing, 
And shout like all creation ; 
All for de good old times we had 
Way down on de old plantation. 
CHLoE.--Dear missey, too, she was so kind 
To all us buggers ' round ; 
In our sickness or distress 
She always could be found. 
To do good war her delight, 
She'd a 
smile for every one. 
87 
But now she's wid de angels— 
For to hebben she has gone. 
(Same music as in first.) 
SPOKEN.—Dar goes dat music again.

All tings are going to waste ; 
We'll neber see de like again 
Upon old massa's place.

But de old banjo am heard no more 
Way down in Tennessee.

Forty years ago, life's pleasures, 
To this poor old man was sweet, 
But now they are a 
heavy load, 
For poor old uncle Pete. 
CHORUS. 
I 
know I'm black, but I 
can't help that, 
For it only runs skin deep, 
You'll find there beats a 
good white heart, 
In poor old uncle Pete. (Repeat.) 
Forty years ago that old plantation 
Was my good old home, 
And poor old Hannah and I, 
Across those fields did roam; 
But now she's gone to dwell on High, 
May the Lamb her poor soul keep, 
For she left no one to mourn her loss 
But poor old uncle Pete. 
I 
know I'm black, &c. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
While out in the country last Summer I 
wedded 
A 
blushing young damsel whom I 
thought sublime, 
Immediately after we moved to the city, 
Where we have lived happy the most of the time; 
Until last Friday night my homestead I 
entered, 
I 
saw there a 
young man, nineteen if a 
day, 
And as I 
g,azed at him, completely bewildered, 
The wife of my bosom unto me did say— 
CHORE'S. 
Don't take any notice, it's only my cousin, 
Don't let a 
small matter like this one annoy; 
Now don't get excited, it' 
only my cousin, 
You mustn't mind Willie—he's only a 
boy. 
My wife with her cousin was very much smitten, 
At least so it seemed by her actions that night, 
For she called him " Dear Willie" in tones very tender, 
Now I 
ask any married man if it was right; 
When the clock on the mantel struck the hour of eleven. 
She kissed him good- night ere he went to his bed, 
I 
sprang to my feet in a 
horrible passion, 
But my wife stopped my growling, and quietly said— 
Don't take any notice, etc. 
Next evening as I 
was from labor returning, 
A 
friend told me something which addled my brain, 
My wife and her cousin had " sloped" from the city, 
He'd seen them buy tickets and leave on the train; 
I 
rushed to the house, at the door met the servant, 
The truth of the statement I 
read in her face, 
My wife had shook me for her dear cousin Willie, 
She'd left her fond husband to live in disgrace. 
SPOKEY.—After my friend had given me the unwelcome in-
formation I 
rushed frantically home. 
The door was locked; 
tN-ith one tremendous kick I 
burst it open. 
The servant girl 
met me in the hall and said, " Good Heavens, Mr. Dodge! what 
is the matter ?" 
I 
asked for my wife; she told me the madam 
had only gone out for a 
short walk. (Even the servants were 
conspiring against me.) I 
hurried up stairs to our bedchamber. 
There upon the dressing ease lay a 
note addressed to me. I 
quickly picked it up, tore it open, and there, plainly written I 
read— 
Don't take any notice, etc.

" 
DOLLARS." 
Words and Music by ROBERT MORAL 
There is a 
word you can hear almost every day, 
Every one longs for it, go where you may, 
It's sought by the rich, by the poor, by the gay, 
In fact over everything it has a 
sway, 
I 
see you have all guessed the subject ' ere this, 
It's dollars, to have them is certainly bliss, 
It's the source of all trouble, the bottom of crime, 
And dollars the motto you'll everywhere find. 
What was it that opened the White House to Hayes, 
Defrauded another man out of the place, 
What was it took Stanley thro' Africa's wilds, 
That stirs up the muse of G. Washington Childs, 
What was it that tempted the widow so gay, 
When she married the millionaire, Lord, tothc: day, 
What was it, but au, it is plain to your minds, 
'Twas dollars the motto one everywhere finds. 
Why is it that Beecher looks after the lambs, 
That Murphy discourses on snakes and jim-
jams, 
Why is it Johannes, the Count off his nut, 
On the stage of New York is permitted to strut, 
Why is it that Moody and Sankey exort, 
And cry " Halelujah" and sing '' Hold the Fort," 
Why is it, but ah, I'm sure everyone knows, 
That dollars the rage as they put on their bows. 
Ncr11:- was such attention to Gen'l Grant paid, 
What was it that started the late excise raid, 
Why is it that Conkling and Mathews and Blaine, 
In the Senate at Washington are now raising coin, 
One thing more my dear friends I 
would say ' cre I 
go, 
It's a 
fact and I 
think it is well you should know, 
You may think I 
do thfis for the love of the thing, 
But without the dollars you may bet I 
wouldn't sing. 
41 
[DOLLARS. --- Continued.] 
Now what was it that did win when Hayes was counted in? 
Made Peter Sweeney cross the raging main ? 
What made old Beecher say, it was only the other day, 
That bread and water would your life sustain? 
What makes tailors go to sea, that when on land they '11 
have a 
spree? 
What makes a 
man go home and scold his wife ? 
Knock down his mother-in-law 
When she gives him too much jaw? 
It's naught but dollars, you can bet your life. 
What makes girls big vesters wear— 
A 
church steeple in their hair— 
A 
bustle large enough to fill a 
store? 
What makes them wink their eye 
At the young men passing by? 
It 's 
naught but dollars rules this wide world o'er. 
Now what dyes a 
swell's moustache 
When he goes a 
girl to mash? 
What makes the ladies nice stripe stockings wear? 
Now what makes a 
parson pray—but don't give it away— 
But dollars, dollars, everywhere? 
What makes companies burst, sure, 
When your life you do insure? 
What makes each savings bank sky-high to go? 
A 
policeman makes a 
raid, just to stop the poor man's trade, 
Just so that at your dollars he'll get a 
show. 
Why do all the women suppose 
Each babe has its father's nose,— 
I 
mean when your first born it comes to light? 
Why do I 
here engage singing nightly on the stage? 
You bet it's dollars, and you'11 bet it's right. 
Break. 
Break.

TURNEY, as sung by the great ARNOLD BROTHERS, 
at riRs Broadway, N. Y. 
IN every station high or low, 
Success you may obtain, 
If you will only strive, my friends, 
This precious prize to gain; 
When we were young and learning, 
This thought it struck our mind, 
And if you will observe us close, 
You will say, oh I

Now watch the graceful movements of our feet, 
Our style and time it can't be beat,

To do what e'er we would, 
For when they play the music so soft and sweet, 
Oh! it makes us feel so good. 
Now if you would take or advice, 
In what you undertake, 
Always go at it with a

Be sure of no mistake; 
Put your ambition all on it, 
And always bear in mind, 
This rule I

If, like us, you would have it fine, 
No watch the graceful, etc.

Don't Let Us Meet As Strangers. 
PARODY. 
Written by Sem. SERTREW. 
AIR. — " 
Must We Then Meet as Strangers." 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After all our rows 
And fights we've had together 
And many hard struck blows, 
Life without them were awful, 
To separate from thee, 
No more to fight or quarrel, 
Would be the death of me. 
Cnortus. 
Oh, hit me with a 
hammer, 
Do anything that's mean, 
Don't let us meet as strangers, 
My darling Imogene. 
How oft your smiles and glances 
flare given me the cramps, 
flow oft when playing " poker" 
You've won from me my stamps, 
Must we then stop our fighting 
Because I 
struck you foul, 
And always keep your back up 
And never have a 
growl. 
I'll love you in the.morning, 
I'll love you noon and night, 
Ph love you all my life time 
And never quit your sight, 
I'll fire you out the window, 
I'll pitch you down the stairs 
If you don't stop your 
kicking" 
And putting on your airs.

DON'T YOU TELL MY FATHER 846 
Swag by J. L. THAvEn. 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with darling Flo, 
I'd have you all to know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That love, yes, sweet love around us sheds its glcost: 
Don't you wish you were me ? 
She is a 
little dove, 
The only one I 
love, 
A 
pretty, coaxing wheedling little thing; 
If to kiss her 
try, 
"Oh don't," she's sure to cry, 
But afterwards you're sure to hear her sing—. 
°MMUS. 
You may kiss me and caress me, 
And I 
won't say no. 
I 
won't say no, 
I 
won't say no; 
You may squeeze me if it please yen, 
And I 
won't say no— 
But don't you tell my father! 
We oftimes go courting in a 
quiet country lane, 
To offend her I'd disdain; 
Her love I 
hope to gain, 
For I 
love her, yes, I 
love her, and I'll never cause her pain, 
If she'll be true to me. 
She's the apple of my eye, 
I 
love her like pie, 
I've courted her for many a 
weary day; 
I 
asked her to be mine, 
No longer could I 
pine, 
She looked, and laughed, and then to me did say— 
You may kiss me, &c. 
ller father, that's the old man, is very fond of me ; 
We're soon to married be, 
And then there'll be a 
spree! 
If fortune should but favor her with children for her knee. 
How nice to be a 
Pa! 
Thus happy night and day 
The time will pass away; 
With the little ones I'll play, while round they cling, 
And thus so blithe and gay, 
We'll bask in love's sweet ray, 
When seated 'round the fire she can sing— 
. 
11:01 may kiss me, isc.,

The queen of all the sunny brows, 
The brightest rosebud there.

AB SWEET AS A 
ROSE IS SHE, 
Poetry by BoBBY NEwCOMR. 
AS sweet as the rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace, 
Her eyes they have pierced my heart through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
He voice is as clear as the lark, 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Her breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as the rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright, 
Fairer than all to me, I 
think of her day and night. 
There's none in this world so wide, 
Could be the same to me, 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love, 
I'á willingly sacrifice life, 
To call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says • • I 
shan't," 
Then tells me I 
must her forget, 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't. 
As sweet as the rose, ttc. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whese hand I 
have sighed, 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hope I 
may yet win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for life, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then perhaps I 
will show you my wife, 
As sweet as the rose, &A

Are We Forgotten So Soon When 
Werie Gone? 
words and Music by CLAUDE DE 
HAVEN. 
Dedicated to 
JOsEETL JEFFERSON. 
Sung by TELE GREAT DUNBAR, the 
" 
Milanese Minstrel" 
Have we a 
place no longer in your hearts, 
Since the &Irk river of Death we have crossed; 
Will not the unbidden tears sometimes start, 
As you recall us, the loved and the lost. 
Here, in our prison of silence and gloom; 
Still we number our life's Sunny noon; 
Wlin you have laid us to rest in the tomb, 
we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
CHOR17S. 
When the grave receives its trust— 
Earth to earth, and dust to dust— 
Are we at once from your :nemory torn— 
Are we forgotten so soon when we're gone? 
Think how we cherished and loved you on earth, 
Watched o'er your footsteps with tenderest care; 
Wept in your sorrow, rejoiced in your Jnirth— 
Welcome no pleasure which you did not share. 
Give us, again, our lost place in your heart; 
Keep the sweet chords of affection in tune, 
When for the realms of shadows we part; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
CHORUS. 
When the last fond tie is broken— 
When the last farewell is spoken— 
Are we at once from your memory torn; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon?

'Twas in the orchard, Susie, darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
carted you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
With joy and ecstacy— 
The memory is so sweet— 
Of when we first did rat 
The sweetest fruit 
That ripens on a 
tree, 
With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh Susie, my darling, Sce., 
SUNNY LAND. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By 
COTTON SL 
BLEDUE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay-bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the greea, 
We'd join them in the festive dance! 
Cnoitus. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have. 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand ; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in our sunny land!

'TWAS only by the merest chance, 
In the sununer-house I 
found her, 
Asleep amid the violets, 
With rose leaves dropping round her. 
i 
gazed enraptured on her sleep, 
While carelessly advancing, 
'Till tempted by her rosy lips, 
I 
stole a 
kiss entrancing. 
CHORUS. 
She says she often wanders them, 
And carelessly reposes, 
And always has such pleasant:dreams, 
In the summer-house of roses. 
I'm not quite sure she was asleep, 
Perhaps was only feigning, 
For : 111 the while a 
lurking smile, 
She seemed to be restraining ; 
But then, I 
thought I 
saw her blush, 
A. momentary gleaming, 
But that might possibly been caused, 
B.,
- something she was dreaming. 
She says she often, &c. 
Written expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME7 by BEN DODGE. 
I'll sing you a 
song, it's not very long, 
Of a 
charmer whose sweet name was Sally, 
She lived with her mother, her sister, and brother, 
In a 
tenement house up an alley; 
But she gave me the shake for a 
fellow named Jake, 
In a 
manner that wasn't so slow, 
And she'd listen each night, in the greatest delight, 
While he played on the-old banjo. 
CHORUS. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Nip up de dooden day, 
That was the music which stole her away. 
Pluuk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Now, I 
hadn't a 
show, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
I 
spent all my cash in mating a 
dash, 
To try and win my charmer's hand, 
But I 
found mighty soon, that I 
was a 
loon, 
And no show in the game did I 
stand: 
I 
played a 
fool's part, for she'd given her heart 
To the fellow who heat me you know, 
I 
had to take water, for I 
found he had caught her, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
At last they were wed, and I've heard it said, 
They lead a 
most miserable life, 
They're wretched and poor, and she's sorry I'm sure 
That ever she became his wife; 
For their bread and butter, they stand in the gutter, 
And giving a 
sort of It show; 
The jaw-bone she tickles, and picks up the nickels, 
When he plays on the old banjo. 
Plunk, plunk, etc. 
RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one lio.s gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Sonic one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their light. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Hc:wen s 
glad shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door.

Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
DE moon is shining bright now, 
As I 
sit beside de cabin door, 
I

Dat lived on de old Virginny shore, 
We once was happy in de old home, 
Before old master's soul did roam, 
But now the poor darkey's have to wander, 
Far from de old Kentucky home. 
Good bye, old folks, good bye, 
Now we'll have to roam, 
Since master's gone and left us, 
And our old Kentucky home.

Dem was de good old times, 
When you could save de dimes. 
But now tem times am gone and passed away. 
But give n

And my story am soon told, 
Dais when old man Hickory Jaekson had his day, 
One thing more I'd like to say, 
Just before I

Of the times I

I

And many a

But when de work was done, we darkey's had de fun, 
Old master got our jug and cleared de way, 
For de old Virginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel, 
Data when old man Hickory Jackson had his day.

MY DEW DROP PEARL. 
By W M. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
AS 
sung by DELEHANTY 
CITIAMINGg. 
Yes, they ask me why I 
always seem so happy, 
And they criticize my gay and airy style, 
But they know not how I 
love a 
little beauty; 
I'm swimming in the sweetness of her smile, 
Little angels seem to hover all around me, 
While the birds direct to me their joyous lay, 
And the fish within the streamlet play to please me, 
Since I 
met this little flower, Lilly May. 
CHORUS. 
More lovely than the blooming rose, 
The dew drop pearl within ; 
And constant as the stream that flowb, 
A 
precious prize to win. 
There's a 
band of angels singing in her laughter, 
And a 
cupid merry making in her eye; 
With a 
shyness like the pearl I 
named hex after, 
Recollection of her beauty brings a 
sigh; 
But she said she always wished to see me happy, 
Would help to ease my days of care and strife, 
And a 
sweeter, dearer vow she lately made me, 
'Twas her willingness to share my future life. 
More lovely, &a

The evening breeze is ebbing low 
A 
lullaby to- day 
I 
have a 
question I \valid ask 
Before it dies away. 
The pebbles on the beach are dry 
The tide has sunken low; 
A little form is standing near 
Between the ebb and flow. 
CHORUS. 
She's just a 
roguish little dear, 
And it was not very late 
As she whispered " yes !" and shed a 
tear 
As we parted at the gate. 
A little heart that longing waits 
To know what next ' twill hear, 
A 
little face that shyly looks 
To st c 
if still I'm near. 
Ah ! little heart that whispered, " Yes," 
Though pouting lips said, " No," 
You thought that you'd be asked again 
Between the ebb and flow. 
A little face half frightened when 
I 
turn to go away, 
Two little hands that shyly reach 
As if to bid me stay; 
A little voice that softly says, 
I 
did not mean that " No;" 
A 
little pride that well was lost 
"Between the ebb and flow." 
Ch orus.

When the whippoorwill is calling. I 
will meet thee Mattie 
darling, 
Yes, T 
11 meet thee at the elder near the tree, 
For your heart to me is so true, I 
am longing to caress you, 
As in spring time, when we used to cross the lea ; 
The pale moon so full and swelling, it would light you from 
your dwelling. 
So remember, Mattie dearest, meet me there, 
And a show'r of loving kissestwill help constitute our 
blisses, 
While I 
nestle beds of roses in your hair. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, sweetly calling, Mattie 
darling. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, whippoorwill. 
When the stars begin to twinkle, and the dews begin to 
sprinkle, 
I 
will meet thee at the call of whippoorwill. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, and the dew is softly 
I 
will press thee to my bosom, Mattie dear, 
For your flowing, golden tresses, and your loving warm 
caresses. 
I 
do cherish so, and long to have them near; 
Then the tiny stars will twinkle, and the dew the grass will 
sprinkle, 
While the fire-fly shows at intervals its light, 
So remember, Mattie darling, when the whippoorwill is 
calling, 
You must meet me with your smiling face so bright. 
When the whippoorwill, &c.

WHEN YOU AND I 
WERE YOUNG. 
Written by G. L. STOUTE. 
Music by W ANNEMACUM 
And sung by Miss ADA W RAY. 
I'M thinking now of olden times, 
When you and I 
were young, 
Of the school- house porch where oft we played, 
The many songs we sung; 
The small green plot before the door, 
Where oft we skipped and run, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
Of the village church whose silver-chimes, 
Re-echoed through the dell, 
The moss-grown rock of olden times, 
That stood beside the well; 
The creeping ivy evergreen, 
To the ruined mill it hung, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
wore young. 
The village church has passed away, 
The bells no more resound, 
The ivy from the ruined mill 
Lies scattered on the ground; 
The school-house porch, where oft we played, 
With laughter, how it rung, 
Is changed, alas, like everything, 
since you and I 
were young.

It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

ford some innocent amusement to many, we do nut hesitate to realm-

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of mesas et 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dire 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an wale-red 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed is the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted be two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
