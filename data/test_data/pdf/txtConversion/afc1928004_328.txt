On, promise to meet me when twilight is falling 
Beside the bright waters that slumber so fair; 
Each bird in the meadow your name will be calling, 
And ev'ry sweet rosebud will look for you there; 
It's morning and evening, for you I 
am sighing, 
The heart in my bosom is yours evermore; 
I'll watch for you, darling, when daylight is dying, 
Sweet rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
My heart is a 
nest that is robbed and forsaken, 
When gone from my sight is the girl that I 
love! 
One word from your lips can my gladness awaken— 
Your smile is the smile of the angels above I 
Then meet me at twilight beside the bright waters, 
The love that I've told you, I'd whisper once more; 
Oh, sweetest and fairest of Erin's fair daughters— 
Dear rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
TELL ME WHERE IS FANCY BRED. 
TELL me where is fancy bred, 
Or in the heart, or in the head 7 
How begot, how nourished 
It is engender'd in the eyes, 
With gazing fed; and fancy dies 
In the cradle where it lies: 
Let us all ring fancy's knell; 
I'll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell, 
Ding, dong, bell.

On, fare you well, darling, I leave you to- morrow, 
I'm going to take sail for the land of the free ; 
Our parting is sad, but, dear, dry up your sorrow, 
Oh, why do you grieve me thus, Kitty McGee'? 
Do you think I'll forget— that I'll e'er prove unfaithful ? 
Oh no, darling, I'll only love you the more ; 
Ill write to you weekly, I'll send you my picture, 
And I'll pray for my Kitty, the one I adore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Kitty McGee, with my whole heart I love you, 
For you I am going across the dark sea; 
I'll work for you, pray for you, bless you forever, 
And lovingly wait for my Kitty McGee! oh, Kitty McGee. 
I'll work with a will, and 
save all my money, 
I'll not touch a drop of old " poteen" or beer; 
go to church Sunday, and go to work Monday, 
And send you the money to bring you on there; 
I'll buy me a hut, and I'll buy all that 's in it, 
And when you are ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Just write me a letter, and say that you're coming, 
And 
wait for my darling, my Kitty McGee. 
Oh, Kitty McGee, etc.

MUST we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy ? 
Oh. must the love we plighted 
One bitter word destroy ! 
Life without thee were lonely ; 
Thou art my spirit's sigh; 
Bid not affection's roses 
Wither and fade and die; 
Oh, must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy ? 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams or joy ? 
Can we then meet as strangers, 
When we recall the past ! 
Will not its beauteous vision 
Deathless in mera'ry last 
Give me the smiles of gladness 
Once I 
could fondly claim 
Whisper with sweet affection— 
Whisper that once loved name 
Oh, must the love we plighted 
One headless word destroy 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy

GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M . 
DEWrrr.) 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
cabin with an open window. 
Enter TEDDY, with a 
bundle slung over his shoulder.] 
TEDDY.—I've had a 
hard time of it here in ould Erin, and 
although I've tried to keep up my spirits for the sake of my 
dear colleen, I've at last been forced to go over the sea. 
It's 
hard, hard times 1n the ould land, and I 
must be off to the 
new. 
But do you think that I 
ever can forget you, Erin dar-
ling? 
Bad luck to the Irishman that ever did! 
One more 
sweet kiss from the girl I 
love, and then for the big ship. 
This is Biddy's cabin. 
She must be up. 
I'll knock. [Knocks 
at cabin door.] 
Biddy acushla! 
[BIDDY at the open, window.] 
BIDDY. — IS 
that you, Teddy ? 
TEDDY.- —Yes, darlint, and I'm going away; so Y 
thought I'd 
come and say good-bye. 
BIDDY.—Going away so soon? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint; but it won't be for long. 
I'll soon 
clasp you to my heart again, and we shall be ms happy as the 
starling. 
BIDDY.—But, you'll forget me, Teddy; they say there's pret-
tier faces over there than you'll find at home, to steal away 
your heart. 
TEDDY.—IR it prettier faces there than here ? 
Why, beau-
tiful girls in ould Ireland are as plentiful as the daisies; and 
you are the queen of them all. 
I 
could never forget you, 
Biddy; don't speak like that. 
Sure among ten thousand lovely 
girls I 
couldn't see one but you. 
[Music plays the symphony of the song. 
BIDDY and TEDDY 
clasp hands at the window.] 
TEDDY sings. 
Then here I 
am an Irishman, 
I'm always fond of mirth; 
But show me the creature 
Would slight me for my birth. 
( 
1 ) 
GOOD-BYL, BIDDY DEAR.—[Comrummi 
And here's my sweet colleen 
I'm forced to leave behind; 
I 
always was the broth of a 
boy, 
And my true love she is kind. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
Biddy

Teddy 
ear ; 
'Tis hard to part from you; 
Although we're going to sever, 
My heart it will prove true. 
Then cheer up, mavourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
We soon will meet again, love, 
When these gloomy days are gone. 
TEDDY.—I 
wouldn't leave ould Ire-and, 
But times are bad, you know; 
So to the land of plenty, 
My darlint, I 
must go. 
I 
bundled up my kit, 
Oh, Biddy, don't you cry; 
The vessel soon will bear me on 
With many a 
weary sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
TEDDY.—When I 
arrive, my darlint, 
There'll be joy within my soul, 
I'll work and save my money, 
And send you, love, the whole. 
The maidens may be fair; 
But, Biddy, never fear— 
The last words that you say will still 
Be ringing in my ears. 
CHORUS— BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
( 
2 ) 
GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR.—[ContTniIIED.] 
TEDDY.—Now I 
must say good-bye to you, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
The ship will soon be sailing 
Far out from Dublin Bay. 
But, Biddy, soon expect me, 
We'll marry by-and-bye; 
Oh, when you are for ever mine, 
No more I'll weep and sigh. 
[Same as before.] 
[They embraze, and TEDDY departs, leaving BIDDY looking 
sorrowfully after him.] 
GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 
An old man sat all desolate, 
A sire of some seventy years ; 
Ills cheeks once hale, were now worn and pale, 
His eyes bedimmed with tears. 
His body bent, o'er a 
grave he leant, 
And cried out, " My Nora's gone, 
And she's left me here, in this world of drear, 
My own little Colleen Bawn." 
The birds of song, the groves among, 
Mock his grief with their merry strain ; 
And with music sweet, they the old man greet, 
But their songs were all in vain ; 
He heeded not their merry note, 
But sadly did he moan, 
" 
Oh 
thou art gone, I 
still live on, 
My own little Colleen Bawn.” 
The flowers of May, that summer's day, 
Bloomed over his favorite child, 
And the old man wept as he knelt where she slept, 
And thought on her spirit mild ; 
For no Summeer hour, nor bin], nor flower, 
That e'er bedecked the lawn, 
Could gladden his sight, or his heart make light, 
Since he'd lost his Colleen Bawn. 
[1] 
THE COLT.RTIN BAWN. [CONCLUDED. 
" 
Aim, Colleen I " he cried, " since thy mother died, 
Thou the whole world well to me ; 
And even thy smile could my heart beguile, 
From the depth of its misery ; 
Light, light was thy form, thy bosom warm, 
And gladsome as a 
fawn. 
But thou art dead, I 
kneel by thy head, 
My own little Colleen Bawn. 
"My Colleen dear, I'm kneeling here, 
In the place where thy grave is made ; 
Alit why didst thou die, or why am not I 
With thee in the grave now laid ? 
I'm old and worn, and now quite forlorn, 
Then pray for me darling one, 
'That I 
soon may return, in my coffin borne, 
To join thee, my Colleen Bawn." 
The old man sped to his cottage bed, 
And he laid him calmly down ;* 
And a 
spirit bright as a 
form of light, 
To the old man's eyes was shown. 
It brighter grew, and the old man knew 
The days of his grief were done ; 
One sigh he gave o'er her early grave, 
And he slept with his Colleen Bawn.

Wait for me at heaven's gate,

Lonely like a 
withered tree, 
What is all the world to me 7 
Life and light were all in thee, 
Sweet Belle Mahone. 
Daisies pale are growing o'er, 
All my heart can e'er adore,

Calmly, sweetly slumber on. 
Only one I

With thee I'll be wandering,

more. 
Hard is the world, it will rudely reprove thee; 
Thy friends will retire when the tempest is near; 
Now is my season, and now will I 
love thee, 
And cheer thee when none but thy Mary will cheer. 
Come to my arms— thou art dearer than ever! 
But breathe not a 
whisper of sorrow for me I 
Fear shall not reach me, nor misery sever,— 
Thy Mary is worthy of love and of thee.

As sung by NED HARRIGAN.

I 
list to the lay of a 
po.)r Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
rut, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
it's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw; 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth i 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dwaing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget PheHui Bra y, the Bard of Armagh.

fripisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenn Bay 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at 3lucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tinta, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fait: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony„ 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud- wreaths in that sky, 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine: 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

I'LL go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm sighing, my dearest, for one glance at you ; 
I 
loncr, for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow that sparkle with dew. 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary, 
I've thought of you, darling, by night and by day; 
And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away. 
Ah! I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I 
cannot, I 
cannot no longer delay; 
I 
lone- for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
And, Barney, my love, I'll be soon on the way. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you and those bright auburn curls; 
I 
sigh for the scenes of the past in our villacie, 
The valleys, the rivers, and rosy-check'd 
The lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet, placid waters are bright as of yore ; 
And often I 
think I 
am walkin9, beside you, 
And talking of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Ah! I'll go back, etc. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So, darlincr, be ready to welcome me there ; 
I 
look for the day when we'll fix for the wedding, 
The marriage that makes us the happiest pair. 
The lark and the cuckoo will greet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay; 
And Barney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love, 
be soon on the way. 
Ah 1

No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, • 
No Briton bolder 'midst danger or sear;

His eyes twinkling love, and he's gone to the war.

The dull screaming owl shall cease its night's sleep,

The war is all over, and my love is not returning,

dear Irish maid.

YOU'LL SOON FORGET KATHLEEN. 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
[The circumstance, which gave rise to this beautiful ballad, occurred 
during the visit of a 
friend of the author to the north of Ireland, and 
was most feelingly related to the author by him. 
It was the parting of a 
young tenant- farmer from his betrothed, on going to seek his fortune 
in some distant land.) 
Oh! leave not your Kathleen, there's no one can cheer her, 
Alone in the wide world, unpitied she'll sigh: 
And scenes that were loveliest, when thou wert but near her, 
Recall the sad visions of days long gone by! 
'Tis vain that you tell me: you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more: 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh I 
Oh I 
leave not the land, the sweet land of your childhood, 
Where joyously passed the first days of our youth, 
Where gaily we wandered 'mid valley and wildwood: 
011! those were the bright days of innocent truth! 
'Tis vain that you tell me; you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll 
on forget Kathleen, Bud Erin Go Bragh!

Ah, ! botheration, dear Ireland's the nation 
Where man every joy upon earth may obtain, 
Where with hospitality. conviviality, 
Friendship and open sincerity reign ; 
Sure I've roam'd the world over from Dublin to Dover, 
But in all the strange countries wherever I've been, 
I 
never saw an island on sea or on dry land 
Like Paddy's own sweet little island of green. 
CHORUS. 
The sweet little island, the dear little island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little island of green. 
In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward ; 
But shure for its beauty an Iiishman's duty 
'Will teach him his own nai lye. plant to regard ; 
St. Patrick he set it, with dew-drops he wet it. 
And often to cnerish and bless it was seen ; 
Its virtues are rare, too, it's fresh and it's fair, too, 
And blooms but in Ireland's own island of green. 
The sweet little island, &c. 
A sprig from each stem forms a 
rich varied gem, 
More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn, 
Together unalighted, unsullied, united, 
It blooms a 
bouquet beauty's breast to adorn ; 
Oh ! long may they flourish, may heaven's dews nourish 
Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen; 
May no fatal blunder e'er tear them asunder. 
But long be they wreathed in the island of green. 
The sweet little island, &.s. 
Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireland, 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun ; 
For honor, for spirit, fidelity. merit, 
For wit and ,rood fellowship, frolic and fun ; 
With wine and with whiskey, when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen, 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native island of green. 
The sweet little island,

Sin was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left thee in sorrow, a 
tear in my eye; 
Thy hills of pure em'rald, the pastures and plain 
Are sights, darling country, I'll ne'er see again; 
A 
heart full of sadness. a 
heart that was sore, 
Was mine when I 
left thee to see thee no more; 
But visions of all that I 
left there behind 
Are flitting so sweetly at times thro' my mind. 
CHORUS. 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left thee in sorrow, a 
tear in my eye; 
A 
country I've found that gives shelter to me, 
America, truly the land of the free. 
Iffad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
And sad were my feelings when Norah did cry; 
I 
felt her, sweet jewel, a- waving her hand, 
As the ship shot away from my dear native land. 
She stood on the cliffs till the dark of the night 
Had shut the fast- sailing craft out of her sight; 
Then to her small cabin she went, well I 
know, 
And wept did my darling, because I 
would go. 
Sad was the day, etc. 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
But hard I 
will work, and much harder will try 
To bring the dear creature, the sweet little dove, 
My Norah, to this, now the land that I 
love ; 
The Irishman finds here a 
friend that is true, 
The Green waves aside of the Red, White, and Blue; 
And all from the Emerald Isle of the sea 
Find welcome in this, the real home of the free.

Oh, love, let, eta. 
Oh, love, may a

That has not as yet felt the least little trace ; 
May days ever joyous roll on till their close,

None half so bewitching as Maggie McKay.

THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD.—[CONCLUDED.] 
All, all are gone—but still lives on 
The fame of those who died— 
All true men, like you, men, 
Remember them with pride. 
Some on the shores of distant lands 
Their weary hearts have laid, 
And by the stranger's heedless hands 
Their lonely graves were made ; 
But, though their clay be far away, 
Beyond the Atlantic foam— 
In true men, like you, men, 
Their spirit's still at home. 
The dust of some is Irish earth,— 
Among their own they rest; 
And the same lanJ that gave them birth 
Has caught them to her breast ; 
And we will pray that from their clay 
Full many a 
race may start 
Of true men, like you, men, 
To act as brave a 
part. 
They rose in dark and evil days, 
To right their native land ; 
They kindled here a 
living blaze 
That nothing shall withstand. 
Alas! that Might can vanquish Right,— 
They fell and passed away; 
But true men, like you, men, 
Are plenty here to-day. 
Then here's their memory—may it be 
For us a 
guiding light, 
To cheer our strife for liberty, 
And teach us to unite I 
Through good and ill, be Ireland's still, 
Though sad as theirs your fate; 
And true men be you, men, 
Like those of Ninety-Eight.

BOWL.1) .SO.TER BOY. 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowld. Sojer Boy; 
'Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe, 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowl(' Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march thro', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry My eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bowld Sojer Boy 
But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout, 
While to tne right about goes the I3owld. Sojer Boy. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is -,11 before us, where the landladies adore US, 
And ne'er reins, 
score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy.' 
Then come along with me, Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with 3 
our Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, ' twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the I3owld Sojer Boy. 
And tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of E•ur mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line he'll 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy.

NO IRISH NEED APPLY. 
(New Version.) 
As sung by COTTON and BIRDUE. 
IN 
the papers have you read, 
Have you noticed what they said, 
That no Irish people need apply 
To earn their daily bread? 
'Twill plainly show to you 
The course you should pursue; 
And in honesty I'll show you 
What you really ought to do. 
CHORUS. 
On this you may rely; 
You will find out by-and-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny Isle 
Are welcome to apply. 
Just note the Irish girl, 
As she's skipping to the well 
on her cheeks 
With blossoms blooming 
Like roses in the dell; 
She is so bright and fair, 
With her jet-black eyes and hair— 
Show me your English lady, 
Who a 
brighter name can bear! 
Never let me hear that cry, 
As 
I 
heard in days gone by; 
(1) 
NO IRISH NEED APPLY.—Concluded. 
That cruel, cold, unpleasing one— 
No Irish need apply! 
On the plains of Waterloo, 
Where the bullets like hailstones flew, 
There was the Duke of Wellington, 
Bad luck to him ! what did he do ? 
He beat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the Irish won their part. 
CHOBTJS. 
Faugh-a-ballah ! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-and-by. (Repeat.) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a 
bite or sup 
Wherever there you go; 
So don't treat them with disdain, 
But show each. man the same! 
Let all apply, that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come! 
CHORUS. 
Then rise them as you should— 
For ' tis fit we all do good, 
And never crush an Irishman, 
But rise him as you should! (Repeat.)

THE GALLANT BRIGADE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. TT 
I—T ARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cent. 
Copyright, 1S70, by E. li. HARPING. 
W E'RE a gallant brigade from Erin's isle, 
And many a 
fight we've won; 
We'.11 dance a 
step or take a 
smile, 
And our comrades never shun ; 
When dress'd in regimentals, 
Sure of none we are afraid 
And we are known where'er we go 
As men of the gallant brigade. 
CHORUS. 
The gallant brigade is never afraid 
To meet a 
friend or foe; 
We're sure to make a 
grand hurrah, 
Wherever we may go— 
With trumpet and gun we march away 
In a 
beautiful parade, 
And we're so proud we charm the crowd 
To cheer for the gallant brigade. 
We're first in the field, all brave and true, 
If war should call us out ; 
And when we're home we pass our time 
In showing the girls about; 
I've often heard them sigh and wish 
That they could be arrayed 
In uniforms of blue and green 
Like those of the gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, ete. 
On the Fourth of July and Patrick's Day 
We're out in glorious style, 
While the stars and stripes and Ireland's flag 
Above us wave the while; 
The glories of this nation then 
In fancy are displayed, 
And at night we drink a 
parting glass 
To America's gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, etc. 
THE BELLS Or SHANDON. 
Composed by FATHER PRO17T. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
T 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sound so wild would, in days of eliiia.00k 
Fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, (A' thee, 
-With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
Tye heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate t 
But all their music spoke not like thine! 
For mem'ry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free, 
lade the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
Tve heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole in--
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
But thy sounds were sweeter than the dome at 
E"ctbe 
Yang's o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly— 
Oh! the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Xoskeb, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud in air calls men to prayer, 
From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
&eh an empty phantom I 
freely grant theakt 
But there's an anthem more dear to me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound more grand on 
Tke pleasant waters of the river Lee I

" 
ST. PATRICK'S DAY IN THE MORNING." 
From the CLIPPER. 
TILE noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order; 
A thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border; 
Arrah! but the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly dressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast, 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she couldn't resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och! sure but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey! 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Devil a 
bit do they care for that 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator; 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning; 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island; 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you a 
whack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning."

HARDING. 
THE regiment is forming now, 
The ranks are nearly tilled; 
For valor and for victory 
Our hearts are always drilled ; 
All Irishmen unite with us, 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or (lie like soldiers 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line— 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment that waits the bugle's call 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall ; 
Of raging war or cannon's roar we have no fear at all ; 
We'll march away to glory in the Irish Regiment. 
We'll show our Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do 
In the armory or battle-field 
To duty we are true ; 
When marching on the gay parade 
We are the nation's pride, 
While the stars and stripes and Erin's flag 
Are flying side by side ! 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc. 
The cause we serve is liberty, 
And we're a 
valiant band— 
Some day we'll see the tyrants fall, 
And freedom in our land ; 
But far away we now must stay, 
And be with hope content. 
While marching on to victory 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc.

LET ERIN REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD. 
BY Tom Moonu. 
Am.—" The Red Fox." 
LET Erin remember the days of old, 
Ere her faithless sons betray'd her; 
When Malachi wore a 
collar of gold ;* 
Which he won from her proud invader, 
When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd, 
Led the Red-Branch Knights-J
. to danger, 
Ere the emerald gem of the western world 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
On Lough Neagh's bank f 
as the fisherman stray; 
When the clear, cold eve's declining, 
He sees the round towers of other days 
In the wave beneath him shining ; 
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpse of the days that are over; 
Thus, sighing, look throuffh the waves of time 
For the long faded glories they cover. 
* " This brought on an encounter between Malachi ( the monarch of Ire-
land in the tenth century) and the Danes, in which Malachi defeated two 
of their champions, whom he encountered successively, hand to hand, tak-
ing a 
collar of gold from the neck of one, and carrying off the sword of the 
Book 9. 
other, as trophies of his victory."—

of Irel

I., 
t" Military orders of knights were very early established in Ireland ; 
long before the birth of Christ we find a 
hereditary order of chivalry in 
Ulster, called Curaidhe na Craoibhe ruadh, or the Knights of the Red 
Branch,' from their chief seat in Ernania, adjoining to the palace of the 
Ulster kings, called Teagh na Craoibhe ruadn, or the ' Academy of the Red 
Branch;' and contiguous to which was a 
large hospital, founded for the 
sick knights and soldiers, called Bron-bhearg, or the ' House of the Sorrow-
ful Soldier.'"— O'Hulloran's Introduction, etc., Part I., Chap. 5.

Which Connor carried in battle, 
During his frequent wars for the expulsion of foreigners.

had been originally a

was inundated, and a

strangers the tall ecclesiastical towers under water : " Piscatores aqua)

The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells ;

Its tale of ruin tells.

There is just complaint among teachers and parents who take an interest in 
the culture of youth, because of the very few books that exist containing first 
class Dialogues for two or more speakers. 
Most of this class of books are 
mere repetitions of books printed scores of years ago; while others omit all 
old ones, however good, and fill their places with weak, wishy-washy pieces 
merely because they are new. In this series the aim has been to select the
