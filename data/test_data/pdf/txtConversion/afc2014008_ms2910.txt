Email from Jackie Steiner  (MTA Song)  to Tony Saletan
 
November 30,  2009
 
Dear Tony,
 
Yes,  it is sad news indeed.
 Bess was a great lady,  and
 
she changed my life.
 When I went to her house on
 
Shepard Street in Cambridge that first time,  I had no
 
knowledge of folk music, but wanted to help out  in the
 
progressive causes the group was involved in.
 But of
 
course,the group did much more than that.
 Under Bess's
 
gentle tutelage, the  pickers and singers explored
 
American folk music,  had fun singing so  many songs,
 
and composing words to others for specific occasions.
 
I think it was that first time that Bess,  in her clear,
 
haunting  voice,  sang, unaccompanied, the Kentucky
 
Moonshiner song.
 I was
 "blown away."
 
Of course, our collaboration on the MTA song was
 
important,  and,
 through the efforts of Peter Dreier
 
and Jim Vrabel,  has taken on new  life.
 But
 
the contribution Bess made to folk life in this country
 
is
 incomparable.  She made that contribution in so many
 
ways, big and  small,  and touched the lives of so many
 
people.
 
I remember her telling me how she held hands with Ray
 
Charles when they both received the Congressional Arts
 
Medal in 1993.
 
She held many hands,  and we are all grateful for her
 
legacy.
 
Jackie

Dear Naomi,
 
I' m writing to offer my heartfelt condolences on your mother s passing.
 
Bess was a wonderful treasure of our Northridge campus,  and she has left

I just heard the news about Bess's passing.
 I
' m so sorry.
 
I just got into Portland last night and had planned on making a call
 
to see how she was doing.
 Last time I was here I know she was feeling
 
a bit weary -
 she gave so much in her lifetime.
 I will be in touch
 
later,  but if there is anything I can do for you all while I
' m in
 
town,  please let me know.
 I
' m here until Tuesday.
 
My love and hugs to all of the family.

Fellows,
 
Publore is reporting the passing of one of our Fellows,  Bess Lomax Hawes on
 
November 28 at the age of 88.  For biographical information,  see
 
http://en. wikiDedia.org/wiki/Bess Lomax Hawes. Folklorists will remember her as
 
first director of the Folk and Traditional Arts Program at the National
 
Endowment for the Arts,  a post she held from 1977 to 1996,  when she retired.
 
She wrote books and produced films on children's games,  African-American lore,
 
and folk music.  In 2008,  the University of Illinois Press published her
 
autobiography,  SING IT PRETTY:  A MEMOIR.
 
Sincerely,
 
Simon

Hi.  This long, past week,  I' ve tried to send you reflective  articles you may
 
not get elsewhere,  which cover a spectrum of  themes  likely to affect the
 
broad public,  political  and otherwise.
 Today' s, on students,  is one such.
 
It may be too radical for some,  but is very reminiscent of the Free Speech
 
Movement of  1964, at Berkeley,  which quickly morphed into the broad,
 
anti -Vietnam War movement,  energized the Civil Rights movement, the
 
various  'Power'  movements,  the Women' s movement,  Environmentalism,
 
and much more. It merits  great  attention.
 
But first, a sad note  from friend Frank Hamilton,  one of the most creative,
 
talented musicians  I' ve ever known,  about the passing of our teacher,  Bess
 
Hawes. I say amen to his brief eulogy and add that Bess,  Pete Seeger and
 
Woody Guthrie  formed the Almanac  Singers,  the role model  for the Weavers,
 
Peter,  Paul  and Mary,  and many others.
 Her daughters,  Naomi and Corey,
 
called me  from occupied Wheeler Hall  in  1964,  where they were part of  that
 
action of  the Free Speech Movement, asking the Ash Grove to organize a bail
 
benefit. Likely  leading the  singing. Fruit of  the tree.  Bess  graced our
 
PS.
 I now see another great woman, Alice McGrath has died. 
If  you
 
don' t know who that is,  you should.

Great  sadness  here. 
No Bess  Hawes, no Old Town School of  Folk Music.
 She
 
was brilliant.
 Just as important as  her brother,  Alan Lomax in the field of
 
folk music and anthropology.
 She introduced me to traditional folk music
 
like no other did and I owe my teaching skills to her.
 
Just got this  off  of Mudcat. 
What a real  loss to  folk music!

Dear Susan and Drew,
 
Cot
 
•
 D
 
I don't have your phone number and haven't had any luck with  "white pages"  on the
 
internet,  so here is an email.
 As you no doubt suspect from the subject,  Bess died
 
yesterday afternoon,  very peacefully and quickly.
 She had been at Thanksgiving
 
dinner just the night before and had enjoyed herself but was tired.
 I got a call
 
the next day from her caregiver at 1
:00 p. m.  asking me to come over -
 she was
 
nonresponsive.
 She had been talking to them just an hour before,  and while very
 
weak and unable to sleep the night before,  had seemed normal.
 Nick and I got right
 
over there and we all decided to get her to the hospital via ambulance -
 she was
 
sitting upright with her eyes closed,  breathing a little labored,  and normal pulse
 
and blood pressure -
 however,  her pupils were dilated and nonresponsive.
 At the
 
hospital she was examined and the doctor explained that she was well along in the
 
process of shutting down -
 no pupil response,  cold extremities and slower
 
breathing.
 She looked totally at peace and within about 30 minutes she was gone.
 
It was just as she had hoped it would be -
 quick,  uneventful,  and totally without
 
intervention.
 For the past two years,  each time she went into the hospital,  she
 
would tell me that she had lived a wonderful,  rich and fulfilled life,  that there
 
was nothing that she had wished she had done but hadn't had a chance,  and she was
 
ready to go whenever it was time.
 She still took the opportunity to enjoy every day
 
even as her capacity to participate diminished.
 The past couple of months I felt
 
her quality of life had significantly declined,  and I sensed that she was really
 
ready to leave.
 She spent her days in her chair dreaming and day dreaming and
 
always up for a chat but with difficulty finding words.
 Yet her long-term memory
 
was excellent -
 just the day before Thanksgiving,  she recited the entire plot of The
 
Garden of the Plink,  her favorite childhood book,  to Corey and discussed the various
 
characters.
 
We are planning a small get together at my house here in Portland for Sunday
 
afternoon,  December 6th at 3:00 p. m.- just for the family and the few local Portland
 
people who knew her.
 We are assuming that eventually something will happen in LA
 
and something in Washington in the fullness of time.
 But for now,  Corey's kids want
 
to gather and my kids want to gather,  and there are a few of Bess's old friends in
 
the local area who might want to gather if they are around,  so we thought we might
 
just go ahead and spend the afternoon singing and telling stories.
 We have no
 
expectation of family coming from afar -
 as we are very aware of all the good and
 
loving reasons why it isn't possible -
 but of course,  everyone is welcome and the
 
more the merrier.
 Anna has told me that she will likely come.
 It would be nice to
 
see all the family at some point before too long -
 maybe we can figure out how to
 
have a family get-together in the future.
 
Susan, your love and support was very much appreciated by Bess in her final years.
 
Your boxes of books and chocolate sustained her,  and the family news was read and
 
reread each time you sent a letter.
 She felt very lucky to have had her sister and
 
you and Pat in her life.
 
All the best
 
Naomi

Fellows,
 
Bill Nicolaisen shares  a reminisce below of  Bess Lomax Hawes  and I have also
 
attached a link to an obituary in the Boston Globe  (with a photograph of Bess
 
from her Almanac Singers days).
 
Boston Globe obituary:
 
http://www. boston.corn/bostonqlobe/obituaries/articles/2009/12/O1/bess  1 hawes  folklorist co wrote the mta/
  
This  is  sad news  indeed.  She was  a wonderful person and scholar.  We became Fellows at the same time and
 
whenever we met  (which was mostly at conferences)  addressed each other as  Fellow Fellows.
 
She was a great mediator,  and the AFS benefited much  from her negotiating skills.
 
All the best.  Bill.

Fellows,
 
Note some responses to my posting concerning the relation of the NEA to public
 
folk arts and Bess's involvement.  I might suggest that since we have several
 
witnesses to history among the Fellows, we might want to have a retrospective
 
panel at next year's AFS meeting and I also invite any printed reflections to
 
the journal THE FOLKLORE HISTORIAN.
 
Sincerely,
 
Simon

Yes, Alan is correct.  I posted a reminiscence of Bess to the P
tJBLORE list a
 
couple of days ago,  and also put it up on my blog on music and sustainability;
 
and there I mentioned that Alan was the first director.  Please tell the Fellows
 
if anyone wants to see what I wrote about Bess they can go to:
 
http://sustainablemusic.bloqspot.com!
  
Best,
 
Jeff
 
Simon,
 
Folk programs fell in what was internally called  "special projects"
 
in the early years,  meaning they were not considered a permanent part
 
of the NEA.
 That status changed after Bess took over the program.
 
She considered herself the first director of the permanent program,
 
and I agree.
 I had a small hand in the politics that helped create
 
some of that change,  and I recall a House Appropriations Committee
 
hearing of that time when the Chair,  the late Sidney Yates of
 
Chicago,  spent perhaps a half hour chatting with Bess in the hearing,
 
revealing Sid's considerable knowledge of the field and his huge
 
respect for Bess.
 So among the several matters that made Folk Arts a
 
permanent program at the NEA was the good work of Bess in many
 
places,  and her friendship with important members of congress.
 The
 
current chair of House Appropriations,  David Obey of Wisconsin,
 
shares our love and respect for Bess,  and our sorrow at her loss.

Bess would say t

ather t

Remembering Bess Lomax Hawes
 
What
's Your Reaction?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes, who d
ied F
r
iday a
t 88, t
aught t
housands o
f people how t
o p
lay t
he guitar. She d
idn'
t
 
have a
 v
ideo, o
r a
 TV s
how, o
r a
 website, o
r even an i
nstructional manua
l. She had a
 t
echnique.
 
I
n t
he l
a
te 1
940s, s
he and her husband Butch were l
i
v
ing i
n t
he Boston a
rea and s
ent t
heir t
hree c
hildren t
o a
 
c
ooperative nursery s
chool o
rganized b
y g
raduate s
tudents a
t M
IT and Harvard. She f
requently b
rought her
 
guitar t
o t
he s
chool t
o perform f
or t
he s
tudents. Some o
f t
he parents, mostly t
he mothers, a
sked her t
o t
each
 
t
hem how t
o p
lay guitar, banjo and mandolin. Bess agreed t
o c
harge t
hem one dollar each f
or each l
esson, which
 
l
asted s
everal hours, what s
he called "
a whole evening." She would k
eep 50 c
ents f
or herself t
o pay f
or a
 
babysitter and s
he'd donate t
he o
ther 50 c
ents t
o t
he n
ursery s
chool. Word s
oon s
pread, and o
thers began t
o
 
j
o
in her c
lasses.
 
That was how Bess developed her t
echnique f
or t
eaching guitar t
o l
arge g
roups o
f people s
imultaneously, a
 
method f
or which s
he became well-known, and which accounts f
or t
he f
act t
hat over t
he y
ears, e
specially a
fter
 
s
he moved t
o Los Angeles i
n 1
951, s
he was able t
o t
each s
o many people t
o p
lay guitar. Many o
f her s
tudents,
 
i
n t
urn, became guitar t
eachers, s
preading her method -
 and h
er enthusiasm f
or music -
 which helped c
atalyze
 
t
he f
o
lk music r
ev
ival o
f t
he 1
950s and 1
960s.
 
Bess f
i
gured, s
he t
o
ld me i
n an i
n
terv
iew t
wo years ago, t
hat "
students l
earning guitar i
ndiv
idually can get
 
i

timidated because t
hey can hear t

istakes. I
n a g
roup, t

eel bolder about p
lay
ing, t
ake
 
more r
i
sks, enjoy i
t
 more, and f
eel part o
f s
omething b
igger, which s
ounds better, anyway."
 
Throughout her l
i
fe, Bess was a
lways i
nvolved i
n "
something b
igger," t
ypica
lly s
preading appreciation f
or
 
music, and p
rogressive polit

As W.H. Auden once wrote about t
he I
r
ish poet Yeats, "
Earth, r

a

s

Where t

Bess: S
ixty years ago, i

ong s
he and her f

written-the MTA Song:

He p
ut t

Went t

The song was r
eally about another man-a man named Walter-
