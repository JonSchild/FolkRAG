PRETTY LITTLE BLACK EYED KITTY, 
ORIGINALLY BUNG BY HOGAN & HUGHES. 
I 
promised I 
would meet her here at eight, 
The hour is past, it's getting late, 
And yet she is not here, my pretty little dear, 
Oh! why don't she come, my pretty Kate. 
It cannot be she means to deceive me, 
The very thought it grieves me, 
Last night at the gate, she said be here at eight, 
And I 
will be waiting for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! pretty little black-eyed Kate, 
So loving and so sedate; 
(Break.) 
She promised she would have no one but me, 
She'll be mine 'tis very plain to see, 
The world to me is black eyed Katy, 
When she's mine how happy I 
shall be. 
I've been walking with my pretty little Kate, 
And kissed her last night IA the gate, 
She promised to he mine, if I 
would set the time. 
I 
set down next Sunday for the date. 
And then I 
shall lead a 
happy life, 
With pretty Katy for my wife; 
Next Sunday at nine pretty Katy will be mine, 
The happiest day in all my life.

I

And tell you one and all who I 
is; 
rm well known to the lady that I 
board with, 
As the wench that's known as Alabaster Ltz. 
The reason why they call me alabaster, 
Is because I 
ought for to be as white as snow; 
And then I'd take the shine out of all wenches, 
That tries to beat me with this heel and toe. 
Criones. 
I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7— or steps to fill up the time, 
That's the way I 
sling my heel aad toe; 
Oh I'm Alabaster Liz from old Virgine, 
And you bet kin known wherever I 
may go. 
I'm up to every mischief you'd imagine, 
For I'm the wench that's always full of fun. 
I'm as spry and as lively as a 
cricket, 
And forty miles a 
day, too, I 
can rnn, 
rm the finest cook there is in masters kitchen, 
No matter how the other cooks may blow, 
I 
can knock the stuffin out of any chicken, 
But I'm best at slinging this here heel and toe.

As o'er the trotting course one day, 
My horse was quickly gliding; 
I 
met a 
gay and pretty blonde 
In a 
pretty phaeton riding. 
I 
quickly threw a 
kiss at her, 
Which caused the boys to stare, 
I 
noticed as she threw it back, 
She'd a 
ribbon in her hair. 
Cnonns. 
Oh! goodness gracious, me, 
But wasn't she nice; 
Her hand I'm bound to gain 
At any price. 
(Break.) 
No un- 
tter be she rich or poor, 
All dangers I 
will dare, 
I'm bound to win that charming girl, 
With the ribbon in her hair. 
I 
quickly turned my horse around, 
My former ground retracing; 
Away we flew, and soon I 
found, 
That this girl was with me racing, 
The fun began in earnest now, 
A 
mile or more was run, 
When she sang out defiantly, 
Come and catch me if you can. 
I 
said all right, my pretty lass,. 
SOOn be with you tripping; 
If you will give me one sweet kiss. 
While we o'er the track are skipping. 
Says she come on, and in a 
trice, 
I'd passed her on the square; 
I on the kiss from that dear girl 
With the ribbon in her hair.

(lent. 
Two weeks ago while at the beach, 
I 
met my little dear, 
Forget her that I 
never can, 
But I 
wish that she was here. 
'Twas bathing where I 
met this girl, 
On one tine summer's day, 
And from that time I've been her beau, 
And oh 1 
I 
feel so gay. 
Cnoaus. 
I 
met her at the beach while bathing, 
1 
ne'er shall forget that happy time, 
And I've asked her for to be my darling, 
And she Las promised to be mine. 
She. 
I 
met a 
chap while bathing, 
At the beach some time ago, 
I've promised to be his for life, 
For he loves me I 
know. 
He is a 
charming nice young man, 
And has a 
splendid name, 
I 
think it's called Robert Charles, 
Augustus Henry Vane. 
C HORUS, 
I 
met him at the beach while bathing, 
it was the happiest moment of my life, 
And since then he calls me his darling, 
And I've promised to be his wife. 
Gent. 
Why there's my little darling now, 
I 
wonder why she's here; 
She. 
Why bless my heart if that ain't 
My own darling Willie dear. 
Gent. 
Good-evening, miss, will you take a 
walk, 
Now with me I 
beseech, 
She. 
Oh ! yes, dear sir, but I'd rather go— 
Gent. 
Where ? 
She. 
Bathing on the beach. 
Both. Oh! yes, I'll go with you a 
bathing, 
Won't we have a 
splendid jolly time, 
Oh! yes, I'll go with you a-bathing, 
Be. 
For you have promised to be mine, 
For you know that I'm forever thine.

my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn,

When first my arm she took,

Was ringing o'er the meadow; 
And I 
culled a 
rose you may suppose, 
To give my charmer fair. 
So we'd gaily chat while her Gipsey bat, 
Half bid her face in shadow. 
But when e're I

They shone like diamonds there; 
She's as pretty as a

And you never miss the sun whenever she

If you saw her, you'd adore her, 
She's as pretty as a

mons 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so low, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport 'twas cupid caught, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
told her so as I 
turned to go, 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she drooped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you " an revoir." 
She's as pretty as a

And my heart's a

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
BY CIABABBLL. 
MUSIC BY ST'EPH:ra ADAM. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her Lair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
lngel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A- de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-do, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
•A-de, A-de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
same a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to bear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away- the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-do, A- de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountaina, 
Seem to watch and w it alway.

Far across the deep blue water,

Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason, 
Why I

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that sc well suits 
my notice. 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is great. 
Alas I 
the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyrauic aggression. 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom, 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them. 
They'll belong to the country of brave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home my poor heart was 
breaking, 
Oh ! '
tis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and the honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh! that causes the stoutest of hearts to unbend. 
But there are occasions when partings a 
pleasure. 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure, 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free.

With tho roof all covered with moss, 
Where the grunt of the pigs in the morning, 
Kept harmony with the old boss'. 
When a 
child we were fed upon praties, 
But now we've rose to manhood's estate, 
We are known on the street by each one that we meet, 
As the " Cariaey's," Pat and Dennis so neat.

We come from Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the lads and lassies on the Jaunting car ride, 
We're Pat and Dennis Carney from the lakes

In the land where the apple praties grow. 
In a 
steamship we sailed 'cross the ocean, 
To better our fortunes you see, 
But divil a 
bit of luck have we had here, 
We're as wretched as wretched can b.. 
We sigh for the turf-pile so cheerful, 
When barefoot we trudged it afar, 
O'er mountains and hills, cross valleys and rift 
in the land of sweet " Erin go bragh.'

And my master would then point me out to the men,

So upon his birth-day he set forth.

He learned the game of faro. 
So he thought he'd try his luck, 
When he lost every cent the boys all cried.

So I

And to thank ye for yere welcome to a

I

job of work, 
Since I

But my work is attended with great danger,

One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation.

Oh I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I

But for your ancestors, like you,

While He values thrones the highest,

A 
cottage neat I 
saw; 
A 
maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so swect, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said. 
That made my heart feel good.

Oh ! she's the sweetest flower here,

A 
purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and Tank 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " Yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my vas, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alms, 
With my rose perfumed bouquet.

little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played ' neath the turnpike gate.

For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our mew, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
"Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

Dance. 
The boys took iny advice 
And they mostly voted twice, 
And that's Lb t

They s- d 
I'd be defeated, 
But tuy plans were dl complertted, 
So I () tiered a 
me for the a,s. ci.ttion, 
They said it was the plan to run rue for Alderman, 
Because of my ell /
lei jar education, 
I 
commenced my demonstrati ,m., 
By dating out potations, 
And soon all my arrangements were effected, 
For as cunning as a 
fox, we stuffed the ballot box, 
ettjtd that's the reason why I 
was elected.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY N1GHTf 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LUM. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
to yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
el:Lorca, 
rll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mirk 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single -life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love sore& 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm; 
To walk by the ride of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy lo harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
go rarer or mortgage the ! arm. 
CHORUS. 
it's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
how painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our proteetion, 
For lie was so kind when a 
boy; 
And Betsey so gentle au d 
loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But 
he was led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harts ; 
dud left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's bard to be ii veless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from berm 
We only can suffer in silence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

BRIGHT EMERALD ISLE OF THE SEA,

Was ever yet seen in the frame of the sea; 
bright emerald gem in which nothing is wanting, 
To show what a 
jewel of earth ought to be. 
Wherever we wander thy memory we cherish. 
Whene'er from our vision thy shores may depart 
There is not a 
tint of thy verdure can perish, 
So deeply each hue is engraved in our heart. 
Oh Erin, dear Erin, a'midst gladness and sorrow, 
For thee have we mingled the smile and the tear. 
When darkest the night, we have known 
that the morrow. 
With rays that were brightest was sure to be near. 
Thy welfare. dear Erin, forever we'll cherish.

There is a 
little fellow, who no doubt you all have seen, 
And Charley is the charmer's Christian name; 
re dresses in the fashion, with a 
bright neck-tie 
of green, 
And to tell the truth he never looks the same. 
ills hair he curls quite nobby, and his moustache 
waxed to kill, 
He's gotten up expressly for the day; 
Be stands upon the corners, but really can't keep still, 
And should you chance to meet him I 
am sure 
you'd say—

Charley he's a 
masher, Charley he's a

Charley he's a

He's the object of attention from all the ladies fair, 
And when he's out on promenade you should 
see them at him stare. 
Be attends all the theatres, and seems perfectly at home. 
Has invitations to the parties, balls, and fairs, 
He's a 
sort of privileged character and is always 
seen alone, 
He seems to run the gauntlet everywhere, 
lie's polished in his manner, in a 
la-de-da sort of way, 
But how he lives I'll leave it all to you, 
Ton couldn't help but notice him he always looks so gsy. 
Nu a

SAVE MY CHILD. 
Words by Dr. Theo. D. C. MiIler, Music by W. Warren Bentley. 
When the Steamer Seawanhaka was burning, a 
mother s 
amid the flames, clasping her little child with a 
dying grasp, 
bolding it over the vessels side as far from the flames as possible, 
though fatally burned and exhausted, and knowing that her lass 
Lour had come, she held her darling one, and in pleading accenta 
cried, " Save my 
child !" 
One of the heroes of that hour, and one 
whose deeds will not soon be forgotten. 
31R. JOHN HENRY BOSH, of 
Harlem, N. Y. went to the relief of that agonized mother. Rowing 
his boat close to the vessels side, he succeeded in 
the 
chil 
li d 
ave, from th e 
dying 
grasp 
of 
the mother. 
Ills own person 
!wee 
severely burned, and although suffering intensely, was able to reS, 
cue twenty-one others. The mother died immediately after nal 
rescue, and her darling one in two weeks.

Save my child,- for I 
am dying, 
Cried a 
mother, soft and low, 
Where the young and old were lying 
in that hour of gloom and woe. 
When Seawanhaka was burning, 
Drove its hundreds to the waves ; 
And that mother's heart was yearning 
O'er the child her deep love eaves. 
CHORUS. 
Save my child, so low and thrilling, 
Came that plaintive cry again, 
As a 
hero brave and willing, 
Sought her side through fire and pain 
I 
As a 
hero brave and willing. 
Sought her side through fire and paiL, 
At the vessel's side she lingers, 
Robed in fierce and cruel flames, 
Holding with her burning fingers 
Firmly all her fond heart claims. 
"Save my child !" if I 
must perish, 
For my hour has come I 
know, 
But this dear one you will cherish, 
Tell me, stranger, ere I 
go. 
Fast the !grangers boat is nearing, 
That lobe mother and her child, 
Through the flames he rows unfeeling, 
Though it seems an act so wild. 
"Save my child !" and as she grasps it, 
That strong mother's love is o'er, 
With the grip of death she clasps it, 
And on earth she pleads no more.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer. 
In the asure-tinted sky; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
GO 
among the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with pais, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er our winsomP Winnie Wane.

One summer morn while rambling 
Down through the fields so green; 
Where hawthorn blossoms gently blow, 
I 
met Alice Aileen. 
,,6o flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of Heavenly blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through. 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers; 
(Break) 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Break.) 
it's there I 
love to roam, 
With her my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, 
My sweet Alice Eileen. 
In a 
shady nook far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
crystal falling stream, 
Oh! what a 
happy hour. 
'Tis there she whispered, 
rn be thine, I 
love, I 
love but thee; 
And murmured low, when we are wed, 
So happy I 
will be.

We now claim your kind attention 
To what we're going to do; 
In form it is quite pleasing, 
And in manner it is new. 
So graceful and artistic, 
With the music soft and sweet, 
The heel and toe we'll introduce, 
In our peculiar style so neat. 
CHORUS. 
Listening to the music, 
Those strains they're such a 
treat; 
So now we'll execute for you, 
In our peculiar style so neat. 
In dancing there is pleasure, 
For it drives dull care away; 
A 
pastime of our boyhood, 
When the heart's both light and gay. 
Our school-mates used to watch us, 
And smile but with conceit, 
To see us both amuse ourselves 
In our peculiar style so neat.

Just look at my eye, you will see that I'm fly, 
I'm a 
man of influence and great education; 
I've studied in college, I've a 
great deal of knowledge, 
Of things as of they go every day. 
I 
never play cards, I 
smke no cigars, 
Unless they are " Henry Clay;" 
I 
never use slang like the rest of the gang. 
For it would not suit Alderman Fay.

Alderman Fay, tral-a-lal-la, 
I

Alderman Fay, tral-lal-la, 
I'm one of the genuine stock, ha, ha! 
If you get into a

I 
will go see the judge and make it all right; 
For I 
have the pull, I 
am like a 
sea-gull, 
I 
am flapping my wings everywhere, 
In Albany, on the committee, 
Of course I 
take command; 
They come to me, and speak to me, 
And give me a 
shake -of the hand. 
Sure President Grant is married to my aunt, 
I'm a 
distant relation to Henry Ward Beecher; 
I 
wear a 
pin on my breast, it is Tiffany's beet, 
It was presented to me t'other day. 
By a 
committee from Tammany 
To which I 
do belong; 
The girls all say, I 
carry the sway, 
And they s•.re mashed on Alderman Fay.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the early morning, 
Summer d
4zy is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secnre, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing,

When the magnolias bloom. 
We'll live together in a

Love shall there abide, 
Surrounded by the sweetest of magnolias,

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
rye a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CIIOIMS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bboys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you cicn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
A, —first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och 
murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day.

Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right /welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

You may think i 
hat I 
ant mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The remon I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy I)oyle, 
And I 
brought her to Conty Isle to have some tau 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the whi/e. 
Put if I 
lad to do it again, 
Ehe would mver go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile. 
'I hey all did wave their hat; 
And shouted " doat her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier. 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with Parnutn's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang commenced to guy Us, 
My bosom was on tire. 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
, 
Beheave us" shouted out, (
Chortte 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feel mad, after listening so that lad, 
Of course be thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet, your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter 
But I 
ean tako my own part all the while. 
Arrah-musha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Before I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
