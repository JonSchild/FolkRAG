Sarah Filkins: This is Sarah Filkins, Interviewer, speaking with Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA 
[Fellow American Institute of Architects], LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design] Fellow on Monday, February 17, 2020, at the offices of Long Green Specs in Baldwin, 
Maryland.  Good afternoon. 
Anne Hicks Harney: Good afternoon. 
SF: 
Thank you for agreeing to share your story as part of the Library of Congress Occupation 
Folklife Project funded by an Archie Green Fellowship. So let’s begin. If you could just state 
your name and year of birth, your full name. 
AH: 
My name is Ann Hicks Harney and I was born in 1963. 
SF:   
And if you could please describe your current job responsibilities and… 
AHH:  I am Long Green Specifications, or Long Green Specs. I write architectural 
specifications which is sort of the big, thick book that goes with the architectural contract 
documents. So architects, we all think they draw, and they draw but they also have to choose 
materials and then you have to detail what the materials are, and where they come from, how 
they’re installed, the specifics, the requirements about the materials. So what I do is I do material 
research, sustainability focused material research, as well as writing architectural specifications.   
SF: 
And when did you first become interested in architecture or aware of the built 
environment? 
AHH:  I decided I was going to become an architect when I was nine. I think it was because I 
like to draw but I liked—I wasn’t really very—I wasn’t like a person that would be able to go out 
and just draw a tree. I used to like to color in like, graph paper and make drawings. And so I 
figured since they were straight lines that I should be an architect not an artist. And my mother 
was adamant that both of her daughters do some sort of scientific field so she didn’t know what 
to do with architecture. So she sort of, I think, she thought it was scientific enough, to pass her 
requirement for no one was going to college to study Chinese literature, cuz there was no money.  
You know, you couldn’t get a job. So her thing was we need to get everybody a job. So that was
—architecture met that requirement. So there you have it. 
SF: 
So did you know any women architects at the time or did you know any architects. 
AHH: No. No, I just decided, I guess I knew enough that architects drew straight line and so I 
figured that—I could do that and that seemed interesting so that’s that. It’s a silly reason but we

all need a reason, there’s my reason. But I am weird because I did know when I was nine that I 
was going to be an architect and I was going to college visits to sort of see who could do 
architecture. And my other friends had ideas but and I wanted to be an architect and my other 
two friends wanted to be a veterinarian and neither one of them actually ended up going to vet 
school but I ended up becoming a licensed architect so, you know. And I sort of stuck with it, I 
mean I haven’t changed. So you know. 
SF: 
So when you were in high school did you lean towards drafting classes or anything like 
that? 
AHH: There was one drafting class I took so I did do that but you know I was sort of on—in 
high school, I grew up in the Midwest.  I was born in England but I grew up in the Midwest as 
you can tell from the accent. I immigrated… 
SF: 
In Iowa? 
AHH: No, this—I grew up in—I graduated from high school in Minnesota. So it’s not East 
Coast. Both of my boys just graduated from high school in Maryland and it’s crazy—how many 
AP classes can you take?  How many colleges are you applying to?  It wasn’t really like that so 
but I was obviously on college track and so for college track you took the following four math 
classes, you took the following four science classes, you took the following four English classes, 
you know, it was just—and I did all that. I made the decision not to take the human biology class 
because I knew I wasn’t going to go into health care. But other than that I was in the same 
classes as all my other friends. We all had—we got all the way to pre-calc—we got, you know, 
standard earth science, biology chemistry, physics. You just, you just took, you know, a line 
which isn’t that dissimilar from what my kids did at the high school here but there was not any—
our high had an engineering program and there was nothing like that at the high school I went to 
but I also went to—I graduated from high school in 81, so…you know, it was a while ago. 
SF: 
So you were then looking for colleges that had architecture programs? 
AHH: Yeah, I was looking for colleges that had architecture. So I went to Iowa State because I 
don’t know why but my mother didn’t want me to go to University of Minnesota. It doesn’t make 
any sense but there it is. So I went to Iowa State and I remember it wasn’t that expensive. It 
wasn’t like now. You would never reject University of Maryland for UVA [University of 
Virginia] because it’s four times as expensive. But back then it must have been twenty percent 
more expensive. I don’t know, any ways, but I went to Iowa State. I did that. It was a four year 
degree. There were—basically even now there’s usually one college in every state that does 
architecture, maybe there’s two. But there’s not seven. It’s not like getting an accounting degree 
that you can get in every college in America. So an architecture degree, it’s more like an 
engineering thing. There’s not a lot of colleges, you have to go to the big state schools 
[00:05:00]

typically to get it and so my choice was North Dakota, Minnesota or Iowa so I went to Iowa—
Iowa State not “University of” didn’t have a program. 
SF: 
So you got your bachelors then? 
AHH: I got my Bachelor of Arts in Architecture at Iowa State and I think my mother was tired, 
my parents, my mom and dad were tired of paying for college so I left and I took four years. I 
worked for four years and then I went back to grad school. 
SF: 
And you—two of those years, you worked for Michael Graves. 
AHH: Yeah, I worked at a small place. The first thing I did was I worked work for Peter 
Lokhammer who was the first project architect for Michael when he did his—he bought a 
factory, that pink factory that’s in Princeton, and he renovated it a number of times and the first 
time it was renovated, it was renovated by Peter Lokhammer who used to work for Michael, who 
was an architect who never got licensed. He was a licensed engineer cuz he had an engineering 
degree. I worked for him for two years and then I switched and went to work for Michael Graves 
for two years and then I applied to and got into UVA [University of Virginia] and I went there. 
SF: 
What was the impetus to go back to school, to graduate school? 
AHH: I had decided that I had four years in which to get back to school so when I finished three 
years I knew I had to apply for—I’m very linear, I’m very check it off—so, and the impetus to 
go back to school, the reason to go back to school is you can’t get licensed unless you have a 
professional degree which is either a five year degree, a Bachelors of Architecture, or you need a 
four plus two—you need a master’s degree. So I could have stayed at Iowa State and gotten the 
fifth year but like I said, my parents were tired of paying for college so I decided I was going to 
do a masters degree so I went to UVA. I had a whole bunch of places I applied. I got into fifty 
percent of them, UVA was one of them so I decided on that. And it was a great school and the 
reason, the impetus for going was so I could become a licensed architect.   
SF: 
But that was quite a switch from the Midwest to the East Coast both in working and 
going to school. 
AHH: Yeah, it was because I remember when I moved—cuz I moved very close to Princeton 
and I can remember standing in Princeton, New Jersey and being astounded that there were three 
Mercedes Benzes in a row, because—on the street parked—because that was like, there was a 
Mercedes or two in Minnesota but not that many and you’d never see both of the Mercedes 
parked next to each other. That would never, ever happen. So it was really, it was pretty weird. It 
took a while to get used to but I think back on it now and it doesn’t occur to me. But my husband 
and I talk, my husband grew up in [New] Jersey—and I’ll say things to him like, “You don’t—
this is not—this is how the Mid—let me explain how the Midwest works.” So and it’s just, it’s 
different but you know every place is different, so. I find the East Coast far more accepting of

Women Architects, afc2019/031

people because the Midwest are so stuck. In the Midwest my parents who are British and have 
British accents, my mother is still with us, the people used to make fun of them in Minnesota for 
having the British accent. And it’s like really, you have free time to make fun of somebody with a 
British accent? Like that’s cute. And it was always—that’s sort of—but that’s standard midwest. 
They’re just not really accepting of people that aren’t like them. So if you’re a different, you 
know, look, listen, feel, you know, religion, it doesn’t really work super well. Here it’s more 
accepting, I think, because we’re just used to people coming in and everyone’s from somewhere 
else. So you’re just kind of more used to it. So, anyways. 
SF: 
So when you went to UVA then did you have a vision of what you wanted to do—I want 
to open my own firm eventually—I want to focus on design or more technical.  Did you know 
then what you… 
AHH: I think when I was at UVA—I think when I was at UVA I was thinking about doing a 
masters degree, I was thinking about doing a thesis project in craft, like how you build because I 
was really starting to be interested in sort of the craft of how we put things together. But I’ve 
always said I was far more interested—I’d rather design a chair than a city—so I was always 
much more interested in smaller rather than big, huge stuff. I’ve never worked at big corporate 
America. The largest firm I’ve ever worked was one-hundred seventy people. And some of these 
firms are like, you know, five-hundred to a thousand people. I’ve never worked at one of those 
kind of places nor have I ever really had an interest. And before my last job, I worked—every 
one I worked at—was less than forty people so I was always more—well, Michael Graves was 
larger than that but generally even he was only sixty or seventy, it was never even over one-
hundred people which is pretty small in the architectural world. But I was thinking I was going to 
do—I was going to study something that it was about sort of smaller and sort of the how of 
building. And I think by the time I got through four years of working I pretty much knew I 
wasn’t going to be a star designer. So I knew—and you know the good thing about going and 
working for a couple of years before you get your masters degree is you have a better feel for—
you kinda know what you’re doing. When you’re in school getting a bachelor’s degree you’re 
like, just imagining what it’s going to be like, so I pretty much knew what I was going to do and 
I figured I would probably be doing the technical stuff of figuring how to put buildings together 
which I found pretty interesting. 
[00:10:00] 
SF: 
Did you have any big take-a-ways from your first four years other than you needed to go 
back to school?  I mean after working for Michael Graves—that’s a pretty interesting office to … 
AHH: It was interesting and it was fun and it was, you know, its was—what are my take-a-ways 
from working with Michael? I don’t know. It was just more—you know because I was already in 
that whole Princeton—I worked in that Princeton, New Jersey community. So I was already 
going and going—you’d go to the Princeton University architecture lectures and you’d hang out 
with your seven friends who all are at various architecture offices around and you’re talking and

Women Architects, afc2019/031

you’re listening so it’s sort of you learn—you learn as much in the evening talking to your 
friends as you do at work. And hearing what’s going on and hearing all of the different stories. 
But you know I, at some point, I got tired of working for designers because I think after, cuz 
after I finished grad school and I looked for a job for six months, and I found a job with Kieran 
Timberlake and it’s funny because I took the job with Michael Graves to put it on my resumé. I 
took the job working with Kieran Timberlake because I needed a job, and they were the first—
they weren’t the first guy—they were the second guy that offered me a job. The first guy just 
wasn’t a good fit. But they weren’t famous yet and looking back on it now, I say this to people 
all the time, what looks better on my resumé and it’s clear, it’s Kieran Timberlake. But after 
working for Michael and then for Kieran Timberlake it was clear to me I was done working for 
designers because it’s just a hassle and there’s these weird things that I never understood.  
 
When I was at Kieran Timberlake we were working on this project that was an underpass 
at Villanova University. So Villanova University is on these main two roads and they’re both four 
or five lanes in each direction, you know five or six lanes with the turns, the turning lanes, and 
they had to get students from across the road because the dorms were on this side and the 
university’s on this side. And so I remember talking about this and Steve Kieran explaining why 
they were doing this. And I remember him saying something like, well you know at night—cuz 
this was, you had to walk—they were doing an underpass—you had to walk underneath easily 
six lanes of highway traffic—not highway—high speed you know, traffic light but forty-five 
mile an hour road and he said, “Well you can go through there at night.” and I said, “I would 
literally crawl on the chain link fences along the side of the road before I’d walk under there at 
midnight cuz I’m a woman and I don’t want to get attacked.” And he sort of looked at me like—
in the meantime we were designing the wall that went along this underpass and I must have 
worked for six months on how the wall would look. This was a stone wall or stone looking wall 
and it was probably as tall as fifteen feet tall and it was probably three-hundred feet long. And I 
spent six months on should it be a two foot by three foot piece of stone, should it be a three foot 
by six foot piece of stone, should we put stripes in it that are twelve inches tall? And I remember 
at the time thinking, Who has money for this? I mean, I wasn’t making much money but really, 
still, six months. And I remember just thinking, this is so silly—this—I can’t even make an 
argument for this in any way, shape, or form. And I mean, it was great, those guys are great, 
they’re so skilled. I mean they’re very successful and they have this very thoughtful practice. I 
was at a meeting in the last couple weeks with one of the people, one of their principals and 
they’re still doing great work, they’re doing amazing research, I think the world of them but 
honestly it was like, I can’t do this. Because this is silly so—and they’ve kind of moved on from 
that sort of stuff—any-who—and that project was never built because I think a lot of people 
figured they would actually rather crawl along the chain link fencing than go through that dark 
area at midnight. Any-who, I think what I learned from working for all these famous people was 
this high design is just not really for me. I’d rather kind of work five days a week and get things 
done and watch buildings go up and kind of see and get—and you can do some great buildings 
and when you’re not in that sort of heavy—spotlight’s on you, limelight—it’s a little easier to 
sort of, I mean, you can do some interesting things and you can, I mean, make some real changes 
and it’s more interesting, for me.

SF: 
So did you sort of gravitate then towards, I think I’m interested in specifications or doing 
construction documents? 
AHH: I worked after—so Michael Graves—I took two years to go to college, I came out, I 
worked for Kieran Timberlake—did that for a year and a half. And also I was living in Maryland 
and working in Philly [Philadelphia] cuz I came out of grad school in 91. There was a recession 
which was why it took forever to find a job and so—and there was—the drive was exhausting. 
And my husband at the same time was covering a larger territory so we would literally come 
home and say what do you want to do tonight and I’d be like, “I don’t care.”—a Friday night—“I 
don’t care. I just don’t want to get in a car.” So we actually had a sailboat 
[00:15:00] 
and we were living on the Chesapeake Bay so we used to get on the boat every weekend and just 
sit because we just didn’t want to get in the car.  
 
But I gravitated to regular firms, not like name brand firms—and I tried—I just was 
enjoying learning the craft and figuring out how to do this and manage projects and watch things 
get built. I locked onto spec writing because my husband and I went to Block Island in 93, 1993, 
and it was such a wonderful place. Block Island is in the line—Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, 
Block Island, right—so it’s an island kind of in the middle of nowhere, you get a fifty minute 
ferry ride so you—my husband and I were like how can we live here. And the only way you 
could live there is if you could do something that you didn’t have to go to work every day so I 
kind of came up with this idea that I could be a spec writer cuz it’s interesting and it’s a technical 
focus and then I could live on Block Island. So, that was when I came up with the idea of 
SpecAnne which was my working title for—which there was a reason for that but never mind it’s 
not important—but it was a stupid title. But so that—I came up with the idea for SpecAnne 
because I can do my own thing and do this. And then in 98 I had my first child and then I had a 
really, really good reason to not want to go to work everyday. So I thought more about it and then 
when I had my second son, I ended up after he was born—no, I switched to Ayers Saint Gross 
which is the last place I worked for somebody else, in—when my older son was about a year and 
a half. And then I had my second son and it was a situation where my daycare provider couldn’t 
take him so I decided it was easier to just take two years off than it was to try to work the 
daycare thing out. And my husband and I decided that we could probably afford it and I also 
figured it would probably be easier with two. So I took almost two years off and then I went back
—I went and I literally quit my job at Ayers Saint Gross, and then I—the day I decided I was 
going to call them and say I’m ready to come back to work, I called my old boss and he got on 
the phone and said, “Oh, are you returning my call?” I said, “What?” He said, “I just called you 
two hours ago.” So the day that I decided to go and ask them for a job again, was the exact same 
day they called me to say, “Hey, are you ready to come back to work?”  So, I always tell women, 
you can quit your job and take a couple years off and truly—a. nobody knows I did that. I used to 
say to people, “Did you know I took two years off for kids?” “No.” “Well, see you could do the 
same thing and it wouldn’t matter.  It still will be fine.” So I went back to work and now I had 
two kids and that was more complicated, etcetera, etcetera. So the instant that I heard that the

Women Architects, afc2019/031

spec writing position at Ayers Saint Gross might be available, I seized it. And it just worked out 
that I knew what I wanted. I told my boss, “This is my dream job.” And he said, “Okay, I’ll keep 
that in mind.” And then a month later the spec writer quit and—I’m in. And so I became a spec 
writer. And of course people were like, “Oh, thank you so much for helping.” And I said, “No 
problem. No problem.”  And I just, I’ve aways thought it was funny because they think it’s this 
serious, “Oh, I don’t know how she can do that.” And I’m like, I don’t know how you can’t do it 
because you’re missing out. It’s really interesting. It’s really fun and I don’t have to show up 
everyday. 
SF: 
You could work from home? 
AHH: I work from home. 
SF: 
Before people even really did that. 
AHH: Yeah, well and I always—once I had the kids, I always, I said I was going to go back full 
time and then my oldest—both my kids were in the hospital for three days. If you have a fever of 
more than like ninety-nine when you have—you’re under three months old—they throw you in 
the hospital, do spinal taps, do all kinds of tests, you know, plug you into IV antibiotics and sit 
and wait. And the reason they said that is that we have poor outcomes sometimes when we have 
this so we over react because we don’t want—you know, of course we all know what the poor 
outcome is. So, any ways, I’m the only person in the world this has happened to her for both of 
her children. But it happened with my first one and it really freaked us out so I wasn’t really 
going to go back to work and then I had daycare and I wasn’t sure about that and it was okay. It 
was working but—so I always—I just got in the habit of three days a week. And once you’re in 
that habit for six months it’s kind of hard to break out of, so I stayed in it. But then once I was a 
spec writer, after about a year of that, I realized, I don’t really need to be here three days. I could 
be here two days a week. And I would show up at literally like seven a.m. and I would stay until 
four. I mean, it was a long day. And when I was home I would work but not having to go to work 
means you can—if your kids are sick, you can still get some work done. You don’t have to call in 
sick. And if there’s an event you can go to the event and if—sometimes you need to work late. 
But the thing about—anytime—because I’m basically functioning as a technical writer for my 
office, I would walk—I would walk the studio floor once a week and check in 
[00:20:00] 
with everybody. What’s your deadline, what’s happening, what are you doing?  Da-da-da-da-da 
and so I would avoid—my deadlines were never daily and hourly—they were always weekly and 
monthly. That wasn’t always true—they weren’t always—they were almost always—sometimes 
it didn’t work out.  But typically I could keep my deadlines to more weekly and monthly which 
means you can—if you know you have something going on Thursday you can work longer hours 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so you have it met so you don’t have to stress out on Thursday. 
But if you’re—I was never directly dealing with clients, I was directly dealing with project 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
10
managers in my office who were dealing with clients. So I didn’t have the—craziness that comes 
from—cuz you know if an owner has a situation like—the executive vice president of the 
university told him he wants it now—the guy that you’re dealing with is just going to call you 
and say, “I need it now.” And it’s not really his fault. It’s the executive vice president’s fault. But 
that’s not your problem. You have to—your client’s telling you he needs it now so you have to sit 
and stay late and you know, and do what you need to do to get this done. But I avoided a lot of 
that because I was—the situation was controllable and I was able to control it. But I’m also very
—I’m very organized. And I have all my buckets and everything’s in the buckets and I know 
where they are. So, and I still do that. And so you sit and you figure out that you can make this 
work. But it did mean, I mean—that firm raised my children. It was great. 
SF: 
So when it gets out to all these young women that you can balance it if you go into 
technical writing… 
AHH: Technical writing, yeah. I’ve tried, I’ve tried. And I have firms still—I’m talking at the 
AIA which is the American Institute of Architect’s Convention in May and I’m taking about, I 
think my topic is Specs Are Fun. Let’s Get Them Done. Right? And I’m going to spend five 
minutes on this. And I was on a call with a potential client last week and they said,”Well, we 
need some help for spec writing.” And I said, “I can’t. I’m too busy. I don’t have time. I can’t 
add new clients. I apologize.” And I said—I told them, “You know what you should do? You 
should figure out all the young women in your office or young men. Anybody who’s a parent, 
who you kind of know wants to be more hand’s on. And tell them, “Here’s the deal. We’ll get 
you a laptop. You’re going to be the technical writer. We’ll let you work two days from home.  
Monday and Friday you can be home. You’ve got to work. And I’ll—you know, you have to—I 
mean I had a situation where I had an employee. That went poorly because the employee—I 
don’t know what happened—but I believe that she just simply stopped working. So you have to 
watch it and you have to be sure that you have an honest individual on your hands. But I saw this 
entirely as, I have the best gig ever. I’m not letting this go. So I’m not screwing this—I’m not 
missing any deadlines cuz the minute you start missing deadlines then you’re going to get called 
home. Then you are going to be like, you’re going to have to stay home, you know. But it was 
just, I don’t know, so to me I don’t get it. But every single firm I talk to has a terrible time 
finding spec writers, without—without a single exception. And I tell them, I mean, I was at a big 
firm—one of my clients is a big firm in Texas and I said—told them what he should do. He said, 
“We just can’t…” and I think he—I was looking—all of his spec writers were boys, I think he 
probably wasn’t asking the girls but I don’t know, I told him,”You should hit up all the young 
women in your office that are just either having babies and sit them down and explain to them. 
Let me explain…”  And then some of them said they don’t—they don’t want people to work at 
home. They need to work in the office which is, you know, you should probably get over that but 
whatever. It worked for me. But some of this is you gotta find your own way. There’s a lot of 
things you can do if you take control and manage them.  If you do a good job everyone’s going 
to hire you. Right?

SF: 
Right. Well could you explain a little bit more about when you would interface with a 
project from the beginning all the way through construction and probably occupancy but I mean 
were you working with the… 
AHH: Well let me talk about what I do now because it’s the most recent. So for the last two and 
a half years coming around to three years, for about the last three years I’ve had my own 
business so I now am a specification writer and a material researcher for architects. So an 
architect hires me. I either work all the way from schematics all the way through construction 
documents. So schematic design is the early phase of design where you are trying to sort of 
figure out what shape the building is, and where it sits and how big it is and how big the rooms 
are. So you end up at the end of schematic design with floor plans and elevations and a couple of 
sections through the building and maybe a couple of renderings, you know pictures, drawing of 
how it would look on the outside. And maybe a couple of interior views of say some—maybe the 
lobby—the public spaces. And then design development is the middle stage and that’s where you 
basically figure out, you draw a lot more and then you kind of figure out what everything’s made 
of. And then construction documents is when you draw it and the drawings are good enough that 
you can hand to a contractor and they can use the drawings to build the building. So schematics, 
design 
[00:25:00] 
development and construction documents. So then schematic design—a lot of times I’ll help 
them choose materials and they end up with maybe a fifteen page long document that is all the 
listings of what the materials are going to have in the document. And they need that. That way 
the contractor can price it. Because typically at the end, you get pricing three or four times 
throughout the project so the client knows you’re on budget. So if you have either a narrative you 
write or a sort of base line specification that I would write that tells—that gives them enough 
material information so they know how to price it. Oh, you want this kind of brick?  Oh, you 
want this kind of ceiling system? Oh you want wood floor here and just resilient floor over here? 
Oh, you want carpeting here? And that way they can, that way they can assign prices based on 
what the materials are. In design development, I typically draft the full length spec. It runs about
—it’s probably about a thousand pages. It’s pretty detailed and it basically then again gets them
—gets everybody a document they can now work with so the contractor can price. But the 
architect, we now will sit and go through it and say, “Okay, for this section I said you want this. 
Do you want this? Do you want this? All right, are you going to, you know…” And then we kind 
of go back and forth because it’s really hard to describe everything you want in your building. I 
try to interview them more and I tell them, “You don’t have to read it. Schedule an hour and a 
half long meeting with me and I will go through the entire thing and I will ask you all the 
questions I need, plus while I’m talking to you about the wood flooring, that’s when you can 
remember. Oh, did we tell you the stairs are wood too? Oh, did we tell you we want wood on the 
walls cuz you know, the word “wood” makes you think, oh I forgot.” So we work through all that 
and then during the construction document phase we just finesse it and finalize it and make it 
work. I also get questions—the next kind of phase is bidding where regardless of how it’s being

Women Architects, afc2019/031
12
done, whether the project is being bid to a whole bunch of contractors or whether there is a 
construction manager that’s been hired by the owner and they have—and then there’s some 
finessing. There might be finessing like, okay wait, something changed. This is ten percent over 
budget so now we gotta go back and forth and figure out how we’re gonna fix that. Or it might 
just be you’re asking for bids and then you get the bids. But there’s always questions in the bid 
phase. And then at some point the owner says, “Ready, set, go.” And the contractor starts. And 
then during construction they realize, I know you said you wanted this wood flooring but it’s not 
available or else, you guys thought it was three inches wide and it’s actually six inches wide 
which is going to make it look different. Is that what you want? And then there’s all these back 
and forth that go on about availability, how it works, and just also you always get contractor 
preference. I like this water proofing system, and they don’t say it this way, Oh this water-
proofing system that won’t work, which usually means, I like this one. Can we please use the one 
I like? And but then—and so I am—once we get to construction I am talking to them very 
infrequently but if they email me and ask me a question, I respond and we work through these 
things. And, but my clients ask me, they’ll ask me—questions about specifics. Like I have one 
client that I just finished final CD’s [construction documents] for so we’re at almost done. And 
they’re asking—they said, “Oh we want to add a library ladder, like you know, one that we 
would put on a bookshelf and roll back and forth.”  And they said, “Do you have a suggestion?” 
And I replied, “I don’t have a suggestion for library ladders but if you go to this resource…” And 
it’s a website which I use a lot that has a lot of materials and there’s like sixteen different 
manufacturers so this person can now sit and click on all these different links and they can look 
and decide which one looks good. I mean, and you know—and then I—sometimes people will 
say well, you know, “Which of these do you like?” And I’ll say, “I like this one.” Or that one and 
you know, we go back and forth but library ladder’s kinda weird so if I hadn’t done a library 
recently that needed a ladder, I wouldn’t know but you know, so. But that’s sort of the back and 
forth that I—I do a lot of interviewing of them so that I can figure out what I need. And then I go 
back in and I run through my document, just because I can do it really fast and I know that 
everyone’s busy. So if I can get through this with you in an hour and a half and that means you 
didn’t have to review it yourself, I think most people appreciate that. “Oh, that was relatively 
painless. I mean it’s not really super happy to sit and listen to you talk about specs for and hour 
and a half but it’s better than me having to review it for six hours.” So, so that’s kind of how the 
process works. 
SF: 
Well has the profession changed a lot with the now emphasis on material transparency 
and healthy materials and green buildings? 
AHH: Yeah, I sell myself on sustainable materials because that’s sort of—that’s a sort of 
secondary level of expertise but I always tell people, “I’m never going to tell you that you should 
clad your building in lasagna because it’s less toxic.” Because the first thing we have to do is 
make sure the cladding on your building does the job it’s supposed to do. So 
[00:30:00]

the roof has to be waterproof and it has to be able to carry the warranty you need. And the walls 
have to be able to look good, and to not fade and to keep the water out and etcetera. So the first 
thing we do is hit a performance requirement. After we’ve done that then we start looking at both 
the environmental impacts and the health impacts. And the environmental impacts mainly are the 
embodied carbon which is how much carbon was used in the sourcing, manufacture, transport, 
installation of the building, getting it from start to in-your-building finished. And then the health 
impacts have to do with toxicity or what the ingredients are of the product. So basically looking 
at a materials list of what the thing’s made of. If you think about—if you think about going to the 
store and buying cereal you turn the cereal over and you’ll see a list of ingredients and you’re 
looking, you know, you’re looking for no sugar. You’re looking for healthier materials. That’s 
like material ingredients. That’s the health impacts of a building material. And then when you’re 
looking at performance aspects—calories, that’s kind of like embodied carbon. That’s like, or—
and the environmental—I mainly think about environmental impacts from carbon but there’s also 
water impacts, you know, and—and other kind of things that are tracked. But that’s all the 
calories and the protein, that’s sort of the environmental impacts. And then the list of things that 
make the product are the health impacts. And that’s how—but they also, they all cross over. I’m 
putting together a presentation that we’re thinking about doing—a friend of mine, are doing—
about how embodied carbon and the toxicity are kind of linked and trying—because it’s really 
hard when you’re choosing materials.You gotta decide, What’s more important to me — the 
environmental or the toxicity? And its—you gotta kind of come together.  
 
Like for instance—the most—steel and concrete are the two really bad products for 
embodied carbon. Portland cement, it actually creates carbon. Concrete when it forms, everyone 
thinks it’s drying. It’s not. It’s a chemical process. It’s curing. So the Portland Cement is reacting 
with the water, the sand and the aggregate and it’s bonding in a chemical fashion to create 
concrete which looks like drying but it’s actually a chemical foundation. But the act of doing that 
causes carbon so there’s carbon coming out of that. But also Portland cement is heavy carbon 
because of how it’s pulled out and how it’s changed. So we want to get rid of—to make lower 
carbon concrete we want to get rid of as much Portland cement as possible and replace it with 
something else. The great thing to replace it with is fly ash. The problem with fly ash is it’s a 
secondary product of the coal—coal fired power plants. It’s basically the refuse that ends up on 
the chimneys that leave as the coal is burned but it’s full of mercury and other toxins. So you 
want to take fly ash which is super toxic, replace it with Portland cement that lowers your 
embodied carbon but it raises your toxicity. So you’re sort of stuck with “I don’t wanna”. But 
embodied carbon’s bad too because there’s toxic results of having the carbon content go up 
because we got climate change and all this other stuff that happens in the climate crisis we’re in 
right now. So there’s always this balancing act and they’re so many times when low carbon 
equals higher toxic—not like super toxic, “Oh my God we’re all going to die tomorrow toxic,” 
but you just—you want to try to balance it. And it’s not really typical to find perfection so it’s not 
really typical to find a low embodied carbon and super low toxicity. So it’s—everything we do is 
kind of a grab bag and a bit of a mix and so we’re just trying to find our best result right now and 
encourage better results. And discourage worse results. So that’s what we do all day is we cut 
deals with ourselves to try and improve what we’re doing.

SF: 
And if you have a client who wants a particular, let’s say they want a LEED Gold or 
Platinum or Silver [certification] or whatever so then are you working also with the designer, the 
architect, to help guide them towards materials or …?  I mean, are they pretty open usually to 
learning about—more about materials that they should use or not use? 
AHH: Well it depends because if they’re trying—you know, I have discussions with teams all 
the time and it depends, cuz you have—I have—I’m probably working right now with about 
fifteen different architects. So this architect over here is only using mineral wool on the outside 
of their building in cavity walls. So in a standard commercial building you’re going to have a 
structured wall which is usually made up of steel studs. Then you’re going to have 
[00:35:00] 
a board on it which used to, in the old days, be plywood but now it’s glass matte sheathing, right. 
And then you’re going to have an air barrier and then you’re going to have a layer of insulation 
and then you’re going to have some sort of Z-furring, like the Z shaped clips that might be three 
inches deep and then attached to that, is gonna be a cladding system. It might be a metal panel. It 
might be a thin concrete panel. It might, hopefully not, be a plastic laminate panel but sometimes 
it is. There also might be brick out there that is tied back not with the Z clips but tied back with a 
brick tie. But all of that, basically all of that has a cavity behind it that is where insulation runs. 
So about ninety-five percent of my clients do mineral wool because it’s a less toxic product and 
it has good insulation value and it’s a high quality product. About five percent of my clients still 
want to use a board insulation of foam. It’s like a poly—a polyester—no not polyester—a 
polystyrene. Polystyrene is styrene—is you know, it’s—it’s the oil industry and the embodied 
carbon on that product is way higher, way higher than the mineral wool. The toxicity is way 
higher but we’re not so worried about the toxicity because it’s outside the building. You don’t 
want the toxicity in your building. When it’s outside the weatherproofing barrier which is going 
to be that sheathing board and the air barrier, now the stuff out there isn’t as big of a concern for 
toxicity as it is inside. Which is why we don’t get so concerned about the roofing we use being 
made of oil based products because again, the roofing is outside the weatherproofing barrier, it is 
the weatherproofing barrier. It’s out, you know it’s. But when—but some, I try, right now I’m 
trying with my one client—I have one client specifically who still wants to use foam on the 
outside of the wall and I’m trying to convince her not to do that. When you go inside the 
building, it’s a lot easier to convince people because you can bring up their own children and say 
you know, it’s not healthy, it’s not good for you. But we’re trying to keep a lot of the, you know, 
so—but it’s—it’s tough because if this one client just wants to use foam because they’re just used 
to it, it’s hard to convince them. If the designer really, really, really wants to use this vinyl wall 
covering on the wall it’s hard to convince them not to, because it’s pretty. And that’s what they 
want it to look like. But a lot of this stuff I’m finding, like vinyl wall covering is a really good 
example—vinyl wall covering is really awful stuff. It’s PVC [Polyvinyl chloride]. PVC is 
terrible from a social equity standpoint. It’s all built in the southern parts of the States that ring 
the Gulf Coast. PVC is the last product in this country that uses a—basically what you do is you 
use—you basically use—you have to take salt water and you have to filter it to get the chlorine 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
15
out, to get the C of PVC. So they use asbestos filters which come in from Russia. So there’s two 
good reasons not to use PVC. You can stop buying things from Russia and you can stop using 
asbestos. It’s like the last reason we use asbestos in this country. And not the last, but one of the 
last. And all the people, the poor people that are working in the southern part of the country—
this is where it’s happening—and they’re working with asbestos filters. Now does that sound like 
a good idea to you? Obviously, the answer’s no. So and this—that’s PVC. It goes on forever. It’s 
also a crappy product. It’s plastic. It’s terrible so we try to not use PVC. So most people get that. 
The other thing about vinyl wall covering which is made of PVC, is that if you put it—it has no 
ability to let water through so if you put it on the exterior wall of your building and you’re in the 
South, you’re now putting a non-permeable surface on the cold side of your wall so there will be 
mold behind your PVC wall covering. It’ll take about two years because all the water vapor 
going back and forth is going to get trapped at that surface because as the air cools down it has to 
let water out and the air is going to cool down and the water’s going to get trapped behind that 
PVC wall covering you have. So all of my—all of my clients have rules about where they will 
allow PVC to be used. I was talking to a big client, they’re doing a lot of hospitality hotels and 
they’ve said, “We have a rule, cuz hotels need PVC and they need vinyl wall covering because 
it’s a hotel room.” They have to clean the wall and they say, “We only allow the PVC wall 
coverings on the inboard walls. The one’s that are on the outside wall—that’s the one that will 
get the mold behind it.” They never ever allow PVC. So sometimes you can get rid of the 
garbage products because they don’t work. And that’s the thing, is if you stick on performance 
you’ll win that battle every time. If you try to convince somebody based on some sustainability 
reason which they are able to roll their eyes and mumble to themselves “greenie weenie” then 
you might be fighting a battle you might not win. So I always try to find ways to talk to people 
about performance requirements and how this is going to perform better than that. 
[00:40:00] 
And the manufacturers that are doing the best work at getting their products fixed are the ones 
that are hitting it hard with performance requirements too. Not just—you know, you can express 
sustainability metrics in performance requirements. And when you do that you get more people 
on board. But it—I also, I get to select my own—I get to choose my clients—I get to say yes or 
no to clients. I don’t get to choose then, I get to say yes or no. So I haven’t yet had somebody 
who I knew was aggressively bad ask me to work for them. If I did I would just kindly, you 
know, defer, and say I couldn’t work with them but I haven’t had that situation yet. But I—it’s a 
little bit, when you’re your own person you can kind of—you get to pick and choose a little bit if 
you’re busy. Does that make sense? 
SF: 
Yes. So do you see the industries moving towards being more regulated or… 
AHH: Regulated no, because we all hate regulation cuz we’re all so smart. And we all know 
what’s right so none of us like regulation. This would be a lot easier if there was regulation 
because you could have—you could pass a law that said you can’t do this. And there’s—it would 
not be that hard to convince the American people that importing asbestos filters from Russia that 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
16
then are used by Americans to make things—probably we shouldn’t do that anymore. That 
wouldn’t actually be that hard to convince people but that conversation hasn’t even started 
because nobody likes regulation. And I say to people all the time,  It doesn’t matter who you 
voted for, please don’t tell me, but it doesn’t matter who you voted for, I’m pretty sure you’re not 
for regulation because none of us want regulation. None of us want more taxes, none of us want 
any—you know, in general we all kind of want—we’re so smart we want to do what we want to 
do.  
 
So we’re not in a regulation environment—what we’re trying to do—the sort of third 
party certifications, whether that’s LEED or Living Building [Challenge] or whether it’s meeting 
requirements. There’s a certification called GREENGUARD Gold which is about VOC’s 
[Volatile Organic Compounds] so how much things off-gas and a lot—it’s amazing. There’s a lot 
of regulations about VOC’s which usually you think about wet applied products so sealants, 
paints, but also hard surfacing products now get into that as well. But a lot of there’s—
specifically adhesives, sealants, paints, and coatings, all those four—the number of entities that 
have VOC regulations in those categories—my example is always Indiana and Utah have VOC 
regs. When the state of Indiana and Utah both have a regulation on something, I stop focusing on 
who has regulations because it’s a waste of my time now because I just say everybody does. So 
basically if you want to sell paint in this country you have to comply with what five years ago 
was labeled a sustainability regulation because it’s not a regulation it’s the Southern—SCAQMB
—Southern Coast Air Quality Management District, which literally, literally is LA [Los Angeles] 
and south. It’s not even all of California but that is the one, because they figured it out, and they 
put out a list and requirements which takes some time. Everybody just adopts it so everybody 
uses SCAQMB for—and there’s 1168 is adhesives and sealants and 1113 is paints and coatings. 
So Indiana has adopted it. So if you don’t meet that requirement, you can’t sell your paint in 
about half of the country, maybe three-quarters of the country if you think about it from a 
population standpoint.  
 
So some of this stuff is just becoming normal even though it’s not the law. Although, you 
know, it is kind of becoming, you know, but it’s just—and it’s—I think we can work locally to 
make these changes but I don’t think there’s any chance of the Fed coming in and doing any of 
this. I don’t even think if there’s an administration change, there’s necessarily going to be a 
change because you’s have to get the House, the Senate and the Presidency all in line and then 
you’d—and I mean, you’re talking about aggressively in line and I don’t think that’s going to 
happen. So what I’m looking at is—I’m looking at improving things just because it’s the right 
thing to do. And I think a lot of people are thinking the same way and also nobody reads my 
specs so truly—I say that to my clients all the time, “I’m going to put this in here and when you 
notice it and tell me to stop, I’ll stop. You let me know when you get to that.” And I never have 
had anybody call me and say—and this was in the—I’ve been doing this now since 04, so I’ve 
been doing this for sixteen years between my last job and now with my own firm. I have not ever 
once had somebody say, “You know, I saw this in the spec and you gotta get that out.” Never 
once. 
SF: 
Is there a country that is much more advanced than the United States that you look to for 
guidance? 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

AHH: You know, there’s other countries, like, well Europe, has the REACH [Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Compliance] System which is a much—
is a 
[00:45:00] 
really pretty good overall product requirement thing but I’m not sure that REACH is regulated in 
a way that you have to get to, you know, the highest level. I think it’s a leveled thing and I think 
they’re some minimums. But yeah, like I said, I don’t—there’s nobody really doing this because 
I think it’s, it’s almost like, it’s not a country it’s almost like a jurisdiction that would adopt it. 
There’s some really great efforts happening in California right now about clean stuff which 
basically that’s what they’re calling—California has a clean reg that says you have to have 
environmental impacts identified, which is an environmental product declaration, an EPD, and 
that would be on glass, on gypsum board, on concrete, and on structural steel. So four categories, 
but those are good because concrete and steel are the two that are really bad so the idea that you 
want to identify them, the state of Washington was trying to do that. There are some entities—
I’ve heard about single entities of some town in Ontario that made this requirement. They’re 
single entities if you’re smaller that are trying to get to that but I think that—I don’t think that 
there’s a country that’s doing it and I just think it’s really truly about what we’re all willing to 
live with. And I think it’s about trying to get the word out. I still remember, you might remember 
this, remember when trans fats was the thing and suddenly there was all this talk about trans fats 
and all the sudden they had to label them. I think my kids were like three and five. So I dutifully 
went to the grocery store and I’m turning over the food they’re eating and I’m looking. And I 
found trans fats in like, pudding. That was it. And you know, I stopped buying that brand. I 
bought this brand instead—no trans fats in it. You know, it took about three months to get trans 
fats out of all the pudding because there’s all this talk about trans fats and how bad they were—it 
took—it took three months. I mean, I’m sorry, we could get a lot of this crap out of what we’re 
building if we just talk about it. But you know, you have to get the right people talking about it 
and you have to get the word out. And I think it’s really hard to get the word out to a majority of 
people because there’s no real one source. There’s no Walter Cronkite. So—but I don’t know 
there’s, you know, I guess there’s ways—social media—I mean Beyoncé could do this for us. 
Maybe we should talk to her. I’ll put that on my list. 
SF: 
So is that why you decided to focus more locally with the—what’s the organization in 
Baltimore—the Building Enclosure Council? 
AHH: Oh, the Building Enclosure Council, I did that with a friend who I worked with, that was
—that was interesting because it was trying to find people to just talk about how extra your walls 
are made. I find it really interesting to talk about how the walls are made and how you’re going 
to improve the building. And that goes to building performance which goes to operational energy 
which goes to operational carbon. We’re trying as a—as an industry—the architects, are trying to 
find ways to lower carbon because buildings are responsible for 40 percent of the carbon. You 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
know, people think, Oh, it’s all transportation, and buildings are actually responsible for more 
carbon than transportation, mainly because we have operational, you know, how you heat the 
building, how you cool the building. But also embodied, all the energy that went into creating the 
products that you’re building the building of. So we’re all talking about that. The Building 
Enclosure Council really was specifically four or five years ago because we were so focused on 
operational and trying to improve that. It’s amazing to me the operational energy—it’s not that 
hard anymore to do a high quality, low operating energy building. Net zero—there’s now a net 
zero code that’s being adopted. Net zero is just not that much of a challenge anymore. I mean 
you’ve got to make an effort but it isn’t impossible whereas five years ago it was—nobody knew 
what to do. And I’m really happy about that because embodied carbon three years ago, no one 
could even figure out what it was and now there’s conferences specifically about it. There’re 
organizations that are working on it. I feel confident that we’re going to get embodied carbon 
sorted out in the next couple of years and we’ll really start to advance, to move forward and just 
improve the built environment. But that’s what this is about is improving our environment. And 
you know, you spend so much time in houses and buildings. It’s like, I don’t know, I like to go 
outside but it’s fifty degrees out there. Let’s stay in here. 
SF: 
Well are there some favorite projects you’ve worked on that were real learning 
experiences or—or just that you felt really great about what you were able to contribute? 
AHH: There was, let’s see—the first job I worked on for Long Green was a job called the—it 
was the Atherton Civic Center, which is in Atherton, California which is in Silicon Valley. And it 
was—it was the—it was a renovated—it was an old civic center which had this wonderful clay 
tile roof and then they were building a building next to it and then they were doing a library. And 
so it was two pieces. And it was really great. 
[00:50:00] 
It was the first project which sort of was—I have a soft spot in my heart—but it was working 
with WRNS [Studio] which is a firm in California and I mean it was just really—the woman I 
was working with, Eileen Ong, was really just, really just so on her—on top of her game and it 
was really a great collaboration. She asked great questions. I feel like we worked a lot of great 
stuff out and I think it’s going to be a really beautiful building. And then there were some 
funding issues. The firm worked all of that out. We got it back on track. And they were going—
and the town is going to get a new beautiful civic center which also had a little—it had like the 
county jail in it, or the town jail and I was like, I’ve never done a jail before. This is fun. And 
then the library was really pretty and it’s all clad in wood. It’s like one story. It’s really wonderful 
so it was just a nice project and it was my first project so it was kinda fun.  
 
When I was still at my last firm we did the Baltimore—University of Baltimore School of 
Law which won an AIA [American Institute of Architects] COTE Top Ten Award and it’s this 
great building and it’s a—Stefan Behnisch, it was a collaboration between Stefan Behnisch’s 
firm and Ayers Saint Gross. And it has—it’s all centered on this twelve story atrium up the 
middle and it was amazing because it was all exposed. It’s a concrete structure and all the 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
concrete was exposed. So there were all these—they had to really work carefully to get 
everything in the concrete. So it was a radiant piping system so they were piping hot and cold 
water through the slab so the slab was cooling or heating. So there was no forced air vents. There 
were no radiators around the perimeter of the building. It was all—well there were some 
radiation on some of the curtain wall but the concept was it was all radiant so you’d walk 
through and every single—the only thing that’s exposed inside is the sprinkler piping, everything 
was in the slabs. So it was amazing because before you poured the concrete you had to have 
everything in there. And then you poured the concrete and then it was too late. I mean the 
concrete’s hard enough—you know the concrete’s basically solid in twenty-four hours. You can’t 
walk on it but it’s solid so it’s too late. So if you put that in the wrong place, it sucks to be you. 
So, and it was this—and it was amazing because the way they finished it he used four different 
colors and they even had the paint—most of the concrete’s exposed. The floor was exposed and 
it was just this amazing experience to sit and watch. Wow, you can actually pull this off. And it 
was a great collaboration because the gentleman that I built the Building Enclosure Council with, 
Dan McKelvey, he worked on that job so hard. He was their best tech guy and he spent nine 
months just he—they were going through the documents just constantly making sure they were 
right. But the building is wonderful. It’s a great building and it won like the top AIA award, the 
COTE Top Ten. So those are sort of two—there’s a bunch of great buildings.  
 
There’s a bunch of fun buildings I’m working on. I’m working with Lake I Flato down in 
Texas. They do—their whole mandate is they do a lot of smaller stuff. They were—WRNS was 
the ARCHITECT 50 Firm of the Year for 2019 and Lake I Flato was the ARCHITECT 50 Firm 
of the Year for 2020. And I might have that wrong. It might have been 18 and 19. Two years ago 
WRNS was last year what Lake I Flato was. But Lake I Flato—so WRNS was the Atherton 
project—Lake I Flato does all this small scale work but it’s all real. They want real wood. They 
want real stone and it’s all a little smaller but they’re really receptive to improving the 
environment and using better materials. And they want to do better. They want to be sustainable. 
And Lake I Flato, I think has won more AIA COTE Top Ten Awards than any other firm or else if 
they’re not the top one, they’re the second. But they’re this amazing firm and so I like working 
on their projects as well. I did the Holdsworth Center which was a center for teaching. It must 
have been ten building, twelve buildings. I was losing track. So there were three that were 
housing, and there were two that were academic and there was one over here that was 
administrative and it was like—cuz, you know, I say to people all the time. They’d say,”Okay, 
well let me explain to you—this railing’s over here and this railing’s over here.” And I’m like, “I 
don’t—you’re on “where,” you’ve got documents, you’re drawing, you’re on “where”. I’m on 
“what” and “how”. So I’m going to make sure you have stainless steel and steel and glass to 
build your railing. I don’t need to know where the railing is. I don’t entirely need to know what it 
looks like. I kinda need to know what it looks like. But I really need to know what you need to 
make it of. So I’m on—I need to know what materials you need and make sure you provide all 
the materials.” So these guys had railings here, there, and everywhere and I’m just like, “Do you 
got any that are made of aluminum? No. All right, good. We’re good.” But that’s, you know, how 
when you’re on products, that’s how you think. 
SF: 
Quality control.

Women Architects, afc2019/031

AHH: Well quality control should make coverage too because it’s so—I always review 
documents at the seventy-five—fifty to seventy-five percent stat and I always come up with 
questions. 
[00:55:00] 
“Okay, what’s this overhead door? Didn’t I ask you about that?” I never say that, I say, “Okay, I 
see an overhead door. Talk to me.” “Oh, yeah, there’s an overhead door at the loading dock.” 
“Okay, what’s it made of? What’s the—whose door is it? Have you chosen it? What’s it made of? 
Manual or motor?” You know, cuz you look through their drawings and I’m like, okay, you’ve 
got wood on the floor over here and I don’t have any wood flooring so let’s—do you have wood 
flooring? Looks like it, pretty sure you do. So but it’s easy to forget because you can never 
remember to tell somebody everything. So it’s, to me it’s a question of sort of looking through 
what you’re doing and you know, seeing it and then sometimes I’m trying to convince you to do 
the right thing. I always [indistinguishable] on my teams. I prefer—I prefer a mosaic floor. You 
know the large format floor? Like the twelve [inch] by twelve [inch] floor’s okay. That’s okay. 
But they do twelve [inch] by twenty-four [inch] and twelve [inch] by thirty-six [inch]. I don’t 
like that look so I try to convince all the teams, “Can we do mosaic?” Sometimes I win and then 
I always say, “I’m so happy I convinced you do a mosaic floor.” But I usually don’t win that 
battle cuz usually the designer comes in with, “Let me tell you what we’re doing.” “Okay.” 
SF: 
Now it’s more fashionable to do the… 
AHH:  Yeah, but if you’re going to do a twelve [inch] by twenty-floor [inch], you’ve go to make 
sure you have a stiff floor because a two foot long piece of tile that’s a quarter inch thick, it’s not 
going to flex. It’s going to break. So make sure your floor’s—in commercial buildings they’re all 
on concrete floors so it’s fine but if you’re doing a house, no. And if you want to just walk 
through your house and see all of the tiles busted at the half-way mark. Oh, and the other thing is 
that now they’re putting them on the walls and so the way you cast a tile is it ends up being a 
little thinner at the perimeter and in the middle it’s a little fatter. That’s just how tile dries. So if 
you put a twelve by thirty-six tile and you put it up running bond, so you’re going to have places 
where the center of the thirty-six inch long tile is right against the end of the thirty-six inch long 
tile and you’re probably going to have an eighth of an inch difference in thickness. So it’s going 
to be bumpy. And if you think about it, it’s not how you want it to work but that’s a case of you 
have to understand the material because it doesn’t matter how much you jump up and down, the 
tile is still going to be made like the tile and that’s the best they can do. That’s how it’s made. So 
you’re doing a weird thing, you’re not supposed to put twelve by—you’re not really supposed to 
use twelve by thirty-six inch tile and you’re certainly not supposed to put it on the wall but I’ve 
seen it before. I’ve seen—I’ve seen where they’re like, Wow, where you get the really long, thin 
ones and you know, and you go in and you only realize it when it’s installed and the grout’s done 
and it’s too late. So. but that’s sort of understanding materials and understanding how they’re 
going to fit together.

SF: 
So it’s interesting, it sort of, it almost brings you back full circle back to when you were 
so interested in the craft. 
AHH: Yeah, no it’s the—I mean, how to put it together I think is fascinating. And you know, the 
materials piece is a key piece of that and what I find interesting is so many architects don’t think 
about it. I say to architects all the time—the AIA has surveyed people about what’s—they’ve 
surveyed owners—they do surveys of architects and they do surveys of owners cuz they’re some 
owners, the GSA, the General Services Administration, builds all the federal buildings in the 
country. They build a lot. Entities—Google—I ran into Google at Green Build five years ago—
six or seven years ago—and I said, “Why are you sitting here in this meeting?” And the guy said 
to me, “We build forty-thousand square feet a week.” But Google builds a lot. Now they do a lot 
of data centers but they also have huge employment. They build a lot. They have their own 
facilities team. You know, Facebook has a facilities team, the University of Maryland has a 
facilities team, Johns Hopkins University has—Johns Hopkins Hospital has a facility team.  
Johns Hopkins Hospital has a document on-line that tells you what product they want to use 
everywhere. They have their list, they have their standards, all these big corporate entities have 
facilities crews so it’s really easy for the AIA to find they can interview owners, owners in air 
quotes, because there’s a bunch of people that build for a living. And it isn’t just contractors. It’s 
the General Services Administration. So they interview owners and one of the questions which I 
find amazing is “What do you depend on architects for answers for?” And one of the things they 
universally agree on, like seventy, eighty percent, is architects choose materials. And it’s 
amazing because materials are an architect’s palette. That’s what they—that’s what you paint 
with. Don’t you want to choose your own paint? And I think so many times, the architects 
definitely want to choose the finishes, not the paint specifically but like the floor surface and 
what’s on the ceiling 
[01:00:00] 
if you’re in a commercial building, you know, maybe you want stretched fabric, maybe you want 
acoustic panels, maybe you want clouds, whatever. But so architects don’t care what kind of 
glass they use and the glass in a lot of these buildings, when you’re glazing a building, the glass 
is all you’re going to see. Architects might care what color the mullions are holding the glass and 
making the window but they probably don’t care what the manufacturer is. A lot of them will get 
into like the profile because they’re drawing it and they’re staring at a detail which shows the 
profile but there are so many things that architects don’t care about. And I’m amazed when I’m 
working with them. “What species of wood do you want?” “I don’t know.” I’m just like, You 
don’t know, really, seriously? Okay, and I would say, “ I’ll give you maple, oak—I’ll give you 
maple, oak, or cherry.” Those are mid-line. “Oh so it’s the uh, maple.” But yeah, you gotta, you 
gotta—if you’re going to create you’ve got to be in control of your palette. And materials are an 
architect’s palette.

SF: 
Well, when you left Ayers Saint Gross, then had you trained somebody to come behind 
you.  I mean, what a huge loss for them. 
   
AHH:  When I left Ayers Saint Gross, I had a great team member Alli Wilson, who actually, I 
was a part of the hiring process. She was—she worked—she was at the University of Maryland 
as a student. She had just graduated and she was the student—one of two student leads on the 
University of Maryland’s Student Decathlon—what’s that called—Solar Decathlon where all 
these universities design a building and then they build it on the [National] Mall and then it’s 
tested. Anyway, the University of Maryland, won. It was called “WaterShed”. And Alli was 
actively involved in this so we brought her in and it was a great thing that we did. We hired her 
and they hired her full-time but they allowed her to only work twenty hours and then she 
basically—she graduated in May but the Solar Decathlon finishes in October so she wanted to 
stay involved with it through the end so we basically paid her to continue—we paid her full-time 
and only made her show up at work twenty hours a week which meant she could go back to 
Maryland and help and keep involved. But she was great. She had amazing abilities as so she 
took over the sustainability effort when I went. And the specification writing effort they, I 
believe, just—they hired somebody to replace me. 
SF: 
When you look back, what are some important career milestones for you? 
AHH: Um, career milestones. I guess, getting the Fellows. [American Institute of Architects 
College of Fellows] They [Ayers Saint Gross] came to me to suggest that I go for AIA Fellow 
and I was like, What, really? And so I went ahead and did it. It’s sort of exhausting. It’s—you 
have to put a forty page document together. It goes on forever. And but no—that was sort of good 
and it also forces you—that was great—because it forces you to realize you have to keep track, 
which I was usually pretty good at doing. But there’s—you have to put two or three pages 
together of all the awards you ever won in your life which included all the awards that any of my 
firm—cuz I worked on all—I worked on ninety-five percent of the work that my firm did so I 
had to go through and sift through all of the awards they’d won because the University of 
Baltimore School of Law won numerous awards and you could sit and list them all because 
you’d worked on the building. And then but also keeping track of you know, the press that 
you’ve gotten, the talks you’ve done. So now I do a much better job of keeping track of all that 
just because it’s really hard to, you know—it’s really hard to put that together later. On the heels 
of getting my AIA Fellowship, I got LEED Fellow just because I’d already written the stupid 
document. So actually, and it’s a good order to do it in because the LEED Fellow is only about 
fifteen pages long and AIA Fellow is forty pages. So it’s now an editing job. Editing’s easier than 
writing. Those are milestones. You know, getting licensed was a milestone that happened a long 
time ago. And I remember the time—I got licensed the instant that I could, the first instant that I 
could. And all of my female friends did the same thing. And so many of my male friends were 
like, yeah, whatever. 
SF: 
So you passed it the first time through? 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
23
AHH: I passed it the first time, yeah. Yeah, I don’t know if that’s—I had someone say to me 
once, “Yeah, nobody—nobody good ever passes it the first time through.” 
 
No but, the Masters degree I didn’t think of as a milestone, but I was so young. And I’m 
always amazed because they keep coming. I remember saying to somebody when I was in my 
forties, she was saying, “Oh I think the best year of my life…” and she came up with something 
that was in the thirties. And I looked at her and I said, You haven’t had the best year of your life 
yet, I can guarantee, guarantee it because I’m telling you the best year of my life was fifteen 
years after the thing you’re giving me and I’m not sure I’ve had it yet and you know what, since 
I had that conversation which was six years ago, that woman had a baby 
[01:05:00] 
and I guarantee, I guarantee I proved her right. But it’s amazing because we think when we’re in 
our twenties, it’s just going to get worse. No, it just gets better. So it’s just kind of more. I don’t 
know—I don’t know what’s next. I just—it’s just—it’s fun. I’m just enjoying it and you know, 
life’s great. 
SF: 
And you have projects all over the country. 
AHH: Yeah, I have projects—I don’t have any overseas projects. I have a couple of—I have a 
couple of schools. I just finished a high school in Hawaii. I have projects in Texas, 
Massachusetts. You know what I’m doing? I’m counting the Ivys. Right now, I have Harvard, 
Princeton and Dartmouth so I’m not half way through. I did do a proposal for Brown. I don’t 
think we got that. But I’m working on it because I’ve gotta get all eight Ivys. So, but that’s not 
going to get me out of the Northeast. But—maybe I should count states. I think it’s mainly 
coasts. What have I got in the middle? Oh, I have one in Kentucky. That’s middle. Do I have one
—I have one in Arkansas, one in Texas. I’m going to make a map, put it on my wall and have all 
the states and I can have the Ivy League schools. All right that will be my two goals. See now 
I’ve got a goal! 
SF: 
Yes. So I’ll come back and interview you in five years and we’ll see where you are. 
AHH: See how I’m doing on my states. I don’t have overseas work but the overseas work, I 
don’t—I guess you could—I mean it’s just weird because the products are really different—even 
in Hawaii. It’s interesting, in Hawaii there’s different products. Obviously, you’re not going to 
get a lot of regional products and truly the guy who does the waterproofing is which of the 
waterproofing is shipped to Hawaii and what—what’s available and there’s an availability issue 
there. And I mean it’s fascinating there.  
 
You get lower carbon buildings in Washington State because Washington has an 
extremely green grid. Like they have almost no fossil fuels in their grid. They have a lot of 
renewables, so the building, if you make your steel in Washington State it’s got a lower 
embodied carbon because the energy used to make the steel has a lower footprint because a lot of 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
24
the energy is renewable. So it’s these weird things we’re learning as we press forward about how 
we build and what we build with. There’s availability. It’s really interesting. 
SF: 
So would you lean towards specifying steel from Washington State? 
AHH: I would except that if you have to buy—if you’re building a building in Boston and 
you’re buying your steel in Washington State, you’re adding a lot of carbon getting it to Boston. 
So there’s maybe a better way of, you know, but and there’s now—there’s calculators now, very 
new within the last five months. The thing called EC3 [Embodied Carbon in Construction 
Calculator] came out which is basically giving you the embodied carbon of ten products: 
concrete, steel, but carpeting—which is interesting, gypsum board and it tells you—you can 
literally click on all the parameters. I’m in this state, I’m buying this product, and then if you 
click on gypsum board you can—this kind, this kind, this kind—and it’ll tell you which of them 
are available and it’ll compare the carbon. And it’s a way of choosing—they’re trying to hit the 
stuff that you use a lot of.  
 
So concrete and steel are tough because just the act of making them is you know, tough 
and the thing with concrete, we talked about the Portland cement. With steel the issue is you 
want to use American steel which is a really good way—if you say that you get everybody on 
board because most American steel is electric arc furnace which means you get a much higher 
recycle content in. The other ones are blast furnaces which you get—electric arc furnace gives 
you about twenty—usually, it averages about ninety-five percent recycled steel because that’s 
what they do, they use the recycled steel. The BOD, the blast furnaces, are twenty-five percent 
recycled and that’s all the Chinese steel. So there’s this great story about the folks that were 
doing the San Francisco International Airport and they were redesigning the airport and they had 
these huge spans because you want a big wide open space so you’ve got a span that might be 
fifty feet, which is big. So they were using really big steel and almost all big steel comes from 
China. And if you’re on the West Coast you can float things across the ocean for very cheaply. 
Apparently, most of the gravel on the West Coast building projects comes from China. How 
crazy is that because it doesn’t matter how much space it takes up, it’s all floating, right. So what 
they did, the architects did, is they figured out and they told the structural engineers, “We don’t 
want you to use big pieces of steel. We want you to use trusses.” And if you use trusses that’s 
where you make up out of a whole bunch of little pieces of steel, not little, but smaller. So all the 
small steel they could get out of Washington State with their clean grid 
[01:10:00] 
and their EAF furnaces. And they got the embodied—cuz they saved I don’t know how many 
hundred—tens of thousands of tons of carbon. And it was this amazing story but it was this 
decision making. And if you’re not exposing the big steel, it doesn’t matter if it’s big steel or if 
it’s trusses. And if it’s trusses, it might not be that much more expensive. So but if you design it 
as big steel, that’s a decision that points you at China steel and a certain level of carbon so there’s
—but you have to understand all that.

SF: 
And so how do you keep up? How do you know? 
AHH: It’s really hard and I can’t remember what BOD [Biochemical Oxygen Demand] stands 
for but I do remember BOD is blast. I think it’s Blast Oxidation Depri—I don’t know what it is. 
But EAF is electric arc furnace so—but it’s really hard. And no but you can’t keep track which is 
why you need to know where the tools are and how to use them. So if you can find all the tools 
and then I keep my own lists and keep—but you need to find a way to decide what’s important 
and then create the list or tools that allow you to do the things that let you achieve the goal that’s 
important. And that’s what we’re struggling with and it’s really hard but you know, it’s not really 
great to live in a place like Australia four months ago when everything is burning down. So we 
try to stay focused on—there’s great things we can—you know there are things we can do right 
now that will fix stuff and we just have to do what we can and work to getting solutions to the 
things we haven’t figured out how to fix yet.  
SF: 
What needs to happen in the profession to deal with climate change or sustainability? 
AHH: Well, we need to get serious about—we need to get serious about our buildings, how we 
design them. They have to function incredibly well. They all need to be net-zero. We’re getting 
there. That’s happening. We need to focus on the material we’re using. We need to get rid of the 
crappy materials which I think in my world, that’s happening. It’s not happening all over the 
place and there’s just some stuff you’re never going to get rid of. The styrenes are really, really 
good at keeping water out. All right, we might need to keep the styrenes which are oil based—we 
need to keep the styrenes on the roof, all right.  
 
Ideally, we would only build of natural materials but that’s not going to work in an 
operating room. In an operating room you can’t put a wood counter. In an operating room you 
need something that’s going to be cleanable, that—oh, and I was working with this architect. So 
floors in operating rooms, they need to be non-slip which we knew. But I didn’t realize how non-
slip because he said you’re going to have water and tissue because when there’s something going 
on no one is going to stop and think. They’re just going to do, which is what you want them to 
do if you’re the person on the table asleep hoping you’re going to survive. You need operating 
room floors, need PSI resistance, pounds per square inch. I was like, What? Because if you reach 
for a cart no one’s going to think first, which way is the wheel facing. They’re just going to haul 
the cart. So you need to make sure that if the wheel’s facing the wrong way and that thing’s 
dragged it won’t rip the floor. I was like, fascinated. This woman was telling me all this and I 
was like, What? And they need to be soft so that you have to stand about—I’m like, you can 
wear better shoes—and she’s like, no, there’s no such thing. You’ve got to have a—it has to be 
soft. It needs to be acoustic so you’ve gotta hear what the people are saying. And I was like, what 
do you do? And she was like, there’s two products available. And it was—it was fascinating 
though because I’m used to—I’m good at floors but not operating room which is one extreme. 
There’s a ton of extremes right—jails, courthouses, you know. But there’s a bunch of extremes 
and you know it’s really hard to keep in mind that we think of a building as the house or the 
commercial office building we’re sitting in. That’s just not it. It’s so many complicated things 
that we have to think about. And they’re so many things that there just aren’t that many good 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
26
solutions for so we have to work on using the things where there’s good solutions and trying to 
apply pressure to have the manufacturers fix the things that right now aren’t really very good. 
And all of that’s happening in this market. But it’s just—and we talked about regulation. We 
have to do this with market based solutions because we are a capitalist country and that’s what’ll 
work. If we can—what I’m trying to advocate for people is don’t buy the stuff that isn’t good cuz 
if you stop buying stuff, they’ll change it. Because these guys want to sell something. They all 
get that, so if their number goes down, they’re going to change something. And that’s going to 
always work better than regulation—well, it won’t work better than regulation but in an 
environment where no one will regulate, including you and I, it’s all you got. But you and I, if 
someone isn’t buying our stuff we’ll change what we’re doing, right? You got to pay the bills. 
SF: 
So let’s just talk for a minute about gender equity in the field? Were you ever confronted 
with any situations 
[01:15:00] 
that when you were in architecture school, or in the field, construction site, or in an architect’s 
office or with a client that you had to deal with issues that were uncomfortable for you as a 
woman or just maybe discriminatory? 
AHH: Well, I’m pretty blunt so I don’t—I think more people are scared of me than anything 
else. I remember once I was on a construction visit at the Baltimore City Police Headquarters, 
and the guys were out there already. I was a little late, I was six months pregnant, and they were 
on the roof so I climbed the ladder. And I freaked those boys out. I think they went home and 
drank heavily that night. And I thought back on it later, like a month later, thinking I shouldn’t 
have done that to them. That was mean. I’m climbing a ladder. I’m out to here pregnant and 
they’re like, “Oh hoo-hoo-hoo”—any ways but no, in terms of issues regarding someone saying 
the wrong thing to me or treating me poorly, I didn’t take any of that. I pushed that back and 
typically by the time you talked to me for three minutes you kinda knew that wasn’t really going 
to be successful. However, I will say there is no such thing as gender equity in architecture firms. 
It’s boy focussed. It’s still run by white men. Now I am not a woman of color. I’m a white 
female. I don’t know how it is for folks of color. I’ll tell you what, for a female, it was ridiculous, 
I mean it’s just—the guy, the person they want to have a drink with is who they’re going to 
promote. So and you know, I worked at a firm for fourteen years and I quit and I—I’m doing 
great and I’m loving life so no hard feelings, all good, but I should have been a principal. But 
I’m not and it doesn’t matter cuz—whatever. I’m faced forward. I’m not looking back. It doesn’t 
matter but yeah, all things being equal, my advice to young women—don’t take any crap, make 
it clear you’re not going to tolerate. If there’s something really happens, absolutely report it. I 
mean don’t—don’t—don’t tolerate that but also if you truly want to be in charge, do your own 
thing because—and you know, the firm I used to work at has a president—has a woman 
president. But I’ve heard stories from women that are quitting and somebody was asked, “Do we 
have a women problem?” This is the woman president asking a woman who’s quitting. And it’s 
like, well, look around. How many other women are in the room with you? You know, that might 
Anne Hicks Harney, FAIA, LEED Fellow Interview, February 17, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
27
be a sign. But I don’t know. And the other thing is architects typically work pretty—well 
everyone works pretty hard—when you get high up in a company everyone works pretty hard. 
And it’s really, really hard to work hard, long hours and raise kids. And I am thankful, when I 
started my business, my children—my older one was a month away from graduating from high 
school and my younger one was basically entering junior year of high school. And by junior year 
of high school if I haven’t raised you—it’s probably a little bit—you’ve got to be on your own a 
little bit. And not they’re—and so he used to come home from school—he’d walk in from the 
bus or else he’s come in when he was driving and he’d walk in the door and I used to have a 
head-set on and I would—I would like do the thing where I showed him, I am—I would put my 
finger out, and I’d put myself on mute. I’d say, “I’m on mute. Did your day go okay?” “Yeah, it 
went okay.” “Okay great, I’m going off mute again.” And he knew he had to be quiet and he just 
knew that he had to go downstairs and get his work done. But I wouldn’t ever have done that if 
my son was ten. I wouldn’t have felt comfortable doing that but with a sixteen year old, I wasn’t 
super thrilled but I was like, yeah okay, this is okay. And now they’re at college and same thing. I 
texted him this morning to ask him about something and he got all snarky with me to tell me he 
was figuring it out. And I’m thinking, All right. You’re eighteen, I hope you are. 
SF: 
Either one of them interested in studying architecture? 
AHH: My younger one was saying he was going to but I told him, he wasn’t allowed. And that 
—that was when he was super young, maybe three or four. And my older one is studying 
archaeology, so that’s close. And my younger one is doing some combination of economics, 
status science and psychology. He really wants to tell you what to buy. He’s convinced he knows. 
And we’re telling him, “Good for you because if you figure out what everyone should buy and 
you work for the company that can then sell it all, you’ll make a lot of money.” And he’s very—
he runs—he used to run the dining table at night. He would run the conversation—even when he 
was like six. So we’re like, go to it. So yeah, you know, you just—it’s part of this exciting, wild 
ride called life. 
SF: 
Well what do you see as your legacy? 
AHH: Oh, do I have to have a legacy? 
SF: 
No. 
AHH: I don’t know, I don’t think that way. I really don’t. I mean, I think my legacy are my kids. 
That’s what I want.  
SF: 
You’re not the first person who has said that. 
[01:20:00] 
AHH:  Yeah I mean that’s—I don’t know—I don’t know—yeah, I think kids.

SF: 
But your—but gosh your contributions to the profession have been pretty amazing and 
now you're speaking. Have you ever thought of teaching—maybe kids in architecture school, or 
specification writing? 
AHH: Yeah, maybe. I have—but my husband just drove in by the way. He’ll walk in, in a 
minute or two. I have thought about it but I—it’s not, in this, in Baltimore it’s Morgan State and I 
have no affiliation with Morgan State. It’s a good school. But University of Maryland is too far 
away and yeah, I just haven’t thought about it. I just—it’s just not something I’ve, I don’t know. I 
student taught when I was in grad school and I just haven’t thought about it since then. I should 
probably do something like that but, I don’t know. 
SF: 
Well you do a lot of teaching at conferences and I mean you’re… 
AHH: Well, yeah. I mean you do that kind of thing. And you try to find people—I mean I’m 
involved in this group. We call ourselves ESTE leaders. Building Green, which is an on-line 
journalist and sort of data center of sustainability stuff. I work with them on a number of jobs 
and they used to do—they did—they do meet and greets and they do this whole coordinated 
thing where they have a group of people and we’re all on an email blog and we talk to each other 
and we do summits. And I know a ton of people through that organization and I get together with 
people from that group and I talk to the younger people and stuff. But yeah, I mean it’s—you 
know it’s, life is complicated. It’s so—everyone’s you know—twenties—thirties and forties is a 
busy, busy time. And I think that’s really the struggle. I mean, I think so many people think that 
they have to get something done by the time they’re thirty-five or forty and it’s like if you’re 
female—I remember learning about Louie Kahn who didn’t—he wasn’t even—he didn’t even 
have his own firm until he was like fifty-five. And I remember when I was twenty, twenty-two 
thinking, That’s going to be me cuz it just takes me longer to figure out what I’m doing. So and I 
don’t know, I don’t have any plans to quit working anytime soon. I figure I’ve got another ten or 
fifteen years left and we’ll just figure out what we’re doing and have some fun. But this is a blast 
so I’m, you know, enjoying myself. 
SF: 
Well is there any thing else, any other stories or any projects or anything that you’d like 
to add? 
AHH: No I think I’ve covered it all. I’ve got my ploy to have all the girls do this. I’ve got to 
figure out how to do that. Maybe I should just make my AIA spec talk about Why Girls Should 
Write Specs. 
SF: 
I think that’s a great idea. Thank you very much. 
AHH: Oh you’re welcome. Thank you.
