ArcZTAIIAI?A, DUST YOUR NECK TIE. 
13 
Written by Charlie Rufie. 
Sung by Teddy O'Lynn. 
Air, Lost Charlie Boss. 
My name is McNamara, in Castle Rahan I 
was born, 
I 
landed last year in New York a 
green horn, 
The boys call me nicknames and make fun of me, 
And say I 
came to this country the centennial to sec, 
They ask me if my hat I 
am a 
going to chuck up, 
They say take a 
walk around the block for a 
cup, 
If I 
show my face in the street I 
will hear some one cry 
Old McNamara, go dust your neck tie. 
The gang on the corner tell me take a 
float, 
Or go take a 
ride on Barney Duffy's ould goat, 
They kick me around as if I 
was a 
mad dog, 
And tell me drop my anchor, I 
am out in a 
fog, 
At the Hoolahan's ball as I 
stood at the door, 
A 
taking in tickets along with Mike Moore, 
The gang came along and at me did cry, 
Old McNamary, go dust your neck tie. 
About two weeks ago to Booth's Theatre I 
went, 
To see Julius Cxsar of course I 
was bent, 
My money I 
paid, to the gallery did go, 
And who did I 
see but the gang from below, 
I 
got a 
good seat, it was marked number ten, 
And impatiently waited for the play to begin, 
And all of a 
sudden I 
heard some one cry, 
Old McNamara, go dust your neck tie.

Presents himself to you, 
And you may guess, when he is dress'd, 
Of girls he knows a

A widow fell in love with him, 
While riding in a 
train. 
She had a 
blessed boy with her, 
Who caus'd us both much pain. 
SPOKEN,— Yes, the confounded young urchin 
caused me a 
great deal of pain and sorrow, and the 
widow, his mother, introduced me to him as his 
uncle!

And squeezes on the sty. 
But when my arm went 'round her wait-

The boy began to cry.

was hurting his mama

said to him in a 
voice so sweet : 
Cnonus. 
The mother told her loving son, 
To watch the passing. train. 
But. no, he said, my Uncle Fred 
Will kiss your hand ag:ain. 
The widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself, 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young elf ? 
SROEEN.—Yes, it would never do to make love be-
fore the boy, and the widow said : " Not before the 
boy, Fred, not before the boy." Just then we went 
under a 
tunnel and she said;

I 
went down on my kLees, 
And asked her il she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas? 
She sighed and said " you wicked man, 
But how about the child ?" 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I

But it don't belong to me ; 
If I

For fear some one would come in 
But I 
would like to take a

For I 
know it's full of gin.

Small drop of gin, 
To wet my fiery tongue; 
I 
loved you since me childhood, 
Many songs of you I've sung. 
Oh! how sadly I 
remember, 
It was two short months ago ; 
I 
had a 
lunch route; 
But they took me down below. 
They said I 
was a

And I

To lock me in a

And deprive me of my gin.

BRIGADE. 
Sung by Kennedy and Shields. 
Words and Music by Harry Bennett, 
W E 
are the seldom-Fed Brigade, 
As you can plainly see ; 
We often have to miss our meals— 
With us it don't agree. 
One meal a 
day is all we get, 
For that we have to fight, 
Oatmeal for breakfast, wind ior lunch 
And a 
walk around at night. 
CHCRI15.— We're the Seldom- Fed Bridage, 
For fighting we're not paid, 
And for our grub.we get a 
club— 
That's how our soup is m2de ; 
If soon we are not paid, 
We'll have to make a 
raid, 
To drive away starvation from 
The Seldom- Fed Brigade. 
If we could strike a 
hash mill or 
A 
lunch route on the street, 
You bet our baskets ‘ve would fill, 
We'd show you how to eat; 
We'd pulverize a 
restaurant, 
Or clean out a 
hotel , 
If we can't get a 
square meal, why, 
just let us take a 
smell. 
Wind pudding's all we got to eat, 
Of that we're awful sick, 
And if we ask for ozlisr grub, 
- The'll hit us with a 
brick ; 
We'll soon be healthy skeletons— 
Our clothes are getting loose ; 
Oh, if you want to see us bust, 
Just chuck us do w

OF 
my trials and great tribulations, 
I'm going to sing unto ye, 
Since I 
came to this great Yankee nation, 
Which every one says is so free, 
vire, I 
never get full of bad whiskey, 
I'm as innocent as a 
young lad ; 
Uut the boys yell at me whin l'm passing, 
" 
0, pipe off the ould-fashioned Tad !" 
CHORUS. 
Whin I 
came to this great Yankee nation, 
I 
thought that my heart would be glad; 
But the boys,,they do yell whin I'm passing, 
"Fire a 
brick at the ould-fashioned Tad !" 
Last night as I 
came through the Bowery, 
With nothing to bother my mind; 
A 
,gang of young roughs on the corner, 
Tould me to go " Pull clown the blind !" 
Now, I 
didn't say anything to them, 
But my feelings were hurt very bad, 
Whin they touid me to give myself UP, 
For I 
look'd like an ould-fashioned ' Fad ! 
Whin I 
came, & c. 
They tell li.e to get myself gilded, 
And call me a 
Centennial bum ! 
They say I'll be put on the Island, 
If I 
don't leave off drinking rum. 
They say I 
look like en Italian— 
By heavens! I'm nearly drove mad; 
But the worst thing they've said to me yet, is, 
" 
Go 'lie! you're an old-fashioned Tad !” 
STOkES' VERDICT. 
AIR--" kever Go Back on the Poor." 
If you listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this " glorious land of the free," 
And the difference l'11 show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of" stamps" you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold. 
Let the rich go, but hang up the poor. 
CHORUS . 
In the trials for murder we've had now- a-days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to'pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor. 
Let me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his grave— 
A 
good man as ever was born— 
Jim Fisk he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast, the poor and forlorn. 
W e all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure ; 
Though he lived like a 
prince in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor. 
CHORUS . 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along, 
To drive the " 2rim wolf" from the door, 
He strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor. 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, " wore his heart on his sleeve," 
No matter what people would say, 
And he did all his deeds ( both the good and the bad) 
In the broad open light of the day. 
33 
With his grand six-in- hand on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a 
big dash, to be sure, 
But Ch cago's great fire showed the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his wealth still remembered the poor. 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
His " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor. 
Now what do you think of this " trial of Stokes, 
Who murdered this friend of the poor ? 
When such men get free, is there any one safe 
if they step from outside their own door ? 
Is there one law for the rich, and one for the poor ? 
It seems so. at least so I 
say ; 
If they hang up the poor, why—damn it I —the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe, 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back on the poor. 
Oh shame on this " land of the free and the brave," 
When such sights as this meet our eye ! 
The poor in their prisons are treated like slaves, 
While the rich in.their cells they live high. 
A 
poor devil " crazy with drink" they will hang, 
For a 
murder he didn't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " political friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to spend. 
CHORUS. 
But if things go on this way, we'll stand it no more; 
The people will rise up in bands ; 
A 
vigilance committee we'll raise on our shore, 
And take the law in our own hands.

THERE'S A LETTER IN THE CAND 
There's a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me ; 
How the tittle spark is shining, 
From whoever can it he ? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like 
An 
a 
little sunny ray, 
d I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your bea in s 011 111C, 
And send a 
loving ro::ssoze, 
From lar across the sea.. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me : 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies 
You conjure in my head ; 
When those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play, 
Ev'ry shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember; 
'Tis two short months— no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before ; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me ; 
If this is only from the same 
HOW welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc.

PULL DOWN YOUR VEST. 
(New ,Yersion.) 
As sung by Frank Lewis. 
Pm a 
gay married man—I've a 
nice little wife, 
The days I 
went courting were the happiest in 
life: 
We would kiss and caress, our hearts full of love, 
While the old folks lay sleeping in bed up above. 
One night as we sat talking sweet in the dark. 
My arm 'round her waist, feeling gay as a 
lark, 
She says. don't go. darling, you're really divine, 
I 
pulled out my watch and said, dearest, it's time. 
SpoKEm.—I carry my watch in the fob pocket of 
my pantaloons. 
In taking it out my clothing b. --
came a 
little disarranged. .7%1 y 
darling touched rue 
on the shoulder and said. Johnny, dear, 
cuours. 
Pull down your Vest ! Puh down your Vest ! 
Papa is coming and yon know the rest : 
_Although we're engaged, I 
think it is best. 
Before he comes in, love, to pull down youryest. 
Young lovers will sigh, they'll bill and they'll coo, 
Just like their ancestors once used to do: 
They will swea:by the stars and the heavens 
above, 
That taught in this wide world can equal their 
love ; 
Bat oh I 
gentle maid, when enraptured in bliss, 
In the. arms of your lover, just beas in mind this. 
As you stand in the door ; ' neath the moon's L.;ens 
lie ray, 
At his last parting kiss, just remember to say— 
ellORUS. 
Pull down your Vet 
Pull down your Vest ! 
Although we're engaged, dear, I 
think it is best 
Ere yon fly away front your sweet Birdie's nest, 
Pull down your Vest, love, Pull down your Vest. 
My 
life has been checkered by joy and by woe. 
But I 
look o 
i 
the bright side where ever I 
go ; 
Down life's troubled stream I 
cheerfully glide. 
And I 
still court my wife at our bright fireside ; 
An there, of a 
night, if I 
go for a 
stroll. 
She gives ins a 
parting ernin ace as of old,• 
As I 
put on my hat she conies out to the door. 
And says, full of mischief, the same as of yore— 
cnorrus. 
Pull down your Vest! 
Pull down your Vest ! 
Somehow it gets rumpled whene'er we caress ; 
And folks they will notice— will talk at the best, 
Sc before you go out, love, why Pull down your 
Vest I 
WON'T YOU NEVER LAVE OFF THAT OULD 
3'7 
COAT? 
Composed by Chas. Buike. Sung by Haywood and Burke.* 
My name is Dunleaven, I'm a 
trim Irishman, sir, 
From the great North of Ireland I 
came ; 
I 
was christened Cornelius, if I 
understand, sir, 
That's the handle ' twas put to my name ; 
When but a 
wee gossoon, the old man's coat I'd put on, 
For I 
always was fond of such jokes ; 
When 'all of a 
sudden you'd hear him a 
shoutin'— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat ? 
CHORUS. 
I 
have travelled from Belfast all over creation, 
But I 
never yet had such a 
stroke, 
As when those boys shout—without my approbation— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat ? 
This coat has seen numbels of great revolutions, 
In what they call fashion and style ; 
But I'm bound to stick to it with a 
firm resolution, 
In spite of their gibes and their smiles; 
They don't understand this was made for the Grand 
Duke of Derry, whose name I 
can boast, 
Or they'd never cry out, or attempt for to shout 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat ? 
I 
have travelled, . etc.

ITS many years ago in Ireland. you must know, 
Since happiness looked do‘k iit n 
our land,

liberty. 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are to

There's a

If you listen unto me I

The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar.

Hurrah for Erin's Isle, thoturh her sons you can 
beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door. 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament 
is lost, 
And say that we never should complain: 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know 
for this very right. 
My countrymen are wiAting, o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our counti y for to 
save. 
Those words they should be beard from shore

For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name and may heaven be

His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice lie never gay., our peop'e to mslave. 
Nor drive them to a

And a

Such a

There was a

Provost Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by; 
She would pass by the shop on her way to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd tnrow a 
sheep's eye. 
The barber would wait till he saw her returning, 
And quietly then to the door he would come, 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip into her basket, 
And then drink her health in a 
pint of Bay Rum. 
But a

He heard of the barber and jealous lie grew; 
He loaded a

THE MISSELTOE BOUGH. 
The migseltoe hung in the castle hall, 
The holly- branch shone on the old oak wall, 
And their baron's retainers were blythe and gay, 
Treepinr , their Christ nuts holiday; 
The baron beheld with a 
father's pride, 
Ins beautiful child, yonng Lovel's bride, 
While she with her bright eyes seemed to be 
The star of the goodly company.

And Lovel, be sure, t

The clue to my secret linking- place. 
A 
way she ran, and bet friends began 
Each tower to search, and each nook to scan. 
And young Lovel cried: Oh I 
where dost thou lode? 
I'm alone without thee, my own dear bride. 
Oh ! the missehoe bough, etc. 
They sought her that night, and they sought he: oext

And they sought her in vain when a

In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot, 
Young Lovel sought wildly, but found her not.

How loving we were ? how cosy we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on a

Such squeezing and teasing, and pleasing we had, 
Such wooing and cooing, to make our hearts glad ;

When is a 
man less than a 
man? 
Wlien be leads or drives his friends 
To danger, for his selfish ends, 
And leaves them in the evil day, 
To stand or fall as best he may, 
Then is a 
man less than a 
man 
'nen we pity him all we can. 
When is a 
man less than a 
man? 
When he makes a 
vow he fails to keep, 
When without sowing he would reap, 
When he would borrow, beg or steal, 
Sooner than work for an honest meal, 
Then is a 
man less than a 
man. 
Then we pity him all we can. 
When is a 
man less than a 
man? 
When by misfortune stricken don e. 
He whines and maudles through t 
13ut never lifts his strong ri !dit anti 
To save himself from further hem, 
Then is a 
man less than a 
man. 
Then we pity him all we can. 
When is a 
rnan less than a 
man? 
When he acts the coward's part. 
When he betrays a 
woman's heart, 
And scorns, ill uses and deceives. 
Th3 love that lingers and believes, 
Then is a 
man less than a 
man. 
Then we pity him all we can. 
some one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty. Death's tinoers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
-Weary with parting awl never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
:Rin g 
the bell softly, there's crape on the docr, 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weal y 
with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet ; 
Some one has gone to the bright goldun shore; 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow end sin, 
town, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams 11,1,-2 brought us ', heir i.gtit. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to heaven's glad shore! 
Ring the bell, softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
When is a 
man less than a 
man 
When he takes delight in raising strife; 
When he values honor less than life, 
When he insults it fallen foe, 
Or at a 
woman aims a 
blow, 
Then is a 
man le:.s 
than a 
man. 
Then we 14.`v hint nil we can. 
Noouns.----Weary with mingling, etc 
Angels were anxiously lon1..!ing to meet 
One who walks with them in heaven's bright street ; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
Free from earth's trials, and taking sweet rest. 
Yes! there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departe ,1

And the light of her smile will be mine,
