LACKAWANNA GANG. 
As sung by KONOLLMAN and RrrriE with great success. 
Also 
sung by CONROY and MURPHY nightly. 
Here we are, two " Latkawanna Spooners :" 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlom to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected 
Spooners of the Gang," 
CHORUS. 
As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and enduranc0; 
With other scallawags we have no interference; 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the "General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like "Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We could put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang."

NEVER GO BACK ON THE FLAG.

A privilege it is to be born in this land 
Of the noble, the proud and the free, 
Where each man will offer his heart and his hand, 
To drive out such cruel tyranny, 
Such as was practiced by English rule, 
In the days of oppression gone by ; 
But like solid men to the front they did come, 
Determined to conquer or die. 
CHORUS. 
Then good people here just take my advice, 
No matter whatever you lag ; 
If you should have the honor Ito adopt this land. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
If you take this advice you will surely find 
A 
blessing you'll find in the end; 
And you will be loved by the good and the kind, 
f 
to your duty you do well attend. 
But be not like the men who would gain themselves 
wealth, 
And to crime they will let themselves drag; 
But be honest and upright, and above all you do, 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
Then good people, etc. 
It was under that fir' that Benjamin FranlAin was born, 
A 
statesman both noble and true, 
Though poor at the tirst, yet himself he did raise, 
To be proud of the red, white and blue. 
It was under that fliq- that George Washington was born, 
Tho father of this country, 
And with many others he nobly fought, 
To make it the land of the free. 
Then good people, etc,

BROOKLYN'S GREAT FIRE. 
Composed by P. J. 
DOWNEY. 
(Air— " 
Sailor's Return." 
It was on a 
Tuesday night, as the stars were shining 
bright, 
When this happened which I'll now relate to you; 
It's about this sad affair that you hear most everywhere, 
And that o'er our pleasant city spread a 
gloom. 
It of the young and old I'll tell, how their dear lives they 
did sell, 
And who suffered, God only knows what pain; 
But I 
hope they're now at rest, in heaven with the blest, 
And with pain they'll ne'er be troubled any more. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
It was, on this fatal night, when with faces that were 
bright 
That those people they all left their happy homes; 
If the " Two Orphans" they could see, how happy they 
would be, 
And all to the Brooklyn Theatre they did go. 
The place it was filled soon, and some left for want of 
room, 
And them that got seats thought that they were lucky; 
But it's little did they know the trouble or the woe, 
That they were about to leave upon this earth. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
They all sat there with glee and the falling sparks did see, 
And they most all thought that it was in the play; 
But when they saw the flames and smoke they saw it was 
no joke, 
It's then they ran excited for the door. 
Some fell upon the floor, from which they rose no more, 
And God help the women, you could hear them cry, 
And young men there with their wives, asking God to 
save their lives, 
But it seemed they all were led there to die. 
(Repeat last four lines.)

AH LING'S TRUE LOVE. 
Written by R. 
J. 
PIGOT, for CIIARLES KONOLLMAN, the 
popular comique, and sung by him with immense success. 
(Air—" Lover's Telegraph.") 
In Baxter street there lived a 
man, 
A Chinaman, I 
mean, 
Who was dead in love with a 
black and tan. 
A 
coon named Susie Green ; 
This Chinaman, by name Ah Ling, 
Would fight all day for Suse, 
He went to see her every night, 
To drive away the blues. 
One night Ah Ling went to her house, 
To ask her if she'd go, 
With him unto the Chinese ball, 
But Susan answered no; 
Says Ling " What is the reason, Sue, 
That you won't go with me ?" 
" 
My husband said if I 
should go, 
He'd break my head," sobbed she. 
Poor Ling it almost broke his heart, 
To think that he should lose, 
The lovely one whom he adored— 
His own beloved Suse; 
Says he to her, " We'll lun away, 
And closs the sea so blue," 
They sailed away—the ship got lost, 
• 
And that was the last of the two." 
PRETTY MABEL CLARE. 
FANCY SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by R. J. Proorr, expressly for CALLAIIAN 
FLYNN, Amateur Song and Dance Artists. 
In a 
pretty coltage in you dell, 
A 
charmer does reside, 
One whom I 
hope to call ere long, 
My own sweet little bride ; 
She's fairer than the reddest rose, 
None with her can compare, 
I 
really think 'twould break my heart, 
To lose sweet Mabel Clare. 
CHORUS. 
A winsome loving little darling is she, (
break) 
I 
love her to distraction and she loves me, (
break) 
She's the pridn of all the village, 
To harm her none would dare; 
I 
always am contented when 
I'm near sweet Mabel Clare. 
Last Sunday eve we took a 
stroll, 
Sweet Mabel Clare and,i, 
Hown where the shallow little stream, 
Doth ripple slowly by; 
I 
whispered naught but words of love, 
Unto my charmer fair; 
Pm always happy when I'm near 
My pretty Mabel Clare.

IT'S SIMPLY IMMENSE. 
Composed and sung by CHARLES KONOLLMA.N, and sung 
by him at the Third Avenue Theatre, N Y., with great 
success. 
New by-words we now have enough— 
Aye! hundreds, and:plenty to spare, 
They are cited by the high-toned and rough, 
But the latest 
think takes the,chair ; 
You'll hear it wherever you go, 
And at it you'll not take offense, 
So I'll give it without more ado— 
The latest word out is " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
" 
You're a 
snide," and a " bloat," are played out, 
And " What do yer say ?" has no sense, 
But the latest of all you'll admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
We've affairs that have troubled our land, 
Concerning the people and State, 
The perambulation of Tweed 
In eluding the law was first rate ; 
Now in Ludlow Street Jail he's been caged, 
Minus some dollars and cents, 
And the police do proudly relate 
l'hat his capture, you know, was " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
"Pull Down Your Vest" is played out, 
And Wipe off Your Chin" had no sense, 
But the latest you all will admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
In Brooklyn's great hour of sorrow 
Let us willingly stretch forth our hands, 
To help the poor widows and orphans, 
Rendered helpless through fire's fell brand ; 
The generosity of the actors we admire, 
It will be cited a 
century hence, 
Their generosity they showed by their wallets, 
And that you must say was " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
So follow the actors' example, 
In the matter of dollars and cents, 
Let your sorrow be of these a 
sample, 
Then we shall say you are " Immense." 
Now to an end my song does approach, 
And I 
hope it's not been out of place, 
And that you don't think I 
encroach, 
But appreciate my efforts with grace; 
And if I 
ask for your applause, 
I 
hope you'll not take offence, 
And call here another time, 
Then you may think Charlie " Immense." 
Cnouus. 
" 
Pull Down the Blind's" getting dim, 
" 
Turn Down your Collar" had no sense, 
But this late one you all will admit 
It suits, and It's Simply Immense."

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
On, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain. 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc.

Price 35 cts. 
We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORDS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
• 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar. 
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to tne tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As cach one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
lie's the daisy swell that's with the :amens Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emefald Hall, and an illegant suppet 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat fot 
you, 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Bract. 
gans band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked m 
the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room. etc.

Oh, bright and gay is the National Guard, with colors flying 
free, 
We dash along and grandly parade— oh, none so proud as we; 
Our guns we hold in the prettiest line, to catch the people's 
eye, 
With our heads upright and eyes so bright when we go marching 
by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! right about we go, 
The stars and stripes above so gallantly they flow: 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp ! down Broadway, 
The ladies wave their little hands to see our grand array. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time march, in our uniforms so bright, 
The drums and trumpets play; and fill us with delight; 
When we meet to march or tight, we take the lead—we do

The American National Guard.

Oh, still on hand is the National Guard to meet the nation's

And bright and clear their record so fair, as all the people know; 
We heed the call of the national voice, and ready lads -,

At the word command, with heart and hand, we rally near and 
far. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! Gleams our banner high, 
Your heart will beat with pride to see us passing by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! Gay lads we. 
To right-about and in and out parading bold and free.

Then here's success to the National Guard and may it lead the

And always heed the national call be ready every man. 
Oh, may it ever its powder keep dry to strike a 
gallant blow, 
While the people love those stars above, bright waving to 
and fro. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, in the van we lead. 
The people come from far to see each man and steed. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! light and gay. 
We're always ready rank and file to meet and march away!

TWO ORPHANS. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
Air.—" Over the fills to the Poor-House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark! do you hear that cry? 
Fire! 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the " Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take; 
The doors they were open at seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight; 
Them that had got seats they w, re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly, 
Till sparks from the scenes they did fly; 
It's then that men, women and children, 
"Oh, God, save our lives !" they did cry, 
We ne'er can etc. 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, Godl what a 
sight met our eyes s 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Some there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God! let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er 3an, etc. 
What means this large gathering of people, 
Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
Where the wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can. ete.

THEY ALL DO IT.

FITCHETT. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Copyright, 18'17, by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Some folks will cry " Oh I 
shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally-men " from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For :lours three or four, lovers !spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
Aron can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little pull, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;'L.. 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

When the sun rise in the morning, 
Down by the yellow corn, 
There we darkies all take warning, 
When Dina blows the horn. 
When I'm gone you will miss me, I 
When I'm gone you will miss me, 
There is one kind heart will miss me when 
I'm gone, yes when I'm gone. (Repeat.)

And if you give me your heart and hand, 
We'll go to the old Virginia shore.

Still my mem'ty will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in: 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dor, bark. 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming. Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own. 
In dem agonizing., cruel slav'r2,- 
days.

I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done: 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknops, toil and F.orrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last. 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive. 
Has always been my guide. 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls (ley were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'tT days, 
Composed by Wm. TuomPsoN, and respectfully dedicated to

BLUE GLASS. 
Words and Music by SAM DEVERE. 
Music published by Got-m.outto, Tremont Street, Boston, Mass. 
A 
great discovery has just been made, 
Most wonderful to relate, 
It grows new teeth in worn out gums, 
Or hair on an old bald pate; 
'Twill take the color from a 
strawberry nose_ 
Cure a 
woman of too much tongue, 
And impart the bloom of youth to the cheek. 
And sure to make an old maid young. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Blue Glass, Blue Glass, 
It's 
7eat discovery sure; 
If you get a 
little sick, you can cure it up quick. 
By trying the Blue Glass cure. 
There never was a 
remedy known in the world 
Like the wonderful Blue Glass cure, 
Cures a 
cough, or a 
cold, or a 
pain in the stomach, 
I'd smile if it dicl'nt 'em cure; 
A 
wart, or a 
bunion, or a 
cramp in the heel, 
And busted hearts, or sprains, 
And a 
Blue Glass crown in a 
stove-pipe hat. 
Will surely make a 
new set of brains. 
Oh! Blue Glass, itc. 
We've got Blue Glasc' in our sky-lights. 
It keeps out the wini, and the rain, 
We've got Blue Glass all over the house, 
We've got Blue Glass on the brain; 
I 
fell in a 
box of old Blue Glass, 
And how it did peel my shins, 
I 
believe if it was'nt for that Blue Glass, 
We'd never had them last twins. 
Oh: Blue Glass, &c.

I 
stopped in the big Aquarium, 
Not very long ago; 
To see the bass and suckers, 
And to hear the white whale blow. 
A 
skate and a 
flounder making love, 
And they shook each other's fins; 
And a 
crab, with a 
sunshade over his head, 
Come along with a 
pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the big sea lion he howled and growled, 
And the seal beat time with the drum; 
And the whale he swallowed a 
ton of eels, 
At the big Aquarium. 
I 
had my gal along with me, 
She's purty, but she's dark; 
And when she laughed and opened her mouth, 
I 
thought she'd swallow the shark. 
The lobster smiled and sucked his thumb, 
And laid as still as death; 
When the turtle winked his eye at Sal, 
It nearly took her breath. 
Oh, the big sea lion, etc. 
The music played and the sturgeon danced, 
But the porpoise cleared the track: 
The eel he tied himself in a 
knot, 
And the crab walked on his back. 
The trout and the catfish danced a 
reel, 
And the sea lion let a 
roar; 
When the whale got up and blow'd his nose, 
My gal, Sal, bounced out the door. 
Oh, the big sea lion, etc.

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE. 
As originally sung by W ILL H. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every land; 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor was our bond of strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all tier sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the motherland, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette—the sunlit hills of France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each workingman a 
chance.

All the world we come to heal, 
Into every berast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, &c. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back with glory crowned. 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Such a 
wicked lot we found, 
From the aged and the wise, 
Severed from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band.

GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR. 
Written and sung by W ILL. H. 
MORTON with HARRIGAN 
HART'S COLYIbillatiOZ. 
While the sad cry of hard times rasound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and their own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask you rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass mElonaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemn ,ruth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small store, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

Written by HARRY BENNETT for SAM DEVERE. 
I'm going to sing of an odd little phrase, 
Of which you have heard, I've no doubt; 
Ask your friends any question, their answer will IA 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
You'll hear this expression each day in the week, 
In the town, If you're roaming about, 
And every one's gone on this quaint little speech— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings in use now- a-days, 
You'll hear them while strolling about; 
But the strangest of all things I've heard is just this— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
A man falls in love with a 
pretty young girl; 
And is anxious to make her his bride; 
His money he spends taking her out at night, 
Or out on the road for a 
ride. 
He's " giving her taffy," the young men all say, 
His wardrobe is all " up the spout;" 
When he asks her to marry, her answer will be: 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings, &e.. 
If you go out at night and get fearfully tight, 
And try to be one of the gang, 
The chances are great that you'll get in a 
fight, 
And some one will give you a 
bang, 
And when it is morning, you're taken to court, 
And the judge asks what you were about, 
If you don't answer quick, why he surely will say: 
"I'll give you six months to find out." 
There's many flash sayings, Zr.,C 
The great events of the past year, my friends, 
Were the stealing of young Charlie Ross, 
The trial of Beecher, who still wants to pray, 
And the flight of the once famous " Boss." 
And no one can tell where sweet William has gone— 
In fact, it's a 
matter of doubt; 
But if you are anxious to know where he 1

When first I 
went to see my gal, 
We courted in the dark ; 
But her father and her mother and cross-eyed brother, 
Would listen while we'd spark. 
So I 
bought the new- invention, then, 
And gave them all the laugh; 
'Twas a 
string with a 
tin box on each end, 
Called the Lover's Telegraph.

Oh, the new invention is awful nice, 
I 
know 'mould make you laugh; 
To hear the very funny things we said 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
When next I 
went to see my girl, 
I 
had very little to say: 
I 
gave her one end of the new machine, 
And sat about twenty feet away. 
The old folks thought we acted strange, 
And called me a 
great big calf; 
But they didn't know how the old thing worked, 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Said 1, ' sweet angel dost thou know, 
I 
lowest thee the best?" 
The answer came so soft and sweet— 
" 
Oh, George, pull down your vest!" 
When I 
asked her if she'd fly with me 
To the land of the wild giraffe; 
She answered back " how are you fixed ?" 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Love went flying through the string, 
Till her brother found us out; 
And then he whispered to his dad 
What we had been about. 
The old man gently raised his hoof. 
Nearly splitting me in half; 
He busted a 
hole in my new pants, 
And the Lover's Telegraph.

THE WATER MILL, 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Listen to the water- mill, all the livelong day, 
Bow the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-milL 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the speli is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that. has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, lose no honest .way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with the v:t"r th^t has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lort without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh I 
hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed
