<unintelligible text> my story is about the duvitches this is a story based on prejudice in
which a town in uh what was the state? Well i dont remember the state uh what the town
is this town had a terrible way of prejudging poeple from a foreign land in which they didnt
know nothing about they just took it for granted that uh they were poor they didnt have the
money so they had to be uh out down outright sorta of uh not in their class so these people
hardly even accepted the duvitches in their town a few uh women in the town tried to be
friendly to the duvitches but uh like the mother was sick one time and uh when the child
came to the door they said the mother is ill i'll see you later or something like that the child
said so as uh nobody really got a chanceto know the duvitches they first moved to a farm
outside of town and uh the farm got <unintelligible text> down and uh the soil was probably
worn out so they had to uh move into town and uh everybody else on the street thought
that they were uh that they werent supposed to be in town because that would uh disgrace
their section because they were poor but the duvitches were really very nice poeple they
came from uh the netherlands and you think american spirit would be to be friendly to
everyone as uh peace goodwill toward men is but these people were just prejudged from
uh people from a foreign country so they uh didnt really uh accept them now the duvitches
lived on main street now any visitors anyone body else who come into the town to visit
other people who had been living there for years would feel ashamed and disgraced to see
the duvitches house cause it was rundown and uh wasnt in uh good condition and they

had about eleven kids running around and they were werent properly dressed or nothing
the the duvitches uh wouldnt have survived the winter without the uh the help of the doctor
a couple of them lost fingers and one broke
Speaker: an arm or a leg and the doctor would not accept payment from the duvitches so
uh the doctor would just take home some beautiful flowers that the uh mother had raised
the duvitches were a very poor off family the father had to support eleven kids so often uh
many of the times the children would have to go out and steal apples and stuff apples and
pears for uh food for the table while tom and jerry just did it for kicks tom and jerry are uh
the neighbors that live across the streeet of the duvitches which uh they hardly ever see
except the daughter who is around their age now these boys are fifteen and seventeen
and uh theyre very prejudged themselves like in school they wouldnt accept the duvitches
they would not hang around with them or nothing they wouldnt go on a fling or nothing
with them they would consider the duvitches poor and not their type uh theyre too good for
them many times tom and jerry would uh go camping out at the lake with their father one
day all the six duvitch boys were up there they had been fishing for hours they had caught
something like sixtyone fish and tom and jerry out of despite they decided to uh pull a dirty
joke on the uh duvitches by throwing a a keg of soap in the water <unintelligible text> uh
the pan where the fish were so they took off so after they came back the duvitches seen
their fish not fit to be eaten by uh in which the soap was all in their body and they couldnt
eat them they had to throw their fish away so the the father of tom and jerry he told he
was very strict with them he told them to get out in the boat and uh go fishing and dont
come back until you got the fish so at first they thought it was a big joke to come uh out
to the lake you know and uh just fish for a couple of hours then they thought their father
would be nice enough to let them back in but the father just sat there out of despite and
mad because their sons had to pull such a big dirty trick on the people now that was their
supper for the night and they uh they went home
Speaker: half heart heartbroken without their food for the night so it all started out they
were in the boat fishing they were there two hours and they kept and the sun was beating

down and they were getting very sunburned so jerry calls out to his father and asked him if
they could come in he said you stay out there till you caught fish enough fish to uh replace
the ones you spoiled for the duvitches so they were in the boat they stayed there all day
and at night tom kept asking jerry what time it was from the agony of going through all
the time of the being in the boat without food and uh they were all sunburned and the
mosquitoes were starting to eat them up and during the night the mosquitoes would be
so terrible they would jump in the lake to get them off them they had caught something
like sixteen fifteen fish in the first night they were there and <work?> for the <unintelligible
text> two boys out in the boat got to town and many people came in to uh to the lake to
see how log they would stay out a lot of people were making bets of of on the thing uh how
long they would stay but the father just said just sat there and didnt say anything he just
told them not to come in until they got the restof their fish now from the day before they
were very sunburned they didnt have nothing to put on it no food for one day the father
told them to stay out there they stayed out there and the sun was just beating donw all
sweaty and the boys were very uncomfortable they had to jump in the water a few other
times to get the uh the sun was uh very hot on them it was really burning their skin so the
duvitches the duvitches werent heard of much until uh after so tom and jerry still in the
boat theyre fishing the next night went by they caught uh forty one fish they kept fishing
and fishing all night the mosquitoes kept eating away at them it was terribel for them it was
sort of like torture so next morning they caught they caught enough fish they came in and
their father took them back into town where they had
Speaker: they gave the fish to the duvitches the mother when they walked in the door
the <boys?> the two boys were very sunburned their skin was all peeling and bubbles
were formed from this sun from the heat so the mother uh washed them up gave them
something to eat and sent them to bed it was around uh six seven oclock so tom and
jerry they were lying in bed their uh their bodies are so sunburned that the sheets would
stick to their skin and they were all burnt the next night the duvitches invited them over
for uh for a fish for the dinner that they had caught so even out of terrible pain that they

were in and the sunburn on their neck their nose all over they decided to go the father
made them go so they went to uh when they went over to the duvitches even uh though
they <were?> sunburned and everything they see how nice everything was and they was
all decorations and flowers in the house all the children were neatly dressed at the table
they brought out the fish even though they were burned they still seen seen how nice the
house was and it wasnt so painful to them now then the mother was showing them how
some of them could uh play musical instruments and everybody had a good time that night
then after that everybody started going over to the duvitches everybody was going over
there to see the mother and everyone got very friendly with the folks and uh tom and jerry
started to hang around with the other sons in the family everything sorta worked out all
right but this is a perfect example of prejudging as prejudice known these people were
prejudged because they came from another country and because they were uh poor but
you shouldnt prejudge a person because of his race color creed or if he comes from a
different uh country because its not really how the person is or how he looks its uh the
insight of the sperson his personality how they really are is that fifteen <unintelligible text>
another example of prejudice is the kkk commonly known as the ku klux klan the ku klux
klan was started in 1866 shortly after uh the was between the states it was started up by a
bunch of uh
Speaker: generals from the confederate army who were awfully opposed to civil rights
and wanted to get back at the negro so theyd uh devised the klan from uh the klan and
came uh from the <gap> irish klan as six and there were six member the ku and klux were
started from the first letters of k as ku as for klan a group and klux is the latin word for
uh uh sorta like prejudge i dont know the exact definition of it they were uh the ku klux
klan was very prejudiced against everyone uh christians they didnt like and negroes they
especially didnt like <unintelligible text> they dont like christians catholics catholics they
dont like really they uh went on different rampages they would burn crosses in front of
negroes houses burn down the houses they would uh tar and feather negroes who did
nothing or tried to oppose the ku klux klan uh one man was tarred and feathered by the

ku klux klan because he tried to put up a rev a revolt against it they took the man out of
his house they killed his wife and two kids they hung them then the man they branded
his back with a branding iron kkk they boiled tar threw the man in and then they uh threw
him in a bag of feathers they they uh strapped him to a horse and threw uh rode him out
of town the man was recovered he was half dead when they found him all covered with
tar and feathers he died uh next day of skin suffocation they were very cruel this ku klux
klan anybody who tried to rebel revolt against them they would be burnt <when?> a cross
would be burnt in front of their house and the would be taken out and hung in the woods
the kkk lasted about five or six years then sorta died out from lack of membership it uh
didnt really last until about uh nineteen hundred it started coming around some colonel in
the uh after the first world war started it up again and they sent a national ballot all over the
united states join the kkk fights for one and all and uh that was really when the terrorists
started they would seek out any negroes they didnt even started anything they'd go kill
them for nothing alot of times the women would be branded then hung hung by their heels
from a tree until someone else caught them took them
Speaker: down a lot of times they used thumbscrews other times theyd whip theyd whip
any uh white person the negroes would mostly be hung a cross burned in front of their
house their house burned and it was all sorts of things the kkk did uh in 1939 this uh to
show the strength of the kkk four hundred thousand klans members came and marched on
the white house on the green at the white house to show their support a lot of them were
still riding their uh customary horses that all
