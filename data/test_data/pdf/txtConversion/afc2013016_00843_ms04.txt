the local hospitals cafeterias.

Lots of outside business i.e.) catering. Have done catering for more than just Indian families i.e. 
American weddings in their catering. 
Less expensive than American catering and much healthier. It's all fresh.

Salads 
They all have an Indian twist to them except for the one that is like a

Local Indian community and American customers 
Mostly have worked with the American customers so understands them really well. Doesn't feel 
a 
cultural difference with them. 
Has a 
different relationship with the Indian customers because she already knew them but never 
really bonded with them over the experience of learning the food. 
13:30 
Beginnings of business 
When did the business start? 
2004 September 10th 
Before had a 
successful technology training company training teachers in Michigan. 
Times had changed in the education field and she was forced to close that company. 
Wanted to introduce the Indian food to Americans as well as introduce preventative/ healthy 
food to people. 
15:00 
Background in culinary arts 
Do you have classes on teaching the food? 
No. She doesn't have the certification to formally teach it. She has learned from reading and 
learning. People ask her about how healthy she looks, that is when she shares the information 
about the health benefits of the Indian food. 
16:40 
Indian food philosophy 
Indian food is based on balance how you can stay healthy by using certain spices in abundance 
and biological foods. (A 
science of food is in Indian culture.) 
17:30 
Educating customers about food and health 
People who come here want to learn about food and want to eat better. Don't have signs about 
the medicinal values because she doesn't have any certifications. Once she gets talking to them 
she is then able to explain how the foods help. 
19:50 
Family involvement in grocery store 
Does your family help? 
No. My husband does but he works in the back with marketing and other office work. Has two 
daughters working in the healthcare industry. Children born and raised here; never helped in the 
store. Left after high school graduation. 
21:20 
Languages used in store 
What about language? 
When people first come in do you speak English to people? 
Yes, even to Indians because you don't know which state they are coming from, so English is 
easier. 
21:47 
Employees—ethnicity, qualifications 
Hiring employees 
Other worker here is from Lebanon. 
She prefers to hire mostly women because they feel comfortable working with her. They stay 
and grow with them. Doesn't have a 
big turn over? 
Do you try to get people from other ethnicities? 
No, people usually come looking for jobs. Makes sure they work hard, clean, pleasing 
personalities. I 
hire them and if I 
like them then they work here. Those with Middle Eastern 
origin tend to work out the best--they are hard working. She likes to hire people who she thinks 
they will stay for a 
while. 
There is a 
male that works in the back doing dishes; he is the brother of another employee. 
Has hired Americans but they didn't last long, weren't as hard working. 
24:17 
Business ownership 
Would you be happy working in an American grocery store? 
Has always had own business. Would rather work for self and help create jobs for others. Had 
never worked for anyone. 
26:33 
Store more reflection of her personality rather than her ethnicity 
Do you feel your business is an expression of you or of you culture (India)? She has never 
thought that but people have told her that it is a 
reflection of her personality; clean, bright colors, 
happy. She takes it as a 
complement. 
27:37 
Food and cultural heritage 
The food as part of your cultural heritage 
28:00 
Store is a 
business but also much more. 
Making money, it's a 
business... Money comes and goes but she likes the life experiences. 
When the weather is bad so is business. This job is like her childibaby; not money making but 
doing so much with people and community it gives her great satisfaction. 
29:07 
Not interested in expanding. 
Do you think about expanding to other types of food Example hospitals)? 
No. Focus on one thing. We expand on a 
different way like the hospitals. 
30:00 Holiday celebrated and recognized at store. 
Do you celebrate the holidays here? Yes. We celebrate every day because every day is special. 
There isn't enough time to do anything too special. 
Are you open on Indian/Hindu holidays? 
Open 356 days. People come on Christmas. Vegetarians come to pick up vegetarian foods to sit 
beside their turkeys. Likes fusion food. Mixing the Indian food with American culture. 
31:30 
Employees—clothing, expectations 
Asked about the different dress of employees. She said that she doesn't care what they wear or 
what religion they are as long as they are clean and decent. Wants to give opportunity to 
everyone. 
32:35 
Advertising of store not necessary 
Do you advertise? 
She used to but it didn't do much help. Getting new customers has been through word of mouth. 
"The ones who know bring the ones who don't know." 
Now getting more people through hospitals. 
They have had the food there [in the cafeterias] and 
then come here to get more. 
Cooking shows [on television] help because they hear about certain ingredients. Dr. Oz talks 
about Indian species and what they cure certain ailments and people come in search of those 
foods too. 
33:25 
People in general now more open to other cultures. 
Do you think there is now more of an understanding of other cultures? 
Yes, people are more understanding and want to learn more about other cultures.
