F: What does your family do for Christmas? How do you celebrate Christmas at your
house?
S: Well you see we live near our grandma and usually either on Christmas or Christmas
Eve we'll open our gifts. It don't matter which depending on how many people's going to be
down. Because most people come down the evening of Christmas Eve and all of our folks,
so Christmas Eve morning sometimes we open our gifts because everybody's coming
down you know and then they'd be in our house and everything. Sometimes we wait til
Christmas. This year we're going to wait til Christmas. But then we go out to my grandma's
and have dinner and they have a whole bunch of pies and cakes you know and all kinds of
goodies and no that's the reason I like to go out there.
