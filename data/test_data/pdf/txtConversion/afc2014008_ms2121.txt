degree a place for experimentation,  for helping old ways lead
 
into new,
 
But let me go back to my old teaching days -
-
 and to our
 
archive. When I was teaching,  I had many goals -
-
 I wanted
 
excitement for my students,  I hoped they would see brand new
 
worlds,  especially those most immediately around them that
 
they so often overlooked.  I wanted them to be masters of the
 
skills of university education -
-
 writing,  analysis,
 
research,  debate.  In pusuit of these dreams,  I decided it
 
would be important for my students to experience and respond
 
to living folklore,  not  just read about it.  I wanted to upset
 
their general idea that folklore was really just trite old
 
primary grade corny stuff -
-
 things like Little Red Riding
 
Hood,  or labor protest songs,  or Greek myths,  or wart cures.
 
Good for children,-- or maybe good for radicals and other
 
oddballs,  or people who died a long time ago -
-
 but I wanted
 
students to see this material today:  alive,  kicking,
 
omnipresent,  feisty,  and essentially grownup.
 
Now,  I was always honest with my students. At every
 
first class meeting I informed them that very few folklorists
 
ever made a dime being a folklorist -
 and it was highly
 
improbable that they would even make that much.  However,I
 
also pointed out that they were likely to live a lot longer
 
than earlier generations,  and that they might well need to
 
look around for things that could make those long lives that
 
they were expecting more interesting.  They might find,  if
 
they really worked at it,  that folklore is a rather special
 
discipline in that it can be pursued at any age,  without
 
complex equipment,  anywhere on the planet that there are
 
people. And it would always give them something real,
 
interesting,  and challenging to think about.
 
So I persuaded every student to take a shot at
 
documenting some of the folklore that they either sought out
 
or simply came across in their daily rounds.
 
Some of them elected to choose a particular topic.  I
 
have told this story before,  but it is especially appropriate
 
here,  so please forgive me. A lively student came to me at
 
the end of a semester and said,  "Mrs.  Hawes,  you taught me
 
all about how to collect folklore,  but you never told me how
 
to stop collecting it.  I've been collecting  (hiccup cures?)
 
and this lady lives right next door to me,  and every time I
 
come home she calls me over because she's just remembered
 
another one,  and she waits out on the porch for me.  I
' ve
 
tried to explain to her that this was just a semester project
 
and I'm all through with it,  but she doesn't understand,  and
 
I
' ve begun coming down the back alley to keep from running
 
into her. What should I do?"
 
I had little help for him.  He had,  as I pointed out,
 
gotten his  "A"  for the project; he had done it very well. Now
 
he had to start to work out how to get an equivalent A for
 
his collaborator.  He could explain to her in folkiorese that
 
his
  
interest in hiccup cures had been limited to the spring
 
semester,  so she should locate an appropriate repository for
 
her new materials,  or maybe she should develop further
 
research projects on her own.  But I doubt any of those would
 
have interested her. What she wanted was somebody to talk
 
hiccups with or maybe warts or arthritis or other generally
 
friendly topics.
 
Now this lady was not uneducated or ill-informed.  She
 
undoubtedly had the various nostrums of conventional medicine
 
in her repertoire as well as the traditional ones that
 
interested her.
 
And looking at her data overall,  much of it was quite
 
old -
 a generation or two or even three. Now,  any statement
 
by anybody,  no matter how bizarre,  that has survived over
 
generations without reinforcement by standard schooling,  or
 
by religious doctrine,  or by legal prescription,  deserves at
 
least a second look by social scientists.  Behind these
 
irradicable statements lies a kind of logic,  a certain
 
fitment,  a comfortable kind of authority,  it is no accident
 
I
 
that most traditional cures center Upon Conditions with which
 
Standard western medicine has real difficulty .
 
You see what a tough job it is to be a folklorist
 
trying to think seriously about those things that most of Our
 
culture absolutely refuses to take seriously.
 
Think of the most fatuous childish rhymes you carry in
 
Your heads: maybe "Rain,  rain,  go away" or "1 see London,  i
 
see France" and then think how many
 endlessl
 
v erbal items you
"useful"
 
  
would
 remember,  th
y repeated
 
a t would
 be  really
 
-
-
 your social security number? the date of your
 
spouse's birthday? if "We,  the people" start off the
 
Declaration of Independence or the Constitution? Wouldn't you
 
rather remember any of these than "Star light,  star bright"?
 
When one considers how incessantly and how passionately
 
traditional voices continue to give forth their messages,  it
 
is calamatous how few ears are tuned to their larger
 
meanings.  This is partly because figuring such meaning out  is 
extremely hard work.
 
For by the time several generat ions of transmitters have
 
gotten through Polishing a particular item -
-
 a song,  a
 
riddle,  a tale,  a verse,  a cure,  a Proverb -
-
 -- Passing it on
 
and on past one elegant editor after another -
-
 -
-
 each one
 
has been boiled down to a kind of an intense elixir  
.And
 
fathoming just what has gone into that final  
extrem
ely difficult__ it 
c
 re
omposition is
qu ires the most delicate
 
dissecti
on techniques.
 
That is one reason why archives such as this particular
 
Folklore Archive are important
 Together with other similar
 
files,  such as the major west coast repositories at the
 
Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses of the University of
 
California,  they can all together help establish base lines
 
m

dw
.hich both the normal and the non-normal can be
 
 
I am going on and on about this because i believe that
 
many well-intentioned people totally mis_understand the
 
purposes and therefore the contents of folklore archives.
 
They think of them,  for example,  as a place where you
 
might go to find the printed words to all Woody Guthrie's
 
songs.  But they will probably
 
the people who contributed to
 
the kind of ordinary joes who
 
not be there because most of
 
the CSUN files at least,  were
 
never heard of Woody Guthrie
 
though they might have heard his songs.  Official printed
 
versions of the Guthrie songbag  might much  more likely be
 
found in a music archive.
 
Woody and I were discussing songs one day and I remarked
 
that  I thought that a part of one of his songs had totally
 
passed into the public domain,  that is,  nobody connected it
 
with him or any other songwriter -
-
 it was just what you
 
sang under certain circumstances.  (
I was thinking of the
 
chorus of "Union Maid" -
-
 "Oh you can't scare me,  I
'm
 
sticking to the union" which I have heard spontaneously sung
 
on many a picket line.)  And Woody said to me,"Bess,  that's
 
the greatest honor I'll ever get." Think how few other
 
songwriters would feel that way.
 
And now if we were talking about an historical archive,
 
a single verifiable document may establish an historical
 
fact,  and that is a very important thing to do.  But when
 
using the contents of a folklore archive,  you must remember
 
that the material recorded is simply what somebody -
-
 whoever
 
-
-
 has said that he heard from somebody else.  I should more
 
accurately have said -
-
 somebodies..
 
Now such informal communication may sometimes produce a
 
verbal testament of strong historical interest and
 
importance,  as interesting as the single verifiable
 
historical document.  There are several local poems and songs
 
in this archive that describe or comment on timely events,
 
including the Corrido de la Inundacion de la Presa de San
 
Francisquito  (
the San Francisquito dam break of 1928) .
 The
 
local composer of that ballad makes the terror and horror of
 
the event come alive in ways that no formal study could or
 
would even try to achieve. An eminent historian once remarked
 
to me that there are two kinds of historical truth -
-
 what
 
actually happened,  and what everybody thought  (
or now thinks)
 
happened.  Both,  he commented,  are vital,  especially because
 
what everybody thinks happened will probably lay the basis
 
for the next action.
 
To continue pointing out some of the features of this
 
folklore archive,  its childrens'  section is especially hefty,
 
and if you look into it you may well find several hundred
 
reports from the San Fernando Valley of exactly the same jump
 
rope rhymes - -perhaps "Late last night and the night before,
 
twenty-four robbers come a-knocking at my door" or "Doctor,
 
doctor,  I am ill Send for the doctor over the hill" or "Blue
 
Bells,  cockle shells".  It gets boring after a while.
 
On the other hand,  this is extraordinarily impressive
 
statistical evidence of juvenile preferences,  especially when
 
lined up against the jump rope rhymes only heard once or
 
twice from the same population. And the situation extends
 
beyond California. A gifted writer has remarked that if you
 
stretched a jumprope from Bangor,  Maine to San Diego,
 
California,  all the children along that line will be jumping
 
to the same five or ten rhymes. Now,  there is a piece of hard
 
statistical information that should set young researchers
 
salivating.  But at the same time,  where did the jump rope
 
nonconformists come from and where do they fit in?
 
Other materials in the CSUN student folklore archive
 
include personal recollections of California immigrants from
 
the south and southwest,  reminiscences from African Americans
 
searching for better job opportunities during world war two,
 
casual autobiographies by older entertainment figures,
 
vignettes of family life from rural and urban settings,
 
practical diaries of schoolyard experiences by English and
 
non-English speakers. All of them enrich and enliven our
 
understanding of just how our part of the world became what
 
it is today.  They aren't all properly organized,  neatly
 
printed,  or even correctly spelled.  Some of what's in there
 
is even offensive and vulgar,  enough so you wish you hadn't
 
read it.  Tradition includes all parts of life.
 
And I think my students of twenty/thirty years ago did a
 
marvellous  job of preserving for us the truth and the whole
 
truth as their informants saw it,  and I want to thank each
 
and every one of them right now.  They did the work;  I just
 
tried to keep up with the filing because I couldn't bear to
 
throw all that effort away.  If we had had better control of
 
video and audio techniques,  if I had had the perspective to
 
sit back and think long-range for just a few minutes,  this
 
archive might well have been better.
 
But we did what we could and,  it is what it said it was
 
all along. And what we said and did was honest. And now we
 
can begin to look forward and maybe even decide to try some
 
new ways to improve upon that great old performance.
 
The Anthropology Department of CSUN has recently hired a
 
new folklorist.  What a joy.
 Dr.  Sabina Magliocco has
 
herself taken over responsibility not just for the archive of
 
student folklore that so many of us labored over but the
 
eventual development of a folklore curriculum.  She's added to
 
all this her own research concerns heralding some new
 
archival considerations.
 
So centuries come and centuries go but work and life and
 
teaching and archives go on and on and I'll tell you now,
 
I
'll be right in there with you,  as long as I can keep up.  I
 
apologize for my irrepressible tendency to preach -
-
 I even
 
overheard a Smithsonian staff member say one time,  "Bess
 
doesn't ever let up on you,  does she?"
 And I didn't and I
 
don't,  and I never will.  There's just so much to do and it's
 
so much fun to do it.
 
Well,  let me thank again our remarkable President,
 
Blenda Wilson,  Provost Louanne Kennedy,  Dean Susan Curzon,
 
Dean Bill Flores and Dean Jorge Garcia,  my absolutely
 
irreplaceable daughter,  Dr. Naomi Bishop,  the entire
 
Anthropology Department  faculty and staff -
-
 including its
 
first chair,  Dr.  Edmund Carpenter,  who had the nerve to hire
 
me to begin with,  And then there is Barbara Rahm who marched
 
with me all the way and all those numberless but never to be
 
A
 
forgotten people who have made this happily memorable,
 
optimistic and joyful day possible.  I thank you all,  so much.
 
And now I have the privilege of introducing some old
 
friends of the CSUN faculty -
-
 Fermin Hererra,  his sister
 
Isabel Miranda and son Xocoyotzin who teaches at the Ventura
 
campus.  They will be joined by two other sons,  Andres and
 
Motecuhzoman to make up almost the whole membership of
 
Conjunto Huayapan.  I first heard the marvellous music called
 
jarocho in 1975 and 1976 when Fermin and Isabel and I
 
participated in the Smithsonian Folkljfe festivals of those
 
years.  You would have been so proud to hear those gorgeous
 
sounds ringing across the national mall:  a testament to the
 
complex many-sourced artistic traditions that make America
 
the Beautiful. And now we get to hear them right here.  El
 
Conjunto Huayapan.
