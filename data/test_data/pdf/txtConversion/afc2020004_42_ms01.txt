These Rivers Remember 
 
In these rivers, on these lakes 
Bde-wa’-kan-ton-wan saw the sky. 
North of here lies Bdo-te, 
Center of the Earth.  Through their songs, 
the wind held onto visions. 
We still help earth walk 
her spiral way, feeling 
the flow of rivers 
and their memories of turning  
and change. 
 
Circle on circle supports us. 
Beneath the tarmac and steel in St. Paul, 
roots of the great wood are swelling 
with an energy no one dare betray.  
 
The white cliffs, I-mni-za Ska, 
know the length of Kangi Ci’stin’na’s tears. 
He believed that words spoken 
held truth and was driven into hunger. 
Beneath the cliffs, fireflies flickered 
through wide swaths of grass. 
Oaks grew on savannahs, pleasant 
in the summer winds where deer 
remain unseen.  
 
These rivers remember their ancient names, 
Ha-ha Wa’-kpa, where people moved 
in harmony thousands of years 
before trade became more valuable than lives.  
 
In their songs, the wind held 
onto visions.  Let’s drop our burdens 
and rest.  Let’s recognize our need 
for awe.  South of here, the rivers 
meet and mingle.  Bridges and roads, 
highway signs, traffic ongoing. 
Sit where there’s a center 
and a drum, feel the confluence 
of energies enter our hearts 
so their burning begins to matter. 
 
This is Maka coka-ya kin, 
The Center of the Earth.
