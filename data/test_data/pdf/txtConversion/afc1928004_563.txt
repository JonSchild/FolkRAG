I VAS an honest vorkingmans, und do de best I

Vhen I

Mine vrow at me will stare, yen I

She'll look into mine face, and den viii say, 
Our little Shakey has been so bad off lately 
He broke all de baker's vindows, 'cross de vay. 
And he says he'll git de cop, of, Shakey he don't stob. 
She puts her arms on mine shoulders and Till say, 
CHORUS. 
Sharley, dake do poy across your.knee, 
To-day he's been so very bad, you see. 
Make him go to school, und keeb dot golden rule. 
Now, Sharley, dake de poy across your knee. 
Now dis leedle pop of mine, he's so shentle und so kind, 
He vas alvays blaying " Rock upon de duck." 
Yen he's ond in de day, he's always sure to blay 
Mit all de liddle loafers in de block. 
Den yen he vas on the sdreed, mid every man he meets, 
He fires a 
stone at him, mid runs avay. 
Den de blacksmith will complain, rind says I 
am to blame, 
And den my darling vrow do me viii say, 
Sharley, dake de poy, etc. 
_ 
/- :Now, mine heart is broke, since my Shakey he does smoke; 
He's always on de corner picking stumps. 
You should hear him use dot slang, he's in mit all de gang; 
He's alvays dancing jicks, down on de dump. 
But now he vas so tall, he takes in every ball, 
Also every picnic on do summer's day, 
And my vile is nearly vild, since we lost our leedle schild, 
Und to me now she never more does say, 
Sharley, dake de poy, etc.

SINGING ON THE ROOF. 
Words and Music by ;
JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
Sung by O'NEIL and CONROY. 
Copyrighted, 1819, and published by E. II. HARDING. 
The Music of this song will be sent by us to any address, post paid, on 
receipt of price, 10 cents. 
THERE'S sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside ; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHORUS. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together ; 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, ete. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
-With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
" 
It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was 0, sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, eto. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
• 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And till the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. 
Singing, etc.

HIGH WATER PANTS. 
LITTLE RED-HEADED LIZZIE. 
Sung by O'NEIL and CON110Y. 
3Iv name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
I'm an Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in the tree. 
But the gang that stands on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
They shout out whenever I'm passing, 
" 
There is O'Brien with his High Water Pants." 
CII0RUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the High Water Pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan ; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nigger came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and conundrum 
About O'Brien with his High Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc. 
T'other night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock, 
We thought we'd drop into Geoghan's 
For a 
glass of his Rye and Rock. 
When the gang says there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bartender shot me a 
glance; 
Hold your tongue, says he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his High Water Patit3 
They tell me.to go over, etc. 
Written and Sung with great success by CHARLEY KONOLLMAN, the 
celebrated Dutch Star C03111(1110.

Ven der man vat kept der blace vas cross der vay. 
Yen I

In society to show l'd peen pefore, 
So I

girl vas dbrinking sherry cobbleshtonee, 
And purdy soon vent shkipping oud der door. 
Dey vas blaying awful purty kind ov moosic; 
Dere vas valzes, bolkas, succotaches, too ; 
Per first ting vas a " solo by a 
quartette," 
Und der nexd vas somevon's " sympathy in Q." 
Bud der besd ding dat I 
saw blayed in my lifetime 
Vas someting dat I'm going to relate; 
It vas hlaying ov a 
lettle game or " poker," 
Yen a 
fellow blayed two pair I 
had a " shtraight." 
I 
slitayed at dat concert purty latish. 
Till der hour ov ten shtruck twelve upon der clock; 
My key- hole it couldn't find my night- key, 
Und my house vas blayina tag around der block. 
My boarding-house keeper vas looking oud der vinder, 
It vas yust so shtill you couldn't drop a 
pin, 
'Vett a 
great big man, mit shield mid club like so big, 
Came and said, " he thought he'd haf to take me in. 
Now, I 
nexd pefore der judge vas prougbt ub shtanding, 
Alit two bolicemen py me all der time ; 
Yen der julv,e said to me, " Vat's your abbelation 1" 
I

He wrode dat on a 
gread big sliced ov baber, 
Und den dat kind judae to me did say : 
"Hans, you ao ub to der Island ; it's so bleasant, 
Und shtay dere yust three veeks vront to day." 
Und I 
said, " Justice, don't you tink dat's blayed oud, 
Vat you send me to der Island riabt avay 1 
Here's der man vat keeps der hoarding house I

Viii shvare him dot I

Und dot he alvays thought me kinder crazy ; 
So Justice, von't you blease to think twain '1" 
But der judge righd on dat point vas lefel headed,

So I

But I

Or can haf a

Und all dis came or going to der " Garden,"

SARA BERNHARDT. 
Written and composed by CHAS. KONOLLMAN, the popular Comique, 
and sung with immense success at the New National Theatre, New 
York; also sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE other night while strolling out down the Sixth 
Avenue' 
'Twas there that I 
saw something which was, to me, quite 
new; 
The people seemed all crazy about an actress of renown, 
She surely is the queerest woman who ever can be found, 
CHORUS. 
For they call her Sara Bernhardt, 
The crazy actress from over the sea, 
But, for all, the people flock to see her, 
On the stage spouting Parlee Fransee. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
Her dresses are the latest styles which ever can be had, 
And they say she is a 
flirt, which really is too bad ; 
On all the men she is mashed, that's plainly to be seen, 
Although she is a 
daisy that's tall, lank and lean. 
For they call her, etc. 
Now as Sara is in New York, and will soon be out 
Among the bon ton society, of which I 
have no doubt, 
Many a 
heart she'll surely break, if she only gets the 
chance, 
Therefore, kind friends, take my advice, and send her 
back to France. 
For they call her, etc. 
We've got some handsome women here, to that you'll all 
agree, 
Far prettier and much better than those across the sea ; 
For there is Fanny Davenport, who was born on our own 
shore, 
With Clara Morris or Kate Claxton, and a 
dozen more, 
CHORUS. 
Now, my darling Sara Bernhardt, 
Take this advice from me, you see, 
Go right back to your own country 
And let the New York people be. 
(Repeat ChOrUS.)

SCENES of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of bygone happy days. 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam; 
No one's left to cheer me now within that good old home. 
Father and mother they have passed away, 
Sister and brother now lay beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain to cheer me I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Only a 
violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And ofttimes when I'm sad at heart, this flow'r has given 
me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memoriam I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave. 
Well I 
remember my dear old mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil ; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair. 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there, 
But now all is silent around the good old home; 
They all have left me in sorrow here to roam; 
While life does remain in memoriam I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave. 
Only a 
violet, etc.

THE LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Music published, and Copyright, 187'9, by J. Cuenca & Co. Words by 
Wm. CARLETON. 
Music by J. K. Emmrr and sung by him in " Fritz hi Ireland." 
THREE little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stein ; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above. 
Oh ! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh do you love, oh ! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Elfin kings can tell ; 
Love, Truth, and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil so well, 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew, 
Oh ! the shamrock, etc. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love ; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh ! the shamrock, etc.

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH, 
By GEORGE ILOET. 
Tun first thing that I 
remember was Carlo tugging away, 
With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling as much as 
to say : 
" 
Come, master, awake, and tend to the switch, lives now del 
pend upon you, 
Think of the souls in the coming train and the graves you're 
sending them to ; 
Think of the mother and babe at her breast, think of the 
father and son, 
Think of the lover, and loved- one, too, think of them doomed 
every ,one 
To fall, as it were, by your very hand, into yon fathomless 
dit ch, 
Murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now 
lies asleep at the switch." 
I 
sprang up amazed, scarce knew where I 
stood, sleep had o'er 
mastered me so ; 
I 
could hear the wind hollowly howling and the deep river (lashing 
t. 
below, 
I 
could hear the forest leaves rustling as the trees by the tem-
pest were fanned, 
But what was that noise at, a 
distance ? 
That—I 
could not 
understand 
I 
heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled 
drum, 
Then nearer and nearer it came to me, and made my very ears 
hum; 
What is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to 
my brain ? 
What whistle's that yelling so shrilly ! 
Oh, God ! I 
know now 
--it's the train. 
(I)

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.—Continued. 
We often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to 
the place ; 
So I 
stood with this demon before me, its heated breath scorch-
ing my face, 
Its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the 
eyes of some witch ; 
The train was almost upon me, before I 
remembered the switch. 
I 
sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the traia dashing fast down the 
track, 
The switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it 
back ; 
On, on, came the fiery-eyed monster and shot by my face like a 
flash ; 
I 
swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing 
after the crash. 
How long I 
laid there unconscious, were impossible for me to 
tell, 
My stupor was almost a 
heaven, my waking almost a 
hell— 
For I 
then beard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands 
and wives, 
And I 
thought of the day we all shrink from, when I 
must ac-
count for their lives ; 
Mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes staring madly , 
and wild; 
Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a 
child ; 
Children searching for parents, I 
noticed, as by me they sped, 
And lips that could form naught but " Mamma," were calling 
for one perhaps dead. 
My mind was made up in a 
second, the river should hide me 
away; 
When, under the still burning rafters, I 
suddenly noticed there 
lay 
taa4eiiiireeir,

'Id 
19 
ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.—Conoluded. 
A 
little white hand, she who owned it was doubtless an object 
of love 
To one whom her loss would drive frantic, tho' she guarded him 
now from above ; 
I 
tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side ; 
How little she thought of her journey, when she left for this last 
fatal ride ; 
I 
lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some 
spark of life, 
Turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized— 
Maggie, my wife! 
Oh, Lord! Thy scourge is a 
hard one, at a 
blow Thou hast 
shattered my pride ; 
My life will be one endless nighttime, with Maggie away from 
my side ; 
How often we've sat down and pictured the scenes in our long 
happy life ; 
How I'd strive through all of my life-time to build up a 
home 
for my wife. 
How people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little 
nest, 
When I 
would do all of the labor, and Maggie should all the 
day rest ; 
How one of God's blessings might cheer us, when some day I 
p'r'aps should be rich, 
But all of my dreams have been shattered, while I 
lay there 
asleep at the switch. 
I 
fancied I 
stood on my trial, the jury and judge I 
could see, 
And every eye in the court room was steadfastly fixed upon 
me; 
And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I 
felt my face blushing 
blood- red, 
And the next thing I 
heard were the words, " Hung by the 
neck until dead." 
Then I 
felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught 
tight hold of a 
dress, 
And I 
heard, " What's the matter, dear Jim 1 You've had a 
bad night-mare I 
guess." 
And there stood Maggie my wife with never a 
scar from the 
ditch, 
I'd been taking a 
nap in my bed and had not been asleep at 
the switch,

A ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
Originally sung by the swell comedians, NILES and EvANs. 
Am.—" Blue Alsatian Mountains." 
IN 
a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair; 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing! 
Just to hear that maiden sing. 
Oh, he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog ; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurra ! hurra ! hurra ! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his t:ousers - - 
For the dog to chew that day. 
A TRAMP. 
A RECITATION. 
As recited by CHARLES DunKE, of CAMPBELL & BURKE, with 
great success. 
LEMmE sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your eussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to 
you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no 
good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think 
we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes; 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en- -
yes, and a 
good one, too ; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and 
fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of ' ern suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him--I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill ; 
Mother she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's 
will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's 
side, 
Fill'd with a 
raring fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to 
drink. 
Gimme one glass, Camel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the 
Judgment Day. 
BEECHER'S BREAD AND WATER PLAN. 
5ong dedicated to the working men of our country, by T. C. 
AIR.—" What the Old Cocksparrow Said." 
I 
SAT me down to rest and read the other day, 
And judge of my amazement and surprise, - 
In glancing at the news, I 
was stricken with dismay, 
When a 
paragraph appeared before my eyes, 
In which the moral preacher, the sanctimonious Beecher, 
Avows that each and every workingman 
Are only fit to die, because they will not try 
To live upon the bread and water plan. 
I 
hung my head with shame, a 
tear unbidden came, 
Great God I 
I 
cried, is this American, 
Must we toil with hand and brain, in sunshine and in rain 
To be fed. upon the bread and water plan ? 
Net many years ago, in our broad and fruitful land, 
Such sentiments as Beecher's would not pass ; 
But look around you now, and you'll find on every band 
A 
purse-proud and aristocratic class. 
Go up to Central Park, some evening just at dark, 
The stockholder sits behind his blooded span, 
Yet we must not stop to think, or a 
glass of beer to drink, 
But be fed upon the bread and water plan. 
Why don't they hang a 
bone upon a 
telephone ? 
Since feeding now by " culture " they've began, 
With a 
smell three times a 
day, I'm sure we'd feel 0. K., 
And it's cheaper than the bread and water plan. 
Now Henry Ward declares, education's thrown away, 
If bread will not sustains us in this life ; 
In short, he'd have us live on three meals of it a 
day, 
Aid on it feed six children and a 
wife, 
And soon ' twill come to pass, they'll feed us on blue glass, 
Since science is a 
never-failing cure, 
And true inwardness and gush, ragged edge and Ply-
mouth slush, 
Will satisfy our wants and keep us pure ; 
Hallelujah I 
let us pray, give praise each night and day, 
The time has come when every workman 
May bid farewell to care, and live on sumptuous fare, 
With Brother Beecher's bread and water plan. 
THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DixoN, at the San Francisco Minstrels. 
" 
THE fisherman and his child are drowned 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around. 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
" 
Oh, God ! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
see." 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
crioRts. 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard, 
As they sank in the deep : 
" 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep ; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep." 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild ; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair : " Thy will be done ! " 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore ; 
The tile had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, -
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS. " 
Written by JAMES CAMPBELL, and delivered by O'NEIL and CoNaar, 
with shouts of laughter and applause. 
MRS. MALONEY had a 
cat, and a 
female cat was she, 
Her voice it was a 
soprano, and she sung in the key of G. 
Oh, it was my delight, of a 
starry night, when coming 
home from a 
ball, 
To hear her singing " We met by chance," on the top of 
M'aloney's wall. 
I 
know she went up as high as " G," and sometimes she 
went higher, 
And the way she dwelt on the very last note, you'd think 
she was hollering fire ! 
I 
really think she could say the word fire ! but still I'll 
not swear to that, 
For I 
wouldn't like to make a 
liar of Mrs. Maloney's cat. 
Now, old Mrs. McFadden, she had a 
Tom (a 
cat I 
mean 
by that name), 
And he called Mrs. Maloney's cat a 
most disrespectful 
name. 
Maloney's cat cried out, " You're another!" then Mc-
Fadden 'S 
loudly did bawl, 
" 
You sucker, send out your big brother, or come your-
self over the wall. 
I'll wrestle you, collar and elbow, I'll throw you as quick 
as a 
rat ! " 
"Arrah, don't be getting your back up ! 
say Mrs. 
Maloney's cat. 
Now, Jerry McGill had a 
ball dog, and Jerry, he lived in 
the rear, 
And the bull dog was lean, lank, and hungry, and divil 
a 
cat did he fear ; 
Now, Jerry, he called his dog " Boney," says he " Now, 
I'll bet a 
new bat, 
If I 
leave off his chain and his muzzle, he'll make sausage-
meat out of them cats." 
One night (it was dark and dreary, and the (Evil a 
star 
in the sky), 
Boney had off his chain and his muzzle, and he laid for 
the cats on the sly. 
(1 ) 
WRESTLE OF THE CATS.—Concluded. 
Now, the cats, they met in the hallway, and they wrestled 
clean out to the yard, 
The first hold was " collar and elbow," and their breath-
ing was terrible hard ; 
Then they both tried " Grreco Roman ;" you couldn't 
tell who got first fall, 
And Boney was acting as referee in the shade of the gar-
den wall. 
They howled, and they spit, and they sputtered, and the 
blood from their noses ran, 
Says Boney " I'll take a new hoult, I'll wrestle them 
catch, catch, can." 
Then, like lightning he sprang in amongst them, 
In his jaws he had one by the back, 
Such a 
yell was ne'er heard in that quarter, 
As came from Maloney's poor cat. 
McFadden cat fought like a 
tiger, 
But Boney's strength didn't him fail 
With a 
twist of his jaws, like a 
general, 
He bit off McFadden's cat's tail. 
Oh, the howling, and yelling, and growling of the dog 
and the cats filled the air, 
And the windows all round in the barracks flew open 
everywhere. 
Heads with night-caps of old men and old women and 
children, poked out in the dark, 
They thought that the house was on fire ; or the divil 
was out on a 
lark ; 
They tried to look out in the darkness where the noise 
came from, down by the wall, 
And thinking sonic one was being murdered, they loud 
for the police did bawl. 
Then they came out in droves and in dozens, 
The children, old women and men, 
With candles, with lamps, and with matches, 
But ah ! what a 
sight met them then— 
McFadden, and Mrs. Maloney, 
They sorefully shook their night-caps, 
To see INIcGill's bull clog, old Boney, 
Holding a 
wake over the two defunct cats.

OH, 
FRED, 
TELL THEM TO STOP ! 
Sung by SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the great Fancy Fair 
That used to take place ey'ry day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in, you must know, and saw Richardson's show, 
And Womb 
well's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings, and all kinds of things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPORT:N.—Yes. when we got into the Fair m:y girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the roundabouts. I 
said, 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing ; but di-
rectly the swing went to and fro she lustily called out — 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop !" 
that was the cry of 
Maria; 
But the more she said " Wo," they said " Let it go," 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood 'round, of course they all laugh'd, 
But I 
only said, ' Stop the swing." 
There were four or five others in the boats besides us, 
Saying-, " Master, don't do such a 
thing," 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, " The young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree." 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop," etc. 
They soon stopped the swing, and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor ; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought her 
to— 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there, to the great Fancy Fair, 
Friends, take advice whilst I 
sing 
Of ..the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN. —.Mark, now, before you go into the swing 
boat make a 
bargain with your young lady not to call 
out-
4' "Thh, Free ' ell them to stop-" eta.

AUCTIONING OFF THE CLOTHES. 
Written, Composed and Sung by FRANK CAMPBELL. 
LAST veek I 
got notice, 
Of an auction for some clothes, 
It vos over here in Hester street, 
At Solomon J. Rinloes. 
Dere vos de Isaacs, Leveys and their wives, 
Standing there in rows, 
To vatch de price, und bid so nice, 
And try to buy de clothes. 
CHORUS. 
Ara ga soehta, hosdo gasane, 
Dat is vat dey say, 
It looked so fine to see de line 
Of Jews in such array. 
I 
never smole so loudly, 
In all my live-long life, 
As looking at Solomon Isaacs 
Buying an ulster for his wife. 
At nine o'clock in de morning 
De auctioneer he came, 
He jumped upon de counter, 
Ye thought he vos insane; 
He said, for God's sake, stop dat noise, 
Yen some von broke his nose, 
He called a 
cop, to make them stop, 
Vile auctioning off de clothes. 
Ara ga sochta, etc. 
At three o'clock in de afternoon, 
De auction it vos over, 
Von hundred thousand Sheeneys 
Lay dead upon de floor. 
Old Rinloes he got staven drunk, 
Some sucker stole de stove, 
Ye had a 
fight de -whole long night, 
After auctioning off de clothes. 
Ara ga sochta, etc.

A

Tho' daily we enough do sea 
To keep us on tip- toe, 
Another new sensation now, 
Would help along the show. 
CHORUS. 
What will the next sensation be, 
Can anybody say ? 
What will the next sensation be, 
To drive our brains astray ? 
We've had a 
monster civil war, 
And settled it with peace ; 
We've had a 
big Centennial fair 
To show our great increase ; 
We've had a 
first-class railway strike, 
Which caused some blood to flow; 
We've had dull times, too, quite enough, 
And really wish they'd go. 
What will the next, etc.

We've had enough potato bugs 
To swallow our whole land ; 
We've had the wonders of blue glass 
Explain'd to us quite grand ; 
We struck oil, too, once 'pon a

And rich some folks did grow ; 
We've had folks married, then divorced, 
All in a

What will the next, etc. 
We're used to horrid murders now, 
And great bank robb'ries too, 
Surprise no more can they create, 
For they are nothing new; 
And as for railway accidents 
We can a

And ranting politicians, too, 
Who love their horns to blow. 
What will the next, etc. 
We've walkers fast, female and male, 
All champions, too, they're called, 
While ' Whoa, Emma," and all such E.engs, 
In doors and out, are bawled. 
Choice dogs and cats and babies, too, 
We've had up for a

On, come, my darling, ' tis just the hour,

Come, my love, arid gayly dance around. 
Come, kiss me, darling—I

Two pretty little arms that round my neck entwine, 
Two ruby lips, my love, that warmly kiss, my love ; 
Two pretty eyes of azure blue like thine.

Copyright, 1880, by Mrs. PAULINE LIEDER. 
MY name is McNamara, I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hiils, the lakes and rip-
pling rills 
Are singing sweetest music all the day ; 
Our little farm was small, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home; 
I 
bid them all good-bye, with a 
teardrop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
CHORUS. 
I am an honest Irish lad, of work I'm not afraid; 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will -sing or dance; 
I'll do anything you say if you'll only name the day 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York I 
tried hard to get work, 
And I 
travelled through the streets from day to day ; 
I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help they say ; 
But still I 
wandered on, a-hoping to find one 
That would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But then it's all the same, for I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And oftentimes I 
wished that I 
was dead. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, etc. 
But I 
know I've one kind friend who will lend a 
helping 
hand 
To a 
poor boy and to help him on at home; 
I 
will bring my mother here and my little sister dear, 
And never more again from them to roam; 
I 
will try to do what's right, I 
will work both night and 
day, 
Yes, I'll do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart that will take a 
poor boy's 
part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man. 
I 
apx an honest Irish lad, eke.

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
clays. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my menfry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

Music published and Copyrighted 1S79, by J. Cuunen & Co. 
Written by J. K. EMMET, and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
THE castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The last faint gleam of parting day 
Still lights the hills and gilds the tower, 
Ere night lets fall her mantle gray. 
CHORUS. 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
The bells are ringing 
Over the forest and lea; 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
Glad tones are flinging 
Far o'er the slumbering sea. 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The birds fly homeward to their nest, 
And night comes on with magic power 
Hushing the world to dreamless rest. 
Softly, slowly, etc. 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
And soon again morn's rosy beam 
Will fall on tree and dew-kissed flower, 
Waking the wood, and mount, and stream. 
Softly, slowly, etc.

THERE is a 
great sensation about a 
word you hear nowa-
days, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's all about going to the 
Matinees ; 
You can hear them say to each other, when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the mat 
this aff ? " 
CHORUS. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff ? " `! Not this aff, 
some other aff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff ? " " Not this aff; " 
" 
Then good-aff." 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff ?" " Not this aff, 
some other aff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff ? " " Not this aff ; " 
" 
Then good-all." 
By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broadway, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at me 
and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going to 
the mat this aff ? " 
Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things out 
to-day; 
she'll say, " Don't waste your breath talking, we've heard 
the best and last— 
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the mat 
this aft'?" 
Are you going to the mat, etc.

BANNER SONG. 
Written and sung by Gus Wrmamut. 
THERE is a 
foreign country proudly resting from its strife, 
That is miclity on the land or on the sea ; 
Its sons are true to freodom, to justice and to right, 
And its rec -nd is a 
brio.lit one, you'll agree ;" 
I 
sin 'T 
of that old country, of the dear old Fatherland, 
That is precious to its sons o'er all the earth ; 
And its memory will grow dearer when they oft and proudly 
think, 
That to Frederick the Great, their land crave birth. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, 
It waves o'er good and true, 
Long may it float in peace, beside 
.The Red, th 
White and Blue. 
Music—" Die Waeht dem Ithine." 
There is a 
little island that is known unto you all, 
And its banner I'll unfurl unto your gaze ; 
A bright and glorious emblem that you'll recognize at once, 
As the banner of its bright and better days ; 
The sunburst and the shamrock shall yet over them prevail, 
In that dear little isle across the sea, 
A.nd no power of might or right shall dare that flag assail, 
For in time that little isle shall be set free. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, 
And blessed be every fold, 
Her sons shall spread it to the breeze, 
As powerful as of old. 
Music—" The Harp that once through Tara's Hall.'' 
There is another country that I 
now will sing about, 
And I'm sure you'll colnci(le with what I 
say ; 
She has helped our nation nobly, when she needed help the 
most, 
But her glorious sons have now all passed away; 
Although beaten in the late war, she will be herself again, 
And show the world how great then she can be ; 
No king or queen shall rule her, no matter what they say, 
For like America she will be free! 
Then here's the National Standard,, 1 
That now floats over France, 
Her Government is wide awake, 
And keen as any lance. 
Music. —" 
Marsiflaise hymn."

BANNER SONG.—Continued. 
There's another little island that is struggling to be free, 
,From the tyrants and oppressors who rule there ; 
She's an honor to the New World, and an ornament beside., 
But her troubles, they are more than she can bear'; 
her oppressors are a 
brutal set who do not recognize 
The law which God has given to us all, 
But murder and cold butchery they deal to every one, 
And that little isle for help does on us call. 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, 
Down trodden though she be, 
But Uncle Sam will soon send aid, 
And give her liberty. 
Music—" Cuba Shall be Free." 
There is a 
foreign country far beyond the rolling sea, 
With its castles and its power on every band ; 
It has great men in its cormeils, and of good men not a 
lack, 
And a 
language that we all can understand ; 
She's a great and mighty nation, though her faults we can't 
ignore, 
But the founder of our Union came from there; 
So while we honor her great power and her noble sons of toil, 
Yet we trust our love of justice she will share. 
Then here's the flag of England, 
And while it long shall wave, 
May we ne .er fail to love the land, 
That to us Shakespeare gave, 
Music.—" God Save the Queea.". 
There is still another country that is dear to every man, 
WI e 
should love his brother ever as he ought ; 
It spreads the name of Liberty, where there is human life, 
'Tis the flag that was with blood of heroes bought; 
Her doors are always open to the suffering and oppressed, 
Who may there in peace and plenty speed the right ; 
Her defenders are the patriots, who of freedom know the cost, 
For the banner they will ever gladly fight. 
Then here's our National Embleni, 
The Flag that Freedom. won, 
And those beneath it dearly love 
The Laud of Washington.

EMMET'S CUCKOO SONG. 
Music published, and Copyright, 1879, by J. Cum= & Co. Words by 
W M. CARLETON. 
Tlusic by J. K. EanIET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
! 
hear the cuckoo call ! 
Oh ! hear him calling now ! 
Cuckoo! cuckoo! 
I 
hear you call, I 
hear you call, 
Hear the cuckoo call, 
Oh ! hear, he's calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose, 
Wave in the valleys green, 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows, 
Oh ! sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The birds do sing with a 
merry trill, 
Their glad. notes sound clear through the green 
woodland bowers, 
But the cuckoo's song is so sad still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies, etc.

As we go jogging on, boys.

And care not if he choose to plague its with his arts ; 
If e'er the fair are cold, we'll win them if we're bold, 
So let us laugh at love, boys.

So let us happy, be and jolly, gay, and free,

My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
I 
kept rather close to the Ivan, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor. 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, ete. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile.

In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I

They say she is farse, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean.

You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in

In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep; oh I 
break it not, my Jean; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh 
then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh! Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

FUNNY SIGHTS. 
Viro2ds by FRANK Dumoxr. Sung by Tom WARFIELD. 
I'VE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, 
I'll tell you of the funny sights I've seen these many 
years; 
I 
saw a 
bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag, 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
I 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
saw an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin ride a 
horse, 
Or see a 
steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase .a 
flea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen a 
hog whose head was bald, around his head , he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
saw a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank some old benzine I 
saw a 
thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe, and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing-gloves standing on his head, 
A 
dish cloth drink a 
pail of milk, and a 
lobster that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on his ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever 
saw, 
I' remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper without any teeth chewing a 
bale of 
hay.

DAR'S heaps of trouble on de old man's mind— 
Come, darkevs, weep wid me, 
My Mary Ann's run away wid a

And he's black, he's black as he can be. 
But I 
wouldn't care if he was only yellow, 
But he's black all o'er ; lit!'s porter in a

And my heart it is tore, when I

coon; 
Mary's gone wid a 
coon , 
Heaps of trouble on de old man's mind, 
Since Mary's gone wid a 
coon. 
Oh ! I 
never thought, when I 
raised (Tat child, 
Of de trouble she would be to me ; 
She had everything dat her heart could wish, 
She was raised in ttie lap of luxury ; 
And I 
never for a 
moment suspected 
Bat dat she'd reflected, before she selected 
A man more respected, more highly connected, 
Less darkly complected, and not have dejected, 
Dis old man's mind with trouble like dis. 
Mary's gone, etc. 
Now all you people who have children to raise, 
Take warning at my fate ; 
Watch over dem carefully, or else you'll find, 
Like me, dat you have been too late, 
For girls are wild when dey're iii deir teens ; 
Dey're always after beaux, and wearing good clothes, 
And going to shows, and no one knows' 
All de troubles and woes, from a 
parent's heart flows— 
It's enough to break dis old man's heart. 
Mary's gone, etc.

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT ." 
Written by BENI. D. 
CoLnuss. 
Sung by Gus NVInni.utii. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the etors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear . 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yah I 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "Tv?, the king," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home."
