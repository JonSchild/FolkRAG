In a 
thatch covered cot at the bend of the road, 
That leads to the far distant town; 
A 
mother sits singing her baby to sleep, 
For the sun it is fast going down. 
And the baby's bright eyes are heavy with sleep, 
Still a 
white chubby arm fondly clings 
'Round that tired mother's neck, as she rocks to and 
fro, 
And this old fashioned lullaby sings. 
Cnonus. 
Bye-low, baby Bunting, 
Papa's gone gone athunting, 
To get a 
little rabbit skin, 
To wrap his baby in. 
Now the twilight's gray shadows, are shading the day, 
And the hills wear a 
sun-gilded crest, 
The mother stops singing, sweet smiles light her face, 
And the babe lifts its head from her breast. 
An echoing footfall is heard drawing near, 
The door opens wide, baby springs 
Into papa's strong arms that will hold baby close, 
To his heart v,hile for baby he sings.

Only a

And whisper of love fond and true. 
Together we roamed in the woodland, 
And down by the brook's mossy shore, 
We vow'd by this dear little flow'r, 
To love and be true evermore. 
Cuonus. 
Only a 
little flower, 
That tells of our love fond and true 
Oh, dearly this sweet little flower, 
I 
cherish in menfry of you. 
Only a 
sweet little flower, 
When sad and lone gives me cheer; 
What matter tho' now it is faded, 
To me it will ever be dear. 
'When far, far away from you darling, 
And longing your sweet face to see, 
It fills me with hope for the morrow, 
And tells that you're faithful to me.

From the heart of the land that I 
love.

While out in the country last summer, 
I 
met lovely Maud in the lane, 
My heart was at once captivated, 
I 
sighed to behold her again. 
At twilight she'd wander to meet me, 
Then stories of love I'd relate, 
The hours were so sweet, my joy it was complete, 
Down by the rose-garden gate. 
Cnouns. 
Down by the rose-garden gate, .10,u(1, 
Fondly for you I 
will wait, 
The bright stars will shine, and I'll call you mine, 
Down by the rose-garden gate. 
Her smile was lika beautiful sunshine, 
Her eyes were like stars in the sky, 
called her my fairest and dearest, 
nd vowed that for her I 
would die, 
lingered with Ii es in the woodland, 
As gay as the bird r. ith its mate, 
And close by her side I 
called her my bride, 
Down by the rose- garden gate. 
Chorus 
sweet -2famd is my own now forever, 
Oh ! she is the dearest and best, 
With h 
arts that are true to each other, 
Our fa me will ever be blest. 
;Aid oft while the twilight is failing, 
Still there for her coin ing I 
We it, 
We linger awhile, where bright in calories smile, 
Down by the r 
se-g

Straying by the meadow brook, 
All by chance we met,

All in sweet and pleasant chat, 
If be took her hand that day 
Tell me what of that ? 
ah, ah, alt 
Side by side beneath the leaves, 
Oh, ' twas joy to be ! 
Fragrance of the ripened sheaves, 
Wandered o'er the lea.

While alone tley quiet sat, 
If their lips met once or twice, 
Tell me what of that ? 
Repeat last five lines first verse. 
Roaming in the sunset light, 
Homeward by the brook; 
Robins sang their sweet good-night, 
From each leafy nook. 
If his love he does confess, 
Ere the wicket gate they're at, 
If she softly answered ' yes," 
Tell me what of that ? 
Repent last five lines first verse.

My days were linked like tiny flowers, 
With home and friends to prize and lore me.

I 
wish those days were back again, 
Days that brought no cloud or sorrow, 
Repining now in weary pain, 
I

When love I 
dreamed would last forever! 
Ere hopes, like flowers in Autumn rain, 
And treasure.I joys began to sever, 
'Vet, like the birds that wandered by, 
Unheeded glide the hours of gladness, 
'Till gone at last, we can but sigh, 
And murmur in repining sadness.

THE OLD LOCI- CABIN ON THE HILL 
Witten hr 
' RANK Dc-mosT, and sung byr HARRY WoOkideg 
with great sucmis at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the i•olith, among the caaon fields, 
s 
the place I 
ever long to see, 
Oh ! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory- 
is ever dear to toe; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing ia the trees close lay, 
While far from the spot I 
now :;oton, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
'Dien I 
sigh night and day, I 
long to see again 
is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the onesI love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my htart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh I 
the old man ain't what he used to he; 
Ind the magnolias bloom around the cabin deer, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
01-
1-i I 
will go back again, back • to them ecrtten Selde, 
in that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, eta 
k'VE just been learning, the lesson of 6fe, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving ; 
ktiel all that's left of the bright, bright dream, 
With its thousand and briniziht ' grazes, 
Is a 
l.aiaful of dust, in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies, 
beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
tind thus forever throughout this wide world, 
Is love a 
sorrow proving. 
There are still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the ka,
.1(lcst of all is 1.)vilif; 
Vhe life of some is worse than Death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
And far Letter than ilfe with two heart. 
zj 
Is a 
low grave starr'd with daisies, 
The beaut ful, linutiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies.. 
And so tL b<Ater we lif'd as we did, 
The summer of J
OV(.3 together, 
And that one (it us tircd and lay down to resi 
Ere tht; coming 
intry weather; 
For the sadclt of love is love grown cold, 
And 
one a' _ LS surest phases, 
So I 
bless my _ot, r..i•ough with breaking hearty 
For that grave enstfom d 
with daisies, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisitA, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
Originally composed by CHARLES A. 
SAvILLs, and sung with great 
success in .
re leading theatres in America. 
I 
went to Greenwood yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I. knelt beside the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave; 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow' 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
CHORUS: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And 
only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon T 
found I 
was not welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
lid roam; 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save 
Is this little leaf of 
A 
leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave. 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home; 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above. 
Where well ne'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endleSS love. 
(Chorus).

With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sounds so wild would in days of childhood 
Fling round my cradle their magic spell ; 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And then grow fonder, sweet Cork of thee ; 
With thy bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine ; 
While at a 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught like thine; 
For inem .ry dwelling, on each proud swelling 
Of thy belfry, knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the bells of Shaudou sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling " Old Adrain's mole" in, 
Their thunders rolling from the Vatican, 
With cymbals glorious, swinging uprorious, 
In the Ezorgeous turrets of Notre Dame ; 
But ihy sounds more sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Fags o'er the Tiber. paling solemnly.

BABY DIED ONE YEAR AGO TO-DAY. 
Compliments of M. O'REARDON to N D 
BARRY, and sang by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comiqut,, 
N. Y. 
Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow: 
ici'or on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago; 
A 
tender bud so beautiful, 
(.1,o 
fragile, pure and fair; 
Its fragrance tar too sweet to waste, 
On earth's sintainted air; 
Through many sad, long hours of pain, 
My precious darling ; 
Then God in sweet compassion took, 
My little one away; 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
his lifeless form was placed; 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
enottus: 
Baby died one year ago to- day, 
Baby died one year ago to-day; 
Baby died, Baby died, 
Baby died one year ago to-day. 
In meek submission low, 
I 
bowed to God's allwise decree ; 
lie only took unto himself, 
The one he gave to me; 
And yet 1 
never see a 
babe, 
But scalding tears will start; 
And longingly I 
crave to clasp, 
My lo4 one to my' heart; 
If 1, my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns; 
I'd ft ,4k to dwell with Angel babes, 
Ever singing Heavenly strains; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow; 
For on this day my baby died, 
This day one year ago. 
THE BRIDGE, 
I 
STOOD on the bridge at midnight, 
As thc clocks were striking, the hour: 
And Lie moon rose o'er the city, 
11w, dark church-tower. 
And, liko : ix waters rushing 
Ai flung 
wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That 1liid my eyes with tears— 
How ('n,qi, oh ! how often,

1111.d ;,lood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And ga7ed on that wave and sky 
How ()lion, oil! hew 0)ften,

I 
had goo:. on that bridge, at midnight, 
And 
thaL. wave and sky ! 
How often, (-;
Ii ! how often, 
I 
ha...6 wished that that ebbing tide 
Would bear me away on its bosoms, 
O'er the ocean wild and wide ! 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care: 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear— 
But now it has fallen from me, 
IS 
buied in the 6%; 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me; 
Yet, whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocesa, 
Comes the thought of other year': 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes. 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear 
As the symbol of love in Heaven 
Andiits wavering image here.

From the rich man who rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch in the street; 
Now a 
man though he's poor and in tatters and 'rap, 
We should never affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, remember my friend, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There the rich man with thousands to spare if ne Chan% 
But he haughtily holds up his head, 
And thinks he's above the met:name who toils, 
And is honestly earning his bread; 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take along. 
To the world.up above when he dies, 
For death levels, all and conclusively shows, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one site. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
That covers a 
brave manly heart, 
But because he's not dressed like his neighbor in silk; 
Society keeps them apart: 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls them both to the grave, 
And six feet of earth makes both men of one sit& 
When e'er you see a 
poor fellow that tries 
To buttle the world and its frowns, 
Let's help him along, and perchance he'll suceeed, 
Don't crush him and still push him down, 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given, 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We're all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of .me sta

remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stroam, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear. 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before. 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, &c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by sae, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhila,

Then all our trouble and sorrow begun.

THE IRISH INVITATION. 
Words and Music by Tim ROGER& 
Goon-EN k,:ciso, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
call, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning, 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my 
little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed 
green 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen, 
it will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen, 
dnd I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHORUS. 
We will dance (sym.), and we will sing (
sym.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation, 
Now, kiddies, don't you fail, we will have a 
keg of ale, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me? 
Then I 
will drive away all care and aggravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have memo Ina, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
We will dance (
ctn.), etc.

Just Because I 
Am Irish. 
iftten and composed by Jon s MCVEIGH, and sung with iinmensr 
success by Des M CCARTHY, the great Irish vocalist and dance, 
Music by T. F. 
KERRIGAN, the celebrated Piper. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A.

FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, 
Y. 
Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just ecause I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Ilan because I 
am Irish they would give Inc AG work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast tpon diem 
In America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly tight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is ever 
-pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy; I 
know, 
Inn admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chones.)

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my -
first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants, 
Chk,rus 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowers', 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. - 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried. there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
llowld your tongues " 
then said be to the loafers. 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

BOYS, LEAVE DRINK ALONE! 
sVritten by JAMES LARKIN for Nan BARRY, and sung by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Motto songs of every kind, 
Have through the world been sung; 
But I 
have one, the truest one, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I 
will unfurl, 
A 
sad one you will own; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
Citonus: 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I 
give. 
Once I 
was a 
happy man, 
And had a 
loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can, 
If you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
1NTow those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
This is a 
tale I 
know that's true, 
As in the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
When I 
tell you, you will start; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
from this broken heart.

want of means or

Mrly vpuna ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dbil-

repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qfiL,Ation. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage,-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover ever3 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not lot 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections which fact makes a 
further explanation ma
