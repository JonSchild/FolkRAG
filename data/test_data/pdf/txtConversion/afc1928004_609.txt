Opinions of the Press. 
TONY PASTOR'S troupe last evening at the Park kept the 
audience in a broad grin for three hours. . . . HARRY 
McAvoY and EMMA. ROGERS, in their society sketch of " Jeal-
ousy," certainly introduced a 
very realistic idea of a 
matri-
monial squabble. Mr. Brown's calm resignation was as amus-
ing to the audience as it was aggravating to Mrs. Brown, 
who was very pretty indeed in her wifely anger.—Brooklyn 
Daily Times. 
HARRY MCAvoY and EMMA ROGERS gave a 
society sketch 
introducing songs and medley duets, together with very funny 
business that caught the house.—Providence Evening Tele-
grant. 
MeAvoY and ROGERS are the best features of the bill. 
Miss ROGERS is one of the handsomest women on the stage, 
and her acting would not be out of place in a 
legitimate dra-
ma; Mr. MCAvoY is a 
very funny little man,.and they are a 
big team.—Louisville commercial. 
TONY PASTOR'S TROUPE, Grand Opera House, New York.— 
.. . As usual, there was a charming welcome given to 
EMMA ROGERS, who, as Clara Brown, displayed some ener-
getic light comedy on the somewhat resigned countenance of 
HARRY MCAVOY, who stood imperturbably to receive her 
facial compliments in the guise of the pallid Brown. 
It form-
ed a 
capital opening demonstration, in which the audience did 
not know whether to sympathize with the complaining wife 
or to take sides with the devoted husband.—New York Daily 
News. 
TONY PASTOR at Phillips' Opera House.—The society sketch 
by HARRY MCAVOY and EmmA. ROGERS was excellent—in 
fact, one of the very best of the evening.—Richmond Inde-
pendent Times. 
ToNv PASTOR at the Grand Opera House opened with an 
audience that packed the house from roof to floor. 
The pro-
gramme opened with a 
pretty little sketch by HARRY Mc-
Avow and EMMA ROGERS, which was well and favorably re-
ceived.—Syracuse Daily Courier, July 23d, 1881. 
HARRY 141cAvov and EMMA ROGERS, sketch artists, made a. 
hit, and are, without a 
single exception, the finest in this litts 
that have ever appeared in this city.—New York Mirror. 
DUET AND CHORUS. 
Jung by HARRY McAvoy and Emme ROGERS in their original act, 
entitled " Love in a 
Letter-Bag."

SARAH McTEARER. 
An original song written by W ILLIAM Warn for EMMA Roossa, 
and sung by her in the act of " Love in a 
Letter-Bag." 
Miss Sarah McTearer, 
She was an ensnarer, 
A 
rarer and squarer young girl you'd not meet; 
She was such a 
flarer 
You could not compare her— 
Miss Sarah McTearer was belle of the street.. 
Some folks couldn't bear her, 
She lives up a 
pair o' 
Steep steps in the rear of a 
shanty and block.' 
Sure her dad was a 
swearer 
From old Connemara, 
A 
son of O'Hara, one of the old stock.. 
No one could outstare her, 
Miss Sarah McTearer, 
For Sarah McTearer no boy did she fear; 
lie would wear her, bear her, 
Or be sent to Cairo, 
For Sarah McTearer her own way did steer.

PICTURE SONG. 
Written by H ARRY McAwn., 
and sung by Miss EMMA ROGERS with 
great success in all the principal theaters of the United States. 
I've some pictures here of which 
sing, 
Of facts and jokes and rhymes; 
Of good and brave men, dead and gone, 
And living ones of the times. 
The first one never told a 
lie, 
But many battles won, 
He lives in the hearts of his countrymen 
His name is George Washington. 
Another one of whom I'll sing, 
Renowned in time of war; 
Who, as a 
ruler, served two terms, 
And quietly smoked his cigar. 
Europe's rulers have with him dined, 
Indeed he's acquired great fame; 
I 
wonder if he's the coming man--
Ulysses S. Grant is his name. 
And still another one I 
have, 
His eyes are like two moons; 
The people in New Orleans all say 
He stole all their silver spoons. - 
He gave the Returning Board a 
rub, 
He is a 
political sutler, 
The first three words of his name 
Are Benjamin Franklin Butler. 
I've another one, but lie's dead and gone, 
His loss is felt, I'm sure; 
Although he was rich he was generous, too, 
And he never went back on the poor. 
PICTURE SONS, 
(Concluded.) 
He was a 
great financial man.. 
Made business dull or brisk, 
He fell by an assassin's hand, 
Alas! for poor Colonel Jim Fisk.. 
And now another I'll show to you, 
Who has caused a 
great furore; 
He is a 
man whom all the world 
Had learned to respect and adore; 
But Satan has let loose her tongue 
And covered hint with great shame, 
We'll let the public be his judge— 
Henry Ward Beecher's his name. 
A 
statesman great is dead and gone, 
And now lies in his grave; 
Beloved by all his countrymen, 
A 
soldier kind and brave; 
He was an enemy's direst foe, 
A 
generous soul was he, 
A 
friend to every honest heart, 
'Tis General Robert E. Lee. 
A warrior great is dead and gone, 
But a 
brave old soul was he; 
lie fell upon the battlefield 
Contending for victory. 
A 
prayer was his battlt-cry, 
And many a 
fight he won, 
A. greater general never lived 
Than gallant Stonewall Jackson. 
W ANT A FELLOW SO BAD. 
Written by HARRY McAvoy and respectfully dediCated to U SIA. 
ABERLE, the accomplished Vocalist and Actress. 
The times are getting so very hard 
One cannot get a 
beau; 
And when you think you have captured one, 
It's oh, no! not for Joe, 
The panic near drives us crazy, 
It's enough to make one mad, 
Oh, good old times, come back again, 
I 
want a 
fellow so bad. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear! 
Oh, dear! 
It's enough to drive one mad, 
To know you're young and pretty, toot 
And want a 
fellow so bad. 
'Twas out a-riding we used to go 
And have such jolly sport; 
We'd oyster stews, champagne and beer, 
Oh, that was just my forte. 
But now such things are different, 
And I 
think it is a 
sin; 
Just ask your beau to take you out, 
He'll say, " Oh, no! it's too thin-." 
Oh, dear, eta. 
Now I 
am willing to work a 
bit 
To help a 
mate along; 
I'd cook his meals and mend his clothes, 
And try to do no wrong. 
I'd, on a 
pinch, do the washing, 
And I'd always look so glad, 
I'd never get angry and pout and scold, 
For I 
want a 
fellow so bad. 
Oh, dear, etc.

I'M A DAD, 
DAD, 
DAD. 
AS 
sting by HARRY Mcit.voy with great success in the sketch ot 
" 
Matrimonial Difficulties." 
I've been married nearly twenty years 
And ne'er a 
chick nor child 
Had crowned my bliss, folks made remarks 
That often made me wild. 
What they've said and how they've looked 
Oft drove me to despair; 
But something happened the other day 
That caused the neighbors all to stare. 
My wife, my darling joy, she's got a 
little boy, 
I 
feel so very glad I 
could go mad, mad, mad! 
The neighbors say it's clever, better late than never, 
I 
feel so very glad, now I'm a 
dad, dad, dad! 
When I'd call upon my married friends 
Each one I 
surely found 
Had lots of little images 
A-playing all around. 
And every time I'd chance to meet 
My old chum Peter Green, 
He'd say, " Why, Morton, you've not one yet, 
And I've got seventeen." 
To behold the little stranger 
There's been quite an anxious crowd; 
They say now Fin a 
father 
I 
should really feel quite proud. 
And so I 
do, and oft with joy 
I 
feel as though I'd burst, 
When I 
hear them compliment me 
On the beauty of our first. 
Egad! I'm that excited 
Every now and then I 
feels, 
As though I 
scarce knew whether 
I'm on my head or heels. 
Of course we'll give a 
party— 
Yes, a 
jolly grand affair, 
In honor of the birth of this, 
My infant son and heir. 
JOHANNA SHAY. 
Written by GEORGE A. 
JACKSON, and dedicated to HARRY MCAVOT. 
Ala.—" Colleen Baton." 
In the Emerald Isle, so far from here, 
Across the deep blue sea, 
There lives a 
girl that I 
love dear, 
And I 
know that she loves me. 
Her cheeks are like two roses, 
Oh, they're a 
lovely sight, 
Her hair, so brown, would reach the ground, 
And her teeth are pearly white. 
Her lips are like a 
rosebud 
All in the month of May, 
She holds my heart, though we're far apart, 
My own Johanna Shay. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Johanna's tall and lovely, 
And like the lilies fair; 
The handsomest girl that can be found 
In the county of Kildare. 
And if I 
have good luck, my boys, 
She'll soon be Missus O'Day, 
For my bundle I'll pack and will sail right back, 
To my Johanna Shay. 
There's a 
robin in yonder orchard 
Singing in the cherry- tree. 
Which makes me think of Johanna 
When she used to sing to me, 
As hand- in-hand o'er the mountain, 
Or by the lake we strolled, 
And her cheek would flush with a 
modest blush 
Whenever a 
kiss I 
stole. 
Though the ocean rolls between us, 
Yet if harm were in her way, 
Oh, I'd jump in and boldly swim 
To my own Johanna Shay. 
CHORUS. 
If all the gold in New York State 
Was laid down by my side, 
If I 
were elected president 
Johapna should be my bride. 
I'd have a 
house in Washington, 
The finest ever seen, 
And of all the town and country around 
Johanna would be the queen. 
In the summer time we both would go 
To Long Branch or Cape May, 
For of all that's there none can compare 
With my Johanna Shay. 
BRAVE DRAGOON. 
Written by H ARRY 3IcAvoy and sung by EMMA ROGERS. 
Oh, my love he is a 
handsome brave dragoon, 
And off to the wars he's gone, 
He'd said he'd come back to me soon, 
Yet now I am all forlorn. 
But when he does return again 
And the guns are roaring loud, 
With screaming fifes and beating drums, 
'Twill make me feel so proud. 
Cuoms. 
Right face, left! 
Forward! March! 
Keep time to the tune, 
(Drums) 
He's a handsome brave dragoon.' 
But if he should fall on a 
battlefield 
He'd die like a 
soldier brave, 
For I 
know with fife he'd never yield 
Nor fill a 
coward's grave. 
Although I'd weep and mourn for him 
Yet my heart would fill with joy, 
To know he died as true as steel— 
My own brave soldier boy. 
Right face, left eta;

DOYT GIVE IT AWAY. 
Written by HARRY McAvoy. 
Sung by MISS EMMA Rolm& 
'There's many slang words nowadays, 
That gain a 
great renown; 
It's " Take a drop," " Go bag your head," 
Perhaps it's " Go lay down." 
" 
Won't you ever tumble to yourself?" 
You hear it every day. 
•" It's all right over the left you know,' 
But don't you give it away." 
CHORUS. 
"Don't you give it away,") 
That's what the girls all say, \ 
" 
When you get a 
good thing," boys, 
Why, " don't you give it away." 
I 
met a 
gent the other day 
Who was on a 
jolly lark, 
Says he to me, " My dear young maid, 
Will you meet me in the park? 
We'll have champagne and oyster stews; 
And everything that's gay ;" 
I 
think I'll have to take it in, 
But " don't you give it away." 
Don't you give it away, etc. 
SPOILING FOR A BEAU. 
Written by HARRY MCAVOY. 
Oh, dear, I 
am so lonesome, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
The reason I 
will tell you 
Why I 
am so awful blue. 
I 
want to get a 
fellow 
Who'll to me alway stick, 
Who, when I 
ask for greenbacks, 
Was never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, tell me where I'll find him, 
I'd really like to know. 
There is no use in talking— 
I'm spoiling for a 
beau. 
I'd like to have one handsome, 
And always full of glee, 
Who'd treat and kiss me often, 
'Twould suit me to a 
T. 
I'd like to have one nobby, 
Who on the square would deal, 
Who'd whip his weight in wild-
eats 
And eat a 
good square meal. 
Oh, tell me, otia

CHEEK. -
Bung by HARRY MCAYOY with great success at HARRY MThtER11 
Theater. 
No doubt you all have read the news 
In papers every day; 
So I 
will sing whate'er I 
choose 
In my own peculiar way. 
A bashful man oft comes to want, 
He don't know how to speak; 
But he'd be a 
real stunner 
If he only had the cheek. 
CHORUS. 
So hold your head up like a 
man, 
Don't fear your mind to speak, 
You're sure of plenty in this world, 
If you've only got the cheek. 
We've got some dashing boys in town, 
And don't they put on style! 
And when they meet a 
pretty girl, 
How they bow and scrape and smile, 
With ruffled shirt and line kid gloves, 
Their clothes all clean and sleek, 
But they got them all on credit, 
For they've got an awful cheek. , 
Some time ago I 
used to think 
The ladies quite refined, 
Quite honest, pure and trustworthy, 
But I 
now have changed my mind. 
Just give the dears half of a 
chance 
Into your purse to peek, 
And you'll find out pretty lively 
That they've got an awful cheek. 
The only way to get along 
Is to be on the beat, 
And ask a 
loan from every one 
Who by luck or chance you meet. 
Stick to your friend if he is flush 
And shake him when he's weak, 
That's the way they're doing nowadays, 
You bet they've got a 
cheek. 
• 
ALL IN YOUR EYE. 
Bung with great applause by HARRY MCAVOY at the Grand Central, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 
I 
hardly know what to sing you, 
But 1'11 do the best that I 
can; 
I'll hoop You up something that's lively, 
And smoking reii hot from the pan. 
There's songs upon different Fubjects, 
And some eitue you to laugh or to sigh, 
But this. one 
make as I 
sing it, 
And we'll christen it " All in Your Eye." 
CHORUS. 
'Pon my word I dou't mean .to offend you, 
But i 
never can tell you a 
lie, 
I'm told that some people are honest, 
But 1 
reckon it's all in your eye. 
Suppose a 
friend tells you he's hard up 
And he asks for a 
dollar or two; 
You pull out your money and lend it, 
You're sure he'd the same do to you. 
You meet hint a 
week or so after 
And to get back your money you try, 
No doubt he'll give you a 
cold shoulder, 
And you'll find it's all " right in your eye." 
An honest man now is a 
wonder. 
And there's few that do just as they preach; 
While many pretend to be upright, 
They won't steal, but oh how they'll reach. 
And there are the swells of the fashion, 
Who get trusted for all that they buy; 
The bill is presented for payment, 
And they settle it— right in ycur eye. 
The only way now to get wealthy 
Is to class every one as a 
beat; 
For most of these sanctified humbugs 
Do naught but to steal and to cheat. 
They're friends to you while you have money, 
When you're broke they will quick pass you by; 
Just ask them to grant you a 
favor, 
And you'll get it—yes! all in your eye.

I

soldier boy, 
He's my joy; 
Oh, he is tall and handsome 
And as brave as brave can be. 
He walks so fine and straight 
Past my gate, 
But.then he glances sideways 
And slyly winks at me.

Hurrah for the boys in the army. 
He's going far away, 
Long to stay; 
But says he'll write me often 
And he'll tell me all the news. 
He thinks we ought to wed— 
So he said; 
I 
really do not like to, 
But how can I 
refuse. _

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came 
Commencing with " My Dearest, 
and concluding 
with her name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisseS, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a !,right summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding 
with her name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll under-
stand, 
The feelings of your heart, when loving letters reach 
your hand, 
How you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart 
she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a letter, from my sweetheart it 
will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the 
news, 
Tell you haw we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure-wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L, 0, V, E.

As sung by KITTY SMITH. 
OH 
I 
fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot ; 
1 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh ! you'll forget me not !" 
CiionuS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly — for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Daisies and the rosiest too, they grow around the spot, 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not !" 
Dancei 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' us all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane ; 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand. 
She glanced et me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower—I 
picked it: 
A sweet- forget-me-not 1

Ind Dance. 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said, 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes!" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A. sweet-forget-me-not!

YES OR NO. 
Written by CHARLES SANSON, and sung with most genuine success 
by C. 
P. 
HYLAND, the celebrated Character and Motto Vocalist. 
Good- evening to you, gentlemen and ladies, one and 
all, 
I 
hope I 
see you looking gay and bright, 
For it alwdys gives me pleasure when I've got an 
hour of leisure 
For to creep into some corner out of sight; 
So with paper, pen and ink I 
will study and I'll 
think 
On the funny things that people do and say; 
So please excuse my chaffing, for I've many a 
fit of 
laughing 
At the funny things that happen every day. 
So if you will endeavor to be as quiet as you're 
clever, 
I'll see and try some funny things to show, 
And introduce another song to pull up with the other 
one, 
And it's 'titled a 
decided Yes or No. 
Noi,v some time ago I 
courted, or at -least I 
may. say 
sported, 
With a 
girl whom I 
considered fair and square; 
But by the holy Moses, and the handsomest of roses, 
I 
made a 
big mistake, I 
do declare. 
For going rather early to our meeting-place one night, 
Oh, gracious jumping -Moses! look on me, 
There stood a 
great big fellow, with a 
gingham um-
brella, 
He was huddling and a-cuddling my fair she. 
My astonishment was utter, as I 
knocked him in the 
gutter, 
And I 
told her she to Jericho could go. 
Had I 
made that girl my wife, should I 
have had a 
wife for life? 
All I 
want is a 
decided Yes or No. 
YES OR Nail 
t 
(Concluded.) 
Now I once was out of collar, 
and like many a 
better scholar, 
I 
went some occupation for to find, 
So I 
went to see the boss, at the works"of Gibbs & 
Cross, 
Who had used to be a 
good old pal of mine. 
He says, ' Ah, well—we—and don't you see?" 
And stammered like a 
kid that's newly born; 
He fimbled and he fumbled, he mumbled and he 
gru in bled, 
" 
You can call again first thing to-morrow morn; 
Says I, " Old boy, look here, now to you it may 
seem queer, 
But for you I 
never mean to make a 
show, 
There is no mistake about it, set me on or do with-
out it, 
All I 
want is a 
decided Yes or No." 
• 
Now I've noticed many a party in my concert hall 
career, 
Who, when sober, they are as quiet as a 
lamb; 
But whenever they get toddy they are annoying ev-
erybody, 
Who would wish to sit and listen like a 
man. 
Their cigar wants lighting twenty times a 
minute I'll 
be bound, 
You offer them a 
light, what do they do? 
They'll gabble and they'll linger until the blaze it 
burns their finger, 
And then they'll curse and swear, and say its you. 
If you think of having pleasure, or a 
sweet half hour 
of leisure, 
Where such naughty seeds allowed to thrive and 
grow, 
Why, a 
dollar I 
will bet it, whilst it's odds that you 
don't get it, 
Am I 
right, lads? a 
decided Yes or Nb.

NANCY BELL." 
Music published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. PrilS 
10 cents. 
'Twas in the good ship " Nancy Bell" 
I 
sail'd for the Indian sea, 
And there on the reef we came to grief, 
Which has often occured to me, brave boys, 
Which has often oceured to me. 
And pretty nigh all the crew was drown'd. 
There was seventy-seven o' soul, 
And only ten of the " Nancy's" men, 
said " Here!" to the muster roll, brave boys. 
There was me, and the cook, and the captain 
bold, 
And the mate of the "Nancy "brie, . 
And Ur:: boatswain tight, and a 
midshipnnte, 
And the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys, 
And the crew of the captain's gig. 
For a 
month we'd neither wittles nor drink, 
Till a-hungry we did feel, 
So we draw'd a 
lot, and accordin' shot 
The captain for our meal, brave boys. 
The next lot fell to the "Nancy's" mate, 
And a 
delicate dish he made; 
Then our appetite with the midshipmite 
We seven survivors stayed, brave boys, 
We seven survivors stayed. 
And then we murdered the bo'sun tight, 
And he much resembled a 
pig; 
Then we wittled free, did the cook and me, 
On the crew of the captain's gig brave boys. 
23 
THE YARN OF THE " 
NANCY BELL." 
Continued. 
Then only the eMl5k and me was left, 
And the delicate question, " Which 
Of us two goes to the kettle?" arose, 
And we argued it out as sich, brave boys, 
And we argued it out as sich. 
For I 
loved that cook as a 
brother,I did, 
And the cook he worshiped me, 
But we'd both be blowed, if we'd either be 
stowed, 
In the other chap's hold, you see, brave boys. 
So we stirred it round and round, 
And sniffed at the foaming froth; 
I 
ups with his heels and smothers his squeals 
In the scum of the boiling broth, brave boys, 
In the scum of the boiling broth. 
And I 
ate that cook in a 
week, or less. 
And, as I 
eating be, 
The last of his chops, why, I 
almost drops, 
For a 
wessel in sight I 
see, brave boys. 
And I 
never larf, and I 
never smile, 
And I 
never lark nor play, 
But sit and croak, and a 
single joke 
I 
have—which is to say, brave boys, 
I 
have--which is to say— 
Oh, I 
am a 
cook, and a 
captain bold, 
And a 
mate of the "Nancy" brig, 
And a 
bo'suu tight, and a 
midshipruito, 
And the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys. 
/ THE WORLD FROM THE- SIDEWALK. 
Did you ever stand in the crowded street, 
• 
In the glare of the city lamp, 
And list to the tread of a 
million feet 
d 
In their quaintly musical tramp? 
As the surging crowd go to and fro 
'Tis a 
pleasant sight, I 
ween, 
To mark the figures that come and go 
In the ever-changing scene. 
Here the publican walks with the sinner proud, 
And the priest in his gloomy cowl 
And Dives walks in the motley crowd 
With Lazarus cheek by jowl. 
And the daughter of toil with her fresh young heart, 
As pure as her spotless frame, 
Keeps step with the wcman who makes her mart , 
In the haunts Of sin and shame. 
How lightly trips the country lass 
In the midst of the city stiffs 
As freshly pure as the daisied grass 
That grows on her native hills. 
And the beggar, too, with his hungry eye 
And his lean, wan face and crutch. 
Gives a 
blessing the same to the passer-by,-
,. 
And he gives him little or much. 
When time has beaten the world's tattoo . 
And in dusky armor dight 
In treading with echoless footsteps through.' 
The gloom of the silent night. 
.How many of these shall be daintily fed 
And shall sing to slumbers sweet; 
While many will go to a 
sleepless bed 7 
And never a 
crumble to eat!

THE WORLD FROM THE SIDEWALK. 
( (Concluded.) 
Ah me 
1- when the hours go joyfully by; , 
How little we stop to heed 
Our brothers' and sisters' despairing cry 
In their woe and bitter needl 
Yet such a 
world as the angels sought - 
This world of ours we'd call, 
If the brotherly love that the Father taught 
Was felt by each for all. 
Yet a 
few short years and this motley throng 
With all shall have passed away, 
And the rich and the poor and the old and the young 
Will be undistinguished clay. 
And lips that laugh and lips that moan 
Shall in silence alike be sealed, 
And some will lie under a 
stately stone 
And some in the potter's field. 
But the sun will be shining just as bright 
And so will the silver moon, 
And just such a 
crowd will be here to-night, 
And just such a 
crowd at noon. 
And men will be wicked and women will sin, 
As ever since Adam's tall, 
With the same old world to labor in, 
And the same God over all.

'Twas shortly after marriage, full of love and joy, 
I 
bought a 
baby carriage for a 
dumpling of a 
boy; 
Oh, ev'ry Sunday morning my wife ' ud fret and pout, 
rill I'd put on my linen suit, and wheel the baby out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, heigh, diddle, diddle, the cat's in the fiddle; 
How,,are you, Mr. Mulligan? you hear the neighbors 
shout! 
The little dog laugh'd for to see such funny sport, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
There's jealous Mister Higgins, just next door to me, 
Himself and Misses Higgins have no children, do ye 
see; 
He stands upon the doorstep, and turns his back 
about, 
He never had the luck, my boys, to wheel the baby 
out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
carriage, boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, goosey, goosey, gander, 'twas where shall I 
wander; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
It's up the stairs, and down stairs, all in the ladies' 
chamber, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out.

WHEEL THE BABY OUT. 
(Continued.) 
The old maiden spinster, just across the way, 
She tittivates her poodle, white, with ribbons bright 
and gay; 
While looking from her window, she said she had a 
doubt, 
Oh, if it was the proper thing to wheel the baby out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, 
I'd push the baby carriage, boys, and sing this little 
song: 
There's old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cup-
board; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Oh, when she got there, the cupboard it was bare, 
I 
always was a 
singing when l'd wheel the baby out. 
Now, all ye merry bachlors, when your fortune's 
made, 
Oh, get a 
wife and wagon, and go out upon parade; 
Now ornament the nation, when war it comes about, 
You've done your duty faithfully, to wheel a 
soldier 
out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
carriage, boys, and sing this little song: 
There's poor Johnny Horner, that sat in the corner; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you bear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Put in his little thumb, and he pulled out a 
plum, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out,

THE WIDOW'S MESSAGE TO HER SON. 
By ELLEN FORRESTER, and recited by C. P. HYLAND. 
Remember, Dennis, all I 
bade you say, 
Tell him we're well and happy, thank the Lord; 
But of all our troubles since he went away, 
You'll mind, avick, and never say a 
word. 
Of cares and troubles sure we've had our share, 
The finest summer isn't always fair. 
Tell him the spotted heifer calved in May, 
She died, poor thing, but that you needn't mind, 
Nor how the constant rain destroyed the hay; 
But tell him God to us was ever kind, 
And when the fever spread the country o'er \ 
His mercy kept the sickness from our door. 
Be sure you tell him how the neighbors camel 
And cut the corn and stored it in the barn; 
'Twould be as well to mention them by name= 
Pat Murphy, Ned McCabe, and James McCarno 
And big Tim Daily, from behind the hill; 
But say, agra, oh, say, I 
missed him still. 
They came with ready hands our toil to share, 
'Twas then I 
missed him most—my own right hand. 
I 
felt, although kind hearts were round me there, 
The kindest heart beat in a 
foreign land. 
Strong hand, brave heart, oh, severed far from me 
By many a 
weary league of shore and sea.

And tell him she was with us—he'll know who— 
Mavourneen, hasn't she the winsome eyes? 
The darkest, deepest, brightest, bonniest blue 
I 
ever saw except in summer skies; 
And such black hair, it is the blackest hair 
That ever rippled over neck so fair. 
Tell him old Pincher fretted many a 
day, 
And moped, poor dog, 'twas well he didn't die; 
Crouched by the roadside he watched the way, 
And sniffed the travelers as they passed him by; ) 
Hail, rain, or sunshine, sure ' twas all the same, 
He listened for the foot that never came. 
Tell him the house is lonesome-like and cold, 
The fire itself seems robbed of half its life; 
But maybe 'tis my eyes are growing old, 
And things look dim before my failing sight; 
For all that, tell him 'twas myself that spun 
The shirts you bring him, and stitched them, ever7 
one. 
Give him my blessing morning, noon, and night, 
Tell him my prayers are offered for his good, 
That he may keep his Maker still in sight, 
And firmly stand, as his brave father stood, 
True to his name, his country, and his God,

WE PARTED FROM THE SHORE. 
As sung by the favorite Motto Vocalist, JOHNNY GI850104 
Oh, here I 
am an Irish boy, 
From Dublin all the way; 
To work by labor I 
have tried, 
But got such little pay. 
The wages low, provisions high, 
Myself I 
can't maintain, 
To earn an honest living 
I 
thought I'd cross the main. 
CHORUS. 
We parted from the shore, 
We may never see it more; 
Old Ireland you're my darling, 
And I'll always you adore. 
The music of your harp, 
Sweet joy my heart recalls 
Back to the green fields of Erin. 
The reason why we are so poor, 
I 
will quickly tell to you, 
For hardships sure lye must endure, 
We got no work to do. 
Our land is rich and fertile, 
As you've heard in many a 
song, 
And if you listen for awhile, 
I'll point you out the wrong. 
We parted from, etc. 
Now if our Irish landlords, 
Who in foreign countries roam, 
Would spend a 
little time or money • 
On the land they call their own. 
There is land enough on each estate 
For a 
foundry or a 
mill, 
To give labor to the Irish boys, 
Who foreign countries fill. 
We parted from, etc.

WHAT CURIOUS THINGS THE MOON COULD 
TELL IF IT COULD ONLY SPEAK. 
Wrtt.ten by Wm. R. WA•r:s. and sung by M ISS DAISY REmnrcvros. 
What curious things the moon could tell if it could 
only speak, 
Things it has seen most every day, and every night 
and week; 
It peeps into the poor man's cot, the millionaire's tine 
hall, 
On all the people of the world it's sure to make a 
call. 
It saw Beecher write his sermon, poor man could food 
do without, 
And while he wrote he swallowed down roast beef and 
bottled stout; 
it has seen the workingman go to bed hungry, cold 
and weak— 
What curious things the moon could tell if it could 
only speak. 
It saw the ten-cent barbers for the five-cent shavers 
go, 
Because with tonic and bay rum they work for prices 
low; 
It saw Kearney pass around the hat, the poor man's 
cash to win, 
It saw Ben Butler grab the spoons and Tilden counted-
WHAT CURIOUS THINGS THE MOON COULD 
TELL IF IT COULD ONLY SPEAK. 
(Concluded.) 
It saw the Widow Oliver old Simon Cameron kiss, 
Saw General Grant go round the world and not one 
free- lunch miss; 
Saw Cowley in the " Shepherd's Fold" starve chil-
dren every week; 
What curious timings the moon could tell if it could 
only speak. 
It heard Bob Ingersoll first say the fire was out below; 
It smiled when Hanlon won the race and Courtney 
stopped his blow; 
It grins when every Mormon priest another wife does 
take, • 
Or when a 
temperance saint drinks rum, just for the 
stomach's sake; 
It smiles when young men to their girls eternal love 
do swear, 
For well it knows when they are wed for other girls 
they'll care; 
It saw Parnell for old Ireland fight, and for his free-
dom seek; 
What curious things the moon could tell if it could 
only speak.

I 
WHEN FIELDS WERE GREEN AND ROSES . 
BLOOMED. 
As sung by Hellen & Hart at TONY PASTOR'S Theater. 
Words by (and music adapted by) R. B. WiLsori. 
When fields were green and roses bloomed, and 
birds with merry lays, 
And maple trees with cooling shade made glad the 
summer days, 
Serenely sweet that happy time, my heart was 
young and free, 
No care nor sorrow yet had cast a 
shadow over me. 
Ah! in those golden days of old, life seemed filled 
with joys untold. 
And sped the hours 'mid rainbow flow'rs, for love in 
my heart then awakened; 
Those dear days will come no more, dreams of rap-
ture long are o'er, 
When fields were green and roses bloomed, and 
birds sang merry lays. 
When fields were green and roses bloomed, ttwas 
then love bloomed in me, 
No fairy tale was half so sweet, no fonder love could 
be; 
Our troth was plighted in life's spring, ere came a 
thought of gloom, 
We loved so true, but now my love is sleeping in the 
tomb. 
And summer fields are dull and drew-, autumn 
leaves are brown and sere, 
A 
chilling, 
blight mars all delight, for love in my 
heart lies withered; 
Those dear days will come no more, dreams of rap-
ture long are o'er. 
When youth and hope's fair roses bloom', that 
bloom no more for me.

WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY. 
sung with great success,.by MISS CARRIE Dormer() 
at Tour 
Pastor's Theater. 
W ALRING out on Sunday I 
think very nice, 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price; 
So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
trice, 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap" now some folks seem to 
prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh, such horrid 
guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on 
Sunday. 
Chorus. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy 
swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on. 
Wall street, 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver-headed cane, hnd a 
glass stuck in 
one eye, 
He twirls his fine mustache, wnich suspicious looks 
of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy, 
• As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

UNSOPHISTICATED LOVE. 
As sung by ARCHIE W HITE with Duprez & Denediet's Minstrels-2) 
The gal that I 
love is both tall and serene. 
Her teeth are bran new, and her cheeks are so green,' 
Her voice is as sweet as the tones of a 
mule, 
Her uncle's a 
sailor, her brother's a 
fool. 
She can chew all day long on a 
big lump of gum, 
Like a 
freckled faced boy with a 
wart, on his thumb, 
Her appetite's good, she'd devour with great ease, 
A 
couple of tons of old limburger cheese. 
She had a 
great love for the new silver dollars, 
She looks like a 
fairy in clean paper collars, 
When she opens her head the inside can be seen, , 
No " taffy" at all, she's a 
lovely sardine. 
She owns a 
big farm where the bull frogs (lo grow, 
She raises a 
crop of the best kind of snow: 
I 
gave her my picture dressed in may best top. 
And she put it in the sty for to frighten the hogs. 
She wears a 
glass eye, and its color is red, 
She's a 
big bunch of feathers attached to her head. 
She can talk broken Chinese in seventeen tongues, 
And blow down a 
house with her cast iron lungs. 
She had, etc. 
I 
never can tell all her beauties at once, 
She calls me a 
sugar-coated galvanized dunce; 
When she kisses me with her big mouth open wide, 
There's room enough in it for an elephant to ride. 
If she ever got mad she'd pulverize your jaw 
With one little swipe of her delicate paw; 
What shall I 
say of her gaiters to wear? 
It takes forty big cowskins to make her a 
pair. 
She had, etc.

And funny things we see; 
'Tis but a 
world of woe to some, 
And yet how dear to me. 
I 
mix my troubles with my joys, 
But my whiskey I 
take straight; 
I 
laugh when bitten by little flies, 
Since the little dears must ate. 
CHORUS. 
No matter who runs down this world, 
To I. 
Lise I 
will strive, 
And very few of us I 
think 
Will leave this world alive. 
A man may hit me with a 
brick, 
If he says he is only funning; 
And when in bed I 
never kickt 
At mosquitoes round me humming. 
I 
stand up in a 
horse-car, 
And let young men sit down; 
In fact there's nothing troubles me, 
I'm a 
happy Irish clown. 
No matter who rune down, et.. 
You can borrow my umbrella 
On a 
very rainy day, 
And if you never bring it back 
I 
won't give you away; 
You can ride me on a 
fence-rail, 
Run over me with a 
hack, 
And you can hitch your horse to me, 
But I 
must be on his back. 
No matter who runs down, eta.,

And promenade beneath the moon;

My guiding star of love so fair.

THEY'VE ALL GOT A WIFE BUT ME, 
Written and sung by Bes. Doixis 
A 
story true I'll tell to you, 
Of the troubles of my life; 
Though in love I've been—like many other men— 
I 
never could get a 
wife. 
FOr the girls are so shy ( but I 
can't tell why), 
And sad it is to relate; 
Though I've tried and tried, till I've almost died, 
Still I 
cannot find a 
mate. 
CHORUS. 
There's the monkey and the dog, the turtle and the 
frog, 
The fishes that swim in the sea; 
And the pretty little squirrel, with his tail up in a 
curl, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
When first in love, head o'er heels I 
dove, 
It was with 
girl named Lize; 
She'd a 
nose, hard to beat, she'd number ten feet, 
And a 
pair of codfish eyes. 
I 
offered my hand, in a 
style quite grand, 
And wha t 
do you suppose? 
She said very cool, that she wasn't such a 
fool, 
And she turned up her pretty little nose. 
SPOKEN'. -
It made me outrageously mad to think 
that she went ba ck on me after I'd squandered all 
my wealth upon her— not that I 
cared for the money, 
but I 
hated to realize that--
THE'VE ALL GOT A WIFE BUT ME. 
(Continued,) 
Cnonus. 
There's the chicken and the cat, the weasel and the 
rat, 
The 'skeeter and the bumblebee; 
The cunning little lizard and the naughty old buzzard, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
My love number two, was a 
girl named Sue, 
Who clerked in a 
dollar store; 
Each day I 
dressed in all my best, 
And wandered past the door. 
I 
wrote her a 
letter (oh, I 
ought to know better), 
And asked her to share my lot; 
Next day I 
met her " feller," and he thumped me in 
the smeller. 
That was all the answer I 
got. 
SPOKEN. — Oh, I 
tell you it is a 
horrible thing to 
contemplate—just to think that I 
am left to enjoy 
single " wretchedness," while— 
CHORUS. 
There's the horse and the steer, the goat and the 
deer, 
The hornet, the wasp and the flea; 
The fussy little 'coon, and the ugly old baboon, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YO U. 
Written by Wm. SCANLAN, and performed by SCANLAN St CRONIN. 
Music published by F. W. HELm.ice, No. .50 Fourth Street Cincinnati. 
Ohio. 
THE subject of my song is love, 
Something qiiite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share; 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN. —I 
explained the matter to her the other 
evening, and when I 
had finished, she looked into 
Any face this way, and said, that's nothing— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
Y071 may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
met that which opened my eyes. 
(Concluded.) 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said, what do you wish here? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And. the last words I 
could hear while there was— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
Fe matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN. —Yes; I 
shall haunt her day and night, it 
it's only to hear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or_ a 
chair.

You see before you a 
nice young girl, 
Whose heart is nearly breaking; 
Who wants a 
beau to love her so, 
All other girls forsaking. 
Now do me take, for goodness sake, 
You'll never find another 
Who'll be more true than I 
to you, 
If you'll take me from my mother. 
CHORUS. 
Pm tired of single life, 
it's misery and strife; 
I'm looking for a 
nice young man, 
To be his little wife. 
To marry is my plan, 
So take me while you can, 
Don't sit there and at me stare, 
But speak out like a 
man. 
Now there's a 
young man sitting there, 
You see he's at me winking, 
Oh, yes you were, for I 
could see 
Your eyes they were a 
blinking. 
Now, kind sir, don't angry get, 
At my bold advances; 
We'll married be to-morrow if 
You'll only take the chances. 
I'm tired of single life, ete.

Duet sung with great success by the W HITNEY'S` 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling,

Keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrancq 
Tell me, darling, only tell ?

Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When the roses cease to bloom ? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love, 
'Till I 
come to call you mine.

In the hour I

STROLLING ON THE BEACH. 
SONG AND DANCE.

and performed by them with great success. 
While strolling on the beach the other evening 
When the moon was shining bright, 
And the summer breeze was floating o'er the waters, 
Making ripples soft and light; 
It was there me met and we will not forget 
The happy moments passed; 
We told each other of our love, 
Then turned to go at last. 
When the moonbeams came dancing o'er the waters, 
And the little birds were sleeping in the tr_e.e.?, 
We promised each other to be faithful 
And do our best to please. 
'Oh, my! how happy we did seem, 
(Dance) 
'Twas like a 
vision of a 
fairy dream, 
(Dance) 
While walking together in the moonlight 
In the sand down at the beach, 
We promised one another to be faithful 
And love to each other teach. 
Oh, the story of our love we have tried to tell you. 
In our plain and simple way, 
And to a 
wedding you will be invited 
At no long distant day; 
On our wedding night, if.the moon shines bright_ 
We will hold it on the beach; 
So all that come can have their fun 
And love to their sweethearts teach, 
Oh, how happy we will be when we are married 
And settled down for life; 
We will never forget our strolling in the moonlight 
Which made us man and wife.

Oh, Katie, love, why don't you write me a 
letter, 
You can't have forgotten your lover, machree, 
Sweet Kate, have you slighted the vows that you 
h 
P gted 
That night as we strayed by the banks of the Lees 
Long, long have I 
waited to hear from you, Katie, 
But no loving letter has yet come to me. 
Oh, it would delight me if Katie would write me 
A 
true loving letter from over the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, send me a 
letter, a 
long loving letter, 
And say that you love me as fondly, machreg 
As when broken hearted from Katie I 
parted, 
Oh, send me a 
letter from over the sea. 
The bright moonbeams sparkle in Lee's silver water* 
The nightingale warbled its sweet plaintive song, 
The meadows wide spreading, their perfume was 
shedding, 
As by the fair river we wandered along, 
With her head on my shoulder, she told me she loved 
me, 
And swore she would never love any but me. 
Oh, was I 
but dreaming, to think her eyes beaming 
With love-light that night on the banks of the Lee? 
Oh, send me a 
letter, etc. 
I 
gave her a 
ring, and she gttve me a 
ribbon, 
A piece of blue ribbon she wore in her hair, 
With rapture I 
kissed it, and near my heart placed it, 
The piece of blue ribbon that Katie did wear. 
For months we've been parted, but no loving letter 
From Katie, sweet Katie, has yet come to me. 
My heart full of sadness, would pulsate with gladness, 
Could I 
get a 
letter from over the sea. 
Oh, send me a 
letter, etb.

THE 
'SAILOR'S GRAVE. 
As sung by Ton Dzymn, the pleasing tenor. 
Our bark was far, far from the land, 
When the fairest of our gallant band 
Grew deadly pale, and weaned away, 
Like the twilight of an Autumn day. 
We had watched him through long hours of pain; 
Our cares were great, our hopes in vain: 
Death's stroke he gave no coward's alarm; 
But he smiled, and died in his niessinate's arms. 
We had no costly winding-sheet; 
We placed two round-shots at his feet; 
lie lays in his hammock, as snug and as sound 
As a 
king in his long shroud, inarble-bouild. 
We proudly decked his funeral vest 
With the Starry Flag upon his breast! 
We gave him this, as a 
badge of the brave,' 
And then lie was fit for a 
sailor's grave. 
Our voices broke, and hearts turned weak; 
Oft tears were seen on the brownest cheek; 
The quiver played on the lip of pride, 
As we lowered him down the ship's dark side; 
Then a 
splash and a 
plunge, and our task was o'er, 
And the billows rolled as they rolled before, 
And many wild prayers hallow'd the waves, 
And he sank beneath a 
sailor's grave.

Two children played on the sandy shore, 
As the royal sun in the east rose high, 
And the day seemed never so bright before§ 
And the ships went sailing by. 
L . 
Two lovers strolled on the pebbly beach, 
And they said " The day is too sweet to dial' 
For the hours were golden and fair to each, 
And the ships went sailing by. 
An old ntan sat in the evening glow, . 
And he watched the waves with a 
weary sigh, 
An he thought of days in the long ago— 
And the ships went sailing by. 
Two quiet graves near the restless deep, 
Where the waves dash ever, now low, now high; 
But the sleepers wake not to laugh or weep, 
And the ships go sailing by. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling. 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to Heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save; 
When you are happy and gay once more,

" 
Oh, take this flow'r, dear love !" said he, 
He spake with a 
tearful sigh; 
That night he was going across the sea, 
And this was his last good-bye 
She took the gift with a 
mocking smile; 
In the flush of her maiden pride; 
With heartless guile she dallied. awhile, 
Then threw the flow'r aside. 
Cnouus. 
Oh, love, for a 
year, a 
week, a 
day, 
But, alas 1 
for the love that loves alway„ 
" 
Give me a 
flow'r, dear love 1" said he, 
She threw the flow'r he craved; 
" 
Now, by the love that I 
have for thee; 
My breaking heart is sav'd 1" 
He kiss'd it once with a 
tender sigh, 
And treasur'd it near the heart-; 
" 
Tho' years roll by, this flow'r and r, 
Shall never, never part 
Oh, love, etc. 
They met again in after years, 
In life's sad, sorrowful time; 
Their heads were heavy with age and tears, 
And white with the winter rime 1 
He found the flow'r she scorn'd in play, 
At her faithful heart did dwell ! 
His flow'r they say he had cast away, 
Before its petals fell. 
Oh, love, eta.
