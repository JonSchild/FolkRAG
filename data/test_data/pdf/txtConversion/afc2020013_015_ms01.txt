Biographical Info and Early Memories Racing 
 
 
Born and raised in St. Catharine’s, Ontario 
 
 
Racing since 17 years old (currently 66 years old) 
 
 
Going with father to Merritville, started racing Go Karts at 12 years old 
Build first race car in High School (a late model, 1957 Chevy), with his friend Dan 
as a school project around 1972 or 1973 (during offseason) 
Majoring in Auto Mechanics in High School, and had a lot of support from the 
school too 
Back in High School, there were at least two GM factories in the area, but now 
only the engine block and some assembly 
Story of early merritville memory, around 7 or 8, modifieds then were a ‘jalopy 
class’, having his favorites, and falling asleep watching though or picking up 
cups in the grandstand 
In Western Hill area, only five or six miles from Merritville, so there was a lot of 
racers always in the area, and always race cars at the local garages and shops and 
houses 
Friesen family from St. Catharine’s owning both Merritville and Ransomville 
When first started racing, that first car – Dan would run it Friday night, he would 
run it Saturday night, and then Sunday they’d take turns running at 
Humberstone: so has been going to Ransomville since he was 17 as well 
There being a ton of competition at Ransomville around that time, and being 
younger competing against veterans – got torn down for inspection multiple 
times – as they were becoming really successful against them 
 
[7:20]  
Continued Discussion of Early Racing Career and Early Building Career 
After that first year, him and his friend Dan had separate cars so started 
competing against one another, and Pete going on to drive for a few different car 
owners in those early years, driving on and off 
1978 they built another own car, and other people started to get interested in 
them and asking, and starting in 1980 they started to really build more cars for 
other drivers 
Enjoying building cars for other competitors, that other competitors are 
successful in: that it’s nice for him to build something for himself and he can win, 
but with other competitors too that they win 
Awkwardness in racing against competitors – i.e. racing against people that you 
built cars for: experimenting would be in their own cars, then if it worked out 
well (as some didn’t) would put that on to other cars for customers 
 
[9:55]  
Founding of Bicknell Racing Products and Current Organization 
Building cars out of his garage / service station, until about 1987 when started the 
Bicknell Racing Products 
1984 started a Lightning Wheels and Chassis company but partnership didn’t last 
as long 
Bicknell Racing Products moving towards more manufacturing in the early 
years, due to parts supply problems in the late 1980s, so went on to basically 
manufacture almost everything: buying own machine shop equipment (CNC) 
Started Bicknell Racing Products with friend and crew chief Randy Williamson, 
and another friend Len Boperlawn (sp?) whose father owned a machine shop 
and he was great on the CNC end of it 
After five years, his friend Lenny went on to found another company that makes 
tools – Pete went on to do the Machine Shop, and then 12 years ago Bob Slack 
joined the team as a partner 
Son-in-law partner in managing the Niagara Falls store, and his daughter 
helping out at both the St. Catharine’s 
Currently, there are basically three organizations: Peter Bicknell Automotive Inc. 
(retail sales in Canada), Bicknell Racing Products (manufacturing based in 
Canada), and Bicknell Racing Products USA (retail sales in US and International) 
Family relationship between Randy Williamson and Matt Williamson, and Bob 
Slack designed the Slack racing karts platform that he then sold to Jody Herriven, 
and Slack family going back long time (used to own Cayuga Speedway) 
  
[15:45] 
Description of Difference between Niagara Falls Store & St. Catharine’s 
Manufacturing 
 
 
Niagara Falls store being a warehouse location, not having any manufacturing 
Walkthrough of building Dirt Modifieds from the ground up, about 75% of 
everything is built from the ground up: chassis, body (sheet metal)  
Building rollcages for different classes 
Having 11 different CNC equipment in their machine shop, so build just about 
everything (only thing not built is transmission, seats, and few other things) 
Most of the cars are made out of Aluminum, with the roll cages / chassis being 
steel 
In 2020, built 250 chassis (a record) – with Covid thought would be down, but 
they’ve already built 360 chassis this year at time of interview (July 2021), and 
their season is usually September to September 
Having about ‘4 classes’ that use that dirt modified chassis, and any given week 
there might be around 1000 Bicknell chassis running at one time 
Description of Limited Sportsman Class, which is a popular starter class in that 
body style  
 
[20:55]  
Changes in Chassis and Rules 
Discussion of changes over the years made to their chassis, and testing it ahead 
of time before committing to a design change 
1990/1-2000 had a ‘down tube chassis’ style similar to a Sprint Car, and in 2000 
developed a new chassis style 
Four years ago (2017) developed a ‘Short Link’ chassis, sheet metal being the 
same / transferring over, but suspension is very different, cars becoming more 
consistent 
Description of how in old days, feels there was a lot more reliant on driver 
relationship with the ‘quirks’ of their car, where now everything is a lot more 
equal and on similar footing for the most part: which has led to it becoming 
extremely competitive now too 
Having specific drivers that do ‘experimenting’ for them in terms of testing out 
new things and new ideas – and new idea either working or not working.  
DIRT rules not changing too much over the years, and is pretty rigid – but there’s 
also enough space to kind of make new 
 
[24:45]  
Description of Short Length Coil Style of Bicknell Chassis (2017-) 
Main difference being that usually there were torsion bars in the rear suspension, 
where with Short Link Coil, it’s basically four short coils that go up to short 
radius bar that then go up to the chassis 
The new style turns really quick and responds quickly, compared to the torsion 
bars, and rolls a lot more responsive: inspired by Late Model 
Discussion also the addition of a front left bar to that helps with turning into 
corners in the new chassis design 
With the new cars, they really go into corners much faster and respond faster 
going in and out of the corners – so to stay competitive it’s basically overtaken 
the older torsion bar  
Description of how the funny thing being that old timers like him, didn’t really 
take to it in the early years they rolled it out, because it ‘knocks your head 
around’ as it feels so different, and have to drive it harder with more throttle and 
bounced around it 
That the younger generation and go karters really take to the Short Link 
suspension well, compared to the oldtimers, and that it handles and responds 
similar to a kart almost. 
 
[30:45] 
Challenges in Bicknell Racing Products Over the Years Including Challenges 
They’ve Been Able to Avoid 
Staying up to date and in stock with product / parts supplies for drivers in the 
area 
Importance of a lot of long time employees that have stuck around, many since 
the late 70s or 80s, and having really skilled and knowledgeable employees has 
helped avoid a challenge some other companies have had with being able to 
keep up with demand and weekly needs 
Covid’s impact on supplies coming in has been difficult, including raw material 
shortages (steel), racing fuel shortage, tire shortages, etc. 
No major impact on Border Closure, as for manufacturing trucks can go back 
daily anyway back and forth 
The major negative impact, is not being able to cross the border personally: it 
was the first time in 47 years that he has not gone to Ransomville to race 
Impact of border closure on Merritville in Canada and Ransomville in USA, in 
terms of fans and drivers not being able to compete / see races so close-by that 
have in previous years.  
90% of sales are primarily out of the US store, which has not been too negatively 
impacted 
 
[37:50]  
Beginning Discussion of Racing Career 
Starting out in Late Models, but mostly races now at the 358 Dirt Modifieds, a 
little bit horsepower than the big blocks but still competitive with their power 
In 1980 won the track championship at Ransomville with a ‘small block’ against 
the big block modifieds, and that’s how he got the nickname ‘Mr. Small Block’ 
which is associated with him throughout the DIRT racing scene 
Went from Late Models into Modifieds around 1977, starting with the big blocks, 
then went into the small block after having string of bad luck with big blocks, 
and switched to a small block and ended up winning at Humberstone so that is 
how it started with the small blocks 
George Glasgow (who works at Bicknell on the American side), built his engines 
back then, including the small blocks 
Description of championships he’s won at multiple tracks, including over 400 
feature wins 
 
[42:05]  
Changes in Racing 
Description of changes in how the cars work and handle in racing modifieds, that 
in the past they didn’t handle as well, and there was always a lot of variety 
Over years as finding things that work, things more ‘cookie cutter’ and being 
able to plug and play and find direct replacements, where in past it was more 
different ideas all trying to find and fix things  
Back in the early years too no one really bought a complete car or roller, but now 
that’s more common 
 
[44:00] 
Walkthrough of Race Week, Description of Important Maintenance, and 
Differences in Tires Over the Years  
Description of his crew and how they work on the car during the week, with him 
working and maintaining the engine, and the work they all do on it throughout 
the week 
Racing at Ransomville Friday night, and then Saturday morning clearing out the 
car 
Point championships that he has won in past, he feels has been down to 
consistency especially and not breaking down – and being very fussy about the 
maintenance 
Description of grooving a tire and ‘siping’, similar to snow tires, as it helps to bite 
and give better traction 
Story demonstrating the importance of grooving and siping a tire, and how 
important tire prep, including grinding the tires – and that being the biggest 
maintenance problem and need really 
Dirt not being ‘dirt’, but more like Clay, in that it does have bite, and that can get 
better bite in Dirt and Clay than in Asphalt 
Discussion of differences in tires from the old days to now 
 
[51:00]   
Walkthrough of Race Day and Stagger 
Crossing the border to race, not really being an issue unless there was a lineup 
then that’s a big problem: usually border is only a few minutes to cross but if 
there’s a lineup (traffic) can spend up to an hour 
Walkthrough of their race day on arriving at the track, starting with first 
checking into the pits, to hot laps, the heat, and on 
Changes in dirt conditions throughout a night, and from night to night: dustier 
tracks not as good for ‘side by side’ racing or multiple lanes 
Description of Stagger and balancing your weights including air pressure 
Description of a saying you’ll hear drivers say that they are “chasing the track”: 
which means that whoever really stays the most up to date with the changing 
track conditions does the best 
 
 
 
 
[57:20]  
Skills Needed in Racing 
Learning how to control a car and not letting the car control you, and getting the 
three parts all in sync and working together (e.g. gas application, brake 
application, eye, etc.) 
 
 
Importance of reaction time 
Knowing track conditions, and importance of traveling to seeing different tracks 
and configurations and how that can help with your home track 
 
 
Example of fine tuning things through the example of modifying the gear ratio 
Running different classes from TQ Midgets to Late Models, Asphalt, etc.: all 
relates to the same – if you can race in one, you can race in another, and over the 
years is important to develop appreciation for all different classes of racing 
Importance of psychological and mental dimension to racing – knowing yourself 
and your competitors – there’s certain things all drivers make mistakes on 
(including yourself): ‘dirt track university’ something organized both at the track 
and away from the track- kind of a class setup for drivers 
Importance of watching all the classes racing and keeping internal notes to refer 
to after, e.g. how you setup your car like air pressure, gear ratio, etc. so can go 
back to figure out if it worked or didn’t work 
 
[1:03:05] 
Proudest Moment Racing and Bad Wrecks 
Winning at Syracuse, and it was televised at the time too, and winning the last 
big block race that was there at the Fairgrounds 
Number of wrecks and close calls over the years, story of in his early years in 
1977 in New York, taking a chip out of the concrete wall and rolling the car 
One bad wreck in Ransomville, ended up in St. Mary’s (hospital up in Lewiston), 
made him miss Merritville on Saturday for the first time 
Getting caught in a 10 car pileup going over 120 miles per hour, only part of the 
car that was ‘salvageable’ / able to keep was the roof panel 
 
[1:06:30] 
Enjoyment in Racing and Advice 
Enjoys the thrill and challenge of it, and the fun and adrenaline rush: but also is 
something that he’s been doing for just about his whole life 
The saying in dirt track of it all being ‘one big family’, and that it really is, a 
competitive family: e.g. being friends but also competing as hard as can against 
one another 
Discussion of advice for potential drivers, that you have to feel it is fun and need 
to start with the right equipment or product, talking to other people – unlike 
other sports, in dirt track racing pretty much everyone will tell you what you 
want to be competitive – because everyone wants everyone to run best, as those 
are the best races the really competitive ones 
Importance of being safe in the sport also, and making sure not to skimp out on 
safety stuff 
If interested in the mechanical side or manufacturing side of that, race teams are 
always looking for people looking to learn to help in maintaining it: story of 
Stewart Friesen working with them, traveling with them for a year 
Bicknell Racing Products also always looking for qualified employees and people 
with knowledge in building and selling, and not just Bicknell – but all other race 
companies are always looking for help because it’s a skilled trade / always in 
need of skilled manufacturers 
Reflection on dirt track racing being a family affair if involved and that passion is 
passed down is a real bond-producing sport: that you have so many 3rd and 4th 
generations still racing,
