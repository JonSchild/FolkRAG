This small sign sits at the roadside announcing the location of Johnson Creek Clay Studio, owned by Rick Hintze. 
Since the building is in the middle of a residential block, the sign must be small and visitors sometimes have 
difficulty finding the shop.

This view shows Rick Hintze’s work area, which is visible from the entrance to the studio, but somewhat removed 
from the display area for pottery.

This wheel is a kick wheel, which is operated by the potter’s foot (rather than electricity). The pan is filled with 
trimmings that have fallen off when Rick used the wheel to trim a pot.

against the wall.

These shelves in Rick’s studio hold unfinished pots. In the upper left are some examples of the architectural work 
he has been making. Also on the upper shelf are some lidded jars. The lower shelves hold some mugs, and some 
stacked bowls (an upside-down bowl sits on top of a right-side-up bowl, with their lips aligned).

These shelves in Rick’s studio hold unfinished pots. Here are a selection of jars of similar size, but not quite the 
same.

This is Rick’s gas kiln, which is located in a separate building near to his studio. It is a car kiln; the door and floor 
are on wheels, and pull out of the main structure of the kiln so that it can be more easily loaded and unloaded.

This is Rick’s gas kiln, which is located in a separate building near to his studio. Here you can see dozens of used 
cone packs, which are placed in the kiln and viewed through peek holes to judge the temperature of the kiln. The 
cones, which are made of the same material as clays and glazes, sit upright at first, but begin to melt and thus fall 
over as the kiln gets hotter. The potter can tell how hot the kiln is by how far the cones have melted.

This part of the studio is typically only used for display shelves during busy times such as the pottery tour. These 
shelves currently showcase the variety of styles of pottery that Rick Hintze makes.

These shelves of pottery greet visitors as they enter the studio. While most of Rick’s work is thrown on the 
potter’s wheel, the large pieces sitting on top of the shelf to the left were hand built using coils.

Some of Rick Hintze’s cups and vases are on display on these shelves in his studio. The stairs (barely visible to 
the right) lead up to the second floor where his wife, who primarily does 2D work, has her own studio.

Rick Hintze examines a pot on display in his studio as he discusses the various kinds of glazes and surface 
decoration he uses on his pottery.

These two plates or platters were made out of slabs of clay. Much of Rick Hinze’s work is made on the potter’s 
wheel, but he uses some other hand building methods, as well.

A variety of Rick Hintze’s pottery is on display on these shelves in his studio. The three larger pieces were hand 
built using coils. Other, smaller pieces (such as cups, mugs, bowls, and plates) are all thrown on the potter’s 
wheel. While the larger pieces could be thrown, Rick enjoys the process of building these by hand.

the building.

This photo, provided by Rick Hintze, showcases one of his tea bowls. The piece was thrown on the wheel, and the 
sides were then cut to give it a faceted look.
