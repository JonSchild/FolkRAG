Discussion of fires started by the military 
airplanes dropping whatever they drop 
in 
the area. 
Many fires 
started this way. 
(015) 
Differences in fire fighting techniques now 
versus seventy years ago. 
No roads then, or airplanes fighting 
fires, and none of the chemicals they have now. 
(025) 
Fire of 1963 was the last major fire. 
Planes 
couldn't get off the ground due to high winds. 
75,000 acres 
in 
12 hours. 
Started near G—Magnolia; 21GT and down to Lebanon 
Forest, over to Mt. Misery. 
Description of how hot it was. 
Book 
Silas has shows over 160,000 acres burned that weekend. 
Six big 
fires 
in all. 
Picture of one of the fires 
in Forman's Pine 
Barrens book. 
The picture is on the frontispiece of the book. 
(080) 
Definition of "Crown Fire." 
Running through the 
crowns of the trees. 
In cedar swamp, 
large fire, steady wind, 
could explode from the cedar foliage up to the crowns of the 
trees even though the ground is water. 
(90) 
Discussion of "back fire"— 
where head road comes 
out, take a sand road or barrier and set fire. 
If wind steady 
the backfire will burn against the wind. 
It can force the head 
fire to a standstill. 
Chimney effect when the two fires come 
together, and possibility of sparks setting spot fires ahead. 
Spot fires can be one half to a mile ahead on a given day, and 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel

ash carries even further. 
After a mile or two no flame left in 
ash usually. 
(120) Tools that used to be used — pitchforks, shovels, 
rakes, pine boughs to beat out fires. 
Probably had torches to 
set fires, there were when Silas arrived on the scene. 
They also 
used portable pumps you could set 
in a stream and pump from 
there. 
These a supplement to the back pack hose units. 
Pumps 
could be used on deep burning fires where there are thick organic 
layers, e.g., 
in swamps during the dry period (October/Nov.). 
Back packs still used on small fires and outside the Pine Barrens 
because fires burn lighter than in. 
(140) 
Fire companies from north Jersey train down here 
because the fires are so fierce. 
Similar to eastern North 
Carolina and Long Island and Cape Cod. 
Many fires in 
all 
these 
areas, all pitch pines and oaks with sandy soils. 
Sheep sorrel, 
leather leaf and other highly flammable shrubbery common to these 
areas also. 
Sufficient heat to get black smoke. 
(160) 
Prescribed Fire — another name for controlled 
burning. 
One first studies Silas worked on involved 80 acres, 16 
5 acre units, then split to make 32. 
Involved prescribed fires 
at 15 year intervals. 
Followed changes on overstory and effect 
on growth, change 
in understory. 
Also discontinued burning and 
cut, and studied change in composition after that. 
Years ago, common custom was to burn around villages, 
cranberry bogs, and isolated buildings. 
Better timber left by 
1930 occurred in these areas. 
Less fuel 
in these fires and most 
of the strong trees survived. 
Requirements of growth for pitch 
pines said light debris was needed, but not thick brush growth. 
Pine seedling 
only an 
inch above ground and root system very 
shallow. 
Stand can't make it through leaves when competing with 
oak. 
Oak acorn has lots of reserve food. 
Oak seedling grows to 
3 or four inches. 
Oak adapted to starting in debris. 
More shade 
tolerant too. 
(230) Original stands probably burned by Indians for ease of 
movement through woods. 
Original forest, parklike stands (trees 
5-10 feet apart from each other) with little undergrowth. 
Have 
to have frequent fires to have parklike stands. 
No burning and oaks will take over. 
Climax forest would probably oak and hickory in this area 
with lots of blueberry and huckleberry undergrowth. 
Climax means 
that's the forest that would maintain itself. 
Pictures in 
Kozlowski and Ahldren's FIRE AND ECOSYSTEMS. 
(270) 
Discussion of results of fire on pine trees. 
Usually 
have on upland sites pitch pines that survive because of thick 
bark. 
Sometimes sprouting occurs low on the trunk because the 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
crown 
is ruined. 
Often pines have crook at same height. 
In that 
case fire killed upper part of stem where bark is thin and buds 
not protected enough. 
New growth forms at angle to dead stub . 
Makes for picturesque trees. 
Pines survive as seedlings during fire because they have 
basal crook that is a bend in the seedling that forces dormant 
buds next to soil, and these are protected during fire. 
These 
buds then send tree up. 
Stem is killed and sprouts start to come 
up 
(365) 
State plans for controlled burning. 
Areas prepared 
and choose right times (hopefully). 
Silas began working on these 
prescribed fires over forty years ago.

(001) Talking about rules of thumb when prescribed burning. 
After Thanksgiving, sometimes not until the first of the year. 
They can usually be set until the middle of March. 
Can go later 
sometimes if you burn at night. 
Keep flames low and burn when 
temp. 
is 
less than 40 degrees. 
Fire can't heat up fast then. 
Since it keeps moving heat can be dissipated rapidly. 
Wind 
stands in relationship to temp., fuel conditions. 
Need enough 
wind to carry the fire, and 
it should be steady. 
Often back the 
fire between plowed lines. 
Fuels have to be dry to do this. 
Danger is that back fire can become head fire if wind shifts. 
When fuels are moister you can burn with the wind. 
Don't reduce 
fuels as much when you burn with the wind. 
Skim the top usually. 
Takes more than one fire to bring things down. 
Often try to get 
two or three fires in. 
(45) Story — 1946-7 or so, Silas told boss he had set off a 
150 acre piece, started about 3:45 and were ready to go home at 
4:30. 
He said to Silas that "your tail's gonna be right in the 
gate" one of these times. 
Actually Silas and his crew went back 
in the evening to make sure everything was under control. 
TX02: G—Forked River; 49GT (60) Discussing Cliff Frazee's cedar 
cutting operation. 
I asked Silas's opinion of brush protecting 
cedar seedlings after clear cutting an area. 
Will the area grow 
back into cedar? 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 4 
Cedar has a million seeds per acre roughly. 
Deer are 
primary problem in regenerating cedar. 
Large # of seedlings 
start and can all 
be eaten by deer if footing 
is good and deer 
population is high. 
Slash is a problem. 
Cedar won't come up 
through it 
if 
it's dense. 
If slash 
is 
light you can get cedar 
reproduction. 
Highly questionable to have slash protection and 
protection from deer simultaneously. 
If deer pop. 
is down, area can come back 
in cedar. 
Of 
course maple and black gum will come back too. 
Probably twenty 
year gap 
if deer pop. 
is high, before enough shrub to protect 
growth of cedar. 
Hardwoods will take the site if enough 
seedlings. 
If not cedar will grow in after shrubs grow enough. 
Rooting medium like soup. Deer pull when chewing and pull 
seedlings up root and all. 
Shrubs help hold the cedar shoots up. 
Cedar produces seed 
at an early age. 
That helps. 
Will have cones at a couple of 
feet high. 
Shallow bogs around here. 
North Jersey could be 30-40 feet. 
Here usually 6-7- feet. 
Cedar roots shallow, within the top 
three or four feet. 
Difficult for trees to stand. 
Often get 
"wind throws" as a result of rooting medium is 
like soup. 
They 
lean on each other more or less. 
One way existing old stands are 
eliminated is 
by a wind throw. 
Original stands quite old. 
Some 
cedar as many as 1,080 rings, 6-7 feet in diameter. 
Original stands 
began to open up when trees 2-300 years old. 
(170) Wood was the economy. 
First products were naval 
stores, pitch, turpentine, tar and resin. 
Along with furs and 
lumber these were the first exports out of south Jersey. 
Peter 
Calm's Travels talks about "exterpating" here 
in 1750. 
Lumber 
shipped to West Indies 
in those days. 
Cooke in Geology of Cape 
May County written in 1857 thought there was not .an acre of 
original cedar left. 
Most swamps had been cut at least 3 times 
since settlement. 
Present stands occupy stands that have been 
cut 4, 5, 
or 6 times. 
Acreage is way down though. 
Part of the reason for fewer cedars 
is cranberry culture, 
and the return to hardwood swamps. 
Also artificial 
lakes and 
developments. 
On coast, 
lost cedar to salt marsh with rising sea 
level. 
Same true of uplands - short cutting rotation. 
Maybe 
17sloops leaving coastal town loaded with firewood, Civil War 
time. 
history, wood processing 
TX03: 
(215) 
Discussion of use of wood as fuel. 
Anthracite 
replaced wood as fuel 
in 
1830s. 
Locomotives were wood fire 
through Civil War. 
Industry didn't leave here until then. 
Glass 
works moved out too then. 
Wood still used as fuel up through 
World 
War II. 
Then even local folks went to fuel oil. 
Now 
trend back. 
On uplands guesstimate is forty year rotation for 
charcoal. 
Near the shore where they loaded roundwood could have 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 5 
been 25-30 year rotation. 
history 
(250) Re charcoal mounds - Construction depended on what 
was available. 
Pine charcoal was used for medicine as well. 
Filters perhaps. 
Other uses in drug industry as well. 
Oak used 
for charcoal as well. 
Clear cut areas to make charcoal. 
Story 
was people started fires so they could buy land cheaper and use 
it for charcoal. 
Construction - almost like an 
igloo, or tepee. 
Picture 
shown. 
Mounds 6 feet high. 
Sand covering the whole thing made 
from pulling out huckleberry plants by roots and upending them 
and putting them on the logs 
in conical shape. 
There were gaps, 
a center pole, and they could regulate amount of air going in. 
Needed a slow burn to get charcoal. 
So they weren't pits, but above ground. 
Picture is 
in 
Forman's PINE BARRENS ECOSYSTEM AND LANDSCAPE on p. 26. 
Mosses 
and lichens often grow in these spots due to the burning of the 
area. 
No oaks, sometimes pines if 
its been long enough since the 
charcoaling. 
Some of the pits had a center pole. They would put a 
kindling material 
in the center. 
Then they put shorter lengths 
first sloping up and go to about 5 foot lengths. 
Charcoaling 
took about 3-4 days at least. 
Silas didn't really know. 
Someone had to be there all 
the time to see that it burned 
correctly. 
TX04: (345) 
Question about local customs conflicting with the 
law. 
Silas answered by talking about use of fire throughout the 
U.S. 
Big push to try to exclude fire. Beginning in 
late 20's 
people began to advocate use of fire ecologically. 
Using fire 
in 
Jersey and South long before California. 
All 
citizens had to do to burn on private land was get a 
permit from the fire organization. 
This goes back 50-60 years.

(001) 
Before doing any controlled burning a person should 
notify the State Forest Service, and the State Police if you will 
be burning near a highway; Township Police also. 
Otherwise 
people will phone in and the fire company and police will arrive 
at your land. 
(10) Question about conflict between public authorities and 
private local customs. 
Silas said it depends on who owns the 
land. 
Many people poach wood off state land, 
including many 
large businesses. 
law enforcement 
Story about one man who had been selling cutting rights all 
his life and he never owned any land. 
Some deeds are 
interesting, selling the east half, the west half, the north 
half, the south half, and the whole parcel 
to 5 different 
parties. 
(025) 
Any trouble for burning your own land? 
Only if 
it 
gets out of control and damaged someone else's land. 
Farm Bureau 
used to offer insurance to cover that. 
Silas doesn't know if 
they still do. 
(038) 
Story about people complaining about smoke from 
burning in Feb. when they lived miles away. 
TX02: (045) 
Have the people of the Pinelands used the land well? 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 7 
Silas said there have only been a few responsible land owners. 
They suffer from the activities of others who are careless, 
through fire or theft, or damage. 
There has been too much rape 
of the resources and not enough consideration to proper use so a 
good legacy is 
left to the next generation. 
Part of the problem is the cedar swamps. 
The deer lick you 
after cutting. 
This 
is a State Game problem. 
Too many deer. 
Hunting clubs want them. 
State Fish and Game would probably like 
to reduce the pop. of deer. 
But hunters want to shoot more does 
and have longer seasons. 
There is a book on Doe Day that 
describes this problem north of Trenton. 
There 
is a conflict between landowners who want to see fewer 
deer, groups who want more, often to hunt. 
(095) 
Improper cutting is also a problem. 
If you cut the 
best trees you genetically downgrade the growing stock. 
A lot of 
the pines 
in the Barrens are not as good as the original stand. 
Silas has worked on projects that grow hybrids, e.g., pitch and 
loblolly pine, that are stronger and faster growing, with fewer 
branches, meaning fewer knots when turned into boards. 
Question about how to improve management. 
Silas said you can 
only give advice. 
There was an effort made by the state to have 
more foresters, but with cutbacks that has changed. 
These 
foresters worked with private owners to assist them in managing 
their land. 
The state has trouble with their own 
land. 
conservation 
(135) 
Discussion of Cliff Frazee's fire breaks every 500 
feet and his clearing of 600 acres of pine and cedar swamp. 
He 
is surrounded by thick brush land owned by others. 
This seems 
self defeating. 
State Forest did make prescribed burning plans for private 
land owners. 
There have been partial payment plans for certain 
land management practices. 
Agric. Culture Conservation Plan at 
the federal 
level was in charge of this. 
A lot of those funds 
have gone. 
Could this type of thing be effective in the future? 
Silas 
said that if the Pinelands Commission expects to do much they 
need to force the issue. 
If they want to retain land 
in woods 
and 
in private ownership, some sort of help should be available 
to the owners if they wish to have some monetary return from 
their woodland. 
(180) 
Re the shape of those guidelines Silas said 
Comprehensive Plan of the Pineland Commission contains some of 
that type of guideline; and Bobby Sanpello is going to revise 
them and send them out for comment again. 
Trouble is getting 
them applied. 
And will the cedar, for example, get by the deer? 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 8 
We could grow trees 85-90 feet tall 
in 50 years 
in the 
Pinelands that would produce pilings and poles. 
Plywood 
construction material could be produced also. 
Pulp requires only 
a short rotation period. 
A problem would be getting the proper 
treatments made and protecting from wildfires. 
Treatments 
involve using the best of natural reproduction or go with 
hybrids. 
Must get the competition reduced to get the trees you 
want to dominate. 
(210) 
Question about short term profitability and long term 
returns for private landowners. Is this a problem? 
Silas said 
that 50 years ago the State could have had much land for nothing. 
A lot of 
it was tax deliquent. 
Recently development has been 
favorable. 
People figure they can expect to sell for a profit. 
There used to be all 
sorts of 
land schemes 
in the past. 
They brought people 
in on the railroad. 
A friend of Silas' 
showed an outsider (my term) a piece of 
land he had purchased 
from afar. 
The guy was from Brooklyn and was asking Silas' 
friend if he could sell sand. 
His friend waved his hand all 
over. 
Sand and gravel pits are sometimes a problem in the 
Pinelands also. 
Around 38-40 people began to realize the return they could 
get on their land. 
Everything was sold, good wood, pulp, and 
stumps. 
People were willing to spend money to get a good crop of 
pine back. 
This is true for many East coast areas. 
Around here 
though there hasn't been much 
in the way of possible financial 
return due to fire, haphazard cutting and so forth. 
If you did 
invest often a fire from someplace else would wipe you out. 
Some companies looked at what is now Wharton State Forest. 
They didn't buy 
it because of the problem of not being able to 
know if they could get a crop through. 
(Pulp companies) 
TX03: (275) 
Discussion of gun clubs. 
There were certain clubs 
made up of 
local people, but a lot are made up of people from 
outside the Pinelands. 
They bought enough land to put up a 
building. 
These groups have some influence on the Fish and Game 
Commission because of license money. 
Doe Day gives a good idea of the conflicts between groups. 
Also, when the CCC was building recreation areas they had no 
idea 
they would be used by so many people. 
Big buildup after World 
War II 
in recreational use of this area. 
Many of the private 
campgrounds in the Pinelands are probably within the last 15-20 
years. 
A lot of the pressure has shifted. 
Conflicts also between 
the hikers, horseback riders, and dirt bike riders. 
Who gets 
priority? 
Story about hikers complaining about the very thing 
bikers had just complained about, each other. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
(345) 
Question about possible room for all 
these interest 
groups. Silas said they all 
have to yield some,. Certain things 
are compatible. 
If wanting to grow wood products, many 
conditions for wildflowers are the same as those for desirable 
trees. 
In swamps sundews, pitcher plants, and a lot of the 
orchids share growing conditions with the 
cedar. 
But if want to 
maintain plains squirrels, certainly not going to have any wood 
production out of a plains area. 
Must have frequent enough fires. 
An open bog favors curly grass fern.

They're going to have to designate certain trails. 
The number of canoers must be regulated somehow, or spread 
throughout a number of waterways. recreation, 
land management 
(005) 
About the deer problem, their population should be 
managed. 
State biologists would go along with this. 
Trying to 
placate all the different groups 
is difficult. 
Many groups think 
only of themselves. 
Hikers often think only hiking should take 
place on the trails. 
Bikers and four wheel drive people should 
have regulated places where they can go. 
Question about whether there 
is room for everybody. 
Its up 
to the land managers to determine priority Silas said. 
The only 
way they'll know they are doing well 
is when everyone is unhappy. 
TX02: (plant) (030) 
About sphagnum moss. 
Where does 
it grow best? 
Grows in cedar and hardwood swamps, particularly in the hollows. 
Up to a few years ago some people around Chatsworth 
spread moss 
out to dry and there were balers to bale it. 
Before plastic 
bubbles it was used 
in packing, and nursery people used to 
like 
it too. 
If 
it were competitive in price 
it would probably still 
be favored. 
Stock from the State Nursery shipped stock 
in 
plastic bags and the plants dried out. 
They are going back to 
sphagnum. 
With enough shrub cover and leaf litter sphagnum would 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 11 
disappear. 
Cedar swamp areas don't have too many shrubs and the 
sites are moist and tend to have most of the ground surface 
covered with sphagnum. 
Gathering cones for the florist trade is another trade 
similar to the gathering sphagnum moss. 
Some people gathered 
wild huckleberries (wild blueberries) and wild cranberries. 
These people worked on other peoples' 
land, 
i.e., they did not 
own the land themselves. 
(105) 
Gathering -- Silas thinks there are not as many people 
gathering moss, cones, etc. as there used to be. 
He has also 
seen evidence that some of them are still active. 
TX03: (115) Question about the difference between the Uplands and 
the Plains. 
The Plains is part of the Upland sites in the Pine 
Barrens. 
The Uplands are the excessively well drained areas down 
to the upper portion of the imperfectly drained soils. 
Where 
there are scrub oaks and blueberry, huckleberry complex are not 
the large number of shrub species you get in the pine lowlands. 
There 
is 
no difference in soil 
of the Upland Plains and the 
Upland Forest. 
Part of the Plains have sassafras soils. 
This 
has been shown to be good for tree growth in other areas of the 
country. 
The problem with the Plains is not due to soil. 
Two 
PhD studies, one by Harold Lutz and the other by John Andrieson, 
that point to frequent wild fires rather than soil 
as a reason 
why there are few trees. 
The ones there are are "precocious," 
i.e., they bear a lot of cones at an early age. 
These are closed 
cones usually. 
Protected from fire they would be thirty feet 
tall 
at 50 years. 
Other pitch pines in the wooded areas could be 
up to 70 feet tall 
in the same time span 
if fire were prevented. 
Harold Lutz found charcoal pits in the Plains areas. 
Some 
of the areas that were plains when Silas appeared on the scene 
are not plains anymore. 
Plains by definition are lands with 
trees less than 11 feet tall predominantly. 
Silas gave us an article he wrote on the soil 
v. 
fire issue 
published by the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club. 
Jan.— 
March, 1981. 
"Implications from the Growth of Pinus Rigida 
(pitch pine) Implanted in the Pine Plains." 
Silas mentioned that there have been many beginnings of 
studies where hypotheses are publicized. 
Unfortunately the 
follow—ups are not. 
One problem that may have led to the creation of some of 
the plains might have been the fires that people lit near their 
towns to keep the brush down. 
The theory is that they lit them 
and just let them go out on 
their own wherever they stopped. 
Out of sight, out of mind. 
TX04: (220) 
Question about fire departments in the area. 
Silas 
said that volunteer people come out. 
Story — A few years ago a 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 12 
volunteer fire co. near Bass River picked up a surplus tanker 
from the Defense Dept. 
They took 
it to a fire in the woods. 
Three or four of them went out. 
The state fire people didn't 
know they were out there. 
No one knew where they were. 
They 
found where the tanker blew up, and they found the men's bodies 
where they had tried to run. 
The volunteer fire depts. 
help a lot 
in protecting improved 
property. 
Woods fires behave in strange ways, so fire companies 
in and near the woods often know more about woods fire fighting 
than those farther away. 
Sometimes people from all over come to fight the fire, but 
about 2-3 hundred stand by the road and watch the fire while 
often only 5 or so are doing the work. 
Most of them might as 
well 
go home as far as doing anything is concerned. 
Fire must be treated with enough respect and knowledge and 
common sense. 
State crews put out state and private land fires. 
The 
problem often occurs on military land with dropping shells. 
These often start fires. 
TX05: (290) Discussion of who owns the land. Some big land 
holdings around Chatsworth, Silas said, e.g., the DeMarcos, Steve 
Lee, and Bill Haines. 
Silas gave me an article about Bill Haines 
and stealing wood. 
This did not get very far. 
(325) 
Question about how Silas would like to see land 
managed in the future. 
He said first they must figure they must 
figure their priorities, and concentrate on 
leaving a good legacy 
to the next generation. 
My comment about when one talks about a 
tree one seems to be talking in 100 year, or at least multi— 
generational terms. 
Silas said this depends on the product 
desired. 
Trees after 25 years can be 
in some cases 75 feet tall. 
In Brazil, 16 years after planting grow to 96 feet tall and are 
18-19 inches 
in diameter. 
We could grow better trees and have 
greater production, and create more aesthetically pleasing, park— 
like stands if the land were managed. 
(366) 
Silas thinks priorities should be up to the owners, 
state or private, to decide. 
He never invested money in 
land 
over there, although he did invest a lot of sweat, so he said he 
could not speak as a land owner.

Discussion of 
loblolly /pitch hybrid. Witmer 
Stone said that the loblolly was native to Southern N.J., but 
this 
is not too widely accepted I gather from Silas' 
intonation. 
Silas said that since it was not discovered until 1890 it may 
have been brought across the bay and introduced into South 
Jersey. The flowering seasons don't overlap for the two trees, 
but occasionally do and you get natural hybrids. 
This 
is a 
comment about those who say that no nonindigenous trees should be 
grown 
in the Pinelands. 
Promotion of natural hybridization would help to counter 
the damage of hundreds of years of taking the good trees and 
having a genetically poor pitch pine forest. 
Could use the 
higher grade lumber for 
pulp, planking, pilings, etc. 
Story from a bulletin on pitch pine 
in Pennsylvania about 
someone who had 18 inch wide floorboards in a house. 
When it was 
torn down people took the floorboards and used them in the new 
house. 
Remarkable how useful they were for how long. 
Pine could be used for plywood also. 
The farthest north 
plant on the East Coast is on the Eastern Shore of Maryland right. 
now. 
Silas feels he was lucky to not have been a specialist early 
on. 
And he was involved 
in proposing use of fire and that was 
very controversial. Even now it seems to be a suggestion people 
like to hear about when it 
is used somewhere else. 
Fire is a 
natural tool.

Chemicals are also used to fight fire. 
Some which have been 
banned for use 
in fighting fires are still used, 
legally, 
in 
farming.

TXO1: G—Forked River; 49GT (001) 
Cliff born next door to where he 
lives now (pale yellow clapboard house), 
in his grandparents (on 
his father's side) house. 
Father built house to the east of 
where they now live 
in 1925, and he was raised there. 
Cliff's 
father built the house because he had just gotten married, and 
Cliff was about four years old when 
it was built. 
Cliff is 
the 
oldest child. 
His father wanted a house of his own. 
He was 
just starting out. 
Cliff's father worked on Barnegat Bay as an 
oysterman. 
(022) 
The oysters began to disappear in the 30's. 
First 
"they" claimed it was the oyster bore, and then the change 
in the 
water. 
Most of the towns along the shore near Forked River 
depended on the oyster business for livelihood. 
When the oyster 
business folded, the towns folded. 
Not an oyster in this bay 
anymore. 
Combination of reasons: 
the oyster is very 
sensitive. 
When they made the Manesquan Canal, 
it gave the oyster too much 
salt water. 
Before that they had the correct mixture of fresh 
and salt water. 
Oysters need the environment just right. 
The 
only place we have oysters now is Delaware Bay. 
Elaine asked about oysters in Great Bay and Cliff said he 
did not think there were many there. 
You had to go to Bivalve to 
find oysters. 
But its a dying industry even there. 
(045) 
RE the oyster bore — it was some kind of a worm that 
ate through the oyster shell and killed it. 
Don't know how it 
got here. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
(050) 
Cliff's father rented oyster lots from the state. 
When no more oysters he went bankrupt. 
Invested a lot of money 
in plants. 
He farmed oysters. 
He put seed oysters along the 
beds and hoped they would get big enough to harvest. 
He lost the 
money 
in the mid 30's. 
Cliff used to steer the boat in circles 
around the lots while his father dredged for the oysters. 
(070) 
Oyster lots were marked by stakes. 
A lot might have 
been about ten acres. 
His father re-marked the lots every year 
because the ice would take the stakes out. 
Oysters the biggest 
industry around, especially G-Lanoka Harbor; 44GT, north of Forked 
River, and 
in G-Bayville; 49GT. 
They didn't have clams to 
supplement the oyster harvest like Forked River. 
They were too 
far up 
in the fresh water area. 
Oysters didn't need much salt 
water (but clams did). 
(082) Elaine asked Cliff 
if 
he would have become a bayman 
if 
the oysters had not disappeared. He said he probably would have. 
He said he worked in the bay for quite a period of time, 
clamming, trying eels and everything. 
But he says the bay 
is 
dying out due to developing and population. 
Clamming is one 
quarter of what it was 25 years ago. 
It's on the way out. 
Cliff 
was talking to Stanley Cottrell, a clam buyer, and he handled one 
million clams every three days. 
He shipped them to Pittsburgh 
and different cities. He's retired now. 
He thinks there is not 
enough salt water coming 
in the inlet anymore to reproduce the 
clams. 
Cottrell also thinks the power plant is producing too 
much warm water. 
(100) 
The power plant -- 
it 
is three miles south of Forked 
River. 
There outflow goes directly into the center of the bay, 
opposite the inlet. 
Because the inlet doesn't produce enough 
salt water, the plant produces too much warm water; and it's not 
good for the clams. 
(110) 
What about these changes? 
Cliff says when you get 
into these big changes you are going to have environmental 
problems, and that is what we face now. 
Wherever there's a plant 
there are problems with shellfish and fish. 
You don't get a tax 
relief, but you get problems. 
By tax relief Cliff referred to 
the taxes, quite high, that the power company has to pay to run 
the plant on the land they have. This is a common point of view I 
have noticed. 
The Carneys (RLOGS M0010-013) also discussed the 
importance of taxes paid on 
land 
in a town. 
When the state buys 
land, for example, they pay less tax on the 
land than is paid 
when 
it 
is privately owned. 
This puts the burden of running the 
town on the shoulders of all 
the other people whose taxes go up. 
If they cannot afford it, 
they are often forced to move, and a 
different group of people begin to control the town. 
The 
important point here 
is that people in this area have a 
perspective on the town as a unit of understanding. 
They see the 
connectedness that binds them together. 
What is the fate of one

(120) 
Back to the township (I should have said that instead 
of town, perhaps, or maybe both apply) — The taxes go to Lacey 
Township and Cliff sees everyone thinking the extra money is a 
free handout, but really you're living with a problem over you 
head all 
the time. 
Anything can happen. 
And now there also all 
these environmental problems mentioned above. 
The plant has only 
ben here, not over 20 years, Cliff said. 
All 
these changes, 
"less of everything", have appeared in that amount of time. 
(130) 
Average bayman won't catch over 500 clams per day. 
When Cliff was clamming the average was 2000. 
Cliff clammed 
the 50's, before the plant. 
Cliff was born 
in 1921 and was about 14 when the 
crisis hit. 
The Depression hit at the same time

The Depression in Forked River -- Cliff said they

They also had a 
garden. 
There was no work though. 
People could go up

RE trapping. 
Lucille, Cliff's wife had urged him to 
tell 
us about his trapping when he was little. 
Cliff said he 
used to go out before daylight. 
There was a train from Barnegat 
to Forked River then. 
When the train got to Forked River, about 
a quarter to seven, Cliff knew it was time for him to get back 
and go to school. 
His father said that if Cliff didn't make some 
money he would 
put him in the CCC's, The Civilian Conservation 
Corps. 
Cliff didn't like that because it was something to keep 
you off the street. 
Lucille said that Cliff 
is a loner and 
doesn't like to be crowded in with a lot of people, that he 
is a 
loner. 
Cliff said the CCC was a good thing, and gave people 
something to do; gave them clothes and a dollar per day. 
Cliff 
said he would rather trap and stay home. 
He trapped muskrat, 
mink, and raccoon. 
He trapped on what were the meadows east of 
Forked River (now developed). 
He said he caught one or two 
muskrats per day, and they were worth 50 cents or a dollar. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 18 
Cliff would have to skin the muskrats out, and sell them for 
their fur. 
Sometimes he would ship them out. 
Sometimes a fella 
would come and pick them up. 
Cliff would stretch the fur out and 
dry them. 
He used to 
skin them out on the steps over home by 
nailing their tails to the steps. 
The holes go up the steps as 
he grew taller (they're still there). 
Cliff started trapping 
when he was six or seven. 
Lucille said, "Can you imagine walking 
all 
the way down a couple of miles on the meadows before school." 
She emphasizes here an 
important point about Cliff's character I 
think. 
He started out before daylight about 5 AM. 
Lucille said 
at this point, "And this 
is all walking, no bicycling," but Cliff 
interjected that he did have a bicycle. 
(215) 
Elaine asked if Cliff's mom had ways of cooking 
muskrat. 
Cliff said they never cooked it. 
There was a man, 
Harold Cain, who bought the muskrats from Cliff for 10 cents 
apiece. 
He loved to eat them. 
They were the cleanest animal 
there was, Cliff said, because they washed everything they ate 
and were vegetarian. 
Harold also took Cliff to the Philadelphia 
zoo for the first time 
in his life. 
That was a big thing for 
him. foodways 
(225) 
How Cliff got into the cedar business -- When he got 
married, Cliff tried to make some extra money by buying property. 
He would buy cedar swamps, starting in the 50's. 
Then he bought 
the mill that Steve has now. 
Then he also bought another mill 
he 
hasn't set up yet. 
He said he figured that was just as good a 
thing to do as anything else. 
Cliff began to work for the state 
in 1949. 
Before that he 
scooped cranberries and clammed, cut wood, 
"I done everything." 
"As the seasons went by I would ,ah, do different things. 
Like 
the cranberry season was only about six weeks, or two months. 
And then in the winter I might cut wood, and I done clamming." 
occupations, wood processing 
Cranberry months would be Sept. and Oct. 
Usually he would 
cut pulp wood after that, working for himself. 
In the warmer 
months Cliff said he would clam. 
He would clam right through the 
summer. 
(265) 
Question about what Lucille did during these times. 
Lucille said "Nothing" at first and then added "Four children." 
Lucille said she was born 
in Jersey City and stayed there until 
she got married, and then moved down to Forked River. Her family 
used to go to Bamber each summer, and the kids would stay there 
all 
summer long. 
They would also come down every weekend. 
Elaine asked about how Cliff and Lucille met. 
Cliff said, 
"She was hiding behind a pine tree." Lucille said she had an 
uncle who was a hunting friend of Cliff's. 
Cliff would come to 
the house, and "Just be there, that's all. 
And during the 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 19 
service, why he'd come to the house and we started going out and 
we were married." 
The joke about the pine tree refers to the 
fact that pine trees are all 
there 
is 
up 
in Bamber. 
(280) 
RE G—Bamber; 49GT: There were only about a dozen houses 
there. 
No electric, and only four families living there all 
year 
around. 
About three weeks before the electric came through, the 
house burned down. 
There was no fire company. 
Lucille 
remembered somebody saying what a beautiful picture that (fire) 
would make. 
The fire engine got there and didn't have any water 
in 
it. 
They had fought a fire 
in a field earlier that day, and 
they forgot to fill 
it up. 
But they built another house; 
it was 
insured. 
That was right after the war. 
(295) 
Cliff discusses travelling with Lucille's uncle. 
They hunted and had a saw mill. 
It didn't pan out, though, 
because it was small, and they were "Just trying out one thing 
after another, you know." 
Lucille said that her uncle was a 
person who liked you to do the work, and he would get all 
the 
money. 
The uncle was a bachelor. 
He was "all for himself." 
And 
he was a millionaire, and died a bachelor and a millionaire. 
Story about the uncle's will -- he was going leave all 
his 
money to his girl friend, and the rest to a scholarship to Lacey 
High School that didn't exist at the time. 
The rest was to go to 
some Indian tribe out West. 
He was 
in the process of making a 
new will when he died. 
As a result Lucille's sister, who was to 
get much money 
under the new will, didn't get any. Lawyers are 
still fighting over it. 
Lucille and Cliff noted that the lawyers 
will get all 
the money. 
Lucille's uncle made his money by buying land 
in Bamber that 
had gravel on 
it. 
(325) 
RE Gravel Pits: They are obviously very valuable. 
Cliff said that there is a law that if you dig down to water, you 
have to dig it at least five feet deep and make a lake out of 
it. 
Any shallower and you get problems from algae or stagnant water. 
You need to keep the water flowing under ground. 
Lucille said 
people dig down just so far and then go out of business. 
Cliff 
thinks the gravel pits are the biggest problem in the Pinelands 
now. 
They are an eyesore, and people lower the elevation as much 
as 20 or 30 feet. 
And you need a high elevation to do that or 
else you just have a hole 
in the ground. 
They make them put 
topsoil back now, trees and all, to keep it from eroding. 
Otherwise you have a desert. 
They call Bamber , The Great 
Sahara. 
It's all mined out. 
Kids, Lucille said, use 
it as a 
dune buggy race track, and don't let the growth come back. 
Cliff 
said they shouldn't allow motorcycles in there. 
The pit on Lacey Road just north of Forked River covers 
about 200 acres. 
You can't see the damage from the road. 
Business lease out land, Cliff said, for 15 years in 5 year 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 20 
leases. 
There weren't many specifications years ago. 
Even when 
some topsoil and trees are put back, the motorcycles tear it up. 
(400) 
RE the Motorcycle Races -- On the weekends there are 
around 100 people racing in that one Lacey Road area. 
All 
the 
cyclists are "outsiders" who "come 
in from Trenton or somewhere," 
Cliff said. 
They leave all 
their garbage. 
Cliff thinks people 
should wake up and do something about this, 
i.e., the township 
and the Pinelands Commission. 
recreation 
Lucille said her sister lives 
in Bamber and motorcyclists 
park at an abandoned railroad stop across from her house. 
She 
caught a few of them using her lawn as a bathroom. 
They have no 
facilities. 
They leave garbage and cigarettes. 
"It's just a 
free weekend for nothing," Cliff said. 
Once or twice per year they have big rallies and you can't 
get across the road, Lucille said. 
The cyclists ruin all the roads because they create hills 
and valleys that are as much as four feet deep (or high), and 
loggers like Cliff can't get their trucks down the roads.

TXO1: This is a continuation of PFP83—RM0006. 
G—Forked River; 49GT (001) About the roads being ruined by 
motorcyclists. 
It creates a washboard effect. 
A four wheel 
drive can't drive on 
it after the motorcycles have been on 
it. 
The problem is that the township cannot tell the private 
owner what to do with his property. 
The particular guy Cliff was 
talking about 
was taking the township to court. 
He wants to get 
a Farmland Assessment on his property when he's not doing a thing 
with 
it. 
No firebreaks, no control burning, etc. 
If he gets it 
he does not pay taxes. 
Cliff has one for his 600 acre tree farm. 
The 
law says you have to make a certain amount of money off the 
parcel of 
land per year. 
You must also have firebreaks and 
control burn. 
If a fire comes and you don't have this 
protection, your land can be ruined in a matter of hours. 
land 
management 
(030) RE controlled burning. 
Lucille said it's about that 
time of year now when Cliff begins to control burn. 
Many factors 
must be coordinated for burning. 
The temperature must be 
low 
enough so the brush and not the trees will 
be burned. 
The wind 
direction must be correct (West is good for Cliff) and the 
velocity just right. 
You "don't get everything the way you want 
it, 
but you try and get it as near as you can before you do 
it." 
Cliff burns by himself (or with Steve, his son). 
Lucille 
may go out and watch 
it and 
if 
it gets out of hand she calls 
Cliff over. 
If 
it goes the wrong way you shovel sand on the 
fire. But,Cliff says, he has had situations where the fire got 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 22 
away and burnt 20 acres 
in 5 minutes. 
If you get a baffling wind 
you should not burn. 
Baffling means a wind coming from all 
directions. 
These are always back fires. 
Cliff never burns down wind, 
or else he would have no control. 
You have to burn against the 
wind, and the temp. should be between 30-45, not over 45 degrees. 
Cliff likes burning around 40 degrees. Humidity's a big factor, 
it cannot be too high. 
Cliff feels the average person does not 
know these factors. 
He learned from experience and by mistake. 
Experience is the best and hardest way to learn, Cliff thinks. 
Learning out of the book doesn't work. 
There's nothing like the 
real experience. Cliff has burnt up 50 acres of 
land trying new 
methods and learning. 
Cliff backfires every 5 years. 
Each area gets fired once 
in 
that span. 
Burning is 
all about preventing wild fires. 
(105) 
RE Wild Fires. They occur every twenty years or so. 
There was a fire that came down from Whitings; a train started 
it. 
Cliff went to Sunday school that morning; and when he got 
out he looked to the West and saw a little puff of smoke back 
there. 
And that afternoon the church burnt. 
It was 30 mile an 
hour wind and burned from Whitings to Forked River in one day, 
about 15 miles. 
It got wider as 
it went and was 2 miles wide by 
the time it got to Forked River. 
That was May 4, 
1930. 
It was 
the biggest fire Forked River ever had. 
The fire burnt one third of the town. 
It moved so fast that 
if 
you were in front of 
it, 
you couldn't move fast enough to get 
away from it. 
Every fire company between Newark and Hammonton 
was there, and saved a lot of houses. 
The volunteer cos. 
handle 
houses and the state handles the forest fires. 
All the cos. 
could do 
is save one house each. 
They wetted the roofs down. 
Cliff's family took their garden hose and wet their roof down. 
And they filled up every bucket and bathtub they had with water. 
(145) 
Elaine asked about precautions are taken for fire in 
town. 
Cliff said there 
is not a great problem any more because 
there are more roads (acting as firebreaks) and less woods than 
there were 
in the 30's. 
The 1930 fire would have crossed the 
Parkway even. 
Not much you can do with a fire like that. 
It 
burnt the freight cars on the railroad a block from their house. 
It burnt houses down all 
over town. 
You think 
it only happens in the West, Cliff said, but it 
happened here. 
The pine trees burn hotter than any other tree. 
There were a couple of fires this past summer. 
They kill every 
tree because the weather is dry and the sap 
is high. 
(180) 
RE Other Fires: 1937, west of the Tuckerton railroad, 
1962, that came from Presidential Lakes and didn't stop until 
it 
got to the bay. (April

Cliff recounted that he was working on a fire in Dover 
Forge. 
It was coming across the swamp easy and they were going 
to stop it. 
He was with a flash fire warden and Jim Branson from 
Bamber. 
When it hit the bank where they were it jumped up 
into 
the pine trees, and just seemed to tear the tops right out of 
them. 
They couldn't do anything with it. 
Cliff says it 
is just 
a matter of what has to burn. 
In the swamp there wasn't much and 
it was damp. 
But in pine-- lookout. 
Cedar burns if there's a wind. Without wind it won't burn 
due to the dampness. 
In 1930 
the fire hit a cedar swamp in 
Factory Branch. 
(25 acre swamp) 
It just seemed to explode. 
Flames were in the air 100 feet. 
You can't understand it unless 
you saw it. 
Someone told Cliff that, 
"I never seen anything like 
that in my life." 
And he 
lived up there, said Cliff. 
(This 
is 
an 
important statement, and not to be taken lightly. 
It is 
reserved for very few things, 
like the waves Cliff experienced in 
World War II 
in the Navy.) 
The fire killed every cedar tree. 
Cliff said again that he didn't think anyone could imagine it 
if 
he hadn't been there. 
And Cliff hadn't. 
(240) RE Cliff's experience in the Japanese Current that 
runs by the Aleutians.

The 
It was like going up and down a 
the other side. 
Lucille wanted Cliff to tell about sleeping in the powder 
room. 
He did this because it had to be kept at an even 
temperature. 
It was too hot in his bunk. 
A lot of people did 
this, or slept up on deck. 
(275) 
Back to family history. Cliff and Lucille were 
married in 
1945. 
Cliff got leave from Pacific tour, a 20 or 30 
day 
leave. 
Elaine said, "So you came, married her, and left her 
again, heh." 
Cliff said, "Yea, left her, left her standin' there 
talking to herself." 
There first son was born in Nov. 1946, 
Clifford Jr., called Butch. 
Steve was born in Aug., 1948. 
Roseanne was born 
in May, 1950. 
Kathy was born 
in May, 1953.

it got sold a

couple of more times and ended up 
in Manahawkin. 
"Evidently 
there couldn't have been no money 
in 
it," Cliff said. 
The shell of the house 
is the same as 
it was when it was a 
three stall garage. 
Elaine asked whether they designed it 
themselves. Cliff said the design was there, the outside shell. 
Cliff and Lucille decided where to put the rooms. 
Elaine wanted 
to know who made what decisions. 
Cliff said they planned it 
together and Lucille mmhmmed agreement. 
There's 
is a concrete floor underneath that is original. 
Cliff's uncle poured that. 
Cliff used to beg soda from him so he 
remembered that. Lucille said that when the children became more 
numerous they had to fix rooms downstairs. 
First, Cliff said, 
they fixed upstairs, and the first floor was still a garage, 
in 
which he built about 5 garveys. 
It was all 
one room. 
They built 
them in the winter. 
architecture 
They did everything but the kitchen cabinets. 
A fella up 
the street did them. 
His name is Trior. 
The trim around the 
doors 
is sassafras that Cliff cut in the woods and had 
it 
milled. 
Lucille said Cliff made the mistake of putting the worst 
piece around what is now the entry door into the kitchen. 
They 
never thought that last piece of trim would be the worst piece. 
They don't like because 
it has more knots than the others. 
Cliff 
said 
it works like mahogany and 
is excellent for trim. 
You have 
to season it for about a year. 
Lucille said the closets are all cedar. 
The washroom is all 
lined with cedar. 
They are never bothered by moths, Lucille 
said. 
"And it sort of resists bugs," Cliff said. 
On the wall 
in 
the living room is pine bought at a lumberyard. 
(I 
interjected a 
comment about Bill Lucas' walnut.) 
Cliff had heard of Bill Lucas because he 
is timber agent for 
5 counties, and knows he bids on timber land; but he has never 
met him. 
Cliff said he doesn't seem to do very much; he just 
works on his own projects. 
There's more walnut up near the farms 
around Pemberton. 
In Forked River only oak and pine grow 
natural, Cliff said. 
(plant) 
(415) 
Elaine noticed that all 
the woodwork is unpainted. 
Lucille said that it 
is just varnished. 
She likes 
it that way. 
It's easier to clean. 
If 
it was white you'd see every 
fingerprint, she said. 
She also puts a dull, not high gloss, 
varnish on 
it. 
Cliff paints the outside and Lucille paints 
inside. 
They said that works pretty good. 
Lucille did all 
the 
Sanitas (cloth) hanging on the walls in the kitchen.

is a continuation of PFP83—RM0006/007. 
G—Forked River; 49GT (001) Continuation of discussion of 
division of labor in the Frazee household. 
Lucille said she and 
Cliff made an unsaid agreement that Lucille would do most of the 
work inside and Cliff would do the work outside. 
And they still 
go by that. 
Lucille and Cliff laid the tile on the floor 
together. 
They had a partnership on that job. 
domestic work 
Lucille wanted to make sure we knew that Cliff made "youth 
beds" out of sassafras. 
They were the same size as the cribs 
but without the side walls. 
There were six or seven boards on 
the headboard. 
The footboard was the same way, 2 inch vertical 
pieces with a crossbar on the top. 
They still have one of the 
three Cliff made. 
The others are passed on to their kids' kids. 
wood processing 
Lucille made bureaus, out of plywood and pine. 
They were 
joined with dowels. 
She used a table saw and a Skill saw 
primarily. 
Cliff said Lucille made a lot of things. 
She made a 
gun cabinet for Cliff. 
The gun cabinet was made so Cliff could 
put his maps laying down 
in the cabinet. 
Cliff said you need 
systems to keep maps. 
Some need to be rolled and others need to 
lay flat. 
These are property maps, of his property; and aerial 
photos of the Pinelands. 
They show the regrowth of the cedar. 
One area, for example, was cut around the middle 30's. 
The map 
is 
1955 and shows the roads going through it and shows the cedar 
coming back. 
It's now 4-6 inches, maybe 8 inches at the most. 
It grows slowly, and you can only thin it so much because the 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 26 
trees need each other to survive. 
(080) 
The big issue for Cliff, that he's most interested 
in, 
is about the cedar regenerating. 
Cedar reminds Cliff of an 
oyster, very sensitive to everything. 
You need the right amount 
of moisture for it to come back. 
Everything has to be just right 
or 
it will come back 
in maple or gum. 
This happens to most cedar 
swamps that have been cut off. 
The forest doesn't come back due 
to 
lack of moisture. 
Cliff's theory is to plug up the stream by 
throwing brush 
in 
it. 
The water then flows throughout the flood 
plain to all 
the cedar. 
Cliff gives an example of a stream, Cedar Creek, whose water 
table 
is too low. 
Damming it up raises the table. 
And the water 
can flow through a 5-600 foot wide area. 
North Branch seems to be an 
ideal spot for reseeding. 
The 
trees near the stream crisscross and fall across the stream, 
when the water rots the roots. 
This blocks the stream. 
This is 
nature doing what Cliff sees as necessary. 
He thinks the water 
must be half way up on the cut stumps to allow for reseeding. 
Elevation on your water table 
is the whole thing. 
Water also 
prevents brush and other growth from coming back as strong. 
Cliff hopes that if nothing else happens out of this whole thing 
(folklife survey and interviews with him) he hopes, "I 
get 
through to somebody about this cedar regeneration." 
Cliff 
is not talking about damming up the stream completely, 
but spreading that water throughout the swamp. 
You need as much 
as a foot of water in the winter. 
Another thing, the state filled in about 50 acres of cedar 
swamp, down where the State Basin (Forked River Yacht Basin). 
They threw the fill around the basin they dug. 
Cedar is the best for boat lumber because it bends, unlike 
cypress or southern cedar which is brittle. 
The sneakbox needs 
bent wood. 
Pine is too heavy, and cedar is easy to work with 
too. 
Cliff and Steve service boatbuilders: 
Shin in West Creek, 
Sammy Hunt, and Joe Reed, and a lot of different boat builders. 
(220) 
Discussion of fiberglass to keep the wood dry on 
boats. 
Question about the state farming cedar. 
Should they? 
Cliff 
thinks they should in order to protect it, because it's getting 
scarce. 
And the state owns the biggest part of 
it. 
Right now 
the state doesn't do anything except let the cedar grow 
naturally. 
They occasionally have sales on cedar, especially if 
it burns. conservation 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 27 
(230) 
What other effects of the loss of cedar? 
Cliff said 
it 
is used for a lot of purposes: 
cedar closets, duck decoys, 
boats, etc. 
Lucille said the white 
is better than red for cedar 
chests because the smell stays longer. 
They did their closets 
about 25 years ago and can still smell 
it. 
(260) Discussion of 
wood furnace that Elaine liked the 
smell of. 
Cliff said you have to put wood 
in 
it every 3 or 4 
hours. 
Lucille said they had a system where they originally 
burned oil 
and heated with hot water, baseboard units. 
I t was 
quite old and they found this TARM system that has a double unit. 
They can burn wood or coal 
in one section. 
And 
if 
they go away 
they can switch on the section that runs by oil. 
They can use 
their old hot water system, and can switch the hot water over to 
be run by wood heat. 
It was expensive to begin with but has paid 
for itself. 
They burn 7 or 8 cords per year, and they've never 
been so warm. 
You can't use the wood when it's too warm. 
The wood won't 
hardly burn because the system automatically shuts off when the 
thermostat registers the desired temperature. 
(315) 
RE the woodpiles in the backyard. 
They are stacked 
between two trees. 
There are two stacks that form two sides of a 
triangle. 
The base of the triangle is open and inside the 
triangle is a pile of wood, thrown not stacked. 
They leave 
it 
there to season for a year, because burning green wood causes 
creosote 
Buildup of creosote means you've got to clean your 
chimney, and the creosote also coats your stove. 
They burn wood 
cut last year. 
Creosote is also a fire hazard. 
You have to have some system to 
it otherwise you take up too 
much room with the wood. 
That's why the neat stacks. 
It's also 
easier to get when they need 
it too. 
Cliff would recommend 
covering the top of the pile and letting the air blow threw the 
sides. 
A cover prevents the rain from going through it. 
You 
shouldn't keep it 
longer than a year because you're going to get 
a bug problem and a rot problem. 
In a shed or building you can 
keep 
it 
longer. 
(350) 
Question about fabric and color scheme in the house. 
Lucille picks all 
the colors and the fabrics for slip covers. 
Lucille made all the slip covers and curtains. 
Cliff 
is "not too 
fussy about that sort of thing." 
He's more concerned about other 
things, he said. 
Lucille said that he's easy to please. 
house 
( 
interior) 
I asked who does the cooking, and Lucille said, "You're 
kidding." 
There are certain things that Cliff does not like, 
e.g., noodles or spaghetti very often. 
Hot dogs or bologna too. 
Lucille does not like deer meat. 
They used to have chickens out 
there. 
Lucille said it was a necessity, they got eggs from them, 
and everything. 
They found out they were costing more to keep 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 28 
than to buy eggs at the store. 
Tears came down her eyes as 
Lucille plucked the feathers off her pets after Cliff killed 
them. 
The same way with the deer, 
if Lucille has to slice it up 
or cut it up she can't eat it. 
Fish don't bother her. 
foodways 
(animal) 
Cliff would bring the deer he shot home and Lucille used to 
skin them, and Cliff would throw a ham or half a deer carcass on 
the table and that was not too pleasing, I gathered. 
Cliff said 
he would mix 
it with pork to get the wild taste out of 
it. 
Then 
he would grind 
it up for hamburger. 
(390) 
Story about when Lucille went to Texas because her 
mother was sick, and Cliff had the kids here by himself. 
He 
didn't know how to feed them very well. 
He had a lot of this 
hamburger, so his son opened the refrigerator and saw all 
the 
meat in there and he slammed the refrigerator and said, "Reindeer 
again?" 
Cliff said, "You run out of 
ideas after awhile." 
Lucille 
said that was the only time he ever cooked for the kids. 
(400) 
Question about any special recipes Lucille might 
have. She mentioned a clam chowder recipe her mother taught her 
that 
is not the same as Cliff's grandmother's because she doesn't 
like his grandmother's recipe. 
Cliff's grandmother puts salt 
pork 
in 
it, and she grinds everything up rough. 
She would grind 
all 
the vegetables too, and Lucille likes them chopped nice. 
Other than the salt pork 
in 
it,the recipe was almost the same. 
It 
is a tomato chowder, and the vegetables are diced. 
They make the ground kind of chowder ingredients around 
here. 
Elaine asked if they had heard of something called "clam 
popeye." 
It's a clam stew with dumplings, Elaine said. 
Lucille 
said, "No, 
like I told you, I was born 
in the city, and most of 
the cooking I do 
is from that." 
Lucille said she does have a recipe for rice pudding that's 
an old family recipe. 
It's a restaurant recipe. 
Cliff said that 
Lucille's family is all 
in the restaurant business. 
The Ides 
Diner in Tom's River, that used to be there, was owned by 
Lucille's mother's family. 
They had restaurants in Asbury Park, 
Bradley Beach, and Tom's River. 
Lucille's uncle and aunt still 
have a restaurant in Rahway, N.J. 
He's a Greek.

TX01: G—Forked River; 49GT This is a continuation of PFP83—RM0008. 
(001) Cliff thinks the biggest thing the Pinelands 
(Commission) has to do 
is find a way to regenerate the cedar. 
About competition, question, should the state be 
involved 
in 
this? 
They could thin 
it out, he thinks. 
But if Cliff puts a 
road into his property, he'd have all 
his trees stolen almost 
immediately. 
You could thin out by cutting out all 
the stuff that is up 
to 3 inches in diameter, and use them for poles. 
Those trees are 
all 
going to die anyway, due to competition. 
That could, and 
should, be done, Cliff thinks. 
In his situation, Cliff thinks, 
he has to have a use for it, 
and build a road to get it out, so 
he doesn't do 
it. 
(Here business and woodcutting and tree farming 
intersect.) 
land management 
In many cases there 
is a swamp in which 75 per cent of the 
wood 
is cedar. 
The state should go 
in and cut the maple and gum 
out; 
those trees have no value. 
They take up 3 times as much 
room as a cedar tree, though. 
These trees don't necessarily have 
to be removed. 
The maple has no monetary value compared to the 
cedar, but Cliff does use 
it for crossways (corduroy roads). 
The 
trouble with maple and gum is they take up too much room up top. 
A maple that is one foot in diameter takes up 30 feet at the top. 
A cedar tree does not ordinarily take up more than 10 feet, 
if 
that. 
In the 20 acre cedar swamp that he owns, Cliff went in and 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 30 
cut all 
the maple and gum out, and he used 20 tanks of gas 
in his 
chain saw just cutting those trees down. 
And he never took a 
stick out. 
(This 
is because he 
is not ready to build a road 
in 
to the swamp. 
If he did, he would have to cut the cedar. 
If he 
didn't cut it, 
it would be stolen.) 
In fact some of the trees 
didn't even fall. 
Cutting the maple and gum makes room for more 
cedar to grow. 
And cedar is worth more money. (plant) 
TX02: G-Forked River; 49GT (055) 
Do they have a garden? 
Lucille 
said she 
is not a gardener. 
Cliff said they do not have room. 
Lucille said she has 6 rose bushes and a few lilac bushes, and 
that they did plant two Japanese trees. 
These are trees the 
Japanese worship. 
The name 
is something Royal. 
Lucille said 
it's the wood they use for their coffins. 
They got them at Cook 
College when they were on a tree farm tour. 
They sent for these 
trees. 
Lucille thought they would make nice shade trees. (They 
are about 1-2 feet high now.) 
They also used to have a persimmon 
tree, and 
it was about 75 years old. 
It just died recently. 
Cliff said that he has measured several thousand board feet of 
lumber (as part of his job) during the 
last couple of years, but 
he has never measured a persimmon tree. 
Their persimmon was 
about 16 inches 
in diameter. They left it there, and a rambling 
rose 
is growing around it now. 
Any kind of hard wood is used for palettes anymore Cliff 
said, even persimmon. 
(085) Discussion of palettes. 
Everything is moved on 
palettes nowadays. 
Repov (sp.?) 
cuts about 2 million board feet 
of 
lumber per year, and Cliff thinks about all of 
it goes for 
palettes. 
He makes palettes too, and furnishes others who make 
them too. 
(95) RE the long, arched cedar in the backyard. 
Lucille 
said people stop and ask what it 
is doing back there, 
it 
is so 
long. 
They don't understand that Cliff put it there for the kids 
to play on. 
Cliff said 
it grew on the edge of a stream. 
Each 
year it would fall 
into the stream and begin to grow again, and 
that's what made the curve. 
It grows like a rainbow. 
It's quite 
rare. 
The tree has to gradually grow into the stream. 
A tree 
that grows along the edge of a stream is 
no good for lumber 
anyhow because one side is hard and the other soft. 
The water 
side 
is hard. 
It 
is what "we call Brazil." 
You could get killed 
trying to saw it. 
You can tell that it 
is Brazil because it 
looks hard, at the stump.

She didn't like the way the dolls came out. 
They

most popular thing around; but Lucille says she 
like them. 
So she changed the pattern to suit

is a pretty doll."

Lucille begins with the yard goods and 
she buys the 
stuffing and the yarn, and goes from there. 
She fills the doll 
with an acrylic fiberfill. 
She gets the best stuffing she can 
find because the cheaper stuff leaves lumps. 
Lucille has sold 9 and has Christmas orders for 4 more. 
She 
gets $75 per doll. 
If not fully dressed she sells them for $40. 
Those would be put in a diaper. 
One recent change she will make 
is 
to put a bead on the ear to represent an earring. 
They are 
dressed like a southern belle, with pantaloons and sunbonnet. 
She also makes a baby doll version where the arms and 
legs move 
back and forth. 
They all 
"have the belly—buttons, the little 
behinds, elbows, and one of the ideas that I have; and I don't 
know of anybody else who does have it; 
is the fingers are 
separated." 
It took her a long time to figure out how to pattern 
fingers because when you stuff 
it, 
it stretches. 
She didn't want 
the fingers to become "gigantic claws." 
That was her biggest 
problem. 
Lucille could do one doll 
in 
15 hours, but doesn't, because 
she works on her housework also. 
And she tries to do more than 
one at a time because she finds assembly line work easier. 
She 
can paint many eyes at one time, for example. 
(220) 
[question about previous work of this sort. 
Lucille 
said most of her work "goes to quilts." 
And these are made for 
gifts. After an operation she had, she couldn't do anything else, 
O'Connor--$3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 32 
so she made each of her children a quilt for Christmas. 
Steve 
has 2 kingsize quilts and the others have 2 queen—size and one 
double size. 
Lucille doesn't like to crochet, but can. 
Most of 
her quilts are patchwork, and she has a favorite design, the 
double wedding ring. 
This year she 
is making Christmas tree skirts for all 
the 
children. 
She 
is going to quilt them also. 
She goes to the 
quilter's barn 
in Allentown, N.J. 
It has materials, and the 
Amish are connected with 
it. 
They will make a quilt for you 
if 
you bring the material. She got some of her ideas for her quilts 
from that store. 
Cliff said that they do everything by hand. 
arts and crafts 
(245) 
What is an average day like for you? 
(Lucille) 
Cliff said she sews half the night. Lucille said that she uses 
the machine during the day, but in the evening, after Cliff has 
gone to sleep, she sews. 
She has a table set up 
in front of her 
rocking chair. 
When Cliff goes out early, 
Lucille gets up about 
15 minutes before him. 
She makes his breakfast and his lunch, 
and then she cleans the house. 
Then she will start on the 
sewing. 
She's busy right now because of the orders. 
She'll make 
supper for Cliff and then sew some more. 
She stays up sewing 
until 
11 
or 12. 
"When you get to sewing you forget about the 
time...especially if I shut the television off."

This schedule is only this time of year when she sewing. 
Other times of year she has a "day like almost anybody else's 
day, you get up and do your housework, go out, or visiting, 
or.... 
She likes to visit her grandchildren. One day a week, "My 
husband allows me to play bingo." 
She plays bingo in Barnegat. 
In fact they even have bingo on tv now. 
And Lucille has won at 
i 
t. 
(275) 
Lucille has won $125 in the past month. 
Cliff 
objects to 
it. 
He doesn't like to see Lucille sitting. 
He 
thinks it's a waste of time. 
If she wins, Lucille gets to keep 
the money. 
"I certainly do get it," she said. 
Cliff said, "She 
doesn't give me a nickel." 
"It all goes back 
in the house one 
way or another," Lucille said. 
Cliff's aunt lives 
in Barnegat and she goes to play bingo 
with her, on Wed. nights. 
There are a lot of acquaintances, not 
really friends, there. 
Lucille said she 
is very lucky and almost always wins. 
She 
also goes to Atlantic City. 
Cliff doesn't. 
She goes on bus 
trips with church groups. 
They put one on once a month. 
She 
sews for a man who pays for her ticket. 
The last time she came 
back $160 richer. 
Lucille only plays blackjack. 
She said to 
stay away from the machines. 
Cards are your own decision. 
On 
the machines, they're all

haven't got a chance. 
She is very cautious. 
She has a set time.

Usually people meet about a half hour before time to 
leave 
and talk about their problems or their winnings and then go home. 
(330) 
Does Atlantic City affect life 
in Forked River. 
Cliff said no; that the effects really start showing 
in Tuckerton 
and from there south. 
Traffic on the Parkway is greater, but 
housing isn't effected this far north. 
(360) 
While Cliff and I went to 
look at their furnace, 
Elaine and Lucille talked about her dolls. 
One of them won 
second prize 
in a doll contest. 
Another won honorable mention 
because its arms and legs move. 
She takes special orders for 
what people want. 
She makes clothes of her own design for her 
favorite style dolls. 
She gave each of her granddaughters a doll 
this week. 
The dolls she doesn't like, the Cabbage Patch ones, 
sell for 100 to 1000 dollars depending on how they are dressed.

TXO1: G—New Gretna; 15GT 
(001) 
Pamela begins by talking about our educational 
system. 
Our parents were brought up to respect themselves and 
others more than the children of today are. 
This includes 
respect for wildlife and plants too. 
We've gotten a long way 
from basic values, knowing right from wrong. 
As a person you 
have value. 
She has been substitute teaching and sees kids with 
no self respect. 
Parents need to discipline kids 
at home first 
People need to be taught to respect their entire 
environment. 
Times have changed, no common courtesy and respect 
Somebody, the parents at least, are not doing their job. 
While Pamela was talking about this to me, Armand gradually 
withdrew from the conversation and began to show Tom some more 
decoys. 
He and Pamela had been showing us decoys for the first 
15 or 20 minutes of our visit. 
So returning to the conversation, with no respect soon we 
will not have 
anything left 
in this area (Tuckerton and Barnegat 
Bay). 
And this begins at an early age. 
Soon we will have a 
gigantic garbage dump. 
This respect is a matter of common sense, 
not fanatic environmentalism. 
Pamela's father taught her to respect the ocean (He was a 
sea captain.). 
He never told her to be afraid of 
it, 
but to 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 35 
respect it. 
(Meanwhile Armand is telling Tom about the fact that 
he adds feathers to ducks, whereas many carvers will not paint 
them on the decoys. 
There is a discussion of using patterns that 
I can't quite catch.) 
Her father went around the world four 
times. 
He was a convoy captain during the World War II, and his 
brother was shipwrecked off Ocracoke. 
Her Uncle Rod's ship was 
hit off the coast there, and he stayed on that island for quite 
awhile. 
The Waltons in Tuckerton have a shipwreck story 
in their 
family too. 
Both parents of someone Pamela knows were drowned in 
a shipwreck and their daughter stayed and grew up 
in Tuckerton. 
Joe Reid, 
in Waretown, also told Tom that his father was a sailor 
in Scotland and wrecked off of Seaside Heights. 
He stayed in 
N.J. and married a local girl, and Joe was born 
in 1311. 
Story about the lighthouse on Tucker's Island, and members 
of Pamela's family. 
They have a brant (decoy) made by one of the 
"lifesavers" on that island. 
Discussion of the brant, and of one 
of the mergansers hanging to the left of the fireplace. history 
(105) 
Armand had at one time 32 antique mergansers. 
They 
may be worth as much as $5000 apiece. 
Pamela brought in epaulets 
worn by a member of her family who were lifesavers as mentioned 
above. 
Three years ago they sold most of the mergansers to the 
Noyse Museum. 
Armand told Tom to get in touch with Gary Giberson 
over there. 
Gary 
is the carver there and works for Fred Noyse. 
Gary knows more than Fred about decoys. 
But Fred can tell 
you 
some fantastic stories, Pamela said. 
Fred lived 
in Lower Bank 
which 
is just below Green Bank where Armand was from, Armand 
said. 
(i.e., he's a Piney too) 
(132) 
RE the museum. The Carneys said that is Fred's 
tombstone. 
He and his wife Ethel were always interested in folk 
art. 
The museum originally was going to be nothing but decoys, 
and Gary was going to be the curator. 
But to have a museum, 
in 
order to satisfy the foundation, Fred, for tax exempt status, had 
to have a licensed curator. 
They had to bring in someone out of 
Philadelphia who turned out to be 
interested in modern art. 
So 
now the museum is one wing decoys and the rest modern art. 
She, 
the curator, brings artists 
in from Philadelphia. 
The building 
is modern, Tom said. 
It was designed by a Phila. architect, 
Pamela said. 
And she thinks it 
is modern, but not modern, and 
fits well 
into the landscape. 
It 
is built with all cedar, native 
material. 
It moves down a steep bank with the land. 
Fred himself is an abstract painter, but he did not want to 
include modern art. 
He wanted it to be all 
decoys. 
Gary hates 
the modern section too. 
He still gets to do his show every day. 
It's all factual, and he stretches it a little bit. 
Gary, 
Armand, and Pamela are all 
in agreement, Pamela says, that there 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 36 
should be a decoy museum in N.J. 
The only real decoy museum 
anywhere is 
in Salisbury, and Shelbourne too. 
Unfortunately there 
is no degree 
in decoy curating. 
Kenneth Basel was interested enough to 
learn about decoys, and 
the Salisbury museum as a result is super. 
Fred got overridden 
as far as this museum goes and Pamela thinks it 
is sad. 
Armand 
says it's sad because he has the biggest collection of decoys in 
the country. 
Fred Noyes and his wife started out by restoring the 
original 
inn at Smithville, and they ran 
it for several years. 
That was when Pamela was 10. 
They later added shops. 
And Ethel 
went around buying up old buildings, like the old blacksmith 
building in New Gretna. 
Again we have an example, Pamela said, 
of "progress." 
(210) Description continues of Fred and Ethel Noyee. 
Now 
developers have taken over. 
Now they're going to put up a senior 
citizens' center where all 
the old buildings are. 
"It's a sin," 
they both said. 
Those buildings were where the Noyse's made 
their money. 
When they had their antique shop, they had buyer's 
out on the road buying for them. 
They would ship Fred in boxes 
and boxes of decoys. 
15 years ago he had crates of decoys that 
had never been opened. 
He has birds from throughout the country. 
Fred showed Armand most of the birds and for Armand that was "hog 
heaven." 
Russell Holsted, the jeweler from Atlantic City who was 
murdered, used to be over every Sunday, and they would all 
get 
together and talk about and show each other decoys. 
A list of 
those who are really interested in decoys: 
Johnny and Mort 
and Armand, and Russell Spawn, young Mort, Harrison Huster 
(sp?) up north, and Bill, and Murray Mitterhoff, and Lew Johnson, 
and Mackey. 
These are the purists, the original collectors, 
Pamela said. It's not like it 
is today. 
Nothing turns them on 
like being able to 
look and touch those decoys. 
And Fred's boxes 
were exciting. 
Armand said that Fred took him into rooms filled 
with so many decoys, he was so excited, 
but you don't have time 
to take a bird and look at it. 
You're jumping from here to 
the re . 
(255) 
A description of decoys and their function. 
Armand 
said the amazing thing is that these birds were made to bring 
ducks to them. 
And they had crude tools and did a fantastic job. 
Tom talked about Herley Conklin's coot. 
Pamela said some of 
their mergansers were of this high quality carving. 
Pamela 
thinks the more refined birds are from the Barnegat Bay area. 
Armand said that Connecticut also had very fine birds. 
Personally he 
likes Maine birds "because it's a folk art piece 
then." 
It's very different. 
(300) 
RE the group of collectors of decoys. 
I said 
it 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 37 
sounds like there 
is a core group of about 10 collectors. 
Armand 
said there used to be, but now there are more 
in 
it. 
The person 
who got in 
at the ground floor got the prime decoys. 
Armand was 
fortunate. 
Today you pay through the nose for them, and have to 
get them from another collector. 
The days are gone of finding 
them in a barn. "That is the thrill." 
Owning them is fun, but 
Armand likes finding them at least at much 
it seems. 
(310) 
Story about the boat from Cape May. 
Armand talked to 
this man, whom he had known for a long time, about decoys, asking 
if 
he had any. 
The man said he had some wood ducks, and Armand 
knew they were very rare. 
Armand was fishing in a tournament in 
Beach Haven and the man came over and gave him a pair of 
mergansers. 
Today they're 10-15,000 dollar birds. 
About 4-5 years later he was 
fishing a tournament in Cape 
May and the same man came over to his boat and said said he had 
a couple of baskets of them under his house. 
Armand went over 
and crawled under the house with a flashlight. 
In the top of the 
basket were Masons in original paint and at least a couple of 
mergansers. 
The man said he wanted $5 dollars apiece. 
There 
were 22 birds, and he gave Armand all 
of them for $100. 
Armand 
was really excited about this find. 
When Armand got back, he and 
Pamela scrubbed them down all 
night. 
They ended up with 11 mergansers, which 
is almost an 
impossible find. 
Also a hen Shords 
in original paint, perfect 
condition. 
The word got out. 
They had stopped to talk to Gene 
Hendricks in Lower Bank on the way home. 
The next day people 
came over to the house, and there were phone calls. 
People 
wanted to buy or trade. 
He got them on Friday, and on Sunday a 
man came to the house and said he wanted a pair of mergansers. 
Armand had 6 by the same carver. 
The man gave Armand $100 and a 
Shords brant for the pair of mergansers. And some of his prints. 
What a deal. "That was when 
it was fun because you were wheeling 
and dealing, you know, and the adrenalin; you talk about flow, 
boy, you can just feel 
it; you get warm all 
over, you know, and 
excited. 
Just absolutely fun." 
The man was so honest during 
that deal that he told Armand and Pamela that he didn't even have 
toll 
to go home. 
They gave him back his money so he could go 
home. 
He still has his pair of mergansers. 
Mackey called about the mergansers. He was mad that Armand 
bought the birds in Cape May. 
He had been trying to get the 
birds from that man, perhaps for years, and the man didn't like 
him. 
Mackey thought they all 
belonged to him. 
The same thing happened again later. 
(400) 
Story about Mr. Mackey getting angry for the second 
time about missing some decoys that the Carneys got. 
They were 
in Ocracoke, N.C. 
Behind a house they passed was a whole pile 
of brant on top of a chicken brooder. 
They were root head brant.

This is a continuation of PFP83—RM0010. 
(001) 
Pamela is talking about the population increase 
in 
the summers. 
Stores, even the Acme 
in Tuckerton, raise their 
prices. 
Armand and Pamela told they were born out of their time. 
The topic is "outsiders," and how they have changed the life 
in 
this area, and forced Armand and Pamela to move (to a place where 
they, as Pamela says, will be outsiders also). 
Armand discusses where his brother lived. 
The property 
their father had was right on the Mullica River. Desirable spot, 
16 feet above the river. 
Armand and his brother each got half. 
They have both sold their pieces now. 
People are just running 
him out. 
And taxes. They say ("this Pine Barrens crap") 
they will 
give people x number of dollars in taxes. 
But what's going to 
happen ten years from now. 
The problem is someone is going to 
have to foot the bill for the land taken, 
i.e., taxes go up to 
compensate for the state paying less money than a private 
landholder would in taxes. 
An example: The Wharton Tract almost ran the people of 
G—Washington; 26GT Township. 
Their taxes went up when the state 
bought it. 
The same problem applies here (in New Gretna). 
There 
is no sewerage, street lights, water, sidewalks, no garbage pick— 
ups; and taxes are outrageous. 
The only thing you get for your 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 40 
taxes 
is a decent school. 
Only the wealthy will be able to 
live 
here soon. 
Taxes are higher here than in some places in north Jersey. 
And they have everything. 
There 
is not even a police force here. 
Volunteer fire companies and ambulance corps too. 
(055) 
Pamela says the problem did not begin now. 
You have 
to go back. It 
is true that now it 
is too late to right the 
balance of nature 
in this area. 
Around the 60's that Mystic 
Island came in (now a residential area). 
Everything comes back 
to greed 
in this case according to Pamela; one man owned most of 
the 
land that is now Mystic Island. 
You can usually trace where 
the greed comes 
in. 
Another example is Tuckerton Beach. 
That 
was owned by one family and was useless meadow land to them. 
A 
developer got an idea.... 
Several of those houses actually slid 
into the creek. 
They dredged the area but the land hadn't 
settled. 
Long Beach Island. Pamela said her grandfather tells about a 
family (she thinks the name was Crammer) that owned the entire 
island. 
(075) 
Armand talks about Newark or Jersey City. 
The state 
pours a lot of money into those towns, 
in tax money and relief 
money, and for what? 
Why couldn't they leave the land like 
it 
is 
here, and put a moratorium on building; but then give the 
municipalities the taxes they would normally get out of the 
property. 
Then the situation could be stabilized. 
Otherwise the 
poor people that live here are going to get run out. 
land 
management 
A friend of theirs has a 17 acre farm in Va., with two 
ponds, a house and three outbuildings. 
Her taxes are 91 dollars 
per year. 
Armand says he has 2 and 3/4 acres here same amount of 
buildings possibly and his taxes are 2000 dollars per year. 
He 
says he can't afford to stay here. 
If a community has 1000 acres and you take 500 away, you 
can't support the community unless you almost double the taxes. 
But Newark or Jersey City has a greater population, more votes; 
so where is the state going to spend the money? 
The whole thing 
turns back to politics, said Armand. 
If they had more votes and 
were Republican and wanted something from Kane, they could get 
it, Armand says. 
(114) 
I tried to summarize some of the issues discussed so 
far: 
development, taxes, the rape of the land, state ownership, 
and the resulting recreational problems with four—wheel drives 
and thing like that. 
Tom then said that he understood Armand to 
be saying that the price that the people of New Gretna are paying 
for the State protecting their environment, 
if that is what they 
are doing, 
is a loss of political power. 
Armand agreed. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 41 
Armand said that if the state wants this property, which 
apparently they have already (an interesting point), then start 
raising the taxes 
in Jersey City and Newark. 
Let them help pay 
some of the taxes that they are taking away from people here. 
If 
you make the individual taxpayer pay for the property, Armand 
feels the state wouldn't take over any more property because 
those people would not want to pay for a piece of woods in S. 
Jersey. 
But it might boomerang, Pamela said, and they would demand 
to use the land. 
But Armand pointed out that they get to use it 
now anyway. And our taxes have gone up, not theirs, Armand said. 
(130) 
Tom asked if they would consider relocating in N.J. 
if their was an unspoiled spot. 
Armand said no because N.J. 
is 
passed the point of no return. 
Too many people living 
in a small 
space. 
Tom points out that the same thing 
is happening in 
northern N.J. 
Pamela agrees. 
Armand said he can't blame people for wanting to get out of 
cities either. 
To him it would be 
like being put in a cage, or 
jail. 
Pamela said that this township, Bass River, has done the 
best of any she has heard of. 
They do have the one development 
from a while ago (Mystic Island), but now the zoning 
is one, two, 
and five acres. 
They just beat in court some people who wanted 
to build a houseboat development in the marina. 
Armand said this 
would have polluted the Bass R. which empties into the Mullica R. 
And then your bay 
is 
ruined. 
(160) 
People 
in this township have taken a stand saying 
they don't want "you" to 
live here, said Armand. 
But, he says, 
you have to help these people, with money, to survive. 
In 
another B years their taxes will 
be 3000 dollars probably. 
And 
they are young, Pamela says, and have the ability to 
increase 
their income; but why should they keep increasing their income 
just to pay the taxes? 
And what about the old people? 
They 
often have to sign their property (including houses) over to the 
county and/or the state. 
When they die, the property is 
lost to 
the state, both Armand and Pamela said. 
Does the state resell 
it? 
They don't know. 
The old people eat cat and dog food to survive often. 
They're too old to hunt and fish. 
Especially the widows. 
When 
it was a local group, everyone used to help, Pamela said. 
But 
now there 
is 
an 
influx of elderly people, and how many people can 
you take care of. 
Pamela is 
involved with the literacy volunteers program and 
trains tutors, and tutors, to bring people up to fifth grade 
reading level. 
People who have moved into the area can't afford 
to commute out of the area for work. 
Many are functionally 
illiterate (third grade reading level), and now they show up at 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 42 
the free clinics for medical assistance, etc. 
They need a lot of 
free services because there are not a lot of jobs here, and they 
can't afford to commute to work. 
The local people worked here, Pamela said. They did 
something that was needed locally, but noone made a lot of money. 
You didn't need a lot, Armand said. 
You wanted to 
live here. 
Everyone was more as 
less equal, economically. 
When Pamela graduated from Southern Regional, 
in 
its first 
graduating class, there were 81. 
In her daughter's graduating 
class, the last of the school's, there were 554. Twenty—two year 
span. 
Now there is a new high school just for this area 
(Tuckerton, Bass River, Eagleswood, and Little Egg Harbor), and 
they have 1200 students. 
And Southern still has about 2500 
students. 
Tuckerton H.S. 
in 
1957 had less than 300 students. 
And that ran from New Gretna to Manahawkan. 
The grade school, K-
6, 
in Little Egg Harbor has roughly 900 students. 
Tuckerton 
Elementary had as many 
in K-6 as Pam used to have 
in K-12 when 
she was a student. education 
Pamela's conclusion to this 
is that from Tom or my point of 
view, being from 
the Clifton area of N.J., this may seem like 
wilderness. 
This 
is not wilderness any more. 
It's mushroomed 
And Pamela and Armand have lived 
in Ft. Lauderdale, and N. 
Carolina, and other places along the Eastern seaboard. 
She's 
talking about a philosophy of 
life, she says. 
Armand said they 
have given a thought to going to Australia. 
Pamela said that if 
they end up being one of the people who helps build up Va. when 
they move she will feel guilty. 
But Armand said they both 
believe 
in buying a house that is already on the land. 
(250) 
Armand talks about their philosophy of not raping the 
land by building new structures on the land. 
And Pamela says 
they do not have children to put through school now and that 
helps lessen the burden on the school system. 
Pamela's brother, 
the mayor of Tuckerton, feels that he would like to screen every 
family that comes in, and put a limit on the number of kids you 
could have and live here. 
Now he and his wife are expecting 
their first child. 
He's trying, 
in the borough (3.8 square miles 
that used to be part of Little Egg Harbor Twnship), to hold taxes 
down 
(270) 
Armand says that the Chatsworth area is the hub of 
the whole Pine Barrens area. 
If those people will take you 
in, 
they are great people to talk to, 
he said. 
The old—timers that 
is. 
(280) 
Pamela sees no resolution to the problems here. 
If 
the state takes it over and preserves it, they will have to open 
some of 
it up to use. 
If they don't take it, who knows what will 
happen. 
Armand and Pamela have felt the cranberry growers are 
doing everyone a favor, environmentally and ecologically. 
They 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 43 
should get a break, and not just a farmer's exemption. 
Armand said that Haines, for example, owns thousands of 
acres that have been 
in his family for generations. 
He wants to 
keep it 
like 
it 
is, 
but they are pressuring him. 
Taxes. 
And if 
the smaller growers have to sell 
off, Pamela said, people accuse 
them of selling to a developer. 
Who made them the culprit, she 
asked? 
He has no other choice. Haines, of course, 
is 
in a 
different position. 
But he 
is going to have to ask himself why 
he should keep an extra 500 acres 
if the taxes keep going u 
(310) 
The whole thing 
is the tax structure, Armand said. 
If the state wants it, 
they should pay for it. 
Then the state 
would be 
less hungry. 
And don't listen to what you hear at the 
meetings, Pamela said, and Armand agreed. 
They tell 
you the 
first year they pay the full amount of taxes and this 
is prorated 
over a ten year period, but what it all 
comes down to 
is 10 cents 
an acre (v. 
10 dollars an acre privately owned). 
And 
if you 
don't know how it works, they snow people. 
Armand said they own an 
incredible amount of 
land, the 
state. 
And it 
is not preserved, it's open. "It's being tromped 
over, 
it's being shot over, 
it's being filthied up, 
it's ... 
trash and dirt." 
(The use of over comes from duck hunting, I 
think, interesting quote linguistically) 
(340) 
Armand said he does not know what the answer is. 
But 
then he said he does know, his theory. 
Leave it 
in private 
ownership; post the damn thing; keep people off of 
it, 
if you 
want to keep it 
like 
it 
is. 
You can not take a piece of property 
and have everyone tromping over it and keep it like it 
is. 
I mentioned talking to Cliff Frazee that morning. 
Armand 
said that twenty clammers worked 1000 acres. 
People came 
in and 
now you've got 20,000 clammers. 
And they keep saying "Gee, 
what's happened to the clams." 
People come down on weekends and 
are allowed to take 150 clams. 
On their bay, Armand said, 
in the 
summertime and boats are so thick that you can almost walk from 
one to the other. 
A thousand boats taking 150 clams each. 
So 
what happens to the clam? 
You're over—harvesting something that 
nature cannot reproduce fast enough for you. 
Pamela asked if Cliff is as pessimistic as they are. 
I said 
in some respects yes. 
He also, 
like they, has good ideas about 
how to regenerate cedar forests and what the state could do about 
that. 
Pamela said this whole area was at one time a gigantic 
cedar forest that ran right down the east coast. 
In N.J. 
it' 
gone. 
(382) 
Getting back to the state again. 
Armand said they 
have gigantic cedar swamps. What do they do, they sell 
it. 
They 
take that money and who gets it? 
Not us. 
And they don't replant 
it, Pamela said. 
She worked for the state on these pulp wood 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 44 
contracts. 
Armand asked, "Are they really fit to own all 
that 
land?" 
At this point Pamela said, "Why don't we talk decoys." As we 
wound down this section of the interview she also said the whole 
issue breaks her heart, especially the Wading River. 
The people 
owned it since 1875 and started a cranberry bog there. 
Up until 
they sold it...

15GT This 
is a continuation of the interview on 
(001) Continuation of discussion of the family who owned the 
cranberry bog on Wading River. He was a member of the borough 
council and the school board. His name is Hayes Parker, the son 
of Barton Parker who lived to be 96, and Hayes is Pamela's 
brother. 
He 
laughs and laughs because he loves pigeons. 
He 
scoots them off the church roof and takes them home and cooks 
them. 
When he was a kid they used to eat robins, Armand said. 
(He being Hayes) 
Pamela's grandmother used to make robin pies, 
and Armand loved them. 
People didn't kill just to kill. 
They ate what they killed, 
and still do, 
at least the old people, Pamela said. 
Hayes to 
this day eats anything. 
He doesn't shoot things anymore. He 
still goes out and catches mussels, clams, and oysters, fish, 
rabbits, and deer. 
Most city people just come in and do this for 
sport. 
foodways 
(22) 
There is actually a pressure that is driving them out 
of this area, both Armand and Pamela agreed, when I asked. 
This 
thing that we (Pinelands Project) are doing 
is not helping the 
cause a bit, Armand said. 
If you glorify something, people think 
that is the ideal spot and that is where I would like to be to 
get out of the rat race. 
And they bring the rat race with them. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 46 
Armand said they never had street lights. 
People come 
in 
from the cities and have to have street lights. They have to have 
garbage pickup. 
They have to have sewerage, sidewalks. 
They 
bring everything with them, and we don't want it. 
But you're 
outvoted. 
This whole thing about the Pine Barrens is just going 
to make 
it worse, Armand said. 
He would rather see the property stay 
in private hands and 
tax exempt. You could own 150, 200, 5000 acres, but you don't 
have to pay taxes. 
That way a person could post it to keep you 
off. 
All we're doing now is satisfying the people from the 
metropolitan areas with the Pine Barrens emphasis. 
(045) 
RE private ownership: I suggested that tree farmers 
would like Armand's idea. 
He said 
if the state owns it, 
it has 
to be open to the public. 
An example; Seven Bridges Rd. All 
the 
marshes down there belong to a man named Smith. 
He had a fish 
factory. 
He's a multimillionaire. 
The taxes were very low. 
Then the menhaden disappeared and he closed the factory down. 
The state got a hold of him. 
Five people oversee the land for 
the owner and can use the land; no one else. 
It's loaded with 
birds and ducks. 
It was almost a sanctuary. (Pamela pressed 
Armand to include the birds 
in the story) 
The state purchased 
the 
land from Smith. 
The Wetlands Act had said you can't build 
on that land. 
Smith was sitting on a lot of 
land he couldn't use. 
Right away 
it was opened to the public as a shooting ground. 
Now 
people are walking all 
over the marshes, and they dump their 
trash along the side of the roads, and they just ruined it. 
Armand's idea was Smith could have kept it and never had to 
pay taxes on 
it. 
And it's cheaper for the state than purchasing 
it with his tax dollars, which 
is ruining things. 
Pamela said this particular area was a major stopping place 
on the migration routes of the shore birds, better than 
Brigantine Refuge. 
Now the birdwatchers are putting pressure on 
the birds. 
There used to be 25 people who were very aware of 
this area, and they would go out in the spring and the fall. 
Also the monarch butterflies used it as a stopping place, still 
do. 
(animal) 
Birdwatchers now come in caravans, e.g., U. 
of Mass. 
Busloads of people come down there. 
Armand said there was just 
an article in the Atlantic City Press last Sunday about the 
Wading River canoers. 
They advertised the river so much, that 
you bump into each other as you canoe. 
It was clean; now it 
is 
full 
of beer bottles, cans, etc. 
So what is the Pinelands 
preserving? recreation, conservation, 
land management 
(100) 
What do you do about development when private owners 
become synonymous with developers? 
Armand said you could 
probably stop development. They passed a law on the Wetlands. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 47 
Why can't they pass a law on the core area of the Pinelands? 
When his tax dollars buy something, you want to be able to use 
it, Armand said. 
That's the problem. 
You are destroying 
somebody's habitat when you tromp through that land, though. 
They are ruining the land so much now they might as well 
preserve it correctly or come 
in and tear the whole thing down 
and say that's it. Armand said he was getting worked up and felt 
very strongly about these issues. 
(115) 
Armand and Pamela bought their property in 
1972. 
At 
that time you could count maybe 60 cars per day on Rte. 9 as they 
passed by their house. 
After 6 p.m. you could stand 
in 
the 
middle of the road for 5 minutes at a time without getting run 
over by a car. 
Now you can't even cross the street to your 
mailbox. 
They hope they can get their asking price for the house 
and move to a place that doesn't grow in population. 
Armand said they are not used to a lot of people. 
The 
casinos didn't help either. 
As people move in to this "quaint" 
area they forget that it's not the country any more. 
You're 
starting to build another city. 
The population of Green Bank, or rather the whole township, 
when Armand grew up there was about 400 (Washington Township). 
And you knew everyone. 
Regardless of how far away, e.g., twenty 
miles, a person lived, you knew them. 
The mail came into the 
same post office, the only store except for a small grocery 
store. 
You'd see everyone there. 
In the 40's when you heard a boat on the Mullica, you would 
run out to see who 
it was (power boats). 
Now on a Sunday in the 
summer you take your life 
in your hands to swim across the river. 
Across the river from Armand's house was a wild rice patch, which 
the ducks and birds loved. 
In the spring when the seed just 
starts to germinate, 
it just lays on top of the mud. 
The rice 
has disappeared due, Armand thinks, to the boats creating waves 
as the seeds try to germinate. 
Most puddle ducks, e.g., green 
winged teal, black ducks, mallards, blue wing teal, pintail, fed 
on this and other grains. 
And this began when the state bought 
the Wharton Tract. 
They put in 
launching ramps and advertised 
this beautiful place; and they ruined it. 
Every time the state of federal state gets their hands on 
something they ruin 
it. 
(200) 
Tom asked about the opposite problem with too many 
snow geese, and the open season on them this year. 
Armand said 
when he was a kid they didn't stop here. 
His stomping grounds 
were G—Green Bank; 26GT, G—Lower Bank; 26GT, and not Brigantine area 
where they were. 
Why the influx, he doesn't know. 
Perhaps their 
feeding grounds somewhere down the line have gotten out of whack, 
so they have chosen to stop here.

Tom asked if any pattern has remained the same since he was 
a kid, using the birds as an example. 
Armand said no. 
There 
were loads of deer, for example, when he was a kid. 
There was 
not much pressure on them. 
The Wharton Tract took a huge tract 
of Washington Townshp, and with that came a lot of hunters, and 
these four wheel drivers. 
He feels the four wheel drive vehicles 
should be outlawed. 
Tom said he was talking to Joe Reid, and that he and his 
wife used to go for a ride on a Sunday on those roads and there 
was traffic. 
There never used to be, Joe had said. 
If you want 
to keep the Pine Barrens the way they are, Armand said, you will 
have to ban the four wheelers. 
Let them walk through the forest.

(310) 
Why did people settle around here, 
in New Gretna? 
Armand said the people around here lived off the water. 
There 
were the Pineys and then there were the fishermen. 
They caught 
fish, clams, and oysters. 
Was there contact between the two groups? 
Did one get fish 
from the other, for example? 
Armand did not think so. 
The Piney 
could catch his own clams and fish, and the fisherman had no need 
for pine cones. 
They mostly went to cities, to florist shops. 
Tom said both groups seem to have contact with the outside 
world, but not with each other. 
Armand said, yes, the clams and 
fish were exported too, to Philadelphia, for example. 
Those days 
are gone, though. 
There are still a few people who collect 
sphagnum moss and pine cones, but the state will kill that too. 
They don't want you doing that on their land. 
And what happens 
when they lose that industry. 
There is nothing for that person 
to do. 
He has no education. 
The only thing he can do 
is take 
you all 
the way from here to Chatsworth through the woods, 
in a 
straight line, and never get lost. 
He's a woodsman. 
(350) 
Armand talks about hoping not to disillusion us about 
the Pine Barrens plan (I think he 
includes the Commission in 
these comments as well 
as our efforts), but that is the way he 
feels 
it 
is harmful to the area. 
Originally he wanted to go to 
Maine where he can be by himself. Now, on account of his 
daughter, they are going to the southwestern part of Virginia, 
which 
is still 
rural. 
Even though it hurts his business (bird 
and decoy carving) to not be exposed to people, after a while he 
gets tired of people. 
Herley Conklin had been telling Tom that he moved to Forked 
River to get away from the development in his home town 
in 
1944. 
Armand asked what do you think he feels like now. 
Pamela said 
Tuckerton and Barnegat were the hubs. 
Now Manahawkin has grown 
and Forked River too. 
Only 500 people lived 
in Manahawkin not 
too 
long ago. 
Armand said he's too young to stick 
it out the way 
Herley Conklin is now. 
Re Maine: 
it's so cold people don't want to go there except 
in the summer, Armand said.

We were not able to tape the beginning of this interview, so 
it will be necessary to refer to PFP83-FMO1112 in order to 
learn 
some of the family history of the Lees in Speedwell, and to get 
an 
idea of the flow of the interview from beginning to end. 
(001) 
Shifting from family history to business and Stephen 
III and his involvement in everything. 
Stephen III had just 
walked in. 
Abbot and his father had talked about their 
relationship as family members to the business, and I was 
interested in hearing Stephen III's story about growing up 
in the 
business. 
Stephen talks about this topic first. 
When he was 
in 
grammar school he decided he wanted to be an electrical engineer, 
and worked on projects related to this interest through high 
school. 
He went to Rutgers and studied electrical engineering 
and was 
in ROTC. 
His friends who graduated ahead of him were not 
doing engineering with a slide rule the way he wanted to, but 
were project managers. 
Stephen had a chance to do pilot 
training and finally passed the physical, i.e., the eye exam in 
particular. 
He trained as a pilot for a year in the Air Force 
in 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel

1967. 
He got married between the time he graduated and went to 
pilot training,

1967. 
occupations 
At that time they had increased the size of the packing 
house. 
He spent about six months around the farm that year, and 
the family built a lot of equipment to clean the cranberries 
before they go to the freezing plant. 
That was during the summer 
of 1967. 
The Air Force Academy opened up a program to give their 
students flight training before flight school, and they needed 40 
instructors. 
Stephen got a 2 year assignment doing that. 
It was 
a nice place to be. 
After that he taught flying jets for two 
more years 
in undergraduate pilot training in Lubbock, Texas. 
Stephen II 
interjected that his son's second child was born 
in 
the parking lot of the Air Force Academy. 
It's on the birth 
certificate. 
Stephen III told the story. 
He ran 
in and got the 
obstetrician in the hospital, but by the time they got back to 
the car it was all 
over. 
The first child was born 
in San Antonio 
in 
1968. 
Stephen III continued by saying his 5 years of active duty 
was up 
in 
1973. 
At that time he and his wife decided living 
in 6 
houses in 5 years was enough moving. 
He thought being on the 
farm was a good place to be and a nice thing to do, and a good 
way to raise a family. 
(080) 
Stephen III grew up 
in Mt. Holly until 
1949 when the 
family moved to Speedwell and built this house (Stephen II's 
house). 
Stephen III said his dad was not around much when he was 
a kid. 
He spent a lot of time 
in a truck while his father moved 
a tractor, wondering when he was going to come back, to the 
truck. 
It was a good place to grow up. 
Some cousins were the 
only people nearby. 
He spent a lot of time playing in ditches 
in 
the blueberry fields when he was really young, and then worked 
from the time when he was 8 or 9 years old. 
Stephen II 
said the boys always were ready to help, and you 
did not have to 
lay out stuff for them to do. 
Them taking an 
interest made it a lot easier here. 
At 8 or 9 the kids drove a tractor, worked 
in the packing 
house nailing up cedar blueberry flats, count tickets, pay off 
people. 
A lot more things had to be moved by hand, Stephen III 
said. 
They did a lot of blueberries in a wooden army barracks, 
and there were no forklifts like they have now. 
You had to be 
careful where you put the berries so you didn't have to move them 
more than a few times. 
(110) 
There were lots of things kids could work on when 
Stephen II's kids were growing up, 
he said. 
Processed berries 
were shipped in 20 pound cans. 
A child could move them as well 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 53 
as a grown-up. 
The child labor laws did not apply as 
long as 
it 
was your own children. 
It's harder to have his children participate that way now, 
Stephen III said. 
More people around and more machines. 
Liability is a problem if they drive a tractor and someone runs 
into them or vice versa. 
It's not a family affair as much 
Stephen II said. 
Stephen III said his son can't drive a tractor 
across the road when taking people out to pick their own 
blueberries. 
There are a lot of jobs that kids are capable of 
doing that they can't do. 
The kids are interested, it's just 
difficult to keep them stimulated with things to do. 
More 
difficult than 15-20 years ago. 
There seem to be people looking over your shoulder more, 
e.g., people from "wage an hour". 
They drop 
in and told him his 
daughter would have to stop sorting berries one day. 
They had to 
explain who she was, etc. 
(140) More legislation today that 20 years ago. 
A farm is 
more regulated than any business going, Stephen II said. 
It 
makes better reading. 
If a child died in a fire in one of their 
tenant houses it would make headlines everywhere; but there are 
reports of similar fire-related incidents that you hear in 
passing every day on the tv. 
They used to have 32 Puerto Ricans living here all summer in 
the barracks. 
They made good money at that time. 
You'd just ask 
the man how many trays he picked overtime and you took his word 
for it and gave him credit. 
This 
is 
in the 50's. 
They worked on 
their own. 
Now they have a guaranteed wage ($3.35/hr). 
The 
first year it wasn't bad. 
After that one fellow on one side of 
the bush would say the other was crazy for working hard. 
There 
is a guaranteed wage. 
That slows everything down. 
That 
eliminated the Puerto Rican program for the Lees. 
From 32 to 0. 
Now they have pick your own blueberries. Hispanic 
The guaranteed wage 
is not a federal 
law, but a state law. 
A blueberry field 
is 
like a forest. 
It's difficult to keep track 
of whose trays are whose. 
Pick you own programs are a nuisance 
but the berries get picked. 
Then they also have a machine that 
picks them the third time, after two pickings by hand. 
(135) 
The Lees still do run two buses out of Philadelphia 
as a labor force. 
It's called "day haul." 
One bus load is 
Cambodians and the next is Blacks. 
The Cambodian crew leader 
came by 
last year looking for work. 
One of the Black leaders was 
ready to retire. 
He was 
in his 70's. 
They got the Cambodian 
leader registered with the Dept of Labor and the State, and got 
him set up with a bus driver license and bus registration and 
insurance. 
It was amazing the amount of blueberries they picked 
this summer. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel

Social security numbers were 
erage wage per day was between 40 and 50 
for 8-9 hours of work. 
The number of

ore, Stephen III said. 
And they kept 
to pick. 
As a result they had the same 
aw 120 different Cambodians this summer. 
they saw 2100 different people. 
That 
ork. 
(240) 
Abbot enters the room now and we are all 
introduced. 
Mary asked how contacts are made with workers 
in Phila. 
Stephen 
III said there are pick up points. 
Basically they are friends 
that the 
leader knows. Many of them are from York, Pa. 
A lot of 
these people moved to Phila. just so they could come out and pick 
blueberries (Cambodians). 
These are people who have immigrated 
within the last 5-6 years. 
Very few speak English beyond the 
teen years. farm workers 
About Abbot growing up on the farm. 
Abbot was born on the 
farm. 
It's hard to distinguish when one stops playing on the 
farm and when one starts working. 
There's really no particular 
day or year. 
He always enjoyed the open spaces. 
Abbot went to 
Delaware Valley for college, his father said, and came home every 
weekend. 
When picking cranberries he would sometimes come home 4 
nights per week. 
During most of his time in grammar and high 
schools he would have a project of his own after school. 
This 
took up the time he might have spent on extra—curricular 
activities at school had he been athletically inclined. 
He 
wanted to work around the farm. 
When he was young, Abbot would have imaginary playmates and 
imaginary farms. 
He dug miniature bogs. 
His imaginary playmate 
moved to San Fransisco, though, his father said. 
His name was 
Googa. 
Throughout high school he did things on the farm. 
Abbot was always interested in building things. 
lot of snow plows. 
He also built a lot of bird 
martins and wrens. 
He built them for Christmas 
He built a 
houses, for 
gifts too. 
(345) 
Discussion of walnut used by Abbot. 
Black walnut is 
not planted around here, so 
it 
is not plentiful. 
I mentioned 
Bill Lucas and all 
his walnut. 
Abbot said his accuracy 
is better 
than any other sawyer in the area. 
And his old sawmill 
is not 
easy to adjust. 
He's not in 
any hurry; he goes at a nice easy 
speed. 
Abbot said he's not really there to be 
in business. (plant) 
(375) 
Mary asked if someone wanted to go into the cranberry 
business what would they have to do. 
Stephen II said that was 
his son Stephen's question. 
First he would have to acquire land. 
It's difficult now to get all 
the permits you need. 
You need 
water, so you need a stream encroachment permit. 
And you need 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 55 
engineering studies. 
If you are going to put in a dam, 
it has to 
be properly drawn and studied by an engineer. 
You would have 
more front end costs than anyone on their own could probably 
afford. 
The Lees are able to continue doing things they have 
been doing for a long time because many of their dams, for 
example, were there before the regulations. 
It would be 
extremely difficult for anyone to start out now. 
Most of the 
good ground is owned by the state now anyway, that is 
land that 
is not developed. 
agriculture 
You can't build a house until you have a farm. 
This 
is a 
problem "we" have with the Pinelands Commission's current 
posture. 
Something has to be done. 
There was an applicant in 
Tabernacle Townshp recently. 
He has 80 acres, but doesn't want to 
stick a farm out in the middle of nowhere. (Cont. on PFP83—

TX01: G—Speedwell; 27GT This is a continuation of PFP83—RM0014. 
(001) 
Abbot describes how to build a cranberry bog (that 
can't be built because of all 
the permits you need. 
The man 
discussed at the end of PFP83—RM0014 was not allowed to build his 
house because he did not have a farm. 
He couldn't protect his 
farm if 
he couldn't be there. 
He was caught in a double bind.) 
agriculture 
First you pick a spot near a stream. 
Then you survey the 
property 
as to elevations. 
You would locate your reservoir at 
the top part of the property. 
As a rule you need 5-6X the amount 
of ground in reservoir as you would ever intend to have planted. 
With the sprinkler systems now, of course, you don't need that 
much water. 
That was needed to flood the bogs for frost. 
Then you would plan where your bogs would be. 
You would 
probably ditch the area of your first bog to sulphate good 
drainage. 
You'll need large machinery to push the trees out. 
Cedar you would salvage to be cut into boards for later use; or 
pine you would use for building flood gates. 
Burn piles of 
vegetation that is not useful. 
This is more ecologically sound 
than hauling it away and piling it somewhere. 
Then you plow to 
invert the turf, so a lot of the root system where your cranberry 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 57 
roots would be would not be competing with other roots. 
Or you 
might begin to grade. 
There are many attitudes toward grading. 
The basic idea is 
to make the bog as 
level 
as you can; some people try to keep 
within a half inch of level. 
(Pause for coffee orders) 
The bog 
needs to be level for water conservation. 
This was especially 
important before sprinklers. 
Grading makes harvesting easier 
too 
After grading you go through and pick out any foreign growth 
or stumps. 
These will bud and give you stuff you don't want in 
your bog. 
Next you would put your underground irrigation in, 
i.e., pipes. 
Planting is next. 
You might use a common variety that other 
farmers have. 
They would probably give you the vines for free. 
This happens a lot. 
The Lees are doing this right now. 
Or you 
might want to raise a slightly more productive variety. These are 
quite rare often. 
You could spend up to $6,000. per ton for 
them. 
You can easily plant a ton of vines per acre. 
People 
in 
this area have been taking cuttings from mother plants and cut 
them in pieces 4 and 1/2 inches long. 
These are rooted 
in 
individual pots or 
in a hot bed, one or two inches apart. 
You 
would plant them out at at least a foot square. 
40-60-70,000 
plants per acre. technology 
When they are 
in the hotbed you can push the plants with 
different types of ferti I 
izers. 
If you do this 
in the bog, you 
encourage a lot of grass, and that is a problem if the cranberry 
does not get out in front and establish dominance. 
If they do 
not you have to get expensive herbicides and rotivate again and 
often replant. 
(120) 
Question about time of year cuttings are taken. 
Abbot said all year 
if you have a greenhouse. 
And you can take 
cuttings from cuttings. 
They are put back 
in the bog 
in spring 
or fall. 
Or you can do this propagation outside in the 
summertime. 
Hotbed 
in this area is a box with a medium of sand 
and peat moss mixture, half and half. 
This is the same for 
blueberries. 
This 
is done in a greenhouse in the winter. 
From the point you begin physical work on the bog 
it could 
be 3 years for a small ten acre project, until 
it 
is time to 
plant the vines. 
If you got a crop 
in another three years, that 
would be excellent. 
It wouldn't be unusual to take six years 
after planting. 
So 
it's a minimum of 5 years, up to 9 years to 
get a crop. 
That's another reason people might be discouraged 
from starting. 
(160) 
Stephen II begins to talk about their own experience 
starting new bogs. 
He said you usually get a heavy rot the first 
couple of years. 
They started spraying as soon as they were 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 58 
planted to cut down that problem. 
The fungus is 
in the ground 
from the time you start. 
Boris brought up the point that, 
like Bill Lucas, the Lees 
are patient and not in a hurry; and that this 
is 
important to 
good work and success. 
Abbot agreed and said you can level a bog 
and come back a year later and find it has settled in many 
places. 
It may take two more tries to get it perfect. 
Another thing, Stephen II mentioned, 
is the importance of 
self-discipline when you are self employed. 
You might not feel 
like getting up, but you have to. 
You have to push yourself and 
be your own boss. 
Most people don't realize that the farmer's 
time has any value at all. They'll ask him to do things, e.g., 
can you do something for me because your time looks free to them. 
It's a funny feeling. 
People think you can come along to a 
farmer and talk for two hours, and 
it hasn't cost him anything. 
Abbot said they are more tied down than a person 
in 
industry. 
There is no such thing as a personal day, or deciding 
to take off next Tuesday. 
Many times of the year you can't 
consider taking a day off. 
During the frost season you don't 
plan to do anything 
in the evening. 
You have to watch the 
thermometer. This is a seasonal rather than a daily issue. 
Stephen II 
said they all have calendars and one 
in the 
office. 
His sons give time to many things. Stephen III 
is a 
member of the Pinelands Commission, member of the Burlington 
County Planning Board, president of the school board in 
Tabernacle_, and flies the Air National Guard tanker planes (about 
one flight per week). 
How do you get away? 
Stephen II said he 
just doesn't do a lot of them in the summertime. 
He flies more 
in the winter. 
It's getting harder all 
the time to do that. But 
he only has three years to go. 
(210) 
A shift in the conversation when Mary asked 
if other 
cranberry growers around the country help each other solve 
problems. 
Or are the problems in N.J. different than those 
in 
other areas of the country? 
Yes, to the former, Abbot replied. 
Many of the things they do 
in Wisconsin wouldn't work for 
cranberry culture here, e.g., the type of gate they use, 
aluminum. 
Their bogs freeze right solid 
in the winter. 
An 
aluminum gate would dissolve in this soil of N.J. 
Low ph here. 
A piece of pine that wouldn't last 5 years above ground will 
last 
150-200 years 
in the water, Stephen II 
said. Lack of oxygen makes 
this happen. 
Where the gate parts have to be part in and part 
out of the water, or have to be pulled from the water at times, 
you use creosoted lumber; and replace them every 20 years. 
Cement is cheaper. 
Cedar is soft the water would wear it out, 
Stephen II 
said, but I'm not sure Abbot agreed. 
Insect problems are different from state to state, Abbot 
said. 
But if one state has a label 
on an insecticide, 
it's 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 59 
easier for the growers 
in N.J. to get a label 
on that product. 
The Ocean Spray Cooperative has a person who does nothing but 
help farmers get technological answers to cranberry culture 
problems. 
(250) 
RE Ocean Spray: 
It 
is a 100% cooperative owned by the 
farmers. 
Abbot mentioned some others: Sunkist, Land—o—Lakes, 
Lehigh Valley. 
Farm Credit Union is similar also. 
700 growers 
nationwide belong to Ocean Spray. 
There are about 50 cranberry 
growing entities in N.J., and 35 of them belong to 
Ocean Spray. 
That works out to be about 80% of the crop, both 
in N.J. and 
nationally. 
Ocean Spray 
is exempt from Monopoly regulations due 
to the Kapa—Volsted Act. 
That says that agriculture has the 
right to market their crops together. 
Growers who are not part of Ocean Spray derive the benefits 
of Ocean Spray advertising. 
This includes the development of new 
products. 
The growers to belong to the cooperative must own stock 
in 
the company in proportion to the amount of berries they deliver. 
There 
is a plant and the management if 
by a board of directors, 
farmers only, growers only. 
N.J. has 3 members on the board now. 
The board hires professional management people. 
RE labels: a person would run residue samples from the 
research center here (Rutgers) and have the analysis done. That 
material would be furnished to the Department of Environmental 
Protection. 
This 
is not lobbying, but going through the 
mechanics of getting labels. 
For years, for example, Monsanto had a herbicide that worked 
great for cotton and soybeans; but the cranberry industry was too 
small for them to be 
interested in getting a label for their use. 
So finally the growers hired a person to get "roundup" labelled, 
and 
in two years DEP was satisfied that it wouldn't be harmful. 
As a coop you can do these things. 
Corn growers don't need this 
because they're bigger. 
Coops are not natural for farmers to get involved in, 
Stephen III said. 
They have to be 
in a situation where they 
really need what a coop can offer before they will organize. 
This was true when Ocean Spray got organized about 50 years ago. 
The farmers couldn't handle their processed berries, and that was 
why 
it was formed. 
(345) 
Question about how people are convinced that 
cranberries are good for them, given it 
is such a small 
industry, 
with an 
isolated product. 
Stephen II said the coop does that. 
They have developed a market. The growers job 
is 
to sell and that 
is a different job. 
Stephen II said they didn't do a very good 
job; they should have offered us cranberry juice instead of tea 
and coffee. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 60 
On the other hand, Stephen III said, they are blueberry 
growers and sellers too, but they aren't involved in marketing 
blueberries even indirectly. 
All 
the growers harvest them and go 
out on the same corner and holler, "Blueberries for sale." 
Stephen II said there are only about 7 or 8 buyers for food 
products in the whole U.S. 
And think of all 
the producers. 
The 
guy from A&P or SuperFresh or somewhere, they're all 
pals. 
They 
call 
up True-Blue Coop ( to which the Lees belong) and say they 
can buy blueberries for x dollars today per flat. 
They say the 
coop 
in Hammonton is going to sell for that, so you have to give 
them to him for that. 
Abbot said that for over a week last summer chains would 
keep the prices of blueberries so high ($1.49-$1.69 per pint). 
The demand went way down. 
At the same time they were only paying 
about $.69 per pint. 
They got them so cheap because of the price 
they created in the market. 
So this looks like a great 
opportunity to run a sale perhaps. 
And one of the chains will 
ultimately break and do that. 
But towards the end of the summer 
this dragged on for more than a week during picking season. 
And 
the fruit in the store would have been sitting for quite a few 
days. 
Stephen II said big chains don't buy top quality. 
Why don't 
people come out and pick them then? 
Too far and gas money and 
time, and they don't want to get their hands dirty. 
(400) 
Boris asked two questions: 
what proportion of 
the 
Lee business is 
in cranberries as opposed to blueberries; and why 
is this part of N.J. a good place to grow cranberries. 
Stephen II 
said the answer to the former is that they are 
about even 
in the number of acres.

is a continuation of PFP83—RM0015. 
(001) In response to Boris' second question, Stephen II said 
that having the streams available made all 
the difference. 
The 
soil 
is the same as that used to grow blueberries. agriculture 
(005) 
I tried to summarize some of the pressures I sensed 
that pointed to 
less and less flexibility for the cranberry and 
blueberry grower, e.g., regulations, a difficult blueberry 
market, etc. 
Stephen III said there are fewer things under your 
own control, so the margins are subject to others' desires 
concerning how the market is shaped. 
How come so many acres 
in blueberries? 
During the last 
couple of years they have made money on both products. 
Labor 
wise 
it works well. 
Stephen II said they just took 12 men from 
Puerto Rico to the airport. 
They came 
in around Labor Day and 
pruned all 
their blueberries, and then they had a stable force 
ready to go during the cranberry harvest (end of Sept. to mid— 
October). 
(025) 
Shift in the conversation with Mary's question about 
using bees. 
For every acre of blueberries they have a hive of 
bees. 
After the blueberries they are taken out at least three 
miles away, and then brought back again for the cranberry crop. 
They hire a guy from Hardingville to run the bee operation and 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 62 
supply the bees. 
His name is Everett Wright. 
He sells blueberry 
honey. 
There are too many things in bloom to get cranberry honey 
per se. 
The cranberry doesn't produce much pollen. 
It's a small 
f 
lower. 
The bees lost weight, ironically, during the best harvest of 
blueberries this year, Stephen II said. 
If they're losing weight 
they stay 
in the hive more, and so you have to be interested 
in 
the bees because you want your blueberries pollinated. 
Some people hire a cheap hive, Stephen II said. 
Their hives 
cost $25 per hive to rent. 
Then they buy the honey back. 
They 
sold 4 or 5 tons of honey this year. 
Wright is also a repacker of honey, Abbot said. 
He buys a 
lot of honey out of Florida, where a lot 
is produced. 
There is a fellow in Mt. Holly, Mary said. 
Stephen II said 
his name was Bradley, and he 
is dead. 
Stephen III's in—laws 
bought his business. 
A beekeeper that doesn't know what he's doing 
is a real 
comedy, Abbot said. 
It can be sad. 
His father kept with a 
person who bought the business that a guy he used to use owned. 
He backed into his own hives. 
His dog got stung to death one 
day. 
He would move a hive in the middle of the day. 
The worker 
bees are out working then. 
(070) 
Boris asked Stephen about his in—laws living around 
here and have a bee business. 
His wife's uncle bought that 
business. 
He sold it, 
after doing it as a hobby. 
Bradley's 
hives were diseased. 
His in—laws live right behind Bill Lucas's 
sawmill 
in Birmingham as that area 
is known. 
Abbot's in—laws come from Slatington, Pa., which is 30 miles 
north of Allentown, Pa. 
They go back several generations in that 
area. 
TX02: G—Speedwell; 27GT (090) 
Discussion of why the Pine Barrens 
don't have good looking trees , Stephen II 
initiated. 
This 
is 
stuff that the Pinelands Commission has ignored, Abbot said. 
This area was an iron furnace at one time. 
There were 9 iron 
furnaces in the state. 
They burned a tremendous number of cords 
of wood per day. 
Any time he cleared an acre of ground or more, 
Stephen II said he would plow up a charcoal ring. 
Every pine 
from Lakewood south was cut off at one time. 
To make charcoal 
you scalp the ground and pile logs on top of the ground to allow 
the wood to smolder. 
Then through erosion we get scrubby trees. 
If you out off oak, pine comes back. 
If you cut off pine, 
oak comes back. 
Trees weren't put back until Roosevelt brought 
in the CCC. 
In the state forest as you get off 563 onto 72, on 
the right near the firetower there are some nice trees growing. 
There are enormous, beautiful trees. 
They never planned tree

arms . 
There was a forester, Tiny Crammer, years ago. 
He wanted to 
leave the good looking trees, burn the ground down to the mineral 
soil, seed trees, and cut the rest of 
it off for pulp wood. 
When 
they would go to burn, the other branch of the Forest Service 
would be down there seeing if they had a permit, etc. 
They did 
not want to burn. 
The ecologists were saying to 
leave everything 
the way 
it 
is. 
Now they have finally come around to his way of 
thinking. 
conservation 
I hear the same thing from many people: 
Silas Little, Cliff 
Frazee for example. 
There could be terrific forests of beautiful 
trees here. 
They are faster growing than Me., Stephen II 
said. 
What hampers this kind of growth? 
Stephen II said that the state 
had controlled burning and then did away with it. 
There was a 
commissioner of environmental protection whose name was Sullivan 
then, and Stephen II met him at a hearing at Rutgers in early 
1970's. 
He asked Sullivan to come down to the Pines and see for 
himself what controlled burning is all 
about. 
This was after 
Earth Day and the legislation for no more smoke. 
They sat with 6 
or 7 people and talked, showed pictures of wild fire and 
controlled burning. 
And the thing went through. 
They thanked 
him for his help. 
(170) 
Stephen II's experience with Brendan Byrne and the 
Pinelands Reserve. 
He asked him to talk to people in the Pines. 
Not just them, but with lots of different people. 
He explained 
his experience with Sullivan. 
He never had time, quote unquote. 
If he had come they probably wouldn't have been sold the bill of 
goods they were sold on "this Pinelands Commission," Stephen II 
said. 
The Dept. of Agriculture he argued with, and the man said, 
"Let them put any thing they want in the bill 
and we'll 
compromise it 
later." 
"And we were sold down the river." 
Everybody's losing. 
Nobody gained. 
Stephen II 
said they have been conservationists for years, 
but today you can't plant a white pine tree or a Norway pine 
because it's not a native tree. 
In Wisconsin now they were 
taking out white pine and putting in Norway pines (from Norway, 
Maine). 
They are faster growing and made of better pulp. 
Abbot said the decisions concerning the environment today 
are made in the courtrooms and not in the laboratory. 
If you got 
sick, and you are a living organism, you would go to a doctor not 
to a lawyer, not to a judge. 
It's that simple. 
Scientists might 
be hired to come in and 
lie one way or the other for whoever's 
point of view you want to get over, but decisions are being made 
in the courtrooms and the legislatures, and 
in the media. 
And who 
is going to suffer, Abbot asked. 
The environment 
first and then society because the environment suffered. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 64 
(200) 
I said the "living organism" idea seems to be very 
important. 
Do you think people who do not experience living and 
working with the ►and in the Pines don't see the tree as alive? 
This keeps coming up. 
Stephen II said to just look at their 
ballot this year. 
Recreation, recreation, recreation. 
Bond 
issue to save open spaces. 
All chiefs and no 
indians. 
And 
if 
you could see the special place we've made for people to put 
their canoes in, so they could get them off the highway, which 
was a hazard, you can see the cases of empty beer cans and 
bottles. 
There are no facilities to relieve yourself anywhere on 
the river. 
And you're putting thousands of people 
in the river 
every weekend. 
You used to have pond lilies and pike, but 
they're not there anymore. 
People raise hell 
on the way down the 
river. 
This 
is not recreation to Stephen II. 
It 
is not 
controlled. 
Most of these people are one shotters. 
They don't 
even care what they do to the canoe. 
Yet this is the recreation 
that we are all 
so built up on. 
The "blueprint commission" that 
Stephen II was on, 
he said, before they had even worked things 
out were talking about how they were going to bus people down 
from Newark to the recreational areas. 
Recreation is needed but should be supervised and spread 
out, Abbot and his father said. 
(240) 
Mary mentions the Algonquin National Forest in 
Canada. 
You have to get a reservation, and they let only so many 
people in at one time. 
Stephen II and Abbot said they should 
have trash cans, toilets, and a bottle bill. 
Abbot said they 
probably will have that soon. 
I asked Stephen III his opinion about these issues, but he 
did not want to talk about it because he feels right in 
the 
middle of 
it, 
being on the Commission. 
He feels changes must be 
made, and he 
is working on other commissioners to get them to see 
their way of thinking. 
There aren't many people on the 
Commission that have their roots in the area, that he thought I 
was beginning to talk about before. 
Many of them are content to 
see the area stay just the way 
it 
is because it 
looks nice when 
you 
look down here from north Jersey. 
They're sorry about the 
poor folks who invested 
in 10 acres and thought they were going 
to sell four homes, and that is where they were going to retire. 
He thinks we have to do something about those people, and those 
people who have been here for a few hundred years. 
What the 
solution is he 
is not sure yet, but it has to be done 
in the next 
year or two. 
(265) 
What do you think the best role for governmental 
agencies would be? 
Stephen II said that it goes back to what 
Abbot said about going to courtrooms instead of 
laboratories. 
The Pinelands Commission made the mistake of not using any 
local 
people for information. 
This 
is what he was trying to sell 
Byrne. 
The consulting firm hired was from Chicago. 
They didn't 
need that. 
Everyone here 
is 
interested in conservation and have 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 65 
been doing it for years. 
They wrote as much junk (the firm) as 
they could, and the more you write, the easier it 
is 
to 
compromise. 
They told you they wanted to continue farming. 
They 
also said you couldn't cut a white cedar down. 
What does that 
mean for cranberry bog cultivation? 
land management 
They sand cranberry bogs every 5-10 years to get a new 
growth. 
They said there would be no more mining here after a 
certain length of time. 
They contradict themselves all 
the way 
through. 
Stephen II went to Okracoke to see 
it. 
He had been 
there during the war. 
He was talking to a girl from Nebraska who 
said she had a brother up 
in N.J. saving the Pinelands. 
Not that 
that person doesn't know his job, but Nebraska and here are two 
different places. 
Every locality has its own bailiwick, that you 
have to 
learn. 
And you must learn from experience, you don't 
learn from a book. 
You don't learn by any college, or anywhere. 
The kids have picked up more knowledge about cranberry and 
blueberry farming than they could ever get from a book on 
horticulture. 
He's not downing education, but Stephen could not 
fly that plane until he got behind the wheel. 
It's the same down 
here. 
Abbot said that there are some qualified people here. 
There 
are academics, e.g., geologists who have grown up 
in the area. 
He mentioned Bud Wilson. 
He has spent his life studying the 
Pines and 
its ecosystem. 
He lives 
in Green Bank before the 
bridge over the river going into Green 
Bank. 
But all 
this 
knowledge does not go anywhere, Stephen II said. 
(330) 
One of the problems (as 
in the discussion with the 
Carneys) 
is 
lack of voting power here, Stephen II 
said. 
Bayer 
(sp?) a senator from north Jersey is the one who writes the 
legislation on migrant labor. 
He just gets the farmer in 
trouble. 
Stephen II's wife, now deceased, was from Maine. 
She was 
born 
in Presque Isle. 
(We had ended that part of the discussion, 
and Stephen II asked me where I lived 
in Maine. 
Interesting 
switch) 
She was a daughter of a dentist, and her mother died 
when she was about 12. 
Her father had a stroke and couldn't 
practice anymore and they lived in Lewiston. 
She had an only 
sister who was a radiologist who came to Burlington County 
Hospital. 
One summer she came to visit her sister during the 
summer, and Stephen II met her there. 
She came down here with 
Stephen II, and they used to put Stephen III 
in the bath tub when 
they were building this house. 
He was born in 1946, and they 
built the house 
in 
1948-49. 
They had an old stove with a pipe 
sticking through the window. 
Stephen II went to different cranberry growers, one of whom 
was the director of a bank. 
He told Stephen II 
that there was a 
lot of money 
in cranberries and he 
liked 
it a lot. 
But he 
wouldn't lend him money, and he changed his tune. 
There wasn't 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 66 
one person that said you are doing the right thing. 
Not one, 
from the county agriculture agent right down the 
line. 
Except 
his wife was interested in coming down here and taking a chance 
with him. 
That is something. 
She was working even when she died 
of a heart attack when she was 61. 
They had been to the wedding 
of a nephew (There was a picture on the table of them walking 
across the street to the Church I think.). 
She died on the way 
home from the wedding. 
Her name was Marjorie Esther Abbot. 
Her sister still 
lives 
in Boothbay Harbor. 
Stephen II's 
brother-in-law was the oldest teaching principle in age 
in Old 
Town, Me. when he retired. 
He was a principle of a high school. 
Stephen III said that while flying over Me. at night there 
are no lights in the western part of Maine, but you can see where 
the Canadian border is because it's built up with farms, people, 
and lights. 
It's a perfect map of the border. 
That's southern 
Canada but northern U.S. 
None of our people want to 
live there, 
but they think it's a great place to live. 
Boris said he went through a hundred miles of nothing but 
woods from the eastern tip of Maine to Bangor. 
Just nothing. 
But that is changing fast, Stephen II 
said. 
He has a brother-in-
law 
in Gorham, Me. who 
is 
in the legislature. 
He was a 
Republican, and he never had any competition. 
Now the farming 
class is not in the legislature, and the attorney class 
is coming 
in. 
All 
the people who have moved there, and they want to change 
things. 
They move there to get away, and then they want to 
change it to be 
like where they moved from, Stephen III said. 
This 
is what happened here, Stephen II 
said. 
One of the 
biggest fighters on this Pinelands thing was a person that moved 
here from out of Kensington. 
He came 
in and sold real estate.

is a continuation of PFP83—RM0016. 
(001) 
Discussion of the fact that three townships come 
together on the property where Stephen II and his sons' families 
have their homes. 
When the two sons went to grade school, they 
went to Chatsworth to the nearest school, but the wrong township 
(Woodland). 
Stephen III to have gone to Tabernacle, the 
appropriate school 
legally, would have to have left before 6 am 
and return after 4 pm. 
It's the same way with garbage 
collection. 
A garbage tank comes up from Washington and one from 
Tabernacle. 
He collects from two houses and the business 
buildings. 
They pay so much per month for a dumpster. 
The other 
truck comes from 12 miles away to collect from three other houses 
(within a couple of hundred yards of each other, and are the only 
houses around). 
Tabernacle has the best school district around. 
That is the 
one that Stephen III 
is a member of the board of. 
It was the 
cheapest school district in N.J. 
They were spending $535. per 
pupil and were sited 
in the Thorough and Efficient Education 
report of N.J. as an example of what a poor education a child 
must get for that amount of money. 
But the students do very well 
on state tests. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 68 
The principal at the school 
in Chatsworth when the boys went 
to school taught 7th and 8th grades and had 28 students. 
Then 
Trenton comes down and says they couldn't do this. 
So the 
principal gets a secretary, and had to stop teaching, I think. 
And there are no more children. Less, Abbot said. 
They brought 
music and art teachers in, which Stephen II thought was a good 
idea. 
They would come one day per week, but now they are there 
all 
the time. 
Now Chatsworth has one of the highest rates per 
pupil, but it 
is not there fault. 
If they don't meet 
requirements, the Bureau of Education will cut their money off. 
Stephen II continues, Tabernacle did not used to have any 
people on relief. 
They all moved into Chatsworth because the 
state said the town had to keep a person on relief; and 
if they 
did not a town's money from the state could be cut off. 
This 
happened because this was the Supervisor of the Poor's job, and 
he had to keep it going. 
Stephen II thinks this 
is because of 
greed. 
If we weren't greedy people, we wouldn't have this 
trouble. 
(This sounds a lot like what the Carneys were saying, 
see PFP83-RMO010-013). 
That guy was building his job. 
People were ashamed to get that bag of flour when relief first 
came 
in. 
But the guy who was not ashamed, his family is still 
on 
relief. 
There are four or five generations that have never 
gotten away from that pattern, and it's really sad. 
Stephen II 
used to be able to hire people for odd jobs, but can't do that 
today. 
Nobody wants to do it. 
The majority of the people in 
this township worked for local, county, state, or federal 
government. 
Now also the casinos employ a lot of people. 
TX02: G-Speedwell; 27GT (065) 
Mary asked about laws regarding 
laurel after Stephen II mentioned that some people just pick pine 
cones or 
laurel. 
Yes, he said, 
it 
is 
illegal 
to pick laurel. 
People would break the 
laurel and bring it 
in 
to an old house in 
Chatsworth that they want to fix now. 
The man who lived there 
was a broker for them, and they shipped it out by the carloads 
for decorations in the stores at Christmastime and made laurel 
rope out of it. 
It was beautiful then because it was being 
pruned every year. 
gathering 
There 
is some laurel here. 
You have to prune it. 
Now the 
laurel on their property is 
10-12 feet in the air with no green 
below that level. 
If you let a blueberry field go for 5 years 
you won't have any blueberries. 
Mary asked 
if they spend time 
in areas not related to the 
bogs, e.g., out in the plains. 
Stephen II said when you go 
into 
Ocean County on 563 where the road changes from blacktop to 
cement look to your left. 
There are pines planted by Rutgers in 
the ground that scientists said won't produce anything, and they 
are 30 feet tall 
in 25 years. 
Other kinds of trees like 
sassafras are growing there too. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 69 
(100) 
Abbot asked if we thought the plains were pretty. 
Is 
it a place you would want to bring your family back to? 
People 
get excited about it, he said, and he can't understand it. 
I 
said that I thought it was because it 
is such an unusual thing. 
Maine has a desert too. 
It's kind of a circus attraction. 
Mary asked 
if the laurel would be that way 
if the plains 
weren't the way they were. 
Two of the Lees said that it 
is 
everywhere, and 
in fact a shaded area makes a better laurel. 
(120) I asked if the trimming the 
laurel wasn't the same 
issue (as the living organism issue ) coming up again. 
Stephen 
said you would be committing a felony 
if you picked a bouquet of 
that laurel right now. 
That way it's going to die 
in a very few 
years. 
Abbot asked if what I was saying was there should be a 
season on laurel. 
There 
is not a simple solution. 
Stephen II worked 
in Birchwood Lakes and there was beautiful 
laurel and clethora and lots of different native things there. 
Now there are homes there and they put hemlock in. 
This was 
in 
1958. 
Now all 
that stuff 
is dying. 
They didn't want to cut 
anything and now it's dying. 
They thought that was natural. 
And 
not everything can be pruned the same way, e.g., rhododendron 
won't come back 
if you cut it all 
the way back and blueberry 
bushes will. 
Mary asked about curly grass fern. 
Stephen II said of 
course they knew all 
about it. 
The people who did the good 
botany work were here long before the planners, he said. 
(plant) 
TX03: G—Speedwell; 27GT (156) 
Stephen said that we should have on 
tape the story of how the Pinelands business started, and Stephen 
III was instrumental 
in starting it. 
It was the cranberry 
growers who started the thing. 
And one of the guys who was an 
original commissioner of the Pinelands thing wouldn't even want 
to go to Washington. 
It was cranberry growers who went down and got the bill 
through and met with Williams, and Thompson, and Hughes, and 
Forsythe, and Case. 
Stephen III said there was a Federal 
Pinelands Protection Act and 
it was proposed by Congressman 
Florio. 
It wasn't what most people wanted and it wasn't going to 
pass. 
So a compromise was being worked out, and the cranberry 
growers association asked a few of them to go down. 
Stephen III 
had known Hughes, a local congressman, for a while. 
They worked 
out a compromise with Williams, Case, Hughes, and Forsythe. 
This 
was 
in 1978 when the House Pinelands Bill was passed. 
It was 
part of the Parks bill. 
The concept was that there was going to be a study done 
about what needed to be done to preserve the Pinelands in 
an 18 
month period. 
After that the Pinelands Commission, which was 
created by the federal bill, 
would make a report to the Dept. of 
the Interior and also to the state legislature. 
Then they would 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 70 
go through the political process of deciding how much you could 
regulate and what should be done. 
The political decision, 
though, was not going to be made by a bureaucrat in an office. 
They were going to run 
it through the legislature, and that gives 
people who live 
in the area a chance to comment on 
it. 
You can 
talk to a politician sometimes. 
But people who are appointed 
don't have to 
listen to you. 
That was the idea. 
That wasn't good enough for those who wanted to stop 
everything now, though. 
So Gov. Byrne put out a moratorium that 
stopped everything. 
And coincident with that was his pushing his 
version of the Pinelands Bill, which gave the same Pinelands 
Commission that was set up to study and make a recommendation to 
the 
legislature the authority to not only do the study, but also 
to 
implement whatever they decided ought to be done. 
They then 
had total authority to use zoning power to the maximum, and 
police powers. 
It went way beyond the intent of what they had 
originally hoped to work out in the federal compromise. 
That, 
Stephen III said, 
is where he thinks things went wrong. 
land management 
(195) 
Stephen II 
said it was voted through on Byrne's last 
day 
in office. 
Everything was political as far as the pressures 
being put on. 
The idea was that the Pinelands Commission would 
have 7 local people, 7 people representing state interests as a 
whole appointed by the governor, and a representative of the 
Secretary of the Interior's office to put a balance on 
it. 
A 
group of cranberry growers and Hughes came up with that in his 
office. 
He said you shouldn't do that because the governor will 
get control, but they naively said we need a compromise. 
Hughes 
was right, Stephen III said. 
The Pineland Commissioners realized that they had an awful 
lot of power, and that this was a big job. 
They had to regulate 
the moratorium on building, and do a study. 
They turned over a 
lot of work to the staff. 
So suddenly the staff has a lot of 
power. 
That continues to be a problem. 
There is no way the 
Commissioners can possibly understand what is going on 
in 
the 
Pinelands. 
Every week or two, Stephen II said, volumes of paper 
come to his son's house to be read. 
Stephen II told his son 
that, "The staff is running you commission, aren't they." 
There 
are an incredible number of cases to be decided. 
The government 
is 
too big, Stephen II thinks. 
(234) 
Stephen I II continued to talk about the staff of the 
commission having a lot of power. 
The staff are nice folks, 
young kids out of college. Many of them have done nothing else, 
literally, except be members of the Pinelands Commission staff; 
and they are dedicated to preserving the Pinelands as they view 
them. 
In most cases they are not local people. 
That is not the 
issue, though, Stephen III thinks. 
There is not a broad 
background in terms of the staff qualifications. 
There are a 
couple of very highly qualified people, as 
lawyers; and the 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 71 
executive director is very skilled at getting the job done. 
A 
lot of power is 
in the hands of some very inexperienced staff 
people. 
They are making decisions that are affecting peoples' 
lives. 
A lot of small people are being hurt. 
That has to be 
turned around somehow. 
The staff has to get out of the business 
of so many regulations, and of being the zoning board for the 
area. 
We need some broad guidelines for the municipalities to 
enforce and give it back to them. 
He said they're moving toward 
that, but it's slow. 
Stephen II 
said once you have given a lot of power to 
someone you never get it away. 
Abbot said that if 
it had been 
done the way the federal 
legislation called for the staff 
wouldn't have had to design their own little bureaucracy the way 
they do now. 
This is human nature, to want to build that job as 
big as possible, especially when you are 
in 
at the onset of the 
thing. 
Industry has that problem.

Everybody 
about moving on to Mary Kay

cards, seed, brushes; and then she worked for Great Lakes Arts 
Alliance in Cleveland. 
Then she worked for the school system in 
Bayville with the Arts Council. 
Then she worked for the World's 
Fair. 
Stephen II then said he guessed she was trying to find 
herself, was that it. 
Mary said, "N000000. 
I know what's 
happening where I am." 
This 
is a permanent job she clarified for 
Stephen II. 
We talked about Christine Cartwright, that she was not a 
permanent employee of the Library of Congress. 
Boris added that 
Mary 
is running this project. 
(300) 
We continued talking about our backgrounds. I said I 
graduated from college in 
1971. 
People were joking about this 
being on tape. 
One of the first things I did was go to work for 
a cabinet maker. 
Then I began to build houses, and have been 
self employed doing that off and on for about 10 years. 
I 
stopped because I didn't want to do 
it as a full time job 
forever. 
I taught junior high school for about 4-5 years. 
I 
decided I wanted to go back to school, and I am at the U. 
of Penn 
now getting a PhD in Folklore. 
This project is occupational for 
me, not part of school. 
I'm not sure how I will use my degree. 
No, I am not married. 
TX05: G-Speedwell; 27GT (325) Abbot asked what shape the material 
we collect will take at the end of this project. 
Mary said 
we 
will have materials for the Arts Council to use and for 
curriculum packages and things like that. 
We may develop further 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 72 
case studies of things that have emerged as a result of these 
interviews. 
This might yield information that could help people 
here. 
Abbot asked if the primary objective was to publish a report 
on the lifestyle of people in the Pinelands. 
Stephen II said he 
didn't expect that the legislature will ever see 
it. 
Mary said 
that one of the things that we are doing 
is preparing a report 
for the Pinelands Commission as well. 
Everyone was talking at 
once during the last 30 seconds. 
This was obviously an 
uncomfortable topic for all 
concerned. 
Interesting. 
TX06: G—Speedwell; 27GT (350) 
Stephen II's grandchildren, Jennifer 
and Tricia, came in. 
We were also introduced to Mary Ann, 
Stephen III's wife. 
Mary continued that the report would have a 
synopsis of what we have done, and the people we have spoken 
with, e.g., people like yourselves, and people who come 
in for 
recreational uses, etc. 
The area of policy is obviously a thorny 
area, and you (Stephen III) are finding yourself in the center of 
it. 
As you have said, people who live here feel under represented. 
We are hoping we can put together a report that represents some 
of the viewpoints that have come out. 
Stephen II 
said he has sat in a congressman's office 
in 
Washington. 
There's a bill coming up on the floor, and he 
is 
watching the votes. 
This bill was on gasification, and Stephen 
II 
asked him if 
he was going to vote for that. 
He said he was 
going to vote for it, although he didn't believe in 
it; but the 
guy who proposed it 
is going to vote for my bill next time. 
Stephen said this 
is 
ridiculous. 
But you wouldn't get elected 
again 
if 
you laid your cards on the table. 
Maybe he'd be better 
off 
if he only lasted one term, though. 
They had two attorneys from the FCC trying to say that Ocean 
Spray was a monopoly. 
They'd never done anything in their life 
except go right out of college into government work. 
And some of 
the questions they asked were crazy. 
They wanted to know if 
someone came 
in and offered us x.50 per pound for cranberries, 
would we sell them to him. 
Stephen II 
said that they would not, 
they were Ocean Spray growers. 
They said, "See there, Ocean 
Spray's got you under their thumb." They didn't have sense to 
know that the Lees were not the marketers but the growers, 
Stephen II said. 
People who are making legislation today are those who were 
long hairs and hippies when we were 
in college. 
These are the 
people who are congressional aides now, and they run the show. 
The people who have the most time to talk to politicians are not 
farmers, Stephen III said. 
They're hobbyists, who might have 
hobbyists who might have preservation of the environment as a 
hobby. 
Abbot said that his father has been rather successful 
in 
what he's done as a result of hard work. 
There are some people 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 73 
who are influential 
in the Pinelands movement who are actually 
jealous of what he and others have done. 
They are not all 
that 
way .

(001) G—Chatsworth; 27GT A continuation of problems with 
legislation as an offshoot of the discussion about preservation 
legislation. Stephen II said there are many ways you can trick 
in 
legislation. An example follows: They broke the Federal Labor 
Standards Act (voice muddled, ?) by taking the Puerto Ricans 
below their pay scale. They loaned the men the money to get up to 
the states to work. This was started 
in 
1949 by an individual 
outfit formed in Trenton, which is still 
in operation. They had a 
recruiter in Puerto Rico who would furnish transportation to you. 
After you started working, after a couple weeks' pay, the money 
was deducted from your regular scale. All of a sudden it was 
against the law to do that. So then they went back to 1978 and 
picked up all 
these things with microfilm, spent thousands of 
dollars to see how much was owed. They were so far wrong in their 
figures that the Lees finally gave the government theirs. The 
government wanted to justify this. The Puerto Rican government 
had thought (under the old system) that they had a good thing. 
Millions of dollars were going back to their economy. So they met 
in Washington with government people. 
law enforcement 
The discovered the free housing they offered workers could 
be used as partial payment of whatever was owed, and there were 
other things that could be used too. They set up a date 
in 
Washington to 
iron out everything legally, and it was postponed. 
About four months went by, more meetings were postponed. The 
Puerto Rican lawyers and the Lee lawyers were there finally when 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 75 
a meeting was set up. There were fifteen people, most all 
of them 
lawyers, sitting there. A woman walked in and ordered someone to 
go get the federal register. She read a little piece published 
the month before that had just become law. 
It said that housing 
couldn't be used against transportation. She had gotten that 
thing through and postponed meetings just to beat that thing. And 
she won that case. She dashed out of the room and left everyone 
with their mouth open. This 
is the kind of government you get, 
Stephen II said. 
(045) Stephen III said the transportation arrangement for 
the workers works to their benefit. It gives them two way 
transportation if 
they stay for the term of the contract. But 
what happened was, 
if you didn't require them to pay for their 
way up, 
it was a free ticket to the mainland. All you had to do 
was sign up for work, come up to the farm, and then get a bus to 
New York. Some of them, Stephen II said, 
left right from the 
airport, and they would lose about $50-55,000 per year in 
transportation costs. That was when you were bringing 10,000 men 
per year. Getting commitment up front from them, and then giving 
them money back after they have worked a while was a lot better. 
You made a better worker, Stephen II 
interjected. 
TX02: G-Chatsworth; 27GT (055) Stephen II said if we want something 
pleasant that Mary Ann 
is a very good cook, and she has developed 
several things while experimenting with cranberries and 
blueberries. Before that Mary wanted to return to the topic of 
the National Geographic article by John McPhee. Stephen II said 
they had always had the magazine since he was a kid. When they 
read an article they took 
it as authentic. After the article on 
the Pines, and the cover picture was taken right on the Lees' 
property, they lost their belief 
in the magazine. 
McPhee, who was a friend of Byrnes, wrote the book (The 
Pines Barrens), and he paid for most of the information he got. 
He didn't interview as we are. Fred Brown made a fool of McPhee. 
He got money out of McPhee and kidded about it. McPhee was 
writing fiction. He didn't write about anybody here. He talked to 
a lot of people, but he wrote what he wanted to write. 
There was a TV program on this area that showed the Lees' 
farm, and then a shack down in Cumberland County that you would 
think was on the Lee property. When the mike 
is poked here, they 
can edit it later and say anything they want to say. Stephen II 
said they have gotten burned so much that after a while you begin 
to wonder what it 
is 
all 
about. A guy wrote an article about 
Stephen III when he was running for the Pinelands Commission that 
was an erroneous attack on Stephen II. He didn't even have his 
person straight. So they got a contradiction in the paper because 
the article was entirely wrong. It didn't mean anything because 
he gave them another dig 
in a footnote to an article the next 
week. They could have sued him. But you can't win there either. 
The person McPhee got most of his information from was a 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 76 
squatter on that farm, Stephen II said. On Haines' farm. His son 
still 
lives there, and stands 
on the highway hitchhiking. He 
never worked in his life. He picked up some of the Lees' Puerto 
Rican workers one time when he did have a car and charged him $15 
or $18 for a short ride. That winter Stephen II was driving along 
about halfway between here and Chatsworth on a cold night. And 
there he was 
in his galoshes and overcoat, and he stopped and 
picked him up. He said, "Emil, 
it's going to cost you $15 to get 
home." Emil said, "Stop the car, stop the car." And Stephen asked 
him why he did that to the Puerto Rican worker. He took him home, 
but he was an excited boy for a while there. 
That's the kind of people who were quoted in McPhee's 
article. He didn't talk to the people who could give him the true 
picture of the Pines. Mary Ann said that the reason is that the 
story wouldn't sell magazines, and that's basically what people 
are looking for, a little sensationalism. 
TX03: G—Chatsworth; 27GT (125) Abbot said he thought National 
Geographic has gone off the deep end with these extreme 
environmental groups. He asked if Boris had ties with National 
Geographic. Boris said yes, but not the magazine. Abbot asked 
Boris if 
he thought the directors, the trustees, are quite 
liberal? Boris said he did not want to debate that, but Curtis 
LeMay 
is a member and one of the most conservative individuals in 
the world. Frank Borman, the president of Eastern Airlines, the 
former chairman of the board of the Dupont Corporation. There are 
a lot of strong, conservative people on the board. Boris thinks 
the magazine is very environmentally committed, as they 
have 
been for the 100 years of 
its existence. It's a non—political 
organization, and very supportive of the National Parks 
historically. 
Abbot talked about the article on pesticides they did 3 
years ago. That was before Boris' association with the National 
Geographic. Abbot said he talked with the people who did a lot of 
the background work on that article for them, American Farm 
Bureau employees. To anyone who is familiar with using 
pesticides, it was an insult. 
It would have been fun to astound 
the layman; but for anyone who knew the least thing about 
pesticides, 
it was silly. And the accusations that were made, and 
the examples that were pulled out .... The examples were probably 
true but not representative. 
The Farm Bureau's people worked hard with the magazine 
people, and then the latter ignored all 
the former's information. 
They had pictures of a woman who flagged airplanes in California 
wearing nothing but a bra. Not your typical farm. It's not that 
she doesn't exist, but she is not representative. 
Since most people do not know anything about pesticides, 
it 
is a real disservice to society to misinform people like that. 
Especially on an issue like pesticides because the public must 
become informed. Decisions as to what should and shouldn't be 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 77 
used, and the amount of risk that should or should not be taken 
are put more and more in the public's lap. We've always been 
blessed in this country with a surplus of food, but that is not a 
divine guarantee. If anything could cause a famine 
in this 
country 
it would be a restriction in using our technology. 
Insects now eat more than our surplus of food. But famine is 
inconceivable to the average person of Abbot's age or younger, he 
said, or anyone who has never had to go to a grocery store and 
line up for a loaf of bread. When he was 20 years old, Abbot 
said, he would never have conceived of waiting in 
line for 
gasoline. 
(185) Abbot said it was a misservice to society to give 
people the picture National Geographic gave about insects. There 
ought to be people with enough oversight so that could not be 
published. Boris said that everything that goes into an article 
is checked by a number of people. He said this from his own 
experience writing for the magazine. 
(This 
is the last footage on the tape. There is some 
bleedthrough perhaps from one of the other tapes, not the one on 
the other side of this cassette I am using to 
log this 
information. I think Mary probably did turn the recorder off at 
this time (about 200 ft.), but I am not sure. I do know we had 
four reels of tape, and this is number four.)

G—New Gretna; 15GT 
(001) 
George told us about building his house. 
The house is 28 
years old. 
Their daughter is 26 years old. 
Before that time he 
lived 
in Parkertown, and he moved to New Gretna after he and his 
wife got married. 
They lived with his wife's parents for a 
couple of years until he got the house started. 
It took around 
two years to build. 
At the time George was shellfishing in 
the 
bay, for clams and oysters. 
After that he went into the fish 
factory in Great Egg Harbor Bay. 
George said he started building boats after his father got 
sick. 
His father was building sneakboxes. 
George said he 
is 
third generation building sneakboxes. 
He sold his first one 
in 
1972. 
He doesn't work on commission. 
He builds one and sells 
it. 
He has one out back his father built for a guy in Trenton 
who never used it. 
It's 19 years old. 
It was in a shed 
completely covered up and got a fungus in 
it that completely 
rotted the boat. 
It would make you sick to 
look at it, George 
said. 
A new one for that man 
is his next boat. 
(030) 
George started deer hunting with the Nottingham Club 
in 
1952 with his wife's brother. 
He helped him guide the club. 
When he got to where his health wasn't too good, George took over 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 79 
the guiding. 
They were a gunning club before, but they weren't 
too successful because they didn't know the woods. 
They hired 
him as a guide about 1950. 
The club was formed in 
1937. 
He 
would take one half of the club and George would take the other 
half. 
He would drive and George would take the standers. Then 
they would swap. 
Running a drive, 
George takes the drivers and strings them 
out through the woods. 
Sometimes they go along a road, and other 
times they bruch a line out through the thick woods. 
They'll put 
the men 25-30 yards apart. 
They get everything lined up, and 
give the standers time to 
line up. 
Then they drive towards the 
standers. 
That means that you walk through the woods hollering 
and making noise. 
If you're lucky enough to drive a buck out to 
where somebody 
is standing, then they have a chance to kill 
it. 
The standers are organized the same way. 
Monday morning, 
for example, they form two teams, an A team and a B team. 
The 
hunters stay on that team every day. 
They take turns driving and 
standing. 
They'll flip a coin 
in the morning to see who does 
what. 
At night time 
if the B team is driving, they will be 
standers in the morning for the first drive. 
No squabbling that 
way. 
The standers will be maybe 2 tenths of a mile up the road 
from the drivers. 
There 
is 
no danger of them hitting a driver 
because a deer doesn't stay that close to you. 
Usually when 
there 
is any shooting it 
is done within the first five minutes of 
a drive, or the deer will 
go too far ahead of you. 
On occasion 
deer will come back through (the drivers). 
You want to be out of 
the way when they come through. 
They try to work it so the 
drivers and standers come out even. 
They try to make a loop out 
of the two teams because the deer try to go out the sides. 
The 
drivers always shoot once the deer have passed by them. 
The 
standers can hear the drivers, but not v.v. 
That way they won't 
shoot towards the drivers. 
(090) 
The license the gun club members have 
is for bucks 
only. 
The license allows you to hunt small game also (rabbits 
for example). There 
is a special day called Doe Day when any deer 
can be shot. 
George does not like that. 
In the state of N.J. 
you can kill 6 deer per year with different licenses. Bow hunting 
season comes first, and this was passed to be able to get does to 
more or 
less equalize the herd. 
Now that has changed to bucks 
only. 
This season is during the rutting season for deer, which 
starts October 2 and just ended last Thursday (Nov. 10). 
There 
is another season 
in January for three weeks that is a 
bow season. 
It requires a different license. 
There 
is a black 
powder rifle season after the firearm season, which is the first 
full week of December, Monday to Saturday. 
Then there 
is the 
special Doe Day when you can kill 
anything, buck, doe, fawn, 
whatever. 
That is the Wed. after deer season week. 
There 
is 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 80 
quite a bit of hunter pressure on the deer. 
The deer are pretty 
wiry after firearm season, the doe and fawns that is, 
and so they 
are easy targets. 
The buck 
is smart, though, and he'll sneak 
through unless there 
is a lot of pressure on him. 
The black powder rifle season is three days long. 
During 
the bow season your permit is for one deer, but after you kill 
that deer, they'll give you another permit to kill another one. 
There's two for the shotgun also. 
There's one for black powder 
rifle season, and another one 
in January. 
There's one more too 
that George forgot the time of. 
The magazines advertise that you 
can kill 6 deer per year in N.J. 
(135) 
When George was a kid you could only kill one per 
year. 
It used to be that there was a buck only permit and one 
season per year, but the herd got pretty thick, and there were a 
lot of starving deer in the woods. 
The first time they had Doe 
Day they slaughtered the deer. 
George said again that he did not 
dig 
it. 
It is senseless. 
He would be ashamed to kill a fawn. 
The 
law 
is that a spike must be three inches long to qualify 
during seasons other than Doe Day (a buck's antler). 
They'll 
take the deer away from you otherwise. 
When a deer is running, 
though, you'd never see 
it for sure. 
(155) 
George likes to eat deer meat occasionally, but 
wouldn't like a diet of 
it. 
His club takes all 
the deer killed 
to a professional meat packer. 
They will cut 
it all 
up, freezer 
wrap 
it, 
and mark every piece. 
Then they divide it equally up 
among the club members. 
If you didn't even see a deer during the 
week of hunting, you would still get your share. 
That's for the 
only season that the Club guns, the firearm season. 
The other 
seasons people are on their own. 
(165) 
The club meets throughout the year for business. 
People use the club during the year and bring their families to 
spend a week 
in the summertime sometimes. 
They come down for 
picnics. 
They have trap shoot every other Sunday. 
They shoot at 
clay pigeons (blue rock), and they pay so much for the round (25 
shells), a box. 
A machine throws them out, and you try to hit 
them. 
The one that breaks the most during a certain period of 
shooting gets a trophy. 
It's a lot of fun. 
The club also has two fishing trips per year, deep sea 
fishing. 
A boat is chartered, but many members have their own 
boats and go by themselves. 
The main thing is deer hunting. 
(130) 
George is one of the guides. 
This year he can't take 
off until Thursday afternoon of the week. 
The year before last 
he was operated on the first day of deer season for a rotator 
cuff muscle tear in his right arm (at the shoulder). 
He had a 
bone spur that shredded his muscle. 
He was 
in a lot of pain. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 81 
Who belongs to the club? Most of the members are from 
Hamilton Square, Trenton. 
They're the main members that formed 
the club. 
They'll bring a friend or their sons 
in when they get 
old enough to hunt. 
They will 
let a boy start to hunt at 14, but 
he has to stand alongside of his father until he 
is 16. 
Even 
then he has to be close to his father. 
Deer hunting can be 
dangerous, George said. 
They don't allow any rifle slugs. 
They 
are 
legal 
in N.J. as of three years ago. 
George thinks they're 
dangerous because it 
is one pellet that will travel an unlimited 
distance. 
The country around here 
is so flat, and the deer is 
within 35 yards usually. 
You don't need that type of shot. 
They 
use buckshot. 
There's too much shrubbery in the way. 
You 
couldn't see anybody. 
All 
club members must wear fluorescent brand hats at least. 
A man can wave his hat to the guy next to him, so that man knows 
where the other person is. 
He knows he can't shoot in that 
direction. 
(235) 
Some of the sons of the original members are in there 
40's, and their sons are 
in the club now too. 
There 
is 
an 
initiation fee of $50. and the dues are $36 per year. 
There are 
different shindigs to make a few bucks to keep the place up. 
The 
taxes are pretty high. 
The blue rock shoot is an example of a 
shindig. 
There are raffles too. 
During the week of hunting each man has to pay for that 
week's hunting. 
It's divided up equally. 
It used to be cheap, 
but now it's up to $100—$150 for the week. 
That covers all your 
meals, transportation costs of running the trucks in the woods. 
They cart the men 
in the woods. 
Otherwise there would be too 
many cars. 
They build a cover that goes over the back of a truck 
and put benches 
in them and pile people into them. 
It takes 
three trucks. 
You can get stuck on these back roads. 
(260) 
The federal government has taken a lot of their 
hunting land away from them. 
The bombing range 
is an example. 
That was 5000 acres taken away from Bass River Township. 
And 
they bulldoze those roads so you can't get up and down them. 
Four wheel drivers sometimes get around them. 
They don't bomb 
during deer season, but they don't open the roads either. 
The 
deer get used to the bombing and go 
in there and stay there. 
They know it won't hurt them. 
There 
is a roster of 35-40 members now. 
They can sleep all 
of them at the club. 
We discussed going to the club later, which 
we did. (Refer to BLOGS and CLOGS.) 
They hire a cook during deer 
week and two helpers to help set the meals out. 
The hunters 
bring their own sleeping gear. 
The mattresses are on the double 
bunks. 
(295) 
Most gun clubs are on paved roads because of all 
the 
theft if you have one back in the woods. 
People tear them up; 
they steal 
all 
the plumbing. 
Two of them they burnt down. 
They 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel

were robbed over at the Nottingham Club last year, and George was 
within 100 yards of the club when 
it happened, at his wife's 
brother's place. 
He was 
in Florida and his house was broken into 
twine. 
He had to come back to 
identify what was missing. 
They 
finally caught three of the thieves, a fella and two girls. 
They 
jumped right out through the window. 
While George was helping 
his brother-in-law board his place up so he could return to 
Florida, people broke into their gun club. 
They stole a round, 
solid oak card table and an antique shotgun that was mounted over 
the fireplace. 
They stole a mounted deer head and some deer 
horns. 
They stole one man's reloader machine. 
They cut the 
lock off the cabinet where they keep the excess food, 
left over 
after deer season. 
They had a $1500 trap machine in the corner, 
and they didn't take that. 
It happened right in broad daylight. 
(and this club 
is right at the entrance to the Parkway). 
George 
would have seen them but he travelled a different way from his 
brother-in-law's house to his own house because he wanted to pass 
by a person's house that they had under suspicion. 
(330) 
I mentioned talking to Mark Darlington about putting 
money into a cranberry bog on state owned land, and theft stopped 
them from considering it. 
Cliff Frazee says the same thing about 
putting roads into a cedar swamp. 
George said he could show us 
some pieces of 
land 
in the woods that it 
is a crime the way they 
cut 
it. 
People slip back 
in there out of sight and cut what they 
want and 
leave. 
The state has a patrol, but they can't control 
it all. 
The state has a plan that you can cut your own wood for 
$10 per cord. 
You have to get a permit. 
Your name 
may be drawn 
for a Tuesday or Wednesday, and if 
you can't get off from work 
that's too bad. 
You don't have to be a resident. 
It's all 
computerized 
Some land 
is posted No Hunting. 
The Nottingham Club 
is 
lucky; they have 44 acres up 
in the Pines that belongs to them, 
and 
it's posted. 
They have put up 5 gates. 
People break them 
down. 
Right now they are using a car chassis for that purpose. 
Poachers go back in there and poach the deer. 
The deer are there 
because the members have cultivated part of 
it, 
planted it 
in rye 
grain. 
The deer like 
it. 
Yet they have killed very few deer 
around that food patch. 
George said that is because deer don't 
lay by their feed. 
They'll go 4-5 miles away to 
lay. 
(375) 
George said he used to duck hunt when he was a kid 
and even did after he got married. 
When he went to work for the 
fish plant, they had a duck program over there. 
They used to 
treat their business contacts to a free day of hunting. 
George 
was hired as a guide over there. 
They used to hunt three parties 
per day. 
They used sneakboxes. 
They did not use hand carved 
decoys, although George has carved some. 
They steal them too. 
One day he went down to go duck hunting and there were no decoys 
there. 
So he made some they wouldn't steal, out of life 
preserver corks. 
They were homey looking stools, but they still 
killed ducks over them, his uncle and George. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 83 
The company bought manufactured decoys and wrote the whole 
venture off as a business expense. 
Then the government clamped 
down on them, and they couldn't do 
it. 
The gunners would have to 
pay for their day's hunting. 
The numbers dropped considerably 
then. 
They had been furnished everything. 
There was a cook, 
three guides, all 
the boats they wanted to work with, all 
the 
booze they wanted to drink. 
They even had a big clubhouse there. 
They expanded the factory and started making fishmeal 
concentrate for Purina Cat Chow. 
What they used to wash the oil 
out of the fish was highly explosive. 
So they had to do away 
with the clubhouse. 
The name of the factory was 
Smith Menhaden 
Plant. 
Their main headquarters was Lewis, Delaware. 
(Was this 
the plant the Carneys mentioned somewhere in PFP83—RM0010-013?) 
They had two plants down there. 
George no 
longer goes duck hunting. He says he has outgrown 
it. 
It got to be too much work. You've got to get up 
long before 
daylight, and be out there before daylight to find a place to 
hunt. 
The laws put point systems on the ducks; and now you can 
only kill one black duck. 
You kill 
one and then you come home. 
It's not worth going out there. 
George mainly used to hunt for 
black duck. 
When he worked at the fish plant, they wanted to 
kill brant. 
Those people came from New York and Chicago and all 
over, and they had never seen them before. 
They loved them. 
The 
ducks used to come here and eat that green cabbage, though, and 
got fat like a chicken. 
George didn't like to eat them. 
They would set the party up three to a gunning box.

The mikes were placed tip to tip at right angles to each 
other and stood 
in between and 
in front of George and his wife. 
We sat opposite them, and the mikes were higher that we were. 
I 
sat on the floor to ensure that they would not block my vision of 
George and his wife, but they did block my vision partially of 
his wife. 
She was sitting in a funny, at right angles to, 
position in relation to her husband. 
Yet she was right next to 
him. 
Interesting. Bonnie Blair was also present.

TXO1: This is a continuation of PFP83-RM0019. G-New Gretna; 15GT 
(001) Right now George builds small parts for boats at his job. 
He builds a lot of 
lounges, does a lot of formica work, and 
builds a lot of 
ladders that go from the deck up to the flying 
bridge. 
Never time to fool around; there's always something to 
do. 
He builds plexiglass doors that have to be burnt to bring 
them back shiny after they have been cut to size. 
The ladders 
are all stainless steel with aluminum rungs and teakwood treads. 
The ladder curves at the top and bottom. 
George does not work with fiberglass. 
He said they have 
Puerto Ricans that do that. 
The white man doesn't want to work 
in 
it. 
It's really dirty and sets you on fire itching you. 
Puerto Rican labor lays up all 
the fiberglass by hand (the hull). 
The mold is polished so you could see your face 
in 
it before they 
spray the white stuff on 
it. 
All 
that stuff gets 
in the air when 
you sand. 
They wear a mask, but 
it still goes through the mask. 
They even have a special air system, but the workers still turn 
snow white with that dust when they grind it. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 85 
Out in the main factory they don't use fiberglass much. 
George is 
in the mill anyway. 
They use a lot of teak and 
mahogany. 
Before he went to work here George said he worked over 
at Viking Yachts. 
But they laid him off after he got hurt. 
He 
had been there 7 years. 
He was off 7 months with his shoulder. 
He worked six weeks after he got back and then they laid him off. 
So he took them to court and won. 
He got his first check today, 
and they have to pay him 108 weeks more. 
I congratulated him. 
George said that after that runs out he can open up the case 
again for two more years of coverage. 
The lawyer said as he gets 
older he will have more problems with that shoulder. 
Pitchers get the same problem. 
George tore his muscle 
lifting lead insulation, a 4x10 sheet. 
The bone spur looked like 
a needle. 
It showed on a dye x—ray. 
The doctor tried to heal 
it 
with therapy, and that completely shredded it. 
He did that for 
two months. 
Then he had 
it operated on. 
It's healed now, but he 
can't work overhead for too long. 
His age was against him on the 
operation, George said. 
Then he had to start therapy all over again, and the healing 
was as painful as the injury. 
I said it's amazing how much we 
take those things for granted. 
(070) 
I asked Catherine, George's wife, 
if she ever went 
hunting. 
She said no. 
She was born and raised in New Gretna. 
George said her father is one of the old timers here. 
They 
always deer hunted, all 
of them. 
she said she didn't want any 
part of 
it. 
Does she prepare the meat? 
George answered that she 
can. 
Catherine said she'll cook 
it, yes. 
George immediately 
began talking again, but I was also asking a question about 
cutting 
it up. 
She said no, when he gets it from the club it's 
already cut in chops. 
George cut in here and said it's 
like 
if 
you went to the meat store and bought it. 
Catherine said they 
get chops, steaks, and ground meat. 
And roast, George said, 
after a pause. 
I asked how she would prepare the meat. 
George 
said yes there were special ways of preparing it, 
and Catherine 
then repeated the same thing. 
George then took the floor, and 
said some people would cook 
it, and you wouldn't want to eat it 
no way. 
Catherine laughed. 
He said that deer meat has an awful 
lot of tallow in 
it. 
If you don't take that fat off of the meat, 
your tongue would stick to the roof of your mouth. 
But if 
it's 
taken care of right and cooked right it's delicious. 
She cooks 
it 
in a pressure cooker, and 
it will melt in your mouth. 
foodways, women, men 
Catherine said you can add different spices and like that. 
George said a lot of people cook 
it with wine or beer, especially 
a whole ham. 
If there's any fat on the meat when he gets 
it, 
Catherine says she trims 
it off. 
Bonnie asked if the tallow 
tastes bad as well 
as feels bad in your mouth. 
George said yes, 
it's awful gamey. Bonnie said that was the part that is strong, 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 86 
right? 
George said yes. 
George said he 
loves it 
in ground meat. 
It makes good hamburger. 
Catherine began to talk, and George 
said you just mix a little bit of pork fat or beef fat with 
it. 
That holds it together and boy that is good. 
Catherine said that 
makes it moist because venison is dry. 
George said it's a real 
dark meat unlike beef that is 
light red. 
So Bonnie said you have 
to take its own fat out of 
it, 
but you have to put other fat into 
it. 
Yes, they said. 
Bonnie asked if you could get a venison hamburger in the 
restaurants around here. 
George said no 
it's against the 
law to 
sell 
it. 
The hotel down here sponsored a gun club one time and 
advertised a venison dinner. 
The New Gretna House was raided. 
They had more than what was donated to them. 
That was before the 
present owners. 
They were fined. 
(120) 
That owner of The New Gretna House was Catalubek 
(sp?). They sponsored the Pulaski Gun Club, but it burned down 
in 
the 
last forest fire they had. 
It burned two of them. 
That was 
in 1380-82. 
I asked 
if 
the Nottingham Club was the only one George ever 
belonged to. 
George said he belonged to Ocean City Gun Club, but 
he dropped out. 
He couldn't be 
in two of them. 
It cost too 
much, and he was unemployed at the time. 
I asked if their club 
is 
run similarly. 
George said all 
of them are. 
Some of them 
will have a banquet. they'll save a couple of their deer killed 
during the season and sell tickets to the banquet to pay taxes. 
As 
long as you can account for the deer you use at the dinner 
that is 
legal. 
But you better not have too much. 
There used to 
be a time limit on how long you could keep the deer, Catherine 
said. 
George said that isn't the case any more. 
They used to 
have just one tag and you'd send to Trenton, but now you have to 
take the deer every night to a checking station, and they put an 
ownership tag on 
it. 
The checking stations are at gas stations 
or a sporting goods store. 
The state checks them the first 
couple of days, and then the store owners do 
it. 
They weight 
them, and you have to show them on a map where the deer was 
killed. 
Each area is numbered, and they can keep track of how 
many deer were killed in each area. 
(150) 
I said most of the clubs look pretty much the same. 
George said they are. 
He has been inside several of them, and 
they are similar inside as well as outside. 
Some have a bigger 
bathroom or a bigger kitchen. 
Some of them will have a cut up 
bunk affair, 
i.e., 
it will be upstairs. 
Jennivere (see CLOG) has 
there sleeping area upstairs, and downstairs is 
all eating area. 
Ocean City Gun Club 
is nearby also. 
There are three more nearby: 
Bayview and Nottingham and Therafer. 
The Therafair (sp?) club 
is 
from a town of the same name 
in N.J. 
Bayview people are from 
around Stockton, the college area. 
When Stockton College built, 
they took their club grounds. 
So there is 
no hunting there now. 
Most all 
of the clubs are populated by people who don't live 
in 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 87 
this area. 
All 
the clubs don't hire guides. 
They often have a member 
who does the scouting and runs the whole thing for the whole 
week. 
George has two nephews who help out. 
In fact they are 
going to take care of the hunting while George isn't there this 
year. 
They're members. 
Nottingham has 8 members from the area, 
and they are from Tuckerton and New Gretna. 
Bonnie asked 
if 
there were ever any women members. 
George 
said no, they have never even tried to join. 
He doesn't know of 
any club that does have women involved. 
Maybe Tuckerton has a 
couple of women who will 
gun with their husbands. 
He said you 
seldom see any women 
in the woods. 
That's a bitter dose, deer 
hunting, he said. 
You do more work deer hunting than you do on 
your own job. 
You beat that brush for eight hours a day, and 
you've been somewhere. 
That brush will tear the clothes right 
off of you. 
You wonder how a deer ever gets through there, but 
they can and fast. 
After the first couple of days the deer will 
go to where it 
is the thickest. 
They go down 
in the thick 
swamps. 
(195) 
Bonnie asked 
if you ever have to go down on your 
hands and knees. 
George said yes, and through briar patches 
especially. 
George tries to avoid those places himself. 
He got 
smarter and tries to go around them. 
A lot of guys will try to 
get through anywhere. 
Bonnie asked how they navigate 
in the woods. 
George said 
that you have to depend on the other guys. 
You guide from the 
man who 
is walking along the road. 
The man next to him should 
pay attention to the road man's location and that should follow 
right down the line. 
In some places they don't have one man on 
the road, but they are places that George and his nephews know 
the way the area runs. 
People will guide off them then. 
If 
there 
is a swamp and the standers are on the other side of 
it, 
half the team will guide off the man nearest the swamp. 
That way 
they can stay 
in 
line. 
A few people have been coming since 1937. 
They won't let 
the old people go 
into the woods. 
One man, who 
is 80, comes down 
and they make him stay by the road. 
He will go every day unless 
it 
is 
real cold. 
One old man, George said, 
loves to deer hunt. 
He will stand up against a tree and fall asleep with a radio 
going. 
George came out one day and thought the man had died; he 
was sitting on a pile of sand. 
He went up and shook him, and he 
never moved. 
His son came up and said, "Hey Pop, get up from 
there." It turned out he had fallen asleep with his earplug in 
from the radio. 
He was all 
right. 
He was only about 20 yards 
from the truck sound asleep. 
He just loved to be 
in the woods. 
(235) I asked 
if 
it was the hunting or did people just love 
to be 
in the woods. 
George said that man just loved to be 
in the 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 88 
woods. 
Does it matter if you get a deer or not, I asked. 
To 
him, no, George said. 
And people come down for companionship and 
to have a good time. 
They don't care 
if they don't ever kill a 
deer, they have said to George. 
Love to see them, 
love to have 
them killed, but if they don't see one even, they're still happy. 
Do they see each other in Trenton? 
Yes, George said, they 
all 
belong to the same fire company, a lot of them. 
This 
is 
like 
a home away from home. 
Catherine said they have two meetings a 
month. 
George hasn't been able to attend them. 
They are 
in 
Trenton I think. 
If a member wants to bring his family, they usually try to 
make 
it known. 
Then there won't be anybody there. 
Girl Scouts 
use the club twice per year during the summer. 
Usually it's a 
weekend at a time. 
They will 
go to Absagamee Lake and go 
swimming. 
(260) 
RE upkeep of the property. 
Each member is supposed 
to do his share, but only a certain few end up doing it. 
Members 
do all the upkeep on weekend. 
I said 
it sounds like a big 
commitment. 
George said it can get expensive. 
You do have to 
love 
it to do 
it, George agreed with me. 
There is one family event in the fall of each year. 
They 
have a shoot, and a big spread out. 
A picnic, Catherine said. 
There were 30-40 at least there this past fall. 
People come with 
their family to the clay pigeon shoots. 
The man will usually be 
the shooter, and sometimes they will 
let their wife shoot. 
Is 
there food afterwards, I asked? 
George said yes, there 
is food 
and a keg of beer at the once a year picnic. 
At the shoots they 
will have hot dogs, hamburgers, and beer. 
Usually some of the 
members cook. 
They take turns. 
Only for the deer hunting do 
they hire a cook. 
That cook 
is from Trenton, and he works on the 
state highway dept. 
He 
loves it. 
He was down last Sunday and 
said he can't wait to get down there for deer week. 
He just 
cooks, does not hunt. 
During deer week the bar isn't open until they come in out 
of the woods at night. 
It's closed all 
day. 
They do not allow 
any alcohol 
in the woods. 
They are very safety—wise. 
If that 
man has had too much to drink, and he don't act right in the 
morning, he don't go out. 
One member can tell another without 
any qualms. 
There 
is a deer committee. 
You go to that man and 
he would tell 
you to stay 
in that day. 
(305) 
The Deer Committee is 
in charge of keeping the place 
in order through the week. 
Every year there 
is a different 
group, but sometimes they work for two or three years at a time. 
There are four—six members. 
There 
is also a president, vice—president, secretary, 
treasurer of the club. 
The Deer Committee is the only committee

George eats breakfast, as well as other meals, at 
the week. 
He doesn't sleep there though. 
(335) 
The president of the club 
is 
in charge of running the 
meetings. 
He's just like the president of any other 
organization, he just conducts the meetings really. 
They'll ask 
for the Deer Committee's report, and the financial reports, and 
stuff like that. 
They keep their books right up to record. 
It's 
a nonprofitable organization. 
It really costs them money to 
deer hunt. 
Deer week alone costs around $3000. 
That's just for 
your eats, and your trucks, and you have to gas up every two 
days. 
That is paid for completely by the people who are hunting. 
They had a meetin' this past Tuesday.

George said they don't run the heat right now, except a 
electrical heater in the bathroom to keep the pipes fro 
freezing. 
During the deer week they have a big gas hea

They 
drain everything until March. 
You could rough it. 
They usually 
wait until the end of March before turning the water back on. 
Then they will put the electric heater on just in case it does 
get cold.

so that's 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel

what they done. 
They built a small place, and then bought a 
surplus army barracks, and added that onto 
it. 
And finally they 
added on a new bunk room. 
They just got more members, and more 
members, and more members, and they had to expand. 
Bonnie asked if a lot of them were made from army barracks. 
George said their building was, except the bunk room. 
I asked 
if 
the Nottingham is an early one. 
George said it 
is 
of the ones 
still existing. 
A lot of them back up 
in the woods have burned 
down, and many of them were older. 
Many are made out of cinder 
block. 
They were made because of the forest fires going through

TX01: G—New Gretna; 15GT This 
is a continuation of PFP83—RM0020. 
(001) 
Catherine said that local people, although they do not 
belong to clubs by and large, usually meet at someone's house and 
just go out for the day. 
Her father, for example, never belonged 
to a club; but there were townspeople who were close enough would 
come and they would go out. 
Kind of like having a club without 
the house, I said. 
Catherine agreed and so did George as he got 
off the phone. 
George said people from the area would then 
decide to go off on their own and build a place. 
Catherine's 
brother and her father had a place up 
in the woods that burned 
down, George said. 
This reminded George about the picture that Elaine asked us 
to be sure to take pictures of. 
It 
is 
of a fire 
in which a 
devil—like figure can be seen, quite clearly once you see 
it. 
The implication is that it 
is the Jersey Devil. 
The picture was 
taken 
in July 1977 about five or ten minutes after the firemen in 
the area burned up. 
It was taken by George's nephew. 
(I think 
Cliff Frazee talked about this too.) 
That 
photo was taken right 
as the fire jumped across the road, George said. 
George said he 
had a better one taken with infrared and 
it was a lot plainer. 
The press photographer took a picture of the same spot, but it 
doesn't show in hers. 
George said his nephew claims that on the 
larger picture there is a smaller image as well. George said he 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 92 
built a sneakbox for a detective in Middletown, N.J. who told him 
his wife was psychic. 
So George got him a copy of the picture. 
He said there 
is definitely an 
image there. 
(040) 
I asked what George thought the image was, and he 
said nobody knows. 
You've seen the picture of Christ in a house 
that is burning up, he said. 
Christ is standing in the doorway. 
That, to George, 
is one of those deals. 
He said he doesn't know 
if 
it 
is the Jersey Devil, that nobody knows what the Jersey 
Devil 
looks like. 
But Catherine couldn't get over that picture 
either, George said. 
belief 
It was actually Catherine's nephew that took the picture. 
He was a member of the first aid squad, and was allowed to go up 
roads that were blocked off. 
That picture was taken no more than 
20 minutes to a half an hour after those firemen were burnt up, 
George said. 
George said he saw the truck later. 
His other 
nephew, George said, Catherine's sister's boy, was on a fire 
truck ahead of them when the trucks went into the woods. 
But the 
truck that had its antenna broke off, George said. 
So they don't 
know. 
They have it on tape that it was a garbled message. 
All 
"they" heard was, "We're 
in trouble." 
(They must mean the 
nephew's truck.) 
The fire burnt their truck completely up. 
You 
can see where the hoses laid. 
The tank still had 900 gallons of 
water in 
it. 
Two of the men walked out the way they came 
in. 
They were 600 yards away from the truck when it got the other men 
right by the truck. 
(070) 
Bonnie said that the fire must move so fast. 
George 
said that it did. 
It gets up 
in the tops of these trees, and you 
can't imagine how fast it goes. 
It makes its own wind. 
The top 
was way ahead of the bottom. 
You had two fires going. 
The truck 
was up against a pine tree. 
The state after that put a tighter control on who fights 
fires. 
They have control over every truck that goes into the 
woods. 
The truck that burnt was from Westcreek in Eagleswood 
Twnshp. 
That's only about 5-6 miles up the road. 
That was a 
volunteer fire company. 
They made brush trucks out of an old 
army truck, four wheel drive with double axles in the rear. 
(100) 
Discussion of the other picture, the larger one. 
Someone wanted to buy it, 
and George let him have 
it. 
He wishes 
now that he still had it. 
Catherine said he figured he could get 
another one, but the next lot wasn't as clear. 
His nephew still 
has the negative. 
George said that he bet the first person who 
took the first print took some off of 
it. 
His nephew didn't know 
it was in there until after he had taken it. 
It was a polaroid. 
Once you get your eyes onto 
it, you can visualize the whole 
thing, George said. 
In the big one, 
it even showed a tail—like 
thing. 
Catherine said she didn't know if she had seen the bigger 
one, after George had asked for corroboration. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 93 
George said he could take us right now and show us where it 
happened (and we did pass by the road leading into that spot 
later). 
That's right over in back of Lake Absagamee. 
The fire 
burnt itself out in the 
lake and the swamps. 
You could look for 
miles and miles and miles and see nothing but black, George said. 
A few years later it burnt the other side of the road. 
It went 
right through their food patch (rye field) area. 
It came back 
some green after that. 
It was real pretty. 
It's just as thick 
now as 
it was 4 years ago when that last fire went through there, 
George said. 
It's real thick now where the picture was taken. 
There 
is a lot of deer food, acorns and stuff like that, there 
now. 
The fire don't kill that oak, and the pine will 
reseed 
itself. 
Right where they cut that off afterwards it 
is thick in 
there. 
You can walk through now, but once it gets above your 
head 
it will 
be too thick to walk through. 
(140) 
We began to get ready to go to the Club. 
George said 
it would be cold over there, unless the fella that comes down 
every weekend usually has gotten there already. 
One of the 
members has been coming down every weekend. 
He 
is single, 
divorced. 
He gets away from his job up 
in Trenton. 
He usually 
gets a fire going, and he sleeps 
in a bedroll. 
He enjoys 
himself. 
Bonnie asked 
if George made the furniture, the lamp and 
stuff. 
George and Catherine said together that George's father 
built that lamp and the desk, and another lamp the first year 
they were married. The table 
is an antique that was her mother's, 
George said. 
He did that all 
over. 
That was all 
apart. 
Re the 
desk 
is made out of old kitchen cabinet doors (I think) and the 
frame is maple. 
The lamp 
is made of red cedar. 
( I don't have 
pictures of these pieces. 
Perhaps Elaine does.) 
(160) 
We are breaking the equipment down to 
leave, but have 
one mike on, hand held. 
I asked about the photographs on the 
television. 
Catherine said they were their two granddaughters. 
George said one 
is three and the other one 
is two months. 
Catherine said the little one was there with them last night for 
a little while. 
They said they have one daughter, just the one. 
She lives 
in Mystic Island, down where the radio station used to 
be. 
(That is the development the Carneys talked about PFP83-
RMO010-013) 
It 
is a newly developed area. 
George said they are 
building a new house how in back of Wood St. 
They started it 
this past week. 
They sold there house in Mystic. 
It was too 
small for the two children. 
It was on the lagoon. 
I said I never met grandparents who weren't having a great 
time. 
George laughed and agreed. 
(190) At this point we were riding 
in the car, George in the 
front with me, and Bonnie 
in the back holding the mike. 
We were 
talking about hunting areas, and I said each guide, or leader, 
must know where the other clubs hunt, since there are so many of 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 94 
them in the area. 
George said, yes, and the deer move back and 
forth. 
You never know where they will be. 
The does aren't as 
smart as bucks. 
They haven't been shot at as much. 
George pointed out where he used to work, Viking Yachts (on 
Rte. 9 in New Gretna). 
George said you have to be careful 
driving around here (We were a couple of hundred yards in from 
Rte 9) because you never know when a deer will jump out. 
Bonnie asked 
if the gun clubs confer with each other about 
where they will 
be hunting. 
George said no, that they just know. 
We passed Bayview Club. 
That's new. 
It was once called the Last 
Minute Club, a small club. 
They never done much. 
They broke up 
and sold the club to the people from Stockton. 
I said 
it seemed 
pretty close to Rte. 9 and peoples' houses. 
George said yes, 
it 
was, and that deer travel right through here. 
Bonnie asked if they gunned right around here, near peoples' 
houses. 
George said they did, that it didn't seem to bother 
them. 
They're not afraid of a house. 
(They refers to the deer. 
This 
is an 
interesting difference in point of view. 
George 
obviously knows something we don't know. 
This was definitely a 
highlight of the interview.) 
We passed the Burlington County Mosquito Commission a few 
hundred yards later. 
This is where our friend Dennis comes to 
sterilize mosquitos (or oes?). 
We arrived at the entrance to the Parkway, and George said 
that used to be all 
houses. 
The Parkway took them all. 
Muffled 
section. 
George said he came up this way one day, and there was 
a big buck walking right across the road. 
That was a year ago. 
There's a lot of deer back here, George said. 
TX02: G—New Gretna; 15GT Just beyond the entrance to the Parkway, 
on the left, 
is the Nottingham Fishing and Gun Club. 
And I mean 
just beyond, maybe 60 feet beyond. 
We pulled up 
in front of the 
front doorway on the grass. 
George pointed out the deer rack 
where they hang the deer (see BLOG and CLOG). They haven't had 
any trouble with people stealing them. 
They just put a new light 
on 
it. 
(235) 
We then went inside the club. 
George pointed out the 
poker table in the barroom. 
Then he pointed to the framed record 
of the deer killed each year. 
(For photographs of the 
inside of 
the gun club see BLOGs and CLOGs.) 
They first began keeping a 
record in 
1946. 
there was a pheasant hanging on the wall. 
George said, "He's 
in bad shape. 
He's seen a lot better days." 
There were containers of blue rock 
in the barroom too. 
George showed us the shirttail club. 
Every time someone 
misses a deer, they cut their shirttail and pin 
it on the 
bulletin board in the barroom. 
They've had a lot of them hanging 
there, more than are there now. 
George said he was luck last 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 95 
year, he killed two. 
He said he just happened to be 
in the right 
place at the right time. 
and you got 'em, I said. 
George said, 
"Yup." 
I asked about the picture of the rabbits, hundreds of them. 
That used to be out west, George said. 
They used to catch them 
and send them here (to N.J.?), but they don't do that any more. 
Disease control prohibits interstate transport now. 
George said 
they used to stock rabbits here. 
The season is 
so 
long, that you 
could get them from out West and the season would still 
be 
in. 
They would kill them as soon as they dropped them off, so they 
had to stop it. 
The barroom is not open until after 5 pm. 
(280) 
George then showed us the bunkroom, with double bunks 
lined up on either side of a main aisle. 
There are fold away 
bunks that fit down the aisle as well. 
They can sleep about 35 
here. 
they have a chart that shows who bunks where. 
The president usually takes care of the bunk assignments. 
They had a gang down last Sunday that mopped the room up. 
They 
will still have to come down to do dishes yet. 
Preparations are 
being made for deer week now. 
George next showed us the kitchen. 
He said it 
is small, but 
serves the purpose. 
They have a Magic Chef restaurant stove. 
(305) 
We saw the bathroom next. 
Two toilets, George said 
they can hold hands, chuckle. 
They've never run out of hot 
water, George said 
in response to Bonnie's question. 
There 
is a 
large shower area. 
(I think I forgot to take pictures of the 
bathroom. 
Interesting— why didn't I?) 
Bonnie continued to talk to George while I set up the 
lights 
for photographing the club. 
(Bonnie logs this section) 
(316) 
We are talking about the mounted deer skulls, and 
other skulls, above the fireplace, 
George says they are all 
kills from this club. 
I said the skull bones look so small, and 
he says they're just the tops; the lower jaws are not on them. 
You can tell 
the size of the buck whose skull 
is there by the 
number of points on the horns. 
Here they count both sides: 
that 
is, a skull with four points on each horn is called "eight 
points" not four. 
(323) 
Up to the left of the fireplace is a small glass 
fronted case with a series of 
little rectangular brass plates 
inside, each with a name on 
it. 
This 
is their list of deceased 
members. 
the case has a light inside it, and they keep it 
lit 
during deer week. 
George tried to turn it on to show me, but the 
light wouldn't go on. 
There 
is a sofa in front of the fireplace 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 96 
( which now has a stove 
in 
it), where people flop down. 
theyused 
to have a big shotgun mounted above the mantelpiece, but it was 
stolen in the break-in. 
On the mantelpiece are some deer skulls 
and turtle shells that they have found 
in the woods; the deer 
don't have any teeth 
in the front, on the top jaw. 
George tells 
me that they don't have front teeth on the bottom either, "they 
nip all 
their food." 
The turtle shells are all white, and George 
thinks it 
is because they were picked up after a fire. 
He showed 
me a deer lower jaw, to compare with the uppers. 
You can tell 
how old a deer is by how much of his teeth he has left; they wear 
their teeth right down to nothing, as they age, just by chewing. 
The old ones just have little nubs; they don't seem to 
live much 
longer than 6 or 6 and a half years. 
They eat mostly brush. 
(360) 
We went back into the bar, and he showed me the 
record of how many deer were killed 
in each year. 
The one record 
shows the years 1946 through 1975; there were 115 deer killed in 
that time; a lot of years they didn't kill any. 
The first year, 
1946, they didn't kill any. 
(370) 
They've never had any fires happen during the hunting 
season; they usually happen during the summer. 
(373) 
There's a picture of a wedding party on the wall 
in 
the barroom. 
It 
is George's daughter and his son-in-law. 
They 
had their wedding reception here 
in the club. 
The hall 
is 
not 
ordinarily rented out for such occasions, but this was a special 
exception. 
It's hard to get insurances on these places, because 
there are no permanent residents. 
They would have to meet 
different requirements in order to rent it for public uses. 
The 
insurance rates are very high, too. 
And the taxes are "out of 
this world." 
They pay over $2,000 a year in taxes, between the 
clubhouse and the food patch area. 
Up there 
in the woods (the 
food patch) it's cheaper, because the ground 
is assessed for 
less. 
It goes up every year. 
(408) 
Mal 
looks for a socket to plug 
in more lights, and 
George directs him to a base plug under a small countertop. 
That 
is where they always put their beer cooler, right under the 
counter. 
George gave Mal 
an adapter for the outlet, and assured 
him that he had plenty of time to talk and show him around.

(001) 
While I was setting up the lights for shooting the 
barroom, Bonnie asked George about a stone she saw on the bar. 
George said one of the members found it up 
in the woods 
in their 
deer field. 
The member put the eyes in 
it. 
Bonnie said it 
looked just like an old skull. 
George said there 
is a write-up 
in 
the paper right after he found it about a stone age piece 
found (unclear what George called it) 
in Spain that looks similar 
to the rock, very similar. 
I have a shot of the rock next to the 
article. 
Who knows what it 
is, George said. 
Bonnie noticed a seat belt nailed to a bench 
in the bar. 
George said they put that on there for him one year as a joke. 
They strapped him in. 
f 
Bonnie noticed a Mercerville Fire Co. 
label 
on something, 
and George said that is where the Nottingham Gun Club members are 
from up near Trenton. 
Bonnie asked where the name for the club came from, and 
George said he didn't know; that he had never been told. 
This 
is 
the original site, and the house was part of a trap house. 
they 
used to have these big trap shoots. 
Listed on the wall are the 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 98 
names of some of the old members of 
it. 
The bar 
is the part of 
the house they had first. 
The dining/living room is the old army 
barracks. 
Originally they used the barroom for everything. 
Then 
they used the two rooms for everything. 
Then they added on the 
bunkroom and so forth. 
Bonnie saw a three inch rack measuring device. 
George 
explained that that was how long the horns of the deer had to be. 
A lot of the members play poker in the bar. 
That was where 
they had the break-in and the old table was stolen. 
They upset 
everything, George said. 
George thinks it must have been someone 
who had been here before. 
They knew how the sliding bolts worked 
on the windows. 
(055) George asked Bonnie how much territory we had covered 
working on the project. 
She said as far south as Woodbine and 
north as far as Fort Dix and over to the shore. 
Bonnie began to read the cartoons on the wall, and look at 
the plaques, 
like the one for the most one-eyed deer. 
George 
said they had a member who killed two or three deer with only one 
eye, the deer that is. 
Probably from fighting they got a horn 
stuck 
in their eye. 
Another plaque was for the club's biggest 
outlaw. 
George said that was years ago he guessed. 
hunting 
There was a cartoon that said, "The only buck I saw all 
year." 
It showed a man pulling up his pants after relieving 
himself 
in the woods. 
As he was pulling them up, a buck ran by. 
Someone had penned in the name of one of the members who was a 
mainstay of the club, George said. 
He had since died; he had had 
two strokes, one right after the other. 
(085) 
Bonnie looked at a deer's head mounted, and George 
said that the man who killed the deer had it mounted even though 
it was only a four point rack. 
He did this because it was the 
first deer he had ever gotten after being in the club for sixteen 
years. 
George said he even got sick after he shot it. 
They've 
been kidding him ever since. 
Bonnie said she guessed it was not always what it seemed. 
George said no, 
it's a pretty good jolt on your nervous system. 
It doesn't bother him any more, George said, after he's killed as 
many as he has. 
To George he doesn't even care 
if 
he ever kills 
another one. 
I'd like to see somebody else kill 
them. 
Bonnie said the fella she talked to 
last week mostly hunts 
with a bow. 
George said he doesn't like bow hunting because you 
cripple too many deer. 
Bonnie said that is what that man said. 
George said you have to be an expert trailer to find the deer 
after you hit them. 
George said the deer will go off and die and 
nobody gets the benefit of them. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 99 
(102) 
What about rabbits, Bonnie asked. 
George said 
rabbit season 
is 
in now. 
(Bonnie begins to 
log here:) 
These particular rabbit heads that are mounted in the bar 
"are 
in bad shape; they should be thrown out. 
They're not from 
around here, anyway; they're out of state rabbits." 
That's what 
they told George, anyway, when he first joined the club. 
In 
fact, one of them is a jackrabbit. 
(111) 
The lawnmower is stored 
in the barroom right now. 
They keep the front mowed nice. 
(118) 
The stove in the barroom really puts out. 
It gets so 
hot in there that they don't really keep it going, during deer 
week. 
(127) 
all 
the deer clubs seem to get a bad name; people say 
they are a bunch of alcoholics, because they have a bar on the 
place. 
But George says their club doesn't ever have alcohol 
in 
the woods. 
they're very safety-wise. 
Still, a lot of people 
have the 
idea that all they do 
is 
go 
in the woods and drink and 
throw beer cans around. 
They don't even buy 
it by the can; they 
buy 
it by the keg. 
Their cooler fits right up under the counter. 
The fire company has 
it now, but they let them use 
it for deer 
week every year. 
The ones who do 
leave the beer cans out in 
the 
woods are "people riding around." 
Now they're also starting to 
leave their trash out in the woods, that they can't get rid of at 
the dump, 
big household stuff like refrigerators and stoves. 
It's a crime what they're doing. 
They throw out old lumber, 
stuff like that. 
they go back up 
in the woods where nobody 
travels too much, and dump it. 
George sees it every weekend. 
(147) 
There 
is also a large metal barrel-shaped object with 
a blue plastic lid near the side door. 
It 
is a cooler that they 
keep a keg of beer in when they have it outside. 
The top has a 
cushion 
in 
it, 
and you can sit on 
it. 
(157) 
We moved up to the far end of the main room, near the 
bunkroom door, to photograph the kitchen. 
George unplugged the 
refrigerator temporarily to accommodate the lights. 
(162) 
(Tape turned on 
in mid-conversation, as George showed 
me some details of a map of the New Gretna area which is pinned 
up on the wall near the bunkroom door. 
Part of the land, he 
says, used to be public, but the federal government took it over; 
it 
is near the bombing range. 
The high-speed aircraft and 
missiles that there using now are so powerful that they had to 
have a bigger buffer zone. 
The fly only fifty feet in the air -
just like you see on the news, 
in the other countries; that's 
what they're practicing right here.

them, to mark the area where they hit. 
They set a forest fire 
just 
last summer up here with one. 
It bounced off the target 
area and out in the woods and set the woods afire. 
They got it 
out, but it burnt quite a few hundred acres before they got it 
out. 
Some of the guys that George knows found two deer that got 
trapped 
in that fire and burnt up. 
They usually manage to get 
out around it, 
but sometimes not, especially where there's a 
mother with young ones who can't run and keep up. 
She'll stay 
there and protect them.

George again reassures Mal 
to "keep right on going. 
You don't get too many chances like this."

They can't do anything with the feed lot, other than 
what it 
is.. But it doesn't grow much in spots, anyway, because 
the soil 
has a lot of clay in 
it. 
They have rye grass planted 
there now. 
They never had plans to build on the feed lot land; 
they only used 
it for hunting purposes. 
It would be useless to 
build up there anyway.

There were some developers who came in, down to a place they call 
Offshore Manor. 
they developed it, built around 150 homes

there, maybe more, and they have sewage problems.

it doesn't drain. 
People are having to

They're in a

The government gave them so 
much, a grant, for assistance, but the rest they have to pay for 
themselves — $1,200 or $1,300 to hook up to 
it. 
And it's 
mandatory. 
If people can't afford it, 
they'll probably lose 
their homes. 
That developer moved 
in there, and moved out, and 
left the township hanging. 
They had a serious problem. The 
sewage was running down the streets and everything. land

In the car now, driving back to George's house. 
Some 
people were parked across the road from the club when we came 
out; 
he observes that they're campers, they have everything all 
loaded up. 
He only lives about a mile and a half from the club. 
He warned Mal 
to watch out for deer, that they would be 
liable to 
run right in front of him. 
At that exact moment, one did run out 
in front of the car and on across the road; George says 
it 
looked 
like a "spiked buck" but he couldn't tell for sure. 
It did look 
to him like he had 
little horns. 
You have to drive slowly and 
carefully all 
through this wooded part of the road. 
The one that 
crossed in front of us George estimated to be about a year and a 
half old. 
Around here they are the white—tail deer. 
They run 
across the road when they see the headlights; sometimes it blinds 
them, and they'll 
run right straight for it.

(300) 
We passed a place where there used to be what they 
called a CCC Camp, right after world war I. 
That was the 
Civilian Conservation Corps; 
it gave men jobs right after the 
war. 
All 
the buildings are gone now. 
They planted these white 
pines 
in 
1913; they're called Loblollies (the pines). 
He 
describes the way the buildings used to be put in this part of 
the woods. 
We passed a place where some firemen had died 
in a 
forest fire, and there 
is a monument to their memory, set back 
from the road a little ways. 
We crossed a little bridge at the 
Head of Bass River; 
it 
is 
right at the headwaters. 
Right up the 
next road to the right from there 
is where the "Jersey Devil" 
fire picture was made, the one that his nephew took. 
It was up 
the road about half a mile. 
We passed the Pilgrim Lake 
campgrounds office, and on a little bit, the Ocean City 
Sportsmen, another gun club. 
George predicted it would be all 
lit up, because they were working on the building; he was right 
They are building on to

They have turkey shoots there, to 
raise money.

target wins the turkey. 
Mal said he used to think that they 
really shot turkeys, until he saw a "turkey and ham shoot" 
advertised; then he knew something was up, because they wouldn't 
be shooting at a ham. 
(358) 
We passed another building which used to be a 
gunning club, but is now a home. 
Not all gunning clubs survive. 
It gets so expensive for them, that some of them fade out. 
(361) 
The deer look out toward the road sometimes at night 
and you can see their eyes. 
Their eyes shine like a ball 
of 
fire. 
George refers back to the deer that jumped out in front of 
us this evening, saying that if Mal 
had been going about 40 mph 
that deer would have run right into the car. 
They could jump out 
anywhere along this wooded stretch of the road. 
(378) 
George is pretty familiar with the part of the Pines 
that is 
up around New Lisbon, where we are. 
(379) 
We passed another gunning club (they are thick around 
here), this one called the Janivere (sp?). 
It is two story; they 
have their bunking upstairs. 
It 
is pretty close to George's 
house. 
George's brother—in—law is a member of the same gun club 
as George. 
He came up from Florida last year to gun, and got 
sick. 
Then when he 
left to go back, there was a 6—inch 
snowstorm. 
It rained all Saturday night, then there was the 
snowstorm on Sunday; he had snow all the way down to Georgia.

You get wet walking through the brush, and you get very cold, 
"but you can tell where the deer are."

Frazee driving with O'Connor. 
This is the Bryant Road --
we're headed northwest. 
It was widened for a firebreak by the 
forest fire (service) 
(The tape keeps getting snarled up 
in these early moments) 
This 
is what they call a tinderbox area. 
Fires happen every 
twenty years or so. The last one here was 1962. 
We're due for 
another one. 
We're not on his land yet. 
(Czarnecki and Hufford were 
riding in the back of the pickup. 
O'Connor was riding 
in 
the 
cab with the recorder) 
His tree farm is 800 acres. He's thinned 
out about 600 acres. 
He thins 60 — 100 acres per year, depending 
on how thick it 
is. 
The control burn takes care of the brush. 
Control burning requires a temp of 35-45 degrees. 
The wind has 
to be steady, not shifting. "There's a big buzzard." 
There's a 
lot of gambling when you control burn. 
Mal 
notices there's a bunch of buzzards. 
"Probably a deer 
here, dead," says Cliff. "Sometimes the hunters leave some part 
of the deer here and the buzzards come after it 
We're taking a

He started the tree farm in 
1977. 
It's the only thing you

can do with the land under the Pinelands Commission. 
He says 
it's a good thing, because you can't have all 
the land as houses 
and roads. 
We're on the Ridge Road -- the road that runs between 
Brookville and Forked River, heading east. 
land management 
Cliff knows the area by heart, because he was brought up 
with it. 
If he started to learn 
it, he says, he'd never learn 
it. 
There's been a lot of traffic in here. 
He bought the 
property. 
He was raisin' a family and made the extra money to 
buy 
it. 
Property varies 
in value. 
Because you can't do much 
with 
it, 
the property isn't so expensive anymore. 
Cliff gets out 
to open up the gate. 
5 min 
A week ago bow season started, so there may be some 
hunters 
in here. 
Bow season lasts about a month -- there's black 
powder season, and doe season, 
you have to be really up on 
it 
-- Cliff thinks bow hunting requires a lot of skill and practice. 
(Break in tape) 
We're standing at the Year—Round Sportsman's club, talking 
to some hunters, there for bow season. 
Most of the members are 
from Monmouth County, Fairhaven, Rumson, Little Silver 
-- the 
Freehold gun club 
is called "Old Ironsides" -- it's on the Bryant 
Road. 
(Hufford and O'Connor are figuring out the equipment) 
They're making fun of Tom Brown the tracker -- Cliff: 
"He 
claims to be an Indian but he still eats 
in diners and smokes 
cigarettes." 
A hunter: "He wanted the job of state tracker and the state 
wouldn't give 
it to him." 
Another: He claims he lives 
in the woods nude, and 
it can be 
done. 
If you want to walk around with them jiggers nude, buddy, 
go right ahead (laughter) 
Cliff: You know, they don't bother me at all? 
A hunter: A guy last Saturday, he got twenty—five of 
'em. 
Cliff: Well, I'm workin' 
in the swamp all the time, and I 
never get 'em. 
MH: What can you do about them? 
Cliff: The best thing to do 
is take a bath as soon as you can. 
A hunter: As soon as you get right outa this woods here, as 
soon as you get home 
is take a bath, take a shower. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 105 
They say that using Clorox and nail polish is all boloney. 
A hunter: The paper had a big article on them, and that's 
all 
boloney. They lay on the trees and bushes in clusters, 
like 
-- we could all walk through -- you might be over here and get 
into a cluster of 
'em, and I may be over here and not get any. 
Cliff: I think they're on certain kinda bushes too. 
A hunter: I think early 
in the morning 
Cliff: There's a bush I call sand tick bush (I think it's 
the one Jack Cervetto calls 'woodjin's enemy'), I don't know what 
the right name of 
it 
is, 
but I think they're on this bush right 
here. 
A hunter: I was gonna cut that down and put it in my bonne (?) 
Cliff: I think that's where they're at, 
right here -- that's 
what I call a sand tick bush. 
But I don't know the right name of 
it. You gotta have good eyes to see 
'em -- they're red, 
like. 
A hunter: They usually go around your belt line -- where 
your clothes are tight -- or on your socks 
Another: walk up your pant legs, where it's real 
dark and 
your clothes are tight, that's what they like 
Cliff : and you're sweatin' 
in there and the tick goes 
in 
your skin. 
A hunter: They got the deer ticks now around here. 
Another hunter (they're all 
talking at once about this 
phenomenon) : You should tape your pants up. 
Right now it's 
alright, but after a rain, when the sun comes up that's when you 
really get it. 
MH: So deer ticks are different than sand ticks? 
A hunter: Oh yeah -- deer ticks are -- well they claim 
they're around all winter long, but they're usually around where 
the animals are. Deer trails and all that sort of thing, they lay 
around the deer trails. 
Another hunter: Not sand ticks, they're sand fleas really, 
is what they are, they're so small. 
A hunter: Like if you sit 
in the dirt -- like I'll never sit 
-- I used to sit along the fields on 539, huntin -- I'll never do 
that again, sit in the grass. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel

Cliff: You know, I worked in the swamp all summer long, and 
I never get sand ticks, now how do you figure it? 
A hunter: I think it's your luck --
Cliff: It must be 
Mal: Maybe it's body odor 
Cliff: Maybe I'm not satisfactory 
A hunter: Maybe you're not tender enough 
Mal: Maybe 
if 
you're around that much, you blend in better 
or something 
Cliff: I don't understand it 
A hunter: They say every country 
in the world has 
'em, I 
don't know. 
Cliff: There's somethin you want to get rid of -- That's 
some kind of a thistle -- you don't want it around a hayfield --
JC: finds a puffball 
Cliff; That's off an oak tree 
JC: 
No 
it's growing out of the ground 
Cliff: Oh, I see 
when they get dry you step on 
it and 
it's 
like a powder. 
JC: Let's move away from this (sand tick) bush here 
We're hooking Cliff up to the lavalier mike now. 
We spot 
some sugar sand. 
We're on a road that isn't on the map. 
It's a 
road that was always for getting cedar out. 
Cliff: Now here's an old corduroy road, I wanna show it to 
you, that was probably built maybe a hundred years ago, and you 
can still see 
it. 
I wanna show it to you. 
See, this was an old 
corduroy road a hundred years ago -- you can still see 
it. 
That's a straight line right across the swamp. 
And nothing grows 
in that corduroy road. 
MH: 
Is that a crossway? 
Cliff: It 
is a crossway. 
It was used to get the cedar out. 
They built the road straight across -- then they cut the cedar on 
both sides, and recently there's been some cedar cut in here, but 
that's just recent. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 107 
MH: 
Is this sheep laurel? 
Cliff: I think it 
is, 
I'm not sure. 
There's different kinda 
huckleberry -- I'm no authority on most of this brush, see. 
Now 
if 
you want to see what it looks like, we'll have to go 
in a 
ways. 
We go 
in a ways. 
Cliff: You have to be quite careful, because there 
is wet 
spots. 
I'm tryin to pick out a way. 
You can go 
in up to your 
knees 
if you're not careful. Now this 
is the corduroy road right 
here. 
It's a straight line. 
I'm standin right in the middle of 
it, 
and it's approximately 600 feet long across this swamp. 
I 
would estimate that this was built about a hundred years ago, 
because these trees has grown up since then, see. 
Since then 
it's deteriorated, 
it's settled, but you can still see 
it. 
What 
happened is 
it settled and the water come in here, 
it's a little 
bit low for any vegetation to grow. 
The vegetation has to be a 
little higher, 
like where she's standin. 
Mal: 
When they first built these roads, what kind of size 
lumber did they use? 
Cliff: They used anything between three and six inches, and 
they laid the poles lengthways and they laid the poles crossways, 
and put brush on top. 
And in them days they had to use wagons. 
That's the only way they could get it out. 
Mal: Underneath the poles that go straight up there, did 
they have anything underneath that or did they drop those 
in the 
muck or whatever. 
Cliff: See this was all 
stumps and they had to cut the 
stumps flush -- as 
level 
as they could, and then they laid the 
poles down lengthways -- over the stumps and whatever they cut 
off -- and then they had to put poles crossways. 
Sometimes they 
had to use slabs crossways -- then the way I do 
it, I put brush 
on top of the slabs -- and that distributes your weight, and 
holds the slabs 
in place. 
That's sphagnum moss. 
(Hufford is fingering it) 
It grows 
in the wet area, and the swamp 
is generally all wet. 
It takes a 
wet area for sphagnum moss to grow. Now in the North Branch, 
sphagnum moss doesn't grow much, because it seems to be a little 
bit too high -- sphagnum moss needs a lot of water. 
It needs a 
lot of shade too. 
There used to be a lot of people who'd gather 
it, 
but I don't know of anybody that gathers it anymore. Now what 
they used to use it for in World War I, 
they used 
it for 
bandages, 
like for healing. 
They say 
it has a lot of healing 
quality, but they probably have things that take its place now, 
so there's not much use -- the only thing they use 
it for now is 
for nurseries to keep plants moist. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 108 
There are many kinds of vegetation here on the edge of the 
swamp. 
Huge swamp huckleberries, laurel, junk trees: gum and 
maple. 
They're getting to be worth something now as firewood. 
It's not what you're harvesting. 
We're harvesting cedar, and 
anything less than cedar we call junk trees. 
Now this 
is your 
gum here -- the black gum. 
Doesn't recognize a tree with red 
berries. 
That's a brush, he says, that never gets any bigger. 
Now here's your reseeding of the cedar (shows us some 
seedlings) -- 
in the area that I have cut off up there, there's 
just thousands of them, so it's gonna come up good. 
The only reason that these young cedars come up, the 
sunlight come 
in, 
see -- and 
if 
it stayed shady -- 
if these trees 
were still up, they wouldn't come up, because it would be too 
shady. 
Mal: So you're constantly thinning out with future growth 
in 
mind. 
Cliff: That's nature, see -- now here, we gotta be careful 
how to get across here. 
Mal: 
Let me just try it, because, you know, you only live 
twice. (sounds of brush brushing and slush slushing) 
So far, so 
bad. 
Cliff: I should've brought my axe. 
So -- that is just 
rotten vegetation, mud. 
In winter they have to wear boots.

Cliff does not sell cordwood. 
His corduroy road

He uses a chain saw. 
All of 
it 
is milled by his son 
Steve at -- they didn't use the other corduroy road because it 
was gutted ( the wood around it was stolen) -- we had to clean 
it 
up. 
Mal: so you're planning for the future when you do that right?

-- you just take the good trees. Now we're just constantly 
cutting the butts off because a lot of them are rotten, see. 
You'll see 'em. You'll see the butts layin'

This

over there it's clear cut? 
Cliff: You can only save 'em on the edge. 
MH: What kind of animals do you see 
in the cedar swamp?

in the cedar 
swamp. 
They live off of frogs and fish, and they live -- where 
I've seen 'em mostly 
is 
in cedar trees that's blowed over, 
in the 
stumps or 
in a hollow tree. 
I've walked right up to 
'em and 
picked 'em up. 
You have to get a young one that way. 
And you 
have to be careful cause he'll bite ya.

in these streams. 
They're good eating. 
These streams are pretty small, but there's pike 
in 
'em. 
MH: what's the best way to cook 'em? 
Cliff: I'd say fry 
it, 
same as any other fish. 
MH: Roll 
it 
in batter and crumbs and stuff? foodways 
Cliff: 
Yeah. 
You can see little cedars every way you look. 
I wanted to show you a swamp that was cut off approximately in 
1935, and they didn't have no ecology in mind or no nothing, the 
only thing they were doing was cuttin the cedar, right? 
And 
it 
all 
came back. 
The cedar like this. 
MH: Did they have any tricks? 
Cliff: No, because they knew nature would take its course. 
And -- but when cedar doesn't come back, 
it's too dry. 
Now my 
theory -- just my theory and nobody else's -- 
is 
to keep this 
stream plugged up. 
Plug 
it up with everything you can, and then 
that water will flow through this whole flood plain -- follow me? 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 111 
MH: But how do you keep from getting too much water? 
Cliff: 
Well, naturally the water will drain away -- but 
there 
is such a thing as too much water, but I've never seen 
it. 
Because, this 
is the driest time of year right now, and when you 
have your wet season, say 
in the spring, you'll have water in 
here, say about six inches deep -- in other words, about half as 
high as these stumps, see -- and your little cedars wants to be 
above that elevation. 
Lower than that don't nothing grow because 
the water lays there. 
MH: What about beaver? 
Cliff: there 
is beaver in some places, but we don't have any 
here. 
There 
is beaver in certain areas. 
but they've gotta' have 
more water than this -- there's not enough water here for beaver. 
The stream isn't big enough. 
They do a lot of damage -- they dam 
up the water and kill the trees. 
He's never trapped for beaver, but for coon and muskrat. 
We 
never had many beaver in this area. 
He doesn't trap anymore. 
There are trappers trappin now for fox. 
There's some little 
cedars comin up. See when those needles drop off they'll come up 
through there, but the needles have to come off first. 
They 
won't come up until the needles drop off. 
But it takes about a 
year and a half for those needles to drop off, so 
in another year 
those needles will be dropped off. 
And the little cedars will 
come up -- maybe you can see one comin' up through there now if 
you look good. 
Wherever there's a hassock comin' up-- a high 
place. 
He's not heard of something called the laps. 
Dry moss 
is caked and white at the stream where the water's 
gone down. 
It's a small stream, and that's where Cliff wants to 
plug 
it up. 
Hufford notices the huckleberry brush, and Cliff 
says "You got little trees all 
around it -- everywheres you look 
you'll see them little cedars." 
You'll notice where we cut a lot 
of butts off because they're rotten, see. 
There are some rotten butts. 
We come to the road where the 
slabs are laid on. 
After a while the brush chews up from the 
truck goin' over it, 
and fills 
in the cracks. 
It'll 
last two or 
three years (for working) --
Mal 
comments on the great smell. 
They've taken out thirty six loads since May on this 
crossway. 
10 min. The maple and gum they just leave, along with the 
rotten cedar. The biggest stump is 26 inches 
in diameter. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 112 
6 — 8 inches 
is wide enough for planking for a boat. 
Half of the work in harvesting the cedar is 
in the road. 
Mal: So you stake off the road 
Cliff: I mark the edge so I don't get off of 
it. 
If I get 
off of 
it, 
I'm here forever. 
MH: So do the needles here help the seedlings? 
Cliff: Yes, they do -- until the seedling gets started that 
brush protects it -- for two or three years. 
MH: What from? 
Cliff: From deer, and from I think a lot of things --
weather. 
But it takes two years for those needles to drop off. 
We go to see where he's cutting now. 
It's very springy. 
Cliff: We'll make a woodsman out of you. 
See, I put most of my brush on the road. 
MH: 
If I were a kid I'd be tempted to come back here and 
bounce around. 
Cliff: Sure, you could have some fun. 
We get to the end of the road. 
Cliff: That's the end of 
it. 
Everything has an end. 
Here's 
our next load. 
Mal: You 
let 
it 
lie for a while and then you take the 
branches off? 
Cliff: Take them off whenever we get a chance. 
The slabs are old fence posts that they had lying around at 
home and brought up to stick on the road. 
15 min 
It varies in an area like this (the depth of the 
muck, which he's checking with a pole -- 6 — 10 feet) 
Now that 
log over there is boat lumber -- see that log? 
That's twenty 
four feet. 
He'll saw that up 
in boat lumber. 
It's a log without 
many limbs on 
it. 
Now see that one leaning over there -- that 
might make boat lumber too. 
Maybe up to sixteen feet. 
Most of 
this 
is boat lumber -- at least sixteen feet. 
Mal: so very few knots? 
Cliff: That's right. 
Now the stream runs right along here. 
About thirty feet of 
it -- North Branch of the Forked River --
it's a small stream. 
About a hundred, a hundred fifty feet in 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 113 
from the edge of the swamp is mainly gum and maple. 
Along that 
south edge. 
You can see 
it. 
We're generally in the middle of 
the swamp right now, and we're going right through the middle of 
it. 
But this swamp has been gutted from both sides -- especially 
the north side. 
It's gutted in there a hundred -- hundred fifty 
feet and more. 
Mal: Was this out a while back too? 
Cliff: This was cut at least a hundred years ago. I don't 
know exactly when, but I would say at least a hundred years 
maybe more. 
Mal: 
It's amazing how far up (the trunk) you go before there 
are any branches. 
Cliff: That's due to the thickness of 
it 
(I think he means 
the density of the stand) 
Now there's a tree there that's 
amazing -- maybe you should look at that tree. You see -- those 
two trees came offa one that's been laying down. 
There's 
actually three onto it -- you follow me? 
See that tree that was 
layin' over was blowed over and now there's three or four trees 
onto it. 
Its roots are 
in the crossway. 
We cut one, but there's 
still two left on 
it. 
That's a burl. 
I don't know what causes it. 
They use 
it 
for lamps, and different things. 
Just ornamental 
-- I don't see 
any use for 'em. Now this was all 
thick brush -- we had to cut 
that. 
We try to leave what we can on the outside edge. 
There's 
a few big ones back there -- there's probably twenty inches 
through 'em. 
The only reason they're big 
is because they had 
room to grow. 
Mal: So you got the stream goin' through the swamp then you 
got a couple hundred feet on either side? 
Cliff: We're followin' along the north edge of the stream and 
it's 
in there about thirty — forty feet, bout where that log 
is. 
Not much of a stream. 
This swamp here 
is about 600 feet wide. 
Easy. 
We're about in 
the middle. 
MH: 
How do you measure it? 
Cliff: I just know how wide 
it 
is. 
When you build roads 
across it you gotta know how wide it 
is. So 
it's about three 
hundred feet that way and about three hundred feet that way. 
But 
your main body of cedar is about two hundred feet wide here. So 
we're going right down through the center of 
it. 
But it's quite a process because -- a lot of work to 
it. 
It's not for a city boy. 
MH: When people rob cedar 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 114 
CI i 
ff : They ,lust get the edge of 
it. 
MH: Would they do 
it at night? 
Cliff: What happened, nobody knew who owned this -- I found 
the owners and I bought it from the owners, and I didn't pay 
'em 
much money for it, 
because I didn't even know the owners. 
So 
this J & M Land company, they were foreclosing on 
it at that 
time, but they weren't foreclosing on the owners, they were 
foreclosing on the previous owners. 
In other words, they didn't 
search it down to date and foreclose on the present owners. 
So I 
went to court with them, and I won the case -- and then they 
appealed it, 
and I got a different lawyer, because my 
lawyer had 
died 
in the meantime 
-- so I lost the second time. 
They got me 
on piracy, because I didn't pay enough money for this land. 
A 
lawyer can dig up anything. 
It's strange that you can win a case 
the first time and lose the second time. 
You want to look at a good boat lumber log? 
Take a picture 
of that? 
JC: What is the reddishness on this log? 
Cliff: that's paint -- they're old fence posts we had to get 
rid of. 
We put the poles down and then we fill 
in with slabs 
underneath -- to fill things up. 
Then we put our slabs across 
when we get it 
level, so we don't have any holes under the slabs. 
That way you get a lot of bearing. 
This has been done for years, 
but the average person don't know how to do 
it, because they've 
never seen 
it done. 
MH: Are there directions for how to do 
it written down 
anywhere? 
Cliff: I suppose -- but experience is the best teacher --
it's usually handed down, and it's just like anything else -- I 
think you have to start with it young. 
In other words I wouldn't 
start at 
it at my age now -- I've watched this being done ever 
since I was a kid and that's how I know how to do 
it. 
Mal: Before you put these logs down I see that you've cut 
out quite a bit of stuff trying to make 
it --
Cliff: Oh yeah -- see you gotta cut all 
the trees out --
we'll bring in a load of slabs here and you'll probably get 
thirty feet -- that's all we'll get and then we'll cut out those 
trees and fall 
'em right down on the crossway -- and use the 
brush for here, see, on top of the slabs. And then we'll pick up 
those trees and cut more stumps to keep on going. 
Now the only time you can cut stumps is when it's dry, 
like 
right now. 
Now in a couple months 
you're gonna have so much 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 115 
water you can't do anything here, so we gotta make the road while 
it's dry, and when it's wet, forget about it -- we can't do 
nothin. 
The only thing we can do 
is cut the cedar. 
There might 
be a foot of water around these stumps, and these crossways'II 
practically be floatin'. 
And you can't work 
in water. 
He uses a winch on his truck to drag the trees to the 
crossway, cut 'em up and load 'em onto the truck. These logs 
here'II already be 
loaded. 
The road he enters by comes from the north side of the 
Forked River Mountains. (elevation 187 feet) 
I was gonna bring the axe and cut one of these trees down so 
you could see how I cut it by hand -- that's the old way, but I 
can do 
it. 
Mal: Are there parts of the year you don't work? 
Cliff: I work all 
year round. 
Mal: How far do you figure you have to get that road 
in 
in 
the next couple of months in order to keep on working? 
Cliff: I should get it 
in another fifty feet anyway, 
in 
order to work the winter, because we've got several 
loads on the 
side, and I'd like to get in another fifty feet before it gets 
wet -- in other words, keep the road ahead of what I'm doin'. 
you get behind then you're in trouble. 
You gotta work your 
weather, you gotta work your seasons. 
JC: 
(snapping away) 
Gotta get you between chews -- are you 
chewin' tobacco or gum? 
Cliff: No, 
I'm chewin' gum. 
JC: I thought you were an ex—baseball player or somethin 
Cliff: I'm tryin to keep my teeth. 
I should have all 
my 
teeth, but I had two pulled.

Cliff: If you cut this tree out of here, this (other) tree 
would grow -- but until 
it's dead or cut out -- this cedar should 
be thinned, but you figure a way to do 
it profitably -- you can't 
do 
it. How would you get the cedar out after you've thinned it? 
Say you've got a mixture of maple and gum -- I come in here and 
cut all 
the maple and gum out, because your cedar is the money 
tree -- I used twenty tanks of gas 
in my other swamp just cuttin' 
out the maple and gum, and leavin' 
it right there. 
And we're 
talkin' about fifty cords of wood -- because it 
isn't profitable 
to get it out. 
The reason I done 
it was to save the cedars so 
they'd grow, because that's your money tree. 
The maple and gum 
is your junk tree. wood processing 
The maple and gum takes up so much room. 
They got a big top 
in 
'em, and they take up three times more room than a cedar. 
That maple 
is twenty feet across the top of 
it, 
and the cedar is 
just five feet, maybe eight. 
But a maple will take up two or 
three times more than the cedar -- so what you're trying to 
protect is your money tree, because you're in the lumber 
business, right? 
The maple and gum just rot. 
There's no maple and gum right 
here, but you move over here a hundred feet and you got plenty of 
i 
t. 
O'Connor--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 117 
MH: How come? 
Cliff: It's just nature -- certain places you got certain 
kinda trees, so 
it's just natural for the maple and the gum and 
the cedar all 
to grow together -- that's nature -- so what I'm 
tryin to do 
is get the cedar to grow here, and I'm cuttin' all 
the 
maple and gum out because 
if I left it the cedar wouldn't come 
back, because there would be too much shade for the cedar to 
grow. 
What I've gotta do 
is get all the sunlight in here that's 
possible for the cedar to come back. 
JC: What was here before the cedar? 
Cliff: Believe it or not, there was pine. 
That's hard to 
believe. 
Now how I know that, cuttin' these stumps off, some of 
'em are pine. 
Now how do you figure it? 
Somebody knows, but I 
don't. 
MH: Maybe it would be on an old map? 
Cliff: No. 
It just proves to me that this was a drier area 
at one time. 
Mal: Maybe that stream wasn't going 
in that direction 
Cliff: Because a pine won't go where it's wet -- some of 
these stumps are pine. 
I can't figure it out. We're only here 
for a short period of time, and we don't know nothin'. 
Where Cliff has thinned the maple and gum out the trees grow 
twice as fast. "You can just put your arms around them. 
Because 
they're spaced -- they got room to grow. 
Now what I did, I cut 
the maple and gum that was within ten or fifteen feet of a cedar 
tree. But further than fifteen feet I left 'em grow, because you 
can't thin too much -- 
if you left 'em go 
it would blow down. 
You gotta leave -- you gotta be careful 
in thinning. 
If you thin 
too much the wind'II get in there and blow everything down. 
So 
you just thin out what you think you can do. 
He's never been 
in a cypress swamp. 
This is similar to 
cypress. 
Cypress actually grows right in water. 
"Actually these 
grow right in water too. 
If you was here in the rainy season --
like 
in April -- where I'm standin' I'd be gettin' my feet wet. 
This would be more or less floatin'. 
The water level 
roughly 
speaking would be up as high as in here -- about half the stump. 
But it seems as though you need the water to grow these cedars. 
You got a wet season, a dry season, and you need the water to 
hold 
it over for the dry season. 
And my theory is not to have a 
stream that runs right off because you need this water for these 
trees. 
Now they tell me that a tree uses about fifty gallons of 
water a day. Now maybe you can correct me on that, I don't know. 
Cliff: See -- 
if you got trees, you got a watershed --
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 118 
you're holdin' water right here -- 
if you don't have no trees it 
just runs off -- just like down in Arizona now -- the floods is 
runnin right off -- there's nothin' there to hold the water -- 
it 
just runs off, 
like on a blacktop road. 
These trees are actually 
holding the water right here. 
MH: I can't believe the way they sway. 
Cliff: I can show you a swamp that's probably twice as old 
as this and you can just reach around some of them trees --
they're two foot, you know -- it should be cut. 
But I have a 
time limit on this because they can buy this back 
in 
1984, so 
if 
I don't get the cedar off I'm a loser. 
See, he's 
in the real 
estate business, and 
if 
he has a buyer he can buy 
it back from me 
and resell 
it. 
JC: 
Do you have any indication if he's gonna do that? 
Cliff: I don't know, but when he does he ain't gonna have no 
cedar. 
He probably won't, because he probably won't be able to 
sell 
it, 
except for a huntin' camp or somethin' 
like that. 
But Tom 
Brown says he wants it. 
MH: Would you mind sellin' 
it to Tom Brown? 
Cliff: If I can get my money out of 
it, I don't mind, cause 
I got the cedar. 
(He identifies a bird that was calling as a bluejay) 
8 min 
(wind 
is bad) 
There's a couple layin' 
lengthwise that 
was blowed over. 
That's boat lumber. He'll get 24 feet out of 
that. 
Mal: flow 
long are the boats? 
Cliff: Usually twenty to twenty four feet. 
See that's been 
blown over on account of the water eroded the roots out, see. 
They won't take the wood with knots in 
it, 
even though 
they'd just have to plug up the holes -- "they fiberglass it 
anyway." 
MH: Joe Reid and Sam Hunt have their customers spoiled it 
sounds like. 
Cliff: (laughs) Oh yeah, they're just spoiled brats. 
See there's four little gums right there, but eventually the 
cedar will kill that out. 
My theory is to get this all 
to come 
back 
in cedar. For my sons kids, I guess or somebody else's. 
Points out an odd tree. 
It's short, and pretty, and 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 119 
gnarled. 
MH: 
It looks like 
it's trying to sit down. 
Do you think 
it's just lazy? 
Cliff: 
No -- it growed that way -- up and across -- you 
could sit onto it. 
These should be bigger, you know. 
What it 
amounts to, the trees that have more room to grow are bigger 
trees. 
In here where they're competin' they're smaller because 
they have no room to grow. 
12 min 
Where the wood was stolen they carried the smaller 
stuff out, and made more room. 
"So they really done me a favor 
when they took out the smaller trees." 
My theory is 
it'll 
all 
come back 
in cedar, and I'm positive it will, because what we've 
cut already in the 
last three years is 
all 
reseeded -- the whole 
thing 
I got another crossway that's over a year old -- up above --
that old crossway about where them cedars are, them draggers --
and that's from there on up, and that must be a thousand feet 
long, that crossway. 
It grows up by that clump of cedar up 
there, and then comes out the bank. 
And then from there on out 
it forks into two branches -- Cave Cabin Branch and Long Branch. 
So this 
is 
the end of North Branch, and then 
it becomes two 
branches. 
That's where they fork out. 
This road'II flatten out after you've gone over it four or 
five times -- it'll flatten right out. 
You gotta keep the butt 
toward the edge. 
It's all open underneath. 
We're very 
particular about cuttin' brush -- I cut it all -- every bit of 
it 
-- 
in other words, the little cedar has a fightin' chance, whereas 
if you leave the brush 
it don't -- it might come back in brush. 
He cuts the brush with a chain saw. 
Cliff identifies the sounds of a crow, a bluejay, -- there's 
frogs all 
through here, plenty of 
'em. 
Sometimes you hear 'em 
all 
the time. 
They live right in amongst these stumps --
I'd rather have bigger cedar, but you can't always get what 
you want. 
The huckleberries: 
several different kinds -- at least 
fifteen or twenty. 
18 min 
We're walking through the brush. 
We're at the 
junction of Cave Cabin and Long Branches. 
Cliff 
is keeping the 
water in for the trees. 
That's his theory. 
We're at Estlow's Crossway. 
The water lays there, and where 
the water lays, there won't nothin grow -- brush or nothin else. 
So 
it's settled. 
O'Connor--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 120 
He says most people who hunt around there know it as 
Estlow's Crossway. 
You gotta leave some gum and maple, because, how much can 
you do, you know what I mean? 
We cut twice as much as we 
should've, I think, because 
a lot of 
it we didn't get the cedar 
off of, 
we just cut the junk wood, and hopefully it will 
reseed. 
So I think this area will 
be twice as big as 
it was when we came 
here, because I made 
it bigger, so 
it'll 
reseed. 
We hear something he 
identifies as as robin. 
"Some kinds of 
robin will stay here all 
year round 
in these swamps, because it's 
warm. 
What they feed on mainly is the holly berries. 
(break in the tape) 
Cliff talking about navy experiences. 
"The first ship I was 
on was torpedoed. 
I met a friend from Sea Isle City and he 
invited me down. 
He has a dragger that he 
-- he's a commercial 
fisherman. 
It's a 65 footer and he has a store and he sells what 
he catches. 
I went out on that, 
it wasn't too bad of a day --
wind was about 15 miles an hour -- I got seasick, because I'm not 
used to that motion. 
Now when I was in the navy it didn't bother 
me at all. 
When you're not used to something you're gonna get 
sick. 
And a small boat has a different motion than a big boat. 
A big boat has a long motion, you know. 
In the Pacific the waves 
are maybe a thousand feet long. 
Like going up a mountain, some 
of waves are so big. 
Especially in the (humble?) current between 
the Aleutians and Japan. 
Then you get up the top of 
it and you 
slide down the other side of 
it. 
It's not a wind wave, 
it's a 
current wave. 
Until you see 
it, 
you wouldn't believe that there 
was anything that big. 
You felt just like you was on a chip out 
in the middle of the ocean -- that's how big the ship seemed to 
be. 
The reason we took that route 
is that we gained a half a day 
travelling from Japan to the United States. 
Usually takes 12 
days, we made it 
in 
11 
and a half. 
On Barnegat Bay it's a wind sea. 
A current sea is 
like a 
huge swell, and that could be as much as a thousand feet long or 
longer -- the wind has nothin' to do with it -- the current does 
that. 
You wouldn't believe it until you see 
it, 
that anything 
could be that size. 
It's unbelievable until you seen 
it. 
You 
chalk 
it up to experience. 
I was 
in the navy for three years and 
that was one of the most amazing things I ever seen. 
Another thing that I seen out there was 
in the Aleutian 
Islands. 
This cone shaped mountain from out in the ocean, with 
no base on 
it. 
Come out like an 
ice—cream cone, and the top 
third of 
it was 
in the clouds. 
Can you imagine that? 
MH: How could you tell 
it was the top third?

Cliff: you couldn't see 
it -- it was almost like a sheer 
(gestures) like that 
(so the distance the slope would have to go 
to make the point would be fully a third of the distance visible 
between the clouds and the sea) 
It was almost like a volcano, 
but there was no base on 
it. Now how far that went into the 
ocean, who knows -- it come right up out of the ocean and the top 
of 
it was 
in the clouds 
In the Bowman Islands (?) near Iwo Jima.

PFP83-RM0023 are accidentally out of order, but there's so 
little

it doesn't matter) G-Forked River; 48GT 
We're preparing to walk into another swamp. 
Cliff: In this swamp, some of 
it has been stolen where it 
was handy -- 
in the fifties is when 
it was stolen. 
They operated 
from the edge of the bank here, because they didn't have time to 
build a road. 
Now see fire killed that -- (might have been the 
'62 fire or 
before) 
Notices some tracks. 
"Some nice-sized bucks been 
in here. 
They browse right alongside of us. 
I've seen them come within a 
hundred feet of us. Come right up to us. 
They know we're not 
after 'em, you know." 
Now you see lightnin's hit that tree. 
Usually at an elevation between a low and a high. (the wind 
is bad here, for several minutes, and Cliff 
is distant) 
5 min 
- 20 min 
nothing on the tape (it got snarled up)
