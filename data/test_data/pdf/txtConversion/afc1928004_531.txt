Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1880, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at 
Washington, D. C.-
Messrs James O'Neil and John H. Conroy are two of 
the most funniest Comedians now before the public. 
Every 
Theatre they appear at they are re-engaged to return for 
several times during the season. 
J 
is plain to be seen that 
the above named artists are gentlemen of merit, and origi-
nators of all their own Songs, Acts and Sketches. 
Their 
style and make up is the signal for roars of laughter 
applause. 
They played their first engagement together at 
Harry Miner's Theatre, New Ycrk City, and made such 
a 
hit that they were re-engaged to play several engagements 
at an advanced salary. 
Their next success was at Dick 
Parker's American Theatre; then to Volk's Variety 
Theatre. 
Then they played at the Novelty Theatre, 
where they made such a 
decided hit that the people roared 
with aching sides at the mirth provoking Jolly Irish 
Sports. 
The manager of the New National Theatre 
seeing them, engaged them at sight for his New Theatre. 
They are the Long Looked For Found at Last, and will 
endeavor to keep up the fame they have gained. 
They 
are about to make a tour through the Western Cities, 
where I 
am sure they will be a 
success. 
Very truly yours, 
(The Editop),

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Cnonus; 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the, band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
Chorus. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

BOSTON HARRY." 
Written, eumposed and sung by J. H. Commy, of O'NEIL S
.: CONROY, 
Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm a 
fellow who's fond of pleasure, 
No matter where I 
roam; 
At my hours of pleasure, 
I 
make myself at home; 
Oh, give to me the outside sport, 
On the fields I 
love to tarry; 
The boys around the parks, call me 
Pretty Boston Harry. 
Cuonts: 
Oh ta-ta ta, oh, ta-ta ta, 
Wherever I 
may go; 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Boston Harry, oh; 
Oh ta-ta, ta, oh ta-ta, ta, 
Wherever I 
may look; 
I 
always wear the best costume, 
Of any of the boys of the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Josey that's her name; 
In the summer- time, 
On the lawn we play the croquet game; 
Oh, do I 
not admire it; 
My chance I 
would not miss, 
Before my darling parts with me; 
On her lips I 
imprint a 
kiss. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, & c., & c. 
One evening while out strolling, 
Just for a 
short lark; 
My Pet and I 
went wandering, 
Around in Central Park; 
While gazing at the fountain, 
We met a 
crazy loon, 
Who asked us to take a 
walk with him, 
To visit a 
babboon. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, &c., &c.

THE HUNGRY BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written by JAMES INIcAvoy for O'NEIL and CONROY, Vocalists, 
Comedians and Sketch Artists. 
In a 
Broadway house, across the street, 
Where all the hungry boarders eat, 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To make short work of their soup and hash. 
At nine o'clock they slip out of bed, 
And fly down stairs for to be fed; 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
C1101tUS: 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat— 
Pass no remarks about the meat— 
Just keep mum and close your mouth 
In the hungry' starving boarding house. 
The cooks they sleep on the second floor, 
With a 
padlock hitched on every door, 
So the hungry boarders can't get in. 
Where was Moses when they douced the glim ? 
They make them sleep up in the attic, 
And all night long they raise a 
racket ; 
They gave the chambermaid the run, 
And chased her out with a 
Gatling gun. 
.Nobody knows, etc 
A week ago a 
boarder skipped, 
Faith, out of the window he fired his grip; 
He lowered his trunk down with a 
rope, 
And then for a 
freight train he did slope; 
Next morning when they called the roll 
The landlord blessed his darling soul; 
His daughter she squealed out, " Oh laws! 
He's given us the finger for three weeks board."

SINGING ON THE ROOF.

There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried. 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHORUS: 
Singing on the roof,- the boys and girls together. 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
-With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door, 
"Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
"It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And till the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. 
Singing, etc. 
BRANNIGAN'S PUP. 
Sung by JAMES ()' NEIL and JOHN CONROY with great sneeoss 
Now old Mickey Brannigan had a 
bull pup, 
He was bred of rale elegant stock; 
For seventeen hours a 
battle he fought, 
lie did, by my soul, by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged and two crooked eyes; 
One look at his ugly looking mug was enough. 
He was the (Evil himself in disguise. 
CHORUS: 
Bow-ow-ow-, 
what a 
pup to be sure, 
For fighting he'd never give up; 
There never was known such a 
wonderful dog 
As Mickey BranniE.,
,-an's pup. 
He tore the tail off Maloney's best coat, 
Ate the bustle of Mary Ann Flynn; 
And run between young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin. 
He caught tip the Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered Tim Finnegan's beautiful goat, 
Ate the tail off McManus cat. 
130W -OW -OW. CL 
An Italian came round with an organ one day. 
And a 
monkey tied fast to a 
string; 
And when the pup saw them he yowled with delight.. 
And made a 
most wonderful spring. 
He upset monkey, grinder and all, 
And bursted the organ inside; 
And be jabers he tried to swallow the monk, 
But he choked on his tail and he died. 
Bow-ow- ow, etc. 
Sung by O'NEIL, ct CONROY. Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch 
Artists, with great success.

Oh my name is Gilhooly Cornelius Gilh000ly, 
I 
live on the 1st Avenue; 
I'm a 
hard working man from the dear Irish land, 
With a 
heart that is honest and true; 
Every night just before I 
lay down to my rest, 
I 
call to my wife " ducky" dear; 
Bun around to Maguire's, it's now I 
desire, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
CHORUS: 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer, Mollie. 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer; 
Whem I'm dry it will fill me with cheer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Then we sit down together and talk of the weather, 
And tell the events of the day; 
When the pitcher is empty, we fill it again, 
And in pleasure the night flies away; 
The place where we live is a 
fine Irish flat, 
And our neighbors are full of good cheer; 
If you want to be happy, ,just come and imbibe, 
From the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
You may talk of your wines with their high sounding 
names, 
Whisky Punches and Hot Spicy Rum; 
But the Beer is the stuff, and it's quite good enough, 
For your Senses it can't overcome; 
If my friends call around, they'll have pleasure and 
fun, 
On a 
Christmas or happy New Year; 
We'll brin7. out Glass Goblets and off I 
will go, 
For the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer.

JAMES O'
NEIL'S 
PARODY ON 
Grandmother's Chair. 
Revised and sung by JAMES O'NEIL & Jons CONROY. in all the 
leading Variety Theatres in the United States. 
My Grandfather he, at the age of 1,000 and 3, 
e 
worked upon a 
farm catching bees; 
It was him discovered pie, and he had a 
leather eye, 
And his necktie was a 
boarding house for fleas; 
His lungs was made of wood, and be never was any 
good, 
He could walk upon the water and never sink; 
His nose was very long, and his breath was very strong, 
He'd chew up porous plasters, soap and ink. 
C
HORUS: 
But now he has departed, he bought a 
pair of wings to fly, 
Now he's painting clouds and frescoing the sky; 
he'd never refuse a 
drink, and he always had blues, 
And when he died he left Dr. Tanner his old pair of shoes. 
When he grew up to be a 
man, he had five toes upon 
each hand, 
And he married a 
girl called Arrabella Green; 
They were married just one year, and don't you think 
it queer, 
They had a 
family the finest ever seen; 
While smoking a 
clay pipe, his eldest boy named Mike, 
Was playing with a 
puzzle made of blocks; 
When seven million dollars and 3,000 paper collars, 
Fell out of my Grandfather's socks. 
(Chorus). 
He was never known to eat, he had 14 set of teeth, 
And he never wore pants in all his life; 
He was crossed in his thumbs, lie had whiskers on his 
gums, 
And with ice cream he tried to choke his wife; 
One day he pawned his eye for to buy some rock and rye, 
lie got wrestling with a 
brick and broke his head; 
He slept upon a 
box, he never changed his socks, 
And now I'm told the poor old man is dead. 
(Chorus). 
11 
IRISH SWELLS. 
Written, composed and sung by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Here we are two Irish swells, 
We're gentlemen of fashion; 
The ladies most devoted slaves, 
We're full of tender passion; 
Our hands with toil we never soil, 
And every care we shun; 
The girls, they think the world of us, 
We give them lots of fun. 
Cnonus: 
We are two Irish swells, 
We're festive, and we're gay; 
At home we are the darlings; 
We promenade every day; 
We mash 5th Avenue bells, 
We're the ladies pets, 
And don't forget, 
We are two Irish swells. 
We cultivate a 
lofty style, 
And drive our horse and carriage; 
Although we flirt with all the girls, 
We never think of marriage; 
We always attend society balls, 
They always treat us well; 
We're never broke, we've plenty of cash, 
We are the two Irish swells. 
We are the two Irish Swells, 8r,c,.

Last Winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilly, did you say? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel, and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ali, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
CHORUS: 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, 
New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done a 
crying, 
No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why- didn't they stay at 
home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in Summer time and sworn for to 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
MeGUINESS GETS A ,T011.—CoNTIN -
2ED. 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do 
get lush: 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
And that's one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, vi
e, 
Ali! the Spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
\vork, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand 
some clerk. 
You shoubl se. him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, IIi there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop; 
Ali! the old niln he is always careful, nothing he let's 
fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at all. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc.

There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHOItUS: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A victim, I 
was quickly led along,

THE ITALIAN GIRL—CoyrucuED. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not ha ve permitted me to live. 
(('horus). 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
117113r;., I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his hand, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while th3 tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
I 
bid her then to fly -with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Tier duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, 
That girl for whom my heart will ever yearn. 
(Chorus). 
THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DixoN at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drown-ecl, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh. God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
lines.) 
Cuottus: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
lie battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and .sung by O'NEIL k CONROY, 
Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
Oh, let you stand from under now, and open wide your ears, 
While I 
relate the story of the Sligo :\ lusketeers; 
For when we landed on this soil, out West they made us go, 
For to work at canalinir, in the State of Oh—ho—ho. 
But when the war it d'd break out, the:: took our jobs away, 
So we organized a 
company, and started for the fray. 
We 
fought the wild red indian, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they couldn't beat the Sli!ro Musketeers. 
Ctionus: 
With a 
my ha-ha, hay foot straw, 
We marched across the plain for many a 
weary day, 
We thought we ne'erd see home again; 
The indians fought like blazes, 
But their fighting was in vain, 
For they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought for Banks and Burnside, with Grant we took a 
[hack, 
But best of all, though he was small, was gallant little Mac; 
If they'd let him have his way, the enemy he'd drive back, 
With the assistance of the Sligo Musketeers. 
For he knew- how to engineer, and likewise to command, 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse, when he was in command 
Of us Irish boys, the Sligo Musketeers.

THE GREAT IRISHMEN OF THE PAST. 
Written by the greatest of all European Vocalists, PAT FEENEY. 
First sung in the United States and made popular by Mr. JOHN 
CONROY, Irish Vocalist and Comedian, of O'NEIL 8c. CONROY. 
Copyrighted, 1850, by JOHN CONROY. 
YOU .VC heard of the heroes of far famed old England, 
That fought for their country on land and on wave, 
And bards of famed Scotland have sung songs and praises, 
And many brave sons that are laid in the grave; 
But I 
as an Irishman now sing in praise 
Of Erin's bold sons whose fame ever will last; 
From the days of bold Byron, the king of old Ireland, 
We have had many brave Irishmen of the past. 
There's Curran the lawyer, a 
son of old Erin, 
Whose sayings and doings are known fa 
i• and wide, 
I 
Us wit and his elegant manner of speaking 
Won many foes over as friends, to his side; 
There's Tom .) Ioore the poet, all Irishmen love him. 
His work with the greatest on earth might be classed; 
Whilst an Irishman lives those two names they'll re-
member, 
As two of the great Irishmen of the past. 
There are scores of great speakers whom I 
could now 
mention. 
But foremost is Burke, who is well known to fame. 
His great nine days' speech was more than nine days' 
wonder-

THE GREAT IRISHMEN OF THE PAST.— CONTINUED. 
All men should respect that great Irishman's name. 
There is Goldsmith, well known as an elegant writer, 
And Dean Swift, the great wit, though they call the 
style fast; 
And bold Isaao Butt, who has lately passed from us, 
All these have proved great Irishmen of the past. 
Lord Wellington he was a 
son of old Erin, 
And a 
credit I'm sure to the land of his birth, 
As a 
true-hearted man and a 
prince of all soldiers, 
All England knows well that great Irishman's worth; 
It was him that first conquered the mighty Napoleon, 
He feared not the foe nor the winter's cold blast, 
And as things stand at present old England could do with 
Some more like the great Irishmen of the past. 
. 
The greatest of Irishmen now I 
will mention; 
O'Connell the patriot it is that I 
mean, 
His life he spent struggling for old Ireland's freedom, 
And the good of the dear little Island of green; 
For wit and for eloquence none could approach him, 
His name and his fame through all ages will last. 
Every true Irish heart loves the name of O'Connell, 
The greatest of great Irishmen of the past.

I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not done it yet ; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler ' I often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim; 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
tight ; 
A Dutchman, a 
Scotehman, a 
Frenchman anti a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly got plugged with a 
brick. 
CUORUS: 
Nobody knows what. trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry :jumped up, struck out with his hand, 
And swore he could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John -Monahan standing in the door, 
lie caught hold of McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
lie went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
lie looked as if he slept with the pigs all night 
Ile looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
And then he flew for Monahan and chewed oil' his ear; 
lie made one brace and landed at the bar, 
Ile called for it hummer, and they gave him a 
cigar; 
lie took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
it was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set lire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all etune down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every fighting gossoon; 
Six months On the Island sure they all have to stay, 
For setting tire to the house on St. Patrick's Day,

Eileen, sweet Eileen, oh cruel the fate, 
Sweet maiden, that tore us apart; 
Sadly I 
watch for you, early and late, 
Come back to me, star of my heart; 
No one can love you so fondly as 
Or no one so faithful can be; 
Life I 
would give for a 
glance of your eye, 
Olt come back my darling to me. 
CHORUS: 
No one can love you so fondly as I, 
Or no one so faithful can be; 
Life I 
would give for a 
glance of your eye, 
Oh come back my darling to me. 
Cruel the parents that caused its to part, 
Sweet Eileen, because I 
was poor; 
But richer than gold was the love of my heart, 
And brighter than jewels, asthore; 
Do not forget me, my darling Eileen, 
In that far off land of the free; 
Faithful and true to your memory 
been, 
Oh come back sweet Eileen to me.

VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
Words and Music by W ILL II. 
Fox. 
Sung by Wm. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by 0 NEIL S: CONROY. - 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

To see my darling smile.

Pretty little Mary, standing at the bar, 
Mary, Mary, you are my guiding star; 
I 
always think about you whether near or far, 
Mary, Mary, standing at the bar. 
Oh, don't I

For she's named the happy time, 
I'm sure I

When Mary she is mine: 
I

That she became my wife, 
We'll try and jog along together, 
Devoid of care and strife.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought. me down to the dock you know,

They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

Go over-hand says brother Jim. 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I

Oh I " chaw roast- beet, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out te me ; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
: made back dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a

For two long hours or more.

I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I

I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
V 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
- And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleel. • 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, Sze.

She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a

She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.i comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine.

And try and win the stove.

'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so

Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At niue o'clock precisely 
The raffling it bcgun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
botLe, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. -

Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I

You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you,

When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me ? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha!

At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls. 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my eoderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
nut if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of his legs.

My name is McNamara, 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
0110111:S. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, 
I 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through the streets from day to day, 
And I 
went from place to place, 
With starvation in my face, 
HONEST IRISH LAD.

When 1 
ask for work they want no help, they say. 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I would find one, 
Who would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
(Chorus.) 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam, 
. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try anti do the very best I 
can, 
AndrGOd will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man

About three years ag) in the middle of next June, 
That a

And we elected all the officers midst a 
terrible hubbub, 
And McGowan was elected Treasurer pro tem. 
We came to the conclusion we'd go bobbing after eels, 
Aml fur fear we'd get the cramps we took along a 
keg of nails, 
We started very early so as we'd not start late, 
And we had a 
gallon demijohn marked B-A-T-E, 
On the night that we went bobbirg after eels. 
When we got near the place where we were going to bob, 
We pushed the boat about a 
mile up to our necks in mud, 
Devlin ., ot excited and McCue was going to shoot, 
B cause he had the gall to make an eel- trap of his boot. 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels.

INIcourly, the comic singer, he wanted to vocalize, 
But we hesee.fied him to desist for us he'd paralyze. 
But when he got about half full he started Pinafore, 
And they threw him over the side of the boat and I 
never see 
him more. 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got tired of bobbing it was near the bre ik of day

And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds. 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You cat1 then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life. 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
l'he old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at hor:1,-. 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair. 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair ? 
And how they titter'd, & e.

And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a

Then to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

Ireland's Freedom. 
First sung on any stage by M YLES M ORRIS, the great patriotic vocalist. 
Dedicated to the Irish member of Parliament, M R. CHARLES STEWART 
PARNELL. 
Hurrah for Parnell and the cause be advances ! 
The heart of old Ireland once more is aglow; 
The troubles we meet with the end but enhances 
We're nearing the goal, boys, ah, surely if slow. 
Freedom ! see how it shines ! Slavery once more declines, 
The rainbow of hope illumines the sky, 
On our loved native ground, can cravens there be `build, 
To shrink from the fight when our aim is so high ? 
CHORUS. 
Freedom ! see how it shines ! Slavery oncc more declines, 
The rainbow of home illumines the sky ! 
On our lov'd native ground can cravens there be found 
To shrink from the fight when our aim is so high. 
Steadily, still, like the waves of the ocean, 
We seek what our fathers were robbed of of yore: 
on the altar of Ireland we've pledged our devotion, 
And sworn that as slaves we'll be ruled, boys, no more. 
Look at our present plight, caused by the English blight, 
Starving our peasantry here on our plains; 
Sorrows around them cling, wailings but from them spring, 
Deadened their voice in the clank of their chains, 
CHORUS. 
Look at our present plight, caused by the English blight, 
Starving our peasantry here on our plains; 
IRELAND'S FREEDOM. 
Continued. 
Sorrows around them cling, wailings but from them spring. 
Deadened their voice in the clank of their chains. 
Up for the cause boys ! the tocsin is sounding; 
The curse that divided and weakened has fled : 
See into life and full vigor is bounding 
The body they thought, boys, stark, stiffened and dead! 
See o'er the waves appear, resplendent, calm, and clear, 
Liberty's sun, that they hid from our sight, 
Vainly their hate pursued, God with fresh strength imbued— 
Still on our side have we honor and right. 
CHORUS. 
See o'er the waves appear, resplendent, calm, and clear, 
Liberty's sun, that they hid from our sight; 
Vainly their hate pursued, God with fresh strength imbued, 
Still on our side have we honor and right. 
Blest be each name that the holy war wages ! 
Who could the shrine of his country profane? 
The dreams of our patriots, poets, and sages, 
Is left to their sons to uphold and maintain. 
Come, then, as brothers forth, West, East, South, and Nort .', 
Join in our serried ranks, the vanguard come swell; 
Raise the old cry again, shout it from mount and glen, 
God and our country !— Hurrah for Parnell !

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day ; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as vet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain : 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your laddie once again : 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
in lands far away she doth roam ; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love ; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
'When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Come to your laddie once again ; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine.

You may think that I 
am mad, but I 
only do feel sad, 
And the reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
Courtei I 
a 
nice young girl, and her name was Peggy Doyle. 
And I 
h)ok her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, and she weighs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all the while; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she would never go to 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isle: 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more. 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave their hats, 
And shouted float her Pat, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reahed the pier, we went and had some 
beer, 
And after that we went to have a 
bathe. 
You may talk about the fat woman that travels with Bar-
num's show, 
But you'd ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom was on fire, 
And Some (It them gave me a. grand hurrah ! 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth 
Be heavens shouted out, there's one of the lions 
That escaped the other day. 
Chorus. 
Now of course I 
did feel mad after listening to that lad. 
A ad I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York, up near the Central Park, 
You can bet that I 
w( add break his heart. 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter. 
But I 
alw ys take my own part all the while; 
Arrah muslin! oad luck to Peg, 
May she lose one of lit,: legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island. 
The Order of Old Bums. 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you 
drink? 
to me—then your eye you 
grip— password— What dye 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Bums" are on the Nvar-path laving, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs -vhy then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and cloths. I 
suppose. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
hums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the burn is then a 
holster, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
\\That d'ye say.

PADDY'S LAND, 
Composed by Jonsxv ROACH. 
COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam. 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home. 
Be sure you're \veil provided with comrades bold and true, 
'ior you have to fight both day and night 'gainst John Bull awl 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the lan,1 I

May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home lot Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on hoard the boat, we gave three hearty cheers. 
Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'ek' 
may see it more, 
For we're going to light both day and night, all for that sham. 
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, 
C. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne .er received a 
shock. 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh clear the track !" were the words that 
Passed all round. 
Then hurrah, 8,:c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each tad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
grows.

Then hurrah, tic, 
The Two McMullens. 
Originat words and music by JoHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by Ali

We are the two McMullens, 
As ye all do know, 
A 
little Irish dancing 
To ye we're going to show. 
We landed in this country 
Just fifteen years ago, 
And for making money 
You bet we are not slow. 
CHORUS. 
It was in the garden I 
met you, darling, 
Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Harney, 
Just twenty years ago. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell, 
And of us two McMullens 
We hope you will speak well. 
We have to toil and labor 
Our apples for to sell, 
And when he gets elected 
To you he'll quickly tell. 
It was in the garden, &c.

When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a 
drame ; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a Izamblin man, poker 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, & c. 
My Mary Anne's a (lancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi: 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Anne. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary 4,nne. 
She's a 
darling, & c.

THE CANDIDATE FOR ALDERMAN. 
An original Irish Comic Song as written and sung by JAMES 
O'NEIL the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist wii-h tremendous 
success, at the various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and 1
.
11 ne'er deny the same, 
I 
took a 
notion to cross the ocean, to America, I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to tight, both day and night, for the Red. White 
and the Blue. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes, for me on Election day. 
When I 
started tirst in Politics, my friends C•ey were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that 1 
was too -brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
He was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a 
big ash- cart. 
I 
am your candidate. & c. 
So now my friends I 
must be off. I 
can II') longer stay. 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote, for me on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry. for I 
am the poor-
man's 
friend. 
I 
am your _candidate, & c.

American Fortune-Teiling, Crrtis.—This is thetold.,

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10.

are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

<lour! iseg Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e, way as to be non-coinmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
TAlemen who are either too dill]. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which min-ht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the difil-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not bo 
adopted nr the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

ILIMPTY D:1 14 Fri', 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so vstematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been seat us, called IitympTy DUMPTY,' and bound 
in sn,.11 a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing. but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
