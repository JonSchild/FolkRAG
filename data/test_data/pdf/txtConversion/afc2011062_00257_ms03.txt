John Ryan Photographs 
Iron Workers Documentation Project 
 
All photographs here, except for #20 below taken by Bucky Halker, belonged to Ryan, so 
the images here are either photographs of photographs or scans of photographs.  For that 
reason, not all the photographs are of the highest quality.

1) John Ryan standing at the top of the Sear Tower in 1974.   Notice Lake Michigan in the 
background, as well as the Chicago River, the Marina Towers, and other landmark iron 
worker buildings.  
2) John Ryan photograph from the rim of the Sears Tower in 1973 or 1974.  Notice the Chicago 
River to the northwest and Lake Michigan in the far north.   
3) John Ryan looking over the edge of the Sears Tower in 1973 or 1974. 
4) John Ryan hanging over the edge of the Hancock Building in 1968.   Lake Michigan, Navy 
Pier, and Lake Point Tower (tall black building) appear in the background.   Notice that 
Ryan is not tied off, is wearing shorts, and doesn’t even have on steel-toe boots.  Ryan told 
interviewer Bucky Halker that he was not even working at the site.  Rather he was working 
nearby and wanted his picture taken so he walked over, rode to the top, and walked out on 
the beam.   Obviously, security was not a key concern in 1968. 
5) Calder sculpture “The Flamingo” in the Sears Tower.  John Ryan and other ironworkers 
from Local #63 helped install the sculpture.  
6) Decorative spiral stairs built by John Ryan and iron workers in Local #63 at McClurg Court 
in Chicago in 1971.  
7) Skeleton for top of renovated and rebuilt Navy Pier.   Ironworkers constructed the “bones” 
from the architectural plans and then installed it as well.   The Pier was redesigned and 
rebuilt in the 1990s. 
8) Skeleton for top of renovated and rebuilt Navy Pier.   Ironworkers constructed the “bones” 
from the architectural plans and then installed it as well.   The Pier was redesigned and 
rebuilt in the 1990s.  Lake Point Tower appears in the background on the right.  
9) Skeleton for top of renovated and rebuilt Navy Pier.   Ironworkers constructed the “bones” 
from the architectural plans and then installed it as well.   The Pier was redesigned and 
rebuilt in the 1990s.  The Ferris Wheel appears in the background here.   
10)  UBS Building in downtown Chicago, a building project that Ryan and many other    
Chicago iron workers worked on from 1999-2002. 
11)  UBC decorative top in 2001 or 2002.  John Ryan and many other iron workers  found 
employment on this building.   The iron workers here are unidentified.  Notice the harness-
style tie off these workers are wearing (yellow on lower workers).  The safety regulations 
had changed drastically since Ryan’s photo on the Hancock Building in 1968. 
12) John Ryan’s son, also a member of IWU Local #63 on the UBS Building, 2001- or 2002.  
Many ironworkers come from second, third, and fourth generation iron workers.  
13)  Ironworkers installing windows on the UBS Building.   From the 1950s onward, 
ironworkers were increasingly involved in the installation of windows, particularly curtain 
wall.    
14) UBS Building near completion. 
 
 
15) Ironworkers installing panels during the Shedd Aquarium renovation project in 1990-1991. 
16) John Ryan with his vintage outboard motor engine collection in his home workshop. 
17) John Ryan’s vintage outboard motor engine collection along with fish he has caught 
(muskies here) and shotguns in the gun case.  The two small fish on the left are crappies.  
Evinrude motors were built in Illinois. 
18) John Ryan with large musky. 
19) John Ryan with a trophy-size musky. 
20) John Ryan during his interview with Bucky Halker at IWU Local #63 Headquarters in 
Broadview, IL in 2011.
