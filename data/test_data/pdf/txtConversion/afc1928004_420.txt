H AS YOUR MOTHER ANY MORE LIKE YOU ? 
Written and sung by JACK CONROY. 
Kind friends, a 
story I'll tell to you 
Of the corner gang below, 
Whose insults I 
hear on every side 
As to my work I 
go. 
They wink hnd nudge each other and say, 
"Don't you think he'd make a 
fine billiard cue ? " 
But the worst of all is to hear them ball, 
" 
Has your mother any more like you ? " 
CHORUS. 
Shure they shout and cry as I 
pass by, 
" 
There goes Coffin-back McCue ;" 
But the worst of all is to hear them bawl, 
" 
Has your mother any more like you ? " 
I 
delivered a 
lecture at Hibernia Hall 
On a 
temperate and self-made man. 
On the gallery to my right one shouted all his might, 
"Do they feed that on the bread-and-water plan ? " 
They all began for to laugh and to say, 
" 
Will he ever take a 
drop and get through ;" 
But in the rear of the hall a 
young man began to bawl, 
" 
Has your mother any more like you ? " 
Shure they shout, etc. 
I 
started selling apples on a 
good business street, 
And that business was paying me grand. 
At last, by opposition I 
had to succumb, 
And sell out to an Italian man. 
I 
then went to cleaning clothes, 
And of course at that I " fell through," 
And as I'd pass by the gang they would cry, 
" 
How are you, old Coffin-back McCue ? " 
Shure they shout, etc. 
THE BAXTER-STREET SHEEl\TEY. 
Written by JACK Coxnor expressly for FRANK Bus 
ii, and wai the hit of 
the season in all the leading Variety Theatres, 
, 
my name is Isaac Moses, I'm a 
bully sheeney man -; 
I 
always try to make a 
dollar any way I 
can. 
I 
alter coats and pants, and glue the soles on shoes, 
And all the boots in Baxter street are made the same hy 
Jews. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jeminy Moses. (Symp.) 
Oxta ga zoc and clothes. (
Symp.) 
Oxta ga zoo ta, oxta ga zoo ta, oxta ga zoo ta, galla ga zan, 
You bet your life I 
always was the bully slieeney man. 
(Repeat.) 
My customers vas young fellows from all parts of the 
city ; 
I

joke vit dem, you bet I'm alvas 
I 
raise de ante a 
couple dollars venever I 
crack a 
joke; 
When they buy a 
pants and vaistcoat I 
treat them to a 
smoke. 
SPOKEN. — I vas selling a 
fur beaver to a 
friend of mine 
from Vail street last veek. He says I 
charge him ten dol-
lar for a 
suit, vich vas too much. I 
says, " You better go 
(1) 
up to the Blackvell's Island and get a 
suit foT nothing, 
yid board thrown in." A 
soldier came in vid a 
pair of 
-boots and no soles. 
I 
says, " Vat's dis ?" 
He says, 
" 
the soles fell off." " Vat ! . you valked in dose boots ! 
My friend, dose -vas not valking boots ; they vas calvalry 
:boots, for riding only." 
In come a 
piviter vit a 
coat like 
the tatooed Greek. 
He says, " Vat are you giving me a 
a .coat like this? all the dye run out of it." 
I 
say, 
" 
Young feller, you yore dis in de vette.r." 
He says, 
" 
Certainly." " Ah, ha! I 
thought you -canted a 
ball-
room coat." " Yell," he says, " have you got a 
plum-
colored coat for pic-nic purposes ?" I 
says, " Dere's one.' 
He says, 4' 
You lie, dat's green. 
You think I'm a 
variety 
performer." I 
laughed at him, and Says, " I 
bet you de 
cigars its plum color." 
He bet me, and I 
says, " Ain't 
de plum green before it's ripe ?" " " he says, " it's 
N. G.,' and it smells." " Not .de coat, my friend, it's 
me dat smells, • Come, vat vill you give for it ?" 
lie 
says, " It don't suit me." I 
says, " Make me an offer." 
" 
Six shillings," he says. " Goodness gracious, talk easy. 
Don't / et my wife Rachel hear you. 
She got the heart 
disease ; you'll kill her." 
So I 
had to let him have it, as 
it was Monday, and I 
did not make a 
cent ; and as be 
vent out I 
cried, " Here is some money, Rachel." 
Oh, Jirainy Moses, etc.

JOHNNY MORGAN. 
Sung by JACK CONROY. 
I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments; 
The music was the same. 
They were all one 
And Morgan was their name. 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ; 
The father beat the drum; 
The sisters played the tambourine; 
The brother went porn, porn, porn, porn. 
All alone on an old trombone. 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny to go 
Into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny 
Was the smartest of them all, 
And a17ound the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
A.11 the latest airs from France, 
The servant-girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
Johnny Morgan, etc'. 
Now, one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she'd never heard 
Such music played before. 
It pleased her so that you must know 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John to stand outside the house 
And play to her all day. 
Johnny Morgan, etc; 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so 
That when the time arrived to leave 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon. 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune. 
Johnny Morgan, eta,

REMENCRER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR 
OWN. 
Sung by GEORGE HUNTER, with immense applause. 
IN 
your path through life each day you will meet upon 
the way 
Fellow-mortals upon whom this world doth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or, by circumstances crushed and stricken down, 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble 
aims; 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save from a 
dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them 
with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone. 
You know not what's in store for the loved ones you 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your own. 
The shop-girls on the street with as much respect should 
meet 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny 
hand; 
They, too, have hearts and feelings—ye 4 
and souls. 
Their family is as dear to them as any here. 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn, and old;

REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OP YOUR 
OWN.—Concluded. 
Dejected and forlorn, yet still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and 
gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word with soothing ton—e. 
You know not what's in store for those whom you 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor whom perhaps grim want 
may lure 
To steal the bread their starving children crave. 
Be not the one to blame—you, yourself, would do the 
same. 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once, 
like you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who, no doubt, through care and strife, or some sorrow of 
their life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall; 
And the poor outcasts forlorn, don't pass them by with 
scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone. 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and 
shame; 
Remember you have children of your own.

THE- FIVE GENT SHAWL'. 
Written, composed and sung by TO- CANON. 
On 
I'm going to tell to you of the troubles I 
went throu& 
In a, barber's shop that isn't very far away. 
My beard it being strong, I 
thought ' twould not be wrong, 
To go and have it trimmed a 
bit the other day; 
And being short of cash, it struck me like a 
flash, 
That five cents was enough to pay in these hard times. 
So I 
went into, a 
place., as I 
thought it n3 disgrace,. 
To practice strict economy and save my dimes, 
SPOKEN.—YeS, I 
went into one of these barber's shops, where. 
they give you a 
shave for five cents and throw in a 
chrome. 
Well ! the fellow put me into a 
chair and took down a 
small.-
bottle off the shelf and was going to put it to my nose. What's 
that I 
says I. 
Chloroform, says he. I 
didn't come here to have 
my teeth pulled out, says I. 
Oh, well, says he, if you can 
stand it I 
can. 
Go ahead, says I. 
CHORUS. 
So he lathered me, he slathered me, he bruised me and abused' 
me, 
He tore me, and nearly drove me to my grave. 
He tickled me, he pickled me, he scratched me and he patched 
me, 
And I'd rather have the measles than his five cent shave. 
I 
stood it for awhile, I 
tried in vain to smile, 
He talked about. the weather as he scratched away ; 
He took toe by the hair and held rue in the chair, 
I 
thought my days were numbered and began to pray; 
At length I 
gave a 
roar, says I, I 
want no more. 
Here! you can have my pocket- book, but spare my life, 
Take all that I 
possess, and finish my distress, 
I 
cannot stand the torture of your slaughter- house knife. 
SPOKE N.-- You ought to see the way he went about it. 
The 
first thing I 
knew he had his knee upon my chest and was 
sawing away like a 
day's work. 
And then he called out to the 
fellow that cleans the spittoon ; here, Emanuel, come and put 
some grease on this razor, I'm stuck. 
Well, between the two 
they finally got it out, and I 
looked in the glass, and by the 
hohey my face was all marked out in town lots. 
What's this 
you have on my face 1 
I 
says. 
Oh ! well, he says, we expect 
our customers to come hack, and that's a 
diagram of the route. 
Well, says I, you may call this a 
clean shave, but I 
call it a 
clean skin and a 
barefaced one at that, and I'll never go there 
again, because, 
So he lathered me, etc. 
APPLE VENDERS. 
As sung by ScANLAN. 
and CRONIN, with great success. 
IF 
you plaze, sure we are two lone widows, 
Our husbands was killed in the war; 
They enlisted one day as two soldiers, 
Faith they murdered our darlings, agra! 
From the Government we get a 
small pension, 
For us and our children to share, 
But it isn't enough to maintain us, 
So we have to sell apples and pears. 
CHORUS. 
Apples and pears, (Symp.) 
Apples and pears, (
Symp.) 
So we have to sell apples and pears. 
Sure if we were two men we could labor, 
Oh! but what can two poor women do ? 
Sure we can't sthand all day at the wash-tub, 
Oh, the reason we'll now tell to you! 
We're troubled bad with the rheumatics, 
And all other such cares, 
And that is the reason you see us 
Out here selling apples and pears. 
Apples and pears, etc. 
Ah, there's many a 
man we could marry! 
Sure there's Denny McCarty, so fat; 
There is Patsy O'Reagan, a 
foine boy, 
Be my sowl, lie's a 
sound Democrat ; 
But they all do object to the children, 
And to marry us not one of them cares; 
SPOREN.— SO 
we'll let them all go to the devil, 
And we'll stick to our apples and pears. 
Apples and pears, etc.

BRIDGET ROACH. 
Ant.—" Nancy Lee." 
Written and snug by JACK CONROY. 
Pm Dennis Roach, I 
drive a 
coach— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! Whoa, ho 
My love to Bridget Flynn did broach— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
But sure she wants to wear the pants; she likes her beer, 
And every day when I'm away she acts so queer, 
Will wink her eye at passers-by, so devilish sly, 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
CHORUS. 
A 
hackman's wife from flirting should be free; 
Whoa, ho! such games -wont do for me; 
A 
hackman's wife a 
hackman's star should be— 
Her poker makes me stars to see. 
The other night an awful sight— 
Whoa, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
Did cause poor Dennis's heart to blight— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! 
Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
I 
loud did yelp for aid and help, but I 
was beat; 
I 
saw a 
man as off he ran, way down the street. 
He left his coat, the scheming bloat, on it was wrote, 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc. 
I 
couldn't stand like Gideon's Band— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa ! Whoa, ho! Whoa, ho! 
Came all the blackguards in the land, 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
So I'm again a 
single man, as you can see; 
Untied the band, no partner plan would do for me. 
I've sold my coach, and Biddy Roach is in the lurch; 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc.

McMAHON GRENADIERS. 
Sung with great success by JACK CONROY and GEORGE HUNTER. 
THE flags are flying gayly; 
The marshal's in command; 
The streets with people now are lined, 
The turn-out will be grand. 
From windows high they're shouting, 
" 
Oh, what a 
glorious day 
To see the McMahon Grenadiers 
March out in grand array 1" 
RFFRAIN AND CHORUS. 
As through the street we march we break each lady's 
heart. 
Our style is of the best when we appear. 
Our fame for solid Irishmen and love for Ireland 
Will nevermore be tarnished by the McMahon Genadiers. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we are a-marching ; yes, a-marching ; yes, a-marching. 
The ladies—yes, the darling little dears— 
With open hands they shout aloud 
For the McMahon Grenadiers. 
Our colonel's name is McMahon, 
Our captain is O'Hale. 
If they should call on us to fight 
You bet we never will fail. • 
We are not one of the home-guards, 
Who never fight, but run; 
But soldiers to the front 
You'll find the McMahons. 
As through the, etc. 
We are the ladies' favorites 
When we go on parade, 
With stars and stripes and gteen flag flying; 
The colors that never fade. 
In future, should they call on us to fight 
For our homes so dear, 
We'll be the first men on the field, 
The McMahon Grenadiers. 
As through the, etc.

when you're up, you're up, my boys, and when you're down, you're down. 
I've driven to the Derby with a 
four-in-hand so gay, 
I've also gone to Epsom, and I've tramped it all the way; 
I've had such gorgeous suppers that my taste began to pall, 
And I've been content with winkles at a 
costermonger's stall.

When " Up" in life I 
used to go to operas, plays, and balls, 
And always took the best seats in the dress boxes or stalls; 
I've also been compelled up in the gallery to sit, 
Or be jolly glad if I 
could get a " bob's" worth in the pit.

sweet girl I

I 
stared at her, and smiled and winked, when a 
young man by her

came out, walked after me, asked if my name was Brown; 
When I 
said, no; said he, take that; and with that knocked me down.

When traveling on the water with the weather rather rough, 
Of ups and downs in that way I've always had enough; 
On one occasion, I 
remember well, I 
thought I'd drown, 
And with the ship and passengers for ever settle down. 
Cho.—For when you're up, Sze. 
Yes, I 
have had my ups and downs, my misery and pain, 
But trust I'm up so far, that I 
may ne'er be down again; 
So as you've helped to raise me up, and make me of renown, 
I 
most sincerely hope you'll never help to push me down,

DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACK CONKOY. 
DID you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County Mayo. 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith, indeed, 'twas an elegant sight; 
But the boys, one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but Duffy sold horrible liquor; 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in droves and by dozens, 
And got into a 
terrible fight. 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, ete:. 
They stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since he gave the grand opening night. 
Ali, but Duffy, etc.

MEN OF ERIN'S ISLE. 
Originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
GOOD evening, friends, you don't know me, 
You have not seen me before; 
I'm a 
gentleman, as you can see, 
From Erin's lovely shore; 
The reason I've come here to-night 
Is to make you understand 
A 
few things that some here don't know 
Of my own, my native land. 
CHORUS. 
For wit and good nature where's the men 
Can beat us from our soil ? 
They're always frisky, ever gay, 
-With the willing heart to toil; 
They'll take a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
Those are the sort of men you'll find, 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard them call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too, 
But, let me tell you, we can dress 
Just as good as you ; 
Why can't Pat be a 
gentleman ? 
I've heard them sing the same ; 
Wen, Pat always was a 
gentleman, 
And one he will remain. 
For wit, etc., 
There's good and bad in every clime, 
As all of you well know, 
But for to class all men alike, 
It's wrong you should do so; 
AlI where's the flock that has not got 
A 
black sheep ? tell me that, 
And, believe me, you will find worse friends 
Than those you call poor Pat. 
So now my little song is done, 
With no offence to you, 
But always bear this in your mind, 
As this. world you travel through: 
Pat's flesh and blood, and nothing More, 
And on morething I'll say, 
Praise O'Connell, Goldsmith, and Thomas Moore, 
Before I 
go away. 
For wit, etc. 
For wit, etc.

THE BLUE, 
GRAY AND GREEN. 
Originally and only sung by CONROY and HUNTER. 
SHOULD the foe once dare to invade us, 
It is then close together we'll he seen, 
To stop that foe that would invade us, 
Come to fight the blue, the gray, and green. 
While freedom's proud flag we are holding 
No false tyrant shall dare touch our shore, 
For there is not a 
son of old Ireland 
Would not battle for the land we adore. 
CHORUS. 
So, let no foeman dare invade us, 
For 'tis then close together will be seen, 
As they'd shoulder bold the guns to make each tyrant run 
Who would dare to fight the blue, the gray, and green. 
Bless the flag waves over the poor man; 
'Tis the emblem that makes us people so free, 
And is worshipped the wide world over— 
Is feared on the land and on the sea. 
Our freemen would stand so delighted 
When, in spite of each emperor or queen, 
The bright stars with the harp of Erin 
By the hands of the blue, gray, and green. 
So let no, etc. 
Let princes and lords in their glory 
Boast their wealth to some other than me; 
'Tis my pride to tell you the story 
That I 
live in this land of the free. 
'Tis the land my ancestors fought for; 
'Tis the nation did find them a 
home 
When away from the dear soil of Erin 
As poor ramblers they forced them to roam. 
So let no, etc.

song to you I'll show,What I've seen while I've been dreaming 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
cabman, and 
Desiring then to ride, 
I 
hail'd him from a 
neighb'ring stand, 
And quickly jump'd inside ; 
He drove me near two miles, not more, 
And so, when 1 
got, out, 
I 
tendered him a 
shilling, for 
'Twas his right fare, no doubt. 
WHEN I'VE BEEN DREAMING.---[CoNcLuDED1 
I 
saw him look the money o'er, 
His face with pleasure beaming, 
And he never ask'd for sixpence more, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
dreamt the papers every day 
Prais'd each fair lady's dress, 
Especially in pantomimes, 
And likewise in burlesques; 
To theatres I 
now allude 
Where morals " could" be taught, 
That; naught seen there could be call'd rude.; 
But all was as it ought. 
I 
thought each lady was " well- clad," 
Her modest form thus screening, 
But, when I 
heard men cry, "too bad," 
Then I 
knew that I'd been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt that all the young men gay, 
Who try us girls to woo, 
Meant all the foolish things they say, 
And all their vows were true ; 
thought they said naught that was rash, 
And none of them were scheming, 
But prized our hearts before our cash. 
Then,I knew that I 
was dreaming. 
And when they for a 
kiss will press, 
And eyes with love are beaming, 
We ne'er say, "no," when we mean "yes," 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. . 
I 
also dreamt that all the men 
Who took themselves a 
wife, 
And promised at the altar, then, 
To chelish her through life: 
I 
thought they always kept their word, 
With love for ever teeming; 
And " Family Jars," they ne'er occured, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
thought their hearts beat with delight, 
When baby loud was screaming; 
And never stayed out late at night, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming,

BOSTON MART'. 
Originally and only sung by JACK CONROY. 
OH, I'm one that's fond of pleasure; 
It is my greatest pride, 
And in my hours of leisure 
To go toddling thro' the glide. 
0, give to me the outside sport, 
It is so gay and airy, 
For all the boys around the park 
They call me Boston Mary. 
CHORUS. 
"With my tita la, oh, tita 
Wherever I 
may go, 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Is Boston Mary, oh. 
With my tita la, my tita la! 
Wherever I 
may lark, 
You bet I 
have the best costume 
Of any of the girls in the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Joey, that's his name ; 
At summer time often on the lawn 
We play the croquet game. 
Oh, do I 
not admire it ? 
My chance I 
would not miss ; 
Before my petty parts with me 
His darling he must kiss. 
With my tita la, etc. 
One evening, while out rambling— 
'Twas shortly after dark— 
My Joe and I 
went meandering 
Up to Washington Park. 
While walking around the fountain 
We met with a 
parcel of loons. 
One asked me to pay a 
visit with him 
To one of the " tea-rooms." 
With my tita la, etc. 
Sung by JACK CONROY. 
i'LL ask consideration, friends, 
And I 
will let you know 
That I 
am saluted by the gang 
Wherever I 
may go. 
I 
live in eighteen " carrot " style, 
I 
drive a 
trotting mare; 
I 
smoke Elora de five per cent. cigars, 
And singe my curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Charley Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Wears the latest style of collars, 
Charley Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Worth one hundred thousand dollars. 
When I 
go out to walk, 
My shirt as white as chalk, 
The gang say clear the way, 
For here comes Charley Flynn. 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on oyster stews; 
I 
can pivot on a 
three-cent piece, 
And dance the Lanciers too. 
And oftentimes I 
make a 
speech, 
Of course on politics, 
And when I 
say a 
little too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks. 
Charley Flynn, etc. 
I'VE BEEN TOO GOOD A FRIEND. 
'The music of this song can be had of H. K ALLEM3ERG, 518 Grand street, 
New York. 
Price 3.5 cents. 
sung with success by JOHN 'W ILSON, New York favorite motto singer. 
I ONCE- was dressed up in the style— 
Had money to command; 
The ladies on me used to smile, 
And shake me by the hand. 
When any one would ask for cash 
I 
had always some to lend. 
These rags will tell I've acted rash, 
And been too good a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they pass me by. 
None so poor as I. 
Yet, never regretting, the past I'm forgetting., 
I'll take what fate may send. (
Repeat.) 
The very men that I 
have lent 
Now pass me by with scorn. 
'They never give me back a 
cent, 
Tho' now I'm so forlorn. 
'They used to laugh at all my jokes, 
And humbly to me bend. 
Not to myself, but other folks, 
I've been too good a 
friend. 
'Yes, they pass, etc. 
To view the past I 
sometimes smile 
Amid my great mishaps. 
My coat needs mending, and my " tile" 
Would like a 
little " nap." 
To poverty I 
will not kneel; 
I'll take what fate may send. 
My heart is easy, though I 
feel 
I've been too good a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
a 
Yes, they pass me by. 
None so poor as I. 
It's taught me a 
lesson—a 
clearly learned lesson. 
I've been too good a 
friend. (
Repeal.) 
THE BOLD BOYS IN BLUE AND THE IRISH 
BRIGADE. 
Sung originally by H UNTER and CONROY. 
HUNTER. 
I wasir to sing the emblem I 
love, ' 
The stars and the stripes that float o'er us ; 
And long may it wave, the bright flag of the brave— 
The -flag that to victory bore us. 
CONP,OY. 
Old Ireland, God bless her, is my native land ; 
Her brave sons were never afraid. 
We helped you to fight for your freedom, 
Did the boys of the Irish brigade. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah! hurrah for Columbia and Erin! 
Their soldiers united need ne'er be afraid. 
I 
think they can whip the whole world when together— 
Our own boys in blue and the Irish brigade. 
HUNTER. 
In days now past our fathers did fight 
To free this dear land I 
was born in ; 
To the battle did go to lay tyranny low, 
For tyrants they ever, were scorning. 
CONROY. 
And Paddy came over to join in the fun 
From the land where heroes are made, 
Then soon back the redcoats retreated 
From the boys of the Irish brigade. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc. 
HUNTER. 
And ' tis well did my country you thank, 
The right hand of friendship extended. 
You'll never rue the day you did cross the wide sea., 
Your green with the starry flag blended. 
CONROY. 
'Tis coming, I 
hope, soon, the thrice happy time, 
Again with old Ireland arrayed, 
You'll bear her green flag in the battle 
With the boys of the Irish brigade. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc.

BUMMER'S HOTEL. 
AIR.—" Isle of Blackwell." 
Written by Mr. RICHMOND, and originally sung by PAT ROONEY and 
JACK CONROY. 
On, my name is Mike Do.nohue; I 
came from Galore, 
I 
have a 
large family and I 
opened a 
store; 
I 
hired the whole building, the gang knew me well, 
And the name that they call it, is the Bummer's Hotel. 
CHORUS. 
One cent for coffee, two cents for bread, 
Three for a 
steak, and five cents for a 
bed. 
The breeze from the gutter throws a 
salt water smell 
To the ex-politicians, at the Bummer's Hotel. 
There's big fat Kate Grady puts your name on the book; 
She is head chambermaid and chief pastry cook. 
She makes fine mutton pies, and like hot cakes they sell. 
On the European plan, is the Bummer's Hotel. 
One cent for coffee, etc. 
We have ninety-five boarders, we are packed to the door, 
They pay us five cents, and spit tobacco on the floor. 
They bring in stale lager, and of murders do tell. 
Sure Delmonico's is nowhere to the Bummer's Hotel. 
One cent for coffee, etc.

THE NATIONAL GUARD. 
Sung with great success by CONROY and HuNran. 
On, bright and gay is the National Guard! with colors 
flying free, 
We dash along and grandly parade; here's none so 
proud as we. 
Our guns we hold in the prettiest line, to catch the peo-
ple's eye, 
With our heads upright and eyes so bright when we go 
marching by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! right about we go! 
The stars and stripes above, so gallantly they flow. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, down Broadway. 
The ladies wave their little hands to see our grand array. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time! march, in our uniform so bright. 
The drums and trumpets play, and fill us with delight 
When we meet to march or fight. 
We take the lead—we do, indeed—the American National 
Guard. 
Oh, still on hand is the National Guard to meet the nation's 
foe, 
And bright and clear their record so fair, which all the 
people know. 
We heed the call of the national voice, and ready lads 
we are. 
At the word of command, with heart and hand, we rally 
near and far. • 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! gleams our banner high; 
Your heart will beat with pride to see us passing by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, gay lads we, 
To right about and in and out, parading bold and free. 
Mark time, etc. 
Then here's success to the National Guard, and may it 
lead the van, 
And always heed the national call—be ready every man. 
Oh, may it ever its powder keep dry to strike a 
gallant blow, . 
While the people love those stars above bright waving to 
and fro. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! in the van we lead, 
The people come from far to see each man and steed. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, light and gay. 
We're always ready, rank and file, to meet and march _ 
away. 
Mark time, etc.

THE PULLING MACHINE. 
Written by PETE CANNON, and sung by JACK CONROY. 
To bother you long is not my intention, 
I'll bid you good-night and be leaving you soon; 
But first let me tell you about an invention 
I 
recently saw in a 
liquor saloon. 
I 
have met with some things that puzzled me greatly, 
And twenty-four years in this country I've been, 
But, believe me, I 
never was caught so completely 
As they caught me one night with a 
pulling machine. 
CHORUS. 
The villain that first studied out the invention, 
Whoever he is, must be terrible mean,. 
I'd give fifty dollars for his apprehension, 
And I'd put him to death on his pulling machine. 
" 
See how much you can pull," says a 
man who steod 
near me. 
"I'll bet you the drinks I 
can pull more than you." 
Then the crowd all around him began for to cheer me, 
So I 
just took hold, to see what I 
could do. 
The bar-tender sent electricity through me. 
Such dancing and leaping there never was seen. 
My hair stood on end, and I 
swore I 
would murder 
The man who invented the pulling machine. 
The villain that, etc. 
The shock that it gave me it near drove me crazy, 
It went through my system like needles and pins; 
They say that my dancing was graceful and easy, 
But some of them got a 
good kick in the shins. 
When the torture was over they called me a 
gilly, 
And they told me that I 
must be terrible green ; 
That I 
ought to know better than be such a 
sucker 
For to dance all my steps on a 
pulling machine. 
SPOKEN. —
Says one fellow, " It's only a 
patent for circu-
lating the blood well." 
Says I, " I 
want all the blood I 
have now." 
Says he, " Did you never read where Dr. 
Franklin caught the lightning in a 
bottle ? " " I 
did," 
says I; " but if I 
had the fellow that made that machine 
he'd catch blazes quicker than lightning. 
In fact," says 
I, " I 
think it's a 
shocking machine, and— 
" 
The villain that," etc.

Copyright, 1818, by E. H. HAnDING. 
My name is George Adolphus Brown, 
A 
gentleman of fashion ; 
The ladies' most devoted slave, 
I'm full of the tender passion. 
My hands with toil I 
never soil, 
And every care I 
shun. 
The old folks think the world of me, 
I'm the governor's only son. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the governor's only son, 
I'm festive and I'm free ; 
At home I 
am the baby, 
And my parents doat on me. 
I'm a 
favorite with the girls, 
I 
give them lots of fun ; 
I'm quite a 
pet, and don't forget, 
I'm the governor's only son. 
I 
cultivate a 
lofty style, 
I 
drive a 
horse and carriage, 
With some fair creature by my side, 
But never think of marriage. 
They say, " I 
ought to settle down, 
When some sweetheart I've won," 
But there's a 
score of girls that sigh 
For the governor's only son. 
I'm the governor's only son, etc. 
I 
drink the finest brands of wine, 
And make my friends all jolly ; 
I 
love the midnight hour of joy, 
Tho' some may think it folly. 
I 
never want for cash to spend, 
I 
go it while I'm young, 
I 
laugh ha, ha ! and sing ta,ta, ! 
I'm the governor's only son. 
I'm the governor's only son, etc.

BECAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Sung by GEORGE H UNTER. 
THERE'S a 
dear spot in Ireland I 
long to see; 
It's my own native birth-place, and- it's heaven to me. 
Sure my poor widowed mother lies there all alone, 
With my brothers and sisters. 
T'was a 
bright, happy 
home. 
Sure, we hadn't much money, but my own mother dear 
To me gave her blessing, bade me heart be good cheer, 
Then the shadow of poverty darkened my door, 
And I 
left mother and Ireland, because we were poor. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my thoughts oft go back to that dear little spot— 
To my brothers and sisters, and that thatched cot— 
To my poor widowed mother—I'll ne'r see he more. 
'Twas a 
shame ! but I 
left her because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright, rosy morn 
When old Ireland I 
left how my poor heart did mourn, 
When my blessed old Mother said, " Be of good cheer! 
Good-bye, Michael darling ! " Farewell, mother, dear! 
Then my brothers and sisters took me by the hand 
And bade me do right when I 
left Ireland ; 
Then I 
bade them good-bye at our cottage door, 
And left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Oh, my thoughts, etc. 
Since leaving old Ireland my poor mother's dead. 
" 
God bless and protect him !" were the last words she 
said, 
And the ring that my father gave she sent to me. 
'Tis a 
far clearer prize than bright gems could e'er be. 
And my bothers and sisters, I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them; but they'll come, never 
fear. 
I've a 
neat little cot on America's shore 
Where happy we'll live, although we are poor. 
Oh, my thuoghts, etc.

OUR BANNER. 
Sung by GEORGE HUNTER and JACK CONROY. 
OUR banner bright it flies aloft; it's bunting is unfurled. 
We give to all a 
welcome—each nation in the world. 
It stood for more than a 
century o'er mountain, plain, 
and sea. 
Come welcome all, come, when we call to the dear land 
of the free. 
CHORUS. 
Come to our banner, thus welcome you shall be; 
Come from every nation, over land and sea. 
We will grasp you by the hand; forgotten be the past. 
We'll welcome you as brothers true, in friendship sure to 
last. 
Let England send her hardy sons; to them we'll give the 
hand. 
We can't forget that Washington sprung from the mother 
land. 
Brave France, her sons we'll welcome, she gave us La-
fayette; 
And Ireland, sweet, her sons we'll greet; Patrick Henry 
we'll ne'er forget. 
Come to our, etc. 
Let Russia send her fur-clad sons from each ice-covered 
plain; 
Remember that Columbus he came from sunny Spain ; 
Each bold Swiss leave his mountain, each rocky vale and 
fell; 
We'll welcome great, as brothers meet the sons of William 
Tell. 
Come to our, etc. 
From Greeenland's icy mountains bleak, 
Germany's 
sunny Rhine, 
The tropic lands of bright Brazil, where fierce the sun 
doth shine ; 
From the dear land of Kossuth, and Denmark, in the 
north— 
China, India, and Japan—let their manly sons come 
forth. 
Come to our, etc.

07/ERE'S NOTHING LIKE PRIDE.—[CoseLuDriol 
I 
borrow from all who will lend, 
And none t 
an resist me, they say; 
I'm kept in cigars by a 
friend, 
With orders I 
go to the play; 
For dinners my purse is not task'd 
Though many choice spreads do I 
see; 
Some people would wait to be ask'd, 
For there's nothing like pride about me.t 
And I 
laugh at all, die. 
Of tailors you'd think I'd the pick, 
I 
dress such an out-au-out swell, 
33ut I 
get all my suits upon tick, 
Which suits me remarkably well. 
For duns I 
tie'er lack an excuse, 
But never a 
coin let - them see; 
I 
can put up with lots of abuse, 
For there's nothing like pride about mt. 
And I 
laugh at all, &c. 
My rent I 
don't trouble about,— 
For nowhere I 
make a 
long stay,_ 
In fact, as a 
rule, I 
move out 
On the night before each quarter-day. 
I 
creep down the stairs like an elf, 
And let myself out with a 
key; 
And carry my luggage myself, 
For there's nothing like pride about me. 
And I 
laugh at all, &c. 
Now, I 
hope you approve of my lay, 
And mean to knock pride on the head ;— 
I've found it's a 
dodge that don't pay, 
So practise true greatness instead.

And a

YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND TO ME. 
Sung by En. BURTON, the popular baritone. 
Ur bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when youth was in 
prime ; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my sorrowed heart wae 
free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend t4,

If ever I

Mend, 
You've been a 
friend t-e 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved, me too, 
I 
would have had. a 
broken heart, had it not been for you; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
-Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me-

‘ir he light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life t

I 
smile to think 'mid all life's scenes, you've been a

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At la.st he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, eta.

Price 40 cents. 
W HEN I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To Him who my soul will save ;. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of days that have been ; 
This one little wish I 
ask of you— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen ; 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Though the hours of joy now are passing. 
Yet how soon, alas ! they will fade ; 
Though your glances of love are meeting my owrt 
Fair sunlight will turn to shade ; 
When from the world and its hopes I 
go, 
Leaving forever this scene, 
Though others are dear, ah, will you then 
See that my grave's kept green ? 
Oh, the days, etc.. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
Though the voice of chiding be heard. ? 
And while others may speak in censure or blamei 
Yet breathe no unkindly word ; 
Tell me you'll think of the happy past, 
Think of the joys we have seen ; 
This one little promise keep for me— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, th.ci days, etc. 
BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK CONROT, 
every evening, at GILL'S, 15 West Houston street. 
I AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request. 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
01101tITS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc. 
MY MARY ANN. 
Sung to great-applause by JOHN CONROY. 
OH, I have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allanna,", 
With a 
voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes, of Killarney," 
She frightens the people all off from the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she 'tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary—is my Mary Ann, 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre ball, 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla Hall, 
And when she got there, she went straight for the gmu 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She oalled for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
But her mouth when it opened her breath was so stron 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
You'll find her at all of the blow-
outs and parties, 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all; 
And when she is at it she goes it no hearty 
That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McNally's one night at a 
party, 
And to .make things look lively, she whipped off Ii 
shoes. 
Her feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all the people clean out of the room. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc.

I 
TOOK my girl one clay, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare; 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
asled them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, and this was their reply— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, - 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he look'd at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugh'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commenc'd to cry— 
Oh! Ern .
a, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
"Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies, 
Oh! Emma, etc.

A PARODY ON "WHOA, 
EMMA P
"' 
W ritten and riung by JACK CONROY. 
I 
TOOK a 
sail one day 
Down to Far Rockaway, 
And the gang on the- 
boat 
They all did know me well. 
I 
commenced to drink and treat 
Till I 
hardly could hold my feet ; 
But listen and my sorrows I 
will tell : 
SPOKEN.—After the gang got me- pretty full, they took, 
the hat off of my head and commenced to crown it—as 
they call it. 
But I 
began to think they were taking the 
rim off of it. 
I 
picked it up, and left them, and went to 
the rear part of the boat, where they were playing a: 
Yankee game of cards culled " Three-card Monte," I 
asked for a hand, and they said only ono- mini held it 
but they said to me, " You look like a 
sport. 
Now them 
is the Jack, the King and the Ten. 
Now," he went on, 
" 
I'll bet you can't pick the Jack out.of the three cards." 
Well, he tossed them about, and he turned his back to-
spit out ; with that a 
man marked the card and showed it 
to me. " I'll bet you ten dollars I'll pick out the card." 
" 
Well," says he, " I'll bet you." 1 
put down my ten dol-
lars, and 1 
grabbed hold of the marked card. I 
declare 
to my goodness, he was sold to the devil, and turned the 
card into an eight. 
I 
walked away feeling bad. 
With, 
that the gang opened on me, and shouted : 
CHORU&—Oh, Old Rags McKenna, ; 
Oh, old Rags McKenna ; 
You will have to gather 
To raise another tenner. 
We at the beach did land, 
I 
walked up to a 
stand, 
And said, let me have a 
big glass of ale.-
" 
Oh, ale we do not sell." 
Lager will do as well ; 
It's stuff that gaugers gather in a 
pail. 
SPOKEN.—There was a 
party of Germans eating at the 
gland. I 
put down twenty-five cents, the man says, " Ten 
cents more," " I 
eat nothing." He says " You drink all 
_ono." " No, I'm d--d 
if I 
did ; that is Crosby street 
1),-wr you are 
me." \V 
11. I 
gave him the ten cents, 
and walked away. 
With that the Gi.‘rmris shouted : 
Oh, Old Rags McKenna, etc.

SONG. 
Dedicated most respectfully to J. 
H. 
LYNCH by JACK CONROY. 
I'm a 
family man, and I'll tell you my woe— 
It will teach you a 
lesson wherever you go ; 
Of every complaint I 
have sure had my share, 
I 
once lost all my teeth, and it fell out my hair ; 
I 
tried all the physic which druggists do sell ; 
But nothing I 
took that did make me feel well. 
'Twits a 
question of time my leaving this soil, 
Till to Lynch's I 
went for some cod liver oil. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch—Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch— 
When sickness and pain my poor stomach did wrench, 
You saved me from taking my rest 'neath the soil, 
With your King of all physic—your cod liver oil ! 
To make matters worse, all my babies sick fell, 
My tom- cat stopped " mewing " and began then to swell, 
My serving man drank till he shook with the " jims !" 
And my wife one day made me the father of twins 1 
In fact all my household they went to the bad— 
No cure for their sickness at all could be had. 
For days thro' this town I 
did labor and toil 
Till to :Lynch's I 
went for some cod liver oil. 
Oh! Dr. J. Lynch, etc. 
I 
met a 
young friend and said " where have you been ?" 
He said Fulton market ; the number eighteen ; 
There Dr. Lynch dwells, and he daily does toil, 
For he cures all New York with his cod liver oil ; 
His own manufacture, superior to all. 
In joy this I 
heard and soon made him a 
call. 
All my people got well and are still on the soil-
More power to great Lynch and his cod liver oil! 
Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch, etc. 
Some doctors they give you powders and pills— 
Some say that a 
plaster will cure all your ills 
If hearty and hale thro' this world you would toil 
Be sure to get Lynch's pure cod liver oil ! 
Allow not the druggist bad physic to palm, 
Nor dose you with something that will do you harm. 
Just tell him at once it is Lynch's you mean, 
Keeps in Fulton market ; the number eighteen. 
! 
Dr. J. Lynch, etc.

I'm the father of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly, 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man die, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
,They talk about the Marphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say—don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop.

I 
am a 
thorough sport every time; 
I 
am the flower of fashion wherever I

With the boys I've spent many a 
dime ; 
I 
can play casino, I 
can live fast or slow, 
Whichever may suit me the best, 
And whenever I

I 
have a

An Irishman 
Of high degree; 
The ladies' pet, 
I'm George Magee. 
I 
have a 
wink in my eye that does capture the girls, 
And my smiles they can never resist; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I 
have a 
gold ring on my fist, 
And every one knows as they look at my clothes 
They're made of good stuff, firm and strong; 
As I 
walk on the street every damsel I 
meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along. 
I 
am George Magee.

A 
DANDY and a 
lady's man has come before you now, 
A 
man of taste and culture, for ' tis written on my brow ; 
In Irish circles I'm the pet of all the ladies fair, 
And I 
always meet with favor and a 
hearty welcome there. 
The reason must be obvious, I 
don't make use of slang; 
I 
use well chosen language, which surprises all the gang. 
You'll often hear the ladies say, " Now hasn't he the tone ? 
He ought to be a 
counsellor, George Constantine Mc-
Keown." 
I'm in the book and picture trade, I 
canvass every day ; 
And tho' the times are very hard, I 
always make it pay. 
The literature of Ireland I 
have at my command, 
And when I'm talking up a 
trade my style is great and 
grand; 
I 
tell them how brave Sarsfield fought and kept the foe 
at bay, 
And how the women held the fort at Limerick town that 
day; 
I 
get them all excited, for I 
am no dunce or drone ; 
You'll hear them cry, " I'll take four books, George Con-
stantine McKeown." 
You ought to hear me make a 
speech about election time ; 
I 
overflow with eloquence, with anecdote, with rhyme ; 
My attitudes are picturesque, and I 
can plainly show 
That I'm the Irish orator, the Celtic " Cicero." 
Some try to imitate me, but their show attempts are vile ; 
They cannot catch my lofty tone, my grand imperious 
style. 
Let spurious imitators fall, for equals I 
have none ; 
I 
am the great original, George Constantine McKeown. 
OWEN RILEY. 
Sung with immense success by JACK CONROY. 
OH, my name is Owen Riley, 
I 
have a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He is out every night singing comic songs 
He learns at sonic free and easy ; 
He wanted his mother to put on the gloves with him, 
He broke his little brother's leg with the poker, 
He has an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play, 
High Low, Sancho Pedro, Penuckle, Number 
One, Number Two, or any other game without a 
joker. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my name is. Owen Riley, 
I 
have a 
son that sets me crazy, 
He is out every night singing comic songs 
He learns at sonic free and easy. 
He went and pawned my suit of clothes 
That I 
wear when I 
walk out Sunday, 
He's arrested every Saturday night, 
And I 
bail him out on Monday ; 
He pawned his sister's new switch of hair 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And brought me down to the old fourth ward, 
To fight with a 
big buck nagur. 
Oh, my, etc. 
He wears a 
big gold watch and chain, 
That he got of some pawnbroker ; 
He makes his money by i)laying a 
game 
That him and the gang calls poker; 
He's taking lessons in sparring, too, 
Wants sponge-cake and pie for his supper ; 
He came home the other night, he was stiff boiling 
tight, 
And threw the corn'd-beef and cabbage in the gutter. 
Oh, my, etc. 
THE HOTEL CLEANER. 
Written by Rictimosn for JACK CONROY, and originally sung by him. 
I'LL sing you a 
song about a 
young man, 
He could whip any man that couldn't fight. 
He'd a 
pair of bow legs and he sampled beer kegs, 
He'd keep eating from morning till night ; 
Sure he'd never stop eating till he'd clean a 
place out, 
And he said that he never felt well ; 
He eat twenty-three cheeses from a 
wagon one day, 
Did this man that cleans out the hotel. 
CHORUS. 
Tra la la, tra la la, 
And he says that he never feels well ; 
Tra la la, tra la la, 
Does the man that cleans out the hotel. 
He turned a 
whole restaurant inside out, 
And he ate a 
white dog called the Spitz, 
The dirty old thief ate all the roast beef, 
And seared the waiters all into fits ; 
He eat a 
whole Turk, and then called for a 
Russian, 
He ate Limburger and how he did smell, 
He swallowed the cook and put his name on the book, 
Did the man that cleans out the hotel. 
Tra la la, etc. 
He always complains that his appetite's poor, 
And a 
square meal he never can make, 
For to swallow my mother-in-law he did try, 
But he found her a 
very tough steak ; 
He eat eighty pounds of Boston baked beans, 
And it's all but the truth that I 
tell, 
They gave him six months and he starved the whole 
jail, 
Did the man that clea.s out the hotel. 
Tra la la, etc. 
BY-BY, CHARLEY. 
Written and sung by JACK CON ROY. 
On, here I 
am, an Irishman. 
As you can plainly see, 
And all the girls about the town, 
They fall in love with me ; 
They say I 
am their darling, 
And their baby I 
must be, 
And as I 
promenade the street, 
This is what they say— 
CHORUS. 
By-by, Charley, you're a 
pet of mine, 
I'll meet you in the lane when the clock strikes nine ; 
Your style is so bewitching, it has pierced me thro' and 
thro', 
I'll hit you with some gam-drops, and throw sheep's eyes 
at you. 
They call me Count Johannes, 
And they say I'm awful. fly, 
They tell me to pull down my vest, 
To go lay down and die; 
They say I 
am the freshest man 
That ever came their way, 
And I 
ought to go to Syracuse, 
And get salted every day. 
By-by, etc. 
THE TRITE SONS OF ERIN. 
Sung by il-AcK CONROY and GEORGE HUNTER. 
DON'T be alarmed at seeing us here, 
We are gents of the very first water ; 
Our appearance will show we are noblemen too ; 
And sons of a 
nobleman's daughter ; 
Our mother, God bless her, she doted on us, 
For all her pleasures we made ; 
We are commanders now in the army, 
In the ranks of the Irish Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah ! hurrah for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers who are never afraid ; 
They are true to the core and dare- devil daring. 
The true noble sons of the Irish Brigade. 
We marched to the front with nine hundred strong, 
In a 
line thro' the dead and dying, 
We marched gayly on with the fife and the drum; 
While the green flag above its was flying, 
Yes, high in the air it proudly did wave, 
Seemingly not afraid, 
For it knew that protection was near, 
From the boys in the Irish Brigade. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc. 
The Irish brigade is both strong and brave, 
For fighting the best in the land, 
And if you're in trouble the true sons of Erin 
Will willingly extend a 
hand ; 
Yes, they will give as long as they live 
One-half of which they possess 
To the needy and poor who conic to their door 
With a 
cry for help in distress. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc.

MOLLY, I 
CAN'T SAY YOU'RE HONEST. 
Oh, Molly, I 
can't say you're honest, 
You've stolen the heart from my breast; 
I 
ree,1 like a 
bird that's astonished 
When young vagabonds rob its nest. 
My brightest of sunshine at night is, 
Just between midnight and dawn ; 
And then, Molly, dear my delight is, 
To sing you my little " crunawa." 
CHORUS. 
Winastru fillaloo, but I'm kilt: may the quilt 
Lie light on your beautiful form 
When the weather 'tis hot, but my love when '
tis not 
May it rowl ye up cosy and warm, fi.laloo. 
I 
know that your father is stingy, 
And likewise your mother the same; 
And it's very small change I 
will bring you, 
Excepting the change of your name. 
So make haste with the change, dearest Molly, 
Be that same, more or less as it may, 
And my own name I'll give you, my darling: 
The minute that you name the day. 
Winastru fillaloa, 4ce. 
Oh, if you are sleeping, dear Molly, 
Don't let me waken you, dear ; 
Some tender memorial I'll lave you 
Just to let you know I 
was here. 
I'll throw a 
big stone at the window, 
And if any !,lass I 
should break; 
It's for you all the paids I 
am taking, 
What wouldn't 1 
smash for your sake.

BULL PUP. 
Respectfully dedicated IO 
JACK CONROY by BILLY HARRISON. 
As I 
was walking down the street as happy as a 
lord 
A 
crowd of little boys began to holler, 
" 
There goes a 
terrier with a 
bull-pup 
Without the number of the license on his collar." 
They all bawled out as loud as they could shout, 
" 
Come back here and give us a 
half- dollar; 
We'll go down to the Mayor and get your license out, 
And we'll have the number painted on the collar." 
CHORUS. 
Is there any one here wants to buy a 
bull-pup ? 
Well, that's all right, my covey ! 
If there ain't I 
suppose I 
shall have to give him up, 
Or‘die with the hydrophobia. 
We took him to the mayor, and the devil a 
one was there 
But an old chap who had the gout, sir. 
Sez he, with a 
leer, " Now, what do you want here ? " 
Sez I, " I 
want to get my license out, sir." 
He caught him by the chain, but he broke away _ again, 
And loudly commenced for to holler, 
And kicked up such a 
racket, we put on a 
strait-jacket, 
And finally got the number on his collar. 
Is there any, etc. 
Now, he's not very short, nor he's not very long ; 
He's as good as you can find 'em ; 
His ears he carries on the side of his head, 
And his tail keeps wagging behind him. 
He can whistle like a 
pig, or play a 
game of chance. 
If you want him you can take him for a 
dollar. 
He can do an Irish jig or a 
double song and dance 
Since he got the number painted on his collar. 
, 
Is there any, etc. 
GILLFILLIN'S BIG BUCK GOAT. 
Sung by JACK Coxnor. 
COME listen to me for a 
while, 
To what I'm going to say ; 
It's all about a 
neighbor of mine 
Who lives across the way. 
He is the owmer of a 
big coal cart; 
He likewise drives the same. 
He has a 
great big billy-goat, 
Who is very much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For when he'd jump he'd give you a 
thump, 
Unless you'd quicky slope. 
The terror of the neighborhood 
Is Gillfillin's big buck goat. 
'Twas only here this afternoon 
He came into our yard, 
While I 
was planting flowers, 
And he hit me very hard. 
He knocked me down and jumped on me, 
And ate the tail of my coat. 
My mother-in-law is suffering bad 
Since she met the big buck goat. 
For when he'd, etc. 
Last week he ate my shirt and vest, 
Likewise my Sunday hat ; 
He also knocked the stuffing out 
Of Mrs. Maloney's cat. 
She gave a 
scream, and he gave a 
jump. 
I 
tell you there was a 
row. 
He sent her flying over the stove, 
And she wants no bustle now. 
For when he'd, etc. 
Sung by JACK Co ROY. 
I'M the alderman of the ward, 
The Honorable Michal Dunn, 
With a 
new plug hat and a 
green cravat, 
I'm a 
full-blooded Irishman. 
I 
used to shovel and dig 
With a 
gang on the Boulevard, 
But I'm down on the slate for a 
candidate 
For alderman of the ward. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
I've quit the Boulevard 
With a 
shovel and pick no more for Mick; 
I'm the alderman of the ward. 
There's my daughter, Mary Ann, 
I've rigged her out so fine, 
Wid diamonds and rings, and ribbons and things, 
And an elegant bustle behind. 
0, you ought to see her swell 
With the ' quality " on the street, 
With a 
gown of green, like an Irish queen, 
So elegant and complete. 
With a 
ha, ha, etc. 
If you call at my brown-stone front 
I'll be glad to see you a 
while ; 
Of whiskey and stuff I'll give you enough, 
In regular alderman style. 
The number and name are on the door ; 
'Tis painted in elegant green. 
Don't bother to knock, but up with a 
rock 
And heave through the window-pane.

ALL DO IT. 
AS 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr. Jones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you ;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought, 
When he in self-defence was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world. 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen; 
And if they have a 
kiss ' twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean ; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un-
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple in the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the cats and dogs of all their mice; 
(1) 
.59 
T1-MY ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff " has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnupy nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
" 
News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

A 
PARODY ON " SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT GREEN." 
As originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
W HEN board at your house I 
take, darling, 
As long as my board I 
do pay, 
If Bridget is left there cooking the soup, 
For my sake drive her away. 
I 
mind not a 
small tooth comb to find, 
Tears in it she's shed I've seen ; 
But stop that small drop that comes from her nose, 
See that my soup's kept clean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my thanks will go to you, darling, 
When boarding no more I'll be seen, 
This one wish, Mrs. Murphy, do grant me, 
See that my soup's kept clean. 
I 
know you can cook a 
nice turkey, 
And sweet is the stuffing to taste, 
But I 
don't like to fish up a 
big cockroach, 
It's such a 
high flavored baste ; 
The rag which you scrub off the kitchen floor, 
To use on the dishes it is mean. 
This one wish you'll grant me, my darling, 
See that my plates are kept clean. 
Oh, my thanks, etc. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
And in the cold grave I 
do lie, 
See the mourners have plenty of whiskey to drink, 
Give the boys lots of old rye ; 
I 
mean when your hash has cooked my goose, 
Get it now thro' your thick skull, 
At my head when the candles are burning, 
See that the gang's kept full. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
sleep the sleep that knows no waking, 
Keep this now in your thick skull, 
At my head when the candles are burning, 
See that the gang's kept full.
