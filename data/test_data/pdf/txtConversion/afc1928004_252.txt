DEAR FRIENDS, and admirers of refined minstrelly—Be 
it known at large, that the old and popular firm of Dele-
hanty & Hengler, have dissolved partnership. for reasons 
best known to ourselves. 
We mutually agree. to disagrea, 
to separate and link our fates to others ; mine, henceforth, 
is associated with that of Mr. JAM S H. 
CUMMINGS, who, 
in my best judgment, 
deem the finest and most legiti-
mate Song and Dance. Artist in the world -- possessing, at 
once, the sweetest tenor voice easy, graceful and grotesque 
motion in dancing, a 
good form—and is, indeed, a 
natural 
Comedian. 
While, for myself, all the above qualities I 
claim to possess ; ' bift to what excellence or greatness I 
am 
gifted, I 
humbly leave•to a 
generous public to define. 
Myself and Mr. Cummings intend to open a 
new field to 
the many imitators of our popular line of business— such 
as Ethiopian Sketches, void of any approach to vulgarity, 
and possessing Gems of Song, Sparkling and Witty Dia-
logues, Artistic and LudICrous Dancing, .3firthful and Mar-
velous .3Iimicry.,&c. &c. 
Our joint efforts shall be to pro-
mote, rather than to degenerate America's original time-
honored performance of pure and legitimate minstrelly. 
During my fourteen. 
years experience in the minstrel pro-
fession, I 
can truthfully say that the greater part of that 
time has been devotdd to close study of-what would most 
amuse the masses, anti at the same time,. elevate the pro-
fession, which in my earlier days was searady considered 
respectable ; but, to-day, I 
am happy to knowdhat there is 
welcome and appreciation for pure and rvined,411instrelsy ; and 
as we are capable of originating inventing'and composing 
both words and music. We must be . ftlertilo novelties in 
keeping with "the spirit of the times," 
lways ready and apt 
to " shoot folly as it flies," representing pictures of the past 
and present, Negro life as it was and is. 
In thiS little vol-
ume of songs, we offer you many new and original gems 
never before published with a 
few of the most popula: 
ballads of the day; and we promise yon lots Of kool thugs 
in the future. 
The public's most humble and obedient 
servants,

INTRODUCTORY. 
By Wm. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
'Round and about the world 
This little book I 
send ; 
Bound in purple and gold, 
The scribblings I 
have penned ; 
My Hope, and Trust, and Pride, 
Go with it, side by side. 
My Hope—some hapless wight, 
Aweary, lone and drear, 
Be blessed with equal sight, 
To read a 
passage here, 
And find some simple part 
To cheer his saddened heart. 
My Trust—' twill not intrude 
In moments too sublime; 
But come as something good— 
Just in the nick of time— 
To drive away dull care, 
And bring sweet pleasure there. 
My Pride—comes at the end, 
When it has went the round, 
To know my little friend 
A 
kindly welcome found. 
That some, while gazing here. 
Did smile or drop a 
tear. 
VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW. 
Words and "Music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
This is DELEHANTY k CUMMINGS' Champion Song & Dance. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
'I he Sun had just gone down, 
Whi.e leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the btightest hlue, 
Beneath her dark eye- lashes, 
Like V.olets iipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, (Symph.) 
rut how it did enslave me, 
'I was love, the first I 
knew ; 
'1 here's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression. 
Like Violets clipped in dew. 
I 
followed on 13, hind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handk, r-hicf it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the g 
assy ground; 
Her name, in lettcr3 erimson, 
On one corner thc-re I 
found. 
6 
CHOR17S. 
She deigned to smile upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue ; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh ! I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
CHORUS. 
So arm in arm we wandered, 
Yes, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew.

Who lives in yonder lane,

'When she said—•' c'all again"----
Down in yonder lane—to-night— 
My pretty Ida Vane.

Oh ! charming little precious dear, (symph.) 
How I 
wish that she was -here, ) 
Oh! then we'd tale a 
quiet little walk 
Adowu the woodland grove, 
So leisurely we'll rove. 
And softly whiTer love. 
Birds will listen for to hear us talk, 
And when they sing again, 
Their song shall'be a 
song of love 
And pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh ! if you could only see her eyes, 
hey shine like stars at night, 
So beautiful and bright. 
With a 
dazzlii g

He shall not woo in vain 
For she's a • Flower of Paradise," 
My pretty Ida 'Vane.

Oh! see, the Moon is shining clear, 
The Stars are out at play— 
And sweetly did she say,

And ease my heart of pain, 
Why keep me longer waiting here,

HAPPY AS A 
CLAM. 
As sung by the "King Bees" DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
On a 
little old plantation, 
Where de light I 
first did see 
Down on de Swanee River, 
in de state of Florida ; 
Old Massa he was fat and good, 
And alwa .
vs used me r

And when id sing or dance for him, 
He'd scream , at with delight. 
Cnoiws. 
Oh, my ! I'm as Happy as it Clam, ( Symph.) 
I'm India Rubber Gutta Percha Gum Elastic Sam. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
When I 
left de old plantation 
This advice he gave to me : 
Don't never mix in politics, 
Or pity in Policy. 
So off I 
went just like a 
gun, 
And now I 
take my chance, 
In going around de town 
And for de white folks sing and dance. 
Oh, my! & c. 
I've danced for every nation, 
From de Dutch to de Chinese ; 
I've danced up hill and down again, 
And I 
danced upon the Seas ; 
But I 
know a 
little YaHow Gal, 
And her 
going to try; 
And I'll dance for her affections, 
Or I'll dance until I 
die. 
Oh, my! 
WHEN THE BELLS ARE RINGING 
As sung by DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
A 
story I 
will tell you, 
My heart is beating so, 
For love is such a 
funny thing; 
But that you all must know. 
The object of affeCtion 
That stole my heart away, 
Is a 
charming, darling little girl, 
I 
think you all will say. 
CHORUS. 
When the bells are ringing, 
Oh how happy I 
will be; 
Then I'll be married 
And she'll belong to me. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, 
For she often told me so ; 
And she's the sweetest and the neatest, 
Prettiest girl I 
know. 
But now I 
have to leave you, 
I 
know she's on the street ; 
I 
told her when we parted last 
The day that we should meet ; 
But if you doubt my story, 
And think she won't be mine, 
The wedding bells the sequel tells, 
The first day that is fine. 
When the bells, eic.

Words and Music by M. TUMBLERONICON O'REA_BDON, and 
Sung successfully by DELEHANTY S
I: CUMMINGS. 
Oh ! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of loo is o'er. 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last. 
And well meet as (ally strangers, 
In the future, evermore. 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall 
In spit3 of ail that I 
could do. 
For 
the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
Tay dream of love is o'cr, 
I 
try to smile wh, -I 
my heart aches with pain, 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me, 1io a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall 
see again. 
Oh ! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to fu-give and to forget, 
All the vows we pledged together 
By the r:ppliu3 of the tide, 
As 1 
1.)oked into your beauteous eyes—my Pet. 
An ! the heart is like the tides 
That flow and ebb at will ; 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could. 
So, thro' all the future years. 
1'11 love the fondly, dearly, darling ! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, &c.

SALLY BLESS MY SOUL, 
A. new song of " The Great Two," Diff.auite.Yrr & CUM-
MINGS. 
I'd like to know the reason why, 
As I 
go down the street 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every gin I 
meet ; 
I 
asked my cousin Sally once, 
Wli 
it was they smiled so sweet? 
She says, you are a 
perfect dunce, 
They are laughing at your feet. 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control 
And said when I 
coal l 
catch my breath, 
Oh ! Sally Bless my Soul. 
Of all the talents I 
possess, 
These feet they are my pri4 ; 
They are good sized, and cost me less 
To .valk with, than to ride ; 
They always take' me out of town 
A's fast as I 
can go; 
But Sally filled me with alarm, 
By talking to me O. 
I 
blushed, ST.c. 
Now, I've resolved to search this town 
For smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by ; 
I'11 get a 
smaller pair. I 
vow, 
Ant dress up in tlai 
style ; 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll LOW 
An I raise my Harvard tile. 
CHORUS. 
Then joy will hike the place of whet 
My anguish I'll control, 
And sin ,-;. ' till I 
ct ont of breath, 
Oh ! 
Sally fil:t-;-; my Soul. 
SHE'S ALWAYS IN MY MIND. 15 
DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS' New Act. 
For truth, I'm known both far and near. 
A 
story yet I'll tell ; 
A 
little white one, done in black, 
Of a 
girl that I 
know well ; 
Her charms— no matter -- they're beyond 
All words that 1 
can find ; 
For where I 
am, do what T 
can, 
She's always in my mind. 
CHORUS. 
And she says she loves a 
young man 
That wore a 
light moustache, 
A 
pretty little goatee, 
And also lots of cash. 
His hair was light and curly, 
He'd whiskers on the side ; 
And that's the hind of chap you know, 
Could have her for a 
bride. 
Now, I 
don't wear a 
light moustache, 
A 
goatee I 
can't sport ; 
If I 
wore whiskers on the side 
Of course they would be bought ; 
And ho v 
raise them I 
iTon't know— 
Or information find. 
Thit girl will thrive me crazy, yet, 
always in my mind. 
And she says; & c. 
I 
called on her the other day, 
1 
begged her for a 
smile ; 
She said, Oh no ! my youthful friend, 
You are not quite the st.lc ! 
But still, with all. it is not right, 
That I 
should he unkind. 
That girl will sonic day moo, be mine ; 
So 
keep her'in iny mind. 
And she says, &c.

MY DEW DROP PEARL. 
By Wm. H. DELEHANTT. 
As sung by DELMAN= S
:; CIIMMINGg. 
Yes, they ask me why I 
always seem so happy, 
And they criticize my gay and airy style, 
Eut they know not how I 
love a 
litde beauty ; 
I'm swimming in the sweetness of her smile, 
Little angels seem to hover ail around me, 
While the birds direct to me their joyous lay, 
And the fish within the streamlet play to please me, 
Since I 
met this little flower, Lilly May. 
Cllollus. 
More lovely than the bl.)oming rose, 
The dew drop pearl within ; 
And constant as the stream that flows, 
A 
precious prize to win. 
There's a 
band of angels singing in her laughter, 
And a 
cupid merry making in her eye ; 
With a 
shyness like the pearl I 
named her after, 
Recollection of her beauty brings a 
sigh ; 
But she said she always wished to see me happy, 
Would help to ease my days of care and strife, 
And a 
sweeter, dearer vow she lately made me, 
'Twas her willingness to share my future life. 
Mo-re lovely, & c.

Through the Woods we Wandered. 
Written and composed by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Little Maud and I ; 
Leisurely meandered, 
Giving sigh for sigh. 
Blithe and merry-hearted, 
Arm-in-arm we went ; 
All our loves imparted, 
Blest with sweet content. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Lovely Maud and me ; 
But awhile we pondered, 
Near a 
shady tree. 
There she turned and faced me, 
Something sweet to say ; 
Trustingly embraced me, 
In her tender way. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Maud and I 
alone ; 
Where a 
brook rau onward, 
Making gentle moan. 
We had pulled two posies, 
Bound them side by side ; 
When we made proposes. 
Threw them in the tide. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
While the little stream ; 
Pore these pledges onward, 
Bonds of our love dream. 
Secret vows we plighted, 
Sacred love and faith ; 
Like those flowers united, 
Ever until Cieatli.

Through the World We Wander. 
Written and composed by W . 
II. 
DELEHANTY. 
Thro' the world we wander, 
Maud and I 
apart ; 
No one now will wonder, 
At my broken heart. 
Every joy I 
cherished, 
Dreams too sweet to last; 
All the love I 
nourished, 
Perished in the past. 
Thro' the world we wander, 
Each a 
different way ; 
She is over yonder, 
Where I 
never stray. 
Ever since her marriage, 
Si ace her hand she sold, 
Passes iii her carriage, 
Haughty, proud and cold. 
Thro' the world we wander, 
Poverty she scorns ; 
She has flowers of splendor, 
have only thorns. 
Sonic one said she loved him 
No ! it was his gold ; 
Falsely bath she proved theru, 
-Vows she pledged of old. 
Thro' the world we wander, 
Each a 
different way ; 
Maud in wealth and splendor, 
I ' neath sorrows lay. 
Thro' the world we wander, 
Here I'm pleased to be ; 
Leaving Lei; to ponder, 
Far, far away from me.

She took me by the hand, 
She said, I

My love was good and strong, 
I

POLLY ANN. 
AT a 
fancy ban trio otner 
My Polly Ann and me 
Was dressed to death in all our best, 
So happy, light and free, 
When Pompey Smash, a 
colored moke, 
Came rushing in the hall, 
And swore that none could dance with Poll, 
There at the fancy ball. 
CHORUS. 
Strike up the fiddle, 
And let the banjo ring, 
Join in the chorus, 
While merrily we sing; 
Let all the darkeys quarrel, 
For I'm a

All in this song and dance. 
My Polly Ann, she looked at me, 
And then she gave a 
sigh, 
While Pompey Smash, he shook his fist, 
With vengeance in his eye. 
kissed my hand to Polly Ann, 
The leader gave a 
call, 
Away went Pompey with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all. 
Strike up the, &c.

While Polly shouted hot corn. 
Whar the summer breeze blows, 
But now they have retired.

For Pompey has made his flu-tune, 
And gone to Baltimore.

Written and composed by W. H. DELEIIANTY. 
Oh, let me speak, departing soul, 
E'er gone to ne'er return ; 
That I 
may tell my wicked life 
r1'0 whom it may concern. 
It may, pet- chance, clo some one good, 
And no one any harm ; 
But block the rfad that leads to ruin, 
Wrought by fair woman's charm. 
'1 he maiden, pure in innocence, 
Unknown to care and strife, 
May learn what comes of ignorance, 
To blast an holy life. 
And find a 
moral in this tale ; 
For I 
was once as pure 
snow, that scarce of Heaven fell 
But I 
am pure no more. 
I 
never knew a 
mother's love, 
Nor felt her tender care ; 
For she did give her life for me— 
Neer blest me with a 
prayer. 
Though I 
was reared religiously, 
Was educated well, 
And moved in high society, 
01 which I ' ,lush to tell. 
Blush, said I? not blush, oh, no, 
I 
lost that with my name ; 
And now but feel a 
justly throe, 
As one deluged in shame. 
I 
heard him promise faith and love, 
To share my life as well. 
In ignorance I 
sealed my fate, 
And so, .alas, I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his door, 
And. cruel words he said ; 
My sisters dared not speak to me, 
So from the right I 
fled. 
Oh, curses on the promises 
That brightened all the way ; 
And false-eyed. be that honeyed tongue 
That sweetened me astray. 
,N101ZAL. 
Oh, innocence! oh, ignorance! 
Oh, youth! beware, beware! 
The path of love is beautiful, 
But ever hath a 
snare. 
E'en though 'tis decked with roses, 
'1 he light of love adorns ; 
Remember, where the flowers are, 
There's sure to be some thorns.

DANCING ON THE BRAIN. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
OF all the nigs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a

But Fll carve my way to glory, oh, with dancing on the brain.

There's a

From whomever can it be? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray ; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And send a 
loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And speed the loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh ! superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head; 
When 'those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away 
Bright spark, &e. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months, no more, 
Since a

Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger, 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be.

THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
• 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay ; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away! 
He was great, (43 
• 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor ; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, Jzr 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &a. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet ; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, &c, 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all?

The ivy twining round thy door, 
The sweet perfume of flow'rs in bloom, 
Are loves ot thee which I 
adore; 
When last we met can I

The kindly tear your eye fill'd o'er, 
And I 
was blind with feelings kind— 
But sad to part with Maud De Moore. 
Thou hast my heart, &c.

The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I

May tread it3 dear paths o'er again, 
And may it come across the foam, 
The joy that reaches my heart's core, 
To know you'll meet me at the gate, 
As loving as in days of yore. 
Thou hast my heart, &c.

My name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terrence is his name ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And he calls it a " super," and a " slang," 
Oh! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CHORUS. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning. 
And he'll give the door the devil's own banF 
Oh! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since 'ferry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home last Thursday night, 
Sure I 
talked to him very nice; 
When he said old man! you're getting too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on ice 1 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh! her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
He'll come rolling home, &c. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until night; 
And if the policeman says, " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite. 
Be went to the market only yesterday, 
And there he stole a 
big ham 
And he got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang !" 
He'll come rolling home Sze. 
GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
As sung by SoL Sffrra ROSS-P.M. 
Oh, dear! I'm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat, 
I 
fancy myself carving; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use ; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose 
Crionts. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingun; 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
goose with sage and ingun. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is my opinion, ite, 
I've liver tried, and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and tried; 
A 
sheep's-head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling, 
And fish-balls joy produce ; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to goose 
For it ic my opinion, 1±0.

MY LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSES, 
Words and Music by W. H. 
DELEMINTY. 
I 
AM waiting here to meet my darling, 
And my heart is in a 
flutter of delight, 
For we kissed last night when we were parting, 
And this is where she bid me come to-night. 
When away from her I 
am so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do, 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Her heart is warm and true. 
Oh ! 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush to hide, 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell; 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And dark blue is the color of her eyes, 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy days of childhood, 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle, 
By a 
streamlet running through the wild wO0(1, 4 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. ' 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of summers, sweet sixteen, 
And Is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A 
fawn-like, fairy citled 
Oh 
Now I 
meet her almost every evening, 
And I 
think it is the sweetest thing in life, 
For to walk with the flower of my affection, 
Especially when she's soon to be my wife, 
There is something, 4:e. 
'Twas an evening when the moon was shining, 
The little stars were twinkling far above, 
Arm- in-arm we were walking in the garden, 
'Twas then and there we both revealed our love. 
So I 
asked her then if she would take me, 
For better or for worse, 
When she smiled on me so very sweetly, 
And answered, " Yes, of course; Oh!" 
I 
confess that I 
never was so happy, 
Nor do I 
t 
rank that ever I 
could be, 
Till I've married my little bunch of roses, 
With a 
little bunch of roses on my knee I 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell; 
In her hair she wears a

Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name; 
We used to gather Buchu leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same.

This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu; 
We are happy Hottentots. 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots,

Day time, night time, always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go,

Written by W M, 11, DELEnArrY. 
ALL alone and sad hearted, 
A 
waif on -
the s'Lreet, 
With no one to pity me, 
No friend t'Imeet, 
I 
think of my playmates. 
And stories they told— 
Of poor, homeless orphans, 
Left out in the cold. 
CHor.us. 
Out in the cold, out in the coil, 
Motherless, Fatherless, oat in the cold. 
I 
note the smile sadden, 
O'er burdened iv grief. 
They only look pity. 
But give no relief. 
Oh ! why can't the passers by--
Goodness unfold, 
The gift of one penny 
Saves many from cold. 
Out in the cold, &e. 
Tho' life may be lovely, 
And happiness dear, 
Grim death cold and lonely, 
Dark, dismal alla drear. 
My poor heart is breaking, 
With sorrows untold, 
And death holds a 
sweetness. 
I'm out in the cold. 
Out in the cold, 
PRETTY LITTLE JESSIE, 
Written and Composed by Wm. II. DELEnANTY. 
OH! have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the sum v' 
her smile VOUin sct you crazy, 
With hair and eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd trent' de with delight, 
And deem it . di an honor— 
Her sweet fa, '' lushino-
Oh ! you should seo my pretty little Jessie, 
Her beauty :Thames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily- — 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
C110111::-. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancing, 
Oh may the joy of ife forever bless thee, 
Lovely queen of every rose, 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop in the rose-bud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes; 
Oh 1 
who would dare to crush her 
A 
swcet and tcndcr 
And who would dare to hush her, 
'While singing in her bower, 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song. 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd sit there all day long. 
My heart, tte, 
I 
sometimes think that I 
am going crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white-cap daisy, 
Its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is then friend. 
This evening her and I 
were in the garden— 
When I 
my suite (
lia press; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She blushingly answered, yes. 
My heart, Ice.

NOW everybody wonders Pm so happy,— 
They criticize my gay and airy style, 
But if they new the petty little beauty 
That thro' at me tie sweetness of her smile. 
I'm sure they would' _% wonder I 
was airy, 
Nor think that De in any way to blame 
When I 
say I 
gave my heart up to a 
fairy— 
Yes, '"Little Fairy Dew Drops" is her name. 
CHORUS 
Oh I 
yes, she's like a 
fairy, 
Blithesome and airy— 
Pouting lips of cherry 
Smiling when we meet. 
Bright eyes when they view me, 
Piercing thro' and thro' me, 
Perfectly under me, 
Dew Drop is so sweet. 
One Bummer's day we went a 
picking berries, 
So ripe and running wild upon the hill, 
How carelessly we trod Tiaon the daisies 
80 anziouz were we then the pril to 
And when the pail was full we sat and rested, 
'Twas just because I 
said she needed rest— 
And oh! how very sweet the berries tasted 
With little Dew Drop leaning on my breast. 
Oh! yes, &c. 
I 
told her then my life was very lonesome, 
And bluntly asked her woiid she he my wife, 
And tho' I 
said, I 
knew I 
was'nt handsome, 
Still, I 
hoped with love to bless her all her life; 
" 
She answered yes," when we were homeward turning, 
Thro' fields where corn was waving high above 
While I 
think to hug or kiss we were a 
learning, 
And no one heard our gentle tale of love.

ROGUISH EMA.LINE, 
Written by W. 
II. DELEII&NTT. 
I'M as happy as the birds in Spring-time, 
That warble in the air, 
While they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of the world they little care. 
So, that's the very wa5- I'm feeling, 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I'm in love as you can plainly see, 
With:a captivating roguish little belle. 
CHORUS. 
We first met In the Summer, 
Down by a 
running stream, 
And upon my sacred honor, 
It seems to be a 
dream. 
But I 
love her as you may suppose, 
She's one of sweet sixteen, 
And as pretty as the red red rose, 
Is the roguish little beauty, Ema 
Now of all the pretty girls I 
know of, 
There's none so sweet and fair, 
For her eyes are like a 
bright sun-beam, 
And a 
light-brown is the color of her hair. 
I 
received a 
billet-doux this morning, 
From one hi love I 
ween, 
Which has made me happy all day long, 
'Twas from the little beauty, Emaline 
We first met, &c. 
In her note she said she wished to see me, 
If the weather it lie fine, 
So, this night I'm going to meet my love, 
As I 
live in hopes to make this beauty mine. 
She's the darling of my heart and dearer, 
Than all on earth beside, 
And my happiness will be complete, 
When I 
take this little beauty for my bride.

YES, I

Thou art gentle, kind and true, 
Surely, always its my duty, 
To think fondly love, of you. 
When I 
read your loving letter, 
happy thoughts run thro' my brain, 
Thinking of a 
brighter future, 
hoping soon to meet again. 
CHORUS. 
Come at seven, said her letter, 
Sunday even' g, don't delay, 
Pa and Ma will both be absent, 
And will be some time away. 
At a 
fancy hall I 
met her, 
Whirling in the mazy dance, 
Sweeping to the Danube river, 
Till my heart she did entrance, 
Even now, I 
see her Nvaltzhe ,, 
Hear the music rise or fall, 
All the petople round me talking, 
Calling her " Belle of the ball." 
Come at seven, &c. 
When I 
got an introduction, 
And engaged her for the dance, 
Then I 
paid her great devotion, 
Glad indeed to have a 
chance. 
And as night had long since left us. 
Faintly gleamed the dawn of day. 
Love had now of fear bereft us, 
As the night shades passed away. 
Come at,seven,

BESSY DOON: 
The Sweetest of Them All; 
Written and ('ornposed by Wx. 11. DELEFIVATT. 
011! I 
know a 
little maiden, 
By the name of " Bessy Doon," 
And by invitation I 
am going to call; 
And my heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushed and said she loved me best of all; 
And she looked just as charming--
As the flowers In May, 
Or a 
peach ripe, ready for to fQ 11, 
Oh! I 
couldn't see the harm in— 
Giving her my heart to-day, 
ForiI really think she's the sweetest of them all.

Oh! tell me why—you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly, 
Or do you know on whom I'm going to ealL 
While merrily on every tree 
The little birdies sing to me,— 
Bessie is the sweetest girl of all. 
Now I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
And I 
never gave it any heed at all! 
Cupid a 
quiver struck my heart and 
Wrote a 
verse beginning with— 
Oh I 
Bessy is the sweetest girl of all; 
TI len I 
felt just as happy 
As a 
big sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall. 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty, 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bessy Doon the best of alL 
Oh! tell me why, (
te. 
Oh! I 
can no longer linger, 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hope to meet you all some day again; 
And if Bessy is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport 
I 
It bring her here to sing a 
sad refrain. 
She will sing a 
sad farewell 
To the nol)hy little chaps--
That ( lance ill attendance to her call; 
My adieu to every belle,

misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparatle Iron). Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy -Temple. 
It is it sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
, 
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
1
 mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
I " the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
I It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take k'vay." . It contrasts in 
living colors the ri.-.3liesi fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rait- resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold. the reader in rapt attention to the end.

A little book has 1

cannot 
inty that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
re we think it would a.ily encourage the bad habit of " flirting.' 
Vnfortnnately there is enough of it done without any further neotl% 
aity of explaining 'how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
rolume would advise and initiate the uneorrupted in practising what 
L3commonly called "flirting."

We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
., 
14 cents, "ailed "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher tk 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mains oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there 2.8 nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitata to recommend it to out 
young lady and gen tl emen

THE APPRENTICE, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER, BYRNE. 
2mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on prItical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 185`,1 to 1664, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical nit,chanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics ; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of' work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
rile author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a work 
of reference. 
ilost ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in still cloth covers.
