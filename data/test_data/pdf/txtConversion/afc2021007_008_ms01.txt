1:55-2:00:00 
Resentful of emphasis on money. Fish are not money, marvelous bounty of 
beautiful, wild natural creatures.  Focus on money is low way to think about 
fishing.   Advice to new fishermen, get on good boat, work hard, stay away from 
drugs and alcohol, save money.  Encourage people to start small.  Biggest 
challenge facing fisheries is climate change.  Mismanagement of fisheries, 
declining stocks that should be abundant.

Trying to work within federal fisheries management, dominated by corporate 
fisheries.  Managers and decision makers don’t listen to small scale fishermen

2:05-2:07:24

changes to protect the environment, or respond to climate change.
