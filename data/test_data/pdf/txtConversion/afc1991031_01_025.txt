Field Notes - Barbara Orbach 
CO80-BO-FN 8/18/80 
Day 1—18 August, 1980 
Arrival in Frisco, Colorado. Met at bus station by 
John Farr. 
Orientation lunch with Rusty Marshall, Elke Dettmer, 
and her friend, Eben Stromquist. Rusty described the 
germination of the project, which took place at an ALHFAM 
meeting in 1979. There member John Farr introduced himself 
as a person interested in starting up a living history 
museum based in well-researched local history in his own 
region of Colorado. As their discussion progressed, the 
idea^fo^tSe museum dcvolope*fc^ixLto--cg»s composed of a working 
ranch from the period around the turn of the century and a 
mine--both representative of the economy and lifestyle of 
the area comprised by Grand and Summit counties. 
Rusty's tasks on this trip, as he explained it, are to 
demonstrate the field techniques used by folklife researchers 
and to generate local interest by explaining the project 
to possible sponsoring agencies such as the local Rotarians. 
After lunch John Farr gave us a jeep tour of the parts 
of the two counties we will primarily be concerned with. 
The tour started at Dillon Reservoir. Here he introduced 
an issue that would recur throughout the tour: water. The 
reservoir supplies water to Denver, as well as serving 
recreational purposes. 
The area below the reservoir on Route 9 going north used 
to be meadow land used for cultivation hay. As Farr recounted, 
ranching grew up only as a satellite to the mining industry 
in this region in an era of supply difficulties and heavy 
CO80-BO-FN 8/18/80 
-2- 
freight expenses. It was the development of irrigation that 
allowed ranching to prosper and continue as a relatively 
profitable enterprise until the 1950's. During the '60's 
and increasingly now, the land formerly devoted to meadow 
is too valuable for development purposes to continue as such. 
The single main problen when contemplating starting up a ranch, 
however, is in obtaining sufficient water rights to make it 
wo r k <d» 1 jL ^ 
We drove up the the AMAX (Climax?) "Henderson" mine, 
where molybdenum, a mineral used for hardening metals, is 
mined. Farr stressed the uniqueness of the mineral--one of ' 
the few the U.S. is enough in excess of to expofct—and the 
ecological soundness of the mine. The mine employs about 
4,000 people in the area. 
Continuing past the mine, we passed through a wide valley 
with much meadowland and two or three apparently quite 
old ranching complexes. Most of the hay appeared to be 
already cut and stacked, but just beyond the Williams1 Fork 
Reservoir ( a back-up reserve for local water supplies) were 
able to watch a group stacking hay in what Rusty and John 
refer to as an "overshot" or "beavertail" stacker. This is 
a fairly loose form of piling the hay in a small enclosed 
area compacted by a wooden pole frame. The operation involved 
four people, one driving a machine that combed the hay into 
long rolls, two driving old tractors that scooped up the hay 
and placed it in mounds, and another pushing the hay up 
the slanted gate and onto the top of the stack. The meadow 
where this took place in the vicinity of Troublesome.

We returned by way of Kremmling, along Route 9 south 
to Green Mountain Reservoir, along its west bank through Heeny 
and back to Frisco. 
Dinner with John and Leslie Farr at their home. Leslie 
told us about her background: she moved to Colorado from 
Florida, taught school in North Denver, met and married 
John Farr ten years ago in Boulder and moved with him to 
Frisco 9 years ago. 
John Farr sells insurance in Fisco, is also involved 
in community affairs and has a strong interest and an 
expertise in local history. He writes a column on that 
subject in the local newspaper, and is known as J.D. "Colorado" 
Farr. He and Leslie have spent the last six years building 
their three story log home.

Drove to Kremmling for shopping and look around. Noted 
wood structure across from park on left as one faces it and 
"smithie" structure. Lunch at Grand Old West Restaurant, 
(clientele seemed mostly locals; all had cleared out by the 
time we left at 1:30 p.m.) 
CO80-BO-FN 8/18/80

Visit to the McKee ranch ("Old Johnson Place"). 
Elke and I talked with and recorded Mrs. Loma Rae McKee and 
her sister-in-law, Dsris McKee abo^ut their personal and 
family histories and their experiences of ranch and community 
life. (Tape incomplete due to technical difficulties) 
Loma indicated that the term "ranch" could only be 
loosely applied to their situation. Dick and Loma McKee 
own jointly with I.W. and Vera McKee 44 acres of what used 
to be the "Old Johnson Place", which was sold to Blue River 
Highlands Corporation who then sub-divided it and sold 
it 'in lots. While Dick and Loma run an excavating business, 
I.W. (who also runs a dump truck business) and Vera do the 
ranching, utilizing land leased across the highway to pasture 
cattle they tend for a rancher in Lyman. Colo. 
phofos: 
corc-e>c-i/i-i Interesting aspects of Loma's experience of living with 
her husband, two children and her in-laws in Silverthorne 
(the community they identify as their home) that emerged during 
our discussion were: 
1.) Her experiences with high altitude cooking. Cooking 
takes much longer at this altitude. Loma uses a 
pressure cooker to cook many foods because it is 
so much faster. She and her mother-in-law preserve 
some vegetables for the winter by canning. They 
drive down to Pueblo and but the Vegetables (the 
growing season is too short to grow most vegetables 
here), canning them in glass jars with metal rim 
lids when they get them here—a process that goes 
on for days. Loma noted that vegetables such as 
-5- 
green beans are more risky to can than tomatoes 
because they don't have any acid in them. She 
uses the pressure cooker to can the vegetables, and 
she recounted one anecdote about how a jar of 
tomatoes exploded when she lifted the pressure cooker 
lid. She said the tomatoes ended up all over everything. 
Now she's always very cautious about opening the 
pressure cooker, putting on several layers of 
coats for protection, she noted laughingly. They 
freeze okra for later use 
When asked if they preserve fruits as well, Loma 
explained that, as most of the fruit comes from 
Grand Junction, upless someone they know is driving 
through and can pick some up, it is just too long a 
drive to be worthwhile. 
Loma said they buy some pork, but not much 
beef from the local grocery sotres, because it is 
is too expensive. She said that her husband, Dick, 
normally shoots an elk every year, which provides 
them with meat through the winter. She then mentioned 
hunting licenses and that Dick was lucky enough this 
year to draw a license to shoot a male elk, which 
is more difficult to obtain than licnses to shoot 
females. This would provide them with more meat; 
unfortunately, although Dick enjoys hunting, he 
is too busy now vith the excavating business to 
take time out to do it. 
We asked how the/ had the elk dressed and butchered. 
CO80-BO-FN 8/19/80 
-6- 
She said they had once had it done for them by a 
butcher, but it didn't come back "clean", so now 
they do it themselves. They skin the carcass, carve 
it up using no special cutting technique, rinse it 
under running water in their kitchen, and freeze it. 
This was a piscess she learned by trial-and error. I 
asked her if she did anything with the hide. She 
said no, they just throw it away, although she and 
her mother-in-law have said they should try to tan it. 
Loma stated that although she cohid never shoot an 
animal, butchering it does not bother her. 
2.) Perspectives on family and community life 
Both Loma and Doris agreed that they lead a 
pretty isolated existence here; they don't watch 
television not do they take a paper, and they generally 
find out about news three days;after it happens by 
hearing about it in town; for example, they only 
heard about the eruption of the volcano, Mt. St. Helens, 
in eastern Washington when they noticed white ash 
drifting down to the ground and asked someone in 
town about it. 
They don't consider themselves very involved in 
the community. This is partly because its inhabitants 
are seasonal--few stay through the winter. In their 
opinioni "money" (i.e. monied interests) run the 
community; Loma expressed her resentment that the 
county can tell them what they can and can't do 
C080-BO-FN 8/19/80 
-7- 
on their own property. (Loma and Dick are awaiting 
permission to move their mobile home to a different 
site on the property.) Loma and Dick send their 
two children to the Frisco school rather than to 
Sliverthorne. This had something to do with the 
respective bus schedules, but Loma also mentioned 
that she preferred the Frisco schools for academic 
reasons. 
Because so many family members live on or near the 
property (three of the McKee siblings and their 
families are staying here temporarily) and they 
are in constant communication (the older McKees' 
phone is even connected to ring in Dick and Loma's 
house as well so that they can answer if no one is 
home next door), they do not get lonely. Doris mentioned 
that when she would phone from New York# if no one 
answered, she would become very concerned, because 
it was so unusual for no one to be home. Indeed, 
both Doris and Loma indicated that the communal arrangement 
can get wearing at times, that sometimes they long 
for some time alone. Loma stated early in the interview 
that "You can't get away from in-laws here I" 
The family gets together regularly for potlucks, 
usually on Friday nights, and usually with some kind 
of theme such as Mexican food or fish. (They mentioned 
that it is'Ma ’Kee" that likes to fish, but she seldom 
does it unless Dick goes along, and he has been too 
busy.) 
Loma's parents live in Colorado (Buena Vista?) 
CO80-BO-FN 8/19/80 
-8- 
but she doesn't see tfelSm too regularly. Both Doris 
and Loma mentioned vacationing (separately) with 
the McKee relatives in Texas almost annually. 
3.) Recreational activities 
Loma mentioned a relay horse race (three relay 
stops with anywhere from one to three riders participating) 
that "they" (Dick, a sibling, and a neighbor riding) 
were in recently. It was followed by a barbecue and 
dance. It was attended by local people—most of whom 
they knew—and was "real fun". 
They doy( not attend the rodeo in Kremmling. In 
fact, Kremmling is too far away for most of their 
activities. 
Doris spoke enthusiastically about dancing. She 
mentioned that I.W. (her father) "teaches" (i.e. calls?) 
as Slate Creek Schoolhouse on Ttm^rsday nights. Lvery 
other Friday there is a dance in Kremmling. On 
Friday nights they go dancing in Dillon at "D.I." 
(old Dillon Inn). Doris distinguished between the 
dancing events. Thursday and every other Friday nights 
are just square dancing. Usually only I.W. goes— 
even "Ma ’Kee" doesn't always go, because she can't 
dance, as I.W. is occupied with calling. Friday 
nights at "D.I." are "just dancing" (i.e. informally 
to a country-and-western band) 
4.) McKee family history 
C080-B0-FN 8/19/80 
iaHt^iCva/ rtf or* ?Orm 
-9- 
While Doris was giving us information for an 
interview report form, she started to recount an anecdote 
about her great-great grandfather! being killed in 
a shootout. We later came back to it and she and 
Loma tried jointly to put together the details 
of this ancestor, a Choctaw Indian who followed the 
"Trail of Tears" when the tribe was removed to 
Oklahoma Territory. His name was Smallwood, He 
became some sort of peace officer in Oklahoma Territory 
and was killed in a shoot-out (Doris was careful to 
say these might not be the true detfeils, implying 
that the facts might have been cleaned up over the 
generations). His wife died in childbirth either 
three weeks before of" three weeks afterwards, 
leaving their son to be adopted by his aunt Mary 
Smallwood McKee, which is how they come by the 
family name. 
Doris brought out a gramed copy of a newspaper 
clipping from a 1930's edition of an Oklahoma 
paper recounting aspects of the tale. A clean, 
typewritten copy done by Doris is also available. 
5.) Former name for the ranch: the "Old Johnson Place". 
Ed Johnson is still alive, they believe, and living

I.W, MeKee pulled in in his dump truck as we were leaving. 
Dinner in Breckenridge at the Gold Post Restaurant with 
Rusty, Elke, and Eben. 
Father Dyer Community Church—historical pageant. Vignettes 
from the life of Father William Dyer, itinerant preacher in 
the region of Breckenridge ca. 1880. Written by local 
author using Dyer's autobiography, Snowshoe Itinerant, and 
the work of former pastor, Mark Feister as sources. Performed 
by the community theater group. Very well attended, apparently 
mostly by community members, who gave it and its author a 
very favorable response. 
CO%o- Bo-<-3 
Debriefing (reviewing the activities of the day--mostly 
the interview with the McKees and the technical difficulties)

recorder) with Rusty Marshall.

-11- 
family (women mostly gathered in the parents' home, son-in-law 
Wes repairing equipment in the yard) what the day's 
activities were to be. Those present were: Vera McKee, 
daughters Mary (whom we at first assumed to be Doris as 
they resemble each other closely), Doris and Vera, sow-in-law 
Wes Dunaway, children Cheri, Cori, Rodney, Michael (and 
one other--julia?) belonging to the various McKee siblings. 
They did a sort of quick roll call, assigning themselves 
tasks: (mother) Vera irrigating, Wes cutting wood, Doris 
hauling wood, Mary staying at the house, from what Iocould 
understand. Daughters. Mar] and Vera (Dunaway--Wesr wife) 
were new acquaintances whose identities we didn't sort out 
until later in the day. 
Rusty and I accompanied Vera McKee ("Ma ’Kee") to 
the hay meadows across the road, leased by them from Wheaton 
College. As we drove her and her dog, Killer, up in our 
vehicle, we clarified some information. 
The McKee family moved up to Colorado from Texas

her irrigating tasks and took ufi on a walk along a 
ditch outlet from Boulder Creek. Rusty collected 
flora specimens as we walked. Vera left us in the 
"upper" hay meadow. Rusty recorded an old log structure-- 
an animal shelter he believed—while I attempted to nurse 
my Rollei camera, which was suffering from a jammed shutter, 
Returned to the McKee ranch buildings.-' On the way 
back down to the highway we met Wes Diinaway, who was 
finishing up the wood cutting and breaking for lunch. 
As we came out towards the highway, Rusty noticed an 
old seeder abandoned in the field oniour left which he 
wished to remember. 
Kike 
Lunch in Kremmling. aObtained the phone number of 
Olga Hill, a contact suggested by Loma McKee because 
Ms. Hill's family once owned mucn of the ranching land 
in the Valley. Elke tried to phone, but there was no 
answer. 
Briefly observed the layout of the central area 
of Kremmling around the' the city park which is represented'! 
on Sanborn's Insurance map of 1914. Noticed a log livery 
stable, the old hotel (green with a false front, now 
part of it is used by the Masonic Lodge), Dan Hoare's 
"Village Smithie", and some back alley log structures. 
Noted that all were tagged and dated, presumably as 
historical landmarks, suggesting that some historical 
research has already been done on the town buildings. 
-13- 
Karl Knorr'a ranch. Knorr is a contact suggested by 
John Farr. The house and barn complex contains a number 
of log structures. Rusty met Mrs. Knorr at the house. 
We met Mr. Knorr, his brother George, Mrs. Enders (lives 
in the white house across the road; her family ranched 
in the area before scfte was torn) in the hay field where 
they, with one other worker, were stacking hay using a 
beaver tail stacker. After many photographs and a brief 
chat with Knorr and Mrs. Enders, Rusty arranged to return 
Friday to watch them put up "green hay" in the next meadow 
over.

Architecture lesson--recording assayor's cabin, Tiger 
Road, with Rusty Marshall. Learned the techniques cf 
photographing a building for recording purposes, and of 
how to look at a building and transcribe its features into 
floorplan and notes for ture reference. 
This babin seems to have seen much use, even recently, 
as there was much trash lying around both the interior 
and the exterior. A rusted vehicle of some ©stt lay 
outside the door of the reaf addition. Interesting (unexplained) 
features were a rectangular window set with the long 
edge parallel and quite near to the floor in the rear 
half of the structure, and the suggestion of a formal, 
movable entrance to the upper loft area. We speculated 
as to why the front half of the building had been more 
roughly buil^ft than the rear, as suggested by the chinking, 
flporing and ceiling quality. Perhaps the front portion 
had been the business portion, the rear the living quarters? 
C080-B0-FN' 8/20/80

(Or vice versa?) As we left, Rusty uncovered a tattered 
canvas bag, possibly for carrying ore to be assayed. 
This building has been acqdred by the Summit County 
Historical Society for preservation on a different site. 
Dinner at home with Elke. 
Day 4—21 August, 1980 
Discovered mechanical bungle with the Minolta--two 
black and white rolls probably no good. 
Morning meeting at Farr home with Rusty and Elke. Ron

pkch>s-.co»5-Bo nj-vsT/cfi \i) visit to Summit County Historical Society Museum 
(403 La Bonte, Dillon, Colo. 468-6079). 
Examined artifacts lying in7 the front yard: remnants 
of an old plow, axle to a wagon. In the side yard: wooden-staved 
pipe, a fire engine? a buckboard with an extra spring 
and decorative woodwork edging (so far in a state of 
disreapair. 
Continued around to the back of the restored sbhoolhouse 
that houses the museum, glancing only briefly at a 
cabin (vintage 1920?) that looks as if it has just been 
moved to the site and’is in an early stage of restoration. 
We aoncentrated on the log house facing it. We photographed.

measured and recorded the building, as well as commenting 
on the restoration technique, which was faulty at various 
points; for example, something other than the appropriate 
broadaxe or adze had been used on replacment logs in 
an effort to imitate the hewn shaping of the original 
logs, while new log access-ways leading under the house 
and new log slab siding on the old rear addition loudly 
proclaimed the recent restoration work. b-ci

Ms. Rebecca Waugh, who supervises the museum (her 
.title?) joined us briefly as we worked. She exchanged 
credentials with Rusty--she has museum training and 
formerly worked in an art museum--and expressed some 
interest in our work. She invited us to look at the 
indoor exhibits when we were tnrougn outside. 
The inside of the museum, like the outside, is 
obviously in a state of flux. The building is a restored 
schoolhouse that was rescued from the Dillon town site 
before it was flooded by the reservoir. The interior 
space consists of one large and one medium-sized room 
plus a 2 or 3 room addition for offices, restrooms and 
storage. 
The large front room is complete; it is restored as 
a classroom ca. 1884--dominated by rows of old schooldesks, 
front blackboards and mannequin student and teacher 
positioned in stances to evoke an educational atmosphere. 
Lining the edges of the room are collections ranging 
from an old iron stove and coal bin, to a washstand 
sporting linen towels and homemade soap, to a reconstructed 
CO80-BO-FW 8/21/80 
-16- 
kitchen witn canned products and utensils artfully arranged 
on the table. Interspersed with these were glass exhibit 
cases containing clothing, memorabilia from schooldays 
(e.g. programs from graduation exercises), stereoscopes, etc. 
In the front as one walks in the door is a large round table 
witn a display of pamphlets and postcards copied from 
historical photographs of the region, on sale to the visiting 
public. 
A large display on one side of the room supplied information 
abut the restored cabin we had recorded outside. It had been 
removed intact from a site in Montezuma, where it had 
been huilt in 1885 by the husband of Lulu Myers, a local school 
teacher. The cabin is referred to as the "Lulu Myers cabin". 
According to tne photographs in the news clippings, the original 
back shed addition did not nave log slab siding. 
Tne rear room of tne museum was in disarray, with kitchen 
equipment, farm implements, mining tools, riding equipment, 
and blacksmithing tools all stored in unordered proximity to 
one another, presumably awaiting exhibition space. 
We quickly photographed what we could cf the museums's 
interior, purchased some postcards, and bajte Ms. Waugh 
good-bye (she was occupied with a middle-aged woman who had 
come in on historical society business). 
By putting together what information we had gathered 
from Ms. Waugh, we concluded that she works on the local paper 
as well as running the museum. 
Stopped at the "Junktique", a thrift store in Frisco, 
CO80-BO-FN 8/21/80 
-17- 
located m a two story structure with side ell, the front 
walls built with hewn logs, the rear portions with unhewn logs. 
Aside from an assortment of cast-off clothes and utensils, it 
offered a few rusted nails and implements that the proprietress 
said they had acquired in an estate sale when they had bought the 
building. She indicated that they would be aoving shortly, 
as the building had been sold (to the Historical Society?). 
Returned to Farrs' for lunch. Straightened up film and 
tape deposits, packaged flora and fauna from McKee hay meadow 
8/20/80. 
Returned to intern house, worked on field notes.

Vera McKee appeared about 9 p.m. 
Vera McKee and Mrs. White were wearing spuare-dance 
dresses, one other woman wore a skirt, and the other women 
dressed casually in slacks. 
Elke and I spoke to Vera Dunaway about the dresses. 
She indicated that all own them, oyt mostly wear them for 
the special occasions of the big dances, such as that to 
be neld in Kremmling Friday week; they don't necessarily 
wear them at tnese practices. Tney buy the dresses at 
special shops or make them themselves; Vera* and one of 
•the other women discussed loaning a pattern. (Vera 
Dunaway's comment was, "If I had gotten my dress taken up, 
I'd be wearing it tonight.") 
I.W. called, talking the "squares" of either five or 
six couples through tne maneuvres over a microphone, as 
well as managing the music--a selection of 45's played on 
a portable turntaole with speakers. After each of the dances, 
the couples would gather in a huddle, raise up, and shout 
"Thank YOUi". I.W. would allow breaks after every three 
or four dances, when the dancers could mill around and chat 
and partake of the coffee, iced tea and cookies that the 
women had brought. 
This event allowed us to clarify the McKee family relation¬ 
ships: Vera Dunaway, Wes' wife, is I.W. and Vera McKee's 
daughter—mother is referred to as "Little Vera" and 
daughter as "Big Vera" in order to avoid confusion. 
During the breaks, Big Vera would sometimes lead a less 
or 
formal dance like the "Hokey Pokey", dancer# alone across 
CO80-B0-FN 8/21/80 
-19- 
the floor in a kind of schottische fctep when nobody 
else would join her. She also initiated the taking up 
of the collection ($3.00 per person) during the longer, 
half-time break. 
The first 1% hours I.W. devoted to simpler dances 
(partly on our account?), patiently talking even novice 
fieldworkers through the sets. At about 9:30 p.m., 
after a long break, he embarked on a series of more complex 
dances of the kind that are danced competitevely oy 
squaredance clubs. He rehearsed these dances with the 
couples who joined in (at least one couple sat out) much 
more explicitly than those earlier in the evening, even 
turning the music off in order to guide the douples through 
a pattern that tney were to remenper thereafter, while calling 
less frequently through any particular dance. The shift in 
the pace of the calling and the intensity of the dancers' 
concentration indicated that this portion of the evening, at 
least, represented their serious attempt to become a group 
capable of performing formally. 
During these more complex dances, I spoke with the 
couple that sat out in chairs along the wall (the Tomoskos?), 
who were there for the first time. They had come with friends, 
and, other than one other couple whom they recognized from 
dances held at Frisco High School during the winter, they 
knew no one else there. They said the group had been 
organized about six weeks before, but that preparations for 
their daughter's wedding had prevented them from attending 
before. When I asked the husband if he planned to atteiad 
C080-BO-FN 8/21/80 
-20- 
regularly, he shiygged and said he enjoyed the dancing. He 
had moved out to Colorado from hew Jersey about 12 years be¬ 
fore; he mentioned that a different kind of dancing was 
done in the East. 
All of the dancers were most cordial to us, asking 
sure that each of us got a chance to dance (Rusty, 
especially, was regarded with relish, as they were short one 
man), answering our questions readily, asking some of 
thdir own, and joshing us about all the photographs we 
were taking. We left at about 9:30 p.m., before the 
dancing session had ended. 
Rusty made a short speech over the microphone before 
we left, explaining a bit more about our project and 
thanking them all for their cooperation. He also took 
the opportunity to persuade I.W. McKee to stand for a 
family portrait with "Little Vera", "Big Vera", and 
Wes Dunaway. 
Day 5--22 August, 1980 
Briefing with Rusty and Elke in the car on the way 
out to the McKee ranch. The morning's plan: comprehensive 
recording of th/ings"planted" on the McKee ranchstead--those 
immobile ofjects that represent samples of the cultural 
landscape. Ideally we would pace off the ranch yard 
(placement of and distances between ranch buildings); 
had we the skills necessary, it would be preferable to make a 
topographical diagram of the lay of the land in this region 
where elevation and water flow are so vital.

When we arrived at the McKee's, Vera McKee and her 
daughter Mary were awaiting the veterinarian, as one of the 
colts belonging to their neighbors, Paul and Nell Callahan 
(Box 185, silverthorne, CO 80498), had injured its leg. 
The colt had not been handled much by humans, and it had 
reportedly taken six adults wrestling with it the night 
aW*1# was wty Vtf* ffWWce was \at-d +© 'J'* tke-oct.- 
before to bandage the wound.A They expressed their concern 
that the bandage was now too tight and commented quietly to 
each other about the colt's movements throughout our 
conversation. 
Rusty, Elke, Vera, Mary, and I conversed informally as 
we stood in the corral between the two barns. They explained 
that they had purchased the property from Blue River Highlands 
Corporation. They knew that it had belonged to a Mr. and 
Mrs. Ed Johnson now living in Denver, whose phone number they 
have. They thought the property must have been homesteaded 
by Johnsoris^ife's family; at any rate, the place had been 
referred to as the "Old Johnson Homestead". 
I.W. and Vera are currently renovating their house, 
and Vera mentioned that they had discovered newspapers 
dating from the 1920's under the wallpapering in the 
kitchen. 
We also reviewed some of the I'.cKee family history 
with them. Mary, with some assistance from Vera told again 
about how the Choctaw relatives moved from Tennessee to 
Oklahoma Territory on the Trail of Tears and how son 
John (?) Smallwood left college and followed them, walking 
60 days to reach his distination. He married and was eventually 
C080-BO-FN 8/22/80 
-22- 
killed in a shootout; his wife died in childbirth three weeks 
later. The son was adopted by his aunt, who had married into 
the McKee family. Vera stated that the name McKee was actually 
of French origin, the story being that it was found to be 
too long when the family immigrated and was shortened to 
McKee. She added that it might simply be a story, that 
perhaps the name changed in order to cover up the tracks 
of some outlaw member of the family. When I made some 
comment to the effect that this might be an unpleasant 
discovery, she replied to the contrary, that she thought 
it would be exciting to have an outlaw ancestor. 
We also ascertained that they do' not brand their 
horses, though some of those they keep for the Callahans 
already have brands. 
Rusty and bike went to record Log Barn #2. I followed 
Mary and Vera over beside the corral where they sat with 
the neighbor, Mrs. Callahan, waiting for the vet. 
Vrritr/tw j took information for the interview report form 
from Vera, as well as trying to clarify once more the 
Choctaw Indian story, which had us all confused in terms 
of the number of generations involved. Mary brought out 
the framed newspaper clipping and a typed copy of the 
article, which had been written in the 1930's for a local 
Oklahoma newspaper, in honor of 100 years of continuous 
residence by the Smallwood/McKee clan. It related that 
in 1834, William Smallwood left his home in Missouri to 
attend school in Kentucky. Dissatisfied with the rations 
C080-BO-F1M 8/22/80 
-23- 
of goat meat ne was fed there, he returned to Missouri, 
only to discover that his family, who had "Choctaw 
blood" .in tneir veins had departed for Oklahoma Territory, 
where they were entitled to a parcel of land. William 
Smallwood followed, married Narciani Bearfield there 
and in 1837 settled on 40 acres cf land outside Soper. 
Their daugnter, Mary Smallwood, married John Davis 
McKee and had seven children by him. It was she that the 
article revolted around, describing her food customs, and 
her surviving family. 
Step by step Vera and I proceeded from this document: 
Mary Smallwood McKee took in ner nephew, Isaac (Smallwood) 
x-lcKee, who eventually became the fatner of I.W. McKee. 
7era left to reshuffle cars in the yard, so I continued 
the conversation witn Mary. Her full name is Mary McKee Joecks. 
ber permanent nome is in Denver, wnere, sne explained, 
"rtfter seven years of being a white collar worker, I just 
quit." She had been a funeral director for four years. 
We spoke about her relative preferences between 
Denver and the ranch. While she at first fetated that she 
liked living in Denver because it is exciting, she later 
commented that she would prefer to live on the ranch, that 
she wouldn't miss the city because she could always get 
there, as it's only a 1% hour drive. Whe noted that her 
friends urge her to sell her house in Denver and move up 
to the ranch, but she claims that the cost of living is 
too high up here for her to do so. As it is, she will 
probably stay until January.

We discussed the "D.I." (Old Dillon Inn), the place 
she, her sister Doris and Doris' boyfriend go to dance on 
Friday and Saturday nights. She says they check around 
to make sure it's going to have a country and western band, 
that she wears her Levi's and a nice shirt, and that it 
usually starts getting active around 11 p.m. 
We talked about horseback riding. She referred to 
her childhood years which, ^until the atje of 12, were spent 
on ranches, making her familiar early on with riding and 
ranch work. A fall from a horse discouraged her from riding 
for several years. But, she said, seeing everyone going 
off riding every day this summer determined her to take 
up riding again. bow she rides every day; they can ride 
almost anywhere over tne hills, as they nave an understanding 
with the propert^iolders. This, weekend she, Doris, and 
Doris' boyfriend plan to ride out for an overnight campout. 
As we waiting for the vet, I asked her what they keep 
on hand for doctoring the animals in emergencies. She named 
Phearson's (sp?) ointment and a spray-on application used 
to wash away dead skin--both obtained from the vet—as well 
as compresses and bandages. 
For awhile Wes stood nearby chatting with the neighbor. 
Wes works up at the mine; he explained that he is free 
during the day because he is on a late shift, and that 
the shift changes frequently.

The vet, John Coburn (DVM, 106 Eagle Ave., Kremmling, 
phone: 724-3633) arrived. (Note: neither Nell Callahan 
CO80-BO-FN 8/22/80 
-25- 
nor Wes Dunaway knew the name of the ve£; I finally obtained 
it from Dick McKee.) Coburn was noted by Vera McKee to 
be the nearest—and practically only--large animal vet 
in the area. He also raises quarter horses and hays, 
according th Vera. 
-fKote;, cor^&e-i<.r*3yio(\-33j j watched fend photographed the doctoring session. Coburn, 
with the help of I.W. and Wes Dunaway, roped the foal. 
Because it had newer been handled and was very skittish, 
they decided to tranquilize it. The -ie-al’s mother, Caroline, 
who was running with it in the corral, was disturbed by 
the maneuvers, so they roped her as well, and she stood 
protectively over the foal throughout the proceedings. 
After administering the tranquilizer, the vet spent 
over two hours cleaning the large gash on the colt's leg 
with a green antiseptic liquid and strips of yellow 
towelling and tnen suturing the wound. He hadn't reached 
the bandaging stage before we had to leave. Assisting in 
the doctoring session were Vera McKee, Kell Callahan, 
Mary Joecks, an assistant of the vet's and, at times, Wes 
mtKfci i X-W. fScKM. 
Dunaway. They all quietly looked on as they held lead 
ropes, handed instruments, or soothed the animals, occasionally 
making comments or asking questions of the vet about how 
much blood loss the colt could sustain and what they 
should do next time for first aid in a case like this, 
or jewing with Mrs. Callahan about her smoking habit.

Arrived in Kremmling with ailing radiator, left the

We recorded the log jail in the Kremmling city park 
(on Park Street). Interesting features were the double 
thickness doors, which Rusty explained are common to 
buildings requiring extra protection or insulation, e.g. 
icehouses, smokehouses and jails. Notiasable on both the 
internal and external surfaces of the right wall (as one 
faces the building) was a patch that had been filled 
by replacement hewn logs, (Rusty's suggestion: someone 
had broken out of the jail at that spot ?). Decorative 
features included a shingled gable and verge ("barge") 
notches 
board (a trim bordering the roof); hewn ^ and nail 
holes suggested that it had onee had vertical boards 
covering the square-notch cornering, a feature not installed 
in the present restoration. The interior walls were 
hung with memorabilia--framed photographs and news clippings 
of Kremmling events; a guest book sat on a stand in the 
center of the room.

starts in order to pay off 
his truck) 
(Lives in white house across 
from Knorrs'. Her family 
(the Henry's) were formerly 
ranchers in the area.) 
The Knorrs own four “slide stackers" (otherwise known 
as "overshot" or "beavertail" stackers), all of them 5-7 
years old. They are homemade from lodgepple pine logs, 
some of which have been "treated". The sloping part of the 
stacker up which the hay is pushed has a slope of 45°. 
"he process appeared to be as follows: 
The slide stacker is driven into place in front of 
already prepared wooden staves held together by baling 
wire. The "wings" (side gates) are unfolded towards the back 
and a "back stop" (a flat pole gate constructed the height* 
and width of the front stacker) is moved into place by one 
of the trucks after three initial loads of hay have been 
dumped into place t? Start off the mound. 
Then the other drivers go to work in earnest, Greg, 
just a * rig' Crake'?) — a vehicle 
driving what he called 
CO8O-B0-FN 8/22/80 
-28- 
trailing a circular, combirg fixture—combs the hay into 
long rolls. Mrs. Enders and George Knorr then push this 
hay into larger piles near the stacker using "buckrakes"— 
vehicles made out of what Mrs. Enders believed were the 
machinery from "World War II cars", or, in the case of 
the one she was driving, an old ambulance with only 2-wheel 
drive. These are turned backwards and run with a fan-shaped 
board attachment--the rake. 
Karl Knorr, driving the "plunger truck", then pushes 
the accumulated mounds up the sloping gate of the stacker 
'(rimmed with tires for easier pushing and retraction of the 
metal arm of tne plunger truck) and over onto the accumulating 
haystack. 
They oegan the new stack at 5:15 p.m. Karl Knorr said 
that it tax.es not more than 1 or 2 hours to fill up a 
stacker. They have at least three more haystacks to go, 
one in a very steep hay meadow across the road, which 
promises to be the most difficult. 
By riding in the plunger truck with Karl Knorr and 
chatting with him briefly in the meadow, Rusty discovered 
more information about haying and the Knorr family. Karl 
claims that he has never missed the ramp in driving the 
plunger truck; he angles the plunger alternately to the 
right, the left, and the center to distribute the hay 
FWsi-y et-v Jtd 
evenly.A In order to remember which direction to angle it, 
W- moves a nail to right, left, or center in his ashtray 
after each plunge. 
Karl said that he and his father built the first buckrake 
CO80-BO-FN 8/22/80 
-29- 
in 1935 using the enassis and engine of a 1923 Dodge car. The 
front rake is made from white ash ooards. These are difficult 
to obtain now, so Knorr doesn't expect the buckrakes to continue, 
in their present form anyway, for much longer. Alternate terms 
for the buckrake that Karl Knorr is familiar with are "bullrake"-- 
a term his father, William (Wilhelm), who came to Breckenridge 
in 1883--used, and also "sweeprake". 
Knorr was also versed in log buildings. His uncle had 
been a "skilled logman" and had huilt a number of the log 
buildings in the area. He nad alternate terms for cornering 
methods: saddle notching^"saddle and rider", square notching= 
"flat dove-tail", a method that usually doesn't hold the logs 
togetner, so you have to nail them. His uncle could dove-tail 
in such a way that the logs were locked together and nailing 
was unnecessary. 
Dinner in Kremmling at the Corner Cottage. Searched 
unsuccessfully for the local cemetary. Stopped at the Old 
Dillon Inn at about 8:30 p.m. on the way towards Frisco-?- 
crowded, out no band. Home. 
Day 6--23 August, 1980 
Morning oriefing with Rusty and Elke at our house-- 
scotched plans for Hot Sulphur Springs folk festival and drive 
to Grand Lake in favor of continuing the recording of the 
McKee buildings. 
On the drive to the McKee's, I reviewed Rusty's notes on 
-30- 
Log Barns wl-2 from yesterday. Notations included the 
fact that Barn 41 has a modern roof with little gapping 
between its board roofing materials, wnile Barn 42 has 
the original roof, with wide gapping, as vd.1 as a plate 
that protrudes about 2 feet. Rusty hazarded the guess 
that this was for butchering purposes. 
I.W. was in the yard when we arrived at the McKee's. 
Rusty spoke with nim about the buildings, questioning him 
oka* their names and more striking features, e.g. 1.4.'s opinion 
was that the protruding plates on Barn #2 were not for 
butchering purposes, rather , they represented a part of 
an intended extension of the ouilding that was never carried 
out. I.W. pointed out as tne most interesting structure 
the remains lying across the road from Barn*3, because 
it had hand-hewn logs and seemed the oldest. I.W. had no 
special name for what Rusty calls a "Dutch door"--the 
double door on Barn #2. When Rusty asked I.K. if he had 
ever built a log building, I.W. laughed and said, "I'm 
not a carpenter. i can't even build a good hog pen." 
I.W. suggested that Ed Johnson, whose wife's father 
homesteaded the land, he believed, would be the logical 
person to get in touch with about the forms and uses of 
the various ouildings. 
I went into I.W. and Vera's house to find out Ed 
Johnson's address and phone number. Mary was sweeping the 
living room, an uncluttered space with dining table, some 
soft chairs, and a couch at the gar end witn a cupboard 
and shelves on which steal family photographs. 
COSO-BO-Fim 8/23/80

Vera read me the information on Ed Johnson from the 
front cover of the Denver white pages where it had been noted 
down: 
Ed Johnson 
54th Ave. 
Denver, Colo, 
phone: 424-6552 
Vera mentioned tnat sue was feeling lazy today. I 
asked how much longer the doctoring session bad taken 
yesterday. She replied that they finished suturing, applying 
ointments and bandaging about 45 minutes after we left. X 
asked after ner dog, Killer, whom she had said yesterday 
was "trying to get distemper" the previous day. She answered 
that he was fine and that she was just about to give him his 
pill. I thanked her for the address and went out to 
join Rusty and Elke on Log Building rf3 
I photographed this building and took a few notes. 
Interesting feature was its door and windows on the south 
side, which had all been covered over by replacement wood. 
Access is now through a gap in the east end. The barn is 
now used for storing baled hay. 
We moved on to record Log Building #4. This was more 
of a challenge both to examine and to photograph,because it 
is in partial ruins and is set on a steep uphill slope above 
the road that goes by the McKee place. An interesting feature 
was the roofing method. Unlike the gaoling method on the 
other McKee buildings or any of the other log structures 
we have recorded, this one employed 7" solid log purlins 
and a 5" center ridge pole to support a very low roof. The 
structure is connected by log extensions to the fencing 
CO80-BO-FN 8/23/80 
-32- 
around it. 
ihe entiis structure has caved in and is leaning 
precariously on the slope. Rusty speculated that there is 
a portion of the front wall missing. We discussed what 
it could have been used for; Elke suggested that it was 
the earliest dwelling of the homesteaders, abandoned for 
roomier quarters. Rusty suggested that it had been a 
workshed of some sort. I wondered aloud why it would have 
been built on such a slope--we tentatively decided that 
it had been constructed before the road below it to the 
east was cut and nad simply utilized the natural slppe. 
While we were recording Building #4, the McKee's neighbor, 
Paul Callahan, (Box 185, Silverthorne) came up the road 
his 3-year old horse, Dumas. Rusty commented on its 
stumpy tail and mane; Callahan explained that it is of 
a special breed and will soon be registered to breed. 
As Rusty and Callahan introduced themselves and 
continued to converse, we discovered that Mr. Callahan lives 
on the property up the road from the McKee's bearing to 
the left. he boucht the 40 acre property three years 
ago, their house was completed in January, and they have 
tne property up for sale now. Mr. Callahan was born in 
Oklahoma and moved out to California afe the age of 14; 
ne lived in >-ne area around Bakersfield—Wasco, California, 
In response to Rusty's question about whether he played any 
instruments, Callahan mentioned that he played guitar and 
banjo, that he had played lead guitar for Buck Owens' band 
C080-BO-FN 8/23/80 
-33- 
for several years, travelling all over California with him. 
Mr. Callahan works for Schroeder (sp?) Excavating 
("dirt work", he called it) until late in the evenings. 
Rusty ascertained that he has Sundays off and made a date 
to come hear him play on Sunday afternoon.

finished my black and white roll. Rusty recorded.

Left McKee ar.d headed into town for lunch. Stopped 
at Frisco Pharmacy to get something to staunch the bleeding 
from a small cut on my knee that refused to coagulate. There 
Rusty introduced Like and I to Bo Bogan, pharmacist and 
proprietor. Bogan first counseled me to apply pressure to 
the cut; when he understood that this nadn't proved 
sufficient, he gave me a small vial of iron sub sulfate, 
a greenish-yellow powder with the instruction to. mix it 
with a little blood and spread it on the wound—"It will 
hurt like hell, but it will stop the oleeding". It is 
frequently used by barbers when they nick their clients, 
according to Bogan. 
Bo Bogan runs a drug store solely devoted to selling 
pharmaceutical supplies. His special interest and expertise 
is in high altitude health and nutrition. He discussed this 
subject with us and the couple that had been visiting with 
him when we arrived. He believes that inefficiency in 
obtaining oxygen is the critical factor in altitude discomfort 
and that this can be nutritionally controlled. His recommenda- 
C080—BO-FN 8/23/80 
-34- 
ti°n is that one not eat any protein for two weeks prior 
to coming to the mountains, nor for two weeks after arriving, 
lie explained by drawing me a diagram that in metabolizing 
protein, NH^, or ammonia is produced. Normally this 
ammonia is secreted through the urine and the lungs, but 
in the mountains, where urine ourput decreases, more of 
tne ammonia must be secreted through the lungs, thus competing 
with the oxygen and other elements that must be processed 
through that organ. The ill effects of th- is competition 
produce the symptoms familiar to altitude sickness_ 
dizziness, nausea, lack of appetite, headache, and the 
inability of the blood to clot, 
Wnen he discovered that I am a vegetarian, he replied 
that that was my problem right there, "You can't have all 
tnat cellulose, you see,"adding a chemical explanation of 
now cellulose inhibits blood coagulation. (According to 
r-ogan, it taxes 30-60 days for the body to beaeme adjusted 
to the altitude.) He said that my diet is completely 
wrong for the mountains. "it's all right for the flatlands," 
he noted, "but up here you need carbohydrates... junk 
food: potato chips, ice cream, bread--but no bran, cornflakes, 
peanut butter..." Cheese was on his list of acceptable foods, 
as were other dairy products ("they're mostly fat", he said) 
and potatoes. "But none of those other vegetables," he 
cautioned. He also put his seal of approval on pizza; 
...just fine but don't have sausage on it, just cheese!" 
When Rusty asked him when he was going to write a book 
about his high altitude guidelines, he showed us the only 
0080-BO-FN S/23/80 
-35- 
book published on the effects of high altitude on the body; 
nowhere does it mention high altitude nutrition, He spoke 
despairingly about tne workshop he has taught in previous 
years on the subject, usually under the sponsorship of 
various colleges. This year he couldn't find anyone to 
sponsor it. He had originally arranged with a ski club 
to hold the workshop, but they had reneged, apparently 
because they feared it would injure their business. The 
common sequence as Bogan outlined it is that a man flies 
in from Chicago or somewhere for a skiing vacation, comes 
immediately up from Denver airport, checks into his hotel, 
hits the slopes and is admitted to ti:.e hospital for 
heart stress all in the saas day. Tney usually end up 
flying him home, but still, the companies don't want to 
lose that $5,000 ticket by preparing him beforehand. 
Bo noted that the pharmaceutical companies also 
wouldn't support him in his drive to educate, because "It 
is too cheap and easy--there's no money in it for them." 
We suggested that he try getting in touch with the 
Sierra Club, a non-profit conservation and outdoor recreation 
organization. He brushed off the suggestion--"They're 
interested in conservation--but not in conserving humans. 
No one is interested in conserving human life." We thanked 
Bo for the iron sub sulfate and all the information.

ranch and McKee's ranch on topological maps. George Knorr, 
the elder brother's portion of the ranch was covered over

by Green Akeservoir. 
Visit with Mr. and Mrs. Paul and Kell Callahan. Mr. 
Callahan played some country and western tunes for us on 
his guitar and his banjo (Rusty joining in on guitar), and 
he played us some material recorded by his nephew. 
The Callahans said that they don't feel isolated 
up on their property, despite the fact that it's a bit 
inaccessible by (private) road, especially during the 
winter. (They noted that there was only one day last 
winter that Mr. Callahan couldn't get out to the highway to 
go to work, and tnat was because Lorna McKee's car got 
stuck at the bottom of the hill.) They enjoy the quiet, 
They bought the property for investment purposes. They 
hope to sell and move to Colorado Springs, where their 
son is stationed. 
They keep some horses, mostly for fun. 
Packed up and descended the Callahan's road in a

jfiiiH) Trip to County Courthouse. Results: 
County Assessors' Office--information on the McKee's 
ranch ("old Johnson Homestead") included a white‘'Residential 
Propejjy m 
kecord“card with legal description, valuation and APPrt-sal 
(winter) pnotograpn of the property. Attached was 
a yellow card diagramming the property (xerox) 
(Rote: this diagram doesn't reflect our knowledge 
of the ranch layout, did not have any identifying 
notations on tne card except by virtue of being 
attacned to tne white record card, and may well be 
incorrect). See Deed book 176, p. 833 
Knorr property—Knorrs appear 5 times on the 
microfilm index to property holders. I examined 3 
cards listing their properties ana copied pertinent 
information from the one citing a 695 acre tract' on 
Blue uiver Rt. See Deed Book 190, p. 267 
Vvheaton College property--See Deed Books 208, p.233-235; 
213, p. 674; 148, p. 366. 
A young man who was summoned to answer my qestions 
and whom I took to be the county assessor explained that 
the rating chart on the McKee diagram referred to 
a subjective evaluation by the appraiser based on 
a standard poor-average-good scale (the "10" that 
appears there is apparently an error). Assessments 
are supposed to be done every four years, but he noted 
that the office has fallen behind schedule and properties 
off the beaten track are likely to be taken care of 
0080-BO-FN 8/25/80

last. Based on the Handwriting on the McKee record 
card, he believed that that assessment had been done 
by an employee no longer with tne office (initials: "d.V.H." 
or "H.T.H."), probably in 1976. 
He recommended that I search in the books 
at the County Clerk and Record office for records 
of transfers of tne McKee property, whicn should 
appear on one of the McKee assessment cards here if 
the right card could be found. He also, after hearing 
about my mission, suggested that I get in touch with 
local historian and author, Mark Feister about "Bill's 
Rancn"—a sub-development started by “Bill" during 
the Depression. 
County Clerk and Record Office 
After explaining what I was after, 1 was snown to 
"the vault" wnere the old records are contained (a small 
room adjoining tne main office) and left to examine the 
deed books. 
McKee property--Deed Book (176/893) fchat was cited as 
listing the property transfer was aislaoeled and not 
paginated to p. 893. 1 was instructed to search back 
through the General Reception--Grantee volumes (large, leather 
bound volumes covered with canvas, laoelled in red) whicn 
list all transactions ca. 1880-1976 recorded with the 
county. I was to trace back the exchanges of property 
by looking for a "Warranty Deed" listing with Blue River 
Highlands as the grantee, find the corresponding grantor 
and look them up in the same manner. 
CO80-BO-FN 8/25/80 
-40- 
I found the incorporation of Blue River Highlands— 
a partaership between Clarence A. Decker and N. Marcus 
Bishop--in 1968 and a correction warranty deed for the 
property (Lot 3-4, S3 VRS LTS S4 T4S R78W ) , but searching 
back through the books as far as 1904, I never saw either 
Decker or Bishop listed as acquiring the property. 
I did obtain the address of Blue River Highlands from data 
on the microfilm McKee transfer records: 
Blue River Highlands 
2700 Vi. Evans, Suite 405 
Denver, Colo. 80219 
- (The person who guided me to this information believed 
that Bishop had recently died.) 
Knorr property--Deed book (190/267): transfer of 
property from Corinne Knorr to George, Karl, Greta, William, 
and Gordon Knorr, Aug. 1, 1967. Tnrough Reception ocok t?9, 
reference to Deed nook (78/269) with Wm. P. Knorr as 
grantee, Public Trustee W.Vv. Wharton as grantor, Oct. 10, 1903. 
Also Deed book (43/78), an indenture agreement involving 
a promissory note with Rudolph Levine; and book (93/28), 
with Knorr as grantee for some town lots, dated Sept. 6, 1908. 
(Rote: Theodore Knorr appears quite frequently in the Re¬ 
ception books, apparently in reference to the transfer 
of town lots. ) 
Viheaton College property-- 
(208/233-235) property deeded over to the Trustees of 
Wheaton College, "an Illinois educational 
corporation by Ricnard L. Smith and Betty 
J. Smith for $10 on June 1, 1971 (recorded

College to Richard L. and Betty J. Smith on 
Dec. 6, 1971 
(148/366)--no time to look it up 
All tne deeds I examined were phrased in terss of 
very specific locational abbreviations (lots, sections, 
townships, ranges), which were unrecognizable to me. 
When I asked one of the office people whether I could 
see a map that these referred to, she indicated rather 
vaguely that there was no such map. All of the deeds 
reflected not only the transfer of lands, out also their 
attached water rignts. 
County Clerk--I introduced myself to Ms. Arlys Ward,the 
county clerk, telling her what I was seeking and why, and 
what I had already looked at in the courthouse. She 
recommended that I consult the Summit County Abstractor 
(for a fee) for further information on the McKee transfers, 
as there the properties are listed by legal description and 
are thus more accessiole for my purposes. She also suggested 
the Summit County Historical Society for more general 
information on local ranching. 
District Court (up^stairs in courthouse building)-- 
Probated wills are kept here but are unavailable for 
public inspection.

Het Leslie Farr at Breckenridge Elementary School 
for a ride home. Leslie gave me a tour of the schoolrooms, 
The building is fairly new and the classrooms are spacious 
witn few partitions, allowing free movement from one 
apace to another. All are decorated in cheerful colors, 
and a brief glance indicated that there is a good share 
of quality materials and equipment around. Preparations 
were afoot for the opening of classes the fepxu . The 
faculty appeared to be quite young. 
Leslie dropped me by a log building in the center of 
Breckenridge, which had formerly been an assayor's office 
and is now tne office (and residence?) of a couple of 
attorneys. It is a hewn log structure with square-notch 
cornering; I suspect from tne neat job of cement chinking, 
tne newish tin roof and tne wooden addition on the rear 
of the structure that it has been heavily reconstructed. 
It looked as if an earlier addition had been made, judging 
from the line of the roof—a regular gable form with a shed 
roof addition on the left side ,as one faces the front of 
the building. 
As we rode home, Leslie and I spoke about the rate 
of transiency in the area. She had mentioned in an earlier 
conversation that it is often difficult to keep track 
of the children in her Title I classroom. because their 
families often leave town without notice. Many people 
move to the area because it appeals to them, only to 
discover that they can't keep up with the higher cost of 
C080-30-FN 8/25/80 
-43- 
living up here. She pointed out that at the local 
McDonald's there nad been incrediole turnover—over 200 
employees in one month* In reference to her own family, 
she mentioned tnay they had moved to the area attracted 
by its recreational opportunities, only to discover that 
they have less time now to recreate, despite the fact that 
things are more accessible now. 
Leslie drove me down the road past their house to 
show me the log cabin that has been converted into a 
-guest house by their neighbor._

Dinner at home—thunderstorm, electricity went out. 
8 p.m.—Interview with Mr. Knorr. Rusty conducted 
the interview at the Knorrs' dining room table while 
Elke and I listened and photographed. 
Knorr had assembled family photographs taken by his 
mother, Corinne Guyselman Knorr, on a Brownie box camera 
in Karl Knorr's childhood. He discussed each photograph 
in turn: 
1. ) McKee Guyselman (Karl Knorr's uncle) wearing 
angora chaps ca. 1910 
2. ) Stacking hay in the old way—William Knorr (Karl's 
father), Karl Knorr, George Knorr and neighbor 
Carl Kedin. Until the advent of the slide stacker. 
C080-BO-FN 8/25/80

t'ne stacker apparatus had no gates or backstop 
3. ) Horses working the buckrake ("sweep^rake" or 
"bull^rake "William Knorr (?) ca. 1935 
4. ) Branding. Branding is done in the early 
spring. Inoculation, castration and de-horning 
is done at the same time. 
5. ) "Little George and Karl" fishing ca. 1916 
6. ) Karl (and George) driving single seater cart ca. 
1920, wearing "soldier nats" (Karl's uncle had 
gotten them in WWI) 
7. ) Old time branding 
8. ) Draft horses--Belgian stallion "Bmartie" ca. 1915 
9. ) Family picnic 
10. ) 3ulls ca. 1925. Knorr's father was one of the 
first to use llerefords. ^lso pictured is a 
clothesline made from a car wneel 
11. ) Father's (William Knorr's) first automobile-- 
a Model T, ca. 1914 
12. ) Advertising picture, photographed by Bob Taylor 
13. ) Moving day--moving t.e Knorr buildings up from 
the reservior-to-be 
14. ) Judge William A. Guyselman. Photo portrait by 
(the Post (?)) photographer in Denver. According 
to Karl, Judge Guyselman did some of the first 
work on water rights. 
15. ) House in Breckenridge tnat William Knorr built 
and lived in; it is now a ski shop next to the 
Bank of Breckenridge. 
C080-B0-Fi\i 8/2 5/80

Karl also showed us a photograph (ca. 1920's) of 
his uncle's family in Germany. Mrs. Knorr brought out a 
family Bible with Karl's family records inscribed in 
the front. Mrs. Knorr noted that the records had been 
diligently kept by Corinne, Knarl's mother, whom she 
referred to as "Mother" and spoke of with much fondness 
and respect. 
Otner information that emerged during tne course of 
the interview was that Karl's fatner, William P. Knorr 
came to the United States in 1882-3 to avoid military 
conscription in his native Germany. He came directly to 
Colorado to prospect. His brother, Theodore, followed 
soon after and together they ran the Knorr Brothers' 
Pioneer Saloon in Breckenridge. Karl showed us a metal 
matchbox advertising the saloon on one side and sporting 
a picture of the family dog, Duke, on the other side. 
William Knorr married Corinne Guyselman and later 
bought the ranch property from the Judge. The Judge 
had originally acquired the property as a placer claim 
as payment for services rendered. 
One of the Knorr buildings that is now used as a 
barn used to house the Lakeside Post Office (Lakeside 
is the area now covered by Green Mountain Reservoir); 
Karl owns a map printed in the 1880's that shows the 
location of the post office. 
It was Karl's great-uncle, George Guyselman, who 
built log buildings. He built some at Black Lake, for 
instance. He was a Civil War veteran--he had served for 
the Worth. 
CO80-BO-FN 8/25/80 
-46- 
Karl brought out a book on branding and a centennial 
history put out by the Cattlemen's Association, as well 
as a couple of old brand books (which record who belongs 
to what brand) for us to look at. 
Rusty discussed the seasonal round of ranching 
activities with Knorr. Knorr mentioned the "cow camp" 
that he takes nis cattle to around June 1st each year. 
This is over at wnat Karl called the "Blue Ridge Allotment" 
(the Williams Reservoir range) which was traded by the 
Bureau of Land management to the Forest Service. The 
cattle stay on this side of the range and graze on 
native grasses? Blue Stem and Slender Wheat Grass. 
In May Karl begins irrigating and starts the hay crop. 
He has abundant water as he is close to the mountains and 
has water rights dating back to the 1880's for water from 
Cataract, Otter and Black creeks. Spring is his busiest 
time of year. 
Karl also spoke briefly about the geology of the 
area--about how glacial action was responsible for 
depositing the rocks we see in his hay fields today. He 
spoke approvingly about James Michener's historical novel, 
Centennial, which describes the history and geology of 
Colorado; he felt that it was pretty accurate. 
Mrs. Knorr remained somewhat removed during the 
taping of the interview, retiring to a chair in the 
living room to read a paperback book. Occasionally 
she would drift in to see w'hat photograph we were talking 
about or to hand Elke and I another one that she thought 
CO80-BO-FN 6/25/80 
-47- 
might be of interest, studiously avoiding having herself 
photographed or tape-recorded. she went into the kitchen 
a couple of times to unload dishes from the dishwasher 
or to start the coffee percolating, and she winked at 
me from there. After we finished with the family 
photos, she served us coffee and a plate of cookies 
(homemade "tannies", as well as Peppridge Farm's best) 
and cheese, joking with us about now she was going to 
start charging for tne coffee. 
After we packed away our equipment, she and Mr. Knorr 
showed us their tropny rr-om, where the walls are hung 
with the heads and hides of some of tneir trophies 
from hunting expeditions in Africa and Asia, as well 
as from local hunts. while Mr. Knorr brougnt out his 
hat and some professional ranching literature for Rusty 
to examine, hike, Mrs. Knorr and I conversed about 
Mrs. Knorr's past. She discussed her experience as a 
school teacher in a one room schoolhouse in Lakeside 
(now defunct town). She noted that she had to do her 
own janitorial work in addition to the teaching. She 
mentioned that she never hit a child as punishment; she 
simply let them sit out and cool off. 
She promised to show us the cabin across the road, 
which also belongs to them. She sells antiques there-- 
mostly items owned by the Knorr family. She noted that 
her daughters wanted to keep all of the stuff, but 
they had decided that it would be more fair to the 
whole family to simply sell it and split the profits. 
We thanked the Knorrs and left about 10:30 p.m.

Day 9--26 August, 1980 
7:30 a.m.--Rotary Club Meeting (breakfast) with 
Eusty Marshall on the program as the guest speaker. 
Elbe and I attended as guests (Elka attempted to record 
Rusty's talk on her Uher, with no success.) I noted 
the relative youth of the Rotary Club membership, an 
observation that Rusty, who has attended their meetings 
twice before, prepared us for. 
We met Ben Fogle, who owns the office supply store 
where Rusty bought our architect's pencils; we greeted 
Bo Bogan, an officer in the organization. Over our 
french toast and (fruit, Elke and I spoke witn Dr. Thomas 
E. Cole, the local (small pet) veterinarian. He mentioned 
that the Rockies are a paradise for dogs, as there are 
relatively few fleas, a low incidence of heart worm and, 
other than in the summer when dogs get into ticks 
and porcupines, they have little opportunity to get 
injure. I sat next to Lee Erill and spoke with him 
briefly about Glenwood Springs, from which he had just re¬ 
turned after appearing in a water rights case. He later 
gave a pitch about the local Red Cross Blood Drive. 
After breakfast and cIud business had been taken 
care of and visitors had been introduced, Rotary officer 
Robin Theobald introduced Rusty. Beginning by smilingly 
stating nis intention to "sell soap", Rusty gave about a 
25 minute talk about the project. lie briefly rehashed 
tne project's purposes and goals ("the rap", which he 
had apparently delivered the year before to many of the 
CO80-BO-FN 8/26/80 
-49- 
same members). He then quickly reviewed our progress 
in the past 9 days, citing the specific ranches we had 
looked at by name and location. 
Rusty went on to speak about living history museums 
already in existence in this region of the U.S.. He 
mentioned: 
1) La Cienega—an Hispanic colonial ranch in 
Santa Fe 
2) Jensen Farm in Logan, Utah 
3) Iowa Living History Farms in Des Hoines, Iowa 
4) the Grant-Hours Ranch in Montana, run by the 
Rational Park Service as a Rational Historic 
Site 
Even counting these, he noted, there are no museums in the 
immediate area doing precisely the kind of work he 
foresees for a High Mountain Museum. 
He stressed pragmatic considerations, acknowledging, 
for instance, that it is already virtually impossible to 
obtain a site on 1-70, ideal as this would be for attracting 
visitors. Rusty included each member of the club in the 
project by indicating that each of them has knowledge or 
information he could contribute; he gave the example 
that he had recently been told that there are plans afoot 
to widen Route 9—a detail that would certainly be 
crucial in locating a museum. 
There were several questions from the audience, which 
allowed Rusty to elaborate on various aspects of setting 
up and running the museum. One member asked whether some 
* HM !VN Mil! aril c i;'ii j^tx..? 
C080-BO-FW 8/26/80 
-50- 
other arrangement would be acceptable if the museum 
weren't aole to obtain property oy purchase. Rusty 
agreed that other arrangements could certainly oe 
entertained, provided some scrt of legal guarantee was 
made that the museum would retain the rights to the 
property (e.g. would inherit) upon the death of the 
owner, as museums in similar situations have been 
known to encounter difficulties with heirs or executors. 
He also described the benefits availaole in terms of 
tax deductiTwnen one donates property of any kind to a 
non-profit, educational corporation such as tne Rocky 
fountain Continental divide Foundation. 
In response to a question about whether the proposed 
museum would feature people in costume portraying ranchers, 
Kusty replied that it is still up in tne air, that it 
partly depends on tne period chosen, but that the idea 
would not be to employ college students "dressed up in 
grannie dress and strumming dulcimers" (index finger 
waggles to and fro here); rather, it would have a real 
rancnino family continue their worx, out perhaps using 
the machinery and dress of another era. He emphasized 
that the museum was going to be as accurate as possible 
in its depiction. 
Lee Brill expressed his concern that the vital 
mining history of the area would get downplayed in the 
concentration on ranching. Rusty conceded that mining 
was indeed crucial to the history of the area; after all, 
the ranchers wouldn't have come at all but to feed the 
C080-BO-FN 8/26/80 
-51- 
miners. Nevertneless, it is important to portray the 
ranching, a way of life that has been neglected in most 
of the histories and that still survives today. In 
fact, it might be possible to depict both ways of life 
on one site--with grandpa mining his placer claim up 
on the hill while son and grandson ranch on the land 
below--an arrangement not too far different from the 
reality in the case of the Knorr family. 
The talk drew a good response, Enthusiastic 
members came up to speak with Rusty afterwards. One 
such was: 
Dr. Arthur Mason, Jr. 
Graduate Scnool of Business 
University of Denver

lie spends his Augusts here at his home in Breckenridge. 
lie had visited several open air museums in Europe 
(Arnheim, one in the Black Forest, Kingussie in Scotland) 
and was quite enthusiastic about them. The one that 
had impressed him the most, he said, was Kingussie, 
because the woman protraying the Scottish cottager had 
concerned herself less with her costume than with having 
her visitors understand what the situation was all about. 
Rusty and he had an amiable exchange, Rusty took down his 
address and indicated to him that he would be interested 
in getting in touch with him again. 
Another enthusiastic response came from a member 
who had been sparked by Rusty's earlier rhetorical question 
/, i'- - sc '-SB-.* •- ' ' ' - • •••- 
C080-BO-FN 8/26/80 
-52- 
about what people had worn in the early 1900’s. This 
man had been born in 1914 and could remember what his 
father wore ca. 1920. This pointed up a feature of 
this particular museum proposal that Rusty immediately 
articulated: it is "recoverable" history. People are 
still around who can verify the details of the period 
we are trying to depict. 
Rusty spent a good deal of time talking to Robin 
Theobald outside before we left. Theobald's family 
apparently owns a great deal of old mining equipment. 
In fact, he runs a regular sluicing operation on Sundays. 
Theobald 
Rusty reported that . ^is ready to help out with the 
mining portion of the museum right now. Theobald also 
invited us to come look at his family's collections (housed 
in the building marked "Museum" in Breckenridge, it 
remains closed because of a personal disagreement between 
the Theobalds and the Summit County Historical Society, 
according to Rusty). 
Returned to Farrs'--laundry, lunch, notes, business 
details, and reading: 
Goff, Richard and Robert P. McCaffree, Century 
in the Saddle, Denver: Colorado Cattlemen's 
Centenmial Commission. 1967. 365 p. 
Rode out towards Knorrs'. Stopped at Slate Creek to 
meet Charlie Lund, who has been mentioned to us as an 
"old timer" by many people, including John Farr. Ho 
one around, but it's a promising ranch complex with 
old log buildings»ilocated in a wide spot in the Blue 
CO80-BO-FK 8/26/80 
-5S- 
River Valley, off Route 9 near the Slate Creek Schoolhouse 
complex. 
Arrived at Knorrs'. Mrs. Knorr was too busy to talk 
(preparing to entertain), so we gave her a gift of a 
Small can of coffee (fortuitously her brand]) and arranged 
Phott* to talk to her tomorrow a.m. As we stood conversing 
on her porch sne mentioned to Rusty that he would have to 
explain our project more fully to Karl, as he really 
aoesn't unaerstand what we are about. She was sorry 
that she couldn't spare the time to show us ner antique 
shop, but whe gave us the key and told us to go look 
around, mentioning a spot oehind the stove that she 
believed nas the oldest newspaper wall covering. 
..e stopped briefly to speak to Mr. R.D. Enders, 
whose nome is right next to the log cabin in which the 
antique shop is housed. lie was most cordial, despite 
the fact that we had caught him in the middle of shaving. 
?Jo-F»je The three of us examined the exterior, interior, 
and contents of the log nouse. Antiques that caught 
Rusty's practiced eye were 
—a pair of old skis (approx 7' tall) with pointed 
tips resembling: pS ch 
an old mason's trowel with homemade blade and 
standard manufacture handle 
-- "safe"--a food locker for storing edibles, It 
looks like a large, wooden cabinet and is not 
for sale. 
The front room held many other objects, including kitchen 
utensil of all shapes and sizes, a large old stove, and 
G080-BG-FN 8/26/80 
-54- 
assorted old furniture. Stored upstairs were some more 
old chairs, a brass bedstead and a multitude of unidentified 
items. It was eifficult to maneuver around them in 
measuring the interior walls. 
Rusty called this structure an "I house". Elke 
and I measured the upstairs interior. Among the notable 
features were the roof and ceiling arcangeraent. The 
ceiling is covered by imitation wood paneling. By 
peering through a crawlspace in the ceiling, Rusty 
pointed out to us the center ridge pole and the ceiling 
joists, which had been carefully crafted so as not to 
be visible on the exterior. 
There were newspapers covering the ealls, among them 
a 1904 copy of the Denver Post and a 1904 copy of a 
German language paper, the Herold, containing such 
advertisnng gems as a want ad declaring the virtues of 
immigrating to the raisin growing area around Fresno, 
California, cr that which offered a 6 week course in 
barbering. 
Interruption in the flooring indicated that^he upstairs 
had undergone some remodelling--either the removal of a 
stairway or of room partitions, Rusty thought. Elke and 
I noticed that different instruments had been used to 
_hew adjacent logs that composed the reat wall. 
(Question: How does one measure interior partitions? 
One side sometimes comes out longer than the other, depending 
upon the thickness of exterior walls and door frames, etc.) 
We returned the key to Mrs. Knorr. Rusty and Elke 
expressed interest in some of the antiques (trowel, tin cup). 
CO80-BO-FK 8/26/80 
-55- 
Mrs. Knorr explained that although 85% of the antiques 
belonged to the Guyselmans or the Knorrs, she is selling 
some of tne stuff over there on contract for a friend, and 
it is all scheduled to go up for auction next month, except, 
of course, for those items not for sale. Tne old stove 
came from Walden through her aunt. 
As we were departing, Mrs. Knorr mentioned the log 
bi_ilding--an old bunkhouse--down by Elack Creek. It is 
now used as a Sportsmen's Lodge, but she gave us her 
permission to go look at it. We stopped on the road to 
look at it, but it was occupied, so we didn't go down. 
Stopped at Charlie Lund's ranch. Like met Pauline 
Ballard, who cooks for nim. She's probably about 22. 
There were many ears and trucks in the yard, as well as 
milling dags and a carload of young men who were just 
about to leave. Pauline explained that Charlie was at 
a movie in Breckenridge. We arranged to come by tomoirow 
morning to talk to him before he goes out to the fields. 
Dinner at Straw Hat Pizza. Family scene. 
Frisco branch of the Summit County Literary. Posted 
the RMCDF card and project information on the community 
bulletin board as we went in. I hoped to look at some 
of the old copies of the Summit County Journal, which 
the Douglas thesis had indicated were here. According to 
the librarian, who admitted that she is new and can't be 
C080-BO-FN 8/26/80 
coro t 
-56- 
sure, they are not here. She pointed us to the local 
history shelves (which we had already discovered and 
in front of which Rusty was already esconsed), She 
noted that all of the nooks on .local history are extremely 
popular and, particularly those on mining, «j© out 
regularly. She couldn't recommend anything on ranching. 
She told Elke that she ahd moved up here not quite 
a year ago, attracted by tne skiing. She is very interested 
in learning about the nistory of the area. 
The library, though small, seems reasonably well 
stocked ( a separate children's room) and very comfortable, 
with soft cnairs and a couch grouped before a fireplace. 
While waiting to look at the copy of Beloved Blasted 
Breckenridge that Elke had borrowed from the front deck, 
I looked at a book on hispanic folk architetture in southern 
Colorado, noping to compare it to the kind of folk 
architecture we have.been looking at. It had good 
black and whit photos--pracaically nil on text. I also 
looked at a book of essays on ranchers and cowboys and 
the rise of cowboy mythology.

8 a.m. Visit to Charlie Lund's ranch. We met 
Pauline jogging over to Charlie's house on the way (we 
later found out that she lives in one of the buildings 
in the schoolhouse complex). When we arrived, another 
young woman, Sherri Weldon, was tending dye pots on the 
CO80-BO-FK 8/27/80 
-57- 
large old stove while Charlie ate his breakfast of bacon, 
eggs, potatoes and biscuits on which Charlie poured honey 
or syrup. They fetched us chairs and we sat in this 
rather cluttered kitchen while Rusty briefly gave Charlie 
the "rap". Charlie demurred when Rusty concluded with 
"and everyone has daid that Charlie Lund is the one to 
talk to ", but he agreed that it would be all right for 
Like to stay and talk with him before he went out to 
work and for her to look at the buildings. Before we 
left, the girls suggested that we also talk to the Ler^s

Rusty and I continued on the Knorrs' ranch. I inter¬ 
viewed Mrs. Knorr while Rusty photographed Ilr. Knorr's 
family photos on the /ront porch. 
We covered a lot of territory in the taped interview, 
. discussing her cooking and preserving techniques, her 
cor>-eo^unJt-M hunting activities, her experience as a teacher working 
(.i-vO 
by virtue of an "emergency certificate" during WWII in 
the small Lakeside School and her courtship and marriage 
to 35 year old Karl Knorr and her early married life 
with Karl and his mother in the old home (now occupied 
by the Enders). We also talked about the transfer of the 
ranch buildings to new ground when Green Mountain Reservoir 
was created in 1946-7, her preferences in the field chores, 
as well as her personal and family history. She answered 
my questions as we sat at her dining room table calmly and 
C080-BO-FN 8/27/80 
-58- 
matter-of-factly; only the tapping of her pencil on the 
table throughout the interview suggested any uneasiness 
with the very obviously running tape recorder. 
After the taping ended, she really warmed to me, 
and she gave rne many scraps of information and insights 
in the course of a pleasant, leisurely morning spent 
watching her prepare lunch for the hay crew and walking 
around the ranch grounds with her. 
As I was packing up the tape recorder and explaining 
how important it is for us to understand what ranching 
was like in the past, how it has changed and how it 
hasn't changed, Mrs. Knorr offered some of the aspects 
of life as it was when she was growing up that she 
doesn't miss and some that she does. 
Elaborating on her initial statement, "I don't miss 
the way we had to live when I was growing up," she 
mentioned that she especially appreciates the freezer, 
as they had no way of preserving .meat "back then". She 
explained that they used to cut ice from the lake and 
pack it in sawdust to keep things cold during the summer, 
but they still couldn't preserve meat. "They used that 
salt pork...salty as all get out. It used to make the 
chicken taste better." (i.e. chicken was a welcome change 
from salt pork). 
She said the thing that she missed from the old 
times was the family life. Today everybody is busy and 
they don't get to see as much of each other. She said 
that as a child 
^he/ had lived in a "kind of a special place" near 
-59- 
her mother's brother and sisters. They'd sse each other 
every weekend. How they don't see each other but once or 
twice a year. Everybody is split up and they're always 
coming and going. "I've been modernized, too" she said; 
they're always climbing into the car to go somewhere. 
Yet, sne also noted that she and Karl "aren't the 
kind to go out much"--sometimes they have friends up to 
play cards, which is fun. 
She took me on a tour of the outbuildings. As we 
were standing in the barn where they used to keep cows, 
she explained hbout their milking practices. They led 
the cow into the stall (a narrow passage partitioned off 
from the rest of the interior of the log building by 
boards), it put its head through one of the openings, 
and they'd milk it. I said that it must have been hard 
work. Mrs. Knorr responded that she liked milking--it 
was "a. peaceful time". They milked both in the morning 
and the evening. They usually kept two cows at once— 
usually Jerseys or Guernseys--alternating milking them. 
How, because her daughters are no longer around, they 
don't have as much need for milk and no longer keep milk 
cows. When the girls had lived with them, they did the 
milking, too. 
As we walked out of the cow earn, she pointed to an 
alcove on tne left, where they keep grain that they buy 
to feed the cattle. Next to the cow barn is a shelter or 
shed. Here she said they bring sick cows or cows at 
calving time. 
She described the method of "pulling calves"-- 
C080-BO-FN 8/27/80 
-60- 
helping the cow to deliver the calf—which is especially 
necessary in the case of cows calving for the first time, 
as they're small and usually have a nard time. She 
pointed to some instruments hanging on the far wall 
that are used in delivering the calf. There were some 
forceps, out, sne said tney usually use the chain instrument 
hanging next to them. Wrapping it around her wrist in 
demonstration, she said they would hook it around the 
calf's leg (wrap around onee and place the nook through 
one of the links), tnen grasp the handles dangling 
from tne chain and pull tne calf out. 
We walked across to a metal structure--th^iew workshop 
tney had recently aad built. She pointed with amusement 
at the hooKS suspended from the right interior wall 
wnich were to serve to hang tools from; they were made 
from horsesnoes. She said she didn't know wno nad done 
that. Tapping the concrete floor with her foot, she 
said, "we should have dances down here, shouldn't we?" 
I asked her if they square-danced; she replied that no, 
tney mainly do round dances, that Karl doesn't like square 
dancing, although she does. 
Sne showed me her greenhouse, which is attached to 
tne yard-side of the house. It stays warm in winter by 
the heat of the sun and a small heater set low in the 
wall near tne entrance. She raises flowers and tomatoes 
here. "My sister said she wouldn't keep flowers nere. 
She'd just keep lawn chairs. She likes to sun-bathe," 
she laughed. 
Her garden is set on the opposite side of the house, 
CO80-BO-FN 8/27/80 
-61- 
just above the creek. as I admired it, I asked her 
hcv she decided what vegetables would go where. She 
replied that she "just put them in". This year she had 
put the potatoes at the opposite end from where they had 
usually gone—they did better in the old spot, she thought. 
Sne pointed to the yellowing leaves of the spinich where 
frost has already damged the plants. in her garden she 
raises cauliflower, oroccoli, beans, peas, spinich, lettuce, 
kale, potatoes, carrots (and radishes?). The root 
vegetables do not su Her from frost damage, although the 
* other vegetables are subject to it. 
I asked her where she'd learned about gardening_ 
from her grandmother, she answered. Had her grandmother 
nad any "rules of thumb" about when she put the vegetables 
m? No' according to Mrs. Knorr, her grandmother would 
just declare it was time to put them in. As a child, she 
had helped her grandmother in the garden, but she didn't 
lixe hoeing the beans. she doesn't like hoeing and weeding. 
V*e also walked past the smoke oven in the 
fenced yard to the rear of the house. Mrs. Knorr said 
that she now uses her electric smoker, but occasionally 
uses the outdoor oven which cooks much more slowly, taking 
two (?) days to do the job. The electric oven is more 
convenient; she noted, "I don't have to run my legs off- 
stoking it with wood. 
She took me down to the basement floor to see the 
"meat room", where they cut up and freeze their meat. 
A large cleaver and some other instruments hung on 
hooKS suspended from the ceiling. These are also the 
coco-bo-kw b/z//ti(j 
-62- 
hooks they hang the carcasses from. She pointed to 
the two small windows^high up on adjacent walls in this 
section of the room. These provide good cross-ventilation 
keeping the meaj; pretty cool as it hangs. It usually 
hangs for a period of about 10 days in the early fall or 
early spring when they butcher. 
On a taole under tne meat nooks sat a new dehydrator; 
Mrs. Hnorr pulled out some trays so that I could see 
the fruit she has been drying. She is mostly drying it 
in prepartion to take it up to her children in Alaska 
because fruit is so expensive there and carrying canned 
fruit to tnem is impractical. 
Mrs• Knorr also opened her two box freeaers so 
that I could see the meat and fisn (as well as tne 
"bougnten oread"--used for a picnic, she explained) stored 
there. Her system of packaging chopped meat was to 
mark "B/berger" (beef burger) or "E/berger" (elk burger) 
or "D/berger" (deer burger) on the white paper wrapping 
of the respective portions of meat. She pointed to the 
large plastic jugs also stored in the freezer—the "boys" 
fill them half full of wattr , freeze them, then fill 
them up the rest of the way with tap water and have cool 
water all day in the fields. 
Mrs. Knorr explained how the large, round, wooden 
block—the r&sat block--situated on the inner wall opposite 
the freezers was salvaged by Karl when the reservoir was 
filled. He had to cut and haul several large tcees at 
that time. She also pointed to the butchering chart on 
CO30-BO-FN 8/27/80 
-63- 
the wall (advising me to take my photograph of it square 
on so as to get a good shot of it). According to her, 
the same chart could be used in butchering beef, elk, 
or deer. They usually make the front quarter of the elk 
into hamburger, as that is the driest section of meat. 
Next she took me into her pantry, a medium-sized 
room lined with high, open wooden shelves on all sides. 
This is where all of her canned products and preserves are 
stored. It is extremely well stocked. I got a quick glimpse 
of 1-0ars of canned beans, canned tomatoes, stewed 
tomatoes, and assorted purchased canned products and 
baking staples. She proudly exhibited a large jar of 
her canned peaches--perfect bulbs floating in amber 
liquid. She also puts up pickles using salt, water,, 
vinegar and spices to steep tne cucumbers in. As we 
stepped out of tne pantry she said with a small smile, 
"I don't go shopping every day". 
Across from the pantry in the basement is a room 
filled with old furniture that she is refinishing. 
"This is my hobby," she said. She pointed to an old 
table that had belonged to her grandmother--probably 
not carried with her when she emigrated to Colorado, 
but rather bought here. That is her next project, and after 
that she will work on a dresser that belonged to Karl's 
mother and that is earmarked for her grandaughter. 
Later, as we sat in tne Kitchen and she put some 
home-canned beans on the range to cook, we discussed 
some of the seasonal ranching tasks. The first of 
CO80-BO-FK 8/27/80 
-64- 
October they bring the cattle into the nearby meadows. 
(Mrs. Knorr laughed about a recent visitor from the city 
who wanted to know how they brought so many cattle into 
the barns to feed them.) During the winter it takes the 
men until about noon every day to bring the hay in to 
the cattle from the stacks. They have to break a trail 
through the snow the the hay stacks with a "cat" (cater¬ 
pillar tractor). The haystacks aren't covered to protect 
them from the snow; if they are stacked correctly, with 
the hay laid evenly over the top and mounded heavier at 
the middle, it sheds water. After the cattle are fed, 
the men work on the machinery, sharpening sickles for 
example, and doctoring the animals the rest of the day. 
"There's always something to do." 
They don't often have the veterinarian, Dr. Colburn, 
out. (Mrs. Knorr said she has difficulty remembering 
his name because she confuses it with that of his 
vA° strsitA oi vet A>r iwy year* 
predecessor, Dr. Blacfy) . One of the ailments they 
treat is pneumonia, which the calves are susceptible 
to. She noted that Karl keeps a considerable stock 
of medicines on hand for the animals. 
Mrs. Knorr explained that Karl worries a lot about 
the ranch; he worries about the weather and is always 
anxious to get things like haying done and over with. 
She takes the view that the weather is going to do what 
it is going to do and there is no use worrying about it. 
She was surprised when Karl agreeed to take the fishing 
trip to Oregon that they will be going on this weekend 
C080-BO-FN 8/2 7/80 
-65- 
because it falls right during haying. She guessed that 
he had expected the haying to be finished, but rain, 
equipment failures and tne slowness of the new haycutters 
they are employing this year are slowing them down. 
She said that she had told Karl that maybe it would 
rain the entire four days they would be gone and he 
won't have missed a thing. Anyway, she said, the workmen 
can handle the naying--that's what they hire them for. 
V.e talked about irrigating; the ranch is watered by 
creeks; Cataract Creek for this part of the property, 
Black Creek farther over and then Otter Creek. She said 
they never used to nave water chutes for determining how 
much water they used. She has never done any irrigating-- 
she wouldn't like all that "shovel work". 
I asked her where she had gone to have her babies 
delivered. The doctor in Kremmling (the one that they 
had entertained the evening oefore) had delivered them 
both. There was no hospital in Kremmling then--just an 
old house with an emergency room and some beds. Their 
doctor is still practicing; although he has already tried 
to retire once, he returned to practice by popular demand. 
She is expecting a call from her daughter in Homer, 
Alaska any day, as the daughter (her younger child) is 
expecting a baby. Mrs. Knorr is ready to fly up and 
oversee the whole affair on a moment's notice. She

obviously dotes on the one grandaughter sne already has; 
she mentioned her repeatedly throughout our conversations 
and brought some snapshots of her out to show me. She said

she sees the grandaughter*. April, every 6-7 weeks. April 
is always underfoot in the kitchen when she visits, 
but Mrs. Knorr doesn't mind, "That's how they learn". 
Mrs. Knorr maintains fairly close connections with 
her daughter in Alaska, talking to her by phone every 10-15 
days; "We tolcl her Daddy and I have enough money to pay 
the phone bill." Her daughter in Fort Collins, Colo, 
sees Mrs. Knorr's mother frequently, as she lives there 
as well. 
Mrs. Knorr had me walk out to the mailbox, located 
at the side of the road, with her. "Karl laughs at me. 
Even if we come home at midnight, I go out to check the 
mail. I might have some mail from my kids. He eats 
ice cream before he goes . to bed; I read the mail." 
Rusty and I left at about 11:45 after thanking 
Mrs. Knorr and bidding her good-oye and good fishing.

belongs to the Knorrs. Rusty quickly recorded it. It 
seems to be made from two log building joined together.. 
Stopped on our way down the road towards Route 9 
to say good-bye to Karl Knorr, who was doing the final 
clean-up on a high meadow on the west side of the road. 
He was handraking hay under the ramp of the slide stacker. 
He commented that the hay is really too wet. Rusty and 
he shook hands and we said good-bye.

Phoned Mary Ann Gilliland (122 Northside Ct., Brecken- 
ridge, phone: 468-6273) whom we had been told would be 
putting out a book that included local ranching history. 
(I believe Ms. Rebecca Waugh at the Historical Society 
gave us this information). Ms. Gilliland said she is 
not putting out such a book. She did recommend that we 
get in touch with Meredith Burchman, the head of a 
PEO project -£s=as collecting oral histories from women, 
including some ranch women, entitled "Women as Tall as 
Our Mountains", which is quite possibly out of print. 
jeep ride with John Farr to Rexford, an-old mining 
camp, and up 'Wise Mountain, overlooking the Blue River 
Valley. On our way out Tiger Road, John pointed cut 
the old abandoned dredger and the site of Tiger mining 
camp, not an old earn,. according to Jonn. As we rode over 
the rough terrain in John's four wheel drive, we discussed 
some of the terms for geographical features. As John 
explained, the term peculiar to Colorado is "pari". The 
derivation of the term is apparently unknown. Not only 
does "park" refer to the larger regions of South, Middle, 
and North Parks, but it can also refer to an opening in 
the trees, e.g. a meadow. 
We used the opportunity of this drive to interview 
John bbout his personal history and to discuss nis views 
on the Rocky Mountain region and the High .Mountain Museum. 
John guided us through the site of Rexford, an old 
mining camp. We first walked past the ruins of the ore 
o o —uo — r L\ kj / / o \j 
-69- 
processing mill. As we walked, Jonn explained that this 
had oeen a company town Delonging to the Rexfora Mining 
Co. Miners at this elevation worked against a deadline-- 
winter. Winters vere harsh above ground; below ground 
a constant temperature maintains all year (approx. 60° F) 
so underground work was done in tne winter with the cabins 
used for seeping and eating. In tne summer, the miners > 
worked outside. • s 
We reacaea a spot where we could watch the creek 
flowing downwards. John explained tne principle wnereby 
-in an economic enterprise such as this one, every expenditure 
of energy--wnetj,er by animals or nu.nans—is costly, particularly 
oIevrt~i~rr_ when one is moving against the force 
Ot-V-tvs 
of gravity. Therefore, mines were built into hills to 
utilize tne downward flow of gravity for processing and 
transportation. The mill operated by waterworks that would 
dump the ore on the high side of the mill wnere it would 
be carried through processing. 
Occasionally miners struck the minerals they were 
one c*01 H-ty lAJve fth Jrrv* 
seeking (usually gold or silver) in pure form; more often 
it was in chemical composition with otner minerals from 
which it had to be separated--usually a difficult and 
expensive prospect. Tne rock had to be crushed and 
the minerals extracted by being heated in a boiler fired 
with wood; this was the function of the mill we saw 
below. The volume of the ore increases 60% by being crushed, 
which explains, even with seemingly vast amounts of 
crushed rock that we see as tne remnants of mining projects, 
the mountains that rock came from still remain.

As we walked down to and gazed at the mill ruins, John 
explained that they constitute a -very large operation. 
This would represent a remarkable logistical feat considering 
the altitude and the terrain in which it had to be built. 
Yet, there is little or no evidence of 11 tailings"--the 
crushed, discarded rock--in the creek below the mill. 
This indicates to John that the mill was never operated. 
He feels that it vas probably the product of a promotional 
scheme. Intelligent people--many of them English or 
European investors, lacking other opportunities for 
rapid money making, were willing to stake their money on 
distant mining ventures, although the enterprises seldom 
produced much material benefit for anyone except tne 
promoters. (nevertheless, there were sometimes returns.) 
We walked to a collapsing log structure farther down 
on the slope on which the site is located. John termed 
this a "bunk" ( a feed bunk or manger for mules) and 
pointed to a trough on tne right side wall (as we faced 
the structure) where tne animals would have been fed. 
q John commented on the construction, pointing out that where 
water had entered the ends of the logs they had rotted; 
as long as tne sides of the logs aren't processed, they 
remained sealed and don't rot. Wood and clay were used 
for chinkipgi.iwalls were. then-, covered with newspapers, 
to create air spaces so no wind entered and the building 
remained warm. "Oaktight" was also used for chinking. 
It was a kind of fiber--but after being put in place it 
tended to dry out and shrink, making the building arafty. 
Log construction has been out of favor for about the last 
C080-BO-FN 8/28/80 
-70a- 
20 years. In current log building techniques, fiber glass 
and urethane foam are used as chinking materials. Buildings 
stood longer if they were built on foundations. 
John pointed out that everything here depended on 
logs: fire, shelter, and the operation of the mine itself. 
So, although subsidiary to the mining industry, the logging 
industry was vital to the support of mining operations. 
He noted that inhabitants of these operations tended 
to cut everything around them--this slope was bald 100 
Building 
years ago. logs were set into place either by hand or 
by using animals and a tripod--in either case at enormous 
effort. 
John picked out a small sapling and demonstrated 
how the split in its top shoot would eventually mar its 
growth, causing it to grow broad and bushy, rather than 
tall and straight. It would thus inhibit the growth of 
vegetation under it by limiting their access to the sun. 
It would also create ground clutter that would make it 
difficult for game to maneuver. He mentioned the concept 
of "clear cutting", which is practiced in Swiss forest 
management, wherein trees such as this one would be 
selected for cutting to aid the overall growth of the 
forest. He also pointed out on this tree how the branches 
on the north (?) side of the tree grew shorter 
C080-BO-FH 8/28/80 
-71- 
than those on the south, creating a kind of lopsided effect. 
As we walked back to the car, we noticed the many 
rusted tin cans strewn on the ground; according to Rusty, 
they were referred to as "air tignts". 
John drove us up to the top of Wise Mountain, above 
the tree line (elevation ca. 13,000 feet). There we 
walked to three of the mine shafts dug through the tundra 
(Wo,el. and down into the mountain. The shafts were supported on 
cOT0-6o-u,rn«- n 
all four sides with horizontally laid logs. Two of 
the shafts had rather elaborate log structures protecting 
"the openings. All of the logs used in this construction 
had to be hauled up the mountain frmm below. I marveled 
aloud at the amount of effort that must have gone into 
building these shafts and asked if there couldn't have been 
a simpler way of constructing.them. John replied that, 
cheap as human life was back then, there really were greater 
ssafety measures taken to prevent accidents in these mines 
than in contemporary factories back East. 
We walked to the breast of the hill and stared out 
over the surrounding peaks and valleys. John pointed 
out landmarks, describing how the Continental Divide dips 
around at this point and lining out with his finger where 
it runs across the range. 
We made our descent from the mountain, finishing 
John's interview and talking about the evolution of John's 
idea for the High Mountain Museum. We touched on his 
love of the high mountains, his disillusion with the 
federal land management agency f- - A 
COSO-BO-FK 8/28/80 
-72- 
(Dept. of Agriculture) he had worked with, his understanding 
that any phenomenon--whether of nature or culture--has tt> 
be interpreted to be fully appreciated by visitors, his 
experiences of other museums in the area, and his meeting 
with Rusty Marshall, a person he recognized as having 
cogent ideas about open air museums in addition to a real 
appreciation for John's own territory. J<J®» went on to 
speak about his vision of the museum as a place that would 
interpret the area holistically, incorporating wildlife 
and natural history into the saga of human existence in 
the area. He emphasized the idea of the interpretive center, 
where displays and information in the form of various 
saodia presentations w7ould be available at all seasons of 
the year. 
Farrs' for dinner. 
Visit with Charlie Lund so Like could finish her 
interview with him. Arrived at 9 p.m. As we were climbing 
out of the car, a young man who had driven in in his 
small pickup truck just after we did came up and greeted 
us with a rather questioning look. When we stepped into 
the kitchen, Charlie, two or three young men, Pauline and 
Sherri were just sitting down to dinner (of fried fish). 
Sherri showed us into the living room. It was quite 
orderly, especially in comparison to the kitcnen. As 
Rusty commented, it looked like it wasn't much used. Sherri 
agreed that it wasn't used much in summer. Rusty asked 
CO80-BO-FK 8/28/80 
-73- 
which chair Charlie would prefer to sit in. Sherri 
replied that it didn't matter; he would sit anywhere. 
She left us with her photo album--a series of recent 
shots of ,her and her friends on the rai ch and the vicinity 
and some of Charlie. Rusty set up using tne shotgun 
mike with windscreen to pick up Charlie's rather unclear 
speech as distinctly as possible. Charlie joined us 
presently; as the noise of talk and laughter was quite 
loud from the adjoining kitchen, Rusty drew the door 
closed. 
bike and Rusty spoke with Charlie about his past and 
about his rancn. I pnotographed. I was interested to 
hear taht the ranch was once also used as a dude ranch, 
though never with many guests. Cnarlie also spoke briefly 
snout a Christmas custom, tne ”Luchtfest" (?), which was 
celebrated oy eating a special fisn--a "stockfish" he 
believed it was called. Otherwise, Charlie indicated 
that his family had retained few of their Danish customs. 
The interview ended about 10 p.m. Elke suggested 
that she might like to come back again some time to talk 
with Charlie some more. She assured him she would let him 
know in advance, and he agreed that this would be a good 
idea, as he is often away from home. (Elke had already 
learned that he is planning to take a trip to Peru with 
some of his neighbors in the near future) 
We thanked him and left.

Day 12--29 August, 1980 
Tour of Grand County area and museums. 
Drove first to Rocky Mountain National Park to visit 
the Ilolzwarth Homestead. Parked at the highway turn-off 
where a marker announces the Homestead, although nothing 
of it can be seen from the road. 
Walked down a short path ta a restored cabin set 
at the beginning of the ^ mile path to the homestead 
complex. Inside the caoin were some printed descriptions 
of the families and the Indians that nad lived in the 
area. Rusty painted out several spots where the cabin 
had been amateurishly restored. Particularly noticeable 
were wooden pegs that had been driven into the door frames 
as bucks--an unautnentic attempt at nail-less construction. 
.tike and I picked up printed leaflets from the 
box at the beginning of the path to the homestead. They 
describe the complex and its history. Visitors have the 
option of returning them when they are finished or 
dropping a dime in the box (or being dishonest). 
Passing a grazing horse in the field to the left of the 
path, we arrived at the homestead site and took in the 
log buildings, grazing goats and scattered equipment 
.in a brief glance and a few camera shots. 
Entered the main, "Mama Cabin"--thr main rooms: 
a living room; a bedroom with two large beds featuring 
hand-made bedding, appropriate furnishings and family 
photographs; a kitchen (to which the visitor is inevit¬ 
ably drawn by the smell of baking sourdough bread). 
COSO-BO-FN ■ 8/29/80

There we encountered an interpreter dressed in jeans 
and a cowboy shirtwith the sleeves rolled up, and 
boots, expertly tending to the bread. He gave us a good 
deal of information. Ke is a seasonal ranger, has 
worked at the site for the past 3 summers, and 
lives in the area—near enough to commute every, day. 
In the winter he skis. None of the staff were trained 
^ecially for this work. There are five permanent employees 
this year: two women and three men, some of whom live 
in the surrounding cabins. At least one of the employees 
is from the Student Conservation Association. They 
also get volunteer help from the Youth Conservation 
Corps. Tne season is now nearly over and some of the 
employees have already left. 
The interpreters do not try to impersonate the 
Holzwartn family members—they simply dress in appropriate 
style, "sort of". They try the old methods" as their 
interests dictate; for example, he had experimented with 
curing animal hides and taxidermy "using Papa's books" 
(the printed guide notes that Papa earned extra money by 
setting up a taxidermy shop on the ranch, having learned 
the skill •^'•^correspondence course). The interpreter 
nored that they also make sauerkraut, dandelion wine 
(not for visitor consumption) and the sourdough bread. 
The recipe for the bread comes from a source other than 
the Holzwarth family. (He also noted that the butter 
they serve with the bread is not homemade, as health lavs 
won't allow then to serve unpasteurized products.) They

also make lye soap. 
The interpreters cover various sites on the premises 
on a rotating nasi?; the assignments include "kitchen 
duty", "laundry duty" (doing the wash in old tubs located 
outside the back door of the Mama cabin),i "goat duty". 
At eacn duty tney meet and answer the questions of any 
visitors that walk up. 2?his interpreter mentioned that 
they used to run guided tours of the homestead, but that 
they simply couldn't nandle tne volume of visitors-- 
450 visitors on peak days--that way. He feels that it is 
preferable to let tourists enjoy it at their own pace 
and have the interpreters "do their own domonstrations"; 
he noted that some visitors stay all day and enthusiastically 
help out with the cnores. Ongoing activities that were 
apparent upon looking around were rug weaving, chopping 
wood, and tending the small garden (we were told that 
the growing season is only 60 days and all they grow is 
radishes). 
This interpreter supplied us with more information 
as we looked around outside. He impressed upon us that 
whatever is done on the site is done on the initiative 
of the staff; the livestock (chickens, 2 goats, rabbits, 
pigs) are cadged by them. He expressed the opinion that 
a dude ranch witn just one horse "just doesn't make it". 
The employees are also expected to maintain the buildings 
and grounds, altnough they have no specific training 
in maintenance. He pointed out wnere the foundation 
of the taxidermy shop is being eaten away by Hater and men- 
C080-30-FB 8/29/80 
-77- 
tioned that the logs need to be treated with linseed 
oil, the sod roofing on the ice house needs replacing, 
and the buildings all need to be rechinked. They 
perform these tasks through a process of trial and 
error. 
He commented that funding this site is not a park 
priority--it is hard enough to meet the supply costs 
for the sourdough bread they turn out in quantity for 
the enjoyment of the visitors. 
- He did comment that tne stafffis given ample "reading 
time" in which to study the period and the particulars 
of the Eolzwarth Homestead nistory, and that they have 
access to 79 tapes made by Johnny Eolzwarth about his 
experience of life on the site when it was a working 
dude ranch. Tney recently received a visit from Johhny 
himself. Because the national park acquired the ranch 
from the Eolzwarth family completely intact, there was 
no need to seek elsewhere for collections and they can 
consult with Johnny Eolzwarth about placement of furniture, 
etc. 
Pointing to an old wagon lying in the main yard, 
the interpreter mentioned that at one time they brought 
all the visitors in from the highway by wagon. However, 
they discovered tho«t the visitors became too preoccupied 
by the wagon schedule and how soon they could get back 
to their cars to enjoy the site. The interpreter's feeling 
is that it is good for the tourists to get out of their 
cars for a little walk. 
CO80-BO-FN 8/29/80 
-78- 
The interpreter indicated that the extent of their 
interaction with the rest of Rocky Mountain National 
TxSr.aiicalty' 
Park is that they are^ presented with "road-killed" 
deer, hauled in by other park rangers to use in their 
tanning demonstrations. 
The Holzwarth Homestead received 18,000 visitors 
last year and has already topped that total so far 
this year, according the young ranger. Stating his 
own perspective on the site, he commented at one point 
that in three years he had done as much as he could 
do here and was hoping t;<b be re-assigned. 
We did not spend mucn time looking at the site. Ws 
looked into the taxidermy shop—set up with tools and 
workbenches and hides in various stages of treatment, 
lying where visitors can touch them. Vie also walked 
through Twin I cabin—neatly, though sparsely, furnished. 
Returned to the car—critiqued the museum as we drove 
out of the park towards Grand Lake. 
Stopped at Marshall vacation home on Grand Lake. 
Lun-ch in Grand Lake (Scandinavian Coffee House) and a 
swift look at the shops. Seems to do a fairly booming 
tourist trade. 
Hot Sulphur Springs—Grand County Historical Museum. 
The museum building is a restored schoclhouse building 
consisting of three fairly large rooms opening off a

-79- 
narrow front hall, a side hall with offices, and large 
restrooms with old fi tures—the whole neatly painted 
white and nicely kept up. 
•photor co*o-to-s v«;e walked first around the outdoor exhibits: a 
collection of covered wagons (2), an old plow implement, 
a wagon bed, a low log structure, a log jailhouse and 
a log County Courthouse building. The structures seemed 
in fairly good repair from the outside; presumably the 
interiors are unfinished. Except for the signs on the 
jail and the courthouse, there was no printed interpretation 
of the exhibits. 
We went inside and examined the contents of the first 
room. It was lined with displays of school attendance 
books, old school photographs from local schools, household 
equipment, and agricultural and mining implements, all 
neatly captioned. The center space was occupied by a 
four-part photograph display showing scenes of the various 
towns (Hot Sulpnur Springs, Kremmling, Colorow) of 
\ 
Grand County circa 1900. 
The middle room--the largest in the museum—currently 
houses a display of entries in a local photography contest. 
On the edges of the room were the permanent exhibits--larger 
artifacts such as sleighs and old non-motor vehicles. 
The walls were lined with old, framed photographs. 
The third room featured still more photos, adhering 
to the theme of "Women of Grand County". They were not 
captioned, but one could pick up a typed guide to the 
photos as they stepped into the room if they wished. 
Here, too, was set up a surgion's chair and table of instru- 
o * JJs> “1 il U / 4- ZJ /

ments. These had belonged to Grand County's pioneering 
woman surgeon. There was also a quite complete display 
of ski equipment (on the order of the pair cf skis we were 
admiring at Knorrs1), photos and momentos. 
A small sales case stands in the corridor near the 
front door. In addition to pertinent local histories 
(primarily Black’s Island in the Rockies), it also offered 
postcards and small momentos for sale to benefit the 
museum fund. 
Rusty struck up a conversation witn Mrs. Janice 
Rayno (Genral Delivery, Grand Lake) who has recently 
moved to the area, is interested in local history, and 
is "babysitting" the museum for its usual superintendent, 
Ida Sheriff, who had to go back to work at her other job 
in the schools this week. Mrs. Rayno told us that 
a Paul Gilbert from Denver designed the museum exhibits-- 
in partial completion of a graduate degree, she believed. 
She suggested that we contact Ida Sheriff (c/o Grand 
County Historical Museum) for further information. 
Rusty also mentioned that he is acquainted with Patience 
Camp, who is on the museum Board of Directors. 
Critiqued the museum as we drove towards Frisco. 
Stopped in at Frisco Pharmacy to say good-bye to 
Bo Bogan. He was doing a friendly and booming business, 
as usual.

Made another attempt at dubbing with no success. Elbe 
and I logged our Charlie Lund and Mrs. Knorr interviews. 
Assessment of the project. About 10:30 p.m. Rusty, 
Elke and I sat down to discuss what our personal reactions 
were to the fieldwork experience--all quite positive. 
We talked about what we would change if it.were to go 
for a next year, when the concentration would be on 
hard rock mining in the Blue River Valley region. We 
agreed that the major change we would make would be to 
have more time--4 weeks at a minimum. We discussed the 
possibility of applying for grants to help finance the per¬ 
sonal expenses. We also agreed that the field team 
would have to be expanded, with participants of different 
expertise (I put in a bid for someone to fill the Ron 
Emrich role, being familiar with research with historical 
documents). 
We also discussed how Elke and I could obtain 
more experience recording buildings in the interim. 
Rusty suggested working for local historic building 
preservation societies in our areas. 
Day 13--30 August, 1980 
Packed, said good-byes, and departed Frisco, Colo.

Some Thoughts on the Colorado Internship 
Twelve days is not a long time in-which to develop 
insight into a region's history and culture; I would not 
argue that this is what I accomplished in my twelve days of 
working with Howard Marshall, Elke Dettmer, and John Farr on 
ranching history and folklife in Grand and Summit counties 
of Colorado. What I did emerge with was some intriguing hints 
about settlement history in this region, a wealth of impressions 
about the lifestyles of the people who occupy it, and a 
powerful learning experience concerning the processes and 
issjues involved in doing fieldwork. These I will continue 
to synthesize and reflect on for some time to come. 
In the flurry of the moment it was difficult to perceive 
how rounded an experience we were enjoying through our many 
activities. Its balanced contours could only be appreciated 
after the fact. 
Heavy concentration on ranching culture in the course of 
the fieldwork could have easily blurred our vision to the 
in some ways more significant mining history of the region. 
But an expedition led by John Farr to some spectacular mining 
sites and the daily physical presence of miles of dredge heaps 
as we travelled the area created a vivid impression and a 
constant reminder of a crucial phase in this territory's 
economic and cultural history. Moreover, they prompted me 
to reflect about humans' relationship to this mountainous, 
beautiful place—both their ability and their inability to 
adapt to its rigors, to at once appreciate and exploit its 
resources. Here I could perceive a real continuity extending 
Ddi-ueua ux i/acii 
-2- 
from the period of white settlement in the region to the present. 
The visual testimony of mines, gravel heaps and reservoirs 
current 
was supplemaated by our discussions about the/\impact of 
local tourism and real estate development in deepening my 
understanding about the inevitable interaction between humans 
and their environment that takes place here as well as in 
the "flat lands". 
This points out another virtue of the way we approached 
folklife research in the region: it incorporated both evidence 
of the past and an appraisal of contemporary folklife. Although 
the^ fieldwork nominally was designed to address matters of 
history, the play-off between present and past provided 
invaluable dimension in understanding both. I discussed the 
incredible rate of transiency in the local population with 
the Farrs, I heard from the county assessor how it affected 
the turnover rate in his office, I learned from Loma McKee 
about how it impacts on her involvement in community life, and 
I listened to ideas expressed by the Rotarians for generating 
tourism that would sustain the local economy. This had the 
effect of adding continuity and dimension to what I had read 
about the early forms of tourism and the unending attempts to 
search out economic opportunity in this region. 
jIn an undertaking such as this one, where field time is 
limited and research activities hinge on the schedules and 
responsiveness of others, each decision about where to devote 
one's energies seems crucial; time spent gathering information in 
one place means lost opportunities elsewhere. My instinctive 
assessment upon spending time during the latter portion of our 
Barbara Orbach 
-3- 
fieldwork with the Knorrs, who proved a valuable mine of 
information about early ranching in the valley, was that we 
could have gained more information about folklife in the 
region by dealing with them more intensively and devoting less 
of our energies to the McKees who, although they inhabit an 
old ranch site, are newcomers to the area. But, upon reflection, 
I realized that spending time with both families again -afforded 
us a valuable balance in our work. Together, these families 
helped me to understand aspects of Colorado's settlement 
history and the continuities between past and present on more 
than an intellectual level, and to gain a more vivid sense 
of the nature of ranch life itself. 
The Knorrs and the McKees represent two distinct stages 
in the settlement and development of the area. The Knorr 
Brothers Ranch is the product of early settlement and/|accumulation 
in the area. Its extensive holdings, despite inroads made 
by the Green Mountain Reservoir project and the recent sale 
of a parcel, allow it to remain a. viable, if sometimes overwhelming, 
operation. 
The McKee family's habitation of a sub-division of an 
older ranchstead is, on the other hand, the latest stage in 
a steady, incremental migration. Vera McKee, at least, would 
like to devote herself to full-time ranching, but their 
40 acre lot, even when supplemented by the meadowland and 
accompanying water rights they lease across the road, is 
.insufficient to sustain a full ranching operation. Rather, 
family members engage in a diversity of occupations—excavating 
and working in the molybdenum mines, for example—more viable 
in terms of current trends in the local economy. 
Barbara orbach 
-4- 
Despite the differences in their circumstances, however, 
both ranching families have had to contend with the quirks of 
nature and the long range trends and short range fluctuations 
in the economy which are accompanied by the varied forms of 
development, both public and private, ongoing along the 
ABlue in the last century and a half. Moreover, there are 
some shared qualities in the way they approach their life and 
work here. Every conversation with a family member made me 
aware of their basic individuality, but the ranching tasks 
themselves demand a level of cooperation that was quite remarkable 
to me, who is only familiar with the kind of individualized 
employments people engage in in my urban setting. Two scenes 
that I observed symbolized the cooperative facet of ranching 
for me. The first was the hay raking and sticking operations 
that I observed on three separate occasions and that I likened 
to a dance—guided by an intricate but very familiar choreography 
practiced by the people running the machines. The second was 
the doctoring session for the Callahan's colt, when six people 
quietly stood for nearly two hours•in the hot sun, intent on a 
single operation. 
Partly because our questions were geared primarily towards 
family history, I carried away a distinct impression of the 
importance of family in these people's lives and an understanding 
that tradition can exist here inside the family unit, without 
necessary relation to the immediate environment or the current 
•activities and practices of its bearers. The main thrust of 
my interview with Mrs. Knorr concerned the centrality of family 
in her life. The tale of William Smallwood, the McKees' 
isdx. udi ct umaen 
-5- 
"Choctaw Indian" ancestor amounted to almost a legend cycle 
within that family unit—I heard variants of it from members 
of each of the three generations living on the site. When 
Karl Knorr spoke about ranching history and his ranching practices, 
mostly 
it was framed^in terms of the contributions he knew members of 
his family to have made. Our encounters with these families 
drove home to me how much the family exists as an idea and an 
identity as well as an economic unit. This is, perhaps, why 
despite the fact the Charlie Lund is a bonified "old timer" 
with a long tenure on the land, I felt there-to be something 
amiss on his ranch. Not only did he have no survi-qng family 
and seem to retain little in the way of family traditions, but 
he was existing in what seemed a not particularly family-like 
group on his own property. 
The significance ascribed to family seemed to inform the 
attitudes of those we spoke with towards history and historical 
objects. Although the McKees operate amidst a clutter.of artifacts 
and notable log buildings, they seemed to demonstrate enthusiasm 
and care only for a collection of ©Id-family saddles that they 
■to vV>t *rt«. 
had broughtAwith them. Mrs. Knorr treasured those family 
heirlooms that she could connect with the personality.of the 
former possesor (and, perhaps, with a very real economic value, 
as well) and that she could aetively refurbish (put her mark— 
or stain—on?) and pass on to the succeeding generations. 
The understandings I achieved about regional history, 
the family and tradition through my contact with the Knorrs 
and the McKees were not novel or profound, but they did inform 
my thinking about W^ere and how I would conduct folklifa’.and 
iictjL Udi d UX t(cl(JU 
-6- 
historical research, collect objects to present the thrust of 
that research to a wider audience, and arrange such a presentation 
to be as meaningful as possible to that audience. 
Satisfying as my rather abstract explorations into the 
relationships between the family, the personality, tradition 
and history were to me, I was happily—and literally—brought 
down to earth by Rusty Marshall's emphasis on their physical, 
manifestations—the material culture of the region. The time, 
care, and patience that Rusty expended in teaching us about 
the forms, construction and uses of material objects was 
invaluable in starting me to consider what material objects 
can tell us (or rather, prompt; us to ask) about history, 
and to appreciate how vital the dynamic is between cultural 
tradition and environmental conditions. R..u sty's emphasis 
on methodically recording the widest conceivable context as 
well as the more minute details of those artifacts and events 
we considered,provided what I feel to be an important and useful 
model for conducting research. In the process, he introduced 
both the practical and the theoretical issues concerning 
historic preservation and presentation, which provided solid 
grounding to what could easily have become a rather academic 
exercise. 
Elke and I were given the opportunity to consider in a 
concrete way how community support for a cultural project is 
generated, by sitting in on a Rotarian club meeting where Rusty 
presented aspects of the research and the High Mountain Museum 
project, and by being encouraged by Rusty to discuss that 
presentation afterwards. Equally important were our visits to 
Barbara orbach 
-7- 
the existing museums in the area and the opportunities given 
us to critique these. I recognize with gratitude that in 
those visits the interests of the interns and the promotion 
of their critical thinking were.placed ahead of the interest 
in producing immediate, tangible field data. These expeditions 
served as an occasion for us to think realistically about the 
issues of funding, audience :c, physical design, and content-- 
all of which would be integral to the formation of any presentation 
that would attempt to communicate what we were learning about 
this region, its people and its history. The fact that we already 
had our format—a living history exhibit—in mind^made that 
thinking easier and more rewarding*. 
Equally important to my learning process on this trip was 
the fact that in our twelve days together, Ruisty, Elke and I 
acted as a field team. This gave me a fine opportunity to 
sample a much lauded, but seldom executed, form of research 
and to consider its virtues and drawbacks. I think in our 
case the effort was quite successful; the three of us were 
able to coordinate and cooperate congenially and productively. 
Because we are three separate personalities with different 
interests, our ears and eyes were tuned to different details; 
COWt>\fcMt-rv^orY jv*t 
thus, we rwere able to gain three ^perspectives rather thah^oae 
in any given field end$_jQ.vcor. By comparing notes afterwards, 
our overall perception of our encounters was expanded and new 
issues were raised. A case in point was when Rusty uncovered 
a prize artifact—an old ski—lying abandoned in the McKhe yard 
and perceived how the McKee's valuation of it chbnged as a 
result of his stated interest/. Rusty was surprised that this 
UUJL^Ui.U Uii>aLU 
-8- 
observation hadn't entered into either Bike's or my account 
of our interactions with the McKees. But the point was that 
this was Rusty's interaction with the McKees--conveying i^ 
to us only added to impressions we had formed through our own 
separate interactions and interpretations. 
Although we might have benefitted or produced more by 
splitting up more frequently (I found that some of my most 
intensive learning occurred out of^nece^'when I was left to 
my own devices) travelling as a team carried the unintended 
impact of making us appear more official or serious, I think, 
than a single one of us would. This has negative as well as 
positive implications, for I do think we'were on occasion viewed 
as somewhat of an onslaught. The pure logistics of three 
people concentratedly collecting information from the same 
sources may have caused us to overtax and overwhelm those 
we talked with—our interaction with Vera McKee springs to 
mind as an instance where this might have been the case. 
Obviously, it is impossible for three people to be as sensitive 
collectively as they might be individually, and I was often 
concerned lest we ride roughshod over our very obliging new 
acquaintances. Indeed, questions of ethics and etiquette 
recurred constantly for me throughout the twelve days; although 
we did touch on these issues occasionally in our conversations, 
I think we might have addressed them more squarely in evaluating 
ourselves and our effect on those we spoke with and, in some 
ways, influenced. 
I wouldn't have missed those days of combined effort in 
the field for anything. I think every field team should have 
such an initial opportunity to observe how their co-workers 
-9- 
operate and interpret and to hammer out their mutual focus and 
approach on this basis. Perhaps the only misfortune of our 
field experience was that it was too short. We had only reached 
the "hammering out" stage of understanding what we wanted to 
know and how each of us could go about finding it out when 
our newly achieved momentum was brought to a screeching halt 
by a circled number on a calendar. Even an extra week would 
have allowed us to become a fully operational team, in the 
sense that Elke and I could have become more self-initiating 
and self-reliant (one can hypothesize so, at any rate!). 
Although I appreciated that Rusty made us quickly understand 
that in this sort of research one must remain flexible and 
rise to opportunities whenever they present themselves, an 
expanded time frame would have allowed us to plan more 
effectively, putting all of our energies in the field when 
'that's where we stood, and setting aside time in advance 
specifically to be away from the field and to gather our 
thoughts, either jointly or individually. (A one-day declared 
holiday in memory of the field note would have been appreciated. 
My own note^a^ encled to be wedged in between pillows at night 
and slices of bread during the day, and thereby suffered what 
degradation my inexperience hadn't already contributed.) 
Saying that we acted as a field'.-team says reams about this, my 
itrstfield experience. As I told Rusty at the conclusion of 
the trip, in these twelve days I engaged in the most intensive 
and rewarding learning experience I have ever had. I hope 
that if my field notes reflect nothing else, they reflect this. 
The fact that I was at all times treated with respect, as 
an equal with a worthwhile contribution to make made this 
Barbara Orbach 
-10- 
learning possible. I was make to feel a full-fledged participant 
through my interactions with Rusty Marshall, Elke Dettmer, 
and the Farrs. Moreover, the unspoken cues—the thoughtful 
arrangement made by the Farrs for our comfort and entertainment, 
..and the careful, preparation carried out by Rusty in concert 
with the staff of the American Folklife Center bespoke the 
quality of my acceptance and the earnestness of our intent. 
I appreciate the faith with which all the people involved 
invested time—for extra planning, preparations, explanations, 
and special expeditions--and money in providing me with an 
introduction to a new region and a new field of research. 
I plan to prove it a sound investment. This field experience-- 
so sanely balanced between the past and the present, between 
the human and the material, and between the theoretical and 
the practical--marks my current studies as well as my daily 
activities and reflections. I would like to express my deepest 
gratitude to John and Leslie Farr and the Rocky Mountain 
Continental Divide Foundation, and Rusty Marshall and the 
American Folklife Center for making that experience possible.
