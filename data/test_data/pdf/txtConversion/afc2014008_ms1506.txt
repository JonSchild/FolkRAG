Dear Mike:
 
I have been talking your proposal workshop over with my guitar
 
teacher, Bess Haves, who is a folklorist at San Fernando State
 
College.  She is a highly original and creative person and has
 
had a lot of experience with children in groups.  She spent a
 
summer studying the games of negro children of elementary school
 
age and was telling me some of the ways in which these kids set
 
up the games.  She is not a member of Ortho but she seemed quite
 
interested when I told her about the workshop that was being
 
planned.  With your permission. I would like to bring her along
 
as a guest, if she can make it.  She is not certain that she can
 
,
.
.Ake it so it probably would be best to leave it somewhat f
lexible
 
.
f that could be arranged.  I am sure we would all be delighted
 
if there could be some way in which she might work in a few folk
 
o
ngs which i
sn't completely out of the realm of possibility since
 
know that you believe, as I do, in the multiple functions of
 
he ego.  Please let me hear your reactions to my suggestion.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Jacobs:

L
 
I got trapped, as usual, by the various end of semester crises,
 
never seem to 1e rr how to nice myselF; T hone the 1c
.
lnv
 
worried you.

.
 
a 7
-10 p.m. class on  :
onday evenings next semester.  The first flight
 
I can catch after 10:00 p.m. doesn't leave L
.A. until 7
:50 a
.m.
 
Tuesday morning, followed by another at 3
:25 a
.m.  Both take two hour
 
exactly to Portland.  Although I am happy to go to work as soon as I
 
can get to you, it would seem a bit unrealistic to plan to do too muc
 
on Tuesday morning.
 I haven't checked on departure times from Porti
 
to Los Angeles, as that seems to be less of an immediate problem ar
id
 
can be adjusted to suit everyone 's convenience.
 I have no classes o
 
Thursday =W assume that I will leave either Wednesday evening or
 
Thursday morning, whichever i
s easier.
 (By the way, I assume we are
 
still talking about March 5th and 6th, aren't we?)  The round trip
 
excursion coach fare from Portland to L
.A. is $84.36; I forgot to as
 
if the tax is included in that f12ure, but I sunpose that cr be Set  =
 
up later.
 
(
 r
 
rth considerin
.  would be ior me to be ir with an informal sessic
 
th your class and anyone else who might be interested during whic
 
would try to present my general intellectual position vis a vis
 
ikiore and folk music; this might possibly give a kind of framewc
 
r the future meetings.  What I often do in such sessions is to tah
 
e song or tale and do a sort of solo brain-storming session with i
 
:
ying to point out all the ways in which it relates to the surround:
 
1ture pattern.
 This is both entertaining (
I think) and stimulatL

vorite pieces of raw data for such a talk happens to be, by the
 
e Happy Birthday song; it's really remarkable how beautifully  '-
 
btly that sons' reflects many of our basic attitudes -
-
 which,
 
'
o many people sing it with so much enthusiasm.
 
Then there is the talk on percussive rhythms i
n
 
1
anc :usic, a rough draft of which I enclose.
 (This was trans crih
 
'
-om a talk I gave; I
'm in the process of writing it up in more form
 
nguage at the moment.)  I
f you want this topic covered, I think it
 
z
:ould be schedules, if possible, before the film showing, since I c
 
monstrate and teach some of the clap patterns which the students wil
 
ter see in a much more elaborate form; this seems to add to the intere

 ar
id I am told to allow
 
several weeks for the necessary lab work as well.
 I will, however,
 
bring the following:
 
SOiETIMES I
'N UP, SOMETIMES I
'M DOWN (30 minutes).
 This is
 
CBS Camera Three documentary I
've recently gotten hold of.
 It de-
tails the work done by Guy Carawan, who has been collecting for the
 
'ast several years on Johns Island off the Carolina Coast.  The f
il':
 
s made up of very beautiful still shots with a background of taped
 
frxerviews and music; the people shown are somewhat different fro
 
y?? St Simon's Islanders, but the general life patterns are much the
 
e
.
 I think it would be a good introduction to the following two.
 
BUCK DANCER (
10 minutes).  Produced by the Department of
 
thropology, San Fernando Valley State College.
 This film was sho t
 
cn a California location, so is no documentary, but it shows a sec--.
1:r
 
solo dance, the construction and playing of a cane fife, and the
 
clapping styles of the Georgia Sea Island Singers.
 
BRIGHT STAR SHINING IN GLORY  (25 minutes).  Produced
 
hnthropology Department, SFVSC.
 This was shot in a studio on our car
np c
 
it shows one spiritual, two ring-shouts (Afro-American religious darce-,
 
r
id one extraordinary religious dance called the "Buzzard Lope" which
 
c
:i: ad equately explain -- it is a kind of cultural sport.
 
Then there is the La Liorona talk -
-
 a highly mangled co-7y
 
a
. which l
':a enclosing.
 Unfortunately I seem to have only one carbon,
 
:d since I
'm corresponding on rewrites with Western Folklore at the
 
oment, I
'm afraid to let go of it.
 This is an earlier version,
 
would cut for purposes of oral transmission, but it will give yc
 
the general idea.
 I do apologize for sending you such a beat-up
 c
 
'
uctior
i.
 This may simply be too formal for your needs -
-
 besides,
 
ather you would like me to concentrate on the music end of thir
. s;
 
o  t
'.c other hand, it's about ghosts which are always pretty ec f
t r  .
 
\s  to the shape-note hymn sing, all I need is a roe'
 
ad so e people who would enjoy singing.
 Don't confine this to 
readers; I can teach by rote perfectly well and it doesn't matter really
 
If it doesn't sound very good.
 That's not the aesthetic point.
 However,
 
would appreciate it if you could have a few of the songs duplicated;
 
1et me know if you can and I
'll send three or four along.
 I have one
 
i
1ape note hymn book and can also bring a record or a tape of the Alabaa -'
 
C

 i
;nn convention, but you may already have this.
 
At this point I
'm beginning to wonder how much is practical
 
to try to cover; there is a limit to the human attention span, after all
 
:nd your people are going to get an enormous dose of my voice.
 I
'm
 
erfectly happy to do as much as anyone can stand listening to, thai
b,

Should we try to have two sessions on Tuesday and the f
il
 
showing that evening?  If so, how much would you want on Wednesday  -
 
three, four, five meetings?  You know the degree of interest of yo.
 
people better than I
.  As for the physical set-up, I prefer, where
 
visibility allows it, to be on the same level as my audience.
 Squ
 
rooms are always nicer than long skinny ones, and for participatio
 
sessions (hymn singing and clapping, for example) a semi-circle is
 
better than the railroad-car arrangement.
 I can bring either reco
 
or tapes or both, and I have a Uher tape recorder which is highly port-
able and quite adequate in volume for the average classroom.
 I supposr
 
that I am visualizing groups of thirty to fifty, which is the avera -e
 
class size around here; however, I can easily adapt to smaller or 1
.
 
numbers.  As for time, I can handle any of the subjects listed in
 
hour, but it's nice to have a little leeway for discussion.
 
I hope you will be
 
quite firm in selecting what you want
 
and what your students need mostfrom the above suggestions.
 I don't
 
feel strongly about any of the topics, and my ego is quite uninvolved.
 
A
nd I
'm sorry my letters are so interminable; my brother says its the
 
result of using an electric typewriter.  There's a thesis topic -
-
e influence of technology upon literary style.
 I am sure I would find
 
could be much more succinct were I writing with a chisel, or even a

I had known of it, and by then of course it was ovor,
 
Dr. Hasa had sent me a letter inviting ne t

conflict; either the message didn't reach him o

The members of the California Federation of Students wish to
 
thank you for your contribution to our organization.  Your obvious con-
cern for student problems on this campus is very heartening--doubly
 
so in light of the lack of response from other faculty members at this
 
institution.  Of 600 faculty members who were previously not directly
 
connected with C
.F.S. only yourself, Dr. Julian Nava, and Dr. Dalmas
 
Nelson have taken time to express interest in our struggling group.
 
As you may be aware, C
.F.S. held an open forum Friday, April 21,
 
from 10:00 a
.m. to 12:00 noon on the subject "Student as Nigger".  Your
 
generous contribution went toward the honorarium for our guest speaker,
 
Mr. Jerry Farber from Cal State L
.A.  You might further like to know
 
that Mr. Farber then donated this speaking money to UNICEF; thus your
 
contribution is serving a dual, and what we consider a very worthwhile,
 
purpose.
 
Thank you once again for taking time from your schedule to show
 
an interest in the student situation.
 
Sincerely

I
'm s
o glad your going to give a p
aper, and 1 don't care WHAT i
t's
 
on!
 
My favorite, though, is "
An Investigation of Negro Percussive Rhy-
thms--Hand Clapping and Foot Tapping (Sea Islands.)";  I
'd still
 
like for you to make the choice.
 
The program has not developed to the form of taking on a defihite
 
outline, but 1 do think i
t will work out that we would hrve time
 
for the film too;  w
ould that be possible?
 
Gene Bluestein thought i
t w
ould be nice to have a symposium with
 
you and maybe me on "Where have all the folk s
ongs gone? or Nobody
 
sings folk s
ongs any more. .  • ."
 I
'd like to have a talk on
 
that from him, but would rather not devote a whole session to i
t;
 
it does bring to mind, however, the possibilty of a s
ymposium on
 
the general subject of the relation of folk music to the popular —
 
ad perhaps to the classic--traditions.  We'll have to do that X
 
sometime

which comes about more readily when good habits of singing are established.
 
The importance of children's knowing the meaning of the text cannot be
 
over.emphasjzed.  We have all been shocked at some time or other by the
 
substitution of garbled phrases for such l
ines as:  "Land of the pilgrim's
 
pride"
 
Bess Lomax Haves, member of a distinguished family of collectors of
 
folk music  
,
_in-our-
 country and around the world, and a well-known folk
 
singer and teacher says this:  "Try thinking about what you are singing.  Get
 
into the song; believe in what you're saying when you sing; try to find some
 
sense of personal identity with the people who have sung this song before
 
you.  I think one of the greatest dangers in the current folk music boom is
 
that we may become so impressed by the virtuoso performer that we forget that
 
what really makes a folk song is its content, its humanity, its relationship
 
to life, its common-ness."
 
The school music program does much more than teach how to sing accurately
 
the songs designed for childhood experiences.  It means much more than the
 
acquiring of skill in note reading.  It is not enough to perform with good
 
tone quality and good musicianship.  It is necessary now, more than ever be-
fore, to sing the songs we know and love, the songs our parents knew and
 
loved, and the songs our world neighbors know and\love with an understanding
 
hear't.
 
HOW SHALL WE START?
 
We have suggested that one way to get s
inging started in the classroom
 
is to begin with songs you already know.  Share with your pupils the songs
 
you may have learned at camp,  at school, in college, or in your home when
 
you were growing up.  Encourage your pupils to share their favorite songs
 
from the previous grade, from camp, or from their homes.  Bring in outside

OUR PLAN
 
The Symposium is  presented as part  of the original  proposal to the
 
Office of Education by the Bellflower Unified School District titled,
 
Creativity and Participation in Music Education, and funded under the
 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Title III.
 
The Symposium has developed into an important first  meeting place of
 
ideas and people  internationally where Orff-Schulwerk  can be placed
 
in broad perspective to the needs and recourses of the United States.
 
The Symposium  is now a cooperative  effort among the many  organiza-
tions within the participating school districts and the Title III of-
fice.
 Your registration and attendance  give dimension  to the Pro-
ject underway, but more importantly, to the larger  problem of-commu-
nication about Orff-Schulwerk for American schools.
 
ADMISSION BY BADGE ONLY
 
Beginning with the International Reception, Sunday, April 30, at four
 
o
'clock in  the afternoon,  and continuing  throughout the Symposium,
 
admission to all activities will be limited to persons  possessing an
 
official Symposium badge.
 Individual tickets  can be bought for two
 
evening concerts which would admit a person without the weekly badge;
 
The Lieder Concert,
 Sunday night,  and the Carmina  Burana  Concert,
 
Thursday night.
 See registration and ticket information in the pro-
gram.
 
WEAR YOUR BADGE TO ALL MEETINGS:
 
OUR COMMUNITY CAMPUS
 
The Symposium activities take place in and around the Bellflower area
 
which  has become, already, an Orff-Schulwerk community.
 School bus
 
transportation  is provided for registered  out-of-town guests, and a
 
map for individual drivers registered for the neighboring  visitation
 
session.

W E L C O M E
 
We in Bellflower  are pleased to greet  each of you who is participating
 
in the Orff-Schulwerk Symposium.
 To most of us this is a new, fresh ap-
proach to music education.
 We have enjoyed  seeing its progress during
 
the last two years.
 The Symposium provides opportunity for many to ob-
serve and evaluate Orff-Schulwerk in an American setting.
 
It is a particular  pleasure to welcome  so many  visitors from  outside
 
California.
 You have come from  twenty-five  states and Canadian prov-
inces to join in this endeavor.
 We hope your Southern California visit
 
will be a memorable one.
 We hope, too, that you will  find time to see
 
other aspects of the Bellflower educational program.
 
Actually,
 five contiguous  school districts and a parochial  school are
 
participating in this experimental project.
 The enthusiastic acceptance
 
which these six centers have given to our staff has added  significantly
 
to the satisfaction and success of the project.

OUR TEACHERS SAY
 
"The children are encouraged to be spontaneous.
 They enjoy participat-
ing and look  forward to their music with  anticipation and excitement."
 
"The orchestra of instruments played by many  children has given variety
 
and depth to first-hand music experience.  This has added interest and a
 
feeling of being a part of the whole harmonious arrangement."
 
"The time has  been well-spent.
 The experience has  been unique in the
 
lives of these high school students."
 
"The  instrument usage  seems to  spark youngsters.
 There is  a strong
 
built-in motivation with the new sounds and the apparent ease with which
 
they seem to follow new rhythmic patterns."
 
"Our fourth grade  students,  who have been  in the pilot  class for the
 
past semester  are the most  enthusiastic music  students in  our entire
 
school.
 Even the boys who  had the "music is for sissies" attitude are
 
now eager to go to music class and participate whole-heartedly."
 
"Their excitement makes them into bright, eager learners.
 Best of all,
 
they'll never stop trying."
 
"Orff techniques are excitement, satisfaction and enlovment
 to the chil-
dren.
 They relate to others in the group.
 There seems to he something
 
for  every  child,
 and each  is challenged
 t
o develop  h
is  individual
 
skills."
 
"Of special interest was the creativity  expressed  i
n the development of
 
larger,  more  complicated  forms by  the combination  and extension  o
f
 
smaller ones.
 The development  of the concept of counterpoint  through
 
combination  of movement patterns  as well as melodic  and rhythmic pat-
terns was excellent."
 
"In many instances, the children in our school community come to us with
 
a very poor self-concept.
 The process of group participation has given
 
the children  self-confidence.
 This confidence  has helped  them to be
 
more eager to learn,  to cooperate with o
thers ood  to  shave 05
0 e3ponS
-
ble individuals."
 
"As a teacher,
 I feel the most gratifying expers ence of the Orff-Schui-
werk Project is the realization that all the children have had a feeling
 
of success.
 We created a very  interesting rhythmic  story to learn to
 
tell time.
 The children  have  demonstrated  creativity in  the use of
 
small balls, hoops, jump ropes and other physical education activities."
 
"I am finding that it is truly a simple, natural approach to introducing
 
children to the world of music."
 
"One pupil remarked, "Hey, I like working in the circle."  The fact that
 
he used the word "working" let me know that something had reached  him."
 
"I feel my  students are becoming very  receptive to music  and aware of
 
rhythms.
 They are not afraid of doing the wrong thing."
 
"They have also  acquired an attitude of fairness and respect for  anot h-
er's performance."
 
24
 
OUR TEACHERS SAY
 
"The project  has provided for our  children the opportunity  for all to
 
think of different rhythmic  ways for producing an idea,
 evaluating the
 
different ideas, and choosing the most appropriate."
 
"The children have learned  concern for ordered  procedure, a round cir-
cle, perfect square, straight lines."
 
"The class  enjoys taking a breather  in the classroom to  say a poem or
 
saying, or clapping a rhythmic question and receiving an answer."
 
"Children become more perceptive of what others do."
 
"Many  children are able  to put notes down  to show beats  in a melodic
 
phrase.
 This is very fascinating to them."

ear Mrs. Hawes:
 
On behalf of the Department of Child P
sychiatry here at
 
UCLA I would like to thank you very much for your most
 
interesting and stimulating talk last week.  The numerous
 
very f
avorable comments I have received concerning the
 
interesting and quite applicable material you brought to
 
us certainly makes me feel that we will very much wish
 
and hope to have you with us again in the future.
 
l
ithin a few weeks I will be preparing a summary and con-
densation of your presentation that is done with each of
 
our seminars, and would like very much to have you review
 
t
his and comment upon it for me prior to my f
inal drafting.
 
.
;
e attempt, in this way, to preserve the meaningful por-
t
ions of the presentations and also provide quick r
e-
referance to seminars we have held.
 
'
gain, thank you so much for the most interesting and re-
i
arding seminar.  I hope to see you again in the future
 
and perhaps discuss more of the applicability of folk lore
 
t
o the understanding of children and also perhaps discuss
 
t
he guitar and my interests there.
 
Very s
incerely yours,

On behalf of the State Committee on Public Education and its
 
staff I wish to express my deepest thanks for your participation
 
in our conference held January 25 -
 February 1 at the Claremont
 
Hotel.
 
I neednot remind you that the week was a demanding one.
 The
 
work you performed was one of the most crucial functions in the work
 
of the State Committee this year.  There was no possible way that the
 
Cor
nuiittee could have devoted its efforts to the review, analysis, and
 
digesting of the data collected over the past six months.  The staff
 
and Committee believed that this function needed to be performed by a
 
highly competent team that could get to the bottom of the issues and
 
state them clearly and honestly.  Your observations have become the
 
primary source for the preparation of the first draft of the Committee's
 
'
port.  During the balance of the year the Committee will deal with
 
material through one and two day conferences.
 
I must stress the dependence we placed on you to assist in
 
this difficult process.  You made a wonderful contribution and
 
satisfied our fondest wishes for the Conference.
 Thank you again.
 
Cordially,

 Some commented that they had tried the same principles as c

n
ost all remarked that it isn't the system of teaching so much
 
teacher's feeling of conviction in what she is doing.  Americ'
 
have changed systems so often they are becoming blase.
 
own impression was that the emphasis on the inter-relatior

 early attention paid to music
 
.
:
'nd the
 
greater degree of musical Freedom allowed the chi1dr3

 what I referred to at the m t  meeting as the repertoirc

 This kind of attack on the tabula ras:

 The other pet.
 
tial contribution from the field of folk music seems more doubtful t
 
mc: some
 t
x fxideas about the development of the indigo:"
 
American cultural language.
 Shulwerk seems to me firmly grounded
 
uropean culture history;  s
ince this is the basis of our "fine ar
 
tradition, I am not at all sure that the public school can.
,  at th.
 
time, go very far afield from that traditio:.

I got the impression from record shop displays  performers advert

 Oklahoma and Arkans."
 
Uillbill, however, is such a highly declassee type of music that
 
very much doubt whether either the schools or the community itsel  wo
 
accept its being discussed in a music education program.
 This appli': -
 
incidentally, even to its musical values as se' arated from the rener

 Jazz is pretty widely accented now by intellectual circle

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I am sure you have all heard the good news of the continuation of
 
the Title III Project in 0rff-Schulwerk.  We have been continued
 
until June 30, 1
968.  May I compliment you on the outstanding work
 
you have done for us and say "Kornmt Ihr wieder 1

0rff is alive, to begin with, and he, along with Dr.  erner Thomas
 
of Heidelburg University, have been discussing with Gertrud the
 
plans for the 1968 publication of the Orff-Schulwerk Yearbook. 
Therefore, we need to see you immediately upon Gertrud's arrival
 
back in California.  They want us to write a report for this issue
 
and the deadline, as I understand it, is in October.
 
The password is 0rff, the meeting place is UCLA Extension Building,
 
the time is 2
:00 o
'clock, Thursday afternoon, September 7
.  Gertrud
 
has a great deal to bring to us from 0rff and Thomas as they re-
viewed the progress of our research and development in Bellflower.
 
She has, also, specific ideas as to your area for the Yearbook. 
Consultant fees will be similar to those provided in the original
 
grant period.  Happy summer
 Lee  you then.
 
In his Jqrvice (Orff),
 
Martha
