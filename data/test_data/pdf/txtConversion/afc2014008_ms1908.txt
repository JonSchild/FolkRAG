on the part of all the players; lacking this, the entire group
 
shatters into passionate splinter units, the better to debate the
 
issue.  Not infrequently it can be observed that a group will use
 
the entire time available for play in a bitter -
-
 but apparently
 
refreshing -
-
 discussion over the "rules".  No one seems to mind,
 
really, that the game never gets played.  No wonder the decibel
 
rate of our school yards is so high; floating over our playgrounds
 
are the shrill intense voices of a thousand decision-makers at
 
work, testing, probing, re-arranging, counter-posing -
-
 all very
 
exhausting and unnecessary to a tidier minded adult world.
 
For variation is frequently productive of uproar; there
 
is absolutely no doubt about that.  However, it can also promote
 
flexibility and the knack of achieving compromise.  Our children
 
appear to have taken their cultural stance; they will cheerfully
 
risk chaos any day in order to preserve a satisfactory degeee of
 
group or individual autonomy.  And theirs is a more sophisticated
 
position than first may appear; for by the time children have
 
reached the game-playing age they have, by definition, learned that
 
there are some immutables, some rules that cannot be challenged,
 
or there is no game at all.  It is the area in which change is
 
possible that interests them most -
-
 and quite properly so.
 
For it is, after all, possible that the children are right,
 
at in terms of the democratic life style it is far more important
 
.r them to practice reaching and working within a temporary con-
sensus than to learn obedience to an unchanging set of requirements.

but as alternative and complementary processes -
-
 twin channels
 
through which the human control of the human destiny may flow.
 
It is easy to theorize about the necessity for flexibility
 
in American adult role behavior and the temporary nature of our
 
decision-making and codification processes.  It is-
-harder -
-
 and
 
i
ch more wearing on the nerves -
-
 to listen to the battle being
 
ught our under the classroom window, or in the streets, for that
 
i
tter.  However, if the foregoing observations are accurate -
-
 and
 
believe they are -
-
 it is plain that there are deep cultural
 
at work in our childrens' apparently off-hand selection
 
)
t only of what games they will play, but, more critically, how
 
i
ey will play them.  It seems that we should try to comprehend
 
i
ese processes better before we so casually -
-
 and so ineffectually
 
r
i
terfere by adminstrative fiat, invention or codification.
 
As adults, we stand to learn much; for clearly our children,
 
they play, are themselves grappling with an issue of central
 
importance to a democratic society -
-
 the interlock of order and
 
flexibility, individual freedom and group consensus, stability and
 
Change.

Play in aC-lO

in analysis.  As I watched  i
y two little  ,
irls, it became obvious that
 
the principal e
:;otional deli, ht of the activity for them lay in the
 
fact that thcy were doLr
i  more than playin  "torkeyfaces"; they were
 
also not playir  "tep on a crack, break your  i

 The
 
special quality of pleasure hin ecl upon their know1ed e of  oth  aes,

The folklorist tends to pose this kind of problc:  in ter s
 
of stability and variation in traditional forms.  And,
 ren deali
 
with children's traditional materials, he finds that he is confronted
 
by both di:
'nensions stretched to their utmost extent.

which are susce,tible to variation have much chance of survival;
 
and this may in part account for the lon;evity of the child's ow
 
tradition wherein variation f
lourishes.
 
I an suggesting, then,  that the apparently paradoxical co-
existence of rules and innovation within play may be analagous to t
ue
 
co-existence of stability and variation within oral tradition.
 Let
 
us see ho  this works in a few concrete situations.
 7ollclorists
 
someti.nes distinguish between two types of children's traditional
 
information: that which they learn from adult sources and that which
 
they learn from their peers.
 The games that 3utton-S:nith and :
.osenberg
 
1)
 
call "games of individual skill"  generally fall into the latter
 
cate
.:ory; such activities as jacks, ball bouncing and hopscotch are
 
generally learned by simply watching other children at play.
 
1ost of these games are extremely tightly structured.
 To
 
take th  game of jacks as an example, each player in turn must
 
maneuvre through a lengthy sequence of or orly and highly restricted
 
movements, any vari tion in which requires the player to give up his
 
turn to the next player.
 In actual play, however, in spite of the
 
large number of stringent requirements on which agreement is general:
 
(a player may not move any jack except the one in play; all jachs
 
must be picked up first one at a time .
 then two at a time and so
 
forth; a player who (
!oesn't catch the ball after one bounce has
 
"missed" and so forth) there are a large number of variables which are
 
free-floating and considered open to discussion.
 
The order in which the various moves (or sub-games) are made
 
is a cisc i

the traditional rules for

a variation factor, which is actually a part of the rules the selves

Law and order.
 The two words are almost inseparable these
 
c
lays; like "ham and eggs" one even wonders whether to use a singular
 
pr a plural
, verb in connection with the phrase.
 Perhaps this is part of
 
our current difficulty; perhaps they are fundamentally two quite d
if-
ferent processes.
 To make a rather sour joke, we have all observed
 
on our various campuses that when the "law" arrives,  "order" seems to
 
leave by the nearest exit.
 And if "order" is equivalent to "quiet",
 
our children apparently will have none of it,  though they se e m  to be
 
passionately interested in "law".
 
Let me make a rather simplistic observation.
 As I move
 
through my daily routine,  it seems to me that I operate on at least: two
 
distinct levels of social bejavior.
 There are some areas of action whichs
 
I never question; for example,  it does not occur to me to drive on which-
ever side of the road suits my temporary convenience.
 On the other hand,
 
there are relationships in my life pattern in which flexibilitiy i
s not
 
only not optional but actual y forced upon me, and in those areas, order
 
consists in my having mastered a whole sequence of social codes to which
 
I can adjust with speed and precision.
 When I sit in my dentist's chair,
 
I open my mouth as obediently as a three year old and gurgle agreeably
 
while he tells me all about his concerns; should he wander into my class-
room, on the other hand,  I would expenct him to sit down, he quiet, and
 
let
: me doX the talking .K
 
This sounds suspiciously like the bifurcated s
tructure of
 
traditional game rules which I have been describing and it would be
 
pleasant -
-
 though possibly dangerous -
-
 if time allowed further specu-
lation along the lines of the necessity for flexibility in American
 
adult role behavior and the temporary nature of our decision-making
-
and codification
 
process es.
 However,  it is clear that, even in the limited area of
 
the examination of play behavior, much more work needs to be done
 
12
 
before more than educated guesses can be made.
 For one thing, we need
 
to know much more about how children play instead of simply what they
 
play.
 And much might be learned from a systematic examination of a
 
n
'imber of  ra(1jriofIa} games in order to discover if any coherent pat-
tern exi s
t
:s determining which faeelE factors are stable and which are
 
in variation, as well as what kinds of variations are a
llowable.
 To
 
the best of my knowledge,  this has yet to be done.
 
However,  if the foregoing observations aro correct  - 
and I believe they are -
-
 it is quite clear that there are deep cultural
 
processes at work in our childrens' apparently off-hand selections not-
only of what games they will play but, more critically, how they will
 
play them.
 It seems L
 that we whould try to understand thn e  pro-
CC5 S eS  better before we so casually  -
 and so ineffectually -
-
 interfere
 
by parental fiat,  in
ntion, or codification.
 As adults, we stand to
 
learn much; for clearly our own children, as they play, are themselves
 
grappling with an issue of central importance to a democratic society -
-
the 
 interlock of order and flexi h
i I
i v,  indi v dnnl  initi ati yr  and group
 
consensus,  stability and change.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I
'm sure I remember that you were interested in contributing
 
to a "Game Book" when I called you about six months ago.
 Since I
 
haven't heard from you after the quite formal letter of invitation
 
went out it seems appropriate to  nquire now about your interest.
 
As you know, I was interested in your description of the circle
 
game roles at our San Francisco meeting.
 
Please let me know whether you are still interested in putting
 
your insight down for the kind of book we plan.
 
Sincerely,
 
Loyda M. Shears, Ph.D.

T  CIL)1?i "S PLAY AC IVI r
i ;
 
Some ten years agoi I was standing o
Ltarroon at the
 
gate of a southern California elementary schoolyard waiting for one
 
of my children 1t
se e-e
.
 The final bell had just rung and the
 
children were pouring out past me.
 
As the stream slackened, two
 
little girls aged, I should guess, about nine or ten walked by4 and
 
I heard one of them say, "Let's play '
Step on a crack, break your
 
mother's back'."
 
"yaw, I know a game that's lots better than that," her
 
friend said.
 "It's 'Monkeyf
 aces', and the good thing about 'Monkeyf aces'
 
is you can step on all the cracks, you can just stomp on those cracks,
 
you can wipe your feet all 2 1  thêScracks! The only thing is, you
 
can't step in a square that's got a monkeyface in it."
 
By this time, I had temporarily abandoned my own child
 
nd was trailing the two little girls down the sidewalk.
 Eventually
 
i
ey came to a square in the pavement which contained the contractor's
 
ymbol imprinted in the cement; apparently, this was a "monkeyf
 ace"
 
ecause they leaped over it withx
 kx 1føxtxai x axe ceremonious

care,.
 I watched them walk
 
away,  "stomping" with delighted giggles on the cracks they passed,
 
"wiping their feet all over"
 e and now and again taking big running
 
jumps over the dangerous "
inonkeyface" squares.
 
This rather pithy/p
t
 ent seems to me to contain
 
of the elements that make( the realm of play so intriguing and
 
so diffiestIxte complex.
 x

(9-10)
 of play
 
To use Caillois' definition/as
 
starting point, it includes
 e
zaerg
 whic
!h he finds basic.
 
taxpinyx  First, the play situation was free, not forced (physical
 
education teachers, take not
).
 The children elected to thetuselves
 
to play, thus restricting and l
imiting their own freedom of activity
 
by their own free choice -
-
 
±ayx tt
tian an absolutely essential paradox.
 Secondly the activity
 
was separate, not "
for real" but :
kza:
katndx
:kxxxltasi
axamo
ix
:t:kme distinguished
 
from all the other methods of walking home by ax
fx ±atti
tz a ±e
 
mutual agreement and shared knowledge
 
of the limitations ti implicit to this particular game.  Thirdly it
 
though on a very simple level
 
was uncertain,/the activity itself being unclear as to its outcome.
 
And fourthly,
 
it was unproductive 
except insofar as the children presumably xi
§zzkadxka eventually reached
 
their respective houses;
 
k
; however,
 
gvkktxgx2kaxz4
:xaxvt as soon as the game began, the arrival home became
 
not the essential objective of the-ae
-tiv
-ity but simply the terminal
 
point of the game.
 
*
 
Lastly, still referring to Caillois' definition,
 
the activity was R governed by rules, not the everyday traffic, rules,
 
but special rules within which l
imits they were free to improvise
 
and innovate -
-
 indeed, to "
play".
 
This latitudeiof the player .. . .
 i
s equally accountable
 
f
or the remarkable and meaningful uses of the term
 
"
play", such as are reflected in such expressions as
 
t
he playing of a performer or the play of a gear, to
 
designate in the one case the personal style of an
 
interpreter, in the other the range of movement of
 
the parts of a machine...  (
p.  3
)
 
I am deliberately omitting, as not germane to this particular paper,
 
Caillois' 6th characteristic, make-believe which he describes as xxism
 
essential to t
 a
axw ±
 play which dog& x
 involve rules.
 In
 
other words, play may contain rules or make-believe, not both.
 
in The incident 1 have been describing , however,
 
is even more complex than Caillois suggests.
 As I watched my two
 
little girls, it became obvious that the principal emotional delight
 
of the activity for them lay in the fact that they were doing more
 
than playing "Monkeyfaces"; they were also not playing "Step O
r a
 
Crack".
 The special quality of pleasure hinged upongt their knowledde
 
of both games, not just the one they elected to play.
'Were there,
 
indeed, two games; or was one
 p&y.. t
ha- reverse image of the other -
-
in that sense a oerrnissable variation in the rules?
 
The folklorist poses this kind of problem in terms
 
of stability and variation in traditional forms;aN ;xw Rnx and, when
 
dealing with children's traditional lore, he finds that he is dealing
 
with both dimensions stretched to their utmost extent.
 The historical
 
continuity of the child's tradition is one of the most remarkable -
-
though infrequently discussed -
-
 aspects of the human condition.
 
'
evolutions, wars, vast migrations of peoples  ppare tly1mve l ittle
 
effect on the world of the child.
 Spanish-speaking children in the
 
new world play the same singing games that the descendents of their
 
old world ancestors play.  Marbles, kites, cats cradle and h
iopxzetkx
 
hopscotch go back before recorded history; and as a child in Texas
 
I used to thimp on my brother's back in a guessing game mentioned
 
by Pliny.
 
.t  the same time, variation is apparently an essential
 
characteristic.
 One of the infuriating problems encountered in at-
i
.
 to or anize a collection of children's traditional thy
s,
 
!
ko x.: Hxx-.4
j
s:
ka:
fxis  that out of a hundred renditions of the same counting
 
it  rhyme, for example, almost no two will be exactly idential.
 And
 
i
eri adult intervention, print, and other stabilizing forces enter
 
Lhe  picture,  as  in  the case of nursery (Mother Goose) rhymes,  for
 
example, then the parodies begin.
 
(P
 
t in a counle oF nursery r
iyue nrodies from collection)
 
again, the pleasure intrinsic to parody -
-
 which is only
 
one kind of variation, after all -
-
 seems to lie in a kind of
 kx
 
double vision; one must know the original in øt order to savor the
 
adventuresomeness of the variation, and thus, to some extent, both 
are reinforced.  In this sense, it seems quite possible that only
 
i
ose cultural items which are susceptible to change have much chance
 
survival, and this may in part account for the longevity of the
 
child's own tradition wherein variation flourishes.
 
i
ot x
 
I±
 
I am suggesting, then, that the apparently paradoxical co-
existence of rules and innovation within play may be analagous to the
 
co-existence of stability and variation within oral tradition.
 Let
 
us see how this woxds works in a few concrete situations.
 Folkiorists
 
sometimes distinguish between two types of childrens'  traditional
 
lore: that which they learn from adult sources and that which they
 
learn from their peers.
 The games that Brian Sutton-Smith calls
 
"games of individual skill", generally fall into the latter category;
 
ball bouncing
 
such activities as maxitexT jacks,  ux xxa g and hopscotch are gene-
rally learned by simply observing other children at play.
 
Most of these games are extremely tightly structured;
 
to take the game of jacks as an example, each player in turn must
 
maneuver through a lengthy o
e
d sequence of m
, any variation
 
in which requires Ike giving up his "turn". In actual play, however,
 
the largyJ number of
 
in spite of Ike strid ent requirements mixtkoxgama on which gamex
 
agreement is general (a player may not move any jack except the ones
 
in play; tkaxhaitxwayxxotxbwuxcnxtwianxnxzuptximxtkasmxxomlixaxxix 
all jacks must be picked up first one at a time, then two and at a
 
time and so forth; a player x± Kt1
i
igXt11axäa**xNat who doesn't catch
 
etc.
 
the ball has x*ag
 "missed" aN xsgxfextI) there are an enormous
 
number of variables which
 
are free-floating and eempke
ly open to discussion.
 The order in
 
which the various moves are made is a case in point:  Most children
 
tart with "babies" (
sometimes called "plainsies") but after tkRtx
 
r
iy of the following may be required .

no bouncies
 
x1a Oer the se
quence has beet 
i reed unon, there are s
till
 
of points of play that are open to various kinds of setLleient:
 
what is to be done about "kissies" (two jacks that land touchin,
 
each other) or Thaysta
s" (
in which one jack lands on top of another)?
 
hay such j
acks be z xtx1
wnxax rethrown, or are they to be considered
 
" sses"?  Can you play "cart before the horse" (in which a player,
 
;
crking for example on his foursies is allowed to pick up the ten
 
acks in the order ot two, foud and four rather than four, four and
 
wo)?  In i yw between games, do you have to "graduate" (by throwin
 
the jacks in the air and catchir'  as n
ary a
s nossible on the h
ac
 
of the hand)'?
 
Agreement on all these latter points is only tecmorary;
 
only
 
all rules reached are considered to be in effect/for the duratio'
 
of the game being played.  Although
 who often play together
 
may evolve a mutually acceptable routine, should one or the other
 
grow bored with the arrangement, it is these points that would be
 
open to xamgmkiatism re.
btiation, not the "regular" rules.
 Essentially
 
the rules for playing jacks, then, are
 
-

'
 
constructed i
L4
 a variation factor which is actually built in
 
to the "rules"
 
and which
 
all
 
txKta tixzxt*
x has apparently successfully resisted/attempts at
 
stabilization.
 
Observation of other
 
many of them contain
 
traditional games indicates that/a similar ratio of stability and
 
variation factors.
 Even more
 
significantly, it appears that wk zE in games where the Rxmtmsx
 
rules have been officially stabilized by adult invention or decree,
 
children have countered by inventing their own z areas of variability.

such as  jacks, jump rope, marbles and so forth have either been 
for-
outright or are strongly discouraged.
 Official explanations
 
for this vary, but the general impression is left that the traditional
 
"
fighting",
 
james lead to
 they are disorderly and hard to
 
police.
 The children instead are encouraged (and in some cases, re-
quired) to play officially approved games: most prèm t
hently, tether
 
hall, handball and four square.
 
(Of the traditional games, hopscotch appears to kxvax xxJ§m itI x knxxux xx
 
be the principal one to have
 
assed the adult stability test; its an unvarying diagram øEEaRt 1at y
 
is occasionally observable painted on the playground blacktop.)
 
in the case of kke handball, tether ball and four square,
 
i
t

 however,
 
descriptions of the game are available in various manuals for physical
 
education teachers.
 The printed rules for handball, for instance
 
indicate that play stops if

b
. The ball is hit on the fly.

d
.  The ball rebounds outside the court boundaries
 
e
.  A player interferes with the play of another
 
f

The actual play of children in 4=e elementary school however discloses
 
that they ignore points c and f and, before play begins "tap" that

0-50s or pop-ups (Ball hits where wall and -

and so forth, through a list of perhaps twenty permutations.

If the above observations are  ccurate -

 it is clear that there are deep cultural processes at work
 
in our childrens offhand selections of what games they will play and
 
how they will play them.
 Generations of exasperated parents and t

Dear Bess Hawes,
 
"L T and
 rer on the Playground" probes
 
deeper into the subject (
 in my way of thinking) than do
 
either Sutton 9mith_Rosenberg or Cailloi s ,  If you  find any
 
"
clues hidden around sorne here as to where to go next", please
 
tell me.
 You convince me that, as a playground observer, you
 
are the objective clinici an , day afte r day tra ining
 your
 
slescope (
 right—end—to) on a child  or two or three, then
 
'
sversing your i@strwnent to look at the whole pattern in
 
arch  for a total meaning.  On page 12 you say "..  •  .  much
 
ght be learned from a sstem
,
.,tic exajr
iination .  .  •  this has
 
'
t to be done,"  I agree..
 
Again (same page) you say "..  ..
 if the foregoing observations
 
are correct •  .  ."  and I reply: Your observations and mine
 
al
arro substantiate each other.
 The relevance you state in that
 
last paragraph is the relevance to elementary education which
 
I think should be the modus operandi of the Tri—U project..  Paul
 
Olson agrees and, I think, I have helped him to agree.
 
Sutton—Smith, Robert Georges, Nancy Modiano, Ray Birdwhistell,
 
Levi—Strauss (The Savage Mind) and Piaget have given me a li
ie
 
help in trying-7
o find direction.  Maybe current research in
 
kinesics, haptics, proxemics will eventually produce useful
 
clues about where to go next.  But so far most of them seem to
 
me to be young_men_in_a_hurry.  And nobody in a hurry can find
 
out much about what goes on in the WX world of children's play.
 
Levi—Strauss, in what he can tell us about logic (
 systems of
 
relationships operating in totemic societies) suggests that
 
similar logical processes underly and direct fluid patterns in
 
children's play..  Our trouble is that the patterns ch±ige with
 
kaleidoscopic speed too great for sedentary, myopic adults to
 
perceive -
 much less,comprehend.  And what they
 
cannot see, they deny existence.
 
Thank you so much for taking the trouble to send the typescript
 
of your "Law and Order •  .  ."  It gives me a great lift as I
 
take off next Sunday for a week with the Tn —U, group in Lincoln.
 
You will be quoted daily.
 I shall tell them to look forward to
 
the spring -
 -
 as I do -
 -
 to your Harper and Rowe book.  Mean—
 
while, if you in your busy life, can find time to send me a
 
manuscript copy, I shall be most grateful.
 
Will Mrs. Beagle Jones, by chance, be in Atlanta for the APS
 
meeting? I should like to meet her.
 Are you Corning?
 
I hone so,
 
Thank you again.
 
Since ely,
 
Dorothy Howard

ithin t
he Anglo-American community,
 
i
t i
s s
till active w
ithin the Afro-American child tradition i
n urban as
 
well as r
ural areas of t
he m

he south.
 Observations
 
i
n Los Angeles i
ndicate t
hat the s
ame pattern i
s i
n effect on the west coast;
 
t
hat i
s, b
lack children p
lay s
inging games and white children, on the whole,
 
don't.
 Further,  i
t appears t
hat the r
epertoire of games p
layed b
y N
egro
 
children across t
he country i
s both h
ighly s
table and h
ighly dynamic; new
 
games (
usually r
e-workings or parodies of o
lder ones) appear and d
isappear,
 
but their essential s
tructure and s
tylistic characteristics continue to be
 
handed on from one generation of school children to the next.
 
The footage i
ncluded i
n t
his f
ilm was t
aken i
n December o
f 1
967 on t
he p
lay-
ground of a school  i
n a Los Angeles b
lack ghetto.  The p
layers are a dozen
 
fourth grade g
irls (
9  to 1
0 years o
ld) whose well developed r
epertoire had
 
b
een earlier brought to my a
ttention by a sympathetic t
eacher.  They had been
 
prepared for the experience of f
ilming by being r
ecorded both by the teacher
 
and by me, and by a previous v
isit i
n which t
hey had been  '
shot" w
ith an
 
unloaded camera to get them u
sed to t
he new experience.
 
The actual f
ilm was t
aken i
n a p
layground area which had been r
eserved for
 
us for t
he morning so as to m
inimize the n
umber of spectators.  We used two
 
1
6mm cameras, one i
n f
ixed position and one hand-held; sound was r
ecorded
 
v
ia an overhead boom m
ike.  The children had had t
he l
ocation of the m
ike
 
pointed out to t
hem and for the entire morning they centered themselves
 
w
ithout d
irection under t
he m
ike w
ith a
lmost professional aplomb.  Actually,
 
t
hey r
eferred to the entire s
ession as "the taping" and appeared to i
gnore
 
t
he cameras, except that t
hey t
ended to t
urn t
heir backs o
n t
he hand held
 
camera when i
t came too c
lose.
 
A
ll action i
n the f
ilm was undirected, for  i
t t
urned out t
hat t
he children
 
needed no d
irection.  They had come to p
lay, and p
lay i
s what they d
id, whether
 
t
he cameras were l
oaded or not.  Further, they p
layed what they wanted to p
lay,
 
and i
t turned out t
hat what t
hey wanted to p
lay was their own tradition of
 
s
inging games.  The parallel bars, s
and-boxes and so on i
n the p
lay yard
 
r
eceived t
he s
cantiest of a
ttention for the whole morning; occasionally they
 
would settle onto the jungle gym for a f
ew moments, but a
lmost a
t once they
 
would wheel and r
e-group, pushing and shouting, for just one more r
ound of P
izza
 
P
izza Daddy-0, their current f
avorite.
 For this r
eason, and not because of
 
an especially sophisticated f
ield technique on the part of the f
ilm-makers,
 
the organization of t
he games s
hown i
s entirely the work of the children
 
t
hemselves.
 
-2-
Specific i
ncidents connected w
ith t
he i
ndividual g
ames w
ill be d
iscussed
 
l
ater, b
ut a f
ew general observations as to the i
mportant s
tylistic and
 
s
tructural e
lements of this tradition m
ight be of help:
 
F
irst, this seems to be primarily a f
emale tradition;  l
ittle g
irls begin
 
to l
earn i
t during their 6th or 7
th year.
 B
y the t
ime t
hey r
each puberty
 
t
he tradition i
s abandoned, or perhaps s
imply transmuted i
nto social dance.
 
Boys of t
he s
ame age-span seem i
nvariably to know the games but do not
 
perform them i
n public s
ituations such as the s
chool yard.
 I
n b
ackyards
 
or a
lleys, however, the g
ames may be p
layed by m
ixed groups.
 
The primary game form i
s the r
ing.  The c
lapping formation i
n which two
 
children f
ace each o
ther and c
lap h
ands i
s actually i
tself a small  r
ing to
 
which others c
an b
e added l
ike a s
tring of beads.  The o
ther principal p
lay
 
form consists of parallel  l
ines of p
layers f
acing each other.  A
ll action
 
t
akes p
lace i
nside the r
ing or between t
he parallel  l
ines; p
layers do not
 
go "outside".  Characteristically, t
here i
s a central f
igure who i
nitiates
 
the action, and t
he "plot l
ine" of each game then consists of a series of
 
moves which constitute one r
un-through of the p
lay; t
his i
s r
epeated until
 
the group i
s s
atisfied, or until everyone has had a t
urn at t
he center r
ole.
 
This s
tructure guarantees that t
here w
ill be no more or l
ess t
ime for any
 
child to have the central power position; competition, then,  i
n t
he sense
 
of w
inning-losing,  i
s absent.  Though i
ndividual p
layers may try to outdo
 
each other i
n i
mprovisational detail, there i
s no r
eward expressed i
n terms
 
of game action (
another turn a
t the central  r
ole, for example).
 
S
tylistically the major f
eature i
s call and r
esponse; a
lmost every phrase
 
i
s echoed both i
n s
inging and movement patterns.  Motor expressiveness i
s
 
e
laborated; musical expressiveness i
s not.  Though t
he children c
lap, their
 
c
lapping s
tyle seems to s
tress t
actile r
ather than tonal values.  Their hands
 
are quite r
elaxed; t
hey s
troke i
nstead of making an i
mpact.  This effect i
s
 
emphasized by t
he degree of body empathy the children s
hare; they move over,
 
make r
oom, spread out, c
lose together, move i
n t
andem and adjust to each
 
o
ther's physical presence i
n a t
housand s
ubtle ways.
 Physically speaking,
 
they enjoy group b
lend to a degree t
hat white society only seems to achieve
 
under t
he s
trictest i
mposed d
iscipline.
 
I
t was deeply d
isturbing to d
iscover that these same children are a
lso expert
 
s
treet f
ighters.  W
ithin t
heir own c
ircle or between their parallel  l
ines they
 
demonstrated social tolerance and mutual support to a degree i
nconceivable
 
to t
hose used to s
upervising white children's p
lay; apparently the h
igh social
 
empathy which so d
istinguishes their p
lay i
s somehow thwarted i
n l
ess formal
 
r
elationships, or perhaps by t
he s
tructure of "outside'' i
nstitutions.
 
I
t i
s i
mportant to bear i
n m
ind t
hat this tradition i
s a child-initiated and
 
child-directed activity; there i
s a m
inimum of adult i
ntervention,  i
f  i
ndeed
 
there i
s any at a
ll.  Most of t
hese childrens' teachers, for example, seemed
 
unaware of t
he fact that t
he children were p
laying these games, and those
 
who were aware of i
t had a t
endency to d
isapprove.  W
ithin this context, the
 
s
heer survival of these games becomes even more i
mpressive; some of them are
 
hundreds of years o
ld.  From the point of v
iew of demonstrating the antiquity
 
of this tradition,  i
t i
s particularly unfortunate that technical problems
 
prevented t
he i
nclusion i
n the f
ilm of one of the most w
ide-spread and
 
h
istorically i
nteresting of their games:  "Little Sally Walker".  "Punchinello"
 
and "Head and Shoulders B
aby" a
lso had to be omitted from t
he f
inal version;
 
except for these three g
ames, however, this f
ilm r
epresents the total  r
epertoire
 
of this particular group of g
irls.

Though considerations of space forbid any r
eal d
iscussion here of the
 
problem of cultural origins, this overall  tradition appears to present
 
i
n a
lmost schematic form one of the principal ways i
n which European
 
and African e
lements have combined upon American soil.
 I
n terms of l
exical
 
content, over half these games are i
ndisputably British, the o
ther half
 
being most probably i
ndigenous to the United States.
 Stylistically,
 
especially i
n terms of musical and k
inesic e
lements,  they seem equally
 
c
learly African, or at l
east Afro-American.
 F
inally, the total tradition
 
i
s at the  t
ime ot tn,s writing  (
1969)  the exclusive cultural  property of
 
b
lack American children.

 The structure i

trikingly s

I
t i
s worth pointing out especially that, a
lthough t
his song would be musi-
cally transcribed i
n a 1
4/4  or 2/4 meter,  the children are quite casually
 
c
lapping i
n a 3

hythm, a style of r
hythm p
lay which I have seen on other
 
b
lack p
laygrounds  i
n the Los Angeles area.
 This i
s considered technically
 
d
ifficult by trained musicians,  but apparently these children hoven't
 
l
earned that yet.
 
The child who thrusts herself i
nto the game i
s one of the unofficial  l
eaders
 
of the p
lay group, and this i
s perhaps why her aggressive behavior i
s so
 
r
eadily accepted by the other p
layers.
 However,  i
t i
s still notable that
 
the children possess a traditional technique through which an outsider can
 
so easily be absorbed i
nto the original group.
 Note, a
lso, how r
elaxed they
 
are about making room for s
till additional p
layers.

t i
s a
lso notable that the basic formation never travelled
 
during p

ide-step s
lightly back to their original position.
 
This was a
lways done spontaneously, w

 These children d
id not appear to know
 
i
t very well; on my f
irst v
isit to the school, only f
ive verses were sung.
 
By the t
ime of the f
ilming, they had added four more, and had apparently decided
 
to censor the actions ascribed to the "teen-age" who,  i
n previous r
enditions
 
had '
'drunk this'' and "drunk that'', with an i

Dear Mrs. Hawes:

Robert Georges f

I  and then Roger Welsch and Tai mi Ranta reported to me after
 
seeing the movie in Bloo mington.  Bob also t
old me o
f a f

I think he
 
said "

 on Georgia Negro children's play.
 
I
f either of these f
il ms can be rented, we would l
ike very much t
o
 
use the m as soon as possible, and will begin any routine necessary f
or or-
dering the m.
 
My work here i

s that of consultant
 
i
n children's t
raditional play l
ore and i
n co m munity folklife.  We have a
 
se minar in "childlore" for graduate s
tudents and post-doctoral researchers
 
who are beginning f
ield work among Lincoln children and ghetto children
 
in O maha, Chicago and two places in Appalachia.
 
Roger Welsch asked me to send you a copy o
f Rope-Skipping Ga mes,
 
Language, Beliefs and Custo ms, a project undertaken by Tr - University
 
Participants last year.  The collecting (most of i
t) was done by l
ong-distance
 
through classroo m t
eachers '
back ho me,"  By the end of the Tr - U. year,
 
the participants realized that the way t
o do i
t properly was to work on
 
the playground with the children.  Consequently, they requested t
hat we
 
continue the s
tudy this year.
 
At the present t
i me, I
 have heard f
ro m t
hree of t
he group w ho are
 
observing directly what they see and hear on the playgrounds.
 
The real value of Rope-Skipping Ga mes i

30me years ago on a weekday a

in  by a

an
: I
a cies elementary school when the final bell of the day rar ,
 
and the children began to pour out of the play-yard.  Two li tio
 
ps eight or nine, walked past me deep in conversation.
 
"Let's play Step on a crack. break your mother's back.
 
let's play Monkey faces; that's lots better.
 2cc, thc
 
ut Monkey faces is you c a n  step on all the cracks.  You
 
an stomp on the cracks, or you can just wipe your feet all over the
 
racks; the only thing is, you can't step on a sçuare that's got a
 
onkey face in it..."
 
Apparently, a "r

across a nearby square that contained such a marking; and I watched

now and again taking big running leaps across the ta ued sections
 
of pavonent.

--lay can be "locked out" by allowing no more players into the game;
 
a "tea party" can be held, in which only two players may participate;
 
or the call can go up for "pink elephants", in which some players
 
line up against the board and try to avoid being hit by the others.
 
_ono of the above variations appear in the rule book, and very few
 
teachers aprear even to be aware that the children are playing by
 
their own rules.
 
Thus, in  the life-style of the American playground, there
 
appears to be a kind of fundamental need for a bifurcated game struc-
ture, one axis consisting of the unchangable rules and the other those
 
aspects of the game which are subject to variation.  This,  1ie
 sug-
gests -
-
 to return beiefly to our  original problem -
-
 that the ga ss
 
step on a crack, break your mother's back and Monkey faces are indeed
 
two aspects of the same thing.  After all, Step on a crack has an
 
extremely simple structure; it has only one rule, so to speak, so that
 
a built-in variation factor is impossible; hence, the necessity of
 
invor::ing a reversal, or parody.  The existence of the "two" ga.:cs
 
the n  allows the players the same leeway for attaining temporary
 
ogreement that the variation factor permits in other traditional g
s.
 
For it is critical to remember that the agreement is only
 
temporary; it must be affirmed and re-affirmed each time play begins,
 
via a pre-play discussion period which may be both prolonged and voci-
erous.
 Indeed, even after play is under way, its course may be a7-
ered by the shout of one player:
 "I tap.." or "Dibs on...".
 
interjection of these magical form u
lae requires immediate roniju
 
n ,
he par  o  a
.L
 iu
 r
;
 c
n ai
 
hatters
  into passionate splinter units, the better to debate  he
 
i
ssue.  Not infrequently it can be observed that a group will use
 
entire time available for play in a bitter -
-
 but apparently
 
'
reshing -
-
 discussion over the "rules".  No one seems to mind,
 
really, that the g
a m e  never gets played.  No wonder the decibel
 
rate of our school yards is so high; floating over our playgrounds
 
:re the shrill intense voices of a thousand decision-makers at
 
.
.
.
3i-k, testing, probing, re-arranging, counter-posing -
-
 all very
 
o:: o a u s t i n
 and unnecessary to a tidter minded adult worla.
 
For variation is frequently productive of uproar; t
h e r e
 
o3Iu ely no doubt about that.  However, it can also promote
 
'
lexibility and the knack of achieving compromise.
 Our children
 
appear to have taken their cultural stance; they will cheerfully
 
risk chaos any day in order to preserve a satisfactory degeee of
 
roup or individual autonomy.  And theirs is a more soohio ioated
 
position than first may appear; for by the time children have
 
reached the game-playing age they have, by definition, learned that
 
-:
here are some i mutables, some rules that cannot be challenged,
 
or there is no game at all.  It is the area in which change is
 
possible that interests them most -
-
 and quite properly s o .
 
Par it is, after all, possible that the children are rijht,
 
anai in terms of the democratic life style it is far more important
 
'
or them to practice reaching and working within a temporary con-
ensus than to learn obedience to an unchanging set of requirements.
 
'
2hey have already learned this; and so, from the perspective of the

 it is plain that there are deep cultural

Dear Bess:
 
I
' m enclosing a copy of your chapter.
 Let
 
me know what changes you would like and I'm sure they
 
can be made at this point in the process.
 By all
 
means submit the chapter to the journal if you like.
 
I know what you mean when you describe
 
yourself as an exhausted rubber band as a result of
 
"Futue Shock."  They used to call it 'nxlety neuroses"
 
and under that label is was abnormal.
 Maybe the new
 
label is better because people can be more open and
 
accepting of self in their disrupted feelings.
 My
 
husband never had that sense of accepting feelings.
 
He was, is afraid of becoming psychotic if he does.
 
It's a sad thing to see him destroying everything he
 
worked for, not just our marriage.
 
Let me have the new mss. as soon as you can.

Dear Loyda:
 
The follouin  is my autobiographical paragraph.
 Please feel free to
 
:
eturn for correction.
 
ess Lomax Hawes has recently co-authored, with Bessie
 
1,ones of St Simon's Island, Georgia, a study of tradi iosa1
 
lack childrens' games, titled Step It Down (Harper & Rowe,
 
1972).  She has also produced several educational films,
 
i
cluding Pizza Pizza Daddy-O, a documentary study of traIl-
lonal singing games as played on a Black school-yard ia
 
OS Angeles.  Mrs. Hawes obtained her A.B. in Socioio '
 
rom Bryn Mawr College and her M.A. in Folklore from th
 
aiversity of California at Berkeley; she is currently
 
a Associate Professor at the California State Universi
 
at Northridge, where she teaches courses in folklore and
 
folk and ethnological music.
 
I hope this is all right.
 I hate these exercises in se1I-aJvei
s :cat.
 
This is absolutely my final revise.
 I am returning the original as well;
 
if you disapprove of any of my changes, go ahead and return them to the
 
original form, but I expect you are too exhausted to care.  I
'm sorry
 
to have given you so much trouble; your book seems to have been as il
l-
starred as mine -
-
 which was five years at the publishers!
 
With all best wishes, truly,
 
Yours,
