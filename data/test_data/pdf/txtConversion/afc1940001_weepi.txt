Ben RiceThe Weeping WillowLast night I dreamed of my true loveMy arms were folded around
herBut when I woke, she was not thereAnd I [?] lay without her.Her long yellow hair like chains
of goldCome a-dangling o'er my pillowIt was that girl, a pretty little girlThat they call the weeping
willow.Next morning I went to her uncle's houseAnd there inquired for herThey answered me that
she was thereBut they had a room for her.She heard my voice and answered meShe answered
from a windowSo [vain?], so vain [?] will I be with theeIf the looks and bolts ? I stood a moment in
great surpriseI knew my cautious temperMy passion flew, my sword [eve?]? tooI swore that room I'd
enter.The doors all into flinders flewThe locks and bolts did shatterIt was the girl that I love so wellSo
easily ? I came at her.Her uncle and some other manHave ? [me?] in follow ? They swore therefore
they would part with herIn my heart's blood would wallow.The blood was shed from every sideI got
my darling from among themCome on, brave boys, who want such bridesLet us fight and overcome
them.
