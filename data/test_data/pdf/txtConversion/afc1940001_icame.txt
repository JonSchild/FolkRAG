December 1938 York
I came from Salem City,With my wash bowl on my knee,I'm going to CaliforniaThe gold dust for
to see.It seemed all night the day I left,The weather it was dry,The sun so hot I froze to death,Oh!
brothers, don't you cry.Chorus:Oh! California,That's the land for me,I'm going to SacramentoWith my
wash bowl on my knee.I soon shall be in Francisco,And then I'll look around,And when I see the gold
lumps there,I'll pick them off the ground.I'll scrape the mountains clean[,?]I'll drain the rivers dry[,?]A
pocket full of rocks bring home,So, brothers, don't you cry.
