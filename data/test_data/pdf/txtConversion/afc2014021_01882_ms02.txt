INTERVIEW LOG
00:00:13:  Lives in Medford, Oregon.  Born 1957 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Has lived in 
Oregon since 2007 and has been a caregiver since she moved to Oregon.
00:01:23:  Companion’s grandmother was first person she cared for.  Didn’t know that Oregon 
had program that would allow her to be paid as caregiver.  Companion had stroke on same day 
grandmother died.  Since then, she has cared for her.  Had not planned to be caregiver, life 
brought her there.
00:03:15:  Other jobs:  retail, construction, cab driver, pest control.  Attended college but did not 
complete her degree.
00:04:00:  No time off or end of day as caregiver.  Always on.  “It’s my job to take care of my 
best friend.”  Extremely rewarding.
00:05:13:  In my nature to do this work.  Oldest of five children.  Taking care of people 
fundamentally who I am and who I was born to be.
00:07:25:  Must give up your ego.  Doesn’t help to be combative.  Can’t be in control all of the 
time. Anticipate consumer’s needs.  Recognize they are the boss.
00:09:06:  Boundaries with clients can be nebulous.  Must negotiate on daily basis.  Must be 
special kind of person to be caregiver.  Must be nurturing person.  Able to cook and clean well, 
track blood sugar, take blood pressure, understand medical history.  Learn as you go.  Must be 
absorbent and kind.
00:11:30:  Give each other tips as caregivers.  Learning curve with elderly consumer.  Incredibly 
good classes from home care commission.  Learn tricks to distract someone’s attention from 
other caregivers.  Have client hold something and occupy their hands while changing them.  Do 
things with as few movements as possible.  Keep supplies nearby.  Anticipate and think ahead.

00:15:14:  Typical day:  get up around 9:30 or 10:00 am.  Breathing treatment, check blood 
sugar, pills, breakfast, get dressed.  Sometimes doctor's appointments, then dinner, laundry, 
shower.  Whatever she needs for the day.  Needs help toileting, night time meds.
00:17:35:  When traveling, brings another person to help.  Lots of work but it works out.  Not 
much down time.  Does union work during respites.
00:18:39:  Not many opportunities to hang out with other caregivers.  Big-hearted people.  Fight 
for consumers and fellow workers.  Union brings them together.
00:21:10:  Interfacing with Division of Human Services, brokerage agencies over hours.  
Changes for those who work with developmentally disabled.
00:23:58:  Stress on job.  Can’t just go do something when you want to.  Defining boundaries 
with consumers is stressful.
00:28:18:  Clients can fire caregivers for no reason.  No just cause in this relationship.  
00:30:17:  Humor makes situations bearable.
00:32:49:  Most gratifying:  nothing more noble than making it possible for people to have the 
lives they want to have and stay in their own homes.  Most challenging:  working with system, 
having only 2-3 hours sleep at a time.  Compensation does not fully cover all the work she does.
00:35:26:  Hours taken away after consumer. Did not fall for three months, a result of good job 
she was doing.  Then subsequent falls occurred.  Limiting hours devalues her.  Annual 
assessment of appropriate care level.  Feels like piecework but not adequately rewarded.  
Re-evaluation on how hours are allocated.  State has equal interest on other side of bargaining 
table.
00:39:58:  Pause for equipment check.
00:40:28:  Talks about union.  Before union:  no minimum wage, independent contractor status, 
no workers’ compensation, no insurance.  With union:  $13/hour, now bona fide workers in every
sense of the word.
00:42:42:  Pause.
00:43:05:  Union makes caregiving a job worth having.  Prestige with pay and benefits.  Get 
health insurance through co-op and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  ACA helps take insurance off 
the bargaining table as an issue.

00:45:55:  Career pathways for home care workers.  On cutting edge in Oregon.  Home care 
workers have closest access to consumer.  Providing gloves important.
00:47:55:  Asked to speak to legislators in Connecticut.  Told that her testimony impacted a key 
legislator.  No new nursing homes in Oregon in 20 years.  Saves lots of money for state.  No 
more basic freedom than choosing where you live.
00:52:57:  Profession of health care is honorable, dignified.  Some people don’t recognize that.
00:54:30:  Caregiving a lot like being a parent.  Parents don’t take sick days.  Hard for caregivers
to take sick days.  Must push through it.  Consumers still have needs.
00:57:03:  Off work:  likes television, movies.  Union is her “hobby.” Goes to coast, likes to read.
00:58:44:  Importance of caregiving to individual, society, and the state.  Amazing program I 
intend to keep fighting for.
00:59:38:  end of interview.
