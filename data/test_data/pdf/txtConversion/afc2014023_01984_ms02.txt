Styrofoam form of a deer with antlers in place 
ready to be mounted. The introduction of forms 
(mannequins) available in endless 
conﬁgurations has transformed the industry, 
substantially reducing the labor hours required 
to complete a mount.

Specimens are meticulously cleaned 
prior to mounting to ensure longevity.

Ducks are Amato’s most difﬁcult challenge. 
Ducks must be groomed. Amato spends 
anywhere from one to two hours with a pair of 
tweezers and a needle putting every feather 
back in place.
