1'SE GWINE Bli..OK TO DIXIE. 
Sung by HARRY W OODSON with great success at the How-
ard AthenFeum, Boston. 
I'se gwme back to Dixie, 
No more I'se gwine to wander, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And I 
can't stay here no longer. 
I 
miss the old plantation, 
My home and my relations, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
CHedus. 
I'se gwine back to Dixie; I'm gwine to Dixie; 
I'm going where the orange blossoms grows 
I 
hear the children calling, the leaves on the trees a 
falling, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, and the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se travelling back to Dixie, 
My step is slow and feeble, 
I 
pray the Lord shall help me, 
And lead me from all evil. 
And if my strength forsakes me, 
My kind friends, come and take me; 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se gwine back, & c.

PROVE YOURSELF THE POOR MAN'S 
FRIEND, INDEED. 
Written and composed by H ARRY KEAnsEY, and respectfully 
dedicated to HARRY W OODSON. 
There are many ups and downs in this rugged road of life, 
And sad sufferings some folks undergo, 
Through trouble, toil and sorrow, with bitter care and strife; 
Those who've wealth, such sufferings do not know. 
When you see a 
poor man starving, oh, help him if you can! 
And try and be a 
friend to those in need. 
Who can tell but you some day may need a 
helping hand, 
Then prove yourself the poor man's friend, indeed. 
Cnonus. 
But this maxim is the best, help the poor man in distress. 
No matter what his station or his creed, 
For its always best you'll find to the poor man to be kind. 
So prove yourself the poor man's friend in deed. 
Capitalists, now say. that one dollar for each day, 
Is enough to buy a 
laboring man his bread; 
But on that they cannot live, wages higher they must give, 
For hunger's bitter pangs we all do dread. 
Now our preachers say the same, and for them it is a 
shame, 
In the pulpit, they say help those who need, 
With their thousands every year, if they'd give a 
little free'r 
They'd prove themselves the poor man's friend, indeed. 
There are many men now gone who helped those forlorn, 
And the poor man prays for them both night and day, 
And there's many now that's worse, that gets the poor 
man's curse. 
While their prayers are for better, now I 
say, 
Jim Fisk so good and true, on the poor man did bestow, 
A 
loaf of bread to those who most did need; 
And though Tweed now lies in jail, we tell of him the same 
tale, 
They proved themselves the poor mat's friend, indeed.

Our marriage bells are ringing, 
What a 
glorious peal to me, 
The present hour is bringing 
Sweet joy and ecstacy • 
For she whom I 
have loved so long, 
Loved dearly as my life, 
Will give me ere the hour has gone, 
The right to call her wife. 
Our marriage bells are ringing, 
What a 
glorious peal to me, 
The present hour is brimming o'er 
With joy and ecstacy. 
CHORUS. 
Come, my darling, come and haste to me, 
Do not tarry, love, I 
wait for thee. 
Dost thou hear the wedding bells? 
Joyous peals they ring for thee; 
What welcome sounds their music tells, 
I 
fondly wait for thee. 
What care I 
for the world's frowns, 
With the loved one by my side ? 
For, through its ups and downs, 
We'll breast life's stormy tide; 
And though the current bears us on 
From all that's bright in life, 
My love will ever be as strong 
As when I 
called her wife. 
Our marriage bells are ringing, 
What a 
glorious peal to me, 
The present hour is brimming o'er 
With joy and ecstasy.

EVANGELINE, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by THOMAS DALY, and sung by the DALY BROTHERS 
with immense success. 
In the Summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the merry notes from their yellow throats, 
Make the valley and the woodland ring, 
Down by a 
little running stream; 
In a 
neat white cot down in a 
shady dell, 
There lives a 
fairy queen, 
She is the fairest maid there is beneath the sun, 
Is my Evangeline. 
CHORUS. 
In the Summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the merry notes from their yellow throats, 
Make 'the valley and the woodland ring, 
I'll wed my sweet Evangeline. 
Now of all the sweetest creatures in the land, 
She's the sweetest one, yes, the dearest one, 
And I'll happy be whene'er I 
gain the hand 
Of my pretty, sweet Evangeline; 
For she is such a 
belle, and always looks so well, 
And mine she'll surely be, 
I'm as happy as a 
king, or a 
bird upon the wing, 
And I 
sing and dance with glee. 
In the Summer, etc.

THE DAYS WHEN I 
WAS YOUNG. 
Composed and sung by HARRY W OODSON. 
• 
There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Though I 
know, I 
never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell, 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones, am forever !aid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often have a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come I 
would husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free I 
had never cause to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung. 
And my heart does often long for the happy days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swelL 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empti,.s your pocket- book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his hoe ey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
I3ut what is he going for to do. 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
I 
tell you its IDD fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law. 
Written and sung by HARRY WoODSON. 
Here's poor ole Uncle Steben, 
Come to see you all dis ebenin', 
I'se jess dropped in to ax you if you know— 
Dat dis great and mighty nation, 
Once de best in all creation, 
Am a-goin' to de debbil just as fast as it can go. 
CHORUS. 
A-goin' to de debbil, goin' to de debbil, 
Goin'.to de debbil ebery day, 
For de flag ob fraud am floatin', 
And dar's no mo' use ob votin', 
For dem 'turning Boards will count you out, 
If you doesn't vote dar way. 
Oh 1 
de people owes dm. grudges, 
'Gainst dem high cockalorum judges— 
Massas Miller, Strong and Bradley, sartin, sure, 
For dey played de politician. 
On dat 'lectionum Commission, 
And showed by dar decision dey was rotten to de core. 
CHORUS. 
And eberybody knows it, eberybody knows it, 
Eberybody knows it, high and low, 
Oh I 
de trufe hab been obstructed, 
And de country am corrupted, 
And am goin' to de debbil, 
Just as fast as it can go. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY W OODSON 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the South, among the cotton fields, 
Is the place I 
ever long to see, 
Oh 1 
the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
• 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
• 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh 1 
the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh 1 
I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, etc.

Isn't a 
Dollar enough to buy Bread, and 
Water costs Nothing at all. 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS, written for HARRY 
W OODSON. 
In the city of Brooklyn is living 
A 
man, who himself once was poor, 
But that fact it would seem he's forgotten, 
Or he'd act very different, I'm sure; 
Row I 
heard, on a 
late Sunday morning, 
These words from his saintly lips fall— 
" 
Isn't a 
dollar enough to buy bread? 
And water costs nothing at all." 
CHORUS. 
Then no man will I 
count in the list of my friends, 
Who is deaf tc the workingman's call: 
And says—" A 
dollar is enough to buy bread, 
And water costs nothing at all." 
This wonderful preacher don't do much, 
Tho' he lives on the fat of the land, 
He has all that he wants—maybe too much, 
For he lives in a 
style that is grand; 
Yet this clerical and cheeky old fraud said— 
(Though two thousand a 
month is his pay,) 
That a 
workman should be very happy, 
On only a 
dollar a 
day. 
Then no man, etc. 
This man is not known for his goorl deeds, 
Though for " gab " the world OVA?' lies famed, 
He preaches to please his rich patmns, 
And thereby has gamed a 
great Jaime; 
But I'd much rather be a 
poor workinan, 
When before judgment's seat we all stand, 
Than to be in the shoes of Ward Beecher, 
Who went back on the poor laboringman. 
Then no man, etc. 
A 
MESSAGE FROM THE POOR. 
Written by HARRY W OODSON. 
(Air—" Letter in the Candle.") 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as st eel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CIIORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step- stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Ever grinding down their wages, 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat. 
Then give, etc.

Written by JERRY KENNEY, and sung by HARRY W OODSON, at 
Harrigan & Hart's Theatre, N. Y. 
Oh, listen to the words 
Of a 
poor old colored man, 
Whose heart am filled with misery and woe; 
And a 
story I 
will tell, 
That you all do know full well, 
Of them cruel, cruel days of long ago. 
In dear old Tennessee, 
I 
livcd so happily, 
The thoughts do make my old heart feel sore; 
When I 
think of days gone by, 
The tears come to my eyes, 
Them tyrannizing days before the war. 
Citonus. 
Them cruel days am gone, 
Let us pray both night and morn, 
That they again may never come no more; 
In my memory it am new, 
The sufferings we went through, 
In them tyrannizing days before the war. 
I 
remember wel!, I 
know, 
It am very long ago, 
When I 
used to sit around my cabin home; 
With my children around my knee, 
They would play so merrily, 
Until that woeful bitter day did come. 
The white man came one day, 
Took my little ones away, 
Oh! can it be I'll never see them any more? 
It's taken then were we, 
And sold into slavery, 
In those tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc.. 
My cOmpanions are no more, 
They have gone unto that shore, 
And 
their journey through this life now am done; 
They will find that all am love, 
In that happy land above, 
In that bright and blessed peaceful happy home. 
But always we will pray— 
Yes, every night and day, 
That them cruel times may come no more; 
For our sufferings they were great, 
Bow terrible our fate, 
In those tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc, 
Composed by HARRY W OODSON, and sung by the GIRARD BROS. 
Good evening to you. one and all, good evening, 
We're glad to see your smiling faces here, 
We've just arrived from Alabama this morning, 
To sing and dance, and make ourselves feel quer; 
We also come to tell you of a 
pleasure, 
Which both of us two niggers think is grand, 
And that is on a 
starry moonlight evening, 
The fun you have while tumbling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
pleasure that we colored folks delight in, 
A 
better one you never can demand; 
It makes you lively as the lightning, 
The fun you have while tumbling on the sands. 
We now thank you for your kind attention, 
And ask you all to come some day, 
We'll try our best to gain your approbation, 
In the acrobatic biz we do display; 
Before we go, we want you to remember 
There's nothing half so nice in all the land, 
For a 
jolly time to exercise your muscles, 
As the fun you have while tumbling on the sand. 
It's a 
pleasure, etc. 
NEAT IRISH SONG AND DANCE. 
(A Parody on " Pretty Peggy.") 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY 
Performed by Miss EMMA DEZODA. 
I 
love an Irish boy now, Paddy that's his name, 
Laughing Paddy, jolly Paddy, be loves me the same; 
'Twas a 
fine Summer's night, 
And the morn was shining bright, 
I 
met Paddy, my darling, my true one. 
He told me that he'd be true, 
And I 
said I 
loved him too, 
Then we commenced to sparking, 
Down by the brook at the end of the lane, 
Of the future and our love we both were talking. 
(Dance.) 
About a 
year has passed, and the time is coming fast, 
When myself and Paddy shall be one at last 
Then we'll settle down, in a 
cot not far from 
We'll be happy and jolly, 
And in quarreling we'll not be found. 
I 
will ne'cr forget the day, 
That I 
heard him say— 
Oh I 
Peggy, I 
love you. 
As he is an Irishman to keep his low I'll try, 
He'll keep his vows to Peggy, I'll be bound.

IIARD UP. 
Written and sung by HARRY W OODSON. 
Oh! where is all my money gone to ? 
Oh! where is my friends I 
used to treat? 
Now I 
can't get a 
drink when I 
want it, 
For they call me an old played-out dead beat. 
Once I 
had money and friends too—yes, plenty, 
But now they all since have flown, 
For my stomach and pockets they are empty, 
And I've got ne'er a 
red to call my own. 
CHORUS. 
Nary red, nary red, 
Nary a 
single red cent to call my own. 
Nary red, nary red, 
Nary a 
single red cent to call my own. 
I 
em bloated, forlorn and dejected, 
My clothes are all ragged and coarse, 
I 
am homeless, despised and neglected, 
And covered with shame and remorse; 
Oh where are the treasures that have vanished ? 
That were mine when the girls I 
used to court, 
Where has my suit of broadcloth gone to ? 
And my handsome watch and chain I 
used to sport. 
CHORUS. 
Up the spout, up the spout, 
You will know the place by three golden balls; 
Up the spout, up the spout, 
The rum- sellers got my money all.

fell in love with that charming girl, 
Of only sweet sixteen. 
(Dance.) 
I 
took her out to see the sights, 
And cut a 
swell and dash; 
She said she was her daddy's heir, 
And sure to get his cash. 
But things they took a 
chequered course, 
Just when I 
thought she'd wed; 
She fell in love with a 
Chinaman, 
And married him instead. 
Oh, my ! etc.

11IGNONNETTE , 
SONG- A.I.CD DANCE. 
Written by DICK ANDERSON, of ANDERSON & MURRAY. 
There's a 
charming little creature in this city, 
Whom some day I 
fondly hope to make my wife; 
She is young, she is handsome, she is pretty, 
And she is the joy and comfort of my life. 
You might travel the country up and down, 
Such a 
beauty I 
am sure you'd never get; 
For there is no other maiden in the town, 
To compare with my bright-eyed Mignonnette. 
CHORUS. 
She is sweeter than the flower I 
named her after, 
And the music of her voice I 
can't forget; 
There's the sweetest music in the merry laughter 
Of my pretty little bright-eyed Mignormette. 
Oh, you ought to see this dainty little creature, 
Whose style and grace is fitted for a 
queen; 
Supremely handsome is her every feature, 
She a " stunner," and she's only seventeen. 
I 
wish I 
could describe to you my darling, 
As she appeared to me when first we met; 
Her face was like a 
tiny flower garden, 
And that is why I 
called her Mignonnette. 
he is sweeter, etc.

While I 
relate to you, 
What happened to this swell, 
A few short days ago; 
'T . as out at the City Park, 
Viewing the sights and scenes, 
I 
met the fairest of the fair—

The belle of New Orleans. 
CHORUS. 
She's the prettiest one in all this world, 
An angel to me she seems; 
I'm over head and ears in love 
With the belle of New Orleans. 
(Dunce.) 
She invited me to see her home, 
It made me feel so queer, 
Whilst walking arm in arm, 
With this pretty little dear; 
I 
confessed my love to her, 
And strange to me it seems, 
That I 
have won for life, 
Tbe belle of New Orleans. 
She's the prettiest, etc.

THE OLD AMC'S A

Camp meeting song, original, by Mr. FRANK BENNETT. 
Away down South, Where I 
was born, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a

Among the sugar cane and corn, 
The old ark's a

Then old massa promised me, 
The old ark's a

That when he died he'd set me free, 
Oh, the old ark's a

When I

The old ark's a

Way up yonder in the sky, 
The old ark's a

And sister Sal and my aunt Sue, 
The old ark's a

said they'd surely be there, too, 
The old ark's a

BARNUM'S GREAT TAM.

AIR.— ' 
Ting, Ti ,g.'' 
I 
never shall forget the first time I 
went 
To see Barnum's Great World's Fair, 
The menagerie was crowded, the circus was full, 
And so was most any one there. 
The women with whiskers had just got showed, 
And caught the barber's itch, 
And a 
cage full of monkeys were having some fun 
With a 
deck of cards playing auction pitch. 
• CHORUS. 
Oh, wasn't it funny to see such a 
sight; 
We all went home delighted that night. 
You may think I'm fooling, but you ought to have been there, 
To see all the sights at Barnum's Great Fair. 
Now the next sight I 
saw was a 
lion in the cage 
It was funny it had but four legs; 
I 
asked what they fed him to make him so fat, 
They said it was scrambled shoe pegs. 
The giraffe was next with a 
great long neck, 
And the elephant was playing with his sister ; 
He kissed her so hard upon her front tooth, 
That he raised a 
great big war 
blister. 
Oh, wasn't it funsy, &c.

ALABAMA JOE. 
Performed by BILLY CHASE, of McKee & Rogers/ CombbiatIOL
. 
OH, I 
once did love a 
yellow gal, 
And I 
thought that she loved me; 
She had coal-black eyes, her name was 'Lize, 
And none could sing like she. 
I 
courted her for seven years, 
But found it was no go, 
For she ran off with another fig, 
Called Alabama Joe. 
CHORUS. 
But in spite of that I 
often think abOut her, 
My heart is sad since she has gone away; 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I 
don't believe, 
I'm a 
happy fig and bound for to be gay. 
One night I 
took her to a 
ball, 
And danced with all night, 
I 
paid her all attention, 
And done everything that's right, 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite, &e. 
The last I 
heard of Lize, 
And her tar heel colored moke, 
She was doing washing, 
Her darling Joe was broke. 
So he has gone to blacking boots, 
To try to get along, 
She often wished she'd married me. 
For now she knows she's wrong. 
But in spite. Stc..

INFLATION. 
My beloved brothers and stSters and constituents, allow me . 
to call your particular attention to the great fact thst is now 
agitation de public mind; if so, why not? can any man say 
otherwise, eh? 
This subject dat I 
am about to expound, my 
demoralized fellow-citizens and students, is that of inflation. 
If 
you get a 
Webster's unabridged spelling-book, and turn over 
the leaves, you will find something printed on them, and that 
something is the word inflation—blown up. 
Can any man say 
otherwise? well, if 
so, why not, eh? 
'Tis a subject that touches 
every one that stands under-
neath the folds of that glorious, ever-waving, star-spangled 
smasher, and reaches from the finest ladies in the land, inflated 
with her own beauty and the blood of youth, to the third-class 
politician, whose majestic soul soars lnto the realms of hash and 
fish-balls, snd thereby he is inflated by them. 
Now instead of calling a 
man a common drunkard, we oall 
him a 
universal inflationist. 
But where are we now ? for, if so, 
why not? 
Can any man say otherwise? 
Therefore, let us 
have plenty of it, and more too. 
I 
think as I 
stand here I 
can 
produce an argument that will convince you that a 
five dollar 
greenback is even better than a 
five dollar gold piece. 
Now, for 
instance, if a 
man has a 
five dollar gold piece, and it belongs to 
him, what does he do with it ? 
Why he puts it in his pocket, 
and if he takes it out a 
year hence, what does he find it? Why 
a 
five dollar gold piece still. 
Now if a man has, on the other 
hand a 
five dollar greenback, and he goes to put it in his pock -
et, he doubles it, so to illustrate—don't he ? and if he takes it 
out in five minutes after, he finds it in-creases! 
Can any man 
say otherwise? 
Well, if so, why not ? 
But, for gracious sake, 
don't tell my mother-in-law that I 
said it, or there would be war 
in my domicile.

And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
ASome chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim :

Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma,

dilemma; 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's What I

I 
asked them what they meant, 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
" 
Oh Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police!" 
And when he came he looked at me so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh I

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N. E 
Herald, called the "Complaint Book," written by Ton-
PASTOR, and sung by PRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pittsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald "Complaint 
Book." 
6POKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
found an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book ?" 
SroKEN.—In regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " complaint 
Book ?"

HER FRONT NAME IS HANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stole. 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
TIer feet are a 
feature— she wears seventeens. 
Her front name is ITanner, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Min she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She sings " Star-Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana," 
With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the 'Ammer. 
She wears a 
Moire Antique pull- back, cost six cents a 
yard, 
Tier: hat and parasol are made out of lard ; 
She shall be a 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealth (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc. 
Tier mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near; 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and

LEANING ON A 
BALCONY, 
Ceramic Song by Thum( DIIMONT. 
Sung by Wm. COURTHIONT. 
OLD Uncle Pete got full, last night, 
Looking out the w 
ndow, saw a 
sight; 
This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see :— 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes ; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray mag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along. 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in the pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice. 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flit s. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull-frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his face. 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally in de garden, lifting peas, 
Come awl kiss me. if you please.

'Tis pleasant on a 
summer ni 
I 
think you won't deny, 
When stars, like wicked laughing eyes, 
Are winking in the sky : 
With some one by your side NVIIOSO eyes 
Are bright as any star, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
Enjoying your cigar. 
CHORUS. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
Talking to a 
pretty girl, 
Heedless of her pa ; 
Though some may like to strut about, 
I 
like it better far, 
Leaning on a 
balcony 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
You'ri, glad to leave the crowded room 
And if the night be fair, • 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
To get a 
breath of air; 
And if you've some one by yom side, 
She won't take it amiss, 
If, in a 
quiet sort of way, 
You steal a 
little kiss. 
Leaning on a 
ba:ccmy, etc. 
When curtains screen you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop the question quietly, 
What better place can be 
The coldest- hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
Have ne2ver proved unkind.

I'm going to tell you what I 
know 
Of a 
nice society, 
The ladies, almost every one, 
Declare they are N. G. 
But you're expected at your post 
At every dress parade, 
To stand outside the theatre door 
With the Matinee Brigade. 
HORUS. 
There on the mash, stuffed with hash. 
Cheeks as hard as rocks! 
There on the street from morn ' till nig-ht, 
And never change their socks. 
All in a 
line, rain or shine, 
These rosebuds all parade! 
They stand for ladies to admire 
In the Matinee Brigade! 
Jawdge, and Chawles and Jerome are there, 
Got up with wondrous skill ; 
And when they wink their naughty eye 
It never fails to kill. 
With ten cent canes and dizzy suits 
By a 
sheeny tailor made, 
The choicest plums in all the land 
Are the Matinee Brigade. 
There on the mash, ktc. 
They always strike an attitude 
To give themselves a 
tone, 
They live on love and Dntch free lunch, 
And smell of bad cologne! 
I'll bet two cents if the truth was known 
Their wash- bills wasn't paid ; 
But nobody knows how hard they mash 
In the Matinee Brigade! 
There on the mash, ,t.c.

My mind is never easy, 
No matter wLether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I

You must not think me rude, 
And if I

Oh, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance, 
She'd ask me It she could, 
And then I'd say in a

And I

And weighs 150 pounds.

My father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take his arm, 
And to the church we all shall glide. 
And then when we are both united, 
We'll own a 
house and coach and four, 
And won't it be gay to see every day, 
Our little Lappells playing on the floor. 
Conic all you nigs, 
Oh, Sue, I'm glad you got consent 
And what a 
happy pair we'll make, 
What funny names to be called out of church, 
George Lappell and Susan Flake. 
Then you'll be my wife forever, 
And lots of things for you I'll buy; 
I'll never go back on George Lappell, 
Until the very day I

I'm going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass ; 
You may search the eountry all around, 
You'll not find one one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
We're happier than king or queen can be; 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
eirious way, 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear me, let me be, 
Get away, do, oh! don't tickle me; 
Now then, Ted, stop your chaff, 
He, he, he, he, oh! you make me laugh 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met; 
She was milking on a 
three legged stool, 
I 
called her duck, she called me fool. 
11!
59 
She gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red, 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she screamed and said: 
Oh ! dear etc. 
I 
said " I'll have one kiss," and then 
My arm went round her waist again; 
She shouted " Oh ! I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my car. 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die; 
She said, " Well then, Ted, if you'll let me be, 
Just take one, ducky darling, but don't tickle me." 
Oh ! dear me, etc. 
(Encore 
l'erse.) 
I'm married now and settled down, 
With my dear darling, Susan Brown ; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the babies on our knee. 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night,

MUTTON PIE. 
(Air—" Sweet Bye and Bye.") 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
Did you ever go into a 
saloon, 
Where they give you a 
free lunch with a 
beer, 
And when the proprieter's back is turned, 
All them bums to the counter they do steer. 
CHORUS. 
Mutton pie, they all cry, 
And they chew as they never chewed before; 
Beefsteak pie, what do you soyie, 
We'll have meat on that beautiful shore. 
You can see them every hour of the day, 
Around on the corners they do stand, 
A-waiting for some one to treat, 
0 
they will bust up any soup-house in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oyster pie, they all cry, 
For a 
plate of hash all night they loudly roar; 
And when they die, bye and bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
Around our large hotels they can be found, 
They all have a 
lunch route of their own, 
They're the terror of the bake shops near and far, 
-And at night to some hay-loft they do roam. 
Mutton pie, etc,

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr)nged and printed in series—H , 
arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spa des—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many o 
t 
the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tLe directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Inclosed in handsome case

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want f. equently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dill!. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

"en ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called HIIMPTY DIImPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opporen. 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary Sp. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is SG, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A 
little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Bull..
