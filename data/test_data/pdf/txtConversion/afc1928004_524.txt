She couldn't dance at all, 
Wasn't she a 
fine gal, 
With a 
waterfall. 
CHORUS— 
Then oh, oh, I 
must find her, 
I 
must find her; 
Oh, oh, I

Yonder, yonder is her father's house, 
And that's where she lives.

MURPHY, ANCHOR YER FEET. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy & Mack. 
An Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
Since I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, " Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS— 
For the other day I 
heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang, 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
For there was none out that night. 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, - I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus. 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet, 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along, 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus. 
Good Enough For Me. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
Aa sung by MCINTYRE & M UTH. 
As I 
strolled out the other day, 
A 
pretty girl I 
spied, 
She looked at me, I 
winkea at her, 
To speak to her I 
tried. 
Across upon the other side, 
'T was plain enough to see, 
I 
will go and ask my mother if she's 
Good enough for me. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'd both go home together, 
(
gym.) 
With hearts as light as feathers. 
(
synt.) 
Good evening white folks, one and all, 
Soon married we will be, 
I 
will go and ask my mother if she's 
Good enough for me. 
Oh, there he goes, I 
told you so, 
Now what have I 
to tell, 
He has his say, so I'll have mine, 
And do it mighty well. 
We must get married next week sure, 
Too soon it cannot be, 
I 
will go and ask my mother if he's 
Good enough for me. 
Good evening now, Maria. dear, 
I 
remember your sweet look, 
How oft we sat together, 
Down by the running brook. 
Oh, yes, my dearest petty, 
It is plain enough to see, 
I 
will go and ask my mother if you are 
Good enough for me.

GOOD OLD GEORGIA. 
Way down in good old GeoTgia, 
The place where I 
was born, 
In that rosy, sunny country 
Where I 
used to hoe the corn. 
In childhood's happy moments 
With spirits light and gay, 
I 
long to see my birthplace, 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
CIIORUS. 
I'm travelling back, I'm traveling back, 
I'm traveling night and day, oh. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
I'm traveling all the way, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, for 
I 
couldn't stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
fair one, 
Way down in Dixie's land. 
'Twas there I 
popped the question, 
I 
asked her heart and hand. 
She said her heart and hand were won, 
So from me she did stray, 
My heart is broke and so am I 
But I 
couldn't stay away. 
I'm traveling, etc. 
But since that time she tells me 
The other coon she's shook, 
The pen and ink she took in hand 
And scratched him from her book. 
My name she wrote upon the page, 
Which makes me feel so gay, 
If you won't grieve I'll take my leave 
For I 
cannot stay away. 
I'm traveling, etc.

GOLDEN HAIR. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. HENGLER. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The sun had just gone down 
While pleasantly meandering 
little way from town, 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
Cnonus. 
She smiled so sweet upon me, (symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twits love the first I 
knew. 
There. some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
C11,-111 
kt length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the task, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning. smilin{;, 
Said, oh! I 
think you rude, 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would.

OUR FAVORITE SONG AND DANCE . 
Composed by JAMES R. 
WALsrf. Sung by WALSH and KING. 
'Twas an evening in midsumme-
r, 
When the stars did gently peep, 
Reclining in the meadow, 
I 
tried to doze asleep ; 
When a 
vision of surpassing beauty, 
Then passed me by too soon, 
With form so slight and s!ep so light, 
Where the little roses bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Her name she would not tell me, ( Break.) 
'Twos love then that befell me, 
For the sweetest girl I 
knew ; 
Arm in arm we wandered gaily, 
By the light of the silvery mow; 
She said I'll meet you love again ; 
Where the little roses bloom. 
(Dance.) 
I 
was there on time next evening 
Ere the stars had shown their light ; 
When tripping down the pathway 
She came with footstep slight ; 
Said sl

let us wander 
ough the flowery dell ; 
SaiJ 
your wish is dear to me, 
• 
tales of love let's tell. 
Her name, & c. 
talked and chatted happy, 
The hours flew nimbly by ; 
But when the hour of parting came, 
A tear was in her eye ; 
I 
said it grieves me sorely, 
My love to part with thee; 
Just then I 
saw her handkerchief 
Marked A-N-N-I-E. 
Her name, 8ze.

DANCING ON HE LEVEE. 
Originally sung by BRADLEY

WAS dancing on the levee, 
While the steamboat whistle blowed, 
rhe captain was a 
calling, 
For us figs and all the crew.

And on the boat went, 
And down the Ohio river, 
What a 
lovely time we spent. 
CHORUS, 
Indeed, indeed, I

Of all the figs in the land, 
What sails the Mississippi, 
You'll never find a 
happier fig than Joe 
When we arrived in Tenneasee. 
We throwed a 
gang plank out, 
And when cve got the freight ashore, 
The mokes commenced to shout. 
The captain told us get the banjo. 
And we all could sing, 
And when they play our favorite, 
We cut the pigeon wing. 
DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA 
As sung by John Nolan, the pleasing tenor. 
OH! I

And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly weloomes 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, ke. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and bloesotse 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is fall of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AIR— Slavery Days. 
TORINO. 
SIONIly, day by day, ' till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
lie drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite ; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sin!, his praise ' cept on election days ; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave ; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing duly a 
poor white slave. 
CuoRns. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free ; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
lie is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell ; 
Ile will surely get the middle of .the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for yon or ; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave ; 
I 
low it makes the tear- drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
it has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure ' twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay thc most ; 
Yet, still we can forgive, ' tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life 
passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
lie is nothing only a 
poor white slave.

POOR OLD UNCLE TOM," 
Written and composed by W. J. GROGAN, and sung by him 
with great success in his sketch, " Uncle Tones Return." 
Mv joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bright in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
Ullortus. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apart, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORUS.

When at prayer you kneel, a

Poor Little Joe. 
As sung by BILLY M AYO. 
While strolling one night through New York's gay throng, 
I 
met a 
poor boy—he was singing a 
song 
Although he was singing, he wanted for bread, 
Although he was smiling, he wished himself dead. 
I 
spoke to this poor boy who was out on the street, 
He had no place of shelter, nor had anything to eat ; 
No mother to guide him--in the cold grave lies low, 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Cold blew the blast, and down came the snow, 
No place of shelter, nor nowhere to go ; 
No mother to guide him—in the cold grave lies low, 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
A carriage rolled by with a 
lady inside, 
She fondly caressed her own darling child ; 
Joe followed the carriage—she not even smiled, 
As I 
looked on his face I 
saw that he cried. 
I 
looked at this poor boy, and thought it quite odd, 
I 
lad this poor ragged urchin been forgotten by God ? 
As I 
looked at the gaslight that fell on the snow, 
I 
saw the pale, deathly features of poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, & c. 
The lights had gone out, and the clock had struck One, 
When home came a 
policeman whose duty was done, 
And you'd think by the sound of his dull, heavy tread, 
That he was a-seeking the starving and dead. 
"Oh, what's this ?" ah, then the policeman he cried, 
'Twas poor little Joe—on the steps he had died ; 
With his face turned to Heaven, all covered with snow, 
Died on the cold streets, did poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blasts, &c.

I

And worked among the cotton and corn ; 
Old massa he was good and kind, it filled my eyes with tears,

The rumiticum cotched me, my limbs are getting weak; 
It bent Inc over like the yalIer corn. 
I

When this poor old man am dead and gone.

De rumiticum cotched me, my limbs are getting week, 
It bent me over like the yaller corn.

When this poor old man am dead and gone, 
Now & l.'s de good old missie, she was ebber kind to me; 
To please her was my very heart's delight; 
But death did know no tokens, it took her off one day, 
And now she's living with the angels bright. 
The old plantation's changed about, the boy am gone away, 
No more shall hoe de green and yaller corn ; 
And I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this Nor old man am dead and gone. 
De rumiticum cotched me, &c. 
Now it's hard to be contented when eberything is changed; 
Old massa and missie gone from me. 
But de good book says be patient, and try and bar up your 
pains, 
And soon from toil and sorrow I'll be free; 
But here I 
is a 
weeping in sorrow all alone, 
With no one left to cheer me while I 
stay; 
And I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a

When this poor old man am passed away.

With the neighbors that's on the same block. 
There's Cornelius, the youngest of eleven, 
He's a 
twin to his big brother Cile 
That's left him and went off to heaven, 
To spend six years up on the Isle. 
And Patsy, the Bum, as they call him, 
Was hauled in for picking a 
lock, 
And Mickey got licked like the divel 
By the neighbors that live on the block. 
Now there's Polly, my only daughter, 
Who's just turned twelve years of age, 
She's skipping and dancing the tra In 
The same as they do on the stage. 
But the rest of the boys have me crazy, 
For on every one's door they do knock; 
And I'm sure they'll be sent to the Island 
By the neighbors that's on the same block.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. Mcnsn, expressly for MURPHY and MACK. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
he'd get up aid go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, le stole a 
cow, 
A stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
Ile was bred of a 
family of very had rank, 
lie stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
I 
le'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
Ile stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the bo5s, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE—COUNTIM 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent--
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
Ile stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
lie took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took liessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
he'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The 
an that stole the country, 
Written and sung by JoHN MCV EIGH. 
Dedicated to my friend HARRY 
McAvoY. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to tell, 
And every one of you know him well ; 
lie's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best ; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
l 
le knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray ; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
Ile knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother ; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys" silly, 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
Ile eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards. 
LAIL*/ 
.;z110, 
THE MAN THAT KNEW THE ACTORS. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends ; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick ; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
Ile knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to- day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: "Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose . 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: " Ye're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street; 
And now he knows no actor.

I 
AM waiting here to meet my darling, 
And my heart is in a 
flutter ot delight, 
For we kissed last night when we were parting., 
And this is where she bid me come to-night. 
When away from her I

I 
know not what to do, 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Her heart is warm and true. 
Oh I 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blusher", 
She turned her face away the blush to hide, 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell; 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And (lark blue is the color of her eyes, 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses,

FLIP FLAP ON MY EAR. 
Looking for Dates. 
Written by Haley ..f; West, expressly for and sung only by _Gus Peters 
the original breakneck song ct dance roan. 
I 
am a 
lively little moke, without a 
thought of care 
I 
sing and dance -both night and day with heart as light as 
air, 
I've got a 
girl and she loves me, she's the sweetest ever seen, 
She wears a 
number eleven shoe, she is my fairy queen, 
I 
took her to a 
ball, she was the pride of all, 
This charming little dear, 
But she opened all their eyes, and 1,1ok them by surprise, 
When she threw a 
double flip flap on her ear. 
Of all the girls you ever saw she is the boss of all, 
She's got a 
hand just like a 
ham so delicately small, 
ller mouth looks like a 
liver split, and dark green are her 
eyes, 
She's got a 
hump upon her hack, and her cars are such a 
As we walk along the street, the gents all smile so sweet, 
-We're known both flu' and near, 
But it ' aint every body knows that I 
stand upon my nose, 
And throw a 
double flip flap on my ear. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME for his friend BASILE AMES. 
Good morning, Mr. Agent, 
Anything new to -
day ? 
Heard from his Nibs in Boston, 
What did he have to say? 
What! says he never heard of us ? 
Well, he must have a 
cheek ; 
We've been together for the last ten years, 
And never lost a 
week. 
Cull we have the finest wardrobe, 
And all our acts are new. 
My partner he can do the flip, 
And I 
can do one, too; 
Our breakneck biz it is immense, 
We're sure to kill them dead ; 
My pard he turns a 
double, 
And stands right on his head. 
We also do a 
double clog, 
Or on the end can sit ;: 
I 
know all the funny gags, 
And my partner does the split. 
-We also do an Irish act, 
And I 
can walk a 
rope, 
Do straight biz for a 
stump speech, 
And we furnish our own soap. 
I 
can sing a 
ballad, dance a 
fling, 
Or do the man fish act; 
I 
work in dramas, I'm a 
funny clown, 
I 
can split them up the back. 
So that must be a 
mistake, 
Or the salary is too high; 
Von can't be up with cullies 
Who think they are too fly. 
So just drop him another line 
And tell him what we do, 
And if you can't catch a 
hundred, 
Take twenty for the two.

Cease then your weary repining, 
Banish the tear from thy cheek, 
With my arms 'round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
Speak to me, then, etc.

SONG AND DANCE. 
My heart it is so full of love, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
If I 
could only see that girl 
That I 
saw dressed in blue. 
While walking out one evening, 
My heart did palpitate, 
For passing by her house, I 
saw 
Her standing at the gate 
CHORUS. 
She is the sweetest ever seen, ( Break.) 
And dresses like a 
queen, ( Break.) 
Her hair it hangs in ringlets, 
And oh, such lovely eyes ; 
If ever I 
should marry her, 
You bet I'd get a 
prize. 
I 
called around next evening, 
All dressed in clothes the best, 
With patent leather heeled boots, 
A 
nice silk hat and vest. 
We walked and we talked together, 
Until it was quite late, 
And bidding her a 
sweet good-night 
I 
left her at the gate. 
She is the sweetest, & c. 
So now we're to be married, 
Oh, what a 
happy time ; 
An invitation I'll give all 
To come with us and dine. 
So now I'll bid you all good- night, 
I 
haven't time to wait, 
For I'm a 
going round the corner 
To meet her at the gate. 
She is the sweetest, &c.

New Vork, in the sketch of " Jealousy or Two Can Play at that 
Game," and in all the principal theatres in America. 
If you'll listen while I

ditty— 
It's about the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
goshe is sure to be there, 
And if I 
don't do why just as she asks me, 
She wiil help herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all troubles, I 
cannot live happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will shove in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent to jail or to congress 
Than to live all my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children 
Whenever she happens to go out in the street, 
She's a 
hole in het mouth like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A hump on her back— I'll never mention her feet, 
And she's got a 
notion that site is good-looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seen, 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The very first squint she breaks the machine. 
My life is, & c. 
Now I 
told her one day when I 
married her daughter, 
That I 
did not intend the whole family to wed, 
When she quick helped herself to a 
bucket of water 
And taking good aim let it fly at my head. 
Now I've heard that they had some good shooting at 
Creedmoor, 
And the shots were so close they were all but a 
draw,. 
But I'd give ten dollars to any good shooter, 
That could rid me at once of my mother-in-law.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tlietOld-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—llearts, Clubs, Dia. 
mends and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
amd K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such s. way as to be non-coinmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
.) rnent. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the difti-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may he enjoyed by evening parties

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged. so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has boon sent us, called HUMPTY D UMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
