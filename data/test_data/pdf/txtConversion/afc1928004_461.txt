HOME RULE. 
AB 
sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Composed by MARY Lpargrag. 
It's many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a-beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me, I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mulinger. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for 
this very right 
My countryman are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our county from oppression long ago; 
Henry Grattan is his name and may heaven be his gain. 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving 
now 
To win our Legislator back again, 
John Martin, ever bold, our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the 
huts, 
Be a 
liome rule for Ireland for evermore. 
A WELCOME TO PARNELL. 
BY 
EDWARD S. CREAMER. 
We'd welcome thee, brave Parnell! great 
Art thou in coming her to speak 
Of wrongs which seem to antidote 
• 
Men's justice—kindness to the weak. 
Thou art to come, too, asking aid 
For them amidst a 
bitter strife; 
Now battling bravely, not afraid, 
For sustenance, for home, for life. 
No demagogue art thou to rise 
Men's passions to secure the will, 
And pointing them unto the skies, 
Plant in their bosoms lies that kill. 
No! thou art planting seed that when 
It grows will give them life anew; 
The land will then be owned by men 
Whose feet shall brush the morning dew. 
The nineteenth century is here! 
The past, we bless it, let it go! 
Whate'er was good we'll still hold dear, 
But bury deep our source of woe. 
Those fires that feed our bigotry 
Must be put out, and not renewed, 
If we are worthy to be free, 
And not of fools the chosen brood. 
Work on, Parnell! thou'rt understood; 
Poor Erin's trust in thee we see, 
Co-working creeds for common good— 
A 
Nation's life with unity! 
The grave without an epitaph 
May not much longer be that way; 
Too long the Shades has had their laugh 
About it—but soon breaks the day! 
And thou, my native land, look up! 
Streaks of this daylight now appear; 
Thy Sons will yet quaff Freedom's cup— 
Oh, strugglihg ones at home, good cheer! 
The old sod shall be yours once more! 
From sea-washed rock to mountain crag! 
With equal rights from shore to shore, 
And bannered by an Irish flag.

SUFFERING FOR OUR NATIVE LAND. 
AIR.--1 Hare no Mother Now. 
Think of your poor unhappy brothers, 
Stricken by a 
tyrant's hand; 
Banished from their home and country, 
Because they loved their native land. 
Far from all they loved and cherished, 
Perchance to see their friends no more, 
But we'll ne'er forget the exiles 
. Driven from old Erin's shore. 
Cnonus. 
Helpless, lonely. see this martyred band, 
Exiled— suffering for their native land! 
Far away, with naught to cheer them, 
Save to dream of their loved Isle; 
Rude, unfeeling soldiers guard them — 
Treat their suffring with grim smile. 
Not a 
kindly friend to greet them— 
Not a 
single friendly hand 
Is extended to those exiles 
Suffering for their native land. 
Helpless, lonely, ete. 
Years may pass—their spirits broken, 
And Ireland still remain in chains; 
All their sufferings may be useless, 
Vain their sorrow and its pains! 
But, if earnest prayers can aid them, 
They, with Ireland, will be free; 
For ten million prayers are wafted 
By their friends across the sea. 
Helpless, lonely, etc. 
British power may soon be broken— 
Freedom reign upon our shore— 
Ireland's sons dethrone the Vampire/ 
Exile's fetters gall no more. 
Retribution then shall follow 
For the wrongs we now endure; 
When our people strike for freedom 
Vengeance shall be swift and sure. 
Helpless, lonely, etc, 
VIE GREEN FLAG Or IRELANIA 
Am: Jessie, the _Hower of Dumblane. 
The flag is unfolded in glorious splendor, 
And Erin's brave heroes will flock to the scene, 
Each son of the soil rises up a 
defender, 
Who'll die to preserve the bright Emerald Green; 
For dear to each Irishman's heart is the Island 
That witnessed his birth, far beyond the deep sea; 
And thousands will spring from the lowland and 
highland, 
From base British rule their fair country to free. 
Oh! where is the man that would court degradation, 
Contented to live 'neath a 
foreigner's rule! 
And, deaf to the cry of his down- trodden nation, 
Sit down, and become a 
gross tyrant's base tool? 
The Green Flag of Ireland floats proudly 
ofore us, 
And gladdens the heart of each valiant son, 
The " Sunburst of Freedom" now shines brightly o'er 
us, 
Nor sinks in the west till the brave work is done. 
Then arouse, Sons of Erin, and strike for your Fr 
dom, 
Old Ireland's awake to her danger and need, 
Her sons should be ready, for soon she will need 
them, 
Bright laurels await ye for each gallant deed. 
The time is at hand when each man should be ready, 
And Britain no longer will dare make a 
stand; 
With hearts true as steel, and with hands sure and 
steady, 
The Green Flag of Ireland will wave o'er our laud.

GOD LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON OUR NATIVS 
LAND. 
AM: California Brothers. 
We have suffered cruel bondage 
With our hearts bowed down with woe, 
While a 
tyrant's rod hangs o'er us, 
Ready for enother blow; 
Poverty is with us daily— 
Want and. wretchedness at hand, 
Still, we trust that God with favor 
Looks upon our Native Land. 
Years of tireless, stern oppression 
Have been meted out to all: 
Scenes of violence and injustice— 
'Never heeding Mercy's call. 
For a 
trifling misdemeanor. 
Men to prison have been sent; 
Their families adrift were turned then 
Because they could not " pay their real" 
The English storehouses o'prflowing— 
Are. filled from Ireland's fertile fields; 
While her revenue from our Island 
Yearly full eight millions yields! 
Of her army ever boasting— 
Well disciplined, brave—but then, 
Can the fact be e'er disputed? 
Thousands are brave Irishmen! 
Irishmen, oh! how much longer 
Shall such fearful wrongs be borne? 
The prayers of five million people 
Ask for relief at night and morn. 
Cast to the winds this meek endurance, 
Each head erect, and clenched each hand, 
Strive for your rights, with this assurance, 
" 
God looks with favor on our Lan.d1" 
THE MINSTREL BOY. 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him, 
His father's sword he has girded on, 
And his wild harp slung behind him. 
" 
Land of song !" said the warrior bard, 
Tho' all the world betrays thee, 
One sword, ut least, thy rights shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee." 
The minstrel fell I 
but the foemen's chain 
Could not bring his proud soul under; 
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again, 
For he tore its cords asunder ; 
And said, " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery! 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free, 
They shall never sound in slavery." 
THE HARP. 
The harp that once through Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's wails • 
As if that soul were fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days— 
So glory's thrill is o'er ; 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright, 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The chord, alone, that.breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes, 
The only throb she gives, 
Is when some heart indignant breaks, 
To glow that still she lives. 
NATIONAL HYMN OF IRELAND. 
AIR: Marseillaise Hymn. 
0, Sons of Ireland, are ye still dreaming? 
Awake! ' tis your country bids you rise; 
The sword of vengeance now is gleaming, 
Your wrongs ascend unto the skies; 
Your wrongs ascend unto the skies, 
Shall tyrant's measure still degrade you, 
A 
foreign ruler hold your land? 
Still bind you with a 
brazen band, 
And laugh to see the slaves he's made you? 
Throw off your lethargy, 
Arise and you'll be free, 
time! ' tis time, now sound the wax-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty! 
For years the ruthless tyrant's dealings 
Have crushed the spirit of your sires, 
And trampling on their finer feelings, 
He has mocked their holiest desires. 
He has mocked their holiest desires, 
Can deeds like these e'er be forgiven? 
The wronger still unpunished be? 
A 
stain on men who would be free, 
Your sires look down on you from Heaven, 
Shake off this lethargy, 
Strike now, and you'll be free, 
'Tis time! ' tis time! now sound the wax-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty! 
Sons of Ireland, think of each martyred brother 
Reposing in a 
foreign land, 
The widow and the stricken mother 
Deprived of a 
protecting nand. 
Deprived of a 
protecting hand, 
Their blood for vengeance loud is crying, 
And who'll be deaf unto that call? 
Arouse, ye Sons of Erin, all! 
Danger and death alike defying; 
Shake off this lethargy' 
One blow, and yell befree, 
Ms 
time! 'tis time! now sound the war-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty! 
NATIONAL HYMN OF IRELAND. 
Concluded. 
There's but one alternative before you--
To strike, or be slaves as of yore; 
Make one more effort, I 
implore you, 
And hurl the tyrant from yr•ur shore, 
And hurl the tyrant from your shore. 
What right has England to enslave you, 
Demand allegiance at your hands, 
And take possession of your lands? 
Pure love of country now must save you. 
Shake off this lethargy, 
Resolve now to be free, 
'Tis time! ' tis time! now sound the war-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty! 
Your wrongs have now grown past enduring, 
Arise! and east your chains away, 
Nor list to promises alluring, 
For Freedom ushers in the day, 
For Freedom ushers in the day. 
Be firm; let Ireland show her power, 
And every man be at his post 
To drive the tyrant's hinling host; 
For now's the day, and now's the hour. 
Shake off this lethargy, 
Strike now, and you'll be free, 
time! ' tis time! now sound the war-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty! 
When peace and liberty are reigning 
-Upon our once unhappy land, 
Forever Freedom then retaining, 
United as brothers, heart and hand, 
united as brothers, heart and hand. 
May sweet prosperity then bless us, 
Freed from degrading foreign power 
Our children oft will bless this hour, 
tind in their happiness caress us; 
Then away, dull lethargy; 
Strike now, and you'll be free, 
'Tis time! ' tis time! now sound the war-cry, 
Ireland, and Liberty!

IRELAND WILL YET BE FREE. 
AIR—Liberty Tree. 
Let tyrants exult, and their mandates proclaim, 
Their sceptres with iron hands sway; 
Oppression the Irish heart never can tame 
Nor drive hope of Freedom away. 
The yoke may be heavy, and firm in its place, 
The fetters secure all may be, 
But blood! will wash out this most sharaful disgrace, 
And Ireland, ere long shall be free. 
The day may be distant—perhaps it is near, 
When Freedom shall dawn on our land, 
When Ireland no longer a 
tyrant need fear, 
Her rights she will seek and demand, 
Her fields, now deserted, shall blossom once more, 
Her ships will skim over the sea, 
The hirelings of England be hurled from our shore, 
And Ireland will truly be free. 
Then toast our fair Island, my countrymen all, 
" 
Success to her struggle so nigh." 
Her sons will spring forth at the first trumpet call, 
And battle for Freedom, or die! 
Then when we have conquered and Peace smiles again, 
Let this our grand toast ever be : 
" 
Confusion to tyrants wherever they reign," 
And Ireland shall ever be free 1 
THE TREATY STONE OF LIMERICK. 
ANON. 
The Treaty Stone of Limerick! the monument un-
built, 
Of Irish might, and Irish right—and Saxon shame 
and guilt— 
That saw the Prince of Orange the siege obliged to 
raise, 
And leave his wounded Brandenburghs to perish in 
the blaze; 
When the storied maids and matrons rushed fearless 
on the foe, 
At the breach where fell their kinsmen, by the side 
of Bosselau— 
That saw the vet'ran conqueror of Aughrim and Ath-
lone, 
Forced to comply with D'Usson's terms—the aged 
Treaty Stone. 
The Treaty Stone of Limerick—that oft, with magic 
charm, 
Lit up in wrath the Irish heart, and nerved the Irish 
arm. 
What hewed, in scores, at Fontenoy, King George's 
cohorts down, 
But burning thoughts of thee and home—the treaty-
riven town? 
And 0! how Sarstield's great heart throbbed on Lon-
don's bloody field, 
That fast for thee, for fatherland, his life-stream he 
could yield. 
Thrice holier than the treasure robbed by England's 
King from scone, 
In the glory of old Luimeneach—the hallowed Treaty 
Stone.

WE'LL PLEDGE A MILLION IRISH VOLUN-
TEERS. 
Come, all ye gallant Irishman. I'll sing to you a 
song, 
And you'll indorse each word I sing with cheering 
loud and long. 
The subject is " Old Ireland," the country of our birth, 
Whose people are unhappy, and their spirits crushed 
to earth. 
But, boys, the time rolls on apace when we will 
strike the blow. 
And battle with determined strength to lay the tyrant 
low. 
Then, let your minds be easy, boys, and cast aside 
your fears, 
To Erin we will pledge a 
Million Irish Volunteers I 
John Bull shall tremble in dismay when we are in 
the field, 
For well he knows that Irishmen in battle seldom yield, 
For danger we too oft have met, and stared Death in 
the face, 
To fear the roar of poor old Bull, for that would be 
disgrace, 
Our men are firm—with nerves of steel, and waiting 
for the day 
When Ireland brings her army out in glorious array, 
And when the green flag is unfurled we'll hail it with 
three cheers, 
And pledge to Ireland, when she calls, A Million 
Volunteers ! 
Our men will flock from every land unto their native 
shore, 
When Ireland has her freedom, and owns British rule 
no more, 
Surrounded by united friends, as freemen we will stand, 
And praise to God, and songs of joy shall ring 
throughout the land. 
Then drink success to Erin's cause, and sound the 
battle-cry, 
And let each Irishman resolve to conquer or to die; 
Old Johnny Bull will stare with fright and tremble 
in his fears, 
When Ireland brings into the field A 
Million Volunteer/

THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD. 
Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight? 
Who blushes at the name? 
When cowards mock the patriot's fate, 
Who hangs his head for shame? 
ile's all a 
knave, or half a 
slave, 
Who slights his country thus; 
But a 
true man, like you, man, 
Will fill your glass with us. 
We drink the memory of the brave, 
The faithful and the few— 
Some lie far off beyond the wave— 
Some sleep in Ireland, too; 
are gone—but still lives on • 
The fame of those who died— 
All 
men, like you, men, 
Remember them with pride. 
Some on the shores of distant lands 
Their weary hearts have laid, 
And by the stranger's heedless hands 
Their lonely graves were made; 
But, though their clay be far away 
Beyond the Atlantic foam— 
In true men, like you, men, 
Their spirit's still at home. 
They rose in dark and evil days 
To right their native land; 
They kindled here a 
living blaze 
That nothing sh;111 withstand. 
Alas! that Mi.4
1.1t, can vmquish Right— 
They fell and pat6.‘:1 away; 
But true men, like you, men, 
Are plenty here to-day. 
Then here's their memory—may it be 
For us a 
guiding light. 
To cheer our strife for liberty, 
And teach us to unite. 
Through good and ill, he Ireland's still 
Though sad as theirs your fate; 
And true men be you, men,.

=WET'S GRAVE. 
BY BRYAN 51AGUIRS. 
In his own loved island, the hero now slumbers; 
No monument stands o'er the patriot's grave, 
The harp alone tells, with faint echoing numbers. 
The name of the martyr, the death of the brave. 
For the land of his fathers, his own lovely Erin; 
His life he gave freely, despising all pain; 
But the wild weeds alone o'er his dust are now rear-
ing, 
He'll never be seen in the struggle again. 
Alas! that a 
soul of such worth had departed, 
Ere freedom's green banner could wave o'er his clay; 
But freedom e'er smiles on the brave and true-hearted, 
And his grave is made sacred by glory's bright ray. 
For, oh! never yet, in his native island, 
Rath the martyr, for freedom, his blood shed in vain: 
His praise is e'er sung through the valley and high-
land, 
Though he never should come to the struggle again. 
But ages, hereafter, will smile at his glory, 
And brave hearts will start at the sound of his name. 
For proudly it lives in the Bard's brightest story, 
And history hands it away down to fame. 
Then sleep, oh, sleep on, in thy glory unbounded; 
Still, still, in the depths of our hearts thou'llt remain; 
Thy praises, oh, Emmet, o'er thy grave shall be 
sounded, 
Though thou never may'st jclinin the, etrunk 480.irk,

EMMET! 
Ax — The Sword of Bunker Hill. 
Erect he stood, before the judge, 
With firm, unflinching eye, 
The fatal words had been pronounced— 
The noble man must die, 
Tho' doomed to part with all he loved, 
By cruel Fate's decree; 
His faith was strong—he still believed, 
That Ireland would be free! 
Oh. God! why should so brave a 
man 
His noble life thus yield? 
A 
patriot would rather die 
Upon the battle-field, 
But cruel judges doomed the man, 
Alas! that it should be. 
Let others emulate him still 
And Ireland will be free, 
Let others emulate him still 
And Ireland will be free. 
A martyr's death is not in vain, 
For, though he is no more, 
And millions more be sacrificed 
As millions have before. 
When Irishmen shall rush to arms, 
Their battle-cry will be: 
"Avenge our noble Emmet's death," 
And Ireland shall be free, 
" 
Avenge our noble Emmet's death," 
And Ireland shall be free. 
When despots rule, and bind the chain 
Upon another's hand 
And Freedom's made a 
mockery 
Throughout the doomed land; 
Then every patriot should unfurl 
The flag of Liberty— 
Inscribe on it brave Emmet's name, 
And fight till Ireland's free, 
Inscribe on it brave Emmet's name, 
And fight till Ireland's free.

IRISH MARTYRS, 
Ant—My Emmet's No Moro. 
Oh ! sad was the fate of those brave sons of Erin, 
Who forfeited life in their country's cause ; 
Like heroes they stood on the scaffold, to perish ; 
Poor *victims to England's tyranical laws. 
The last words they uttered were " God bless Old 
Ireland, 
And speed on the hour when she shall be free." 
Then each gave a 
brief, silent pray'r to Heaven, 
Then died for Old Ireland, the " Gem of the Sea." 
Let every true Irishman swear by their memory, 
To wipe out with blood this base shedding of theirs; 
And teach all your children at night and at morning, 
To tlaink of these martyrs when saying their.prayers. 
Their forms may decay, and their graves be forgotten; 
But deep in each Irishman's heart they will live. 
The soil of a 
tyrant may hold thEir poor bodies, 
But God to each soul will a 
martyrs' Crown give. 
Ah I 
England beware, for the blood of these martyrs 
Cries loudly for vengeance, nor calls it in vain; 
Ten thousand such lives you may take, but Old Ireland, 
When least ye expect it, her Freedom will gain. 
Our glorious Martyrs! may Heaven avenge them, 
And o'ertake their murderers' with a 
dire fate, 
We'll revere their memory now and forever 
And hate their assasaina with undying hate!,

AN 
AN IBISHMANS' DUTY. 
'  
19 
Ant—Nell Flaugherty's Drake. 
An Irisbmans' duty! ah! who cloth not know ? 
For it is iuscribed on each patriots' heart; 
His aiM must be ever the tyrants' o'erthrow, 
And in Erin's struggle take an active part, 
By day and lay night we must plan and contrive 
To thwart the fell foe who would make him a 
slave, 
A 
hard-working bee in his poor country's hive. 
And with his bold deeds English power to brave. 
An Irishman duty ? the nation has told 
In ages before, what his duty should be; 
The traitor to crush, who his country has sold, 
And help the brave soul, who his country would free. 
To scorn British hire—refuse British gold, 
From those who seek further their souls to enslave, 
To strike kw his righs as his sires did of old— 
Do all that he can do, his country to save. 
An Irishman' duty ? the question don't ask, 
'Twas written long since with the blood of true men, 
All who in the bright rays of Freedom would bask, 
Must battle, to grasp it, again and again. 
To ask such a 
question seems very absurd 
And should be asked only by hireling or slave. 
Brave Emmet, alas! comprehended each word, 
And gave up his life, his loved country to save. 
An Irishman's duty, why need we be told 
Our forefathers taught us the meaning to well, 
Let us emulate the true patriots of old, 
Who in the good cause of Old Ireland fell. 
An Irish mans' duty ? ' tis known to us all. 
Arise, then, and do it, ' tis Ireland command, 
Oh I 
purge your fair country from degrading thrall, 
And win the loud plaudits of ey'ry free land 1

THE EXILE OF ERIN. 
There came to the beach a 
poor exile of Erin, 
The dew on his robe was heavy and chill; 
For his country he sighed, when, at twflight repair-
ing, 
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion, 
For it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
Whei.e once, in the flow of his youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold anthem of Erin go Bragh. 
" 
Oh! sad is my fate," said the heart-broken stranger, 
" 
The wild deer and wolf to a 
covert can flee, 
But I 
have no refuge from famine or danger, 
A home and a 
country remains not for me! 
11 
Ah! never again, in the green shady bower, 
Where my forefathers lived, shall I 
spend the sweet 
hours, 
Or cover my harp with 'the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike the sweet numbers of Erin go Brogli1 
" 
Oh, Erin, my country! though sad and forsake; 
In dreams I 
visit thy sea-beaten shore; 
But, alas! in a 
far foreign land I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more; 
And thou, cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me 
In a 
mansion of peace where no perils can chase met 
Ah! never again shall my brothers embrace me! 
They died to defend me, or live to deplore. 
" 
But yet all its fond recollection suppressing, 
One dying wish my fond bosom shall draw; 
Erin! an exile bequeaths thee his blessing, 
Land of my forefathers, Erin go Bragh! 
Buried and cold, when my heart stills its motion, 
Green be thy fields, sweetest isle in the ocean, 
And the harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion, 
"Erin, mavourneen! sweet Erin go Braghl"

THE GREEN. 
'Tis the green, boys, the green is the color that is true, 
And we'll back it 'gainst the orange, and well raise it 
o'er the blue— 
For the color of our fatherland alone, should here be 
seen; 
'Tis the color of the martyred dead—our own immor-
tal green. 
So we'll up for the green, boys, and up fcr the green, 
'Tis down to the dust, and ashamed to be seen— 
We've hands, boys, we've hands, boys, full strong 
enough I 
ween, 
To rescue and to raise again our own immortal green. 
They may say they have power 'tis vain to oppose; 
'Tis better to obey and live, than surely die as foes; , 
But we scorn all their threats, whatever they may 
mean, 
For we trust in God above us, and we dearly love the 
green. 
So we'll up for the green, boys, and up for the green; 
To die is far better than be cursed as we have been— 
We've hearts boys, we've hearts boys, full strong 
enough I 
ween, 
To rescue and to raise again our own immortal green. 
They may swear, as they often did, our wretchedness 
to cure, . 
But we'll never trust John Bull again, nor let his lies 
allure— 
No, we won't, no, we won't, Bull, for now nor ever 
more, 
For we've hopes from the ocean, and we've trust on 
the shore; 
And our Tone is coming back again, with men enough 
I 
ween, 
To rescue and to raise again our own immortal green. 
Then up for the green, boys, and up for the green, 
Shout it back to the Sasanach—we'll never sell the 
green, 
For our Tone is coming back again with men enough 
I 
ween, 
To rescue and to raise again our own immortal green.

GOD BLESS OLD IRELAND. 
Am—Norah McShane, 
I 
dream of my country beyond the broad ocean, 
The cot near the lake, and the acre of ground; 
It swells my poor heart with the deepest emotion— 
My love for Old Erin is pure and profound, 
The ties of affection—companions of child hood— 
Oh I 
each has a 
place in this wounded heart still, 
As when roving through valleys, and creeping through 
wildwood 
Or view my dear homestead from some distant hill, 
Or view my dear homestead, etc. 
HOW happy I 
felt when I 
first did discover, 
That the love I 
bore Mary she gave unto me ; 
Around her small cabin at night I 
would hover, 
And vowed to the trust I 
would ever prove true, 
But now the broad ocean for years may divide us, 
I 
know she will ever be faithful to me, 
And this be my prayer, whatever betide us, 
God bless dear Old Ireland where'er I 
may be. 
God bless dear Old Ireland, etc. 
Though years may elapse ere she severs each fetter, 
Ere I 
may return to dear Mary and home; 
When free, her brave sons will prize liberty better 
Than now, while so many are doomed to roam, 
Oh ! hasten the day, when her children in gladness, 
Will flock to their country—the Isle of the Sea, 
And, casting aside every vestage of sadness, 
They'll shout, " God bless Ireland, the land of the 
free I" 
They'll shout, " God bles.s isela.nd," etc.

If I 
had on the clear, but five hundred a

'Tis myself would not fear, without adding a

Faith, if such was my lot, litttle Ireland's the spot 
Where I'd build a 
snug cot, with a

As for Italy's dales, with the Alps and high vales, 
Where with fine squalling gales their signoras so

But free and easy ' twould so amaze ye, you'd think

If my friend, honest Jack, would but take a small 
hack, 
And just get on his back, and with joy gallop full 
to us; 
He, throughout the whole year, then should have the 
best cheer, 
For, faith! none so dear as our brother, John Bull, 
to us! 
And we'd teach him, when there, both to blunder 
and swear, 
Which both genteel and neat is, 0

That he never would shrink from. the land of pota-

If some lovely she from old England would favor me; 
For no spot on earth can more merit bring forth, 
If with beauty and worth you embellished would

Good breeding, good nature, you find in each feature, 
That naught you've to teach her, so sweet and com-

THE CROPPY I30Y. 
" 
Good men and true! in this house who dwell, 
To a 
stranger bouchal I 
pray you tell 
Is the priest at home? or may he be seen? 
I 
would speak a 
word with Father Green." 
The youth has entered an empty hall— 
What a 
lonely sound has his light foot-fall? 
And the gloomy chamber's chill and bare, 
With a 
vested priest in a 
lonely chair. 
Thekyouth has knelt to tell his sins; 
" 
Nomine Dei," the youth begins; 
At " mea eulpa " he beat
s his breast, 
And in broken murmurs he speaks the rest. 
" 
At the siege of Ross did my father fall, 
And at Gorey my loving brothers all. 
I 
alone am left of my name and race; 
I 
will go to Wexford and take their place. 
" 
I 
cursed three times since last Easter day— 
At mass-time once I 
went to play; 
I 
passed the churchyard once in haste, 
And forgot to pray for my mother's rest. 
"I bear no hate against living thing, 
But I 
love my country above my king. 
Now, Father, bless me, and let me go, 
To die, if God has ordained it so." 
The priest said naught, but a 
rustling noise 
Made the youth look up in wild surprise; 
The robes were off, and in scarlet there 
Sat a 
yeoman captain with fiery glare. 
With fiery glare and with fury hoarse, 
Instead of blessing, he breathed a 
curse: 
""Twas a 
good thought, boy, to come here and shrive, 
For o.ue short hour is your time to live." 
At Geneva Barrack that young man died, 
And at Passage they have his body laid. 
Good people who live in peace and joy, 
Give a 
prayer and a 
tear for the Croppy Boy. 
MY HEART'S IN OLD IRELAND 
AIR—Rock Me to Sleep, Mother. 
Exiled from Erin, I 
left her fair shore, 
Sadly and lonely I 
roamed the world o'er, 
All that was dear to me in my loved home, 
Memory brings back as daily I 
roam, 
Friends in strange countrias I 
oftimes have met, 
Who, knowing my sorrows, would have me forget. 
Or bidding me hope, for the dawning was nigh, 
When my brave brethren would sound the war-cry. 
CIIORIIS. 
Erin, dear Erin, I 
long for the day, 
Nk hen thy brave sons cast their bondage away. 
But should I 
never that happy day see, 
My heart's still in Ireland, where'er I 
may be. 
Years have gone by since thy fetters were wrought, 
Prayers and entreaties were counted as nought; 
Helpless thou knelt before England in dust, 
Hoping the tyrant at least might be just. 
Vain were thy pleadings, and useless thy tears. 
England has answered with scoffs and with jeers. 
Then sad indignation each bosom did fill, 
And in deep humility bowed to God's will. 
Erin, dear Erin, eta. 
England, thou pitiless tyrant, take heed, 
Nations before us found friends in their need, 
Know, that oppression engenders deep hate, 
Deal with us justly before ' tis too late ; 
Ireland's aroused, and her sons are awake, 
Soon to its centre thy kingdom shall shake--
My country forever, in fetters or free, 
My heart is still with her where'er I 
may be.

TE E EMBROIDERING OF THE FLAG. 
From " O'Connor's Child." 
By, orm F. 
COWAN. 
COM; daughter, bring thy t 
tin green and sit beside my knee. 
A 
story of thy country's wi 'rigs will I 
reveal to thee. 
Then let the shamrock ever Teen old Erin's harp entwine, 
And be its golden cords restaung by those young hands of thine. 
Let no weak teardrop dim thine eyes, but wear thy brow a 
frown, 
And we'll think that every stitch you take binds some proud tyrant 
down. 
Long time old Erin's saintly isle has been oppressed by foes, 
Who trample on her sacred rights and scout at all her woes; 
That foreigners have acted thus is not the worst to feel, 
For baseborn Irishmen there are who kiss oppression's heel; 
Who crook the knee and bow the head beneath the tyrant's rod. 
And for an empty title sell their country and their God. 
'Twas base enough to kneel before the Saxon of the Pale, 
Yet now, unto our troubled shore, they've called the warlike Gael. 
Oh, children of the race of Ir, where has your spirit flown, 
When ev'ry stranger thinks to seize upon the Emerald Throne? 
When foeman march with bloody tramp, o'er mountain. vale and 
lawn, 
To wrest the island scepter from the grasp of Connor Don? 
Up; up! and think upon the fame that lit our lovely- Isle, 
Ere traitor prince, or worthless dame, or slave had sold the soil; 
When Malachi and Brian waved unconquerable swords, 
And, on the plains of Leinster, scourged the Danes invading hordes 
Think of the deeds of prowess wrought by Eath's victorious brand, 
And how the Normans fled before our Cathal's Bloody Hand. 
Then think upon your slaughtered kin and desolated homes, 
And treasure up your anger 'till the hour of vengeance comes. 
There are spears upon the mountain, there are horses in the glen, 
The beltane light will call to fight full thrice ten thousand men; 
Then, like a 
whirlwind rushing forth, go free your sacred soil, 
From Galway shore to Dublin Bay, from Bantry to Lough Foyle! 
TEE DEATH OF EMMETT. 
AIR.—Death of Nelson. 
Written for P. C. Foy, by Whi: CAnLitTON. 
RECITATIVE. 
O'ER Emmett's tomb with silent grief oppressed, 
Hibernia mourns her hero now at rest, 
But Ireland's harp despite its slumb'ring years, 
Breathes Emmett's name, and shares Hibernia's tears. 
In Ireland's bitter plight, a 
hero in his might, 
Rose up for freedom then, 
Being no pampered fool, he scorned the British rule, 
For true born Irishmen. 
Our Emmett tried his land to save, 
His life in freedom's cause he gave, 
For duty only carini! 
he gave his life to Em— 
Throughout the world his summons ran, 
Ireland expects that every man, 
That loves will fight for Erin, 
That loves will fight for Erin. 
Cwst treason found a 
way to blight the light of day, 
Our Emmett was betrayed, 
And Erin's cause was lost, our hero's plans were cross'd 
By an Irish renegade. 
While Emmett's soul was void of gloom, 
A 
hireling judge pronounced his doom, 
And hang, said he, for Erin, 
Brave Emmett died for Erin. 
At last the fatal day which saw his hope decay, 
Brought death and gloom to Ireland's hero's breast; 
" 
Our cause is still alive, pray Heaven it may thrive, 
I 
die, but it will live. 
Let no man write my epitaph until its leading paragraph 
Is liberty for Erin, blest liberty for Erin. 
And when her day of freedom dawns, 
Death, death to all the foreign spawns, 
That trample on poor Erin, 
That trample on poor Eriu." 
0 I 
have you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to-day; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and guns, 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning, 
Their dear old land to see; 
And you and me, must ready be, 
To strike for liberty. 
CHORUS. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And we'll every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fouteuoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore; 
And the dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more, 
And the time we'll play, shall be Patrick's day 
And well play it o'er and o'er, 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more. 
We'll tear, eta. 
We have begged of England long, my boys, 
But now we'll beg no more; 
No more like prowling hounds we'll crawl, 
Around our master's door, 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And soon we'll strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low. 
We'll tear, eta. 
THE DEAR OLD FLAG OF 
GREEN. 
Written by BARNEY FAGAN, and dedicated to the " Munpnys"—PADDt 
and ELLA. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green, 
That emblem of purity in solitude serene; 
With rapture and delight, the Irish bosoms heave, 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave. 
No taint of dishonor at that banner ever hurled 
Since first its proud folds to the breeze was unfurled, 
May the bright sun of Heaven cast its beams on that 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot. 
CHORUS. 
Then let your shouts re-echo far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free, 
Quickly swell your ranks and let your war cry be, 
" 
Death to the tyrants, on! on to victory. 
With pride we can look on the noble deeds of fame 
Of Ireland's trusty warriors, immortal be their name ; 
Foremost in the strife, where falls the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle cry, our patriots help to 
swell. 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand, 
With courage true as steel, and eager for the fray, 
How manfully they strive to help gain the day 
Then let your shouts re-echo, eta. 
All honor to the heroes since lain beneath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay, 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they loved so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clinging of the steel, 
Will be beard the cry of victory as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
'Old Ireland's sons will wake to find the bondage 
chains no more. 
Then let your shouts re-echo, eta.

Oh, Erin, my country, although thy harp slumbers, 
And 1is in oblivion near Tara's old hall, 
Witn scarce one kind hand to enliven ita numbers. 
Or strike the rude dirge to the sons of Fingall. 
Then Erin, my country, I 
love thy green bowers, 
No music to me like thy murmuring ; 
And the shamrock to me is the fairest of flowers, 
And naught is more dear than thy daisy- clad hills.

Then hail fairest island of Neptune's old ocean, 
The land of St. Patrick, my parents agra ; 
Cold, cold must the heart be, and void of emotion,

Then where is the nation can rival old Erin, 
Or where is the country such heroes can boast ? 
In battle they are brave as the lion or tiger, 
And swift as the eagle that flies around our coast. 
The breeze often shakes both the rose and the thiFtle, 
While Erin's green shamrock lies hushed in ill. dell; 
Securely it stand while the stormy winds whistle. 
And lies undi turbed in the moss of the vale.

THE EXILES FAREWELL 
Writte and Composed by BARNEY FAGAN, and dedicated to 
his friend Davy Doherty, of the B. P. 
How dim grow the shore of my own native isle, 
As from its green hills I 
depart an exile, 
My eyes fill with tears and I 
sadly regret, 
The parting with those I 
shall never forget. 
My own darling Aily my playmate of youth, 
That dear soul of innocence, virtue and truth, 
To leave you my heart fills with sadness and pain 
In nay dreams I 
am seeing you, darling, again. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, Mavourneen, from you I 
must roam, 
The cabin and green fields that once were my home; 
My dear aged parents from them I 
depart, 
At leaving you darling it near breaks my heart. 
Oh, when shall I 
visit, the land of my birth, 
The green hills where once full of pleasure and mirth, 
The colleens assembled to join in the glee, 
In my bright days of childhood, .1 
n:s'er more shall 
see. 
How happy the hearth of tile poor Irish lad, 
To wonder alone through the fields I'd be glad, 
Where the bright sunlight rays, cast their beams from 
above, 
On my own Irish home I 
so dearly love. 
Farewell Mavourneen, etc. 
'Tis you my own darling I

How bright your eyes sparkle how glad you will be, 
To hear of my coming back to my home, 
From which I

THE FENIANS' ESOAPE. 
An original song cf the escape of the Fenians' from Australia. 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vo...alist. 
JAMES 0'2‘.,
:EIL. 
Now, boys, if you will listen to the story I'll rt,,
,,iate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe es-
caped, 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Austrail-
ian 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee laud 
set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark " Catalpa," waving proudly to the 
slee, 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys in safety o'er the 
sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prison-
crs to the shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them 
- evermore, 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the 
Yankee flag, 
For well they knew frem its proud folds, no tyraet 
could them drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the " Catalpa" taut 
and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark 
and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," end on her deck there 
stood, 
One hundred hired assassins to eled each patriot's 
blood, 
'1111E FENIANS' ESCAPE. 
Continued. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired 
across her bow, 
They in loud voice commanded that tin vessel should 
" 
Heave to; 
:tut noble Captain Aubrey, in thunder tones did cry, 
--.7ou dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag that floats on 
high. , 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
It's manned by Irish hearts of oak and manly Yankee 
tars, 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be 
seen, 
Ts the banner 
protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher In sailed away, 
from the stars and 
stripes he ran, 
He knew his chance was shalt o 
fight the boys of Unc!e 
Sam, 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did 
go, 
With Hassett and bold Cranston, soon to whip the 
Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble- captain, who well these men 
did free, 
lie dared the English-man-of-war, to fight him on the 
sea, 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph 
shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Ireland'3 
flag of green.

THE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND HAS SEEN. 
As sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, NED BARRY. 
Now since I 
appear here, before you once more, 
1'11 endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native Isle ; 
And 1'11 sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown, shall shine round each heart, 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHattus. 
Then here's to the sons of old Erin Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green. 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show 
Was a 
states!ran, whose equal II as few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the trartyr, he fought for our cause 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
lie died for his country ard Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war hmse would enter the field ; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
13.ut though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
Parliament wish of their own ; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right,'' 
May they harbor no rancour or spleen, 
But when honor demands them, they valliantly fight, 
Like the groat men that Ireland has seen. 
I DREAMED THAT OLD IRELAND WAS FREE. 
Written, composed and sung by JoHNNY GIBBONS. 
One night as I 
slumbered in sweet, peaceful rest, 
Tired out from a 
long day of toil; 
My thoughts, like a 
bird, o'er the ocean's white crest, 
Wandered back to my own native soil. 
But a 
great change had come, since the time when it) 
boy, 
I 
played round my old mother's knee, 
And my heart seemed to leap in my bosom with joy, 
For I 
dreamed that old Ireland was free. 
CHORUS. 
The days of her freedom at last had a 
word, 
The time that we all long to see ; 
For which our great ancestors nobly had strove, 
dreamed that old Ireland was free. 
I 
thought the chains that had bound her were broke 
And the dear little Isle of my birth; 
At last horn her slumbers of years had awoke, 
And again was a 
power on earth. 
The green flag of Erin was proudly unfurled, 
O'er the Emerald Isle of the sea ; 
And loudly announced to the wondering world, 
At last dear old Ireland was free. 
The days of her, etc. 
I 
awoke and I 
found that 'twas only a 
dream, 
A 
dream that had fled with the night, 
For when through the window the morning sunbeam, 
Shone in, my visions t‘-,ok flight. 
I 
sank on my knees 
my bed- side to pray, 
That the time may not far distant be, 
When my vision shall come in the broad light of day, 
And will welcome old Ireland free. 
The days of her freedomi etc.. I

WON'T HEAR OLD IRELAND RUN DOWN. 
Witten and sung by HENRY CA 
RINEY, with great success. 
THERE'S a 
dear little spot call'd the Emerald Isle, 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils 
When people speak of it with scorn ; 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand 
!'h at. I 
cannot imagine why people should speak, 
In dispraise of my dear native land. 
CHORUS. 
So--Hurrah for old Ireland, the land o! iny birth, 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
won't hear old Ireland run down. 
I'm sure that no Irishman cver need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishman only can do, 
When foes of their country were nigh ; 
And in modern times, when for England they fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea, when danger was near, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, etc. 
Fife names of O'Connell, and all such .as he, 
Should make every Irishman proud •, 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were, 
With wit and with wisdom endowed ; 
They spoke for their conatry, eAitvery man should, 
No matter what country or creed ; 
So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, - 
For they proved true in thought, word and deed, 
So— Hu-rah for old Ireland etc. 
Oh ! Erin, my country, though strangers may roam, 
Thy His and thy mountains I 
once called my own 
Thy lakee and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But warmly as ever my hearebeats for the°. 
CHORUS. 
Erin ! Erin ! my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since the last time we 
met, 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget: 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
Oh ! " Cushla Machree," etc. 
Dear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of yore : 
And my heart's latest wish, the sigh of my breast 
;hall be for thee, dear home, the land of the west.

C. Foy, Irish Tenor 
Ala :---" Erin Go Biagh." 
Greeks and Romans may boast of their ancient heroes, 
Philosophers, poets and authors, too ; 
But though we had neve? a 
Homer or Nero, 
Had they ever a 
prince like hold Brian Born ? 
A 
chieftain he was, who made all the world fear n 
In peace or in war he was dauntless and free; 
His slogan in battle it oftimes did cheer us, 
And he died for his country, the gem of the sea,

Then hurrah for old Erin, the birthplace of beauty, 
Hurrah for her daughters, so fair to be seen ; 
Hurrah for her sous, who in war do their duty, 
Hurrah for the shamrock; that plant ever green. 
The poets we've had now on history's pages, 
One name there is deeply engraven, I'm sure; 
TTis equal they never had in the dark ages, 
Long life to his memory, the gifted Tom Moore.

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN, 
Written by F. P, CARL 
Sung by JOHN' FIELDING. 
AM a 
true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
There the stranger finds a welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure' does 
abound, 
And goad nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
he'll treat you to the very best, quite welcome you will be, 
he'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he wille heer, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so dear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Irelend, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have

Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must own, 
And if you're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile, 
May discord and ill- feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so green.

PATRIOTS OF IRELAND. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL, Great Irish Vocalist. 
Now, friends, if you will listen I'll sing to you a 
song 
Of Ireland and her sons we loved so dear; 
There were patriots and heroes, and their Dam— 
we love to hear, 
For the green they were not afraid to wear. 
There was one so young and noble, who for his 
country died. 
To remember him the Irish won't forget; 
Perhaps you've read his speeches in the Irish his-
tory; 
This hero's name was Robert Emmet. 
Chorus. 
Then give three cheers for Ireland, 
And let the people see 
That our rifles all are ready 
To set old Ireland free. 
There's another I 
will mention, and to Irishmen 
most dear, 
And for Ireland he proved a 
useful tool, 
I 
mean Dan O'Connell, may his soul now rest in 
peace, 
For dearly he loved Ireland and home rule. 
There were three patriots to this world did bid 
good-by 
. 
Before they could finish their design, 
They died band in hand trying to free their native 
land, 
Three martyrs, Allen, Larkin and O'Brien.

Our Lillie loved the spring flowers, 
And often told their praises, 
She loved the early blossoms, 
But most of all the daisies; 
And when the twilight shadows 
Come with the silent hours, 
She prayed to leave her happy home 
And slumber with the flowers. 
We pressed her eyelids gently down, 
And hushed the little lisper; 
But the wish was heard in Heaven, 
And angels caught the whisper; 
So, when the wandering sun beam 
Were caught in leafy mazes, 
We laid our little Lillie 
To sleep among the daisies.

Oh! I

But I'll confess that I'm content, 
No more I

Oh! steer my bark to Erin's isle— 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh! steer my bark, etc. 
If England were my place of birth, 
I'd love her tranquil shore; 
But if Columbia were my home, 
her freedom I'd adore. 
Though pleasant days in both I

I

Oh! steer my bark to Erin's isle, 
For Erin is my home.

THE 
CELEBRATED SPEECH 
OF 
ROBERT EMMET, ESQ., 
LEADER OF THE IRISH INSURRECTION OF 1803. 
Mi 
LORDS, —I 
am asked what have I 
to say why 
sentence of death should not be pronounced on me 
according to law? I 
have nothing to say that can al-
ter your predetermination, nor that it will become me 
to say, with any view to the mitigation of that sen-
tence which you are to p7onounee, and I 
must abide 
by. 
But I 
have that to say which interests me more 
than life, and which you have labored (as was neces-
sarily your office in the present circumstances of this 
oppre,;sed country) to destroyI have much to say 
why my reputation should be rescued from the load 
of false accusations and calumny which has been 
heaped upon it. 
I 
do not imagine that seated where 
you are, your minds can be so free from impurity, as 
to receive the least impression from what I 
am going 
to utter. 
I 
have no hopes that I 
can anchor my char-
acter in th? breasts of a 
Court constituted and tram-
m:led as this is, 
I 
only wish, and it is the utmost I 
expect, that your Lordships may suffer it to float 
down your memories untainted by the foul breath of 
prejudice, until it finds sonic more hospitable harbor 
to shelter it from storm by which it is at present buf-
feted. 
Were I 
only to suffer death, after being adjudged 
guilty by your tribunal I 
should bow in silence, and 
meet the fate that awaits me without a 
murmur; but 
the sentence of the law which delivers my body to 
the executioner, will, through the ministry of that 
law, labor in its own vindication, to consign my char-
acter to obloquy; for there must be guilt somewhere; 
whether in the sentence of Court or in the catastro-
phe, posterity must determine. 
A man in my situa-
tion, my Lords, has not only to encounter the diffi-
culties of fortune, and the force of power over minds 
which have corrupted or subjugated, but the difficul-
63 
EMMET'S SPEECH. 
ties of established prejudice; the man dies, but his 
memory lives; that mine may not perish—that it may 
live in the respect of my countrymen—I 
seize upon 
this opportunity to vindicate myself from some of the 
charges alleged against me. 
When my spirit shall 
be wafted to a more friendly port—when my shade 
shall have joined the bands of those martyred heroes 
who have shed their blood on the scaffold and in the 
field, in defence of their country and virtue, this is 
my hope—I 
wish that my memory and name may an-
imate those who survive me, while I 
look down with 
complacency on the destruetion of that perfidious 
government, which upholds its dominion by blas-
phemy of the Most High; which displays its powers 
over man as over the beasts of the forest; which sots 
man upon his brother, and lifts his hand in the name 
of God against the throat of his fellow, who believes 
or doubts a 
little more than the Government stand-
ard—a 
Government steeled to barbarity by the cries 
of the orphans and the tears of the widows which it 
has made. 
(Here Lord Norbury Interrupted Mr. Emmet—saying, that the 
mean and wicked enthusiasts who felt as he did, were not equal to 
the accomplishment of theiNwild design. 
I 
appeal to the hninaculate God—I 
swear o3,- the 
throne of Heaven, before which I 
must shortly appear 
—by the blood of the murdered patriots who have 
• 
gone before me, that my conduct has been, through 
all this peril and through all my purposes, governed 
only by the convictions which I 
have uttered, and by 
no other view than that of their cure, and the email-
cittation of my country from the superinhuman op-
pression under which she has so long and too patient-
ly travailed; and I 
confidently and assuredly hope 
that, wild and chimerical as it may appear, there is 
still union and strength in Ireland to accomplish this 
noblest enterprise. 
Of this I speak with the confidence of intimate 
knowledge, and with the consolation that appertains 
to that confidence. 
Think not my Lords, I 
say this 
for the petty gratification of giving you a transitory 
uneasiness; a 
man who never yet raised his voice to

EMMET'S SPEECH. 
assert a 
lie, will not hazard his character with poster-
ity by asserting a 
falsehood on a 
subject so import-
ant to his country, and on an occasion like this. 
Yes, 
my Lords, a 
man that does not wish to have his epi-
taph written until his country is liberated, will not 
leave a 
weapon in the power of envy, nor pretend to 
impeach the probity which he means to preserve 
even in the grave to which tyranny consigns him. 
(Here he was again interrupted by the court.) 
Again I 
say, that what I 
have spoken was not in-
tended for your lordships, whose situation I 
commis-
erate rather than envy—my expressions were for my 
countrymen—if there is a 
true Irishman present let 
my last words comfort him in the hour of affliction. 
(Hera he vas a; tin interrupted; Lord Norbury said be did not sit 
there to hear traai3n.) 
I 
have always understood it to be the duty of a 
judge, when a 
prisoner has been convicted, to pro-
nounce the sentence of law; I 
have also understood 
that judges sometimes think it their duty to hear 
with patience, and to speak with humanity; to ex-
hort the victim of the laws, and to offer, with tender 
benignity, his opinion of the motives by which he was 
actuated in the crime of which he was .adjudged 
guilty. 
That a 
judge has thought it his duty so 
to have done, I 
have no doubt; but where is the 
boasted freedom of your institutions—!where is the 
vaunted impartiality, clemency, and mildness of your 
courts of justice, if an unfortunate prisoner whom 
your policy, and not your justice, is about to deliver 
into the hands of the executioner, is not suffered to 
explain his motives sincerely and truly, and to vindi-
cate the principles by which he was actuated. 
My Lords, it may be a 
paLt of the system of angry 
justice to bow a 
man's mind by humiliation to the 
proposed ignomity of the scaffold—but worse to me 
than the proposed shame, or the scaffold's terrors, 
would be.the shame of such foul and unfounded im-
putations as have been laid against me in this court. 
You, my Lord, are a 
Judge; I 
am the supposed cul-
prit; I 
am a 
man; you are a 
man also; by a 
revolt"-

tion of power, we might change places, though we 
never could change characters. 
If I 
stand at the bar 
of this court, and dare not vindicate my character, 
what a 
farce is your justice; if I 
stand at this bar and 
dare not vindicate my character, how dare you cal-
umniate it? 
Does the sentence of death, which your 
unhallowed policy inflicts upon my body, condemn 
my tongue to your silence, and my reputation to re-
proach.? Your executioner may abridge the period of 
my existence, but while I 
exist I 
shall not forbear to 
vindicate my character and my motives from your as-
persions; and as a 
man, to whom fame is dearer than 
life, I 
will make the last use of that life in doing jus-
tice to that reputation which is to live after me, and 
wiii3h is the only legacy I 
can leave to those I 
honor 
aal love, and for whom I 
am proud to perish. 
As men, my Lords' we must appear on the great 
day at one C3.11I110a tribunal, and it will then remain 
for the Searcher of all hearts to show a 
collective uni-
verse, who was engaged in the most virtuous actions 
or actuated by the purest motive—my country's op-
pressor's, or— 
(tisrah 
was again intetrupted, and told to listen to the sentence 
of th law. 
My Lords, will a dying man be denied the legal 
privilege of exculpating himself in the eyes of the 
community, of an undeserved reproach thrown upon 
him during the trial by charging him with ambition, 
and attempting to east away, for a 
paltry consider-
ation, the liberties of hi3 country? Why did your 
Lordships insult me? or rather, why insultjustice, in 
de:winding of in; why sentence of death should not 
be pronounced against me? I 
know' my Lord, that 
form prescribes that you should ask the question— 
the form also implies the right of answering. 
This, 
no doubt, may be dispensed with, and so might the - 
whale ceremony of the trial, since sentence was al-
ready pronounced at the Castle, before your jury was 
empannelled. 
Your Lordships are but the .priests of 
the Oracle, and I 
submit—but I 
insist on the*whoIe 
of the forms. 
Mr, Emmet paused., and the 0Ourt deslred him to proceed.)

EMMET'S SPEECH. 
I am charged with being an emissary of France. 
An emissary of France! and for what end? 
It is al-
leged that I 
wish to sell the independence of my 
coun-
try! and for what end? Was this the object of my 
ambition? and is this the mode by which a 
tribunal 
of justice reconciles contradictions? No! I am no 
emissary; and my ambition was to hold a 
place among 
the deliverers of my country—not in power, nor in 
profit, but in the glory of the achievement. 
Sell my 
country's independence to France! and for what.; 
Was it for a 
change of masters? 
No, but for ambi-
tion. 
0, my country! was it personal ambition that 
could influence me? Had it been the soul of my 
actions, could I 
not, by my education and fortune— 
by the rank and consideration of my family, have 
placed myself amongst the proudest of my country's 
oppressors? 
My country was my idol; to it I 
sacri-
ficed every selfish, every endearing sentiment—and 
for it I 
now offer up my life. 
Oh, God! No My 
Lord; I 
acted as an Irishman, determined on deliver-
ing my country from the yoke of a 
foreign and unre-
lenting tyranny, and the more galling yoke of a 
do-
mestic faction, which is its joint partner and perpe-
trator in the parricide, for the ignominy of existing 
with an exterior of splendor and a 
conscious deprav-
ity; it was the wish of my heart to extricate my coun-
try from'this doubly rivetted despotism. 
I 
wished to 
place her independence beyond the reach of any pow-
er on earth—I 
wished to exalt her to that proud sta-
tion in the world. 
Connection with France was indeed intended, but 
only as far as mutual interest would sanction or re-
quire: 
Were they to assume any authority inconsist-
ent with the purest independence, it would be the sig-
nal for their destruction; we sought aid, and we 
sought it as if we had assurance we should obtain it 
—as auxiliaries in war and allies in peace. 
Were the French to come as invaders or enemies, 
uninvited by the wishes of the people, I 
should op-
pose them to the utmost of my strength. 
Yes, my 
countrymen, I 
would meet them on the beach with a 
EMME1"S SPEECH. 
sword in one hand and a 
torch in the other; I 
would 
meet them with all the destructive fury of war, and I 
would animate my countrymen to immolate them in 
their boats, before they had contaminated the soil of 
my country. If they succeeded in landing, and if forced 
to retire before superior discipline, I would dispute 
every inch of ground, burn every blade of grass be-
fore them, and the last entrenchment of liberty should 
be my grave. 
What I 
could not do myself, if I 
should 
fall, I 
would leave as a 
last charge to my countrymen 
to accomplish, because I 
should feel conscious that 
life, any more than death, is profitable when a for-
eign nation holds my country in subjection. 
But it was not as an enemy that the succours of 
France were to land. 
I looked indeed for the as-
sistance of France , but I 
wished to prove to France 
and to all the world, that Irishman deserved to be 
assisted; that they were indignant at slavery, and 
ready to assert the independence and liberty of their 
country. 
I 
wished to procure for my country the guarantee 
which Washington procured for America. 
To pro-
cure an aid which, by its example, would be as un-
portant as its valor—disciplined, gallant, pregnant 
with science and experience, who would preserve the 
good, and polish the rough points of our character; 
they wont.] conic to us as strangers and leave us as 
friends, after sharing our perils and elevating our des-
tiny. 
These were my objects—not to receive new 
task-makers, but to expel old tyrants; these were my 
views, and these only became Irishmen. 
It was for 
these ends I 
sought aid from France, because France, 
even as an enemy, could not be more implacable than 
the enemy already in the bosom of my country. 
(Here he was again interrupted by the court.) 
I 
have been charged with that importance in the 
efforts to emancipate my country, as to be considered 
the keystone of the combination of Irishmen, or as 
your lordship expressed it, ' the life and blood of the 
conspiracy.' You do me honor over much, you have 
given to the subaltern all the credit of a 
superior. 
EMMET'S SPEECH. 
There are engaged in this conspiracy, who are not 
only superior to me, but even to your own conception 
of yourself, my Lord, before the splendor of whose 
genius and virtues I 
should bow with respectful def-
erence, and who would think themselves dishonored 
to be called your friend, and who would not disgrace 
themselves by shaking your blood-stained hand. 
(Here he was again interrupted.) 
What, my Lord! shall you tell me on the passage 
to that scaffold, which that tyranny (of which you 
are only the intermediary executioner) has erected 
for my murder, that I am accountable for all the 
blood that has and will be shed in this struggle of the 
oppressed against the oppressor—shall you tell me 
this, and shall I 
be so very a 
slave as not to repel it? 
I 
do not fear to approach the Omnipotent Judge, 
to answer for the conduct of my whole life, and am I 
to be appalled and falsified by a mere remnant of 
mortality here! 
By you, too, who, if it were possi-
ble to collect all the innocent blood that you have 
caused to be shed in your unhallowed ministry, into 
one great reservoir, your Lordship might swim in it. 
(Here the Judge interfered.) 
Let no man dare, when I 
am dead, to charge me 
with dishonor. 
Let no man attaint my memory by 
believing that I 
could have engaged in any cause but 
of my country, liberty and independence, or that I 
became the pliant minion of power, in the oppression 
or the miseries of my countrymen. 
The prochonation 
of the Provisional Government speaks for our views; 
no inference can be tortured from it to countenance 
barbarity or debasement at home, or subjection, hu-
miliation, or treachery from abroad; I would not 
have submitted to a 
foreign oppressor, for the same 
reason that I 
would resist the present domestic op-
pressor. 
In the dignity of freedom, I would have 
fought on the threshold of my country, and its ene-
my should only enter by passing over my lifeless 
corpse. 
And am I, who lived but for my country, 
and who have subjected myself to the dangers of the 
jealous and watchful oppressor, and the bondage of

the grave, only to give my countrymen their rights 
and my country her independence—am I 
to be load-
ed with calumny, and not suffered to resent or repel 
it? 
No, God forbid! 
(Here Lord Norbury told Mr. Emmet that his sentiments and Ian-
page disgraced his family and education, but more particularly his 
tither, Dr. Eauna4, who was a 
man, if alive, that would not coun-
tenanc3 such opinions. 
If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in 
the concerns and cares of those who are dear to them 
in this transitory life- 0, ever dear and venerated 
shade of my departed Father, look down with scru-
tiny upon the conduct of your suffering son, and see 
if I 
have ever for a 
moment, deviated from those prin-
ciples of morality and patriotism which it was your 
care to instil into my youthful mind, and for which I 
am now to offer up my life. 
My Lord, you are impatient for the sacrifice—the 
blood which you seek is mit congealed by the arti-
ficial terrors that surround your victim; it circulates 
warmly and unruffled through the channels which 
God created for a 
nobler purpose, but which you are 
bent to destroy, for purposes so grievous that they 
cry to heaven! 
Be ye patient. 
I have but a 
few 
more words to say. 
I 
am going to my cold and silent 
grave; my lamp of life 
is 
nearly extinguished; my 
race is run; the grave opens to receive me, and I 
sink 
into its bosom. 
I 
have but one request to ask • at my 
departure from this world; it is the charity of its si-
lence. 
Let no man write my epitaph, for as no man 
who knows my motives dare now vindicate them, let 
not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. 
Let them 
and me repose in obscurity and peace, and my tomb 
remain uninscribed, until other times, and other Men 
can do justice to my character. . When my country 
takes her place among the nations of the earth—.-then 
and not till then—let my epitaph be written. 
I ;LANE 
DONE. 
One day, previous to Emmet's trial, as the govern-
or was going his rounds, he entered Emmet's room 
rather abruptly, and observing a 
remarkable expres-

sion in his countenance, he apologized for the inter-
ruption. 
He had a 
fork fixed to his little deal table, 
anJ appended to it there was a 
tress of hair, ' You 
see,' said he to the keeper, ' how innocently I 
have 
been occupied; this little tress has been long dear to 
me, and I 
am plaiting it to wear in my bosom on the 
day of my execution.' 
On the day of that fatal event 
there was found, sketched by his own hand with a 
pen and ink, upon that very table, an admirable like-
ness of himself, the head severed from the body which 
lay near it, surrounded by the scaffold, the axe and 
all the paraphernalia of a high treason execution. 
What a 
strange union of tenderness, enthusiasm and 
fortitude do not thejabove traits of character exhibit. 
His fortitude, indeed never forsook him; on the 
night previous to his death, he slept as soundly 
as ever; 
and when the 
fatal morning dawned, 
he 
arose, knelt down • and prayed, ordered some 
milk, which 
he 
drank, wrote two 
letters, 
and 
then desired the sheriffs to be informed that he was 
ready. 
When they came to his room, he said he had 
two requests to make: one that his arms might be 
left as loose as possible, which was humanely acceded 
to. ' I 
make the other,' said he, 
not under any idea 
that it can be granted, but that it may be held in 
remembrance that I have made it; it is, that I may 
be permitted to die in my green uniform.' 
This, of 
course, was not allowed him—and the request seemed 
to have no other object than to show that he gloried 
in the cause for which he had to suffer. 
"Whether on the scaffold high, 
Or in the battle's van, 
The noblest place for man to die 
Is where he dies for man."

HOW TO BEAUTIFY HOME! 
THERE has as yet been nothing in the way of feminine pastime 
introduced so elegant and entertaining as the " BERLIN PERFORA-
TED-BOARD PATTERNS" now offered to the public. Among the 
points to reccommend these patterns to favorable attention are that 
they exquisitely combine the ornamental and the useful and spice 
the recreation which they afford with a 
pleasureable tasking of the 
imagination and ingenuity of the embroiderer. 
Through them the 
worker can enjoy the pleasureable pride of seeing her home embel-
lished by " things of beauty "—the product of her own hands, or of 
delighting her friends by presents which, however me- ensive, are 
delicate and acceptable. 
The designs are ingenius and correct, and 
the pieces when embroidered and cut, fit to a 
charm. The colors are 
brilliant and artistically contrasted. 
These, however, are simply 
iggestive as innumeraole variations will occur to the fancy in the 
coulee of working, and thus every taste can be suited. 
The patterns are put up in large quarto packages, each containing 
beautifully printed designs for three elegant and useful articles and 
sold for — le low price of e3 cents each package.
