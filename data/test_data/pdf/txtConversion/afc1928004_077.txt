TO HARRY TUCKER. 
Oh thou whose ballads touch the heart, 
Sweet-flowing as the lark's clear song! 
Whose every tone doth joy impart— 
To thee our love and praise belong. 
When " cruel war" swept o'er the land, 
Thy gentle strains e'en then could cheer; 
Those chords, struck by a 
master-hand, 
Still echo in the sigh and Lear. 
'Twos thine to move with magic power, 
And waken thoughts we deemed as dead; 
And, all entranced, in fairy bower 
The blissful laden moments fled. 
The maid, at eve, ha,s fixed her eyes 
Upon the ' star-lit' skies above her, 
And thy sweet song has checked her sighs, 
And brought her near an absent lover. 
The soldier on th' ensang,uined field, 
Amidst the wounded and the slain, 
Beneath the moon, in awe has kneeled, 
And prayed that they might meet again. 
Sweet singer !—let the wreath beddaced, -% 
E'er to keep green, upon thy brew I— 
And of the number it has graced, 
None are more worthy than art thou-,

A 
[HENRY TECUER ,—TIIE COMPOSER. 
Otir readers will thank us for giving a 
slight sketch of one who has fet 
many years cent ributed to their pleasure by the medium of his exquisita 
ciono.s 
and ballads. 
Henry Tucker is a 
self made man in every respect 
1i€, is a 
native of Cayug,a Co., State of New York,u County, by the by, 
which has given birth to many remarkable men. At an early age 1110 
subject of this sketch developed decided musical talents. 
Ills first 
3ong—" The Forest Queen,' appeared in 142, after which Caine 
" 
Agnes May," and " Star of the Evening." All of these songs were 
successful, and then followed a delicious tide of pure and beautiful 
melodies, that culminated in that outbreak of a 
Nation's hopes and 
iioars—the universally popular, " When this cruel war is over.' 
As far 
• 
as popularity and simplicity and correctness of style are concerned, 
Henry Tucker stands to-day highest among- our native composers. In 
character he is a 
kind, genial gentleman—the idol of his many friends. 
His name is a synonym of all that is agreeable in social intercourse. 
In fact, Jicury Tucker —with story—is a. popular saying in New York 
circles. 
His latest composition, ' Sweet Genevieve,' shows that his 
Lyre has not yet lost its wonderons charm. He is at present engaged 
in editing a 
series of popular Music for R. M. DeWitt. To use an 
Arabic expression, may Henry Tucker's " shadow never grow less," 
but may the world still be charmed by his heart-moving molodieS. j 
0, Genevieve, I'd give the world, 
To live again the lovely past; 
The rose of youth was dew impearl'd, , 
lint now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy face in every. dream, 
My waking thoughts are full of thee; 
Thy glance is in the starry beam, 
That falls along the summer sea. 
CHORUS. 
0 Genevieve, sweet Genevieve, 
The days may come, the days may go ; 
But still the hands of inem'ry weave, 
The blissful dream of long ago. 0, Genevieve! 
Pair Genevieve, my early love, 
The years but make thee dearer far, 
My heart shall never, never rove. 
Thou art my only guiding star, 
For me the past has no regret, 
W hat e'er.the years may bring to rue, 
I 
bless the hour when first we met, 
The hour that gave Inc love and thee. 
0, Genevieve, & c. 
ANNIE LISLE. 
Down where the waving willows 
'Neath the sunbeams smile; 
Shadowed o'er the murm'ring waters, 
Dwelt sweet Annie Lisle; 
Pure as the forest lily, 
Never thought of guile 
Had its home within the bosom, 
Of loved Annie Lisle. 
CHORUS. 
Wave willows, murmur water, 
Golden sunbeam smile— 
Earthly music cannot waken, 
Lovely Annie Lisle. 
Sweet came the hallowed chiming 
Of the Sabbath bell, 
Borne on the morning breezes, 
Down the woody dell; 
On a 
bed of anguish— 
Lay dear Annie Lisle; 
Changed were the lovely features, 
Gone the happy smile. [Wave willows, &c. 
Toll bels of Sabbath morning, 
I 
shall never more, 
Hear your sweet and holy music, 
On this earthly shore. 
Forms clad in heav'nly beauty, 
Look on me and smile; 
Waiting for the longing spirit, 
Of your Annie Lisle. [Wave willows, &e. 
Raise me in 11011r arms, dear mother, 
Let me once more look 
On the green and waving 
And the flO'Fillg brook— 
Hark, those strains of angel music, 
From the choir above; 
Dearest Mother, I 
am going, 
Truly: " God is love." 
aye willows, &c. 
BONNY 
ELOISE, THE BELLE OF THE MOHAWK 
VALE 
Sweet is the vale where the Mohawk gently glides, 
On the clear winding way to the sea, 
And dearer than all storied streams on earth besides, 
Is this bright rolling river to me. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the scenes of my boyliodd's sunny hour, 
That bespangle the gay valley o'er, 
And dear are the friends seen thro' memory's fond tears, 
That have lived in the blest days of yore. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the moments when dream;ng I 
roam, 
Through my loved haunts now mossy and grey, 
And dearer than all is my childhood's hallowed home, 
That is crumbling now slowly away. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale.

BEAUTIFUL LEAVES. 
Beautiful leaves in their midsummer splendor, 
Clothing the forest in emerald green— 
Where are the blooms that such beauty can render, 
or spread such a 
fullness or grace o'er the scene? 
Every gay tint of the sweet garden flowers, • 
Every bright garland that innocence weaves ; 
Though culled from the fairest of nature's gay bowers, 
Looks cold, if not blended with beautiful leaves. 
Beautiful leaves in the Winter time falling. 
Oft have I 
thought, as they dropped One by one, 
That they were obeying some mystical calling. 
That lured them away when the Summer was gone. 
And knowing the Spring will their brightness restore us, 
1 
have thought as the cold earth their ashes receives, 
That we too must fade, like the dead leaves before 0, 
And bloom once again, like those beautiful leaves. 
THE MAN WHO CAN'T KEEP STILL. 
Since the days when I 
was a 
little child„ 
I've heard my mother say. 
There was nothing ever would keep me still, 
By night or yet by day. 
I'm a 
man grown up, but it's all the same, 
For, do whatever I 
will. 
'Tis a 
fact that, whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't keep still. 
I 
really, 
When at school, they sat me on a 
chair; 
My feet went tap, tap, tap: 
When I 
said my task, I 
was jig, jig, jig, 
'Till oft I. got the strap, 
If I 
went to church it was all the same, 
Tho' seated in a 
pew— 
I 
was safe, before all the prayers were done, 
To dance a 
step or two. 
I 
really, 
Then a 
shop I 
had, but upon my word, 
When customers came in. 
Why I 
jigg'd away and said, " What's for- you ?" 
While they stood all a 
grin. 
But the end soon came, and the shop was shut, 
The landlord seized for rent— 
When the brokers came and they sold my goods, 
Why, dancing out I 
went. 
I 
really, cte 
IIRIGHT-EYED LITTLE NELL 
OF NARRAGANSET-BAY. 
Full well do I 
remember my boyhood's happy hours, 
The cottage and the garden, where bloom'd the fairest flowers. 
The bright and sparkling water o'er which we used to sail, 
With hearts so gay, for miles away, before the gentle gale. 
I 
had a 
dear companion, but she's not with me now; 
The lily of the valley is waving o'er her brow; 
And I 
am sad and lonely, and mourning all the day 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narraganset-Bay. 
Toll, toll the bell, at early dawn of day, 
For lovely Nell so quickly passed away; 
Toll, toll the bell, a 
soft and mournful lay, 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narra,ganset-Bay. 
I 
loved the littlo beauty, my boat it was my pride, 
And with her close beside me, what joy the foam to ride! 
She'd laugh in tones so merry, to see the waves go by, 
As wildly blew the -stormy wind, and murky was the sky; 
Though lightnings flash around us, and all was dark and dream-, 
We loved to brave Old Ocean, and never dreamed of fear, 
The Arrow bounded onward and darted through the spray, 
With bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narraganset-Bay. 
Toll, toll the bell, o&c. 
One day, ron-1 us she wander'd, and soon, within the boat, 
The cord was quickly loosen'd and, with the tide afloat; 
The treacherous bark flew lightly and swift before the wind, 
While home, and friends, and all so dear were many miles behind 
Next day, her form, all lifeless, was washed upon the beach, 
I 
stood and gazed upon it, bereft of sense and speech. 
'Tis years since thus we parted. but here I 
weep to-day 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narrap;anset-flay; 
Toll, toll the bell, ,

BEN BOLT. 
Oh! don't you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt, 
Sweet Alice, with eyes hazel brown, 
How she wept with delight when you gave her a 
smile, 
And trembled with fear at your frown. 
In the old churchyard, in the valley, Ben I3olt, 
In a 
corner obscure and alone ; 
They have fitted a 
slab of granite 80 gray, 
And skeet Alice lies under the stone. 
Oh ! don't you remember the wood, Ben Bolt, 
Near the green sunny slope of the hill, 
Where oft we have sung, 'neath its wide spreading shade, 
And kept time to the click of the mill. 
The mill has gone to decay, Ben Bolt, 
And a 
quiet now reigns all around; 
See the old rustic porch, with its roses so sweet, 
Lies scattered all over the ground. 
Oh 1 
don't you remember the school, Ben Bolt, 
And the master so kind and true; 
And the little nook, by the dear running brook, 
Where we gathered the flowers as they grew. 
O'er the master's grave grows the grass, Ben Bolt, 
And the clear running brook is now dry; 
And of all our old friends, who were schoolmates, then, 
There remains, Ben, but you and I. 
I HAVE TRIED NOT TO LOVE TREE.. 
I 
have tried not to love thee, 
To drive from my heart 
Each sweet recollection, 
With which I 
should part: 
The one gleam of sunshine, 
My life has ever known, 
Thy smile, and the music 
Thy voice made alone. 
I've tried not to love thee, 
To drive from my heart 
Each sweet recollection, 
With which I 
should part. 
I 
may never more see thee, 
And hope may depart: 
But why should I 
banish 
Thy love from my heart ? 
'Tis all that you've left me, 
The old golden beam 
Of light to illumine 
Life's future dark stream. 
I've tried not to love thee, cie. 
THE GLORIOUS VINTAGE OF CHAMPAGNE. 
Words by EDMUND FALcoNza. 
Musie by M. W. BALI% 
When fortune frowns and friends forsake, 
And faith in love is dead; 
When man has nothing left to stake, 
To hope, nor yet to dread, 
One god-like pleasure doth remain, 
Worth all the joys he's lost— 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
To drink at some knave's cost. 
CHORUS. 
Let life's last song have for refrain, 
The glorious vintage of champagne. 
When one by one fade all the beams, 
That light morning's path, 
So dull the world around us seems, 
At life itself we're wrath. 
New vigour then would we regain, 
Let's drink at some knave's cost, 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
Worth all the joys we've lost. 
Let life's last song, &c. 
BEAUTIFUL VENICE. 
Beautiful Venice! City of song! 
What mem'ries of old to thy regio'is belong 
What sweet recollections still cling to my heart. 
As thy fast-fading shores from my vision depart! 
Oh I 
poesy's home is thy light colonades, 
Where the wind gently sigh as the sweet twilight fades ! 
CIIORITS. 
I 
have known many homes, but the dwelling for me, 
Is beautiful Venice, the bride of the sea! 
11autiful Venice! queen of the earth ! 
Where dark eyes shine brightly ' mid music and mirth, 
Where gay serenaders, by light of the star, 
Oft mingle their song with the dulcet guitar: 
All that's lovely in life, all that's deathless in song, 
Fair Italy's Isle I 
to thy regions belong 
I 
have known many homes, cte.

Childhood's days now pass before nw.. 
Forms and scenes of long ago;

Days that knew no shade of sorrow,

Round the old and rustic door, 
And, below, the white beach shining, 
Where I

Hears my Mother's gentle warning, 
As she took me on her knee; 
And I 
feel again life's morning, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
In the cottage, (izo 
What though years have rolled above me, 
Though 'mid fairer scenes .I 
roam, 
Yet I 
ne'er shall cease to love thee, 
Childhood's dear and happy home!

Oh! how Pleasant would it be, 
On some faithful breast reposing,

compass to steer by---a 
dag2er to draw; 
And ne'er as a 
e. ,ward or slave will I 
kneel, 
While my guns carry shot, or my belt bears a 
steel. 
Quick ! quick ! trim her sail, let the sheet kiss the wind, 
And I'll warraut we'll 80011 leave the seagulls behind; 
Up, up with my flag, let it float o'er the sea, 
l'm afloat, I'm afloat, and the Rover is free! 
The night gathers o'er us, the thunder is heard, 
What matter? our vessel skims on li! e 
a 
bird ; 
What to her is the dash of the storm-ridden main, 
She has braved it before and will brave it again. 
The fire-gleaming flashes around us.may fall--
They may strike, they may grieve, but they cannot appal ; 
With lightning above us, and darkness below, 
Through the wild waste of waters right onward we go. 
Hurrah I 
my brave comrades, ye may drink, ye may sleep, 
The storm fiend is hushed, we're alone on the deep ; 
Our flag of cefi . nce still waves o'er the sea,. 
I'm afloat, I'm afloat, and the Rover is free! 
CARRIE LEE. 
They made her a 
grave in the wild wood shade 
Where the trees gently wave in the bloom, 
Where the wild birds sing, and the soft SI1111111CT air 
Wafts seas of melodies o'er her tomb. 
"Es there little Carrie Lee lies sleeping in death 
The pride of the village was she; 
There many friends, in their gloom, 
Sadly weep o'er the grave of our own Carrie Lee. 
CHORUS. 
Then sleep, let her sleep in the grave we have made ; 
From the cares of the world she issfree ; 
Then weep, let us weep, while the tall willows wave 
O'er the grave of our own Carrie Lee. 
They made her a 
grave in the wild wood shade, 
Where the violets now bloom in the green, 
Where naught is heard but the warbling of birds, 
And the noise of the habblitig brook. 
No more her sweet voice can re-echo again, 
No more her sweet smile can be seen ; 
But, all hushed now in death, she has gone to her rest, 
In Heaven dwells o .r 
own Carrie Lee. 
Then sleep, &c

DEAR MOTHER I'VE COME TO DIE. 
Words by E. BOWERS. 
MUSIC 
by HENRY TUCKER-
Dear Mother, I 
remember well 
The parting kiss you gave to me, 
When merry rang the village bell; 
My heart was full of joy and glee; 
I 
did not dream that one short year, 
Would crush the hopes that soar'd so high! 
Oh! Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
CHORUS. 
Call sister, brother, to'my side, 
And take your Soldier's last Good-bye, 
Oh! Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
Hark! Mother, 'tis the village bell, 
I 
can no longer with you stay: 
My Country calls, to arms! to arms! 
The foe advance in fierce array! 
The vision's past, I 
feel that now, 
For Country I 
can only sigh; 
Oh! Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
Call sister, brother, &(.. 
Dear Mother, Sister, Brother, all, 
One parting kiss to all: Good-bye! 
Weep not! but clasp your band itimine, 
And let me like a 
soldier die! 
I've met the foe upon the field, 
Where kindred fiercely did defy, 
I 
fought for right, God bless the Flag! 
Dear, Mother I've come home to die ! 
Call sister, brother, &e,

ENOCH ARDEN. 
Cheer up, Annie darling, with hopeful emotion, 
To-morrow our parting must be; 
I'll sail the seas over, I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll sail the seas over for thee; 
I'll not forget thee, oh I 
never, no never! 
I 
cannot forget thee, I 
know: 
Thy smile, like a 
phantom, will haunt me forever. 
And cheer me where'er I 
may go.

Good-by, Annie, darling 
I'll sail o'er the sea, 
I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll cross the wide ocean for thee. 
I

I 
go for thy sake far away, 
Then bid, me good-bye, with a 
smile on the morrow, 
And cheer me with blessings I 
pray. 
think of thee ever, and pray for thee, 
As over the waters I 
roam ; 
I'll tarry not darling, and leave thee all lonely, 
But hasten again to my home. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, &c. 
Out, out on the ocean, away o'er the billow, 
My heart on its purpose intent, 
My brow shall find rest, when I 
seek my lone pillow, 
In knowing that thou art content. 
Cheer up, Annie, darling, break off from thy sorrow: 
'Tis sad that our parting must be: 
But give me thy smile, when I 
leave thee, to-morrow, 
To sail the seas over for thee. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, itc. 
ERIN IS MY HOME. 
Oh, I 
have roamed in many lands 
And many friends I've met; 
Not one fair scene or kindly smile 
Can this fond heart forget; 
But 
confess that I'm content, 
No more I 
wish to roam ; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's isle,— 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, &e. 
If England were my place of birth, 
I'd love her tranquil shore; 
But if Columbia were my home, 
Tier freedom I'd adore. 
The' pleasant days in both I 
passed,

dream of days to come; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, Rm. 
THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA'S IIALLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls, 
As if that soul were fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright, 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives, 
Is when some heart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives,

She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sings her wild songs to the murmuring sea, 
She'll dance on the sand where the fisherman stands, 
And join in the music of a

She sits in her boat and sings o'er the billow, 
And flirts with the spray like a

She laughs at the winds whose revels are music, 
And beats to the time with the stroke of her scull.-

Words and Music by CLARIBEL. 
The dew lay glittering o'er the grass, 
A 
mist lay over the brook, 
At the earliest beam of the golden sun, 
The swallow her nest forsook. 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorn tree, 
Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning k'ssed her brow, 
And p!ayed with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his Fey the, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers came, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And 2s he lingered by her side, 
Despite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story was told aga n, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
THE 1111.1 PS WARNING. 
Trust him not, 0 
Gentle Lady, 
Though his voice be low and sweet, 
heed not him who kneels before thee, 
Softly pleading at thy feet. 
Now thy life is in its morning: 
Cloud not this thy happy lot. 
Listen to the G-ipsy's warning, 
Gentle Lady, trust him not. 
Lady, once there lived a 
maiden, 
Young and pure, and like thee fair: 
Yet, he wooed, he wooed, and own her, 
Thrilled her gentle heart with care. 
Then he heeded not her weeping, 
He cared not her life to save! 
Soon she perished—DOW she's sleeping 
In the cold and silent grave 
Lady, turn not from me so coldly; 
For, I 
have only told the truth, 
From a 
stern and withering sorrow, 
Lady I 
would shield thy youth. 
I 
would shield thee from all danger, 
Shield thee from the Tempter's snare; 
Lady, shun the dark-eyed stranger, 
I 
have warned thee—now beware. 
Take your gold, I 
do not want it, 
Lady, I 
have prayed for this, 
For the hour that I 
might foil him, 
And rob him of expected bliss. 
Aye, I 
see thou art filled with wonder 
At my look so fierce and wild, 
Lady in the church-yard yonder, 
Sleeps the Gipsy's only child. 
GOOD NEWS FROM HOME. 
Good news from home—good news for me, 
has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears— 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted long ago, 
My life has been a 
scene of woe, 
But now a 
joyful hour has come, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
CHORUS. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
No father's near to guide me now, 
No mother's tear to soothe my brow, 
No sister's voice falls on my ear, 
Nor brother's smile to give me cheer. 
But, though I 
wander far away, 
My heart is full of joy to-day, 
For friends across the ocean's foam 
have sent to me, good news from home. 
Good news from home, etc. 
When shall I 
see that cottage door, 
Where I've spent years of joy before? 
'Twits there I 
knew no grief or care, 
My heart was always happy there. 
Though I 
may never see it more, 
Nor stand upon my native shore, 
Where'er on earth I'm doomed to roam, 
My heart will be with those at home.

[As sung by M ISS PAULINE M ARKHAM.] 
Words and Music by LAIINOE LENNOX. 
tu n,8tupid, bashful thing,

ti-ty—ti-ty trem-ble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing 
Such a 
multitude assemble ! 
0, pray don't, or I 
wont 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me ! 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make me ninny- ninny-ninny nervous. 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying " Heaven Preserve us!" 
How they stare, I 
declare, 
I 
at once get red as any peony; 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
If I 
only had a 
friend 
Like a 
bibby-bibby—brother, 
Telling me my faults to mend 
Anethis silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man 
Who believes in love that is platonical, 
imight get courage yet, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing.

My boat is on the shore, and my bark is on the sea; 
But before I

Here's a 
double health to thee. 
Here's a 
sigh for those that love, and a 
smile for those who

And whatever sky's above, here's a 
heart for every fate. 
Tito' the ocean roars around me, yet it still shall bear me on ; 
Tho' a 
desert shall surround me, it hath springs that may be 
won. 
Wer't the last drop in the well, as I 
gasp upon the brink, 
Ere my sinking spirits fell, ' tis to thee that I 
would drink. 
ln this water as this wine, the libations I 
would pour, 
Should be peace to thee and thine, and a 
health to thee, Toni

A 
health to thee, a

KATTY AVOUR]EEN. 
'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the tempest was snarlin', 
The snow like a 
sheet covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney new over the hills to his darlin', 
And tapped at the window where Katty did lie. 
" 
Arrah, jewel," said he, are ye sleepin' or wakin' 
The night's bitter cold, an' my coat it is thin ; 
Oh, the storm ' tis a 
brewin', the frost it is bakin', 
Oh, Katty Avourneen, you must let me in. 
Arrah, BArney, cried she, and she spoke thro' the window, 
Ah, would ye be takin' me out of my bed ? 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too; 
It's whiskey, not love, that's got into your head. 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be tender; 
Consider the time and there's nobody in, 
Oh, what has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her; 
No, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in. 
Ah, cushla, cried he, it's my heart is a 
fountain 
That weeps for the wrong I 
might lay at your door; 
Your name is more white than the snow on the mountain 
And Barney would die to preserve it as pure; 
I'll go to my home, though the winter winds face me, 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within; 
An' the words of my Kathleen will comfort and bless me: 
Oh, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in 
HER BRIGHT SMILE HAUNTS ME STILL. 
'Tis years since last we met, and we may not meet again ; 
I 
have struggled to forget, but that struggle was in vain. 
For, her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at will ; 
In the midnight on th, 
her bright smile haunts me still. 
At the first sweet dawn of light, when I 
gaze upon the deep. 
Her form still greets my sight, while the stars their vigils 
keep. 
When I 
close mine aching eyes, sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And, from sleep when I 
arise, her bright smile haunts me still. 
I 
have sailed 'neath alien skies, I 
have trod the desert path; 
I 
have seen the storm arise like a 
giant in his wrath. 
Every danger I 
have known, that a 
reckless life can fill ; 
Yet her presence is not flown, her bright smile haunts me still,

I'll LONELY TO-NIGHT. 
Words and Music by G. W. H . 
G RIFFEN. 
I 
am lonely to-night, in my sad little chamber, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear : 
They are gone from their home with the bold fearless ranger, 
There's a 
void in my heart; for, they are not here. 
Oh! why did they leave me alone and deserted, 
To risk their dear lives on the blood-sprinkled plain! 
Should they never return, this poor heart will soon wither, 
And never know joy or comfort again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am lonely to-night, I 
am lonely to-night, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear i 
I

I 
am lonely to-
night, but ere Spring-birds shall warble 
Their matinal song in the wild forest-tree, 
And the bright limpid brook with sweet music shall babble 
My heart will grow lighter, while thinking of thee! 
Then fleet by dull hours, and, bring back the loved ones, 
Who parted from frio

with a 
tear moistened eye; 
For, then, this sad heart; will no longer be lonely, 
But joyous and happy as the mild, azure sky.

rD OFFER THEE THIS HAND OF MINE. 
Music by L. Thayer Chadwick. 
I'd offer thee this hand of mine, 
If I 
could love thee less, 
But hearts as warm and pure as thine 
Should never know distress; 
My fortune is too hard for thee, 
'Twould chill thy dearest joy, 
I'd rather weep to see thee free, 
Than win thee to destroy. 
I'd offer thee, &e. 
I 
leave thee to thy happiness, 
As one too dear to love, 
As one I 
think of but to bless, 
As wretchedly I 
rove; 
But oh, when sorrow's cup I 
drink, 
All bitter though it be, 
how sweet 'twill be for me to think, 
It holds no drop for thee. 
l'cl offer thee, &c. 
And now my dreams are sadly o'er, 
Fate bids them all depart, 
And I 
must leave my native shore, 
In brokenness of heart; 
Then oh, dear one, when far from thee, 
I 
ne'er know joy again, 
I 
would not that one thought of me 
Should give thy bosom pain. 
I'd offer thee, &c.

I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT, BUT 
THEY DO. 
Words by LAURA T. 
Music by II ENRY TUCICRR. 
As I 
look round about, my head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see the world so greatly changed since I 
was but a 
girl; 
Old notions out of date they're all made over now— 
And yet, I'm sure, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! times are changed about, and everything is new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do; 
Yes, times are changed about, and everything is new— 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do. 
Men used to live upon what honestly they made, 
But now they rather seem to live upon their debts unpaid; 
In style they swell about their creditors in view— 
It puzzles me, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh ! times are changed, ttc. 
Once on a 
time young men were steady and upright, 
Iii " sporting." now they spend their time, and in it take 
delight; 
They drive about fast teams, on governor's money, too— 
It 
shocks me quite, I 
don't know how the,y do it, but they do. 
Oh 
times are changed, &c. 
Young ladies now are not like those I 
used to know, 
When I 
was young we waited till sought after by a 
beau ; 
But now things are reversed, they're going all askew— 
The girls propose I 
I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh I 
times ake changed, &c.

I'LL HANG TilY HARP ON A WILLOW TREE. 
Words by T. HAVES BAYLY. 
Music by W . 
GURRNSEY. 
I'LL hang my harp on a 
willow tree, 
I'll off to the wars again ; 
My peaceful home has no charms for me, 
The battle-field no pain. 
The lady I 
love will soon be a 
bride, 
With a 
diadem on her brow, 
Oh why did she flatter my boyish pride ? 
She's going to leave me now. 
She took me away from my warlike lord, 
And gave me a 
silken suit, 
I 
thought no more of my master's sword, 
When I 
played on my master's lute, 
She seemed to think me a 
boy above, 
her pages of low degree, 
Oh! had I 
but loved with a 
boyish love, 
It would have been better for me. 
Then I'll hide in my breast every selfish care, 
I'll flush my pale cheek with wine, 
When smiles awake the bridal pair, 
I'll hasten to give them mine. 
I'll laugh and I'll sing, though my heart may bleed, 
And I'll walk in the festive train ; 
And if I 
survive it I'll mount my steed, 
And off to the wars again. 
But one golden tress of her hair 
twine, 
In my helmet's sable plume, 
And then, on the field of Palestine, 
I'll seek an early doom: 
And if by the Saracen's hand I 
fall, 
'Mid the noble and the brave, 
A 
tear from my lady-love is all, 
I 
ask for the warrior s'grave.

I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE.—(coricLuDED) 
Last week my little wife and 
Went for a 
country walk, 
And when we reached a 
pleasant nook, 
We sat down for a 
talk. 
My arms around her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life. 
I 
turned and saw a 
gaping crowd, 
Who yelled—" I'll tell your wife I" 
I'll tell your wife, &a. 
I 
hear it in the noisy street, 
And in the quiet square, 
I 
hear its murmur in the shell, 
In short '
fig everywhere. 
That dreadful cry is killing me, 
It's causing fearful strife. 
What, Mr. Jenkins, did you say ? 
He says, " I'll tell your wife." 
Ill tell your wife, ac. 
HARD TIMES COME AGAIN NO FIORE. 
Let us pause in life's pleasure and . count its many tears

" 
Oh I 
Hard Times come again no MOM."

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary; 
" 
Hard Times, Hard Times come again, no more 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
While we seek mirth and music, and music light and gay, 
There are frail forms faintiug at the door ; 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say. 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc. 
There's a 
pale, drooping maiden, who toils her life away, 
With a 
worn heart whose better days are o'er; 
Though her voice would be merry, ' tis sighing all the day— 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc.

I KNOW MY MOTHER'S HAND. 
W ords by W . 
DEXTER. SMITH, JR. 
USIC by HENRY TUCKER. 
In one of our late battles a 
young lieutenant had his right 
foot so shattered by a 
fragment of a 
shell that, on reaching 
Washington after one of those horrible ambulance rides, and 
a 
journey of a 
week's duration, he was obliged to undergo 
amputation of the leg. 
He telegraphed home, hundreds of 
miles away, that all was going well, and with a 
soldier's forti-
tude composed himself to bear his sufferings alone. 
Unknown to him, however, his mother, one of those dear re-
serves of the army, hastened up to join the main force. 
She 
reached. the city at midnight, and the nurses would have kept 
her from him until morning. 
One sat by his Ade fanning him 
as he slept, her hand on the feeble, fluctuating pulsations which 
foreboded sad results. 
But what woman's heart could resist 
the pleadings of a 
mother then? In the darkness she was 
finally allowed to glide in and take the place at his side. 
She 
touched. his pulse as the nurse had done. 
Not a 
word had 
been spoken; but the sleeping boy opened his eyes and. said: 
"That feels 
like my mother's hand! 
Who is 
this be-
side me? It is my mother; turn up the gas, and let me see 
_ 
mother 1" I"
.
 - 
The two dear kces met in one long, joyful sobbing embrace, 
ancl the fondness pent up in each heart sobbed and panted and 
wept forth its expression. 
The gallant fellow., just twenty-one, his leg amputated on the 
last clay of his three years service, underwent operation after 
operation, and at last, when death drew nigh, and he was told 
by tearful friends that it only remained to make him comfort-
ble, said: " he had looked. death in the face too many times 
to be afraiT nr," and died as gallantly as did the men of the 
_ 
Cumberland. 
Thro' the darkness I 
have listened, 
For the music of her voice, 
For the gentle words of comfort, 
That would make my heart rejoice 
All the weary hours I've counted, 
Measured o'er and. o'er again, 
Yet no Mother came to cheer me, 
Or to soothe my throbbing pain. 
cuottus. 
I 
have prayed she might be near me 
Ere I 
seek that other Land,, 
And I 
feel sii'e is beside me, 
For I 
know my mother's hand, 
WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME. 
Hark I 
hear familiar footsteps, 
And a 
well-remembered sigh, 
Bringing back the distant moments, 
When youth's changeful hours went by; 
And. I 
feel the gentle pressure, 
On my brow, thy kisses fanned, 
Yes I 
know she is beside me, 
I 
can feel my mother's hand. 
I 
have prayed, &e. 
Mother! yes, it is my mother, 
She is here beside me now, 
In the world there is no other, 
Who can calm my burning brow; 
Let me look upon her features, 
Which I 
oft with love have scanned, 
Oh! I 
know it is my mother, 
For I 
feel her gentle hand. 
I 
have prayed, &e. 
WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING H03.IE. 
When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah 
We'll give him a 
hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrah ! 
The men will cheer, the boys will shout! 
The ladies, they will all turn out, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When. Johnny comes marching home. 
The old church-bell will peal with joy, hurrah, hurrah! 
To welcome home our darling boy, hurrah, hurrah! 
The village lads and lasses say 
With roses they will strew the way, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
Get ready for the Jubilee, hurrah, hurrah! 
We'll give the hero three times three, hurrah, hurrah! 
The laurel-wreath is ready now 
To place upon his loyal brow, 
nd we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
Let love and friendship, on that day, hurrah, hurrah t 
Their choicest treasures then display, hurrah, hurrah 1 
And let each one perform some part, 
To fill with joy the warrior's heart, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home.

I'm leaving thee in sorrow, Annie, 
I'm leaving thee in tears; 
It may be for a 
long time, Annie, 
Perhaps for many years. 
CrIOILITS. 
I'm leaving thee, but weep not, Annie, 
I'll come back yet to thee, 
And bring some hope and comfort, Annie, 
To one so dear to me. 
But ' tis more kind to part now, dearest, 
Than linger here in pain, 
To weep o'er joys that once were shining, 
But never may shine again. 
I'm leairing thee, & c. 
I'm thinking on the past, dear Annie, 
Thy locks were bright as gold, 
Thy smile was soft, but now, dear Annie, 
Our hearts seem growing old. 
I'm leaving thee, &e. 
Yet 'tis not time has stole the blossoms, 
From off thy cheek so fair, 
'Twas winter came too soon upon us, 
And chilled the flowerets there. 
I'm leaving thee, &e 
I'm leaving thee, but weep not, Annie, 
For when I've passed yon sea, 
I'll gather hope and comfort, Annie, 
And bring them back to thee. 
I'm leaving thee, &e. 
I'm leaving thee in sorrow, Annie, 
I'm leaving thee in tears, 
It may be for a

Perhaps for many years.

I WISH I 
WAS A FLY. 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD, 
Mr—"I 
wish I 
was a 
bird." 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fly, up in the air so free, 
A-buzzing constantly, how happy should I 
be. 
To grocers would I 
fly, and also sweet stuff shops, 
And pass a 
life of bliss among the lolipops ; 
Bat in those honeyed moments, too sweet, indsed to last, 
I 
might fall in a 'lasses pot, and there stick very fast, 
CHORUS. 
Still I 
wish I 
was a 
fly, up in the air so free, 
A-buzzing constantly, how happy should I 
be. 
I 
wish:I was a. fly, a-buzzing in the sun, 
In July or in August annoying every one. 
To buzz about their ears, wherever they might go, 
And settle on the noses, too, of many folks I 
know ; 
But in those happy hours I 
might, oh I 
dreadful fate, 
Get caught by fishermen, and end my days as fishing bait. 
Still I 
wish, &c. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fly, in splendid state I'd dine, 
Off game and currant pie, washed down by sparkling wine. 
Some brandy neat I'd sup, and nothing have to pay, 
And being drunk as any fly, I'd try to fly away. • 
Alas! perhaps, when thinking how very well I 
thrive. 
&me horrid penny fly-vaper would catch me all alive. 
Still -I. wish; 
Stc. 
I 
wish was a 
fly, about the streets I'd roam, 
In windows would I 
pry, when old folks are from borne. 
I'd learn what's going on, and everything I'd see, 
I'd give a 
little knowing wink, with none to notice me ; 
Whilst laughing to myself, behind my back would steal, 
Some horrid spider who would quickly make of me a 
meal. 
Still I 
wish, &c.

I'M LONELY SINCE MY MOTHER DIED. 
I'm lonely since mother died; 
Tho' friends and kindred gather near, 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent heart-felt tear. 
Of earthly friends, she was the best 
My erring youthful steps to guide ;

Tho' friends and kindred.

I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the heart-felt silent tear. 
You may not deem it bravo or strong 
To let these tears so often flow; 
But those who've lost a 
mother's love, 
Can tell the pain of my sad woe. 
Could I 
but call her back again, 
And kneel once more down by her side, 
I'd love her better than before. 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
I'm lonely, & O.

you who nye a 
mother dear, 
Let not a 
word, or act, give pain; 
But cherish, love her with your life, 
You ne'er can have her like again.

Across death's dark and troubled tide, 
In pain, with me, you need not say; 
I'm hinely since my mother died.

ISLE OF BEAUTY. 
Shades of evening, close not o'er us, 
Leave our lonely bark a %1 
bile, 
Morn, alas I 
will not restore us 
Yonder dim and distant isle. 
Still my fancy can discover 
Sunny spots where friends may dwell, 
Darker shadows round us hover, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well. 
'Tis the hour when happy faces, 
Smile around the taper's light, 
Who will fill our vacant places ? 
Who will sing our songs to-night ? 
What would I 
not give to wander 
-Where my old ._:.::npanions dwell ? 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well.

No, no, not I; 
I'll not be a

Do you think that I'll obey, 
No not I, no not I. 
Words by LADY DI:UTERI:4i 
Music by D EMPSTER. 
I'm sitting on the stile, Mary, 
Where we sat side by side, 
On a 
bright May morning long ago, 
When first you were my bride ; 
The corn was springing fresh and green 
And the lark sang loud and high, 
And the red was on your lip, Mary, 
And the love light in your eye. 
The place is little changed, Mary, 
The day as bright as then ; 
The lark's loud song is in my ear, 
And the corn is green again ; 
But I 
miss the soft clasp of your hand, 
And your breath warm on my cheek; 
And I 
still keep listening for the wor(,s 
You never more will speak. 
'Tis but a 
step down yonder lane, 
And the village church stands near— 
The church where we were wed, Mary— 
I 
see the spire from here ; 
But the graveyard lies between, Mary, 
And my step might break your rest, 
For lye laid you, darling, down to skull, 
With your baby on your breast. 
I'm very lonely now, Mary, 
For the poor make no new friends, 
But oh ! they love the better far 
The few our father sends; 
And you were all I 
had, Mary, 
My blessing and my pride ! 
There's nothing left to care for now 
Since my poor Mary died. 
I'm bidding you a 
long farewell, 
My Mary kind and true, 
But I'll not forget you, darling, 
In the land Pin going to, 
They say there's bread and work for all, 
And the sun shines always there; 
But I'll not forget old Ireland, 
Were it fifty times as fair. 
The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
And sweetly the flowers bloom to-day, 
.And birds in the branches of hawthorn, 
Are caroling ever so gay: 
And down by the rock in the meadow, 
The rill ripples by with a 
song ; 
And, Mother, I, too, have been singing, 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night I 
was weeping alone: 
The world was so dark and so dreary, 
My heart it grew heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was I. 
I 
scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
But, oh! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered: Come out in the moonlight, 
l' ve something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh ! Mother, to him I 
am dearer 
Than all in the wide world beside ; 
He told me so out in the moonlight, 
And called me his darling, his bride.' 
So now I 
will gather my roses, 
And twine in my long braided hair: 
Then Willie will come in the evening, 
And smile when lie sees me so fair— 
And out in the moonlb ,ht we'll wander, 
Way down by the old hawthorn-tree. 
Oh! Mother I 
wonder if any 
Were ever so happy as we. 
36 
LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM. 
Oh! the days are gone, when Beauty bright 
My heart's chain wove ; 
When my dream of life, from morn till night, 
Was love, still love. 
New hope may bloom, 
And days may come, 
Of milder, calmer beam, 
But there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream ! 
No, there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream. 
Tho' the bard to purer fame may soar. 
When wild youth's past, 
Tho' he win the wise, who frown'd before, 
To smile at last; 
He'll never meet 
A 
joy so sweet, 
In all his noon of fame, 
As when first be sung to woman's ear, 
His soul-felt flame. 
And, at every close, she blushed to hear 
The one lov'd name. 
Oh! that hallow'd form is ne'er forgot, 
Which first love traed; 
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot 
On mem'ry's waste. 
'Twas odor fled. 
As soon as shed ; 
'Twas morning's winged dream ; 
'Twas a 
light that ne'er can shine again 
On life's dull stream! 
Oh 
1 'twas 
that ne'er can shine again 
On life's dull stream!

LLT ME KISS HIM FOR HIS MOTHER, 
Die incident which prompted this ballad, is emplained in the 
following: 
During the ravages of the yellow-fever in New 
Orleans, a 
young man, from the state of Maine, was attacked 
with that dreadful disease and soon died, with no relative to 
watch by his bedside, or soothe him with that sympathy which 
none but those of our own " dear kindred blood" oan feel or 
manifest. He died among strangers, and was buried by them. 
When the funeral service was over, and the strange friends, 
who had ministered to him, were close to the coffin, an old lady 
who stood by, stopped them and said: " Let me kiss Lim for 
his mother." 
What more lovely ? 
Let inc kiss him for his Mother 
Let me kiss his dear youthful brow ; 
I 
will love him for his Mother, • 
And seek her blessing now. 
Kind friends have sooth'd his pillow, 
have watched his ey'ry care; 
Beneath the weeping willow, 
Oh! lay him gently there. 
cIIoIujs. 
Sleep, dearest, sleep; 
I 
love you as a 
brother, 
Kind friends around you weep, 
I've kissed you for your Muther. 
Let me kiss him for his Mother, 
What though left a 
lone stranger la re ; 
She has loved him as none other, 
I 
feel her blessing near. 
Though cold that form lies sleeping, 
Sweet angels watch around; 
Dear friend's are near thee weeping; 
Oh! lay him gently down 
Sleep, dearest, sleep, &c. 
Let me kiss him for his Mother, 
Or perchance a 
fond sister dear; 
If a 
father or a 
brother, 
I 
know there blessings here. 
Then kiss him for his Mother: 
'Twill soothe her after-years ; 
Farewell, dear stranger, brother, 
Our requiem, our tears! 
Sleep, dearest, sleep, Lfze.

LOVE NOT. 
Love not! love not! ye hapless sons of clay, 
Hope's gayest wreaths are made of earthly flowers 
Things that are made to fade and. fall away, 
Ere they have blossom'd for a 
few short hours. 
Love not I 
love not! 
Love not! love not ! the thing you love may die, 
May perish from the gay and gladsome earth: 
The silent stars, the blue and smiling sky, 
Beam on its grave, as once upon its birth. 
Love not! love not! 
Love not! love not! the thing you love may change. 
The rosy lip may cease to smile on you! 
The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange, 
The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true. 
Love not! love not! 
Love not! love not! 0 
warning vainly said 
In present hours, as in years gone by, 
Love flings a

Faultless, immortal, till they change or die. 
Love not! love not!

LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
The Spring had come, the flowers 
The birds sung out their lay ; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May: 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day: 
And how I 
loved her ! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS: 
in bloom, 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day. 
Oh ! bow I 
love her! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My Own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gene 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side d'd linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c. 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although Fin far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c.

LET THE DEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL REST. 
Words by C. C. BCTLEEL 
Music by S. W ESLEY : MARTIN. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Make her grave 'neath the willow by the stream, 
Where the wind-harps will whisper o'er the blest, 
Like the song of some Angel in our dream. 
DUETT 
Oh! so young and fair, with her bright gold.en hair! 
Oh ! so young and fair, with her bright golden hair! 
CHORUS. 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream: 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest: 
For, the Spring-time is coming with its flowers, 
When the wild-rose will blossom o'er her breast, 
As the song- birds will while away the hours. 
Repeat Duett and Moms. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Where the long drooping willow branches wave; 
While the moon, slowly sinking in the West, 
Leaves the stars keeping vigils o'er her grave.

THE LONE ROCK BY THE SEA. 
Oh I 
tell me not the woods are fair, 
Now spring is on her way : 
Well, well I 
know how brightly, there, 
In joy the young leaves play ; 
How sweet, on winds of morn or eve, 
The violet's breath may be ; 
Yet ask me, woo me not to leave 
My lone rock by the sea. 
The wild lvaves' thunder on the shore,

MINSTREL'S RETITRNT0 FROM THE WAR. 
MY HEART IS OVER THE SEA. 
The Minstrel's retrrn.'d from the war, 
"With spirits as buoyant as air; 
And thus, on his to_neful guitar, 
He sings in the bower of his Fair: 
The noise of the battle is over, 
The bugle no more Nils, to arms. 
A soldier no more but a 
lover, 
I 
kneel to the power of thy charms, 
Sweet lady, dear lady, I'm thine; 
I 
bend to the magic of beauty 
Though the helmet and banner are mine. 
Yet love calls the soldier, to duty. 
The Minstrel his suit warmly prest; 
She blush'd, sigh'd and hung down her head? 
Till conquer'd she fell on his breast, 
And thus to the happy youth said, 
The bugle shall pt 
us Love, never, 
1.1y bosom they pillow shall be; 
Till death tears thee from me forever, 
tiIl faithful, I" 1. 
perish with thee, 
Sweet lady, dear lady, I'm thine; 
I 
bend to the ire gic of beauty, 
Though the helmet and banner are mine, 
Yet love calls taa soldier to duty. 
But Fame call'd the Youth to the field; 
His Banner wax'd over his head; 
He gave his guitar for a 
shield: 
But soon he laid low with the dead. 
-While she o'er he.,. young hero bending, 
Receiv'd his ex7iring adieu: 
I 
die, while my Cc untry defendfrig, 
With my heart to my lady-love true. 
Oh! Death then she sigh'd. I 
am thine! 
I 
tear off the rc,es of beauty— 
For, the grave of my hero is mine: 
He died true to love and to duty. 
Oh! many a 
time I 
am sad at heart, 
And I 
haven't a 
word to say; 
Aud I 
keep from the lasses and lads apart, 
In the meadows a-making hay, 
) 
But Willie will bring rae the first wild-rose 
In my new sun-bonnet to wear; 
And Robin will wait at the keeper's gate; 
For, he follows me everywhere. 
But I 
tell them they needn't come wooing to me: 
For my heart—my heart is over the sea. 
Repeat. 
Two summers ago, when a 
brave ship sailed 
Far away to the golden west, 
Oh! nobody knew that my heart went, too, 
For, the secret I 
ne'er confessed. 
A mother took leave of her boy that day; 
I 
could hear her sob and cry, 
As I 
followed her back to her dreary home, 
But never a 
word said I. 
But you see that they needn't come wooing to inc ; 
Repeat. 
For, my heart—my heart is over the sea. 
I 
sat by his mother, one mid-summer day, 
And she looked me through and through, 
As she spoke of her lad who was far away: 
Por she guessed that I 
loved him, too ; 
She turned to me fondly, and whispered low: 
I 
was worthy her sailor-boy. 
My foolish tears they began to flow, 
Though my heart beat high for joy. 
So, you see that they needn't come wooing to me : I 
Repeat. 
For, my heart—my heart is over the sea.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
It was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
Till she came to her own father's door. 
Oh, father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or this child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
Oh, why did I 
leave this (" ear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free ? 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me. 
The old man was deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; ' 
But the watch-dog did howl, and the village bell tolld, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
- , 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour. 
Saying, this cold winter's night, she perished and died, 
By the wind that blew across the wild moor, 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gene, 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Saying, there Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor! 
ELLA REE. 
Oh, Ella Roe, so kind and. true, 
in the little churchyard lies, 
Her grave is bright with drops of dew 
But brighter were her eyes. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee,' 
There let me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
(Repeat.) 
And the land where Ella lie. 
Her pretty eyes and gentle form, 
Methinks I 
yet can see, 
I 
love the spot where she was born, 
'Way down in Tennessee, 
Then carry me back to Tennessee,1 
There let me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
The summer moon will rise and set, 
And the night-birds trill their lay, 
And the possum and coon so softly step, 
Round the grave of Ella Roe. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, 
There let me live and die, 
(
Repeat.) 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
THE MINSTREL BOY. 
l
(Repeat.) 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild harp strung behind him. 
Land of song—said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One s‘ord at least its right shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains 
Could not keep his proud soul under ; 
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, 
He tore the strings asunder ; 
And said : " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery, 
Thy songs were made for the pure and l'rc 
They shall never sound in slavery 1"

ONE AT HOME WHO PRAYS FOR ME, 
WHO HAS NOT A PRAYING M OTHER ? 
Words by HENRy-M. H UNT. 
M usic by HENRY TUCKER, 
At midnight, on my lonely beat, 
When shadow wraps the wood. and lea, 
A vision seems my view to greet 
Of one at home who prays for no; 
No roses bloom upon her cheek, 
Her form is not a 
lover's dream, 
But o'er that brow so pure and meek, 
A thousand holier beauties gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Who has not a 
praying mother, 
Wheresoe'er his lot may be! • 
Ev'ry- wand'rer feels in darkest hour 
There's one at home who prays for me. 
How softly shines her silver hair, 
A 
patient smile is on her face, 
And that mild lustrous light of prayer 
Around her sheds a 
moonlike grace; 
She prays for me so far away— 
The soldier in his holy fight 
And begs that Heaven in mercy may 
Protect her boy and bless the right! 
Who has not. &c. 
Still though the leagues lie far between, 
This silent incense of her heart 
Steals o'er my soul with breath serene, . 
And we no longer are apart; 
So guarding thus my lonely beat 
By shadowy wood and haunted lea, 
That vision seems my view to greet 
Of her at home who prays for me. 
Who has not, &c. 
THE OLD PINE TREE, OR NANCY BELL. 
Oh! darkies, now I'm going to sing, 
De truth to you I

Oh happy days dat I

Wid my dear Nancy Bell. 
Oh ! I 
wish dat I 
was back again, 
Way down in Tennessee, 
Wid my dear Nancy by my side, 
Beneath de old pine tree! 
CHORUS. 
'Tis many a 
night since first we met, 
Beneath dat old pine tree, 
And dar we told out tales ob lub, 
How happy we would be I 
My lub has left me long ago, 
Whar she is no one can tell, 
An I 
am nearly crazy now 
For my dear Nancy Bell; 
But I 
dreamt last night, when all was still, 
Dat she'd come back to me, 
An I 
would yet see happy days, 
Beneath de old pine tree. 
'Tis many a 
night, &c. 
I 
quite forget I 
was so old; 
It seems to me a 
dream 
Dat three-score years liab past an gone, 
Since I 
was seventeen ; 
But ebery tino• comes right, at last, 
An Nancy's true to me; 
An when we die, oh ! let us rest 
Beneath de old pine tree

[CONCLUDED.] 
Many a 
bright, good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too—tho' more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, do your best, &e. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those who luckless labor, 
Never get fair winds at all: 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide; 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the tide. 
So then, do your best, &c. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep you in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to-morrow, 
If you try and persevere; 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, — 
Tho' the sky be overcast; 
Lowrest lanes must have a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. 
So then, do your best,

She just glanced at me, slihtly bowed her pretty little head,

found myself a

PRETTY POLLY. [CONCLUDED]. 
I 
met her at an up-town ball, oh 1 
happy night, 
Her eyes were bright, her step was light; 
Her conversation charming, and her figure slight, 
In fact, my style to a 
T. 
By Jove you should have seen 
This fairy queen's enchanting mien, 
Like me it would have been, 
With you quite up a 
tree. 
SPOKEN.—And I 
mean to occupy my mind cheerfully by remarking— 
Pretty Polly, etc. 
I 
told her I'd enlist, if she'd not LIST to me, 
Or go to sea, a 
tar to be; 
She said, " You silly fellow, better marry me. 
And stop at home for love." 
Next day to her ma I 
went, 
Gained consent, quite content, 
The invitations all are sent, 
And I'm going to marry my dove. 
SPOKEN,—And I 
mean, etc.

am dress'd in my best though I 
cannot pretend, 
That my costume is quite comme 
faut; 
You'll observe that my watch has been left with a 
friend, 
And my gloves are unfitted for show; 
There are traces of wear on my elbows and knees, 
And my boots have run down at the heel ; 
But it's cruel to criticise matters like these, 
When a 
man has grown Shabby Genteel.

Still I 
strive to be cheerful in all my distress, 
And I 
bear my bad luck like a

If I 
can't have my way as to feeding or dress, 
must still do the best that I 
can; 
And remember, good people, that Fortune some day, 
By a 
turn of her treacherous wheel, 
May reduce one of you in the very same way, 
To the level of Shabby Genteel.

WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER. 
Words and Music by H ENRY T UCKER. 
Dearest love, do you remember 
When we last did meet, 
How you told me that you loved me, 
Kneeling at my feet ? 
Oh! how proud you stood before me, 
In your suit of blue,, 
When you vow'd to me and country, 
Ever to be true. 
CHORUS. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, 
Hopes and fear, how vain; 
Yet praying, when this cruel war is over, 
Praying: that we meet again! 
When the summer breeze is sighing, 
Mournfully, along! 
Or when autumn leaves are falling, 
Sadly breathes the song. 
Oft, in dreams, I 
see thee lying 
On the battle plain, 
Lonely, wounded, even dying, 
Calling, but in vain. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, &c. 
If, amid the din of battle, 
Nobly you should fall, 
Far away from those who love you, 
None to hear you call: 
Who would whisper words of comfort, 
Who would soothe your pain ? 
Ali! the many cruel fancies, 
Ever in my brain. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, &e. 
But our country called you, darlings 
Angels cheer your way; 
While our nations's son's are fighting, 
We can only pray. 
Nobly strike for God and liberty, 
Let all nations see 
How we love our Starry Banner, 
Emblem of the free! 
Weeping, sad and lonely, &e.
