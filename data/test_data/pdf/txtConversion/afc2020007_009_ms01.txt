[00:00:00] 
MA: What is a lot of personal questions? I'll interview you. [Laughter.] 
EK: It’s Friday, May 7 at 1:16 pm. We are talking to Mason Allen, in Lamar, Missouri. And who 
knows what's gonna happen? Cuz he's kind of a rascal. 
MA: I’m a rascal. I’m a rascal. What would you like to know?  
EK: Well, the whole loading business, which I think is, as obviously as important is the flying, it's 
part of the, the farming, the air farming.  
MA: Yeah.  
EK: And what, how come, why do you do this?  
MA: Well, I was working for a corporate cellular company for about 10 years. And this business 
was ran by Kevin and my mother, Lisa, and got to a point where I was getting unhappy with my 
corporate job.  
EK: Excuse me a minute, that seems to be a theme. From corporate person to  
MA: Hands on work. 
EK: Ag pilot, you know, it's almost like you get burned out on the brain. 
MA: It's a burnout. But it's more it's not necessarily burnout on the brain. It's more of a political, 
it's a political game in a lot of corporate, in the corporate environment. To me, because there's a 
lot of sucking up in that type of, type of world. And it's not something that I was willing to do.  
EK: Did you do it for long?  
MA: I did. I did it for about 10 years.  
EK: Oh, so you have like,  
MA: So right out of… 
EK: A high tolerance level. [Laughs.] 
MA: I do. I'm very patient person. Right out of high school, right out of college I mean, I went to 
work for a smaller company, that was a computer tech company, that led me to be working for the 
cell phone company, because he was an agent of them. And so I went to the corporate side of that, 
and did that for about 10 years. And then, you know, in talking with my mom, family of 
complaining about my work,  
EK: As we do. 
MA: As we do, and she said, you know what you should do you should take over for me, because 
this stuff is stressing me out.  
EK: So your mom was loading?  
MA: My mom was loading, doing the books, doing the billing, maps, all that stuff. She had a couple 
people hired to help load and things like that, and they used to have a couple different pilots work 
for them when they had the smaller planes. But she asked me if I would take over and I said, how 
much you want to pay me?  
EK: Yeah.  
MA: And so it was it was perfect enough. I didn't get paid as much. But it was perfect enough 
because I didn't I wasn't in that environment anymore. And I was outside and working more with 
my hands and actually still using my brain with you know, all the chemical mixtures and doing the 
billing and things.  
EK: Yeah, ‘cause that's tricky stuff.  
MA: It is, it is because and it's costly if you make a mistake, because chemicals are not inexpensive. 
Like in the hangar right now, we probably have about $100,000 worth of product at any given 
time. The most I've ever seen in the hangar as far as how much the chemicals are about half a 
million whenever we're doing corn. But… 
EK: That was one of the comments that we've gotten, “A lot of money passes through my hands.” 
MA: Yes, yes, very much so. Passes through the hands in the form of chemical. And like I said, you, 
you mistake one gallon for, you know, or 128 ounces for 12 ounces, it's costly mistake. Generally, 
when we're doing corn specifically, we do a lot of fungicide on corn because corn is susceptible to 
mildew, mold, rust. And fungicides per acre, because a lot of farmers think in per acre, it costs 
about $30 per acre just for that chemical. And some of these farmers have 2,000 acres of crops and 
so that adds up real quick. And a gallon, a gallon of product will generally cover about 30 acres or 
so. So if you're off a gallon 30 acres, 30. That's like $1,000 mistake right there.  
EK: Yeah.  
MA: And so yeah, you got to be very careful. And you got to know a lot of math and conversions 
and things like that. Because not only do I deal with liquid I deal with dry, so weighted ounces. 
EK: You have to go to school to learn how to mix? 
MA: No. 
EK: I mean, I didn't know if there was like, it seems like there are two pathways to this profession. 
One is informal, where you pull in all of the knowledge of that community and learn that way. The 
other way is the more structured, I've got to go to school to learn how to do this stuff. 
MA: Right.  
EL: I just didn't know like if there were federal regulations that you have to have this number of 
hours of training or… 
 
[00:05:18] 
MA: We just have to have an operator's license. Which is what Kevin has, because he has to have 
one for flying. So I'm basically working under the guise of his applicator’s license. So that covers 
his entire business, it covers me to mix. If we ever let that lapse and like expire, without renewing 
it, we have to go back to like, like, not school, but it's like a seminar, we have to go through a two-
day seminar to get recertified again. So, 
EK: Are there, is it a highly regulated bit of this profession? 
MA: Yes, very much so. Not only by the state, but by the federal government. Kevin normal… 
normally, I don't have to deal with the FAA, Kevin is the one that usually has to deal with that, 
because that's the plane side. But the state side, the chemicals and our record keeping and things 
like that, that's done by the state. And we get checked up on twice a year, to check our paperwork, 
make sure we're writing down the proper information for the chemical, there's an EPA regulation 
number that we need to have documented, the rate at which it was applied the weather. And. 
EK: So like, you have to record, the exact… 
MA: Wind, wind speed and direction, and temperature. Because all these chemicals fall within a, 
certain parameters that are, that you're able to spray it. So for a lot of the fungicides that we'll do, 
you can't exceed a certain wind speed, whenever you're spraying it out of plane, because when it 
comes out of a plane, it comes out as a fine mist, as opposed to a ground rig, which is just water 
jets essentially down into the, into the plants. So our, our product, whenever it comes out of our 
plane is more susceptible to wind. So there's a lot more regulation on wind, and temperature as 
well, especially in the height of summer, there are thermal inversions in the air as you go up. And if 
we're spraying a herbicide, and there's a temperature inversion, generally around the 50 foot to 
100 foot range, what will happen is that chemical will just hang there in midair until some sort of 
wind comes along and blows it away, or it just falls by itself. So we have to be very careful about 
temperature and humidity. We have to record all of that information. 
EK: Every single day you fly? 
MA: Every single day, we fly for every single job we do. Luckily, this year, I've put in a program to 
where I don't have to keep looking up EPA regulation numbers for the chemicals we use. There's a 
few different methods that I used to use, like just taking a picture of the label, it has the EPA right 
on and all that stuff. So and we have to make sure our numbers are within the parameters of the 
label of the chemical as well. So. 
EK: So you know, there's a public perception that you're like flying around poisoning people. 
MA: Yeah. Oh, I no. Yes and No, like, there's a there's a lot of opinion on it.  
EK: Right. 
MA: My, in my personal opinion on it, these row crops that we have around here, they're not used 
generally for human consumption. They're used for cattle feed. The corn is not used for human 
consumption. It's for cattle feed. Wheat, is potentially the one that humans would actually 
consume. Soybeans, not so much, you have to have a certain type of soybean. There are only a 
handful of farmers that I know around here that actually do food grade soybeans. One of them is 
an organic farmer over, over in Mendinmines. And he does organic soybeans every year, and we 
actually spray for him. Not chemicals, we usually spray, uh, there are organic approved chemicals 
that are more natural, like we'll put sugar on his soybeans for two reasons.  
EK: Sugar like,  
MA: Like sugar, 
EK: Like, like simple syrup?  
MA: Like a bag of sugar, like a giant 50-pound bag of sugar, 
EK: Oh so you do it dry.  
MA: And we mix it in the water. And we do that for two reasons. One, it actually kills a lot of 
different types of bugs, because insects can't digest sugar, and they'll just explode.  
EK: Wow.  
MA: And it actually boosts the growth of the plant because it gives them like a, like a sugar rush 
like it does to us. It's energy. So it's energy for the plant, they'll get a little boost. We spray dried 
blood on those on those soybeans over there. And it's like a mixture of like bovine pig, right. And 
we use that to keep deer away from those because generally deer will stay away from a field that's 
been sprayed with chemical because of their sense of smell. If it's an organic field, they'll just walk 
right through it and just eat it and eat it and almost destroy a crop. We spray blood on it to keep 
them away because they smell the blood and they think there's a predator around. So, as far as the 
misconception, a lot of, a lot of the stuff we spray isn't for us for human consumption. 
EK: Yeah. And I don't think people know, know that, remember, right, a few years ago when, like, 
they like there was this huge push for fuel for ethanol and how it was, I mean, the perception was 
that it was going to, like,  
MA: Replace oil.  
EK: And, and and also that that then we wouldn't have any corn on the cob. I'm like,  
MA: That's not how that works.  
EK: No. [Laughter.] 
[0010:38] 
MA: That's just not how that works.  
EK: No one says I'm really hankerin’ in this time of year for ear of field core. 
MA: Yeah. A lot of the public perception of a farmer nowadays, and again, the, just like crop 
dusters. They're not a lot of farmers anymore. But the public perception is is that oh, well, we got 
to appreciate these farmers. They're growing our food for us. Right. No row cropping today? Not,  
it's not factory row cropping here. There's still a lot of small farmers around this area. They 
haven't been bought by big farmers. But a lot of row cropping.  
EK: Less than 2 percent? 
MA: Less than 2 percent. They're not there. In a roundabout way, yeah, they're growing food for us 
because the the corn that they grow is feed for cattle. And that cattle is used for slaughter. So 
technically, in a roundabout way, yeah they're growing our food. But they're not growing, like, I'm 
not picking out a corn cob at the local grocery store that came from Jimmy Bob's field down the 
road. 
EK: Right.  
MA: Yeah, that's not happening. There are a few farmers that will have plots of sweet corn, which 
is corn for human consumption. But the plots... (sound of airplane). The plots that they use are 
they generally use it for their own community. So, uh. 
EK: So another concern, in that same vein, is that the amount of actual chemical that you're 
applying is far less than what people think, isn't it? 
MA: Yes. The chemicals that they used to use way back when were much worse than they are 
today. They're much more regulated now. And they dissipate rather quickly. There's not a lot of 
chemicals that stay on there, like, on all the chemical labels that will tell you how many days you 
have until you can harvest it. Which means like, like for Roundup, I'll give Roundup as an example 
‘cause that's the big thing, that's the big one that scares everybody. You can harvest two weeks 
after you spray it. And the reason for that is because the parts per million dissipates so quickly, 
because once they get into the plant, 
EK: You have to go over there? 
MA: Uh, here in a second. Once they get into the plant, the target kill plants will process these 
chemicals kind of like humans process food, it goes through its system. And then it gets expelled, 
essentially. So like, especially if it rains afterwards it the more water you put on a chemical, the 
less parts per million there are. 
EK: Right. 
MA: So, uh… 
EK: You get phone calls from people complaining? 
MA; Yes, all the time. All the time.  
EK: And what do you do? How do you handle ‘em?  
MA: I tell him to go pound s… [Laughter.] It depends on what it is. 
EK: You give them someone else's phone number because they might care. 
MA: [Laughter.] No, you know, Lisa is really big about getting things figured out immediately, 
when it comes to something like that, like I'll give you an example just two days ago. Somebody 
called, said that we did seeding for a customer, which was their neighbor. And they, we got 
ryegrass in their wheat field. And it messed up some of his wheat. And he told us where he was at. 
And we did some seeding for one of his neighbors. But we didn't do it anywhere near his house. 
We had to look back on our old records to find where we did, did put the seed down and it turns 
out it was somebody else, but Lisa was very adamant in the middle of everything that I'm doing 
here to hunt for this file and find, and figure it out.  
EK: And that's one of the things like,… Is he flapping at you? 
JK: If you need to go load, we can talk more… 
MA: Yeah, yeah. If you Yeah. We'll pause it for one second. 
[Recording paused. Resumes after loading.] 
MA: Then back up to Wisconsin. And then down here.  
EK: So California to Wisconsin,  
MA: Wisconsin to Kentucky, Kentucky to Indiana, Indiana to back up to Wisconsin, and then 
Wisconsin to here.  
EK: So when you say you don't like Kentucky you really mean it.  
MA: Yeah, well, it because where I lived in Indiana was right, right on the Ohio River. And 
everybody was all about UK basketball. UK basketball this, UK basketball that, hated everything 
about conducting. 
EK: That's my favorite bridge in the whole world, that Cairo bridge. That double crossing, the first 
time I ever went across those bridges. Back in another life, I drove a truck. And it was nighttime. 
And I had no clue and I was driving and I was crossing this bridge. And it was, you know how 
narrow it is? It seems like the most narrow bridge ever. And if I had known how tall it was, I 
probably really would have been freaked out. But I passed another truck and our mirrors hit and 
shattered.  
MA: Um, Ohh! 
[00:15:34] 
EK: Yeah, that was my first time across those bridges. I'm an old hand at it now with Sam being 
there. So just like, I’ll drive it. [Laughs.] So where, we were, you were talking about negative phone 
calls, I find that amazing that that people on the ground feel like they have a right to call up and 
complain. 
MA: Yeah, the, the issue lies with the neighbors. So like, in a farming community, we generally 
don't get too many in a year. Because it is a farming community. And so people understand. People 
understand their neighbors. We get a few, they're very few and far between where people just 
kind of want to complain just to complain. But the one thing that we do watch out for we're very, I 
have a, I have a cork up there of areas to watch out for sensitive areas. Most of those sensitive 
areas are people who have bees. We’re purists, we’re very, us as a company, we're very concerned 
about bees, right? We do not want to spray an insecticide near bees. Butterflies don't care so much 
about. The bees are the thing. [Laughter.] We've done a couple of calls about butter, and killed my 
butterflies, your butterflies, 
EK: Your personal butterflies. 
MA: Your personal, oh the butterflies in your area. Okay. But sometimes you'll get an ornery 
neighbor, you’ll get somebody who's onery, not liking something. Or you'll get somebody who 
transplanted from a larger city, move into a farming community and not really understand how it 
works.  
EK: Yeah.  
MA: And then they like to complain. And we've only had a handful of people who were just like, 
complaining just to complain and trying to get something out of it. We've only had that happen a 
handful of times. Generally we we try to make it right as best as we can. There was one time Kevin 
sprayed some Bradford pear trees. Now these Bradford pear trees, they don't produce anything . 
EK: No they don’t. Except more of themselves.  
MA: Exactly. And somebody was very, very mad that we had killed them. And so we had to replace 
some of them. And we did, even though we very well couldn't have but you know, at that point, 
their course of action is to file a lawsuit against us. And that's the last thing we want. So we try to 
make it right as best as we can. Especially if they have a leg to stand on. You know what I mean? 
Like, like, well, we'll take care of it, we'll try to take care of it without, you know, without it going 
in any type of litigation, because nobody wants that, because we're busy in the summer. 
EK: That was one thing that Brad said, if somebody calls and complains, I call him immediately, he 
said, or I just avoid them, that whole area if I possibly can. He said there was a woman who was at 
the end of the runway, he said, so I just never take off that direction anymore. You know, which I 
think is, is odd that you have to accommodate. You know, when you're doing your job?  
MA: Yeah. 
EK: You know, it's like, like, in my job, if I was teaching and a parent called up and said, I don't like 
the way you're teaching. You'd be like, go to school for eight years.  
MA: Um-hm. Like, get out of my face. 
EK: Yeah. But you guys have to, you have to like, it's because you're so public I guess, you're so 
visible. 
MA: Yeah, I would, I would say it's because one, we're so visible. Two, there is a lot of liability 
involved with it like, especially if you have two, a farmer with two different, two different crops 
right next to each other, like one farmer has this crop, it's wheat, farmer B has this crop, it's it's 
corn. There are some chemicals that you could spray on wheat, but you can't spring on corn 
because they'll kill it. And that's where a lot of the liability is, that's the thing we're most 
concerned about is herbicide, because it's something you can actually see.  
EK: Right.  
MA: Generally plants, dead plants. That's that, that that concerns people. And so that's what we'll 
get calls about mostly. If it's like fungicide or insecticide, it's relatively not that harmful. Insecticide 
more than anything else, fungicide, you can almost take a bath and it won't do it. You won't get 
sick.  
EK: You ever call people like if you know that, because some people will just you know, they have 
compromised immune systems. Do you ever make phone calls and say we're gonna be in your 
area? 
MA: Yes. It's not so much the uh… We have we have one lady who has PTSD, because she was in 
the Joplin tornado in 2011. And so whenever the plane goes over, it makes it really, really loud 
noise, right? It triggers her PTSD. So we just call her ahead of time and say, Hey, we're gonna be in 
your area. You know, just so you're aware, so you don't get spooked? 
EK: Yeah. 
MA: That type of thing. 
[00:20:22] 
MA: We have another person who we call, trying to think now. There’s that lady, and then… Oh, we 
have somebody who does organics down in Carthage. And we usually call her if we're going to be 
in her area. And if it's a field right next to it, and I'm like, I always tell her I go, we're gonna spray 
this field. She goes, I would rather you not even though it's not her property, we're liable for 
anything that gets on her or messes with organic. So we have to call the farmer then and say we 
cannot spray that. Like, we just can't, because… 
[00:21:04] 
EK: So then does he call somebody else who will?  
MA: He could. He could, Or he could spray it himself or, but generally, like, we haven't lost 
customers over something like that. We've told a couple farmers, we can't spray this field or that 
field, they generally understand. If they do get mad and alarmed. I'm gonna go somewhere else. 
Good luck to you, then. 
EK: I guess they just call in just like a, what do you call it? That… 
MA: Ground rig? 
EK: Ground rig 
MA: Yeah, generally, if they're calling us, they can't get on it with a ground rig. Generall. Some 
farmers don't like tracks in their fields, so they'll, they'll call us just for that. But, but we've only 
had a couple instances where the, the farmer will be like, well, I'm gonna go somewhere else. I 
have to say, Okay, I'm sorry, we can't do that. But, you know, it's, we're not, we're not going to 
spray 25 acres just to get sued. 
EK: A woman who I was talking to about this project said that she saw a helicopter spraying 
around. 
MA: Helicopters do. Yep.  
EK: Which I thought was pretty interesting. 
MA: That is very, very neat. The positives and negatives of both of them. Helicopter, like, if there's 
a field surrounded by trees, helicopter could just get in there. And just, you know,… 
EK: Would that work better for somebody who's like, adjacent as far as organic?  
MA: Not really? Because it comes out comes out of the nozzle the same as the plane. (to Kevin) 
Aren’t helicopters, the same nozzles?  
KK: Yeah. It's still that fine mist. 
MA: Yeah. Though, they'll generally get into a field and just kind of do one of these types of things 
as best as they can. 
EK: Is that is that like, for small fields that are like, difficult for  
MA: A plane to get in?  
EK: Yeah. 
MA: Like if you had like a whole five acre patch surrounded by timber.  
KK: They're not holding as much. And they only hold 40 
EK: Forty? That’s not much at all.  
KK: No.  
MA: And generally, they only hold about what, 100 gallons or so?‘ 
KK: A big one holds about 120, a smaller one holds about 60 gallons? 
MA: Something like that.  
EK: That's hardly worth it. [Laughs.] 
KK: Well, they load right next to the field.  
ME: Yeah. Because they can they don't have to have a runway to land.  
EK: Yeah. 
KK: They just (indecipherable) had on truck. They just stop there. 
EK: I didn't even know they sprayed. But then Jack said that, that helicopters are pretty common, 
like in New Zealand, where.. 
KK: They’re also common out in California and Arizona. They spray all your lettuce and stuff. For 
the most part. 
EK: Huh. 
KK: Because it's only like five or six acre fields.  
MA: No, very small fields. 
EK: Yeah. What else do, do we need to know about loading and chemicals and… 
MA: Protection?  
EK: Yeah. 
MA: You got to have a lot of protection.  
EK: Do you hazmat suit up? Sometimes? 
MA: Not necessarily. The state only requires you to have long sleeves, long pants, gloves, and 
goggles and a mask.  
EK: Yeah. 
MA: That's all they require. Generally, it depends on the chemical. What I'm loading, if I'm loading 
insecticide, I'm gonna load down in long sleeves and pants. Because if you do get insecticide on 
you, it burns. It burns like, like a constant somebody scratching a sunburn. That's what it feels like. 
We also have like, oh, a lot of degreasing soaps that we use to try to get it off of us immediately. 
Like if I have if I spill chemical on my arm, I usually grab like Dawn or something, a degreasing 
soap, because a lot of the a lot of the chemicals are oil based. And so I just I literally I'll pour it on 
there and try to get it off. With cold water. Very important to use cold water not hot water because 
hot water opens up the pores allows a chemical to get in the pores. If you use cold water, it closes 
the pores up, and… 
EK: So how, how do you clean the spray unit? Like, same way the like ‘cause you I mean, like if you 
go from one thing to the other, it's not like you have different spray units, is it? 
[00:25:13] 
MA: No, no, you're talking about the plane, or the, or the mixing vat, or both? 
EK: Mostly the plane, mostly the plane. Most chemicals are it's not a problem if you mix them. It's 
whenever you're doing herbicides where you have to stop and wash the entire system out. For 
instance, if we're like, generally there's an overlap with, with corn and soybean, or not corn and 
soybeans, there is but in between wheat and corn, there will be some herbicide that we can spray 
on corn, for instance, Roundup, because they have Roundup Ready corn, if we spray Roundup, and 
then we have to go do some fungicide or insecticide for wheat field, we have to stop and we have 
to basically ammonia, the whole thing out. Like what I'll do is I'll take ammonia, mix it with water 
and one of our big vats. And basically we flush the entire system with ammonia water, because 
ammonia will stop, will basically render the chemical inert.  
EK: So then what do you do with that, the ammonia water? 
MA: The ammonia, the ammonia water literally just gets sprayed out. We spray as we're pumping 
it in, it's spraying out through the nozzles that we have to clean the nozzles too. So it's literally just 
sprayed out because the ammonia and the water, when it's on the tarmac, it's just going to 
evaporate. It's not going to get to anything,  
EK: It doesn't go, like… 
MA: Yeah, if it does happen to go down to this grass right here, it's, it's, I use a, I use two, three 
gallons of ammonia for about 150 gallons of water. So it's very small amount of ammonia. It 
doesn't, doesn't hurt anything. The fertilizer we do for corn and soybeans actually hurts the grass 
around here more than anything else, because it burns it. Yeah. But it comes out of it. So but 
because the ammonia gets run through there it renders the chemical inert. 
EK: Do any of those things bother you? Like Do you have any sensitivity to them?  
MA: Sensitivity to specific insecticides?  
MA: Yeah. (to something to someone else in the room) It's okay. [Recording stopped] 
EK: Now I forgot the question.  
DK: Talking about sensitivity.  
EK: Oh, yes. Your sensitivity to insecticides. 
MA: Is it back on? Okay. It mostly, is mostly insecticide. Specific insecticides too, ‘cause there, there 
are some insecticides now that are safer, if you do happen to get it on you. They, they do this thing 
called, they encapsulate the chemical. Like if you ever see, see me pouring insecticide or anything, 
you get one that looks like yellowish clear, and you get one that's white, it looks like cream. The 
stuff that's cream generally doesn't burn me as much because the insecticide doesn't really 
activate until it goes through a certain chemical process whenever it gets sprayed out. So like, if I 
get it on me, it'll still burn eventually. But I have a little bit more time before the chemical activates 
when it hits the air, uh, where it burns me. But if it's an oil-based one, it soaks into the skin a little 
bit easier. Yeah. Excuse me.  
[Recording stopped.] 
EK: Sensitivity. So one of the things that a couple of the pilots have mentioned, is that there, it 
makes them angry, that, and Dusty specifically mentioned some ad that was used a crop duster, a 
picture of the, the Air Tractor zipping a field. And it said, it was a thing about Parkinson's, like, you 
know, chemicals and whatever, whatever causes Parkinson's? And like he said, why would they 
use, why would they use like, us to demonstrate? 
MA: Yeah, demonize it. When it’s the chemical companies. It's a, I have an opinion about that.  
EK: Good.  
MA: It's a, lobbyists, honestly. A lot is, it always always comes down to lobbyists. I hate lobbyists. 
[Laughter.] Basically what it could because chemical companies have money to throw at it, right? 
So if they want to, like a lot of these chemical companies is tax write offs will do, you know, give 
money to a cause. One of them might be Parkinson's. And then this, you know, the research grant 
for Parkinson's will come to him and say, Hey, we need to, you know, kind of, yeah, we need to do 
a little advertising because we think there's a link to some of these chemicals in Parkinson's. So we 
need to get your approval on it. And they'll, they'll say, No, don't do that because we're giving you 
money. Do it this way. That's what I think happens. I don't I don't blame the causes. I blame  
EK: The lobbyists, the lobby. 
MA: The companies, actually. 
[00:30:11] 
EK: Because the fact of the matter is, if you aren't safe, you don't have a business. 
MA: Right, exactly. It's the same way like, lumber. Lumber right now is really expensive because of 
the pandemic. I don't blame the pandemic for that. Because as it stands right now, supply and 
demand has started to level out. I blame the companies that aren't dropping the prices back down. 
Because like they're using the pandemic as an excuse to raise their prices. So, so, yeah, a lot of 
people, you know, will blame the people who are wearing the masks for the price for the prices 
being higher, or, you know, politicians for the prices being high, when in actuality it's not. It's a 
free market. And this is what happens in free market. You get companies that will, if they're 
making money hand over fist, why would they make less money? 
EK: Exactly, and the housing demand is up, so they're not going to drop the prices, as long as the 
housing demand is up. And when that then starts to level out, then bring it slowly. It’s like 
gasoline. Except there are so many other influences on that. 
MA: This is the off topic, but I have little to no patience for people who start off sentences, “You 
know, these democrats,” or “You know, these republicans.” I have zero to little patience for that. 
EK: Yeah, yeah. It's so bigger than much bigger than that.  
MA: Oh, I know. 
EK: Than a political party.  
MA: I guess I'm just anti capitalist . [Laughs.] 
EK: Somewhere. Somewhere iss the big puppet master.  
MA:Yeah.  
EK: Yeah. So I guess what, we need to let you go. But would you consider yourself essential to 
Kevin’s success? 
MA: Yeah, of course. [Laughs.] Okay, I'll give you an example. I had him,… 
EK: I had to ask.  
MA: Yeah. I had him set up… 
EK: Just to get you talking. 
MA: Yeah, we got, we did herbicide. We did a lot of herbicide this, this March. For wheat. And we 
had done like, over the course of three days, we did like 4,000 acres. And I was supposed to go 
visit my sister in Indiana. And so we had 800 acres left to do. Right? And so I had set him up, I had 
measured out all the chemicals for each job. I duct taped them all together. So he just had to pick 
up the map that was attached to the chemical, dump the chemical in and go. 
EK: Right. 
MA: The day I left, he got farmers coming in and got another 4,000 acres the day I left.  
EK: So he had 8,000 acres.  
MA: Well, he had 4,800 acres to do while I was gone within that week, because we had just done 
4000 acres, and we had 800 acres left. And he was doing that 800 acres, and he got another 4,000 
in and I wasn't there and I was going to be gone a whole week. So that whole week he is working 
by himself. And the first thing he says whenever I get back to the airport, after getting back from 
Indiana is I'm sure is I'm sure glad you're here. 
EK:  And with that we will end. I'm sure glad you're here. That's a good statement. Because I'm 
sure that, that that's true for… 
MA: Yeah. I keep, essentially my job is to keep them in the air as long as possible. That's how I look 
at it. Like my job is to make sure he doesn't really get out of that plane except to take, you know, 
stretch his legs. Yeah, he shouldn't have to be dealing with any of these farmers. I should be doing 
that. So like whenever a farmer does call him, why are they calling him? Tell him to call me. If they 
call you say you should call Mason. 
EK: Yeah. 
MA: But he he likes to talk and shoot the shit and all that stuff. So… 
EK: Create the relationship.  
MA: Yeah. 
EK: Yeah. So, okay.  
MA: All right.  
EK: Thank you very much. 
MA: Hey, I appreciate it.
