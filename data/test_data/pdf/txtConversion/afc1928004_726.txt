I
WAS burn in Hawkins County, East Tennessee, 
August 23, 1869. 
I 
came to Indiana with my par-
ents in IS59, and settled in Dubois county. 
I 
have 
I'ved in Dubois and :\ lartin counties ever since, except 
the time I 
have spent in different states trying to gain 
a 
living. 
The cruel hand of fat e ha s been on me from 
birth, for I was born blind. 
It is an awful thing to 
live a 
life of darkness, and be compelled to struggle 
with the cruel world for a 
living. 
While trying to get 
a 
little here and there, I have, traveled over Kentucky, 
Illinois, Indiana, Missouri. eastern Kansas and north-
eastern Arkansas. 
Mv dear reader, I 
have never seen the light of day, 
and never expect to as you do. 
The earth with all its 
fullness and colors, the friends who stand before me, 
the great sky above, nothing that others blessed with 
eyesight loo upon and enjoy have I 
ever seen. 
The 
glories of the great earth are not for me. 
I 
have been making my own way in the world ever 
since I 
was fifteen years old. 
I 
learned to play the 
violin at seventeen, and since that it has been my onc 
faithful friend. 
M y 
home is on the street, for f 
have' 
been at home little since I 
was I ' ears old. 
My op-
portunities for schooling have not been great, having 
been at school but one year. 
In my battles with the world, I 
never fo ,fnd any• 
thing else but my violin for making a 
living, and you 
can imagine, what the lines r 
f 
my life have been—for 
one who cannot see 
I 
try to make life a 
success, and gain a 
livelihood 
without help. 
Sometimes it looked awful dark and 
blue to 
me, for ..1 have 
been among 
strangt.rs 
without a 
nickel in the world in m ., 
pocket. 
Fortune 
has favored me in my travels, for no accident has ever 
befallen me. 
Few have mistreated me, and I 
have 
met with general kind treattment. 
I 
try to put troub• 
les away instead of borrowing them. 
If I 
have an en— 
emy in he world I 
do not know it. 
I try to live an 
honest, conscientious life, and I 
have my first oath to 
swear and my first drank to be on. 
hat I 
am I 
have accomplished by my own efforts, 
There is no one that knows me at all but will buy one 
of my books.' 
If tiny one desires to know about my 
reputation, he can write to my address,

Lost River, Martin Co , Indiana. 
A Boy's Best Friend. 
I 
have had many friends, 
And some _good ones too, 
Who would stand by a 
comrade's side; 
But the one that 1 
loved 
Was kind and so true; 
We missed her dear face when she died. 
My father loved her as well as he should, 
So did my sister and my brother, 
For a 
friend need, is a 
friend to you indeed— 
A boy's best friend is his mother. 
( HOWL'S-
Then treat her kindly and stand by her side, 
For when she's dead you'll get no other; 
Oh, the one that I 
loved has passed with the tide; 
A boy's hest friend is his mother. 
Your father may turn you away from his door, 
Out in the cold, piercing street, 
W 
here you have no place to lay your aching head; 
Cold glances around you will meet 
There is one dear friend that is waiting for von; 
One, my boy, and no other, 
She will stand by her boy, so kind and so true; 
A boy's best friend is his mother. 
Then treat your mother with respect, 
For she's the only one that does love von; 
And never for a 
moment her little wants neglect j,7, 
Your mother, so kind and so true, 
For when she is laid in the cold, cold clay, 
Lide her you will find you'll get no other, 
And the wild flowers wave sadly o'er her grave, 
God bless her, your own dear mother. 
Come all you tender Christians, 
Come listen to what I 
say, 
And likewise pay attention 
To these words from me; 
For the murder ofJames A. Garfield, 
1,
1 am condemned to die, " 
And on the 30th day of June 
I'll Meet my fatal dobm. 
CHORUS— 
My name is Charles Guiteau, 
My name I'll never deny, 
I 
leave my aged parents 
In sorrow for to die; 
But little did they think I, 
While in my youthful bloom, 
Would be taken to the scaffold 
To meet my fatal doom. 
It was down at the depot, 
I 
tried to make my escape, 
But providence being against me, 
I 
found it was too late; 
They took me to the prison, 
All in my youthful bloom, 
And to- day I 
take the scaffold 
To meet my fatal doom 
I 
tried to play off insane, 
But found that would not do, 
The people being against me, 
It proved to be untrue 
Judge Cox first read the sentence, 
The clerk he wrote it down, 
And on the 30th day of June 
I'll meet my fatal doom. 
AIv sister came to the prison 
'I'o bid her last farewell; 
She threw her arms around my neck 
And wept most bitterly, 
Said she, my darling brother, 
To—day you'll surely die, 
For the murder of James A. Garfield, 
Upon the scaffold high 
The Ship That Never Returned. 
On a 
summer's day, when the sea was ruffled 
By a 
soft and gentle breeze, 
Did a 
ship set sail with cargo loaded, 
To a 
port beyond the seas; 
There were sweeffarewells and loving signals, 
'Till the form could not be discerned; 
They ktlew, it npt a 
sohnIn.parlirig, 
rer thb 'slid.riever f'ettizsued.-

CHORUS— 
Did she ever return? 
No she never returned, 
And her said fate is yet unlearned; 
For years and years have loved ones been waiting, 
For the ship that never returned. 
Said a 
feeble boy to his aged mother,. 
I 
must cross that wide, wide sea; 
They say there is chance in a 
foreign country, 
There is strength and health for rue. 
There was a 
glow of hope and mass of danger, 
Yet her heart for her younger yearned; 
She sent him away with a 
smile and a 
blessing 
On the ship that never returned. 
"One more trip - said a 
gallant seaman, 
As he t,issed his weeping wife, 
"One more bag of gold and treasures, 
It will last us all through life; 
We will settle down in our cozy cottage 
To enjoy what I 
have earned." 
But, alas! the poor man he sailed commander 
On the ship that never returned. 
Jesse James. 
Jesse James was a 
lad 
That killed many a 
man, 
He robbed the Danville train; 
But that dirty little coward 
That shot at Mr. Howard, 
Has laid Jesse James in his grave. 
It was little Robert Ford, 
'I hat dirty_ little coward; 
I 
wonder how he does feel, 
For he eat of Jesse's bread 
And slept in Jesse's bed, 
Then laid Jesse James n 
his grave. 
HORUS— 
Poor Jesse had a 
wife, 
To mourn for his life; 
Children they were brave, 
But that dirty little coward, 
That shot at Mr. Howard 
Has laid Jesse James in his grave.

It was with his brother Frank 
He robbed the Gallatin bank, 
And carried the money from the town; 
It was at this very place 
They had a 
little chase, 
For they shot 
 t• apt. Sheets to the ground. 
'I hey went to the crossing 
Not very far from there, 
And there they did they same, 
With the agent on his knees 
He delivered up the keys 
To the, outlaws Frank and Jesse James. 
It was on Wednesday night, 
The moon was shining bright, 
They robbed the Danville train; 
The people they did say 
For many miles away, 
It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James. 
It was on Saturday night, 
The moon was shining bright, 
Talking with his family brave, 
Robert Ford came along 
Like a 
thief in the night, 
And he laid Jesse James in his grave. 
The people held their breath 
When they heard of Jesse's death, 
And wondered however he came to die. 
It was one of the gang 
Called little Robert Ford, 
lie shot Jesse James on the sly. 
This song was made 
By Billy LaShade, 
As soon as the news did arrive, 
He said there's no man 
‘‘ ith the law in his hand 
Can take Jesse James when alive. 
Drummer Boy of Shiloh. 
On Shiloh's dark and bloody ground, 
Where tne dead and wounded lay, 
And among them was a 
drummer boy 
Who beat the drum that day. 
A wounded soldier held him up, 
his drum lay by his side; 
lie clasped his hands, he raised his eyes 
And prayed before he died 
The soldiers gathered all around 
Stout hearted and were brave, 
The flag it was a 
winding sheet 
That carried him to his grave. 
There is many a 
home is desolate, 
And many a 
heart to sigh, 
And mony were like the drummer boy 
Who prayed before he died. 
Good- Bye, Darling. 
What a 
jolly girl am I, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
Because I'm engaged in something sweet; 
And it seems as every day, 
When he goes away, 
To whisper something sweet at the door. 
CHORUS— 
Good- bye darling, I 
must leave you; 
One more kiss before I 
go, 
I'll be back to- morrow night; 
If I 
cannot I 
will write a 
line or two 
To let my darling know. 
Ladies, if you want to find 
Some gents that's good and hind; 
You can be .no happier I'm sure. 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau, 
That when he comes to go 
To whisper something sweet at the door? 
And his teeth are white like pearl, 
And his darling little curl; 
And his name is Lilly Dusky Moore. 
IIe's the joy of my. life 
And I 
soon will be his wife, 
Then he need not whisper at the door.

Drummer Boy of Waterloo. 
When battles raged each warlike band 
And courage loud each trumpet blew, 
Young Edwin left his native land, 
A drummer boy for Waterloo. 
His mother when his lips she pressed, 
And bade her noble boy adieu, 
With ringing hands and aching breast 
Ile herd his march for Waterloo. 
The boy who knew no infant fears, 
His knapsack on his shoulder threw, 
Cried he, dear mother, dry those tears 
Till I 
return from W 
ate rl 00 . 
Ile went toward the setting sun, 
Beheld our arms the foe subdue; 
The flash of death, the murderous gun 
Has laid him low at Waterloo. 
Oh, comrades! comrades! Edwin cried, 
nd proudly beamed his eyes so blue, 
my mother Edwin died 
A soldier's death at Waterloo. 
They laid his head upon his drum, 
Beneath the moonlights mournful hue 
It was night, but yet -'the battle raged; 
They dug his grave at Waterloo. 
Mary of The Wild Moor. 
One night when the winds blew cold, 
Blew bitter across the wild moor; 
Young Mary came with her child, 
Wandering home to her own father's door 
Crying father, oh father, let me in; 
have pity on me, I 
am poor, 
For the child on Iny bosom will die 
Of the winds that blow across the wild moor. 
Oh why did I 
leave this fair cot, 
Where I 
once was happy and free, 
Doomed to roamwithout friends ora home; 
Oh father have pity on me. 
Though the father was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
And the watch dogs they howled, 
And the wind blew bitter across the wild moor. 
And the father imagined surprise 
hen he came to the door in the morn, 
And there saw Mary dead, and her child 
Fondly clasped in its dead mother's arms, 
While in frenzy he tore his gray hair 
As on Mary he gazed at the door, 
Saying thei-e she has perished and died 
Of the wind that blew across the wild moor. 
And the father in grief pined away, 
And the child to the grave soon was borne, 
And there no one lives to this day; 
And the cottage to ruin has gone. 
And the villagers point out the spot 
IN here a 
willow weeps over the door, 
Saving there Mary perished and died 
Of the winds that blew across the wild moor 
A Mother's Request. 
I 
have traveled through life 
I 
have seen many things 
That are surprising in every form. 
I 
have worked at the plow, 
I 
have worked at the spade 
From dark till sunrise in the morn. 
Sometimes I 
would go to the village for sport; 
VA hen going away my mother would say, 
"Be home early to- night my dear boy." 
C 
HoR US-
Be home early to- night my dear boy, 
Be home early to- night my dear boy, 
Don't spend your money to gamble or drink 
Be home early to—night my dear boy. 
Come every young man, 
Take a 
word of advice, 
Your father's and mother's attend 
A kind mother's love is not soon forgot, 
When she is gone you've lost your best friend. 
Don't spend all your money on gambling or drink 
There are other things you may enjoy. 
Take the lesson I 
give, it is a 
mother s 
request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, my mother was sick 
With a 
fever and torture of of pain. 
She said my dear boy, 
Take the motto I 
give; 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
That night I 
returned from a 
night's fun and joy; 
I 
heard that my mother was dead; 
Then a 
cold chill through my body run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Betsy Baker. 
From noise and bustling far way I work my time to 
employ, 
How happy did I 
spend each day, content with health 
and joy! 
The birds did sing and so did I 
as I 
passed o'er each acre 
I 
never knew what it was to sing till I 
saw Betsy Baker. 
At church I met her dressed so neat, one Sunday in 
hot weather; 
With love I 
found my heart did beat as we sang pslams 
together. 
So piously she hung her head, the while her voice did 
shake her; 
I 
thought ifever I 
did wed it would be with Betsy Baker 
Then from her side I could not budge; I'm sure I 
meant•no harm; 
She on my shoulder gave a 
nudge and bade me mind 
the sermon. 
When the sermon was over she waltzed out, but I 
did 
oTertakc her; 
Determined I 
would not be bought till I 
spoke to Betsy 
Baker. 
Her manners were gentle and cool. I 
found in convor-
sation; 
She had just come home from boarding school with 
finished education. 
The love made me speak quite free; said I 
have many 
an acre; 
Then will you give me your company? 
No, I 
shant 
said Betsy Baker. 
All my entreaties she did slight, and I was forced to 
leave her. 
I 
got no sleep that livelong night, for love brought a 
fever, 
The Doctor came my health to gain, with a 
long face 
like a 
Ckttaker. 
Said he, young man where is your pain? 
Said I, I 
love Betsy Baker. 
I 
then again to Betsy went, with love once more to at-
tract her— 
Meanwhile she got acquainted with a rambling play-
actor; 
If she would have him, he did say a lady he would 
make her. 
He gammoned her to run away, so I 
lost my Betsy 
Baker. 
I 
traveled over hill and dale, and never looked behind, 
sir; 
My efforts were of no avail, as you will quickly find sir; 
And all the way I 
went along I 
tried to overtake her; 
I 
asked the people if they saw my cruel Betsy Baker. 
At length I 
came to Baltimore to see what's to be seen 
sir; 
And put up at the hotel they call the Indian Qieen sir, 
Next to dinner I 
sat down; to not a 
soul I 
spoke, sir; 
And who should come 12nd set by me, but my sweet 
Betsy Baker 
I 
thought I 
would be polite; I 
passed her a 
plate of 
mustard; 
She threw up her noise in the air, which Inthought it 
very hard, sir; 
I 
then passed her a 
plate of soup, which she refused to 
tale, sir; 
I 
then upset it in the lap of my sweet Betsy Baker. 
She then arose, all superfine, with pain upset the table, 
The cook came up from the kitchen below, and knock-
ed me down with a 
ladle. 
A young man staggered up to me and bid me for to 
shake her; 
Said he, young man you've scalded my dear wife as 
well as Betsy Baker. 
There's one more word I have to say that from 
heart I 
vow sir; 
I 
willingly would get a 
wife, if you'll only tell me how 
sir; 
If there's a 
nice young lady here, and she's pretty, I 
will take her, 
Provided she is fond of me and her name is Betsy Baker 
my 
The Old Arm Chair. 
My grandmother she at the age of eight- three, 
One day in May was tat.en ill and died, 
And after she was dead the will of course was read 
By a 
lawyer as we stood by his side. 
To my brother it was found she left a 
hundred pounds; 
The same unto my sister I 
declare; 
But when it came to me the lawyer says I 
see 
John. she's left vou her old arm chair. 
CHORUS— 
How they tittered, how they -chaffed, 
How tny brothers and my sisters laughed, 
When they heard the lawyer declare, 
Granny had left to me her old arm- chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair but I 
said I 
didn't care, 
And in the evening took the chair away. 
The neighbors at me chaffed and my brothers at me 
laughed, 
Saying, John it will be useful some day; 
When you settle down in life and find some girl to be 
your wife, 
You will find it handy I 
declare, 
Some cold and frosty night, when the fire is burning 
bright, 
To be seated in your old arm-chair. 
'hat my brother said came true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court and then the ring I 
bought, 
I 
took her to a 
church and then she was my wife. 
The old girl and ine were as happy as could be, 
hen my wo k 
was over I 
declare 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay 
at home, 
And be seated in the old arm- chair. 
One night the chair fell down and picking it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor, 
And there to my surprise I 
saw before my eyes 
r' 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds. or more. 
When my brother heard of this the poor fellow I 
confess 
\Vent pearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laughed and said unto him, Jim, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair. 
The Barefoot Girl. 
I'm out in the cold world, I'm out in the street, 
Asking a 
penny of overyone I 
meet; 
Shoeless I 
wander through the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
CHORUS— 
No one to pity me, no one to bless, 
No one to bless me, none to caress; 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
A child of misfortune and left all alone, 
The flowers that bloom that I 
would love to see, 
seem bowing their heads as if in pity for me; 
The music that mingle the voices of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plain, pleasant earth 
Where can I 
go and what can I 
do? 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue; 
I'm footsore and hungry, tired and weak, 
And I 
know not what shelter to—night I 
may seek. 
The Friend of all friends who rules earth and sea, 
Look with pitying eye down upon me; 
I'll wander about till my messenger comes 
To take me to father and mother at home. 
The Drunkard's Lone Child. 
Out in this gloomy world sadly I 
roam, 
I 
have no mother dear, no pleasant home; 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry 
Even if poor little Bessie would die. 
CHORUS— 
Mother, oh mother, why did you leave me alone, 
No one to love me, no friends and no home . 
Dark is the light and the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessy the drunkards lone child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trials and troubles came on, 
Mother grew paler: and weaker each day; 
Sister and I 
was too hungry to play. 
Barefooted, tired, I 
have been wand'ring all day 
Asking fo? work, but I 
am too small, they say. 
Down on the damp ground 
now lay my head.; 
Father a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh, if the temperance man only could find 
Poor wretched father and talk very kind; 
I 
they could only stop him from drinking why then 
Poor little Bessie would be happy again. 
0, man of temperance please only try, 
Or poor little Bessie will surely starve and die. 
All day I've been wand ' ring and begging for bread, 
Father a 
drunkard and mother is dead.
