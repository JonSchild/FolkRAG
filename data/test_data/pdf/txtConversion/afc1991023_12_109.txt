Background information: Ronny Harker's dad, Earl, was auctioneer 
before him, and they built the auction barn together. Neither 
attended auctioneer school so the cry heard on the recording is 
all 
informally garnered from years of going to auctions and 
practicing at home. (Now, however, some local men who have been 
to auctioneer school also come to hear Ronny and learn from him, 
as they commented to me on Sept. 22 after the smaller Thursday 
night auction, and he subscribes to a magazine connected with 
auctioneering. Business manager of auction is his wife, Charlene. 
Mary Hufford, who did the sound recording for this event, has 
logged the reel 
recordings made of 
it. For further information on 
how the auction runs, what is sold, and who comes, see PFP83-
FCC0926.

12A-13A: A grey goose is displayed close to where a small child 
is perched on one of the interior fences, and she leans close to 
the bird while the auctioneer takes bids on 
it from the adults 
in 
the audience.

18A-20A: Ron Harker and 
some of his relatives and associates

grapevine which she has just made, and will develop into a floral 
wreath for sale at her roadside table 
in G—Vincentown; 23GT. Mrs. 
King 
is not native to the region, but some of her materials are, 
and the craft itself 
is common and integral to the gathering 
profession followed by some residents, who sell their materials 
to floral wholesalers. The grapevine was gathered in Pine Barrens 
woods, where they are common, and actually benefit from 
harvesting as a tree does from pruning, as we were told by 
Chatsworth 
gatherer Harvey Webb. Mrs. King, who got started 
in 
the business through doing arrangements for her church altar and 
craft sales, was encouraged by her husband to open the roadside 
business. She often works 
in the afternoons on the roofed, open 
porch of her large house, where she can watch over the table and 
be available 
if customers come.

TX04: 19: A young man stands by a shrine to Our Lady in his 
aunt's back garden, G—Hammonton; 11GT, holding a rosary and weaving 
of blessed palm made by his uncle. 
I want to append a special note to this photograph. I found 
this picture culturally rich, knowing the individuals involved a 
little bit, and asked Tom Carroll, who grew up 
in an Italian 
Catholic family, 
if he agreed with my reading of 
it. We both 
think there's more here than meets the eye. This man's older 
female relatives are quite involved with religious life, as was 
his uncle; he himself is an "unbelieving believer" who has a 
certain hard edge to his interactive style. He is more prone to 
speak of astrology than of Catholicism, but underneath both the 
ethnic identity and the belief are there are the core. Look at 
his stance toward the photographer, the turn of his right 
shoulder and hand away from her, and the way he 
lets the sacred 
family object dangle from one hand. 
20-23: Closeups of the weaving, the statue of Our Lady, and the 
votive candle at her feet. Similar candles are also placed on 
graves in Tabernacle. 
TX05: 24: A painted wooden carving of the Last Supper, made from 
a kit by one of Mr. and Mrs. Graziano's daughters, hangs above 
their doorway between the kitchen and the living room of their 
home. G—Hammonton; 11GT The palm weaving and rosary usually hang 
from the carving. The kitchen doorway is a very widespread 
location for palm weavings (e.g. Ireland and Newfoundland) and 
rosaries or Sacred Heart pictures. 
25-26: Mrs. Graziano's kitchen cabinet, showing her family glass 
and china, and several religious pictures. 
TX06: 27-36A: Men gathering around the birdcages being set up for

porousness (sand vs. clay soils) are largely responsible for much 
of the Pinelands demography as well 
as 
its plant ecology: the 
fertile clay soils were occupied by the earliest families, who 
were mostly Quakers and went into orchard and field crop or dairy 
farming, while the acidic woodland sand soils have been occupied 
by cranberry and blueberry growers and by woods dwellers.

cranberries from a harvested bog, drawing them toward the 
elevator. (The elevator was designed and built by Mr. Dave 
Thompson of Pemberton; the corral was designed by Mr. Ernest 
DiStephano, Senior of Chatsworth, and built by the Micks.) 
4A: Francis Mick draws a cedar boom, a section of the corral, 
toward the shore after harvesting the bog. 
5A: The corral drawn into a tight circle, holding the 
last 
berries close to the elevator so they can be pushed up 
its 
conveyor belt into the packing crates set on the truck bed, and 
taken to the packing house.

from the corral as the circle 
is drawn tighter and smaller. 
15A-16A: Closeups of a cranberry scoop, used for harvesting 
before the Micks adopted the technique of flooding the bogs and 
running "beaters" through to knock the berries from the vines, 
five or ten years ago. The teeth of the scoop are combed lightly 
through the vines, separating the cranberries from their thread— 
thin stems. A good scooper can remove the berries without tearing 
the vines. Mr. Francis Mick 
is holding the scoop.
