Khamit Kinks is located on a busy street in Brooklyn. I was at the salon at 11:30am, the owner Anu Prestonia hadn’t arrived yet, 
so I photographed the shop and hairdresser, Shuly Ansel who was styling a client’s (Chris Chamber) dreadlocks. She was using 
something that looked like a crochet needle to help shape his locks by pulling the end of the lock and threading it through at the 
base of the lock in a continuous loop. The process takes about 2 hours and he comes in every 6 weeks for maintenance. 
 
I chose Khamit Kinks because this is an all-natural salon that serves a predominately black clientele. They specialize in natural 
hairstyles and they don’t do hair-straightening treatments. Although wearing natural hair is becoming more popular in the black 
community, Anu has been doing natural hair for decades. Unlike most other natural hair salons in Harlem and Brooklyn, Khamit 
Kinks is a high-end natural hair shop. It’s more expensive, and serves a higher-class clientele. 
 
Once Anu arrived we sat in her office and conducted the interview. Anu is the salon owner and no longer does hair. An injury 
forced her to stop doing hair several years ago. After she was healed and physically able to do hair, she realized that her salon 
was doing so much better because she had more time to focus on running her business. We had to wait a half an hour for the 
noise of the hairdryers to stop but once we sat down for the interview, she was very open and relaxed. Afterwards she allowed 
me to photograph her in the salon. I left around 3pm.
