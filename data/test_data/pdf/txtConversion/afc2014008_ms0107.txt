Coordinator's Report; Children's Area 1975
 
?ubtic use
 
Public use of the children's area is one indicator of it a effectiveness.
 
Use is determined by a number of factors which may or may not be controlable
 
These remarks reflect observations of the flow of traffic through the area,
 
of what people stopped for and participated in, and explanations and sugges-
t
ions for next year's festival.
 
I
.  late visiting: 
Due to the present location of the children's area in the
 
center of the  estival people arrived after visiting several other festival areas
 
'-oz:i I2:00 on.  II:00 o
'clock performances, especially on week days occured for
 
the benefit of the participants, not for festival visitors.  This was fine when
 
the children were learning games form adult participants ratter than performing
 
for a sparse audience.  Morning activities Should be self-containe,'. Those who
 
did come to the children's area early gravitated to crafts rather than per-
formance and the stage activity provided a lively environment.
 
2
.  crowding in crafts tents: The crafts tents were used to capacity and
. were
 
over crowded at peak hours.  We suggest enlarging crafts tent three to the sire
 
of crafts tent two and aevoting more tables to popular
 as well as
 
placing additional woodshop tables under the trees.
 
3. non -
participation : The stage was too high for a

..
 The s
tage and the area in front
 
for about thirty feet were in full sun most of the time.  Consequently the
 
aurw »nce sat very far from the s
tage on benches which they moved under the trees
 
The audience did not join in the hot exposed activities unless there 1
-
Jas an
 
overcast day or the performers begged and pleaded.  We s
»ggest moving the stage
 
forward five feet, doubling the width, lowering it to the height of flats and
 
shading it with a parachute or b
i;her sun shade..
 
4.  Games Ring: The games ring was under-used because of it s location behind
 
and adjacent to the stage which drew people
's attention.  Since this location
 
cannot be moved and still accomodate the needs of the rest of -t
he children's
 
area we suggest the addition of very attractive equipment and the use of
 
a-
.dit,.
IonaIL
.
.pace between the children's area and the s
tage which could be
 
roped off for soccer and football games.  This is the only area large enough
 
which _
retained it's grass.  Ropes could be removed between uses.  The road
 
in front of the children's area could also be roped off occasionally for soap
 
box der
'oy car races planned for '
76.
 
5
.  Hill_ and Sand Area:  The hill and sand area was used by more people this
 
y
t .
r b
,
::cause of it s perfect location on the road 
1 in the shade.  There were
 
c
L .
'
.
 i
 c
:ten from native Americans who came all day+ every day to build ca*ties
 
their '
baby s
itters' volunteered to teach crafts.  This area should not
 
be :

.
 ifi :
ed for the purpose of building more permanent toilet facilities.
 
On: 1,k
.lf of the enclosed apace did not get used however because of the lack
 
of 3
e
.i,l.  This area should have four loads of sand to make it serviceable for
 
sane cac
_3tle c
(-mPe:
..JJions which would require much more space than was used
 
foI ca te
ring this year.  Umbere
.l.la shade was appreciated.
 
6.  Folk Swap Tent: The folk swap tent periodically attracted crowds but was
 
especially good for the interaction of children's groups with small audiences.
 
They engaged in intimate plays and folswaps with the volunteers and graduate students.
 
They also held a birthday party and dances.  We suggest the addition of props and
 
furniture which could encourage natural dramatic play.  There was a problem with
 
sound overlap from the children's s
tage.  The tent side closest the stage should
 
be closed off with opaque siding.
 
7
.  children's groups: The children's area serviced a great number of children's
 
groups brought by summer c
amps and scout troups.�; The activities of the participants
 
themselves should be acknowledged as a primary public use of the area.  Thirty-four
 
institutions provided multiple programs with few cancellations.  Children who
 
participated in the festival in past years returned and considered the festival an
 
important event in their summer.  They have made lasting friendships with Bessie
 
Jones, the children of the arrabbers and other festival staff which increases
 
the relaxed spontaneity of the area.  Without this massive input i
t
4e dhildren'
' s
 
area would have been practically empty on weekday mornings.  These children
 
also used the crafts tents and went around to see the rest of the festival.
 
Participation in the festival constitutes a rather large program for involving
 
inner city and suburban children in a deapth experience of festival.
 
8.  after hours: 
After  the children's area closed between x
.:00 and 4:
30 the
 
visitors used it as a quiet resting pl
.-.
:e between the bustle of other festival
 
areas.  The h-i l
 l and sand area provided an activity center,as well .
'
as the hay
 
ring, for children of resting parents.  Children enjoyed  the  festival because
 
they could come to the children's area at any time and spend as long as they
 
liked.  This made the festival more enjoyable for the parents also.  We had
 
no complaints about the hours of closing
, except
 parents who had read a
 
missleading schedule in a local newspap.
 Impromptulworks
'hops with Stu
 
Jamieson and Helen Englar for the volunteers and
. v
i
.sitorsiwere well 
`�tt ended.
 
These workshops �N�
(e��z�� �
� s
enSe of community amongst volunteers'
 
olunteers which added
 
to the natural quality of the area.  This tradition will be continued in t
76.
 
The children's stage and area was also used by the Ghanaians as they toured
 
s
inging and dancing through the festival.  This after-4:00-:
:
,use could be expanded
 
for other performances touring the festival grounds.  The tours tend to draw
 
along their u
vm audiences picking up people as they go.  It is cool- and enter-
taining to walk around with a performing group from place to place.
 
9
,
i  rest rooms and food: The permanent rest room was very much appreciated.
 
Additional rest rooms had to be brought in.  There were many requests for us
 
to sell the lemonade we had on tap for area participants.  Many of the commentaries
 
on the area mentioned the need for a food concession.  We'agaiJz strungly.recommend
 
tLa'
 food concession be located'
.i  the children's area.  The arguement that
 
it will draw unwanted traffic from the main s
tage does not stand up.
 
10.  craft sales: The Cecil Craft's Shop almost sold out their entire s
tock in
 
the two weeks of the festival.  The public appreciated this variety of toys and
 
were entezTtained by the domonstrations of Mr. Cecil who sang traditional s
ongs
 
and
. played the jews harpp carved toys and danced his limberjacks.  He gave what
 
amounted to workshops at the trait's sales area.  We have inviiled the Cecils
 
t
o r
eturn in '
76.

1.  overall traffic: In general the flow of traffic through the children's area
 
and the use of the area was very smooth.  Minor adjustments in layout and tent size
 
should be made.
 
12.  Signage: The children's area lacked a learning center and had instead several
 
display panels of different sizes for displaying examples of the crafts being made,
 
the process of construction, and photographs of children's folk art and the relation—
 
ship of children and adults in the area.  These panels were helpful and effective
 
but looked unprofessional and came apart in the wind and rain.  Pictures folded and
 
blew away and were stolen.  Next year these should be ref)laned with professionally
 
made display boarc
lsand well mounted rainproof pictures.. Displayed in context They
 
are used by the public.  They would not be appreciated in a learning center.  Video
 
tapes of festival fieldwork could also be shown in the folk swap tent.
 
Resume of suggestions:
 
1;  Crafts tent three should be equal in size with crafts tent two.
 
2.  Four tables should be added under trees at crafts tent two.
 
3
.  Stage should be moved forward five feet, doubled in size by width, lowered to
 
the height of flats, shaded with a parachute or other shade device.
 
4.  Stage should be miked with one boom and one s
tanding omnidirectional mike.
 
5
. Additional game space should be secured at intervals in the festival by roping
 
off a football field between the children's area and the main s
tage and by roping
 
off the road for soap box derby races.
 
6.  Hill and sand area shoiasld have additional sand which is periodically replenished.
 
7
.  Folk swap tent needs additional props and home furniture.  Opaque flaps should
:
:'
 
cover the side facing the stage.
 
8.  Install food concession in children's area.
 
9.  Increase signage to include demonstration panels for models of the crafts being
 
taught and mounted photographs of children's folk art and children's area
 
acti vity.

A 
Volunteers and Staff
  
The children's area was run by a staff of f
our graduate students, one librarian,
 
one teacher and the coordinator and assistant coordinator with the help of thirty
 
volunteers most of whom were children.  Additional volunteers were required at peak
 
hours.  The following are a few observations and s
uggestions about the effectiveness
 
of this staff.
 
1
.  Volunteers: The children's area was manned primarily by volunteers who were
 
children
_.  This ga-xe the area a distinctive quality.  There were some innovations
 
which could have been implemented by children like the woodshop competitions and
 
some personality conflicts typical of children.  In general the children volunteers
 
participated iAth exceptional vigor and wisdom, teaching crafts, participating in
 
stage events, sharing their lore, helping to build castles and adding spontaneity
 
to a
ll the interactions.  They were particularly patient with pushy parents and
 
demanding kids.
 
This year, as last, the volunteers bore the burden of performing the role of
 
paid participants, teaching many crafts, talking and explaining to the public.
 
Dave Estabrook with the Office of E
lementary and Secondary Education offered
 
junior and s
.
enmor highshhool students volunteering for at least one week, a two
 
dollar a day stipend for counsellor—in—training experience.  We found that this
 
incentive, even though small, was very effective in motivatiooS  the youngsters
 
to a more than casual commitment.  Towards the end of the festival, when s
ome
 
became fatigued, this commitment helped to maintain their participation.  During
 
the twelve week festival we deem this stipend a necessity.  We will institute a
 
program of cooperation with prmvate schools in the area to involve groups of
 
students in two week periods of participation carpooling to the festival.
 
The competitions and parties held by the children in the children's area will
 
be elaborated upon next year in such a way as to-ide—emphasize the aquisition of
 
prizes and heavy com.
-etition and emphasize celebrations and cooperation of teams.
 
There will be parties for the winners of sand castle and soap box derby competition
;
 s
  
as well as for the birthdays of staff and volunteers.
 We'll
 have
 circuses
 and;
 
haunted houses for which visitors may have to pay a nominal fee.  We may develop
 
picnic entertainments also but we will not include slumber parties.
 
In addition to the children who volunteered, many of them from Canterbury School,
 
there were adults who were equally as responsible and competant as the hired staff.
 
Some of these people should be hired for positions next year.
 
2.  Graduate Students: Four graduate students in children's folklore worked the
 
area in the folk swap then, the hill and sand area and as roving recorders of
 
children's lore.  Two of them developed the interaction in the folk swap tent to a high
 
level of creativity including shadpw puppetry, parties, dances, folk wwaps and
 
the workshops of adult participants.  They were also able to encourage intensive
 
sand castle building.  A third student proved to be a good collector, including
 
interviews t
i
rlth older people about their childhoods.  The fourth student was
 
completely inadequate to fulfil the needs of the area.
 
We found that a person's effectiveness in the children's area is dictated more
 
by personality and charisma with children than by academic motivation and g
llnli.fi—
 >
 
cation.  The graduatF
. s
tudent work in the area will be seriously curtailed next year
 
an oidor to add much needed paid 'positions for staff who do not require travel
 
and housing.

3
o  Other s
taff In addition to the graduate s
tudents we had an MC and a games
 
ring organizer.  These jobs were professionally handled.  The other supervisorial
 
jobs were performed by volunteers.  The assistant coordinator supervised all
 
volunteers and processed all the paper work for the area.  The coordinator was
 
freed by the MC from stage presentation to video tape many of the events in the
 
area.  This break down of work roles and staff was not sufficient for a twelve
 
week festival.  It is unreasonable to expect volunteers to supervise the crafts
 
tents.  A system of relief for all s
taff must be worked out.
 
For next year we recommend this system:  Supervision should be by tried
 
staff,hired either for alternating periods of two weeks,or for three months  on
 
a four-day
.
 week schedule.  The two exceptions to this rule would be the
 
coordinator and -the assistant coordinator.  The coordinator would work four
 
festival-days and one off-day at Marymount.  The assistant coordinator would
 
work five festival-days. This system requires two s
taffs alternating with eac4other.
 
The staff should consist of the following: MC  games ring, crafts one, crafts two,
 
crafts three, hill and sand, folk swap,t one additional person who can fill in where
 
demand re ,t
u
-i
.res.  Activities in folk swap and wood shop w
ill sometimes require two
 
supervisors.  The days when members of the staff are off will require someone covering
 
positions.  The MC and folk swap and possibly games ring will be three month positions,
 
four days a week and will require coverage.  Other positions are two weeks on,two off.
 
All of these positions will be on a rotational basis.  The MC will alternate
 
one week on and one week off with the coordinator.  The other positions will rotate
 
during the day as well as by week.  This rotation is necessitated by the special
 
pressures and problems of each position, the noise of hammers in wood shop, the
 
press of people and demands in crafts, the heat and dust ac activity in games ring,
 
the heat and p,ysical activity in hill and sand, the! Ni
 ve energy output in
 
folk swap and theF
 
`
I
 atevp
'resence and adaptability to children at the stage.
 
The shift from importing and housing graduate students to hiring people from
 
the Washington area saves money which can be applied to additional salaries.  We
 
suggest that one of the rotating, two week on, two week off positions be saved
 
for one graduate student who world be housed at Marymount only on the weeks she
 
works for the festival.
 
Volunteers for 1
976 should include thirty full day positions and twenty half
 
day positions which would add up to coverage by forty volunteers each day.  The
 
full day volunteers should work for periods of no less than a week and should
 
recieve two dollars a day as well as their lunch, a program booklet and a tee-shirt.
 
As many of these volunteers as possible should come as a group from a local
 
private high school to increase the cohesiveness of the group.  The rest of the
 
voluteers, both half-day and f
r
ill day should come from the festival pool.
 
The volunteers would cover the following positions: fifteen in crafts one, two
 
each at five tables, one each at five tables, four in wood shop covering eight tables,
 
six in crafts three, four for corn husk dolls and two for large wood crafts, one for
 
hospitality to participant groups, four in h
ill and sand, four in games ring, three
 
in folk swapthree for the s
tage for particWpation in presentations as well as runn ing 
equipment when grounds crew is not covering this.  This many people is required both
 
to teach crafts and to participate in creative activities and presentations.
 
Volunteers on full day should sign up for one of these s
chedules: 1
1:00-I:00 lunch 2-
4 :0
1
 
11:00-1
.2:00 lunch 1:00-2:00, 2:00-3:00.  This leaves 12:00-2:00 particularly vulnerable
 
It who:ild be covered by the half day volunteers on there s
chedules: 1
1:00-1:00 amd
 
12:00-4:00.  Full day volunteers tended to take lunch breaks of longer than an hour
 
in order to see the rest of the festival.  This is another reason for coverage of the
 
peak hours after noon.
 
t
 
Fulfillment of 4
975 children's area proposal
  
This section will take a critical look at the implementation of the 1975
 
proposal.
 
1.  General purpose:  The children's area succeeded in fulfilling it s general
 
purpose to "de-emphasize the artificial and draw the participants, staff, volunteers
 
and visitors into a warm celebration of the folklife and lore of childhood. "
 
This was evidenced in the relaxed tone of the area and in particular activities.
 
The children and s
taff gave a double birthday party for
e volunteez in the folk swap tent
 
Helen Fnglar,who came to teach quilting,taught a workshop of games and play parties
 
recalled from her childhood,for visitors and volunteers.  Volunteers joined in workshops
 
and programs given by children at the stage.  They demonstrated an extensive know-
ledge of games they had learned in the children's area at a party after the festival.
 
Children from native Americans came over and volunteered to help with crafts, and
 
volunteers s
uggested crafts that they had done as children and taught them.
 
A volunteer initiated a wooden toys competition and took over the stage for giving
 
out awards.
 One graduate s
tudent took off hours time to interview children's area
 
participants and the Cecils foam the toy concession.  Volunteers participated in
 
an orientation day of crafts making, sand castling and folk-swapp
g . Volunteers
 
like�the area and offered to return next year.  Children would not offer this unless
 
the area reflected the vitality of children's folklife.  Visiting children spon-
taneously joined in the activities whenever the weather and spa�,e
.;pe
.rmitted.
 
Visitor participation would be even greater if the s
tage area wa-
a shaded.
 
Mr. Cecil caught the mood of the area and gave workshops in songs and toys.
 
The graduate students were able to elicit a rich dramatic play and folk swap
 
As well as a lot of sand castle building.  Some children returned to the area every
 
day of the festival.  Programs featured children presenting their own lore  a.d'
 
participants teaching children's games and dances land used participation from other
 
festival areas minimally.
 
2.  Functions: The specific functions of the area mentided in the proposal were
 
all met with the exception of providing food and drink for children.. Briefly,
 
these functions were as follows:  a*  service the physical and psychological
 
needs of children  b.  programs for children by children  ce reveal value in
 
children's folklife.  d.  teach older children's tradibi
.ons  e.  verbalize and
 
celebrate childhood experiences of staff, volunteers and participants
 
3
.  Implementation: The innovations this year did solve some of the problems we
 
encountered last year in el iciting certain genre of children's lore.  This vastly
 
enriched the area in expressive culture.  Specifically, the addition of the
 
folk swap tent, the tree house and the folk toy demonstrations enriched the area
 
in dramatic play, puppetry, folk swaps, parties, tree house play.  The managing
 
of the hill and sand by graduate students greatly improved the creative castle
 
building.  All the proposals for implementation were carried out.  One element was
 
e
rr. Fes
 
�
 .
 
not�suc
sful, that was the guidelines to teachers.  Few of the children's groups
 
came prepared to present their own prognnms
 I but
. a sensitive handling by the MC
 
and the coordinz  .
)
r made it possible fo-•  o
 presentation by children and festival
 
staff.  The worst presentation was MC'd  „ a pushy scout master who had taught the
 
children a lot of artificial '
children';, :
L
ore'.  The absence of any more of these
 
pseudo-children's-lore presentations speaks for the partial effectiveness of the
 
guidelines.  None of the schools where we did field work came with artificial lore.
 
The material culture of children  was not explored in as many aspects as proposed.
 
T
:nis was primarily because the volunteers were not adequately prepared to teach
 
scmr-
, of the crafts.  In 1976 we will have crafts workshops every morning at 10:00
 
for volunteers to teach all of the crafts to be taught in the crafts tent that day.
 
These workshops will also provide us with a replenishing supply of demonstration
 
modals of craft items.

The balance of crafts one was not appropriate to boys and girls equally.  There
 
should be more unisex and male oriented crafts and fewer types of dolls being
 
made at the same t-i
r
n-m
;
.Doll types could be rotated and include even greater variety.
 
Male and fert
iale collds could be displayed and made.  There should be three types
 
of corn shuck dolls of varying complexity.  Corn shuck dolls should be taught on
 
an assembly line set up with four volunteers.  Additional crafts recommended for
 
next year are as follows: pencil and paper games riddles and drawings, connecting
 
dots, tic tac toe, hang man, war forts, fold down add on portraits, moving pictures
 
and books of moving pictures, comics, guess what drawings.  puppets, shadow,
 
sox, felt, paper bag.  paper folding classroom craft, airplanes, cootie catchers,
 
water bombs, hats, animals, boats, cameras.  toothpick constructions, macrame,
 
clothespin aircraft and vehicles ? crochet, knitting, painting for very small children.
 
Soap and g
rater, trash cans and demonstration and instruction boards of pro—
 
fessional design should be added to the area.
 
2.  Crafts two: Wood shop
 
T
yr
:
_- wood shop provided wood, saws, clamp. and nails for parents and children
 
to construct their own toys.  The volume of constructions made it this area
 
was enormous, as last year.  We found that having wood scrap unloaded on the
 
ground by a local lumber company was an excellent way of getting wood.  We had
 
to carefilly supervise keeping wood from being thrown back on the pile with nails
 
driven into it.  A few pertinent suggestions for next year are as follows:
 
a. Sighs instructing people not to throw naily wood on the pile.
 
b. Earplugs for volunteers and staff
 
c
. Four additional tables under the trees, more saws and hammers, .
f
our trash cans
 
d. Varied sizes of wood and special accessories and moldings ateglue and nail table.
 
e. Storage for toys left to be picked up
 
f
. Delete toy making competitions because they can't be started and ended at set
 
times.—there is_too much noise, it causes tensions in parents and children.
 
g , Soap, '
�
ww cr and'a large towel at wood painting table
 
h. Models of traditional wooden boats, vehicles and `
.aircraft etc. on display
 
i. More volunteers in area at all times
 
3
. Crafts three: Claude Yoder, whittler
 
Crafts three was a smaller tent added after the proposal was written.  Mr. Yoder
 
displayed his wood s
culptures and helped children file shapes i
tto small pieces
 
of wood.  The problems of this oper-i
tdon outweighed the assets.  Mr. Yoder could
 
not have children use a whittling knife even with direct supervision of parents.
 
His tools were used and stolen.  Demands were made of him which he could not
 
fulfilJ_ al 4
r it Wi

 t
s.r'
 and harrassing for him.  In favor of the event, children
 
saw a craft sman 
 
who was willing to show them how he was working and the
 
results.  They we
 ��y interested.
 
0 
It is this s
ort of seminal experience which may lead a child to pursue an inner
 
vision at some later date.  However, we suggest for next year that we limit
 
the use of such craftsmen as Mr. Yoder to demonstation, as in other festival
 
areas and use crafts tent three for activities which children can participate in
 
more fully.  We suggest enlarging thin tent to the size of crafts two and locating
 
assembly line corn husk doll-making
 f
c
v
�Ah children moving foom one table to another
 
for the dif
fferent stages of making their dolls to relieve the congestion and the
 
strain caused by a constant influx of children.  In addition to corn shuck dolls
 
which was a very popular activity, we suggest alternating two week periods of
 
soap box-derby-car making and animal and doll house making of all sorts.  A third
 
function to con
.=
•'
.der for this area if we can find the informants would be old--
fashioned model _

.long from s
cratchlas in balsa--i
,rood aircraft.  We will attempt
 
through newspap-_
1 advertizing and other sources to locate doll-house builders,
 
s
oap-box-derby car non-professionals and people who made or make their own
 
models from their own designs.

.
 Hill and sand: Castles, water works, earth works
 
The hill and sand area functioned much better than it did last year primarily
 
because of the encouragement and invnl
.
.vement of the graduate s
tudents and
 
volunteers.  They reported many fantastic castles to us.  We couldn't tell if
 
these represented specific traditions or not and I think that the four traditions
 
that I taught at the workshop were not transmitted.  The inadequacies of the
 
area were as follows : negligence about turning off the water at night and storing
 
the water valve operator, failure to trasmit the t
 -
aditi
.ons that were taught,_.
 
failure to develop earth works, lack. of enough vo"l
 -1
r
itee=s working the area at
 
a
_
71 times.  We suggest increasing the amount of s
and in the area and having
 
sand castle competitions and earth work competitions and a 10:00 workshop each
 
d
ray for volunteers in as many technigilas and traditions as possible.
 This
 
would provide the s
tarter castles and earth works for the day and ensure the
 
teaching of a greater variety of activities.  For example, these activities could
 
be encouraged: sand s
culpture, sand drawings and writing, drip and hand f
ill  
technique, building sand landscapes, sand castles, tunnels a
?id bridges, moats
 
and rivers, roads, forts, holes p bur ying people .

. Gamy r
ang :
 
The ga=me ring was used by groups of children s
cheduled to give programs of games
 
and,visitors.  The children's groups were not particularly enthusiastic ahout
 
gitring programs in the dust and sun.  The best programs o
.ccured when two
 
gropes met with each other to play eachother and when we had the football team from
 
S.E. In the latter case the game ring was too grassless for their game and we
 
shifted it to the proposed football field between children's and main stage.
 
The basket ball tree was very popular as well as the tree house and fort — building
 
a-'
-A_vity.  The games r
ing coordinator suggested shheduling in only groups of
 
children who would teach eachother games.  We feel this could be done by
 
getting police clubs, recreation centers and YMCA's and YWCA's by t
;
•ros to meet
 
for programs in the games ring.  These groups would provide their o
 M bussing and
 
would be oriented towards a games program.  We would not s
chedule in indii-Ldual
 
schools.  Same supervision cuuld be provided by the counselors and the games
 
r
ing supervisor could ensure the sharing of neighborhood games with mixed teams
 
fraii both groups rather than group competition against eachother.
 
The ;
al
l
ies ring would be used more by visitors with -the addition of a variety
 
of
 e
c�

for small  roues already mentioned in this report.  The tree house

A front opening lock box could house the soap box derby cars in the games ring.
 
There was some problem with parents dropping their children off to wait for
 
them in the game ring.  This could be discouraged verbally and by signs.
 
6. Stage:  The stage presentations were primarily by groups of girls who came from
 
the s
chools where we did fieldwork.  Some of the s
chools had a good representation of
 
boys but the stage did not provide an arena for them to share their lore.  This
 
absence can be explained by the lack of boys participation in the genre most
 
commonly included in stage performances, jump rope, clapping and ring games and
 
cheers and their reluctance to join in dancing so 4ptubl.ically.  Drumming, sparring ,
.
 
gymna s
tic s
tunts.
., and singing pop songs which are,#oys domain. were too private
 
to be shown off from a stage.  The problems of 5he ght and audience distance
 
exacerbated the allienation of the boys.  Changing the stage conditions next
 
year may help.  It would al:
.,.
,
) help to get more boys.  We may be able to achieve
 
this by including drumming, sparring gymnastic stunts and pop singing in all
 
field work.  We should have a phonograph and records at the stage at all times
 
so that we can try putting on music at the end of each presentation.
 
Audience participation should also automatically be a part of every presentation
 
A lower stage and shade will also encoup-age this activity.  The children could
 
not be heard unless one child stood with the mike and chanted the game.  A boom
 
i
rike is.crucially important in the children's area where many of the presentations
 
are in a cluster or a ring and involve several participants.
 
The performances which we did have were spontaneous and unembarrased for the
 
best part.  The girls had many of them participated in the festival last year
 
and accepted the challenge of turning on an audience or just amusing eachother
 
in a joyous, sometimes slap happy way.  It was fantastic.  Jean Alexander always
 
succeeded in making the girls feel relaxed and at home and helped them keep the
 
program flowing at a rapid rate.  Se can attempt next year to have a little more
 
interview and commentary on these programs without getting dull and academic.
 
We did succeed in having a
lmost continuous performances on the stage from 11:00 a.m.
 
tit 4:00 p.m.
 
In addition to the children's performances there were workshops by Stu
 
Jamieson, Bessie Jones, Vanessa Jones and Paul Ofori Ansah.  These were taught
 
to the participant children's groups with s
ome audience participation.  The
 
vitality of the workshops was very much enhanced by having a t
primer' group
 
of children to learn the games.  It enriched the experience of the children
 
at the festival and made it even more interesting to come down
..  People did
 
come specifically for these performances as scheduled and were confused by the
 
absence of a children's area schedule for the second week in the program booklet.
 
It was in the booklet as a second thought to fill the gap left by the cancellation
 
of Panama.  We feel it is important to include it in the booklet for next summer.
 
7. Fo;.k swap tent: The folk swap tent proved to be the vehicle we projected
 
for eliciting children's humor anJ the folk life of the classroom.  It was an
 
intimate setting where gra date students familiar with the genre could informally
 
interact with groups of children and individuals who shared their lore.  It
 
was possible to have as many as three activities going at onee.  The repertoires
 
from the stage presentations were rehearsed and taught here, there were
-shadow
 
p
tq
.,petry and dramatic play, costumed parades, dances, parties, joke swaps and
 
se rous discussions.  There were also workshops by the adult participants
 
and a fe
_w programs from other festival areas.  The folk swap tent
 
30 ac+e  as
 ever en y re  urce.  Children  cheduled in there could be
 
borrowed
or Mine s
 ,age wren o�er groups cancelled out.
 
Performances which arrived off s
chedule from other festival areas could be
 
accomodated '
in folk swap.
 
8. Participation from other festival areas:  The participation which was pre—
 
planned did not occur in many instances.  This happened last year as well,and
 
we had greatly reduced participation for this year.  We d
i
al have the following
 
performances:  costumed German band and dancers three times, Native American
 
dancers twice, Lucille Dawson teaching sign language once, One Japanese American
 
origami craftsman once, One sailor teaching rope knotting three times.  These
 
participants didn't really understand why they had been sent or brought over
 
to the children's area.  The only workshop which really worked was the native
 
.
American darting.  The other presentations s
eemed out of place,either to the
 
people who came to teach,or in the context of the children's area.  Since the
 
children of native Americans came every 6—  to the children's area,which was
 
close to them and held interest for them,
 recom;
�er_d continuing Indian
 
participation in the children's area and possibly having a workshop on games
 
taught by the children.  Any participation from native Americans should be on
 
a once a day Pasis at a consistent time slot if this can be worked out.
 
We would also like to try to have workshops presented by the arrabber's
 
children once a week.  Any children coming with groups to Regional or to
 
Old Ways should be reffered to us for possible programming.  Last year we
 
got together a great soccer game with the Greek boys.  We could have a
 
workshop with them and then invite them to our daily party as a thank you.
 
9. Documentation:  Dacumentation was a major aspect of the children's area
 
this year.  The coordinator, assisstant coordinator and the four graduate
 
students have collected a mass of children's lore on video tape from field
 
work and the festival and on sound tape from the festival.  We will publish
 
for next year's children's area a book of children's folklife and lore from
 
the folk swap tent
, and a book of cheer—leading cheers with illustrations
 
by the football—folk—artist.  We will also re—issue Jean Alexander's
 
collection which got ruined in storage last year.  We gave away all those
 
copies to children participants in the area this year and sold the few
 
that were in reasonably good condition.
 
We have video tapes of Stu Jamieson, Paul Ofori
 Ansah, Bessie Jones and
 
children,during field work and at the festival,which co11d be edited into
 
lively half hour tapes on different subjects.  The coordinator could do
 
the editing.  The uses to which these could be put have not been discussed.
 
The legal aspects of any use of this material have not been examined.
 
Conclusions:  The children's area ran very much as proposed this year.  Each
 
component drew out a richer variety and performance from children than in
 
1
97+, partially because many of the children had performed in '
74 and were
 
com ,ortable, partially because of s
tructural changes.  There were enough
 
adult participants to give the children a unique learning experience and
 
to fill the programming needs of the area,as well as demonstrating the
 
loving and sp-irited way in which grown ups can t
z41c,
'
;Arehildren games from
 
a different era without making theta a deadly dill_ exercise.  The crafts were
 
all well recieved.  We can explore what adult craftsmen we can get in a greater
 
variety of child oriented crafts to include in '
76.
 
PROPOSAL FOR CHILDREN
."S AREA FAF 197ra-
General Purpose  
The Festival presents folklife and lore and aesthetic tradition in a way
 
as closely approaching unself-conscious transmission as possible in an artificial
 
situation of stage, workshop and roped off craft area.
 The
. experience of the
 
demonstrating participant is the key to the Festival.
 His experience must emphasize
 
the value of his craft and aesthetic and of the natural celebrations by which they
 
become part of the flow of community life.  Explaining aspects of folklife, teaching
 
others, demonstrating objects that he is making and singing songs he has endowed
 
with his unique interpretation before an audience put the participant in a new position
 
of value.
 Meeting other people as unique and skilled as himself broadens his community
 
and engenders a feeling of camaraderie.  Participants relax, play together and
 
enjoy each other.
 This cross-fertilization and creation of the unique Festival
 
community encompasses the volunteers and the staff and is communicated to Festival
 
visitors as a unique and human experience of "real life."  The artificial barriers
 
of stage and rope fall away, and everyone participates in a celebration of traditions.
 
The Children's Area is committed to this concept of Festival.  Although the
 
situation is by nature artificial, the attempt is to de-emphasize the artificial
 
and draw the participants, staff, volunteers and visitors into a warm celebration
 
of the folklife and lore of childhood.
 No area of lore lends itself to this approach
 
more than child lore for everyone has been a child.
 
Purposes of the Children's Area
  
1. To transmit to visitors a joyous celebration of the childhood experiences of the
 
staff, the volunteers and the participants in which they can freely participate.
 
2. To demonstrate and to teach children's folklife and lore in programs for children
 
by children.
 
3. To demonstrate, teach and compare games recalled from childhood and reconstructed
 
from recollections, in programs by older people.
 
4. To teach children's games from the countries of origin of groups in America.
 
5. To demonstrate the creative process by which children construct multi-faceted
 
social experiences.
 
F. To reveal the
. folklife of the classroom and discuss used of folklore
. and oral
 
history for a more relevant and rewarding school life.
 
7. To incorporate programs from other Festival areas which pertain to children's lore.
 
0
 
-2-
8
. To care for the physical and psychological needs of children; to eat, drink,
 
toilet, teach and learn, play and rest and find lost grown-ups.
 
The structural components of the Children's Area housing these programs will
 
remain the same as last year: the Hill and Sand Area, Folk Swap Tent, Stage, Games  .
 
Ring, Hay Ring, picnic area and three Crafts Tents.  These areas provide the necessary
 
private and public arenas for esoteric and exoteric performances by children so that
 
the artificiality and staged quality of an interaction of strangers falls away and
 
performances of trust and friendship can flourish.
 
Programs in the Children's Area will be provided by children's groups from
 
42 schools as well as from recreation centers, Y's, police clubs, scout troops and
 
summer camps.  They will be tailored to the attention span of children and derive from
 
their repertoire of games and lore, their perceptions of themselves and their ideas
 
for presentation.
 
Other programs will be provided by adult participants who vividly recall
 
the games lore and material culture of their childhood or who have made a study of
 
American children's games from past generations.  In addition they would present
 
a new component, children's games from the countries of origin of American groups
 
taught from film and videotape.  Children who learn these games will then teach them
 
to visitors.  To this end a search will be made for recorded material.
 
In addition to these events which are relatively simple, we want to incorporate
 
activities which sprang up spontaneously and by design in the Children's Area in 19 7/5 
demonstrating the essence of Festival community, warm feeling, playfulness and
 
celebration: parties, picnics, parades, play fights, learning games to be taught,
 
dramatic events, announcements, rehearsals and competitions.  These activities will
 
be used in. -cummulative multi-staged events, enhansed by participants, staff and
 
volunteers who have worked in the area before and feel relaxed with children
 
in these activities.

Implementation of the Program
  
I
. Fieldwork
  
A. Fieldwork in 30 new schools in addition to the 12 last year will provide
 
three school groups a day, each doing two presentations in different
 
settings and each returning for five days.  We will provide bussing
 
from the school to the Festival and back when necessary.  Teachers will
 
receive $
30 per diem to locate, prepare and chaperone the children and
 
to distribute and collect permission slips.
 
B
. A video and film search in the British Isles and other countries will
 
provide visual materials for teaching children's games from the countries
 
of origin of American population.  Children will learn these games in
 
the Folk Swap Tent and then teach them from the Stage.
 
C
. A video and film search of other areas of the United States will provide
 
visual materials to show differences and similarities in children's games.
 
D. Fieldwork will emphasize these aspects of children's lore: neighborhood
 
games and sports, verbal traditions such as jokes, taunts, counting out,
 
chanted games, cheers, musical traditions such as drumming, rock bands,
 
pop singing, and other genure, dancing, sparring, gymnastics.  It will
 
also explore material cultural traditions and folklife related to adults
 
in the home and school such as teacher harassment schemes, how to obtain
 
cash, entertainments and practical jokes.
 
E
. Guidelines will be given to teachers and librarians for children's
 
programs given in the Folk Swap Tent, the Games Ring and on the Stage.
 
F
. Programs of children's lore will be presented at other schools by some
 
groups who will appear at the Festival to give them experience to raise
 
the status of children's lore and to share and collect from other children.
 
G
. Additional camps, recreation centers, police clubs, scout troops and Y's
 
will bus their own children to participate in the Children's Area for
 
two hour slots.  These groups will be scheduled primarily on weekdays
 
until approximately 2 P
.M.
 
H. Fieldwork will locate adults to teach traditions from their childhood:
 
games, songs, dances, doll house making, model and soap box derby car
 
construction as well as crafts traditionally taught to children by adults:
 
quilting, embroidery.
 
• 
-4-
I
. Fieldwork will locate children to demonstrate and teach components of
 
children's art: comic strip characters, monsters, racing cars, horses,
 
athletics, etc.
 
II. Programs and Physical Plant 
The locations for programs in the Children's Area will be designed for
 
diverse activities ranging from private creation to public presentation.  Some
 
workshops will be complete in themselves; other activities will be cummulative
 
and multi-faceted, taking place in a series of locations.
 
A. Multi-faceted events involving groups of children participants.
 
Activities from the 1975 Children's Area will be used in two or five
 
stage events which enrich the children's interaction, relaxation and
 
pleasure and release their ludic creativity in planning, rehearsal,
 
presentation and celebration.  For example, the same group of children
 
would participate in one of the following series of activities:
 
1
. a
. Create play or event: hand or shadow puppet show, drama, circus,
 
haunted house, fashion show in Folk Swap Tent. (

Recommendations for physical structure:
 
1
. 20' x 40' tent, the increase in size dictated by the increase in
 
planned activities.
 
2
. Hand puppet theatre in corner closest to the Stage.
 
3
. Eight 4 x 8
' flats for shadow shows, dramatic play, parties, workshops,
 
haunted houses, circuses, placed in half of tent closest to the Main
 
Festival Stage.
 
4
. Two lock boxes: one on stage should be low and flat for storage of video
 
and projection equipment and for a table surface for video monitor; the
 
other in the corner opposite hand puppet stage to contain costumes for
 
dress-up play and parade.
 
5
. Two tarpaulines: one on stage to cover plywood flats over cracks between
 
flats; the other on the ground for dress-up area so that costumes
 
will not get dirty.
 
6
. Small logs on ground for audience to sit on and move to convenient
 
positions for different activities.
 
7
.Light weight furniture for play sets and quilt tops for creating spaces
 
and props, as well as for decoration.
 
8
. Equipment needed: 2 picnic tables, 1 long folding table, 1 card table,
 
2 benches, 4 folding chairs.
 
E
. Games Ring
  
The Games Ring will be oriented more toward activities for small groups
 
of Festival visitors than last year.  Fewer groups of children will be
 
scheduled in for programs of games, and they will be scheduled two groups
 
at a time to play games with each other.  The groups will come from games
 
oriented organizations such as scout troops, recreation centers, Y's, and
 
police clubs.
 Space in addition to the Games Ring will be roped off for
 
football and soccer games between the Children's Area-and the Main Stage.
 
1
. Tether ball, volleyball, frizbee, basketball, water gun fights, hop scotch,
 
four square, tire and inner tube activities, rope swing, tug of war.
 
2
. Tree house climbing, comic books and giant cards, fort building, block
 
house building.
 
3
. Programs of neighborhood games played by two groups meeting each other.
 
r
 
-8-
4
. Possible participation from other Festival areas.
 
5
. Football and soccer games played in annex.
 
Recommendations for physical structure:
 
1
. Enclose the same area with fencing as last year.
 
2
. Drive in six stakes which can be used to rope in football annex between
 
the Children's Area and the Main Stage.
 
3
. Add deck to tree house with quilt awning and locmn box with comic
 
books and giant playing cards.
 ,
 
4
. Sink a tether ball pole in cement.  Cap of pole with ring for rope
 
of tether ball will be interchanged with a cap fitted with loops
 
for rope swinging.
 
5
. Cover playing area of Games Ring especially around basketball trees
 
with a layer of sand, about two tons (
one truckload) to start with
 
and an additional two tons after six weeks of Festival or as required.
 
This will cut down the dust and mud with a medium that drains quickly
 
and dries out without making "goop."  It is safe to run and fall on
 
and doesn't impede playing games.
 
6
. Erect standards and net for volleyball playing.
 
F
. Hill and Sand Area
  
The Hill and Sand Area should consist of large piles of sand and
 
earth enclosed by a fence with a pool and water available from a hose
 
and supplied with Tonka toys and sand castle equipment.  Enrichment of
 
activities in the Hill and Sand Area in 1976 will come from daily morning
 
workshops for volunteers and staff in sand castle techniques and other
 
earth and sand traditions taught in the workshop.  The castles, etc.
 
made in the workshop will be demonstration models and will be taught to
 
visiting children.  In addition there will be a sand castle contest each
 
day in the afternoon.  Sand castling and earthwork activities will be:
 
1
. Sand:  Sand castles, holes, tunnels, sand sculptures and landscapes.
 
2
. Earth hills: Roads and tunnels, dumps, quarries, bridges, rivers,
 
canyons and other geological shapes.
 
3
. Sand castle competitions.
 
4
. Morning sand and earth workshop for volunteers and s
taff producing
 
castles and earth works for the opening of the Festival each day.
 
5
. Marbles games taught and demonstrated.  Advertisements in local
 
-9-
newspapers and questioning in schools will locate experts in marble games.
 
Recommendations for physical structure:
 
1
. Fence in the same area as in 1975.
 
2
. Fill area with sand enough to build many more castles, twice as much
 
sand as in 1975 to be renewed at two week intervals with another load
 
of sand.
 
i
 
3
. Low fence enclosed 20' x 20' area at rear of Hill and Sand for marble
 
demonstrations, teaching and competitions.
 
4
. Benches and umbrella table for waiting parents.
 
5
. Exhibit panel of pictures which should be weather resistant.
 
6
. Lock box in administration tent to house Tonka toys, buckets, trowels
 
and shovels.
 
G
. Crafts Tents
  
The following changes will be made in the Crafts Tents in order to
 
present a greater variety of children's and traditional adult crafts that
 
are taught to children:
 
1
. There will be more unisex crafts.
 
2
. There will be more crafts that are traditionally considered boys' crafts.
 
3
. Corn husk doll making will be moved to Crafts Tent 3, using four tables
 
for teaching in an assembly line.
 There will be male and female
 
doll making and a greater variety of dolls for different levels of
 
expertise.
 
4
. Crafts Tent 3 instead of housing a participant teaching a craft such as
 
whittling will house on alternating two week periods soap box derby
 
car making and doll house construction.
 The cars will be raced on
 
weekends and will be given to a charity after the Festival.
 The
 
doll houses will be used for doll play in Crafts Tent 3 and will also
 
be given away after the Festival.
 Small houses, furniture and doll rooms
 
made in the area will be taken home by the children.
 
5
. The parawing will house a craftsman who can teach balsa model making.
 
We hope to find such a person through an advertising campaign.
 
6
. The woodshop in Crafts Tent 2 will have a greater selection of sizes and
 
shapes of wood, more hammers and more accessories for wood decorating.
 
7
. There will be a crafts workshop at 10:00 each morning for staff and

volunteers to learn crafts they will teach during the day.  Objects
 
made during this workshop will be used for demonstration boards and
 
as prizes for competitions.
 
Activities for Crafts Tent 1 (
Parawing):
 
1
. Dolls to be taught three types at a time: yarn, clothes pin, cloth,
 
stuffed, felt and paper dolls.

I
. Picnic and Food Concession Area
  
Children have a much shorter energy cycle than adults and require
 
food and drink at frequent intervals.  They will become unhappy and possibly
 
ill if they have been exhausted by participation in the Children's Area
 
and cannot get food and drink.  It is an ethical consideration in the Children's
 
Area that if we tire children out and dehydrate them, we must have facilities
 
available to quickly replenish their strength.  To expect hot and tired
 
children to go to a large general public food facility with its accompanying
 
crowds and confusion is to be unresponsive to their needs.  To provide
 
merely fruit and ice cream and not drinks and more substantial child-oriented
 
foods is also to be unresponsive.  Therefore a return to the more inclusive
 
menu and food facility provided in 1974 is necessary.
 
Shaded tables, water fountains and accessibility to toilet facilities
 
will also be provided.
 
-12-
J
. Participation from Other Festival Areas
  
We will encourage participation from other Festival areas if
 
there are child participants or adults who can teach children an activity
 
in which they can fully participate.  We will not seek out performances
 
so much as audience participation workshops.
 
K. Concessions  
Traditional children's toys will be sold in the Administration-
Sales Tent in the Children's Area by the Cecil Kraft Shops of Wileysville,
 
West Virginia.  Mr. Cecil will demonstrate the making of the toys and
 
how they are used, often with his own musical accompaniement.
 
III.  Documentation and Publications
  
We will publish a Folk Swap Book with illustrations by
 
children.  We will also reissue Jean Alexander's booklet on jump rope
 
rhymes and ring games, Jump, Clap and Sing.
 
We hope to be able to produce a record  which will document
 
highlights of fieldwork involving local 5th and 6th grade children.
 
We will produce an approximate half hour videotape of
 
outstanding examples of children's folklore edited from footage taken
 
in classrooms and at the Festival.  The videotape will show jump rope
 
rhymes, ring and clapping games, cheers and drumming, table games,
 
jokes, ghost stories, and Bessie Jones and Stu Jamieson working with
 
groups of children at the Festival.
 
IV.
 Staff
  
Supervision of the Children's Area shall be by the coordinator,
 
assistant coordinator and 8 supervisors.
 The coordinator would work
 
four Festival days and one "down day" at Marymount.  The assistant coordinator
 
would work five Festival days.  The 8 salaried supervisors will work for
 
either twelve weeks on a four day schedule or for two weeks on and two weeks
 
off.
 (
Note: This latter schedule will mean that there will be two people
 
filling the same position.)  Staff will supervise on a rotating schedule
 
activities on the Stage, in the Games Ring, the Folk Swap Tent, Crafts Tents

0
 
-13-
staff members, anyone indisposed, lunch relief or to assist at
 
extremely busy locations.
 
Only one or possibly two of the staff will be a graduate
 
student.  The shift from importing and housing graduate students to
 
hiring people from the Washington area saves money which can be
 
applied to additional salaries.  We have anticipated that one of
 
the rotating, two weeks on, two weeks off positions be saved for
 
the graduate student who will be housed at Marymount only on the
 
weeks she works for the Festival.
 
Supervisors would have these responsibilities:
 
1

Training in children's folklore for volunteers will be providad
 
daily at 10:00 in the form of morning workshops for staff and volunteers
 
where crafts to be presented that day will be taught and learned.
 
Training will also include viewing videotapes from fieldwork and
 
training in differentiating children's lore from school craft.
 
Possible sources of volunteers are varied.  Local private
 
high schools will be contacted to organize groups of students who will
 
volunteer as a group preferably for a two week period.  Participation
 
of children as volunteers from other Festival areas will be sought.
 
Local universities will be contacted to explore the involvement of
 
graduate or undergraduate students on a college credit basis.
 
Preferred fields of specialization for the Children's Area would be
 
education, creative drama and folklore.  Volunteers who have worked
 
in the Children's Area in previous years will be contacted.  The
 
remainder will come from the Festival pool.
 
Volunteers will perform many tasks, differing by area and
 
will be encouraged to try them all.  They will teach crafts,
 
participate in games and performances, encourage audience participation,
 
-15-
help organize shows, parties and parades, teach sand castling and earth-
works, set up and clean up the Children's Area, share their own lore
 
and learn from both young and adult participants, run sound and
 
recording equipment, generally share in the responsibility of running
 
the area.
 
The volunteers would cover the following positions:
 
I
 
Crafts Tent One: 2 each at 5 tables, 1 each at 5 tables.
 
Crafts Tent Two (wood shop): 4 covering 8 tables.
 
Crafts Tent Three: 4 for corn husk dolls, 2 for large wood crafts.
 
Hospitality: 1
 
Hill and Sand: 4
 
Games Ring: 4
 
Folk Swap Tent: 3
 
Stage: 3
 
Total number of volunteers needed: 40
 
Volunteers should include 30 full day positions and 20 half
 
day positions which would add up to coverage by 40 volunteers each day.
 
The fall day volunteers should work for periods of no less than a week
 
and should receive two dollars stipend a day as well as their lunch,
 
a program booklet and a tee-shirt.
 (
The stipend applies to young
 
people of student age.)
 
Scheduling should be as follows:
 
Volunteers on foll day should sign up for one of these schedules:
 
11:00-1:00
 
1
:00-2:00 lunch
 
2
:00-4:00
 
11:00-12:00
 
12:00-1:00 lunch
 
1
:00-3:00
 
3
:00-4:00
 
The hours 12:00-2:00 are particularly vulnerable.  They
 
sould be covered by the half day volunteers working either 11:00-2:00
 
or 12:00-4:00.
 If half day volunteers are not in sufficient number,
 
volunteers for 12:00-2:00 will be utilized.

It is with eager anticipation that the staff of the Children's
 
Area looks forward to the challenge of the twelve week 1976 Festival.  The
 
well-received programs of ]
_974 and 1975 give promise that the coming celebration
 
can surpass the others as the scope of purposes and activities enlarges.
 
The Children's Area proposes to continue and expand th6 elements already
 
proven successful and to initiate many promising innovations.  Given the
 
components necessary to support this proposal-adequate budget, staff and
 
volunteers-the 1976 Children's Area should fulfill the goals expected of it.
 
COORDINATORS REPORT:
 CHILDREN'S AREA
 1976 FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN FOLKLIFE
,
 
The 1976 Festival of American Folklife was twelve weeks long.
 Thu
 
effects of functioning for this length of time were cumulative and
 
nourishing to the Children's Area,  and I would like to concentrate upon
 
those effects before going into the body of the'report which will follow
 
the outlines of the proposal for this year.
 
First, I want to remark upon the extraordinary growth of the staff
 
in versatility:
 handling all of the interactional tasks in the area
 
and in flexibility when faced with constantly changing conditions and
 
unforeseen changes in schedule.
 
Each staff person concentrated efforts in an area of expertise and,
 
as he/she grew into that role, branched out to participate in other roles,
 
becoming more expressive and adventurous as the summer advanced with the
 
effect that the social milieux entered by children as visitors and
 
participants was lively, creative, loving, playful and encouraging.
 This
 
atmosphere was contagious.
 Children opened up and enjoyed themselves,
 
willingly sharing the contents of their more private folklife.
 Group
 
leaders and parents also participated in this joyous social interplay.
 
Under these conditions it was possible to fulfill the outlines of the
 
original proposal in ways that were unforeseen.
 Spontaneous events of
 
some complexity, requiring cooperation and trust of all present, were
 
possible and provided the high points of the summer for staff and
 
visitors.
 One example will suffice to illustrate:
 On one of the two
 
Sundays the Festival was closed down by rain, the staff,  the participants and
 
many volunteers showed up before the downpour and were reluctant to
 
give up the Chinese opera face painting that had been planned.
 So in
 
celebration of our friendship with a staff member who was leaving, we
 
had the workshop, donned costumes,  created, rehearsed and presented an
 
improvised Peking Opera in the Folk Swap Tent in the pouring rain.
 
Regional America Staff sent over lunches and a good time was had by all.

Staff Roles  
The following roles were fulfilled by members of the staff with
 
great competence:
 
1
. Meeting all incoming groups of participant children and adjusting
 
their participation to the existing conditions in the Children's
 
Area with their leaders.
 Presentation of the groups from the
 
stage, adapting to the length of programmatic material they had
 
prepared and the schedule for workshops by participants who would
 
teach the children.
 Jean Alexander
 
2
. Telephoning all groups in advance to confirm their participation
 
and to remind them of the participants who would be teaching
 
the children.
 Betty Roffman
 
3
. Orientation and supervision of all new volunteers.
 There was a
 
weekly changeover of some portion of the 32 volunteers in the area.
 
These volunteers were, as planned, primarily children age 12-14,
 
and required a special care and sensitivity in handling.
 
Saucie Melnicove
 
4
. Organization of materials and creation of a special private creative
 
atmosphere conducive to folkswap of riddles and stories, creation
 
of puppet shows and dramatic plays, costumed parades and talent
 
shows.
 Rosa Scott, Dorothy Stroman, Andrea Meditch, Suzy Seriff.
 
5
. Organization of materials for, and instruction in the making
 
of doll houses and furniture.
 Creation of a town in miniature
 
for doll play.
 Instruction in go-cart construction and the
 
supervision of races.
 Tom Murphy and Tinson Mortenson
 
6
.Organization of materials for and supervision or instruction
 
of workshops in wooden toy making, doll and jewelry making,
 
embroidery, quilting and other children's and grandmother crafts.
 
Paula Fasser, Marcella Nichols, Weibke Noak, Margaret Holub,
 
Ann Mitchell, Helen Englar, Suzy Seriff, Lynn Mailloux, Jean Kaplan.
 
7
. Supervision, instruction and presentation of games on stage
 
and in the Games Ring and football/volleyball annex.
 Willie Demps,
 
Peter Crowley, Kim Storey.
 
8
. Creation and protection of an environment of sand castles which
 
could be added to during the day in the Hill and Sand Area.
 
Dorothy Stroman, Lynn Mailloux, Kate Rinzler.
 
These above roles were taken over by other staff members as they became
 
10
 
-3-
versatile and, by the end of the Festival, many staff members were capable
 
of handling several diverse roles.
 
9
. Acting as catalyst in workshops on the stage.
 The entire staff,
 
particularly Kate Rinzler, Jean Alexander, Betsy Nadas.
 
10. Video component.
 Betsy Nadas, Rick Moseley, Kate Rinzler.
 
The camaraderie of the staff indicates that the Children's Area amply fulfilled
 
its general purpose "
...to de-emphasize the artificial and draw the participants,
 
staff, volunteers and visitors into a warm celebration of the folklife and
 
lore of childhood."
 
The Children's Area demonstrated success in most of the specific
  
purposes:
 
1
. We demonstrated and taught children's folklife and lore in programs
 
for children by children.
 
2
. Adult participants taught and compared games recalled from
 
childhood and reconstructed from recollections.
 Jamieson, B. Jones,
 
McMorland, Hunter, Ansah, V. Jones, Yeh, Mai, Lu, Sherbatskoy.
 
In addition to the adult participants who taught children's
 
games, the Children's Area also hosted Helen Englar and Ann
 
Mitchell, who taught quilt making, crewell embroidery, corn
 
husk dolls.
 
3
. Festival participants from other areas and the Children's Area
 
taught children's games and crafts from diverse ethnic origins:
 
Swedish, Ghanain, Chinese, Native American.
 Also East Indian
 
puppetry, Japanese origami, Pop Wagner et al, Woody Guthrie songs.
 
The children of Festival participants were regular visitors,
 
volunteers and participants in the Children's Area, which acted as
 
the Festival's backyard.
 
4
. The productions in the Folk Swap Tent demonstrated the
 
creative process by which children construct costumed talent
 
shows, haunted houses, circuses, puppet shows, dramatic plays
 
and parties.
 
5
. The Children's Area was strategically located near toilets
 
and in the shade.  We provided iced water and lemonade for all
 
participating children.
 
We regret that despite every concerted effort we were
 
unable to obtain a food concession in our area for sandwiches
 
I
 
-4-
and milk.
 Although we had approval for the rationale of suitable
 
children's food, neither DPA administration nor the Park Service
 
actively or vigorously espoused our cause.
 The food situation in
 
the Children's Area was permitted to become entangled in the
 
GSI-Park Service-Smithsonian imbroglio.  We were not given
 
support nor were we permitted to seek alternative solutions.
 
Fieldwork
 
1
.  Twenty-eight schools participated in weekend programs with three
 
schools bussed to the Festival each weekend.
 In addition, a
 
self-organized football team from the S.E.  section of Washington
 
was bussed on Saturdays to play their games at the Festival
 
culminating in the twelfth week with a football banquet complete
 
with trophies.
 The teachers received $30 a day and prepared
 
the children according to our guidelines for participation.
 
Permission slips were gathered for all participating children.
 
2
. A video and film search failed to turn up very much visual
 
material on children's lore, and we virtually dropped the
 
proposition of teaching from AV resources.
 However a side
 
effect of the search was the attraction of an exceptionally
 
interested and skilled staff who had been interested in the
 
recording of play lore.
 
3
. The fieldwork did emphasize neighborhood games and sports,
 
verbal traditions, musical traditions, dancing, sparring and
 
gymnastics, practical jokes and classroom folklife.
 Fieldwork
 
was not carried out for locating child folk artists.
 Video-
tapes were taken for the purpose of demonstrating to children
 
and teachers the nature and excitement of the children's
 
activities we hoped they would bring to the mall.
 An attempt
 
was made to give all the children a chance to see themselves on
 
videotape.
 Permission to be videotaped was obtained from all
 
the parents for the fieldwork tapes.
 
4
. Guidelines for participation and workshop content in the Children's
 
Area were distributed and discussed with group leaders.
 They
 
proved to be a very effective deterrent to materials which were
 
not children's folklore.  When groups did bring the results of
 
pedagogical efforts, they were allowed to present their program
 
-5-
and then encouraged to demonstrate some real children's lore so that
 
they perceived the difference.
 
5
. Exchange programs of children's .
lore for the schools were not
 
organized due to the lack of time and personnel.
 However
 
as a result of contacts made at the Festival this summer, Jean
 
Alexander, the stage presenter, plar
i
"s extensive program activity
 
this fall.
 Mrs. Alexander and Ann Bay of the Office of Elementary
 
and Secondary Education are also planning to set up a network
 
of communications about children's lore through the OESE newsletter.
 
Ann Bay wrote an article on the work of Kate Rinzler in children's
 
lore for the newsletter this summer.
 
.
6. An extensive outreach program carried out by the assistant
 
coordinator to recreation centers, Boy and Girl Scout troops,
 
YM and YWCA's and summer camps resulted in massive participation
 
in the Children's Area this summer despite occasional cancellations
 
due to lack of funding for buses.
 A total of 240 groups responded
 
to our invitaion, the group sizes ranging from 15 to 80 children.
 
The breakdown was as follows:
 
Schools
 
Recreation centers
 
District of Columbia  66

240  total
 
Groups filled the three performance areas--the Stage, Folkswap
 
Tent and Games Ring from 11:00 A.M.-4:00 P.M.
 Open slots
 
were often filled with camp groups visiting the Festival
 
unannounced or with volunteers.
 
Participation of groups was the result of the following
 
"ingredients" of coordination:
 
1
. Preparation of photographic display boards and flip chart.
 
2
. Preparation and duplication of hand-outs describing the
 
specifics of the Festival and the Children's Area
 
philosophy and activities.
 Legal questions were worked
 
out with Jim Wilson, General Counsel's Office.
 
3
. Telephone conversations to arrange presentation date.
 
4. Presentation.
 
5. Follow-up calls.
 
6
.  Scheduling.
 
7
. Preparation and distribution of permission slips and
 
letters of confirmation to leaders.
 
8
. Preparation, duplication and distribution of map and
 
parking information, as approved by Park Service and
 
the Park Police.
 
9
. Final confirming telephone calls.
 
7
. The Children's Area-also set up a special program for all of
 
44'
 the Title 1 summer programs in D
.C. on Wednesday-Friday from
 
c
-
10:45-11:30.
 
Without exception the responses of children and their teachers from
 
all participating groups were enthusiastic.

Multi-faceted Events were associated with all activity centers:
 
1
. Sand castle competitions, judging, prizes, party.
 
2
.Go-cart construction, races, judging, prizes.

followed by luncheon.
 
8
. Impromptu cheerleading contest between two participating groups,
 
judging, refreshments.
 
9
. Parties for staff with entertainment.
 
10. We did not do any video feed back recording.
 
11. The series of steps in an event tended to be fewer than originially
 
planned because of the periods of time that groups had available
 
to them for these activities.
 
Symposia were not held as planned.
 Elliott Wigginton was not available
 
for participation.
 
Activity Centers: All of the activity centers proposed functioned during the
 
Festival as described: the Stage, Folk Swap Tent, Games Ring, Tree House,
 
Hill and Sand Area and the three Crafts tents.
 With the exception of
 
balsa model making and macrame, all of the activities planned for the
 
centers took place.
 One change was made in the uses of Crafts 1,  2 and 3
.
 
The corn husk dollmaking was shifted to Crafts 1 and go-carts and
 
doll houses shifted to 3
.

Concessions:
 
The Cecil Krafts Shop of Wylesville, West Virginia, sold children's toys and
 
games.
 Perberton and Nova Lee Cecil were a very special addition as participants
 
to the area--singing and demonstrating Jews harps and limber jacks.
 They also
 
participated in workshops on our Stage.

These tapes were taken primarily before we were awarded the Child Development
 
Grant, but they will, nevertheless, be edited using grant funds and in fulfillment
 
of that grant's mandate.
 HEW Office of Child Development will be oppered tapes
 
other than those in the original grant proposal because the grant was awarded
 
after the groups of children to be taped for its fulfillment had participated
 
in the Children's Area.
 They were not videotaped because their program ran
 
before the 11 A.M. Festival opening; participants were not requested to come
 
down to work with the children because the grant had not been awarded.
 
Staff
  
The Children's Area was supervised by the coordinator, assistant coordinator
 
and the area supervisors with 2 additional full staff members--one intern paid
 
by OESE and one volunteer from the Smithsonian Office of Academic Studies.
 
The coordinator worked 6 1/2 to 7 days a week.
 The supervisors worked for
 
periods of from 4 weeks  (
1 person) to 12 weeks, 5 days a week, 8 hours a day.
 
They fulfilled all of the responsibilities listed with exceptional ability
 
and versatility as outlined in the opening statement.
 
Volunteers  
Approximately 45 volunteers,  32 of which worked full-time, worked in the
 
Children's Area each week, making a total of approximately 350 individuals.
 
Their ages ranged from 12 years up with the majority being between 12-14 years
 
old.
 More than half of the volunteers worked for longer than the one week
 
minimum with 15 children working for 4 weeks or longer.
 The few adult volunteers
 
covered for staff supervisory positions when needed.
 
Orientation and supervision of volunteers was provided by the assistant
 
coordinator and her secretary.
 Daily training workshops from 10:00-11:00 were
 
provided.
 
The major commitment made to us on the part of the volunteers was in
 
part due to the free lunch and the $2 a day stipend which was provided to us
 
by McDonald's advertising agency of Needham, Harper and Steers.
 The sum of
 
$3840 was at first dispersed by weekly checks, later by cash.
 The effect of
 
this little bit of "sugar" cannot be stressed too strongly.
 It was a small
 
but nevertheless concrete way of our saying to our hot and exhausted helpers
 
that we truly appreciated their efforts for our program.
 
National Park Service
  
With the glaring exception of the previously mentioned lack of drive to secure
 
a food unit, the Park Service performed for us in an excellent manner--trash
 
and wood pickups were made frequently, the wood pile was kept cons9lidated and
 
other tasks performed efficiently.
 The number of picnic tables requested in
 
March never materialized, the result being that the public had very few
 
eating and resting places.
 
Park Police  
Relations with the Park Police were excellent.
 Lt. Harrison and Sgt. Lenox
 
were responsive to our needs for special vehicular arrangements for staff,
 
participating individuals and for groups.
 Their security coverage was excellent
 
considering the area and length of time involved.
 We received many affirmative
 
reports on their warm treatment of lost children.
 
First Aid
 
Luckily the accidents which occurred in the Children's Area were relatively
 
minor--hammered thumbs, sand in eyes, etc.
 The First Aid unit responded quickly
 
when summoned.
 Confusion resulted when the First Air team wished to send
 
injured persons to a hospital other than the one designated by the Procedures
 
Manual.
 Obviously this conflict should have been resolved prior to the Festival
 
opening.
 
Conclusion
  
Altogether we
 are very pleased with the way the Children's Area ran this summer.
 
The extraordinary ability and growth of the staff, the enthusiastic participation
 
of some 7,000 children and our adult participants made the Children's Area a
 
pleasure for all who entered it.
 Reports from staff of ther Festival areas were
 
all radiantly laudatory.
 Many teachers thanked us for their experiences.
 Parents
 
were delighted.
 The whole spirit of the area was exemplified repeatedly when our
 
sand encrusted, drooping, bright-eyed volunteers would stagger up to us late Sunday
 
afternoons and,beg,  "When do we call to volunteer for next year?"
