'BOuT two veeks ago I 
suit to Jake Snow, 
Let's go to a 
pic-nic to- day ; 
I 
have got two girls, by jinks dey are pearls, 
Full of fun too ; now vat do you say ? 
He consented to go, so ye vere not slow 
Mit our girls und a 
lunch getting dere ; 
Veil a 
chap rather gay, who happened dot vay, 
Thought mit my girl to interfere. 
SPOKEN — Dere vos a 
fellar at de pic-nic who vos vink-
ing at my girl. 
I 
vos going to hit him only for Jake, 
who said— 
CHORUS. 
Don't touch him, don't touch him ! 
Don't you see he is too thin ? 
Don't touch him I 
don't touch him ! 
You vouldn't knock over a 
pin; 
Don't touch him, don't touch him 
If you vere to treat him so 
Just make a 
move und hit him, by Jove, 
Vy right into pieces he'd go. 
He said, " Sir, how dare, sir, you interfere ; 
Perhaps you don't know who I 
am; 
I'm son of a 
lord, I 
come from abroad; 
Don't think you've got hold of a 
lamb." 
DON'T TOUCH HIM.—Concluded. 
I 
den, den said, " All know you'd better not fight, 
For I 
am as strong as an ox, 
Und if you don't go I'll hit you a 
blow, 
For I 
tell you I 
know how to box." 
SPOERN.—He thought because he vas a 
son of a 
lord 
und I 
vos a 
German dot I 
didn't know how to put my - 
hands up. 
Vy, I 
you'd have knocked him all to pieces 
only a 
crowd got around, und Jake said— 
Don't touch him, etc. 
He shouted " Police 1" de crowd did increase, 
De girl she fainted avay ; 
I 
said to each voue, " You see vot he's done, 
Und for it now hell have to pay." 
Den mit all my might I 
drew out my right, 
Intending to punch his head; 
Up come de police to preserve de peace, 
Und vone of dem to me sait— 
SPorx.x.—De policeman said, " Vot's de matter here ?" 
I 
said, " Nothing, just valk avay." 
De policeman valked 
avay, mid I 
got at dis fellar, und if you ever see a 
sick-
looking fellar in about two minutes I 
vos de man. I 
whipped him so I 
had to go to de hospital. 
I

If I

GOOD-BYIi3, LOVELY LOU. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, 
the greatest of all vocalist', 
with tremendous success, 
Copyright, : 879, by Louts P. GOULLAUD. 
'TWAS early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou, 
As I 
am going far away, 
going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea ? 
She bowel her lovely head, 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said— 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, goo(Lbye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lon, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now, Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, etc, 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I'm going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, etc. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore. 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned 
That she had gone away; 
So now as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why, I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, etc. 
rm GETTING A BIG BOY NOW. 
Written by HARRY NICHOLLS. 
Composed by AMERE STRIPLISO. 
Sang with immense success by HERBERT CAMPBELL, and alsr, by 
M R. HARRY MONKHOUSE. 
I'VE had all the ills that belong to our youth, 
The whooping cough, measles and cold, 
I've cut all my teeth, and don't eat with a 
spoon, 
So now I 
begin to feel old. 
My ma gazes fondly upon her dear boy, 
With traces of care on her brow, 
And the tears fill her eyes, while fondly she sighs, 
" 
He's getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And I 
fancy it's time I 
knew how 
To brush my own clothes, and to wipe my own 
nose, 
For Pm getting a 
big boy now. 
I 
smoke my papa's best cigars every day, 
And once a 
week I 
get drunk. 
I 
wink at my nurse when she puts me to bed, 
And rocks me to sleep in my bank ; 
I 
once tried to kiss her, she sternly refused, 
And said " That I 
cannot allow, 
And in future, you elf, go to sleep by yourself, 
For you're getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I'm getting a 
big boy now; 
Sometimes I 
get tight, and stay out all night, 
For IV —etting, a 
big boy now, 
( ) 
This Christmas I 
went to my first pantomime— 
I'd never been taken before; 
And now that I've been, and the fairies I've seen, 
I 
want to see several more. 
When I 
saw the fairies trip on to the stage, 
I 
felt I 
can scarce explain how, 
Bat I 
know that I 
thought their skirts rather short, 
And I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And that's the best part, you'll allow, 
Where they dance in a 
row and stand on one toe, 
Oh, I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
Sometimes I 
go out for a 
spree with my pal, 
And we jump on poor cripples and babies, 
Old women and such, but men we daren't touch, 
For we're only a 
parcel of gabies. 
And when we can muster a 
hundred or more, 
We're ready to pick up a 
row. 
I'm a 
coward, I 
own, for I'm no good alone, 
And I'm only a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
Pm getting a 
big boy now, 
I 
can fight, kick and bully, I 
vow ; 
And of course I 
don't mind, for I 
only get fined, 
Because I'm a 
big boy now.

IN 
summer time when all is fine. 
And the trees and grass are green ; 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene, 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might. 
They have a 
big accordeon, 
The music it is grand, 
You'll hear them shout for miles away ; 
Faith, they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy " on his instruments will play. 
cum:Es. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all the night, 
'Tis finer than the Op'ra Bouffe; 
If you don't believe I'm right, call around there any 
night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof. 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They say it is too soon. 
(

MaDONITIMIPS OLD TIN- 
ROOF.—Concluded. 
They keep the folks awake all night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunea. 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, 
It really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the Op'ra Bonita; 
When they do the Boston dip, 
Faith, the house rocks like a 
ship, 
Oh, there's no place like McDonnell's old tin 
roof. 
Its polkas, waltzes, eta 
across the street from where I 
live, 
A 
German keeps a 
store, 
He is a 
baker man by trade, 
He's worth a 
thousand or more. 
He keeps about five men at work, 
Of course they're up all night, 
But when they hear the music play, 
They shout with great delight. 
About the time the bread is bal'd 
The boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door; 
And they'll skip across the street, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
Oh, you ought to hear the bakers how they 
roar. 
It's polkas, waltzes, eta.

BOUQUET DOYLE. 
Written and sung by JAMES CYNErn and JACK CONROY. 
1'31 a 
masher among the shop girls, 
I 
carry on business down town, 
Every morning at eight I 
sit down to eat 
My coffee with doughnuts done brown. 
When I 
pass the girls at me they smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style ; 
Shure the boys on the street whenever we meet 
Say, How de you do, Bouquet Doyle ? 
CHORUS. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet I 
always do wear in my coat, 
The pink and white roses, the daisies and posies, 
With perfume I'm ready to choke. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet to carry it is my delight, 
The sweet water lily, the daffydowndilly, 
I 
give to my girl every night. 
Shure I 
drink nothing stronger than milk, 
My necktie is the finest of silk, 
I 
attended every ball at Walla Halla Hall, 
Where the wine like water is spilt ; 
In the dairy, when I 
go to lunch, 
The girls get around in a 
bunch ; 
They leave others there to serve me I 
declare, 
While a 
cranberry tart I 
do munch. 
A 
Bouquet, etc. 
I'm home every night about dawn, 
And I'm up with the lark in the morn 
Just before dark I 
walk thro' the park 
To feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the City knOwS me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
Whenever I 
meet a 
bum on the Street 
He'll ask me if I 
have a 
dime. 
A 
Bouquet, etc.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
THE woman was old and ragged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of the winter's day ; 
The street was wet with a 
recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
She stood at the crossing and waited long, 
Alone, uncared for, amid the throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Nor heed the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Came the boys like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow pile white and deep. 
Past the woman so old and gray 
Hastened the children on their way, 
Nor offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So meek, so timid, afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or horses' feet 
Should crowd her down in the slippery street. 
At last came one of the merry troop— 
The gayest laddie of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go." 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were firm and strong. 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content. 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged and poor and slow ; 
And I 
hope some fellow will lend a 
hand 
To help my mother, you understand, 
" 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
When her own dear boy is far away." 
And " somebody's mother" bowed low her bead 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said 
Was, " God be kind to the noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy !"

I'M fond of society, merriment, fun, 
Think music and dancing divine, 
;While yet to prevent my enjoyment of these, 
A 
very great failing is mine. 
.Now some may be called too pert or too bold, 
Or eagar to peep or to pry. 
1I'm neither of these, for my trouble is this, 
I'm really so awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
I'm really so awfully shy, 
But I 
cannot tell you for why; 
For go where I 
may, I'm sorry to say, 
I'm really so awfully shy. 
A 
short time ago to a 
party I 
went, 
And danced with Augustus, and when 
The dance was concluded I 
thought to myself, 
He's really the nicest of men. 
He said, shall we go for a 
walk on the lawn ? 
The moon is quite bright in the sky. 
I 
wished to say yes, but I 
had to say no, 
Because I 
felt awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
I'm really so awfully shy, 
But I 
cannot tell you for why; 
For go where I 
may, I'm sorry to say,

Nor long ago while walking out 
Along the Avenue, 
I 
tumbled on a 
big surprise, 
It struck me as quite new. 
The boys and girls were in their sic:, 
It was about midday, 
I 
thought it shockingly absurd, 
Whene'er I 
heard them say : 
CHORUS. 
Good evening, this evening. 
Are you going to the ? 
Not this evening, good evening, 
Good evening, one and all. 
Fine evening, this evening, 
This evening's very warm, 
Good evening, this evening, 
Good evening, take my arm. 
While wondering and pondering 
Just what it all could mean, 
I 
chanced to look around and spy 
The sweetest little queen. 
She looked so real bewitching sweet 
I 
sighed and said, oh dear, 
She sailed up, seized me by the nose 
And whispered in my ear : 
Good evening, etc. 
We strolled along, both side by side, 
She said I 
was her mash, 
Then dragged me in a 
restaurant 
And ordered up some hash. 
She must have fasted forty days, 
I'm sure she ate her fill, 
She sweetly smiled, I 
was beguiled 
And settled up the bill. 
Good evening, etc.

UPON the elevated train 
I 
often take a 
ride. 
Along the second story rooms, 
The blinds are open wide ; 
Of course when I 
am looking out 
Some curious things I 
see, 
And now I'll try to tell of those 
That interested me. 
CHORUS. 
Riding on the Elevated Railroad train, 
In a 
cosy little seat beside the window pane, 
Many things I 
see of interest to me, 
While riding on the Elevated Railroad train. 
Now there's a 
little dwellling place, 
The folks are going to dine ; 
I 
see the table thickly spread 
With ev'rything that's fine, 
And here's a 
man with eyes intent 
Upon the morning news, 
And there's a 
fellow lies in bed, 
As if he had the blues.

While near her himgs a

To sing its marry lay. 
Riding on the, etc. 
Oh here's a 
woman holding up 
A 
baby very small. 
And yonder sits a 
tailor 
With his back against the wall, 
While just beside two idle men 
Are seated, playing cards, 
And people here are drinking beer, 
With " mutual regards." 
Riding on the, etc. 
I 
see a 
picture of distress— 
A 
barely furnished room, 
Three little ragged children 
With their faces full of gloom.. 
So many and so varied 
Are the sights that come to view 
I'm sure I'd try your patience 
If I 
told them all to you.

OH! Dan Mulligan is a 
man 
Of great fame and renown, 
His name it is a 
househeld world 
In the country and town ; 
At his breakfast last Tuesday morn 
To his fond wife he said, 
"Cordelia dear, next Monday night 
We'll have a 
masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, he ripp'd up the carpet, 
Took chromos off the wall, 
And greas'd the floor with tallow, 
Piled the beds in the hall ; 
He order'd pots of chowder, 
Washtubs of lemonade, 
Invited all the neighbors 
To ' tend the masquerade. 
At nine o'clock Dan rung a 
bell, 
They all lept in the room, 
With black masks on their pale faces, 
On their shoulders a 
broom ; 
With sweet Cordelia on his arm 
Dan led the promenade ; 
'Twits then the fun began oh, oh, 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade.. 
Now Dan wore his short leg trousers 
And slippers on his feet, 
Cordelia in her snow white robes, 
Begorra, she look'd neat, 
And the blackbird Mrs. Allup, 
Dress'd as the Queen of May, 
Recited poor " Shamus O'Brien," 
While the guests did hooray.

DAN 2/CULLIGAN'S MASQUERADE.—Concluded.. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Lemmons as a 
leapfrog 
Jmnp'd in the chowder pot, 
Dan pulled him out by the hair, 
And laid him on a 
cot; 
With a 
clothes-line they tied him 
On the tailor's Inunpback, 
And as he ran round the room 
All hands hit him a 
whack. 
Tommy Fagin, in skin-tight pants, 
Danced the Society 
With big, fat Mrs. Locbmuller, 
How nice they dipp'd their knee; 
The great Walsinfy,ham McSweeney, 
Beside the keg he stayed, 
Singing Torn Moore's sweet melodies 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
At two o'clock they had supper 
In the back yard below; 
Rebecca pass'd the grub around, 
All hands ' fill'd in," you know, 
And all at once they beard music 
Down in the alleyway; 
'Twas the " Full Moons" in full dress came, 
Their compliments to pay. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Mulligan receiv'd them 
With a 
shower of red bricks ; 
The nagurs drew their razors, 
The lads fought with hay-sticks ; 
Mrs. Dublin scaled the fence, 
But a 
nail caught in her dress ; 
There she hung calling for help, 
A 
widdy in distress. 
Captain Primrose on a 
shutter 
Was carried home to die, 
Dan Mulligan in a 
handcart 
Bid Cordelia good-bye; 
Some had lame legs, others black eyes, 
Troth, all hands clearly paid 
For all the pleasure that they had 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade.

Will she constant be. 
None completer, none is sweeter,

In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her, 
If you only try, 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye. 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten, 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen, 
As they pass her by. 
Now I

ponder, etc. 
She is very shy and merry, 
In her roguish ways, 
I 
adore her more and more,

For her heart divine,

If this chair could but speak, oh ! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in tierce battle fell: 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
lie cherished his freedom, the red white, and blue ! 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this-old chair grim and tall,

No. 
HARRY.—That'S just my luck. 
No matter, so long as I

Oh, how I 
have sighed to see the old homestead

Sing it Jenny, and it

-.OFTP. LITTLE OLD HOUSE ON THE RHINE. 
By 
ALEX MCCIAFFERTY. 
Sang by GIIE3 W ILLIAMS. 
AIR.—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
I 
REMEMBER the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katherine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine.. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold, and in winter 'twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more 
dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as be-
fore, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask %le:1th the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd 
return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, eta. 
They arc both dead and gone, and they sleep side by 
side, 
rn the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pate. 
Good-bye, dear old home, fare yon well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time. 
Oh ! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, eta, 
.1 TRAMP. 
A RECITATION . 
A s 
recited by CHARLES Durum, of CAMPBELL & Thorium, with 
great success. 
LE3I-ME sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to 
you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it? 
Folks say we ain't 
good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think 
we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes; 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and- people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too ; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and 
fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know 110 ill; 
Mother she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's 
will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's 
Fill'd with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead— in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to 
drink. 
Gimme one glass, Camel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the 
Judgment Day.

Price 40 cents. 
THERE'S a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully 
stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings 
hash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Jah.anna's on the 
mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could admire. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where every-
thing's snug, 
Her furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
one evening at the window sat as her invited guest, 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud 
of Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN. — It struck the girl bang in the eye, the old 
yellow Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize 
with her, when one of those young devils yelled—

SomEThink that life the most jolly 
is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country, 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps I 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORTJS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side of a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
There's where I 
met with my darling. 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
Likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and the cows. 
Down, down, etc. 
The clucks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron, 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow, 
They're sure to waggle their tails. 
Down, down, etc.

DOT VIFE OF MINE. 
RECITATION. 
Written and recited by LESTER HOWARD, of the " Novelty Four," 
in their original burletta, " Bohearsal in the Parlor." 
DOT rife of mine, dot rife of mine, 
She boders mine life out all der time, 
She slaps mine nose mid pulls mine face, 
Und knocks mine ears all out of blace. 
She drives me of my own house out, 
Und makes me wander der night about, 
Till yen morning comes, mit a 
dove-like smile, 
I 
am coaxed back to my domicile 
By dot rife of mine. 
Dot rife of mine, dot rife of mine, 
Yen I 
goes to der tavern in der evening time, 
I 
sits me down in mine easy chair, 
Und eats mine Limburger mid drinks mine beer, 
Yen in she comes, mit an old broom-stick, 
Und hurries me home on cler double- guide, 
Vile der people all look and laugh and stare, 
Und wonders who wears der britches dere, 
Me or dot vile of mine. 
Dot rife of mine, dot rife of mine, 
Stie wakes me up in der midnight time, 
Und tells me a 
pain in her stomach she's got, 
Und rants me to make her a 
viskey hot. 
I 
goes down shtairs in my cold shirt-tail, 
Und shkins my shins on der bucket pail, 
Drying to make viskey hot in a 
coffee-pot, 
For dot rife of mine. 
Dot rife of mine, dot rife of mine, 
Yen ever will come der happy dime, 
Yen on dis mortal earth her breath 
Forever shall be stopp'd mit death. 
No more, I

Der leetle shtars she make for me, 
Den I 
shall be so happy tend free 
From dot voman of mina. 
THE CRUTCH AND TOOTHPICK.

r3I an aristocrat, 
Make no mistake in that.

Remarkably fine, 
For troubles I

For pleasure's my aim, 
Delight is my game, 
And I 
adore the fair. 
ClIORUS. 
I'm a 
swell, 
You can tell, 
And behave of course as such, 
Close cut hair, 
Elbows square, 
With my toothpick and my crutch. 
With glass enclosed in eye, 
I 
scan the passers by; 
I've pantomime cuffs, 
And ready rebuffs, 
For cads familiar; 
Although really glad, 
I 
say not bad, 
When leaving drawl, " Ta-ta."

THE CRUTCH AND TOOTHPICK.—Concluded. 
To your true aristocrat 
All luxuries come pat, 
The driest champagne, 
The softest La Rose, 
The tastiest caviar; 
Havana for us 
Especially grows 
Its exquisitest cigar. 
I'm a 
swell, etc. 
Though we're aristocrats, 
At fighting we're no fiats, 
For when America's name 
The foe would defame, 
Swell dandies tho' we be, 
In meeting the foe 
No swelldom we show, 
So owns the enemy; 
Staunch and true, • 
Red or blue, 
Sure our courage isn't Dutch. 
And the sword 
We can wield 
With more vigor than the crutch. 
I'm a 
swell, 
You can tell, 
And behave of course as such ; 
Close cut hair, 
Elbows square, 
With my toothpick and my crutch.

M UZ: 3 
by J. K. E3IIIET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
On ! hear the cuckoo call ! 
Oh ! hear him calling now ! 
Cuckoo ! cuckoo ! 
I 
hear you call, I 
hear you call, 
Hear the cuckoo call, 
Oh! hear, he's calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray ; 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and, the rose, 
Wave in the valleys green, 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows, 
Oh ! sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The birds do sing with a 
merry trill, 
Their glad notes sound clear through the green 
woodland bowers, 
But the cuckoo's song is so sad still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies, etc.

HIGH WATER PANTS. 
Sung by O'N EIL and CONROY. 
2.1v name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
I'm an Irishman as you can see, 
1 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in the tree. 
But the gang that stands on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
They shout out whenever I'm passing, 
" 
There is O'Brien with his High Water Pants." 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short .visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the High Water Pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan ; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parry-
tette 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nigger came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and conundrum 
About O'Brien with his High Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc. 
T'other night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
frio!nd, Paddy Brock, 
We thought we'd drop into Geoghan's 
For a 
glass of his Rye and Rock. 
When the gang says there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bartender shot me a 
glance; 
Hold your tongue, says he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his High Water Pants 
They tell me to go over, etc.

My name is McNamara, I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, the lakes and rip-
pling rills 
Are singing sweetest music all the day ; 
Our little farm was small, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home; 
I 
bid them all good-bye, with a 
teardrop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, of work I'm not afraid; 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing or dance; 
I'll do anything you say if you'll only name the day 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York I 
tried hard to get work, 
And I 
travelled through the streets from day to day ; 
I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help they say ; 
But still I 
wandered on, a-hoping to find one 
That would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But then it's all the same, for I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And oftentimes I 
wished that I 
was dead. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, etc. 
But I 
know I've ote kind friend who will lend a 
helping 
hand 
To a 
plor boy and to help him on at home; 
I 
will bring my mother here and my little sister dear, 
And never more again from them to roam ; 
I 
will try to do what's right, I 
will work both night and 
day, 
Yes, I'll do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart that will take a 
poor boy's 
part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man.

THE daisy soldier boys, the Hickory Rangers file away,

A rare battalion of renown, who'd fight as tho' twere 
play; 
Oh I 
it's strained with admiration is the glance of ev'ry 
lass, 
When tramping by with 
elegant step, the Hickory 
Rangers pass. 
Boldly they tramp away without a 
fear, 
Scowling as though they wished a 
foe were near, 
On to the field they'd march away so wild, 
It's cannons they would love to bear, instead of the 
muskets mild.

The daisy soldier boys, the Hickory Rangers file away, 
A 
rare battalion of renown who'd fight as tho' twere play; 
! 
it's strained with admiration, is the glance of ev'ry 
lass, 
When tramping by with 
elegant step, the 
Hickory 
Rangers pass. 
No lowly privates fill their ranks, they're Colonels ev'ry 
one, 
And never from a 
weaker foe would these grim Rangers 
run, 
Their feet of wondrous strength, and their great heads 
up-held so high, 
Awake a 
wild, encouraging shout, when the Hickory 
boys go by. 
Down from their picnic, thro' the streets at night, 
Pass all the warriors, bathed in calcium light, 
Bent low with prizes, grabb'd, and clutch'd, and won, 
Alive with home-made glory, solid Hickories ev'ry one. 
The daisy soldier boys, etc.

Beware! beware! beware! beware!

NAUGHTY CLARA.—Continued. 
CLARA.—What a 
surprising degree of impudence some men 
show. 
Charles has had the audacity to send me a 
note, asking 
for an interview. 
I 
hav'nt known him more than a 
month. 
But then I've had five admirers since then, and each one of them 
is ready to go down on his knees to me. 
I rather think I 
like 
Charley, though. 
Yes; I 
prefer him to any of the others. He 
so frightfully jealous, I 
don't know what is to be done with 
him,— unless I 
marry him. 
Here he comes. 
I'll hide behind 
this tree.

She won't be here, now. Ps past

Oh, what a 
fool I 
was to get caught in the meshes 
of this pretty, bewitching coquette ! 
( 
Sings 2d verse and refrain of song.) 
Her hair is as bright as the sweet sunlight, 
Her cheek as fair as the dawning. 
But to speak of love to my own little dove, 
Is sure to set her yawning. 
I 
Swear by her eyes. I 
swear lw the skies, 
I 
swear by the stars above me, 
But she does'nt care, for the more I 
swear, 
The more she does'nt love me.

Co:Tr:eat, 1370, by E. D. 
Tat other night I 
had a 
dream, in a 
garden I 
did seem, 
Bright about the moon did beam and I 
stood all alone, 
But as I 
stood why some one came; one that I 
knew well 
by name, 
And I 
heard a 
voice exclaim, " Oh, art thou not my 
own ?" 
CII0Itt-S. 
Rosey posey, will you be mine ? 
You know I'm thine, and love's divine; 
And while the moon so brightly does shine, 
nosey Posey, say that you'll be mine. 
I 
seem to feel a 
little shy, gave a 
sort of tender sigh, 
Saying wait perhaps by and by my answer you may know. 
But oh, said he, my Rosey dear, don't be foolish, no one's 
near, 
Let me then your answer hear, come tell me e're I 
go. 
Rosey Posey, etc. 
A 
change at last came o'er my dream, sunshine all around 
did beam; 
I 
a 
bride in white did seem, and at the altar stand, 
The church was crowded, friends were near, wedding bells 
were ringing clear, 
And the bridegroom did appear, who can'' to claim my 
hand. 
As sung by Mas Csanr. 
ONcr, upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about, it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honeysuckle fair to see ; 
And the maiden watched the blossom daily, 
heard the bees about it as it grow, 
Dent about it singing ever gayly, 
Ev'ry bird and ev'ry blossom knew 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Came a 
sudden dainty frown ; 
Greater love she did not know, 
No! greater love she did not know, know, know, know, 
know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave and fall of manly grace, 
Whi-paring tender words, he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny, smiling face ; 
Underneath the honeysuckle walked they, 
Bat her eyes were cast demurely down ; 
Seeing not, as softly, sweetly talked they, 
how its leaves were turning sere and brown, 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the rifle, 
Careless h 
the maid, I 
trow, 
Greater love hath learned to know. 
Yes! greater love hath learned to know, know, know,. 
knov.-, 
know.

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Mass Alzyxra. Las. 
W REN I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childish joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steal out on the 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window over-
head; 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say; 
CHORUS. 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your 
knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it won't hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at 
all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee.

But when 1 
wore long dresses tirst the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took, 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls ana 
drives. 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on Your knee, etc. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask.. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward he, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to.

There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily raearl

JAKE DYEn loved a 
handsome girl, Maria was her name, 
And took her once to see New York, the country was so 
tame, 
And when she saw the Brooklyn bridge, which was way 
overhead, 
She ope'd her eyes with great surprise, and this is what 
she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what Maria said unto Jake Dyer ; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty 
I 
never saw the like before, Maria she did say. 
He took her then to Central Park the different things to 
see— 
The lake, the mall, the statues and the great menagerie, 
And when she saw the bear stand up and lean upon a 
cane 
She grabbed his arm in great alarm and to him did ex-
claim— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
He took her then to Jerome Park to see the races there, 
The grand stand it was filled with men and women, oh 
so fair, 
And when she saw the tally-ho coach it nearly turned 
her head, 
And when they jumped the hurdle gates why this is what 
she said— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
Now Jake felt awful when he found that his girl was so 
green, 
And started ere the race was over for to catch a 
train ; 
The people saw the hayseed sticking in Maria's bead, 
They laughed and stood up in their seats, and this is 
-what they said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what they holler'd in a 
voice so solid; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty! 
I 
never saw the like before, the people they did say. 
SLX FEET OF EARTH. 
I'LL relate to you now of the world and its ways) 
And many strange people we meet; 
From the rich man that rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch on the street 
A man may be poor, and in tatters and rags, 
Though we ne'er should affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, and remember, my friends, 
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
Covers many a 
brave manly heart, 
But if he's not dressed like his neighboring self. 
Society keeps him apart. 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls both to the grave, 
Then six feet of earth makes them both of one size. 
Now, should you ever meet a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle this world and its frowns, 
'You heln him along, perchance lie succeeds, 
Don't crush and still put him down. 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given, 
Is remembered with joy in the sides, 
ITo are all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size.

IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF Trivrm. 
An Oriinal Song by FEANX LEWIS. 
IN the battle of life, if you would win in the strife, 
6uould you fail at the start, try again ; 
keep a 
stiff upper lip, never give up the ship, 
Saushine always comes after rain. 
Whatever you do, strive to push your way through, 
And keep this sound maxim in mind, 
Fortune favors the brave, she'll yet come to your aid— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
CHORUS. 
So, if for a 
fortune or fame you may strive, 
Or a 
wife suited just to your mind, 
Go in with a 
will, your time will come still— 
It ij only a 
question of time. 
Our conductor: are fond of milk punches, they say 
But the bell punches, they made them sick, 
For the spotters discovered their secret machines, 
They rang under their arms with a 
click. 
Now, the secret is out, and their pickings they miss ; 
Knocking down's almost ceased on our lines ; 
Bat some Yankee will invent an improvement on this--
It is only a 
question of time. 
CHORUS. 
Directors are sharp, but conductors aro fly, 
They have got these things down pretty fine ; 
They will soon punch this bell punch, and send it 
sky high ! 
It is only a 
question of time. 
My friend Jones has been married five years now or so, 
He's the father of five— so they say— 
But what's strange to relate and carious to know, 
I 
have not one, though I 
pray. 
But my mothe,r-in-law says, now don't you despair, 
Fight it out, my boy, on that srme line ! 
Dame Nature will be good to you, never fear— 
It is only a 
question of 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
give this advice as it was given to me, 
If your family affairs are like mine, 
If your house has no heir, why never despair— 
It is only a 
question of time.

" 
DORSINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BEN. D. 
COLLINS. Sung by Gus W ILLIAM. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkius was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed shleli-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist,. 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yah 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked., 
Bat continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "Pm the king," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang. 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Durki'ns 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home."

I'VE a 
maxim that I 
learned at school so many years ago, 
It's a good one and you should not pass it by; 
It will no doubt benefit you and ' tis well that you should 
know, 
It is, John, my boy, don't fly your kite too high. 
CHORUS. 
Don't fly your kite too high, my boy, 
For sometime it must fall ; 
A 
passing cloud may wreck it, child, 
You'll lose the string and all. 
How well I 
Iearn'd the lesson that to me was often taught, 
But not without experience as well ; 
I 
did speculate and money lose, till poverty o'er fraught, 
And on my ear that maxim clearly fell, 
Don't fly your kite too high, etc. 
Once more I 
gain'd a 
foothold in the business life of 
men, 
And I 
watched the changes every day might bring; 
Till once again success was mine as once the case had 
. 
been, 
And then it was I 
sat me down to sing,. 
Don't fly your kite too high, eta.

THE PULLING MACHINE. 
An original recitation. Written by ILtanY Ioi 
HE 
was an old bum, all broke up, 
Und walking down de street ; 
In his pocket dere was not. one eend, 
He was waiting to get a 
treat. 
About twendy-dre, persons he had stopped, 
Und asked if dey could help him ; 
How sad he vas when dey shook dere head., 
Und sait, " Old boy, dot's too thin." 
At last he struck a 
bier saloon, 
He approached it very shy, 
And stood in front as if petrified, 
Humming " the Sweet By und By." 
But soon he took up courage, 
Und went in where the lunch wag spread ; 
He made a 
grab at a 
horse radish, 
Wen a 
beer keg hit his head; 
He looked arount inquiringly, 
Und snit, " Boys, dot aint fair ;" 
His ears dey flashed, his eyes sunburnt, 
Und his head stood on his hair. 
De bartender den went up to him, 
Mit joy his face did beam— 
Und says, " Friend, how much can you pull 
On dot dere pulling machine ? " 
De burn walked up to de pulling machine, 
For his anger was aroused, 
And hollered loud, " I'll beat any man here 
Pulling in de house." 
D3 bet was done ; a 
little man 
De first to pull wits made, 
He grabbed the handles and done it well, 
De hands showed dwo hundred eight. 
De bum he was de next to try, 
He wanted a 
good start;

THE PULLING MACHINE.—Coneludea. 
De gang looked at de barkeeper und sait, 
" 
Give it to him hard." 
He grabbed de handles mit deathlike grip, 
Und hollered " dot will do," 
In another second he gide a 
kick, 
Und in de air flew his left shoe. 
He hollered " Murder," "'Watch," " Police," 
Und sait, " Oh, let me go," 
He knocked de skin all off his knees, 
For he did struggle so ; 
The barkeeper at last let him come down, 
He fell on de floor mit a 
crash, 
He didn't wait to go out de door, 
But jumped drough de window und broke de sash. 
Out on de sidewalk dey found him 
Laying stiff und stark, 
Dey all took dere hats off und den sang 
" 
Twilight in de park." 
A 
policeman put him in a 
dray; 
He thought it wasn't right 
To see a 
man disturb the peace, 
Especially if he's tight. 
But alas! dot poor old bum was gone, 
He tried hard to wake him up 
By hitting him on de head und feet 
Mit a 
policeman's billy club ; 
Dey brought do cor'ner, who felt his pulse, 
Den lookt arount mid sait, 
"I'm sorry ! Here, bring me a 
beer, 
Be jabers, the man is dead !" 
De cor'ner's jury sat on him, 
De jurors lookt serene, 
Their verdict was, " He came to death 
From pulling—de pulling machine."

THEhE'S no friendly voice to greet me 
In the home that once was dear, 
There is none to come and meet me, 
None to shed a 
gladdened tear; 
All I 
fondly loved and cherished 
Silently has pass'd away, 
And my brightest hopes have perished 
With the golden summer day. 
CHORUS. 
There's no friendly voice to greet me 
In the home that once was dear, 
There is none to come and meet me, 
None•to shed a 
gladdened tear. 
There's no rosy lip to kiss me 
When I 
enter at the gate, 
There is none to say they miss me, 
None to ask what makes me late; 
All I 
dearly prized has vanished 
Like a 
ray of sunny li;.T.ht, 
And the happy scenes are banished 
Now forever from my sight. 
There's no friendly, etc. 
There's no smiling face to cheer me 
When the daily toil is o'er, 
There is none to sit and hear me, 
None to soothe the heart that's sore; 
All the vows of love are broken 
That had bound a 
happy pair, 
And the only treasured token 
Is this lock of amber hair. 
There's no friendly, etc.

THERE are many great things it would please me to do, 
If I 
only could hit on a 
plan, 
I 
often behold a 
big fortune in view, 
But reach to it I 
never can ; 
There's joy and delight in the world ev'ry day, 
And I 
could have plenty of fun, 
I 
could dress up in style, and be merry and gay, 
If I 
only knew how it was done. 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only knew how it was done, 
I 
could always have pleasure and fun,— 
All the ladies 
charm and feel no alarm, 
If I 
only knew how it was done. 
I 
loved a 
fair creature, as fair as could be, 
And fondly my love she returned, 
But both were so bashful we ne'er could be free 
With the feeling that inwardly burned. 
We walked out together and talked very sweet, 
But the subject of love we did shun, 
I 
felt so peculiar, and often I 
wished 
That I 
only knew how it was done. 
If I 
only knew, etc. 
One night after we had returned from the play, 
We lingered sometime at the door, 
I 
thought I 
had said all I 
wanted to say, 
Yet wished for a 
word or two more ; 
I 
mustered up courage just then to propose, 
She thought I 
was only in fun ; 
" 
Oh, no, sir !" she said, " yet I 
might, I 
suppose, 
If I 
only knew how it was done." 
If I 
only knew, etc. 
At length we were married— oh happy the day ! 
The honeymoon passed like a 
dream, 
We felt just as gay as the dear little birds 
That fly over meadow and stream ; 
We're blessed with a 
baby as sweet as can be,— 
Of sorrow or care we have none. 
I 
hear people say they would like to be me— 
If they only knew how it was done. 
If I 
only knew, etc.

FREDDY THE SWELL. 
Written by JANES NILES. Sung with great success by Nnze and

I 
KNOW a 
young fellow, his name it is Fred, 
He is as giddy as giddy can be, 
His step it is light, his pants they are tights, 
He is one of the tra la la lee ; 
He owes for his clothes at the tailor's below, 
And the style is the latest you see, 
To the club he will go in the evening, you know, 
And with a 
friend he'll take tea. 
CHORUS. 
He carries a 
cane and an umbrella too 
He always looks so stylish and so neat, 
His hat is No. seven and his shoes are No. eleven, 
But he don't wear any socks on his feet. 
He walks in the park, goes out on a 
lark, 
His necktie is all in a 
flutter, 
The people they swear, to each other declare 
That he ought to be kicked into the gutter ; 
On a 
corner he'd stand, oh, he looks so grand. 
In the windows he'd peep half the day, 
At the show-cases stare at the jewelry there, 
And pull his mustaches in an elegant way. 
He carries a 
cane, eta, 
HIRE A HALL. 
Nor, me kind friends, if you listen, 
Sure Pat Rooney, that's me name, 
And the very same that I 
was christen'd, 
When lately from old Ireland I 
came; 
Oh, it's when I 
landed in this city, 
Sure I 
knew not what to do at all, 
But some folks, they thought themselies witty, 
Why, they told me to go hire a 
hail. 
Ah, ; don't understand any of those Yankee words, 
For every one at me they bawl; 
If I 
dance, if I 
sing, if I 
do anything, 
Why, they tell me to go hire a 
hall. 
I 
went and joined a 
temp'rance society, 
And it's then that I 
felt quite content ; 
They saw I 
was full of sobriety, 
Sure, they elected me their president; 
I 
got up for to address the meeting, 
They all swore I 
ought to be blackhall'd, 
Sure, I 
sp-die for one hour and sixty-five minutes, 
When they told m 
2 
to go hire a 
hall. 
Ah, I 
don't understand, etc 
Now it's about time that I 
crack it aiFy, 
Or else with me you will all grumble, 
And I 
hope, me kind friends, I 
did plase ye, 
'Pon me sowl, I've Laken a 
tumble, 
But there's one thing I'll say before I 
go:away, 
' And don't think that I 
have a 
gall; 
If you've money to lend, why, then I'll amend, 
I'll straightway go and hire a

Skating on one., skating on one 
0, boys, there was never such glorious fun; 
All other pleasu.res -of youth I 
would shun, 
And go skating on one in the gutter ! 
I 
beat all the boys with my far-
fetching stride, 
In fact I 
was never artistic; 
While backward and forward so graceful did glide, 
I 
thought ev'ry motion majestic.. 
I 
cared not to -
skate on the rink or the park, 
You may blicve it's the truth which I 
utter, 
The best of n11 pleasures from daylight till dark, 
Was skating on one in the gutter! 
Skating on one, etc. 
To join in the sport I 
would loiter from school, 
And gain the great wrath of my master; 
Sometimer; on the ice I 
would get a 
great fall, 
And go home for a 
piece of shin-plaster. 
And oft thro' the day I 
would steal soft away, 
With a 
hungry boy's balm, bread and butter, 
To meet my companions, so noisy and gay, 
And go skating on one in the gutter 1 
Skating an one, etc.

While we live thus apart there's a

There's a

I'll go back again,

In my sorrow no more I

Once again I 
will sit by her side, 
And the light of her smile will be mine, 
And the love which my absence denied, 
Will be brought back in gladness divine. 
We will kiss and forgive, and in future will live 
Far away from all sorrow and pain; 
Oh ! the thought brings me hope and delight, 
I'll go back to my old love again.

While I

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night; 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part,, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran down your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as Iife-, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife> 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to the. 
The play soon began; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
To give him a 
cheerful " Hi, hi 1" 
(1) 
DORKLNS7 NIGHT.— Concluded. 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong 
You could see. 
" 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite badly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd cast a 
beseeching glance all around, 
And his head on his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd struggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, 
And think that I'm drunk 
(From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan) 
I'll tell you the reason— 
I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home."

Arn.—" Grandmother's Old Arm Chair," by W. CAnnora, 
4  Mv grandmother she at the age of twenty-three 
Was found sitting on my grandfather's clock ; 
Her hair was silvery red, and she never slept in bed, 
And done washing for the babies in our block. 
She never wore the pants, but was good to all the 
tramps, 
And her heart is big as any paving stone. 
When she cashed in her checks they could not find her 
specs, 
And she left me her brother's old trombone. 
CHORUS. 
Flow I 
hollered, how I 
swore— 
My last winter's ulster into rags I 
tore ; 
When the police put me in jail 
There was no one in the city who'd go my bail. 
My cousin who's away got a 
bale of salt- marsh hay, 
But he gave it to a 
man who is not born, 
And poor old Uncle Dan received a 
Cincinnati ham, 
With a 
cross-grained paralytic ear of corn ; 
And there was old Aunt Sallie who lives in our dark 
She got a 
yard of second-banded lace, 
And then my brother Ed got a 
loaf of home-made bread, 
Who was never known to wash his dirty face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh such kicking, such a 
time, 
With my sister's husband singing " Baby mine :" 
Around his neck I'd like to tie a 
rock, 
And smash him in the necktie with my grand-
mother's sock.

By GEORGE ROM 
ROMANCE. 
" WnAT is the use of arguing, Ned ? 
When a 
fellow reaches my age, 
He generally knows what he's talking about ; 
So I 
tell you l'm booled for the 
stage.' 
I've seen a 
great deal of it at home and abroad, 
it has long been the wish of my heart ; 
One has hardly a 
care, rind there's nothing to do— 
Except, p'r'aps, to study a 
part. 
Then, there are the fellows— such jolly dogs ! 
No better boys under the sun !— 
All full of frolic from mornirg till night, 
And always the first in all fun. 
Then think of the ladies, the dear little pets ! 
In their presence to act what a 
treat ! 
When you rescue the maid from the toils of the wretch, 
You hear them exclaim, 
Oh, how sweet I' 
And think of the glory when the curtain descends, 
And the loud, swelling plaudits are heard ; 
I 
can almost imagine I'm an actor at once, 
Playing—well—' King Richard the Third.' 
Have I 
ever essayed? 
Well, rather, I 
guess ; 
You mustn't quite think me a 
dunce : 
I 
played 
NValsinghatu Potts' in 
Trying It On,' 
At • Private Theatricals' once." 
REALITY. 
" 
Please talk common-sense. Frank, and not like a 
fool , 
Remember you live amono. men ; 
Come down from your trip to the skies, my dear boy, 
And seek terra firma 
gain. 
The theatre, your haven, where, as you may think, 
Enjoy themselves every one must ; 
Thouoh flooded with light and beauty in front, 
Behind is but tinsel and dust. 
Do you think we poor actors are free from all care, - 
And are always ( as on the stage) gay ? 
No matter how ill, or heavy at heart, 
We must laugh, or we forfeit our pay. 
Of glory you spoke, and loud swelling applause, 
But there's one little thing that you missed ; 
Suppose your success of a 
different kind, 
And instead of 
bravos,' you are hissed I 
Now, Frank, learn this lesson, and try to be wise, 
So in future you ne'cr may be told

SKATING ON THE POND. 
Written by HIP.EY Mounts, and, sung by the LANDIS BBOTHRIA. 
OF 
all the winter's pleasures, 
The time to pass away, 
The sleighing and snowballing, 
That we have every day ; 
There's one that suits my fancy, 
Of which I 
am quite fond, 
To go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
CHORUS. 
Spread the eagle, oh, how nice, (Sym.) 
Skating backwards on the slippery ice, (

The pleasures of the winter, 
Of none I 
am so fond, 
As to go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
One pleasant winter's evening, 
At half-past seven or eight, 
I 
went to skate upon the pond, 
And there I 
met my fate. 
She was dressed in blue and Astrakan, 
And skipped along la grand. 
My heart was won by a 
pretty girl, 
While Skating on the Pond.

M.knIA's the pride of the family, 
Her age now is just seventeen, 
Her manner is graceful and winning, 
She's as pretty as ever was seen. 
She waits on a 
fancy goods counter, 
'Tis there all her failing began, 
And of late she has made the acquaintance 
Of an elegant stylish young man. 
CHORUS. 
His name is Josiah, 
He's after Maria, 
To charm her he tries all he can ; 
He's dressed with great care 
And has nice curly hair, 
Such a 
swell is Maria's young man. 
He takes her out walking on Sunday, 
He wears a 
bouquet in his breast, 
He carries a 
cane in his fingers 
And a 
heavy brass chain in his vest. 
He walks arm in arm with Maria, 
While he carries her book and fan, 
And the poor girl with love's going crazy 
Since she met with this fancy young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
He says that his parents are wealthy, 
With mansions in country and town, 
Maria believes all he tells her 
And thinks him a 
gent of renown ; 
But oh ! he's an awful deceiver, 
He lives on a 
very bad plan, 
And when she finds out she'll be sorry 
That she met with this charming young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
Now I 
would advise all youn..• ladies 
Of high-notioned swells to beware, 
They'll do for a 
dance in the parlor, 
Or a 
stroll in the mid-summer air ; 
They keep as their motto forever: 
Do nothing, but get all you can; 
They think the world owes them a 
living, 
Just the same as Maria's young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc.

M IIiE O'BRIEN was a 
politician, 
He always dressed in solid style, 
His ancestors they were patricians 
In the dear old Enfrald Isle. 
Last November he was elected 
For an alderman to be, 
Walhalla Hall he then selected, 
And gave the boys a 
grand soiree. 
229 
CHORUS. 
There was lots of fun for ev'ry one, 
The boys their legs did shake ; 
McGuinness sure, was on the flure, 
In waltzing, he " takes the cake." 
Their hoofs they slung, and songs they sung, 
The girls were gay and free. 
I 
danced all night till broad day-light, 
At O'Brien's grand soiree. 
Felix NcGluff and darling Daisy 
Were called upon to lead the dance ; 
They showed such style it set them crazy, 
As round the room they did advance. 
Then the fun commenced in earnest, 
Hands all around,—all forward four, 
The room it got as hot as a 
furnace, 
While the dancers shook the floor. 
There was lots, etc. 
Pat O'Neil he did get excited 
When Malone made a 
little too free 
With the girl to whom he was plighted, 
And soon there was a 
great melee ; 
The crowd began to fight and sramble, 
The women all commenced to flee, 
They brought me home in several sections 
From O'Brien's grand soiree. 
There was lots, etc-

A 
DASHING young fellow I 
know 
Came round to the house Vother day ; 
He isn't exactly my beau, 
Though perhaps in a 
sort of a 
way. 
He wanted to know if he might— 
How impudent then it did seem ! 
Have the pleasure of taking me out 
For a 
spin with his two-thirty team. 
CHORUS. 
If mother knew it what would she say ? 
Oh, George, get out of the way, 
You should always ask, dear, first if you may. 
If mother knew it what would she say. 
Well, I 
went, and would you believe 1 
How it happened I'm sure I 
don't know, 
The cutter up- set, we were spilled, 
And plunged into three feet of snow ! 
I 
was angry, my new hat was spoiled, 
My circular torn, and my gown ; 
But the worst was, the horses had bolted, 
And we had to walk back into town. 
If mother knew, etc. 
It was just one o'clock in the night 
When we rang at our door in the square ; 
Poor mother was nearly dead with fright, 
And father was cross as a 
bear. 
" 
Never mind,dear," says George with a 
laugh, 
" 
That ride will us happiness bring, 
Say the word, even wink, press my hand, 
I'll hasten and purchase the ring."

THE afternoon was waning, 
The summer sky was bright, 
The promenade was crowded, 
It was a 
glowing sight ; 
The pretty girls were out in style, 
And, as I 
pass'd them by, 
Each charming creature seemed inclined 
For flirting on the sly. 
CHORUS. 
Flirting on the sly, 
It was charming, 
It was charming, 
To stroll along the thoroughfare, 
And look with roguish eye, 
Flirting on the sly ! 
So entrancing, 
While you're glancing! 
With a 
dashing belle 
In love I 
fell 
While flirting on the sly. 
One girl drew my attention, 
A 
beautiful brunette, 
As graceful as a 
fairy, 
Her smile I 
can't forget. 
I 
sought an interview with her 
And this was her reply, 
You'll always find me ready, sir, 
For flirting on the sly. 
Flirting on the sly, etc. 
She lives with her dear parents, 
On her I 
often call, 
We languish at the opera 
And caper at the ball. 
The wedding day is settled now, 
It's coming by-and-by, 
No wonder that I 
sing the praise 
Of flirting on the sly. 
Flirting on the sly, etc.

SOMETHING ABOUT NOTHING. 
TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN. 
NOTHING is nothing, and yet is nothing nothing of an 
insignificant nature, because there is nothing else more 
important in its expressions and conseq.nences than— 
nothing ; consequently, nothing is actually of great im-
portance. 
The world is created out of —nothing. 
Noth-
ing sharpens the dagger of the banditti—it leads the 
vagabond to crime, and brings the murderer to the scaf-
fold. 
Nothing is a 
golden spur to the noble-minded and 
the active. 
Nothing is the leading star to him who is 
nothing, and who does not want to remain nothing. 
He 
Wild) cuo see cm? Hot see nothing ; brit the blind can see it— 
it is the world of the blind. 
He who do's see, and sees 
nothing, who do,- s 
hear, and hears nothing, nets very pru-
ilyntly, and the prudent man is respected by his neighbors. 
Nothing is the lulling-cradle of the blockhead. 
Nothing 
is the spL,ech of the fool ; and to know nothing the wis-
dom of the wise. 
Nothing is the gift of the miser. 
Nothing is the paradise of the fanatic ; and nothing is 
my motive in writing sonAe.thing about nothing.

IMING. 
I'vE often heard it said, that it's nice to be a 
father, 
And have a 
popsey-wopsey of your own ; 
But I'd rather be excused from such a 
little bother, 
Experiences of others I 
have known. 
If any thing will show more plainly than another, 
That. 
George is " off his crank," the reason's plain. 
He's just become a 
dad, and his wife's become a 
mother, 
And they both have got the " baby on the brain 1" 
CHORUS. 
The baby, the baby, it's nothing but the baby! 
They bless it and caress it till it cries with pain ; 
They dance it up and down, and kiss it for it's mother. 
Oh! it's awful to have a " baby on the brain !" 
How proudly does he tell all his friends that he's a 
daddy, 
And wonders why before they had not known ; 
He whistle and he sings, " with my folderolderaddy, 
And " remember, you have children of your own 
BABY Off THE BEAM—Concluded. 
" 
Helen's Babies" have a 
charm, also " Other's People's 
Children," 
He's reads them over time and time again; 
Oh! ain't he got it bad, I'm afraid he won't recover 
From that ailment call'cl the " baby on the brain 1" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
He's tickled most to death when his friends they all 
admire, 
And say he is the image of his dad ; 
They say he's got hia nose, and they anxiously inquire, 
" 
If he's troubled with the colly-wobbles' bad ?" 
The youngster doesn't 
ind the trouble he is making, 
He eats and sleeps, ai 
sleeps and eats again ; 
He's got the thing down 
le, and with baby mirth he's 
shaking, 
For he knows his pop's gc " baby on the brain I" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
But the worst thing of it all, is the naming of the baby ; 
Mamma thinks " George Augustus" would be sweet ; 
Papa does not agree, he says " Christopher Columbus ;" 
And to hear the names proposed is quite a 
tat. 
They finally agree, he's christened plain '• Augustus I" 
Sweet baby, may your glory never wane. 
Now ladies ( pray excuse me), when you are thus afflicted, 
I 
hope you'll not have " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, eto.

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
By GBORGE nOEY. 
NET, you're going to join the profession, I 
hea2:, 
Now, hark to a 
word of advice, 
From one who was born in a 
theatre, 
And has lived your short life over twice. 
Pray don't let the tinsel attract you, . 
For thlt, you must know, is the crust. 
To make it look bright to the every- day world, 
While the apple inside is but dust. 
Here, where we stand, is the theatre's back door, 
The play is just over within,--
What a 
pity it is that some people think 
That door is the portal to sin ; 
And that every poor actress, or actor the same, 
Who toils on the stage for her bread. 
Is an outcast from all that is holy and good, 
And had better by far to be dead. 
But follow me now to that small world within, 
And dodge round the " winos " and the " flats," 
Though take care of your clothes, for it's duty back bare, 
And these stairways are hard ones on hats ; 
So look where you step, mind the numberless traps, 
And shortly I 
think you will say, 
That theatrical life is more than a 
song, 
And an actor's more than mere play. 
Now we stand on the stage, how dreary it looks, 
When stripped of its gorgeous attire ; 
And only this great giant serpent of hose 
In wait for its enemy—fire. 
Look out in the front, where a 
short time ago, 
Sat the audience joyous and (Tay, 
Now there is nothing but gloom, and the place 
Seems best suited for sonic ghostly play. 
There, at the back, are crowded the scenes, 
The " throne," you perceive, is but gilt; 
The " palace," but canvas, the exotics rare; 
Are but paper, they never can wilt. 
(1) 
The great chandeliers are let down by a 
rope, 
And the gasman alters the " moon," 
It all may look fine, I 
daresay, from the front,, 
Back here the bright picture fades soon. 
Now look at the actors; first comes the" star," 
While his servant man carries his bag ; 
Next the " Comedian," weary and sick, 
Who can scarcely his hobs with him ,drag; 
The devil disease claims him for his own, 
As is seen by his fioure so spare, 
And yet as you laughed at hini during the play„ 
You'd have thought be had never a 
care. 
There goes a 
poor ballet girl-just from the stage, 
Though in tatters and rags is she now, 
You never would think that she is the girl 
Who a 
short time ago made a 
bow 
To an audience full of enrapture untold 
At her dancing that neer was surpassed ; 
lier tinsel is changed for that faded plaid shawl 
That protects her fair face from the blast. 
Look thereat your feet, that black yawning ditch 
Where you'd think to see spirits appear, 
is where not long ago the orchestra sat, 
While their music delighted the car ; 
Now look up above to the " borders" and " flies," 
Nov hear how the echo rebounds ; 
The only thing moving outside of ourselves, 
Is the watchman pursuing his rounds. 
Yes, there is, as you say, a 
much brighter E:de, 
For some have (frown rich by their art ; 
But I 
don't think there's one who has been on the stage* 
Who would not feel sick at his heart, 
If a 
daughter or son should follow his steps; 
So, Ned, boy, just take my advice, 
And before you determine to follow this lift, 
Remember this scene, and think twice.

SUAIV. 
I WANDERED down the other day, 
Along the river strand, 
And there I 
met the pretty maid 
That keeps the peanut stand ; 
ogled her, she ogled me, 
She looked so very grand, 
None can surpass the blooming lass 
That keeps the peanut stand, Oh! 
SPOKEN. —You just ought to have seen her. 
She dress'd so neat, she looked so sweet, 
I 
couldn't hardly stand, 
My heart it palpitated so 
It shook the peanut stand. 
Her hair was frizzled o'er her brow, 
Her eyes were slightly crossid, 
Her face was thickly freckled o'er 
Like mildew mixed with frost ; 
Her gown of richest calico 
Hung low upon her neck, 
And sundry graces round her shed, 
With spots of grease bedecked.

Said she, " go lung, old blow." 
She dress'd so neat, eta 
I 
asked her if she'd like to have 
A. man of my estate, 
She munched a 
handful of peanuts, 
And said " you've come too late; 
I 
am the organ grinder's girl 
And him I 
mean to wed, 
Do you suppose I'd give him up 
And marry you instead ?" 
She dress'd so neat, etc. 
Oh how I 
love that peanut girl, 
No one can ever know, 
I 
wish that organ grinder man 
Was grinding down below I 
And now a 
broken-hearted malt 
I 
wander through the land, 
My soul a 
bustin' for the gal 
What keeps the peanut stand. 
She dress'd so neat, ate.

If I 
eould play the organ well 
I'd go to grinding too, 
And I 
would cut as big a

As other grinders do ; 
But as I 
didn't go to lvar 
And lose a 
leg or hand, 
I've lost for aye my pretty lass

Into my loving arms, if I 
Would but the question pop ;

No difficulty find, 
She would not hesitate, but I, 
I 
can't make up my mind! 
The cause why, etc. 
There's Angelina Marigold 
Who would with me slope, 
If to her window I 
would fix 
A ladder made of rope I 
She's lovely and she's beautiful, 
Her purse is richly lined, 
And she'd have me in spite of " pa," but I,

MARY McGUCKEN. 
Sung by W ILLIAM HOZY. 
105 
OH, ladies and gentlemen, listen to me, 
I 
will tell of a 
lady you all did see ; 
She is not very short, she's not very tall, 
She wears a 
pull-back and a 
large waterfall; 
The first time I 
met her I 
shall never forget her, 
She was buying bananas from a 
man in the street; 
Says I, " How's your dad ?" says she, " Get out, you tad, 
Or I 
will hit you a 
lick in the forehead, 
You healthy dead beat. 
CHORUS. 
Her name was 111cGucken, you bet she's a 
tough one; 
She always drinks porter when she's on a 
spree, 
And with her umbrella she could mash any fellow, 
Could Mary McGucken, the pride of Broadway. 
Her hair it was red, her eyes were black, 
Her feet were small, she had a 
hump on her back, 
And when she would sing the air would ring 
Just like a 
liorsecar that got off the track; 
But since I 
last seen her she joined Barnum's Circus ; 
Upon the trapeze she was to appear; 
But when she came out a 
boy did shout, 
So she slid down the rope and walked off on her ear. 
Her name was MeGuckeri, etc.

THERE iS a 
lacl rives upon our floor, 
He sings- a 
song called the Hallway Door ; 
He can beat Levy's Cornet ; or Gilmore's Banci, 
When he's singing The Sheeneys in the Sand; 
With my daughter Mary he cuts a 
dash, 
She told me last night he was her " mash ; " 
She says to him, Tommy, you son of a 
gun, 
Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some fun. 
Last Sunday when I 
came from mass, 
He asked me over to have a 
glass; 
Says I, I'll take a 
drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again. 
I 
sang a 
song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the tarrier, 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fan. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
Greeco-Roman fall. 
If he comes to the house next Sunday night

THE SOUR SROUT BAND. 
Words by E. D. GOODING. Sung by LUKE ScHooLcaAirr. 
Aia.—" Rollicking Rams." 
ONCE I 
was a 
member of de Sour Krout Band, 
Yes, I 
was a 
member of de Sour h 
rout Band, 
They could drink all night and never get tight, 
And bum around till morning. 
Vell, I 
never will forget dem times, 
For I 
veil remember dat I 
spent my dimes, 
What, matter was dat—you see I 
got fat, 
For money we was scorning.. 
Von night I 
went to serenade a 
little Dutch gal fair, 
To tell de truth, I'm much afraid I 
got drunk while I 
was der 
And between lager and benzine, I 
was drunk as ever seen. 
(Speaking.) 
CHORUS . 
Because I 
was a 
member of the Sour Krout Band, 
The Sour Krout Band 
as de happiest in de land, 
Drink lager all night and never get tight, 
And burn around till morning.

thou7ht I 
better go and take me a 
wife, 
For I 
loved a 
Deitch gal dearer than my life, 
She was so poray—dey said she was a 
beauty, 
And she valtzed just like a 
fairy. 
She lived in a 
country whet e 
there was no rows, 
Yes, she lived on a 
farm and she milked de cows, 
And every mornin' she'd drive the town in, 
'1'o sell milk from her fadder's dairy. 
One day when she sold de milk all out, 
I 
ask her to go mit me, 
I 
buy her limberger, lager bier and sour krout, 
low it ended you shall see, 
We had a 
fight—she hit me in de snout.

And we lived so happy, no words or strife 
For about two weeks—when I

She hit me on de head while laying in de bed,

And told her den take warnin'.

IN 
childhood's happy hours, many a 
happy day I 
spent, 
Down by the old mill stream ; 
When we used to go together I 
never shall forget, 
We would laugh and chat and dance upon the green. 
But them days have passed away, and my hair is turning 
gray, 
And it fills this darkey's heart so full of pain, 
When I 
think of my younger days, when I 
would stroll 
away, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
CHORUS. 
But them days have passed and gone, and our hearts ih 
is forlorn, 
For the good old days will never come again ; 
When we used to go together, and pass down by the 
lawn, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
Well do we remember, when our daily work was done 
The songs old rnassa he would like, 
And he would play us lots of music, and we have such 
fun, 
For to see them all a-walking for that cake, 
But the cruel war broke out way down in 
South, 
And we had to leave the cotton fields and roam ; 
And then we bid good-bye, with tears in our eyes, 
To the old wooden gate that's near the lane. 
But them days, etc.-

That bright dream was too beautiful too last, 
And we'll meet as only strangers 
In the future evermore ; 
Our once tender love is buried in the past; 
I've tried to bear the blow 
Without sighs or bitter tears,

But the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I

For thee, darling, whom I

I'm going to give you all a 
little warning. 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed in 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen. 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen. 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation.

We will dance (

And we will raise the very divil in the nation. 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, we will have a

When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me, 
Then I 
will drive away all care and aggravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have some fun,

BOTIL—Throwli sunshine or foul weather, 
As one, we two shall be; 
And sweetly well live together, 
For dere's nothing de matter mit me. 
Wonat and fatigued with travelling, I 
stopped for a 
night on the 
road, 
At a 
public house called 4- 
The Lantern, or Miner's Retreat and 
Abode," 
Whence nightly, around beer-stained tables, are gathered these 
toilers of earth ; 
While loud songs o'er their full " pints o' bitter," give signs of 
their unstinted mirth. 
I 
at once made my way to the tap- room, and booked myself 
there for the night, 
But confess I 
was somewhat bewildered at the strange and 
weird looking sight ; 
For the glare of the few half burnt candles, as it fell on these 
hard- featured men, 
With rough beards and hair all disheveled, brought to my mind 
some dark den 
Or cave, the haunt of bold robbers, who live by the fruit of their 
knife, 
With no knowledge of" tneum and tuurn," and little regard for 
one's life. 
As I 
seated myself at the table, drinking my measure of beer, 
One, who seemed foreman among them, read in a 
voice loud 
and clear, 
From a 
paper " he got down from Lannon," and the news, the' 
not very late, 
Was as eagerly listened to by them as if it were yesterday's 
date; 
When suddenly, one from among them, started with eyes star-
ing wide, 
And in less time than I 
Wie to tell it, stood by the reading 
man's side; 
DOWN IN frall hiLNE.—Continued. 
For his eyes caught the large lettered heading, and seizing the 
paper, he read ; 
" 
Melbourne-81h of October— Brandon, the mine owner dead !" 
" 
Nay, take your hands off me, comrades, the man who has 
just passed away, 
Carried Job Thorndyke's curse with him, and my curse over-
took him that day ; 
For ten long years I 
have tracked him, and sought him by foul 
means and fair ; 
But he's gone to a 
Higher Tribunal, and the Great Judge will 
try him up there. 
Hark, lads, till I 
tell you my story; I'll make it as brief as I 
can : 
You knew when I 
first came among you, I 
had been in the 
mine, boy and man, 
You know if my hand could assist you my tongue should never 
say 
no ; 1 
But, now, lads, I'm going to tell you something that none of 
you know. 
I 
once had a 
mate who worked with me, and stood by my side 
from a 
boy ; 
We first handled pickax together in the mines on the Moors of 
Glenroy. 
Phil had one care, 'twas his daughter, the pride and joy of the 
town, 
Who stood by the shaft every morning, and kissed him before 
be went down. 
One day, I 
shall never forget it, I 
came to the mine rather late, 
Nelly, his daughter, was with me, she had joined me below at 
his gate ; 
Her diamond eyes looted up to'ards mine, and a 
smile lit up 
her briaht face, 
When we suddenly heard an explosion, and our very mine was 
ablaze. 
We ran till we came to the derrick, where round the shaft's 
mouth, row by row, 
Stood the widows and little half orphans of the poor fellows 
burning below; 
ieekibe 
• 
DOWN IN THE MINE.—Continued. 
Then the basket came up heavy laden with those who had grape 
pled w:th death, 
And left the fiell wounded and dying, some having spent their 
last breath, 
stood for a 
moment bewildered ; when Nally pulled hard at 
my coat 
And said to me, ' Job, where's my papa V—then something 
stuck fast in my throat, 
And my eyes filled all full of water, and I 
called to the men at 
the line, 
As I 
jumped in the now burning basket, ` Who's with me, lads, 
down in the mine ?' 
Three stood at my side in a 
moment, ell eager for glory and 
fame. 
The signal was g:ven to lower us down in that red sea of flame. 
Once I 
tried to shout Faster,' but the smoke deprived me of 
breath ; 
When at last we stood at the bottom, in the city of carnage and 
death. 
I 
had not stepped over ten paces when I 
stumbled and fell to 
the ground ; 
But that fill brought me good fortune, for ' twas none other 
than Phil I 
bad found. 
He was up in my arms in a 
moment, to the pit-bole I 
then 
quickly came, 
But there disappointment o'ertook us— the basket was one sheet 
of flame; 
I 
tightened my arms round his body, with the other the stout 
chain I 
grasped ; 
Phil tried to murmur out something, but his bead fell back as 
he gasped. 
I 
then Felled the Clain for the signal, which, thank God, they 
understood ri-ht, 
And soon we were bound on our joyrney up to the great land. 
of 1:ght. 
.Nelly then sprang to her father, who laid there a 
poor .broken 
mass ; 
He said to me, ' Job, for old time's sake, have a 
kind eye to ttly 
lass ; 
(8) 
NW' 
DOWN IN THE MINE.—Conoluded. 
And, Nelly, love him as your father.' 
These were the Iasi 
words he said ; 
And the soul of honest Phil Morris up a 
golden and silver shaft 
sped. 
I 
took Nelly home to the cabin—she proved the sole joy of my 
life— 
And when her years blossomed upon her, the church made us 
both man and wife. 
We lived as happy together as any poor couple can ; 
But at last were stung by a 
serpent, that came in the shape of a 
man. 
He shared a 
place in the household, at table sat by my side, 
But when I 
was down in the darkness he poisoned the ear of 
my bride; 
And one night when I 
came to the cabin, I 
found my pretty 
bird flown, 
And I 
sank on my knees by the bedside, when I 
found I 
was 
left all alone. 
Years and years I 
sought for her, and at last, one cold winter's 
day, 
Found her, stricken with fever, where the villain had east her 
away. 
She sued to me then for forgiveness—she had it—and all that 
I 
said 
Was, ' Nelly, I 
sought till I 
found you, and so kept my word 
with the dead.' 
When Nelly died I 
searched for him; my conscienco would neer 
let me he ; 
But I 
read my revenge in this paper from all the way over the 
sea. 
My story and mission are ended; what comes to me now I 
don't care ; 
He stands in the dock for his trial, and they have no acquittet 
up there." 
And so his story was finished ; all was as still as the tomb ; 
He slowly folded the paper, and made his way out of the room. 
I 
have oft thought of the sad recital—told with no eloquence 
fine, 
And see how that sorrow and misery will even creep " Down La 
the Mine."

What boundless joy it brings to me I 
Why did my hopes so sooa decay, 
And my only treasure from me flee. 
Could not my lot in life have easier been, 
Why was she so soon the angels' choice ? 
Alas ! from earth her spirit's flown, 
Never more I'll hear her voice,

When I 
was a 
boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I 
had a 
very bad habit of helping myself 
My mother put every thing out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say : 
CHORUS. 
You may look, but you mustn't touch, 
Mutsn't touch, keep your hands off, 
You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude. 
(
Repeat.) 
At eight years oi age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to ne: 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid, 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this : 
You may look, etc. 
When we were engaged, I 
said, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day; 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her say: 
You may look, etc. 
FACES IN THE FIRE. 
By GEORGE foxy. 
I'VE oft in boyhood crept up to the fire 
And watched the faces fashioned by the blaze; 
Which soon as formed as quickly would retir 
As do the fancies of our younger days. 
And even now, when in mature old ace, 
I 
watch the faces as they come and go. 
They form a 
story written on life's page— 
A 
story full of weal and full of woe. 
I 
there have seen my own face as a 
boy, 
All wreathed in smiles, unknown to grief or care, 
Beyond the breaking of some favorite toy— 
A 
face on which its Ihovtlits were all laid bare. 
Look at it now, as left by Time's hard hand— 
For care and sorrow both have made their mark— 
My brow's as withered as yon burning brand ; 
My smile e'en pales beside the flickering spark. 
And sometimes faces we have learnt to loathe 
Our fancy shapes beneath our very eyes, 
And dearest friends beside the bitterest foes 
From out the embers steadily arise. 
-Oh, if we knew but where to draw the line 
'Twixt loving hearts and hearts as black as night, 
About our lives then fondly would entwine 
Some flowering shrub instead of parasite. 
And oft methought the fire would blaze anew, 
And then a 
group of little faces came, 
Whose beaming eyes have thrilled me thro' and thre, 
Whose smiles outvied the brightness of the flame. 
What man can look on such a 
happy scene 
And feel no pride or joy within him rife 3 
Such little faces gathered there are e'en 
The stepping- stones in every father's life. 
And then a 
brighter face than all the rest 
Would lovingly look up from out the blaze, 
And make me think that all my life was blest, 
In having one so good to cheer my days. 
For, thouoh from clitne to clime a 
man may roam, 
He finds how dreary soon becomes his life, 
Without a 
purpose and without a 
home, 
1Vithout a 
faithful, true, and loving wife. 
And so I 
often wheel my easy chair 
Toward the bridt and ever cheerful blaze, 
And hour by hour I 
sit before it there, 
And think upon my boyhood's joysome days. 
So will my children do when I 
am gone, 
For this same fancy they will soon acquire, 
And often sit until the morning's dawn, 
To gaze upon the Faces in the Fire.

W ELL, there now, did you ever 'I 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold ; 
Because when men come courting, 
not reserv'd or cold ; 
Now, gents, pray tell time, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry 7 
BPOKEN.—No, 
! I'm sure you would rather I'd say--
CHORUS. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me I 
Once more, only, love, to try ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me! 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss, 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er thought men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be ; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay ; 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.— But I've made up my mi nd 
th at 
w hen the rig' 
one comes along I'll say— 
Keep on kissing, et

I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tim' not much yet he's said ; 
But truly from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed ; 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft, we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.- Oh, yes ! I 
tell you, these giddy girls who kee; 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever wer. 
caught!" 
They forget that sometimes they lose their bait 
ot for me! 
Oh, no I I'll continue saying— 
Keep . 
on kissing, ete. 
MULDOON'S PARTY. 
Dedicated to the I. X. L. Club. 
Sung by JAMES BRADLEY. 
M ULDOON gave an evening party, 
his friends, he invited them all ; 
There was Roger O'Malley, so hearty, 
And the mall with a 
terrible gall ; 
They drove up to the door in hand- carts by dozens, 
With Mulligan's band they danced gay and free; 
They kept up the fun till daylight in the morning, 
The sights of the evening I'll now tell to thee. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
arrived there it just struck half- past six 
by the City Hall clock—I 
paid the expressman for conveying 
me. 
When I 
entered the party, the first one I 
laid eyes on was 
my well- established friend, Muldoon ; he was walking up and 
down the floor with a 
swallow- tail coat. 
The next one I 
spied 
was Jakey Wool'enstein. 
Jake was reading the last scene of 
that elegant drama entitled, " Number Seven." 
Mulcahey 
jumped up and said, " Ladies and gentlemen, if you have no ob-
jection, I 
will open the harmony of the evening." 
So he be-
SONG. 
I'vt got a 
girl—she plays croquet, 
She never ‘vinlis while on Broadway ; 
She never laughs, or can she hear, 
She's lost her sight in her left-hand ear ; 
She never goes without good clothes, 
In the summer, when it snows ; 
She never crawls without she creeps, 
Without her eyes she never sleeps. 
CIIMICS. 
She walks along 
And sings a 
song, 
She'll eat a 
fig 
And dance a 
jig;

Compared with her 
There's none so fine; 
You can bet ycur life

SPOKEN.—Well, after he got through, lie had the final call, 
so he called upon McCarthy, the umbrella man ; lie tried to he 
excused by telling the people he caught cold selling fans in an 
ice- house. But it was a 
poor excuse; McCarthy was the author 
of several (if the latest songs, such as 
The Gftl with the Doe-
skin Ear," " Lawdling at the Breeze," " They couldn't Link the 
Dinkey," and " There's a 
Prize in every Doughnut ;" but hI 
favorite song was " The Umbrella Mn," which he sang. 
BrronE you stands one Mike McCarthy, 
I'm a 
man so stout and hearty, 
Take in every ball and party, 
From Harlem Bridge to City II:41; 
Never care for rainy weather, 
As long as the gang will stick 0g,ethey, 
Will strike you with a 
club or feather, 
I'm not giving you no stall; 
I'll tell to you before you buy, 
I'll sell you cheap, not very high ; 
It will keep you warm and very dry, 
A 
dollar and a 
half, take one and try. 
CrICHICS. 
Mend your umbrela's handy, 
Never care for gin or brandy; 
Very fond of mol isses candy, 
To tell the truth the best I 
can; 
Never care fo: pie or pastry, 
Abvays try to look gate tasty, 
In a 
passion I 
am never hasty,

Tot happened to a 
fellow called Hans, 
And an another one—do'ts me. 
Hans and his gal was married oh, 
I

And all dem felows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree. 
There was Gotleb and .1l,ke, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake the fool, 
And Openheimer and we. 
Openheimer he got druhk, 
And conic down on his head ker-plunk, 
Just as Gotleb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch cheese, 
hoop in, set ' em up anain, 
Knock ' em down again, set cm up again, 
fonder vedder set 'em up again, 
Drunken Dutchmen was we.

Row just then, row just then, 
When in came four big policemen

THERE NEVER WAS A COWARD WHERE THE 
SHAM ROCK G RO W
. 
As sung with great success by JOHNNY PATTr.,ICSOlsr, the Great 
Irish Clown. 
LET cowardly slanderers say what they may 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain in spite of its foes 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth ; 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen.; 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their fan: 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
cHonus. 
Pat May be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity, as everybody knows, 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppressed and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefathers had, 
For that they cannot take away ; 
They kept learning from us, stole all we held dear., 
And crushed us till others cried shame ; 
But in spite of all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. .

One beauteous Sabbath day ; 
Such eyes I

While 'neath her jaunty hat there peep'd

A 
face such as we sometimes dream 
Are met in fairer worlds, 
While 'neath her jaunty hat there peep'd 
A

The sunbeams fell aslant upon 
The throng of worshippers, 
The soft airs flitted in and out 
Like viewles'.s messengers ; 
The organ's tone ne'er seem'd so sweet, 
So thrilling, nor the pause 
That follow'd half so sacred ; how 
I 
wonder who she was!

Personified in clay. 
A 
face such as we, ete 
And when my memory treaclfrous proved, 
Au ! sweet misfortune's lot I 
A 
dainty finger pointed out 
The sacred hymn forgot; 
How well our voices harmonized— 
I 
can't divine the cause; 
But some new cause seeni'd to be woke— 
I 
wonder who she was I 
A 
face such as we, etc, 
The benediction resting on 
Each bowed devoted head, 
I 
wished them but the opening word 
Of ritual instead ; 
I 
took my hat to go like one 
Who leaves a 
charmed place, 
While 'mid that multitude I 
saw 
But one—an angel face I 
A 
face such as we, etc. 
Sabbaths have come, and Sabbaths gone, 
Full many a 
time since then; 
And I 
with care still seek me out 
The same seat—but in vain: 
That face is not in all that throng; 
Still, red by faith's stern laws, 
My heart repeateth o'er and o'er, 
"I wonder who she was ! " 
A 
face such as we, eto.

TRERE'S a 
charming young fellow now roaming about, 
Who loves all the girls in his way ; 
They say he's a" catch" but of that them's a 
doubt, 
For a 
single young man he will stay. 
He flirts and sighs, and tells such lies, 
Each one is sure she has a

And he has such a

That one girl to another will say : 
Beware L

There's old Mrs. Brown with a 
daughter so sweri, 
She thought him an excellent beau ; 
She allowed Mary Jane his attentions to meet, 
And told her to never say no ! 
But then there came a " mutual friend," 
With tales that seemed to have no end ; 
These warning words she heard with pain : 
Believe me. what I 
say, Mary Jane— 
Beware, beware, beware!" 
He isn't, etc. 
He dresses with care, rufl he's known ev'rywhere, 
lie goes with the rich and the poor ; 
Sometimes he will drive a 
poor girl to despair, 
Till she thinks his affections are sure. 
But by-and-by, away he'll fly, 
And there she's left to droop and sigh, 
With sympathetic voices near 
To whisper these words in her ear— 
"Beware, beware, beware!" 
He isn't, etc.

WntLE going to the matinee the other afternoon, 
I 
pass'd, of course, upon the road, a 
gentlemen's saloon, 
A 
lot " nobby " boys were there, as usual " dressed to kill," 
Their corporations look'd as tho' they all had had their fill; 
Each fellow bad a 
flashy tie or bow about his neck, 
While all were eating toothpicks by the gallon ; quart or peck 
Just then, a 
short and portly chap, more cheeky then the rest, 
Stepp'd up and said, " Good evening, miss, you look your very 
best."

No, no, no, not if I 
know it, not if I 
know it, no, 
On me you can't play sugar sweet, so get right up and go. 
At last I 
reached the theatre not much like one forsook, 
For I 
was " laughing in my sleeve" about the chap I" shook ;" 
The audience was very large, the men were plenty too, 
But luckily I 
had a 
scat where they were very few; 
An empty chair beside me answered for my parasol, 
When lo, the usher ushered in a 
gent both lean and tall; 
He'd scarce been there a 
moment when lie whispered in my ear, 
" 
Ha, ha, I've caught you, darling one—my love, how came you 
here?" 
No, no, no, etc. 
The play at last was over, so I 
started for my borne, 
Determined never more to go to matinees alone; 
I 
pass'd the gents' saloon again,- they all were standing them, 
I 
also saw the wan that sat beside me in the chair; 
But just as they got sight of me one said, " Boys, aint you dry ?'• 
" 
Of course we are," they all replied, and .4 
tumbled to their rye.' 
Now, ladies, if you ever should be plagued as I 
have been,

it's something you can't well explain ; 
Sometimes you are fervent, sometimes you are cold, 
'Tis a 
mixtilre of pL'itsure and pain. 
rve lately been caught in that dangerous net 
By a 
creature m charming and fair, 
She has me enchanted, you know how it is, 
I

I guess you have all been there,

You know, I

I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
take her out walking beneath the bright moon, 
And whisper the old loving tale ; 
The sound of her voice drives away all my gloom, 
We wander by hillside and vale, 
Thro' meadows and groves, like two little doves, 
We ramble it matters not where ; 
I

Her father is wealthy and very high-toned,

But will my request be allowed ? .

And make my love melt into air ; 
Then what shall I 
do ? now my friends I 
ask you, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
I'll keep up my courage and to her be true, 
Although the old gent may oppose ; 
I'll wait at the gate for my sweet little Kate, 
Till time all his hate overthrows ; 
I'll press her soft hand and I'll call her my own, 
While together a 
sweet kiss we share, 
And before I 
go 'way—but what more need I 
say ? 
I

Now, kind friends, do look at me, 
And an ole man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday ; 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle, 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle, 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay; 
Dem was de good old times, 
When you could save- de dimes, 
But now dat time am gone and pass'd away ; 
But give me de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
When old man Hickory Jackson had his day. 
(Dance.) 
One thing more I'd like to say 
Just before I 
go away, 
Of de times I 
used to have in Dixie's land; 
I 
use to hoe de corn 
From de breaking of de morn, 
And many a 
clod of earth has bruise'd dese hands, 
But when de work was done 
We darkeys had de fun ; 
Ole Massa got our jug and elear'd de way 
For de old Virginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel, 
Dat's when old man Hickory Jackson had his day.

W HILE strolling by a 
running brook 
One evening in July, 
I 
met a 
maid so lovely, 
I 
winked at her so sly ; 
Her eyes shone like the brilliant stars 
That wink'd at us, you know; 
I 
took her hand and led her on, 
Down where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
For she is a 
fairy queen, 
The fairest ever seen ; 
I 
bless the day she came that way, 
Down where the violets grow. 
I 
gathered flowers and decked her hair, 
And called her my sweet dove 
She whispered very softly, 
" 
You are the one I 
love !" 
I 
asked her then to come again 
Where the waters rippling flow; 
She murmured as she kissed my cheek, 
Down where the violetszrow. 
For she is a 
fairy queen, etc.

IME is not a 
man in the whole minstrel band, 
. 
Who would ever go back on his friend ; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which thro' life him attend; 
I 
hear the echo sounding, sounding 
In notes lout and clear thro' the land ; 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band! 
Then hurrah, then hurrah, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band. 
I 
will speak first of one 'whom we lov'd in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave ; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refus'd his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger ' mould save; 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
The tall son of York, he has died at his work, 
And the pride of the minstrel band! 
He was the pride, the pride, 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band, 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true, 
'fill defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth alas, broke his old banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, ' till lie parted with breath , 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
They lived and they died with the boys that they loy'sl, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band ; 
The dear boys, the dear boys, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band. 
But now I 
must speak of the prince of them all— 
Who is that but our own gailant Dan'? 
Let ev'ry-one mourn, for our chieftain i 
gone, 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrel and man 
Let all his praises be sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
lie liv'd and he died both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band; 
He was king, he was king, 
He was king of the Minstrel Band.

And this is what she said—

I'll strike you with a

Oh, when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My ‘vife she made me a 
present 
Of a

And when at night he'd holler for his paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd sing—

On, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
I 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy ; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew this darling she had won me 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it heat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true ? I 
often sit and. wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there, 
With sweet laughing eyes, etc.

OH 
let not this thought for a 
moment possess you, 
That if you have wealth all your cares would be o'er ; 
Believe me, you'd often find much to distress you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
How many there are who would part with their treasure, 
Could they but obtain a 
few moments' repose, 
But ah ! they, alas ! are denied the sweet pleasure, 
While fled from each cheek is the hue of the rose. 
CHORUS. 
Then let not this thought for a 
moment possess you, 
That if you had wealth all your cares viculd be o'er; 
Believe me, you'd often find much to distress you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Behold that young man, from his home just departed, 
In foolish extravagance wasting his all, 
And then turn your eyes to his friends, broken-heal-tea. 
Whose sorrowful tale would your spirit appal. 
Go wander awhile where the cypress is bending, 
And see the grand lady with heart sad and sore, 
While fast from her eyes are the tear-drops descending. 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Then let not this, etc. 
The miser at night with his bags full of treasure, 
Oh ! think you he's happy when counting them o'er ? 
A 
mere puff of wind very soon mars his pleasure, 
He fancies a 
robber is forcing his door. 
Then while you have health and your kindred are near 
you, 
In heart be contented and ask nothing more; 
If a 
million you had, still you'd need more to cheer you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Then let not this, eta.

I 
nr.m.r.mnEft one eve when you sat by my side, - 
Your face then was handsome and fair, 
asked you, then, darling, if you'd be my bride, 
While I 
toyed with your bonnie brown hair. 
I 
saw the sweet answering look that you gave, 
With true love expressed in your eye, 
Your answer was low like the wind's gentle wave, 
But my heart scarcely needed reply. 
CHORUS. 
Your answer then, darling, was music to me, 
It came so enchanting and low, 
Your sweetly whispered yes, to my heart still 
replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Your sweet whispered yes, to my heart still 
replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Our hearts are the same, tho' the years have gone by, 
Great trials we both have pass'd through, 
Together we'll cling and together we'll die, 
With our love never fading and true. 
We've lived thro' our pleasures, we've lived thro'i 
our pain, 
For life has its ebb and its flow, 
We seem to be living those days o'er again, 
When we loved in the sweet long ago.

ONE day in the street, I 
just happen'd to meet 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man looked sad, tho' to meet me was glad, 
And liii eyes as we spoke fill'd with tears. 
I 
said, " John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief ? 
To me your misfortunes unfold." 
Said he, " In poor me, you a 
sample may see 
Of how a 
man's served when he's old." 
CHORUS. 
"Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're 
"I began as a 
lad, and a 
hard place I 
had, 
Which I 
held for some forty-five years ; 
I've worked like a 
slave, yet no money could save, 
And now I 
may starve it appears. 
What I've had to endure is hard I 
am sure, 
Now by the young master I'm told 
I 
mast no longer stay, but for others make way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each day growing, etc. 
" 
When young I 
was praised and my wages were raised, 
No labor I'd ever then shirk, 
And master would then point me out to the men 
As the one who best stuck to. his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak. 
Unless it's to grumble or scold ; 
They simply make ftm of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each day growing, etc, 
" 
My wife, poor soul I 
she is near seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know, 
If I 
beg I 
intrude, by p'iice am pursued, 
And if to the work-house we go 
To seek for relief, they but add to our grief, 
L Yon must come in the house,' we are told. 
Part husband from wife to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old." 
Each day growing, et,!...

JOHNNY, TAKE THE CHILD ACROSS YOUR 
KNEE. 
I'm a 
hardy working man and I 
do the best I 
can, 
When I 
come home from labor every day ; 
My vire at me does stare when I 
sit in the chair, 
She whip Ts in my ear and to me says : 
Our darling little boy the neighbors do annoy, 
He smashed in Mrs. Murphy's window pane ; 
She says she'll git a 
cop if the rascal doesn't stop, 
Then she'll roll her arms around me and exclaim : 
CHORUS. 
Johnny, take the child across your knee, 
To-day he's been a 
bad boy to me; 
Learn him the golden rule and send him off to Echool, 
Arrah, Johnny, take the child across your knee. 
This darling son of mine is so gentle and so kind, 
He's always playing " Duck upon the Rock ;" 
When he goes out to play, sure he's always led astray 
By all the little gossoons on the block. 
They take him on the street, and every Turk he meets, 
He fires a 
brick at him and runs away ; 
Then the neighbors will complain and say that I'm to 
blame, 
Then my darling wife to me will say : 
Johnny, take the child, etc. 
My heart is nearly broke, sinc2 my boy commenced to 
smoke, 
You'll find him on the corner picking stumps ; 
He's acquainted with the slang, he's in with all the gang, 
He's always Playing base ball on the dump. 
But now he's got so tall and le takes in every ball, 
And hangs out with the loafers every day ; 
My wife is nearly wild since she lost her darling child, 
When I 
return from work no more she'll say : 
Johnny, take the child, etc.. 
YOU GIP! 
As sang by CHARLES and LEWIS D3CESTADER. 
SHE was very smart an' she owned a 
cart, 
Her maiden name was Pat; 
'Deed, she owned a 
mule an' she went to school, 
She was dumpy, short an' fat. 
Oh, her given name was Jane, 
It was a 
shame, but she was lame, 
She was a 
brakeman on a 
cattle train, 
And her parents all lived in Fort Wayne. 
Oh, I 
asked her for a 
kiss, a 
little kiss, 
And she told me this: 
She whispered like an angel, " Yoi travel— 
Now—umph—phist—you git !" 
Oh! I 
won her heart, we sold de cart, 
An' we gave away de mule; 
Well, she hemmed and hawed, she cried an' jawed, 
And she said I 
was a 
fool; 
She owned a 
dog that was full of fleas, 
An' on my knees I 
used to tease. 
Seven long years I 
coaxed her to marry, 
But I 
ne'er could her please. 
She would laugh, but she wouldn't cry, 
Wish I 
may die ! well, I 
wouldn't lie— 
Oh I 
she whispered, " Skip the gutter, young fellow 
Now—umph—phist—you git I" 
GIVE ME THE GIRL THAT IS TENDER AND 
TRUE. 
Sung with great SUCCCS3 by ITARItY W ALKER.. 
Mr tastes they are simple, I 
care not for wealth, 
So long as I'm blest with a 
good share of health. 
I'll tell you my wants, and I 
think you'll agree 
That it takes very little to satisfy me ; 
I 
am not ambitious, and ne'er spent an hour 
In pining for place, or position, or power, 
No envy have I 
for our rulers above, 
But I 
glory in gaining true friendship and love. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the girl that is tender and true, 
Give me the friend that is faithful to you, 
Give me a 
glass, a 
pipe, and a 
song, 
Then PH be as happy as the days are long. 
In search of enjoyments, wherever we roam, 
There's none that can equal the sweet joys of home ; 
If there we have kindness, contentment, and rest, 
Domestic felicity I 
think the best ; 
Let some seek for fame upon far distant fields, 
And find what an empty illusion it yields, 
Let others take pleasure however they may, 
I'll still enjoy life in my own quiet way. 
Give me the girl, eta 
'Tis no use to worry and flurry I 
find, 
To gather up hoards that we must leave behind, 
Regrets will not alter our station a 
jot, 
So try to be happy whatever yeur lot ; 
Remember that happiness does not depend 
Upon the amount of cash you can spend, 
Those days are most pleasant, and so are the nights, 
That are passed in the simplest and purest delights. - 
Give me the girl, .etc. 
You'll own ere my FOng to a finish is brought, 
True friendship and love they are not to he bought, 
In them yon can trust whate'er may befall, 
And that's why I 
prize them as dearer than all; 
The pipe has a 
soothing effect on the mind, 
The glass and the song cheer the heart when combined, 
With friends al around, and the girl you admire, 
What else is there left in this world to desire ?

Give me the girl,

Night and day I'm happy and gay, 
Heavy in debt, and never can pay; 
The fact is known by every one, 
I 
haven't much money, but lots of fun. 
To get to the ball sometime ago, I 
wish I 
never had tried, 
Cash for a 
ticket of course I'd none, but managed to pass 
inside. 
But how I 
got out is a 
puzzle to me, for, much to my 
surprise, 
A 
tall swell there, who got up the affair, soon bung'd up 
both my eyes.

case with me. 
I 
take matters cool if in trouble I 
get, whenever I'm out

spree. 
But should a 
chap block my brand new tile, or rumple 
my Sunday clothes, 
It's ten to one that this beisCrous fun will end in a 
patch'd-up nose. 
Night and day, etc. 
I've had some plaguy visits to-day from tradesmen, over 
a 
score, 
Begging that I 
some bills would pay, and threatening me 
with law. 
I 
told them all I'd give them a 
call when the ship came 
home from sea, 
P:44 didn't they rave when I 
whistled a 
stave of " You'll

COULD TELL IT IF I 
FELT IT IN THE 
DARK. 
M sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
thousand funny things a 
comic singer sings, 
To you no doubt revealing, 
And really on my word it is seldom that I've heard 
A 
song that touches on the art of feeling. 
There is a 
power, understand, in the grip of the hand, 
As one man to another may remark. 
And oft you'll hear them say of the things they see by 
day--
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
CHORE'S. 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark ; 
I 
like it very much, I 
know it by its touch, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
Sometimes we chance to hold some silver or some gold, 
That may be the case with many ; 
But he is very poor who never from his store 
Can afford to finger more than a 
penny. 
Sometimes we have to spend and °Mimes to lend, 
And all of us do like a 
jolly lark ; 
But what so be the coin on which my fingers join, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
I 
could tell it, etc. 
The other day I 
chanced to meet a 
maiden fair and 
sweet, 
Beneath an old tree so shady, 
She pledged to me her vow, I 
will not tell you now; 
Some day I 
mean to wed that little lady. 
I 
tell you it is bliss to steal from her a 
kiss 
While roaming together in the park, 
And as my arm was placed in a 
circle round her waist, 
For I'm always in to have a 
jolly lark. 
I 
could tell it, etc.

W HEN I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below. 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a wreath for thee, 
All the little children 
Sang so sweet to me ; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and bouquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gayly did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike anti Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, etc. 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer. 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn, the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers, Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, eto.

LITTLE darling, how I 
miss thee, 
How my heart cloth ache with pain, 
How I 
love and long to kiss thee 
On thy rosy lips again, 
For my heart is wildly beating, 
And I 
long to call thee mine; 
See the days are sadly fleeting, 
Let me worship at thy shrine, 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, sweet, I 
love you, 
With a 
love that's bright and clear, 
As those shining stars above you., 
I 
am truly yours sineere„ (
Repeat Chorus.) 
With sweet kisses let me greet thee, 
Where the blooming roses grow, 
And like violets when you meet me, 
Let your cheeks with blushes glow. 
Happy thoughts around me hover. 
'Neath the sunshine of your smile, 
Call me not your truant lover, 
I'll be constant all the while, 
Little darling, sweet, eta 
Still my thoughts are turning ever 
To those happy days gone by, 
And my eyelids faintly quiver 
As the tear drops from my eye. 
One sweet word now gently spoken 
Will my drooping spirit cheer, 
Give me but this little token, 
For ' twill ease the falling tear. 
Little darling, sweet, etc.. 
Let me not from dreams awaken, 
Finding only grief and woe, 
Listen to the vows I've taken, 
To be true where'er I 
go. 
Let those shadows fade behind me, 
Let the sun no longer shine, 
Though sad tears may fall and blind me, 
Little darling you are mine. 
Little darling, sweet, etc..

COME again, sweet days of summer, 
With your blue and cloudless skies, 
Bring to me a 
cherished maiden, 
With her sweet and dreamy eyes; 
In the meadows and the valleys 
We will gayly trip once more, 
And exchange our loving kisses 
At the vine-clad cottage door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my charming little sweetheart, 
With the soft and dreamy eyes; 
Oh, I 
never shall forget her, 
Fairest maiden ' neath the skies. 
Come again, my pretty songsters, 
Sing your glees for her and I; 
Call us to the shady forests 
Where you perch on twigs so high; 
Cheer us with your harmless twitter, 
Pill our hearts with new delight, 
Let the woodland ring with music 
Till you take your nest at night. 
Oh, my charming, etc. 
come again, oh, gentle breezes, 
Scented with the new-mown hay, 
Bring the flavor of the clover 
From the fields and pastures gay 
Waft the echo of the mowers 
Singing far across the lea, 
And remind my little sweetheart 
She must ever think of me. 
Oh, my charming, etc.

Academy of Music, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
M Y 
mother-in;law's a 
talker, she's always on the jaw, 
She's talked me out of everything I 
own ; 
She's a 
regular old huffer, the worst I 
ever saw ; 
I 
hope she'll kick the bucket, very soon. 
She's got eyes like a 
mackerel, a 
mouth Elio 9, street 
door; 
She can look two ways, and never squint, 
Oh, she talks and chins all day, till she couldn't talk no 
more ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
She is luny, she is crazy, 
She can knock the stuffing out of any man, 
She would talk you blind, if you didn't mind, 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
Sometimes she makes it lively and goes for my hair, 
And pulls me all around the room. 
I 
wish she was in heaven, or where she couldn't rare, 
She ought to take a 
trip up to the moon. 
Her tongue goes like a 
clapper, it is loose at both ends, 
She has jawed and talked me nearly blind ; 
She is jawing in the morning, through the day, and 
through the night ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc. 
And when she goes to bed, and I 
think she's gone to 
sleep, 
Then she starts again with her old mouth ; 
I'd like to see her buried, a 
tear I'd never weep; 
She talks worse than the niggers 
South, 
A 
talking machine to her, you can't ..-ournpare ; 
She's worse than thirty-seven howling bulls ; 
She Would talk a 
car conductor out of his fare ; 
Such a 
terrible talker, is Z2.1y mother-in-law. 
She is luny, ' 41. 
NO TIDINGS FROM OVER THE SEA. 
Sung by DAVE ROCIIE with well-merited success. 
I 
HAVE waited so long now, my darling, 
To hear from you day after day, 
For you promised to send me a 
message, 
Oh, tell me, why do you delay ? 
You know that my heart is so lonely 
Since I 
have been parted from thee, 
For each day passing by brings no message 
From over the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
No tidings from over the sea, 
No sweet words of love, dear to me, 
Each day passing by brings no message, 
No tidings from over the sea. 
Oh, you promised you'd never forget me, 
Nor the waves of the sea e'er divide, 
Though the billows of blue roll between us, 
In my thoughts you are still by my side. 
My lips feel your kisses no longer, 
And ever my heart calls for thee, 
For each day passing by brings no letter 
No tidings from over the sea. 
CHORUS. 
No tidings from over the sea, 
No sweet words of love, dear to me, 
Each day passing by brings no letter, 
No tidings from over the sea.

THERE was a 
bold young Brigadier, 
Maguffiu was his name; 
Among all social characters, 
He won desarvin' fame; 
But now the scenes he made so gay, 
Have lost their life and joy ; 
He's gone away and left us. 
Oh I 
he was a 
dacent boy. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone far away, 
But where I 
could not say; 
He left the politicians all in sorrow and dismay; 
There's not such a 
man from here to Dublin bay; 
Maguffin! Oh, Maguffin! 
Why did you go away ? 
He wore a 
stand-up collar, 
And a 
necktie made of blue; 
Likewise a 
handsome black mustache 
With a 
little curlicue ; 
He had an ivory handle 
On his dandy walkin' cane ; 
And a " dicer," smooth and shiny, 
Kept the weather from his brain. 
He's gone far away, etc. 
*" Maguffin" was an intimate friend of " Mulcahy."

N'or okin' or for fightin', 
Sure he never could be bate; 
'o see him ate roast turkey, 
'Twas a 
pleasure and a 
thrate. 
I 
her.r them say he fell in love 
Wid a 
lady named McCann, 
And I 
suppose it's thrue enough, 
For he was a 
ladies' man. 
He's gone far away, eta 
He was a 
great philosopher, 
Like the Emperor of Brazil; 
And he never was a 
partner 
In a 
crooked whiskey still; 
He thravelled on his dignity, 
Wherever he might go; 
And in a 
rough and tumble, 
You can bet he was not slow. 
Ho's gone far away, etc. 
Perhaps he went to Harlem 
To recruit his failing health, 
Or took a 
trip to Washington, 
Where people soon get wealth; 
Perhaps lie went to rusticate 
On some secluded shore; 
But what's the use o'talkin', 
Sure Maguffin's here no more. 
He's gone far away, etc,

YOU'RE FAR TOO YOUNG TO TAKE CARE 
OF YOURSELF. 
I 
u.b.:Ni to a 
party a 
few months ago, 
While there I 
got sweet on a 
girl, you must know, 
She played the piano, occasien'ly sung, 
I 
admired her talent, she being so young. 
The party broke up as the clock it struck four, 
I 
ask'd if I 
might see her home to the door, 
She blush'd like the rose and these words then did say, 
"No, thank you, dear sir, I 
can find my own way." 
SPOKEN. — I said very likely, my dear, but remember— 
You're far too young to take care of yourself, 
Far too young to take care of yourself, 
Don't be so silly, you simple young elf, 
You're far too young to take care of yourself. 
The fog was so dense that you hardly could see 
A 
man from a 
horse or a 
horse from a 
tree, 
And as she had something like two miles to go, 
I 
said if you venture you'll rue it, I 
know. 
The more I 
persuaded the more she refused. 
At last I 
said, Miss, you can go if you choose, 
(1 )

YOU'RE FAR TOO YOUNG TO TAKE CARE 
OF YOURSELF.—Concluded. 
But if you'll allow me I'll show you the way, 
And then to the girl these words I 
did say— 
You're far too young to take, etc. 
She started for home and I 
followed behind, 
But losing her way she soon altered her mind, 
And when she saw me she said, Pardon me, pray, 
If you but respect me, sir, show me the way. 
I 
walked by her side and we soon reached the door. 
Her parents they thanked me a 
thousand times o'er, 
Invited me in there a 
short time to stay, 
And once more to her these words I 
did say— 
You're far too young to take, etc. 
I 
said if you need a 
protector for life, 
With your parents' consent I 
will make you my wife, 
My income is over three hundred a 
year, 
And if you have me you have little to fear. 
Her father said no, but her mother said yes, 
She's not going to lose such a 
chance, I 
confess; 
In three months from now you can take her away, 
And then to the girl these words she did say— 
You're far too young to take, etc.

JANE OVERSHOE. 
PARODY ON NANCY LEE. 
Written by JAMES Thins. 
Sung with big success by Nuzs and 
Evirrs. 
Or all the dizzy girls that ever I 
knew, 
There's none can compare with Jane Overshoe. 
Her nose is long, and her mouth is large, 
She is always good to herself; 
She can eat clam pies, that for a 
year was laid on the 
shelf. 
One Saturday night I 
got my pay, 
I 
took her out for a 
walk ; 
To a 
beer-saloon at first we went, 
But the man to death she talked: 
A 
freezer full of ice-cream 
To her was only a 
taste, 
Theft fourteen oyster stews she laid waste. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, did you ever see such a 
girl before, 
She ate till she fell on the floor, 
Then I 
run out of the door; 
I 
left her there to pay the bill; 
Now what could I 
do more ? 
I'm sure my dream of love is o'er. 
To balls and parties we often go, 
Ye-ho, boys! ho ! for Jane Overshoe; 
She is like the rest, she wants the best 
Or else it will not do, 
And your pocket-book she will go clear through. 
When I 
call for wine, she says she's mine, 
And to me she will be true : 
But when she has to pay the bill, 
It makes her feel so blue : 
She can waltz, polka, and quadrille 
For hours at a 
time; 
Oh, this darling she never can be mine. 
Oh, my, did you ever, eto.

IT 
stands in the garret, deserted and lone, 
All dingy and broken with webs overgrown ; 
The hands that once rocked it, how quiet are they, 
The smiles that beamed o'er it have faded away. 
A 
sweet angel mother once leaned o'er its side, 
And sang to her baby, her darling and pride. 
Oh, sad mem'ries gather and tears downward creep, 
That old willow cradle once rocked us to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! 'twos rocking, still rocking at twilight's sweet fall, 
And rocking, still rocking, when night covered all; 
A 
mother's fond prayer begg'd the angels to keep 
Sweet watch o'er the cradle that rocked us to sleep. 
A 
dear baby brother its pillow has pressed, 
While angels' sweet lullabies sang him to rest ; 
Oh, sad were the teardrops when empty it stood, 
And gone was that brother, so gentle and good, 
His wee broken playthings lay near it that day, 
When angels had borne him so softly away; 
Oh, long o'er thy pillow a 
mother would weep, 
Dear old willow cradle that rocked us to sleep. 
Ah! ' twos rocking, etc. 
It stands in the garret deserted and lone, 
All dingy and broken with webs overgrown, 
And years have departed since I 
was a 
child, 
And over my pathway my loved ones have smiled. 
Yet oft in the pauses of world weary strife, 
The sweet early mem'ries will dawn on my life; 
They bind to my heart with affection so deep, 
The old willow cradle that rock'd us to sleep. 
Ah I 'twas rocking. etc. 
RECITATION. 
Written and recited by JOHN F. 
W HITNEY, of the " Novelly Four," 
in their original burIetta, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
I 
DON'T exactly recollect, but 'twas at the full of the moon, 
About three years ago in the middle of next June, 
That a 
gang of us assembled for to start a 
fishing club, 
And we elected all the officers midst a 
terrible hubbub, 
And McGowan was elected Treasurer pro tem. 
We came to the conclusion we'd go bobbing after eels, 
And for fear we'd get the cramps we took along a 
keg of 
We started very early so as we'd not start late, 
And we had a 
gallon demijohn marked B-A-T-E, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got near the place where we were going to bob, 
-We pushed the boat about a 
mile up to our necks in mud. 
Devlin got excited and McCue was going to shoot, 
Because he had the gall to make an eel-trap of his boot, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
McSourly, the comic singer, he wanted to vocalize, 
But we beseeched him to desist, for us he'd paralyze ; 
But when he got about half full he started Pinafore, 
And they threw him over the side of the boat and I 
never 
see him more, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got tired of bobbing it was near the break of 
day ; 
Muldoon cried out breakers ahead and swore we were out 
at sea. 
I 
never got over it for a 
month, for the cook made a 
great 
mistake, 
He gave me an eel for breakfast, and by heavens it was a 
snake. 
Whisper.) On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
DON'T BLAME ME FOR I 
DIDN'T DO IT. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written, composed and sang by CHAS. H. 
DUNCAN. 
Published in sheet music by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 Broadway, N. Y, 
SOME time ago, as you must know, 
I 
met a 
charming girl, 
She looked so very pretty 
That my brain got in a 
whirl. 
She wore a 
small shell bonnet, 
That became her well indeed, 
But when she slipped down upon the ice, 
My heart for her did bleed. 
CHORUS. 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
I 
am not to blame. 
(
Repeat.) 
She begged that I'd excuse her, 
Which of course I 
quickly done, 
She handed me a 
scented card, 
The charmer I 
had won ; 
She stated that her father was 
A 
very peculiar man, 
Was training for a 
prize fight, 
And his name was Reckless Dan. 
Don't blame me, etc. 
I 
stuck to her just like a 
leech, 
We're married most a 
year, 
On good terms with her father, 
And have nothing now to fear. 
We've got a 
baby, it's a 
girl, 
She is her mother's joy, 
But I'm not fond of girls at all— 
I'd rather have a 
boy. 
Don't blame me, etc-

NAPOLEON'S ORACULUNI 
Oft, 
BOOK OF FATE. 
The only Complete American, from the Fiftieth 
London Edition. 
This is the oldest, and for that very reason the best of Fortune Tellers. 
It was compiled in the remote ages, when learned men consulted the stars, 
and watched and interpreted the decrees of fate, and inquired into and 
often inastered the mysteries of what we vaguely term Chance. 
Certain it 
is, that Bonaparte obtained a 
copy of this book, written upon papyrus. He 
curiously consults it. 
From that time a 
gloom overspread his massive brow. 
Did it dimly reveal to him Moscow, Waterloo, St. Helena I We only know 
it was found in his carriage after his last great fight. 
Tens of thousands 
consult this Oraculum with daily increasing faith, in its truthful an,swerings.
