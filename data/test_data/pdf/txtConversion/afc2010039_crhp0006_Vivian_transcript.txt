REVEREND VIVIAN:  But there were 
three of them.  But by the way, did

[break in audio]  
 
INTERVIEWER:  They're in Nashville?  
01:00:09 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Mm-hmm.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  No.  Why?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And there's about 
15 of them--there used to be about 15 
of them, 12 to 15.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Uh-huh.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Is because they 
were looking for the center of 
population in the United States.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Uh-huh.  
01:00:21 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Right, and it was a 
part of the great Sunday school 
movement in the country, right?

African American History and Culture.  
Welcome, Dr. Vivian.  Please  
01:01:17 
introduce yourself and we'll get 
started telling stories about your 
career in the civil rights movement.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  It's good to see 
you, Brother Branch, and I'm so glad 
that you're in our house and I 
remember the last time you were here, 
and so it's very good to have you and 
everyone who is with you.  And it's 
so good to know that this is going  
01:01:39 
into the African American Museum of 
Negro History.  Is that right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  That's where it will 
be, on the mall in Washington.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's exactly 
right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So let's start at the 
beginning, just a little bit of 
background.  You were born in 
Missouri, so you have a heartland  
01:01:57 
background--this is not all in the 
south, and moved to Illinois early.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's exactly

right.  In fact, we moved to Illinois 
so I could go to school in a non- 
01:02:08 
segregated school.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And this is the 
influence of your mother and 
grandmother, if I'm not--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  My mother and 
grandmother.  Ultimately, though, it 
was pushed by the Depression.  The 
Depression, we lost everything we 
had, three farms and all that sort of 
thing.  This is why you see Howard  
01:02:25 
County, Missouri on where I was born, 
right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But then everything 
was lost and as a result of the 
Depression, and then we moved into 
the house in town which was in 
Boonville, and that's why you get 
that, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yes.  
01:02:46 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Then somebody 
burned, a fellow burned because of 
the religion of my grandmother,

INTERVIEWER:  What was the religion  
01:03:02 
of your grandmother?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  See, I knew that 
would work.  See, here's the thing is 
my grandmother was a very religious 
person and Church of God In Christ, 
right, and she refused to let a man 
down the street in a common law 
marriage put this very nice woman out 
into the streets and it was kind of a 
snowy day at that, right, and she was  
01:03:29 
coming up the street and when my 
grandmother found out she told her to 
come on into the house, right?  And 
so she was making certain that she 
would be all right.  Her common law 
husband was angered by it all, and 
came in the middle of like, 3 o'clock 
in the morning and put--went in the 
basement or in the lower level, it 
really was, because that's where you  
01:03:59 
kept the coal in those days and you 
kept the wood and really fine wood 
that you could start fires with.  He

started a fire under the house and it 
happened to be under my bedroom and  
01:04:14 
my grandmother was out screaming my 
name in the middle of that morning 
because of the fire.  I awakened, ran 
to the door of my bedroom or of the 
bedroom, looked out and looked 
straight through that house, through 
the front door was open and I ran 
back and jumped in bed, just kind of 
in a happy mood, right?  Kind of 
something was all right about it, but  
01:04:44 
it was strange, it was different, and 
I liked the idea.  Then there was 
some sound in her voice that was 
panicky, and I jumped out of bed and 
phew, shot right through the house.  
They say that about 20 minutes after 
that, my room fell into the fire 
below, saving me, right?  Well, after 
that, the family decided that they 
had nothing left, plus the fact--it's  
01:05:22 
strange what happens.  Depressions 
create more divorces than you could 
think.  Men could not stand what

happened to them, everything taken 
away, everything they'd worked for  
01:05:34 
for their lives.  They would wake in 
the morning and they had nothing.  
They didn't know what to do, right?  
And it created crises all over--that 
whole period is filled with divorces, 
and both my mother and grandmother 
ended in divorce.  Well, the women 
said that this was the time to move 
out of a segregated society and they 
moved into Macomb, Illinois, but they  
01:06:02 
moved there because there's a 
university there, and they knew that 
no matter what happened I could go 
through college and that was a dream, 
particularly of my grandmother.  But 
the family, her brother had gotten to 
go to college at Lincoln University 
in Missouri.  She had not, and she 
was really fulfilling her desire 
through me by making certain that if  
01:06:33 
we moved to a college town, that 
could happen, all right, and so those 
two women made certain of it.  That

move they made was I was just 
entering the first grade--I was 6

years old.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So that's in 1930.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  1930, right, and 
that made the difference in the rest 
of my life.  If they had not decided 
to do that and do it, I don't know 
really what would have happened to 
me.

marked by conflict not only of racism

women.

right.

seems that you were a pioneer in the 
sense that in a way you tried to, you  
01:07:34 
tried out the civil rights techniques 
early to see how they would play in 
Peoria--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  As the phrase goes.  
You had a sit-in in Peoria, Illinois 
in 1947 when you were a very young 
man, long before, 13 years before the 
Greensboro sit-ins.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
01:07:53 
INTERVIEWER:  How did that come 
about?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, well, see, 
here's what happened is that I was--
we had--well, let me tell you the 
whole story.  I had gone back to 
Peoria or to Peoria, actually, in 
order to work, in order to go back to 
school, to go back to Western.  I had 
dropped out, went to work and then  
01:08:25 
was in Peoria.  Well, Ben Alexander 
who was a chemist there, he and I 
became friends so I was living at a

huge house he had and there were 
three of us there, a medical doctor,  
01:08:45 
and myself and Ben, right?  And Ben 
was involved with a church group that 
was basically a white church--you'd 
still say that whether it was north 
at that time or not, right?  And he 
wanted me to join him in direct 
action with--out of CORE, as that--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The Congress of Racial 
Equality.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Equality, see--  
01:09:17 
INTERVIEWER:  Which had started in 
World War II, in '41--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, in '41 and 
this is important because it was 
really the commission, on, I think, 
at first, as a part of the church.  
Then Jim Farmer started there, and in 
Chicago.  Well, we began to get 
material from him a couple of years 
later, right, and the techniques that  
01:09:51 
had been formed by CORE is what we 
used to open up the restaurants and 
lunch counters in Peoria, Illinois

after that.  In fact, Jim and I were 
in jail together in Jackson,  
01:10:05 
Mississippi and we talked about that 
same thing.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Oh, well, we'll have to 
get to that.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, okay.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So after this early 
experience in Peoria, it's not too 
many years later than that in 1954 or 
thereabouts that you met and married 
your wife, Octavia.  Can you tell the  
01:10:28 
story of how that came about?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, yes, in fact, I 
love to tell this story.  In fact, 
there were very few black 
professionals in that period, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yes.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And so whenever one 
would come to town, we would--others 
would have a party for that person, 
right?  And my wife came to Peoria to  
01:11:00 
be a women's director and girl's 
director at Carver Community Center.

largest community center for African 
Americans between Chicago and St.  
01:11:13 
Louis, and she came to be in charge 
there.  We had a party for her and I 
met her at that party and found out 
that within a couple of weeks she was 
going to have a birthday, so I called 
her after the party, the next couple 
of days and let her know that we were 
too nice of people to allow someone 
new to sit around in their room and 
that I would love to take her out so  
01:11:50 
that she could enjoy herself on her 
birthday.  Well, and she finally 
agreed, and so we did, and from that 
time on, if you saw one, you'd see 
the other.  So one year from that 
day, we were married, so that day--
and I know better not to give it--
February the 22nd became for us her 
birthday, anniversary of our first 
date and our wedding anniversary all  
01:12:27 
in one day.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  On George Washington's 
birthday, too.

thing, if you could pause just a 
little bit after he finishes

INTERVIEWER:  Oh, okay.  Just jumping 
ahead a little bit, because your 
wife, Octavia later became the 
biographer of Coretta Scott King and 
friend of hers in the movement--  
01:12:55 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's true.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Could you tell us just 
a little bit about her background as 
you learned it after you met her?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  In fact, that is 
one of the good things.  The reason 
that she had a chance to come to try 
out for the job was because the 
person that came to head the center, 
his name was Harper, had been the  
01:13:21 
director of her community center 
during the summers when he was a 
student at one of the Michigan

universities.  She was from Pontiac, 
Michigan, and a group of wonderful  
01:13:36 
young people gathered around during 
that period there in Pontiac, and 
they had their own newspaper.  They 
knocked on doors, the local African 
American doctor led them and they 
registered people to vote, they got 
people out to vote, they were 
involved in all kinds of activities 
in the community or anything that 
came up that the doctor was concerned  
01:14:08 
about, they were all involved in it, 
right?  And that group of young 
people continued as part of the city.  
In fact, my wife said one day she was 
going to go back and become mayor.  
Well, one of her group did become 
mayor of Pontiac--it was that kind of 
group, and the intensity of it was 
very important.  Her father's 
minister was a Morehouse man.  And so

that history follows us, but she was

to go out to Ted's Trailer and got 
them in the car, took them out to  
01:15:05 
Ted's Trailer [phonetic] which was a 
drive-in.  They were used to going to 
Ted's Trailer, but never inside, 
right?  So they didn't know it was 
segregated, and they would serve you 
in the car but they wouldn't serve 
you in the place.  Well, when he took 
these young people out, a group of 
them, the idea was to make certain 
they ate inside.  They tried to hand  
01:15:34 
them a bag with their stuff in it.  
He went back to one of the tables, 
they gathered around and they split

worked, so people began to come and

perfect for me.  I was trying to 
start a newspaper there because  
01:16:16 
journalism was my minor.  I had just 
found that they didn't teach me 
enough about advertising, so I didn't 
last long.  Journalism demands much 
if not more advertising and knowledge 
of than writing itself, being an 
English major I thought all you had 
to do was write.  I came to find out 
it was a bit larger than that, 
especially if you own the newspaper,  
01:16:46 
so I didn't own it long.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Well, before we jump to 
the south in your career, I'd like to 
ask you one question--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Sure.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Because a lot of people 
today, all these years later, young 
people tend to think that all the 
African Americans involved in the 
civil rights movement grew up like  
01:17:07 
Dr. King in the south.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.

north, so I'd like to ask you two 
questions: Did you have people from 
the south in both of your families, 
in other words where did they come 
from?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, I see.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And then what drove you 
back down to the south, to Nashville?  
01:17:36 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, that becomes 
an important question that we who 
were young did not come to until much 
later, but my wife's folks were 
really from Arkansas.  They had come 
north to work.  Her father had, 
right?  And it was a large family and 
a couple of the others of them also 
came.  He was the older son, and they 
came so it ended up, there were three  
01:18:11 
or four of them in Michigan, most of 
them in Detroit, the father went to 
Pontiac, and that's where my wife was

born as a result.  But the history of 
that is interesting, because where  
01:18:31 
they were in Arkansas was rice 
country, and my wife as a result 
happens to know and is part of the 
tracing that rice was a science that 
was unknown or was not well-known 
here in the United States.  So when 
they told--her great great great 
grandfather was a person who knew 
rice culture.  He was told that if he 
would--he could come to the United  
01:19:11 
States and that they would take care 
of him and his family.  No sooner 
they got on board ship, they made 
them slaves.  So then when things 
were much better, they made that move 
on up north.  That's how her family 
got there.  My family got there as I 
was telling you earlier, right?  
Because they had lived in Missouri 
and grew--the whole family, three  
01:19:50 
generations, both my father and my 
mother, my grandfather was a teacher, 
right?  He became a principal of

schools.  He got fired, though, 
because he was teaching black kids  
01:20:05 
algebra and the white school board 
didn't know algebra.  So they fired 
him for teaching black kids algebra, 
but that's how we really came 
involved, first to the country and 
then to the north from the south.  
But to further the meaning of your 
question is that everybody north 
thought they were better than those 
who were still south, right?  And  
01:20:43 
thought that things were so much 
better off north than south, right?  
Which gave the beginning of an 
expression we used--"up south" 
because even then, as I was coming 
through school, that was an 
understanding.  At first, we didn't 
want to admit that things were that 
bad where we were, but later on had 
to face the fact that it was bad  
01:21:17 
enough to be no more than up south.  
For instance, why we opened the lunch 
counters in Peoria, Illinois was

around the understanding that we 
could go into a restaurant, one  
01:21:30 
restaurant in downtown--it's the only 
one we could go in and sit and eat--
that didn't have a sign that said 
that you had to eat in a particular 
place, but we all knew that if we 
went any other but that part of the 
restaurant, we would be asked to 
move, so we naturally went there.  
But always, there was that thing--you 
want to change that dislike for it,  
01:22:00 
and so when this opportunity came 
that Jim Farmer had produced in 
Chicago, then we did the same thing.  
But there were those years which you 
mentioned between us and coming 
south, coming back south, but had we 
who came south not helped start a 
great movement, there probably never 
would be the population moves that 
happened.

INTERVIEWER:  Does your family go

anything before that?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  No, in fact, I

generations.  In fact, I have 
paintings and photographs of three 
generations of my family--well, four 
generations of them really, but my  
01:23:10 
great great grandfather was in 
slavery, right?  And he left slavery 
to join the northern armies, and when 
he came back after winning it, they 
came--he came back to Boonville, 
Missouri, and when he came back to 
Boonville, he refused to take the 
name of his former--I hate the word 
"owner."  I must admit in the middle 
of the civil rights movement I began  
01:23:52 
to call them "murderers," not 
"masters."  And as a result of that, 
I began to think a whole different

Woods, and so that was the family

one side, Woods on the other.

its generations and so there was the 
Tyndalls, the Vivians and the Woods.  
In fact, the most interesting thing, 
I've looked all over the country for 
Vivians and it wasn't until about  
01:25:33 
four years ago--I've even gone to 
Vivian, Louisiana, right?  Found that 
there had been a great number of 
Vivians there in Monroe, Louisiana, 
and that we lost everything we had 
there because of the Louisiana 
Purchase.  As soon as the United 
States took over the Louisiana 
Purchase, they took the land and so 
forth and went to graveyards--went to  
01:26:02 
a graveyard in Vivian, Louisiana 
where the family tombstones.  I 
couldn't find Vivians.  I've went all

over the United States looking for 
Vivians that connected.  In Iowa,  
01:26:19 
near the Missouri border, I found a 
Vivian family, but we couldn't make 
any identity in terms of the move.  
Then a man about four years ago 
called me and said I've been wanting 
to do this and I'm traveling through 
and I'd like to meet you, and so we 
got together and he had two of his 
daughters with him and we all got 
together and just sat around and  
01:26:53 
talked.  Well, he shows up every now 
and then.  He's a minister, by the 
way, but he's done about four things-
-he's also a minister, and he comes 
every now and then.  He was here 
about a month ago, but it's the only 
Vivian that I had met then so I went 
to a funeral that he was telling me 
about, and I met several other people 
who were related to Vivians.

after slavery it is by choosing a 
name that we first placed ourselves  
01:27:35 
into the world--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yes.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Because your names in 
the family are to some degree choice 
and in some way it makes it harder to 
trace but more interesting to trace.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, precisely 
right.  This is one reason my great 
great grandfather I really appreciate 
because he refused to take a slave

name.  Now, my grandfather--my great 
grandfather Woods, he might as well

company, when I got my call to 
ministry, and I thought I'd go to  
01:29:09 
Colgate Rochester.  And my final year 
of college, Western, is I had been 
picked to go to Colgate Rochester.  
They picked what they call the hot 
100 every year, you know, across the 
country they pick them and invited 
you in and paid all the bills and 
asked you to come and they set up a 
two-day thing hoping then that you 
would come back, right?  And I had  
01:29:39 
made my choice to go to Colgate 
Rochester but when I got the call to 
the ministry I found out that my

for me to go, but to go to a school

he was on the board of which was in 
Nashville.  And as a result, that's 
where I ended--in Nashville.  And I 
often think that had I made up my 
mind I was going to Colgate Rochester 
in spite of--see, I was going to wait 
until I got the call to ministry.  
People had always told me in my 
hometown I was going to be a 
minister.  I'd even tried to bring  
01:30:22 
the three black churches in my town 
together to create one good solid 
church, right?  And so they always 
knew me as that kind of person but 
then I wouldn't go because I had not 
been called to ministry.  The calling 
came in Peoria at Helen Gallagher's 
place, and then when that call came--
and that's the story that my wife was 
involved in a way that you should  
01:30:58 
hear, because a good deal of all the 
movement was deeply religious and

I got the call to ministry, as I  
01:31:13 
said, I wanted to go to Colgate 
Rochester but I was on my way to 
American Baptist Theological Seminary 
in Nashville because of how 
everything happened.  So I go there 
and I've often thought if I had gone 
to Colgate Rochester, I would have 
missed my life because the 
connections and the attitudes and the 
actions of going to American Baptist  
01:31:49 
made it possible for me to be 
involved in the movement.  And if you 
notice that I ended with Martin King, 
but that even before that, in 
Nashville, Kelly Miller Smith was the 
pastor of First Baptist Church and 
the natural leader of the movement, 
right--was a minister, right?  When 
you look at the people, Bernard 
Lafayette and Jim Bevel and any  
01:32:25 
number of others of us, John Lewis, 
we were all at the seminary.  And

freedom there, the leadership was 
from religious side of life.  In  
01:32:44 
fact, basically all over the country 
that was true because you see, Martin 
had called ministers together to form 
SCLC, of which Kelly Miller Smith was 
one of those that was called to that 
meeting.  When I first came to 
Nashville, he had me to preach for 
him, and that was First Baptist and 
that was the intellectual church of 
the community, and so he and I were  
01:33:17 
very good friends so when he came 
back, he called a group of ministers 
together.  They started only with 
three of us that really heeded the 
call to form SCLC in Nashville and it 
grew to six, but half of those were 
not pastors in the town.  Half of 
those were in one of the other 
publishing houses in the town, all 
right.  But then once they saw what  
01:33:47 
the movement was all about, once the 
movement really got under way, boy, 
all the ministers joined us.

It was a mail order company and I was 
walking across the floor going  
01:34:55 
towards the front.  At the time when 
it seemed like that the roof opened, 
right, and I heard “I want to work 
for you eight or ten hours a day,” 
but it was a booming voice that came, 
right?  And all of it, I don't 
totally understand yet because how 
could those be the words, right?  But 
they were.  Then things just 
disappeared, but it seemed like it  
01:35:35 
came right through the ceiling, right 
through the roof really of that part 
of the building and I turned around 
me because I wondered how everybody 
else was taking this because it was a 
booming sound.  There was no way you 
could not hear it as far as I was 
concerned.  It filled me, right?  And 
I turned around and everyone was just 
about their regular business.  I can  
01:36:06 
see a woman now that I don't remember 
her name by any means, but I can see 
a woman now--she was just packaging.

She was one of the regular people.  
They had about 50 or 60 people that  
01:36:19 
did nothing but package all the time, 
and she was one of them that was 
always in my memory, and I turned and 
she was just about packaging things.  
Whatever the gift was, right, she was 
packaging it.  And then I walked on 
up to the front.  Well, now, as I 
said, my minister had money for me--
he had come to the place and Helen 
Gallagher had given him a gift for me  
01:36:57 
to go to college.  Now, an 
interesting thing, though, is I got a 
letter last year, right?  I got a 
letter last year signed by Helen 
Gallagher Foster but the letter was 
sent to me by a woman who was her 
neighbor, and she told me in the 
letter that she had gone over to 
Helen’s house and found that she had 
had a stroke and died there in her  
01:37:30 
kitchen.  But she had written me this 
letter and she had told the woman 
about me so she knew who I was,

right, and so she found out where I 
was and sent me the letter.  One of  
01:37:48 
the last things she did, and we had 
not talked to each other in all of 
those years.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  What did the letter 
say?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Well, the letter 
was so thankful that I had done well 
and all of that sort of thing and 
that she'd kept up with me throughout 
the years and every time I came to  
01:38:07 
Peoria and all that sort of thing, 
right, but I hadn't even gone back to 
the place, even the few trips I made 
back to Peoria I had not.  And it was 
one of those kind of mysterious kinds 
of things, you know?  Here a person 
dies the same morning she's writing 
me a letter, and it would have been 
the only letter that she would have 
written during all those years and  
01:38:36 
would have been the only time we 
would have communicated but we both 
remembered each other quite well.  In

really Helen Gallagher and Foster is 
a young man that came on much later,

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mail ordered what kind

of products, remind me--our museum is 
collecting artifacts from places like 
this and I'm just curious a little 
bit about what it involves--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Okay, one of her 
very important sales was of things 
with roosters with them, all right?  
Glassware, all kinds of things to put 
flowers in, things for the kitchen, 
all kinds of things, right, would

have that sign on it.  Helen

all of the home and garden and House

magazines, house magazines of that  
01:40:02 
period, both lower ordinary and the 
high class and you could tell a great 
difference, all right, between House 
Beautiful and some of the others, 
right?  But that's how she 
advertised.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So was she selling to 
an integrated white market and black 
market?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  No, I'm glad you  
01:40:23 
said that, because that's why I was 
there.  What I wanted to do was to 
start an African American mail order 
house--well, under her--she had about 
three different companies through the 
advertising but they were all out of 
the same place and they were all 
under her, right?  And she had a 
great business mind and her husband 
wasn't bad at all either, right?  He  
01:40:53 
was good at the backroom.  She did 
the stuff out front, and picked items 
and etcetera.  Now, so that she, when

things happened, what I wanted to do 
was to start a mail order house  
01:41:17 
because we had just come out of the 
war.  African Americans had more 
money than they had ever had before, 
right?  You don't send letters and 
advertising to people who don't have 
money, right?  We had come to a point 
which I thought that we could stand 
and develop an African American mail 
order house, right?  If you would 
have followed Johnson Publications,  
01:41:49 
one of the only ones they didn't 
duplicate was House Beautiful, 
because we were just coming to the 
point.  I wanted to get in on that 
market before Johnson did, right?  
And then right at that time, I got 
the call to the ministry so I dropped 
all of that, but the main story that 
I think that you need to know about 
the call to the ministry is that a  
01:42:19 
couple, two or three days afterwards, 
I knew I had to tell my wife because 
I knew I was going to go a seminary

somewhere, right?  As I said, I had 
Colgate Rochester in my mind so I  
01:42:37 
decided to tell her.  I came home 
from work and I said to her, I said, 
baby, I've got something I want to 
tell you and she said, I got 
something to tell you, too.  So we 
always waited until we got in bed and 
we'd share with each other, right?  
And so after we had eaten and one 
thing and the other, we'd go up to 
bed and we're lying there and she  
01:43:06 
says, you tell me your story--I said 
I was going--you tell me your story 
first.  And I said, no, baby, you 
tell me, because I knew she was just 
bursting to get it out.  Well, we 
were having our first child, that's 
what she wanted to tell me, right?  
So after we celebrated that fact, she 
said, well, now, tell me your story.  
And I said, no, I'm not going to tell  
01:43:41 
you right now.  And so she finally 
coaxed it out of me, right, and so...

having a baby as well.  I was going 
to stay there through that, and so I  
01:45:04 
was going to let it go at that, and 
we laid there in the darkness and 
suddenly she says, "Whose faith is in

Well, how do you answer?

they say--fine, you go to the

right.  And I had to go, because you

I get the call and we were--I mean, 
we didn't have a phone in every room 
as most seminaries do now, right,  
01:46:14 
because they're graduate schools and 
they just have one and so on, but 
there was one phone on each floor.

Somebody called down to the end of 
the hall where I was and said,  
01:46:25 
"Vivian, you've got a call" so I go 
down and it's my wife, right, and I'm 
standing there looking at the window 
and it's just so wonderful to think 
she's coming and she says I'm coming, 
so I said, well, how long are you 
going to stay?  And she said, oh, I'm 
coming to stay.  Well, I was suddenly 
silenced.  I looked out the window, 
and I couldn't believe it.  I said,  
01:46:58 
how was this going to happen?  Here I 
was in one dorm room, right, and 
didn't have a job, and didn't have 
any way to get an apartment.  I'll 
tell you what happened is that before 
she got there, the publishing house 
had called me and I was using the job 
would have had me use everything that 
I had ever done before, the various 
tasks that I had done before I was  
01:47:35 
going to do.  I had been in boys work 
with the YMCA--this job was around 
boys' work.  I had been an editor of

that.  I had been a speaker all my 
life.  I was going to be able to do 
that all over the country, so that 
this job would take in each and every 
important thing I had done in my

moment was that there was only one

but all of that is to anchor me in 
Peoria--I mean, in Nashville.  It 
should have been--the movement 
starts, I meet Martin King there in 
the first place doing an article.  
The wife and I were going to produce 
a 24-page piece on Martin.  Well, 
that's how it ended--we ended up 
doing it.  I was trying to do it for 
the publishing house.  The publishing  
01:49:47 
house actually was really afraid to 
publish anything on Martin.  This is 
important to be said because then it 
makes you realize the climate, 
because they were afraid that the 
publishing house would be blown up.  
I led--I and Diane Nash led a 
movement, an action in Nashville, 
4000--the paper said 2000 people.

action as I said--Kelly Miller Smith 
had put things together with a few  
01:51:10 
ministers, right?  It was beginning 
to build but not really heavily.  We 
were having workshops and so forth 
but for ministers in the city--not 
many came, all right?  They did not 
quite understand nonviolence 
whatsoever, right?  They did not see 
how it was going to work so that they 
sort of pulled away, except for a 
half a dozen, and I was one of those,  
01:51:41 
but as I said, Kelly Miller Smith was 
the leader.  Well, Jim Lawson comes 
to town to go to Vanderbilt, but he's 
also working for Fellowship of 
Reconciliation.  He's coming in to do 
training across that region of the 
south, and he's going to be anchored 
at Vanderbilt in Nashville, so as he 
comes, he comes to train, and 
training is what no one had done for

the movement at that time.  Martin 
had just gotten started good.  The

INTERVIEWER:  You're talking about 
it, you came there--?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, and then the 
bus boycott.  Well, they won it.  Jim 
Lawson is in Nashville and begins to 
train ministers, begins to train 
students, and that training of 
students went on for several months.   
01:53:31 
It was through that that I met Jim, 
because I had already been in 
movement in Peoria, so I knew Jim and

then it ended up that Jim got an 
apartment right across the street  
01:53:46 
from our apartment, and his wife was 
working at one of the colleges near 
where my son was going to school, to 
a special school across the street 
from the Vanderbilt campus.  And so 
she would take him to school.  Well, 
we met each other through that means 
and really--but I had done it nine, 
ten years before, but Jim really knew 
far more about nonviolence than I  
01:54:38 
did, and so I welcomed him because 
this was what we needed, as much 
knowledge as we could get of the 
method.  I had done it, but he had 
the background to be able to teach it 
in quite a different way.  I had 
gotten techniques and so forth and it 
was naturally for me a natural way of 
life, right?  But that's what fit the 
ministry.  But then to teach the  
01:55:08 
students and so they can get it is 
another thing.  Jim was excellent at 
it.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's what I was 
going to say, and that kind of coming 
back from India just was the kind of 
thing that the kids were, you know, 
bug-eyed about, and they really 
listened, they really learned because 
Jim was a good teacher, still is.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Now, those workshops 
with the students, of course, were 
very influential.  
01:55:35 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  They were quite 
dramatic.  I've talked to many of the 
students who were in them.  Many of 
them didn't know how nonviolence was 
going to work either and were quite 
skeptical--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.

Diane Nash saying that she was a

nonviolence work?  And they were  
01:56:00 
doing all these experiments and 
slapping each other around and 
everything--she was horrified by it.  
Did you actually participate in any 
of those and watch that or having 
already done it, did you not need to-
-?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, I watched 
some of it and participated in some 
of it.  I never will forget one of  
01:56:18 
the ministers there, they burned--put 
out a cigarette on him and it burned 
a hole, some of the fire fell and 
burned a hole in his trousers, and he 
made it very clear that we were going 
to buy him a new suit. 
 
[laughter]  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Quite a guy--he 
went to Morehouse, too, by the way, 
and was a Methodist, and his church

was near Fisk campus which we used to 
meet in all the time.

sit-ins, that period of kind of

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yes.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  With you starting a 
family and working a job and going to 
seminary, and meeting Dr. King and 
all of those things.  Talk a little 
bit about your relationship with 
Lawson in the early days.  He always 
used to tell me that it was somewhat  
01:57:19 
difficult because the people around 
Dr. King were all Baptists and he was 
a Methodist, and that Dr. King would 
always tease him about getting his 
bishop to tell him what to do and 
that sort of thing.  In fact, Dr. 
King had helped recruit him to come 
south--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, so that's 
what it seems as though.  
01:57:37 
INTERVIEWER:  How did the two of you 
get along together?

REVEREND VIVIAN:  They had nothing to 
do with real life.  In fact, 
actually, though, the president of 
the board of SCLC at that time was a 
Methodist, Joe Lowry.  Everybody else 
was in fact Baptist and they had 
known each other in Alabama, all of 
them, Joe as well as the rest.  In 
fact, most of the guys, even the  
01:58:15 
pastor from Tallahassee had gone to 
school in Montgomery, so many of 
them, Fred Shuttlesworth, the great 
guys came out of Alabama.  And 
Martin, in fact, we often--well, 
didn't joke, it's just a fact of 
life--Martin came from Atlanta but he 
had to come to Alabama to become 
famous and he had to come to Alabama 
to find a wife, right?  Coretta was  
01:58:48 
from Alabama.  Abernathy, who was his 
sidekick--Alabama.  And his wife, 
right?  And Andy's wife was from the

radius, and you had them all, which  
01:59:11 
is the most interesting kind of 
thing.  All of them were talented 
people--in fact, one of the stories I 
like best that Abernathy could have 
been the president of SCLC had he 
wanted to be, right?  He was the most 
important single minister in 
Montgomery.  He was the one that had 
the largest church.  He was the one 
that had gone to the university which  
01:59:41 
is the part of Montgomery--

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Alabama State.  He 
was the one whose parents had been in 
Alabama for at least two or three 
generations, right?  And so he had 
everything going for him, but when he 
met Martin and saw what Martin had, 
he became the sort of John the 
Baptist to Martin's Jesus, you see,  
02:00:12 
because he did not care to be the 
leader with a man like Martin.  They 
had become friends in the time and he

Martin to go to Colgate Rochester but

INTERVIEWER:  But what I'd like to do  
02:00:48 
just before that is that because 
these workshops that you're involved 
in with Jim Lawson in Nashville, you 
don't know that the movement is about 
to take off--you're doing these 
workshops in nonviolence.  You met in 
these workshops a number of people 
who later become consequential and 
some who didn't, but can you share 
your memories of meeting the people  
02:01:11 
in those workshops--the students?

that you will know except for Diane 
and there was another young woman 
with Diane.  I can't think of her 
name but she was also from Chicago, 
and by the way, Diane was Catholic--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And the only 
Catholic one in the group.  We have 
funny stories about that, but I

talked about John Lewis, talked about 
Jim Bevel, talked about Bernard 
Lafayette, we mentioned--there are 
two other fellows I'd like to think 
about but can't come up with.  There 
were three or four from the seminary 
but they were not fully engaged.  
They would come to actions but they 
were not fully engaged.

02:02:17 
white kids in those groups, too.

liked to talk about it, because I 
don't know enough, but the idea that  
 
there were Indians as late as the 
world conference we had in South 
Africa that were talking about 
Gandhi's not really liking the 
untouchables.  These were the  
01:01:27 
untouchables, talking, right?  They 
got a new name now, right?  But they

mean, a gang of them were there at 
the conference and they were very 
active about it, but the way they 
were talking about it gave a 
different picture of Gandhi's  
 
attitude toward the untouchables than 
our attitude toward the untouchables.

Lawson was kicked out of Vanderbilt 
but he was kicked out by a president 
that had written the book that we 
used on the life of Jesus, that we 
used in seminary on the life of  
 
Jesus.  Here is the president of the 
seminary, had been, and became 
president of Vanderbilt, and he was 
kicking Jim out of school and they 
ended up putting him in prison and  
01:03:06 
his book on Jesus was refuting what 
he was doing in fact, all right?  And 
that was our text.  I'm trying to 
think of his name, but that was our 
text and we couldn't see how he could  
 
have written that book and be 
anything because at the time we used 
it.  We saw it as refuting the south 
without his saying it directly.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  No, it was his book 
was being taught at American Baptist  
01:03:45 
Theological Seminary on the life of 
Jesus, and here he was kicking a man 
out who was talking for Jesus as we 
saw him, and yet he was talking from 
Jesus so the south could accept it, 
right?  Because that's really what 
had happened in his mind, but that 
was always interesting to me.  See, 
there are so many religious stories 
like that that it makes it difficult  
01:04:23 
to see how the south could have gone 
on thinking as though they can be 
Christians and racists at the same 
time.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Well, we should  
 
continue to pick up the religious 
themes as we go forward here.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Okay.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We're starting at the 
beginning of the sit-in movement.   
01:04:45 
The timing for me was always very 
striking, that the Greensboro sit-ins 
started on February 1st because

January 31st, just the night before 
was Dr. King's farewell from Dexter  
01:05:00 
moving to Atlanta.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So he was literally 
finishing his ministry and the bus 
boycott in Alabama, moved to Atlanta  
 
and said farewell the night before 
and as he's driving to take up his 
new residence in Atlanta, these sit-
ins break out in Greensboro and 
looking at it from another angle, you  
01:05:20 
people in Nashville had been 
preparing to do things like this--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  For a year.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  But hadn't quite got 
going so that a lot of the students  
 
told me that the students in 
Greensboro stole the march on them 
because you were preparing--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And they did.  In 
fact, I'm glad you said that about  
01:05:38 
the day before, right?  I really 
didn't put that together.  I'd never 
thought of that.  It's good.  I mean,

I never will forget it, though, but 
you see, we had been preparing.  They  
01:05:53 
moved without preparing, right?  They 
just went and sat down, but see, we 
knew--that had they done that, 
especially in Greensboro, anything 
could have happened.  Remember later 
it was in Greensboro in broad open 
daylight they killed what they called 
communists, remember?  And I remember 
being there the day afterwards and so 
and talking with the police chief,  
01:06:28 
and he did not mind the killing at 
all.  He let us know that he'd been 
killing communists during the war and 
so--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Now, this is a story 
from the 1970s, jumping way forward.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right, 
pardon me.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  That's all right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  We've got to get  
01:06:50 
back to the story because we're--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  No, that's all right.  
It's pertinent.  I just wanted people

to know that it was from a different 
time.  
01:06:56 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, I see what you 
mean.  But did not mind killing at 
all--well, see, that same attitude 
was an attitude toward us as far as I 
was concerned, that any uppity 
nigger, right, was asking to be 
killed.  In fact, truthfully I don't 
see why more of us were not killed, 
not less.  In fact, what we found was 
that less people got killed, less  
01:07:33 
black people got killed during the 
heat of the civil rights movement 
than did before.  The Klan didn't 
seem to kill nearly as many of us--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Don't you think that 
some of that is the religious 
training and the nonviolent training 
that made it harder?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, in fact, 
let's look at this--you see, once  
01:07:57 
it's brought out in the open, this is

a religious confrontation, that 
changes everything to me.  When we  
01:08:17 
begin to ask questions, which I did 
in workshops later on--can you be a 
Christian and a racist at the same 
time?  90% of everybody in the 
workshop was always white because 
that's the way I wanted it, that was 
who I was trying to get to, but I had 
to have blacks in the workshop or 
what I would hear was, well, you said 
that but our black people don't think  
01:08:42 
that way, so I just turned and asked 
black people and said, am I right or 
am I wrong?  You get my point?  Tell 
him.  And they would, right?  And it 
was always a surprise to these white 
folks--I work with him.  He didn't 
think that way.  And that would 
always make everybody black in the 
room kind of look down and smile.  
They would not act like they were  
01:09:15 
laughing at him, right--because they 
did not quite understand who we were, 
what we were, what we thought and

what we did, right?  Now, that's why 
I think had we faced them boldly  
01:09:32 
every day after day with their 
Christian message--not the Old 
Testament message, the Christian 
message, am I right?  That would have 
changed things a lot sooner, a lot 
sooner.  I believe so, right?  Now, 
my wife used to say, the other thing 
that we used to do, we should have 
done, was carry the flag--in other 
words, it was our flag we were  
01:10:56 
defending.  Their flag was the 
confederate flag, right?  So to 
speak--I mean, it wouldn't be stated 
but that's what we would be saying, 
is that this flag, you don't really 
represent a racist.  You don't 
represent the American flag.  But 
we'd always fought it on those 
grounds and it didn't get anywhere, 
but if you're in the deep south, the  
01:10:30 
one thing that's believed in is the 
Bible.  Theologians don't get nearly 
as far as Bible school people in the

south because Bible school people can 
quote texts.  Theologians don't quote  
01:10:45 
texts.  They quote a series of ideas, 
right?  And so the Bible people in 
the south say, well, that's what you 
think, but that's not what my pastor 
said.  Well, but they never 
questioned their pastor because they 
didn't know how in the first place, 
right?  But all you had to do was 
state scripture and they'd go look it 
up.  That's what I found in my  
01:11:11 
workshops--I'd state scripture and 
people would come back the next day 
when I was doing reconciliation and 
say, well, we looked it up last 
night.  My husband and I looked that 
up, and we found out that you're 
right, that it's right there and it's 
clear--because I don't want to quote 
some stuff that there was no way of 
getting around, love your brother as

yourself, you know, your fellow man 
as yourself but things like that, 
right?  I think we could have won if

we'd really kept talking nothing but, 
but most of the civil rights movement  
01:11:55 
was based on getting new law.  
Totally different, but Martin was 
leading a movement that was a moral 
and spiritual movement.  See, there 
were two movements going on all the 
time within the one--there were two 
going on.  One of them was by any 
means necessary, and the other one 
was nonviolent direct action.  And 
with a biblical base--difference,  
01:12:27 
that's a real difference between 
nonviolence as we had known it in 
India, and what we knew here, we did 
it with a biblical base, based upon 
Jesus.  But there were great deep 
religious undergirding for 
nonviolence in India as far as that's 
concerned, but the one thing about 
this American culture is the matter 
of the Bible as being the final  
01:13:00 
authority on everything.

movement, it's interesting to hear

you say that because there were a lot 
of people in the movement who thought  
01:13:09 
it was too religious.  You're saying 
it wasn't religious enough and that's 
the decision.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.  
That's a good point.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And the same thing on 
the patriotism--there were occasional 
marches where people did carry the 
American flag--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's true.  
01:13:20 
INTERVIEWER:  Famously at Medgar 
Evers' funeral, they were carrying 
American flags because he was a 
veteran--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And he had been 
assassinated, and the police in 
Jackson, Mississippi waded in and 
took the flags away because they were 
upset with them, so--

nonviolence, and one other thing I'd 
like to ask about--  
01:13:40 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Keep going.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Before getting into the 
sit-ins--a number of the people that 
I've talked to who were in Lawson's 
workshops said that there were 
psychological aspects to it as well, 
besides the religious, the patriotic, 
that what you were doing was that 
they'd come into the workshops 
thinking that nonviolence meant a  
01:14:00 
kind of curling into the fetal 
position and that sort of thing to 
protect yourself and Lawson would 
tell them no, you need to make eye 
contact and keep eye contact with 
people.  They have a harder time 
being violent with you when you're 
looking at them and making human 
contact with them, which is kind of 
related to a religious thing because  
01:14:19 
you're saying we're fellow creatures 
and everything.

thing, there was a lot of 
conversation about it.  It was easy 
to understand it, but you see here 
again are these various parts of the 
movement, you see what I mean?  SNCC 
was the one that wanted to curl up 
and get beaten and put over your head 
and all that sort of thing, you get 
my point?  That was not true with  
01:14:43 
SCLC at any point.  I never remember 
that true from beginning to end, and 
the very picture of Martin King is a 
man standing looking at you and 
giving his opinion, or stating the 
truth, you know how it is--giving our 
opinion to the public, right?  But it 
seemed as though that if you didn't 
have a moral and spiritual 
understanding of what you were doing,  
01:15:21 
there was the willingness to duck the 
deal, be willing to get beat, but 
only as a way of saying you're

nonviolent.  But you see, I don't use 
nonviolent by itself anymore.  It has  
01:15:40 
to be nonviolent direct action to me, 
right?  You have to be acting 
nonviolently against the negative 
forces, and that you didn't try to 
get away from being beaten or get 
away from being hit by a car.  Fred 
Shuttlesworth tells about Martin 
walking across the street and a car, 
he and Martin, and a car was sort of 
bearing down on them.  The guy wasn't  
01:16:21 
slowing up, he was picking up speed, 
right?  And Martin just kept going at 
his regular pace, and Fred tried to 
get him to move forward, or said to 
him, you know, out the corner of his 
mouth--that's the way we talk to each 
other when we're in situations like 
that--Martin, this guy is going to 
run over us, right?  And Martin said 
well, you've got to die when your  
01:16:46 
time comes and just kept going like 
he was going.  Now, I don't believe 
that's exactly what Martin said

get word that the sit-ins have 
occurred in Greensboro.  That's on 
February 1st and it's April 19th is 
your big march with the mayor, so 
you've got basically two and a half 
months there of moving into action as 
the sit-ins are sweeping the south.  
What's your memory about how that 
occurred there within this Nashville 
movement?  
01:18:05 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, see, the 
thing I remembered but it turned--I 
thought I remembered, right?  And 
that's very important--what you think 
you remembered and what actually 
occurred, but I know what I 
remembered but I think I had in the 
wrong timing.  Jim called--Jim and I 
were in one of the school buildings, 
and Jim stopped to make a call to the  
01:18:44 
guy who led the group in Greensboro.  
Now, when he did that, he was talking 
to this fellow and I was listening,

01:19:05 
real leaders of it, right?  And Jim 
was talking as though there should 
have been some waiting and joining 
forces on that, because Jim had been 
training for such a long length of 
time, but you see, the action in 
Greensboro, should have is quite 
different--the action in Greensboro, 
what these three guys, four guys--
four it was, wasn't it?  They just  
01:19:37 
sat down.  They hadn't talked to 
nobody, seemingly, right?  They 
decided just to go sit down.  Now, I 
think what Jim was thinking about and 
where we came from out of that whole 
thing was the understanding that you 
can get people destroyed that way, 
that if you just go sit down, you can 
get killed and get a number of other 
people destroyed, whereas if you  
01:20:13 
prepare your people, they don't fight 
back in a way that you can be taken 
over and fight back.  This is why we

could take guys off of the street 
with knives and all that, but we  
01:20:33 
never put them near the front and we 
always had people walking alongside 
that were trained, because we 
understood that without training, 
people will lose it.  I like to think 
this another way, too, by the way, 
and I say I like to think of it--this 
is not something that everybody was 
saying or that I would go hollering 
up and down the street either, right?   
01:21:00 
But see, I really think that when we 
picked places--for instance, we 
picked Alabama, and the three biggest 
most important events of the whole 
movement happened in Alabama.  We got 
the method in Montgomery, we got the 
civil rights bill in Birmingham and 
we got the voting rights bill in 
Selma, right?  When you look at those 
three, there's nothing that comes  
01:21:36 
close to them, right?  Now, that was 
SCLC.  When you look at SNCC, they 
went into Mississippi.  The youngest

least experienced going into the most 
difficult place.  We basically saw  
01:21:59 
Alabama and then if necessary, go to 
Mississippi.  Now, let me say what I 
mean by if necessary.  See, the thing 
is that when we saw Alabama, that's 
where we started.  We wanted to clean 
it up, but we saw it not as the way 
SNCC did.  SNCC saw it as going into 
a place and putting people in various 
places until they changed, until they 
helped the people of that town  
01:22:41 
change, you see?  We didn't.  We saw 
it as changing, changing Washington, 
changing the national laws, not just 
having--not just doing legal stuff, 
right?  But making for certain that 
we change the laws which we did, you 
see what I mean?  This is why we got 
the voting rights bill.  This is why 
we got the civil rights bill, because 
we created what was necessary to do  
01:23:17 
it and stayed with it.  St. Augustine

Montgomery; you see, the march on

INTERVIEWER:  Let me jump in here 
briefly just to make sure people 
understand that when you speak of 
SNCC, you're speaking of the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
which is an allied group but with 
slightly different tactics, the 
younger folks--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, and basically 
all students.  
01:23:46 
INTERVIEWER:  And some of them were 
out of your Nashville movement.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And not only 
Nashville.  Once the meeting at 
Raleigh, at Shaw, once the Shaw 
meeting, students all went there.  
Very few stayed anywhere else, right?  
But a number of the leadership came 
back to SCLC, right?  John Lewis, 
because--and check this, because

checks good stuff.  Here's it, is

together, only because the sit-ins

spread so rapidly that Dr. King 
enabled them to come together and

to coordinate their sit-ins.  They

minister who had, his suit was 
burned.  He was the pastor of a 
Methodist church and a strong 
follower, person, leader within the 
African American community in 
Nashville with Kelly Miller Smith and 
around the idea of nonviolence.  
Well, we were meeting at his church--

name?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  No, that's why I

but it will come up.  No, we'll have 
to look it up because I don't think 
I'll think of it, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But we were at his 
church early one morning because  
01:27:24

meetings for the movement--it was 
early in the morning.  We'd be at one

was an ideal church to be at because  
01:27:39 
it's about two blocks or so from the 
college, Fisk, and then about six 
blocks or so away from Tennessee A&I, 
right, all on the same street which 
made that easy for meetings because 
the rest of us were ministers and so 
forth, and we could take one car.  We 
could drive across town to the 
seminary, right?  And we were older 
anyway.  Now, we were having the  
01:28:21 
meeting when we heard a bombing sound 
but we didn't pay much attention to 
it.  It didn't seem like it was 
close.  The next person coming in 
told us that they had heard what 
seemed like a bomb and they thought 
it was coming from over to Meharry 
Medical which wasn't too far away 
from where we were.  Well, we 
immediately--because we were planning  
01:28:54 
action anyway--immediately came to 
what we would do, right?  If it was a 
bombing over there, what we would

have to do, so we figured out before 
we left the room how we were going to  
01:29:08 
organize community to make certain 
that they dealt with that fact.  And 
then we broke out of there.  Bernard 
Lafayette tells it the best way 
because Bernard, when he broke out of 
that meeting, went to Tennessee A&I 
[phonetic] and started organizing.  A 
couple of other people went to Fisk 
and started to organize.

out right afterwards.  We didn't get 
outside long before people knew that 
the house had been bombed but what 
they first thought it was Meharry, 
because it knocked out--somebody had 
counted the windows, 140-some windows  
01:29:52 
were knocked out, right?  And that's 
the big building, so you could tell 
that from some distance, whereas

Looby's home was a small house on the 
furthest corner across the street  
01:30:09 
from Meharry.  So they immediately 
finding out that Looby's house had 
been bombed just kept going onto A&I 
to get the word out, right?  And in 
order to get the word out, what they 
did was to go into where the 
announcements were made for the whole 
school and started announcing then, 
and they broke for lunch at 11 
o'clock and part of 12 o'clock, and  
01:30:51 
so right after--11 or 11:30--right 
after lunch is when we would start 
the march, and started it from 
Tennessee A&I [phonetic].  By the 
time that we got to Fisk, Fisk was 
letting out.  We met them--instead of 
17th, on 16th, the other end of the 
campus, off of Jefferson Street.  And 
then--no, met them on 17th and the 
students from Pearl High School cut  
01:31:32 
through and met us on 16th Street.  
That's what it was, right?  And we 
kept walking and then the people

would come off their porches and join

in, and keep going--cars would begin 
to drive slowly alongside of us as we 
walked down the way, right?  As we 
were singing a part of the time and 
then when we got close to town, we 
stopped singing and it was a silent 
march where you could hear nothing 
but feet move.  New York had 
pioneered that back in the 1920s, and 
we were really doing the same thing,  
01:32:22 
so that you couldn't hear anything 
but the feet fall.  I remember when 
we turned to go right down into the 
heart of town, some fellows at one of 
the little factories there were 
playing ball at their noon hour, by 
the time we got there it was their 
noon hour and they were playing ball 
as they ate lunch.  Throwing the ball 
back and forth, I mean, playing pitch

and catch, and they saw us coming and 
they began to--you could see them and

the buildings, and as we passed, it 
was very clear that we were not to be  
01:33:11 
played with, there was nothing--and 
they were just so, they thought it 
was quite different, right?  They 
didn't know what to do or what to 
think.  They had never seen this many 
black people before in any mood but 
just, you know, walking down the 
street, but this was quite different 
and they reacted to it quite 
differently but they didn't attempt  
01:33:34 
anything to stop it or to speak back 
to it or to holler or anything, 
right?  They were dead silent, backed 
up against the building and we passed 
on by.  As we came closer to 
downtown, we cut across and went over 
one block over to City Hall.  When we 
got to City Hall, I made a speech to 
the mayor and we had to wait for 
them.  They hadn't come down yet, and

right, when she asked him point blank 
about his manhood, and what would he  
01:34:39 
do and so forth, and it really caught 
him and he had to answer, and that 
was the goodie.  But we had planned 
it so that the final question would 
be asked, but when she asked it he 
really wasn't ready for it and the 
place was surrounded, all that side 
of City Hall was surrounded with 
students, and I remember seeing 
students that had come from Meharry,

but they had not walked down with us 
because they couldn't afford to walk 
out of school, right?  But by the 
time we got down there, there were a 
number of them down there, right?  
Note--the newspapers said the next 
morning there were 2000 of us.  There 
were 4000 of us, and the thing that 
surprised me is that there were 
still--when we had finished there

were still students and people coming

fact, we had had the meeting and it  
01:35:55 
was over before some people actually 
got there.  That's still baffling to 
me and I don't talk about it very 
often because I can't explain it too 
easily, all right, but people were 
coming and coming and coming to be a 
part of that and to make clear where 
they were, what they thought and what

going to examine the matter, right?

that day, everything in Nashville was

open.  It was a great victory for us-

INTERVIEWER:  All right, let's back--
because you have just described one 
of the seminal marches in the early 
movement.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  This is April 19th, 
1960, just a few weeks after the sit-
ins started.  Your confrontation with 
the mayor of Nashville at the end of 
this march--you describe very well  
01:37:29 
how something is both spontaneous and 
planned, because people went out to 
mobilize, made announcements on the 
phone and everything.

march but it wouldn't have happened 
without those people kind of seeding 
the clouds like Bernard Lafayette.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's it.  
01:37:44 
INTERVIEWER:  So it was spontaneous 
and planned--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, and he was in

the meetings that we had.  He was in 
the planning meetings.  He was part  
01:37:50 
of that.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The dialogue between 
the mayor and Diane--of course, this 
is all preserved on television and 
they made a film of it.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, I got a 
record in there, by the way.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  I pulled it out so 
you could see it.  
01:38:05 
INTERVIEWER:  So this is a remarkable 
event, this became one of the 
recruiting things that people would 
use saying if students want to do 
something they can have a march like 
this in Nashville.  This, we had 4000 
people who confronted the mayor and 
Diane said to the mayor, "Do you 
recommend that these segregation laws 
be changed?"  And he kept dodging  
01:38:24 
saying well, I don't have anything to 
do with the laws, that's up to the 
merchants--but she kept pushing,

well, yes, I guess I would recommend-
-I can't justify it and so that 
became quite famous.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, it did.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Tell us a little bit 
about who attorney Looby was, because 
it all started with the bombing of 
his house and we haven't really 
explained to people who he was and 
his relationship to your movement.  
01:38:50 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  Attorney 
Looby was the lead lawyer among 
African American lawyers and 
therefore the movement in Nashville.  
He had a doctorate in law, in fact, 
which most people don't even take the 
time to get, but he really had it.  
He was from the islands, spoke with a 
slight break in it, he'd been there 
for years, been in Nashville for  
01:39:20 
years.  Looby was the natural leader 
of all the lawyers, right?  And a 
spokesman on many occasions but there

were other lawyers that were 
spokesmen, but Looby was the person  
01:39:34 
looked up to.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And when his home was 
bombed--and of course we just a 
little bit more background--his home 
was bombed probably because in-
between the beginning of the 
Greensboro sit-ins on February 1st 
and this march on April 19th, there 
had been sit-ins in Nashville with 
arrests and he was defending your  
01:39:54 
sit-in people who got arrested at 
lunch counters.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, and that's 
true, and he was, and--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And that's what upset 
the white folks, that this was the 
guy who was in the newspapers 
defending them.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, in fact, he 
had been defending us from the very  
01:40:09 
beginning of the action.  I mean, 
when students came down from 
Minnesota and Wisconsin in particular

that I remember, as they went to 
jail, he and all the other black

lawyers met there and worked on their 
behalf as well.  In other words, 
every time anything happened where we 
had to face the law, white law or the 
courts or so forth, all these lawyers 
came forth, but Looby was their 
natural leader and best strategist.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So that's why people 
would react when his home was bombed-
-  
01:40:47 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Precisely.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  --Because he had been 
the defender of the movement.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.

the mayor opened everything up, these 
were lunch counter demonstrations.

of Nashville.  He didn't open up the  
01:40:59 
library and the theaters--go ahead.

but most of the stuff he opened.  He

Lewis's phrase was that once we won

were going to march through the 
yellow pages and get other things 
opened up.

way.

that particular time.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  You mean for the 
theater campaign?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  For the theaters.  
Actually, I was trying to think of 
the fellow's name--I was in Denver.  
I had just gone to Denver to make a 
speech or something, I was coming  
01:42:06 
back from there.  But that night on 
TV, I saw this tall fellow I'm 
thinking about--can you think of his 
name?  He was the vice president of 
the adult group.  You remember that's 
about the time we had this kind of 
halfway split, and he was hit in the 
head with a stone and you saw the 
blood run.  I got up the next morning 
extremely early and took the quickest  
01:42:37 
thing out of town.  It happened to be 
a train, and I got to Kansas City, I 
got off the train, I took a cab

across town and flew into Nashville 
so I could be there in time for the  
01:42:54 
action because there was a march 
afterwards, right, that day coming 
out of--and they were starting at 
Kelly's church.  I remember it better 
for that than for anything else 
because when he was hit in the head, 
that electrified all of us, when he 
started bleeding and I was in Denver 
and I was electrified by it and had 
to come to join it, right?  And we  
01:43:25 
started marches the next day--also 
started some arrests, though, as 
well.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We have to remember 
that one of the things that made the 
theater campaign different is 
theaters aren't open in the daytime 
so these are night marches so it 
gives the Klan and the people 
attacking the cover of darkness, so  
01:43:47 
it required an extra level of 
commitment to march at night.

real night meetings, midnight 
meetings in Savannah, I remember.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.

night or were we doing evenings?

possible when people were trying to 
get in the theaters.

thought.

in, then we didn't wait for them to

INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That bell would 
ring, right--pardon me, we're--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  That's two years later.  
But the sit-in movement has taken 
over the whole country in 1960, 
Nashville keeps marching.  The 
theater campaign was at the end of 
1960, about the time President 
Kennedy was elected and went into  
01:45:01 
1961, and the reason we know that is 
because this is the transition to the 
freedom rides--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Because Nashville was 
having a picnic to celebrate the end 
of the theater campaign to 
desegregate it a year into the sit-in 
movements when the freedom riders 
were ambushed in Birmingham on  
01:45:21 
Mother's Day, 1961.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's true.  
Mother's Day, yeah.

because one of the seminal moments in  
01:45:26 
Nashville is you're having a picnic 
to celebrate this, a lot of shell-
shocked people who have been doing 
marches and going to jail for a year 
and you get word about the terrible 
thing, the bus burned in Anniston, 
the Greyhound and the Trailways bus 
went into Birmingham and people were 
beat up, and the question is, what if 
anything we're going to do about it,  
01:45:48 
and some people at the picnic said 
let's worry about that tomorrow.  We 
deserve this picnic, and other people 
said let's not have the picnic 
because this is a crisis.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  You know, I don't 
even remember anybody saying no.  But 
that meeting that evening was 
something else.  And these are the 
agreements and disagreements here  
01:46:13 
again--you know, who saw, felt and 
thought what, right?  I remember we 
took a break, but we took the break

in the meeting.  When we agreed we 
were really going to Jackson,  
01:46:31 
Mississippi, there were some people 
that broke down and cried.  Diane was 
in charge of the meeting, and she 
asked for a break.  I remember we 
talked outside and were looking 
around, just taking a break, right?  
I remember looking at the sky that 
night and I remembered that we were 
going to leave here and go to 
Jackson, and by the time we got all  
01:47:06 
back together there were 10 students, 
10 or 12, but I think it was 10 
students that were ready to go, all 
right?  The adults that were part of 
the group had to go home to talk to 
their families because we had 
children and had wives and so forth, 
and so we had to go home, but the 
students started to Montgomery--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  To Birmingham.  
01:47:32 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, to Birmingham 
that night.  Now, by the time I get 
there it's Montgomery.

morning, we were at the bus station.  
That's when I joined them.  I'd been

joined them the next morning.  We 
were at the bus station and there 
were a number of folks there at the 
bus station to start.  Now, I can 
give you a story from there.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Let me give a little 
context and then pick up your story, 
because this is a great moment in 
history.  This is when really--the 
kids in Nashville and your group in  
01:48:35 
Nashville refused to let the freedom 
rides die because everybody was 
beaten up--they went home.

you're saying--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So you decided in these 
meetings in Nashville--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We cannot let violence 
stop the movement.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Defeat nonviolence, 
that's the way we said it.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  No, you cannot let 
violence--the violence against the  
01:48:55 
movement stop it.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Stop nonviolence.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But we really--
that's the way it was really stated 
in the meeting.  We had come to that 
conclusion a long time before though, 
right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  So we restated that  
01:49:11 
as basic.  That was right before we 
took the break.

mean?  We stated that, but that was  
01:49:19 
very, very important because it 
became the real statement of not only 
that movement but it became the 
statement for the rest of our 
history, when in no way would we 
allow nonviolence to be destroyed by 
violence, or violence to destroy 
nonviolence, right?

is where there's a mix-up, and if you 
can find some way to deal with it I'd 
like it.  See, Jim Farmer--I heard

already proven the point that an

segregation.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And in fact the way  
01:50:27 
you said it was what he was really 
saying, submitting to segregation.  
The point is afterwards we were 
thinking of it in terms of even you 
couldn't go from one end to the other 
without being possibly killed, you 
get my point?  But I think the way he 
was really saying it was more like 
you said it, right?  Now, both of 
those things became very, very  
01:50:58 
important for us.  I remember a story 
before that, though, that you might 
like to know about.  I was coming 
through Birmingham from somewhere and 
I went into the white room--I 
remember there were two expressions 
that were used because they were 
trying to get around it, and one of 
them--what were the two terms?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Interstate and  
01:51:32 
intrastate?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And intrastate, 
intrastate, remember?  So I went in

and I sat in the white section.  This 
huge policeman came over and he was  
01:51:48 
"wa wa wa wa wa," right?  And so I 
went over to the telephone booth to 
call Fred Shuttlesworth because I was 
in Birmingham now, right, and I was 
calling Fred.  I called Fred and his 
house had been bombed so he could not 
answer, right?  I went--this guy 
looked like he could have played on 
the Chicago Bears, great big guy--
I've met two or three of those in  
01:52:23 
Alabama.  But I went over back and 
sat down and he wanted to get me out 
of there but he didn't call the 
police, which was interesting to me.  
He didn't call the police.  They 
didn't physically move me, which they 
normally would, especially after he 
had made all this--you know, by 
coming over and leaning over the 
telephone booth and all of that.  I  
01:52:53 
thought that he was really going to 
go out of his way to have me moved.  
It wasn't an us, it was me--have me

moved--but he didn't.  I just waited 
for my transportation and got on and  
01:53:11 
came on back to Nashville, I think, 
right--but all of these kinds of 
actions were used because that 
interstate is very, very important 
for where we were going.  For 
instance, when we--and I mention that 
because as we were getting ready to 
leave Montgomery to go to Jackson, 
that was the next morning--everybody 
was ready to go, right?  And people  
01:53:44 
had come in.  Some of them were from 
the meeting the night before; some of 
them were coming from wherever they 
were in town.  Most of the people 
that were coming in from out of town 
were adults who had had to talk with 
their families before they left.  
When we were there, then when we had 
tickets, but they were going to--the 
idea was to deal with those tickets  
01:54:15 
the way that Alabama was doing it, 
intrastate, right, give you a ticket 
that you could only use in-state, but

it was seemingly more of a guise than 
a fact, because they never tried to  
01:54:35 
take our tickets away from us.  When 
we got onto the bus, there were 
already white people on the front of 
the bus, right?  And we had to go to 
the back of the bus because there was 
no other space.  They'd put the white 
people on first, put them right up 
front and the rest of us had to go to 
the back behind them, really.  But 
that took most of all to the very  
01:55:04 
back of the bus, right?  Then when we 
got on, then the state troopers came 
and got the white passengers off the 
bus, and then filled that first with 
the Alabama militia, those first 
three or four rows, and we started 
for--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Jackson.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Jackson, but when 
we were in Alabama, there was kind of  
01:55:40 
a sensible driving and so forth.  
When we got to the state line, the 
bus stopped, and the Alabama militia

got off, but before I say that--as we 
were going to the state line, there  
01:56:01 
was a long trail of cars behind us, a 
huge trail of cars.  Most of them 
turned out to be news people, right?  
We get there, we stop, but we stopped 
to change so that Mississippi militia 
could take the place of Alabama 
militia, but that stopped is what 
they needed to come up along, the 
news people needed to come up beside 
and ask questions, right?  Well, we'd  
01:56:32 
made up our minds that we were not 
going to everybody talking, and we 
chose Jim Lawson to explain 
nonviolence to them because that's 
what we wanted them to know and we 
had learned that what you do, no 
matter what they want, you tell them 
what you want and they have nothing 
to use but what you said, so you 
would get your story out, regardless  
01:56:59 
of what was asked.  So then it was 
handled that way, but I remember the 
Life magazine reading on the front

cover, I'm pretty certain it was the 
front cover or it was the statement  
01:57:19 
over the article--"Asking for trouble 
and getting it."  They didn't 
understand nonviolence and nothing 
Jim said or anybody else said--and 
there wasn't anything in the article 
that said that they understood 
nonviolence and yet that's what we 
were using.  That's why they had the 
movement in the first place.  That's 
what it was all about, because we  
01:57:42 
couldn't have moved the nation 
without the understanding of 
nonviolent direct action.  But the 
news people did not get it, so we 
moved but when we moved out from 
there, there was a colonel from 
Mississippi that got on and he 
unfastened the speedometer, undid the 
speedometer and told the driver to go 
into Jackson, and boy, they just

barreled into Jackson, I mean, 
barreled into Jackson.  All along the 
way, people were on--every little

right?  And if you had a house like 
that you'd want to be out in the open

were all waving, you know?  And then 
later on as we came closer and

closer, and I don't think it was just 
the closeness--I think some of the 
towns are larger than others and in 
the places that were larger, people 
came right out to the edge of the 
road and waved and so forth.  In the 
smaller towns, they stayed on their 
porches and waved.  We came on in to 
Jackson, and when we got to Jackson, 
it started off the bus--well,  
01:59:23 
everybody had had to go to the 
bathroom and he wouldn't stop for us, 
right?  So everybody was anxious to

Then he straightened it up and then 
he turned back around and he said, 
"Get in there."  So we got in, and we

got in, and went to the city jail.  
This is where some stuff can easily 
get mixed up, right?  The difference 
between the city jail and the county-

INTERVIEWER:  The Hinds County Jail.

Jail, but we went to the city jail, 
all right?  I've got my certificate 
from there, hanging on the wall in  
01:04:48 
there, right?  Now, I wasn't for 
certain because Jim Farmer comes a 
day or two later, but the way Jim

writes it is as though he was right 
there coming off that first bus.  But  
01:05:07 
he was not coming off that first bus, 
right?  But the way it sounds--but 
Jim came off a bus with Clarinda 
[phonetic] something, right?  She was 
of Nashville, but she had come lately 
if she was on the bus with Jim, and 
it's something I've never got figured 
out straight in my mind because 
reading to them in the beginning--
it's only later I was trying to get  
01:05:41 
that figured out, right?  And so we 
went to jail and later Jim joined us.  
Now, I bring later Jim joined us up 
because that kind of funny thing 
there is when did Jim come, and--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Jim was on the second 
bus.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's what I 
thought.

bus, you and Jim Lawson--

day.

that from the standpoint of the white

the federal government and the state 
government, that the second bus was a 
terrible surprise to them because 
they had worked out this whole thing 
of rushing the first bus through

Alabama and Mississippi, getting it 
in and allowing you to be arrested 
even though that was against federal

going to do any violence and the 
whole thing will be over, and the 
governor of Mississippi--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  He did, huh?

Mississippi was profoundly upset when 
the second bus came and called up and 
said, "You promised me only one bus."

01:09:10 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.

the state.  The function for 
segregation is wholly a state matter-

REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's exactly, a 
state matter--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Interstate gets the

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Essentially right.

it to be interstate so that the

and this is why I was so surprised 
when the policeman didn't arrest me.

We go to the place, they write us up

In fact, it seemed like we were there 
about a week because we had a Sunday 
service inside, and we had the

service by writing up who was to do 
what and passed it through the bars 
to each other, and then who was

this special service and that's why I 
knew that the weekend had to have 
passed, and I could see us there for 
totally then, because we didn't leave 
the next day, right?  So we must have 
stayed there a week and a half, at 
least.  Do you remember what days we 
entered Jackson and what days we left

go to--we're there.  We set up a 
whole routine.  I think that's very 
important to know, because it showed 
how to do nonviolent direct action.  
Jim had talked about it in India, 
right?  They had a time to meditate 
and a time to--well, he talked about 
time to meditate, what I really 
remember, but I know he must have  
01:12:13 
talked about more than that.  But the 
thing that surprised them in the jail 
is that they'd always slipped food 
through the place where they're 
supposed to slip it through, but then 
people are fighting for it, fighting 
for their meal.  Well, we all went 
and sat down in our chairs around the 
tables that we had, and we'd have two 
people delivering the food to us, two  
01:12:50 
of our people delivering food to us.  
And that just stunned them--they just 
didn't ever understand that, that we

were having order and it put us in 
charge in a way that they didn't like  
01:13:04 
the idea because they were so used to 
people just wanting the food and 
fighting with each other over it that 
they couldn't understand that they 
had to understand the difference 
between us and what they normally 
dealt with.  Now, this deeply 
impressed the black guards, right?  
They really weren't guards.  They 
were prisoners that were--

INTERVIEWER:  Trustees.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Trustees, right, 
and the trustees began from that 
moment on as I remember it.  Maybe it 
was before, but some people remember 
it--as I remember it, from that 
moment on, we could trust trustees.  
They would do things for us.  They'd 
let you know in meaningful ways that 
they were on our side, and that  
01:14:01 
whatever they did they had to do, any 
negative thing, that they had to do 
it because of the white guards.  And

that was very important to us because 
they saw that sense of dignity, liked  
01:14:17 
it and they understood what effect it 
had on the white people running the 
jails.  Now, let's look at that 
again, because that was the kind of 
thing that was making the difference 
for us when we did the church 
service.  I remember the next 
morning, the morning before we went, 
it must have been two, three days 
later, because the day before we went  
01:14:51 
out to Parchman, this tall--it was a 
lieutenant type, right?  He had a 
certain--he had something in for me, 
right?  And I was trying to get where 
he was coming from.  I just couldn't 
understand where he was coming from, 
so Jim Bevel was from Mississippi, 
right?  So I said to Jim, I said, 
what is wrong with this guy?  And Jim 
laughed and he says, you're a man.

talking about?  And he said he's not 
used to anybody black looking him in

the eye, and to look him in the eye 
to him was almost an insult and you  
01:15:47 
never turned away and you talked to 
him straight.  And I wasn't being 
unusual, I was just talking to him, 
you know, just like you'd talk to 
somebody, right?  And it seemed like 
the more we talked, the madder this 
guy got, and yet there was nothing in 
the conversation to me that would 
create anger under any circumstances, 
right?  And Jim laughed because he  
01:16:19 
was the only one that--we northerners 
didn't understand this white-black 
relationship.  Jim Bevel understood 
it totally and he understood what was 
moving this guy.  Well, we wake up 
the next morning--they wake us up the 
next morning very early and take us 
out to Parchman, right?  So we're out 
to Parchman--

them what Parchman is.

Prison is one of the most vicious 
prisons ever.  I have an entire book  
01:16:58 
on Parchman that was written years 
ago, right?  They had two burial 
grounds there, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  It was modeled on a 
plantation.  It is a farm.  It's a 
farm-prison.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's it--it's a 
farm-prison.  And the best way to say 
that--and I like that it was modeled 
on a plantation.  I had never heard  
01:17:20 
it that way, but it was.  I mean, the 
whole thing was in fact--it was 
probably a plantation at one time 
before it was the farm that they 
used.  And they don't know how many 
people were killed in that thing, 
right?  Because there wasn't any real 
formal cemetery arrangements, as much 
as people were just buried on top of 
each other as they died and as things  
01:17:51 
went on.  So we get to Parchman and 
so they start to find out about us.  
The next day they start questioning

us really--the regular arrangements, 
and so they start questioning us and  
01:18:16 
there's a girl that was in there 
right before me, was first, and ends 
up in tears, right--I could hear it 
through the walls.  And we were upset 
about it, but nothing to do about it.  
In fact, we weren't even where you 
could see in.  We were hearing 
through the walls.  And I was next.  
Well, this guy that didn't like the 
fact that I was looking, just looking  
01:18:51 
at him and talking, right?  He was 
there.  He didn't go back to Jackson.  
He stayed there for all the 
questioning, right?  When we started 
to question, they asked me a question 
and I said yes and no.  And then they 
said, "say sir," so fine, you know, I 
wasn't there to be making an argument 
for anything, and so I said "sir."  
So they ask a couple of other  
01:19:24 
questions, and then I answered them 
"yes, sir," and "no, sir" and they 
were simple questions, and then they

asked me right quick, the guy that 
was asking questions, turned right  
01:19:37 
quick--and that was the warden of the 
place, and he said, "Do you have 
syphilis?"  And I said no.  And they 
jumped on me, right?  We were sitting 
close to each other, and they jumped 
on me--there were about five or four, 
I think, four or five of them, and 
they jumped on me.  Well, it was 
obvious, this is what the guys from 
downtown had been waiting for, right?   
01:20:08 
And he out comes with this flapjack 
and he's right down on top of me, 
right?  And I was just warding off 
blows, right?  But that caused his 
hand to turn, and his hand to turn, 
it was no longer a flapjack, it was 
the edges of this--it was a pretty... 
See, some of them are just black 
leather around a piece of lead, 
right?  This one was pretty  
01:20:44 
embellished with figures and so 
forth.  But it was so pretty, it was 
thick tan leather so that steel was

inside, but it was thick and it had 
sharp edges, and when his hand  
01:21:05 
turned, it was no longer hitting you 
like a flapjack would, right?  It 
turned and it cut me right down the 
side, there.  As soon as the blood 
spurted out, they jumped back.  I 
mean, they jumped back and they 
looked at each other.  I wondered 
what really happened, because I 
didn't understand until later and I 
was looking at them as if to say,  
01:21:30 
"What is this all about?"  No more 
beating, no more questioning--they 
had a guy to take me back to the 
cells because we were out in front--
back to the cells, so he's taking me 
back to the cells and we make a turn 
and go down, you make a turn and go 
straight on in to the first part of 
the cells and then there was a turn 
there, right?  Where a great big  
01:22:01 
steel gate was, so the guy unlocks 
the gate and tells me to go on in, so 
I start in and I'm going into the

jail and suddenly I feel something.  
Now, the guy's really a long ways  
01:22:24 
from me--he's about 10 foot from me, 
right?  He's at the end of that cell, 
right--at least I thought he was, but 
I know he was in where this--if the 
door had been closed, he would have 
had to have moved, right?  And I'm 
walking in, and I feel something 
right down the back of my neck, and 
it's just like that, just like it's--
looked like a half question mark in  
01:23:02 
my mind, and I saw it as red, and 
only occasionally do I ever dream in 
color, much less--and I wasn't 
dreaming, and I was standing up 
walking and I could feel this thing, 
and so I stopped and I look around at 
him, because any time anything that 
you've never felt before and never 
had any knowledge or thought of 
happens to you, what you do is to  
01:23:35 
turn to any human, another human 
being, you know, anybody that's 
there.  So I turned around to look at

him and so much as if to say, did you 
feel that?  When I realized I was  
01:23:50 
looking in a 45, or a 38, either one-
-I think it was a 38, actually.  I 
was looking into the barrel of this 
38 because I was looking in his eyes, 
because you look to see him, you 
know, to ask him the question without 
announcing it, you know, what did you 
feel?  You're feeling at the same 
time you're asking, and then I 
realized he had a gun on me and I was  
01:24:18 
looking down the barrel of it so I 
just kind of slumped and looked at 
him as if to say, "What kind of human 
being are you," you know what I mean?  
I just couldn't take it in, that 
somebody was standing there with a 
gun.  You're just, you're going to 
take two more steps and you're 
totally inside with all the other 
guys, right?  Because you have to  
01:24:39 
make little quick turns there.  And 
so I look at him and he's got this 38 
on me, and I just look at him and I

look him straight in the eye, looking 
at him as if to say "What is wrong  
01:24:58 
with you?"  You know, and he's trying 
to make up his mind whether he's 
going to shoot me or not.  That's 
obvious and I just keep looking at 
him and he decides he's not going to 
shoot me, so he just pulls down his 
gun and throws it in his holster, 
slams this big steel door and those 
big jail doors, you know, you don't 
forget the sound them, right?  You  
01:25:31 
can't repeat it but you don't forget 
the sound of it, right?  And then he 
turned around and walked straight 
down that long hallway, and I just 
kept looking until we came to that 
first turn going back.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  But all this time 
you're bleeding, right?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, 
yeah.  But they--I don't know how

that--I guess we just stopped it 
somehow, right?  I don't remember.  I 
remember being beat like that in

another place, but in that place they 
had doctors come, right?  But this  
01:26:16 
one, I don't remember a doctor coming 
at all.  But they prepared--they 
began to prepare--well, let's get the 
rest of the story.  That's very 
important.  So I go on in and the 
guys wonder what's happening and we 
talk, you know, but then they let a 
guy out because by that time there 
were people all over the jail.  
Remember, bus after bus kept coming— 
01:26:49 
it wasn't just one bus or two buses, 
right?  Buses kept coming, kept 
coming, kept coming, right--and so 
this one white fellow that was with 
us for some reason was let out and 
I've read why he was let out but I 
don't remember why it is now.  He was 
let out and there was press that he 
talked to and Washington began to 
call, and then I began to understand- 
01:27:23 
-I mean, afterwards I understood, 
what really happened is they were not 
supposed to beat anybody.  And they

bled me--they beat me until I bled, 
right?  Well, that's what they were  
01:27:38 
upset about--not the beating but the 
fact that I bled.  This guy said that 
I'd been beaten.  It was--Kennedy got 
it within a couple hours, and it was 
back on the warden, right?  The 
warden was very, very fearful that he 
was going to be removed.  We found 
that out later--I didn't know that, 
but we found that out later.  Then 
about that time, Kelly Miller called,  
01:28:15 
right, and a woman from my church had 
called earlier than that, and they 
weren't going to let her talk but she 
demanded to talk, right?  So I knew 
what the kind of stuff was like and 
that was the day or two before, 
right--that my member called.  But 
then Kelly called and within hours 
Kelly showed up, right?  Remember all 
this started early in the morning,  
01:28:48 
and Kelly showed up and took me back 
to Nashville.

01:29:01 
to get me, and then we drive back.  I 
know we drive back into Jackson.  I 
think we took a plane into Nashville, 
though.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  That was a very nervy 
thing for him to do, to come into 
Parchman.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, yeah, that's 
exactly right.  See, but he's got the 
word now from Kennedy, you see what I  
01:29:28 
mean?  The difference--that same fear 
was in them.  See, as soon as the FBI 
has showed up and/or official 
Washington showed up, because most of 
those guys in the FBI were from the 
region that they were sent back to, 
right?  So I didn't see that as a big 
thing but I found out that when they 
do come, generally because 
Washington's given them the word,  
01:29:59 
they act as though--they started 
becoming creepy, right?  They start 
worrying because they don't know

01:30:13 
not in charge and they don't know 
what's going to happen to them, 
especially when they have done 
something to someone and Washington 
cares about it, right?  For instance, 
there were a number of people that 
were let in the jails that a marshal 
was in one of the jails.  I didn't 
see him because I was a short length 
of time, but Marshall was in one of  
01:30:39 
the jails.  The NAACP was in one of 
the jails.  Our top man in 
Mississippi got to come in and visit 
early, when we were in the downtown 
jail.  A woman, I can't think of her 
name but she was a powerful Methodist 
woman could come on into the jail 
when we were in Jackson-

transformed the whole movement from

May through the summer of 1961,

freedom riders.

the summer and it became quite a 
phenomenon--can you tell me, when you 
came out of prison, what was it like 
to come out of Parchman as a freedom 
rider?  Could you tell the world had  
01:31:41 
changed?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  No.  See, this is 
one reason I wished I had been there 
all summer.  See, I wasn't there but 
a week and a half, two weeks--that's 
a good point.  The blood came out, 
right?  I was saved by the blood.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, no, it's been a

large part of my understanding of my 
identity, right?  But the major one 
for me is that--internally is the one 
where I got feel that down the back 
of my head, right, and that this guy 
wanted to shoot me and didn't, all 
right?  Now, that to me is the 
deepest piece.  It was as though I 
was warned--I'm walking away from the 
guy.  Parchman is a place where they  
01:33:41 
kill anybody black any time they want 
to, right?  We were the only two 
there because whatever the prisoners 
said wouldn't have made a difference, 
but we couldn't even see them.  It 
was as though this--I've often wanted 
to go through and walk through all of 
this again, but it's as though they 
made this place in the jail as though 
most of the jail, the open area where  
01:34:09 
people came to is back here--then 
there was a crook, well, you've got 
to do it this way.  A kind of crook

And you know, the big gate, and only 
one guy could get--well, two or three 
guys could get through the gate but 
they would be jamming up trying to 
get any further, but I think it was 
really to keep guys from coming out  
01:34:52 
of the cell in case anything 
happened, right?  Jammed them up 
there at the gate.  The guys, the 
policemen would be standing down at 
the end of the hall and they would 
never get out of the hall.  See, 
that's really what was happening.  
But see, it's the mystery of that--I 
feel something that causes me to turn 
around and the guy's got the gun on

my head.

favor, right?  And then suddenly when 
I feel this red, I can see red, 
right?  Down the back of my head, and 
I turn around and there's that gun.  
To me that's one of the most--I've 
only had a couple what I call truly 
religious experiences like that in my 
life.  I had another one in a jail in 
Alabama where I just put my fingers 
behind my head just in time--if I had

had more time, my fingers would have 
been like that and when that billy

could have really hurt me deeply, you

know?  But it hit me right, just as 
my fingers came together, so it  
01:37:01 
padded the blow, but the ends of my 
fingers I couldn't feel for three 
days.  It took three days for the 
pain to stop in my hand.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you remember which 
jail this was or when?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  No, I can see the 
jail, I can see the jailer, and I can 
see the warden of the jail because 
the whole thing was--for instance,  
01:37:27 
they bring me in, I think it was 
right after this thing with Sheriff 
Clark.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Oh.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  See, they put me in 
jail there.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So this is in Selma?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, this is in 
Selma, and they take me over to the 
jail, and this is another one of  
01:37:45 
those great big guys.  Remember I 
said a while ago, every now and then 
there was some one of these policemen

that looked like he should have been 
on the--playing halfback for the  
01:37:56 
Bears or something, right?  Huge guy.  
I kind of knew what was happening 
when we got onto the elevator--it's 
one of those little dinky elevator 
types from that period, you know, 
we're talking about 50, 60 years ago, 
right?  And it worked by hand, you 
know, they used to all work by hand 
like department stores and they had 
pretty girls there doing it, all that  
01:38:26 
kind of stuff, right?  But this guy 
was the head of the jail, and he 
started to take us up, and we were 
crowded on this, because the other 
guy's so big, and the guy was in 
charge of the jail and I'm about the 
same size, but all three of us 
together filled that little--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Elevator.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Elevator, but what  
01:38:58 
bothered me about it was I knew when 
I stepped on it what was happening.  
I just knew that this guy was going

to try to hit me, but I could feel it 
but I didn't really know it until he  
01:39:15 
said to the jailer, he said to him, 
let me hit him.  And it felt as 
though he would be able to be okay 
with the jailer, right?  And he said 
let me hit him, and this great big 
guy, and he was behind me, right?  He 
couldn't swing too well--it was kind 
of tight in there, but he was behind 
me, and then he asked him, let me 
hit--and the jailer looked at him as

what I mean?  But he couldn't say 
nothing.  See, one of the things you 
learn, and you don't have to be in 
the deep south, and you don't have to 
be in jail and you don't have to be 
between policemen--is that the 
hardest thing for a white man to do 
is to tell another white man he's a 
racist.  And I don't care where you  
01:40:10 
are, and I can give it to--25, 30 
years ago.  I could give it to you 
north as well as south, but

particularly in the south.  So I knew 
what was going to happen, and the  
01:40:26 
jailer turned his head.  When the 
jailer turned his head, I knew it was 
coming, boy, and I just went up like 
that, and I was trying to get my 
fingers together and just as they 
came together the blow came down, 
right, and that gave me a cushion, 
and that cushion made all the 
difference in the world, because when 
they hit you with a club--and he was

the only time--

record was that you went into Good 
Samaritan Hospital.  Dr. King tried 
to visit you, but by the time he got

there, you were already back in the 
jail.

this wouldn't have--no, because let 
me tell you, no, it couldn't have  
01:41:13 
been then.  Let me tell you what 
happened.  When they took me 
upstairs--you know, that's why we 
were in the elevator.  We went up to 
where the cells were, right?  Because 
that's different than the other place 
we were talking about--we were 
talking about Parchman, right--

on the farm, they've got plenty of 
room.  So we go and the guy, the 
warden opens the cell and this other 
guy just shoves me in, right?  And 
the beds are made to the wall.  I 
mean, they're made to the wall.  And 
so man, when I got in there, I jumped  
01:42:03 
with joy, right?  Well, now, it 
sounds like I jumped with joy because 
they didn't shoot me or something,

mean, very quickly I was praying--
thank you father, because I did what 
I was supposed to do.  Do you 
understand the point?  And this is 
why I know I'd had an encounter with 
someone and this is why I was 
thinking about, it was Selma, because 
I felt that way after the encounter 
in Selma, that I had said all the 
right things, I had done all the  
01:42:41 
right things.  That Selma thing 
sounds like it's almost written,

idea what I was going to say as I was 
walking to it.

I got there.  I thought they would 
let us in and we would have some sort 
of encounter or conversation or 
whatever with whoever was in charge 
of the voting.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The courthouse?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, see what I 
mean?  But he comes out of the

courthouse--right, he comes out of 
the courthouse and closes the door 
behind him.  The door's closed, but I 
mean, he let the door close behind 
him but he had all his guys out up on 
the top step, so when we get there on 
the bottom step they're on the top 
step, right?  And we march up to him, 
okay?  About 40 people.

stop, but it's in the middle of

is when the guy that took me back to

one of the great seminal

director of affiliates at SCLC?  
Because that will set us--and then we 
can stop.  Just--this is just a job.

quickly.  I was a leader--I had left  
01:45:23 
Nashville to go to Chattanooga and I 
was pastoring in Chattanooga.  I'd 
built a church in Nashville--when I 
went to Chattanooga, I wanted to 
build a church as well, because the 
church we had--nice, but it wasn't 
what I wanted.  But there was a 
fellow there that was the pastor of 
the church a block away, who was--he 
loved journalism as I did, right?  We  
01:45:52 
had met one time before because we 
were trying to put our two newspapers 
together to save money and all that 
sort of thing and just change names 
and use both his information and my 
information to make it more of a 
newspaper.  And also, Jesse Hill here 
in Atlanta, we were trying to all 
three get together and after all, 
Jesse had money and we didn't, right?   
01:46:26 
But so I had met this fellow from 
Chattanooga before, and he was a 
bright guy and it was just nice to be

with the group, but he had the stats 
on voting in Chattanooga.  That's  
01:46:46 
what I needed in order for us to plan 
strategy.  When I saw what the stats 
were, I thought, well, what are we 
standing still for?  And I'm used to 
the action--I'd just left where we'd 
just opened up Nashville, right?  And 
I begin to organize it and he had all 
the stats we needed and had some 
contacts, but he wasn't light and 
that was what was slowing him down.   
01:47:21 
I happened to be light, so coming in 
from a victory like that and 
everybody thankful in Chattanooga, 
get my point, that anything had 
happened.  So we got together and 
then we began to plan the real action 
for it.  We created--we ended up 
before it was over electing three-
fifths of city hall, and on one of 
the rainiest election days that  
01:47:52 
anybody would want to see--that 
usually slows us down tremendously, 
slows everybody down, but if you're

not used to voting it slows you down 
more than that.  We went and got  
01:48:07 
people out of beds and so forth, 
right?  The rain slacked off by the 
end of the day and we were getting 
people out and into vote.  We took 
three-fifths of the city council.  We 
didn't get the mayor.  Now, this is 
what I forgot to tell you about, an 
important part of the strategy was 
this--we found out that 20% of the 
vote in Chattanooga was paid for.   
01:48:39 
They paid black people to vote, but 
we saw that 20% as totally different 
so my basic speech was--or end to the 
basic speech as I was going over the 
city, getting people out the vote was 
that they have been making a fool out 
of you by buying you, as though you 
were slaves.  Let's make a fool out 
of them, right?  And take their 
money, keep it.  They can't pay you  
01:49:16 
what they owe you, but vote like you 
want to.  In fact, I was right down

we had to take--we took three 
straight elections.  This guy had his 
straw hat on and waiting for people

all that, vote for whatever this

the next thing I saw him getting out.

I mean, within minutes, so when he 
left, I walked up to them and I said, 
"What happened?"  And he says he 
wanted to vote for, I think the guy's 
name was Brown, and he wanted to vote 
for Brown and I said well, yeah, but 
that's who you're supposed to be 
taking.  He said I know it.  The 
point is, he was keeping the money

was buying him--it was that kind of

to?

point--that's how Martin knew how

next thing was Chattanooga, and we 
won that.  In fact, we even created a 
statewide voters organization.  So 
Martin asked me to come and Dorothy 
Cotton had heard me give a speech 
somewhere and Dorothy Cotton had been

wanted to--

he wanted to see me and the next 
thing I know, Wyatt Tee Walker is

it, right?  About being this new post

branches, you see?  We had affiliates 
just so we could have a name for all  
01:52:09 
the things, so if it had Martin's 
name on it or if it was SCLC-
affiliated, I was over that and 
having to take care of it and deal 
with it and etcetera.  And the way we 
were structured, the money didn't 
come from the ground up.  The money 
came from the national office down, 
you see what I mean?  Every local 
tried to get as much of their own  
01:52:37 
funding as they could, but for 
serious projects we got it from the 
office so they called me to come in.  
I was also a troubleshooter in that 
sense, so I traveled everywhere.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So for the rest of the 
career that we'll talk about later--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Your movement 
affiliation is with the SCLC as  
01:52:57 
director of affiliates.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, I gave it up 
as I left to take SCLC's job.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So that became a full-
time job--I think you went in 1962, 
which is before Birmingham.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, in 
fact that is exactly at Birmingham.  
See, that was my first assignment out 
of the national office.  That was my  
01:53:18 
assignment out of the national 
office.  Wyatt Tee Walker and I began 
Birmingham.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  See, Fred 
Shuttlesworth really had begun 
Birmingham a long time ago, get my 
point?  But our participation in it 
was at that exact point.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm.  
01:53:39 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  I joined Wyatt Tee 
and we go into Nashville to open it 
up.

King's big gamble, to go into 
Birmingham.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  It was, but I was 
there giving a speech last week, two 
weeks ago, something like that in the 
last couple of weeks, and something 
really became very clear as I was 
going to the speech, that had we lost  
01:54:09 
Birmingham, there wouldn't have been 
a voting rights bill.  If we'd lost 
Birmingham we couldn't have made 
Selma.  Birmingham was the necessary 
thing, but we see--you see, we could 
not lose--I know I'm not on your 
track right now.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  No, you're on the 
track--

Birmingham is Dr. King's big go-for-
broke, because what he said was--at 
his convention in Birmingham in '62 
at the end, he said in the eight 
years since the Brown decision we've 
been working hard in the movement but 
the opposition has organized as 
powerfully as we have, and right here 
during his convention he said it took 
23,000 soldiers to get James  
01:54:59 
Meredith, one black student in Ole 
Miss, we've got to take a big break 
or we're going to lose our window in 
history, so he said we can go in and 
try to do Birmingham, so that's your 
first assignment, and Wyatt Walker 
presented his plan for it called 
Project C for confrontation--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, that's it.  
And this is why he goes in, right?  
01:55:21 
INTERVIEWER:  Wyatt Walker was Dr. 
King's chief of staff.

in to open it up.  But what I was— 
01:55:35 
well, I've said what--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Just do a little bit of 
the beginning of Birmingham, what you 
remember about that, where we can 
end.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's what I want 
to do right now.  In fact, when we 
began Birmingham, when we began 
Birmingham, SCLC began Birmingham,  
because Fred was so important--I just  
01:55:51 
never like to act as though it 
started with us.  It started with 
Fred, right?  But when we first moved 
in, this story tells you exactly what 
was going on.  We were trying to set 
up this little office, right, that we 
had--Wyatt and I, right?  And so 
looking out a window and you saw the 
telephone company building--you could 
see the whole side of it, right?  And  
01:56:28 
it had balconies all the way up on 
each floor, and there were two guys 
out there smoking cigarettes, so I

was me, I think it was Wyatt that  
01:56:44 
made a telephone call.  And I saw 
those guys sort of hurry in as he was 
making the call, all right?  So when 
Wyatt gets off the phone I said 
Wyatt, I think I know that those guys 
over there on that balcony are 
government guys, right?  And so let's 
have some fun.  So we started making 
telephone calls and they would run 
in, and then we'd hang up the phone  
01:57:22 
and they'd appear again.  So we did 
it about four or five times and so we 
knew what was really happening and it 
was always funny to me to think 
about, it's bad enough that you're in 
Birmingham, right, but the feds on 
top of that increased it, but you 
were very clear where you were, what 
was going on, who you were going to 
have to deal with--it all became very

clear when you picked up that phone,

where we always knew that we were 
being bugged, right?  And as we  
01:58:07 
rented this little space, the first 
thing we did was to begin to look for 
bugs, because if we could stop it, 
fine, you know?  If we couldn't, 
fine, but we knew that we had 
problems that we weren't expecting in 
terms of cutting off the whole 
telephone call.  It's one thing to be 
bugged in your room.  It's another 
one that every telephone call that  
01:58:36 
comes in and out of your place is 
also going to be covered, you know 
what I mean?  But it gave us 
something to go with.  Now, let's 
look at another because you're 
looking more for high points--let's 
look another at Birmingham, because 
everybody knows when the hoses were 
turned on, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  May 3rd.  
01:59:01 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  I love it--May the 
3rd.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Okay, good, all 
right.  So we were sending students 
downtown--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Young kids.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.  They 
were turning the hoses on them.  We 
were sending guys out--Wyatt and I  
01:59:33 
were inside the church, right?  Wyatt 
and I were inside the church so that 
we were sending folk out the front 
door towards the park, and while the 
firemen and so forth were all 
involved in that, we were sending 
others out the back door right down 
the street, get a bus, and we're 
going right downtown.  Finally, the 
sheriff who is head of the--  
02:00:08 
INTERVIEWER:  Bull Connor. 
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Bull Connor, head 
of police department and the fire.

INTERVIEWER:  Head of police--right.  
Public safety commissioner, they 
called him.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right, and 
remember, in this same time he ran 
for mayor.  He was trying to take it 
all, right?  And he thought this was 
the time to do it.  Remember, we 
stopped then and went to Washington.  
So he must have gotten a call that  
02:00:35 
said they're downtown, because all of 
the sudden the hoses stopped, because 
there wasn't any sense to keep 
turning the hoses on us.  We were 
already downtown.  They expected us 
all to come out the front door.  We 
had them going out the back door, 
taking buses downtown, and changed 
the tenor of it all, right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely.  That was  
02:00:59 
the--of course, there had been all 
these demonstrations in Birmingham 
and I want to talk after a break

about the decision to use young 
people because I know that was  
02:01:09 
crucial.  What you just described was 
when finally after the big 
breakthrough that melted people's 
hearts in a way, you occupied 
downtown so much that the city powers 
wanted to make a deal so that was 
really the beginning of the deal.

right; that was the beginning of the 
deal.

Birmingham.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's the only 
thing--one other piece with that, it 
was the dogs.

REVEREND VIVIAN:  You see what I 
mean?  That dog thing backfired on 
them.

hoses too.  The dogs and the hoses.

combination.  It was that

combination--it said how really

it, and the whole world knew that 
that kind of brutality couldn't--made 
us honest.  I mean, they knew that we 
were saying everything that we were 
saying was right.

what, when the dogs showed up, when 
they turned those dogs on us and the

when you did the march in Nashville, 
the Looby march in April of 1960, 
that you sang for a while and then 
switched to a silent march going into 
downtown after a technique that had  
01:00:19 
been developed in New York in the 
1920s.   
 
Can you just tell us briefly about 
that, in New York in the 1920s, if 
you know, because we hadn't heard 
about that.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, I don't know 
much about it.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Uh-huh.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Except that it was  
01:00:31 
called the silent march, all right, 
and it was designed by W.E.B. Du 
Bois.  But all the great ones of that

around lynching, right?

01:02:26 
tell the story; if not, just tell me 
and I'll move on.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Okay, good.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The moment when Dr. 
King in the Gaston Motel had to 
decide whether or not to go to jail 
when he went into the Birmingham 
jail-- 
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, that's great.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The famous story about  
01:02:40 
Dr. King and everything--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  I'm not the one to 
tell you that.  I wasn't there.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  You weren’t there, 
okay.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But the person who 
tells it so well is Dorothy Cotton.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  She tells it so 
well.  
01:02:52 
INTERVIEWER:  Dorothy Cotton was on 
Dr. King's staff, actually came down 
from Petersburg with Wyatt Walker.

01:02:58 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, I know her very 
well.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And there was 
another guy with them--Wyatt Tee 
brought two people, one of them was 
Dorothy and another one was another 
person that never gets brought up.  
He turned to radio here in town very 
early after coming.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  The  
01:03:21 
decision--because even after Dr. King 
came out of jail in Birmingham, 
before those big dogs and hoses 
marches, the Birmingham movement was 
almost on life support and Bevel and 
Dorothy Cotton and the people running 
those youth workshops said we're not 
out of volunteers yet, we've got 
these young people.  And lots of 
people have talked about debates  
01:03:42 
within the movement over whether to 
use young people and how young to use 
them.  Does that trigger anything?

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, yeah, 
definitely.  That was a real  
01:03:52 
argument--what should happen.  Bevel 
was the one that really said young 
people should go, right?  That you're 
never too young to fight for your 
freedom became the thing for all of 
us, but I mean it was Bevel who 
brought it up and really fought for 
it, and Diane of course, they were 
married at the time.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
01:04:16 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But that changed 
things.  In fact, I have a list of 
six things I want to give to the 
museum in Birmingham, I mean, ideas, 
right?  And that's one of them, that 
they're not highlighting that enough.  
It's the only place--I want to say in 
the western world, but it's the only 
place in nonviolent work I know in 
the west where there was a children's  
01:04:45 
movement.  Now, but do you know the 
other part of it where they get out 
to the jail, because when the people

that Sunday, when people come out and 
go out to the jail to sing to their  
01:05:00 
kids and the firemen refused to turn 
the hoses on them?  Okay, I just 
wanted to be certain that that's--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  That's a great story.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, that's a great 
story.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  But the decision to use 
children--and you're absolutely 
right.  I wrote in one of my prefaces 
that the only parallel that I know of  
01:05:20 
is the Passover story, where the 
children in Egypt had--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Talk about going 
back.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  But I mean, where 
people that young have that kind of 
historical impact.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's a good 
story.  That's exactly right.  That's 
exactly right.  It just didn't  
01:05:36 
happen.  In fact, this is why there 
was an argument against using them, 
because it was thought--everybody

thought, oh, you shouldn't use 
children.  Why not, right?  But I  
01:05:44 
think one of the reasons is because 
most adults weren't ready to do it, 
period, right, much less have 
children do it.  Listen, I remember 
doing that thing, having kids out of 
one of the high schools--high schools 
are like small colleges, right?  And 
they were coming out of windows, 
coming down, and you reminded me when 
you said that one of my arguments I  
01:06:14 
was making to the kids is that it had 
been raining one morning when I went 
over there and the stream was coming 
through the schoolyard and I told 
them, cross over Jordan, baby, let's 
go.  Let's go do it, right?  And we 
did, and we did, and they were right 
with it.  Listen, they so badly 
wanted to come out, the principal had 
to so badly keep them in, they locked  
01:06:43 
the doors and so the kids were 
crawling out of windows and jumping 
down from that second floor because

the first floor's always a little 
higher.  They were coming down and  
01:06:54 
hanging down and falling and jumping 
out of windows so that they could go 
on out and do it.  There was no doubt 
in the kids' minds, none at all-- 
 
INTERVIEWER:  No, but plenty in the 
adults' minds.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's exactly 
right, but not in the kids' minds and 
I think part of it, I think that the 
adults were afraid they may be blamed  
01:07:15 
for something, you see what I mean?  
Rather than--because all of us in 
Birmingham knew, everybody in 
Birmingham was part of the movement.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  But then like so 
many things, you never knew what the 
police were going to do to them.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So that's a good 
comment about the fatefulness of the

children in Birmingham.

march on Washington?

memories--no, I have a picture where 
they cut my head off.  Who was the 
great writer of that time?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Baldwin?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Baldwin.  Baldwin's 
being there was the most interesting 
thing for me that I consider a story, 
but it's just that he was there and  
01:08:09 
we were involved in the back and we 
were talking and so forth--and not 
just he and I, I mean, you know, a 
whole gang of us, about 15, 20 of us.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Back to Birmingham, 
just briefly, for all the argument 
and the resistance of the parents in 
Birmingham, there were arguments in 
practically every black home in 
Birmingham about what to do with  
01:08:28 
this, should we let our children do 
it, should we keep them from doing 
it.  It's also true, though, that a

lot of the parents who didn't want 
their children involved in,  
01:08:36 
practically none did, were converted 
by their children when they actually 
did it.  There's this famous story of 
the woman walking along the line, all 
upset that she sees her 8-year-old 
marching and then she says sing, 
children, sing, because...  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  She changed her 
mind.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  She just kind of gave  
01:08:55 
into it, so that happened.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Sing, children, 
sing--I guess, I never heard that one 
but I love it, because whether it's 
true or not it gets the whole feeling 
of everything that happened, the 
stuff that happened.  But I was very 
clear that everybody wanted it to 
happen.  Now, not that--when I say 
everybody, it's over 200.  There was  
01:09:25 
a lot of argument but I don't think 
it was nearly as intense as it seems, 
because--and when the children went

think it was no longer because they 
knew they wouldn't be hurt, right?

their parents coming out.

Sunday in September?

you go in for the funeral or any of

year and breakthrough for nonviolence 
and everything and your SCLC  
01:10:25 
convention was in Richmond, and you 
had a nonviolent workshop there that 
I know you were on called the Power 
of Nonviolence with you, Bayard 
Rustin, Jim Lawson and James Bevel 
talk about the power of nonviolence 
in the year 1963.  It was in a hotel 
in Richmond.  Is that in the blur?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  To me it's just 
another one of those speeches.  
01:10:47 
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  What I mean is you 
did so much of them at that time, you 
know, it didn't stand out.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah.  The next year, 
1964, is the year of the filibuster, 
the passage of the civil rights bill 
and for Dr. King it's widely 
overlooked and not very much known 
because what dominated the news was  
01:11:07 
Mississippi summer where the students 
and SNCC were in freedom summer that 
year--

leader of that group.  Some people 
told me that Dr. King actually didn't 
really want to go--in fact, I think 
Andy told me that Dr. King didn't 
want to get engaged in a major 
movement there with the filibuster 
going on but it just kind of 
happened.  Does that seem true?  
01:11:32 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, there was 
more to it than that because I went 
down.  There was an argument over 
should we, but the real argument was-
-but what we need to do is to keep 
the legislation moving in Washington.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  See what I mean?  
The real reason for St. Augustine was 
not St. Augustine, right?  It was  
01:11:56 
keeping the legislation going, coming 
out of Birmingham.  It's because we 
had to get Johnson to really come

through with that stuff, right?  We 
had heard it, and then Johnson came  
01:12:11 
through with it which is why we got 
to march, had to wait until the 
second, third time, right?  Because 
Johnson hadn't signed off on the 
stuff we wanted to.  You knew that of 
course, right?  But then the next 
step was that once it got to 
congress, could we get it through 
congress?  St. Augustine's real 
purpose was to get it through  
01:12:36 
congress.  Well, you can tell that 
story better than I can probably, but 
the point is that I wanted to go.  
Bevel didn't want to go, you notice 
Bevel wasn't there because part of 
the argument was that it's not 
necessary, it's unimportant, you 
know, it's small stuff.  But usually 
I didn't get in the arguments and the 
only reason was because once the

decision was going to be made, it's 
going to be made, right?  And we were 
going with it.  Now, if I didn't

Well, with the 400th anniversary and

all of the meaning of that, this was 
the time to be there.  And we

would happen?

they swam all the time, right?  It 
was just natural.  They almost swam  
01:14:50 
like fish--they're used to it.  Most 
black people don't swim at all, much 
less swam in the ocean, so what they 
would do is to create like a net, 
like a human net, and then as you 
walked forward they would go deeper, 
walk forward into it, they'd go 
deeper, right?  Walk forward in, 
they'd go deeper.  Now, we would have 
really been in trouble on the big  
01:15:21 
one.  I was leading it, Fred 
Shuttlesworth came out from nowhere 
and joined me and Fred said "Can you 
swim?" out the side of his mouth.  He 
said "Can you swim?"  I said, "Yeah, 
but not in an ocean," the idea being, 
these guys are going to take you out 
in the ocean, right?  So Fred 
couldn't swim, right?  But he wanted-
-he said, well, let's go in at an  
01:15:53 
angle.  I said Fred, this is the 
ocean--go in at an angle.  And these 
guys know what I was saying, right--

all they'd do is move over a step.  
You're talking about going in at an  
01:16:07 
angle.  But he came on and we got out 
to about here, and one of their guys 
jumped too soon, because they were 
going to take us out to our neck, 
which you can do in St. Augustine--
you can walk straight out up to your 
neck in St. Augustine.  That's why I 
love the beach out there.  But a guy 
moved and he moved too soon and then 
all of them, they disconnected their  
01:16:38 
hands and they jumped, and that 
really saved us, actually.  A guy 
jumped on top of me, however, and 
wow, took me right to the bottom, and 
he's on top of me.  Well, as I said, 
I can't swim in an ocean, right?  I 
used to teach at the YMCA in a pool, 
but I didn't do it in the ocean, and 
my face was in the sand and I said--
and I laughed to myself.  I said,  
01:17:11 
"this is it," and I figured this was 
it, this was over, I knew I wasn't 
going to get out from underneath this

guy, right, and my face was already 
in the sand so what, right?  And  
01:17:22 
right after that there was a jerk, a 
phew--I shot straight to the top.  A 
policeman had come over and jerked 
this guy off of me.  I didn't see any 
police and there was a picture that 
shows a policeman but that's an after 
shot, because there weren't any 
policemen when we started in, and 
there were two guys way over to the 
side and I know they couldn't have  
01:17:49 
gotten there, two policemen way over 
on the side, and almost--it was yards 
and yards, like 100 yards away from 
us, and that's about right, about 100 
yards away, and I knew they couldn't 
have gotten there that quickly.  But 
the guy who was a policeman, he 
pulled the guy off of me, I shot to 
the surface and then he started to 
arrest me.  And I said, you don't  
01:18:22 
arrest me.  I said, he's the guy that 
jumped on me.  I got a right to be on 
this ocean.  And he looked back and

the policeman was caught between and 
he was afraid to go get him because 
he was still thinking about what I 
said, and then he decided that I was 
right, so he was very nice from that 
time on.  He took me out to the beach 
and got me towels and everything.  He 
was very nice then.  And that's 
another thing I found, that the jail 
was horrible--in fact, when I looked—  
01:19:08 
INTERVIEWER:  The jail in St. 
Augustine?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, the jail in 
St. Augustine, right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Dr. King said that was 
one of the most violent places he was 
down there and it was not the Klan 
because it was mostly Catholic.  
That's where Hoss Manucy had like 
these posses of--  
01:19:21 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, in fact, that 
was their Klan, you know what I mean?  
Hoss Manucy was the guy.  And he had

01:20:33 
were there, what we were doing, what 
we were about.  So it worked in our 
favor.  Now, but Dorothy--by the way, 
Hosea created the midnight march.

midnight march one night, right, and

Dorothy Cotton and I were leading the 
group, and we were coming in not 
right there in the front.  It was 
around the side somehow, and the 
policeman would not let us in.

area?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Into the slave 
market area--they cut us off and 
wouldn't let us into it, right?

know--the Klan or Manucy's guys, 
right, were there waiting for us, and

they had chains and steel bars and 
all kinds of stuff.  So we stopped  
01:21:41 
there and prayed, but we couldn't 
move on and so that was the night 
that Dorothy talks about when we were 
praying and she said something and 
this guy says--or somebody prayed to 
God and says, "niggers ain't got no 
god," remember, as almost say it like 
Dorothy said it, because that stuck 
out in her mind.  But we were leading 
the march down there for one of those  
01:22:14 
midnight march nights.  I was leading 
another midnight march one night when 
about 40 of us were sent to the 
hospital.  You have that old Mexican 
kind of wall around things, and they 
would throw stuff over the walls onto 
us as we marched down the sidewalk, 
and we'd have to move over to the 
middle of the street, and those walls 
are so beautiful in the daytime, but  
01:22:48 
at night they were dangerous, man.  
They were dangerous and they would 
climb up on the walls and throw stuff

down on us, right?  And we'd have to 
go out in the street because we'd be  
01:23:01 
walking in the sidewalks.  I remember 
that night was when we went back to a 
church to recoup but I knew I 
couldn't let them--couldn't stop it 
because here again, we won't let 
violence stop nonviolence.  And so 
once it gave people time to get 
themselves together, and I gave 
another speech and there was another 
guy with me from movement, and I gave  
01:23:38 
him a speech and said whether anybody 
goes or not, I'm going, and I stepped 
off this little platform and started 
down the aisle and I didn't know 
whether they were coming or not.  
It's one of those nights you don't 
really know, but you know the only 
way you're going to find out is 
you've got to go, and so I started 
walking down the aisle, I got about  
01:24:03 
halfway there and I saw them look 
behind me and they were coming out 
the aisles and joining in to walk on

out.  And I remember a woman sort of 
getting up, unclear whether she  
01:24:16 
really wanted to go but she had made 
up her mind she was going, and she 
walked to the center aisle and came 
on out, too, and down the street we 
went.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  This is St. Augustine--
it's a movement that not even a lot 
of people even know about because it 
was overshadowed by national events--  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Precisely.  
01:24:35 
INTERVIEWER:  But it was to keep the 
issue of racial discrimination and 
violence alive in the country because 
even at that point there were some 
people saying we don't really need 
the civil rights bill because that's 
a thing of the past.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's it.  
Precisely, and we were saying that 
all of those are southern excuses not  
01:24:53 
to pass the bill, and we have to show 
that the south is wherever you go 
like this, like it was in Birmingham,

about 15 minutes until midnight, 20 
minutes from midnight and then the 
bell, the midnight bell would go on 
the church tower, and--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, the Episcopal 
church was right there next to the 
slave auction.  
01:25:27

we would march through it and there 
could be all these guys waiting to do 
you in because they were trying to

time.  After St. Augustine, the great 
landmark passage of the civil rights 
bill which not only desegregates the 
south but it also provides for equal  
01:26:12 
employment, not just for black and

REVEREND VIVIAN:  Precisely.  Well, 
Martin had pretty much made up his

because it was necessary, you see 
what I mean?  But what I really went 
in there for is to see how well they  
01:26:54 
were prepared for it and to get an 
invitation from them.  See, remember 
SNCC was just leaving, you get my 
point?  SNCC had not pulled it, but I 
think it was a difference in 
strategies.  See, SNCC was not trying 
for a bill.  What the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee 
was, you come to a town and you set 
up and you prepare those people and  
01:27:19 
keep them struggling and keep them 
fighting until their town was cleaned 
up.

you're not just dealing with the 
town.  You're dealing with all those 
surrounding counties, you see what I 
mean?  And black people were coming 
in from those counties into Selma.  
Now, for the action--now, there's a 
woman that's written a book about 
that.  Her name is--it starts with an 
F.  She teaches black studies at the  
01:27:55 
University of Tennessee--Flemings is 
her name, right?  She's supposed to 
be doing a book on me--she's been 
doing it for two years.  But the 
point is--well I mean, she's had real 
reasons for not finishing it, because 
there wasn't that much--she writes 
small books but they're very good 
books.  And this last book she's 
written is Selma and the surrounding  
01:28:20 
counties.

oh, there are a couple things you  
01:28:32 
should know in St. Augustine.  I 
don't know whether you know or not, 
but they're very important--we were 
going to have a meeting with a state 
congressperson who ran a real estate 
office downtown.  Martin had said 
that we should all be talking to each 
other.  It was a part of trying to 
create some real relationships.  This 
guy said--and everybody was saying  
01:29:06 
no, and the white people, we didn't 
want to talk to them, but this guy 
did and he said so in the paper and 
that we would have a meeting at 2 
o'clock at his office or 3 o'clock at 
his office or whatever it was.  And 
when we got there, his windows were 
knocked out, and we went in and you 
could tell the guy had been crying.  
They had gotten there early, and  
01:29:36 
intimidated him out of his mind.  He 
was afraid of everything.  I've 
always wanted to know--never have

interesting--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Just for dialogue.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, that's right, 
that would be a thing to know.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So we don't have much 
time left.  We're going to have to 
skip for a couple of things.  I 
wanted to ask you about two things--
the decision to go north, to have a  
01:30:04 
Chicago movement was very 
controversial within SCLC.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, that's it--
within the whole organization. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  And how did you feel 
about it within the whole movement?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That was one of 
those things that it was so 
controversial--I didn't care.  I was 
going either way.  But I was on the  
01:30:20 
edge of leaving--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  So when we really--

and this is one of the reasons I 
wasn't arguing it, you get my point?   
01:30:29 
Because I had create upward bound, 
right?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  And now I got a 
call for Jim Morton, New York, and it 
was starting the urban training 
center in Chicago and they wanted me 
on staff.  Well, I had come to the 
conclusion that when we won Selma, 
and we'd won it at that time, right,  
01:30:52 
that that was it.  I woke up one 
morning saying to myself, this is the 
end of the line.  What we have to do 
is to train the guys in the locals--
in other words, we've got the big 
picture nationally.  Now what we have 
to do is to go into the locals and 
make certain that this is pinned 
down, right?  Then I was walking 
around for a day or so and thinking  
01:31:27 
about it, and I had to go make some 
speeches across in Indiana, across 
the Midwest but mainly Indiana, and

Jim Morton had called me right before 
I left.  I guess all this was  
01:31:45 
happening about a week because I know 
that I had woken up thinking about 
it, but I was wondering how I was 
going to get it done.  In other 
words, how are we going to make all 
these little towns--well, all these 
cities, really.  There were no little 
towns we were in, and so I got this 
call from a guy named Jim Morton, 
right?  Well, I didn't know Jim at  
01:32:09 
the time.  He would later become 
dean--Mr. Jim Morton later became 
dean of Saint John the Divine in New 
York, and stayed there for about 25, 
30 years.  Now has another kind of 
thing going in New York.  So he said, 
Vivian, we're starting an urban 
training center.  Well, I knew what 
the urban training center was, I knew 
why it existed, right?  He said we  
01:32:34 
want you to come and take the Ford 
Fellowship program and you can bring 
who you want for urban training.  I

woke up thinking about it, I wasn't  
01:32:50 
dreaming it.  I woke up saying it to 
myself, right?  But I was trying to 
decide, how are you going to get that 
done, right?  I'm facing something 
like that now, I've got an 
educational program I'm working on, 
and so Jim called, an urban training 
center he was telling me about, and I 
was driving across Indiana I made my 
mind--hey, what are you waiting for,  
01:33:14 
Vivian?  That's the answer to your 
question.  So I had a guy stop--a guy 
was driving me and had him just stop 
on the corner where there was a 
filling station and a telephone.  
Remember, they used to all be out 
there--we hardly have any telephones 
around anymore.  And so, I called Jim 
and Jim--I told him yeah, I'm coming, 
and Jim said, "wow."  
01:33:41 
INTERVIEWER:  So you started a new 
career--

there in Birmingham with--who was the 
woman that was a great lawyer for 
NAACP, a woman and she became mayor 
of Manhattan later on?  Anyway, she's 
quite a--and I was there when the 
news came.  We were eating breakfast

he was coming, coming through--see,

because it started in Tennessee.

because that was in '63, the final 
comments.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Because SNCC was always 
divided to some degree between--as 
you put it, the by any means 
necessary, and there was a religious

part of it.

of it until they threw him out.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.  
01:36:36 
INTERVIEWER:  But then Black Power 
comes about in the summer of '66 by 
people who have been nonviolent for 
many years.  Some of them just got 
tired of it, some of them never 
believed in it, certainly religiously 
and everything.  How do you see it in 
retrospect, the split between the 
people who stayed with nonviolence 
and the people who abandoned  
01:36:59 
nonviolence?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Well, I think it 
became very clear that the people who 
stayed with nonviolence won.  Just 
that simple.  The people--when you 
ask, my way of asking is, who did 
what?  Finally, in the final 
analysis--not who did what in that 
moment.  Who made what happen?  What 
did they do?  Like anybody says to  
01:37:27 
me, Malcolm or Martin?  And I did 
that one thing in a conference, 
right?  Tell me, what did Malcolm do?

And they all backed off, right?  The 
same thing here--the by any means  
01:37:44 
necessary folk, in other words, what 
did they do?  What did they get 
accomplished?  In fact, SNCC ended up 
without having students.  They were 
not nonviolent, and they were no 
longer a committee.  But largely 
because they didn't have a base, you 
see what I mean?  SCLC only remains 
now because it had the church as a 
base.  It had a base that was  
01:38:16 
important, right?  In fact, there's 
no reason for SCLC to still be alive, 
truthfully, but because of the church 
they stayed alive in language and 
etcetera, right?  Now, so that when 
you had guys like Foreman [phonetic] 
talking about "we'll kick the legs 
out from under you," they wanted him 
to try it.  They just wanted an 
excuse to kill him.  That was always  
01:38:53 
the truth with everything, right?  
But they didn't even think he was 
important enough to kill.  You see,

people.  They only kill the ones that 
will make the difference, right?  The

play with, and that's the way I see 
most such movements.

stands out about your--I mean, he's 
going through a lot.  He's always 
expecting to be killed.  Did you have 
any personal moments with him, or 
what sticks out in your memory about 
the course of life or a reflective--I 
know you talked once about, you gave 
him the news that Vernon Johns had 
died, that at one point he told you 
that you didn't--he asked you, did  
01:40:01 
you think he knew what he was talking 
about when he was talking about the 
Vietnam War.  So you had some

after he won in Selma, in--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Montgomery.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  In Montgomery, when 
he won in Montgomery, right--he was 
getting an honorary doctorate from 
Fisk and I went out to cover him 
because I was an editor of the Sun  
01:40:35 
school publishing part, right?  And I 
did a 24-page piece on him of which 
that was one of the pieces, and the 
rest of it was various articles that 
he had done and copy under pictures 
about Montgomery.  That was the first 
one that we talked things out right 
there following on Fisk campus, 
following the Fisk thing.  He and I 
met on the Fisk campus and had a  
01:41:12 
conversation.  That's when I knew 
that he was the man he should be.  
That's when I knew, because I'd

action, get my point?  And to me, I  
01:41:25 
was finding out whether he can go 
weather the storm beyond Montgomery 
and I came to the conclusion that he 
not only could but he was the ideal 
person for us, just like Obama 
suddenly becomes a genius and steps 
out from nowhere, right, and becomes 
president.  Martin was the first of 
these and I call him the prophet of 
our age--line after line talking and  
01:41:56 
reading, Martin stands out.  Martin 
said violence creates more problems 
than it solves, right?  That was in 
that first speech and I thought this 
man is, you know, guided, right?  And 
I was beating out against a 
background of nine years before, nine 
and ten years before, because there 
were those years when he was doing 
movement in the north, right?  This  
01:42:28 
is the spiritual insight, the 
religious insight.  This is the

01:43:35 
and so the fellow was showing him the 
race horse and he said, now, let me 
show you this horse.  He says boy, 
this horse is quite a horse.  He says 
he used to this and he used to that, 
right, so Martin--or the guy in 
Martin's story says, well, show me 
another one.  And he says, well,  
here is a horse--look at him, see how 
sleek he is, he's going to be a great

out of Martin that I always

INTERVIEWER:  Ab meaning Abernathy.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Abernathy, yeah.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  You all called him Ab.  
01:45:25 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, that's right-
-Ab could have been the leader.  I 
don't know whether I mentioned that 
today or not.  Ab could have been the 
leader, and in a time when black 
people--as we used to say, the only 
board you could serve on if you were 
black was the deacon board.  Here was 
the biggest thing in the nation, Ab 
could have been it because he had all  
01:45:54 
the connections but he refused to do 
it and gave it to Martin.  The other 
thing that stands out like that was

that everybody--I mean, most of the 
people that surrounded him were older  
01:46:09 
than he.  But it didn't get in their 
way because they knew how bright he 
was, and his leadership abilities 
were far beyond anybody else in the 
group, and if you notice, when Martin 
left, it was all over, because he was 
the only one that could hold 
everybody together.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  He had all those big 
egos and personalities and it didn't  
01:46:35 
bother him.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  It didn't bother 
him a bit.  And it wasn't because 
they didn't have any place else to 
go--they didn't, but that was not 
Martin's reason.  Martin knew their 
talents, saw them and understood, 
with these we can move, and made it 
happen anyway.  Ab also, when we're 
speaking of people surrounding him,  
01:47:01 
Ab was also his--here's where we get 
to some of those words that we don't 
mention in public, but he was a guy

that used to be a very popular word, 
but he was Ab settled everything that  
01:47:21 
Martin, so Martin wouldn't have to 
settle anything that he didn't want 
and they didn't see that Martin 
should settle, they settled.  And 
it's those--a memory of Martin that 
is always with me when I think like 
this is that we would have a party 
out to his house occasionally and 
we'd always end it with singing and I 
can see Martin now sort of rocking  
01:47:57 
back and forth on his heels singing 
“There Is a Balm in Gilead.”  And I 
can see him now.  I mean, it was just 
a wonderful kind of thing, the depth 
of this guy, something that should be 
known.  He started a philosophical 
organization when he was a senior--I 
think it was when he was a junior at 
Boston U.  He was always there 
thinking.  When you saw Martin, you  
01:48:37 
always know he's thinking.  The thing 
that stood out for me with Martin 
always is that Martin understood

timing.  That's a thing that stood 
out for me with Martin.  He  
01:48:50 
understood timing.  He was never 
pushed into anything.  He never had 
to back up on anything.  He always 
understood timing, when to move, when 
not to move, right?  When to say 
things and when to later say them.  
And that's basic to his leadership.  
I was trying to think of some other 
kinds of things that would come right 
quick, right?

01:49:46 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  When you rise to 
greatness--no, I don't see it--only 
one thing sticks out for me, that I 
want to keep on fighting this 
struggle until I am no longer here.  
The idea is, and I'm sort of using 
this, is that a great movement, a 
great people's movement, it's 
necessary to have it followed with 
the multiplicity of minor but  
01:50:23 
important issues, okay?  So the 
movement goes on, and you're moving 
but on a multiplicity of fronts, now, 
not on one big front, and I think 
people's movements make that 
necessary, that all of that is 
necessary.  You've got to put it 
together.  I'm trying to put together 
an organization right now and I'll 
give you an idea of why I'm doing it  
01:50:54 
and I'll say it right quick, right?  
I want to see that we create up to a 
million black people a year that pass

the ACT test at a high level.  We've 
got a method to do it right now,  
01:51:18 
doing it all right, just sent a girl 
to Princeton that is--you can only 
get a 36; she's got a 32.  She's at 
Harvard level.  The point is, it's 
because given the global world in 
which we live, what we have known as 
good is not good enough.  And I think 
that we will be right back as 
janitors of the world if we do not 
solve this problem.  I think it's the  
01:51:50 
saving problem.  I've come to the 
conclusion that following freedom 
always, it has to have education.  
Education must always follow freedom.  
Whatever degree of which you gain 
freedom, it has to be followed with a 
greater degree of education.

place to leave it.

FEMALE VOICE 1:  Can you tell that 
story?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Oh, yeah, I know.  
He knows it, but let’s just tell it 
so that you've got it on tape.  The 
ministers had already decided that 
they were going to let out church at 
a certain time and that all the  
01:52:40 
church members were going to march 
over to the jail, right?  When they 
got there, and they did it with all 
their--to sing to their children, 
right?  And when they got there, and 
they didn't undress or redress or 
anything--just right coming out of 
church, and when they got there, 
there was a line of hoses, firemen 
with hoses there, and what's his  
01:53:12 
name, the sheriff--  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Bull Connor.

there, and when the people came up, 
he said "turn on the hoses, turn on  
01:53:22 
the hoses."  And they looked at him, 
and his people looked at him--they 
were down on his knees with the 
hoses, but they looked at him as 
though, what are you talking about?  
The people prayed and when they got 
up is when he said turn on the hoses, 
and people of god were there.  The 
hoses didn't turn on.  The firemen 
got up and walked away and the people  
01:53:50 
of god walked forward and they sang 
the songs of Zion to their children 
in the jail.

one that got down and started the 
prayers.  Billups was a friend of

INTERVIEWER:  Not many people know 
him.  Could you just mention a word 
about Billups and we'll stop?  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Charles Billups was his 
name.  
 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  That's exactly 
right.  Let me give you Billups--
Billups was a perfectly dressed guy 
all the time, very thin kind of guy,  
01:54:40 
and he was always immaculate, right?  
Billups could sell anything, and 
Billups loved the movement.  He'd 
been waiting for something like this.  
He'd been in the army.  He knew about 
explosives and all that sort of 
thing, but he was really taken in by 
nonviolence and understanding it and 
moving with it.  He saw it as the 
answer.  Billups was so good that he  
01:55:12 
would spend all his time in the 
movement until the last couple weeks 
when he had to turn in all of his

sales and stuff--we worked for two 
weeks and had more to turn in than  
01:55:23 
the other guys working for six to 
eight weeks.  He was that kind of 
person.  Billups was beaten--one of 
these little filling stations, there 
were always Klans around them because 
they were all part of the same stuff, 
and they followed Billups one night 
as he was going home out a road.  And 
they cut him off, they tied him to a 
tree and beat him until he just fell,  
01:56:01 
right?  But in the process, after he 
laid there for about a half hour or 
so, he thought--right, that's the way 
he tells it, and Jim Lawson has 
written this story up for one of the 
magazines, by the way, some time ago.  
And Billups lay there and he came to 
the conclusion, he said, because we 
talked about it--he said he came to 
the conclusion that--it was right off  
01:56:32 
the highway or a road, a two lane 
road, and he decided that if he could 
get to the road, maybe a car would

crawled out of there until he got  
01:56:54 
over to the road, saw a car coming, 
and he tried to wave it down and it 
didn't stop, and the next one he went 
right out on--he crawled right out on 
the road.  He said I'm going to die 
anyway.  Maybe it will stop them and 
maybe they'll take me to the hospital 
and he's on a road that didn't 
necessary have all that kindness in 
it for anybody black, but he did and  
01:57:25 
the people put him in the car and 
took him to the hospital and saved 
his life.  Billups was that kind of 
person.  Billups followed the 
movement to Chicago, and he worked 
for one of the stores for a while.  
They gave him a five-year pin and he 
hadn't been there but a year.

there.  
01:57:58 
REVEREND VIVIAN:  Yeah, just one more 
line on this--when Martin was shot, I 
heard it on the way home on the way 
to my house coming from downtown 
outer drive in Chicago, and so as I 
entered the house, the wife said "Are 
you going?"  Split level going up to 
the side, and she was over there and 
while I was packing Billups comes 
over and Billups says, "Are you  
01:58:30 
going?" and I nodded my head, and he 
said "Wait for me."  Now, the rest of 
the Billups part of this story, we 
get out to airport and the plane is 
coming in with the band, with the bed 
basket band, and so we stand there 
and talk until we have to go to the 
plane, right, and when we get to the 
motel we go out and pick out the 
casket, really.  Guys--they weren't  
01:59:07 
waiting for us, they just, we 
happened to--we were trying to get to
