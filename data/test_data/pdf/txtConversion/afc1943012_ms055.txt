Dear Dr. Botkin:
In answer to your letter of September 23rd regarding plain discs and cutting needles, it
was my impression that all of the discs were used either by Lewis Jones or by Mr. James.
Of course there were some discs that were either used for try-outs or were discarded for
one reason or another. I know we turned over to Mr. James when he arrived here in June
at least ten discs left over from the time of Lewis Jones' visit. In addition, we supplied Mr.
James with fifty cheaper discs bought commercially, twenty-five of which I know were used
by him.
As to the needles, I have no record of them since Lewis Jones was here. I had thought he
took the needles with him as I understand that he was to do other recordings before he
returned to Washington.
I am writing to him to inquire about this but I am uncertain as to his present address. I will
let you know more when I hear from him.
With best wishes, I am
Sincerely, H M Bond H. M. Bond President
