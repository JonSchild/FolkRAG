Dear Bess:
 
Please  forgive  me,
 I  am  a  perfectly  dreadful
 
correspondent  since  I have  been  split  into  fourteen
 
different  people  in  this  new  role  as  Chairman  of  the
 
Endowment.
 You are on my mind weekly because what you
 
established here at the NEA with regard to traditional
 
arts  in this country is truly exemplary and important.
 
I see the results manifested everywhere  I go and  I am
 
deeply grateful to you  for all that you have done  and
 
continue to do.
 
Thank you for sending your recent speech;
 it was
 
wonderful.
 When  I visited  the  Mississippi  Cultural
 
Crossroads recently,  I was overwhelmed by the beautiful
 
quilts, and most of all by the work of Hystercine Rankin,
 
and made sure that I had one of her fine creations before
 
I left  so  that  I would  remember  her  and  the  room  of
 
quilts always.
 
I was also pleased to be able to see Alan's Global
 
Jukebox  in  late November.
 It  certainly  is  a stunning
 
program that I will continue to support in any way that
 
we can.
 
Thank you for your offer of help.
 You can be sure
 
I will  take  you  up  on  it  when  the  right  thing  comes
 
along.
 
JA/ig
 
With admiration,  I am
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Ethel and Martin,
 
I read with interest the article  in the winter edition of NEW
 
ROUTES on the Brooklyn Arab Community of South Ferry.  It
 
called up some old memories.
 
From 1943 to 1946,  in my green salad days,  I worked at the
 
Music Division of the Office of War Information in New York
 
City.  Direct broadcasts out of that crazy office were beamed
 
into the European and African war theaters;  (a similar set-up
 
in San Francisco took care of the Pacific and the Far East)
 
But along with direct  short-wave transmissions,  we were also
 
charged with providing programs that could be broadcast over
 
more normal "long-wave" transmitters by radio stations closer
 
to the action,  for such reception was  infinitely better.  So
 
another part of our work was to arrange for the shipment of
 
pre-recorded materials -
 mostly informational and
 
entertainment programs -
 to national and local broadcasting
 
set-ups all over such parts of Europe and Africa as weren't
 
actually in flames.
 
But then as the war blazed on,  first the enormous German
 
commercial recording industry in Berlin that had distributed
 
so much of the worlds'  music to the world,  closed down,  after
 
transferring their offices and factories at the last moment
 
to hastily improvised facilities  in Athens;  and then Athens
 
fell.  Probably only a few people noticed it much at the time,
 
but all of a sudden,  there were no record pressing plants
 
functionning in Europe or Africa either;  and so if you broke
 
your favorite European-pressed 78 record,  there  just wasn't
 
another copy to be had.
 
And so one day the State Department  in Washington instructed
 
the New York OWl to get  somebody to locate as many recordings
 
as possible of Arabic music and ship them forthwith to radio
 
stations throughout the Middle East and North Africa.  It
 
appeared that hundreds of local broadcasting facilities were
 
desperately short of recordings of their own music to
 
broadcast,  and our standard shipments of recorded American
 
and European classical and jazz numbers were simply not
 
filling the bill.  As usual,  when orders came in that nobody
 
knew what to do with,  I got them;  (my office was widely
 
referred to as the  "barefoot division" because we knew a bit
 
about  folk music) .
 So at the ripe age of 22,  having never
 
ever heard a single note of Arabic music,  I set  forth on this
 
quest,  in the course of it visiting untold numbers of
 
unlikely record stores throughout greater New York,  most of
 
which had no Arabic recordings and never had wanted any
 
'
ither.
 
inally I stumbled into a place called ALANPHON;  for some
 
-eason,  though I forget many names these days,  I
' m really
 
ure of that one.  I think it was on Atlantic Avenue,  and I
 
wonder,  after reading your article,  if it could possibly have
 
ceen a predecessor of the Rashid Sales Company.  Anyway,  it
 
was a goldmine;  it was dingy and dark but it was absolutely
 
crammed with old dusty 78s and the man who came to help me
 
not only didn't think  I was crazy to want to hear Arabic
 
music,  he thought it was a right  sensible and normal thing to
 
do.  Furthermore,  he was absolutely delighted to be invited to
 
provide all the radio stations of the Arabic world with a
 
basic library of 78 r.p. m.s recorded by their own artists,
 
and I wound up giving him probably the biggest order of his
 
entire lifetime.  I had to go back several times to conclude
 
the negotiation and I vaguely recall that his name was
 
something like Mr. Aram or Mr.  Avram;  anyway it was a piece of
 
business that both of us were extremely happy about,  and I
 
remember at the end we sealed it with yet another glass of
 
tea.  It seems to me -
-
 though I am no longer sure of this -
-
that many of the records he had were re-pressings under the
 
Alamphon label,  of popular and folk music that had been
 
originally recorded in Egypt.
 
Thinking back,  the whole episode was a classic case of a
 
child's setting out to conduct grown-up business,  but so much
 
of my life has been like that,  really.  And in those days  I
 
just didn't know anybody I could ask about Arabic music;  so
 
many people were gone to the war,  Henry Cowell hadn't swum
 
into my purview at the time  (he later  joined the staff for a
 
wonderful and tragically brief period),  and there was no such
 
thing as ethnomusicology,  at least that  I knew about.
 
Anyway,  I thought you would like to know that particular
 
little story;  retelling it makes me wonder if any of those
 
shipments ever got through,  and if any of those artists Mr.
 
Aram and I picked out were really the ones people wanted to
 
hear,  and if we were actually able to help keep certain
 
musical traditions alive in the Arab world.  He and I talked
 
about that.  It's  funny how the same themes come up in a
 
person's  life again and again.  But do let me know if any of
 
this rings a bell with Mr.  Rashid.
 
Say,  what are you doing back at work?
 I thought you had
 
retired.  Retiring is awfully much like not retiring,  isn't
 
it?  I find it really hard to tell the difference,  though I do
 
let myself be a bit  lazier than  I used to -
-
 not  so many
 
people looking at me.
 
Much love to you both,

Dear Ms.  Killeen,
 
Thanbk you for sending along the  letter I wrote Huddie
 
Ledbetter in 1943.  Where on earth did you get  it?
 
I do not have any idea how you might trace the matter
 
further;  I no longer remember how or even if Huddie replied
 
to my letter nor if any of his recordings were sent to
 
Australia.  If they were,  it  is unlikely that they still
 
survive unless  somebody simply walked away with them or
 
perhaps turned them over to the US Embassy.  All OWl offices
 
were closed down at the end of the war,  I believe.  There
 
might be some record of the transaction,  if it occurred,  at
 
the Library of Congress;  you could drop Joe Hickerson a note
 
at the Folk Archive.  In any case,  even if you could follow
 
this through successfully,  all you would have found out  is
 
that  some of his recorded performances  from the LC archives
 
got to Australia and I don't know just what that would mean
 
I find myself almost bemused by your publication,  wondering
 
how so much energy and interest can be channelled into such
 
generally unpromising soil.  Certainly Huddie Leadbetter was a
 
thoroughly remarkable human being,  but  I very much doubt that
 
there is much more of importance to be  found out concerning
 
him.  He was a very private person,  to the best of my
 
recollection,  and did not  leave a plain track.  And then I
 
look at the many fine blues artists struggling to survive
 
today and wonder if anyone will ever try to work with them
 
and memorialize them as my brother and father and Pete Seeger
 
and Moses Asch and now you have done for Leadbelly.  Well,  we
 
all do what grabs hold of our imaginations,  I suppose,  and we
 
must do it as well as we can for our times.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Budd

The O.W.I. office in Australia has requested a
 
number or your recordings for their Record Library.  They
 
do not want to broadcast them; they only want them for
 
purposes of study and as the best possible examples of
 
Negro folk music of the- United States.
 
Mr. Ben Botkin, who has taken over Alan's job of
 
curator of the Archive of Ameri c
an Folk Song in the Library
 
of Congress, says that he will make copies of some of the
 
songs that you recorded for the Libraryto send to Australia,
 
but he has to have your written permission in order to do
 
s o.
F.
 
'
 •r
 i-.
 
-'
 
I thin .it would be a very good idea if you would give
 
that permission, in view of the fact that the records, as I
 
said, will, not be boadcast but will simply be made available
 
to Australians who want to learn more about Negro music in
 
the United States. - 
If yàu think this is a good idea, will you mien t
he
 
enclosed letter ar
d
 it to me.

Dear Ethel and Martin,
 
I read with interest the article  in the winter edition of NEW
 
ROUTES on the Brooklyn Arab Community of South Ferry.  It
 
called up some old memories.
 
From 1943 to 1946,  in my green salad days,  I worked at the
 
Music Division of the Office of War Information in New York
 
City.  Direct broadcasts out of that crazy office were beamed
 
into the European and African war theaters;  (a similar set-up
 
in San Francisco took care of the Pacific and the Far East)
 
But along with direct  short-wave transmissions,  we were also
 
charged with providing programs that could be broadcast over
 
more normal "long-wave" transmitters by radio stations closer
 
to the action,  for such reception was  infinitely better.  So
 
another part of our work was to arrange for the shipment of
 
pre-recorded materials -
 mostly informational and
 
entertainment programs -
 to national and local broadcasting
 
set-ups all over such parts of Europe and Africa as weren't
 
actually in flames.
 
But then as the war blazed on,  first the enormous German
 
commercial recording industry in Berlin that had distributed
 
so much of the worlds'  music to the world,  closed down,  after
 
transferring their offices and factories at the last moment
 
to hastily improvised facilities  in Athens;  and then Athens
 
fell.  Probably only a few people noticed it much at the time,
 
but all of a sudden,  there were no record pressing plants
 
functionning in Europe or Africa either;  and so if you broke
 
your favorite European-pressed 78 record,  there  just wasn't
 
another copy to be had.
 
And so one day the State Department  in Washington instructed
 
the New York OWl to get  somebody to locate as many recordings
 
as possible of Arabic music and ship them forthwith to radio
 
stations throughout the Middle East and North Africa.  It
 
appeared that hundreds of local broadcasting facilities we
 
desperately short of recordings of their own music to
 
broadcast,  and our standard shipments of recorded American
 
and European classical and jazz numbers were simply not
 
filling the bill.  As usual,  when orders came in that nobody
 
knew what to do with,  I got them;  (my office was widely
 
referred to as the "barefoot division" because we knew a bit
 
about  folk music) .
 So at the ripe age of 22,  having never
 
ever heard a single note of Arabic music,  I set  forth on this
 
quest,  in the course of it visiting untold numbers of
 
unlikely record stores throughout greater New York,  most of
 
which had no Arabic recordings and never had wanted any
 
either.
 
Finally I stumbled into a place called ALAMPHON;  for some
 
reason,  though I forget many names these days,  I' m really
 
sure of that one.  I think it was on Atlantic Avenue,  and I
 
wonder,  after reading your article,  if it could possibly have
 
been a predecessor of the Rashid Sales Company.  Anyway,  it
 
was a goldmine;  it was dingy and dark but it was absolutely
 
crammed with old dusty 78s and the man who came to help me
 
not only didn't think I was crazy to want to hear Arabic
 
music,  he thought it was a right  sensible and normal thing to
 
do.  Furthermore,  he was absolutely delighted to be invited to
 
provide all the radio stations of the Arabic world with a
 
basic library of 78 r.p. m.s recorded by their own artists,
 
and I wound up giving him probably the biggest order of his
 
entire lifetime.  I had to go back several times to conclude
 
the negotiation and I vaguely recall that his name was
 
something like Mr. Aram or Mr.  Avram;  anyway it was a piece of
 
business that both of us were extremely happy about,  and I
 
remember at the end we sealed it with yet another glass of
 
tea.  It  seems to me -
-
 though I am no longer sure of this -
-
that many of the records he had were re-pressings under the
 
Alamphon label,  of popular and folk music that had been
 
originally recorded in Egypt.
 
Thinking back,  the whole episode was a classic case of a
 
child's setting out to conduct grown-up business,  but so much
 
of my life has been like that,  really.  And in those days  I
 
just didn't know anybody I could ask about Arabic music;  so
 
many people were gone to the war,  Henry Cowell hadn't swum
 
into my purview at the time  (he later  joined the staff for a
 
wonderful and tragically brief period),  and there was no such
 
thing as ethnomusicology,  at least that  I knew about.
 
Anyway,  I thought you would like to know that particular
 
little story;  retelling it makes me wonder if any of those
 
shipments ever got through,  and if any of those artists Mr.
 
Aram and I picked out were really the ones people wanted to
 
hear,  and if we were actually able to help keep certain
 
musical traditions alive in the Arab world.  He and I talked
 
about that.  It's  funny how the same themes come up in a
 
person's  life again and again.  But do let me know if any of
 
this rings a bell with Mr.  Rashid.
 
Say,  what are you doing back at work?
 I thought you had
 
retired.  Retiring is awfully much like not  retiring,  isn
 
it?  I find it really hard to tell the difference,  though
 
let myself be a bit  lazier than  I used to -
-
 not  so many
 
people looking at me.
 
Much love to you both,
 
t

Here is the  little  speech  I wrote  for Dewey.  It  is a bit on
 
the  sentimental,  not to say sloppy side,  but  I think  (hope)
 
Dewey might  like it and birthdays are a time for sentiment,  I
 
always think.  If it embarrasses you to read,  please  just edit
 
it down;  I sometimes  find when  I look back,  that  I didn't
 
know when or where to  stop and I really do rely on editors.
 
So feel quite free.
 
I do feel really bad about not coming.  Every year seems more
 
and more  like it might be the last one really,  doesn't  it?
 
But today there  is yet another snowstorm,  with more expected,
 
and I had a hard time  just getting to the computer this
 
morning,  so I can't say the doctors aren't right,  maybe.
 
I'll hope to see you in May.  Let me know how the plans  come
 
along.  And love to all good friends
 
Affectionately,
 
Bess
 
P.S.  Please tell Becca to dance good or break a leg or have a
 
wonderful time,  whichever might be apPropriate.  .

Dear Ms Hawes:
 
Ethel Raim was kind enough to allow me to read your Feb.  1
 
letter regarding your search for Arabic music during WWII.
 
My father,  Albert Rashid established his business in 1934  in
 
Detroit,  Michigan.
 He began by importing Egyptian films and
 
the recordings of those films which were then produced in
 
Germany.
 
During WWII dad worked in the River Rouge Ford Defense plant.
 
He re-established his ties with Egypt after the war.
 I
 
remember when he went in 1945.
 He was on the maiden TWA
 
flight from Europe to N.Y.
 We still have a dollar bill that
 
was signed by the crew.
 I believe dad told us that Eleanore
 
Roosevelt was on the same flight
 
You visited the Alamphone Record Company which was then
 
located near Atlantic Avenue on Court Street.
 The proprietor
 
was Mr.  Farid Alam.
 During the war  [as you said in your
 
letter]  Germany closed its factories and all record
 
production of Arabic music stopped.
 However, Mr.  Alam
 
decided to start production here in the U.S.
 He took all of
 
the recordings of the Baidaphone and Odeon labels which
 
included most of the major Arabic recording artists and
 
duplicate them here.
 In a sense he was a record pirate.
 But
 
inadvertently,  his piracy was instrumental in keeping Arabic
 
music on the air during the war.
 
Mr.  Alam's beverage of choice was moonshine "arak".
 I
 
believe out of respect to a young "American lady" working for
 
the State Department,  he served tea.
 
Dad came to New York after the war and established his first
 
retail store on East 28th Street in Manhattan in the same
 
building as the "AL HODA" Publications
 -
 the major Arabic
 
Daily Newspaper.
 In 1947 he moved to Atlantic Ave.
 In 1948
 
Mr.  Alain moved to Atlantic Ave -
 right across the street from
 
my father's store.

Since Mr. Alam was blackballed by the producers in Egypt for
 
pirating their repertoires, he could no longer import the new
 
recordings that flooded the market after the war.
 Dad became
 
the only source for new music.
 
Mr. Alam continued to do business until he passed away in the
 
late 50s or early 60s.
 
I do remember that dad was supplying music to the Voice of
 
America right after the war.
 This continued for the duration
 
of the Voice of America's Arabic operation.
 
Ethel and Martin were so good in sharing your letter with me
 
I wanted to shed what little light I could to help complete
 
your  picture of past events.
 
Sincerely yours,
