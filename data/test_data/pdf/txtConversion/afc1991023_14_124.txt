TXO1: 000 This recording was made partly on behalf of the 
Smithsonian Institution's Office of Folklife Programs in an 
effort to audition the shanty singing of the four men who were 
formerly menhaden fishermen for the 1983 Festival of American 
Folklife. 
Shortly before the session began Robert Ames commented 
that even though they had worked on different boats they knew the 
songs because "The songs are 
in the fishermen, not in the boats." 
G—Port Norris; 38GT 
Alexander Davis, describing the daily routine: "The men get 
up at 4 o'clock and get the purse boats. 
After you get 'em 
loaded, go back to the beach, Perth Amboy, New York, get a load 
and go to Lewestown, Delaware. 
Hamon: 
but how do you make a set? 
"Captain, can you see 
that dark cloud risin' over yonder -- Lord, 
lord, sign of rain --
Oliver: But we're still getting that bunt --
032 
Ames tells his story: 
"You get up 
in the morning about 
four o'clock and you eat your breakfast -- the purse boat runner 
gets 
in the purse boats -- you throw everything outa the river 
behind the steamer (Oliver: because it can't get through the 
bridge) then the steamer stops -- then the crew all has to come 
together, because everybody has a job -- to help raise the boats 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
out of the water to put them in the hanger. 
then there's certain 
people -- The cap'n and the mate -- they go and look the water 
over for fish -- they see 'em by signs, red spots show signs, 
bubbles under water sometimes show signs -- they know 'em better 
than anybody else in the world -- when they find the right signs, 
they lay around and they watch the signs -- they study 'em and 
they watch 'em. 
and when they watch the sign and everything is 
right they holler to the men 'Load the boats! 
In the boats men!' 
so the crew had to lower the boats down in the water: "In the 
boats!" 
When they left the boat there was about three people on 
it -- cook, cap'n and mate -- Everybody else would be out in the 
purse boats -- you make a circle with the net -- and the boats 
all 
come together --
Dropping the tong (tom?) the tail 
line, or purse line -- a 
winch in the big boat. 
Then you press your rings up and the crew 
in the boat has to count your knots (in the net) -- I don't want 
to get knots on this end before the man on the other end get 
knots -- you got your knots in your hand, 
you gotta slow down 
til 
the man on the cork end gets the knots -- that makes 
everything come together -- that man standing up -- he say "Hold 
up boys! Let this man catch up -- hold up on the ring line and 
let the cork catch up." 
Oliver: If one of those fellows feels  I 
i 
ke they don't want 
to pull, 
it will be told on them, because they all got to do 
their part -- the fellows coordinate together . . . 
You got bags 
in your fishing line sometimes you --
Ames: -- gotta take a knife and cut it out --
Oliver: If you got slack it means you're not pulling with 
the rest of the men --
Ames: fish'll get in 
it and it'll get so heavy it'll make a 
pocket and then you can't pull 
it -- so you gotta take a knife 
and slit it and let the fish out -- (he illustrates by reference 
to a sheet) -- All this got to come together and neat -- when it 
comes together neat it works perfect and it'll do a good job --
but you can tie yourself up 
in a way on a fish steamer that you 
can take two hours' work and make a day's work out of 
it --
Hufford: How many new men at once? 
Ames: They try to first work them in 
in a spot where they 
won't have too much pressure until they learn this job -- Now --
the pressure where it comes in a boat mostly is 
in the cork line 
-- the people pullin' the cork -- that's where the pressure in so 
they'll break 'im 
in on the ring line -- some guys are so good 
they'll 
learn 
in one day --
Boats tipping over --
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 4 
Oh -- yeah -- they can tip over like that see -- the main 
purpose -- 16 men 
in each boat -- 32 men -- can't 
raise 80 ton 
-- there's no way in the world they can do 
it -- but they know 
how to do 
it 
in a way that sea helps you do 
it -- they know when 
the sea comes up and 
takes the net up, you gotta hold on to 
it 
-- but when the sea go down, you got slack -- the sea gives it to 
you the sea gives it to you -- sea gives it bounce to you --You 
know what they say? Say when you down in there holdin' on, they 
say, "Hold on boys," say, "Wait a minute," say, "The sea'II give 
it to you. 
After a while, she'll go down on a swell -- she'll 
lighten up." (to the others) Isn't that right? 
Alex: Mhmm -- that's what I always learned -- fish don'e run 
far off the coast --fish come 
in shore to spawn -- they have to 
rub their bellies against the sand to get in spawnin' shape --
swellin' toads'll do that -- shads'll do 
it, but a shad isn't 
nothin' but a bunker no way --
198 
You know what a shanty man is? A shanty man is just 
someone on the boat that's old and know how to make rhythm for 
you -- and make you feel good and make the work easier. 
He don't 
have to be no cap'n -- he don't have to be no mate -- he don't 
have to be nobody -- just someone with a lot of experience who 
likes to sing --. 
The Chantey men can't be picked out in the 
picture -- he ain't got no special job. 
General conversation about comparative merits of Delaware, 
Virginia, and North Carolina boys as chantey singers and leaders. 
Ames: "Boy those North Carolina boys, they can sing -- they 
can put the shanty together." 
More discussion: getting the fish dried out, having to ball 
them, "Dunkin' man!" means raise 'em up. 
The mother boat has to 
come to you. 
The striker boats are 
in a diamond shape, and while 
they're "rollin'" (the net), they're chantying: "Roll over, roll 
over, roll over!" 
249 Getting ready to sing -- a lot of talking. 
276 
Chanty: 
"I 
left my baby standing in the back door cryin' 
(twice) Said "Daddy don't go," Lord, Lord, "Daddy don't go!" 
If I can make it (indiscernible) 
I'm a goin' back home 
Lord, Lord, goin' back home --

Church on a high road 
Go down, bring me Lazarus 
Sign of rain, Lord,

G—Port Norris; 38GT They're 
fooling around singing Dixie Hummingbird songs -- Robert Lee 
Hamon has the record. 
Robert Ames launches into what he calls a 
"slave song": 
Go out and play just as much as you please 
Don't mind what the white folks say 
Just as sure as you go, they're bound to laugh at a little 
black coon like you --
So stay on this side of the high board fence 
And honey don't you cry so hard --
Go out and play just as much as you please 
But stay in your own back yard. 
Alexander: "Well I got a mulie (group) Mule on the mountain 
called Jerry (repeat) 
Ames starts to sing "Summertime" then asks "Anybody know a 
slave song? 
Mentions John Henry and the Battle Hymn of the 
Republic. 
Hamon: Church on a High Road! 
Hufford: What's that song about? 
Ames: It's about fishing, but that's not the name of 
it. 
It's 
Old Bad Lazarus." 
They start to reconstruct the story, quite 
dramatically. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

Hamon: But his mother had to come in there 
Alex: His mother, she came screamin' and cryin'

He told his mother "Don't worry, mother, because I'm bound to die 
-- You know where they found Lazarus? They found Lazarus dyin' 
between two mountains -- then his mother come screamin' and 
cryin' -- "You done killed my son" --
And I'll tell you another thing you messed up -- He was shot 
by the sheriff -- "Go bring me Lazarus, bring him dead or alive

TX01: 
Mary—Ann is asked about chiropracters in the area, and 
doesn't know much. 
TX02: Jens asks about her personal background and how it led to 
her career in environmental 
law. 
She grew up 
in the 60's, and 
majored first in journalism, then in international 
law. 
Returned 
from British Isles to Greenwich Village, 
where she became aware 
of impending developments in the Pine Barrens, and decided that, 
despite her former resolve not to go back, something needed to be 
done to protect the woods she had always taken for granted. 
Rita asks about people who sell their land to developers; 
how do local people regard them? 
M—A has a distant cousin 
responsible for "that horrible thing" Larchmont, "That's why we 
like to keep them distant." 
044 Re: G—Medford Lakes; 17GT, some retired people worked as 
carpenters on the Medford Lakes cabins. 
Jens: How did you break into environmental 
law? 
M—A: Girl Scouts was another influence on her love of 
nature, as was growing up on a farm. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
M—A's father worked at Swarthmore in addition to farming, 
his brother was married to people who worked with Dr. Elizabeth 
White. 
He rents some land to a farmer who grows soybeans, corn, 
peaches, etc. 
Near her father's farm is the ridgeline, the 
watershed responsible for the dramatic soil differences that 
allow cranberry growing on one side, and rich farm crops on the 
other. 
Their family is one of the few holdouts from the Ocean 
Spray cranberry coop, they used to belong to one called Eatmor. 
Problems w/ marketing killed the coop. 
Haines, her cousin, then 
contracted with Ocean Spray, and her father with a local canner 
in Hammonton. 
Local 
loyalties form along those lines. 
Her 
father is against monopolies. 
Sue: cranberry liqueurs? 
M—A. No, the sauce market is a 
major outlet, prices too low. 
May have to go fresh again, though 
technology doesn't permit efficient fresh harvesting. agriculture 
Drinking is a problem. 
People do make blueberry wine. 
Sue 
refers to the Frosty Bogg, a drink at Mayo's that incorporates 
cranberry liqueur. 
M—A : Well, nationally cranberry juice is 
making it 
into more bars. 
It boggles her mind that so few 
cranberries and blueberries make it onto local menus. 
foodways 
Jens: Snapper soup! 
M—A: That's regional, and there's not that much of 
it. 
Rita: Are there restaurants run by 
local folks? 
M—A. Thinks 
the Woodshed is run by a man who married local, but came from 
somewhere else. 
Mayo's is run by outsiders. 
146: 
Buzby's, New Gretna House, have some local people 
connected with them. 
Not the Butterchurn. 
Environmental 
law. Crestwood Village, a senior citizens 
village had gotten approval to dump sewerage into their reservoir 
from G—Woodland; 27GT Township, that started everybody up 
in arms. 
No one attended to the cranberry industry downstream. 
Stella Stevenson cooks for some gun clubs 
Cranberry pie, green cranberry pie, cranberry relish, among 
local 
recipes. 
Mrs. Stevenson is a good cook, lives by G—Four 
Mile Circle; 27GT. 
Seafood? 
M—A says it's important among Pineys because of 
the Mullica, clambakes held regularly, especially in G—Green Bank; 
26GT.Mrs. Green used to go to all 
of the dinners. 
726-1603. 
Crabs have spices put into them, along the shore she suspects 
it's more elaborate. Not much fish in the bogs. 
202 "Snapping turtles are a big thing. 
My father got into a 
car accident. 
He picked up this snapping turtle and he put it 
in 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 10 
the back of the car, and 
it was a hatchback, and he was driving. 
And he wanted to take it back to the guys at the bog because they 
love snapper and the turtle kept coming up, and he was trying to 
keep it 
in the back and he ran into a telephone pole. 
And then 
when he tried to explain to the state police why he hit the pole, 
and the state policeman was from Jersey City, and he couldn't 
understand why he would pick up a snapper to begin with, 
it was a 
complete cultural difference to have to explain. 
But anyway, he 
ended up with soup, he gave him to the guys. 
(The policeman gave 
him a ticket), which I thought was outrageous because if he'd 
been a piney he'd have understood the importance of getting a 
snapper. 
Jens: Other kinds of turtles? 
M—A: 
Not that she knows of. 
They're always fishing in our reservoir, so I know they're 
catching something, but Pine Barrens water's acidic, so not much 
can live 
in 
it. 
Catfish. 
Glenn Horner runs lots of people off 
the reservoir, so he might know who a good fishing contact would 
be. 
Lives off of 70 on Burrs Mill Road, the dirt road. By the 
reservoir. 
His friends are the ones that do the foxhunting. 
Jens: Subsistence or sport? 
M—A doesn't know. 
231: 
People who are gatherers and harvesters are friends of 
people who work for us. 
Mullica River is a richer source. 
Black people would do subsistence fishing. 
M—A recalls a 
fellow who brought two girlfriends with him to fish off of their 
dam. 
They'd fight while he fished. 
Rita: Did you notice changes in values when you returned 
after being away? 
273 "I think that in order to appreciate a place you have to 
see other places to know what you have. 
And 
if you've never 
really gotten away." 
Sue comments that part of maturity is going away and coming 
back and seeing the place as 
if for the first time. 
M—A thinks that while in England she learned appreciation 
for landscapes that were tiny and detailed. 
"I picked 
blueberries from the time I was old enough to get working papers 
and I really loved being there, but all my efforts at that time 
were to get out, to go somewhere, because this was supposed to be 
nowhere. 
But then when I was someplace else, I realized that it 
really was somewhere. 
The consensus was that that's a typical part of adolescence. 
She left to go to college in 1967, for University of 
Pennsylvania, and transferred 
because it was too close to home, 
then to Syracuse, Emory, Cornell, England, and then back. 
They 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 11 
were encouraged to get out and see things, which she thought was 
unusual, since her other cousins were encouraged to stay. 
(reminiscent of Birdwhistell's thesis) 
327: They used the woods G—Southampton; 23GT so much when she 
was growing up that she took them for granted. 
Went canoeing, 
and played there, had caretaker attitudes as Rita pointed out. 
M—A, we would fix up abandoned cabins and post signs warning 
people not to destroy them. 
Most of her girl scout troop 
consisted of her cousins. 
Camps: Kettle Run, Chips Folly. 
A 
group of Girl Scouts sold their camp in Jackson to Great 
Adventure, a shocking development to Switlicks (sp?) the folks 
who sold it to the Girl Scouts. 
They told lots of Jersey Devil 
stories, people in Red Lion were supposed to have seen him. 
She 
went to Holy Cross high school, not in the Pines.

Discussion re: Mary—Ann's mother, her perspectives re: 
environment as a New Yorker. 
The term "Piney" was more insulting 
when she was growing up than it 
is now. 
"My grandmother used to 
make hooked rugs and she would laugh because some guy would sell 
them in Philly or New York and say, 
'Oh the Pineys made these'. 
That was when Elizabeth Kite was around and everybody was real 
hyper. 
"At one time the governor wanted to close off the area 
because of the inbreeding." 
Rita recalls the comments of a man 
from Lakewood to her at the Smithsonian folklife festival this 
past summer, all of them derogatory. 
M—A says she wished the 
myth had persisted because then outsiders wouldn't want in. 
Rita: Who are the outsiders? 
M—A: Buzby's general store, used to be a real general store 
with general store ambience. 
People came in and tried to make it 
look like a New York deli, and did a cheap job of 
it, using fake 
butcher block, and then the people after them made it over so now 
it 
looks like a Wawa, a Seven—Eleven (for Jens's benefit). 
Sometimes local people distort things as well. 
They're still 
insiders, which makes them more dangerous. 
055: Suburbanites, they laugh at anyone, come for the 
cheaper taxes, and are upset by the lack of organized activities 
for children who don't want to pick blueberries or do what the 
other kids do, all these kids are just hanging out on the streets 
nowadays. 
"And the mayor said to me, he goes, 'Those aren't 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 13 
Piney kids wrecking your building, those are new kids moving in, 
that were never trained to live in that area, so they don't have 
anything to do but hang out." 
(Interesting concept: being 
trained to live 
in a place.) 
Taxes are cheaper here than in Medford, Mt. Laurel, Cherry 
Hill. In G—Tabernacle; 25GT taxes are rising because they've got a 
huge school there now "which they didn't need," they demand 
services and paved roads. 
Burlington city is poor. 
People in 
G—Shamong; 22GT can't wait till they get a park, till they change 
the environment to suit a city—bred person. 
Rita: You can see 
it 
in their yards, they incorporate what's 
there, they manipulate the natural environment, you won't find as 
many ? for instance, but you will find foundation plantings, 
they're decorating obviously, but they're trying to. 
Re: cheapness of Presidential Lakes, Centennial Lakes is 
expensive. 
Lebanon Lakes isn't. 
Pinelands Commission is a 
Development Commission. 
They won't spend a week with someone in 
the Pines, they'd rather commute in from the Mt. Laurel Hilton. 
114: ET: 
your awareness of the woods. M—A I regard myself 
as learning. 
I'm not a really good woodsperson yet. 
I spent 
time riding around with Ted Gordon who is a really good field 
person, and trying to learn everything from him. 
Kids growing up 
in the woods do learn some basic survival 
skills. But she doesn't notice the same consciousness that kids 
had when she was growing up. 
She has some kids working on a 
building to help restore it, The White Horse Tavern. "It's circa 
1860, an 
inn, cedar, clapboard, pine frame, the last building 
that remains of the G—Chatsworth; 27GT resort, modelled after the 
Duke of Devonshire's country estate, called Chatsworth, and 
Prince Ruspoli owned 25,000 acres of the Pines between Chatsworth 
and Warren Grove. 
The only building left is this vernacular 
structure that we put on the National Register, and the township 
was going to tear it down unless we did something to fix it up. 
Junior, the guy who used to ride around the pines he 
lived there 
and kept all the kids out of there, but when he died, they got in 
there and, they thought there was $50 hidden someplace so they 
knocked all the plaster off the walls and really wrecked it. 
So 
we had to clean it out and start trying to restore, but we keep 
having problems with vandalism. 
We got some of them to reform, 
like I got all my plywood back 
in the building that had left to 
become a fort, 
it suddenly migrated back. 
Joe Path said it's the 
most ramshackle building in Chatsworth, it's across from the fire 
station, and its one of the few buildings that hasn't burned down 
from that era. 
Right now we're trying to get the gun clubs to 
sponsor a cedar board to put back on it. 
I found that the way to 
get something like this accomplished is to go ahead and people 
will join you toward the end.

172: 
re: frustrations in dealing with Pinelands Commission, 
in October she will represent Friends of Warren Grove 
to save a 
part of the forest district that she thinks is being given away. 
Jens 
is quite curious about how she makes her livelihood, wills 
and divorces are her bread and butter. 
She 
is also trying to 
save the Forked River Mountains. 
200: Garfield DeMarco sees the Inn as a security hazard, the 
town 
is 
like a medieval fiefdom and he owns it, 
he doesn't want a 
bar next to his packing house. 
He's torn down other historic 
buildings. 
She contacted the Ruspolis in Italy. 
Jens: how do people perceive what you do? 
M—A. 
People want 
to kill you when you start something, no one 
in Chatsworth has 
lifted a finger so far, but people outside the township are 
helpful. 
The Stevensons are helping her. 
In Chatsworth Garfield 
dominates the jobs and the land, and he may decide he wants the 
land. 
248: Back to the sewarage crisis. 
The rumor mill, different 
circuits in Southampton, Tabernacle, and Chatsworth. 
Very 
complicated, 
if she wants to fight a battle on one front, she has 
to find a straw person, under cover, 
in order to protect her 
interests in the building. 
286: People come right up to her and tell her she's doing 
the wrong thing. 
More on how the Pinelands Commission hasn't 
kept its promises to farmers. 
Re: permits issued to people who want to cut cedar, they go 
onto the wrong land, and don't have any of the right forestry 
technology. 
(Check into the permit situation, are there 
guidelines? 
Is this where documentation of Frazee will 
lead to 
policy recommendations?) 
Jens cross—examining her on the local attitudes toward the 
Pinelands Commission. 
M—A thinks they care more about their careers than about the 
Pines.

011: Sound of dirt bikes with engines gunning. The place is 
called Hidden Lakes. The bikers never heard the place called The 
Clay Pits. 
The fellows are from Mount Holly. 
To get there they 
travel over 413 over the Burlington—Bristol Bridge. An hour and 
45 minutes. 
Two hondas and a suzuki among the three of them. 
There is some danger connected with the activity. 
People have 
died back there. 
They want to know how I got back there. 
They

It happens every weekend.

MH What about this business of driving four—wheel drive 
trucks into the lake? "It's a lot of fun. 
It's competition to 
see who can do 
it. 
It's just a challenge. 
Whoever has the 
highest truck, the biggest tires, usually makes it." 
The kid: (responding to the question, how can you soup up 
your vehicles?) "High performance exhaust, and the front 
suspension, that's about it." 
(What do you do to make it more 
attractive?) 
"Nothin', really, just put pads on 
it, just all 
next week we'll be washing them up so we can bring 'em down next 
sunday. 
You gotta get all the dirt out, the sand 
is what gets 
into everything, it'll 
ruin it. Wears the chains out."

from Bucks County where no places are quite as good, "More area 
(here), you can ride all 
you want without being bothered by the 
police, more people here too." 
(It's legal back here?) 
I don't 
think it's really legal, but, some guy owns this property I 
heard. He used to 
let a lot of people ride back here, but then 
his dog got shot, so he tried to chase 'em out. But they just 
keep coming back. There's really nothing you can do about it. 
Everybody calmed down after that. People try to keep it as neat 
as possible. 
073: Pause to admire a passing bronco. (What's so great 
about that?) 
High wheels. 
Keeps the water from going into the 
engine. 
Their names: Dave Densbower, Chris Loveland. 
The Lower 
Bucks ATV club (All Terrain Vehicle). 
Next setting: Near a truck blasting music by the water. 
(Earlier it was playing "There's No Way Out") 
Motors gunning = one truck trying to pull another out. 
I hail an enthusiastic bystander. "What's going on here?" 
"Pretty much everything." 
He left his truck home today. 
Everyone is trying to have fun. 
He says the turquoise section 
of the water is pretty deep. 
He'd like to come here every 
weekend. 
They're from local towns: West Creek, Bass River, no 
club. 
It's freer here than on Long Beach Island. 
You can do a 
thousand dollars worth of damage on a truck if you blow the 
motor. 
Fix up the tires, suspension, motor. 
A group of people 
favor fords. 
Watching a ford bronco, hoots and cheers, "Detroit 
at its finest. 
Two wheels, no problem...Thank you Henry J. 
That 
was pretty neat." 
People without trucks often get rides through 
with those who do. 
147: Women sometimes drive the trucks through there. 
An 
anti—foreign car sentiment: Look at that: made in Japan. 
159: Fieldworker Jay 
Orr introduces me to Nevin Ianuzzi, 
the fellow who just drove the Bronco through the mud, he and his 
wife are from Medford. 
This is his first summer at it. His 
cousin (who lost an engine in this activity) got him started. 
People also swim somewhere over the mountain, a rope swing. He 
complains about people who charge to pull you out. 
178: He goes through trails and mudholes all through the 
Pine Barrens, following trails and finding mudholes. You gotta 
waterproof your rears (the assembly that drives the wheels) keep 
distributor water—free, and air filter high as can be. 
He works 
for Court (?) Furniture Rental. 
This is my third vehicle, I 
don't worry about it. 
But that fellow in the brand new truck, 
I'm sure that's his only means of transportation, and to be out

here doin' that, I wouldn't! If I had to depend on that truck 
every day to get back and forth to work, I wouldn't do 
it. But 
some guys do. 
It's clean fun. 
I mean, you get dirty, but you 
aren't causing any harm. 
His scariest predicament: "I climbed a 
hill over there and I came down backwards between two trees and I 
had all four wheels off the ground." 
206 This place was an open strip mine, quarry, It's called 
Hidden Lakes. This is the first one, there's another over there, 
but they closed the third one up because a guy got hurt diving 
off of a cliff. 
Now they chase people out, they got a guy that 
watches the place. 
See, there's somebody out there to the 
rescue. 
That's a big thing to cross the lake. 
It's more or less you 
gotta know where the path is. 
Trucks with big wheels change the 
terrain of the lake. 
Advantages of moderately sized wheels. It's 
like this every weekend. 
Wettin' out your distributor and small 
tires are the biggest hazard. 
Peterson's Four Wheel Drive 
Magazine sells in most newstands. 
He paid $450 for his vehicle 
when he got it. 
People sometimes name their vehicles: High Wheeler; Swamp 
Fox; Dirty, Mean and Nasty over there, that's what it says on its 
door. 
People don't try stunts except: Dune buggies will fly up 
the hills and have all four wheels off the ground. 
He's been 
coming here since 1978. 
People come here from Lancaster. 
People 
get stuck sometimes in 
"All Nighter Holes" that keep them there 
until midnight. 
Jay: asks him about being upside down, that is one of the 
scary parts. 
One fellow hit a washout when he had his door open, 
and was thrown from the truck. There's several clubs: the Mick 
Mob Club, the Pine Barrens Club, they usually get together at the 
bar on 206. 
Sometimes they work with local police to 
locate 
missing people. 
He got started when he accompanied his cousin 
who was baitin' for deer in his four—wheel drive truck. 
341: People get caked with mud from head to toe, when they 
get out to hook up a line to the other trucks. 
Motorcyle run, a fund drive for Deborah Hospital. 
Different 
check points. 
It's good to come early in the morning so you can 
see where the ruts are. 
Competition: there's more or less hell 
raisin between the 
different brands of trucks: Chevy, Ford etc.

001: Bob York identifies the place as G—Hidden Lakes; 27GT in 
Washington Township. The scene has shifted to another part of the 
lake because a guy 
is stuck 
in a jeep and people are watching 
people help to pull him out. York tells the story of how his 
girlfriend's father was hurt by the moratorium, he wanted to 
develop it 
into 5 or 6 acre per unit development. 
He was a 
broken man because of that.

Suddenly they're saying, everybody owns it, 
you can't do 
anything with it. Some kind of injustice. 
"Especially in my 
personal case where, I said, my girlfriend's father, Don Bragg. 
was Olympic gold medalist, he represented his country and he 
comes along, the country does him an injustice and 
it totally 
breaks him, you know?" 
Jay: what is 
it that you find so appealing out here? 
Bob: Oh, 
it's virgin wilderness, you know, there's wildlife 
out here, this 
is 
it. 
Everyone here pretty much respects it, 
it's recreation. 
You can't have fun like this on a city street."

He's been living in West Creek for 12 years.

He went to Southern Regional High School, graduated in 
1979. 
All generations come, he said. 
He goes to places in G—Bass

to having every been lost. 
082: Is aware of most of the places, such as Apple Pie Hill 
and Petticoat Hill. 
He deer hunts, not as part of a club. He 
claims to fish and clam along the bays, mudflats, sandbars.

Old timers around who'd be willing to talk? 
Best 
place to go, along the Mullica river, Green Bank, other ports of 
entry for early settlers were Lower Bank, New Gretna. 
117: This is what people in his age—group do for fun. 
He's 
a landscape architect. 
Jay asked about the use of native plants 
in his landscaping. 
Sometimes he uses inkberry holly, 
ilex 
glabra, and could use Mountain Laurel. (Doesn't seem to know 
sheep laurel, never heard of bearberry).

120: 
Says you need a movie camera to do this event justice. 
Movement is what it's about. 
He doesn't have his truck here this 
weekend because he's got it home where he's working on 
it. 
Pause while we watch. Then "If this was a housing 
development nobody would be having this much fun doin' somethin' 
this safe, 
it would be more like burning down houses or breaking 
windows. 
Here there's nobody getting hurt. 
Everybody's out here 
to meet everybody else and have fun." 
How do they help each 
other? 
"Pullin' each other out." 
Another voice: (Rob Stanley) 
"That guy there, he's pullin' the other guy out, he might never 
have met him before." 
"It's too bad countries don't work the 
same way." 
They often wave to four—wheel drivers, more so than just to 
other drivers they encounter on the road. 
"It's just somethin' 
that brings people together. 
They might not get along or 
anything." 
People come from all over, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
40-50 miles away. 
Jay and I walk down to the pit. 
We watch as a truck that is 
3/4 of the way through the rut gets pulled out for the third 
time. 
Bob says he won't make it a fourth time. 
The problem is 
that his tires are too short. 
Driving a Chief Cherokee. 
People 
race dirt bikes, sponsored by clubs. 
The guy would have to go 
faster, but he's got water in his motor, and he'd probably ruin 
the truck. 
To maintain the trucks you have to have a slot in the 
door that says "insert paycheck." 
He's still paying off the 
$7,000 he borrowed in 1980 to buy the truck.

Next interview. 
I called Jay over to talk with two fellows who were admiring 
the antics of a young fellow on a three wheeler. 
He was turning 
and sliding and splashing mud all 
over the bystanders, and over 
the truck that was stuck in the center. 
The ignominious part of 
getting stuck is that you get mud flung all over you by youths 
such as he. 
The fellows camp out. 
A huge whoop went up as the 
crowd applauded the kid for making it through. 
"He don't stop 
either, he goes all 
day." 
" ? 
is really excellent." "Look, 
there he goes again." 
"Uh—oh. 
He just put it in reverse. He's 
poppin' reverse, watch. 
Ah, he's stuck. 
That kid's still 
shooting mud all over him! 
Get im!" 
"Look! He went all the way 
back 
in reverse!" 
They sometimes camp out all weekend. 
They 
need trash cans back here, but at least, they pointed out, they 
pile all 
the bottles in one spot. 
"Some people just don't care 
about money! 
Tear it up! 
They don't care at all!" 
264: Do some people ride through there as sort of a 
challenge to all takers? 
"One guy goes through and that's what 
starts it. 
Somebody else says, 
'I 
can make that' and it gets 
deeper and deeper." 
"Look! He made it! 
Go try it!" 
The tape gets fuzzy here. 
Somebody belches into the mike at 
one point. 
Great ambient sound.

Back to Rob, 
interviewed by Jay. 
He 
is 21, and about 
to join the Marines. 
He points out that there are other things 
to do 
in the Pines, such as hiking and canoeing. 
The fellow in 
the Toyota is trying to make it through now, though its 38 inch 
tires are going to be rough on 
its 4 cylinder motor.

TX01: Jack has seen many a pit of charcoal, hasn't seen one now 
for 25 years, however, not since the 1950s. 
Ann remembers where 
the pits were 
in Old Hanover, Buckingham, near where the old man 
lived, he had a charcoal pit. 
Along the banks of Little Crick 
(the Rancocas Crick) up above Browns Mill 
lake. G—Browns Mills; 
21GT 
Ann went the same school as Jack, after him. 
She was born 
in Riverside, above Burlington, on the Delaware River. 
When her 
father died, her mother remarried and moved to Magnolia. 
He was 
killed while crossing the railroad tracks on his way to work. 
It 
was such a sudden thing. 
She was two years old then. 
Now she's 
bordering on 80, as of the 27th of November. 
Next week is their 
51st anniversary. 
Last year they had their golden anniversary 
party, a lovely party. 
Absolutely perfect. 
(Too much 
interference from the fan). 
They often went to the cabin at 
Chatsworth with kids and grandchildren. 
Many of them were there 
for the anniversary. 
When they were growing up, I lived in the 
woods. 
We'd go up to the cabin and we'd walk around through the 
woods, and things you could never forget, seein' animals. 
(I'm 
turning the fans off here). 
We'd get up, and my grandchildren 
would come up on Friday and say, "Grandmom, let's go up to the 
cabin. So I'd go shopping, not knowing how many I was going to 
have, because they'd bring their friends up." 
family, history 
Now we can hear crickets and traffic. 
"I always liked the 
woods. 
From Magnolia we went to G—Whitesbog; 21GT, Papa got a job 
there, and I was eight. 
The woods was my playground for years. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 22 
I had a lot of brothers, and I went around with them fishing and 
playing ball, and I learned the woods. 
When I got fourteen or 
fifteen was when Miss White started the blueberries and I went in 
the woods with her to dig up plants to help her, and we made 
cuttings out of roots of those new bushes that she would dig up 
and we went on til 
it was a big development of a green house, and 
I did hand pollinating and we would cover them with a screen so 
that nothing else could get to the buds or the flowers or the 
blueberries after we had pollinated them with what we wanted them 
mixed with, and we'd watch them, and then when they bore fruit, 
we would pick the berries and take em and wash the seeds and then 
plant em. 
I worked with my father on the cranberries. 
Jack came 
up and would work, they'd give out tickets, where they'd scoop a 
bushel. 
Then I started to go gunnin when Jack and I were 
married. 
And I took my grandson huntin, and some of the other 
kids would come along and he took his dog. 
Then we went deer 
hunting and they just loved to be out in the woods learning about 
the different animals and plants. And I wouldn't know about the 
plants. My mother couldn't understand why I wanted to go gunning. 
But I would go up 
into the woods and set there by myself, 
(giggles) and listen to the squirrels cussing me out, and the 
bluejays, and you get in where they are, they don't like you to 
interrupt what they're doing. 
You can go and see some plan and 
til 
they find you there they're just unconcerned, but when they 
find you, boy oh boy. 
You'd be surprised how they chatter, and 
the bluejays'II see you and they'll go up and down the woods and 
the road hollerin', and I said they're just tellin' everybody 
else that somebody's here. 
I believe that that's what it was. 
And a deer could come along, and the squirrels and the bluejays 
would tell him, don't go any further, 
that's what it sounded 
like to me! 
And off they would run. 
It's really amazing the 
things that you see and hear off 
in the woods. 
141: Any other women like to go gunning? 
Johnny Earlin's 
wife did for a couple of years, but she never was 
in the woods, 
only with Johnny. sex roles 
Ann went off on her own, "My grandson and I would go off in 
the woods, and one of my granddaughters always: 
'C'mon Grandmom, 
let's take a walk. 
Off we would go, and we'd walk sometimes 
about five miles, wouldn't we Jack?" 
I'd imagine, and sometimes even more. 
I'd have to make up stories for them. 
The Jersey Devil. 
Every night, Grandmom tell us about the Jersey Devil...A lot of 
people say they saw him, but he was a different creature every 
time he was told about. One fella said he fell asleep by a tree 
and the Jersey Devil come up and stood by him. 
And some people 
say he was built like a horse, with a devil's head and a devil's 
tail. 
One had deer's hoofs. 
And it would kill stock. 
I've 
never saw him, but I've heard plenty of stories. belief 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 23 
JD I don't think anybody's ever saw him. 
Ann I've seen pieces in the paper where people said they 
positively saw him. 
JD 
I was around a good many days and never saw him. 
Ann Some had 'im from his legs up he was human, and the back 
of 
im was an animal. 
Others had 
it where he had feet. 
But the 
woman that had im the family claimed he come to them one time. 
Where he was born, I've heard, but I've heard too many different 
places. 
Places in Whitesbog. 
Florence and Rome. 
They had these 
homes, they were two story, and the Italians would come from 
Philadelphia, and they had outside cooking houses. and every so 
many buildings would have an oven. 
One of those round oval 
top 
ones, and they'd build a fire in this oven. 
They'd carry through 
the woods these branches of brush and things, and then they'd 
build this big fire and burn it maybe three or four hours and get 
the whole thing hot. And then they'd have their bread ready to 
put in and then they had a paddle that they used to put their 
bread on and slide in the oven, and oh was that ever good when it 
come out .... Oh yeah, we always got some. They used to make big 
round loaves, and some were long loaves. 
Oh, that crust, Jack 
used to 
love to eat that crust because it was just super 
delicious. foodways 
The people are gone. 
The buildings are all 
torn down or 
burned down. 
Forest Fires. 
Definitely. 
What's that hill, Jack? JD 
Willy's Hill. Ann: No, toward Whitings. 
JD Oh, Job's Swamp. Ann: 
There was a fire on one side of that road, and 
as you go over 
Job's swamp there was mounds on both sides of the road, and 
people have seen, my father for one saw it, a deer jump across 
it, 
all 
on fire. 
They claim that lots of your fires are kept on 
burning because of animals on fire. 
Several people saw them jump 
the road. 
(Ann never fought in any). 
Spent lots of time as a 
kid where there was water and not danger. 
Fishing, got pike. 
We'd go out after supper and get a bucketful of catfish. 
Fishworms for bait. 
Catfish are hard to skin because of their 
"stickers", their "thorns". 
She'd only eat them fried, dipped 
in 
batter and crumbs and seasoned with pepper. 
In warm weather your 
fish are soft and they taste muddy. 
They used homemade lard, Ann 
has made it herself. 
Our doctor decided that we couldn't have 
any grease, so I gave away three great big drums. 
My father fixed a place and I'd have a playhouse. 
My 
brothers and I would go out and get blueberries for food in the 
playhouse. Isaiah, Harold, Lester (in Boston), and Elmer. 
Harold's in Pemberton. 
Her maiden name was Haines. 
Never made 
pets of the wild animals around. 
"I messed with snakes 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 24 
(laughing). I had a cupboard full of snakes in formaldehyde." 
Her father was the foreman for Whitesbog, in a bigger way than 
Lou Grant. They scoff at the 
idea that people could navigate by 
the taste of blueberries. 
Memories of Christmas in Whitesbog, we had a lot of people 
that lived there year round and worked. 
Italians, 700 at once, 
would come 
in the spring. 
(celebration) 
JD 
Florence and Rome. 
People brought there by train from 
Philadelphia. 
Reeves's bogs? 
William Reeves owned it. I don't 
think they do much there these days. 
Ann: 
Elizabeth White was a wonderful person. 
She was an 
old maid, but she knew about plants. 
JD She originated and came up with the blueberry. Ann went 
with her. 
Ann's father got to be foreman because he knew a chauffeur 
for Whites. 
Mr. White came over where her father was tending 
someone else's bogs. 
As I say, we seen the place grow, and the 
cranberry went from hand—picking to scooping and from scooping to 
machines. 
The picker that Darlington made was made after I left. 
When I got married I didn't go back to work there. 
How They Met 
JD 
Well, just a small resume. 
I went to a party with a 
girl. Somehow we traded that night, and I came home with her. 
And you see what I done, I've kept her ever since. 
I would call 
that barter and trade. 
(Laughing) 
JD 
I was borned up 
in Fort Dix. 
They took our farm. 
On 
both sides of my family I'm farmer bred. 
(First it was Camp 
Dix.) My father bought this saloon in 1907, and I was comin' 
eight year old when we moved in here. 
Her brother Isaiah and I 
used to be good buddies and run around together. 
We use to do a 
lot of different things that you don't put on tape. 
We done a 
little killin' deer and all that kind of stuff. 
(at night). 
Ann I gunned with a crowd every year and (end of tape).

Jack whistling, Ann coughs a little. 
Resuming snapping turtle discussion. Catch 'em up around the 
bogs where you saw 'em crawling, on the dams. 
I've even picked 
'em up out here. 
34 pounds is the biggest he's caught. 
50 pound 
is the biggest he's seen. 
Never did set traps. 
Knew lots who 
used fyke nets. 
Now you talk about killin' em. 
If we was gonna clean one up 
tomorrow, we would tonight cut 'is head off, hang 'im up by the 
tail 
and let 'im bleed out all night. 
Then tomorrow you'd get up 
and put on a boiler full of scaldin' water and then scald 'im. 
Now there's as far as I was ever in 
it, because my friend used to 
do that, and my wife did the rest. 
MH Reflexes? 
JD No, but you see, the head of a snapper, when you cut that 
off you're sposed to cut it through here, or bury it, because it 
can bite up til sundown that night. 
You'd bury it or cut im 
which ever way you wanted to do. 
Then this fella would take im 
out piece by piece and get all 
the skin off of it. 
When you got 
done scaldin it , it was white, the meat was. 
It's an awful job. 
Recommends seeing the fella with the sign on your left in 
Chatsworth. 
Ann: Its an ordeal trying to get it cleaned. 
But 
it's an awful 
lot of meat, and a lot of stock comes from the 
shell. Then you let 'em soak in salt water. 
JD Like a 
tenderloin's up 
in the back, that comes out in your soup. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 26 
Ann: You've got to be careful how long you cook it. I can't 
tell you the time, 
it's accordin' to your size snapper. 
If you 
overcook it, 
it's tough, stringy. 
But if you cook it, 
it's like 
a lobster, 
if you don't cook 
it right it's not good. 
By boilin'. 
There are people who fry it, make it into pot pies. 
There's a 
lot of people does a lot with it. 
Ann: Then you cook it up 
accordin to your likin, 
like soup. 
JD: 
Then my secret comes: 
that's eatin' em. 
Ann: I made 50 gallon or better, (for a 
snapper soup party for the fiftieth year of Jack's life 
in Browns 
Mills, 1957). 
A snapper soup party. Lots of people. 
His friend 
"Bum" had lots of snappers, insisted on giving them to Jack. 
foodways, (celebration) 
Served with sherry on the table. 
Mayo's is commercial, 
theirs is more like vegetable soup. 
Ann shreds her snapper. 
"I 
start out with cabbage, potatoes, celery, onions, carrots, cooked 
in the stock. 
Then string beans, peas, whatever you want. 
Then, 
in the batch that I made I put six pounds of butter. 
Then I had 
hard boiled eggs that I ground. 
That's the Piney way that we 
make snapper soup. 
In restaurants you get that brown gravy and I 
don't like it." 
JD Did practically everything on a farm. 
His full name 
is 
Jackson Washington Davis. 
He has an older sister, she's 86, he's 
84, they're not getting along. 
(Charlie Powell said Jack's 
nickname was Wyatt Urb). 
Jack's father had cows, a dairy, raised 
corn, wheat, rye, oats, hay, straw, killed hogs, beef, chickens, 
ducks, geese, turkeys. 
Where the government took our farm was 
one of the best pieces of ground you ever seen. 
Dad didn't want 
to sign off to 'em. 
He had a lawsuit with em. 
He didn't want to 
get shut of it. 
When I lived here, I raised turkeys, chickens, 
geese, ducks. 
A thousand turkeys in that yard. 
Had our own milk 
COW. 
Sold pound of potatoes for fifty cents. 
Hogs 6 cents a 
pound. Not much money in 
'em. 
The saloon's patrons included salesmen, put horses up 
in a 
barn. 
Room and Board, seven days room, twenty one meals: $5.00. 
thirty five cents for a full cooked meal. 
restaurant 
The first job I ever done was picking up potatoes, nine 
hours, 75 cents. 
But you didn't need much in those days. 
If you 
had five dollars that was something. 
They lived with his 
grandmother and his father for a while when they were first 
married. 
More on farming, low prices and self—sufficiency. 
210: then he did odds and ends with his father, raised 
turkeys. 
Then they had race horses. 
Had six race horses in 1927 
when his dad's illness curtailed it. 
It was like any other 
sport, like having bird dogs or rabbit dogs. 
He was a hunter, my 
dad was, and he was used to making a living off the ground. 
Hufford-- 83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 27 
See, back 
in his days they drove horses, 
it was the 
transportation. 
I used to drive a horse to New Egypt, put it 
in 
the barn at Pemberton, take the train to Mt. Holly. 
Come back 
around midnight. 
(think of the analogue, horse sports, four— 
wheeling). 
Growing old here. 
We're getting very much by ourselves. 
Johnny Earlin's sister died this year. 
Ann taking her medicine. 
Friends from the younger days, old—time friends, are scarce. 
The 
younger generation doesn't really fit in. 
You know when you live 
as 
long as we've lived you outgrow a lot of your friends. 
In 
these last ten years we've lost a lot of our old time friends. 
Roy Landerfield, 
Earl Carr, 
Ralph Eulick, he and I went to 
school right down here. 
Some of em I hunted with, part of em I 
fished with. 
One buddy I fished salt water with in June before 
he went overseas. 
I done quite a lot of fresh water with pike 
and stuff like that. 
It's a lonely slow road, my dear. 
You'll 
get to 
it 
if you have good luck. 
I had a nice business here at one time. 
Big business. 
Good 
business. 
It started downhill just like you know with livin. 
When the country went downhill. 
On a Saturday night we had 
family night. 
You could come here with your husband, children. 
We'd have a hell of a time. 
Now we're just here existin' till 
the time comes. 
They got us tangled down here with this wetlands 
and now I can't sell. 
I can sell but nobody will buy on a 
property you can't build on. 
Doesn't work as a business because people don't have 
spendin' money these days. 
Re: G—Hidden Lakes; 27GT. 
Jack calls it the Clay Pits back of 
Woodmansie. 
Hauled clay on the railroad there. We had a cabin 
there, the ground belonged to her brother. 
Cranberry bogs, but 
we 
let 'em grow up. 
I remember when there were stores in 
Woodmansie and Pasadena. 
We went there on weekends. 
She used to 
cook. 
We used to have parties there. 
That's where we've been. 
I'm a woodsman. 
A woodsman likes the woods and stays in them. 
If I had my way I'd be 
in 
it right now.

JD 
We spent a lot of our weekends 
up to the cabin that's in the woods, the one near Woodmansie, 
right near that bog. 
I think there is a building there yet. 
The 
last I knew they had 
it for a deer club. 
Nobody lives there that 
I know of. (Bill Wasiowich?, no recognition). 
What's the difference in 
looks between a Maryland Hound and 
a Walker? 
JD 
Well I don't really know, they don't look a thing 
alike. 
I don't know how to describe it. 
A Walker don't have as 
much ear as a Maryland Hound has, for one thing. 
And a lot of 
'em don't have as much hair. 
They remind me somewhat of a 
pointer and a bird dog (he's eating a tuna sandwich on white 
bread here, delivered to him by Bobby ? who is tending the 
adjacent bar). 
Some of 
'em remind me of them. 
Do you think 
either breed is prettier? 
JD. Well, Mary, the way I'd put it, I 
don't like a Walker because they're a crazy running dog. 
They're 
a speed dog. 
And I like a dog, he gets on the track and runs 
it. 
Now, I know people wouldn't give you a Walker for two or 
three hounds. 
In other words, 
it's a little of you're own 
choice, that's the way I'd put it. 
Most of your Walkers are 
pretty smart runners. 
What I mean by smart runnin', a fox would 
come out where that door is, they're liable to come out up there 
and cut across. 
That's what I mean. 
Where can you go to get Maryland hounds? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 29 
JD 
Get 'em right down here around, you have to go to 
Maryland. 
AD Jack, you want another half? 
JD 
Not necessarily, no. 
AD He made me a full sandwich and I can't eat it. 
JD Ann, 
if you 
don't want it, don't eat it. 
Let's see, I used to go down 
around Greenwood, Delaware; Fredericksburg, Maryland; Hagerstown, 
Maryland; 
Oh, hell, all 
in around there, down in around, oh, 
Christ, I don't know them towns. 
Where we used to go, all 
over 
down there. 
It was just like you'd come 
in the farming section. 
A little settlement here, a little settlement there. 
MH Were Maryland hounds around when your dad was hunting. 
JD Oh, we had a better breed of dogs then than what we got now. 
They were hounds, regular hounds. 
I don't know where they 
originated. 
God, I don't know where they go back to, even. 
I 
don't have no idea. 
All I know, I've seen 'em all me life. 
You 
know what my dad used to do, he didn't foxhunt now (all the time) 
but he had twelve big dogs that he used to rabbit hunt with. 
He'd gun six today, six tomorrow. 
Then maybe if he didn't get 
out, rained or somethin, he'd take all twelve of 
'em out. 
Sounded just like a fox chase comin.' 
MH Did you start foxhunting before your dad did? JD 
No! My 
father was a hunter all 
his life. 
As far back as I know. 
I 
don't know when he started. 
When I was borned he had huntin' 
dogs. 
No, no. That goes way back. 
That's one of your, well, 
back in those days a lot of the farmers used to hunt together. 
Like you'd be on this farm, I'd be on that one, and she was on 
another one, well, you'd gun together and things like that. 
There was a lot of friendship in those days. 
More'n there is 
today. 
MH Would you always go with someone you knew? 
JD Oh, I've 
took strangers with me. 
Let 'em throw their dogs in. 
Later on 
we'd get to be good friends and hunt together. 
A fella come up 
one time, down below Chatsworth G—Three Bridges Shanty, 27GT, and I 
was runnin' a fox, and I heard a dog bark, and I looked at 'im, 
and he had four or six, and I said, "Go ahead and throw 'em in!" 
And we had a nice chase and we had a nice time sittin' and 
talkin' together. 
That's the type I like. I like to sit and 
talk. 
Back in that day when we was down there you might run into 
6 or 8 couples at a crossroads all standin' there talkin'. 
Where 
this guy'd been there, and another one'd been there and we'd all 
come back and meet and then we'd talk for an hour or two. That 
was your friendship. 
Just I 
i 
ke a fisherman looks for fishermen, 
we 
look for people to hunt with. 
AD 
They'd have dogs maybe runnin, all 
at once everybody'd 
stop and they, "They're all here!" "No, I hear some back here!" 
JD 
There's a lot of entertainment in that if you want to go 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 30 
for it. 
I don't know of anything that's more healthy than 
huntin' and fishin'. 
You're out in the open air, (whistles a 
little) Now you're askin me a lot of questions, but you haven't 
told me anything. 
What do you like? 
MH What do I like? 
JD 
I mean in the way of sports. 
Do you 
have any desire for any sports? 
MH I like to go out in the woods 
and look for plants. JD That's the point that I like. 
I like to 
go foxhuntin, but I don't go off by meself anymore. 
I don't 
trust meself, because I can't walk no distance, but I used to go, 
and we'd be up there in the woods, daylight in the morning, 
dogs'd be way off here trailin', and I'd be sittin' there on top 
of me dog box listenin' to 'em. You look out here and you see a 
squirrel or something, playing. 
Maybe 
you look around here 
after a bit and here comes a deer walkin' out, all that kind of 
stuff, you see, and I get a big kick out of 
it. 
And I was up one 
time by myself, and this'll show you how you can be took over 
into anything. 
I'm sittin there, me dogs trailin' up the swamp 
like 'at, goin' up where I was, and there's two squirrels, 
playin' 
in a tree, and I'm sittin' there watching them squirrels, 
and after a bit one of 
'em comes over and he gets on a limb, oh 
maybe twice as far as that door is from you, and 
if you ever hear 
anything sound like he's cussin' you! 
Oh he was chatterin! And 
he done that for a while, and away he went back over in that big 
tree, big gum tree, and they was playin' around there, and after 
a bit, I looked up and here come the son of a bitch back and the 
other one too! 
And they both got on that limb! And you oughta 
heard them tell me! 
So they went back, went over the tree, and 
all 
at once it dawned on me, "Where the hell's me dogs? I don't 
hear no dogs! 
And I listened, and I still don't hear no dogs. 
Well 
on that side, away from me, there was a pretty big crick, 
and I didn't figure they'd go over that. 
So I figured they come 
up here and they musta come out, you know, over the railroad and 
out the other way. 
so I went up this sand road, and they had 
this gray fox goin, fresh, and there're me dogs goin. 
I went 
over in another swamp and there they was runnin'. 
I didn't know 
how long they'd been runnin.' 
MH What swamp was it? 
JD Up 
in North Branch. 
I was up 
into, oh, what the hell did 
they call that branch when we started that? 
Buckingham. 
I don't 
imagine they changed the name. 
Course you might go up huntin', 
and call 
it somethin else, you know what I mean? 
A lot of places 
in the woods gets named by somebody. 
I been up there in places, 
and people tell me all 
about 'em, and I don't know where they are 
and after I find out what they're talking about, I've been there 
many a time. 
They got a different name, they call 
it. 
One 
place, Lightnin' Point, that was a tree, and when I found out 
this guy called it Lightnin' Point cause of this tree, they were 
hit with Lightnin'. 
And things like that. 
We called it 
Lippincott's bogs, there were cranberry bogs there. 
Right on the 
other side of the lake, goin' up towards Whitesbogs. 
Now a lot 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 31 
of places, we used to call one place Cabin Gutter. 
I don't know 
why 
it was ever called Cabin Gutter. 
AD And Britches Branch, and Burnt Gate. 
JD Webby was great for naming places. 
Clarence Webb lived 
over here. 
He's the one come out with Lightnin' Point. 
That's 
known as Lightnin' Point nowadays by the older people. 
MH Any places you've named? 
JD No. 
There was one that we did name, not me in 
particular, but we had a place when we deerhunted where we used 
to kill does, and we called that Doe Gut. 
Right up from 
Whitesbogs, goin' up towards Lakehurst. 
A place back where there 
wasn't anybody around, where we used to declare a day where if we 
didn't kill many bucks, we'd declare a day and kill some does and 
go back there to splice out meat. 
That's Fort Dix now. 
No one really goes there now. 
JD I don't go up and bother with the government. 
I don't 
understand their ways. 
I don't know why they took it from us. 
It was our good huntin' ground at one time, what they took here, 
that was one of my best huntin' grounds when I was a young fella. 
It was all 
good gunning ground, rabbits, grouse, quail, 
pheasants, deer. 
MH Would you always know what you were after when you first 
set out? 
JD Not always, but when you gun a bird dog, you go for 
birds, and generally when you run a rabbit dog you gun for 
rabbits. 
Sometimes it does mix up onto you, but not when you 
get, when I run a rabbit dog, my dogs would run rabbits, wouldn't 
run deer or I wouldn't keep 'em. 
You can't do two things at one 
time you know. 
I realize they've just finished their bedtime lunch, and 
make a move to wrap up. 
"It's drawin' on toward that side of 
life," said Jack... 
"I forget things happened years ago, and 
maybe I get sittin' talkin' to somebody. 
See, I like to talk to 
somebody that's got age on 'em, 
'cause they'll relate things to 
me, and I'll 
relate things to them." 
AD "That is, these local 
ones, yeah." 
JD "I'll tell you one I've got right now. 
I had a 
lady stop and see me. 
A little short lady. 
They said 'an old 
woman, 
in the bar.' 
She didn't seem old to me. 
Back in 1905 we 
walked to school together. 
I guess she's still 
livin,' 
it's been 
about two years since we seen her. 
See, back 
in that day, you 
didn't have no cars, or horse and wagon, and you walked. But to 
me she didn't seem like an old woman, because her and I was at 
the same age of 
life. 
And I would like to see her come back 
again where she'd come 
in and sit down and we could have a good

old chat about olden days. 
She brought about us walking to 
school an all 
that, and that was entertainment to me to 
listen to 
that. 
Yup, 1905, that's pretty well back, 
isn't it? You can't 
even remember where you were then. 
(laughs) Kind of a stupid 
remark isn't it? 
See now that's one thing where I would like to 
see her again, just so I could sit down and talk. 
Ann mentions that Mrs. Buzby kept up with all 
the people 
that Jack didn't. 
He talks to her sometimes, when he sees her 
out. 
The other woman was Sue Bishop when Jack knew her. 
Didn't 
know her married name. 
"And she looks an awful 
lot like Sue 
Bishop to me. 
You know some people when they go that long don't. 
Now this one 
in the store, (Mrs. Buzby), Ann told her that she 
was married to Jack Davis, and Mrs. Buzby remembered that I went 
to school with her, high school. 
And I was sittin' back there 
havin' somethin' to eat, and she comes back there and she said, 
"Do you know me?" 
I says, "I don't know, should I?" 
"Yeah," she 
says, 
"I went to school with you." 
"Where from? South ??" "Yeah" 
I says, "You're an Applegate? I forget the other name." 
She 
says, "I am." 
but she didn't recognize me til after she'd talked 
to my wife. 
MH Who else do you know around here that you went to school 
with? 
JD They're scarce. 
AD Junior Stevenson, 
in Chatsworth, you know he died. 
JD Used to be around Johnny Broomes's. 
All that family's 
dead and gone but one, and that's Johnny. 
Lives across from the 
store. 
They used to 
live right next door to me at one time. But 
This one I was talkin about, Sue, I'd figure she was gone 
if I 
hadn't seen 
her. 
Talking about Pittsburgh, where I grew up. 
He'd been near 
there gunning for small game. 
Doesn't like 
it there. 
More 
difficult to gun, here you're in flat country. 
There you're in 
mountain country, a lot harder to gun one than flat country. 
Time to go to bed. 
I turn the fans back on, and pack up.

G—Forked River; 49GT Looking at topo map. 
He'll be 
cutting the area on the switch road, he makes plow lines 3-5 
hundred feet apart, running north and south. 
He burns against a 
westerly wind. 
Could not use southerly or northerly wind, they 
change too often. Westerly wind is drier, more predominant. 
Checks temp and long—range forecast. 
Temp should be between 30 
and 40 degrees. 
Won't really burn hot enough under 30 degrees. 
He's learned through experience, mistakes, and working with 
foresters. 
He hopes to retire there full time. 
Lucille thinks 
it's too far from everything. 
"My daughter lives 
in Brookville," 
(near Jones Road) 
"He took me out there yesterday. I said can 
you imagine going all this way for food?" 
Ten miles from 
Shoprite. 
He traded property on the other side of the railroad 
for what he's got now. 
MH: But you know all the land on the 
other side? 
CF Yeah, I've hunted it, and that's how I know it. 
Now I'll 
be cuttin' cedar right here, and I have to go up along 
here and come across and go back here . The cedar operation. We 
have to build roads. 
This is a flood plain, the stream runs thru 
the middle. 
Six feet of mud. Shows me a picture of himself on a 
corduroy road. 
Two thousand feet of that road they've built in 
the 
last 
year. 
Slabs crossways, poles lengthwise. 
They make 
the slabs at the mill, six miles from there, down this mountain 
road, near Double Trouble, a mile west of it. 
I own the mill, 
but the state owns the property. 
They honor the contract I had 
with my sister. 
They bought it with Green Acres. 
I don't know 
whether it was good or bad but it happened. 
There's a place over 
here called Azerdatun 
(not marked). 
There's Factory. 
The 
Wanamassa Gun Club. 
The Chiselers' club aka 
The Dolf Arens 
Club, aka the Tillie Collins Place. 
It's been burnt twice. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

Usually they're made of concrete blocks with wooden roofs. 
Vandals set fire to them. 
The roof rafters have to be made of 
wood. 
Most clubs burnt up there by people who are against deer 
hunting (near Joe Albert's!) 
118 
Identifies Azerdatun. 
He's done lots of deer hunting, 
has worked as a guide. 
It got its name, a fellow by the name of 
Datun, with the first name of Asa (Ace?). There was a house 
there, but it's gone now. 
And this road here, the Azerdatun, 
Forked River Mountain Road. 
They tested ammunition in a 
clearing somewhere else during World War II. 
Preacher's Hill, 
now a gravel area. 
Wright's road, now a gravel pit. 
They've dug 
this all 
off. 
There's nothing there anymore. 
Clear over here to 
fire tower, a gravel operation. 
He's been up 
in the fire tower. 
Lucille: He took me up there one time, and I said, "Where's 
the mountain? 
We did stand on the back of his truck and see the 
Barnegat Lighthouse. 
Much higher than the surrounding. 
150 
feet, high for this area. 
Another road, unsure of name. 
"I've 
walked it, 
it's quite a stretch." 
The Harrison Road, 
leads to 
Howardville, bought by the state, now it's a hunting preserve, 
not a cranberry bog. 
They let everything go. 
They took down all 
the houses that was 
in there, for workers to live 
in, 
and the 
cranberry storage buildings. 
One year we scooped 9 thousand 
bushel off a this. 
The Penn Producing company and they sold to 
the state. 
The Waretown Dump here, the Ocean County Dump. 
They 
charge the county to get in there. 
They have guards. 
Brookville, a church there, quite a few people live there. 
Long Ridge Road went right from the Church to Forked River, once 
the Forked River—Brookville Road. 
The hunting club, the Quasar 
family. 
Their daughter has lived there for five years. 
They 
have lots of friends in Brookville. 
Scout camps, boys and girls. 
They go hiking all over in there. 
Frankie's Crossway is here, that was during the 
Revolutionary War, where it crossed the stream. 
A crossway is a 
bridge. 
Another causeway (?) 
down here. 
Collins was a 
predominant name for woodspeople, Frankie Collins. 
Collins 
Crossway was built by Clifford. 
Lucille calls it the black 
bridge (creosoted). I used old creosote, Johnny Parker give me 
some. 
It's a strong bridge, 
it would hold 50 ton. 
In the thirties a couple fellows cut it out to get at some 
oak, but now its all 
grooved up again, and the motorcycles use it 
now. 
There's an awful 
lot of motorcycles in this area. 
They 
ruin every one of the roads in here. 
A bull—nosed line, don't 
tell me why, I don't know, maybe to get wood out. 
A straight 
line like that is a bull—nosed line. 
A short cut to get to the 
ammunition testing site. 
Cliff was 
in the Navy during the war, 
on a troop transport with North Africa, then a battleship, then a 
cruiser. 
Most guys went into the army or navy. 
He was 
in three 
and a half years. 
He'll be cutting in North Branch. 
Two more

crossways, one not shown. 
Stout's Road came in through 
somewhere. It isn't named on there. 
It followed a ridge there. 
He has mostly hunted deer, trapped a lot when he was young, for 
muskrats, fox, mink, on the meadows. 
He occasionally sees the 
foxhunters around there who go with Joe Albert at night. 
There's 
different hunters, but Albert hunts in this general area. 
They 
trap quite a bit there too, worth about 50 dollars apiece. armed

More on control burning. 
Plowed lines first, then wait 
for the wind to be favorable, 10 to 15 mph at most. 
You have to 
guess at it. 
The temp, shouldn't be over 40. 
Do it when there's 
a forecast of rain. 
His father didn't do that much of 
it. 
He 
learned to burn while working for Penn Producing, when they had 
to do 
it at night, early in the spring, 
in March. 
We burned 
between the road and the bog to protect the bog from wildfire. 
We usually burned maybe a couple hundred feet around there. 
He 
thinned 600 acres by himself, has to burn it to protect those 
trees. 
A tree about every fifteen feet. 
He sells the pine for 
piling, but there's a greater demand for cedar.

Re: the school there, run by Tom 
Brown of The Tracker notoriety. 
They've met him. 
The last class 
consisted of survival practice for four state troopers and two 
psychiatrists. 
Two kinds of class, one for fasting, one for 
surviving on what you can find. 
A fast lifestyle retards your 
lifestyle, you've got to slow down, sit there and meditate. 
The 
other school they find more appealing. 
One fellow was out 
camping and had his equipment stolen, and had he not taken the 
course he couldn't have survived. 
You can survive on roots, 
acorns, rabbits. 
Lu: The main thing is that you know you could 
do 
it 
if you had to. 
035: How he decides on a tree to cut. 
He 
lets anyone come 
in there to camp, or hunt, as 
long as they 
don't trash it. 
It's between the south branch of forked river 
and the north branch. 
It's called the head of south branch. 
The 
head of middle and south branch stops on his property. 
North 
branch continues on through. 
In a little valley by Switch Road 
that's where the heads start. 
wood processing 
"See we have three branches in Forked River, you have the 
North Branch, the Middle Branch, and the South Branch, that's why 
they call 
it Forked River. 
See the two branches heads up right 
in my property, where this other one goes on through and heads up 
just about on Jones Road. 
Where I would choose to live would be 
near the cedar, 
it's the most valuable thing I got. 
The hills 
are too exposed. ..I did find a cave one time when I was burning, 
an opening in the side of a hill, with an entrance with stones 
like a mason would put it 
in, 
and I've not found it since. 
See 
the white men might have made it to watch these charcoal pits. 
Right on the edge of this hill, on the south edge of the hill. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 37 
It doesn't have a name, but the ridge goes all the way to Forked 
River." 
MH: Have you followed the Ridge? 
CF Yes, I've walked it, we 
used to walk that ridge from Forked River. 
We followed that 
ridge, and then we'd follow the Stone Hill Branch, and go right 
on the Forked River Mountains. 
Lu: 
His grandmother used to walk it to carry lunch to her 
father. 
CF See he was up 
in the hills burning charcoal pits, and 
he was burning charcoal pits in this area here, and, she lived at 
Deerhead Lake. 
There was a mill 
right there, from prior to the 
Revolutionary War. 
See, some of these names would be from the 
developers, like Barnegat Lakes. 
Lu: 
When she was a little girl she said a bear scared her. 
CF: 
See she lived by this mill, and she would walk up this 
road, I guess it shows here, she used to walk up here, and her 
father and brother was burning charcoal pits. 
They had to stay 
with them, they couldn't leave them. 
She seen plenty bears. 
There was lots of bears. 
She told me stories about seeing them, 
and I never listened to 
'em. 
The only house was here was where 
she lived. 
...To manage this land someone has got to do some 
control burning, because every twenty years this whole area is 
burnt by a wildfire. 
It destroys everything, the method he uses 
is used all over the country, a fire only hot enough to burn 
along the ground, to reduce the fuel that's there. 
See, the 
state owns a lot of forest land in NJ and they do this the same 
time I'm doin it each winter. 
But they can only burn the state 
land. 
They've made big mistakes out in the west where they've 
done it, 
and started wildfires. 
CF belongs to the tree farmers association. 
He has 800 
acres. 
South Jersey is more susceptible to wildfires than North 
Jersey. 
It's your tinderbox area. 
We have more problems in 
Ocean and Burlington county than they do 
in North Jersey. 
He doesn't have to control burn the cedar, 
in winter there's 
a foot of water there. 
Now it's kind of dry. 
He has two five— 
acre permits from the Pinelands Commission. 
188 
Squirrels are no help in reseeding the trees. 
You have 
to 
let the sun 
in. 
It takes a hundred years to get the trees to 
the harvest stage. 
He's harvesting trees that are older than 
that, and are two feet in diameter, some of them. 
The average is 
from eight to twelve inches. 
In North Branch 
it was cut off in 
the thirties, and those trees are six to eight inches in 
diameter. 
Not much cedar around now. 
Certain amount of moisture is 
requisite. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 38 
LU: 
Did you know that the white cedar smells better than 
the red cedar? Not much red cedar around, except near the bay and 
marsh. 
Her closets are all cedar, and that helps keep the bugs 
out. 
The house they live 
in, was the original Forked River 
Bottling Works. 
His uncle operated it. 
He used to drink soda 
from those collectible bottles that his uncle capped with a foot 
capper. The water came from a well right on the property. 
The 
water is clean now, but they are afraid of the Waretown Dump to 
the west of them. 
Underground water runs to the east. 
Joe 
Albert's water is polluted. 
A year ago he had it tested, and he 
now trucks his water in. 
264: 
That was a huntin cabin, and he used to come down 
huntin deer and foxes. 
Did I ever see the pathetic deer that 
wander into his camp sometimes? 
Arrows sticking out of them, a 
leg missing? 
Cedar Harvesting. 
A clear cut, with as many trees for 
reseeding left as possible. 
The first thing you do, you start a 
corduroy road, cutting the stumps off with a chainsaw, and keep 
backing in with your truck. 
"I haul out three cords to the load, 
and that's approx. 10 tons, 
including the truck, that the road 
has to handle" 
Then we pile all 
the brush we can on top of 
it. 
The wheels grind up the brush and keep the slab from moving. 
Another thing it does, 
it takes the cedar tops off of the little 
trees so they can grow. 
The old timers done it that way. 
Lu: He 
goes about it just a certain way, he doesn't leave the brush 
lying every which way. 
CF: 
We put the brush on the crossway, 
and that holds the slabs in position. 
We leave the slabs right 
there, and the cedar won't reseed in the road, and the trees'll 
grow up on both sides and meet at the top. 
I can show a place 
where it was cut off like that a hundred years ago, and I can 
show you another place down here. 
It's rotted out, but the trees 
don't grow up 
in 
it. 
The advantage is that a tree needs ten or 
fifteen feet around it to grow properly, 
the road 
is ten feet 
wide, which gives each tree five feet. 
You should thin out 
cedar, but I don't know any way to do 
it. 
If thinned properly, 
they'd be big 
in 50 years instead of 100. 
348: But if you thin it too much the wind'll blow it over. 
We fall 
'em all toward the crossway, and most of 
'em fall right 
on 
it. 
You have to notch 'em just right to have 'em fall. 
We do 
our own work, just me and my son. 
Roughly speaking, we cut about 
250 cords a year, (thirty tractor trailer loads). 
Lu: You 
couldn't keep him inside, he's always outside trimming the tree 
farm when it's cold and he can't do anything else. 
CF It's hard work, but that's what I average, about an acre 
a day, and I've thinned about 600 acres. 
Mh Do you see lots of animals? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 39 
CF 
Yeah, you see deer all the time. 
Lu: They watch you. CF 
They walk around you, but they get used to you. 
We're working up 
here now, and they're browsing over here, not 400 feet away. 
MH Do they give you trouble, eating the tops of cedar 
saplings? 
CF 
They eat the tops, they like them, 
like 
in March, 
the tops that we've left. 
They eat the little cedars, but that's 
their nature. 
Lu: I guess that's a natural thinning out process.

A tree 
has about, oh, I don't know how many seeds, but we'll say 
thousands of seeds, and out of those thousands of seeds, maybe 
just a small percentage of 'em become trees, because the deer eat 
some of 
'em, and some of 
'em will fall 
in the water and won't 
reseed, so the seed has to go 
in a certain spot to grow a tree. 
And 
if 
it's too shady it won't never come up, and it has to have 
a certain amount of sun, a certain amount of moisture, so I'm 
comparin it to a fish, a fish does the same thing, he spawns eggs 
and maybe two percent of the eggs will become fish, and I compare 
a tree the same way, because, probably a same proportion of the 
tree will become trees. 
That seems to be nature that way. 
You 
can go on and on with things that spawn. 
MH What are all the animals you encounter out there? 
CF There's a lot of grouse, deer, rabbit, fox, raccoon. . .I 
see them. 
LF There haven't been many snakes though this year. 
CF There's pine snakes, but there's not many of 
'em, they're 
extinct. 
You can tell 
by the tracks. 
You don't have to see 'em 
to know they're there. 
But the most predominate, or the most of 
the animals that's in this area, 
is the red squirrel. 
There's 
not many gray, but the red squirrel, there's thousands of them. 
But you can go up there and you'll never see one. 
You'll never 
see a red squirrel. 
MH How come? 
CF 
They're evasive. MH How 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 41 
can you tell they're there? 
CF Well, they eat the pine cones. 
They'll have the pine cones piled up that high. 
They'll take a 
pine cone apart, and 
in a pine cone there's somewhere around a 
hundred seeds. 
LF 
He brought one home one day and made me count 
how many seeds was 
in 
it. 
CF Well, there's about a hundred, and 
that's what the red squirrel 
lives off of, those seeds, but they 
have to chew the pine cone apart. 
MH How did you know it wasn't 
a gray squirrel doing it? 
CF Well, I do see 'em, the average 
person I don't think will go out there and see 'em. 
You gotta go 
out there and sit and be quiet and you'll see 'em, but if you 
move you'll never see one. 
You gotta sit in the tree or somethin 
like that, for at least an hour or something. 
The woods become 
alive with squirrels, because they don't realize you're there. 
If you move around they know you're there, so they don't come 
out. 
They're in the ground, you know, or in a tree, but they're 
timid... MH What about foxes. 
CF There are a lot of foxes, but 
they're a night animal, foxes. 
You can see the tracks where they 
run the roads and same way with the raccoon, that's a night animal 
too. 
They only run at night. 
Daytime they sleep. 
LF My husband's a day person, early day. CF My wife's a 
night person. 
LF I like to stay up sewing and he 
likes to go to 
bed early. 
CF re: the roadbuilding. I'd have to show it to you for you 
to understand it. 
But I was tellin' the boy, 
it's about a six 
mile trip from here to there, and then we have to go to the mill 
which is toward Double Trouble, that's another six miles, so we 
make a big round trip. 
MH How long does it take to build? 
CF Each day we try to do some of 
it. 
I try for ten to 
fifteen feet a day. 
We just work on it as we go along. 
Making arrangements for me to accompany them out to the 
site. 
They start out at about 6:30, finishing at 2:00 in the 
afternoon. 
Lots of extra work while they're up there, road 
building, trimming trees for the next load.

CF It's unusual nowadays because there's not many people 
doing this type of thing. 
Actually most our swamps are cut off, 
and some are not growing back because they're too dry. 
MH 
When the Pinelands Commission was forming did anyone 
come around and talk to you about the way you use the lands? 
CF 
Yeah, they come around, and I think 
it was a fella by the name of 
Brown and a girl named Susie. 
But, I don't know what she's doin' 
now, maybe she's raisin' a family. 
But she had all of Lacey 
Township, and she had to do with gravel permits and cedar 
permits, but it's changed since then. 
There's a fella by the 
name of Brown and he comes down and inspects what you're doin'. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 42 
They specify the way I'm doing it. 
Drag it out with a winch, and 
that's what I do. 
It roughs up the ground so that the seedling 
can start, and 
it seems to be the best. 
We're looking at a map. 
"See I'm in the forest area, all my 
land 
is 
in the forest area, but the core area is, from the Forked 
River mountains north is the core area. 
LF 
You have to file 
applications for permits, for building and cutting rights. 
CF 
The water from the Forked River Mountains, the north side, goes 
into Cedar Creek. 
That's in the core area. 
Everything south is 
in the forest area (preservation?) and that drains into North 
Branch. 
Now you get further down here and this drains into 
Oyster Creek. And that's a different area. 
That's in rural 
development. 
MH That's how they divide it up? By stream? CF 
Yeah, the way the streams drain. 
so you got a dividing line, you 
got a high ridge here, Forked River Mountains, and that divides 
it between North Branch and Cedar Creek, and you got the same 
thing between North Branch and Oyster Creek, you got a high 
ridge, and that divides the drainage from one stream into the 
other. 
So they went by that high ridge, and that's your dividing 
line. 
MH 
Does that make sense to you? 
CF Yeah, 
it does. 
I 
think it's alright. 
MH Are you happy where you are with it? 
CF 
I think it's alright for that purpose...for what I'm doing, but 
as far as the value of my land, there's no 
value to 
it. 
You 
know, I couldn't sell 
it, because ... (Somebody walks in). 
land 
management 
CF So you're trying to find out if this 
is a good system? MH 
We're interested in how people traditionally use and manage 
resources, farming, canning and preserving, fishing, clamming, CF 
I used to catch clams. 
I think the bay is being worn out with so 
many people working the bay. 
They're getting about ten cents 
apiece for the clams, which is ten cents more than I got, but 
they're not catching many of them. 
In a day they might catch 500 
to a thousand. 
I used to catch 2500 probably, but still they're 
making more money than I made, because I used to get a penny 
apiece for them. 
I gave it up because there's not much in the 
bay anymore, there's not many clams, and there's too many people 
in the bay. 
LF How did you used to do 
it though? 
CF Well, they still do 
it the same way, they use tongs or 
rakes, you know. MH I know Joe Reid down 
in Waretown, CF Well, he 
used to do the same thing. 
He's a good boatbuilder. 
LF Who 
built yours? 
(goes unanswered as we pore over the map) CF I 
think there was more activity years ago because there was more 
resources, you know. 
Right now the trees are all 
out off or 
burnt off, and there's not much left. 
So what we're trying to do 
is bring it back, but I don't think the average person is doing 
enough to bring it back. 
They're not control burning. 
They're 
stealing cedar. 
If 
it's handy to the shore they steal 
it. 
But I 
got plow lines all 
around the swamp to prevent that. 
It doesn't 
prevent that but it helps. 
It would be so much trouble for them 
even to get started, and I'm up there most of the time watching 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 43 
it, 
you know. 
You gotta be. 
If you got anything these days, you 
gotta protect it. 
That's why I want to live up there. 
Whatever 
you got you gotta be with. 
MH Have you trapped for snapper? 
CF 
You set a box trap, and 
it has a lid, with the bait in 
the middle of 
it, and the snapper pushes the lid up, and once 
he's inside the lid closes behind him. 
You can use a fyke too, 
that's another method. 
There's two or three different methods. 
The box trap 
is what I used. 
It's just a door that when he goes 
in 
it goes up, and when he's in there it goes down. 
MH Like a 
rabbit gum? 
CF Yeah, the same principle. 
MH How do you prepare 
them. 
CF I sold 'em. 
I don't know if I ever ate one. 
Sold 'em 
to restaurants. 
LF 
Snappers eat the small ducks on the 
millpond. CF The ducks, the fish, everything. LF We've seen heads 
that big (shows with hands) sticking out of the water. 
CF 
They 
live 
in all these lakes, but there's not too many anymore. 
But I 
think it's gonna be extinct because they can't come out anywheres 
to 
lay their eggs. 
Everything's being developed so where can 
they go? 
They live 
in fresh water. 
Salt and fresh are separated 
right about at the highway, where the tidal water stops. 
But 
what happens here, see this stream, roughly speaking the 
elevation will raise ten feet every mile, cause you're water is 
runnin' down. 
Back where I'm at you've got about 75 to 100 feet 
elevation, and you're back about four or five miles, right? 
We're not talking about the water, we're talkin' about the hills. 
the water elevation would be about 50 feet. 
I apologize for holding up their dinner. 
They say they're 
not eating anyway. 
"We're on Tom Brown's diet," Cliff joked. 
Lucille said that Cliff could tell me more than anybody around 
about this sort of stuff. 
MH Would you consider yourself a 
woodsman or a bayman? 
CF 
Well, I was a bayman to start out, and 
then I changed to the woods. 
I think I'm a combination of both, 
because I worked for the bureau of navigation for twenty—nine 
years, and all I done was run boats. 
And I worked with the 
engineers, so I'm very familiar with the intercoastal waterways. 
LF 
He lived on boats. 
They used to stake all the channels. 
CF 
We used to stake the channels from Cape May to Sandy Hook. 
And 
so I'm familiar with all that. 
LF In his spare time he would cut 
wood. 
CF I still furnish them with the channel markers, the 
cedar stakes. 
See they use the cedar stakes to mark the edge of 
the channel. 
He worked for the state full—time for 29 years, the bureau 
of navigation, now called the office of shore protection. 
Worked 
for the engineers for 7 years in Toms River. 
CF What I did was 
run boats and used my knowledge of the channels, because, most of 
them didn't know the channels. 
We used to do even the side 
channels, Mullica River, Egg Harbor River, all the rivers. 
We 
staked and buoyed the channels so that people didn't get ashore 
with their boats. 
We used soundin' machines and sounding poles 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 44 
to find the edge of the channel. 
We usually put a stake in, 
roughly speaking, about four or five feet, and that would be your 
edge of your channel, where if you went outside of that edge 
you'd run aground, cause there wasn't enough water. 
But that's 
what we did, mainly was buoy and stake the inland waterways and 
the channels, the rivers. 
MH 
Have other people along the bay developed a foot in both 
worlds? 
CF Oh yeah, there's other people, not many. 
MH Any 
woodsman's association like the bayman's association? CF No, well 
the tree farm association, that's what I'm in, and I'm under the 
supervision of the foresters that they check everything I do. 
When I thin out the trees I have to tell them how much I did and 
they come and inspect it, and then the government pays me 
something on 
it, about $25.00 an acre for what I do. Doesn't pay 
me much but it pays my gas, so 
it's better than nothing. 
I'm 
working for myself, so that helps me a little bit, trying the 
rehabilitate the area. 
It really can't come back because it burns 
too often. 
That last big fire we had burnt this whole area, that 
was 
in 1962. 
So most of my trees is from 1962. 
And they're 
roughly speaking about 15-20 feet tall. 
MH But it didn't burn cedar. CF No. 
It does burn cedar if 
the head fire comes down with a high wind, but normally it don't 
unless there's a wind that drives it through the cedar. 
LF Do 
you know Mr. Shea? 
He's in Trenton, part of the Forestry 
association, and we're invited to a tour. 
Every year the tree 
farmers they pick one out and people tour his tree farm. 
CF I 
was the tree farmer for 1978, and I almost got it this year (the 
award) but there was a guy in Somerset county got it. 
It was 
between me and him. 
MH How come he got it? 
CF Well, he had a 
better tree farm. 
LF Some have Christmas tree farms, some have 
hardwood, some have firewood, we don't have no oak around here 
and the demand for it is so great that they're going to have to 
go to pine, there's no other way. 
MH Do they offer training sessions? 
CF Usually a tour of another tree farm. 
Just keep learning 
new ways you know. 
We start looking at the white cedar box that the family 
bible is housed in. 
CF My mother burns cedar (we could smell 
it coming from next 
door) 
The bible is from about 1800, according to Cliff, from 
before the revolutionary war. He thinks the cedar box helps to 
preserve the fragile book that is falling apart. His father's 
name 
is entered into the record. 
Lucille didn't enter any new 
ones 
in there, they have started another one. 
The writing is 
beautiful. 
LF "The box just slides in there, you don't even know 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 45 
it's there, 
it has a nice cross on the top." 
They keep it on top 
of the dresser in the storage room upstairs.

Russell Canfield, Mary Hufford, Mrs. Canfield 
2MIK: 
Same as Imik 
TX01: G—Manchester; 52GT Our chief of police is named Payne in 
Manchester (related to Harry Payne). 
MH We were talking about 
Mildred Wright, an elderly woman in the township who 
is a bit of 
a local historian, possibly in her 30's. 
Her husband was Harry 
Wright, and Harry Wright Lake in the center of the town is named 
for him. 
RC: Harry Wright was our mayor of Manchester Township for 
many years before Joe Portash 
was mayor, and he 
is a Piney, of a 
very prolific family, and his widow still 
lives on Manchester 
Boulevard in Whiting. 
She would probably give you a lot of 
history of the district that she lives in. 
This is the last 
brochure I wrote, six or seven years ago. 
I've written six of 
them, and see 
if that would be of 
interest. That's the mock—up. 
I wasn't able to print them, because of the cap laws which 
preclude any extra spending in the township. 
MH Ocean County College campus is 
in the township? 
RC This is all Manchester, a lot of Manchester is 
in the 
PineI and s. 
MH Pine Lake Park 
RC That's right across from us here. The other is Harry 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 47 
Wright Lake, up near Keswick (pronounced Kessick). 
They have 
their own lake. 
In 1958 Harry Wright had been looking for the 
proper place to put a lake, which he realized would be a great 
asset to have in Manchester, and in 1958 he was walking through 
the territory up there in Whiting and he said to himself "This is 
the place" 
and he started to get the county workmen working on 
it, 
and he built a dam, and made a beautiful, unpolluted lake to 
this day. 
There's no boating allowed on 
it." 
MH The lake is not on the map. 
RC It's on Lake Road, off of Route 530, right near where a 
railroad track crosses. 
Drink your tea while it's hot. 
MH Is Davenport Cedar Swamp still known as Davenport Cedar 
Swamp? 
RC That I couldn't tell you. 
MH Is Keswick a retirement 
community? 
RC No, 
it was started in 1898 by a minister named 
Raws, and it's been going for 85 years. 
It's a rehabilitation 
center for alcoholics mainly. 
I have a son who's in charge of 
the alcoholic control for the postal service in New Jersey and he 
brings people there too at times. 
It's an alcoholic 
rehabilitation center. 
It's no denomination. 
It's religiously 
oriented, but no denomination. 
MH What's across from it? 
RC 
Crestwood Village, about 15,000 people. 
I know the man who 
started it. 
It's a retirement community. . .Cedar Glen Lakes is 
right near there. 
Roosevelt City is private developers. 
Crestwood is developed by a man name of Mike Kokes. He started to 
build there in 1965. 
MH Who would know the dirt roads? 
RC All through the Pinelands there are dirt roads, and 
you'll find people living in some of them, and the flora and 
fauna are unique in the Pinelands, as you probably know. 
They 
are found nowhere else 
in the world. The million acres in the 
Pinelands, and 37 billion gallons of water under the Pinelands 
which is still pure. I guess you know all this. I lectured on the 
Pinelands a couple times to school children, years ago. 
The Wright family would know the dirt roads. 
Also the Ocean 
County library has great bibliography. 
They have movies that 
they loan of the Pinelands. 
MH Would you say that most of the people in Manchester 
Township live 
in retirement communities? 
RC About four—fifths of 
them live 
in retirement communities. 
There's this one, the first 
senior co—op in the nation. 
I've written brochures about Cedar 
Glen. 
This is our 20th anniversary. We started in 1962, and I 
was a member of the committee that just celebrated our 20th 
anniversary last year. 
We had a banquet down at the Oyster Bay 
restaurant in Forked River. 
It wasn't catered, just the 
restaurant. 
MH Are there places for people 
in these communities to get 
together? 
Large halls? 
RC Yes, we only have one in this 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 48 
community here because we only have 564 units. 
We're the 
smallest senior community in Manchester. 
Cedar Glen West has 824 
apartments; Cedar Glen Lakes has around a thousand; but Crestwood 
is 
really a city in 
itself, 
in fact at one time they were talking 
about seceding from Manchester and calling themselves a town. 
MH Do you think that's too big for a retirement community? 
RC I personally do, yes. 
For instance, we came down here 18 
years ago and there wasn't much traffic. 
Today it's worth your 
life to get through the traffic any time of day. 
In 18 years we 
never envisioned it would be anything like this. 
This county was 
the fastest growing county in the US at one time. 
Today I 
believe it's Orange County in California. 
MH Are there any ethnic settlements in Manchester? RC No, 
never heard of any. MH Where are most people in the retirement 
communities from? RC All over the country. 
No specific place. 
Most of them from North Jersey. 
Mrs. C: They have friends that 
come down and visit them, "Oh how nice it is here" and the first 
thing you know they're moving in. 
MH I noticed the yards are nicely done around here. 
Are 
there any rules for that? 
RC Yes, they are rules that you agree to when you buy a 
share of stock. 
There can be no wash hung outside, there can be 
no picnics except in the picnic area, no 
loud noises after 11:00; 
if you have visitors they can stay no longer than 4 days, unless 
they get special permission; one or the other of the couple has 
to be over 52; 
MH How is this different from your life where you lived 
before? 
RC Goodness yes, we lived 
in East Orange on a dead—end street 
in an eight—room house that we built in 1931 and we sold it 
in 
1965. 
Mrs.: Raised our children, they were all grown up, and we 
rattled around for a little while and came down to visit some 
friends that we have down here. 
RC Practically, excuse me, love, practically all 
of the 
people who move down to these retirement villages in Manchester 
are recommendations from a relative who's living there or a 
friend who's living there. 
In fact, 
in this development, we will 
not let, all 
of our vacant apartments are usually sold to the 
friends or relatives of the people who are living here. 
You 
can't put that into a restriction, that's against the law, but 
they have to have recommendations. 
MH What's your sense of 
living near the Pinelands National 
Reserve? 
How are you aware of that? 
RC 
Well we're right on the edge of the Pinelands in this 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 49 
village here. 
Crestwood is more so 
in the Pinelands, and as you 
know, there's certain places in the Pinelands where building is 
prohibited absolutely, and there are other places in the 
Pinelands where building is allowed with certain restrictions, I 
guess you know all 
this. 
MH How do people in these communities take advantage of 
their closeness to the Pinelands? 
Mrs: People know there's not a lot of roughhousing around, 
or wild talking, or yelling at night, they know that if there's 
anything needed in the house they would send somebody out for 
them. 
We have grown up doing things for ourselves and we came 
here thinking, "Well 
it's my turn to rest. 
Our children are 
grown up and I can live here in peace." 
People know that before 
they come here. 
15 minutes 
MH How about Richie Payne, the chief of Police? 
RC He's been the chief since before we came here. 
Call the 
town hall. 
He'd be a good one to call on for information. 
He's 
a very good friend of mine. 
I've written stories on the police 
department, it's one of the best in the state. 
I'm a newspaper 
writer, I used to write for the Newark Evening News 
(phone 
rings) See who that is, Sweetie? 
MH Do other people from the villages here get as involved as 
you do? 
RC No, I wouldn't say so. 
(The phone call 
is from Dan Clay 
who 
is writing a story on Russ Canfield for the Asbury Park 
Press) 
Mrs: It's been very nice for us here. 
You know we came down 
when Russ was not very well. 
We came down because the man that 
he had worked with a very long time had just moved in down here. 
How he got acquainted I don't know, but he and his wife lived 
down here just a few blocks down from where we are now. 
So when 
Russ got here, he wasn't feeling well so they made us stay 
overnight, and we had the next day. 
They took us all around and 
showed us what this place was like, and they were still building 
up at that far end. And he told us there was a new development, 
where he thought we could go 
if we didn't get in here. 
But 
Russell didn't like the idea of moving into a place that wasn't 
even finished yet. 
So after staying down here for another day we 
went home. 
We had put our house up for sale, and the man who 
bought it needed to move in fast. 
So just like that we hurried 
up and packed and came down here for a couple of nights. 
We were 
going to put our things in storage, but everything doved 
together. 
Our name was on the bottom of the list, but they 
crossed it off and put it at the top. 
This house had been 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 50 
occupied, and the moving van was just moving away as we came up 
this street...and we were all set up in no time. 
It was a very 
good move for us. 
He was not in very good health at that time. 
25 minutes 
MH Have you gotten involved in Manchester 
Township activities the way that he has? 
Mrs. No, but I started working in the nursing home there to 
earn money for a new set of dentures. 
RC 
They're doing a story about me for the Asbury Park 
Press. 
Dan Clay wants me to call him on Tuesday, about my 
activities since I've been retired. 
Fifteen different things 
I've been a head of or a member of since I've been retired. 
Recommends getting in touch with Mike DiGesso of Crestwood. 
MH Did you ever meet a fellow named Les Christofferson? 
RC Yes! I know the name. 
MH He had a huge Martin Palace in back of his house, 112 
rooms. He was going to move into a retirement village several 
years ago, and I wondered if he ever had. 
RC No, I don't know him, just his name.

2MIK: 
TXO1: MH We were talking about the G—Clay Pits; 27GT, driving your 
truck through the clay pits. How many years have you been doing 
that? 
ET When I was seventeen, ten years ago (he started) 
MH It was going on even then? 
ET Yeah, but not as much as 
it 
is now 
MH When did it start getting more popular? 
ET In the last two or three years 
MH Hidden Lakes is also called the Clay Pits? 
ET Yeah 
MH What about the skill 
involved, what's the object of all 
this? 
ET The isn't really an object there, 
if you can go down and 
cross the lake and nobody else can, you know, 
it don't look bad. 
MH What can you do to make the truck better? 
ET You lift the tires on them, 
lift the springs on 
it, 
or 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 52 
you put blocks in between the springs and the rears, and that 
picks the truck up off the springs, then you can get your tires 
under the fenders. 
MH Is 
it always the same guy's truck you go down in or 
somebody else's? 
ET Generally you ride in the same truck 
MH This last casualty was an $18,000 vehicle? 
ET (laughing) Yup 
MH Wasn't the guy sort of heartbroken about it? Did his 
insurance cover it? 
ET He didn't have insurance (laughs) 
MH Tell me what happened 
ET Oh, we was racin' down through the woods, and (laughs) we 
just didn't quite make it! 
They weren't in the clay pits, just in the woods. 
Eddie has 
sometimes been the driver. 
"I've destroyed my share of trucks." 
MH Tell me what it's like. Step by step. 
ET 
Oh, you pull 
in, 
the object is to get there early. 
When 
you get there early the water's not stirred up, and you can set 
up on top and see the holes 
in 
it, cause the water's that dark 
blue where it's deep. 
So you pick out your spot where you want 
to cross at. When everybody gets 
in there you go down and you 
wait for all them to get in where you hit the holes, and when 
they're all stuck and cussin' and mad, you go down and cross the 
lake. 
When you get on the other side, you tell 
'em, 
"Hey! That's 
how it's done!" 
MH So you've been able to scope it out in advance? 
ET Usually! 
MH Can people change the terrain on the bottom by the way 
they're driving? 
ET Yeah, you could add holes to it! 
But during the week 
there's nobody in there, so technically it shouldn't change that 
much, but it does. 
MH How do you account for that? 
ET 
I think it's the clay where it shifts and moves, rain 
raises the water level and makes it deeper. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 53 
MH What about the different varieties of mud? 
ET It's all different. 
Hard clay (is the best for crossing) 
MH Is 
it easier in a dry spell? 
ET Yeah, cause there's not as much water, but, 
MH Has that place ever dried out entirely? 
ET Nah, never. 
There's still natural springs in there that 
feed 
it. 
You can walk down the bottom there and get a cold, good 
drink of water. 
The springs are usually off 
in the hills, the 
water just runs down into the lake. 
MH Do you go 
in the winter? 
ET Oh yeah 
MH What's that like? 
ET Generally when there's ice there and snow we go up 
sledding. 
It's virtually impossible to climb the hills when it's 
snow in'. 
MH What were you saying about slow motion before? 
ET When the truck starts to roll generally, cause you're 
inside, I guess and cushioned from it, 
it feels like it's 
in slow 
motion 
MH What makes a good driver? 
What can he do to keep from 
getting stuck? 
ET You have to be able to steer, and, hopefully you have a 
feeling about which way to go as you're crossing, 
it's like 
diving in a lake. 
You have to know how deep it 
is before you 
jump 
in. 
MH 
How about pulling people out? 
ET Generally a lot of work. 
The winch that we have is a 
small winch, and when you get a truck that's stuck, the mud 
usually creates suction on it, 
so that makes it three times as 
hard to pull out. 
So you gotta know how to hook up snatch box, 
run the cable back and forth and all that, that's a pulley, and 
you see 'em in advertisements all 
the time and the guy's got a 
little piece of string and pickin' up a ton on a little pulley, 
well them blocks are snatch blocks on that rope. 
MH I noticed they had these long ropes on Sunday. 
Do you go 
right up and help them out, or do you tease them a little first? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 54 
ET We 
like to tease people, see if we can get some beer out 
of 
'em, some money, that pays for our beer. (laughs) 
MH The guys on motorcycles looked like they were trying to 
splash people. 
ET Well, they get to be an annoyance up there. 
It's kinda 
hard when you're climbin a hill and a motorcycle's comin down, 
you know. 
Where if you get right to the top of the hill, as 
you're climbin' the hill you lose sight of what's in front of 
you. 
You have the chance of comin' down on top of 
'em, some of 
'em aren't too smart on motorcycles, they don't look. 
MH How about your shock absorbers? 
ET You should put like three in the front and four in the 
backs. 
When you lift 'em you have to change the shocks. Any 
truck, 
if you go to a used car lot, and look underneath the 
truck, 
if 
it's been to the clay mines, you can tell. 
That clay 
gets into everything, and there's no way you can get rid of 
it. 
If you get it on the seats it stains the seats, 
if you get it 
in 
the rugs it's always in the rugs. 
MH So who's the king of the four—wheelers? 
What do you call 
the guys who get stuck? 
ET Dingleberries! 
Fools! 
Everybody gets stuck eventually, 
but there's some that come in and run around in there for the day 
without getting stuck. Not too many. 
MH What was your most scary ride through there? 
ET We met a couple GI's out partying. 
Eventually we got in 
pretty good with them. 
Them boys, the guy that drove the truck 
that they had could definitely drive. He left the other side of 
70, and we went from 70 to here, on roads that he'd never been 
on, and he never took his foot off the floor. All's he did was 
shift gears. 
We was from Mount Misery to here and back 
in 
less 
than twenty minutes through the woods. 
He was flyin. 
We was 
shakin when we got out. 
Re: the situation at the clay pits. 
The twentieth truck 
through has a much harder time than the first one.

2MIK: 
TX01: G—Lebanon Lakes; 27GT They just came back from the cranberry 
bogs, where they were looking for snakes. 
Name? 
One 
is called 
Hidden Lake. 
Frank's grandfather, Mr. John Goriab, owns Lebanon 
Lakes, and much of the surrounding land. 
They look for rattlers, 
pine snakes, racers, hog—nosed. 
Peter has a skin from a hog— 
nosed snake, 
it's soaking right now in salt. 
He learned to do 
that from Freeman Taylor, with whom his brother David lives. 
Robin Keys still 
lives there too. 
Mentions Mr. Emmons. 
Freeman 
used to own all this before Goriab did. 
Paul and Gary are 11 years old, Frank and Peter are 13. 
They often hang out with "Presidential people" (people from 
Presidential Lakes) too. 
They look for snakes, deer , shoot bow 
and arrow back at the bogs, up into the air for practice. 
This 
will be a first year for hunting for Frank and for either Paul or 
Gary (I think its Gary). 
Gary is going out with his mother who 
can chop wood, hunt, fix cars, everything. 
Frank 
can go hunting 
on his grandfather's property. 
On the subject of building forts. 
There 
is one 
in the yard 
where we're standing. There's a slingshot on the roof of it that 
they can shoot rocks from and hit people, people who, 
it turns 
out, hit them with baseball bats. 
Frank likes to go to the pits 
at G—Mount Misery; 27GT and ride his cycle. 
The other three have 
go carts. 
Peter is good friends with Freeman Taylor, who just

took him to the chiropractor today. 
He had a biking accident 
that hurled him over his handlebars. 
recreation, children, game 
Scary places? 
Frank: "When we were their age (meaning Paul 
and Gary) 
it was scary, but 
now I'm used to 
it." 
What were the 
scariest places? 
"Well, some place called 'Hidden Lake', the 
kids said all 
these guys go back there and chase them." Really? 
Where are the guys from? 
"Probably Pineys, hunters, wild 
hunters." There are wild hunters back there? 
"Some guys, yeah." 
Peter: "Freeman used to run dogs back there. 
They run dogs back 
there all 
the time." 
Gary: "Yeah, 
listen to the story." 
Peter 
went with Freeman just the other day when they were running the 
fox. "Millions of dogs all over the place." 
He'd like to get 
some fox dogs. Frank: "I'd like to get a harkin' dog, retriever." 
Freeman just rode by while we were up here, 
in the blue 
truck with the trash cans 
in 
it. "For the pigs." 
Fish to catch 
around here: Pike, catfish, sunfish. 
Peter: "If you're lucky 
you'll catch a bass, every ten years you'll catch a bass." 
"We 
go drag fishing. You know what that is? 
You take a net and you 
go all around the lake, scoop it, 
and it strains the water, and 
you have fish and sunnies and turtles and everything. 
Anything 
that's living in there you get up." 
Frank: "Except bugs." 
Can most people around here do that? 
The consensus is yes. 
Our lake used to be an old cranberry bog, before we were born. 
It's a cedar lake: you go 
in there and you come out brown." 
Frank's grandfather cleaned it out one year. 
Peter: 
"One year 
me, Frankie, Rickie, and John were out in the lake over there, 
and 
it was all drained out, and it was all mucky from the wood, 
and we were havin' a mud fight lookin' for turtles, and we all 
got caught." Frank: "I didn't get caught." "And John was up to 
this deep, his neck, and he was sinkin'. 
and he was on a stump 
and I'm sitting there just trying to push him and pull him, and 
then Ricky got caught, so we had a mud fight, and I hit Ricky in 
the back and they called my name, and I turned around and they 
splatted me right in the face, and we were all caught, just 
foolin' around, goin' "Help! Help!" 
And there were all these 
fire trucks, and someone thought we were really in trouble. 
So 
we got washed off, and when we came down the road there were 
about a hundred cars, and sirens and whistles and ropes and 
ladders and everything. 
Everybody come to save us. 
We got on a 
report for the cops. 
They don't use maps to get around. 
They know names for some 
places, Pakim Pond, Mount Misery. 
How do you tell each other 
where you've been? Peter: "We explain it: 
'the old pine tree' or 
the 'rotten out tree', that's just a tree with a hole in 
it that 
squirrels live 
in. " "We had three pet squirrels one time. 
My 
brother Danny was taking out trash for somebody one time, and 
there were four little squirrels but he didn't know it, 
and he 
stepped on one by accident and he killed it. And we kept the 
other ones and they lived so that their tail was all fluffy and

everything. And we gave 'em to Freeman, and he had 'em 
in a cage 
for a while and then he opened it up and let 'em go free. The 
little runt died." 
Do most people take animals to Freeman? 
Peter: "A lot of 
people. 
He has a rattlesnake right now, this thick." 
Would you 
ever handle it? 
"I pet it...We were walkin' around through 
there, lookin' at the pigs and stuff, and he had 
it out, and was 
gonna let 
it sun itself and go to the bathroom, and kept on 
walkin' back and forth in his front door, and we came back again 
and there it was goin' up the steps tappin' 
its nose on the door 
wantin' to come in." Me: (incredulous) "Really? 
Are they that 
smart?" "Well he had 
it ever since it was this thick, and he 
taught it. 
It likes Freeman." 
Photographing the fort. 
Gary and Paul mostly hang out in 
it. 
They talk about special features, built from plywood and 
scraps. 
Furnished with a chair. 
"You can just go inside and 
look at books." 
The older guys had one with a carpet and mirrors 
on the ceiling and walls and "blankets hanging down so you can't 
see out. 
That was our best fort." 
Frank: "Then on our second 
one we had doors with hinges. 
We had a big chair there. 
Somebody wrecked it, though. 
Do you ever tell your parents where your fort is? Peter: Uh, 
I sorta had to...I don't really care 'cause none of us really do 
anything wrong back there. 
It's just a place to go when there's 
nothing to do and sit around, and 
if you're tired, just go there 
and take a nap. 
Take a radio back there. 
We 
let girls back 
there, even little kids, cause if we didn't, when we're not there 
they'd just go back there and destroy it, so we just say, 
if 
we're not there go ahead back there and do anything you want, 
except destroy it, except for Jason. 
Re: a friend who made a nice fort up in the air (a tree 
house.), 
Brian Clark. It's in his backyard. 
It's 
pretty neat. 
Tree houses are now illegal. 
"My brothers used to make 'em all 
the time, and then the state come and made you tear 'em down and 
so you couldn't make 'em anymore. 
Mr. Goriab was tellin' us not 
to use any more nails, and we already done it so we just left one 
board up 
in the tree that was gonna support the whole fort and 
the rest was on the ground. 
The trees were about eight feet 
apart and it slanted down so the rain would go down, and the 
entrance was about this big, and you would have to climb under. 
It came from his brother's truck. But then the girls painted it 
pink and stuff. 
Peter: They painted it white with pink polka 
dots so we just destroyed it.

We're at the fort in the backyard. 
It's a typical

kid fort because it has so many spots that you can see through, 
and because it's so small, and because it has a slingshot. Gary 
took the slingshot off because it was leaning too much. 
Frank: 
We like to hide our forts. 
The older guys are 
instructing them on supporting the slingshot on the roof for the 
purpose of the picture. 
Paul's sister is calling him. 
A hammer 
is being employed. 
Peter: That's one thing, we try to keep the 
outside of our fort neat. 
Paul: 
But we're not finished building 
it. 
His friend Brian is going to supply him with some shingles. 
He's "kind of" a member of the fort. 
Do people ever call these shacks? 
No, just forts. 
Shacks 
are something people live 
in. 
Have you ever been to any gunning clubs? 
Freeman took Peter 
to one, way back in the woods, where you would all 
of a sudden 
just find it, 
it was hard to 
look for. 
Chatsworth is supposed to 
have a nice gunning club. 
Paul: "Oops! My pants ripped." 
A whole argument ensues, 
over whether the rip 
is too big for Paul to be able to change his 
position in my presence. 
"I knew this would happen," he said. 
"Do you want to go on the inside?" I asked. "Uh, I can't go 
nowhere," he replied. "Let me see 
it, Paul", said Frank. "There's 
nothing to 
it," said Gary. 
"Just go in there, you can't even see 
it." 
Discussion of blueberry fields around: Thompsons, Chickie 
Pepper's, Adams, but they're down in Chatsworth. 
Story about 
getting shot at by a lady when they used to pick blueberries in 
what she thought was her field. 
"Her shack burned down." 
We go to see the older boys fort, which they claim is 
in 
terrible shape. 
Re: snake hunting, how hog—nosed snakes play 
dead. 
They take snakes into the Chatsworth School. 
They have 
nice pits down 
in Chatsworth, you can ride motorcycles there and 
find things there. 
Reporting on feeders in his front yard, sometimes he watches 
the birds there. 
They found a sickly young woodpecker, (Peter 
and his brother Kelly), "We would get at the bottom step and then 
toss 'im so he'd try to fly, then it got to the top and dropped 
straight down and killed itself. " 
"Does this path have a name?" 
Peter: "Naw, I think it's an 
old deer path, and they just walked on 
it and made it 
into a 
regular path ... Is there anything left of our old fort, Frank? 
Is 
the rug still there?" 
Frank: "That's all." 
"Shouldn't 'of 
left 
it there, 
it's all pink, 
isn't it?" 
"Uh—huh." 
Peter still has a 
lump on his foot from where a nail went in. 
The fort is 
beautiful on first impression, but it's been laid waste on the 
other three sides. 
I ask them if they plan to renovate: 
Frank: "I think we're gonna change spots, go across the lake 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

so nobody finds it except us." 
How can you hide it? 
"What we 
used to do, we had it hidden good, but it only lasted for about a 
year, we cut down Pine trees, pine tree limbs and stuck 
it all 
around the sides. 
And then we had leaves on the roof, because it 
was a yellow roof, yellow metal shingles on the top, we had em 
all 
up the sides, real tall ones, and 
it was just a hole you 
could get into, and we'd climb through there, and we had a little 
board that you would pull up when you'd get inside, and then, I 
forget what happened, but someone tore it down, and we just said 
forget it, we come back and everything was just brown and crumbly 
on the ground, but it lasted for a long time. 
"How did you keep 
people from following you?" 
Peter: "We just come in from every 
different way." 
Plants they are familiar with: Sassafrass, Lady slippers, 
Indian Soap, Indian Pipes, 
Cedar, (don't recognize the name of 
Sheep Laurel, but recognize it from the description) 
Peter has 
made sassafrass tea, his mother made the tea, and they would 
drink it all the time. 
"It's just something her mother used to 
do, I guess." 
They came from Syracuse, New York.

Frank: "People used

stopped doin' 
it. " Peter is the youngest of five boys. 
He 
doesn't live with his father anymore, who lives in Maryland, but 
who 
is moving to New Jersey. G—Lebanon Lakes; 27GT 
The only way that little kids can find them is when they 
hear them banging, hear the hammers banging. 
When they were 
little kids they used to try to find forts, but the big kids then 
made them up real high so you couldn't get into 'em. Peter, 
Frankie, Johnny and Rickie were working on an underground fort 
behind Peter's house. 
It's getting pretty deep. 
"We used to 
come home from school and spend hours working, and then we'd go 
and do something else that we wanted to do. 
Then we had some 
sheet metal across the top, and somebody who was being nosey 
stepped on 
it and bent it 
in, 
so we figured someone knew it was 
there so we just stopped building it.

The forest trails: Freeman goes back there lookin' for 
spotlighting, he looks for deers, raccoons, Frankie: "Were you 
with us when we found the deer back there on the fire trail?" 
Peter: "I used to ride my bike back there all 
alone, you know the 
LeFebres (?) You know where they live? 
The Foxes? 
Marcy Ables? 
If you keep followin that road all 
the way down (past Freeman's), 
there's houses back there with horses and, I rode my bike back 
there one time and I heard these things in the woods, there's a

whole lot of 
'em, and I kept on ridin', I'm tryin' to 
look for 
the deer, and all 
of a sudden all 
of 'em started jumpin' across 
the road right in front of me. 
I stopped and I just had a heart 
attack." 
"What did you hear?" 
"I just heard all 
this walking, 
when I hear something walking, I think it's hurt, so I go and try 
to find it, think I'll get something for a pet or something, and 
I started gettin' off my bike and there they came runnin' right 
at me, jumpin' acrosst the street." 
Peter's brother married a girl from Chatsworth. They build 
forts down there too. 
They estimate that there must be millions 
of forts in the woods. 
Peter: "People always abandon them." 
Frank: 
"Across the lake there's a chicken coop and a little pig 
coop, 
in the wintertime we skate across there and we had bonfires 
and stuff." 
They go to see swans, snow geese, beaver, mallard 
ducks, whooping cranes on the bogs. 
Peter: "When I had my mini 
bike we'd go, me and my brother, and a couple other people, we'd 
go back through the cranberry bogs, when you go across the road, 
it's like a water crossing, two streams meet there, and it's nice 
and cool, we'd go swimming there, drag netting there, and fishing 
back 
in the bogs...Is this the first time you been here, Gary? 
"My second time," said Gary. 
"This is my first time," said 
Paul,"I never even knew this thing was around." 
Peter: "We're 
going to make one farther away the next time, I'm going to get 
David to drop off the wood for us, 
in his truck." 
Ant Lions: 
Peter: "Me and Frank used to go around his 
house, and blow the holes, blow the sand so the sand would fly 
out and there would be the ant lion, and then we would have this 
frisbee and stick all kinds of ant lions in there, put ants 
in 
there and watch the ants get trapped, 
it was neat, you would see 
the lion come out of the ground and grab the ant and pull 
'im in 
there." 
Frank: We saw a praying mantis. 
Paul: We even blow up 
frogs (giggles nervously) Peter: Who does that? (disapproving) 
Paul: Gary and me, sometimes Mike (?). 
Blow 'em up with 
firecrackers. Frank: That's sick. Peter: That's gross. Paul: I 
think it's neat. 
I like blowin up crickets. 
They go all 
over 
the place. 
Peter: The only thing I like to blow up is, 
you know 
them Iittle bushes, they have red things on 
'em, green bushes 
with little red things? 
Me: Holly? 
Peter: No, they're in 
peoples front yards, 
little bushes, 
little berries on 
'em, we put 
a pile of them and stick firecrackers on 
it, 
and blow it all 
up 
and juice flies everywhere (yews?). 
We have berry fights with 
it. We make models and blow 'em up. 
Car models, and when we get 
bored of 
'em we just blow 'em up. 
Me: Do you ever make miniature 
villages? 
Peter: Me and the Abbotts, they used to have big tall 
banks and we'd dig holes and put army men up, get on the other 
side and throw rocks at 'em. 
(Chorus: Yeah, we always did that) 
Peter: then when I was 
in Maryland staying with my father I had a 
speed boat, a plastic model with a motor, I made it, we had it 
going around a pier, and me and my father were out there shootin' 
at 
it, blowin' 
it up. 
It sunk way out, and I had to go out the 
next day and get it out.

MH: Did you find any pine barrens tree frogs around here? 
Peter: I never saw one, but, 
Frank: I found a green one with 
orange on 
it.

MH: This is your screen on here, 
wonder what it used to be? 
Did 
it used to be 
in the house? 
(Yeah) 
(Airplane flying 
overhead, difficult to hear) 
They have matching furniture in the 
fort. 
Peter: Me and Buddy came back here one time, that couch 
was right here, and the chair was over there, and Buddy opened 
the door and there was a cat sittin' there growlin' at 'im. 
He 
goes: There's a cat in there! 
I said, "What's a matter 
witchyou." He goes, "There's a cat!" 
I looked in there and the 
thing started growling at me and everything. 
I went in there 
slowly and 
"WROWREOR" and I touched him on the head and he goes, 
"BTFSPLK" (raspberry). 
This little cat. 
Frank: Then my friend 
took a b—b gun and he shot it. 
Peter: He was trying to get it 
away from the fort. Frank: It went up 
in a tree and he shot at 
it 
about five times. Peter: He was a mean kid. Frank: I hate him. 
Gary: I do too. I hate his guts. 
MH: Let's see the other fort. 
Peter: There's probably nothing left but the carpet. 
Frank: 
Yeah. 
Peter: See, they had polka dots all over everything. (Big 
blotchy pink polka dots. 
MH: Do you ever try to put different 
rooms 
in the fort too?

Good ambience. 
Auctioning free puppies, yo—yos, brand new 
backgammon set, coat racks for kids (a clown and a unicorn) for 
$8. musical jewel box ($30.00, $20.00, $22.50) a wetting baby,

auctioneer, and a vociferous floorwalker, and the crowd. 
A horse trailer. 
"Who said 50 cents?

Two big rabbits, two and a half, three, a half, three. 
Good stretches all through.

The auctioneer can be heard as the 
recordist moves about from case to case 
in the auction, picking 
up sounds of pigs grunting, and a bystander gobbling, both in 
imitation of turkeys, and eating hotdogs. 
With respect to the 
auction, one fellow commented, "Well usually, 
if you get up 
in 
the morning and you find something missing out of your yard you 
come here 
in the evening and you find it." 
Someone's giving away 
free kittens. 
The fellow commented that his son gets eggs from the kiddie 
zoo and brings them home and raises them. 
Rabbits are being 
sold. 
Exotic species get into the Pinelands that way. 
A complex event. 
People drinking coffee in the corner. 
People wending their way through the crowd with puppies and 
kittens to give away. 
One woman gave away a whole litter in no 
time at the last auction. 
One startled duck looked like a 
character from the comic strip "Bloom County". 
Another fellow goes to the flea markets at Columbus and New 
Egypt with some regularity as well. 
He's from Toms River. 
He 
buys plants mostly. 
He's a school teacher. 
Great sounds of a pig squealing, sold for $19.00, to Mr. 
Carpenter. 
The week before that they sold a hundred horses. 
Now 
he's selling call ducks and hens. 
TX02: The fellow I'm talking to points out a muleskinner to me. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

He hunts coon from a mule, all over the pines. 
He lives down 
Four Mile Circle. 
He uses Walker Hounds. 
Maryland Hounds are 
only used for fox. 
Maryland is a little slower and puts out a 
lot more mouth. 
Walkers are not as mouthy and tend to be a 
little faster on the track. 
fox chase 
A pair of bob white quail. 
He has lots of friends that coon hunt around here. 
The club 
member is Dave Clemons, he lives down 206 on Stagecoach Road. 
He's the president of the club. 
They mostly hunt around G—Mt. 
Misery; 27GT, around G—Lebanon State Forest; 27GT, down 
in 
G—Tabernacle; 25GT, and down the G—Wharton Tract; 26GT. 
Lebanon is 
not so bad at night. 
TX03: His name 
is Bill Jenkins. 
He's from South Carolina. 
He 
operates the water plant at Fort Dix. 
He lives a half mile from 
Four Mile Circle, on Barnegat Road. He lives 
in G—Southampton; 
23GT, but everything around him is Lebanon Forest. 
He bought 
there so he wouldn't have too many neighbors. 
The difference 
between mules and horses, mules are supposed to be more sure— 
footed. 
They get so when a dog starts runnin' they'll move 
toward them. 
About ten of them have mules, and last week they 
had a mule show. 
We should have been there. 
About once a year 
they have it. 
They show dogs and mules. 
They get the mules to 
jump. 
(They can jump, you know, 
like deers). 
A barrel race, a 
pole race, a ribbon race. 
They hold a string, two guys, one on 
each mule, try to race around the course as fast as possible 
without losing the string. 
Then a speed race. "I won the speed 
race...A jenny is smaller. 
We use the bigger type mules." 
Some 
kids are getting interested in mules. 
Maryland has a lot more 
mules than we have. 
Lot of 
'em in Pennsylvania. 
They don't 
deserve the reputation for being ornery any more than a horse. 
A 
lot of people say "stubborn as a mule" but I've seen horses as 
stubborn as a mule." 
And horse sense, mules are very smart, you 
know, very smart. 
Pigeons, 
lots of varieties. 
Racing, homing, polack, 
lots of 
them. 
When he got out of the service he came here to 
live 
because this 
is where his parents live, so he got a job at Fort 
Dix. 
Jenkins is a common name here, but "a 
lot of 
'em are a 
different color." 
TX04: G—Tabernacle; 25GT 
One woman comes here for plants, 
especially around Easter. 
They're very reasonable here.

A gentleman recalls attending this kind 
of auction in Eulin(?), 
in Mantua (?), years ago. 
Doesn't 
remember the auctioneers. 
He comes here every other week, not 
necessarily intending to buy. 
He lives in Wading River, 
in 
Washington Township. 
There's three Washington Townships in the 
state. 
He worked for the railroad, but last year they bought his 
job off. 
Wants to know where I'm from. 
To him Freehold, NJ 
means Horse Country. 
Though lots of people buy horses and other 
animals here he comes for "accessories," alarm clocks and things 
like that. 
You see a lot of brass here, coming from Hong Kong. 
I don't know whether it's our artillery shells that we shot at 
'em over there years ago or not. 
He doesn't bring things here to 
sell. 
He retired from the Pennsylvania—Reading Railroad. 
Thirty— 
seven years. 
They gave him $20,000 to retire last year. 
He can 
officially retire this year when he turns 60. 
Complains about 
inability to build, because of Pinelands. 
He expects to hunt 
some when he retires, but not for deer, which he feeds. 
He also 
has a birdfeeder, a lot of bluejays: "And they're the biggest 
robber there is, bluejays. " He's seen them robbing. 
Not too 
many robins, a few parrots, knob parrots, that have escaped from 
people. 
Has to have a fence, the deer eat anything that doesn't 
move. 
He runs across young ones. 
He never belonged to hunting 
clubs or fire companies. 
Comments on the wild turkeys they sell 
up here. 
"You know what a ferret will do? 
They will get rid of 
all 
the rats there is. 
Get 'em by the throat and kill 
'em." 
(Demonstrates.)

His name is Elwood Watson, of Wading River. 
Mentions the 
auctions by Mullica Hill and Elmer. 
A woman passes by giving 
away puppies, a mixture of purebred coonhound (blue tick) and a 
mutt. 
The mother's the coonhound. 
Another fellow nearby says 
he coonhunts with horses, since his mule almost killed him. 
A little girl, who lives on a farm in Lumberton. 
An animal 
farm, her dad milks cows. 
She comes here every week. 
A long uneventful stretch. 
A young woman. 
They come on Friday, the first and third 
Friday of each month is horse night, every Thursday is junk 
night. 
They come from Mount Holly. 
What they like about it 
is 
that you never know what you're going to see here. 
She and her 
husband are into horses. 
Some people come just for something to 
do. 
A good time to come 
is 
at Christmas, when they sell all 
brand new toys, 
many of them for half price, from stores that 
are going bankrupt. 
She's from Saint Michael's, on the Eastern 
Shore of Maryland. 
She's been a jockey in horse races. 
They 
raise thoroughbreds, and race them at Keystone, Atlantic City, 
Meadowlands, Garden State. 
Sulky racing is an entirely different 
thing, standard bred horses. 
Trotters are their competition, 
pacers are standard bred, but move differently. 
A race horse is 
much greater than a hunter. 
Her name 
is Patience Gower, lives on 
630, a block away from 206. 
William Cricket's farm.

Talking with a fellow who came here from 
Edinburgh, Scotland. 
Thick brogue. 
"I came here 
in 1964. 
I go back every two years or so, you 
know. 
But it's always nice to come back. 
I love 
it here, 
it's a 
great country. " 
What brought you here? 
"Well, there's so many things, I just wanted a change, you 
know. My cousin, he had come over, and I asked him lots of things 
about America, and he says, 
'Why don't you come over?' and I 
says, 
'Well, maybe I'll come over for a wee while, you know. ' 
And I come over here, and as soon as I come over here, I had 
about four or five big cases hangin' all over me at Kennedy 
Airport, and when I came off of the airport, I walked towards 
this big door and the door opened by itself. 
And, you know, I 
didn't want to 
lay all these big cases down, and when I seen the 
door open, I said, 
'If they're that smart here I'm going to stay 
right here. ' " 
They have auctions in Scotland, with auctioneers that speak 
faster than Harker. 
They have them in the big cities every 
Saturday. 
Every two or three weeks he comes here. 
He 
lives 
in 
Williamstown, two miles past (?) on the Black Horse Pike. 
We 
live a little bit south of Sicklerville, Gloucester County. 
He 
came to see if he could get one or two calves. 
He has a couple 
of horses and cows. 
We 
like animals. 
A bay mare, 15 hands.

"It's like a pet, actually, 
it's like a pet dog. 
When I come 
home at night it hee—haws and everything at me, just like a dog 
would bark ... We don't grow much, everything on a half—an—acre, 
and I give most of 
it away, to friends and the boys at work. I 
work on the USS Forrestal, working on the ship. 
I was on the 
Saratoga for a year. 
Not in the Navy. 
Overhauling the boat. 
Had shipbuilding experience in Scotland. 
I reminded him that the 
Beatons were from Scotland, a large boatbuilding concern in Point 
Pleasant. 
He's only met three Scottish families since he's come 
to the country. 
He went to Kearney, (North Jersey) once. 
Plenty 
of Irish and Italians, but not many Scots people, no Scottish 
men. Scotland's a rich little country, plenty of 
industry. 
Not 
many people leave. 
It's different here too, we don't have 
cornfields in Scotland, or sweet potatoes. 
We grow beet roots, 
cabbage, potatoes. 
We grow a lot of turnips in Scotland, and you 
don't get them here much. The preparation is different, too. 
"Here the Americans when they cook turnips they boil them and 
that's it. 
Well, we boil 
'em and then we fry 'em with ham, and 
oil." 
"I 
lost my wife when my little boy was born. I raised him 
myself, there's just the two of us. 
She died the day he was 
born. We're happy, we have a good time. 
We go everywhere 
together." 
Other cooking here 
is the same, steak, potatoes, 
bacon and eggs. 
Not Italian or Polish food. 
Not many ethnic 
groups in Scotland. 
In big cities in Scotland the Italians own 
ice cream cafes. 
ethnicity, outsiders, foodways 
The Scots do very little fishing and hunting, and he doesn't 
do 
it here himself. 
Working people can't obtain firearms in 
Scotland. 
You need references from the banker, priest, 
neighbors. 
Even police don't carry them. 
What about the terrain in this country, the look of the 
land? Does anything in South Jersey remind you of Scotland? 
No, nothing. I haven't seen anything in this country, but I 
haven't travelled this country too much, I haven't had much time. 
One part that did interest me very much, that looked a little 
like where I come from was in Lancaster in Pennsylvania. 
It's a 
little bit hilly up there. But Jersey is out. 
There is nothing 
in Jersey that would remind you of Scotland. 
Was that hard for you to get to like? Do you think New 
Jersey is beautiful? 
aesthetics, landscape 
Well, truthfully, New Jersey's a great state to 
live 
in, 
I'm very happy here, I work fifty—two weeks a year, but I don't 
think there's any beauty in 
it, other than the homes themselves. 
I don't think there's any real beauty in 
it. 
When I say real 
beauty, I like to see woods, I like to see mountains, 
high 
mountains like where I come from. They go way high, I mean, Ben 
Nevis is, I think, the second or third highest mountain in the 
world. 
And there's lochs and rivers, and that is beauty. 
When 
you drive your car from the North of Jersey to the South of 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 71 
Jersey you don't see nothing but highways. Highways is all 
you 
see and there's nothing else. (What about the Pine Barrens?) 
Some of them are nice, but see, I'm more used to high country. 
When you're driving through some of the hills 
in Scotland, could 
be seventy degrees, and you look way up about 5 or 6 thousand 
feet in the sky and you see mountains going into the clouds are 
covered with snow. 
That's fantastically beautiful. 
An artist 
couldn't paint some of the scenery there, it's so gorgeous. 
There's one part in Bonny Strath Ayre. In fact there's a lot of 
beautiful songs about Strath Ayre. 
Going a way up Strath Aire 
(?) road there's a lot of wee thatched cottages, with the 
thatched cottage roofs, you know, 
and on the left side there's 
what they call the Scottish Bluebell, 
it's a little flower, 
it's 
on a green stem. 
And there's a little deep purple loop on 
it and 
it 
looks like 
the shape of a bell. 
And inside that there's a 
wee white bud, and they call that the blue bells of Scotland, and 
there's a beautiful song about that. 
Now mixed through that 
there's what they call white heather. 
White heather. 
The ladies 
have a perfume called white heather, Scottish White Heather 
perfume, and it's a beautiful scent. 
Now on a windy day you get 
the bluebells and the white heather blowin' with each other and 
you would actually think the whole mountain was movin. 
It's a 
beautiful thing to see. 
Really gorgeous. 
And the odor that 
comes off that mountain is unbelievable. 
You could stand there 
all 
day, 
it's so nice. 
It's like standin' beside a beautiful 
woman, all perfumed up." 
Nothing quite matches that for him in New Jersey. 
There's 
some places in Pennsylvania. 
When it comes to real beauty I'm 
sure that anyone from New Jersey who has ever been to Europe 
would have to admit that there's nothing like the other side. 
His grandparents from his mother's side are from Donegal. 
He spent lots of time in Ireland. 
The auctioneer again, geese, and chickens. 
A fellow who has horses is talking to me. 
"You get caught 
up 
in the fever of everything. You come down here not looking for 
anything in particular, and you pick up a duck or a rabbit or a 
sulkie. (He has sulkies, race horses.) 
He likes the silkies, 
polish show chickens. 
Discussion re: New Jersey as biggest 
horse state outside of Kentucky. 
English call ducks, eaten by 
many, even kept as pets, though foxes and weasels like to eat 
them too. 
Golden pheasants sold here. 
Breeder associations. 
You have to be here 
in advance to 
look over what's for sale. 
Sometimes a silkie bird or a polish chicken will bring $9.00 
other days it'll bring $3.00. 
He lives 
in Mount Holly, and comes 
more steadily in the winter than 
in the summer. 
It's good 
entertainment. 
It's almost as good as watching a parade. Almost 
every character is here. 
There's some real characters. 
There's 
a fellow, Mr. Jones? 
a colored fellow, he's real nice, everybody 
likes him.

Regarding the people in the bleachers, they're mostly just 
here for the show. 
The serious buyers are 
in the sawdust, so to 
speak. 
Scott McPherson again. He also does home remodelling. 
Most 
of the houses in South Jersey are remarkable because they're 
built of wood, not of stone like 
in Scotland. 
The roof, the 
floors and the doors are built of wood there, but nothing else 
is. 
Most wood 
in Scotland is well seasoned, because they don't 
use as much of 
it. 
They use wood in houses here that was 
standing two months before. 
His house is made of brick. 
His 
living room is 25 feet by 25 feet, the interior done 
in old 
English Tudor style with a micah (?) fire place.

background. The chorus follows suit, and she fills in around

into the accompaniment.

TXO1: Discussion of Asbury Park Press newspaper article, about 
the project. 
Harry wants to know whether we got any folklore 
music from around G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
"They used to play violins 
and banjos, I don't know whether any of the younger generation 
picked it up or not. I'm acquainted with a lot of folks down that 
way, but most of them have passed, because they would be ten 
years older than I. 
But they used to have jamborees, down, well 
there's a new hotel there now, what was its name? 
The amusement 
place they used to have? 
Hedger House." 
The new owner is from Philadelphia. 
But he thinks they 
still have their jamborees there. 
TX02: Mrs. Payne sat in the other room until I asked whether she 
wasn't going to come 
in and sit with us.

I think that our coming here dates back to about 1822, 
when Anthony Hamilton came from Langhorn, Pennsylvania. 
He was 
my father's grandfather. 
He was of Indian heritage, I don't know 
exactly what tribe. 
My father's father was a slave. 
He was from 
Virginia, John Payne was his given name. 
He formerly came from 
Barbados, and was sold as a slave, 
in Pennsylvania, and taken to 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 86 
Virginia as a youngster. 
My grandfather couldn't read or write. 
When they checked back, when he bought property, they found out 
instead of his name being Penn 
it was Payne. 
Hamilton was on his 
father's mother's side. 
My father's mother was Anthony 
Hamilton's daughter. 
She married John Payne. 
One was red 
Indian, one was West Indian. 
(Barbados) 
He met her here, right 
here 
in Jersey. G—Whiting; 52GT 
MH How did he get from Virginia to New Jersey? 
HP He walked. 
Yes ma'am. 
He walked from some'eres in the 
vicinity of Charlottesville, across the state of Maryland, the 
state of Delaware. 
This was free territory, and when he got here 
he got a job 
in a brickyard. blacks 
Doesn't know the name of the brickyard. 
"At that time there 
were several brickyards around here. Now where he got his job was 
just where Manchester Boulevard starts, on route 70. 
That's 
between here and Lakehurst. 
That's where he worked, makin brick. 
MH When you go by there do you think of him? 
HP I go by 
there, but I don't think of his working there. 
There 
is a part 
of the brickyard, just before you get to that new development 
there, they have a small shopping center. 
You can see where the 
brick kiln was. 
There's some of the bricks there yet. 
HP 
My mother was from South Carolina, Buford. 
My mother 
went from SC to Providence, Rhode Island and then came from there 
into Jersey...I think she came to North Jersey and came down this 
way. She was, maid service. 
Housework. 
domestic work 
MH How did she meet your father? 
HP 
I think it was at a camp meeting, an outdoor camp 
meeting. 
They still have the outdoor meetings down around 
Williamstown, but not up this way, Deerfield too. 
MH Denomination? 
HP To me they are more like the Southern Baptists, because I 
have been to some of their camp meetings. 
At that time I was 
working down there, and I went down on Sunday, and they start 
around nine o'clock in the morning, and a different minister will 
come one there and preach an hour or so, and then there'll be a 
rest period. They usually have five ministers preaching all 
day, 
and everybody brings some sort of food, and the whole 
congregation is fed, free of charge. religion, foodways 
They have chicken, beef, greens, cheeses, cake, pies, you 
name 
it. 
It's something to see. 
Usually happens after June. 
I'll tell you the way it comes about. 
It'll be 
in one 
section for one Sunday, and then another where there's another 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 87 
pastor on another Sunday. 
In earlier times they didn't go too 
far. 
His mother's name was Minerva Watson. 
My father was 
widowed, and he had seven children by the first wife, and nine by 
another. 
I'm from the second marriage. 
GP When they ate they 
had a long table and benches (laughing). 
HP That was 
in the 
house that burned down, about 300 yards from here, 
in 1950. 
GP 
There's six families of Paynes right in Whiting. 
HP At one time we were the only black family in the 
vicinity. 
By intermarriage that changed, and the black 
population grew, people came from other parts of Jersey and 
married our cousins and our sisters and whatnot. 
MH Is there a connection between here and South Toms River? 
HP None whatsoever. 
Because there was such a few of us here 
in 
Whiting that we joined the church in Toms River, and some joined 
in Lakewood, because we didn't have enough population here. 
HP We had a grammar school here in Whiting, and from that I 
went to high school 
in Lakewood, by bus. 
MH How did you start out working every area between Berlin 
and Freehold? 
HP Well I go out of high school 
in 1928, and I took a course 
in vocational school for two years, became a general mechanic, 
auto mechanic, got out of school, had no money to start a 
business on my own, so I started making charcoal to sell to the 
roofers, mostly to the roofers. 
They used to use charcoal pots 
to heat their tar when they repaired and put on new roofs. 
MH How'd you learn to make charcoal? 
HP Stanley Giberson come up here and he was looking for 
somebody to make charcoal. 
Seemed like the merchant that he had 
bought it from had passed and he couldn't get anybody that was 
reliable, so I was here with my mother and father living home, 
and he asked me would I try 
it 
if he would show me how to do 
it, 
and I told him yes. 
That was 
in 1934, so that's how it began. 
I 
started and then some of the other fellas they didn't have 
anything to do and rather than go to the CC camp, they started 
makin charcoal and 
it got to be quite an industry up until, well, 
during the second world war, sold quite a bit then to make 
ammunition. 
Charcoal ground and powdered and dried took the 
chemicals to make gunpowder. 
Whiting was the center of the 
concentration of effort to make charcoal. 
Stanley Giberson was 
from Indian Mills. 
Giberson, an old name. 
They were the first in Whiting. 
GP 
There was four families in Whiting when you were born, right? 
HP 
maybe five. 
GP Anyway, there was three births the same day, 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 88 
including you. 
HP That was Harry Britton, Leslie Christofferson, 
and Harry Payne. 
MH I met him a few years ago. 
HP No doubt you did. 
MH He said he was moving into a retirement community. 
HP He moved into Holiday City. 
Been seein him in church, 
during midsummer of 
last year, at the Methodist Church here 
in 
Whiting. 
He belongs to another one now, a non—denominational 
one. We were in the same class, just like brothers. 
Throughout 
our lives we worked together, shovelling gravel 
in the gravel 
hole, and Leslie, he worked with wood. 
He became a very good 
carpenter. 
He was foreman on many jobs after he grew up. 
He was 
a carpenter on heavy construction in the building trade. 
He was 
a member of the union until he retired. 
MH Your associations? 
HP I was self—employed most of the time, makin charcoal, 
cuttin pulpwood, then I joined the labor union, heavy 
construction. 
occupations 
MH Did you find yourself managing certain sections of woods 
to encourage the growth etc.? 
HP It wasn't necessary back 
in those days, but now it 
is, 
and you have to keep a certain amount of trees growing per acre. 
It wasn't a law then, the environmentalists hadn't moved in on us 
then. 
MH Did you have ways of making sure you always had a 
resource. 
land management 
HP At that time there was the Manchester Land Company, and 
they owned thousands of acres and they were always glad to sell 
it off, especially after there had been a forest fire to burn it. 
The pine would only die, the oak would sprout and come back, but 
the pine wouldn't. 
So they would sell 
it off before it decayed 
and fell down in order to get some money for it. 
MH I heard pine trees would come back. 
HP Pine trees will stand more fire than oak, 
it will kill 
oak, but pine trees will 
rot too. 
but the only pine trees that 
will survive a fire are the very large ones. 
And they seeded the 
terrain again, and that's why a pine forest will spring up. The 
oak springs up because it's hardwood from the roots, but the pine 
won't. 
The pine'II die after about, oak'll die 
in one year, pine 
in four, but eventually it'll die. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 83 
MH Did you ever do much control burning or anything like 
that? 
HP None whatsoever. 
MH It didn't seem necessary? 
HP Back 
in that time there wasn't any control burning here at 
all 
if a forest fire got out we would just backfire from some of 
the roads into the woods till we headed it off. 
MH Did you have training for that? 
HP If a forest fire was to start on the north side of route 
70 and its coming from the north coming south, then you'd start 
on route 70 and fire toward whichever way the wind was blowing. 
You'd get ahead of 
it and let a fire eat in, 
and by the time the 
fire that was coming with the wind got to it that was it. 
It 
wouldn't go any farther. 
MH How would you keep the fire that you started from going 
into the wind? 
HP Because we would put it right along the road, use the 
roads for firelanes, and fire that against the other fire that 
was coming toward it. 
We'd get 25 or 30 fellas together and 
string fire along the road and let 
it eat in. 
If a fire doesn't 
get too big a start on you and there isn't too much wind, of 
course, fire makes its own wind. If you fire maybe a quarter of 
a mile a fire will very seldom jump more than a quarter mile at a 
time. 
Course sometimes it'll carry farther. 
MH Have the methods for fighting fire changed much? 
HP I would say yes, because we didn't have any plows to 
plough firelines, and now they go 
in with tanks and trucks to 
spray, and they go 
in with tank trucks and they either use 
chemicals or water. 
And of course the fire gets up to where the 
chemical was, or the water and that stops it. 
GP They use helicopters too. 
HP Just everybody who lived here would rally to fight a 
fire, there wasn't anybody too old or too young. 
MH Was there a leader? 
HP Oh yes, county fire wardens, and state fire wardens. 
MH 
Was there an alarm system? 
HP We'd just see the smoke and we'd know where it was coming 
from. 
There were always these one—way roads around through the 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 90 
woods and we'd go to the point where we thought it was coming. 
(A fly gets dispatched here) 
You could usually tell where a fire was and what road to go 
to, because there were roads all 
around through the vicinity 
going diagonal and vertical, so, fire never got too far with us. 
MH Have you ever done any work on the bay, or any fishing? 
HP None whatsoever. I don't play around water, no ma'am. 
Knee—deep is enough. 
Oh, 
I've worked in water waist deep 
building bridges and whatnot. 
MH and in cedar swamps? 
HP Oh yes, very, 
lot of cedar. 
MH But you work with pine mostly in the pulpwood business? 
HP All Pine. 
MH Do you 
log cedar ? 
HP I logged cedar during my father's working period. 
He cut 
up a lot of cedar for shingles, weatherboards, because most of 
the houses, back when I was a youngster, were all made out of 
weatherboards, cedar siding. 
He furnished the material for the 
mill, he furnished the 
log. (didn't own a mill) 
MH What were the procedures? 
HP We cut all that material with axes and carted them out 
with horses. 
MH Did you build corduroy roads? 
HP Definitely. 
Had to build corduroy road, and put brush on 
it for horses so they wouldn't slip. 
See now you can just build 
a corduroy road out of poles, and back a truck in, but we had to 
put the brush on too, so the horses could walk on the brush, so 
the poles wouldn't roll with 'em. 
HP We had a barn, nine horses. 
Not draft horses, too heavy 
to work 
in the cedar swamp. 
I'd say that we used a horse that 
weighed about 7 — 9 hundred pounds. 
MH Did you train them? 
HP You put 'im beside a horse that knew what he was doin', 
and he would teach 'im. You had to be very careful when you 
backed 'im around, not let 'im walk too fast, and keep a good 
road for 'im. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 91 
MH How many trees per day that way? 
HP We used to cut poles ten feet long, and we'd put on about 
3/4 of a cord per team. 
MH How long would that take? 
A day? 
HP 
No! 
A fella could cut that much in an hour and a half.

TX01: MH 
Was most of your work with your dad concentrated in the 
G—Whiting; 52GT area? 
HP My father did all 
of his work in the Whiting area. 
MH Are they all developed? 
HP No, they are all 
identifiable. 
We begin to go over a map. 
HP Where's Buckingham? 
Where's Whiting? 
(we 
locate those) 
Now, you see this Pole Bridge Branch? 
That runs right back 
here to our house. 
That used to be a pole road, would go all the 
way across the swamp, a complete corduroy road. 
It started right 
here where Cedar Glen Lakes is now and 
it went all 
the way up to 
this military reservation here. 
This is the Penn Central 
Railroad. 
The swamp I'm talking about is right here (points to a 
place near Buckingham in Lebanon State Forest). 
The swamp was 
called Buckingham. 
MH Where is Job's Swamp? 
HP 
Here's Roosevelt City where this stream starts, and 
it 
winds around, goes under the Central railroad, then it goes all 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 93 
the way down and hits Pole Bridge and goes into Pemberton. Know 
where the bridge is 
in Pemberton, New Jersey? 
Cranberry Bogs? I 
think these are Copeses Bogs, because Whitesbogs, where's route 
70? And where's the cutoff that goes to Browns Mill? 
TX02: MH who were the Copeses? 
HP They had a big cranberry farm at the time the Whites had 
their bogs across route 70. 
I used to gather cranberries at 
Whitesbogs G—Whitesbog; 21GT when I was just a youngster. 
MH when the Italians were there? 
HP Yeah! Used to go up there and pick cranberries, we didn't 
get into school until about mid—November. 
Used to pick 
cranberries from the time they ripened in September until mid— 
November. 
MH Was school 
in session at that time? 
HP 
We had a permit to stay out and work. 
GP (laughs) Couldn't do that now without a good excuse. 
HP You had to pick with your hands. 
Certain berries you 
could use a cranberry scoop on. They had different varieties, you 
had the Howes and the Centennials, and they were easily bruised 
and they would rot. 
There were the Early Blacks, they were 
planted one variety to a bog. 
The Early Black was a tough, small 
variety, and you could scoop them. 
The Howes and the Centennials 
you had to scoop. 
There was the Cape Cods. 
GP Where was 
it that you found rattlesnakes. 
HP There's a cranberry bog down in the Bamber area, 
in Dover 
across from Tom's River. 
Applegate was the proprietor of that 
bog. 
James Applegate. 
MH What about varieties of huckleberries? 
HP To my knowledge there's three kinds of huckleberries and 
three kinds of blueberries. There's the upland blueberry, and the 
swamp blueberry, and the spong blueberry. 
The upland blueberry 
got ripe first. 
Then the spong blueberry got ripe next. 
The 
swamp blueberry, big high bushes 
in the shade got ripe later. 
MH Did they have different tastes? 
HP Oh yeah. 
. . .A spong is a small 
lowland on the upland. 
A place that's somewhat swampy. 
Now the swamp huckleberry would 
grow right in the cedar swamp, where there's deep mud. 
But most 
of the spongs had sand bottom. 
Hufford--$3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 94 
MH Do spongs have names to them? 
HP Gum Spong was a swamp, no cedar in 
it. 
That's right off 
of route 70. 
It's all 
gum trees there. 
There's a cranberry bog 
there too. 
TX03: 
MH Were there more bogs cultivated when you were younger? 
It seems as though there are a lot of abandoned bogs now. 
HP There really is. 
All cranberry bogs that were down at 
Bullocks, there's several acres there, right where that central 
railroad goes through. 
They're all abandoned. 
I call them 
Bullocks. 
I don't know who owned them. 
Then Dover Forge has 
been abandoned, I think the state owns that now. 
That's across 
from G—Double Trouble; 44GT bogs, practically on the same stream, 
but over farther. 
Between Bamber and Double Trouble. 
(We look 
at the map) 
Near Keswick Grove and Camp Columbus. 
You see all 
these fresh water streams? 
They're trying to conserve all 
these 
fresh water streams that go 
into Barnegat Bay? 
They all start 
over here 
in these sand hills. 
And that's why they don't want 
any of this part of the state molested, because if this all built 
up through here, and all 
of these streams dry up, we're going to 
have a terrible time here 
in Jersey. 
Because this 
is the only 
unpolluted fresh water streams that we have. 
After you go beyond 
Pemberton, you got no big streams. 
They're all 
in this vicinity 
of Jersey. 
I don't think there's but one stream, and that's Pole 
Bridge Stream and that goes through Pemberton that goes into the 
Delaware River. 
All the rest of 
'em goes into Barnegat Bay. 
MH How about the Rancocas? 
HP Yeah, Rancocas. 
Rancocas starts right down here in 
Whiting. 
Between here and the firehouse, on Central Avenue. 
try to locate it on the map) 
TX04: MH Was Bamber there when you were growing up? 
HP Yeah! Now here's G—Bamber Lake; 49GT. 
The Peach Orchard 
was over in this section. 
MH How could they grow peaches there? 
HP I think there was 70 acres of peaches there. 
MH Did one person own them? 
HP Yes, some company set those trees out, but I really don't 
remember, I was quite small then. 
Bamber Lake is just a big lake. Not related to cranberries 
Camp Columbus. 
Now there's a building project there. 
MH Are there many older residents around Bamber Lake? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 95 
(We 
HP No, the last old resident we had at Bamber Lake passed 
about two years ago. 
Jimmie Branson? 
Remember Old Man Branson? 
Lived 
in the house on Lacey Road? 
He was about 84 when he 
passed. . .I 
know one fella down on Lacey Road that is just about 
my age, and that's Walter Britton. 
He lives on the right hand 
side just before you get to that sand company road back 
in there. 
That's the cousin of the one born the same day as Harry. 
TX05: MH Back to Buckingham Swamp. 
Where else? 
HP Worked in Hurricane Swamp (near Hurricane Brook) 
and we cut the swamp off at Webb's Mill, notice all these streams 
go toward Barnegat Bay. 
All 
of these are clean streams. 
GP For 
now. 
MH Have you hunted? 
HP Not recently. 
In years gone by I used to hunt foxes way 
up 
in the government reservation now, and around Webb's Mill. 
MH Did you use dogs? Did you hunt to catch? 
HP Oh yeah. Yeah, for the pelt. there was a bounty on foxes 
at that time. 
The bounty was three dollars and a half and the 
pelt would bring $50. 
Almost as much as for a cord of cedar. 
And 
if you caught a fox alive and you'd send for the fellow in 
Princeton used to have fox chases, a live fox was worth $20. 
Doesn't remember his name. 
But there was somebody there used to 
buy 'em, they'd take 'em off 
in the hills. 
Any kind of a fox, 
gray fox 
if he was large enough, 24 pounds. I never caught one 
live. 
My dad used to catch 'em. 
He had a pair of special 
gloves, dogs would run 'im up a tree, and a fox won't come out of 
a tree if there's four or five dogs round the base of 
it, because 
he's afraid they'll kill 
'im. 
And you go up and you put a snooz 
around his neck and you have to choke 'im a little bit until you 
wind it around his mouth. 
You got both hands to climb up, then 
you get your fox and you climb down with one hand, and hold the 
fox under your arm with the other. 
I never caught a fox, but my 
dad told me how to do it. He had a foxhound crossed with a bird 
dog, because a bird dog 
is faster, and can run a fox down. 
Doesn't remember its name. 
I mostly done rabbit huntin. 
I'd go out after a fox once 
in 
a while, but it was very seldom that you could get one, because I 
did most of the working after I got to be a man, and didn't have 
that much time off. 
But when it used to snow, see it stopped 
snowing around this vicinity, just about the time I grew up, but 
when my dad was a youngster they used to have snows around here 
this deep and you couldn't work in the cedar swamp 
because you 
couldn't get the horses in and you couldn't see where you was 
travellin', 
it wasn't like workin' out on the ground. Go in a 
hole and get a hernia or something, and you couldn't work. 
so 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 36 
they used to catch foxes. 
MH So beagles were more for rabbits? 
HP Yeah, a beatle is, he's slow, and you can kill 
all 
the 
rabbits, they'll run 'em right out to you. 
Then the rabbit 
he'll just hop along easily. 
But if you've got a dog as large as 
a foxhound he runs 'em too fast. 
You can shoot the rabbit but 
you shoot 'im all 
to pieces. 
MH Where did you get the dogs? 
HP Used to breed your own. 
there wasn't nothing but hound 
dogs around. 
I don't think I ever even saw a german shepherd 
until they came around here after I came out of high school 
in 
1928. 
They started bringin in german shepherds. 
We had a few 
airedales before, but most of the dogs were shepherds. 
the 
collie, the foxhound, and the rabbit hound. 
You got two kind of 
beagles. You got the straight—legged beatle, and the bow—legged 
beatle. 
Now the straight—legged beatle is the faster dog. 
But 
the crooked legged beatle, he's very slow. Doesn't know where 
they originated. 
MH Why would you choose the slower one? 
HP that would be for somebody that couldn't shoot 
accurately. Almost a standstill shot. 
Someone was moving very 
slowly or sitting still, but the faster dog, you'd have to be 
more sport, you know, to shoot at something that was moving 
target. 
MH What other animals could you make some money on? 
HP Oh yeah! Mink, we have beaver here, 
GP Deers 
HP 
Muskrat, yeah, when my father was a youngster they had wild hog, 
brown bear, wild turkey, which are coming back now. 
MH Where were the hog and the bear? 
HP Right between here G—Whiting; 52GT and Lakehurst New 
Jersey. 
In those swamps, and bear too. 
Wild hog and bear. 
MH Are there places that you know of that your father told 
you that he'd seen the bears? 
HP Surely! 
Down Hurricane Swamp. 
MH Does that have a pretty good stand of cedar? 
HP It certainly has, because that belongs to the state of 
New Jersey, most of 
it. 
Belongs to the fish and game. 
MH Do they allow you to go in and cut? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 97 
HP (laughs) You better not be caught. 
That Hurricane Swamp 
starts at the Old Boyd Place on the government reservation, and 
goes all 
the way to Hurricane Lake. 
And then beyond Lakehurst 
you have the Black Swamp, and Black Swamp runs into Pine Lake 
Park. 
And Hurricane runs into Toms River. 
MH Have you named any places around here? 
HP They're all 
on the maps before my father's time. 
I've 
seen some old deeds, and all 
of those swamps and streams are much 
more noticeable than they are on your maps, and many more names 
that aren't here. 
MH Are the names that aren't here in usage still? 
HP I don't think so. 
MH Did you use different techniques for catching every 
animal? 
HP Yes ma'am you do. You don't ever, you have a certain, you 
wash your hands in something, before you set a trap, because most 
animals are smart and they know you've been there, and so they 
would sometimes, 
in order to 
lure an animal along, wipe their 
hands in bacon grease, anythings that would smell 
like food, 
other than the scent of another animal. 
We're a class of animal 
too, a higher class of animal. But if you had your hand on 
it 
they probably wouldn't go to the trap. 
So you rub your hands in 
Bacon fat. 
MH Fox urine? 
HP That's right. 
They have synthetic 
hand washes now that will take the human scent away. 
It's a 
peculiar thing how the instinct of an animal 
is so keen. 
But 
they know an awful 
lot, 
to keep away from the human being, 
because naturally we're smarter than they are to a degree, but I 
think they're more sensible (sensitive?) to nature than we are. 
They can forecast the weather, they know when there's coming a 
storm. 
You can tell 
by the way they move. 
In the afternoon you'll see a little cloud in the sky and 
you'll see the birds goin' way up high and comin' down, keep 
goin' way up high and flutterin' , you know there's gonna be a 
storm that afternoon, a hard thunderstorm. 
MH Why do you think they do that? 
HP I don't know whether they're testing the atmosphere, or 
what, but I have watched it and they'll all clutter up 
in flocks. 
MH What are some of the different kinds of birds around here 
that you've noticed? 
HP Oh, we've got several kinds, the swallow, the robin, the 
hummingbird, GP Bluejays, cardinals 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 98 
MH Do you have a bird feeder? 
HP She has her own personal birdfeeder. (laughs) 
She takes 
care of her birds. 
Bread crumbs out in the yard. 
GP Little Snowbirds 
HP and the bunting, the snow bunting, that's the gray bird 
with the white 
GP and the black birds 
HP the starling, the thrush, catbird 
GP and the, what do you call 
'em, doves 
HP Mourning doves 
GP Quails 
HP Whippourwill 
MH Are there any birds that you expect to see when you go 
into a cedar swamp that you wouldn't see around the house? 
HP Yes, the yellow waxwing hangs around the swamp, the wren, 
no they stay around the garden. I've seen a golden waxwing, they 
usually stay around the cedars and catch, they're bug birds. 
But 
mostly all 
of the birds, robins and all those others, they're 
more or less domesticated. 
They stay around the house. 
MH Snapping turtles? Have you trapped them? 
HP No, we catch 'em once 
in a while along the edge of a 
spong or something. 
Never trapped 'em. 
You catch 'em going from 
one pond to another. 
They feed around ponds, eat roots and 
different things, roots of pond lilies. 
Anything they like that 
will satisfy their taste. 
MH Have you observed them eating? 
HP I've cut their heads off and cleaned a few of them. 
And 
they've had some roots in them before they digested it. They have 
a, 
stomach something like a chicken, and you can tell pretty much 
what they eat. 
I didn't see any frogs, or bugs, was mostly 
roots, soft, undigested roots. 
MH Have you ever heard that there's a lot of different kinds 
of meat in a snapping turtle? 
HP I've seen it. 
There's some meat in a snapping turtle 
that looks like fish, some that looks like beef, chicken, and, 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 93 
he's got three different colors of dark meat, he's got red, sort 
of a purplish, and that's real dark, I don't know what that might 
be but it's real tasty. And they're right under his shell. 
And 
the more you work down his leg 
the meat changes more. 
I would 
say there's six or seven different color meats in that snapping 
turtle. 
MH Are there any precautions you have to take because of its 
reflexes or anything?

G—Whiting; 52GT 
MH So after, a snapper's head can bite til after sundown? 
Isn't it just a certain number of hours? 
HP If you cut his head off in the morning, and he'll 
lay 
there with his mouth open and you stick a stick into 
it he'll 
clamp down on 
it. 
Because I have done it. 
I've seen the head 
still alive after cuttin' the head off three hours, and it's 
still biteable. 
And a snapper hasn't got any meat. 
He's just 
got a solid bone all 
the way around the lower jaw and all 
the way 
around the upper jaw. 
A solid sharp jaw. 
MH Has anybody ever been hurt just by snapping turtles? 
HP Not that I know of, because everybody is wary of his 
mouth. 
Because he does not let go once he gets a hold of you. 
The only way you can get him loose from you 
is to slit both sides 
of the mouth all the way back. 
MH Have you ever made snapper soup? 
HP Not yet. 
GP I don't think I'd like 
it. 
HP I think you would. 
It's the tastiest soup you ever 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 101 
tasted...She'll make some before her time's out. foodways 
MH Have you done anything with snakes. 
HP I used to catch snakes when I was a youngster, but I 
don't know, something, I don't know whether it's fear, but I just 
don't bother with them any more after I grew up. 
Somethin about 
'em that, I'm alright if I seen one before I get too close to it, 
but I was cuttin pulpwood down 
in the vicinity of Whiting Lake, 
and I got down to get some water and I happened to have my 
brother—in—law with me, and when I went to get down, he didn't 
say anything, he just pushed me aside with his knee, and I didn't 
know what in the world had happened to 
'im, and honestly that 
snake had coiled, and I didn't even hear 'im, and he didn't even 
rattle. 
It happened to be in a month when he was blind. 
And 
they say they don't rattle sometimes when they're blind, and 
they're shedding, and God knows, 
if 
I'd ever got down there, we 
used to drink where the water ran near the old Tuckerton 
Railroad, he'd have smacked me right in the face. 
GP Those people have developed there, you know, Fox Hollow, 
and I wonder do those snakes ever come up 
in their yards? 
HP No, 
if a snake knows there's any other animal around 
he'll get out of the way unless you corner 'im. 
GP 
They say they won't come around if you have a dog, a 
snake won't come around. 
HP No, no, they're probably out there in that savannah 
ground where those bushes are thick...Around in back of the lake 
where they haven't cleared yet, but they're talkin about clearin 
all 
that out and makin the lake bigger. 
MH What is that? 
HP Savannah ground is the lowland that borders the lake. 
MH any lake? 
HP Most all the lakes around here, because most all of our 
lakes that are made here are made from streams and swamps. 
MH Sounds like you used the woods for lots of various kinds 
of work, do you have any favorite places around here that you've 
used more than others, or that are especially important to you? 
HP Well, not really, making a livelihood and cuttin off 
cedar swamp there was some places where the cedar was larger and 
bigger and had better growth than others, but it's all about the 
same. 
MH Have you travelled outside of New Jersey? 
Hufford--$3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 102 
HP No, 
the only other state I've been into around the 
terrain, other than Jersey, would be Virginia, and it's entirely 
different. 
There's no muddy bottom swamps down there, they're 
all 
stone bottoms, you can walk across them. 
You have running 
brooks but there's no marshes. 
They say there's marshes in 
Florida. 
And the only other state that has white cedar is the 
state of Wisconsin. 
They have cedar swamps. 
MH They also have cranberries, don't they? 
HP Yes. 
That's a cranberry state, and Massachusetts has 
cranberries. 
MH Would they also have sphagnum moss? 
HP I doubt it. 
I 
doubt it very much. Because sphagnum moss won't grow where it's 
rocky ground. 
It has to be a marsh. 
It'll only thrive in marsh, 
sphagnum moss. 
There's a lot of sphagnum moss in Burlington 
County, New Jersey, a lot of sphagnum moss, because there's a lot 
of swamp. I think there's more acres of swamp 
in Burlington 
County than there is any, well Cape May has quite a bit of swamp, 
than all 
the rest of Jersey combined. 
MH So 
if you don't own lots and lots of 
land, how can you 
find places to work? 
HP You can get a cutting right to cut so much off. 
MH How do you decide where to work? 
HP Well, 
if you were going to market material, you would go 
and check over a parcel of cedar or a parcel of pine, to see how 
much you could get out of 
it. 
And then pay accordingly. 
MH Do you think there are many people doing what you're 
doing? 
Do you know Clifford Frazee? 
HP I know 'im. 
. . Well you have your customers from year 
to year, and they depend on you, so there isn't too much 
competition, because if you're going to sell a product to a 
certain lumber yard, or a nursery, and you give them a good 
product they'll come back to you because when they sell 
it, they 
want to know that 
they've made a customer. So that keeps you 
busy, 
it keeps the person that buys satisfied, so, 
its just a 
revolutionary business. 
MH What are the enjoyable aspects of your work? 
Aren't you 
glad you don't work in a bank? 
HP Oh, definitely, I couldn't stand it. 
I like the 
outdoors, and 
if you work outdoors and you get used to 
it, 
it has 
all 
the advantages: fresh air, and there is no anxiety, no worry 
when you work outdoors. 
You know what you want to do, you go out

and do it, especially if you're working for yourself, or even if 
you're working for somebody else. 
If you're working for somebody 
else, they tell you what they want, then you sort the material 
that you cut, whether it's a post or a rail 
or a tree stake, then 
you get paid accordingly. 
MH What are your favorite times of year? 
HP It's sort of uncomfortable to be out there when it's 
anywhere from 90 to 100 degrees hot, and the flies are botherin 
you. 
But I've survived it through the years. 
GP Then there's the very cold weather, around 0 or 10. 
HP But if 
I'd been cuttin wood it wouldn't of bothered me at 
all. I was working at Bayville. 
We were building a sewage 
disposal, and there wasn't enough activity to suit the weather, 
but if I'd had an eight pound mall splittin wood or something, 
it 
wouldn't bother me at all. 
Then we were out in the clearing of 
about a mile square, and there was no cover from the wind. 
1976, 
77, boy, 
it was severe! 
And that's the only winter that I've 
really suffered from a cold. 
MH Do you work outside much (to GP) 
GP No I'm mostly inside, and when I go out I'm going like to 
Toms River or North Jersey or somewhere. domestic work, 
sex 
roles 
HP I don't think I could stand working indoors. 
I really 
don't. 
(He asks for some more tea and GP says, "That's your 
third cup today!" 
"Do you think it will bother me?" 
"It might." 
He laughs. 
I ask about Jerry Munyhun, the wizard of the Pines 
that Halpert collected stories about in the 1930s) 
TX02: 
HP Yeah, Jerry Munyhun. 
Well I just know the story as it 
was told to me. 
I can't say it's the truth. 
Can't say it's the 
truth . 
MH Who told you the story? 
HP 
Was an old fellow from down at G—Waretown; 53GT, fellow by 
the name of Acton Bunnel, he was a fisherman. 
He lived down 
there on the water. 
Shellfish and other kind of fish. 
He was 
tellin about Jerry Munyhun. 
Said that Jerry had sold his soul 
to 
the devil so that he would have unusual powers over other human 
beings. 
MH Was he a real person? 
HP He (Bunnell) was a man about my father's age, and I guess 
pop met him through buying salt hay for his horses. 
Once in a 
while he'd come by and he'd sit down and talk and have dinner 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 104 
together. 
He'd say "Charlie remember old Jerry Munyhun? 
Remember?" 
Pop'd say, "Yeah, I heard about him" and tell the 
story all 
over again. 
MH Was he someone around here? 
HP I don't know whether he was around here or down the 
seashore. 
I really never knew. 
TX03: MH Were there other famous people? 
HP Most of the fellows around here were ordinary working 
people, working on the railroad, cutting wood, worked in the 
sawmill, because that's about all 
there was to do. 
Brickyards, 
spading clay. 
That sort of work ... You find a place where you 
have a quantity of clay. 
It's usually in swampy land. 
You take 
the surface off, until you get down to the grade of clay that you 
want, and a spade is about fourteen inches long, eight inches 
wide, and you push that all 
the way down as far as 
it'll go, 
and 
you cut out your first slab, and then you go all the way down as 
far as you wanna go. 
then you come back and you take another 
line down. And that's the way they used to get the clay out. 
No 
steamshovels or anything. 
they'd have to spade it by hand. 
MH Would you say there were quite a number of clay sites or 
clay pits around? 
HP There's a big clay pit down at G—Woodmansie; 27GT, New 
Jersey. 
TX04: MH Have you ever seen the four—wheeling? 
HP I seen them down 
in the area toward the G—Forked River 
Mountains; 43GT, offa Lacey Road. 
They go down in there with 
their trailers and whatnot. 
MH Have you worked in the Forked River Mountains? 
HP Yes! Back through Azerdatun, 
in back of Bamber. 
MH Is Azerdatun well—known around here? 
HP I'd say so. 
I don't know what there was at Azerdatun at 
one time, but that seemed to have been a place back in the area 
of the Forked River Mountains, and there seems to have been a 
road that come back up through there from the Waretown area, over 
to Toms River, now whether it was a stopping—off place or not, I 
don't know. 
But, there was some poplar trees there, and that's 
unusual for poplar trees to grow out in the middle of the woods 
and there seems to have been a parcel of the land that looked 
like there had been a clearing there at one time. 
Now, 
Azerdatun, find Bamber (on the map) and I can show you. 
(It 
turns out to be on the Brookville map) MH Here we go. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 105 
MH Have you worked much on the Plains? 
HP No, just go through there going to Tuckerton. 
Woodmansie, Lacey, cranberry bog, 
let's see, 
MH Have you run into those foxhunters over in, 
HP Over in back of Pasadena? 
Over by North Branch, South 
Branch, they hunt through there. 
Azerdatun is south of Bamber 
Lake. 
(We don't have the map it's on) It would be over toward 
Brookville. 
TX05: HP I worked in the G—Mount Misery; 27GT area. 
Cut wood here 
at Upton, and back over toward Pasadena. . .I would say they 
hunted foxes in that area for at least 25 or 30 years in that 
area as I know of, because there's a large range. 
Now the only 
roads that you got through that area, they go all 
the way from 
route 70, all 
the way through to 539. 
Now that must be a range 
of at least 6 miles right through that area, so that dogs can get 
a chance to go without any interruptions from the highway. 
The 
nearest big route in that area would be route 72, and dogs run a 
fox so fast in there, I guess it would be three miles to Route 
72, and they run 'im so fast in there that I guess he just hangs 
out around North Branch, south Branch, and Middle Branch. 
In 
those three branches they'll run. 
And that's all state forest, 
all 
the way over to route 70. 
MH You run 
into those names for brooks over by the Forked 
River, 
HP But that would be 
in a different state forest. 
Wharton, 
Batsto, you would know the difference by the area that you're in. 
You see, all 
your branches here, all the roads wind around 
through there. 
...They used to call route 70 route 40. 
It went 
all 
the way from Toms River to the Camden Bridge. 
Then when they 
paved it they changed the name to route 70. 
MH How about when the trains went through? 
HP I used to ride on this train the first three months I 
went to high school. 
Back in 1924. 
In Pemberton. 
Then they 
switched us to Lakewood. 
MH How about these lake settlements, 
were they always 
there? 
HP They were not there, 
there wasn't anything but a swamp. 
Now North Branch is 
in the vicinity of this Country Lakes in 
here. 
Now I just don't know where it 
is 
in here, but it's 
in 
here. 
You see that cranberry bog? 
Now Country Lake, 
Gum Spong 
is back 
in this area somewhere. 
See where it says "Cranberry 
Bog?" 
Gum Spong is 
in there somewhere. 
MH What about "Willy's 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 106 
Hill"? HP Nope. 
MH Petticoat Hill? 
HP Nope. 
MH The Dry Ponds? 
The Briar Hole? 
HP Nope, nope. 
No, 
I, 
those places are 
in 
Burlington County, and I didn't get over in that area. 
Most of 
our work was 
in the northern part of Burlington County, around 
the vicinity of Woodmansie, 
we did get as far as Chatsworth. 
One time I used to cut wood down at Waterford / Tabernacle area, 
but that's as far as I went. But this 
is over, I would say, 
in 
the Northwest part of Burlington County where you're speaking of, 
between Route 70 and Mount Holly and that area. 
The only hilly 
place I know is Mount Holly, 
that hike just in back of Mount 
Holly. 
TX06: MH When was G—South Toms River; 43GT settled? 
HP That was settled right after the first World War, about 
1920. 
That's rather new. 
Because that was all woods and a real 
estate agent by the name of Yoder sold that land off for some 
company. 
I forget old man Yoder's name. 
His son's name was 
Lester. 
He had a sawmill 
in South Toms River, not in Manitou 
Park. 
MH How did G—Manitou Park; 43GT get its name? 
HP I don't know. 
I don't know. 
GP I guess it's just the 
philosophy like any other section. 
Like Atlantic Highlands, one 
part was called Hillside, 
still Atlantic Highlands. 
HP Now, I helped tear up this road here, 
this railroad. 
Yep. Old Penn Central. 
They didn't want to make a bridge from 
Pine Beach across to Island Heights, so they tore the whole road 
up. 
They're talking about rebuilding the road from Philadelphia 
to Atlantic City. 
But you could jump on this line here at 
Whiting and you could be 
in Philadelphia in 45 minutes. 
And 
it 
wasn't for the lack of passengers, because the shore traffic, 
They just didn't want to build that bridge. 
MH This would be a different place if the railroad were 
still here. 
HP No doubt. 
This would probably be a manufacturing center. 
But it may be advantageous to us anyhow, because if we had 
factories around here we probably wouldn't have the clean water 
and the clean air that we've got. 
So, maybe God was looking 
down on us with mercy after all. 
MH Allyn's manufactory doesn't seem like much of a factory, 
but it's kind a manufacturing place.

1MIK: 
Mary Hufford, Milton Collins, Susie (a hound dog) 
2MIK: 
TX01: G—Allen Road; 26GT (Township code 
is uncertain. Is Allen Road 
in Penn State Forest?) Milton Collins attempts to get Susie, his 
favorite trail dog, to start a fox. 
He 
is calling to her, having 
followed her down a path toward a cedar swamp, near the alien 
road. 
Before the tape started he followed her around calling 
encouragingly, "Find it!" 
Only "find" was pronounced as 
if 
it 
had two syllables: 
"Fieend dit!" 
with a slight chirrup to the 
voice as 
it relinquished the second word. 
He emerges, without Susie, and says, "That's too old, 
meaning the scent is too old. 
"What a gorgeous night, Lady. 
If we could just find a fox." 
He has a stage presence, and a hail—fellow—well—met style that 
must be related somehow to his career as a Methodist minister. 
"But, that's the way it 
is," he asserts philosophically. 
"Did 
she come out?" 
he asked me. 
"No."' "Susie!" 
Pause. Silence. 
"She'll tongue that in a minute. 
That's an old track, and we 
don't like that old track. 
they just wander all 
over everywhere, 
so that it takes so 
long to get close to the fox, see?" 
He 
, 
shouts to her. 
"Hee! Come on, Susie! Here! Susie! We'll get her 
back here. 
We can find a better trail than that. 
025 
Have you looked for any tracks recently? 
No, 
occasionally you can see a track in the white sand. 
Once 
in a 
while when you're walking this soft sand, see 
Susie! You'll 
hear her way off in a minute. 
See, there's a dog track. See the 
toes? 
That's a dog. 
Now a fox'II be about one third that size. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 108 
Doesn't know whether he'll find a red fox or a gray tonight. 
His dogs are: Jack, Rock, Biscuit, he starts to chuckle, bends 
over to 
investigate something in 
the sand, and straightens up 
with something in his hand. "Back here 
in the wilderness and look 
at that! 
A golf ball! " Me: 
"A golf ball, of all things!" 
"Dempsey was another one." "Now isn't that somethin'! You find 
the strangest things. 
All right, girl, we'll, now that looks 
something like a fox track, that's not a fox track, but if you 
want to 
look at that, see right here? 
Now that would be a 
smaller animal, I'm not sure. 
But they have coons, a coon puts 
down a track like a hand, just like your hand, with a thumb and 
four, we're wasting time here. 
One more clear spot." 
Me (remembering what was said before the tape was on): So 
Jack 
is Jim's dog that we heard tonging over there, and Don 
is 
the other hunter. "That's right, Don is up at the Swagger Road, 
and 
if he gets a track he'll call 
us and we'll go up there. " Me: 
And we're just off of Allen Road. "Right, now there's an old fox 
track." Me: Really? 
(A bark) "Oop, see now, there she goes, she 
just tongued. 
But what an old track. 
Huh. 
But I'll never get 
'er out either. 
She's clear across the swamp. 
Okay. 
Me: How 
do you know it's so old? 
MC: 
If 
it were any good at all, she'd 
tongue it, 
she'd keep at 
it, 
see. 
Me: Can she spot the track by 
sight? 
MC. All 
by smell. 
Everything. 
Me: You knew she was 
interested before, because she was doing something with her tail? 
MC: That's it. Her tail was waggin' fast. If you noticed when we 
first got out of the car there was no excitement, no action, so 
she didn't wag her tail. 
Me: 
so that was your first sign. 
MC> 
Yup. Me: and she's a Maryland type blue tick. 
MC. that's right. 
Now I'll have to wait her out. 
I don't spose I can call 
'er out. 
Oh, she's her own boss then. Susie! Here Susie! Susie! (great 
echo). 
And another thing, 
if 
it's backwards they don't tongue 
very much. 
Susie! Whoop! Whoop! 
C'mon girl! 
Alright, we'll go 
back, and 
if 
she gets where she'll, 
Me: 
Well, would you wait 
for her normally? 
MC: N000 ... I'll 
do just exactly what we're 
gonna do, okay? 
Me: 
Now what were you tellin' me about the 
difference between Maryland Hounds and Walkers? 
MC. 
They're 
more slender [Walkers] and they've got little ears instead of big 
ears, and a flag tail, and they carry their tail up over their 
back, 
if you notice, she drops hers. 
A walker, he's got his head 
in the air, he's a proud dog, but we don't have 'em much up here 
because they cover so much ground, they just lace a fox, they 
just run 'im hard, and they run 'im out of his country, see. 
We 
have these slower dogs, with more noise. 
Me: How did Maryland 
hounds get started? 
MC: 
Just like, 
lemme think now, a good 
example, oh, cattle. 
They raise cattle for beef, and they'll 
breed, 
line breed to get beef cattle, you know what I mean? And 
the same way with a dog, 
if a dog has a beautiful note, or 
if a 
dog has conformation, built nice, and they want to show the dog, 
besides running, then they line breed 'im. 
There's also an 
English hound. 
They brought 'em over to Maryland, and this 
gentleman had a lot of money and he kept that one strain because 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 109 
he 
liked 
it, 
see. 
(sort of to himself and to Susie) Tongue that 
track once. 
She knows better than that. 
(laughs, remembering 
the golf ball) 
That's an unusual thing to find, a golf ball here 
in the wilderness. 
Another time we found a weather, a very 
unusual thing, and 
it was mysterious, because it was ticking, and 
so we cautiously went up and, 
it was on a balloon, and 
it was a 
box type thing, and we got up there and 
it said "do not mail this 
back to us" and 
it was a weather, a United States weather what— 
you—call 
it, 
indicating wind drift. 
Put out by the government. 
But, oh, that looked so strange up there 
in a tree. 
(dogs 
in the 
distance.) Listen! 
106. 
(no sounds) 
This time o' 
night, that's pitiful. 
(laughs) 
Oh my goodness! 
Take that old track, that fox 
travelled four o'clock this afternoon. 
When the track's anywhere 
near right she'll tongue it. 
But she'll go on this for the rest 
of the night, so I'll go around there and put out another dog. 
Maybe I'll strike a, 
man! 
it's cold. 
I heard Jim callin' his 
dogs, so that track was nothing too. 
Man! 
Take my ear off (the 
branches.). 
Every man calls a little different, and a dog knows 
it. 
Boy, got a CB and doesn't have 
it on. 
That don't make any 
sense. 
That's him. 
130. 
Susie's about 8 years old. 
Another one 
is 2, another 
5 or 6, 
another about 6. 
We get to his son 
in the truck. 
"Son, 
get out and meet these nice people. Well, we gotta lay some 
plans. 
Mary, meet Jim, my son. 
And this is Carl. Tell them 
where you're from, please. " Jim: "There's another man up above 
there, Don, he's part of 
it, 
right dad?" 
MC "Yeah, now, 
is he 
doing something? Did you call 
'im back?" 
Jim: "No, he's trailin, 
from the pond on up." 
MC: From the pond. 
He didn't start back 
here? Jim: No. MC: Where's Jack? 
How about if you take Jack and 
Rock and hit on up to the pond? She's tongued two or three times 
and, 
lookit here, a golf ball 
back here 
in the wilderness. 
What 
in the world? Lookit that. " Jim: "Who's tongued" 
MC: "Susie, I 
got Susie along. So, 
if 
you'll strike on up there with Rock, and 
maybe you'll follow here across. 
If you do then call me, 
alright? 
162. CB: Right back, Don. Boy, I got an old one, but it 
is 
an old track. 
Have you got one? 
(indiscernible from Don) MC: on 
radio, "Jim is gonna strike up to the pond. 
Did you start at the 
pond?" Don: 
No (indisc). 
MC: Okay, he'll strike up that far. 
If Susie comes 
in we'll be up. 
Maybe after Jim strikes that he 
can walk the Chicken Road. 
Don: Yeah, I'll 
be up there on the 
hill. 
MC: Okay, he's comin' toward ya and I gotta wait for 
Susie. 
Unloading Rock, who 
is very noisy. 
186. 
MC: Go ahead. Find it. 
Sometimes one man's dog won't 
go with another. 
Oh, Susie's here. 
Wait a minute, Jim. 
I'll 
strike along with you. 
Let me strike ahead of you so they 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 110 
(meaning Carl 
and I) 
can see what happens. 
This 
is what we were 
waiting for so now we can go ahead up. 
We'll 
load up now, and 
ride along see 
if we can find a track. 
212. 
We're riding along 
in 
the truck. 
Carl talking 
intermittently about recording matters. 
We're striking the dogs 
ahead of the truck. 
224. 
MC: Now these dogs are doing just one thing (note this 
emphasis on the specialized dog, which I encountered repeatedly). 
They don't run a deer, they don't run a rabbit, they're lookin'. 
Now just look at this, this fascinates me. 
You have to have the 
desire to foxhunt born in ya, you don't ever kill 
the fox. 
Lots 
of people like to kill, see. 
We don't. 
It's all 
sound. 
Every 
dog has a different note. 
Did you hear Jack when he tongued over 
ther? 
Jim's dog? 
And where you able to pick out Susie when she 
was across the swamp? 
Just a little bit? 
Alright, we'll hit a 
track before the night's over. Now see, a fox's been here, see 
it? 
See what they're doing? 
Right there. 
Carl: 
All 
three of 
'em are kind of together? 
MC: Excited. 
That's it. 
Oh, they're 
pickin' out that track now. 
They'll find it off the road, and 
then you can hear some noise. 
See that blue dog tongues a colder 
track than the rest, and he's tonguin'. 
Don (on CB): So what's 
happenin'? 
MC: 
What's your point? 
Don: Right behind you. 
MC 
We got a track right here 
in the road, they haven't got it off 
yet, 
I'll 
let you know when they do. 
Listen, 
let your dog out. 
Carl gets out to go take some pictures. 
MC: See how their tails are going? 
That's the key there. 
Walkers would do that too. 
Bob Hageman shows up. 
MC: 
I'll 
let 
this windy dog out here. 
If 
I'd a let him out with her she'd a 
never come back. 
They get real excited, egg one anothert on, 
see. 
Good individual notes from the windy dog. MC: Aw shutup! 
Now we'll get up there. 
Me: Does the fox know what's about to happen. MC Oh yeah. 
Re: hunters' preferences re: males, females, breeding. 
He 
lost his other glove. 
Me: Do some men keep both males and females? 
MC: Yeah, but 
some men prefer females to males. 
Now I try to get all males, 
but I got one good female, so I kept her... That's Susie, that's 
right. 
Me: Do you breed any dogs yourself? 
MC: No, 
it's so 
expensive, and I'll 
tell you, you have to go through so many 
puppies before you get a good one. 
This way I buy offa men 
who've already broke 'em. 
Me: Do some guys right in the area 
breed 'em? 
MC: Yes, yes, you talked to one, Jake Meredith. 
Most 
a►l 
those people, It sounds like they've hit somethin, 
let's see. 
(Gets out) Alright, this 
is 
it. 
Good sounds, random at first. 
A little more than halfway 
through the tape. 
The men murmuring in the background sometimes. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 111 
Carl helps get the extender on the microphone. 
Suggests getting 
away from the car motor, 
it's clicking. 
Some good echoes from 
the single sounds emitted by various dogs. 
Beautiful. 
Continues 
for a few minutes. 
Sounds of feet crunching on the gravel road. 
Carl suggests we switch microphones since there's obviously a 
lull. 
CB radio conversation. MC responds: Yeah, because mine 
is 
stuck. 
I think mine hit the road in there. ..There's got to be a 
track a little hotter than what I hit in here. 
You're going to 
walk 
in the Chicken Road? 
Okay. 
To us: 
He's going to walk in the chicken road, 
interrupted 
by CB voice again. 
MC responds: Tom run today five and a half 
hours, and Hubie (Driscoll?) has gotta work till eight o'clock. 
Then to us: 
It could be backwards too, see. 
This is the 
sport of foxhunting. 
If you come out everytime and started a 
fox, why, I guess you'd get used to 
it. 
This way, why it's the 
fascination of trying to find out where that fox went. 
Me: What were the dogs just doin' 
in there? MC: Trailin'. 
One dog would find it, 
and they'd all 
go up to there, and that's 
what you call trailing. 
Oh, when they jump a fox, you hear some 
noise. 
Sounds of a panting dog. 
MC: 
Let's see 
if I can get' 
em 
out of here. 
..What in the world are you doin! 
We'll strike 
right on up the road, so. 
The rest of those dogs'II be back.

TX01: G—Allen Road; 26GT (Unsure of geographic code. Is Allen Road 
in Penn State Forest?) Carl grabs the cameras. 
I ask Milton what 
Don does for the state. 
Uh, highway department, something to do 
with bridges, 
inspecting, I think. 
On this road? 
No, state 
roads, bridges. Tucked in alright? 
Carl: Yessir. 
Milton: 
Whaddaya say, Don? 
(addressing CB, channel 
15) 
How 'bout it, 
Don? 
(inaudible) Milt: Did you strike back to the little bridge? 
Back to the swamp? 
Don: 
There's two dogs up 
in there, don't 
know whose they are. 
Milt: 
That might be the coonhunters. 
Where do you think we should go? 
Can you come around here, I 
want you to meet somebody. 
Don, come meet these folks, they're 
from the Library of Congress in Washington, and this 
is Don 
Cramer. 
Carl: Howdy. We're fixed up with cameras and tape 
recorders, Mr. Cramer, we're gonna get every bit of this. 
Milt: 
And this 
is Bob Hageman. 
This 
is Mary and Carl. 
Milt: Now 
shall we pick up and start somewhere else, or whadda you think? 
Don: I was gonna go 
in 
the line up 
'ere and walk 'at. 
Milt: 
Chicken Road? 
Don: Yeah. Milt: Alright, how 'bout if I strike to 
the swamp to the left. 
CB static. Milt: Oh, those dogs are 
is 
the swamp. 
Don: 
Why don't you walk in that line, 
I'll 
be up, 
Milt: Chicken line? 
Don: Yeah, I just got 'em in there a little 
ways, and they was harkin' to them other dogs. 
Milt: 
And then 
if you get somethin' Jim, give us a call. 
If not, come up the 
chicken line. 
Mary: Don't you guys use CB handles? 
Milt: Yes, but, when we're 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 113 
hunting other places, we have handles, but up here, we're alone, 
you're isolated here. . . Handles? 
Milt: Red Fox, Gray Fox, MC, 
(that's him), and that started way back 
in the office. 
there was 
an R R Collins and an MC, and when the office girl would come out 
she'd call 
"RR" or "MC". 
And I got MC for 20 years. 
Well, I 
hope we can hit this gray fox 
in here. 
Carl: 
Now I missed out on some of the stuff you were tellin 
Mary. 
Is Chicken Line the name of a road? 
MC: Yes, that's 
right. We dump chickens there. 
Back here's a duck road. 
A man 
killed twenty—four bluebills, hung 'em up 
in his garage, and 
it 
was no good, he never shoulda done it. 
It was warm and they 
spoiled, so he come up and dropped 'em 
in that line there where 
they're parked and walking 
and that's the reason they call 
it 
the Duck Road. 
043 
Mary: 
What do you mean by a line? 
MC: 
I'll show ya up here. 
Oh, this is such a beautiful night, we've just got to hit 
something. 
Mary: What makes you think it'll 
be a gray fox up 
here? 
MC: Because we've hit 'im here before. 
Mary: Do you have 
a name for 'im or anything? MC: No, and once 
in a while you run 
'em so hard that they move, move to another area where they're 
not pestered, see. 
Mary: How do you keep that from happening? 
MC: You don't. 
You run a fox, sometimes he'll stay in the 
territory, con't bother runnin' out of 
it. 
A fox can lose the 
dogs most anytime they want to. 
They run right down the middle 
of this road and it's very hard, the conditions have to be 
absolutely right to smell his track, and many times when we get 
too close to a fox he'll come out and run a road like this for 
three miles and your chase is over. 
MC: 
(negotiating about whether all three of us will go or 
someone will stay and listen to the CB. 
Carl persuades him to 
let all 
of us go.) 
MC: How 'bout it, Don? 
(inaudible) 
MC: 
These dogs are runnin' right here along the edge of the road. 
I 
couldn't let a dog out, 
they're right here now. 
Uh, we're gonna 
have to reconnoiter. 
shall we go over on the coal 
road? 
Don: 
There's a little area...I don't know but they'd try to hark over. 
MC Yeah, I can't let out, they're tongin' too much. 
shall we go 
over on the coal road? 
Don: Yeah, 
let's go over on the coal 
road. 
MC: Alright, I'll 
be back, and do you want to go around by 
the campground and strike toward me, and I'll 
go around this -
other way and strike toward you. 
Don: Yeah, okay. 
080 
MC: Okay, then you're goin' that way. 
Is Jim right there? Don: 
Yeah. 
MC: Tell 
'im what we're gonna do, okay? 
And I'll go over 
there and start then. 
Ladies and Gentlemen if you'll just pack 
up, we're gonna change territories because of these dogs here, 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

they're runnin' a deer. . . Me: Would your dogs run a deer? MC Oh 
no. 
ME: whose dogs are runnin a deer. hiC: 
Well, these could be 
house dogs, they dont have to be hounds, or, occasionally, Jake 
Meredith, remember you were up talkin' to him? 
He 
is a real, 
he's got money, and he buys lots of dogs. 
Every once in a while 
he buys a deer dog. 
Well, see that could be 
like that. 
(Shouts) Hey! Stop it! 
They're not supposed to bark there, 
they'll get to fightin' 
if you let 'em go. 
I got the wrong dogs 
together. 
I put certain dogs together and they don't fight, see. 
I have four, my boy has one, Don has six, another friend has six, 
another friend has four, and this boy here has one.

G-Penn State Forest; 26GT Dogs trailing -- echoes. 
Not full-bodied, but occasionally nice. 
A truck starts. Milt 
comes over and gets 
in ours -- "We might have to go all 
the way 
around and get on another road. 
If we're gonna stay here, you 
can get 'em here -- now this is not close enough for you 
is 
it? 
(We think it 
isn't.) 
Milt: 
Okay, just give me a good chance to 
listen here , and we'll 
go back by your car. 
(We hoped to grab the radio mike out of 
it) 
At this point we pass the car and get out to get the radio mike. 
Dogs audible 
in the distance.•Another truck pulls up. 
Hufford: 
Does your wife ever go with you? Milton: No. 
A long quavery note 
from one dog. 
I ask Milton to tell me something about the dogs' voices. 
He has to cross the swamp, however, at that point. 
One dog 
becomes very close. 
Milton: Susie! Dcha! Dcha! Dcha! Dcha! 
(a 
pause) 
I'll 
be right back. 
(recorder off) 
Milt to Don: 
They missed it down the road. Always harked 
the wrong way. 
This has been a beautiful night. 
Don: You mean 
weatherwise! 
Milt: Well, we've gotta get this pair of dogs 
somehow. 
Don: Where are they? 
Milt: They went up this road, and 
the 
last I heard they was way up this road. 
..That's soft sand 
and I can't make it. Don: Where'd Bob and them go? 
Milt: They're 
Hufford--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 116 
down at the bottom of this hill waitin' for me to get these dogs. 
Don: This 
is your two in here? 
Milt: Yeah! Rock and Susie. Don: 
Did they get theirs? Milt: Yeah, whatever was runnin' this road. 
Don: Them deer dogs was over here. 
Milt: yeah. 
Why 
in 
the 
world? 
You want to go down and see 
if you can hit it across the 
road? 
Don: Where's Fly at, you know? 
Milt: She's up this road. 
I harked her in behind, and they flipped across the swamp and 
went down and run this. . .that dog's clear to the other end of 
the world. 
I don't know where he's going, he's goin back this 
track. 
He was back this road, not the track. 
Don: Right there's 
where he went across -- he ain't in there too far. 
I hollered at 
'em. 
Milt: I think she's foolin' around on the back track. 
I'll 
pick up my friends and we'll back up there a ways. 
Wait a 
minute. 
(Milt must be on the radio mike by now) Milt: Now I'll 
reconnoiter, and you won't need your equipment on this session --
I'll 
hark these dogs 
in behind those other dogs and the fox run 
the road -- I told you, when they run this paved road they can't 
smell 
it? 
Carl: Yessir. Milt: That's exactly what happened up 
there on the hill, and they've lost the fox. 
Now I hark my dogs 
in -- 
Mary: Was it a gray fox? 
Milt: Yes, and the way you tell 
is 
the doubles that it makes. 
Now let me listen and I'll 
be back 
in. 
Turns off the truck and gets out. 
Carl and I get out every 
time he does. 
Loud sniff. 
Mary: Is that a house dog? 
Milt: 
Yes. That's a camp. 
(bow—wow—wow) 
Milt: Prettiest night in 
the 
world. 
Mary: How can you tell 
the fox 
is making short doubles? 
Milt: By the way the dogs sound. 
When they're runnin' and the 
fox don't double, oh they just -- they fly. 
But a gray fox don't 
run 
like a red fox. 
A red fox makes long sweeps and he'll cover 
four or five miles. 
A gray fox, many times you can park in one 
place and listen to 
it. 
(pause) Hwey! Hwey! (high—pitched) Rock! 
Susie! Hey! Hey! Hey! •Rock! Susie! etc. Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! 
Hwey! 
(a faint echo) 
Dcha! Dcha! Hey Rock! Hey Susie! They're 
comin', I hear the brush crackin'. 
C'mon! 
He lets the truck 
back down. Cmon! 
Coaxingly. 
Man, I done wrong here, didn't I! 
Harked you 
in the wrong way! 
`Get in the box, c'mon. 
Let's go 
show these nice folks how to run a fox. 
You're tryin' hard, but 
we're not makin' 
it. 
Got a nice warm box here for you. 
(Sounds 
of dog toenails scuttering around on the 
inside of the truck box, 
accompanied by panting). 
Now we're ready. 
We're gonna go to a 
different territory and see how we make out. 
Haaa. 
This night 
is 
too beautiful. 
(Carl agrees) 
And if they could jump a fox 
tonight, 
it would just raise your hair up on your back! 
I don't 
want this recorded so turn that thing off, but a foxhunter has , 
got to be half crazy and have a lot of money. 
(Laughs) 
This-is 
what you do, you ride around like this -- Carl: The money's for 
gas as well as hounds? Milt: Yeah. ..We're going over to the coal 
road, and that's near the Pilgrim Camp, and see what we do from 
here. 
Now here's somebody comin up here -- that could be Robly, 
or 
it might be the other hunter too. 
What do you say, where are 
we going? 
Wind that winda down, please. 
Don, where we going? 
Prince Place or the Coal Road. 
Where shall I start to strike? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 117 
Don: Go down 
in a little ways 
Milt; Shall I go just go down p 
the bad place? Don: Yeah. 
Carl gets out for more batteries. 
Milt: I hope you don't run out before we strike a fox. 
..Well 
this 
is foxhunting. 
You come out some nights and hit one right 
exactly -- Oh! and have a good chase. 
Other nights like this you 
just strike all 
over the world and try to get close to where they 
have been feeding. 
Carl: Well what about trapping? Milt: A leg— 
hold trap will catch anything that puts its foot in 
it and then 
that mars the animals. 
If they would use box traps then you 
could let the animals out that you didn't want. 
Milt's seeking 
to have 
it banned. 
We stop the truck. 
Milt: Now boys and girls what do you say 
if we just go ahead 
here and 
(dogs are really squealing loudly) and see 
if we can't 
find a track. 
We're ridin' behind 'em. Come on Susie let's find 
a fox. (Carl decides to walk for a bit.) Milt: There's been a fox 
right there. (pause) Are you accomplishing what you came up for? 
(I 
assure him that we are: In this project we're looking at ways 
the people use the woods) 
Milt: This 
is a pleasure, and you 
don't hurt anything. 
You don't cut holly trees, you don't gun 
anything -- this is just a sport. 
Hufford: 
It doesn't seem as 
though many young people are doing 
it. 
Milt: No. That is one of 
the problems. . .C'mon Susie (in annoyance, because she can't 
hear him). 
Bob comes in on the radio. 
Milt: Bob! Didn't you know where 
we were going? 
. . We hit up past the Bad Place toward the 
Prince Place -- I thought you knew. 
(radio sputters) Bob: Can 
you hear me Jim? Jim: (on radio) Yeah I'm comin'. 
Milt: I 
brought a quart of hot tea. 
( I comment on the lack of rest 
rooms -- Milt: Now that you mention it, 
I'm the father of four 
girls, and don't you suffer from anything, we'll 
let you off --
there's a rest room behind every tree! (laughs) 
Oh listen! No --
they're to the right. 
(we get out) 
Don, we can't hit close to 
one. 
Don: (something about deer dogs) Milt: (hushed and 
incredulous) but his dog's not a deer dog, 
is 
it? 
Don: Jake's? 
Milt: Oh, yeah 
(nice note) 
Milt: that sounds backward to me. 
It 
is too. 
they've smelled along this road. 
I've got some 
beautiful donuts in there and some hot tea, and as soon as we can 
jump a fox, then I'm ready to eat, you know what I mean? 
Alright, Susie, (Susie 
is nowhere within earshot) Why can't we 
get a little action here? (a note) that's it. That's in the box, 
that sounded good. 
( a beep?) 
Don, I have run that white dog 
past fifteen deer deliberately -- saw 'em in the road. I don't 
understand. 
But these dogs never did reach where they had gone. 
They are foolin' around on the path 
in there -- the fireline.-
He'II tongue a track older than she will, but if 
it's that old, 
it's almost too old. 
(notes interspersed) 
Man, all my dogs have 
been sick, and I mean sick. Three of 
'em had bad feet. (some 
distant notes and a nearby respones -- Milt bursts into a short 
laugh) Wonder where Susie is? Alright, we'll 
load up. 
(We get 
into the truck) 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 118 
25 min 
There's firelines here the state cut, and once in a 
while they'll hit a fireline here trailin, and they make pretty 
good time. 
Now that dog made pretty good time. 
He really left 
out of here. 
Mary: And the fox'II 
run right down the fireline? 
Milt: Yeah, feedin' and everything. 
They don't go that slow, a 
dog don't, and that's one opportunity they have to get close to 
the fox ... See there's the fireline right there -- that's what 
he's 
in. 
..See these deer tracks in•the road? 
Full of them. 
Mary: Now what's the likelihood of ever seeing a fox on a night 
like this? Milt: None...Listen!

Tramping through some brush. 
Milt comes back to 
truck: Let's see 
if we can get a little closer than this. 
(On 
CB) How 'bout it Don? 
Don: Go ahead Milt 
Milt: Are you anywhere 
near 'em? Don: I'm just goin' across the bridge, maybe I'll 
take 
a listen right here. 
Milt: You might put some dogs with them if 
they're anywhere near it. 
Don: Oh yeah. 
Milt: I guess I shoulda walked in there where they quit. 
Jim: Yeah, you woulda found out what happened. 
Milt: You're 
right. 
He's gonna let us know if they're anywhere near. 
3 min tape seems to be blank here for a stretch. 
Then: Milt 
laughs: Boy isn't this such a beautiful night! It's always the 
way, 
isn't it? 
(there's a buzz from the radio mike) 
This 
is the 
prettiest night we've had 
in a long time. 
Jim: You shoulda been 
here last week. 
Milt: 
In that rain. 
That's when you jump a 
fox. 
Jim: 
It was rainin' 
and they were runnin' crazy. 
(They 
couldn't hear the dogs, but the dogs could smell the fox) 
Jim 
calls to a dog. 
Milt: Just leave 'im 
in there, son, that's 
alright. 
Mary: (to Jim) How many dogs have you got in there? 
Jim: just one. 
We think they pulled a no—no. I don't know if we 
should tell you that or not. Milt: No, don't tell 
her. 
Mary: 
Are they running a deer? 
Milt: No! Never! That can't be! 
Jim: 
They never have, so we figure they coulda been runnin a rabbit or 
anything. 
Milt: or a phantom or a ghost. Jim: He's a phantom dog 
Huff ord--83 Reel —to— reel 
logs 
page 120 
anyhow. 
Milt: We call him the general 
Jim: Yeah, cause he shows 
up and takes charge (indiscernible) He run excellent there. 
..C'mon Don. 
That don't make sense, jump that fox 
in the rain 
and the wind, come up here this kind of a night and miss it. Jim: 
Tom was runnin' up here all 
day, that's what's wrong. 
Mary: 
Would that mean the fox would stay in? 
Jim: 
It would still 
be 
in 
the area where they broke it. 
Milt: Well I think we should go 
back to the fireline -- she may come out. 
(Susie) 
Milt: on CB : How 'bout it, Don? (static comes in) Do you 
hear anything? 
Don: Yeah, he was tongin' 
it, but I hadn't heard 
her anymore, and now he's cooled a little bit. 
Milt: Are you 
anywhere near 'em? Don: No, nowhere near 'em -- right about in 
the middle. 
(to us) To the right up here 
is what we call the Bad Place, 
all 
briars and everything. 
I made a quart of tea -- I'm not much 
of a cook when my wife 
is away, but if you'd like a cup of tea--
and there 
is a good donut. 
(We're using the truck hood for a 
picnic table, as we all 
chow down) 
7 min Hufford: Who puts these Firelines in here? Penn State 
Forest? Milt: That's right -- so they have a chance to either 
backfire or catch -- they have such terrible forest fires here. 
(He hasn't worked to put any out, because he doesn't think he 
really knows what he's doing) (long pause) 
Milt: Hmph! (Longer pause, and an occasional swallow -- the 
recorder was off for a bit too) They went in the woods because 
they might come back on that same thing. Have another donut. 
(more idle talk about donuts and tea) 
Whaddya know, Jim? 
Anything? 
(indiscernible) 
Milt: That, or they stopped, I don't 
know which one 
it 
is, I think I should go down where they went in 
and wait. 
I'll 
let you by. . .Maybe you should go around to Don, 
huh? 
Well -- We'll 
load up and let these gentlemen by us, 
and 
then we'll 
go down the road to where they went in and wait there. 
This 
is exciting. 
Alright, shall we load up? Get our gear and 
paraphernalia. 
We drive off. 
Milt: Let me just take Biscuit alone. 
C'mon Biscuit! 
(Sounds of dog hacking and panting) 
Now Son, 
it was to the 
right, wasn't it? 
See 
if we can find a path here. 
Find it! 
Find 
that old fox! 
(Static on radio mike) 
C'mon! Find this fox! 
Watch that dump! (going through thunderous brush) 
15 min Something barks. 
Milt: I gotta go out now and see 
if 
I can locate those dogs. 
Jim, would you go back -- I thought I 
just heard her tongue. 
I gotta go up 
in there and see where 
she's at, Jim. 
Listen! 
I'm hearin' that house dog. 
Biscuit! 
C'mon. Son, would you go, turn your radio on and go back by the 
pond? And I'll 
go up and see 
if I can get them. 
Man, that pair 
of dogs're runnin'. 
I'm hearin' a house dog -- but they should 
come back up there! 
C'mon, get in here. Put 'im 
in on the right. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

Get in there, Biscuit! 
(Growling and barking) Boy, that puppy's 
ornery. 
(We drive off) 
18 min 
this 
is the Prince Place Road, and that's the Bad 
Place there on our left. Carl: It's too thick to walk through, 
is 
that the idea? 
Milt: Oh, 
it's just terrible! 
We jump a fox once 
in a while and he goes down 
in there and he just crawls around in 
through the briars, and the dogs can't follow him. 
Or it's hard 
to follow him. 
A fox is smaller than a dog, see? 
You have to do 
this two or three times to get the chase that you want. 
We don't 
hit 
it everytime as you can readily. 
Carl: If you did you'd get 
bored with 
it, wouldn't you? 
Milt: That's exactly right. 
Milt: I go out two days, Monday and Wednesday usually, and 
then Friday night. 
My boy has Wednesday morning off and then 
Friday night. 
So that's two times that we get together. 
No 
tellin' where these dogs'II come out now. 
(Stops the truck) 
20 min (Gets out to 
listen) Whoop! Whee! 
(a dog growls 
in 
the back -- Milt swats the side of the truck: "Hey! Stop it!") 
Hwoop! Hwae! 
Say, I forgot to ask you, do you folks want to stay 
a while or do you want to go? Carl: We'll stick with you. 
23 min (we're driving again) 
They just run different than 
our hounds -- the Virginia Hounds -- a different breed from 
Walkers. 
Where are you from Carl? 
Carl: Central Ohio. 
Milt: 
they run red fox across the fields there, not in the swamps like 
we do -- or do you have a lot of swamps? 
(Carl knows people with 
coonhounds -- but no foxhunters) 
Milt: I am not a coonhunter. 
It's a different ballgame. 
Totally different. 
Why, they chase a 
coon and the coon goes up a tree and then the dogs bay -- they 
call 
it treein' the coon and then the men go and shoot the coon 
out of the tree, but the coon never trees, he always takes the 
deepest swamp, and, oh, following those bayin' dogs around --
that don't suit me much. 
But, see, that gets 
in a man's blood. 
I'm hurryin' -- they said maybe they were gonna cross the 
road -- clear up here by the -- they were miles from where I was 
callin' -- These CB's are wonderful things. 
In the old days 
you'd just have to guess where they were. 
Save time and gas. 
Carl: This whole operation reminds me of my days 
in the army, 
seems I 
i 
ke k 
i 
nd of a mi I 
i 
tary affair. 
27 min (we stop) Milt: He acts like the dogs are ahead of 
'im.

MC: Calling "Heah! Heah!" (dog 
in truck growls) He turns to 
him and says: "Man, you are mean!" 
Then, to ? "What do you 
think?" Some scattered squealy barks. 
MH: What's happening now? 
MC: Well, they're trailin' an old track. 
We haven't been 
able to get anywhere near 'em. 
It's an old track, see. 
They 
miss 
it, 
hit it, miss it, hit'it -- " 
MH: 
Is somebody in there with them? 
MC: Yeah. Bob and Jimmy. 
MH: Are they tryin' to call 
'em in? 
MC: Well, they were gonna catch 'em, but 
shall I hark 'em 
in? 
Hey! 
They'll never get mine, I'm afraid. 
Men's voices in the distance rounding up the dogs. 
MH: They won't go to anyone else? 
MC: Well, sometimes, 
like Jim and I hunt together, sometimes 
they'll come to another, but most of the time they won't. 
Dogs 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 123 
are usually one man dogs and they usually get in the same car. 
Now, there's all type a dogs just like there are all 
type a 
people. 
Some dogs are so friendly they'll jump into anybody's 
car, and they're easy to steal. But we've got some dogs, that 
Susie, he can't catch her. 
I'll have to go 
in and get her. 
Whooping of distant men. 
MC: No way. Never catch Susie. 
I guess I should go 
in 
there. 
Well you'll have to call again when you're in the area. 
Now in another month we won't hunt nights. 
It gets too cold. 
MH: Nightime's good for listening? 
MC: Oh, no planes or anything. 
It's beautiful. 
Nightime's 
the time to hunt. I really enjoy it, from about March on. 
(distant dog -- squealy bark. 
Growl from the back of the 
truck ) 
MC: This dog 
is really something. 
He's ornery. 
Biscuit! 
Why don't you stop that! Now stopit! That dog's not botherin' 
you! 
I'm sorry we didn't have a chase, but that's the way some 
of the n 
i 
ghts are. 
MH: 
Is one of the dogs named Whiskey? 
MC: Well, 
it was -- I baptized him Biscuit. 
(pause) Let's load up and we'll go back and get a little 
closer to 
'em. 
MH: What's the dog with the high --
MC: -- squeak. 
That's Susie. 
That's the reason I think so 
much of her. 
She's got such a nice note. 
In truck. 
MC: Maybe they'll jump this fox. 
I hope so. 
MH: That sometimes happens? 
MC: Oh! So many times that happens! Just when you're ready 
to come home. 
Now there's a old road here to the right -- we 
have got to watch for it. 
Or, maybe we're not as far as I think. 
MH: Did you belong to the foxhunter's association of South 
Jersey? 
MC: Yes, but they really lost their punch when the men 
stopped coming. 
They used to have field trials and that sort of 
thing. 
Once a month they had meetings -- they would plan field 
trials and (boy, I'm goin' up here an awful distance -- does that 
look like an old road? -- he gets out to check) 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 124 
They'd tell these tall stories about foxhunting. 
They'd 
just stretch the truth, that's it. 
Maybe they got 'em. 
(into CB) How 'bout it, Bob? 
Bob: They're right here 
in the road. 
MC: Okay, I'll 
be back 
(we go back) 
MC: talking to the dogs: 
Get in 
! Susie! C'mon! (dog 
growls in the truck) 
Okay, son, you're all 
set? 
Wednesday 
morning if we go we'll come up here. 
(General exchange of good—byes and goo d—to—meet—yous) 
MC: Well, this has been a bad night, but we do have these 
nights. 
Carl: It's part of the true story. (Susie whimpers in the 
back) 
MC: Oh, man, all the way home she'll be that way. 
Bob: Say, 
I'm sorry you didn't get to hear the great things 
that happen up here, rather than all the messin' around we did 
tonight! 
MC: Can you imagine jumpin that fox 
in the wind and rain 
last week and running him all 
that time, and now such a beautiful 
night, and trailed all-over everywhere. 
Bob: They won't believe that. 
They'll figure we got stories 
just like the fishermen. 
Carl 
is mightily amused. 
MC: 
How bout them trailin. 
They musta hit that fireline 
and come all 
the way down to the Ridge Road, come across the 
swamp. 
Now if I was alone I'd a never found them. 
I'd been up 
there hollerin. 
Bob, the best to you. 
Have a nice thanksgiving 
and a weekend, and see you next Friday night. 
Say, how you 
workin next week? 
Maybe you can get a day off? 
Bob: (avers) 
MC: Well, 
let's get friday off! Just tell the boss. 
BOB: I could get sick 
MC: Well, we don't need to get sick. 
Tell him you're sick 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 125 
of work. 
...But I don't think anything happened. 
I don't think 
my dogs ever made it. 
Bob: I don't believe so either. 
MC: We'll see you. 
MH: What do you mean? 
MC: Well you own a dog for years and years and years and it 
don't run a deer, and then one of these nights that some dog 
don't hark to 
it, 
like mine didn't do, 
and you wonder whether 
they jumped a deer. 
but when they're as old as his dogs are, and 
so excellent, impossible almost. 
Many times I've seen deer in 
the road and 
let the dogs out just to go across it to make sure 
that they're not takin' 
to deer 
MH: 
Could you describe to us exactly what happened tonight? 
MC: 
Yeah. 
It's such a beautiful night, moonlight night, 
fox starts early in the afternoon, travels all over, eating, and 
we were just never lucky enough to hit the track that was close 
to where he was. 
We was always hittin' so far in back of him; 
trailin', trailin', they trailed over everywhere tonight. 
MH: They never really were running? 
MC: No, they never really got up to 
'em, except at that 
spell where they jumped that fox that run this road. 
MH: Where did he take them? 
MC: He only made one long 
loop, and run that road down 
in 
the field -- this paved road. 
And that kills the chase 
in a 
hurry. 
MH: Now, suppose you had a foxhunter here who was just 
getting started as a foxhunter, would he know what was happening? 
MC: No, and you never know. 
they're so different. 
Fox are 
so different. 
And they never run the same route. 
The only way 
you can tell you're on a fox 
in a general area is that he stays 
within this road and the Coal 
road, one gray fox out here that 
you can get in there to catch it, 
to run 
'im, who will not cross 
this road or the Coal Road, which runs parallel to this two miles 
over. 
MH: How long has he been around? 
MC: We run 
'im for the last year off and on. 
Now two weeks 
ago he come out in the road right up there, feedin', and Don come 
up at quarter after six and was runnin' 6:30 -- he was runnin' 
'im. 
So when I got here 6:30 I just harked to 'im. 
Hufford--$:3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 126 
MH: do you have to ask permission to throw you dogs in on 
another man's? 
MC: No. 
We get along very well for a group of men. 
And 
that's the idea. 
That's the reason we have these CBs. 
If 
somebody else jumps a fox, call me. 
Let me come up, 
I'll hark 
in, 
see, because I do it with them. • I scatter old bones along 
here, and every once 
in a while the fox'II come here and eat. 
MH: 
Does Robly only go 
in the daytime? 
MC: Only in the daytime. 
And I only like to hunt at night. 
That's when the wind lays, and there's no automobiles, and no 
planes -- I told you about that bombin' area-- Oh, they make such 
noise when they're bombin' -- and we're huntin' here right along 
side of 
it. 
(the bombs) are some kind of false affair that look like 
bags. 
Here, I'll 
help you folks. 
We never leave anybody up 
in the 
woods, because they might not be able to get their car started.

We started out at G—Mount Misery; 27GT G—Lebanon State 
Forest; 27GT, across the road from Freeman Taylor's house, before 
dawn. 
We check the mikes first. 
There is often a buzz on the 
radio mike from the windshield wipers, and the rain creates an 
interference on both mikes throughout. 
Norman introduces us to Junie and Junie's girlfriend Carol. 
Carol often goes foxhunting, and sits 
in the cab of Junie's truck 
doing needlework. 
NT: I don't know whether these dogs that went in behind 
where Junie -- because he's probably got the same fox that I was 
on here and he just happened to get on 
'im right quick here and 
they've come right on -- so they've got him to catch, these dogs 
have, but if they get back in hearing anyplace they'll break 
right into 
'em soon as they can hear 'em, yeah, 
'cause they know 
dogs are ahead of 
'em. 
MH: A red fox? 
NT: There's no doubt it's a red one because we haven't run 
any grays so far at all. There's a couple gray ones here but it 
seems like the hounds they get on the red ones all 
the time. 
(I 
introduce the tape, Elaine and I discuss the equipment) 
NT: 
They gotta get bunched up there now -- (goes to shut the 
lights off) 
(Good bunch of notes) 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 128 
You know, 
it wouldn't surprise me 
if I've got a different 
fox than what Junie has, because i think his dogs went to the 
right and these dogs are goin' right around to the left. (rain 
begins falling on the mike) 
They're not trailing -- they're 
running. 
042 MH: Can you identify the notes? 
NT: Oh sure -- yeah -- I know 'em all -- those little high 
notes are Becky and Li) -- and that big long high note 
is Sailor. 
The big coarse note -- (imitates it) Arwoohr! -- is -- uh -- Nip. 
MH: Who's in charge? 
NT: Nobody's in charge -- all 
run the same gait and anyone 
who hits 
it right -- and that's the way I like 'em -- I want 'em 
all 
to run together...Never thought it would be raining today 
when I came out. 
(listening) 
They're really too far to hear 
now, but they should be comin' back. 
One thing, you're on good 
roads here, Mary, with your car. 
Pomeroy, he got behind where 
Johnny's been and so he'll probably pick up and be over. 
(Elaine and I debate putting an umbrella over the mike) 
066 They're over there a long ways. 
I got five dogs 
in the 
car I'm gonna leave out the first chance I get. 
(We're between 
North Branch and Middle Branch at this point -- of the Mount 
Misery Brook) (nice notes in here) 
097 Elaine Thatcher and Mary Hufford struggling to cover the 
shotgun mike with plastic. 
Norman goes to get within better 
hearing of them. 
Junie comes up and wants to know where he 
is. 
106 Silence. 
The wind was against us that day. Long stretch 
of dogs with the rain pelting on the microphone. 
Norman comes 
back. 
NT: They'll be getting a lot closer, Mary. Sooner or later 
they'll be coming back. (we can hear them again now, along with 
the rain). The radio mike is not working. 
(Good stretch of dogs) 
NT: What dogs was back has made 'em now -- they've caught up 
with 'em. 
(Good long stretch of dogs) 
Norman suggests we stay in the car and keep out of the rain. 
Elaine and I wonder why Norman's mike isn't working. 
He has 
stuffed the antenna into his pocket. 
I go to fix it. 
We're 
still not getting it. 
The dogs are coming. Norman has nine dogs, Junie has 
fifteen. 
They'll be at Middle Branch. 
The fox come from the 
blacktop. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 129 
Norman gets in the truck and turns around. 
We follow him. 
The dogs in the truck are really loud. 
Johnny Earlin drives up. Greetings exchanged. 
MH: 
Is that 
Johnny Earlin? 
JE: That's him. How have you been? ... Is that 
Pomeroy? (meaning the dogs). I tell him it's Norman and Pomeroy. 
JE: We had a good chase. 
We were runnin a gray one, up South 
Branch. 
MH: This morning? 
JE: Went out around 12 o'clock. MH: What 
happened with the chase? 
JE: They went around Mr. Fox's house 
twicet, and they were going back again, and we figured it was 
almost enough, so we caught them. 
It was bad enough, twicet, we 
couldn't get at 'em then -- but when we did -- they went away 
from there and they went over to the briars over there, and then 
when they come back-- we catch 'em. 
MH: You got some good dogs in there? 
Are they the same 
dogs you had a couple years ago? 
JE: Some of them are. 
Some of them are pups that I raised. 
A lot of 
'em isn't two years old? 
Norman comes back. Advises me to go follow where they're 
(the dogs) going. 
We leave him, talking with Johnny. 
(a 
long stretch here where Elaine and I are puzzling over 
the radio mike) 
15 min -- the dogs are really close here, drowning out the 
murmer or men's voices. 
Norman: It's a shame to 
let him have 'em -- it's the truth. 
It's a shame, cause they're all dogs that're -- Jeff's got the 
father -- Sam's the father of three of 
'em, and that blue gyp of 
Jakie's is the mother of 
'em. 
(They jump 
in the trucks and drive up the road about 60 
feet) 
The dogs are loud. 
Norman: You oughta give 'em a chance to 
get halfway there before you dump 'em off. 
DP: Hey! They crossed right up there. 
You'd a waited two 
minutes you'd a had 
it made. 
NT: I would rather seen mine go from the back though. 
DP: What's that, a puppy there? They'll come, they'll come. 
NT: There come some of 
'em right here. 
The ones I like to 
see coming.

Junie's the leader of the pack. 
Junie's been runnin ten times 
more than I have this year. 
I missed a whole month. 
NT: Put my glasses on so I can see now...They should run 
right back and forth here now, shouldn't they? 
Elaine saw the fox. 
NT: 
I was leaving dogs out so I didn't even look. 
It would 
have been better if 
I'd left 'em out after they got on the road. 
Both of us, but they all went and made 'em. 
JB: 
(a comment about a dog) 
NT: He did? 
Well, they've all made 'em then. 
This is what 
it's all 
about. 
Heh, heh, heh. 
This goes on all 
til 
the end of 
April. 
that's all 
they know is to run fox. 
That's their life. 
This little white dog that he put in the car is a gyp that he got 
from me -- I raised 'er and she's just about a year old now. 
She'll probably be good, yeah, this 
is only the second time that 
she's been 
in the woods, so she's got a lot to learn, yeah. Her 
name's Mary (he laughs about this) 
I called her Mary. 
There was 
a pair looked alike so I called 'em Jeff and mary. 
I kept Jeff 
and sold Mary. 
Junie, he keeps all females. 
He doesn't keep any 
males. 
(Sound of a truck gunning) 
Alright, we might as well move on around, Mary, because 
they're over on the big hill and you'll probably hear 'em better. 
(tape off while Elaine and I follow in her car) 
DP 
Trouble is with him, he'll get one'll run halfway decent 
and then sell 
it to somebody. 
NT Who is this? 
DP Wayne 
NT (?) ...he'd better keep it, hadn't he? 
DP Yeah, that's what I mean -- we get him straightened out 
in a few fox chases. 
I'm goin over see what's goin' on 
in Middle 
Branch. 
NT (to us) They'sll go to Middle Branch, and we'll get over 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 133 
to where you'll hear 'em better. 
(break) 
NT: Someones' going to check the dogs. 
Johnny went back to 
collect some dogs. 
(We move again) 
NT: They're over here on this side. 
Now that sounds better. 
There's about forty dogs 
in there. 
(We listen and look 
expectantly for foxes) 
He's comin'! (a loud, shrill whistle) 
No, he's runnin' the other side of us -- I thought he'd cross 
here. 
Norman sends us along while he checks on some dogs that got 
left. 
He doesn't know if they're his. 
(break) 
NT to JB or DP: When they went acrosst the hill 
up 
'ere that 
fox didn't have over a fifty -- sixty yard lead on 
'em I saw 'im, 
then they come right straight down this piece here. 
JB or DP: that's where I thought I heard 'em. 
(break) 
NT: Here's where they went back (looking at tracks) --
they're back over in here Elaine --
(Good stretch of sound) 
He won't run out of this area now. (We were almost to Field 
Bridge between North and Middle Branch. In the back of the truck 
a dog was crying: NT. Hey! Hush up!

DP to NT: Did you get 
in touch with Hound Dog (don't know whose handle that is) 
NT Yeah, he just called me. 
DP complains about the woodcutters about to start up with 
their chain saws. 
NT: How many dogs 
is over there? 
You got 'em all broke? Old 
Gertie's gettin' too old to run red fox -- or gotta get in shape. 
How many dogs you gather?

It's a wild fox anyhow -- yeah -- he's a wild one -- he 
don't like to stay 
in one spot. 
(They talk about where they went 
that morning -- there are foxes in there that they ran last year. 
Norman checks to see whether he has a hat I can wear) 
NT: The fox runs like an old one. 
I just saw the top of his 
back -- I couldn't tell 
you how big he was. (pause) I gotta get 
up 2 a.m. and start for Virginia. 
DP: Really? 
NT: Go down and pick up a bunch of beagles for Jake. 
He got 
28 on the 15th or 16th of October and he's only got three left, 
he said. 
One of them nobody tried yet and we took her over 
Reeves's 
and, damn, she run good. 
I couldn't get over that. 
Jake wasn't sure whether she'd do anything or not. 
she wasn't 
the best lookin' one but she run better than some of them good 
lookin' ones, I'll tell 
ya -- she's fast --she's quick --and she 
shakes a rabbit. 
I wouldn't like her to run with dogs, but 
(listening) 
We'll have enough of this by noon, Junie. 
NT decides to walk up where he can see better: He might 
cross over here, Mary. 
Lotta times they'll run out in these oaks 
over here. (goes off by himself, then, through the radio mike: 
"Hot damn, fox!" 
He comes back) 
Did you say he's goin' across? 
He's goin up (?) swamp isn't 
he? 
they're goin' right up toward the Fantail, but I don't think 
he'll stay 
in the swamp that much. 
(a dog with a quavery voice 
cries out in the truck) 
(break) 
NT: 
I'd be more apt to b'lieve they'd go back towards Middle 
Branch, on the blacktop road. ..They're covering about five mile 
-- cause they was way deep across Broken Arm Road. 
This is bad 
runnin' here -- there's three cricks come together here -- and 
there's a lot of water 'n' hassocks 'n' 
swimmin', yeah. 
(when 
they run 
in the water, 
it takes the noise out of 
'em and whatnot. 
You don't hear as many dogs hollerin'. they gettin' across 'er

known to Pudgy: walk—behinds and ride—behinds. 
We got three of 
the ride behinds now, take an 11 foot swipe each one of em does 
-- takes a bog

They have six to a crew. 
We have six

in from Philly, gathers the berries off the waters and we 
knock 'em. 
I'm always runnin' them pickers, I am. 
He only does 
cranberries. 
They helped set blueberries out this year. 
We build floodgates and build dams and everything after 
cranberrying's over. 
We do mechanic work, trucks and tractors we 
have to fix. 
We build gates til 
the ground freezes, and build 
dams. 
Glenn Horner,

He's lived here about 18 years. I been workin

I been 
workin 35 years on bogs, I have. 
I used to hand scoop when I was 
fifteen. 
And I had to put tapes around my fingers because we use 
to run our fingers through the vines. 
Had a bunch of people out 
there on their hands and knees. Used to use those little square 
boxes, then hand scoops, then they done away with that, then they 
went to the walkin' pickers, then they done away with that, now 
we got the ridin' pickers. 
Pudgy was born 
in Tabernacle.

Liz's maiden name 
is Hull, she's from Florence over near 
Burlington. 
My brother was going with his sister, 
in fact 
they're married, and he came over to pick his sister up, and 
that's how we met. 
She spent no time at all 
in the Pines before 
she married him.

You have to wait til your husband comes home and 
u there 
in the car. 
I did work at American Catheter-- putting heart catheters 
together, and used to work at a knitting mill running knitting 
machines. 
Then I moved way out here and I lost my job, and I 
worked for Bonn studio for a while in wood carving, and I got 
sick and I quit work and I stayed home painting mostly. 
Even as 
a child I used to draw all the time, and different ones gave me a 
lot of encouragement, and when I worked at American Catheter the 
paid for me to go to art school (the CB radio comes on 
then) 
in Burlington County College, I did two paintings 
Allen Towers, who owned the company, and he gave me a 
dollars each for pictures of his home. 
She usually paints wildlife and landscapes, preferring 
watercolor over oils and acrylics which she also does. 
One 
painting is of the ruins of Harrisville. 
Pudgy: I remember the 
walls for years being there. 
It sits right along the road, going 
up toward Oswego. 
Near Harrisville Lake. 
She painted it from a 
picture. 
The Chatsworth Hotel that Mary—Ann is working on. 
It 
wasn't a hotel 
in their memory. 
Stevenson's mother was born 
in 
it. 
Pudgy: I remember Stevenson lived 
in 
it. 
Liz put the 
flowers in for coloration. 
What I didn't know when I put it 
in 
there was that those trees really did stand there. 
(Carl gets 
his camera equipment out 
to take some pictures) 
Pudgy: They have some friends that gather for a living: 
cattails, cat paws, grapevines, and birch poles, cedar poles, 
laurel, they make a living in the woods year round. 
Half of 
Chatsworth they just work for theirself, that's all they live out

of 
is the woods. Biggest part of G—Chatsworth; 27GT that's all they 
ever done. 
MH: Who are some of them? 
PB: Dilkeses, Bowkers (pronounced Bowgers). 
Somebody down 
on the shore buys the stuff. Liz: Richardson I think buys the 
stuff. PB: And down around Whitings on Route 70 (he must mean 
Allyn's Manufactory) . They sold it in Florence too. 
Liz: My daughter's boyfriend did that work. Hazy Dilkes. 
Liz has a two—page typed summary of what it's like to make a 
living out of the woods. 
She says she wrote it down because it's 
hard to remember what they get paid for each thing they gather. 
MH: Have you gone out with anyone? 
Liz: No but my daughter has. 
She used to do 
it to help him 
out. 
She hasn't done any decorative work with the stuff. 
She 
cans cranberries. 
PB has trapped snapping turtles. They'll take 
your finger off quick. Liz wants no part of 
it. 
PB But my 
mother, right today she can still cook 
it. You got to have the 
water just as scalding hot as you can get it, 
so when you cut 'im 
out of that shell -- and you got to know how to clean 'im or you 
poison yourself. 
Everybody can't clean 'em. 
First you gotta 
cut his head off and hand 'im by the tail then he can bleed out 
good. 
Then after he bleeds out good you gotta get the water hot 
as you can get it, put 'im in there, then cut 'im out of that 
shell. 
Then you gotta pull all of his toenails out, then a lot 
of 
'em you get the eggs out of. 
I used to eat 'em but I don't 
eat 'em no more. 
Fried, that's the only way I'd eat it. 
they 
used to have snapper soup parties, but I never ate the soup. 
Picallili 
in sells it. 
I hate soup anyhow. The deer clubs had

t. 
Liz wrote the information up for Mary—Ann because she kept 
asking about it. 
She paints every day. 
She's going to enter some in the 
Gallery at the Burlington County Hospital. 
She has sold a number 
in Medford. 
Displaying them in the window of a gallery there. 
One 
is a painting of a cedar swamp, as she imagines it 
in 
her mind. 
Another is the last house in Mary—Ann's Forge -- taken 
from a book -- it's on the other side of Harrisville. 
Nothing 
there now but cellar holes. 
She put the cellar hole and the jar 
in there herself. 
The trees, mostly cedar are actually there. 
There's always cellar holes 
in old abandoned places, with the 
limestone foundation. She got involved in 
it with Mary—Ann's 
preservation efforts.

Pudgy drew the eagle with the fish in 
its claws, and 
Liz painted it. 
Liz just finished the wild turkeys one 
in 
watercolors. 
Pudgy does some hunting. 
He killed an eight point 
deer three years ago, and 
in 
'63 on the other side of Carranza's 
Memorial a seven pointers. 
Liz gets more into preparing venison. 
It has snapping turtle beat. 
He goes out with five or six guys, 
Liz's brothers, but he doesn't go with a club. 
They can hunt on 
Thompson's property, which is pretty exclusive. 
19 min One that Liz 
is going to frame, another she's going 
to do 
in acrylics. A wild flower painting. 
Taken from a picture 
-- the flowers and the ducks are from the picture, but the trees 
and the lake 
is her own addition. 
Carl comments that it has 
almost an oriental quality with those pinks. 
She did the 
cranberry reservoir that is on Mary—Ann's wall. 
It's just any 
cranberry reservoir. 
Pudgy likes the oils the best, and the deer 
ones. 
Others who paint. 
John Clevenger over in Leisuretown does 
paintings. 
It costs a lot for paint and paper. Watercolor paper 
costs nearly a dollar a sheet. 
The basket on the cabinet -- made by Indian Ann, the last of 
the Lenni Lenape Indians in the area. 
She knows this because of 
a picture in a Medford History Book and 
it had the exact same 
basket in a picture in 
it. 
Pudgy and Liz used to go bottle digging together. 
They sold 
a lot of them to private collectors. 
They think the supply is 
depleted from too many people getting into 
it. 
He shows me a 
bottle patented in the 1700s. gathering

Carl. 
He comments that the reservoir across the road looks the 
closest to home and the piniest. G—Vincentown; 23GT 
CF Actually I'm sort of fond of this one, why don't I shoot 
this one while I'm at it. 
What should we call that? 
Liz: The 
painting of the heron. 
CF What kind of a heron is 
it? Liz: 
Actually I think it's an egret. 
Pudgy: What's the difference 
between this and the stork that carries the babies, little 
babies? Liz: Oh, come on Pudge. 
CF: Well they're bigger birds. 
They have great big bills, they're actually quite fierce ... This 
is another one that made me think of Japanese art, the dancing 
bird. 
I think it 
is an egret.

CF dating the paintings with Liz. Between 1960 and 1980 she 
was raising children and didn't do any. 
She took the course 
in 
1979. Carl 
is pretty complimentary about her work. 
She did do 
some paint by number in her beginning days. She doesn't have any 
of those around.

They used to shoot them 
illegally, but Liz put a stop to 
it. hunting 
Pudgy has two brothers who used to play with him. 
They both 
left their wives and took younger wives and quit playing. 
He 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

page 142 
plays a mouth organ too. Years ago he played a xylophone at the 
Tabernacle school. 
Liz reads some music. 
Buck is 
interested in 
carpentry work, and he's also a baseball fan. CF: Probably joined 
in the futile effort of wishing the Philadelphia team would win 
the big game. 
5 min Liz's mother, at 71, with four fingers smashed, plays the 
piano. 
Carl painted when he was 
in college. 
Pudgy begins a song 
on the guitar. "I Live in Two Different Worlds, Dear". (one from 
Kitty Wells) 
Buck doesn't like country music. 
He likes rock. 
"Folsom Prison Blues" 
(one that Johnny Cash sings) 
Pudgy has the records, including Hank Williams. He plays 
with his brothers. 
Leo, who has the sawmill, wrote his own 
songs. 
Nothing about the pines. 
Someone wrote one about 
Chatsworth. 
Randy Higgenbothem, Wilbur's son, plays Saturday 
night and Sunday night at Joe Bell's bar at Four Mile Circle. 
Then he goes up to Valley Forge and plays for two hours. Bobby 
Dunbar plays with them. 
Pudgy starts another song. They used to play for dances in 
Tabernacle, 
in Dingletown there was a place. Part of 
it 
is 
in the 
Indian Mills township. 
"No Letters Today". 
He knows Emil Brown, 
who plays bluegrass. 
He's been singing down at the town hall 
(Albert Hall?) on Route 9 for fifteen years. Wilbur used to go 
down there. 
Pudgy met Emil down at Haines' bogs years ago. 
He gets 
around to all 
the bogs. Used to work for Steven Lee. 
To set up a 
bog, plow it up, cut harrow it, spread the vines over the top, 
cut them in with cutters set on a tractor. 
The bogs he works on 
now are 80 to a hundred years old, and still bearing fruit. 
You 
have to prune them, and be sure they drain well 
in hot weather to 
make the vines last. 
Haines has so many bogs he can't pick them 
all 
every year. 
Thompson has 40 bogs, and they pick every one 
every year. 
A lot of bogs have half a dozen different kinds of 
berries in them. 
cranberry 
I used to hand scoop. 
I was the last one they found around 
here using a hand scoop. 
MH: How did you know that you were the 
last one? 
Pudgy: Cause the people come from Pennsylvania, and they 
said they been everywheres around here and they asked me 
if 
it 
was alright if they took my picture, because they said I was the 
only one they could find in the whole area that was using a hand 
scoop. 
15 min 
I used to hand scoop the ditches where they couldn't 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 143 
get a 'em with machines. 
I had to get 'em 
in the ditch with the 
hand scoop. 
Things to make with cranberries. Cranberry wine, pie, sauce, 
relish. 
The relish you can put oranges and raisins in 
it, 
cut 
apples into it, and cook the whole berries sweetened, with 
allspice. 
foodways 
CF I'll get a picture of you 
in action, Mary, 
if that's 
alright. 
MH What are all 
the kinds of blueberries? 
Liz: The wild 
huckleberry 
Pudgy: The wild ones make the best pies you can eat. 
They are sweeter. 
You might bite into a worm once 
in a while, 
but you get meat and all that way. 
It's illegal to gather and sell snakes. 
Pudgy used to kill 
rattlesnakes, and catch pine snakes to sell. 
He used a forked 
stick 
in back of the snake's neck. 
They run into a lot of big spiders and turtles, and once in 
a while a big water snake. 
Caught a 20 — 25 pound snapper on 
Friday. 
They get a lot of trouble from beavers, building dams 
and making it impossible to get the water out of the bogs. 
"They'll build a dam better than we can." 
They claim to have 
seen otter, bald eagles.

He makes his picks out of coffee can lids. 
Pudgy may play the 
banjo, with Carl accompanying him on the banjo. 
"Blue Moon of 
Kentucky", Bill Monroe's signature tune. Next: "Will the Circle 
Be Unbroken?" music, song 
A jam session. 
Some discussion of the Waretown bunch -- The 
Albert Brothers ("Way back in the woods") and Sam Hunt. 
Joe 
Albert is the one that has the deer. 
Pudgy knows how to get 
there but hasn't been in a long time. 
He doesn't know the names of the tunes, neither does Carl, 
who suggests we think of 
it as "noodlin' around." Pudgy comments 
on the difficulty of playing the banjo, since you have to play 
both up and down. He acquired the banjo from a friend, figured it 
out in four or five days. 
The friend, from Willingboro, got into

returned four or five days later she found him in the bedroom 
with his head blown off. He'd shot himself.

you about this stuff. 
Liz: No, not too often. 
Only what Mary—Ann brings. 
(Carl 
laughs) 
MH: How often? 
Liz: Oh, once or twice a year. 
Carl promises to send the pictures. 
Pudgy remarks that he's had a lot of pictures taken, and 
hasn't ever seen one. 
The name of this place 
is Peach Farm, though there aren't 
any peaches growing there anymore. 
They do have a garden with 
tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, peas.

People who come here usually want to know about the pines 
and want to take pictures of the house, which is 
150 years. 
The 
deed goes back to 1850 for the front part, which has hemlock 
floors in 
it. 
It had old cedar shakes. 
Pudgy: I lived 
in nine houses in this area. 
I lived way up 
over the railroad track up by Carranza Road, way up in the woods, 
I mean up 
in the woods. 
Liz: Yeah, we lived up 
in there for five 
years. 
MH: What was the name of that place? 
Pudgy and Liz: Friendship. 
Pudgy: Ain't nothin' there now. 
There's nothin' there now. 
And I lived in another place about a mile down to Sandy Ridge on 
this side of 
it, I lived there. 
Then I live 
in four houses in 
Tabernacle. 
Some of 
'em are gone. 
There's two cemeteries in 
Tabernacle. 
Liz: His father's buried on Carranza Road. 
Pudgy: And my grandmother. 
MH: You put grave blankets there at Christmas? 
Liz: Yes. 
MH: Do you know Freeman Taylor? 
Pudgy: Yup. Down on 70. 
He used to have a sawmill there 
years ago. 
I used to work in Mount Misery, and Pakim Pond. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

MH: What kind of work? 
Pudgy: Cuttin' cedar outa there. 
Workin' for Bob Taylor in 
Buddtown in 1960. 
He broke his fingers and quit. 
He worked for his brother 
Stanley in Whiting. 
Jim Sloane and all 
them used to be 
in the 
cedar business down 
in Whitings. 
Pudgy: I used to work all down around in Whitings, I did. 
Pakim Pond and Mount Misery, that was a rattlesnake place. 
Freeman's sawmill was on the other side of Mount Misery. 
Pudgy went hunting with hound dogs. 
People would keep dogs that 
had no names on the collars. 
Pudgy: I've been huntin' ever since I was twelve or fourteen 
years old. At that time you got your license for a dollar. 
Now 
it's about sixteen and a quarter. 
Liz: I can shoot a gun, but I don't hunt. 
Carl: I don't believe I've ever visited a place where 
hunting was as popular as 
it 
is here. 
Pudgy: They used to have barn dances years ago right in the 
cranberry packing house. 
He thinks they danced without a caller. 
They played 
guitars, banjos, violins. 
Used to be a guy played a violin -- old Harvey DeCou (?). 
Over in Medford right now, he's Alan Stokes' grandfather, he 
still plays the guitar and the violin. 
He's 83 or 86. Raymond 
DeCamp. 
I think he still drives a car. 
They had a piano that played the rolls. 
They tried to make 
a roll, one time -- an uproarious failure. 
He mentions "Rockin' Alone in an Old Rocking Chair".

TX01: This is the first tape of a three tape interview. 
It 
should be PFP83—RMHO44. 
The sounds in the background are of men 
sawing wood outside in the front of the large gun club on Baptist 
Road, off of Jones Mill Road, South of the town of Chatsworth. 
It was the larger of the two gun clubs I visited, the other being 
the Harmony Gun Club on Route 563 south of Chatsworth. 
There 
were about twenty men on the premises while I was there, cleaning 
and cutting wood, and cooking. 
I was served several deerburgers 
and some coffee during the interview. 
Like the Harmony gun club 
it had a bar, a dining room, and a kitchen, as well as separate 
sleeping quarters, 
in which the beds were stowed in the wall. 
It 
had a ladies room as well 
as a men's room. 
A fire was going in 
the dining room and 4 or 5 men were seated around it 
in big 
comfortable armchairs. 
I wound up sitting in the room by the 
bar, asking questions of a shifting group of men that usually 
numbered between 3 and 6. 
We begin with statistics: 
000 The men's names (see top of form). 
Thirty two members 
belong. Deer season opens on Dec. 6. 
They come from all over 
south Jersey. 
It started with someone's grandfather. 
1932, 
Reiss's grandfather, Sam Reiss of Berlin, 
David Reiss (Harold's 
father), Clarence Reiss (an uncle?). 
Tommy Sacka, Cap Ross the 
chief of police from West Berlin. 
There was a plaque on the wall 
that 
commemorated the deceased members. 
"This was an old barn 
when we bought it." 
There are about 12 gun clubs right around 
Chatsworth. 
They belong to an association called United Hunters. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 148 
Concerned with upland game and wildlife. 
The fellow who keeps 
offering me the deerburger is named Amos Vibler (?). 
He's a 
little prone to joke about everything. 
Says he misses anything 
he shoots at. 
He presses another deerburger on me. 
034. 
We're in the oldest section of the gun club right now. 
They added three rooms to 
it. 
The bar and sleeping quarters were 
added later. 
The policeman brought his kids, who are playing 
pool. They have a banquet in February in Clemonton. 
Traditions: 
Amos, I'm one. 
I came here so far back, there were Indians 
runnin' up and down the road. 
(laughter) 
We got a member that 
ain't washed his socks for twenty five years. 
Hal 
shows me the plaque for the deceased. 
"We call 
'em 
'Happy Hunters'. 
It encompasses all those who belonged from the 
early thirties. 
they meet on the first Monday of every month. 
Charles Leak (Buster's brother) who lives across the street is 
the caretaker for the club. 
He just watches to make sure no one 
breaks in, 
and checks on the roof after a rainstorm. 
063 
Charlie knows all 
the members. 
We usually come down 
the Friday before deer season. 
We bring all 
of our food down. 
We have a party. 
We have visitors on Sunday from every other 
club that comes down, and we go to their club, we socialize. 
The 
Pine cone Antlers, the Tall Pines, 
Harmony Gunnin' Glub, 
Blackwood Antlers. 
We meet one another in the woods. 
Jones 
Mills, Rosedale, other clubs. 
We gun Chatsworth, Indian Mills, 
Lower Bank, Lebanon Forest. 
MH 
do you know the local hunters? 
(the names Meredith and 
Earlin don't ring a bell with him) 
We go out and 
look over the woods and make up where we're 
gonna drive the next morning. 
Where we're gonna hunt. 
You put a 
certain amount of members in one section of the woods, and you go 
up about a mile or so, and 
stand, and the other half goes back 
in the woods and they drive down to the standers. 
MH: 
What if you don't get a deer? 
Hal: Well, the state's made it so easy today that they have 
doe season, so we very seldom don't have deer. 
Only the male 
deer have antlers. 
Big band record playing now. 
The man who kills the first deer, we give him a bottle, and 
everybody has a drink out of the bottle. 
It don't hurt nobody, a 
little nip. 
We have our banquet, we give out trophies. 
Whoever 
kills a deer we give him a trophy. 
If they aim for a deer and 
miss it? 
Hal: 
Then they get a pair of 
ladies' pants and they 
put 'em on at the deer banquet. 
We cut off his shirt tails. 
(There's a plaque over the bar, the shirt tail club). 
We have 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 149 
skits, what goes on 
in the woods. 
We cut neckties, we out 
shirttails, and put pies 
in faces occasionally, lemon meringue, 
as 
initiation for new members. Bike races for the girls, tricycle 
races, fancy shirt contest. 
We give out every year what we call 
a Presidential award, and we always select one man a year who we 
think has contributed the most to the club, and we give him a 
nice shirt or a jacket. 
The president is 
in Florida on this 
particular. 
The banquet, we've had 34 of them, 
in the Silver Lake 
Chicken Barn in Clementon, New Jersey. 
Every year. 
We have a 
plaque for every year. 
We always reserve the same weekend, 
usually the second weekend in February. 
A miniature moose head on the wall, from Maine. 
The Spartan 
gunning club members on the wall 
on another plaque. 
After 25 
years of being together, a special ticket we all 
signed on the 
way into the banquet. 
!63: 
favorite places around here? 
The Woodshed. 
In the woods? 
We try to follow the deer wherever they go, and that's where we 
try to be. No favorite spot. 
Do you notice different patterns from year to year? 
A deer 
lives the same patterns all 
the time. 
They hunt with dogs 
individually, but not together. 
What's the oldest gun club? 
Jones Mills was one of the 
originals. 
They're no 
longer together. 
Tom Satton, who died at 84, used to sell them the same stove 
every year. 
He'd paint it a different color and then resell 
it 
to them. 
It's hard to keep the same cook year after year. 
Men are 
more apt to form a club to hunt deer. 
"You won't form a club to 
go 
in a field and hunt a little rabbit. 
That's individual." 
Another guy, "You've got to chase the deer, you've got to corral 
them, unless you're goin' pot—huntin' and one walks by. " Pot 
hunting 
is when someone sets in one spot all day and waits for 
one to walk by. 
A tree stand 
is for pot huntin. 
This kind of deer hunting is driving and standing. 
Jacklighting is poaching. 
It's not legal. 
Re: the place. Next Sunday the place will be crowded with 
visitors from other clubs. 
These fellows didn't go to school 
together. 
229. 
Gus Snyder was the oldest guy 
in the club. 
My father 
was 79, Sharpie was 81, Sacko was 83 (this Hal speaking). 
The 
other fellow says, "they gunned with up up until they died." 
Hal: "If you like a sport you continue with it, 
up until you 
die.' 
What sports do you like, they asked me. 
do you like 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 150 
bowling? 
No. 
Do you like baseball? Yes, I said, 
lacking any 
other answer. 
"Well, see! 
You'll probably go watch baseball 
games until you get old. 
It's the same way with us. " I said it 
was probably more like the affection I used to feel for girl 
scout camp." 
Well, said the other voice, the one that sounded North 
Jerseyan to my ear, or like Richard Montemurro, 
in fact. I sued 
to go fishin a lot, down the shore. Wildwood, Cape May. 
Salt 
Water fishing. 
flounders, mostly flounders. 
See bass, flounder, 
bluefish. 
that's about the run of 
it. 
The youngest member? They gotta be 18 years old to be a 
member. 
Children of members can join automatically when they 
reach 18, and children of older members 
are given preference if 
there's a crunch on bedspace. 
We can sleep 45, but it's hard 
servin 45 people, and gettin them out in the woods, and keepin 
them together. 
How many generations of hunters have you had 
in this club? 
The Reisses, there's Sam, Harold, Tommy, three generations in 
that family. 
Jeff Sherwood, had three or four boys, he was one 
of the originals, 
Ruttin season, that's when the bucks start matin' with the 
does. 
THe males, their necks go up and they forget their 
cautiousness. 
They will call together, they'll snort, they'll 
make noise. 
You hear it more bow season than you do gunning 
season. 
302 
Different ways to dress a deer. 
Field dressing is the 
basic way to do 
it. 
I found out last year. 
You have to gut the 
deer so the meat don't spoil. 
Some ways you take some sticks to 
keep the ribs open so it cools down the meat doesn't go bad. 
If 
you left everything intact and you get a deer first thing in the 
morning and afternoon it's swollen up and if the bladder's full, 
you know. 
The best spot for shooting. 
The side shoulder, six inches 
from the front shoulder is where the heart and lung area is. 
The 
vital spot. 
You always try for that to knock em down right away. 
They have scent glands on their hind legs. 
Some guys try to 
cut them off first, but that's old wives tales. 
We just leave 
them alone. 
otherwise you get it on your knife and forget to 
clean it, 
and 
it taints the meat. 
How do you decide who shoots? 
Adam: First you decide 
whether they got horns. 
Another voice: 
Then number 2 is the 
standing and the drivers. 
they're all walking through the woods 
making noise. 
If you get a deer up 
in front of you, 
and you 
can't get a good clean shot, then you have to 
let 
it go. 
It has 
to be 
in front of you or around in back of you. 
You have to have 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 151 
your wits about you 
if you're a driver, because standers don't 
make any noise, and you could be shooting at a stander. 
We got three teams 
in this club: a white team, a red team 
and a blue team. 
The white team are some of the older members of 
the club that may not be able to get around too much, and they're 
always standers. 
And the red team and the blue team alternate. 
Adam: I go out with a shotgun and a meatgrinder. 
If a deer 
looks good I drop the shotgun and go after it with a meat 
grinder. 
He 
invites me to come down during deer season and go 
out with them. 
How do you get your nicknames? 
We come here with a lot of 
'em. 
Some of 
'em get named in the club. 
I had the nickname of 
Peanuts for as 
long as I can remember. 
How about places? 
Well, Sandy Ridge we know by heart. 
(Peanuts speaking) We 
know where pretty near every tree is by heart. 
It isn't too far 
from here. 
Approximately 
7 or 8 miles from here. 
It's across 
from Carranza's monument. 
Carranza's got its name from that 
Mexican flyer who crashed in there. 
In that same vicinity where 
we always hunted.

TXO1: 000 In the lounge of the Spartan gun club G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
A bar is nearby, and 
it 
is Saturday, one week before the start of 
deer season, and the men are preparing the place for a week of 
hunting. 
A couple of guys are getting ready to go out and check 
for deer, as they tend to come out and start feeding between 3 
and 5 p.m. 
"Deer are relatively repetitious," said one fellow. 
"They'll hit the same spot everyday at the same time." 
MH: Do you have names for those sections? place names 
Speaker A: 
How can you name anything like that? It's 
in the 
woods! 
We know what we're talkin' about, but, 
if we tried to 
tell you.. 
Speaker B: 
You know, you might have like the Double Dirt Road or 
Big Hill or Sandy Ridge

There's no 
drinking, you stay within the 
law or you're out. 
that's one of 
the reasons I like this club. 
Speaker D: 
No does. 
Soon as you shoot at a Doe you're out. 
Speaker B: 
I'd like to get more deer, but it's mostly like today, 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

just gettin' together.

A couple of guys leave to go check some spots. 
Speaker D, 
curious about what I'm up to. 
More on the running of the club. 
They collect dues to pay the taxes. 
You used to be able to come 
down here for 18 dollars, three meals a day and a place to stay. 
Everybody donated different things to help build the club. 
The 
way things are now you can't move sideways without getting in 
trouble. 
The deer aren't as plentiful as they used to be either. 
Now you can make drive after drive and not even see a deer. (This 
corroborates Freeman's observations.) 
Speaker ?: Used to be a "pot hunter", with a portable deer 
stand, and then one year someone at the club sponsored him, and 
now he's a member. 
Speaker B: 
Now we just try to get enough deer for the 
banquet. 
Years ago we used to get 17 deer a season, 
enough for 
the banquet and everybody to take some pieces home. 
The cooks at 
the banquet marinate it. 
One year there was much too much 
marinade. 
A deer in this area may have to be marinated in order 
to take some of the wildness out of 
'im. 
Closer to the farms and 
the suburbs, they damn near get domesticated, and 
it don't make 
sense to marinate 'em. 
Wild deer are tougher too. 
The stuffing: 
125 loaves of bread, clams, oysters, butter, all 
the seasonings 
and that stuff. foodways 
Snapping turtles? 
B: He gets the snappers and I cook 'em. 
MH: How do you get 'em? 
B: Just go out and grab 'em. 
A: Just 
pick 'em up crawlin.' 
Sounds of the pool table. 
B: Hang 'em up all night. 
You 
gotta watch the head, because if you throw it 
in the weeds and a 
dog's around and gets into it, 
it could bite the dog, until 
sundown. 
It could bite anybody. 
After sundown, that's the end 
of 
it. 
If you'd a stopped down one night I made 13 gallons. 
That's enough to feed everybody in Chatsworth and their uncles. 
136. 
It's good snapper soup, there's so many ways a makin' 
it. 
It's quite a process, and 
it seems that it's outstanding for 
a particular amount of people. 
Lot of people are particular 
eaters today. 
It's pretty hard to satisfy a group of people. 
His 
is different than Mayo's or the Woodshed. 
He's hunted in Maine, Pennsylvania, Delaware. 
If you're a 
good shot it doesn't do any good 
if you don't see any deer. 
"One 
time here a couple a years back we come down here. They was 
Hufford--$3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 154 
supposed to be here Sunday night to be ready for Monday. two of 
em. We're out there killin' ourself bleedin', scratchin', cold, 
didn't even see a deer, and they come down and they happened to 
stop on the side of the road, one of 'em hadda go on the side of 
the woods, and as he got outa the car he seen a nice big buck and 
he killed the damn buck, and he loaded it up and brought it down 
the club. 
He was one of the members, but he didn't even make no 
effort. 
But that was luck there. 
I know guys crazy over deer 
huntin', I know one guy's hunted 18 years and never got a shot at 
a deer. 
And also a lotta people go out here year after year and 
don't even see a deer, and it's even gettin' worse in this 
particular area. " 
Speaker D: 
(the younger fellow) I can speak for that. 
Nine 
years deerhuntin' I haven't even got a deer yet. 
But I'm not 
discouraged. 
I hunt two seasons. 
I get to be out here with 
everybody. 
Speaker B: You have to be real 
lucky to knock off a deer. 
Everybody's got the same thing in mind, and we don't even know if 
there's a deer out there. 
But if everybody got a deer, 
it would 
be over just like that. 
You have to get it weighed and turn 
in 
your ticket and then you get another ticket the next day. 
I ask 
about marking guys with the blood of his first deer. 
Never heard 
of 
it. 
It's damn near like a lottery, because you take a chance 
and you miss it by one number. 
You could miss it whether you're 
by yourself or with someone. 
Or he could be headed right toward 
you and he veers off, and you don't know why. 
All these 
different obstacles, 
if they didn't exist you might as well throw 
the gun away. 
He shot at a deer, 
it fell down and got up, 
he 
shot at 
it again, same thing, and he lost it. 
Speaker A: 
Re: hides: he wants to make a hip quiver, A make 
a pair of gloves for his wife one year out of the hide. 
Someone 
got a 205 pound deer last week in Delaware, an eight pointer. 
They saw 12 pointers last year. 
The diet governs the development 
of the horns, 
They don't stock the deer around here. 
The state 
used to plant rye "food patches" but stopped. 
MH asks about hunting lobbies. 
Waterford township sportsmen 
meet fairly regularly. 
Speaker C: 
There's an awful 
lot of deer in North and 
Central Jersey, and no hunting area. 
He saw a huge flock of 
pheasants. 
His name's Cliff Maddos, from Berlin. 
He hunts 
rabbit, quail, pheasants, and deer. 
Deer is the most exciting 
quarry. 
Because they're so hard to get. 
they're wily. 
And you 
don't get much chance to shoot at em. 
when you see 'em they're 
usually runnin. If you're quiet enough you might get one to come 
up to you. 
310 Speaker ? A deer's awfully hard to hit. When they're 
runnin', they go eighty mile an hour. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 155 
Speaker D: 
contrary to popular opinion, some people who 
aren't fond of hunting think the hunters have all 
the advantage, 
just think about, 
if you lived 
in New York city all your life and 
you moved out to North Dakota, you don't know where you're at. 
Even the hunting club down here, you may know the woods, but 
you're hunting that specific game deer. 
These animals know every 
leaf, every tree, every little stream, believe me, 
if 
it was as 
easy as everybody said it was, everybody'd have a deer. 
But it 
doesn't work that way. 
They are so smart and intelligent it's 
unbelievable. 
Speaker ? Have you ever followed a deer trail? 
We followed 
up 
in Pennsylvania I think it was, a bobcat trailing a turkey. 
The turkey tracks were in the snow all 
across this log and right 
in back of 
it came these bobcat tracks, 
lookin' for his meal, and 
we were stalkin him! 
You have to be able to read signs to know 
what's goin' on, you find droppings, you find their beds, you 
find buck rubs, which are young saplings that they rub the bark 
off when they take the fuzz off their antlers, and these young 
saplings, about an 
inch and a half 
in diameter, these young 
saplings are all stripped of bark about that high off the ground 
where they slip the head down and get the fuzz off their antlers. 
They polish 'em up, get en ready for fightin for a mate. 
A doe 
when she's 
in season, for a month and a half or so, she looks up 
the buck... 
Another speaker: Did anyone ever mention to you that this 
is 
therapy down here? Soitenly. 
Well you unwind. 
It's a world of 
its own. 
I'm a supervisor of an electric company. 
All outside 
work, electrical construction. 
Your electricity that feeds your 
houses. 
It has quite a bit of responsibility. 
I would say it's 
high pressure, soitenly. 
Speaker B (?) I've worked 42 years for RCA model making, 
engineering. 
I retired 3 three years ago. 
I used to always look 
forward to these two weeks at the end of the year to get away and 
relax. 
You're out in the woods by yourself and its awful quiet. 
No phone in here. 
Just a dummy phone by the bar. 
A stranger 
comes in, 
you say, "hey, your wife's on the phone,' they guy 
picks it up doesn't know it's a dummy. 
You know, when you leave here, you're down here for a week, 
it 
is another world. 
No cars, no nothing. 
and you don't realize 
there's cars until you get up to the white horse pike, and then 
it's the old hubbub again. 
I think our wives are glad to get rid of us for a week once 
in a while too. 
I know my wife gets a lot of things done when 
I'm not home that she wants to do and never gets around to when 
I'm down there. 
The wives come down sometimes. 
they used to 
have an auxiliary and it fell apart. 
We had a big picnic here 
about a month ago. 
All wives, families, friends. 
And they love 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

it cause they don't have to do any work. 
They just come down and 
eat, drink, dance a little bit, and play games. 
Another speaker is retired from being tavern keeper of the 
Old Ship Inn 
in West Berlin. 
It's now closed up. 
I had it for 
fifteen years. 
The young fellow works at the Camden County 
Sheriff Department. 
Someone 
brings me a deerburger at this 
point. 
I sample it, and am very appreciative. 
They ask me some 
more questions about what I'm doing, where I live and so forth. 
They go on record as saying they think the area should be 
preserved. 
"It's really wild," said one. 
"That's not just from the deer standpoint " said another. 
"'course there's a lot of recreation involved, but you got the 
water table, you go destroying this, you got so much land to 
build on, you don't have to go destroying this." 
Another. A few years back they were going to sell the whole 
thing to private enterprise for a couple million dollars. 
(He's 
incredulous) The thing is priceless!

One of the guys had started to tell 
me about the historical ruins around the place, 
including the 
ruins of the paper mill at Harrisville, on the Oswego River, not 
far from where we were. 
Roy was telling me about it. 
Someone named Tony was there 
at this point too. The speaker, whose name I don't know, 
recapitulates his conversation: 
"I was tellin' you about how wild it was, how thick it 
is. 
People can get lost very easily here." 
Has anyone ever? 
No, we're pretty organized when we go 
in. 
We keep track of 
each other. 
Do you work off of topo maps? 
Sometimes, geographically, to get set up somewhere. All 
our 
drives are planned ahead of time. 
By 
landmarks. 
The guy nearest 
the road calls to the guy next to him. 
Everybody moves in 
accordance with the voice. 
Hollers anything: Yo! Yo Buck! 
(a 
little chorus of demonstrations ensues here) If you're bearing 
off to the left, everybody guides off to the left. 
Do you draw up a plan in advance? 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 158 
Well we do have captains of our teams. 
We might make a map 
on the ground, you know. 
"They go 
in here, and the guide's to 
your right, and go right on down and the standers'll be down 
here". 
Someone else takes it up. 
"When you come out you'll come 
out to those men that you were gonna drive those deer to, 
Supposed to. 
Sometimes we go a little to the left or right of 
'em. 
(chuckles) 
(So that must be part of the challenge too, to 
navigate toward the standers and not miss that mark either.) 
And 
if a man gets stuck and he can't move, he hollers. 
The worst time to deer hunt as far as I'm concerned is when 
the wind's really blowin' hard. I like to hunt in the snow, you 
can make out in that. 
I also like to hunt in the rain, which you 
can make out in that. 
But when the wind's blowin', you don't 
know whether you're in the front or 
in the back (cf. the term 
"baffling wind" used by Cliff; also that foxhunters hate to hunt 
in the wind.) 
Another: And 
if a man goes down 
in a hollow, you don't hear 
his voice no more. 
So you gotta be heads up. 
Another: And 
if you think someone's lost. 
you wait and you 
move over towards him and try to 
locate him. But if he comes up 
on a hill or a high piece of ground why you'll hear 'im again. 
Another: If he was the fifth or third man in, everybody to 
the 
left of him will 
be with the guide, so they'll be alright. 
But everybody to the right of him, will be goin with him, and if 
he's going wrong, they're all goin wrong. 
Adam: Put that horn over near me. 
(microphone) 
I think as 
far as I'm concerned it certainly is a free country, but I'll say 
this. 
When it comes to deer huntin and environment, and what 
you're supposed to stand for in a sense, they oughta outlaw all 
the motorcycles that's in the woods. They have hundreds and 
hundreds of motorcycles that travel through the woods, that come 
from all 
parts of the country for endurance, and 
if an animal can 
live under them conditions, good—bye. 
So you don't get into four—wheeling? recreation 
No. 
I went up 
'ere huntin' one time on a bicycle. 
(I hope 
you got that clicked off). 
Man I was really travelling. 
I was 
chasin' a deer up the road on a bicycle. 
The guy from the sheriff's office at Camden County. 
"Hunters are a lot more environmentalists than people give 'em 
credit for. 
We're not murderers. 
We think more about the land 
than 
is given credit. land management 
Adam: If we hit a deer, and he doesn't fall, we'll go track 
'im, the next day too, we'll go back an look for 'im. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 159 
Another: Yeah, people say, oh, you deer hunt, oh, you're a 
murderer. 
Nobody says anything about these guys with the motor 
bikes 
in there, or the guys with the four wheelers that just 
tear the stuff up. 
It ruins your road. 
Do you know the cranberry people? 
Yeah, Haines, DeMarco. 
They have a lot of posted ground. 
In fact, two years ago I think we had paid for a particular area 
that was supposed to be patrolled by DeMarco, and we paid 
a 
particular amount of money, but a it was a big piece of 
woods, 
and we didn't even get a smell. 
In fact, another guy got the 
deer offa our drive. 
(note implied concept, similar to that in 
foxhunting, of earning and owning the quarry). 
Adam:(065) Anybody hunts by themself is a pothunter. 
So, 
what happens (to me, shut that off, but he isn't serious, so I 
leave 
it on), 
if you ain't doin' nothin' tonight, me and you can 
be pothunters. 
And I'll show you all 
about everything around 
here. 
They ask me about my Virginia license. 
"You have more deer 
in Virginia than we have here. Someone else says: 
We were 
huntin' deer in Delaware last week. 
Next week there's nine of u 
goin' 
to hunt in Pennsy, next week there's five of them goin to 
hunt in Maryland for a week, deerhunting 
Different states have 
different seasons. 
Me: I was wondering how you got so experienced on one week a 
year. 
We'll hunt deer in three different states this year. There's 
seven of them that do this together, but New Jersey's the state 
where they have a cabin. 
The younger guys who bowhunt go 
together. 
Some teasing back and forth about those who retire 
being able to just pack up and go, while the younger guys have to 
save up their vacations. 
Adam: 
This is the worst kind of huntin' 
in the world as far 
as I'm concerned. 
this scrub oak, 
it'll kill a mule. 
Another: 
If you can kill a deer in Jersey, you can kill one anywhere. 
You 
have to crawl through this scrub oak near route 72, and then 
if 
you see a deer there's no way you can get in a position to shoot 
'im. 
It's hard to tell whether it's a deer or a buck. 
It's 
easier to hunt in the other states. 
"We had a deer drive last Monday, and 
it was about 5/10 mile 
and 
it took us an hour and twenty minutes to make that drive. 
I 
come out of there, I was bleedin'. 
(that was a long time, and 
it 
happened in the pines). 
In the other states you rent a room with 
board someplace. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 160 
109, Adam: 
the deer here, when you shoot at 'em and miss 
'em they holler "Ha! Ha! You missed me!" 
In Delaware they slept 
in a 300 year old house. 
Batsto, that's a historic place. 
Carranza memorial. 
"I 
found a grave one time, by Apple Pie Hill. 
And these are all 
original names, they stuck with the places in the woods. " "I 
found a grave one year, over in Penn State (Forest), and I don't 
believe anybody knew where that grave was. 
It was one of the 
founders of one of them towns. 
In fact, when I come through the 
woods with the drive, 
it was funny, 
it was real dark 
in there, 
and the sun come through in one spot. 
You know where that sun 
came through, almost like a floodlight right on that gravestone. 
And I walked over there, and, 
I'm trying to think who 
it was, 
it 
was the husband and wife of one of them founders of that town, 
way out in the middle of nowhere...I don't even know what town it 
was 
in, 
it was 
in Penn State Forest. 
Their name is 
in the 
Forgotten Towns of New Jersey book. 
I can't think of the name. 
I should but I can't. 
We reported it to the authorities, the 
historical I think is where we sent it. " gravemarker. cemetery 
Someone else: (this turns into a good session) 
Did you read 
the year or months that they passed away? 
The guy who found it: 
Yeah I had all that information, 
in 
fact I still got that piece of paper, but it's home. 
We got 
taught about that not too long ago. 
Second speaker: Cause that's really something. 
The guy: It was. It was the mother and father of some people 
that were in that particular town, and it's so far out of 
line 
where anybody else 
is. 
Do you know how to tell 
an old settlement 
around the Pines? 
Well, 
if you see an oak tree somewhere, they 
had to be planted, they're foreign to here, aren't they? 
Any 
tree that's not a pine had to be planted. 
They're not native to 
here. 
Sometime, somebody hadda be here to plant those seeds. 
So 
keep that in mind 
if you're drivin' around. 
147 
Some people own this little tavern there, and they have 
rooms upstairs for hunters, and they own a lot of farmland around 
there. 
And they have their own little cemetery around the house. 
In fact, the woman died this year and she's buried 
in that 
cemetery. 
It's a nice green grassy plot, about a hundred yards 
from the house. 
And a mountain stream runs along the other side, 
and all 
her parents and grandparents and great grandparents are 
all 
buried there, there's about 10 or 12 graves there now. 
The guy: You know, right over there 
in Speedwell, you know, 
when I was tellin' you about charcoal? 
There's an old grave 
around the corner there, about thirty tombstones, them dates go 
back to 1600. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 161 
It's not really well cared for. 
The guy. 
They fascinate me, the old cemeteries. 
The second guy. 
It's a matter of looking it up 
in the 
archives. 
Where's that place that Peanuts and them used to drive 
around and see, where they got all these deer and you can go 
feed 'em. 
Alberts? 
(this in response to my announcement that I 
couldn't go spotlighting this evening because I was going to go 
to Albert Hall) 
That's fantastic. 
Kids would go there to feed 
the deer. 
It's all 
posted. 
Adam: I've been hunting 30 years 
in this area, and I never 
got lost, but there was one spot that I wasn't quite sure whether 
I was lost or not, and I didn't quite know what to do, so I 
picked this stone up, and I threw it way up 
in the air, 
and 
it 
didn't 
come down, so I figured I was lost then. 
They go out an hour before daybreak. 
they have home movies 
on 8mm film. 
of the deer at food patches, and of each other. 
When they smell you, then their tails go up. 
I've seen a hundred 
at one food patch. 
Some of 
'em'II 
run right straight down the 
road. 
Sometimes they've been so close they've flung mud up at 
the windshield. 
And I've got movies of 
it from the inside the 
car. 
I said I'd noticed the movie screen in the other room, and 
their laughter leads me to wonder whether home movies are not the 
only things being shown. 
A description of a skit, at my request. 
Adam: The time Gink was on there and young Tommy Sack was 
there, and they were operating on the guy and they were all 
dressed up 
like doctors and a patient, this'll really make you 
roar, I brought a colored guy down here for a cook, he used to 
work in a restaurant, and he come down here, and they had these 
pictures prior to that, , one of the helpers, he just had an 
undershirt on, and they got one of the guys to take his shirt and 
turn it around like a preacher or minister, and he had a book in 
his hand, and he went out the back, and he had a bottle of 
ketchup and they took the gun and they shot him, and he had the 
bottle of ketchup and he's layin' 
in the snow like he's dead, so 
finally maybe a year or so we were showin the movie here and I 
brought this colored guy down, and they were showin these movies, 
and we told 'im, we got this burial ground out there, we kill all 
the cooks. 
He didn't know what to think. Finally he see this 
picture come one here, and ist showed the brining the guy and he 
was blindfolded and 
it 
looked like they shot 'im. 
He come 
in, 
picked his suitcase up , and we had to convince him it wasn't for 
real. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 162 
278: We brought him back, he was alright. 
The policeman: We had two guys 
in here that wanted to go to 
Atlantic City and watch the go—go girls, and they would do 
it 
every other night or somethin' 
like that. 
Well, when it come 
time for the banquet, they called them up, set 'em 
in two chairs, 
put the lights down, the doors opened, and out come both their 
wives, dressed as go—go girls. 
(laughter) 
Anything unusual that happens in the woods will come out at 
our banquet. 
They got red in the face you know. 
If we know 
something has happened we pass it on to the banquet committee. 
Adam: another anecdote about the cook. 
We had another guy 
come here from the CC camps, he cooked bean soup and burned it 
and everybody got indigestion trying to eat it. 
Another guy 
played cards all night, and smoke was all over the place. 
So he 
took the grill and threw it out in the snow. It bounced ten feet 
because it was red hot. 
He brought it back in an made pancakes, 
you could use them for seats. 
Twenty years ago they had two women there who took too much 
of the food home with them. 
They show me the fire place. 
They sit around here and tell 
deer stories. 
How big they were, how many they killed, and when.

TXO1: This was a recording session set up by Merce who wanted to 
produce sample cassettes of his music to send around. 
It was 
divided into three sections. 
The first two sections I missed, 
but have been supplied to us on cassettes. 
They comprise old— 
time songs Merce associates with the area, complete with his 
version of the region's musical history, and a group of songs 
composed by his father. 
The third section features performances 
of songs composed by members of the group, but mostly by Merce. 
The group consists of Merce, emcee, 
lead singer and guitarist; 
Arlene, his wife, who sings and plays the mandolin; Glenn Borden 
who plays the fiddle and the mandolin; Lenore Franzen on fiddle 
and mandolin; 
Joe Horner on Doghouse bass; Russ Horner on guitar 
and banjo; and Arlene's son by a previous marriage (?) Gille, on 
guitar. All songs written by Merce unless otherwise stated. 
1. 
Ocean County Breakdown, on the banjo, by Russ Horner (who 
also composed it, with reference to Pike County Breakdown) 
2. Folks, I Sure Do Love My Jersey Home, by Merce Ridgway, 
Jr. 
(It was originally titled "Folks, I Sure Do Miss My Jersey 
Home", but some people objected that it was too bitter that way, 
since it's protesting changes brought by industry and 
development.)

Introduction to Piece of Cake. When he was 18 he joined the

The mass is chanted in a mixture of Old 
Church Slavonic, Russian, and English. The mikes were set up 
in 
the back of the church, tip—to—tip on one stand, facing the back 
of the congregation. 
The church itself 
is tiny -- perhaps 
between 30 and 40 feet from the door to the altar. 
Everyone was 
standing throughout the service, and the choir was 
in the loft 
overhead. 
The mass is 
in Russian, the beginning of the divine liturgy. 
The priest has a beautiful baritone voice. The bells of the 
church can be heard, and so can the coughing and the passing 
traffic in the street. 
This needs to be listened to by someone 
who knows the language.

Russian Orthodox Mass, continuing. 
The sermon begins 
midway. 
The subject is angels. 
He starts in Russian, then, 
moving into English: "The Orthodox tradition includes belief in 
personal beings called angels. 
This belief 
is rooted in sacred 
scriptures both 
in the Old Testament and the New Testament. 
There are at least three hundred passages referring to angels. 
The holy day of Saint Michael the archangel and the angelic hosts 
was established in the fourth century and bears the term 
synopsis, because St. Michael 
is not honored alone but together 
with all 
the angels. 
The bible tells us that the great angels, 
archangels, 
serve as God's messengers. And so 
it was that the 
message concerning our salvation was brought by Gabriel to the 
Blessed Mother. 
The teaching concerning angels can be defined 
and found in every divine liturgy as well as 
in the special 
hymns, for this day, especially in (?) which present the angels 
as our guardians, where we, when we asked to be delivered from 
misfortune, we request them to 
implore God to grant us this (cars 
too loud). 
The name Michael means the one who is 
like God (cars 
too loud). ..God has appointed in heaven the orders of angels. 
The seraphims are considered the highest order of the angels. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 180 
The angels themselves are angels of 
love, the second to them are 
the cherubims, the angels of knowledge. 
In the Divine Liturgy we 
sing the cherubim hymn, and further on the same hymn we sing that 
we may receive the King of all who comes invisibly borne by the 
angelic hosts -- and just before the Lord's prayer we hear "for 
an angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and 
bodies let us ask of the Lord" 
-- and during the consecration of 
gifts the choir sings 'holy, holy, holy' -- the priest prays "And 
we thank thee for this liturgy which thou hast willed to accept 
at our hands all the thousands of angels and myriad of archangels 
attend thee -- the cherubim, the seraphim that are six—winged, 
many—eyed, and soar aloft on wings. 
The prayer which our parents 
taught us 
is said at that time, we add 
it to our daily prayers 
this month, pray that they may use their powers to help us better 
worship, and that you might someday share with them the glories 
of heaven. Amen." 
Service continues, with chanting in Old Church Slavonic, 
Russian, and some English.

supplies with Hazel and Leo Landy 
014 looking at cattails 
018 Immortel -- Hazel: "Immortel 
is from France -- it comes 
in yellow and pink and baby blue -- this is called Pearly 
Everlasting. " She's never heard of rabbit tobacco (a name I've 
heard for it). 
Someone called from North Carolina or Virginia 
asking about it, but she didn't know at the time what it was. "I 
couldn't find it 
in any of my florist or botany books because I 
didn't know what I was looking for -- but the immortel -- the 
Pearly Everlasting -- they used to call 
it old field balsam --
and my grandmother told me that that was the only funeral flower 
that they had -- they didn't have fresh flowers in winter in 
those days -- they'd use that or a piece of wheat -- I guess 
they'd dry 
it without knowing what they were doing." 
036 Hufford giving Teitler instructions. 
More discussion 
regarding the properties of rabbit tobacco (for smelling and 
smoking) and where to gather it. 
Leo: "It's a funny thing-- one year it took over a field 
down the street -- I pulled two truckloads out of 
it -- the next 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel

year it was gone -- It had come in to some other field. 
One year 
it come out here and 
it come in beautiful." 
Hufford: Can you grow it from seeds? Leo doesn't know. 
Hufford: How about cat's paw? 
Leo: It grows down 
in the 
swamps. 
Doesn't know the botanical name, only the common one. 
It grows where the floral butts (aka hatpin) grows. 
They have 
strawflowers (gomphrena) and a second kind of pearly everlasting 
from G—Lanoka Harbor; 49GT "more like a double than what that is" 
Hufford: does the condition it's 
in when you pick it have 
anything to do with how it looks when dried? 
Hazel talks about 
how some were picked a week late: I said 'Oh Leo, we're a week 
late, because it was too far out -- like this little fella here 
-- nice and double like. 
Leo: Gotta have a little black eye on 
it. 
Hazel: Here's the statice (sea lavender) 
Hufford: When can you pick immortel? 
Leo: When you get it 
at the right time 
it doesn't shake any of that fuzz off. 
Grapevine baskets are made of Chicken grapes and fox grapes. 
Leo: They are different: The chicken grape is about the size of a 
pea, and the fox grape 
is 
in between the cultivated grape and the 
chicken grape -- it's about the size of a marble -- it's very 
good eatin' too -- for jelly too. foodways 
088: 
His mother and Hazel's mother both made chicken grape 
jelly her brother and uncle collected them. 
Italian broccoli, aka spring broccoli, aka rab. 
Looks like 
wheat -- radishes and turnips would have the same kind of seed 
pod. 
Wild mustard is finer. 
There's a long—needled and a short— 
needled mustard. 
It grows wild around there too. 
In spring it's 
a real green plant with all these yellow flowers on it, 
and we 
think, well, we'll go back in so many weeks, and there's where 
our mustard patch it. 
Leo: You're liable to see the male growin' out in these 
fields in this warm weather on the order of a turnip -- a turnip 
will stay flat and green all winter -- and then where the heat 
hits 'em 
in the spring, they shoot up. 
Hufford: noticing how the cat blends in with the Indian 
grass. 
Leo: That's fluffy Indian grass. 
Then there's brown 
Indian Grass. (Same species, different phases) Hufford: Fluffy? 
Hazel: That is, 
green -- you put it 
in a plastic house and 
it 
fluffs out -- and then 
in the winter time, 
like right now, we 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 184 
could go out and get the brown Indian which doesn't have anything 
fluffy on 
it. 
Hazel does some dying. 
They've also been assembling 
baskets, some with silks, some all natural. 
Heather. 
Hazel: This is green, then after the frost hits 
it, I said, 
'Oh the Lord can give its color -- that's what we 
call our heather. 
some people picture it just as purple. 
It 
grows around the G—Berlin, 29,30GT area in open fields. 
It's 
perennial. 
Leo: If they break 
it right the plant stays 
in the 
ground right now -- it's all 
real flat and green and 
it will 
produce again next year -- but, Pineys -- you give 'em an order 
and they go out and pull 
'em up roots and all, so they ruin the 
field. 
The seasons: 
some things you can pick 
in winter, some 
things -- ie. Yarrow and tansy can't be dried in the sun. "Our 
Joe Pye has to be 
in the dark -- absolutely in the dark." 
General confusion and picture—taking. 
They have no purple yarrow. 
Hazel saw the pink yarrow in a 
magazine and a friend offered to spray 
it for her. 
"I said, 
'Well, Erika, 
if I sprayed pink on 
it, 
that's going to make 
it 
orange. 
I wanted it pink -- but I never got up to fool around 
with it." 
Penny Cress -- that's been bleached -- it's Kelly green when 
it's fresh, and then it's a beige color -- it's like a miniature 
money plant -- it rattles. 
165 Hufford: What's this? 
Hazel: we call 
it brown burrs, 
but some people it rabbit's foot -- like Jack Richardson. 
It 
looks like little pads on his feet or somethin'. 
Leo: Must have a damn long foot for some of 
'em I've 
collected. 
It grows along roadsides. 
Regular Brown Indian Grass 
(collected during the winter "gettin' up 
into the spring, whereas 
fluffy is collected in the spring gettin' on 
into the summer." 
Hazel: Story re: "Kitchen Witch" (on broom with calico dress and 
sharp face) 
She's recommending Indian grass for the broom. 
They 
charge $4 or $5 at fairs for these. 
Hufford: Have you introduced any decorative plants into the 
florist industry? 
Hazel: Nobody advertises bunches of acorns the way we do --
and bayberry --wax used for bayberry candles, we gave the seed 
once to Batsto and 
it was used by the candlemaker. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 185 
Hazel 
is puzzled as to why Batsto doesn't feature sphagnum 
moss gathering and processing as a sort of craft demonstration. 
Teasel. 
Thistle was used for carding cotton before the cotton gin 
was invented. 
Yarrow was used at Batsto for dying. 
Other plants mentioned and photographed: Penny Cress; 
foxtail millet (pronounced millay); cornets (the tops of "sweet 
corn", not "horse corn"); turkey beards, also called Bear grass 
in Montana -- the deer like 
it -- we can't collect 'em because 
the deer eat 'em after they go to seed. 
237: Wheat and wild wheat. 
Wheat is used for corn dollies. 
Bearded wheat has more whiskers. 
Sand Dune grass -- that holds 
the dune in place. Leo: "I used to pull those grasses and take 
'em into La Guardia field -- 
The plume of sand dune grass is 
what's used. 
How much do his customers order? Leo: One guy sends a truck 
in. 
When he gets finished loading you can't even put anything in 
the passenger seat. 
Hazel: A hundred of this or that. 
Shops here and there 
order small quantities. 
Lotus pods. They attempted to plant them. Hazel: "We took 
all 
these little seeds one time and Leo drilled a hole 
in them 
with an electric drill, and then we took 'em up Route 206 in 
different places and threw 'em out in the streams. 
But we never 
saw any, cause Leo thought maybe they couldn't sprout because 
they were so hard. 
Leo: That's the only way I thought they could germinate --
they will take, but 
(he hasn't successfully introduced anything. 
All 
of it's native.) 
The Joe Pye grows well 
in farms in 
low 
ground. 
He wonders whether it 
isn't also called Iron weed. 
Do people make pea shooters with them? 
Leo: Why not with the Reed Plume? 
371 Leo: A farmer had a mess of okra without the spines and he 
was going to give 'em to me. I said they were no good without the 
spines. 
Lotus pods and pine cones wouldn't go well 
in bouquets. 
Hazel makes a bouquet for each of us. 
The pine cone popping shed. 
It holds about 5,000 pine cones 
at a shot. 
He fires it up 
in the fall -- mostly in October and 
November when wholesalers start pushing the cones for Christmas. 
The shed has been on fire a few times.

TX01: G—Nesco; 26GT Leo explains the process of using the pine cone 
popping shed. The seed comes out onto a table. 
Hazel offers an anecdote about Leo's absentmindedness. 
Leo: Every Piney I know that's had an oven, he's burned it 
down. 
He's touring us through the "green house" drying shed. 
057 
Numbers of people working for Leo. 
He has three just 
working on heather. 
"And it's enjoyable out there. 
They'd 
rather do that than work on carpentry. 
I was up on Route 73 when 
I run into this (mustard grass) and stopped in and asked them if 
I could pull 
it and they said 'go to work'. 
Hufford: Are you ever surprised by what you find? 
He was when he saw the Blackberry Lilly -- stopped to get it 
for Hazel, who describes on the tape with great enthusiasm: "The 
pod 
is shaped just like a blackberry." She keeps a little herb 
garden, 
including pineapple sage, blackberry lily, croves (?) 
rabinia hespidata. 
People are sometimes secretive about where 
they get their stuff. 
They work by the pound and by piecework. 
Leo: We don't tell on them. gathering 
092 
Hazel: I have a god—child that's a nun and I just gave her 
immortel and dried flowers. 
She's making up ten or twelve 
baskets. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 188 
She doesn't know of anything she'd call wormwood. 
Knows 
about using orris root for sachets from her reading. 
They get 
calls for hornets' nests and birds nests -- they have to climb 
trees to get them. 
Tiny grapevine wreaths are sold directly off 
of the Christmas tree in the Cornucopia, a little gift shop 
modelled after one at Cape Cod. 
Hazel goes to get the phone. 
14© 
Leo talking about gathering cattails -- starting in 
June. 
You gotta get 'em just when they're right -- like 
strawberries or tomatoes. 
He also has bundles of birch -- he 
used to make little dogwood trees with silk blossoms. 
"You know 
if you wanted to make a tree, 
it wouldn't be cheap." 
187 
Milkweed pods that are taken near a farm where spraying 
occurs are perfect inside -- white and shiny -- otherwise they 
are apt to be all 
black and full of bugs. 
They dispose of the 
fluff. 
Hazel: We have a friend who had her trees sprayed for 
gypsy moths. 
These (milkweed pods) were from around there." 
Discussion as Teitler and Hufford prepare to 
leave. 
They have sweet gum balls, best gathered in the fall or 
in 
the winter. 
There are different kinds of pine cones: white; hard 
(rigida) -- those are the poppers; Norway spruce; red spruce (New 
England); Douglas fir; White spruce (for corsages); 
Hard cones 
stay closed for years until heated intensely, then the seeds come 
out and they'll germinate. 
Loblolly was introduced by the CC 
Boys in Bass River State Forest. 
Landy was with the mosquito 
control for the CCC. 
Some stories about bad mosquitoes. 
268 
Leo: "These little flies don't bother me, but them 
greenheads -- they'll make you back up." 
Hufford: Have you ever gotten lost in the woods around here? 
Leo: You're only gettin' 
lost until you're halfway in, then 
you're comin' out! 
Hazel: He went to Williamstown and he got lost. 
Don't let 
him kid you. 
Leo: I'll 
tell you where you can get lost. 
Go up the plains 
pickin' pine cones. 
It looks like a big green lawn and after you 
get in 
'em pickin' pine cones, you can't see roads 'er 
anything...I pick a place where I can see the towers from the 
bombin' range. 
Hufford: Do different parts of the Plains have names? 
Leo: I wouldn't doubt it -- they burned a big section this 
year. 
Hufford--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 189 
Hazel: re: one family that left a sign on their door "Gone 
for Pine Cones at Petticoat Hill" (that was Joe and Carey Mick 
they took their wheelbarrow) 
Other places: Sim Place, Apple Pie Hill. 
Leo can't remember 
the names of roads. 
Leo: Mannheim Avenue, before I ever heard it was Mannheim 
Avenue, we called 
it Hoptoad road. 
You'd go down there after a 
rainstorm and all these little (toads) you couldn't run down 
there in a car without goin' over them. 
Just like bugs! 
Another one was the road from Weekstown to Port Republic --
the one that goes through Clark's Landing Road -- We called that 
"Chipmunk" -- they looked like pegs standin' up along the road. 
Oodles of 
'em -- every morning we'd get up to go out and cut 
cattails -- they'd be out there thicker 'n Hell. 
Saw a weasel family day "after cattailin'": An old lady 
weasel with the little ones hangin onto her (like a possum?) Yeah 
-- we got out and started grabbin' weasels and then we looked at 
each other and said "What are we gonna do with 'em? 
So we 
left 
the whole gang loose. 
We thought they were minks or somethin'. 
We go to make bouquets. 
They don't call anything Jewelweed 
or Touch—me—nots. Leo used to make whistles out of other things.
