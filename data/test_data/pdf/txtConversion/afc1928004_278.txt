'FANCY LITTLE STEP! 
As sung by the IlicHmoND SISTERS. 
Oh! I've come liere to tell about 
A 
little lover fair, 
That occurred to me al I 
walked out 
To take the evening air ; 
And ou a 
girl I 
chanced to throw 
Such a 
charm, I 
can't forget, 
My admiration was bestowed 
On her fancy little step. 
CHORUS. 
For so easy and so gaily she did glide, 
r 
reuk • 
For that little fairy I 
would have died ; 
iBroak. 
For her head was bending low, 
As she gracefully on did go, 
With a 
silver pair of tassells 
On her high-heel6d boots, 
And her fancy little step. 
[Dance 
But she has gone, and uovr I 
grieve, 
I 
really think its moan; 
And after this I 
will believe 
That love is but a 
dream; 
And when many years have gone, 
I 
never shall forget

The girl that had the pleasant smile, 
An the fancy little, 
step! 
For so easy, &c.

As sung by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
I 
know a 
little Colleen, 
I 
dearly love her well, 
And often in the twilight, 
I 
meet her in the dell; 
She's fairer than the starlighb, 
I'm going to see her soon; 
She promised here to meet me, 
At the rising of the moon. 
CHORUS. 
For her voice it is soft and light, 
[Break. 
Her golden hair, in ringlets bright, 
[Break. 
And while I'm waiting for her 
I'll sing a 
merry tune; 
She promised here to meet me 
At the rising of thit moon. 
The ring is bought, the day is named, 
The knot will soon be tied, 
And ere another week is past, 
I'll make my love a 
bride ; 
We'll get old Dan the piper, 
his merry pipes to tune, 
And we'll dance away the evening, 
At the rising of the moon. 
For her voice, fr.4. 
As sung by the Iirciamoyn SISTERS. 
In life there's nothing sweeter 
Than to have, or be, a 
beau; 
It's nice to lova a 
pretty girl, 
And that we all well know ; 
Now I 
have found a 
sweetheart, 
A 
charming little Miss, 
And that is how I 
come to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
CHORUS. 
For she's my little fairy, 
So beautiful and airy, 
[1;reak. 
My heart is captivated 
By a 
charming little Miss,' 
And that is how I 
came to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
[Dance. 
Now when two lovers quarrel, 
They sit and pout awhile, 
Until one or the other will 
Provoke a 
-winning smile; 
'1 he making up's delightful, 
'1 is full of joy and bliss, 
He clasps her in his arms. and then-
There's magic in a

rritten expressly for the raCIIMOND Stsxxits, by J. A. GuLum. 
While walking out one summer's eve, 
Just as the twilight fell, 
I 
chanced to turn my steps toward 
A 
lovely woodland dell. 
While walking then among the flowers— 
The prospect seemed so fair— 
For lying in the path I 
saw 
t. tress of Golden Hair. 
CHORnS. 
Then I 
pressed the treasure to my lips, 
And vowed I 
would be true 
To her who owned that cherished Exize, 
That tress of golden hue. 
Pans.. 
Next morning in the Times, I 
saw 
A 
notice underscorad, 
Having lost a 
tress of golden hair. 
And offering a 
reward. 
I 
called on her at her address, 
And saw an angel fair! 
Oh! how I 
bless the day I 
found 
That tress of golden hair! 
Then I 
prested, 
As sung by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
Good evening, to you, one and all, 
We've a 
secret for your ear, 
Its about a 
young and pretty girl 
That we love very dear; 
She's as handsome as a 
sunbeam, 
Our bright-eyed little Belle ; 
"She don't know which of us to wed, 
She loves us both so well. 
Caoans. 
And still with little Belle, 
We wander through the dell, 
For we don't intend to marry, 
While she loves us both so well, 
[Dance. 
Last night we went to see her, 
'Twas about the hour of nine ; 
Her head rpon my shoulder lay, 
Her hand I 
clasped in mine. 
I 
asked her which she loved the best, 
As we wandered through the dell, 
But her answer was, " I 
cannot say, 
" 
I 
love yon both so well." 
And stili with little Belle, &c. 
As sung by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
'Twas early in the afternoon 
When I 
arrived in town, 
And having nothing else to do 
I 
thought I'd look around; 
I 
met with some I'd seen before, 
But one—a 
Rosa Lee— 
Made my acquaintance then and there, 
For she said she had sent a 
telegram to rue! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! that cunning, bewitching Rosa Lee, 
[Break. 
Didn't she come it, come it sweet on me, 
[Creak. 
I 
thought she was in earnest, 
She looked so gay and free; 
And now I'd give all I 
possess, 
For the girl that sent the telegram to me. 
[Dance. 
Good lady, you are, in the wrong, 
Was my reply to her ; 
But tightly to my arm she clung, 
My preface did defer ; 
A 
crowd did gather on the spot, 
To see what they could see, 
While I 
was trying to escape 
From the girl who sent the telegram to me. 
Oh! that cunning, &c. 
A 
song, (4:c., by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
There is a 
fair one living near, 
Who bolds my heart in keeping ; 
Her vison's near me all the day, 
She haunts me while I'm sleeping; 
She does not seem to care for me, 
But why, I 
do not know, 
She's the only girl I 
ever loved, 
My pretty blue-eyed Joe ! 
CEtonus. 
My pretty blue-eyed Joe, 
She loves me, that I 
know, 
[Break. 
[Break. 
I 
won't live long, I 
know, 
Unless I 
get for life 
This darling, charming little° 
sprite, 
My pretty blue-eyed SCe. 
'My -r.ther likes mc very well, 
Her mother dotes upon me, 
Hei brother likes to have rn. 
call, 
But Josie always f-;•11uns me. 
I've often asked Ler, me to wed, 
She always answered Lc ! 
She'll set mo crazy, this I

HARDING, 229 Bowery, N.Y. 
My love is young, and fair, and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
Whenever she goes out alone, 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm you know I 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft _I 
tell her so, 
But tho' she don't decline, 
She won't say yes or no. 
CHORUS. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Papa, George. 
Tra-la-li, George. Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Pa-pa, ha, ha, pa. 
One day she'll smile, the next she'll frown, 
She is a 
creature strange, 
But there is no one in this town, 
For whom I 
would exchange; 
She's like the rest of woman kind, 
A 
riddle hard to read,— 
I'd like to know just what she means, 
' 
lwould please me much indeed 
I 
want her to be mine, 
To me she is most dear, 
But, tho' she don't decline, 
Her answer pains my ear. 
Tra-la-li, George, &c. 
Her father's a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of wordly pelf,— 
He says his charming daughter 
Is a 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
Her hand and heart, we have to part, 
For he cooly kicks me out! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She says it is a 
shame, 
What will we do ?—I 
say— 
Her answer is the same. 
CnoEts. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Papa, George. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra.-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Papa, Ha, ha, pa.

The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut boughs, 
'I he youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchanr,e

I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see the mossy, 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee, 
The girlish voices that I hear, 
Renew sweet youth in me ; 
I hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to schcol.

The roses and lilies now bloom in the dell, 
They smile in their beauty for Kathleen Machree ; 
She trips to the glen that we both know so well, 
While I 
am so anxious her sweet face to see. 
0, could you but list to the sound of her voice, 
It fills me with joy, ' tis music to me ; 
When I 
ask if she loves me, her answer will be--
A 
kiss from the lips of sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Cnouus. 
Kathleen Machree, sweet Kathleen Machree, 
No rose in the dell can compare love with thee ; 
Kathleen Machree' sweet Kathleen Machree, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree, 
Some maidens are sweeter and fairer to view, 
But none can compare with sweet Kathleen Machree, 
She wins with her smiles and her heart free from guile, 
While close by her side I 
am longing to be. 
0, she will be waiting to-night in the glen, 
With worth t4at are fond and sweetest to me ; 
She's the dearest 
me and the fairest of all, 
My own little aftri-ing, sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Kathleen Machree, &c. 
Sung by Gorge flanifs. 
MY advice, if it yon seek, 
Is but sinL in its way, 
Ere you ope your mouth to speak, 
Think of what you're going to say; 
Hurried words will oft cause pain, 
Where you would not wound at all, 
Then repentance comes in vain, 
For the speech you can't recall. 
Gnor.c.
s. 
Always think before you speak, 
Words aro strong when judgment's weak, 
If you friendship's hand -would see, 
Think before you speak, boys. 
When a 
maiden's hand is sought, 
And she's asked if she will wed, 
Oft without a 
second thought, 
Is the answer quickly said; 
De it yea, or be it nly, 
Ere a 
year or two have pass, 
Often does she rue the day.. dg" 
That her tongue ran on so fast. 
Always think, Sco. 
From a 
rash and hasty speech, 
Quarrels often will arise, 
Weigh your words, then, I 
beseech, 
If a 
quiet life you prize ; 
Then when you those words recall, 
And you've put them to the test,' 
You will own that after all, 
Second thoughts are always best. 
Always think. 1.t0 
Thoughtless men will talk until, 
They forget what they have said, 
Do you know, the tongue that's still? 
Often shows the wisest head ; 
Time and words they only waste, 
With their tongue's unceasing flow, 
Those who always speak in haste, 
Very seldom wisdom show. 
Always think, Sm.

have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the sump- ..7:n;1-S;11:1C, W0111. -1

With hair awl eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd trem'ile with deli-ht.

Her sweet fa, ' gushing 
Oh ! you should .7,eo my pretty little Jessie, 
IIer beauty shames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancin:, 
Oh! may the joy of life forever bless thee, 
Lovely queen of every rose, 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop in the rose-bud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes; . 
Oh ! who would dare to crush her 
A 
sw_et and tender flower,

And who Nvould dare to hush her, 
While singing in her bower, 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song. 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd it there all day long. 
My heart, &c. 
I 
sometimes think that I 
am going crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white-cap daisy, 
Its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is their:friend. 
This evening her and I 
were in the garden— 
When I 
my suite did press; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She blushingly answered, yes.

MY features they arc quite familiar,

On Broadway I 
am the rage, 
I

Every day, when it is sunny, 
On the corners I 
am seen ;

While on my little cane I 
lean !

So, to make myself useful.

Sometimes, with a

You see me cutting up a

When you wander to and fro ; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
I.am coming, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are ; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mem'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I

I 
am coming where you wander, 
'Neath the shadows down the lane; 
And I 
dreamed of days o'er yonder, 
When in joy we meet again ; 
Future years will keep no sadness, 
In their store for you and me ; 
All the days shall smile with gladness, 
When our hearts united be.

i 
AM over head and ears in love, 
The truth I 
tell, with a 
turtle dove; 
She ought to he in the skies above, 
An angel she should be. 
Her laughing eyes, with a 
dimpled chin, 
Her face so white and fair: 
Her look so neat and so complete, 
With a 
mass of silk like hair—oh! 
Cnout:s. 
irettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum. 
This lucious little sugar plum 
Was introduced to the one you see. 
At a 
masked ball, where I 
had such fun,, 
Everyone was in full glee; 
Thisjoyous niirlit my heart felt light. 
With gleams of future bliss— 
When parting at the dawn of day, 
J 
was rapt in happiness—oh I 
Prettily she dance-s, 
THERE is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen; 
!.ly heart beats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed in green; 
'lei- eyes are ? night as evening stars, 
So loving aild so shy; 
And the folks al i 
stop and look around, 
Whenever she goes by. 
Ciumus. 
And I 
feel just us happy as a 
big stunlow‘-tr, 
`chat nods and bends In the breezi 
And my heart is as '. i

The leava frffill olr the trees—zet' 
As ( lays past on, and we became 
Like friends of olden tinves, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And ask her to he aline; 
But the ans ,.ver I 
received next day— 
now Offilit she treat me, so 
Instead of being : nine for life, 
She sanp.y answered, 11 0. 
And I 
feel just as happy, 
I 
went next day, dressed in niy be.st, 
This young ,_
dri for to . e.e; 
To ask her if she would explain 
Why she had shaken me; 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said. " Wont you be mine?" 
, 
Of course she answered " yes." 
And I

We're unfortunate men as you can see, 
Depending on your charity; 
We live on the street, we live in jail, 
The bread we ate is always stale— 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
Unable to work, not willing to die, 
Watching the rich walk proudly by, 
We wouldn't steal the weight of a 
pin— 
Have pity on these beggar min— 
Pity the beggars, oh !

The blind, the lame, the sick, the sore, 
Getting our bread from door to*door, 
Exposed to the rain, to the snow, the wind— 
Pity these beggar men! 
'When the leaves are falling from the trees, 
We shiver wid the lightest breeze ; 
The Christmas gift that we receive 
Is the God-forsaken pauper's grave; 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
But when bright summer comes around, 
On every corner they were found ; 
Policemen then they do begin, 
To drive away these beggar min— 
Pity the beggars, oh do!

We've plenty faith, we live on hope— 
We never saw the sight of soap ; 
At night we softly lay our bones 
Upon a

After enjoying a

walked out one morning, 
The sun was shining bright, 
And for a 
time I 
felt my eyes 
Were dazzled by its light. 
When just as I 
was going 
To step across the street, 
met a 
charming creature, 
The sweetest of the sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh her eyes were bright, 
Her step was light, 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet; 
I 
know right well that little belle. 
Is the sweetest of the sweet. 
I 
said, Oh charming creature, 
Will you accept my arm; 
I'll see you safe across the street, 
She looked up in alarm: 
Young man, she said, and then she smiled, 
Oh, lor, ' twas such a

Ere many weeks had passed away,

And now she is my only joy,

The busy crowded street, 
I 
feel my wife most surely is 
The sweetest of the sweet.

The Lads in the village, by chance seeing me, 
Whisp'ring will speak of you;

And the girls they were asking but last market day 
" 
Would my bonnet be white or blue." 
So never by brook or in meadow I'll stray, 
Robin again with you, 
Robin never again with you. 
There's never a 
night but across the dark lake, 
Jamie comes here, to woo, 
With vow, he would " die•any day for my sake," 
And I'm sure that he loves me true, 
I'm sure that he loves me true; 
So now if there's nothing you're waiting to say,

Don't you think we had best say: "adieu." 
Then never by brook or in meadow I'll stray, 
Robin again with you, 
Robin never again with you!

There was grizzly bears from mountain tops, 
Buffalos from prairies, 
Kangaroos and crocodiles, 
And lots of Irish fairies. 
They had a

About a 
lot of hash, 
Onion skins and cabbage stalk, 
Broke out with scarlet rash.

The elephant sat on his trunk 
Winking at the foxes,

And eat up the hyena.

I 
HAVE sung about the yaller gal, 
And she's lovely as a 
rose, 
But now I'll sing a

Indeed, you can't suppose. 
Her form is like Adonis fair. 
And her cheeks blush like the flowers, 
But the only girl that holds my heart 
Is little Fannie Powers.

It was early in the Fall I 
met her at a

And she wore a 
wreath of coral flowers, 
As by her side I 
s.it my heart went pit- a-pat, 
As I 
gazed on my little Fannie Powers. 
I 
asked her then to dance with me, 
If she felt so inclined, 
She gave a 
smile nod a 
look 
And answered, I 
don't mind, 
We danced the polka o'er and o'er, 
And passed the merry hours, 
I 
found that night my heart had flown, 
To little Fannie Powers. 
It was early, rko. 
I 
could not work, I 
could not sleep, 
For my heart was full of strife, 
I 
went to her and asked her plain, 
To become my darling wife. 
She hung her head and blushed so deep, 
And her answer—you may guess, 
She gave a 
sigh, and then a 
look, 
And faintly answered yes.

Calling Mamma all the day, 
Oh, it's swat to hear the darlings, 
hear the cunning woad they say. 
Pretty faces ever smiling, 
Smiling sweetly all the day, 
Oh, it is so nice to watch them— 
Watch our angel doves at play ; 
Prom the early morn ' till twilight, 
Cheerful as the merry birds, 
They are calling one another 
In the sweetest kind of words. 
Little voices, &c. 
Tiny feet that never weary 
Going up and down the stairs, 
Little minds that are not troubled 
With a 
score of worldly cares ; 
Home without them would 1.e dreary, 
MintUes lengthen into hours, 
If the garden of our,household 
Had not these delightful flow'rs.

at 585 Broadway, N. Y. 
THIS season now has opened bright, 
For us to cut the wing, 
So let us now embrace this chance, 
A 
song and dance we'll sing; 
We will sling ourselves clear out of sight, 
'Way off of this plantation, 
And show you tricks you never saw 
Before in all creation. 
Oh I'm so jolly, 
And I'm in for folly, 
For we both wear the laurels now, 
And with them we will never part, 
To sing and dance here every night, 
Is just the object of my heart. 
We feel like falling on our head; 
Our feet they seem so light, 
It's easy done if you know how, 
In it we take delight; 
For sensation now and novelty, 
Is all the rage and go, 
And if you'll notice us a 
while, 
Observe this fact we know. 
Ohl I'm so jolly, ete.

IN an ivy-covered cottage, 
hidden b..ck cf oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Just as happy as you please. 
Where, upon a 
low veranda, 
Every Summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the tlie.v'rs fair— 
Camilla by my side. 
Ciror.us. 
All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes, 
Lcvely, 1 
1uhin, -soul-bewitching, 
Sweet Camilia May. 
Captivating, re-gravating„ 
Never tired of play, 
Flitting 111.e a 
little birdie--
Happy all the day, 
Oh ! kill me or I'll die with love.-0 
For swea Camilla May. 
Oh! I 
met this merry maiden, 
Just a 
week ago to-day, 
111 among tha pretty ' lowers, 
Triming mi:nonettes sc gay. 
And I 
asked her for a 
single rose, 
And this I 
heard her say,— 
Take this sweet forget-ine-not, 
From Miss Camilla May. 
All among the Roses, .tc. 
Wilh a 
little white carnelia, 
Gleaming in her dusky hair, 
Lovely violets and roses, 
Blooming in her face so fair, 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eyes so bright and gay, 
There's a 
choir of angels singing— 
In the voice of Milly May. 
All among the Roses, 85c. 
Now I 
bid you to remember, 
If in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings, 
Don't act foolishly, like me. 
For I 
live on hoping, dreaming 
- 
Of a 
coming happy day, 
When I'll make of one camelia, 
Such a 
lovely sweet " bouquet." 
All among the Roses; 
Courting a 
Farmer's Daoghter, 
Entered according to- APt of Congresg in the year 1575, by A. 
risnErt, in the oflice of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Music by Wm. CE:rrn. 
I 
once did love a 
girl named Sal, 
Each lay I 
went to court her, 
She's a 
farmer's daughter on the hill, 
And I 
tell you she's a 
snorter ; 
Last Sunday noon, alone with her, 
My love with her revealing, 
The question I 
was going to pop, 
When the pigs set up a 
squealing. 
Cuonts. 
Yes, the pigs did squeal, and dance a 
reel 
And the old tom turkey gobbled ; 
And the shanghai crowd bis cockadoodleaoo, 
And the brindle cow was sneezing. 
I 
went again last Sunday night, 
And the pigs had stopped their squealing ; 
The old tom turkey, and the big shanghai, 
And the brindle cow, were sleeping; 
Will you be mine, dear Sal? says I, 
Before her I 
was kneeling ; 
But before she'd time to say yes, or no, 
The pigs again went squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, 
I 
called on Sal again, next day, 
To ask how she was feeling; 
I 
found her feeding the little pigs 
To make them stop their squealing; 
The plan is a 
good one, Sal, said I, 
As a 
kiss I 
was a 
stealing; 
The pigs stopp'd eating and looked at me, 
And again set up a 
squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, a:e. 
I 
felt disgusted, and left the spot, 
And resolved I'd never marry 
A 
farmer's daughter for a 
wife ; 
But a 
batchelor I 
would tarry. 
So let her pigs squecl if they choose— 
The truth I 
am revealing, 
Each night and day when I 
pass that way, 
The damned old pigs are squealing! 
Yes, the pigs did, &c.

BIRDIE DARLING, 
As sung by ALICE BENNErr, with great succc.s. 
Words by V. 3. ENGLE. 
Music by II. BeEtzwr. 
Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea ; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain ; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
Cuor.Es. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way ; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When he pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, &O. 
Let him think how once he falteed, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sigh; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sly, 
Birdie, birdie, 4103. 
SWEET DORA DARE, 
As sung by:Cool. BcttoEss. 
Music to be had of Wu. A. POND, 547 Broadway. 
TRIPPING down the valley, skipping o'er the lea, 
Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid could be ; 
Like a 
plume of raven is the bri2ht sli«n of lii r 
hair 
Happy as a 
little queen is my darlin: Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song birds, as they s 
v 
sing, 
Hear the voice of winsome Dora through i 
the valley ring, 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wild wood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hear. 
CITORCS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darlino• Dora Dare, 
Dora with the lillies of the valley in her hair, 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair, 
My heart it will go pit-a- pat at sight of Dora Dare. 
All the laddies are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet, 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the 
while, 
What has passed between us, Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again my Dora Dare will wear, 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her Lair. 
Sweet Dora Dare, Sze.

BY JOHN FIELDING. 
Last Easter Monday I 
went outs 
And took a 
trip to Troy, 
'1 was there I 
met this darling girl, 
Of whom to sing I'll try. 
'Twas on the steamer we first met, 
Next at Doolen's Calico Hop, 
When she told me her name, and then 
Described her father's shop. 
SPOKEN — She said her father sold— 
Soap, starch and candles, turnips, starch and turpentine,' 
Paper, glue and mustard, sweet oil and scents, 
Black lead and clothes lines, firewood and brandy wines, 
Colors mixed for painting, pots and brashes lent! 
We saw them play at kiss in the ring, 
We joined them in the scene ; 
She always threw the glove to me, 
To chase her round the green. 
And when I 
caught her, oh! what bliss, 
To span her slender waist ; 
But when I 
kissed her, then I 
thought 
'Twas Heaven such lips to taste ! 
SPoitY.N.—All but one thing, I 
thought I 
could detect a 
light flavor of— 
Soap, starch, ktc. 
When night closed in, I 
saw her home, 
It was not very far ; 
When we got there, she introduced 
Me to her Pa and Ma. 
I 
said I 
hoped they were quite well, 
And then I 
heaved a 
sigh ; 
And said, I 
hoped we should one day 
Be joined by a 
closer tie. 
SPOICEN . 
— And when I 
sighed, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
you can believe me, when I 
say I 
felt very queer—not being 
used to the odor of— 
Soap, starch, &c. 
But now I'm used to all the smells, 
For I 
spend most of my time 
Behind the counter, for I 
think, 
'Twill one day be mine. 
Last week the old folks gave consent, 
Now all my fears have fled; 
Next week will end my single life, 
I 
shall be a 
married man instead. 
SPOREN.—And not only a 
married man, but also a 
shop-
kesper, and I 
shall always keep the best of— 
Soap, starch, tte.

THE BIG WALL-FLOWEE. 
As Sung by BILLY COTTON. 
THERE was a 
sort of kind of grace 
About a 
girl I 
met; 
She wore a 
shawl of orange lace. 
IIer hair was in a 
net. 
I 
met her in a 
railway train. 
When going down to Kew; 
IfI don't see that girl again, 
Whate'er shall I 
do?-011! 
CIMIZUS. 
For, I 
felt just as happy as a 
big wall-flower, 
Or any plant you like to sho*w 
me: 
But ever since that day, I've fallen so away, 
That my shadow would never know me,. 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
She blushed a 
lovely:yellow; 
1 
go along! you are, said she, 
An impudent young fellow." 
I 
treated her to shrimps and tea, 
And paid without demur; 
And cruelly she treated me, 
When I 
had treated her—Oh ! 
For, I 
felt just, Ite. 
Oh! '
twas in an arbor quite a- part 
I 
went down on my knees 
And offered her my hand and heart, 
57 
And said: ' Oh! have me please." 
She let me stay my knees upon 
That cruelest of Belles— 
She knew that I 
was kneeling on 
Sharp periwinkle shells—Ohl 
For I 
felt just, &c, 
At last she said : " It cannot was, 
Oh, no I 
it must not be." 
I 
asked her why? she said: ‘` Because, 
I'm married, don't you see." 
I 
fled away, and since that day, 
I've grown so thin, I 
fear 
If I 
keep shrinking in this way, 
I 
soon shall disappear. _Oh! 
For I 
felt just, &o.

RUSSELL & CO., Boston, 
AS I 
was walking down the street, the other afternoon, 
Lit my cigar, put on my kids in front of a 
saloon. 
A 
vision floated past my sight, which caused the dust to fly, 
'Twas the prettiest girl I 
ever saw was the girl that took my eye. 
CHORUS, 
She is so fair, ( BREAK.) 
I 
do declare, ( BREAK.) 
I 
feel so queer whenever I'm near, 
That pretty little girl that took my eye. 
I 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame. 
She quickly waved her handkerchief, of course I 
did the same, 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side, your pardon, mLs, said I, 
If I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but thou you took my eye. 
She is so fair, &c. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, as we stood by the door, 
She said she had no objections, but her parents they were poor. 
But trifles like that I 
must never mind, to win her I 
must try, 
And if I 
do, I'll introduce to you, the girl that took my eye. 
She is so fair, &c.

To those who have never perused the sad story of 
LOTTE TEMPLE, Oyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-, 
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
ttmate Charlotte Temple: 
Tier form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah ! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. RONTS011, " 
affords a 
ttriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE: 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple-. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfcrtunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rair resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, co ,ting 
25 cents, ea lcd " The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-

nothing at all objec-

THE APPRENTICE, - 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists& Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elemental y 
work on practical inechani,.s, consists in the fol-
lowing simpie statement of facts: The e.litor of this journal, 
while tea.uing natural philosophy and chetnistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in fired of a 
text-
ho -t 
of practical in , amines, adapteu to the advanced classes 
who had been trained iii mathenialics ; in his search among 
the many mechanical t. xt-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his rcquirements as the above work. 
It was 
theref )re adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
an-a. 
wishes it in the hands of au l 
who are still in the fog about 
tl . units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
restaove to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
1The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has r.:aile some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
roost 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young ma t 
w th a 
fair know.e ge of 
arithmetic may, however, use Luis woik to great not:ming , ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a 
w. ik 
of reference. 
Most rimiations young men will niatie thi. in-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to itler 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from oth.'r 
which is not without value, and might b advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious work.:. 
The book is well
