SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by E. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DATE BRAHAM. 
Music published by Wm. A. POND, N. Y. 
I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem &It's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [ bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done. 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road ; [ last, 
Thro' sickness. toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mem'ry will turn roan, when our souls dey were 
tied down. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

GOODWIN. 
Music' by EDW'D E. 
RICE. 
When first the sound of battle came, 
We gaily marched away, 
For when we heard our country call, 
We could not but obey; 
For truth and right the first to fight 
And never known to flee, 
Our fathers recognize their sons, 
The gallant Ninth are we. 
CHORUS. 
A 
hundred years ago we stood in fight arrayed, boys, 
And boldly met the foe, for truth and liberty: 
Our voice is living still, and we should be obeyed, boys, 
Who gave our lives to make you free a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
little band of earnest men, 
Who knew no law but right; 
We just a 
century ago 
Set Freedom's torch alight, 
We fought and fell and ages tell 
The story which you know, 
Of how the sun of Glory rose 
A 
hundred years ago.

TENDER ON THE, LAMBS. 
Copyright secured, 1576, by A. J. FISHER. 
Written and Sung by HARRY W ESTERN, of WEST N 
W ALLING, Character Sketch Artists. 
Beecher is the 'greatest man 
That ever preached to text; 
It must be so, the Ladies all go, 
To hear what's coming next; 
He commences very mild, 
Then he rips, swears and dams! 
And has the cheek to tell us that, 
He's been tender on the lambs! 
CHORUS. 
Go hear Beecher, boys, 
Go hear Beecher, boys, 
Go hear Beecher, for, 
He's tender on the lambs! 
One certain Lady T. 
Who interested, went 
To hear this wonderful Beecher 
In his great argument ; 
She soon was satisfied--
She joined both heart and hand--
Said Beecher's food was very good 
To feed the tender lambs ! 
Go hear Beecher. Sze. 
Now, Beecher tried his nerve 
To preach of the promis'd land, 
But the sight of so much woman, 
He got cranky on the lamb! 
You'll find him now at home, 
Singing his new made Psalms; 
The ending of his verses are, 
I'm still tender on the lambs! 
Go hear fleecier, cITA

HILDERBRANT McGUFFIN. 
Written and sung by JOHN D. 
Gm7Frrt, the Popular Irish 
Comedian. 
Here I 
am, an Irishman, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
just came over from Ireland, 
From the county of Tralle. 
When I 
landed in Castle Garden, 
On America's soil to tread, 
I 
was met by a 
fair haired maiden, 
And this is what she said— 
CHORUS. 
Tra-lu la ! Tra-la le ! I'll meet you pet, 
I'll meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet ; 
I'll strike you with a 
Turkey-leg, I'll smother you with the 
stuffing; 
For the darling of the ladies is Hilderbrant McGuffin. 
Oh! when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My wife she made me a 
present 
Of a 
darling, bouncing boy; 
And when at night he'd holler for his Paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd sing—

COME AND JOIN THE BAND. 
REVIVAL SONG. 
Words and Music by J. P. SKELLY. As sung by JonItri 
ROACH, with great success. 
COME, come and be converted, 
Come from wickedness and sin.

Hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay, 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band.

Come, come, ey'ry Yankee 
Ev'ry sinner thro' the land, 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey,

Sinners bless the day they found as, 
See them creeping through the crowd.

Into evc.ry berast we steal, 
We are f',,r the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, &e.

Now we're back with glory crowned. 
We have gained the woild's devotion, 
Such a

From the aged and the wise, 
Severed from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, &c.

(I, ladies and gantlemen listen to me, 
Lnd whin you have heard me I'm sure you'll agree 
That I'm much abused. though I 
can't tell why, 
And to tell you my troubles I'm going to try. 
On the corner beyond there's a 
gang of young roughs. 
They insult decent people, and call themselves toughs 
And ivery day at me their slang they do toss, 
And they say I 
resimble the lost Charley Ross. 
They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out " Gilhooley, your collar is loose ;" 
At Mulligan's wake sure they filled me with snuff, 
And tould mc to go out and get meself stuffed. 
Sure, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a 
job, 
To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
But to understand thim I'm greatly at loss, 
Whin they say, " Pipe him off—there goes young 
Charlie Ross !" 
'Twas only last night, sure, they gave me a 
call, 
To deliver a 
lecture at Hibernia Hall 
I 
put on a 
bikd shirt and hastr:-.-_-,'d there quick, 
But the blackguards did serve me the divil's own trick, 
Whin I 
wint in they put a 
big bag on my head, 
And rolled me around 'till I 
thought I 
was dead; 
Then they threw me down stairs with a 
terrible toss, 
And tould the police they had found Charley Ross.

I'm Afraid to Knock at the Door. 
CHARACTER SONG. 
Written and Sung by ALICE Ross MURRAY. 
Once more I 
am back to my childhood's bright home, 
That I 
left her just ten years ago ; 
Oh! little I 
thought that I 
thus would roam, 
Back here in my rags, filled with woe ; 
I 
am tired and weary, and ready to fall, 
From my journey across the wild moor; 
I 
am cold and hungry, unable to call, 
And afraid to knock at the door. 
th10111:43. 
I'm afraid to knock at the door--
I'm afraid to knock at the door— 
To meet Father and Mother, 
Sister and Brother— 
I'm afraid to knock at the door. 
I 
will knock at the door, 
And if asked to come in, 
I'll take courage and try to be bold ; 
I 
never could stand this piercing wind, 
I'd perish out here in the cold; 
I 
dread to meet them, though I 
know they'll be glad 
To welcome the wanderer home; 
I 
know they'll forgive me, 
For I've made them feel sad, 
But never again will I 
roam. 
Tin afraid, Ste.

McGOWN 'S 
WEDDING. 
Written by John Fielding. 
As sung by THOMAS & HEExEr, at Newton's Variety, 
Hartford, Colin. 
IT was on the fourth of last July, 
This is the truth and not a 
lie, 
That Dan McGown and Mary Malone 
In wedlock were united. 
And as they had some cash on hand, 
Says Dan our wedding will be grand, 
More power to you says Mary Ann, 
Now who shall be invited. 
The Clancys, Pagans, and the Doyles, 
Murphys, Degings, and the Gars, 
Whalen, Ragin, and Paddy Miles, 
The Bolivers and a 
hundred more. 
CLIORUS. 
'Pon me word the price was small, 
All is fair at Donegal, 
Finnigan's wake was nothing at all, 
To compare to this wedding. 
Music playing, whiskey flowing, 
Boys and girls with love were dying, 
Children in the corner crying, 
At McGown's wedding. 
Some were playing forty-fives, 
More of them were shaking dice 
And the girls were making pies, 
The bride was telling stories. 
Some were smoking their dudeens, 
Boys a 
hugging their colleens. 
More werc eating pigs an' beans, 
Anc_ all were in their glory. 
Fiddlers playing jigs and reels, 
I 
tell you we were a 
happy lot, 
Until the whiskey male them squeel, 
That is the time that things got hot. 
CHORUS. 
Maid and mother what a 
time, 
Did'nt they all cut a 
shine, 
Drinking whiskey sometimes wine, 
On the luxuriating. 
Hugging, squeezing one another, 
Children crying for their mother, 
All mix't up this way and ' tother, 
At McGown's wedding.

THE BROADWAY SWELL. 
Composed and Sung by the Celebrated Swell Singe 
Mn. HARRY BELL. 
I 
guess you'll wonder who I 
am, 
But listen and I'll tell ; 
Wherever I 
go, they tell me so, 
That I'm a 
Broadway swell! 
In a 
-,
--aggy, through the town I 
drive, 
'That you must know full well ; 
And you know drinking, that's my style, 
Of this, the Broadway Swell 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, you all know well' 
The dashing figure of this young swell ; 
If you don't know, the girls will tell, 
That I 
am called a 
Broadway Swell! 
While walking out the other day, 
A 
nice young girl to see, 
I 
met her at the Central Park, 
And she rowed that she loved me ; 
I 
guess you'll know her well enough, 
For she's called the Bowery Belle ! 
And I 
am known by all the folks 
As the handsome Broadway Swell ! 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, & 
I 
must be off it's getting late, 
For this young Belle to see ; 
She said she'd meet me at half- past eight, 
Walking in the Bowery. 
Good-bye, my friends, we'll meet again 
Some other night, and I'll tell 
Of this here dashing, nice young Belle, 
And also of this Broadway Swell! 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, &

FRIEND TO YOU. 
(ANSWER TO " You've Been a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED . SCULLY. 
Ali 
years have come and gone, dear Tom, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
WliZn you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in hand we promised, Tom, 
To each we would be true ; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
CHORUS. 
I'm still a 
friend to you, dear Tom, 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tom, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys; 
But now I'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, Tom, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
SP 
I'm still a 
friend, &c. 
Old friendship often withers, Tom, 
Whene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more ; 
But keep that honest heart of yours, 
We'll make old friendship new; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &A

Sung and performed 
By T. M. H

Of all the sources of delight, I'll tell with your permission, 
The one that lifts a 
young gent to the heighth of his am-

It is to be the constant theme of ladies' conversation, 
And know that they have given him this flattering appella-

A 
Fascinating Fellow! 
It's so delightful to be called 
A 
Fascinating Fellow! 
A 
man may be quite handsome and not be fascinating— 
It's in my style and winning ways, I'm so insinuating; 
Of course I'm sometimes sneered at, by the stupid, calm 
and srrious, 
But to my reputation that's in no way deleterious. 
Fine Fellow, kc. 
L's pleasing to a 
fellow's pride to be called a 
Lady-Killer, 
And it's my rcal triumph, as a 
Fascinating Fellow, 
To see the ladies droop their eyes, and watch them softly 
sighing; 
jiiv,o, that to me is really very gratifying.

The Old Home Ain't What it Ned to to 
By C. A. Wiirrg. 
OH, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be,

For no more we hear the darkies singing

In the fields I've worked when I 
thought ' twas haid, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, &c. 
row the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left the cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three score and tea. 
And he'll soon have to .ay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go unto a

There's a

It gets brighter still and brighter,

And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drivels suspense away.

When those we lov6 are absent, 
How wantonly you play;

I've been dini g and wining to-day you can see, 
In a 
manner remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
spree I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
mustn'n go home, ' tis no use. 
Oh I 
do feel so gay, so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a 
juvenile way, 
For I 
do feel so am fully loose. 
CHORUS. 
I do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
Of course you can see I'm out on a 
spree, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose, 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
And feeling decidedly loose, 
I 
was laughing and chaffing with ladies so gay, 
The excitement must plead my excuse. 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
And my heart went pit- pat like the deuce 
For I 
give you ray word this would not has e 
occurred 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, itc. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
said 'twould be bliss if she gave me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that! on my life! Tye been courting my wife, 
011 I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &o. 
Now what she said and I 
said may easily be guessed. 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the beet 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a

For to- night I 
am out on the loose.

To aim their daily bread?

On this you may rely: 
You will find out by-an-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny He 
Are welcome to apply. 
Just note the Irish girl, 
As she's skipping to the well 
With blossoms blooming on her cheek.; 
Like roses in he dell— 
She is so bright and fair. 
With her jet black eyes and hair—

Where the bullets like hailstones flew,

Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the Irish won their part. 
CHOEUS. 
Faugh-a-ballah ! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die ! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-an-by.

Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a

Wherever there you go; 
So don't treat them with disdain 
But show each man the same; 
Let all apply, that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come !

Then rise them as you should— 
For, 'tis fit we all do good, 
And never crush an Irishman, 
But rise him as -you should!

HENGLER. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The sun had just gone down 
While pleasantly meandering 
A 
little way from town, 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew.

She smiled so sweet upon me, (symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twas love the first I 
knew. 
There, some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
Choru.. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the tasky 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning. smiling, 
Said, oh! I 
think you rude, 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would.

Courtifl 
Cards,— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want 1. equently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are \ bided by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too tearful of a 
iepulse, to venture upcn asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
nient. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and beiag in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection', which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
