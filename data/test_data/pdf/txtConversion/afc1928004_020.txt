A 
Local Love- Lay. 
AIR—" Abram's Daughter." 
IF 
you just list a 
little while, 
A 
little song I'll bawl you; 
And if I 
cannot miike you smile, 
Why, then, I 
dull must call you. 
of Miss Dove, who fell in love, 
And made each heart a 
weeper; 
Her affections she bestowed upon 
A fancy young barkeeper. 
Chorus. 
With love,for her he crazy was, 
His heart was torn in Hitters; 
His name, I've heard, was Buzzy Bird, 
But they called him " Stoughton Bitters." 
Stoughton Bitters he was four feet two, 
But he dressed up in the fashion, 
And many charms his face peeped through; 
In fact, he was quite dashing. 
The " knocking down" he did up brown— 
He went it steep, or steeper; 
So he'd lots of cash to cut a 
dash, 
This fancy young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
THE FANCY BARKEEPER. 
At night to see her he'd post up-town, 
With heart as hot as a 
cinder, 
And there he'd whistle " Old John Brow," 
Right underneath her winder; 
And Wen they d 
meet, with kisses sweet, 
While love peeped through each peeper, 
And then she would with wittles'stuff 
The fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
Stoughton Bitters he was wide awake, 
And talked as sweet as honey, 
And to Miss Dove he love did make, 
Because she had the money. 
Her bank account was a 
nice amount, 
And he, than Old Nick deeper, 
Says, " very soon, I'll rake this pile," 
The artful, young barkeeper. 
Cborns—With love, etc. 
One night, 'twas in the month of June, 
The tale is most appalling, • 
His darling, being all alone, 
The kitchen did him call in. 
She gorged him well with beef and ale, 
His smiles in joy did steep her, 
She yielded to the amorous tale 
Of the fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus— With love, etc. 
When Stoughton Bitters gained his ends, 
She said in tones affrighted, 
" 
You've me undone, so make amends 
And let us be united.' 
He vowed he would, but then he told 
Her, that he could not keep her, 
She believed him, and gave all her gold 
To the fancy, young barkeepei. 
Chonts.—With love, etc. 
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. 
When Stoughton Bitters got the cash, 
He for New Jersey started, 
With a 
peanut gal he cut a 
dash, 
And left her broken-hearted. 
His victim soon was put to bed. 
And nightly wasn't a 
sleeper, 
To think that she'd been done, ' tis said, 
By the fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
That's the Way to Do It. 
The Fast Man's Song. 
Am—" Ho for Bob and Joan." 
I 
AM quite a 
beau, 
And through the town I 
dash on, 
Dressed from top to toe 
In the latest fashion. 
I'm a. 
sporting cove 
As all of you must view it, 
Up to every move,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Oborus—Fol de rol, etc. 
The truth I 
will confess, 
I'm fond of stylish clothes, sir, 
And always like to dress 
Just as the fashion goes, sir. 
A 
diamond pin so tine, 
Nothing equal to it, 
I'm bound to cut a 
shine,— 
That's the way to do it. 
, 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
Every pleasant day, 
You may see me walking 
Up and down Broadway, 
Or with some beauty talking. 
8 
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. 
The ladies all know me, 
And when I 
walk through it, 
They wink at me you see,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorug—Fol de rol, etc. 
Blooming tittering girls, 
Lord! how I 
love to see 'em 
Show their teeth like pearls 
At Barnum's Museum; 
Soon on one I 
lights, 
Quickly hand her through it, 
Show her all the sights,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
Once while loitering there, 
For a 
lady waiting, 
I 
saw a 
maiden fair 
The " Greek Slave" imitating; 
As like the chiseled stone, • 
So skillfully she drew it, 
I 
asked to see her home,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Poi de rol, etc. 
To every dodge I'm fly, 
For weeks before the races, 
Out of town am I, 
To watch the horses' paces; 
The horse that's bound to win, 
I 
quickly button to it, 
On that I 
bet my tin,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorm—Fol de rol, etc. 
Go now I 
think it's time 
To close my ditty handy, 
So waiter hand me prime, 
A 
glass of Otard brandy; 
atiiiaiwterA460t, 
THE LADIES ARE ALL MIRKY CRITTERS. 
9 
And just before I've done, 
This toast I 
will clap to it, 
Here's " The ladies every one 1"— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus.—Fol de rol, etc 
Ladies all are Il-walKy Crit-
ters. 
SUNG BY TONY PASTOR. 
Am—" Whack row de dow." 
OF 
the hurik,,- gals of 'seventy-six 
Our histories still ring, 
We all know how they helped the boys 
That fought 'gainst England's King; 
To help the cause they worked and toiled 
Each one to fear a 
stranger, 
And in defence of human rights 
They nobly braved each danger. 
Chorus—With a 
whack row de dow, 
The ladies all are hunky critters 
Whack row de dow, 
Though they wear the hoop de doo. 
That Congress seats they'd fill with grace 
Each husband will allow, 
When petticoats have government 
We all of us must bow; 
As rulers, time still proves the fair 
• 
Possess the greatest skill, oh, 
For, do or say what e'er we will, 
The ladies' rule us still, oh. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That. well our ladies could our armies 
Lead, we all can see, 
For tell me who like women can 
Command the infantry; 
10 
THE LADIES ARE ALL IIIINKY CRITTERS. 
When she the breast-works carries, then 
To fight who could defer, 
There's not a 
man who wouldn't stand 
To live and die for her. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That greatly she'd the pulpit grace, 
It is as clear as day; 
Fo,. who'd not soar to virtLe, when 
An angel leads the way; 
And that the bench she would adorn, 
I've said, and say again, 
For after all the ladies are 
Best judges of us men. 
Chorus— With our whack, etc. 
That they -re the best of counsellors 
Is clear to old and young, 
For how can woman fail when she 
has got to use her tongue; 
And that they'd best of doctors prove, 
Is equally as sure, 
For where's the ill in life, I 
ask, 
A lady cannot cure? 
Chorus— With her whack, etc. 
As brewers and distillers, who 
Can doubt the ladies' merits, 
For who so like the ladies still, 
Can put a 
man in .
spirits ; 
That good upholsterers they'd be, 
I'll prove it in a 
minute, 
For no house can be furnished, 
if there's not a 
lady in it. 
Chortts—With her whack, etc. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
As tailors to their merits, 
Every tailor still must bow, 
So well do they suit all mankind, 
As all men will allow; 
As smiths, each Smith the mastery 
Still yields unto his wife, 
For oh ! the chains the ladies forge, 
Are chains that last for life. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That they'd make famous nursery-men, 
Our children fully prove; 
And were tney but our gardeners, 
For tu-lips none would rove; 
Such flowers within themselves they'd be, 
They still would charm life's fever; 
Be balsam to our anguish too, 
And hearts- ease prove for ever. 
Chorus—With their whack, etc. 
And thus I 
think I've clearly proved 
The ladies all in all, 
And while we've them to etid us, 
Sure Columbia ne'er can fall, 
And 'tis my firm belief they might 
Soon bring men to that station, 
As to be merely used for to 
Keep up the population. 
Chorus—With their whack, etc.

Annie Laurie." 
SHE has beauties without number, 
But her heart's as hard as stone, 
Though my love for her wont slumber. 
Sure she wont have me, ° eh hone 1. 
She wont have me, oeh hone !— 
Though 
I 
know her purse is long, 
Yet, her scorn it adds fresh fuel 
To the love of Paddy Strong. 
I 
have tould her she's a 
cratur 
Too good to walk the earth; 
But I 
said not it was swater, 
Just to know her money's worth— 
To know her money's worth, 
For her fortune is my song, - 
Sure the cash it is I'm wanting, 
Not herself, says Paddy Strong. 
Oh! they tell me she's a 
widdy, 
That her husband sudden died, 
And advise me not to wed her, 
And I 
don't know what beside— 
I 
don't know what beside; 
But herself might not live long, 
Then, of course, her cash she'd lave me, 
Big thing for Paddy Strong.

WERRY MYSTERIOUS. 
It was only 't 
other morning, 
Just a 
week or two ago, 
That I 
gave the cratur warning, 
How my love was so and so— 
My love was so ana so; 
But she thought I 
acted wrong, 
Then she said l'd best be moving,__ 
What a 
blow for Paddy Strong I 
I'll go and talk unceasing, 
But the divil a 
word 
spake, 
For my love is fast increasing 
For her cash, and no mistake— 
Her cash, and no mistake, 
Love-letters I've sent, a 
throng; 
But just like many others, 
I 
can't write, says Paddy Strong. 
I'm great in form and figure, 
Barring I'm but four foot two, 
I'm fair as any nigger, 
With a 
squinting eye to view— 
A 
squinting eye to view; 
But good luck I'll be among, 
For I'll coax and taize the widdy, 
Till I 
make her Mrs. Strong. 
Werry Mysterious ; 
OR, THE GAMEOLIER'S BRIDE. 
Ant—" Werry Pekooliar." 
ALAS! what a 
world of misfortune and care 
Is this world of ours, I 
protest and declare, 
Each day something happens to fill us with woe, 
And oppress us with grief, as I 
shortly will show. 
ERRY MYSTERIOUS. 
15 
I 
once was so happy, beset by no sorrow, 
I 
laughed, danced, and chatted, nor cared for to-morrow, 
But how soon I 
was changed when I 
met with Miss Fearis, 
There was something about her so werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Werry mysterious: werry mysterious and 
siagular, indeed. 
I 
can't prezactly describe 
it, but 
There 
as something about her, etc. 
I 
met her one day in the Central Park, 
She was walking along with a 
dashing young spark, 
Her dress of pink muslin so daintily made, 
Declared her to be a 
dress-maker by trade. 
Her looks I 
shall never forget any more, 
Like lightning they shot to my very heart's core, 
She gave me a 
card with the name of Miss Fearis 
, 
By jingo, thinks I, this is werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Well, it was werry mysterious to think of me 
cutting out the fancy chap she was a 
walking 
with. Oh, the sweet glance she gave re I I 
wilted right down into my boots, and I 
was 
up to snuff, and sound on the goose. 
I 
couldn't help thinking ' twas werry, etc. 
Mpheart was so filled up with joy and delight, 
The thoughts of her kept roe awake all the night, 
Next morning quite early with spirits I 
rose, 
And dressed my-elf smart in my best suit of clothes. 
Before her shop door all the day I 
did stroll, 
Love burnt in my breast like a 
furnace of coal; 
But not e'en a 
glimpse did I 
catch of Miss Fearis, 
Which I 
couldn't help thinking was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Werry,mysterious, indeed I After thinking 
I 
had such a 
big thing on ice ; walking all 
day till my teeth chattered and my toe-nails 
cracked with the cold, and I 
was as hoarse 
as a 
hop-toad with the asthma. 
Of course— 
I 
couldn't help thinking, etc. 
WEBBY MYSTERIOUS. 
The next day Miss Fearis I 
happened to meet, 
While brimful of thoughts, walking through Chatham Street, 
he curtsied so sweet, and said, " How d'you do ?" 
That I 
felt like a.
 " hunky boy" then, wouldn't you ? 
Then we walked up the Bowery to purchase some collars, 
And I 
bought her a 
necklace, which cost me ten dollars; 
At parting she kissed me, did pretty Miss Fearis, 
Yet something about her was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there was a 
sort of a 
kind of a 
half smile, 
three parts grin, in the manner in which she 
thanked me for the necklace, as she said, in 
the words of Byron, " Bully for you, Johnny. 
You're a 
pertty little boy, with a 
bully glass 
eye, a. wooden nose and a 
copper coffee. 
grinder." 
Still it rayther struck me that 
There was something, etc. 
Next day I 
did call at her house; but, how queer, 
I 
found she was married to a 
gay gam.bo-lier. 
I 
began to upbraid her, the hard-hearted jade, 
But, I 
ne'er will forget the vile trick that she played. 
In a 
werry large cistern, quite up to my chin, 
I 
was soused till completely wet through to my skin, 
While the gay gam-bo-lier that had charge of Miss Pearls, 
Cried, " Duck him again!" 
Now, 'twas werry mysterious.. 
SPOKEN—There was a 
cooler. 
After buying her a 
ten-
dollar necklace, to shiver my warm spirits in 
cold water, soused like a 
pig's foot. 
Miss 
Pearls laughed. 
it was fun to her, but the 
point was invisible to me. 
In fact, I 
can't 
bear to eat, sleep, drink, or make water ever 
since. 
Such conduct, in my Opinion,_ 
There was something, etc. 
I 
feebly crept home, filled with aches and with pain, 
Confined to my room I 
was six months insane, 
Talked of nothing but blankets and pretty Miss Pearls, 
Thich all my attendants thought werry mysterious. 
LANIGAN'S BALL. 
Recovered, no longer inclined to be gay, 
I 
walks about weeping the whole of the day, 
I 
never complain, but I've grown werry serious, 
But I 
met her last night, it was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Last night to ease my grief I 
took a 
walk out. 
I 
went into a 
basement in Broadway where 
there were waiter gals. 
One of the wirgins 
dropped in my lap, and, in a 
familiar \voice, 
asked, " How are you, Johnny ?" Great Hev-
lugs! it was the dientical Miss Fearis. 
The 
gay, young gambolier was made brigadier-
general of a 
division of stone breakers on 
Blackwell's Island. 
Miss Fearis was con-
verted, joined Henry Screecher's conglom-
eration, read Cock Robin and other good 
boojis, and carried lager bier to thirsty souls. 
Her perversion was wonderful. 
But still, her behavior was worry mysterious, etc, 
Lanigan's 13 all.

He gave a

With the rows and the ructions at Lanigan's ball.

'Twas myself had free invitations 
For all the boys and girls I 
might ask, 
In less than five minutes I'd frinds and relations, 
Singing as merry as flies round a 
cask. 
Jenny O'Hara, a 
nate little milliner, 
Tipt me the wink and asked me to call, 
Whin I 
arrived with Timothy Gilligan, 
Just in time for Lani.-an's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal lal, etc. 
Whin we got there they were dancing the polka, 
All round the room in a 
quarewhirligig; 
But Jenny and I 
put a 
stop to this nonsense, 
We tip't thim a 
taste of a 
nate Irish jig. 
Oh ! Mavrone, wasn't she proud o' me ; 
We " batthered the flure" till the ceiling did fall, 
For I 
spent three weeks at Brooks's Academy, 
Laming a 
step for Lanigan's ball. 
Dance— Whack, fal lal, etc. 
The boys were all merry, the girls all frisky, 
Drinking together in couples and groups, 
Whin an accident happened to Paddy O'Rafferty, 
He stuck his right r4t through Miss Flanigan's hoops; 
The craythur she fainted and roared " millia murther 1" 
Called for her frinds, and gathered them all, 
Tim Dermody swore that he'd go no further, 
But he'd have satisfaction at Lanigan's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal lal, etc. 
Och I 
arrah, boys, but then was the ructions, 
Myself got a 
wallop from Phelhn McCod, 
Soon I 
replied to his nate introduction, 
And we kicked up the divil's own phillilaloo. 
Casey the piper, he was nearly strangled, 
They squeezed up his bags, chaunter's and all; 
The girls in their ribbons, all got entangled, 
And that put a 
stop to Lanigan's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal, lal, etc.

Sung by J.

Am—" Chaunting Benny ; " or " The Album." 
No doubt you've heard of ragged Joe, 
A 
gentleman, and all that ; 
You've heard of me afore, I 
know— 
Or heard me call for soap fat. 
My pedigree aint very long, 
Although there's plenty in it, 
And if you listen to my song, 
Of course I 
will begin it. 
Chorus—You may have met me in the street, 
Or at your houses calling, 
Perhaps you've heard my voice so sweet, 
When " soap-fat I" I 
am bawling. 
At six years old I 
went to school 
And got my education, 
My master said " Unto a 
fool 
I 
was a 
near relation ;" 
He said my fate might be like his'n, 
Though I 
could scarcely hope that, 
I 
might go to congress or to prison, 
Or else might carry soap fat. 
Uhor cs—Y ou may, etc: 
But when I 
got the college through, 
And all its high resources, 
I 
started up fifth avenue, 
And went to holding horses; 
But there one day I 
had a 
muss 
With Mr. Brooks's flunky, 
Then, as I 
was such a 
funny cuss, 
Barnum hired me for a 
monkey

WONDERFUL MARCH OF INTELLECT. 
Next I 
went to blacking boots, 
My stand was in the park sir, 
My customers I 
always suits, 
I'd shine them like a 
spark sir; 
That business I 
made it pay,. 
So quite a 
pile it made me, 
But I 
blAckene,d Greeley's boots one day, 
And I'll swear he never paid me. 
Chorus— You may, etc. 
And now the soap-fat trade I 
tries, 
The best I 
ever took to, 
May every jolly cook e'er thrive, 
For it's them I 
have to look to; 
And soon I 
feel I'll be in luck, 
A comfort there's in that man, 
I 
know some clay a 
handsome cook 
Will marry the soap-fat man. 
Chorus—You may, etc. 
Wonderful March. of Intel-

NEW VERSION. BY J. F. POOLE. 
A 
ta—" Jeremy Diddler." 
NEW YORK is a 
wonderful place, 
Such schemes are daily arising, 
Each artist is running a 
race, 
To astound us with feats enterprising; 
To be sure it has ruined a 
few, 
But this you'll be just pleased to recollect, 
'Tis what we might judge would pursue— 
Such a 
wonderful march of intellect 
Of course you must own that is so, 
In this wonderful age of intellect. 
WONDERFUL MARCH OF INTELLECT. 
21. 
A proposal we lately have had, 
The darkies to move from their station, 
South America they'd populate, 
And form a 
new African nation ; 
But the " gre.tsers," you know, heard the news, 
To have the" mokes" there they did object, 
And so the whole plan bursted up— 
Oh ! wonderful march of intellect. 
£'/w.—Of course, etc. 
To walk now some are not content, 
In balloons they must mount like a 
rocket, 
So if breaking their necks they prevent, 
They at least break a 
hole in their pocket. 
The opera is now quite the rage, 
High- scented Italians we so respect ; 
" 
Old Hundred" is behind the age— 
Oh I 
wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc. 
Our forefathers boasted with pride, 
That Shakespeare's works would enlighten us; 
But with horrors we're now horrified, 
So that even the spirits won't frighten us. 
Dictionaries all are now let slip, 
Our phrases are now, if I 
recollect— 
" 
Over the left," " Let her rip,"— 
Oh! wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc. 
" 
That's what's the matter," " Played out," [man; 
" 
Be a

"

don't see it," "A 
big thing on ice," 
" 
How are you, Judge ?" " Or any other man." 
" 
Skedaddle," " Spondulicks," " Vamose," 
All this I 
suppose now is quite correct; 
But they weren't in use long ago— 
Oh wonderful march of intellect.

Comedian. 
FELLOW-REARFAIS and heareresses, having being squilic-
itated by some of de principal members of dat " nine hun-
dred thousand " to lecture before you dis evening, I 
have 
been industriously conglomerating a 
hypersquilateral col-
lection of approgious and useful notes and tings, but, my 
beloved woodchucks, I 
stopped at a 
Hungarian lager bier 
saloon, to recuperate my culinary physiology wid a 
glass 
of dat salubrious, beverage, and while I 
was investigating 
de—de—consorts of de institution I 
left my notes and tings 
on a 
head of cabbage. 
What was de squences? 
Why, a 
gentle maiden, of forty years, sneaked off cabbage, notes, 
and all, and in less dan free seconds it was chopped up into 
sour-krout, filling de combustible regions of some Dutch-
man's segastric metamophis.

Tars life we know is mostly blanks, though some may get

And this you know whate'er our rank, we think ourselves 
most wise ; 
Now, some are seared to take a 
wife, I'll prove it if I 
can, 
The greatest blessing in this life, is to be a 
married man. 
Now, I 
was single once myself, and out at nights did roam, 
And then with others spent my cash, and pennyless went 
home; 
Next morn my head was aching so, for my bitters off I 
raft 
And it was best, I 
soon found out, to be a 
married man. 
And if so be a 
house you keep, and get romping with the

And when a

afraid;

A 
young'un you expect she'll bring, that often is their plan, 
But that sort of thing, it seldom happens to a 
married man. 
If single, you should get in debt, you're bothered every way, 
And if they get you into court, they're bound to make you 
Pay; 
But if about your wife you speak, make an excuse you can, 
And then they quick " let up" on you, 'cause you're a 
mar-
ried man. 
My moral, now, is this, you see, if you're inclined to roam, 
To keep from troubles ever free, you'd better stay at home; 
To single men take, take my advice, avoid each 
nare an 
plan, 
If after a " big thing on ice," go be a 
married man.

Or puts up with bacon and beer — 
Chorus—And there's nothing like tinkering, 
Ha! ha! 
A

I 
don't pay, for that makes things dear, 
And honesty's all my eye; 
For you find rogues everywhere. 
Of police I 
am never in dread, 
For I'm not such an ignorant fool 
As to prig before all are in bed, 
Which you'll own is an excellent rule. 
Chorus—And there's nothing like tinkering, 
Ha! ha! 
I 
confess I'm a 
handsome man, 
Though I'm soiled with the smoke, I 
know ; 
And I'm fond of my glass and my can, 
And a

Upon my word 'its true, 
He could carry a

As if 'twere nothing to do. 
Chorus—Then go it Mister Brown, 
You know you're mighty strong, 
If other folks can take you down, 
Why don't they come along. 
He all at once resolved to go 
As a 
soldier out to fight; 
To pulverize the boasting foe, 
Then blow their dust from sight; 
MR. BROWN FlLE ASTONISHING. 
Then with him he took snch a

Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
In the midst of the fight, a 
cannon ball 
Came whizzing o'er the plain, 
He caught it, and without letting it fall, 
He threw it back again. 
The enemy were sore afraid, 
And all began to run ; 
But this cannon ball such havoc made, 
It killed them every one. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
He was, indeed, a 
wonderful man, 
To sea he. took a 
trip ; 
But so very high the wild waves ran, 
They soon capsized the ship. 
But, bless you, this was naught to him, 
A 
trifle and no more, 
For like a 
fish this man did swim, 
Twelve hundred miles to shore. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
He mesmerism knew so well, 
Its effects he oft would try, 
Once touching an oyster on the shell, 
He made the oyster fly ; 
Right round the world this oyster fled, 
You may depend upon it, 
And what is more, 'tis truly said, 
With Mr. Brown stuck on it. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc.

'Twos like a

Indeed he once made smoke enough,

Now Mister Brown could sing a 
song, 
With a 
tune enchanting quite, 
That would take you full a 
fortnight long 
Tb sing it, day and night; 
But then he had a 
voice so clear, 
Crack singers he'd defy, 
His upper notes you'd plainly hear, 
Though he pitched 'ern ten miles nigh. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
This clever man could dance so well, 
And that so very light, 
You may believe ue when I 
tell, 
He once jumped out of sight; 
Just at that time, beneath the sky 
There sailed a 
large balloon, 
He stopped the ear, bid them " good night," 
Then jumped into the moon.

TwAs in a 
street, on the east side, in this big town of ours, 
A maiden fair did long reside, her name was Kitty Bowers, 
The sweets of life had long been her's, but soon she felt its 
sours, 
For love approached, quite unawares, and wounded Kitty 
Bowers. 
The baker who the dinner baked and brought at stated hours, 
Was not aware how throbbed and ached the heart of Kitty 
Bowers. 
But chatty quite he soon became and talked of Hymen's 
powers 
In flowery words, which did inflame the breast of Kitty 
Bowers. 
36 
JOE BOWERS' 
SISTER KITTY. 
On Sunday out to Jones' Wood, her bonnet trimmed with 
flowers. 
With the baker, drinking lager bier, the lovely Kitty Bowers, 
The fluids there quite strong Id prove, delightful pass'd 
the hours, 
For the baker talked all day of love, and so did Kitty Bowers. 
But rivals oft block up love's road, of different size and 
powers, 
And a 
gardener, living away up town, he wanted Kitty 
Bowers. 
Oft at her window he would stand with pots of fragrant 
flowers, 
And all he wished for was the hand, he said, of Kitty Bowers. 
At length, the rivals they did meet and fought one day for 
hours, • 
But the baker being bravest beat, and claimed sweet Kitty 
Bowers ; 
The gardener took it so to heart he lost both speech and 
powers, 
And soon with death he did depart, through grief of Kitty 
Bowers. 
Now to church as they walked arm-in-arm, the rain came 
down in showers, 
And the darkness greatly did alarm the timid Kitty Bowers, 
And as the churchyard they walked through the clock 
struck out twelve hours, 
When the gardener, dressed in apron blue, appeared to 
Kitty Bowers. 
" 
False girl," says he. " you thought me dead, and passed 
with joy your hours, 
But this night to deck my bridal bed, I'll have you, Kitty 
Bowers." 
Then fast he seized her by the arm with more than mortal 
powers, 
And the rain and him were quickly gone, and so was Kitty 
Bowers. 
DON'T POKE YOUR SNOUT IN A FAMILY QUARREL. 37 
The baker backwards fell with fright in a 
grave scarce dug 
three hours, 
And the people thought he was quite right to follow Kitty 
Bowers. 
His bakings brown, he baked no more, nor dealt again in 
flowers, 
And that's the last of the gardener, the baker, and Kitty 
Bowers.

He wanted bread and butter with his tea, tea, tea; 
Says she " I'll rule the roast,

So then to loggerheads with him went she, she, she. 
Now there was one Mr. Moore 
Who lived on the first floor, 
This man was very strong in the wrist, wrist, wrist; 
He overheard the clatter 
About the bread and butter, 
So he knocked down Mr. Bourne with his fist, fist, fist. 
Says he, " upon my life, 
You shall not b

For that is both a

AII1—"Lord Loud." 
ONE Gobble O'Gobble of eating renown, 
Bolted pork so remarkably fast, 
That where'er in his buggy he travelled from town. 
Oh! he longed for each pig that he passed. 
Passed, passed, passed, etc. 
To Ohio he travelled in love with the name, 
Where he found them as merry as gigs, 
At the sign of the Hog, and of infinite fame 
For dishing up young sucking pigs. 
The bill of fare couldn't boast a 
pig or pork pie, 
Which enraged this swine-eating sinner, 
Till the waiter said, " Sir, we've thirteen in the stye, 
And the fattest we'll cook for your dinner." 
"Lay the cloth, then in haste, I 
shall stay for a 
week, 
And dine in this room, if not taken ; 
For then I 
can hear the pigs' musical squeak, 
Though their squeaking will not save their bacon." 
Thus day after day the poor pigs went to pot, 
Till he'd bolted a 
dozen or more ; 
And whene'er he was asked what for dinner he'd got— 
"Why a 
dear little pig to be sure." 
Once more he was roused by a 
terrible cry, 
John answered the bell that had rung. 
And informed him that all the old pigs in the stye, 
Were enraged at his eating their young. 
" 
Why then my fine fellow to end all this row, 
And finally settle the squall; 
So order the butcher to stick the old sow," 
So he paid for and gobbled them all. 
In Ohio the hogs all signed a 
petition, 
And stuck it on every stye, 
Which the sapient pig of learned tradition, 
Explained as he chanced to ride by.

"Oh, shame!" he exclaimed, with grunt and with squeaks,

JACK OAKIIAM was a 
seaman good, 
As ever stood to gun; 
And when on shore was always first, 
To join a 
bit of fun. 
One night, as on the dock he strolled, 
A 
play bill caught his eye, 
By which " The Tempest" was announced 
In letters three feet high. 
Jack, though he'd never seen a 
play, 
To join the folks was willing, 
So straight he mounted up aloft, 
For which he paid a 
shilling. 
The curtain rose, the play commenced 
With thunder, lightning, rain, 
The vessel, with a 
horrid crash, 
Was instant sent in twain. 
That moment all the gallery props 
Gave way in sullen fit, 
And showered down the motley crew 
Right headlong in the pit, 
Says Jack, " If this be play, my lads, 
By Jove, I'll instant strike it; 
It may be fun for aught I 
know, 
But dam'ine if I 
like it.

To make a

And to the " Bowery" then-he strolled— 
" 
The Tempest" was the play. 
But slily in the pit he got, 
Rememb'ring former folly, 
And far removed from danger's shore, 
Determined to be jolly. 
Soon as the well-known scene began, 
And lightnings rent the skies, 
He twisted round with cunning leer, 
And upwards turned his eyes. 
" 
Hold hard aloft, you jolly dogs,

like these jovial parties;

For hcre you come my hearties."

AIR—" All round my Hat." 
My song it's of a 
young man, his name was Johnny Gil-
hooly ; 
He boarded at the Astor, and he went it 
" on his 
face." 
His parents they were wealthy, and this young man was 
healthy; 
Ho travelled on his muscle, like John Heenan or Jim 
Mace. 
Now, Johnny was a sporter — a " coon," and nothing 
shorter— 
At billiards he'd meet Phelan, and out of him knock 
spots; 
He drove a 
fancy horse, too, that might have been a 
fast 
one, 
But it was windgalled and spavined, and besides it had 
the botts. 
Gilhooly went a-courting his washerwoman's daughter— 
Her name was Sarah M'Guffin, and her mother had the 
brass; 
WHEN A LAD, WITH MY DAD. 
43 
Every night he'd go to see her and out they'd go a 
walking, 
He'd treat her then to " lemon ice cream" wot cost a 
penny a 
glass. 
One night he went to see her but tripped upon the 
landing, 
And fell into a 
tub of suds that in the way did lie ; 
A,piece of soar) ran down- his throat, and when the old 
woman found him, 
She wrung him out and squeezed him, and then hung 
him up to dry. 
When Sarah Il'Guffin she came to hear what happened 
to Johnny Gilhooly, 
She roared and bawled, and screamed and squalled, 
and tore her lily red hair ; 
Then she swallow'd the washerwoman's basket and 
rammed it down with the poker, 
That was the last of Johnny Gilhooly, the brave, and 
Sarah M'Guffin, the fair.

My ould country blackthorn shillaly. 
Going through Cherry street there who should I

But my countryman, Larry McGaffle ; 
"

By the time we got there we were merry. 
As the dure we passed through, what a

I've all soorts of good luck at the raffle." 
Fal lid de ral lal, etc. 
Says Teddy, " That's mine, faix, I

"Says Barney, " You lie like the divil;" 
But Judy, in haste, then jumpt up to make pace, 
Saying, " Och ! Barney. dear, don't be oncivil." 
But Teddy stept out and hit him a

Saying, " My luck you've been trying to baffle ;" 
From Barney he quick got a

And the ructions connninced at the raffle.

Soon each faction enraged were in battle engaged, 
And the blood it began to flow freely ; 
But the whole of the crew couldn't lather us two,

My stick got excited, it wanted to fight, 
It longed to take part in the battle ; 
It hit Shaug,hnessy's fed such a

That it knocked him stone blind at the raffle.

But soon the polace for keeping the pace, 
To the sate of war marched in a

years ! 
While on history's page stands the contrast of Nero, 
The king of oppression and father of tears ; 
52 
THE AMERICAN TAR. 
Then raise the sacred strain, 
Let it echo back a,,ain ; 
Washington rise in each patriot's voice ! 
'Till all Columbia round, 
Swell with the joyous sound, 
And hill and vale in the anthem rejoice. 
The A:mei-lean Tar. 
A IR—" The American Star.", 
The goddess of freedom born down by oppression, 
In Europe's fam'd regions no longer found rest ; 
She wept at the heart-rending wide desolation, 
And languishing look'd for relief from the West. 
She heard that Col tunbia was rearing a 
temple, 
Where she should be worship'd in peace and in war ; 
Old Neptune contirm'd it, cried lo ! here's a 
sample, 
Presenting with pride an American Tar. 
Cease weeping, then, goddess, to thee I've consigned him, 
lie loves thee and he thy protector will be ; 
Believe me a 
more gallant youth you will find him, 
*Than ever bore your banners through ocean or sea. 
When his galley he trims, firm resolved for the onset, 
Wo ! wo ! to that foe, who his prowess will dare, 
Long vill his country lament, that he e'er went 
And bray'd the avenging American Tar. 
He boasts not, but firm as the oak of his forest, 
Serene as a 
calm ; but fierce as a 
storm, 
When wild roars the battle you'll find him the fore-
Most ; 
When victor, the prostrate protecting from harm. 
And I 
have decreed, he's so gallant a 
fellow, 
O'er my wide dominions he shall be a 
star 
Will light you in triumph, o'er ev'ry billow, 
His name, listen angel ! American Tar. 
The proud turban'd Turk, my dominions infested, 
And piracy roarn'd uncontroll'd o'er the wave ; 
PAT AND THE DUTCHMAN . 
63 
His courage the tar of Columbia tested, 
And taught him that freemen though peaceful are 
brave. 
Leviathan dread, who controls the wide ocean, 
And opes his huge jaws for destruction and war ; 
Who, vaunting his strength, throws the world in com-
motion, 
Shrinks back in dismay from the American Tar. 
For the rights of his country he fights, not for plunder, 
No longer injustice shall harrow the deep ; 
I 
give him my trident and Jove gives him thunder, 
And well he the sacred deposits will keep. 
Beneath his mild sway, sailor's rights well protected 
Shall be, and free trade spread its blessings afar ; 
The praises of nations shall greet the respected, 
The daring, heroic American Tar. 
Put and the I:out elrinall. 
Ant--" Down, Derry Down." 
It's not long ago of a 
cowld frosty night, 
A 
poor Irish fisherman got a 
sad fright ; 
His cabin it stood by the side of the sea, 
And he sat drinking whisky and thought it 
Derry down, etc. 
His candle was one that had never a 
wick, 
"Twas the moon—but it shone not, the night was so 
thick; 
When a 
voice from the ocean roared out a 
deep sigh, 
At the sight of which groan Paddy cocked his left eye. 
Derry down, etc. 
The groan was repeated, Pat ran to the shore, 
For an Irishman ne'er on distress closed his door ; 
"Speak out now," says Pat, " if 
there's somebody 
dead,'' 
When upfrointhe ocean there popped a 
black head. 
Derry down, etc. 
was tea.

PAT AND THE DUTCHMAN. 
Now the head wasn't black, it was only the hair, 
But when seen in the dark, Lord, it made Paddy stare ; 
And it made him stare more, when with voice loud and , 
It opened its mouth and sung out—" aw, mynheer !" 
Derry down, etc. 
By the help of his senses, Pat very soon found 
That the man had been shipwreck'd, but hadn't been 
arown'd , 
So into his cabin he led him at once, 
Saying " sit by the fire, now, and dry your wet sconce." 
Derry- down, etc. 
Now this sailor a 
Dutchman he happe.ned to be, 
Who of English or Dish knew not C 
from D ; 
And ' ..•:dy knew nothing out of his own tongue, 
But wirat good St. Patrick, his saint, said and sung. 
Derry down, etc. 
The Dutchman still kept his warm seat by the fire, 
And opposite to him sat Pat's chief desire— 
His wife—a 
sweet damsel of six feet and two, 
With a 
voice like a 
trumpet and throat like a 
cow.

Derry down, etc. 
They talked on by signs, and they talked on by winks, 
And sometimes by shrugs and grimaces and blinks, 
Till the Dutchman was dry and most plenteously fed, 
When Paddy hawkd off his tired body to bed. 
Derry down, etc. 
Faith he soon heard a 
sound which he took for a 
kiss, 
"Arrah, blazes!" says he, " sure there's something 
amiss ;" 
So out of the bed in a 
moment jumpt Pat, 
Saying " what is yourself and the Dutchman both at ? 
Derry down, etc. 
"How dare you, you jade, for to let him make free, 
In taking those kisses belonging to me ? 
Why didn't you threaten him at the first touch ?" 
"Oh, how could. I," says she, "when I 
couldn't speak 
Dutch?" 
A LIGHT AT YOUR NOSE .

A Light at your Nose. 
Sung by FAME STEWART E D. BERRY, W M. W RAY, and others. 
Au—" The Grumbling Wife." 
Kind friends, at your call, I'm come here to sing, 
Or rather to talk of my woes; 
Though small the delight to you I 
can bring— 
The subjects' concerning 'my nose. 
Some noses are large and others are small, 
For Nature's vagaries are such ; 
To some folks, I'm told, she gives no nose at all, 
But to me she has given too much. 
Oh, crackee ! oh, dear ! 
My cause of complaint and the height of my woes, 
Is because I 
have got such a 
shocking long nose. 
Some insult or other each day do I 
meet, 
And by joking my friends are all foes ; 
And the boys every day, as•I go through the street, 
All bellow out, " There goes a 
nose!" 
A woman with matches one day I 
came near, 
And just as I 
tried to get by her, 
Shoved me rudely aside, and asked with a 
leer, 
If I 
wanted to set her on fire. 
Oh, crackee! oh, dear! 
Each rascal, each day, some insult at me throws— 
As my nose isd t 
mine, I 
belong to my nose.. 
I 
once went a 
courting a 
wealthy old maid, 
To be married we were the next day ; 
But an accident happened, the marriage delayed, 
My nose got to much in the way; 
For the night before marriage, entranced with my blirs, 
In love e'er some torment occurs— 
I 
screwd up my lips just to give her a 
kiss, 
My nose slipped and rubbed against hers. 
Oh, crackee ! oh, dear! 
The ring that I 
gave at my head soon she throws, 
And another one too, ' twas a 
w- ring on my nose.

MR. FOOTE, MR. DEAD, AND MISS BODDY. 
Like a 
porter all (lay, with fatigue fit to crack, 
seeking for rest at each place, 
'Or like Pilgrim of old, with his, load on his back, 
I'm forced to bear mine on my face. 
I 
can't get a 
wife, though each hour hard I 
try, 
The girls they all blush like a 
rose, 
" 
I'm afraid to have you I" when I 
ask ' em for why ? 
" 
Because you have got such a 
nose." 
Oh, crackee! oh, dear ! 
Their cause of refusal I 
cannot suppose, 
They all like the man, but they say—hlow his nose! 
Like a 
large joint of meat before a 
small fire, 
They say that my proboscis hangs ; 
Or, like a 
brass knocker, naught can there be nigher, 
And in length it a 
pump handle bangs. 
A wag you must know, just by way of a 
wipe, 
With a 
grin on his face t' other night, 
Says, as from his pocket he pulled out a 
pipe, 
" 
At your nose will you give me a 
light.

Ant—" There's nae good luck." 
Now listen to a 
tale most true, 
That I 
have somewhere read ; 
And quickly I 
shall tell to you 
A 
tale of Mr. Head. 
M T. Head he wasn't very wise, 
Mr. Foote he was a 
noddy; 
They both, I'm told, did cast sheep's eyes, 
And wished to get Miss Boddy. 
Tol lol, etc. 
Miss Boddy she was young and neat, 
A maid of winning looks; 
MR. roorc, MR. HEAT), AND MISS BODY. 
And in a 
shop in Fulton street, 
She worked at folding books. 
Head thought she did approve his suit, 
And for her hand did beg; 
But she did love a 
charming Foote, 
Who had a 
handsome leg. 
Tol 101, etc. • 
Now Mr. Foote got footing there, 
And begged she would him bless, 
By giving Foote her charming hand, 
Which caused head much distress. 
Thus Head thought within himself, 
My heart this Cupid slaughters ; 
And soon I'll try to pull this Foote 
From off Miss Boddy's quarters. 
Tol lol, etc. 
Now Mr. Head a 
letter sent 
To this Foote, out of spite : 
To meet with pistol or with sword, 
And for Miss Boddy fight. 
Miss Boddy soon the challenge saw, 
Which tiled her with alarms ; 
She thought that Foote .might loose his legs, 
And Mr. Head his arms. 
Tol lol, etc. 
Mr. Foote took to his heels, 
And to the ground he started ; 
Miss Boddy she between ' em got, 
And Head and Foote she parted. 
Miss Boddy took away their arms, 
, E're either one was dead ; 
And so blows went from Head to Foote, 
And then from Foote to Head. 
Tol 1°1, etc. 
Then Mr Foote he footed off, 
For Head he'd beat quite sore ; 
Head found his back was broke behind, 
His heart was broke before.

Miss Boddy soon she gave her heart, 
Nor her consent long lingers ; 
And Mr. Focte he got her hand, 
By pressing her sweet fingers. 
fol 101, etc. 
And Mr. Foote is happy now, 
Possess'd of all her charms ; 
For every night, ' tis whispered round, 
Her Foote sleeps in her arms. 
It would not give us much surprise, 
Nor be as-ton-ish-ing ; - 
If from Mr. and Mrs. Foote 
Some little feet should spring.

Why, I'd tread on the tail of his coat.

The Fancy Peeler. 
Written and Sung by L. Simido. 
Asa—"Whiskey in the Jar." 
Come all you gallant lov-iers and listen to my ditty, 
I'll tell you of a 
peeler man, the pride of New York 
City; 
It took his pay to dress so gay, but yet he lived in Clo-
ver, 
His business on the corner was to tote the ladies over; 
For he was the ladies man— 
He was a 
fancy peeler, oh! 
He was a 
fancy peeler, oh! 
His name was Teddy Rae. 
There was a 
gal in love with him, she often used to 
meet him, 
" 
How are you Johnny ?" was the cry with which she 
used to greet him; 
The maiden was a 
waiter gal, her mother, its a 
fact, sir, 
She kept a 
three cent rum mill in the street called Rue 
de Baxter. 
But her lover was the man. 
He was a 
dandy peeler, oh! 
A 
fancy style of peeler, oh I 
His name was Teddy Rae. 
TETE BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
61 
Her father was a 
junkman, and one day the fancy peeler 
He nabbed him up before the mayor and swore he was 
a 
stelaer; 
And when the maiden heard the news she got quite 
broken hearted, 
She dropped right at the peeler's feet, she gave a 
sigh and 
fain ted. 
"Oh," says she, " you is the man, 
You are a 
horrid peeler, oh I 
You are a 
played out peeler, oh I 
I 
hate you, Teddy Rae !" 
4 
The junkman he got thirty (lays, the mother took to 
drinking, 
The sheriff took the rum mill, and he bust it up like 
winking ; 
Then a 
quart of prusic acid laid the maiden out cold and 
silent, 
The peeler soon was found dead—drunk, he's now (

The Seautiful Soy. 
Sung by J. CONNER, Comedian and Comic Vocalist, and received 
with repeated applause. 
Aia—" Darling Ould Stick." 
It was one winter's day, about six in the morn, 
When I, little innocent creature, was born ; 
There was doctor and nurse, and a 
great many more, 
But none of them saw such a 
baby before. 
They all swore I 
was like my papa ; 
" 
Yes, and see, there's the nose of his mama; 
With a 
few alterations, oh, la, la! 
We'll make him a 
beautiful boy !" 
" 
To make him a 
beauty," cried out Mrs. Sneer, 
" 
We'll be troubled unless the child has a 
sweet leer ;" 
62 
THE BEAUTIFUL BOY 
Then to give me this leer Mrs. Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose. 
This made me to wink and to blink so, 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh ; 
At last it turned into a 
squint, so— 
Which made me a 
beautiful boy! 
To make me accomplished I 
wanted one thing— 
My mouth was to small for the dear child to sing ; 
Then to lug it and tug it they all of them tried, 
'Till they stretched my sweet mouth nearly half a 
yard wide— 
Crying, " pull away, now, Mrs. Rider, 
It must be a 
little bit wider ; 
My dear mouth they split pretty nigh, sir, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy. 
Now, being complete, I 
was next sent to school 
And, to show (AI my make, was stuck on a 
high stool; 
When the children went home they cried out with 
surprise, 
" 
We've a 
new boy at school, with such beautiful eyes 
He can look any way so handy ; 
Such a 
mouth as he s 
got to suck candy 
And his legs are so preciously bandy, 
They call him a 
beautiful boy." 
T'other day I 
was asked in the city to dine. 
The ladies, in raptures, all thought me divine, 
And all, when observing my elegant grace, 
Neglected their dinners to gaze on my face. 
They cried, " I 
shall faint with surprise ; 
No gas- lights can equal his eyes, 
And such a 
mouth for pumpkin pies! 
Law ! ain't he a 
beautiful boy ?" 
Now, ladies, beware of Love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am, I 
shall steal all your hearts, 
And then you dear sweet little creatures you'll sigh, 
And doat on my charms ' till you languish and die. 
For, you know, I 
can't marry you all ; 
Yet, believe me, whenever you call, 
My endeavors will be to please all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy!

Come along, fellers, we'll all have a

side and the stakes Catlle to you. 
Years have not chill'd the love I 
cherish 
For smashers, and cobblers, and brandy, and beer; 
I 
can't get no trust and I 
feel rather queerish, 
And thinking of you, don't I 
wish you-was here. 
Soon jolly tight in the " Tombs" we might be, 
Still I 
am dreaming, ever of thee.

Call and see us when your passing, 
Haven't much that is enticing ; 
But to show that we're not gassing, 
Come, and stay a 
week. 
Maybe, though, a 
slight description 
Of our somewhat choice condition, 
Would involve your expedition 
In a

Cnoaus—Call and see us, etc. 
In the very topmost story, 
Nearly up to realms of glory,

Leaking quite a

There the bed- bugs double shuffle 
Round the room in playful scuffle, 
Though they try their joy to muffle 
In the best of blood. 
Call and see us, etc. 
There the boarders act outrageous, 
And decidedly pugnacious, 
As with appetite voracious 
For breakfast they prepare. 
Knowing all, by strange precision 
The sum total of provision, 
Which will, through a

Grace their bill of fare.

Expedites this congregation

Nought but hash and greasy liver !

Shakes their frames with dread.

Very brief the satisfaction, 
For they have the petrifaction

One that's much nn)re pleasant, in her, 
When she leave's this world of grief !

LUDWIG. 
AIR—" Seeing N ellie H ome." 
Farewell, mother! I 
must leave you, 
Freedom's cause I 
must defend ; 
And, if I 
in battle perish. 
Trust in Heaven unto the end. 
Freedom calls—and shall I 
falter 
Or refuse to lend a 
hand ? 
No! as long as life endureth, 
I 
will fight for freedom's land. 
Cuoaus—Courage, mother ! I 
am going, 
Freedom's drooping thig to save; 
When I 
am gone, refrain from weeping, 
There's an arm to shield the brave. 
Would you fain allure me, mother, 
By the ties of friendship dear ? 
Would you barter peace and freedom 
To suppress the falling tear ? 
Soon I'll hear the cannons thunder, 
Soon I'll meet the hostile foe ; 
Urge me not : I 
cannot tarry ; 
Duty calls me, I 
must go! 
Courage, mother! etc. 
Would you have our nation's emblem, 
'Unit for which our father's died, 
Tratnp'ed ' neath the feet of traitors, 
And by traitor bands defiled ? 
Would you yield to base usurpers ? 
Yield to fiends in human form ? 
Would you bow to stern oppression 
To shield your boy from harm? 
Courage, mother! etc. 
No! methinks I 
hear you sighing, 
Go, my brave and only son ; 
If, in freedom's cause, you perish, 
I 
will battle life alone. 
Hark L 
I 
hear the cry resounding, 
Volunteers ! we call for you! 
Good-bye, mother : Heaven protect you 
Here's, perhaps, my last adieu. 
Courage, mother! etc.

SCRAPS OF FUN. 
Lines suggested by seeing a 
fleet of yatchs, among 
which was the Water Witch. 
! 
what! or which is the Water Witch? 
Ah ! 
now I 
plainly see ; 
The water - which, the Water Witch, 
Is clearing swift arid free, 
I 
see the fairy Water Witch, 
And what a 
witch is she. 
It is often said of Franklin, as if it was something 
wonderful, that he " sought the lightning in the clouds, 
and imprisoned it on earth ;" in other words, he caugkit 
lightning. `This is nothing. 
Dan Bryant knows a 
man 
who, every night that he stays out after his wife goes 
bed, is sure to catch thunder ! 
FOR THE SAILORS. 
Would it be proper, in speaking of the Monitor, with 
only one sailor and her guns on board, to say that she 
was laden with a 
salt and battery !

Can you tell me bow the word " saloon" is spelt? 
was asked of a cockney. " Hin course—there's a

and a

A 
paroled soldier who had been out on the banks of 
the James River, came back and reported to his captain 
that he had seen a splendid sword and brace of pistols 
lying on the beach. • Why didn' t 
you bring them in 
asked the captain. " Because the conditions of my pa-
role, don't allow me to take up arms.
