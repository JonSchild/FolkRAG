SHAKE OF THE HAND. \ 
111( WALTER MACK. 
There's a 
feeling that thrills you with joy or with pain, 
That is felt in the shake of the hand; 
And records of ought but a 
thought you may give, 
When you faced to adversity stand. 
How many whose hand, though seemingly kind, 
Like an icicle chills to the bone; 
Not a 
shade of warm feeling within can you find, 
Though appearance will greatly disown. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me the hand of a 
man with a 
heart, 
That scorns to be seen in disguise; 
When you shake it you feel it is honesty's part, 
And the rest can be read in the eyes. 
There's others from whom not a 
sigh will awake, 
Indifferent and chill they remain, 
As if ail emotion was bound to a 
stake, 
With its limit the length of a 
chain. 
And should you through courtesy be thrown in 
their way, 
Where civility makes a 
demand, 
You just feel the tips of their fingers when they 
As if stung draw quickly their hand. 
Chorus. 
While others you meet more inviting will stand, 
And extend you their palm with a 
smile, 
And greet you quite hearty, at least with the hand, 
Though their eyes are away all the time. 
While some with a 
pleasure that's stamped on 
their face, 
Will greet you with truth in their eyes; 
From the grasp of their hands it is easy to trace, 
That there is not a 
shade of disguise. 
Chorus. 
A N, 
SUNG BY WALTER MACS. 
Hind friends, I 
am glad to see you all, 
Your attention I 
ask for awhile; 
I'm one of the jolly, jovial sort, 
Who like a 
few hours to beguile 
The hours of our life are but fleeting, 
The moments to short to be lost, 
The wave of misfortune soon reaches us, 
On life's billows we often are tossed. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
jolly old man, ha, ha! 
And I'll live just as long as I 
can, ha, ha! 
I'm always enraptured with joys I 
have captured, 
That's why I 
am called jolly old Dan. 
So now I'll bid you all good-night, 
And hope I 
shall see you again, 
I've done my best to please you all, 
And I 
hope I 
have not tried in vain. 
This word of advice I 
will give you, 
Do nothing to cause others pain; 
For if you cast bread on the waters, 
You'll find it will come back again. 
Chorni.

LIFE'S CROSSES, 
RECITATION BY VANDYKE BROWN. 
RECITED BY WALTER MACE. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, ET MRS. PAULINE LIEDER. 
He was old, and weak, and shabbily dressed, 
The time-beaten wreck of a 
man; 
Whose story the passer-by, might have guessed, 
If the face he had stopped to scan. 
Fate had dealt him many a 
blow, 
Now squarely, and now from behind; 
With sickness and poverty laying him low, 
Then cruelly making him blind. 
As I 
dropped a 
dollar into his hat, 
I 
said, your lot is hard; 
But he cheerfully answered, " yes it is that, 
For I'm blind, and poor, and bared 
From all that gives to life its joy; 
Yet, perhaps it's only my share; 
For the man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
walked through a 
famous up-town square. 
And I 
envied the rich man's ease; 
But, lo! on the silver door-knob, there, 
A 
crape fluttered out on the breeze. 
Ah ! this, I 
reflected, is gold's alloy, 
And I 
muttered to empty air; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear.

LIFE'S CROSSES. 
CONTINUED. 
heard the plaudits and laughter ring, 
In a 
theatre packed to the walls; 
Where the Star was a 
famous comedy king, 
Who smiled in response to the calls; 
Yet I 
knew be had buried— that day—the joy 
Of a 
life, with his dead child fair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
poet who labored long, 
In anguish and want, alone, 
Till he rose on the mighty:wings of song, 
To the heights which few have known. 
Then fell the blight of desease to destroy 
The sweets he had won in despair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
judge who was honered of men, 
For the power and place he had won; 
Yet the felon one day in the prisoner's pen, 
Was the judge's only son. 
And the iron law the judge could employ, 
While the father was crushed in despair, 
Die man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
And thinking of this, how wealth and fame, 
And honor and power and all; 
May each have its grief to hide, or its shame, 
I 
could not choose, but recall. 
The words that beggar blind could employ, 
In his cheery philosophy rare; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear,

ON THE ROAD, 
BY WALTER MACK, TO MISS "VIOLA CLEFTON. 
We struck a 
town at midnight, 
Us actors, tired, and weary, 
We walked eleven dusty miles, 
And prospects still looked dreary. 
We asked a 
landlord where that night, 
We'd lay us down in slumber; 
He says, ha, ha ! I 
have place 
Behind you pile of lumber. 
We slept that night behind the pile, 
The theremometer stood at thirty; 
As daylight broke, we all awoke, 
Hungry, cold, aed dirty. 
We started away before breakfast, 
With our worn-out grips in our hand; 
And counted the ties to Boston, 
And at Dudley's we made our first stand. 
For food we braced the actors, 
Also the hangers on; 
They steered us to the lunch bar, 
But, alas all the beans were gone.

It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sun, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ah! bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light, 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Grim death I 
thought I 
had found, 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh, 
It seemed so strange and far; 
I 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
' 
I'd smoked my first cigar. 
RECITED BY WALTER MACK. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAULLNE UEDER. 
If you'll listen awhile, I'll tell you a 
stor:y, 
About a 
man named Kendall; 
Gentleman Jim, he was called in the mine, 
One of the men whe came from New England, 
Somewhere along in forty-nine. 
You see he was different from most of us miners, 
Never was known to indulge in a 
drink, 
And while he was used to the ruffest of language, 
He didn't know how to swear I 
think; 
Always willing to help along others, 
There wasn't a 
bone that was selfish in him, 
He gave with a 
smile, and received with a 
thank you, 
For which we called him Gentleman Jim. 
We used to wonder how it happened, 
Jim went into the mine, for when 
He talked, he showed an amount of schooling, 
By no means common with laboring men; 
Some believed he had lost a 
fortune, 
Which clouded his life in early youth, 
'While others maintained a 
woman had shook him, 
But all we could was to guess at the truth, 
For he seldom talked of himself, or alluded 
10 
GENTLEMAN JIM. 
CONTINUED. 
To any event which had happendd before, 
But we found him out in spite of his silence, 
And knew he was made of the genuine ore; 
For when Sandy Williams was killed on the railroad, 
Leaving his wife and family in need, 
It was Gentlemen Jim, who sent them a 
hundred. 
And never was known to mention the deed. 
Women whose husbands were killed in the mines, 
Were quietly helped in their wants by him; 
And the children would laugh when they saw 
him coming, 
And shout hurrah for Gentleman Jim. 
'Twas the fifth of November, perhaps you read 
in the papers, 
About the explosion, how seventy men 
Went down in the mine that terrible morning, 
And only twenty came up again. 
God pity the homes that day which were stricken, 
As swift through our town the sad news spread, 
It comes to me now, how the man's lip quivered, 
When he told me Gentleman Jim was dead. 
He might have escaped the miners reported, 
But he stuck to his post heroic and grand, 
And died as he lived, that covers the story, 
In gtving to others a 
helping hand. 
We preached no sermon over his body, 
But every eye was moist and dim, 
And the prayers that fell would have carried to heaven, 
A 
wickeder man than Gentleman Jim,

THE DYING MINSTREL, 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACE. 
04:Wright isst by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you rem'ember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in may end song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my dance] 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A 
father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
He called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connection 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinctiou, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
Only a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
' 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
—' 
a 
I 
shall there meet my old friends, 
The minstrel boys ne'er 
in 
ill 
part 
12 
IT DON 1T 
BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
Cnouus. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to me. 
SUNG BY WALTER MICR. 
In a 
boarding-housh across the st.teet, 
Where all the Hungry actors eat; 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To pulverize the beef and hash. 
At noon they all get out of bed, 
And rush down stairs for to be fed, 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse, 
In the hungry, starving boarding-house. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat, 
No remarks about the meat; 
Please keep mum and hold your mouth, 
in the Hungry, starving, boarding-house. 
The cook sleeps on the second floor, 
With a 
padlock hitched to every door, 
So as the boarders can't get in. 
Now where is Mose when they douse the glim. 
The actors all sleep in the attic, 
And all night long they raise a 
racket, 
They give the chambermaids the run, 
And chase them witJ a 
gatling gun. 
Chorus. 
The other night an actor skipped, 
And out of the window he lowered, 
He lowered himself down with a 
rope, 
And for a 
freight train did elope. 
The landlord bless his darling soul 
In the morning called the roll, 
His daughter screamed and cried. oh! Lord, 
He has given us the sneak for three weeks board.

THE OARSMEN OF OUR LAND. 
SUNG BY WALTER MACK. 
This world contains some gallant men, 
and men that's known to fame; 
And in my song I'll mention them, 
and tell you all their names. 
There is a 
man in Canada, the first one in the van, 
His name is Edward Hanlon, he's an oarsman of 
our land. 
In the city of Philadelphia in the Centennial year, 
He proved himself an oarsman all others had to fear, 
He won the name that gave him fame, the world 
does understand, 
He's the noted king of scullers, and oarsmen of our land. 
There is another oarsman that is also known to fame, 
Faom the great State of New York he hails 
Charles Courtney is his name, 
Though defeated by Ned Hanlon on the great 
course of Sashine, 
He has a 
noble record, which is plainly to be seen, 
They talk about his sawing boats on talk you 
can't depend, 
He has a 
name and honor which he always must defend 
He has rowed in many races, and has won some 
understand, 
Which proves he's another noted oarsman of our land. 
They're many in our nation whom you all remember well 
There's Morris, Ross and Riley, good men while 
in a 
shell; 
With Smith, and young George Hosmer, and 
others I 
will name, 
When taken altogether makes a 
carnival of fame. 
But there's a 
man from Portland City, the last 
one I 
will name, 
Mike Davis is an ingenuity of fame; 
For he has won his name that gave him fame, 
as the world does understand, 
Those are the scullers of to-day, and oarsmen 
of our land.

IRISH GENTLEMEN, 
SUNG BY DOLAN & LYNCH. 
Here we are two Irish gentlemen. 
And we lately came across the deep blue sea, 
We left our homes and friends behind us, 
To try our fortunes in America. 
We have worked on the Elevated Railroad, 
On the steam boats we've run for many a 
day, 
But devil the hair we care what kind of work we do, 
But on Saturday night we always want our pay. 
CHORUS. 
We have worked on the Elevated Railroad, 
On the steam-boats we've run for many a 
day, 
But divil the hair we care what kind of work we do, 
But on Saturday night we always want our pay. 
We can sing and dance and play a 
game 
of forty-fives, 
And to shovel coal you'll find us right at home, 
With a 
hod of mortar up a 
ladder we can go, 
But we always let politics alone. 
You can find us on the street most any day, 
Looking for a 
job of work to do; 
No matter whether the day is hard or soft or rain, 
We're the boys that can do it up in style for you. 
Chorus.

MARY'S LITTLE CORN. 
Mary had a 
little corn, 
Upon her little toe, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
That corn was sure to go. 
It followed her to jail, one clay, 
For Mary she drank rum; 
And now she'll have a 
chance to pare her corn 
For thirty days to come, 
LITTLE WILLIE. 
Little Willie would read novels, 
And play hunter all the day; 
He wanted to be an Indian scout, 
No matter what you'd say. 
He bought him a 
little pistol, 
And put on his father's boots, 
And started for the western wilds, 
To hunt the savage Utes, 
No more he'll need the pistol, 
There's a 
wreath upon his brow; 
The Indian's went to his funeral, 
Little pants are vacant now.

One night I 
was invited, 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
I 
dressed myself up in my best, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd; 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigau's Masquerade! 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade 
Old Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
Chorus. 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

My name is Terry Duffy, I 
always eat my grub, 
I'm on the first base with a 
base ball club; 
The first match we played, I 
tore all my clothes, 
The ball knocked out all my teeth, and broke 
open my nose; 
It hit me in the stomach and then I 
let it slip, 
It bounced from the ground, and busted open 
my lip; 
I 
made a 
short stop, and to my surprise, 
I 
eatched a 
three pound ball between the two eyes. 
They offered me a 
thousand dollars a 
year 
to play, I 
thought it was fat, 
The batter made a 
miss, I 
got slugged with the bat; 
I 
fell on the ground, they grabbed the 
first bottle handy, 
They gave me a 
dose of horso medicine and 
I 
thought it was brandy, 
I 
soon recovered again, and I 
commenced to play, 
When all of a 
sudden some big J, 
,Was running like lightning trying to make 
third base, 
Picked up a 
rock, and hit me in the face.

THE TRAMP. 
RECITED BY FRANK LUDI. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothe, 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? why, she had a 
dozen— had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my 
feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day,

The stars of night were looking down, 
Beside the gate we stood, 
Her sunny eyes were soft and brown, 
'Neath her pretty little Gipsey hood. 
Oh ! she was like the lily fair ! (Break.) 
A 
little queen beyond compare ! (Break.) 
Around her neat bewitching waist, 
My arm I'd fondly reach ! 
And oh ! those lips I 
longed to taste, 
Were sweeter than a 
red ripe peach. (Dance.) 
I 
held her lily hand in mine, 
And told my love so true, 
The roses in the starry shine, 
Heard us whisper 'mid the silver dew, 
! 
like an angel fair was she, " ( Break.) 
Her cheeks would tempt the honey bee. (Break. 
(Repeat last four lines of first verse.) 
The summer night was growing late, 
The parting hour was near, 
And still we lingered at the gate, 
While I 
held her lily hand so dear, 
To speak the sad good-bye was pain, (Break.) 
Lut then she whisper'd, "come again !" (Break

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street. 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand. 
To help my mother - you understand! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said, 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " somebody's mother's" prayer was heard.

On these soft and balmy evenings, 
When the staTs are shining bright, 
To be wand'ung ‘Nith your sweetheart, 
is a 
source of great delight. 
Just one kiss and then another, 
For she must not stay out late, 
Oh ! those moments are so blissful, 
Breathing sweet words at the gate. 
Oh! delicious hours of courtship, 
Loving smiles intoxicate, 
Rosy lips all ripe for kissing, 
Breathince sweet words at the gate. 
Sitting quiet in the arbor; 
Now a 
blush and then a 
sigh, 
Not a 
word above a 
whisper. 
Lest some prying one is nigh. 
Thro' the vines papa is peeping. 
And he could not help exclaim,

One Misses McGovern kept whiskey to sell, 
Wich came from a 
sthill she secreted quite well; 
The Gaugers went round but they could find no clew 
To barrel or shtill where such whiskey she drew.

Who came to the widdy with smiles kind and sweet; 
For love of us all, Mrs. McGovern, plaze fill

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while, fears awaken. 
Dread of the fast corning sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the \\ ildwoud, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy.

Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chills the poor wonderer, friendless afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he going ? 
Must he repose ' neath the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking, 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is wailing to welcome her boy.

But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lost friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddepedl 
Mother would weletaue her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, tic, 
Go for my boy to- night! search through the city 
Tell him that mother will never forget ! 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will wary of prayirg

Bear him this message, where'er he is straying,

The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
gettine. stronger, 
Before that morn of sunshine when massa set him free; 
He used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
At breakdown and at party, old Pomp was 
hale and hearty. 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness, 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head 
CHORUS. 
The wool no more is growing, and Pompey's 
heart is knowing, 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for massa, and at night would 
court some lassie, 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed so fair 
and white, 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkies danc'd 
so fleetly, 
When fell the southern moonbeans in floods 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, and gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
Where Pompey once was happy before they set him free; 
The honey-suckle clambers above his silent chambers, 
But no kind hand has trained them since 
dawned the jubilee. 
'Neath southern suns the brightest, old 
Pompey's heart beat lightest, 
And sweeter was the fragrance these blooming roses shed 
But now he wanders lonely with dreams to 
cheer him only, 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head.

'Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so near its decay, 
Is dear to my heart in its treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my fevered cheek weep; 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the old willow chair. 
CHORUS. 
It rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with delights 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy they say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her old willow chair. 
Charm 
It stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old will .w 
chair that our grandmother made, 
And wbere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured of all; 
Bu 
a 
now in the garret a 
relic so rare, 
All covered with webs stands the old willow chair.

Tee been trabblin' night an' day to dat land so far away, 
Whar de yaller corn and sugar cane do grow; 
Oh! how happy I 
would be if de ole home I 
could see, 
And listen to de music of de ole banjo. 
Twits dar dat I 
was born, an' did work from early MOM 
Till de stars began to gadder in de sky; 
Oh what consolation for to reach de ole plantation, 
An' see de old home once afore I 
die.

I'll keep trablin' on, (sym)—yes, keep trablin on, (sym) 
An' hopes for to git dar by and bye; 
Oh! what great consolation to reach de ole plantation, 
An' see de ole home once afore I

Dem was happy days for me, afore dey set me free, 
An' I 
left my home and friends far behind; 
Dar was good old Aunty Chlce, an' de missus 
and Massa Joe, 
Who to dis ole darkey were foreber kind. 
Dar was all de gals and boys full ob fun an' noise, 
Dat used to gadder round de.ole man's door;

But I

An' my hair am turning white like de snow;

An' dey tell me dat de happy day am nigh; 
Den I

' For I

And thinking of the good olden times,

And she every day told all us boys and girls,

THE MAN THAT LIVES OVER MY HEAD 
RECITATION. 
BY WM. HA_RDMIN. 
Copyright 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
rm not much at singin' or makin' a 
speech, 
But seeing your faces so gay; 
And being requested I'll do what I 
can 
Before I 
have gone on me way. 
Of where I 
am livin' I'm goin' to speak, 
Or rather a 
neighbor instid; 
Who has the whole house in a 
terrible state, 
The man that lives over me head. 
I'm told that he sings for a 
livin' at night, 
In a 
big free and easy up town, 
To see him come home. I've watched many times, 
But always give up wid a 
frown, 
At three in the morning surrounded by friends, 
As weary I 
roll in me bed, 
He'll stand near the windee and bawl like a 
cow, 
The man that lives over me head. 
Last night the whole house it was filled full 
of smoke, 
I 
jumped from my bed like a 
deer; 
And found that the tenents were runnin' about, 
And raisin' the divil wid fear. 
I 
took matters easy and searched for the fire. 
Along wid a 
friend they call Red, 
And what do you think sure he upset the stmi, 
The man that lives over me head. 
THE MAN THAT LIVES OVER MY HEAD. 
CONTINUDD. 
He'll take off his boots and he'll give them a 
toss, 
That makes me jump out of me chair; 
He grunts and he snores like a 
pig in his sleep, 
And sober he's never I 
swear. 
He goes up the stairs like a 
horse wid a 
cart, 
On pisin he ought to be fed; 
He dances and pounds mid his fist on the floor, 
The man that lives over me head. 
At times in the middle of night he will blow, 
Upon a 
cornet that he plays; 
Till the neighbors awakened will hang 
round the door, 
And swear in a 
great many ways. 
The house it well knows when he's home so it does, 
Some day he'll be found lyin' dead, 
There's twenty-five families that owe him a 
grudge, 
The man that lives over me head. 
The neighbors and I 
to the landlord have been., 
He don't seem to mind us at all; 
He says we're excited wid nothin' to fear, 
And takes the whole thing very small, 
If he don't drive that (Evil from out of the house, 
To give us some comfort instid, 
Some night in his shirt-tail we'll run him a 
block, 
The man that lives over me head.

In Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green ; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but, she hasn't come as yet; 
he um!' seems to dawn upon Inc plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie 
once again 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch - 
lassie Jean. 
She said you would meet me, but I've waited long in vain.. 
In lands far away she  does r01/111 ; 
Her promise she will keep —oh ! break it not my Jean 1 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let me long not wait, let me meet thee 
soon, my Jean. 
And the heavens will smile on our love. 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

There is a 
lad lives upon our floor, 
He sings a 
song called the Hallway Door; 
He can beat Levy's Cornet; or Gilmore's Band, 
When he's singing The Sheeneys in the Sand, 
With my daughter Mary he cuts a 
dash. 
She told me last night he was her " mash;" 
She says to him, Tommy, you son of a 
gun, 
Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some fun. 
Last Sunday when I 
came from mass, 
He asked me over to have a 
glass; 
Says I, I'll take a 
drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again. 
I 
sang a 
song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the tarrier, 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fun. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
GreacoRoman fall. 
If he comes to the house next Sunday night 
I 
will fire him down a 
a 
couple of flight, 
And get the police to give him a 
run, 
For setting me drunk to have some fun.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the ill-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos. cried, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA 
V' 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas, her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the cherished. 
one relaxed their loving embrace, and when again tlm mother 
beheld the little p,eader the once bri4ht eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

As the waves around us roll, 
I

While the bells unceasing. toll. 
Will there be a 
fairer morning, 
With the sunbeams clear and bright, 
When we both go home to papa, 
Take me in your arms to- night. 
CHORUS. 
Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight. 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother . weak and hop less, 
Prayin ,, for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader, 
Soon relaxed f'r strength had gone, 
And the mother broken-hearted, 
In her grief was all alone. 
When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With the sun-heams clear and bright, 
She Went home ah.ne to papa, 
Leaving child and love that night. 
But she often bears her darling, 
In the heartfelt pleading tone, 
Take me in your arms, clear mamma, 
Words that come in dreams alone. 
Chorus.

CONTINUED. 
He had died of a 
broken weary heart, 
0! God, can such things really be, 
In this great heaving, throbbing world, 
And no one near to see. 
Yes, there is One, my friends, 
Who notes the sparrows fall, 
Whose loving eyes are ever on 
The Sinner, Saint, and all. 
A 
postal card beside him lay, 
I 
stooped and picked it up; 
It told the sad, sad story, 
How grief had over-run his cup, 
For on one side I 
plainly read 
The actors home and name, 
While on the other, were the words, 
No Opening, write again. 
He had went away and left us, 
Gone to a 
happier home; 
Gone to Him who bade us all, 
Suffer little ones to come, 
Gone to that bright and happy land, 
Where there's no sorrow care or pain; 
To a 
manager who never said, 
No Opening, write again.

NO OPENING, 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACK. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, sr MRS. PAULINE LLEDEL 
I 
heard of a 
preacher who once made a 
remark, 
Saying actors never could, 
Get in at the gate of heaven, 
Or do anything that was good. 
Now I 
think he was wrong in saying these words, 
For I 
know two or three of the boys, 
Who done good things in their life-time, 
And never made any noise. 
Now there was a 
man called Big Billy Devere, 
He sat up day and night, 
To nurse poor Stevy Rogers when sick, 
While others turned tail in affright. 
And Whittaker, lately hurt in New York, 
Had many to come to his aid; 
And a 
number of others, I 
could name if I 
chooss, 
Who are now in the church-yard laid. 
One day lately, I 
went across town, 
To an actor that I 
know; 
He lived in a 
tenement house up town, 
A 
place called Poverty Row. 
Times had been hard with him lately, 
Harder than ever before; 
So I 
thought I 
would go and give him a 
lift 
From my own rather humble store. 
I 
knocked at his door, no answer came. 
I 
listened all was still; 
And over my whole being 
There crept a 
death-like chill; 
I 
called for help, the neighbors came, 
We busted in the door. 
And found the object of our search 
Lying dead upon the floor.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
has gone in the pathudly to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or tnortg,age the 'ann.

It's sad to be ag-ed and feeble, 
And know that this life has no eharrati, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our protection, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy ; 
And Betsey so gentle and loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But be was led off by companions. 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left, his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he It veless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
IN hit none to protect us from harm; 
We only can suffer in silence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Fare thee well, for once I

Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I

That we'd ever say farewell.

But forget you I

When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own,

Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me? 
Turn aside, how can it be? 
You have left me for another, 
You have turned from me away; 
You are false, but I'll fwgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may ! 
You are false, but I'll forgive you,

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Flow the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo, er-e.

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen ; 
A 
kitchen full of dancers, 
In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS. 
Rise It, Reilly ! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly ! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout, Rise it Reilly& 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd acorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor. 
The - Rocky Road" is startin', 
A 
tune they luve so well, 
'7is now the ruction boomin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
A 
few nate words of blarney, 
To some bright buxom lass, 
A 
few clean swigs of potheen, 
Widout the aid of glass. 
And soon the shrieks of music,

warning ring, 
VIKA up and once again 
Th

Where the mocking-birds sings so sweetly, 
Many years ago; 
Where the sweet magnolia blossomed, 
Pure and white as snow. 
Where I 
never thought that sorrow, 
Grief nor pain could come, 
For to crush the joys and pleasure 
Of my sunny home. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I'm weeping, yes, I'm weeping, 
And sadly I 
must roam, must roam, 
Must I 
leave thee, I 
must leave thee, 
Good-by, sunny home. 
Flowers bloom, and flowers wither, 
Around the cabin door; 
And birds that sang so sweetly, 
Sing alas no more. 
Little did I 
think when happy, 
That I 
would have to roam, 
.1,nd leave behind my youth and pleasure, 
In my sunny home. 
Chorus. 
Other forms and stranger faces. 
Is all that I 
shall see; 
Which will bring to-morrow, 
Fondly loved ones who are dear to me. 
how my poor heart sinks within me, 
When I 
turned to roam, 
Far from those I 
loved and cherished, 
Good-by sunny home.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet, 'tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
Cnoars. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
hard words may be.used, but I 
like him the most, 
4 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorus. 
go behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

Don't ihmt Out the moonlight, mile; 
Let each silver- lighted beam 
Softly on my dying pillow, 
In a 
flood of beauty stream, 
Let it shed its radiant lustre, 
On my feeble fluttering breast, 
Let it bathe me in its brightness, 
Ere I 
pass away to rest.

Don't shut out the moonlight, mother,

have ever loved that light, 
And have gazed for hours together, 
In some still andisolemn night. 
On the pale moon slowly floating, 
O'er the starry home on high, 
Dreaming of that land of plenty, 
Far beyond the azure sky. 
Don't shut out the molnlight mother, 
Let it beam on me once more, 
Let it light me through the valley, 
To that far off peaceful shore. 
And when I 
am coldly lying 
In that last long dreamless sleep. 
, 
Lay me where the silver moonbeam 
Sealy o'er my grave will eresp.

She is so kind and true;

Oh ! my, her form's entrancing,

Now my pretty little blonde, 
We will meet to-morrow night, 
When the moon is out in full, 
And the pretty stars shine bright. 
Down where the roses bloom, 
I

I

My pretty blonde in blue.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
-Whose name was Peggy I 
myle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fu. 
She is from the County I 
owl', 
And she weiLdied two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the while. 
But if i 
had to do it again, 
She would it vet' go to Iwini 
Along with toe, down to Coney Isle. 
CIIORUS. 
She had Fait water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
'I hey all did Nave their hats, 
And shouted " Autat her pat,' 
1 
he day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle.

W e went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
- 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with Barnunts show, 
lint you ought to see toy l'eg upon the waves, 
The gang c 
onnienced to guy us, 
My bosom was on fire, 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
''Beheave us" shouted out, ( Chorus. 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feet mm?, after listening to that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But. if I 
had him in New 
York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say 1'111 a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter. 
But I 
can tak..t my own part all the while. 
Arrah-musha bad luck to Peg, site will stand 
upon her bead, 
Before I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
