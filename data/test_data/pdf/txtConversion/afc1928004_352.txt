MRS, MAGEE'S HOTEL. 
Sung by Dics. SANDS, with Great Success. 
My name is Mrs. Magee, 
And with me you'll all agree, 
That a 
nater looking Widow 
PDH '11 very seldom meet. 
I 
keep a 
large Hotel ! 
And treat my boarders well— 
In a 
respectable location— 
Way down on 
Street! [Break] 
The eating and the drinking there, 
I'm surc it can't be beat. 
I 
give them all Red Herrings, 
Onions and Pig's Feet, 
Corn'd Beef and Cabbage, 
A 
Wind Pudding, too, as well! 
That 's 
the way I 
treat my boarders, 
At the Mrs. Magee's Hotel! 
If you are a 
traveling merchant, 
Doing business here in town, 
And want a 
good night's lodging— 
A 
place where you can sleep sound— 
Just take a 
walk down 
Street. 
If you never was there before, 
You'll see my name in Latin, 
On a 
sign right over the door! [Break] 
I 
have Lodgings there for 25 cents, 
As good as any you'll find. 
I 
have Lodgings, too, for 15 cents, 
Of a 
rough and ready kind. 
I 
can give you a 
shake down for 10 cents, 
That you might not like as well ; 
But, boys, you all are welcome, 
At the Mrs. Magee's Hotel.

THE GAL THAT DANCED IN BABA

Not long ago I 
went to see 
Baba plaYed at Niblo's, 
I 
saw a 
gal on the stage I 
knew, 
We used to call her Loose-clothes. 
When she peddled applesand nuts, her name 
Was Mary Ann Mahoney; 
But now, her name was on the bills, 
As Mademoiselle Broccoloni. 
v 
CHORUS. 
5 
Dancing 'round the stage she'd go, 
Mashing all the bloods, you know, 
And spin like a 
top on her big toe, 
This gal that danced in Baba. 
She'd dance, and then she'd smile and bow, 
The applause came down in showers; 
And bloods, with glasses on their eyes, 
Would throw her baskets of flowers, 
She'd squirm like an eel, and raise her leg 
To a 
terrible elevation; 
She'd stand on her toes and bend the crab, 
Which caused a 
great sensation. 
Dancing 'round, etc, 
Her head was once a 
cardinal red, 
With hands like sides of bacon; 
But now, with her grand Italian airs, 
I 
thought I 
might be mistaken. 
I 
soon found out she never came 
From the land of maccaroni; 
For she fell on the man with the big bass fiddle, 
When I 
yelled out Mary Ann Mahoney. 
Dancing 'round, etc. 
Composed and sung with great success, at the Olympic Theatre, 
N. Y., by E. M . 
H ALL. 
Dedicated to DicK DoRNEY. 
From drinking too much lager 
Before I 
went to bed. 
A 
flight of wildest fancies 
Came rolling through my head. 
The,world seemed topsy turvy, 
And my he -went round and rourid. 
I 
dreamed the most outrageous dreams, 
With the world turned upside down. 
Repeat last two lines. 
0. K. Hall was dressed as a 
harlequin 
And he danced the Highland fling. 
Victoria) Queen ot England, 
A comie song did sing. 
Barnum acted Hamlet, 
And Edwin Booth played clown. 
But I 
think the show must have been N. G. 
With the world turned upside down. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Ben Butler he was president, 
With his squint eye straightened out. 
Boss Tweed he skipped to Europe 
By the rapid transit route; 
John B. Gough kept a 
sample room, 
Where he sold bad beer and gin, 
And Grant didn t 
run for a 
third term, 
With the world turned outside in. 
Repeat last two lines. 
I 
saw 'Victoria Woodhull, 
She was on the ragged edge, 
And Bessie Turner's novel 
Held up the Brooklyn bridge. 
But our heads will be bare-footed, 
And New York a 
country town, 
For that bridge it won't be finished 
Till the world's turned upside down. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Jay Gould was a 
licensed vender, 
And he sold ice cream and peas. 
G. L. Fox fox was a 
chinese juggler, 
And he lived on Jersey cheese, 
Tilton he was alderman, 
But the gang they ruled him out, 
And Beecher danced the can can, 
With the world turned inside out.

JUST AS LIGHT AS AIR. 
Sung by DICK TURNER 1 
W IFE. 
My heart is gone on darling little Norah, 
She's the pride of all Glen gall. 
She is the sweetest girl and I 
adore her, 
She's the dearest of them all. 
The first time that I 
met her 
Twas dancing at the fair, 
And sure I 
loved her better 
Than any colleen there. 
I 
danced to her; I 
twisted my shillaAah, 
And won her then and there. 
She can sing and dance so gayly, 
She's just as light as air. 
SITE. 0, have you seen my darling little Paddy? 
He's robbed me of my heart. 
I 
met him at the fair when I 
was dancing, 
And from him I'll never part, 
HE. 0, here's the little darling that I'm after. 
She stole my heart 'from me. 
SHE. 0 
there's the boy that charmed me with his laughter. 
And filled ii3y heart -with Glee. 
Faith we'l do the best to make you happy, 
This dacent Irish pair. 
We'll sing and dance for ever; 
We're just as light as air.

If ye plaze, sirs, we have here just landed, 
From over beyant the big sea;

We're willing now to work for you; 
For we will do the best we can, 
If you've got any work for to do.

And pack up our duds to come here— 
Sure the times were so hard and so bitter, 
An' mate and potatoes so dear. 
So we tackled the briny blue ocean, 
An' hard sure we worked on the way, 
For we

It's there we'd have ashens o' pay. 
Then it's anything, etc.

Tommy, Take This to your Uncle 
NOT BEFORE PA, DEAR, 
As sung by COOL BURGE'iS. 
SOIlle lovers are so bashful, 
They will never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why; 
But when my charmer's pa is near— 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa; 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
I 
don't mind, a 
kiss, dear, but not before pa. 
I'm very fond of flirting, 
But there's one I 
love best; 
I'm sure I'm rot too bashful 
In seeking love's request. 
Last night I 
went to see her pa, 
To squeeze her hand I 
tried; 
When I 
called her my little queen, 
These words she then replied— 
Not before pa, &c. 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lovers' seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which caused a 
dreadful sigh-;-; 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day," 
These words were her reply— 
Not before pa, &C-
As sung by BONNIE RUNNELS. 
My name is Tommy Dingelspiel, 
The reason I'll tell you; 
Once I 
could dress like other boys, 
And have a 
dollar or two. 
But now my father is gone bust, 
His business does not pay, 
And for to keep us all alive, 
My father has to say— 
Tommy take this to your uncle, 
There's a 
little dear, 
Tommy take this to your uncle, 
I 
want to get some beer. 
You know your fader's out of work, 
And the rent to- day is due; 
So run ' round the block, and put this tn hock, 
Take that to your uncle, do. 
My father's clothes they're all gone up, 
Also his boots and hat; 
The tables, chairs and crockery wares, 
Also the dog and cat. 
The bed and bedstead is • gone up," 
And we sleep on the floor, 
Tpere's only one or two things lef 
Then we'll be out of doors. 
Tommy take this, Icc

HE'S GOIN' AWAY TO LEAVE ME NOW, 
Written by Joe Banks, and sung by "The Banks" 
Music by C. J. Miers. 
He's going away to leave me now; 
To cross the ocean wave, 
To that land that's called "America," 
Where no man is a 
slave, 
To follow in the footsteps 
Of the thousands gone before, 
Who by dint of honest industry 
Laid by their little store, 
Where Ireland's exiled patriots 
Will greet him as he lands, 
And give "caed mille'a failtha" 
By the grasp of honest hands. 
c 
But where'er he be, on land or sea, 
He'll not forget " the while," 
That " bit of earth" that gave him birth 
Our own dear " native Isle," 
Though oceans may divide us, still 
L I 
will be true to him, 
He's going away to leave me now, 
And my heart is filled with pain, 
For it may be many years before 
I'll look on him again ; 
0, he kissed me when we parted, 
And pressed me to his breast ; 
"Acushla macree"—be true to me, 
His tears choked down the rest. 
All angels guard and bless him, 
And keep him for my sake, 
Is the prayer that I 
will offer up 
To him that did us make: 
But where'er he be, on land or sea, 
He'll not forget the while, 
That bit o' earth that gave him birth 
Our own dear native Isle, 
Though oceans may divide us, still 
I 
will be true to him.

THE WILD IRISH BOY, 
E sung by M ILES Mona's, at Fox's American Theatre, Philad'a, Pa. 
FAREWELL to the dear land I 
have left far behind, 
Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the boys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they will come here, 
To a 
land tilled with plenty and a 
land I 
love dear, 
I 
know they will bless me and it will give me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
There's the land of my kindred, I 
ne'er can forget, 
They may be a 
time coming when it may be happy yet, 
I 
wish to God it were now, for ' twould give me great joy, 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
Yes, to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy.

D. 
RUSSELL. Boston, Mass. 
where music can be had, pr:ce 35 eta 
WHILE strolling out one evening, 
To pass away the time, 
I 
saw a 
lovely maiden, 
A 
fairy form divine. 
'Twas in a 
flowery valley. 
Where a 
running stream (loth flow. 
'Twas there where I 
first saw her, 
Where the wa er lilies gr ) w. 
CHODIN. 
Oh! I 
never shall forget that night—Dance. 
Iy soul w s 
fill'd with sweet delight— Dance. 
Oh! it was down by the brook side we wandered to 
and fro, 
And there she promised to be mine, where the 
water lilies grow. 
I 
often met her after, 
Down by that running stream, 
And oh such tales of love 
I'd tell to my young lovely queen, 
On every moonlight evening, 
For a 
promenade we'd go, 
And oh! the happy nights we spent, 
Where the water lilies grow. 
CHORUS.. 
— Oh I 
never shall, &c. 
Oh! now I 
feel so II 
ppy, 
My heart is light and gay, 
For my lovely fair one 
Is to be my wife in May. 
And happy days we'll have then 
For we both intend to go 
And spend the happy honey moon 
Where the water lilies grow.

Won't You Never Lave Off That 
Ould Coat? 
Composed by CHAS. BUB.H.E. 
Sung by HAYWOOD & 
BURKE. 
My name is Dunleaven, I'm a 
trim Irishman, Sir, 
From the Gieat North of Ireland I 
came ; 
I 
was christen'd Cornelius, if I 
understand, Sir, 
That's the handle 'twas put to my name; 
When but a 
wee Gossoon, the old man's coat I'd put on, 
For I 
always was fond of such jokes; 
When all of a 
sudden you'd hear him a 
shoutin'— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat? 
Cnonns. 
I 
have traveled from Belfast all over creation, 
But I 
never yet had such a 
stroke, 
As when those boys shout--without my approbation— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat? 
This coat has seen numbers of great revolutions, 
In what they call fashion and style; 
But I'm bound to stick to it with a 
firm resolution, 
In spite of their gibes and their smiles ; 
They don't understand this was made for the Grand 
Duke of Derry, whose name I 
can boast, 
Or they'd never cry out, or attempt for to shout, 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat? 
I 
have traveled, Are.

WALTZING TO THE BAR, 
Written and sung by JACK CONROY. 
MY 
friends if you will listen, 
You I 
will surprise, 
Its of a 
charmer I 
met at a 
pic-nic, 
Whom I 
thought a 
prize. 
Her eyes were dark and gentle, 
And I 
loved her dearer than gold. 
But after a 
year of married life 
How badly I 
was sold. 
CHORUS: 
Waltzing up to the bar. 
Is a 
favorite pastime of mine, 
I 
always call for a 
strong drink 
Providing I 
have a 
dime. 
Oh give me gin or whiskey, 
Or old Jamaica rum, 
For since I 
married this beauty, 
I've turned out a 
regular bum. 
When our love was young and gay, 
How sweet I 
thought her glance. 
I'd place my arm around her waist 
As we went through the mazy dance. 
Around and around we'd go 
Mid the multitude so large, 
Oh how lovely it did seem, 
While waltzing on the barge. 
Waltzing up to the, & e. 
My married life is an unhappy- one, 
I 
have ti1l that plague of a 
wife. 
I'll go and seek to get a divorce, 
So I'll have peace the rest of my life. 
My family numbers six, 
The oldest one is a 
bloat, 
For whenever I 
sneak to get a 
drink, 
He clings to the tail of my coat.

BIDDIE DOYLE. 
As Sung by JAS. O'NEIL. 
Oh 1 
I 
have come over here, Biddle Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddie Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and baud, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddle Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddie Doyle. 
Ohl the summer is past and gone, Biddie Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddie Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow, 
And what will become of you. Biddie Doyle. 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddle Doyle. 
You know how it Is yourself, Biddie Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, B'ddie Doyle; 
You know you are old enough. 
And your face is getting row; h, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddie Doyle. 
So leave off youl. lamentation. 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddie Doyle. 
Oh I 
when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddie Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddle Doyle; 
1 
f 
I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that wil I 
make you quiet, Biddie Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me. 
Or if you do, 'I'll surely pound you. 
And I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddle Doyle.

I'm Such a 
Modest Young Idan. 
SERIO-
COMIC SONG. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, the great Centennial 
Vocalist. 
Air.—" Belle of the Ball." 
The darling of all the fair charmers. 
I 
am such a 
bashful young man, 
Too bashful I'm sure for to harm onP, 
From danger; like that I've oft ran. 
The night I 
was born, they told me 
That my modesty could not be worse, 
I 
would not let my mother behold me, 
And hid all my charms from the nurse. 
SPOfiEN.—Yes, I 
was born bashful. 
Most babies generally 
try when they make their first appearance. 
All I 
did was to 
blush, for— 
CHORUS. 
Pm such a 
modest young man. I 
am, 
I'm such a 
modest young man, I 
be, 
Don't look at me, for I 
blush, you see, 
I'm such a 
modest young man. 
Of couise I 
can never get married, 
Too bashful to ask for a 
wife, 
My hopes—as a 
father— is buried. 
Condemned to live single thro' life. 
No helpmate to comfort and cherish, 
No baby to hold on my knee; 
With shame I 
should certainly perish 
If the thing was suggested to me!

groittic-1, wag very near getting married once; but When 
I 
commenced thinking of what would come after, you can bet 
my courage gave way. I 
don't know how these married folks 
manage; I'm sure if it ever should fall to my lot to—to—well, 
you know better than I 
do—I 
should certainly sink through 
the floor, for— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, &c. 
Theyirst " pull-back' I 
saw made me dizzy, 
At an ankle I 
faint right:away; 
A striped stocking it sets me crazy, 
And I'm fit for no more thro' the day. 
As ladies walk past when its raining, 
And lift up the skirt gliding by, 
If a 
view underneath I'm obtaining, 
I 
vow I 
am ready:to die. 
SPOKEN.—And the more they show—the more palpitating I

A. dashing young feminine once fainted in my arms; she 
wore a low-necked dress! and the sight I 
then beheld so un-
nerved me, that I 
have never recovered my proper firmness 
since, for— 
I 
am such a 
modest young man, Ice. 
I 
would die at the sight of a 
bustle, 
Though to some it is exquisite bliss; 
It would weaken the strength of my muscle 
Should a 
female attempt me to kiss ! 
So girls, I 
do now give you warning_ 
Don't you think that I 
ever would wed; 
I 
should leave you alone before morning— 
With the pillow to grasp in my stead! 
SPOKEN.—I 
never could overcome the sensation! To be a 
married man would use me up completely. 
I'm too bashful, 
you know—in fact— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, t

The Lads Who Live in Ireland; 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney, 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meets pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know; 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderics, nor other sh..bby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show; 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've nin ety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name haeandac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, & c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry I 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where.shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, • 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show, 
Oh l 
those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & c. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he : 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country, 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go'; 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, &c.

KITS AND POTATOES, 
As sung by the German Comique, Bonnie Runnels.

Something I

And my name it is Fritz-Herman, 
Here I

Would like to sell to you;

As the people all pass by; 
You're always sure to hear me cry: 
CHORUS. 
Beets, potatoes by the dozen, 
For your uncle and your cousin, 
Oysters, clams for the jim-jams, 
And other things which was immense, 
Here's a 
box of nice tomatoes; 
A 
receipt for blowing bladders, 
All the lot I'll give to you 
For only seven cents. 
When its cold, I'm always freezing, 
Selling things is very teasing, 
When it rains I'm always wet, 
I

My wite, shc does always grumble, 
Tells me to go Mile a

If I

THE FEN1ANS' ESCAPE. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer 
Georgette," and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should 
Heave 
to. ,, 
_but noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag, that floats on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
I' ts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen, 
*Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran' 
He knew his chance was slim to right, the boys of Uncle Sam' 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and bold Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
He dared the English-man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands' flag of 
green. 
The Palace upon the Rocks. 
Written and sung by JACK CONROY. 
Pat McAllister of Harlem Flats 
Presents himself to you; 
And whin he has on his Hibernian dress. 
He is a 
masher too. 
A widdy fell in love with me, 
In Erie he has stocks, 
She has a 
palace at Central Park, 
Built upon the rocks 
SPOKEN.—And every Sunday, dressed in my cross-grain de 
Bashall suit, I 
visit the little palace, chat love for awhile, she 
then calls her only son in a 
musical voice, and says— 
CHORUS. 
Paddy come here to your mother, 
That's the darlin' dear, 
Don't you cause any bother, 
Run out for a 
quart of beer. 
Don't go near the Dutchman's avick, 
You know he is a 
skin, 
But go around where it is cheaper and better, 
Go around to Teddy McGlynn. 
I've taken her over to Hoboken 
On many a 
Summer's day, 
And there upon the Elysian Fields, 
Our figures we'd display, 
Hers was nate and trim, me boys, 
Three-fifty was her weight, 
She'd make me stand outside of the boat, 
For she wouldn't tit n 
a 
sate. 
Paddy come here to your mother, ,tc. 
In a 
snug retreat at Central Park, 
We wint one beautiful night, 
An' there we had a 
jug of the best, 
Both of us got tight. 
A 
policeman he came along, 
And the both of us took away, 
And next morning down at the Tombs 
I 
had both fines to pay. 
Paddy come here to your mother, &c, 
Written and sung by " Joe Banks." 
Mike O'Grady had been married 
Just a 
twelve-month and a 
day, 
When he sent some letters to the by's 
In which he went to say, 
As how about just two months since 
A 
darling had been sent, 
So he gave a " spree" to celebrate 
The glorious event. 
With a 
ml de doodle I, 
And the tural looral liddle, 
They played upon the fiddle, 
While they went up and down the middle, 
Such " taring bys and purty girls 
As ever you did see, 
A 
regular, rollicking soort of a 
dance 
Was Mike O'Grady's spree 
"Nora Creena" was there so nately dressed 
Along with "Pat Malloy", 
Larry O'Gaff, " Kitty from Cork 
And "Ted" from Ballacroy, 
Then "Rory O'Moore" came thro' the door 
And pulled up Johannah Leary 
To dance that rale old Irish tune 
That's christened " Paddy Carey." 
She danced away for an hour or two, 
Waltz, Polkas and Squadreels, 
Ye'd a' cracked your sides, if ye'd seen them all 
A 
kicking up their heels, 
There was "Mary Jane" with her new delane 
And poor old "Nancy Barr" 
A. " jigging it" up and down the flare 
With " Pat of Mullinpr." 
After dancing, came the "(siting," 
Faith ' twas illegant to see 
Grady helping all the girls, 
And pouring out the tay, 
He laned across the table 
For to hand "Miss Rourke" the bread, 
When a "spud" came whizzing from behind, 
And struck him on the head. 
The row, it then began, 
Sure to stop 'em was no use. 
" 
Larry the slob" got a 
slap in the gob 
With a 
bran new roasted goose; 
Grady " tried to interfere," 
"I want this stopped," he said; 
When " two of 'em knocked the fiddler down 
And laid him out for dead. 
Sure there never was, or never will 
Be seen again a 
fight, 
As the one that happened at " Gra ly's" 
On that memorable night. 
Ten broken heads—six in their beds 
Summed up by Doctor Dee, 
Was the list of killed and wounded 
At poor Mike O'Grady's spree.

Good evening to ye's, one and all, 
I 
ask yer kind attintion, 
The subject of me song is one 
To you I'll now make mention. 
It's about a

Although it comes but once a

That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The drums will beat and the bands will play, 
As down the street we march away, 
That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
If you meet me on that day, 
You must not get offended, 
For what I 
say or do to you 
It never is intended. 
And whin I'm out upon parade, 
I 
leave all others in the shade, 
It's grand to see me in the Irish Brigade 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
The drums will beat, etc. 
YOUR MONEY IS YOUR FRIEND. 
By O
SCAR WILLis. 
Sung by ADA WRAY. 
YOU may talk your best of friends, but the only one to 
me 
Is the money in your pocket-
book as you can plainly see; 
For when a 
man is flush of cash, and money he can lend, 
He's courted by a 
score of men who claims to be his 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So never let yourself run short, 
And all your money spend, 
For when its known that you are broke, 
You haven't got a 
friend. 
If sickness lays a 
hold of you, and your purse it has run 
low, 
If you ask some one to wait on you, they do it very slow; 
But don't they go it with a 
rush when you've plenty cash 
to spend, 
What is it I 
can do for you, you know I 
am your friend. 
So never let yourself run short, ikc. 
So now pray all take my advice and never do get rash, 
But always try and manage to hold on to all your cash, 
For what I 
say you know is true, as through this world 
you wend, 
They all can say just what they may, but your money is 
your friend. 
So never let yourself run short, acc.

Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good nature mix'd together in abundance can be found. 
Where the boys are all so jolly, at a

The boys of dear Ould Ireland, my native land so green.

And be ready to assist yo']. if e'er you want a

If his cabin you should enter, you know as well as me; 
He'll treat you with the very best, quite welcome you will ne. 
He'll share his pipe and whiskey, your spirits h3 will cheer; 
Oh! ould Ireland you're mY darling, the spot I

For true hospitality, no matter w;iere l've been; 
There's no place like oulcl Ireland, my native lane so green. 
If e'er you're bent on p1.3asure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands, like those we have at home 
Killarney's lakes are beautlul, as every ne must own, 
And if your fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney Stone,

And don't look so forlorn, 
The harvest time is coming 
And I'm off to sheer the corn.

wouldn't have left Ireland, 
But times were hard, you know, 
To see the starving creatures, 
It would break the heart of stow,

My husband was killed in the war; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling rtgra; 
From the Goverment I 
receive a 
small pension, 
Which all my family does share; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears! 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
poor woman do; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash tub, 
The reason I'll tell now to you; 
I'm troubled bad with the Rheumatieks, 
And to put up with, many's the cares, 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry_ 
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy! 
Faith, he is a 
good Democrat! 
But they all do object to the children; 
To marry me, not one of them cares; 
SO I;11 let them all go to the diva, 
And stick to my apples and pears!

SUCH k 
NOSE. 
As sung with great success by Jolly Joe Banks. 
Good evening, pay attention, I'll now relate my, woes, 
I 
trust I 
shall succeed in making friends instead of foes, 
Gaze on a 
wretched mortal who, no matter where he goes, 
Is sure to hear some fellow cry " Oh, ain't he got a 
nose." 
Chorus. 
Oh, ain't he got a 
nose—such a 
nose, what a 
nose, 
Well it's not so handsome, I 
suppose, 
For whenever I 
go out, all the people roar and shout, 
"Oh, my goodness" gracious! what a 
nose, look at the 
I 
really can't make out why I 
was born with such a 
curse, 
For when some minutes old it was discovered by the 
nurse, 
That my eyes were like my daddy's, they were startled, I 
suppose, 
For she dropped me on the floor, and cried, " Oh, ain't he 
got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't he got, er.c. 
Oh, aint he got a 
nose, such a 
nose, what a 
nose, 
Won't it be ugly when he older grows, 
And whenever he goes out, all the boys,will bawl and 
shout : 
"Suffering Cornelius," what a 
nose, shoot the nose. 
When I 
was thirteen years of age, my friends sent me to 
school, 
I 
know l'm not to blame at all, for turning Out a 
fool, 
For when to say my lessons at the master's desk I 
rose, 
Every boy in school would shout "Oh, ain't he got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't he got, &c, 
Oh, ain't he got a 
afoot, such a 
snoot, what,a 
snoot— 
Did you over see such a 
dizzier galloot, 
And the little boys would cry, whenever I 
passes by. 
'Oh cheese it, " "stash it," "drop on• that-awful snoot," 
"bow yer snoot." 
87 
Then as I 
older grew I 
thought; I'd settle down for life, 
I 
expected that I'd found the girl that suited for a 
wife, 
I 
popped the question, blushing just as red as Any rose, 
When my charmer roared and giggled out, " Oh, ain't 
you got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't you got, 4.tc. 
Oh, ain't you got a 
smeller, what a 
smeller, such a 
smeller, 
It's the worst I 
ever saw on any feller, 
Go and bury it in a 
cellar, all the gang would shout and 
beller, 
Oh, hoist an umbrella over that nose, pipe the : 
nose: 
It's a 
very fearful thing for a 
chap to have it to say 
That no matter where he goes at all; his " bugle's' in the 
way," 
To the theatre I 
went the other night, the curtain had just 
arose, 
When a"god" in the gallery horlered out: " Oh, telescope 
that nose." 
Oh, ain't he got, etc-
Oh, ain't 1 
got a 
horn, " blow yer horn," " sound yer 
horn," 
often wish I 
never had been born 
But I'll try to do what's right, and come here some other 
night, 
And try to show you how I "sound my horn," sure's yer

HOME RULE. 
AS 
sang by JOHNNY ItoAcn. Composed by MART LEWIN. 
Copyright, 1875, by Jon Roebs. 
IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a

If you listeii unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of,-Mullingar.

S. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this Teri 
right, 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main. 
aktdstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to short 
for O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah M, &O.

Henry Grattan is his name and may Heaven be his sfa1n, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, Jr,o. 
• 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts. 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand. 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
e 
smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away ! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
Theyi've left their - 
hash to clme out and mash, when the Mar-
shal'gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to tile tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh ! don't their heartsgo pit-a 
pat, 
As Jach one lifts his hat, the lean as well aS fat, 
Says there's my-Dan, there goes my Pat; 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, ttc. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emeeald Hall, and an illegant supper 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for 
you, 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheeu for the boys of the Brani-
gans band;-
Oh! it's then we sung; and danced a 
reel; 
And ola how-good we .feel,- 
we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with: the Branigan's band.

Are flying side by side!

Shake from thy plumage the tears of the night, 
Haste where the splendors of morning invite; 
Soar where the sinless and beautiful stray, 
Tell them my Norah's as lovely as they.

The fairest e'er seen

In Erin the green. 
Greet, in thy rapture, you rose-scented dell, 
Deep in whose shadow my Norah doth dwell; 
liorah, as pure as the pearls on the thorn, 
Bright as the golden hair'd goddess of morn; 
She, from whose fairy-like fingers, the flow'rs 
Fall on the meadows in odorous show'rs. 
She's the:Lilly, & t.. 
E'en the bright shamrocks that bloom round thy bed, 
Tremble with joy at my Norah's soft tread. 
Mild as the moonbeam that falls on the stream, 
When at love's vespers, the glow-worm cloth gleam, 
Free from all guile, and unconscious of wrong, 
Simple and:sweet as thy silvery song. 
She's the Lilly, tie.

I'm sitting alone in a 
garret, 
While the sleet and the snow's falling down, 
Yet God knows I 
am hungry and dying, 
And Pm waiting for Jessie to come; 
I 
sent her out early this morning, 
To bring me some pennies or bread; 
But I 
think when my little one comes, 
She'll find that her mother is dead. 
CHORUS. 
I'm cold, and I'm hungry and helpless, 
And my loved one I'll never see more; 
For I'm dying alone in a 
garret, 
On a 
thin little Pallet of Straw. 
Would to God that my child had a 
father, 
Or some one to watch o'er her with care; 
Or some kind-hearted friend to protect her, 
Then I'd die with out sorrow or fear 
Should the storm keep my child from returning 
To her mother, so helpless and sore; 
Who is sitting alone in her garret, 
On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
Cuonus. 
I'm cold, and I'm hungry and helpless, 
Aild myloyed one-I'll ,never:see.more; 
For I'm dyingplone in a

On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
When I 
parted with Jessie this morning, 
She kissed me good-by, and she said: 
"I soon shall return, dearest mamma, 
Whether I 
get pennies or bread ;" 
But the night's,coming 
aud I'm weaker, 
And I 
think 
see Jessie no. more; 
For when she comes back she will find me 
Lying dead on my pallet of straw. 
She's parted from cold and from hunger, 
And her loved one she'll nevertsee more; 
For she's lying!deacl up in a

Tom Brown he is a 
married man, with children four or five; 
All day he's deep in business, and in life he seems to thrive; 
But when his daily toil is done, all round the streets he'll roam, 
And sometimes after midnight, you will find him rolling home. 
CHOZUS. 
When Brown comes rolling home, oh, then he's in his glory 
He loves to sing a 
song, or tell a 
jolly story; 
But there's a 
scolding wife, that waits for him alone; 
0, there's sure to be an awful row, when ,Brown comes rolling 
home! 
He circumvents the excise law upon the Sabbath day, 
And drinks his beer with right good cheer, no matter what they 
say; 
He loves a 
schooner, tall and deep, with no great wealth of 
foam; 
A 
few of these are sure to please and send him rolling home! 
When Brown comes, &c. 
At night he wakes his neighbors up, when pounding at the 
door; 
Sometimes its two, sometimes its three, and often after four; 
And where he stays till such an hour, the fact is never known, 
He says " it's business" all the time, that sends him rolling 
home! 
When Brown comes, R. 
0'0 
He drinks a 
keg of lager bier, he quaffs the wine of Mumm! 
And if he stands without support, he's slightly out of plumb; 
But Brown heeds not his wavering steps, he cries out " Come 
boys, come! 
" 
We'll take a 
drink, a 
social drink, then I'll go rolling home 
When Brown comes, &c.

AT DELANEY, 
Sung by JOHN SCANLAN, the rising comique, with tremendoul 
applause. 
Air.—" Eileen Alanna." 
My name is Pat Delaney, I 
came from Tralee, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house, way up in Avenue 0; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
terrible roar, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I 
get home at night, boys, I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong, 
I'd- go and see the judge, and have him push their case quite 
strong. 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their atigus asthore.

Music published by JouN Pcizitv, Washington St., opposite Boston 
Tilegre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on tile stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely .find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife: 
There-came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going; 
to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly .jammed; 
All awaited' a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till -their sides,would ache 
Andthey long'd for the- curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins'to make his-first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to: make his ,first entrance, and then 
To give-him a 
cheerful hi! hi I 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Vhy,'Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A 
hiss I -yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk I". some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
.To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
' 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very -slow, 
And, " Ledies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's notAhe'lleart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night rve made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well Stand; 
And every, effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
Pee a 
tittle one dying at home I"

OLD Uncle Pete got full, last night, 
Looking out the w

This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see :— 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray mag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
flop along; Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along. 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in the pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice. 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull-frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his faze. 
Coon up 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally in de garaen, lifting p'eas, 
Come and kiss me, if you please,

No longer single stay. 
But where there are so many, 
It is difficult to choose, 
Some may have other fish to fry, 
And therefore me refuse.

CHORDS. 
He must be neat, he must be sweet, 
His brains in his head must be; 
He must not stare at girls, 
Whene'er he walks abroad with me! 
He must not drink, he must not think 
When I 
speak, to make reply; 
Work ev'ry day, give me his pay; 
None other need apply! 
I 
fancy that with such a 
one, 
Life would a 
pleasure be; 
But where to find just such a 
man, 
Is what perplexes me; 
Perhaps he may be in the throng 
Collected here to night; 
If so, I 
hope he'll step right up, 
I'll make the rest all right.

pearing to the beat advantage, whether in person or dress, this book par-

sought after by the opposite sex. To those to whom Nature has been 
more liberal, attentions to the suggestions laid down here will so en-
hance their charms as to make them dangerously fascinating and sur-
passingly beautiful

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 Nas-

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus op, randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
