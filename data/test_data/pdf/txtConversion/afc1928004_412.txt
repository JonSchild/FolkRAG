,:ntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1R7S, by A. J. 
lfZSEIER. :n 
the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
The subject of this sketch was born in the city of New Lon.. 
don, Conn., on the uth of February, r854. 
When quite 
young he entered the clothing house of Shepard & Harris, of 
that city, as a 
clerk, but soon turned his attention to the 
practical branch of the business and learned the trade of a 
clothing cutter. 
During all this time he was singing tenor in. 
the Episcopal Church of that city ; and was there met by 
Prof. G. W. Ryder, of the Ryder Swiss Bell- Ringers, in the fall 
of 1870, from whom he accepted an engagement as a 
tenor 
balladist. 
He traveled with this company for two seasons, 
during the latter part of which he changed his business to that 
of a 
genteel comic, sensational, and motto vocalist. 
After 
closing with the Ryders, . he traveled one season through. 
variety theaters, then joined the Spaulding Bell- Ringers for 
,s 
one season ; and then E. S. Washburn's Last Sensation for 
two seasons. 
From there he went West under an engage-
ment to the Peak Family ; he stayed with them one sea-
son, and during the last summer had charge of the concert 
with Burr Robbins' circus. 
At the close of their season in Oc-
tober he came East and joined the Ryder Bell- Ringers for the 
season of ' 78 and ' 79. 
And now, in presenting to ihe public 
this collection of songs I 
am actuated by a 
desire to further 
please those who, I 
trust have been already- entertained by 
hearing a 
portion of them from the lips of their humble ser-
1' 
vant. 
If I 
succeed in affording only a 
few moment's innocent 
amusement, to each of my kind patrons, they vill in the ag-
gregate amount to years of pleasure, and I 
shall have accom-
plished a 
great object. 
Thanking the public for their many 
favors in the past, and hoping to merit them in the future,

America's Own Coniique. 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor; 
How lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience voice adaptly smother, 
But oh how harshly we review 
The self same errors in another. 
CHORUS. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor. 
And when you meet an erring one 
Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast the stone, 
If you yourself be pure and faultless. 
Or list to that small voice within, 
Whose whisp'rings oft make men confounded, 
And trumpet not another's sin, 
You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 
Let each man, &c. • 
Or in self-judgment, if you find 
Your deeds to others are superior, 
To you has Providence been kind, 
As you should be to those inferior. 
Example sheds a 
genial ray 
Of light that men are apt to borrow, 
So first improve yourself to-day, 
..-knd then improve your friends to-morrow

Our Baby. 
Written expressly for, and copyrighted by, Ion Bat/watt. 
At our house we've got a 
baby, 
Such a 
brat I 
ne'er did see, 
Looks just like a 
par-boiled lobster, 
And they say it looks like me. 
One eye looks up to the ceiling, 
T'other down toward the floor; 
Nose looks like a 
chunk of putty 
Thrown against the cellar door. 
Head is like it squash or pumpkin, 
Or more like a 
billiard ball, 
And it has no place, by golly ! 
Where to hitch a 
waterfall. 
Lord ! but can't it squall and holler ! 
There it goes, as sure's yOu're born. 
Guess it's got wind on the stomach— 
I 
must now be gone, be gone. 
ENCORE. 
My ma says you must be quiet, 
Or you'll wake the " cherub " up. 
" 
Cherub !" ugh ! 
It looks by far more 
Like a 
monkey or a 
pup !

The Valley of Chamouni. 
Sung by Miss IDA BRUNIMELL. 
When the heart in golden fancies 
To the sway of happiest dreams, 
Back to scenes of beauty glances, 
Lit by mem'ry's brightest beams, 
Then I 
see that vale of fountains, 
Where the Alp flow'rs woo the gale, 
Under all the snow-crown'd mountains, 
Shining o'er that beauteous vale 
C'HoRus. 
Oh ! Chamouni, sweet Chamouni, 
Oh ! the vale of Chamouni, 
Oh ! Chamouni, sweet Chamouni, 
Oh ! Chamouni's sweet vale. 
When I 
hear the Alp horn ringing, 
When Mont Blanc foretells the day ; 
And the breeze of morning bringing 
Mountain chime and mountain lay— 
Then once more with rapture glowing, 
All that mountain land I 
hail, 
But my heart, with joy o'erflowing, 
Lingers in that beauteous vale. 
Oh ! Chamouni, 
Song of ye Olden Times. 
As sung by HARRY BECKWITH in his great character of 4• 
Miss Lucretia 
Cherebro," the eccentric old maid of thirty. 
As I 
look around about, 
My head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see this world so greatly changed 
Since I 
was but a 
girl. 
Old notions, out of date, 
They're all made over new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, times are ;.hanged about, 
And everything goes—askew ; 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
Once on a 
time young men 
Were steady and upright, 
But now in sporting spend their time, 
And in it much delight ; 
They drive about fast teams., 
On the governor's money, too ; 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how 
They do it, but—they do. 
Yes, times are changed, & c. 
V6ung ladies now are not 
Like those I 
used to know; 
When I 
was young we waited 
Till sought after by a 
beau. 
But now things are reversed 
And going all—askew: 
T 
don't know how they do it, 
But— they do. 
Yes, times are changed, & c.

Now, here I 
am, and don't you see 
What a 
fine young man I 
am? 
And where I 
came from, do you know ? 
I 
came from Ballymyan. 
My mother she was beautiful, 
My father a 
fine old man"; 
Sure an ugly person never came 
From my own dear Ballymyan. 
CHORU S. 
0 Ballymyan, dear Ballymyan, 
My own dear 41allymyan! 
Nly own dear, darling country, 
And my own dear native land. 
I 
am the only boy they had, 
And a 
beautiful boy I 
am— 
The girls' own darling, charming lad, 
That came from Ballymyan.; 
My eyes are like the vvashing.blue, 
My mouth is like a 
clam— 
Could such a 
beauty e'er be found 
Except in Ballymyan ? 
0 Ballymyan, &c. 
Well, I 
am five and forty now, 
A 
single man I 
am, 
And how it ever came to be, 
Just go ask Mary Ann; 
We sparked just four years and a 
half, 
And a 
sparking man I 
am; 
The style of sparking that I 
like 
Is the style of Ballymyan. 
0 Ballymyan, &c. 
To bring my story to an end— 
It soon can now be told— 
Another fellow married her, 
And she left me in the cold 
And the only comfort I 
can take, 
When I 
think of Mary Ann, 
Is that the false one never came 
Vrom my on dear Ballymyan. 
0 Ballymyan, &c. 
Darby, Dear. 
AS 
sung by Miss IDA BRUMMELL, in HARRY BECKWITH'S original musical 
sketch, " Irish Love—Making." 
t0h, Darby, dear, while leave me pining. 
All lonely waiting here for you, 
While the stars above are brightly- shining, 
Because they've nothing else to do. 
rhe pretty flowers lay nope and keeping. 
To try and rival blush with you; 
But old mother Nature set them sleeping. 
With their 
faces washed with dew. 
t.)h, Darby, dear, why leave me pining, 
All lonely waiting here for you, 
While the stars are brightly shining., 
As if they'd nothing else to do? 
Darliy, dear. 
Darby, dear. 
An Impossibility. 
Adapted and sung by H ARRY 13vc KWITH. 
I've been thinking, I've been thinking 
What a 
glorious world were this 
Did folks mind their business more, 
And mind their neighbors' less. 
For instance, you and I, my friends, 
Arc sadly prone to talk 
Of matters that concern us not, 
And others' follies mock. 
I've been thinking if we'd begin 
To mind our own affairs 
That possibly our neighbors might 
Contrive to manage theirs. 
We've faults enough at home to mend, 
It may be so with others ; 
It would seem strange if it were not, 
Since all mankind arc brothers. 
Oh, would that we had charity 
For every man and woman; 
Forgiveness is the work of those 
Who know " to err is human." 
Then let us banish jealousy, 
Let's help our fallen brother; 
And as we journey down life's road 
Do good to one another. 
When Grandmama is Gone. 
Sung by M ISS IDA BRUMMELL. 
In her old arm chair she's sitting, 
As in years of long ago; 
She is knitting, knitting, knitting, 
Gently rocking to and fro, 
And a 
darkened thought steals o'er me, 
Like the shadows on the lawn, 
Of the lonely days before me 
After grandmama is gone. 
CHORUS 
Oh ! when grandmama is gone, 
When grandma= is gone, 
And her prayers and tears and toils for us are o'er, 
Who will cheer us day by day 
All along our pilgrim way, 
To the beautiful, the ever shining shore, 
Years ago a 
dear companion 
Promised her, a 
blushing bride, 
To protect, to love and cherish, 
E'en till death should them divide. 
O'er a 
low mound ' neath the willow, 
Summer roses long have blown ; 
They will blow above another 
After grandma= is gone. 
Neith the hill the sun is sitting, 
And the twilight shadows come; 
Still she's waiting, waiting, waiting, 
Till her Master calls her home ; 
And I 
weep for friends departing, 
While they're going one by one; 
shall have one more in heaven • 
' 
After grandmama is gone. 
As sung by HARRY BECKWITH in his original operatic sketch, " Just Isy 
Chance." 
I 
never loved till I 
saw you, 
No fickle heart have I; 
I've seen the sights of many lands, 
I've wandered far and nigh. 
I've never been so wild but that 
From vice I've kept me free; 
My love for you is pure and strong, 
My heart has room for thee. 
My heart has room, my heart has room for thee 
I've seen bright eyes in stranger climes. 
I've heard sweet words divine, 
I've looked upon their beauty oft, 
But none I've seen like thine. 
Came, say that you will be my love, 
Say that ray bride you'll be; 
Tn years to come you'll find that yet 
My heart has room for thee, 
My heart has room, my heart has room for thee. 
As sung by Miss IDA BRUMMELL and HARRY BECKWITH in his original 
musical sketch, " Irish Love-Making." 
You're looking as bright as the morn, darling 
You're looking as bright as the day; 
And while on your charms I'm dilating 
You're stealing my poor heart away. 
But keep it and welcome, mavourneen, 
It's a 
loss I'm not going to mourn; 
Sure one heart's enough for a 
body, 
Then, pray, give me yours in return. 
CHORUS. 
HE. 
Mavourneen! 
SHE. 
Oh, leave me! 
HE. 
Then, pray, give me yours in return. 
a-ether. 
SHE. 
I 
can't give you mine in return. 
Ah! you're smiling, and that's a 
good sign, darling, 
Say yes, and you'll never repent; 
Or, if you had rather be silent, 
Your silence I'll take for consent. 
Now, that good-natured dimple's a 
tell-tale, 
And all that I 
have is your own; 
This week you may be Kitty Tibbell, 
Next week you'll be Mistress Malone.

Oh! Joe. 
Sung by H ARRY BV.CKWItn. 
I courted last summer a 
charming young girl, 
With beautiful bright auburn hair, 
lie lips were like rubies, her teeth were like pearl, 
Her cheeks were both rosy and fair; 
We met every evening just outside her house, 
She never would go far away, 
And if I 
detain'd her a 
moment past ten, 
She'd get very nervous and say— 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Joe, do let me go, you'd keep me all night ilea', 
What makes you do so? 
It's time I 
was in, I 
shall catch it I 
know, 
I 
can hear mother calling, so do let me go. 
Of course when she made such a 
bother as this, 
I'd caress her, and say, dear Maria, 
Just give me a 
squeeze and a 
dear little kiss, 
And then I 
will let you retire. 
But instead of her beautiful lips meeting mine, 
She'd turn them completely away, 
And if I 
attempted to squeeze her the least, 
Again she would nervously say— 
Oh! Joe, Sze. 
Each evening, as usual, I'd visit my dear, 
And meet with about the same fate, 
Let me try as I 
may, she was always in fear 
Of being one moment too late. 
If I 
put back my watch and told her the wrong time, 
And to keep her still longer would try. 
Some tale-telling church clock the hour would chime, 
When in her old fashion she'd cry— 
Oh, Joe, 
At last I 
determined the question to pop, 
And asked her to be mine for life ; 
She hung down her head and blushingly said, 
Dear Joe, I'm already a 
wife. 
I 
felt quite amazed, and asked her to explain, 
She said there is no time to stay, 
And at that very instant the clock it struck ten, 
And still she continued to say— 
Oh! Joe, & c.

Oh, Cupid, be My Friend. 
As sung by Misc IDA BRUMMELL in H ARRY BF:extern-es original operatic 
sketch, " Just by Chance." 
AIR: " Happy Moments " 
I 
am a 
maid, alone and sad, 
I 
have no one to cheer; 
I 
would I 
had a 
lover true, 
I 
would I 
had one here. 
Oh, Fortune, turn your wheel for me -. 
A 
loving prize, oh, send ; 
A 
lonely maiden calls to thee— 
Oh, Cupid, be my friend. 
A 
lonely maiden calls to thee— 
Oh, Cupid, be my friend. 
They say I've beauty, grace an 
And look just like a 
queen ; 
But what of that, if I've no king 
To make my life serene ? 
Oh, give me not such gifts as th , 
That don't to love extend ; 
But send a 
loving heart to me— 
Oh, Cupid, be my friend. 
But send a 
loving heart to me— 
Oh, Cup;d, be my friend.

The Bold Vigherilian. 
As sung by HARRY BECKWITH in his great specialty, " A Visit with 
Humpty Dumpty." 
There once was a 
bold fisherman, 
Who sailed forth from Billingsgate, 
To catch the mild bloater 
And the gay mackerel. 
But when he arrove off Pimlico, 
The wind it did begin to blow, 
And his little boat it wibble wobbled 
That slick overboard he fell. 
CHORUS. 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle duns, 
That's the highly interesting song he sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum. 
Oh the bold fisherman. 
First he wriggled, then he striggled 
In the water so briny, 
He bellowed and he yellowed 
Out for help, but in vain ; 
Then down did he gently glide 
To the bottom of the silv'ry tide, 
But previously to that he cried, 
" 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
SPOKEN—On arriving at the terra firma at the bottom of the 
aqua pura, he took a 
cough lozenge, and murmured— 
ankle doodle, & c. 
His ghost walked that night 
To the bedside of his Mary Jane. 
He told her how dead he was ; 
Then says she, " I'll go mad," 
" 
For since my love's dead," says she, 
" 
All joy from me's fled," says she, 
" 
I'll go a 
raving luniack," says she— 
And she went, very bad. 
SPOKEN— She thereupon tore her best chignon to smither-
eens. danced the " Can Can " on top of the water-butt, and 
"joined the woman's rights 
association," and frequently 
edifies the angelic members by softly chanting— 
Dinkle doodle, & c: 
Yankee Sleigh Ride. 
As Sung by H ARRY BECKWITH. 
Kind friends, I've had but one sleigh ride this year, 
And I 
came within one of not being here; 
The facts I'll relate as well as I 
can remember, 
It happened about the middle of December. 
Ri-tu-ri-to, &c. 
The load was composed of both gals and boys, 
And each one tried to outdo the other in noise, 
And the way we guarded against cold weather 
We sat spoon fashion, all on us together. 
When our load was made up, and all was completed, 
On the knees of a 
fellow I 
found myself seated ; 
When into my lap most unceremoniously blundered 
A 
female whose weight was no less than ten hundred. 
Says I, dearest madam get off from my hips, 
For I 
found myself in a 
total eclipse 
But she sat perfectly still and wouldn't move a 
darn peg; 
Says I, Oh, Gewhitiker I 
get off my leg. 
We were going at the rate of ten miles an hour— 
When my leg was retieved I 
hadn't no power, 
But I 
couldn't help laughing at the chap in the rear 
Who kept squirming and lusting, Oh Lord! Oh, dear. 
But soon we came to a 
sudden conclusion, 
And found ourselves in a 
pesky confusion; 
In turning a 
corner we got tipped in the snow, 
Without asking the drives whether we ought to or no. 
Says I, Mr. Driver how much is to pay? 
For I'm darned if you catch me again in that sleigh, 
Says he, five dollars. 
Now don't you enlarge it, 
And when you get home don't forget for to charge it. 
Then away they went and left me alone; 
It was sweet consolation to buff it back home, 
For the road it was crooked but I 
cyphered to walk it, 
For I 
pulled out a 
bottle I 
had in my pocket,

The Brooklyn Theatre Fire. 
Written, adapted and sung by JIM CAMPBELL. 
Published by 1lArD:Nc. 
I sing a tale of misery, of terror, and of death, 
That makes this life a 
burden to the ones in sorrow left, 
That sent thro' many a 
household sore misfortune, swift and 
dire, 
Of the dead and living heroes of that fearful Brooklyn Fire. 
The horrors of that awful night no tongue can ever tell, 
Of the tender and the loving—how they strove and how they 
fell ; 
The baby in the mother's arms, the lover and the bride, 
And brothers, sisters, fathers, all despairing, side by side. 
All honor to the noble ones who strove to save the rest, 
Who when their own lives were at stake—sweet pity filled 
each breast— 
While round them roared the hungry flames they nobly stood 
their ground, 
And terror-stricken mortals gazed upon them all around. 
Such times as these call forth great souls when the timid 
shrink away, 
They rise up in their majesty and danger put away; 
The country that produces such their names should shout 
aloud, 
For of such heroes any land may justly well be proud. 
An when posterity shall yet her greatest names enroll 
In lines of glorious splendor or Fame's immortal scroll, 
Arrayed in dazzling brightness without a 
stain to mar, 
There " Murdoch" and brave " Burroughs" too will glisten 
like a 
star. 
Our country 's known some glorious deaths that made our 
heart's blood freeze, 
Our soldiers at the cannon's mouth, our sailors on the seas ; 
But Fame's bright scroll, all glittering o'er, no prouder names 
can boast 
Than " Murdoch
"  and brave " -Burroughs " too, who died

Your'e my darling, 
The sweet quintessence, 
And in whose presence 
My heart with rapture swells and beats. 
Are you sure, sir, 
That it will last so, 
Nor cease to grow so— 
That you will not tire and from me then retreat, 
That you will never retreat ? 
Cease your doubting; why this pouting ? 
What should cause such jealous sproutini, ? 
'Tis a 
feeling that comes stealing 
O'er my mind—a

You're my darling;

GEO. —..I've been knocking at that confounded door for nearly 
half an hour, and as no one seemed to hear me, I 
thought that 
I 
would venture in on my own accord. (Looks around.) Surely 
this must be the place. 
It looks the same as it did three years 
ago. 
(Seats himself at table.) I 
wonder if 
Charley is home. 
He must have received my letter. 
The place seems very lone-
some. I 
will try and see if I 
can find some way to amuse my-
self until he comes. (Goes toward door as Gretchen enters. Both 
knock against each other.) 
Well, I 
declare, if 
this isn't impu-
dence. 
GRETCHEN.—Vat you vant here ?

GRETCHEN.—My

GEO.—Very good, indeed, Gretchen. 
CHAS.—(Amming his own voice) You seem to like the fun, 
George. 
So you see, I 
have surprised you after all. 
Now, 
George, you must never think yourself too smart for me. 
GEO.—Well, upon my word, Charlie, this is indeed a 
treat 
and a 
surprise, both. 
CHAS.—( To audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, we hope we 
have amused you with our little sketch, and also hope that at 
some future day we may again have the honor to appear before 
you. 
We hope that you all will not forget this, our little sketch 
of a 
cousin's surprise.

Duo: Sung by Miss JENNIE RAY and HARRY BECKWITH in Ilk original 
Irish sketch, " Money vs. Love." 
Barney, darling, do not leave me, 
Do not leave your Mollie dear; 
She loves no other, Barney, darling, 
Say you will not leave me here. 
If I 
ever spoke a 
harsh word, 
Mollie, surely you'll forgive ; 
But the kiss I 
ask for, darling, 
To me you must freely give. 
Won't you tell me, Mollie, darling, 
While I 
hold your hand in mine, 
That you will never love another. 
And thro'Iife you will be mine ? 
Yes. ' Twas wrong for me to trifle 
With a 
heart so good and true; 
While the stars in 1-leaven are shining 
Here I 
pledge my love to you. 
Style is what Catches the Girls.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York, 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Behold a 
young man with a 
weakness for dress— 
I 
trust you won't say that I 
go to excess— 
The latest thing out is my passion to wear; 
I'm envied by gents, and ador'd by the fair! 
Out of the fashion, you're out of the world ; 
Society's pleasures away from you whirl'd, 
At last, tho' not least, now in spite of the churls, 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, style is what catches the girls ! 
Talk about diamonds and pearls ! 
They won't go a 
mile unless you're in style, 
And style is what catches the girls. 
The darlings exclaim as I 
pass down the street : 
" 
Oh ! isn't he ravishing, heavenly sweet !" 
I 
pass by them slowly with such nonchalance, 
And see them upon me admiringly glance; 
A 
prince in his carriage could ne'er hope to see 
The sweet admiration bestowed upon me ! 
They smile and they whisper, and shake out their curls. 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Ves, style is, S:c. 
Now, not being wealthy, to keep up this pace. 
Adversity often allows me no grace ; 
My chances, sometimes, they are terribly slim. 
But I 
keep my head up, it is sink or to swim ! 
Some maiden of wealth will yet sweet upon me; 
How can they resist when their eyes plainly see 
An Adonis in form, fashion, moustache and curls 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Yes, style is, &e,

Measure Your Wants by Your Means. 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
I 
once heard a 
proverb, worth 'graving in gold, 
'Twas spoken in years that are past, 
And he too is gone who made it his own, 
But while there's a 
world it will last. 
The saying was pithy, its meaning was this; 
Which ever way Providence leans, 
If what fortune grants won't come up to your wants, 
You must bring down your wants to your means. 
CHORUS. 
So think of my song as you journey along, 
Thro' life and its changeable scenes, 
If your wants prove too high for your means to supply, 
Why bring down your wants to your means. 
How often we see the gay man of the world, 
With money and plenty to spare, 
Did he use it aright, but he puts it to flight, 
And appears as tho' short of his share, 
Then he pays twenty shillings to borrow a 
pound, 
Till his folly no longer he screens, 
Thus he parts with his wealth, loses station and health, 
Thro' his wants overrunning his means. 
So think of my song, & c. 
The roughlianded ploughman, up early and late, 
Whose days with hard toil are beset, 
If he's scanty of clothes, it is nothing he owes, 
So he's richer than him who's in debt. 
For if homely his fare, he is happy withal, 
Tho' it's little from learning he gleans, 
And he never needs run from a 
bailiff or dun, 
For he measures his wants by his means. 
So think of my song, &c. 
Then ye who have little, and ye who have much, 
Enjoy what you've got in content; 
Nor squander your store and your health getting more; 
Live right, and you'll never repent. 
This world is a 
garden with pleasure well tilled 
Tho' sorrow sometimes intervenes, 
But troubles will fly, as the clouds drifting by, 
If you " measure your wants by your means." 
So think of my song, &e,

Your Pocket Book is Your Best Friend. 
_ , 
Words and music written for HARRY BECCKWITH by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
As you pass day by day thro' life's crowded highway 
You will find it is hard to succeed; 
There'll be many a 
time, as the hillside you climb, 
When you'll wish for a 
friend in your need. 
For this troublesome life it is only a 
strife 
As to who shall rise up or descend; 
If a 
man is not blind he will very soon find 
That his pocketbook is his best friend. 
ClIORLTS. 
Yes, a 
friend in our need is a 
true friend indeed, 
Upon this you may truly depend; 
And to give, or to lend, or to beg, borrow, spend, 
A 
man's pocketbook is his best friend. 
There are friends you deem true they will linger near you 
In the smiles of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day they will vanish away 
Like the fading of sweet summer flowers. 
As you wander alone, quite forgotten, unknown, 
And misfortunes upon you descend, 
In that sorrowful day you'll be quite apt to say— 
Yes, my pocketbook was their best friend. 
Yes, a 
friend in our, & c. 
You may be very poor, so you cannot secure 
What you need for the loved ones at home; 
For their wants to provide to beg you decide, 
As you out in the dreary street wan. 
There some old friend you meet and your story repeat, 
Not a 
dollar he'll give you or lend; 
And you say with a 
sigh, as he passes you by, 
Yes, his pocketbook is his best friend. 
Yes, a 
friend in our, & c.

Never Venture, Never Win. 
Sung- by HARRY BECK WITH. 
Written by Jos. P. SKELLY. 
There's a 
maxim to remember 
If in life you would succeed ; 
It is very plain and simple, 
It will serve you as a 
creed: 
If your courage should desert you, 
And you feel your hopes grow dim, 
Bear in mind this little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
CHORTJS. 
On, on, on, and never be afraid, boys; 
On, on, on, with courage as your aid, boys; 
Try for the best, keep a 
cheerful heart within, 
Bear in mind this little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
When our fathers fought for freedom— 
And that boon was long denied— 
They beheld their foes retreating, 
And with death were satistied; 
They were true, and never weakened 
In the battle's wildest din, 
For they knew that little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
On, on, on, & c., 
When the lover sues for kisses, 
And the sweetheart is unkind, 
Don't depend upon her answer 
If she seems the least inclined ; 
She may say that you are naughty, 
And that kissing is a 
sin ; 
But you know she never means it— 
If you venture you will win. 
On, on, on, ezc., 
After Twelve O'Clock. 
I'm thinking now of one dark night, 
I 
rambled on the street ; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright, 
The police on their beat. 
Should I 
relate just all I 
saw, 
. Perchance your nerves I'd shock, 
For fearful are the sights Ne see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
CHORUS. 
Come, roam the city round with me, 
Perhaps your nerves ' twill shock, 
For fearful are the sights you see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
Now first I 
saw a 
lab'ring men, 
While passing through a 
lane; 
His wages he was giving fast 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, though she was starv'd, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
lust after twelve o'clock. 
Come, roam &c. 
And then there was another scene, 
I 
think it has been told, 
I 
saw a 
man escape from jail, 
The guard was bought with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock; 
And who can tell where this man went 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, &c, 
Now soon I 
reached the river's side, 
And paused there for a 
rest ; 
'Twas there I 
saw a 
poor young girl, 
Her babe clasped to her breast: 
Her marriage was a 
mockery— 
She jumped out from the dock— 
A 
shriek ! a 
splash ! th , waves rolled on, 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, &c,

Jonathan Joseph Jeremiah. 
Some men are so anxious for honor and fame, 
They'll work for a 
lifetime in making a 
name; 
But too much of a 
name is a 
possible thing, 
As you'll say when yon've heard what I'm going to sing. 
My father and mother were excellent folks, 
But both had a 
weakness for practical jokes; 
So when I 
was born they were both of one mind, 
And said I 
should have all the names I 
could find. 
CIIORUs. 
Jonathan, Joseph, Jeremiah, Timothy, Titus, Obadiah; 
William, Henry, Walter, Sim, Reuben, Rufus, Solomon, Jim; 
Nathaniel, Daniel, Abraham, Roderick, Frederick, Peter, Sam; 
Simon, Timon, Nicholas, Pat, Christopher, Dick, Jehosophat. 
I 
was sent to be christen'd before I 
could speak, 
So I 
couldn't object to this curious freak ; 
There were two other youngsters that morning as well, 
But for these poor children it turn'd out a- sell ! 
When the clergyman came I 
was first of the three, 
So of course he commenced operations on me. 
And it took him so long all my titles to call, 
The other two babies gut no names at all. 
Jonathan, Joseph, &c. 
When I 
went to be married the case was as bad, 
The parson stared at me and thought I 
was mad. 
However, he started, but found very soon 
The task was too great to be finished by noon; 
So he said, " My dear sir, it's a 
very great shame 
Your parents denied you a 
sehsible name; 
But thro' this strange freak without reason or rhyme, 
You'll have to be married a 
bit at a 
time." 
Jonathan, Joseph, &c. 
It appears that a 
gipsy a 
year or two since 
Told my wife that some day she would marry a 
prince 
With a 
long roll of titles, and she woule be bless'd 
With a 
boy for each name that her husband possess'd! 
She often declares that the prophecy's right, 
But I 
am no prince, so I 
don't see it quite; 
For if the last part of it ever comes true, 
I'm sure I 
don't know what on earth I 
shall do. 
Jonathan, Joseph, & e,

We'll all get Jolly as the Night Wears On. 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
crown, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily sing— 
CHORUS. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and bid dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shout, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy pub. 
And drown all your cares in a 
glass; 
Let squeamish teetot'lers drink coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coppers they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, and tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till I'm laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And then as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
To fall deep in love with a 
sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
But the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
Has no great attraction for me; 
At young Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll stick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And gaily I'll sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, & c.

Never Lose Your Head. 
Last Monday night I 
went to dine with my friend, Mister 
Brown; 
While running thro' the' sloppy streets I 
clumsily tumbled 
down ; 
I 
heard a 
click upon the paves, it was too dark to see, 
But when I 
got to Brown's I 
found that I'd lost my latch-
key. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, it really was the fact, I'd lost my latch-key. 
I 
determined to tell Brown about it but forgot. 
CHORUS. 
SO 
I 
first did lose my / atch-key, 
And through this I 
lost ray bed, 
But through all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
At dinner I 
sat next a 
charming lady dressed 
i
n blue; 
She really was 
so beautiful, and so amusing, too, 
That when the hostess gave the sign for the ladies to depart 
I 
found to my astonishment that I 
had lost my heart. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there was no doubt about it, I 
had lost my 
heart! 
I 
couldn't talk to Brown, I 
thoroughly disliked 
Brown; and when he ordered up another bottle of claret I 
felt as though I 
could have strangled him. 
And so I 
lost my heart, 
Besides my latch- key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
When we had drank up all the wine we to the drawing-room 
went, 
And while my charmer sang a 
song, I 
o'er the music bent ; 
When leaning down quite close, to hear the words which she 
did say, 
The candle caught my whiskers, and burnt them quite away, 
have the oth er 
off to 
keep my balance, 
•rorronm.r., 
SPOKEN— Yes, it caught my l
ef
t-hand whisker, so I 
had 
no 
31 
So I 
lost my whiskers and my heart, 
My latch- key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
bade good-night at 12 o'clock, and when out in the street 
I 
felt myself borne up aloft, in fact right off my feet; 
The last thing that I 
heard was some one utter a 
loud curse, 
And when I'd got my senses back I 
found I'd lost my purse. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I 
was robbed—robbed just outside Brown's, 
too. 
He had gone to bed, as there were no lights in the 
windows, and no police, as usual, were to be seen. 
So I 
lost my purse, my whiskers, heart, 
My latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
wander'd 'bout the streets all night, because I 
had no tin, 
I 
tried in vain to get a 
bed—folks wouldn't let me in ; 
I 
heard the clocks strike r 
and 2 
and 3 
and 4 
and 5, 
And got back to my lodgings feeling more dead than alive. 
SPOKEN—Yes, caught an awful cold, too, which, now that 
it has left me, has taken all my voice away. 
So I 
lost my voice, my purse, my whisker:-,, 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
My song is done. and I 
have only just one word to say, 
Of good advice to give my friends before you go away— 
Into whate'er predicaments your person may be led, 
Lose everything you may possess, but never lose your head. 
SPOKEN—Yes, it is a 
matter of great consolation to me to 
think that 
Altho' I 
lost my voice, purse, whiskers, 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
Yet thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
Young Kitty lov'd dearly her Thomas, 
She loved him with all her true heart; 
But Kitty, I 
fear, had a 
temper, 
And was sometimes what people call " tart." 
She used to find fault with poor Thomas so much, 
And never would leave him alone, 
She always was at him whatever he did, 
Till Thomas, despairing, would groan. 
Ciro. For he must not do this and he must not do that, 
Till Thomas got quite in a 
stew, 
For he might not do that and he might not do this 
Till he did not know what he might do. 
By appointment he met her one evening, 
She said he had come much toe soon. 
She would not stay out o'er five minutes 
On account of there being no moon.' 
Ile bade her good night at the small garden gate, 
And was just ' bout to give her a 
kiss. 
When she drew herself up and said, " Thomas ! 
Remember you must not do this !"( 
Ciro.) 
Tie met her again by appointment,  
The hour arrang'd on was eight, 
He was there quite ten minutes before that , 
She said he was half sn hour late! 
The moon was not up and yet she stayed out, 
At parting lie took off his hat, 
When she drew herself up and said " Thomas ! 
Remember you must not do that !" (Clic) 
So Thomas then said, " My dear Kitty, 
I 
do not know what I'm to do, 
For I 
must not do this, and I 
must not do that, 
And I 
only want, love, to please you." 
Sweet Kitty replied, " When I 
tell you, dear Tom, 
That you must not do that or do this— 
Just mind do the reverse, and you'll please me the best— 
You must not now give me a 
kiss." 
Ciro. But he gave her a 
kiss, aye, and half a 
score more, 
And he now finds it is the best plan, 
When he must not do this and he must not do that 
To do it once like a 
man.

OLD GRIMES' CELLAR DOOR, 
HOW oft we talk of childhood joys, 
Of tricks we used to play. 
While playing hookey from the school,

For those bright days of yore, 
When Sally Brown and I

While others used to stray; 
Down on the docks where sugar casks, 
In rows together lay; 
But Sal and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us of yore; 
And side by side together slide 
Down 0141 Grimes' Cellar Door. 
Oh ! I

change came o'er the scene, 
NVhen poor old Grimesy died; 
His son removed the cellar door, 
On which we used to slide. 
Our mothers they were glad of it, 
For our pantaloons we tore; 
They had to be half-soled and heeled, 
From sliding on the door. 
Oh ! I 
would, 
C. 
One day the old man fell asleep, 
Upon his cellar door; 
The boys all came to take a 
peep, 
And hear him loudly snore; 
They tickled his nose with feather and straw 
And laughed till their sides were sore, 
The old man awoke with a 
loud haw ! haw ! 
And slid down on his own cellar door.

DON'T LEAVE GRANDMOTHER, NOW 
SHE'S OLD. 
COMPANION TO GRANDFATHER'S OLD ARM- CHAIR. 
Music Published by W HITE, Smrrn ..t.; CO., Boston, Mass. 
Price, 35 cents. 
Sung by J. W. GRIFFEN, with fourteen encores. 
The white apple blossoms are falling in showers, 
The rose bushes bloom in the sweet summer air; 
Dijoying the cal it of the bright sunny hours, 
Grandinothsr sits in her old easy-chair. 
She reads in her Bible of cities fair, 
Whose walls are of jasper and gold, 
And waits for the angels to carry her there— 
Don't leave poor Grandmother, now she is old 
CHORUS.. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silver locks now have displaced the gold. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silvered locks have now displaced the gold. 
Ah! well we remember when poor mother died, 
They laid her to rest where the green willows wave, 
How grandmother comforted us when we cried, 
Tenderly led us away from the grave. 
How patient, and gentle, and kind she's been, 
Her love for us ne'er can be told ; 
Oh, may her life's evening be calm and serene, 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc. 
The old village school-house that stands on the hill, 
The quiet village churchyard where tall grasses grow; 
The swift running stream near the old water mill, 
Bring back the meni'ries of long, long ago. 
These may be forgotten, but grandmother's care, 
Her tenderness, richer than gold. 
Shail ne'er be forgotten, our home she shall share, 
We'll not leave grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, et c. 
DORKINS' NIGHT. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by Joni.; PERKY, Washington St., opposite rostog 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny 1 
why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And lie lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give hint a 
cheerful hi I 
hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and them 
To give him a cheerful hi! Li! 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting ' round me. 
A 
hiss ! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all ' round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
lie's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought, so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
A 
nd, " Ladies and gentlemen," sail— 
If I 
cannot please you to- night. 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
" 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little ono dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
Sung nightly by W ILL. H. Moirrox, with HARRIGAN 
Ham's 
Combination. 
onie very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to lie true; 
The subject I'll mention to- night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A 
r .an may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
Tie struggles his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door 
To such worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
o 
give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
"fis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
1 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place : 
A man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how sGon things may turn ; 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return.

Alai sometimes I've plenty ot cash; 
Bu t, a

For he's happy when cutting a

But of one thing I 
wish to remind you, 
When for sporting and drinking you sigh, 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't fiy your kite up too high, boys; 
Don't fly your kite up too high. 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket. 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
If you go to a 
friend to assist you, 
he'll say that his moneys playd out, 
But when he was down, you to help him, 
Put your hand in your pocket., no doubt. 
But this world it is cruel and cold, boys, 
Though good times may come by and by; 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
Then don't fly, etc. 
There's many a 
good-natured fellow 
That's tee n

say, 
For if he'd a " Five" in his pocket, 
lied feel like a 
rich Mall to- day, 
Just listen to me what I 
say, boys, 
If you've money. put some of it by; 
When your out keep your friend in your pocket, 
And don't tly .your kite up too high. 
Thu don't fly, etc. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if y.,u will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look bright 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
Ills heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who Plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looKs like little angels there instead , 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were liKe fiends ; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware 
Who in public are so tender and so kind 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A. very ditlerent state of things you .d 
find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the worid outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household toem 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the sani._, in life, though what lo 1.3 of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make the ', selves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you''t find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then io matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatevr we enjoy, thert's something to annoy, 
if we gould only peep behind the sc.,nes.

Tell me there's joy for Hi: morrow, 
To thee ever true I'll remain, 
Oh, wake, love, from silence and sorrow,

Wake, love, from silence and sorrow, 
And call me your darlinc. ite•ain. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
Give me the man with an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be, 
He may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me; 
He may not wear a 
silken vest, 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest heart, 
His nature's all to me. 
All praise then be to him 
Who acts a 
noble part, 
For a 
right good man is he, 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What if a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank, 
They are bubbles on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not-honest be. 
All praise then, etc. 
Now if he owns an honest heart, 
So gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er, 
A 
better man to find. 
Then give to every man his due, 
Who acts an honest plan, 
It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then, etc.

'sew savino.s 
are all the rage on the street and on tlw stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'cr my mind, 
I 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
if perch:ince you meet an old friend upon the street., 
lie is p' or and all the world may sneer'at him, 
do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But mnember that his poverty is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show t 
hat you respect him st 111. 
'Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches- can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, . 
ay a 
glorious deed lie's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's deal :
oil gone, his loss they deeply mourn, 
IIe's it monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can,

I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side. 
Waiting the day when rn be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me. 
Ever my darling remain 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care ; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again !"

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As sting with great success by Miss Jr.lvloz HuoriEs. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me. 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company ; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button- hole you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
'itont -s.—Does your mother take in washing? 
Has she sold her mangle? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle? 
Has your father plenty of work ? 
Does be still get boozed too / 
Tell me all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not Nvithout a 
few, 
Choice friends who'll call to drink his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old man cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face he will say. 
Cimuus.—Does your mother, &c. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece ; 
His heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day: 
"Oh ! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent we'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, & c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And flatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge he does not show. 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, etz,e.

Seeking a

All pass me by, disdain in their dye ; 
None care to know me because I'm poor.

Their speed with success I 
did test • 
My broadcloth and linen superior then, 
My wines.and my table the- best.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a

?daily young ladies are \ isited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
i 
cp else, to senture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result ot this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, ehicb might have been pro•ouged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony.

culty, and being in the shape of q

phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their blfection-, which fact Makes further explanation un-
