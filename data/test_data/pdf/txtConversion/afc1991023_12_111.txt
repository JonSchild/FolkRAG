(0-10) Description of conversion in hospital; divine healing 
of spinal condition. Connection between health and "talking about 
the Lord:" when he does not talk to people about God, his back 
becomes painful. Response of hitchhikers he picks up while 
trucking to this type of conversation; reasons why people don't 
go to church. Description of visiting speaker who came to 
Lakehurst Baptist Church G—Browns Mills; 21GT who had spent most of 
his early life institutionalized, deaf and crippled, who spoke on 
divine healing at Easter 1982. Memorates of divine guidance. "The 
Lord gave me a lot of good messages out in the woods to talk 
about, you know?" when he was teaching the adult Sunday School 
class at his present church. He 
is sometimes asked to preach or 
to say a prayer at a funeral. 
religion, churches. 
(10-15) Born in Mississippi; 
lived 
in Florida, New Jersey; 
did farm work, chemical companies; finally bought this house 
after renting it for a while because the rent was much lower than 
anything closer to the farm where he was working. Worked in an 
express company and 
in a salvage operation "cutting up ships." 
Inex Chemical Company had longterm night work available, and he 
was there for ten years. "That was where I got started working 
in 
the woods around here. Guys were telling me about pulling pine 
cones -- I thought they's crazy, you know. Knocking berries, 
cutting cattails; I was a big enough nut to believe 'em, so I 
Cartwright--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 1 
learned how to do all that." He quit when they wanted to switch 
him to day work, and went to work fulltime in the woods. Summer 
was hard at first: the work was seasonal and required tools and 
equipment he hadn't had a chance to assemble yet. "In the spring 
of the year you knock blueberries, and then you'd go 
in pulling 
moss and stuff like that, cutting cattails, and then 
in the fall 
of the year you'd start cutting wood. But, see, I wasn't set up 
for that. . . . But whenever the guys started buying wholesale 
off of me, I told them -- they'd buy the summer wood, and 
in 
between seasons I kept busy . . . ." Saws, haulout trucks, an 
iron—wheeled tractor for going down 
in the swamps, and heavy 
earth—moving equipment belonging to contractors were used. For a 
long time they would use the contractors' equipment to clear out 
the woods for new houses, thereby getting materials for their own 
use and saving the contractor having to pay anyone to take the 
stuff to a dump. Now, however, contractors are selling the wood 
themselves. 
Nowadays people are still gathering grapevines, 
white birch, moss, cattails, pinecones. "The pinecones is not 
going as good as they used to, but you still can sell a few of 
them. Cattails is about the biggest, the best market it 
is, 
if 
you can get to 
'em; 
if you know where they at. . . . When I was 
doing that fulltime, I had a guy who was over here close to 
Batsto: he was coming through and buying them; I had a guy from 
Pennsylvania; I had a guy from New York. And then a guy from 
G—Whitings; 52GT would buy them if 
I'd take them to him, but I just 
didn't have time to take them over there. And I'd sell anywheres 
from, I could sell 6-700,000 a year if I had 'em. Me and my boy, 
we used to cut about 300,000. You don't get but three weeks out 
of the year cutting on 
'em. We cut anywheres from 10-17,000 a 
day. . . . [with] a half—moon sickle." 
gathering, technology, 
(plant), marketing, 
labor. 
(17) Use of pine gum in place of stitches for mending flesh 
wounds: a tradition brought from his boyhood in Mississippi. 
folk medicine. 
(18) Got a truck and hauled freight crosscountry 1979-81. 
Has been working with a trucking company on more local 
runs since 
May. He 
is beginning to get things set up for retirement, 
starting the egg business from the house, selling them for $1 a 
dozen, selling vegetables, expanding the garden, so that he can 
have some income when he retires. Plans to do more fishing then 
too, down the Mullica River. His father used to cook coffee and 
sweet potatoes while he caught fish in Miss., "and them fish 
would be just flippin' while he was cleanin' em. . . . We mostly 
put em on 
ice and bring em home." 
(22) House is wood heated. When he first moved into this 
house the 
land around had been burned over, and all the wood was 
very dry and good for firewood. He started cutting and selling it 
at the rate of six cords a day on a regular route that developed 
by word of mouth, as people saw how well 
it burned. 
He put one 
ad 
in a local paper, and never had to advertise after that. He

started around Medford Lakes, then 
it spread to Marlton, then 
Cherry Hill, Riverside, Deptford, Tom's River, Lakehurst, 
Lakewood, Freehoe, Manahawkin, Shipbottom, New Gretna, Tuckerton, 
all 
through in there. Up 
in Trenton, Princeton, around 
Bordentown, wherever they called me I went with wood." Bought 
rights to cut wood by the cord on privately owned land, or cut on 
state land where private people were allowed to cut. Now there 
are a lot of big city wood dealers outbidding him on the 
contracts for cutting wood on state land. You have to buy a 
hundred cords at a time now to cut, and the prices get driven up 
too high for him to manage. 
(23)Wood business started 1955, sold for $5 a pickup load. 
Then bought a 3/4 ton and sold a load for $8, then a ton truck 
and sold a load for $12. Then he got a 22—foot bed truck and went 
to $22. All fuel prices started rising at this point, and when he 
quit he was getting $40-45 wholesale and $55 retail. Now people 
are getting $55 wholesale and $120-155 for retail. 
He stopped gathering in 1979.

(0-03) Description of gathering activities: when he kept 
hogs and heifers several years ago: 
"I could go out along, when 
they cut the grass along the highway, I'd go out and rake that 
grass up for hay, and then when the farmers gathered the corn I'd 
go behind the corn picker and pick up what fell 
on the ground for 
my hogs and stuff. . . . They didn't mind; some of em, you'd give 
em half of 
it, 
you'd pick 
it up for half: some of em, they'd tell 
you to go and get what you wanted." 
(03-04) Elaine Thatcher asks him to tell a story he'd 
referred to earlier, concerning a New York schoolteacher who had 
seen the TV program made on the Pines that HW was 
in, 
and brought 
his class down. HW took them through the woods, one taking 
pictures and another taking notes. He showed them a hornet's nest 
and made the hornets come out; same with a yellow jackets' nest: 
he made clouds of them come out. The class watched the family 
work together and were amazed at the coordination, with no need 
for verbal direction: "I got in the truck, the big truck, and my 
wife and the boys, they followed me down, you know. My wife, she 
went out and she marked it for me, and my eldest boy, he was 
helping me cut, and the youngest boy, he would load it. So we 
hauled that truck down there and parked 
it out in the woods. And 
I got my saw and the boy got his saw, and we filled them up with 
gas and oil and we got out there. I started cutting 'em down, my

wife started marking them up, and the boy he come along cutting 
them up and the other boy he got the haulout truck and come over 
there. And he [the schoolteacher] says, 
'Man, I ain't never seen 
a bunch so organized:' nobody said anything, and everybody knew 
just what to do: just followed right in 
line, you know. . . . He 
says, 
'I 
don't know how you do 
it,' 
says, 
'I 
couldn't even lift 
it!'" 
labor, 
insider/ outsider. 
(04-05) Description of the haulout truck: the crew from 
National Geographic was very surprised that it would run, 
let 
alone do all 
the things it did. 
(05-12) Display and discussion of some garden produce 
sitting in the kitchen: green beans, tomatoes, big sweet 
potatoes, Southern peas, okra. Harvey and Dolores Webb come 
in; 
conversation with Elaine and Christine. Exchange of a couple of 
humorous stories. HW chats about his good health and habits: not 
much drinking, no smoking, regular diet, "Good Lord's taking care 
of me." Foodways: he's fond of catfish, fried 
in cornmeal, with 
hush puppies and turnip greens or lima beans. What's 
in the 
garden: cauliflower, cabbage, string beans, okra, potatoes, peas, 
beets, strawberries. Okra is a family favorite. 
(plant). 
(12-14) Farmland is being built on 
in New Jersey while the 
Pines are being saved: he feels this is going to cause problems 
later, for example in drought years. State should be keeping the 
prime agricultural 
land for agriculture. "You go all over this 
Pineland down here that ain't good for nothin: pine trees won't 
even grow very big on it, 
and they want to save that. . . 
More people coming into this country every year, 
if you have a 
good drought or a good rainy season where the crop rots and 
everything, I think you'll be 
in bad shape. Now when I first come 
up here, they used to have a lot of dairy farms, potato farms and 
stuff, 
like around Mt. Holly and Pemberton. But they're all 
gone, 
they all 
quit. And they're selling the ground now for houses, 
putting houses and stuff 
in there. And that's what really ah, 
within the next twenty—five or thirty years, somebody going to 
regret it. 
(break: mike stand fell over.) . . . When that 
governor put a halt on everything from (Highway) 206 down, not to 
build in the Pine Barrens, and then let all 
the good farm ground 
go up there, I couldn't understand that: that just didn't make 
common horse sense to me." 
(14) When he first came here, almost everyone made their 
entire living out of the woods; now very few do. A lot of his 
neighbors work at New Lisbon Developmental Center ("Four Mile 
Colony", 
in 
local parlance), or for the county. "From '64 to 
'73 
that's what I done. I could still make a living out of there, 
probably better than what I'm doing now. . . It's all 
hard work . 
. . but it's so many different things you can make: a lot of them 
makes anywheres from $75, $100 a day just cutting birch, just 
little whips, 
like, . . . for florists' decorations. . . . 
Laurel bushes . . . you'd be surprised how many different things

in these woods that can be used." Moss for packing plants, vines 
for making wreath frames for graves and Christmas decorations. 
(plant), gathering. 
(18-20) The number of blueberries wild in the woods has 
decreased sharply in 
recent years. The bushes used to be "bent 
right over" with berries: he used to make $20-50 picking berries 
before he went to work at night, and he didn't have the woods 
knowledge then that he has now: 
it took no skill to make that 
much money.

Pines; Pinelands Environmental Commission created, 
including Garfield DeMarco. Interview with him, with lot of 
quotes -- this one especially typical of region's farmers' 
thought: says he wants to see environmental dreams realized and 
made practicable. 
155: BC: You cannot demolish a municipality's ratable base 
and expect that you will have a living landscape; 
it will die." 
B. Pinelands Environmental Council created 1971; copy 
of article on 
its founding. Mark DeMarco had helped this come 
about: "That's interesting because it was the farmers who 
recognized the press of development. They weren't the bad guys, 
and they aren't." 
9. Copy of Legislative Bill 2096 for New Jersey, 1971, 
put together by Garfield DeMarco and Senator Barry Parker. "It 
was an interesting first try at coordinating thought in the core 
area of the Pines." Had county and state representatives, 
sportsmen, and agriculture. 
10. Article on 1975 revision of Pinelands Master Plan. 
195: Changes after Byrne administration in 
"land politics" 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT. The concept of "speculation" and "land 
politics" became used in some political mudslinging which hurt 
(justly or unjustly) Mark DeMarco's standing in some eyes. 
Pinelands became a strong point for whoever happened to be 
in 
power politically on state level. People in political and 
environmental positions looked at Bill Haines's vast woodland 
acreage and thought of him as a rich man who was going to sell 
land off to developers, and called him and others "speculators." 
There was what BC considers undue alarm about the amount of 
development proposed, and unfounded feeling that large growers 
would be responsible for selling a lot of land because people did 
not realize the role of the vast woodland acreages in cranberry 
cultivation: they are necessary, and maintained by growers as 
wild land, because of the necessity for pure and abundant water 
for the bogs. 10-15 acres of forest is needed for every acre of 
cranberry bog. Much of this land contains wild cranberries 
because they grow naturally in these regions.

268: Pinelands Environmental Council was looking at defunct 
farmland that the state might want to acquire. List of people 
involved and explanations of some of the individuals involved: 
family and professional connections in the region, role on 
Council. Includes Alvin Brick of Medford Concrete Company, 
farming family member who has seen suburbia advance; family had 
to sell a dairy farm and many bogs where residential developments 
are. Family split into real estate and development on one side 
and farming on the other. Wants to see more biological controls 
in agriculture: has doctorate in Environmental Studies from 
Cornell. Quaker family. 
Used to own land where Medford Lakes is 
now:

in 
it used to be a lot of Brick family bogs. Their 
brand was Pantry Brand; can see their old labels at the Research 
Center, framed by Mary—Ann Thompson. His part of family is still 
in blueberry and cranberry growing. His family's blueberries drew 
top price: they go for quality rather than quantity: -- they 
probably dry harvest. He 
is decreasing use of herbicides and 
pesticides and uses biological controls instead. Intimate 
knowledge of all the varieties of blueberries.

conservation, agriculture, cranberries, 
blueberries, water, government. 
250 (cassette turned over to side 2 without rewinding when 
dubbing this reel): 
There is a schism between growers and 
environmentalists partially because the growers doubt that the 
environmental 
lobbyists in the region really understand how the 
ecology operates: there have been cases when the 
environmentalists have represented growers as not environmentally 
concerned, committed, or responsible. The growers have a need to 
keep their ten acres of woodland per one acre of bog 
in very good 
ecological balance, and take care of the water's purity and clean 
up 
litter and couldn't possibly afford to have the 
nonenvironmental attitudes BC says they have been represented as 
having. While the tape was being changed, BC described some 
instances she felt were too locally sensitive to be taped, 
in 
which particular environmentalists had made recommendations and 
helped to bring about legislation that showed, to the growers' 
minds, that they "had not done their homework" on the actual 
ecological factors involved. 
I think I can speak with some degree of authority on this, 
because I found myself serving on the very first Camden County 
environmental agency, when I was a resident of G—Berlin Borough; 
29GT, which is 
in the heart of Camden County. There were seven of 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
us, and suddenly I found myself chairing this interesting group. 
We had four of us that were essentially environmentally in tune; 
three were more or less government oriented, but very nice people 
to work with. The offshoot of that was, one of the original 
agency members is the present president of the West Jersey 
division of the Sierra Club; her name 
is Carol Barrett. I got to 
know Carol during 1974 when I served as chairman. And the tragedy 
of Carol 
is that she 
is a very bright lady, and she does fifty 
per cent of her homework. And there is nothing trickier to handle 
than someone that's fifty per cent on target, fifty per cent off 
target. Today she 
is very vocal still with Sierra Club, which has 
a nationally very well—regarded reputation. The Sierra Club is 
the bane of the agricultural community's existence in the Pines. 
Because she has made pronouncements regarding these folks down 
here which have been so blatantly fraudulent. And one of her 
biggest axes to grind has been that she views the large 
landholders as speculators. She equates quantity of land owned 
with the speculators. . . . When you take Haines, with 
approximately ten thousand acres, she feels he has speculative 
interests 
in mind and will sell that land. She has never taken 
the time to scientifically find out that he depends on ten to 
fifteen acres of each forest area of his for one acre of bogland, 
and that is his watershed that he's protecting. And he draws, 
in 
part, from the west branch of the Wading (River) and also the 
Oswego. These are things that have somehow never permeated the 
general trend 
in environmental thinking. . . . 
Then there's something 
else that I think you might want to 
touch on with Garfield DeMarco, or 
if you talk with his brother 
the lawyer, Mark. Back 
in the sixties, when we had the jetport 
coming at the Pines . . . there was considerable speculation on 
Pines land. At that point Mark, the Hammonton lawyer, was the 
solicitor for, I believe, Bass River Township, where Floyd West 
is now the mayor. He defended the township very successfully 
against some speculative enterprise. Then . . . a major business 
figure, the man whose family built the Twin Towers 
in New York 
City and who owns the bulk of New York City real estate, had seen 
Mark DeMarco defend Bass River Township. And as I know Mark 
DeMarco related to me once, he said, "I was strictly the little 
country hick lawyer when I got the call saying, 
'We really like 
the way you did this; you destroyed our position. We would like 
to hire you on such and such a land acquisition deal.'" And Mark 
said -- and I think as he 
looks back now, he must be about fifty— 
three, he, 
if 
he had his druthers, probably wouldn't do this. 
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. And as he recalled, he went up to 
New York City on a hot summer day, complete with white shoes and 
a two—piece suit, when if he'd had 
it all together he would have 
appeared in dark shoes and a three—piece suit. But all 
of a 
sudden he was walking in, 
and he took this case, and he put 
together the parcel of 
land legally. Now the interesting part of 
it was, because there are so many unclear titles to land in the 
central part of the Pines, you found that he put together, for 
this firm, a package, I think it might have incorporated three or 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 17 
four thousand acres; again, I'd have to go back and look at news 
articles. He put it together in the same way the State of New 
Jersey put together the package of 
land which houses Stockton 
State College in Pomona, and the same way that . . . accommodates 
the Garden State Parkway. But because the state viewed him as a 
problem, maybe (I don't know the subtle nuances of all 
of this), 
tremendous lawsuit came down: unclear title, fraudulent title, 
land speculators at work, kind of. . . . 
This suit has now finally been all 
hashed out in the 
courts, and Burlington County judge Wood (I can't think of his 
first name) 
is mulling this over . . . I don't think the final 
decision has come from Judge Wood yet. . . .If it . . . is ruled 
in favor 
of the state, I suppose what you'll do here is uncover 
a great white—collar crime. Now, that has been the onus on the 
DeMarco name. Mark's . . . legal connection to what did become 
touted as a very big land speculative venture in Bass River 
Township made a lot of eyebrows raise: 
it made spectacular press. 
. . . the DeMarco name, through Mark, became a household word. In 
fact I remember when I first heard of the family I thought, 
"Ucch!" What I didn't realize was that what you cannot -- you 
cannot paint all members of the family with the same brush. And 
what I realized too was that while Garfield had gone into and 
handled all the agricultural matters, and is 
the farmer today, 
Mark had been handling the legal ends, and got his feet muddied 
in some rather nasty waters. Whether he 
is guilty or innocent I 
don't know; I really don't know. 
410:Garfield DeMarco was Burlington County Republican Party 
chairman, chairman of the Pinelands Environmental Council, 
Senator Parker's executive secretary, and he drew up the 
legislation for the Pinelands Environmental Council (we have a 
xerox copy of 
it from BC). He worked with National Park Service 
after graduating from Yale law school as a consultant on the 
Pines. He worked with Jack McCormick. 
Farmers in the core area of the Pines -- Lee, Haines, and 
DeMarco -- fought a fierce battle with the state Pinelands 
Acquisition people, because P.A. wanted to buy all 
the land 
in a 
solid ring between Lebanon, Bass River, and Wharton state 
forests. This would have closed a ring around the central 
cranberry growing region of the state, and surrounded them with 
land open to the public. The growers fought hard to keep the ring 
from closing because of the abuses of the ecology committed by 
public recreational users (see RCCO08). 
468: Five water regulation legislative bills were being 
discussed when they were trying to buy this ring of land that 
seemed to make sense from the point of view of recreational use 
and preservation of the aquifer, but that would have just about 
driven berry agriculture right out of business. One would have 
imposed a fee for water used above X number of gallons. Smaller 
growers would not have been able to save their crops during a 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 18 
summer like this one because they wouldn't have been able to 
afford water. Another, which has passed (Peter Furey of the N.J. 
Farm Bureau knows the details on the other four bills), 
limits 
the depth of wells that can be dug: you can't sink one into the 
Cohancy aquifer any more. All wells now allowed to be dug are 
shallow and therefore (Alvin Brick and Denny Doyle have said to 
me) there are some pretty constraining problems 
during dry 
summers. You can never have as much water as you need at one time 
on your bogs, for instance, unless you're rich enough to buy a 
very powerful pump for your well. So you have to flood a small 
section, then move the water to the next section, and you're 
always trying to save every drop because you lose a lot through 
evaporation under the hot sun. There was a dam bill where any dam 
over a certain length and size would have to be planned and 
reviewed by the state. You must have dams to grow cranberries. 
This legislation has been rewritten so 
it doesn't apply to 
cranberry bog dams, but it would have 
if somebody hadn't caught 
it. Water diversion from streams and rivers 
is also up for more 
regulation. Their channels may have to be reviewed by a personal 
visit from a state representative too 
if 
this goes through. The 
growers have been "sent into a tailspin" by the possibility of 
more water regulation. 
540: The Persky Bill, which was put together by Persky and 
Garfield DeMarco, stopped a bill that would have taken water from 
the Pines and piped it to North Jersey or Philadelphia. The 
Persky Bill makes it 
illegal to take water more than ten miles 
from the Pines, eliminating Camden and North Jersey. It CAN go to 
Atlantic City, and 
it may already be drawing Cohancy Aquifer 
water. Atlantic City "has to be one of Land Management's greatest 
boondoggles in this state. I think even before the casinos became 
a reality, there were 
well, or water well problems there. They 
go down to the Rariton (sp?) Aquifer, and they are very close, 
with their major water supply, to a toxic dumpsite." Byrne pushed 
both this development and talked environmental concerns in the 
Pines at the same time. "Either he didn't do his research or his 
team didn't really care, because you can't have the two things 
abutting and compatible." 
640: The boundaries of the Pinelands Reserve leave out the 
headwaters of the Egg Harbor River, and include only its lower 
portions. Therefore, the upper part of the river is open to 
industrial pollution, and endangers the entire Pinelands aquifer. 
The Burlington Borough sewage dumps into the Long A—Coming Branch 
of the Egg Harbor River. The sewage contains phenols, which are 
nonbiodegradable.

G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
0: Water legislation is being discussed a lot among 
agriculturalists in the area. Blueberry grower Ernest Cutts, near 
Jenkins G—Jenkins; 15GT, fully expects the aquifer to be tapped to 
supply water to North Jersey, and a professor at Stockton State 
College pointed out to her that it could be piped right up the 
Garden State Parkway with just an act of the legislature. 
(Parenthetically, Elaine, Jens, and I have heard people talk 
about wanting to secede from North Jersey because the smaller 
population of South Jersey leads to what people feel 
is 
underrepresentation of and concern with South Jersey's needs 
in 
the state legislature, so 
it's kind of a hot regional 
issue that 
this whole water discussion fits into.) The governor has used 
executive order to put a lot of temporary water measures into 
effect in a recent water crisis, and BC says folks feel this 
could easily happen in a more longterm way. 
019: This year's dry summer showed in microcosm what would 
happen if the aquifer were tapped and the water table of the 
Pines lowered. First, all 
the ferns die early 
in the season. The 
swamps dry up. Farmers can pump or use stream water for a short 
time to keep their businesses going, but not for long. Three 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel

page 20 
trillion gallons of water could easily go 
in 3-4 years. "It's 
just a mass of wet sand." Cedar would soon be replaced by pitch 
pine or oak. You'd lose many small plants like sundews and 
pitcher plants and the orchids. All the ericaceous plants: 
inkberry, climbing magnolia, swamp azalea, holly, 
leatherleaf 
would all 
go. (plant), water, conservation, government. 
044: Now, because so many sincerely environmentally 
concerned people haven't necessarily gotten the whole picture, 
they want to "save" the area. And I find -- as a group, 
oftentimes, the environmental community is very sincere, usually 
highly motivated, rather intelligent group of people. And they 
somehow, however, get duped into believing that Good Will Out. 
They don't seem to always realize that when push comes to shove, 
these regulations that could make it possible for a legislative 
body to suddenly divert water, you know, could be put into effect 
much more rapidly than 
if this area wasn't so stringently 
regulated. They'd like to believe that the guy 
in the white hat 
is going to be their elected official. Um, that isn't necessarily 
sound. 
054: Peter Furey of the New Jersey Farm Bureau (office 
in 
G—Mt. Holly; 21GT) 
is secretary and administrative assistant there. 
He worked for the Pinelands Environmental Council when it was in 
existence. He knows the scoop on water legislation on the area. 
He was an author of the report that produced the Farmland 
Preservation Bond Act in 1981. There are five pieces of 
legislation on the books right now and he 
is up on them: he's 
tight with Bill Haines Jr., who is Vice President of Farm Bureau, 
and with Stephen Lee III. 
088: Growers are alarmed because the State of New Jersey has 
been trying to buy a solid ring of 
land for recreational use that 
would run from Lebanon to Wharton State Forest, enclosing the 
main cranberry and blueberry producers on what BC called a 
"pincer." They are afraid of this and are fighting it because 
trespass vandalism is a huge problem for them already: four wheel 
drive recreation vehicles damage the soil surface and cause 
stream siltation; people pull gates on bogs for firewood, letting 
water needed for harvest be 
lost or crops ruined; 
leave lots of 
beer bottles that cause flat tires and cuts; start fires; steal 
berries and equipment; and they tend to freely use the private 
land adjacent to public land. One grower found a bunch of people 
sitting in a drainage ditch in his cranberry bogs, having opened 
one of his floodgates so they could sit under the resultant 
waterfall and enjoy 
it, 
heedless of the immense damage that 
resulted and actually insulted that he was upset: they figured 
they had a right to do what they were doing. Gateboard pulling 
G—Hog Wallow and Jenkins; 15GT for firewood and recreation is 
common. The existing forest service cannot maintain the lands 
already publically held: parks and forestry staff has been 
greatly reduced here and these hundreds of sand roads can't be 
patrolled now, and 
if more public land 
is added it will only be 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 21 
worse. There is dumping of trash on the Wading River and Lake 
Oswego, which is a reservoir for the Haines cranberry and 
blueberry fields. 
The most amazing thing 
is that folks don't seem to be able to get 
their trash from point A to point B. 
If they start at Lees' and 
decide they're going to canoe down the Wading River to Route 563, 
and they take with them . . . a carton of beer, they get off at 
563 and neither the carton nor the beer bottles will 
be with 
them. Somewhere along the line, these were left. . . . The Lees . 
. . have a fascinating story: about two years ago they went 
canoing 
G—Speedwell; 26GT on the Wading River as 
it runs through 
their property, and ran 
into some people, ah, from the general 
public, using their land, throwing bottles on 
it. And they 
enquired why this was happening, and it was a strange scene, 
because the public will challenge a grower, or any private 
landowner."Who says it's your land? Show me 
it's your land! Prove 
it's your land!" Totally rude. The point is, 
no matter whose land 
it 
is, be 
it the public or private, why litter it? 
There's a tremendous amount of drinking that goes on on 
any river. When 
you talk with the Micks or the Sooys, these 
canoe rental people G—Hwy. 563; 26GT, 15GT, they may relate to you 
as I know the Micks have to me, these aren't poor folks going 
down here. They're drinking the high quality beer: Heineken's, 
Lowenbrau, Michelob. It's good drinking going on these rivers. 
The abuse of the rivers going on during peak use, I don't know 
how you're going to cope with. These rivers -- contrary to 
National Geographic articles, turn and twist and when the water 
table 
is at all medium to high, the current is swift. These are 
not tea—colored, immobile streams. So 
if a canoer doesn't know 
how to manage a canoe, he's going to find himself crashing into 
the banks, and of course this causes an incredible amount of silt 
to get into the water. . . .Another 
thing, too: these aren't 
streams people out all 
the branch, overhanging branches from. So 
if you're not situated just right in your canoe, you'll go under 
a branch, 
it'll knock you off; you and everything in the canoe 
will 
go 
in the water. Tape deck recorders are found on the bottom 
of the rivers: my son unearthed one on the Oswego, a beautiful 
Japanese Sony AM—FM tape deck recorder. Now couple that with 
several beers, and the Micks have told me that it's not at all 
unusual to see people load, for two folks, a carton of beer. Now 
that's a lot of beer to consume in that short a span -- maybe a 
three—hour paddle. You'll notice oftentimes the sweet smell 
of 
marijuana as you go down there. Now, you're under that influence, 
and you're on a swiftly—moving, hairpin curve stream (as some of 
these can be), and you've got a problem as to how to manage the 
people in the canoe, how to manage their respect of the land or 
lack of 
it. How do you communicate with somebody who's really out 
of their mind, not to toss a match or break bottles? And that's 
what's happening down here. . . . As Calvin Adams (of Adams' 
Exxon Station G—Pemberton; 21GT) said, "If the state was so keen to 
make this a public national reserve, and the federal government 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 22 
too, then why doesn't the state, through a legislative act, tack 
on a dollar to everyone's tax bill, everyone that's taxed within 
the state? That would carry the cost (of putting more trained 
parks and forestry staff into the area to maintain the 
recreational 
land). 
recreation. 
221: Federal funding was legislated by James Florio that 
allows only for land acquisition for the national reserve. There 
is 
no funding for land maintenance. BC suggests that Florio be 
asked to put a rider on that bill allowing some of the money to 
go to maintenance of existing holdings rather than only for 
buying more. 
conservation, recreation, water, government. 
These are the reasons for growers' resentment of the 
"Pincers." Haines and DeMarco won't sell 
land that would close 
the pincer because (1) they have been offered ridiculously low 
prices per acre ($500), way below the money put into bog land to 
grow berries on 
it; 
and (2) because they are already maintaining 
this land 
in 
its wild state, as headland or headwaters for berry 
agriculture, at their own expense and labor, and 
if they sell 
it 
to the state it will not be maintained. It's over $3,000 per acre 
just to plant an acre of cranberries. 
263:discussion of social networks with topo maps, starting 
with Chatsworth Quad. 
Information on ownership of cranberry bogs has been marked 
on project office topos and on CC's set. 
307: Chatsworth Lake G—Chatsworth; 27GT is a reservoir for the 
DeMarco cranberry operation, and has a No Trespassing sign 
because of 
it, but BC has noticed people fishing and boating 
there. DeMarcos let them as 
long as there's no one creating any 
real hassle.

local place names for DeMarco holdings: the Spong, Big 
Bog, and Todds' Bogs or Todds'. Entered on PNAME files. (A spong 
is a word describing any marshy area, BC said.) Also Baptist Road 
and Jones' Mills and Arpens Bog (not DeMarco holdings) named. 
G—Arpens Bog; 27GT is on Woodmansie Quad (north of Goose Pond) and 
is some of the best bogland in the area. It's marsh on the topo, 
but since the map was made in 1957 it has been dammed and 
is now 
a reservoir. Arpens still own 
it. Dannie Arpen is present owner; 
her grandfather opened the bog site and her father worked it. At 
first it produced more cranberries per acre than any other bog 
in 
the state. But Dannie doesn't have good help, and it's not 
producing well now. (CC was offered an 
intro to Dannie by Mrs. X 
of Medford garden clubs.)

BC shows instances where Haines, DeMarco, Lee bogs are 
within a mile of each other, which explains why they work so well 
together and there 
is so much coordination of harvesting water 
use, sprinkler irrigation, frost—protective flooding. All 
are 
drawing from the same sources, such as the Shoal Branch of the 
Wading River, and all the rivers intertwine. Headwaters of the 
Shoal Branch are in the Whiting Quad, and pretty much the Wading 
River watershed runs north—south. The Wading and the Oswego 
supply almost all 
the surface water used by all 
the growers in 
the Pinelands. (There are pictures of her holding an 
index finger 
on the Chatsworth Quad map where this interconnection of growers' 
lands and waterways shows up especially clearly: see PFP83— 
CCC009-08.) If a developer, say, wanted to get the DeMarcos to 
sell 
him lakeside frontage on Chatsworth Lake (which they 
wouldn't sell), 
it would have a negative effect on the Lees and 
Haineses' water supply. It would lower the water table to build 
on Chatsworth Lake, plus the nitrogen fertilizers used on the 
resultant lawns 
in that area would leach into the water and upset 
the Ph necessary for berry culture. "You'd get a lot of vines and 
not very many berries," because nitrogen nourishes leaves and 
stems, not fruits, and tends to divert plants' energy to

development of these parts and away from fruit and root system 
growth. The Darlington growers are experiencing this problem in 
their bogs near G—Brown's Mills; 21GT. 
086: Jenkins and Oswego Lake Quads: Kupire Corp. took over 
cultivation at bogs called G—Sims' Place; 26GT near Papoose Branch 
of Oswego River. State has this area listed as one they wanted to 
buy 
And at one point three investors, 
land speculators, bought all 
this area, and then one of the partners, a George Kudra, bought 
out his other two partners. Now George Kudra is a furrier: he has 
a shop in Trenton, and I think he may dabble 
in 
real estate 
in 
Pennsylvania. He had a son that thought he might like to try 
farming this site; that didn't last long. The daughter now, 
Irene, who 
is supposedly the general manager, she 
is married and 
living in New York City. I don't know how anyone living 
in New 
York City and commuting down here to Sims Place can long afford 
to be an effective general manager, and I don't know how much 
longer we'll see that in production. 
137: 
G—Oswego Lake; 26GT is Haines's reservoir, which very 
few people realize. He 
is New Jersey's major grower; he's 
dependent on that lake's cleanliness and water level. 
164: Arthur Sooy owns Pine Barrens Canoe Rental, just south 
of G—Hog Wallow; 15GT on Rt. 563. There was a Sooy who found a 
huckleberry that was part of Elizabeth White's hybridization of 
the domesticated blueberry. Woodland Township's tax collector, 
Sharon Wells, 
is related to the Sooys on her mother's side. She 
would be a good one to talk to about the family's history. G—Sooy 
Place Road; 23GT is, 
of course, named for them. 
202: South of G—Tabernacle; 25GT there was an Earle Haines who 
owned a whole string of cranberry bogs; today, Fred Miller Jr. 
has some bogs there. On the Indian Mills Quad are several small 
growers who are different from those in the "core area" along 
route 563 because they also do "upland" (truck) farming 
G—Tabernacle; 25GT. They grow pumpkins, for instance. BC's 
knowledge of them is more recent and less thorough than her 
knowledge of the growers in the core area. The LeMunyons are 
in 
cranberries; the Abrams family 
is also in corn, cantelope, 
tomatoes, poinsettias G—Shamong; 22GT, and pumpkins. The "Indian 
Mills gang" "are as tight and as close 
in their friendships" as 
the growers in the core area. There are intergroup connections 
too, e.g. Bill Haines "is related through, I believe, his wife, 
to the Abrams family." Tony Gardner also farms in this area: 
cranberries; maybe other things. 
family, agriculture. 
269: Atsion Quad. Young Fred Miller (the son of an older 
farming Miller) has bogs 
in the Shamong/ Waterford border area 
Right up the road from Russos' Farm Market in G—Tabernacle; 25GT is 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 25 
Ernie Cutts's house; BC marked its location on map. This is 
Ernest Cutts Senior. Most of his children live right around there 
and Ernest Cutts Jr. shares a machine shop business with his 
father. They are leasing bogs 
in the Bass River State Forest on 
the Jenkins Quad map. Close to the Cuttses are Mary—Ann 
Thompson's bogs, where one of the 
last of the old cedar packing 
houses G—The Birches; 25GT still 
is 
in use (described to me by Brad 
Thompson as much better ventilated and easier to work in than the 
newer designs). Ada Simons farms the bogs at G—Moores Meadows; 25GT 
right below The Birches: there's a picture of her in the latest 
hardbound edition of McPhee's book, and she 
is this year 
president of the American Cranberry Growers' Association. She has 
her own recipe for cranberry juice G—Moores Meadows; 25GT which 
is 
much heartier than the commercial varieties. (I asked Alvin Brick 
Sr., a close neighbor and fellow cranberry grower of hers, about 
cranberry juice, and he didn't seem to know that anyone made 
their own or had any special way of doing it. 
Interesting.) 
There's more pulp 
in Ada's than in Ocean Spray. 
336: The Bricks recently sold their dairy farm just north of 
G—Bozarthtown; 25GT. BC says it's interesting that this farm was so 
close to the heart of the Pines; I don't know why. 
360: 
Right now, all 
the Indian Mills growers are members of 
Ocean Spray Coop, and this coop has put a restriction on land 
expansion for cranberry growing in order not to flood the market 
with too many cranberries, so 
if anyone wants to 
lease or buy 
more land to expand their operation, they'd probably have to seek 
an independent market for their crop. Deep Run Bog, for instance 
G—Deep Run; 22GT, 
is used at present only by duck hunters G—Deep 
Run; 22GT, because the growers who might otherwise like to 
lease 
it from the state for growing cranberries on belong to Ocean 
Spray. Clayburger/ Goodrich Bog near G—Hampton Gate; 22GT is state 
owned and wild, too. 
It was one of these two men who invented the 
TV picture tube, and they had just bought this land to 
live on 
and farm with their families when the state "condemned" the land 
in the 1960's. This was what happened at Whitesbogs too. 
"Condemnation" was done to preserve land for recreation, and 
it 
left a very bad feeling amongst the area's growers. 
Condemnation is a dirty word amongst the agricultural 
community here: they do not like 
it. And of course the state does 
have the right to condemn, but they have now realized what a bad, 
bad feeling it 
left, so I think they tread a little more 
cautiously when it comes to the condemnation of open space or, 
more particularly, of agricultural 
land. Because what the farmers 
said at a meeting at which apparently, (Phil Marucci tells me), 
Robert Rowe, (who was former commissioner of the Department of 
Economic, Conservation and Economic Development, which was the 
forerunner of the Department of Environmental Protection) said, 
"We shall never condemn another piece of agricultural 
land." And 
this was back 
in the late sixties. And the growers remember that; 
hope that the state remembers that: no more condemnation of 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 26 
agricultural 
land too. And I think they do: I think the point was 
very, very well driven home. That, again, 
is another facet for 
why do we have animosity in the Pines. . . . That sorely rankled 
the growers in the late sixties, that Whitesbog and this 
particular site, Clayburger/ Goodrich, were taken by 
condemnation.

TX01: CONTINUED FROM RCC009. TAPE 5 OF 5 IN INTERVIEW. 
THIS TAPE CALIBRATED IN MINUTES ON LANIER EDISETTE. 
001: Crews pushing beaters and driving berries toward the 
conveyor belt during cranberry harvesting at Haines & Haines's 
fields are mostly Puerto Rican, though not everyone looks 
it. 
Some are year round residents at Hog Wallow G—Hog Wallow; 26GT, 
others have been coming for harvest every year for a long time, 
and still others are quite new. Haines's is a huge operation, as 
is DeMarcos, and DeMarcos' 
labor is about the same. But you go 
out to the Micks' fields off route 563 near G—Jenkins; 26GT, and 
you'll see Haines, Henry, and Francis, plus perhaps Francis's 
grown son Joel, plus younger Anglo, "Piney" men harvesting. At 
the berry fields in Indian Mills G—Tabernacle Township areaGT, at 
the LeMunyons, Gardners, Abrams, and Millers, "you find that 
grower will help grower. And perhaps the LeMunyons will 
be 
helping the Abrams, and so forth." These are small operations and 
can handle the harvest between family members and neighbors, 
where Haines and DeMarco are just too big to work that way, and 
need hired help. This difference in the people handling it goes 
along with differences in approaches to the harvesting process. 
At DeMarcos, the company president, Garfield DeMarco, will be on 
the scene, but he's not out hoisting gateboards out in the field, 
or organizing labor: his farm supervisor, Earl Kirschner, does 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 28 
this. Garfield DeMarco is a kind of business administrator. At 
the Lee Brothers, Stephen Lee Jr and his two sons Abbott and 
Stephen III work very well together, and it's pretty much a 
family operation. Haines & Haines is the biggest grower in New 
Jersey, yet Bill Sr. and Bill Jr. both work 
in the fields, and 
it 
too 
is 
in many ways a family operation. Each approach works 
smoothly and 
is productive. The growers have different approaches 
to how to grow a crop, too, and at the same time as people they 
are very compatible. Ernie Cutts Sr. works a lot with his son 
Ernest Jr., and says his lawyer son Billy in Moorestown would 
like to come back and farm fulltime too, 
if 
he could get all 
his 
legal stuff cleared up. 
"Of course that's sort of the . . . best 
of the Piney commitment that you see there. While Billy might 
want to come back and might want to be a farmer, he feels a 
commitment to his clients that he just can't relinquish. And 
in a 
way I get the feeling from his father that he's torn a bit." 
The Indian Mills growers are small family operations with a 
strong sense of community between them, and tremendous "sense of 
commitment." Sense of community is related to the geography of 
the place (not specified how). Everett Abrams has a son Bubby who 
will 
inherit the farm. Bubby has a son who married about a year 
ago, "and he will probably be woven into the fabric of their farm 
family." Fred Miller the Elder and Fred Miller the Younger are 
not father and son, though they're related and farm together. 
Fred Miller the Younger also has a son involved in the operation. 
The LeMunyons are an old family, and some of their family 
gravestones G—Atsion; 20GT are 
in the cemetery near the Atsion 
ironmaster's mansion. It's probably a Huguenot name. Sam LeMunyon 
is 
the nephew of Norman LeMunyon, who has cataracts and has been 
pretty sad since his wife's death about a year ago. There's some 
sort of rift in the family. 
TX02: 005: WOMEN IN FARMING FAMILIES 
And speaking of wives, this 
is something that is very hard 
for me to get used to, because so many times, 
in a suburban 
setting, where there 
is enough money being provided by the 
husband, the wife will be off doing her charitable work, or 
pursuing her various craft projects. Here in the Pines, 
it's an 
amazing fact: 
it doesn't matter how wealthy the farmer, his wife 
is a helpmate. She 
is there somehow woven into the business. If 
it's Bill Haines, his wife appears to me to be very much a part 
of keeping all 
the records; the books; making sure that the 
various homes of the different workers in Hog Wallow G—Hog Wallow; 
15GT are 
in good order. If 
it's Mary Ann Lee -- she 
is Stephen Lee 
III's wife -- she 
is very evident in the packing house during 
blueberry season G—Speedwell; 27GT. 
If 
it's . . . I, 
I think of the 
day I went to the Abrams' house: 
it was early in the morning, 
about nine o'clock, and there was Mrs. Abrams, spotless. The 
house was spotless. You know, she was just very much making 
things run smoothly for her husband, by golly! These ladies get 
right out there and work right alongside. 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 29 
Now the LeMunyons, of course, are not a large—scale grower, 
but I remember a friend of mine telling me that when she had 
visited that Indian Mills group, Mrs. LeMunyon was working right 
out there 
in the packing house: no questions about it. These, 
these ladies do not have time for the frills. They are very much 
a part of the business existence, and their intellect is very 
much depended upon by their husbands. 
Now you take the DeMarco Enterprises. Mrs. DeMarco, the 
wife of the deceased Anthony DeMarco, 
is quite, quite handicapped 
by a very debilitating form of arthritis, yet her mind is 
as 
sharp as a tack and I've heard people say that she 
is still very 
much a hand in a lot of the thoughts that run that business. I 
could appreciate that: she comes with her heritage at Friendship 
where she was a girl, and her dad was a farm supervisor there and 
her brother was farm supervisor after her father (she 
is Gladys 
Alloway DeMarco, daughter of James G. Alloway). She knows the 
business; she knows the area. 
The Pinelands woman who has the opportunity to go off and 
pursue her crafts or pursue her charity, probably that would mean 
that she's not a real Piney G—Chatsworth; 27GT. That she probably 
has come here within the last generation. That most likely her 
husband has nothing to do with the agricultural 
industry as such. 
I think of the assistant farm supervisor up at DeMarco's, a young 
man by the name of Paul Fitzpatrick. His wife Cathy gets out and 
plants, as they call 
it, 
sticks for blueberries G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
Of course, again, I say that the two forms of agriculture (i.e., 
cranberries and blueberries) are so compatible. But there are 
cuttings. And she'll be out there planting flats full of sticks, 
which root so easily in this sandy soil 
if well watered. And 
she's mother of a one—and—a—half year old little girl, and she's 
out there hustling. . . . That, I think, 
is sort of a unique 
aspect of the family life: the woman's very essential, very well— 
regarded role as helpmate. She 
is by no stretch of the 
imagination an ornament. She 
is a helpmate. 
TX03: 008: HOUSES G—Hog Wallow; 15GT These workers' homes are 
"basic bungalow format" 
in structure. Agriculture being a major 
industry in the Pines, Bill Haines 
is the president of a company 
and 
in a way Hog Wallow is a company town. You get better 
commitment from folks working if you can provide them with 
lodging. Some labor families are 
in their third generation of 
staying with the Haineses. Some families there have kids going to 
college. Ernie DeStephano, Haineses farm supervisor, has parents 
who came from Italy. His son Ernest Jr. 
is now a lawyer and works 
as a partner of Mark Anthony DeMarco in Hammonton. 
architecture, 
labor, education. 
ETHNIC RELATIONS; SOCIAL CLASS The growers feel comfortable 
going with their legal problems to DeMarco and DeStephano 
G—Hammonton; 11GT, because they feel: "These are people who have 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 30 
lived 
in our area; they're our lawyers." Sense of identification 
and kinship. Ernie Cutts' son Billy 
in G—Moorestown; 16GT handles 
estates problems among other things 
in his law business, and BC 
says "I would feel very comfortable going to at Cutts, because 
I've learned to trust them. And I figure that a son of Ernie 
Cutts is very trustworthy." 
insider/ outsider, labor, ethnicity. 
010: HOUSES G—Chatsworth; 27GT DeMarcos don't have the 
geographic setup to build a small village like Hog Wallow, but 
across from their packing house is a little green bungalow where 
the DeLeon family lives. Mr.DeLeon was a migrant Puerto Rican 
laborer G—Chatsworth; 27GT who worked for Anthony DeMarco, and 
brought his wife up, and now is a permanent resident with three 
sons and a daughter. His eldest son Al, or Alberto, 
is a 
volunteer member of the Chatsworth fire company G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
And that's rather fascinating, because one of the things 
you find 
in the Pines is a Piney man feels, oftentimes, 
it's just 
part of his obligation or responsibility to join a local fire 
company, testifying to the fact that fire is very much a part of 
our area. And for Al 
to be part of the fire company kind of 
represents the evolution of his family. They are becoming Piney: 
very much a part of the community. In fact, when the fire company 
goes collecting door to door with their fire trucks, I know that 
Al 
came, with a longterm Piney resident of Chatsworth, to collect 
at our house this year. There you have Mrs. DeLeon and her 
husband, with Alberto, the eldest son, who would be about a 
junior in high school; Gilberto, who would be about a sophomore, 
I believe, 
in high school; Maritza, who 
is their daughter who 
will be a freshman in high school, and who 
is 
in eighth grade in 
Chatsworth Elementary School. My son says of Jose (my son being 
in the same class) that Jose 
is the only student in his class who 
consistently gets A's on spelling tests, and Mark delights in the 
fact that Jose 
is efficiently and effectively bilingual, Spanish 
and English. 
CC: I wonder if 
it was Jose who was teaching Spanish to two 
other kids in Buzby's Store when I was 
in. 
BC: Could have been. Could have been. Or 
it could have been 
either of his brothers. They feel very much part of the 
community. And Jose, I think, as the youngest child, has felt a 
need to kind of excel. 
012: Labor in cranberries and blueberries is Black and 
Puerto Rican and now some Cambodian. Along Route 563, the 
cranberry harvest is predominantly Puerto Rican help. Most of the 
supervisors and middle level people are local. In G—Chatsworth; 
27GT Earle Kirschner is a local (Anglo American) and he supervises 
at De Marco's. Under him is Paul Fitzpatrick, who grew up 
in 
Tabernacle and now lives 
in Chatsworth. A Mr. Haines on 563 was 
packing house manager at DeMarco's for a long time. Mr. DeLeon 
(who 
is a good communicator with the Puerto Rican laborers 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 31 
because he 
is Puerto Rican himself) now does the crew management 
at DeMarcos'. Earle Kirschner and Garfield DeMarco both speak 
Spanish. When they hired Paul Fitzpatrick about four years ago, 
they asked him to take a course in Spanish. 
ethnicity. 
Blueberry labor 
is a bit different with the small growers. 
The Thompsons and the Peppers' field south of G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
off route 563 depend on 
local help. The Thompson is a seventh 
grade teacher (Brad Thompson's brother), and a lot of his 
students who like him come and help. There is also a Black family 
who "always comes in, and likes to pick for them." Haines, 
DeMarco, and Lee have day—haul help G—Chatsworth; 27GT; G—Speedwell; 
15GT; G—Hog Wallow; 15GT which is mostly Blacks from Camden and 
Philadelphia. They are brought in 
in busloads. Stephen Lee Jr can 
describe this process specifically. 
I remember when I lived 
in the center of Chatsworth, 
it was 
incredible to see these people leave in these day haul buses 
after a long day, maybe about six—thirty, and sometimes be 
pulling through Chatsworth in the morning at five—thirty or six 
o'clock. So they put in a busy day and 
it's hot out in those 
fields. So 
it's a good opportunity for an unskilled person: at 
the Lees, 
if 
you get a good picker and he stays with you al► 
summer, they see that he gets a bonus. The Haineses work the same 
way with their Puerto Rican crew people with cranberries. . . . 
The person who will stay the full season on cranberries with 
them, for example, gets a bonus. If he comes back the following 
year he gets a bonus, only it's a little bit more. And it's a 
real 
incentive system, because what they're looking for is the 
opportunity to get their people to the peak of perfection as to 
knowing what they're doing out there in those bogs. And the 
financial 
incentives help tremendously. They really 
help to 
compensate for the cold weather in 
late October when they're 
harvesting. . . . It's really amazing to go by Haineses on a July 
late afternoon, and see the workers being paid. It's a 
tremendous, tremendous number of folks that come 
in there: you're 
talking a couple hundred or more. 
017: CAMBODIAN LABOR The Lees are doing something new . . . 
we've had an 
influx of Cambodians to . . . Philadelphia. They 
very much like having the Cambodians work with them. They had 
them in 
the summer of 
'82 and . . . '83. They feel they have 
better incentive and are better pickers than, for example, the 
black day haul pickers. Again, 
it just depends on . . . the 
pickers' orientation, and for some reason the Cambodians are a 
little better motivated. 
CC: Maybe they're experienced at working in 
rice fields. 
BC: Possibly so. Maybe their hands, being smaller, can pick 
a little quicker, you know. I know when I pick blueberries, I 
can't pick nearly as quickly as my son. Anyhow, I think with the 
Lees, 
if 
they could have their druthers, they'd almost go solely 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 32 
Cambodian pickers 
if they could. They seem to be speaking in such 
glowing terms of their fine work this summer. So we might see a 
lot more of these folks coming from the Orient that have been 
boat people. And this is exactly what we have here. 
(Cambodians are day haul 
labor and live 
in Philly.) 
019: G—Hog Wallow; 27GT HOUSES are recently built cinder block 
bungalows. Bill Haines Jr. told BC that his parents lived 
in one 
to try out the living conditions and the physical plan of the 
homes. There's also lot of day haul black and Cambodian labor in 
Atlantic County. 
architecture. 
022: Most of the growers will 
be 
insulted if you ask how 
much acreage they have. It's just considered an 
impolite 
question, partly because of all this rumor—mill stuff about the big 
growers being land speculators. 
023: Prince Street in Chatsworth was named for the Italian 
prince who was born 
in Chatsworth. There is a Panama Road near 
Chatsworth Lake, but BC doesn't know why it's called that. The 
Chatsworth dump 
is a bit north of the lake, back 
in the woods, 
and Mrs. DeMarco owned the land and gave it to the town.

There is considerable background noise on these tapes --
mostly crickets and a gas—powered cranberry elevator. The 
recording was made on four small 
reels, while I carried the Nagra 
over one shoulder and two cameras over the other; camera shutters 
can be heard clicking from time to time as well. The crickets are 
by far the loudest sound. This tape opens with a lot of general 
conversation: we all needed time to get used to the idea of 
recording. Things eased up pretty quickly, though, and we got 
down to good ethnographic content. This was a casual 
conversation, without much structured questioning: 
it balances 
between a natural conversation including the ethnographer, and a 
self—directed choice of topics to explain to someone who will 
write about the region and its 
land uses. 
002: Francis Mick helps Christine Cartwright get the Nagra 
onto the tailgate of the pickup truck, around which he and Henry 
and Dave are drinking canned soda and water after finishing the 
harvesting of one bog.

in an onion sack in a cool, dark place. Before, 
people always kept them in a cardboard box or a brown paper bag, 
and they often spoiled over the winter. They have to be able to 
breathe unless they are frozen. A lot of people cut them up and 
mix orange peels with them, raw, for relish, and to do that you 
need fresh berries, not frozen. 
(foodways). 
003: The Micks' bogs are set up in a checkerboard pattern, 
about ten bogs long and four bogs wide, with a reservoir along 
one 
long side, and woods all 
around. The Wading River runs close 
by the side opposite the reservoir, and each bog 
is about a 
quarter acre 
in size. (These are my untrained approximations, to 
be checked with the Micks later.) Francis explains that when his 
father first bought the 
land, he dug out the bogs at the south 
end first: they are older and have more grass in them. Henry adds 
that technically some of them are newer, because they have been 
reset. Francis explains that you reset a bog by taking cranberry 
vines from your existing bogs and spreading them out in the old

is 
currently combated with an herbicide that is wiped on the tops of 
its blades. Henry Mick explains that in the fall, when the sap 
returns to the roots, the herbicide descends with it and kills 
the whole plant. You can't spray this kind of herbicide because 
it would kill everything, including the cranberries. It's not 
poisonous, and actually fertilizes the ground when the process is 
completed. You put it on 
in August, just before the sap descends. 
It takes only a minute amount, and makes a difference in the 
amount of the crop you get. This 
is the first year they've tried 
it. 
They had someone put it on who had tried it before rather 
than take a chance themselves, for fear it might get on the 
vines. They'll know next year how well 
it worked, from the amount 
of grass that returns in the spring. He pointed out a patch that 
was not treated, and contains more grass and less berries.

been good this year for the sportsmen: one man told him he got 
1500. 
"I don't like to hear that." 
006: Francis Mick explains that hundreds and hundreds of 
wild swans come to their bogs at present, every year. (Military 
plane flying low overhead.) They try to eat the grassroots, but 
will tear up the berry vines too, and do a lot of damage. He 
points out a bare patch of ground in a bog where they cleaned it 
out completely. It 
is 
illegal 
to kill them, so they keep trying 
to figure out ways to scare them. This is a new problem, 
in the 
last 5 or 6 years. They used to go further south in their

migration, but now a lot stay the winter at a nearby wildlife 
refuge, and also they seem to have multiplied in number since 
they have been protected by 
legislation and the refuges. (The 
Micks have tied strips of white cloth or plastic, about a foot 
long by two inches wide, to the low branches of trees around 
their bogs to try to scare the swans away. It doesn't seem to 
work quite as well 
as they'd like.) They all feel there are some 
management problems with the swans. They're no good to eat 
anyhow, Francis says; Dave adds that people used to eat them, but 
they must be cooked a long time and "usually what they eat 
dictates what they're going to taste like." Some joking about 
what pigs and lobsters eat. But with birds 
it makes more of a 
difference in the taste of the meat.

008: Cognitive 
maps: some explanation of where the project 
people are housed and how long we have to do this. The fire tower 
G—Four Mile; 27GT is the immediately recognizable landmark for 
locating us, 
as 
it was for the Webbs and has been for several 
other people 
in the region. Some conversation with one of the 
bogmen about this and other fire towers: he climbed one as a 
child and a man showed him around, explained the equipment and 
what they do when they spot a fire. Conversation about the 
military planes: a pilot in trouble once landed on the road 
nearby. He was out of gas and pulled up to a gas station in his 
plane, asking where the airport was (laughter). One landed on 
Ernest Cutts's property once, too. 
012: Dave Kalm suggests they skip lunch and get the 
remaining berries out of the bog. There 
is not much left to do.

This 15 minute reel 
is 
blank, probably due to my screwing up the tape. Mostly what was 
happening was casual conversation about the cranberry scoop and 
its use, as Francis and Henry Mick demonstrated the technique 
(see PFP83—CCCO10, shots 1-14). The scoop replaced picking with 
the hands within their lifetime, and has been replaced by the wet 
harvest method only within the last ten years or so. The young 
assistants, watching Francis demonstrate the scooping technique 
for me (they were busy working when Henry showed me), were 
impressed by Francis's skill and amazed at the idea of doing it 
all 
day long. 
It involves bending down low to the ground in a 
very uncomfortable position, combing the scoop through the vines 
with a series of light, short strokes designed to prevent tearing 
the vines as the berries are pulled. Also on this tape was some 
discussion between Henry Mick and CC about the goals of the 
project and the purpose of the recording: the Micks had a bad 
experience in which some reporters asked to do a story on their 
harvest, and portrayed them as fitting the Piney stereotype: 
backwoods, uneducated, generally hick, which hurt them and seemed 
a breach of good faith, as well as being plain dishonest and 
untrue. CC gave HM a copy of the AFC newsletter with Mary 
Hufford's article on the Pines, with some identification, and we 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 37 
discussed the purpose of the project. HM felt that the most 
valuable thing we could do would be to serve as translators and 
mediators to present to the Commission and the state things that 
local agriculturalists have felt and said for years without being 
able to get through or get results. His particular concern is 
land management, and the safeguarding of agricultural 
land and 
headlands from ecological damage by tourists. Both he and his 
brother Francis stressed the need for more rangers 
in the area, 
and for a redirection of monies for acquisition of state land to 
the maintenance of existing holdings to prevent real erosion of 
the national resources here.

The men named above were 
being assisted by Dave Kalm and two others, names unknown, who 
are not on the tape. 
000: CC shows Francis Mick how the recording machine works; 
he comments that his grandson has one at home. (This was a 
wonderful scene, and one I would have photographed if I hadn't 
been alone, with too many pieces of equipment to manage at one 
time. Francis, sixty or so, slim and wiry from years of work, was 
standing by the pickup truck, 
listening to the tape. He took his 
cap off to put on the earphones and listen as I flipped the tape/ 
direct switch back and forth, so he could hear the difference, 
and played back some of the tape for him. He has a gentle, 
expressive face and a remarkable pair of eyes at any time, and 
in 
this moment of 
interest in a novel phenomenon, he had a listening 
look that was profound and indescribable. I was aware that there 
was something classic about it -- the old farmer listening to his 
voice on the fancy government tape recorder, while the young 
fieldworker with the Ph.D. stood watching to see 
if he 
liked 
being recorded. Francis Mick was a wonderfully articulate and 
photogenic man, too: his speech requires careful 
listening, for 
it 
is not always clear, but his love for the 
land and his deep 
awareness of 
its ecological dynamics made a deep impression on 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel

page 39 
me. ) 
As we made this tape and the next two, the others were off 
to the packing house (a small, open—fronted building on the 
Micks' family property) with the last berries harvested from the 
bog they had been working on that day and the day before. Francis 
and I remained, and he showed me around the bogs and taught me 
about their workings. 
002: Standing out of the sun by the Wading River, a few 
yards to the west of the bogs, FM explains that the wild ducks 
used to be fed by 
local people when the streams froze. The state 
dumped feed in the streams around Harrisville. But now they put 
it at Brigantine Wildlife and don't bother to put it up here (I 
think FM regrets this change). 
003: FM used to canoe that river in a flatbottom boat made 
by Joe Cramer of New Gretna: 
"Joe," I said, 
"I want to get a canoe, I want to get a boat 
built like a canoe, only flat—bottomed." He took his hat off and 
scratched his head (laughter), and he come up with one just about 
like a canoe, only flat—bottomed, and 
it worked good. It was more 
stable: 
it wouldn't tip and that. And we used it for ducking. 
About 1500 people go down the Wading River on an average weekend, 
in clumps: 
it's terribly crowded now. 
They usually got 2 or 3 ducks to eat and that was all. 
"I 
never believed in killing anything if you wasn't going to use it. 
A lot of people kill things they ain't using. I did it more just 
for the sport, just, you know, getting out in the woods away from 
the work around here (laughter)." 
Work on rainy days includes mending tractors and other 
machines, and making crates out of pine. Used to be all cedar; 
now they're pasteboard. (Lot of background noise because Nagra is 
being carried over my shoulder as we walk through tall grass.) 
The pasteboard crates, 
like the wooden ones they used to use, are 
never returned by the packing company. Most farmers used to cut 
their own cedar because there was plenty. In other states, they 
make you stop at a certain amount of cedar or replant after you 
harvest; here in NJ, they don't do that. FM thinks they ought to, 
because the resource 
is not being renewed and protected as he'd 
like to see it be. 
007: There was a TV show that showed Fred Brown's house, and 
some newspapers from Philly here. CC is reconstructing and 
filling in an earlier snatch of conversation about this, 
prompting FM by recalling what he'd said earlier about how the 
papers made out like nobody 
in the Pines went to school and they 
all 
lived like Fred Brown of McPhee's book, 
in old shacks with 
mice eating off their dishes on the kitchen table. They said that 
local people never got out of the first or second grade, making 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 40 
everyone look bad. FM explains that his stepmother (his real 
mother died when he was about 15) chased the reporters off her 
place when she found out what they were doing; he didn't blame 
her. 
008: Henry mostly takes care of the water on the bogs during 
the winter months, and he (Francis) does it during the summer. CC 
asks to get a photo of how the gates work and FM agrees to pull a 
couple of boards out and show her how they open and close. Tape 
skips to opening of the gate; water sounds, rushing and splashing 
as FM works two one by eights out of place with a crowbar, 
up to 
his breastbone in the flooded bog. 
009: Tape skips to his opening of a second gate, 
leading 
from the bog about to be flooded into the next one to the south. 
He spots one of the bogmen fishing in the reservoir, now that the 
work is done. He is catching pickerel. FM finds a small, bright 
green frog near the gate 
in the water, and, with a smile, 
lifts 
him in the palm of his hand for CC to see. His laugh 
is 
lovely on 
the tape. FM explains that he won't run much water through the 
gate because there aren't enough boards at the other end of this 
bog's drainage ditch to hold it 
in, though he assures me that he 
won't actually lose any water. Water sounds on tape: boards 
creaking as he crowbars them out, and the rush and plunge of 
water. (This 
is a great section of water noise for about two 
minutes.) 
012: The water has to be just 2-3 inches above the top of 
the vines for wet harvesting; 
if 
it's deeper, you can't get the 
berries out. The field being flooded is the next one to be 
harvested. They will start about 8 a.m.; he usually has the field 
all 
set for harvesting by 5 or 6 the evening before. 
013 When his father first set these bogs out, they only 
extended over the southern half of the present bogs. The 
reservoir was a bog too, then, but it was muddy ground and didn't 
"pick too good," so 
it was made a reservoir.

progress as tapes were changed: Cedar was used, until 
it became 
too scarce, for making any types of wooden structure needed 
in 
cranberry culture which was not going to be totally and 
permanently submerged. The wooden lining for the tunnel 
underneath the dikes 
in the bogs which connects their water 
supply, and ends in a gate at each side of the dike, could be 
built of pine because pine is preserved well when submerged. Pine 
deteriorates if exposed to the air; therefore, booms were built 
of cedar for as 
long as possible. They are now made of pine and 
therefore tend to break when they are bent into a tight 
semicircle toward the ends of a harvest in a single bog, and have 
to be replaced frequently.)

architecture. 
033: 
It acted as a good base for the rest of the chimney. But we 
had a fellow come 
in and put a furnace down 
in the basement . . . 
and this fellow, he didn't care, he didn't worry about anything. 
He took that old sandstone base out, and he 
looked up a little 
and says, 
"I guess we don't have to go any farther," you know: 
sticking his head up under there. Now, the rest of the chimney's 
already there: 
it had been built. The good chimney, the modern 
chimney, had been built above it. We were glad when he got the 
job done, 
'cause we were afraid he was going to get hurt. 
Henry adds that the only thing holding the chimney up, down 
in 
the section where this guy was working, was where it was joined 
onto the house. Haines suggests maybe I could get some time to go 
look at the Harrisville iron furnace; gives directions. 
discussion of Harrisville; very modern town in 1800's: "They had 
gas lights and everything." Made paper G-Harrisville; 26GT there, 
using water power. Used hay 
in paper- and brickmaking. All 
the 
furnaces (Martha, Batsto, Harrisville) were "tied together" at 
one time. 
076: Iron oxide and oyster shell used to make glass 
G-Harrisville; 26GT at Harrisville Furnace. Made stoves and 
cannonballs. 
085: Haines Mick, fingering cranberries in the loaded crates 
on the truck bed as we talk, shows me a berry he thinks was 
frozen at some time before harvest: 
it 
is mushy inside the firm 
skin. CC asks how long the technique of flooding the bogs to 
prevent freezing has been 
in use. Haines Mick explains that when 
berries get color they will stand a lot of frost; they can stand 
28 degrees Fahrenheit. They get pale and spongy 
if they freeze. 
To protect bog completely you have to flood deep enough to cover 
plants completely. Depth required depends on dewpoint and 
humidity: cold settles 
in 
low-lying land areas, but if fog forms 
in bogs 
it will keep condensing on vines and that does instead of 
flooding. Also keeps heat from rising out of bogs. 
117: There is a special temperature reading for cranberry 
bogs on the weather reports on 
local news programs. Phil Marucci 
developed a formula for figuring the bog temperatures in advance, 
and he thinks the weather bureau 
is probably using that, but 'you 
have to be your own forecaster. It's a guide, but 
if you think 
there's going to be any chance of frost, you'd better be there." 
135: Henry Mick explains that they live about 50 miles away 
G-in Egg Harbor City; 05GT and 
it takes an hour to reach the bogs 
Cartwright--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 43 
When 
it 
is fifty degrees or so at home, they know they have to 
get up to the fields: often there's 15 degrees' difference 
between the bogs up here and their home. 
144: 
It takes 2-3 hours to flood the bogs for frost 
protection if there is enough water, but lately there has not 
been enough water. You have to get the water off again when the 
temperature rises, or it will damage the berries. The way they 
have their bogs set up, the elevation sinks gradually from one 
end of the fields to the other, and they don't have to 
lose water 
once they've used it to flood bogs: can be recycled back into the 
reservoir. But some people have to pump it from bog to bog, and 
that's expensive: a "high volume lift pump" pumps 25-30 gallons a 
minute, and takes a lot of power to run. Uses propellers. 
188: Cleaning the drainage ditches of grass and stuff 
clogging them is done by hand. "But somebody will come up with an 
answer to that too, someday. . . . The bigger growers, I think 
they hire somebody to do 
it."

berries,

It 
is usually one or two 
in the morning by the time 
they get back from taking the last load of berries to Ocean Spray 
each day during harvest. (Sound of forklift is very loud, being 
driven by Haines Mick.) This degrassing operation is called field 
running. Other growers use other systems: Haines & Haines have 
gas—fired dryers and washing equipment of their own, and when 
they deliver their berries to Ocean Spray they can go right into 
the freezer, but the Micks' berries are washed and dried at Ocean

Spray. This means that they are paid a bit less for their 
berries, but more than 
if they were not cleaned at all, and the 
initial X70-80,000 investment in the Haines equipment is beyond 
their range. The Micks drypick G—Chatsworth; 27GT only to give 
berries to friends. 
053: Most of the growers have the same essential 
layout for 
their packing house exteriors: a concrete floor extends out 
beyond the packing house. This space is used for driving the 
forklift between the truck and the degrasser and back to the 
truck, moving the crates of berries. The forklift is rented each 
year at harvest. Their father also used to rent one; before that, 
they used a Darlington drypicker G—Chatsworth; 27GT and processed 
the berries by hand. Originally, about 1926, when his dad first 
started the bogs, he used a horse and cart. 
084: Henry Mick explains how the bogs were dug out by hand, 
with shovels (some were done by machine later). On the original 
bogs, his dad cleared them of thick woods to make the bogs, 
digging out stumps and cutting off the biggest trees underground. 
The sand dug out to make the drainage ditches was thrown up 
alongside them to make dikes between the bogs, which are used as 
narrow, high roads to drive the trucks on. 
technology, 
agriculture. 
038: Henry Mick and I were discussing the sheer physical 
labor of farming this way, and he stood in thought for a moment. 
Then he explained his own attachment to farming: 
You get used to 
it; 
if you like it, why, you get used to it, I 
guess. Most people like what they're doing and wouldn't want to 
do anything else, I suppose. Oh, we've tried other things: I 
worked at the Navy during the war as a radio and electrical 
inspector. Pretty far cry from this! And my brother was 
in the 
army; he worked on . . . aircraft 
radios and stuff. But we came 
right back. (laughter) Some of the fellows said, "You're not 
going to go back down there again, are you?" (laughter) But we 
did. 
CC: Well, 
it's beautiful country. And like you say, you work for 
yourself. 
HM: That's the best part about it: 
you work for yourself. If you 
make 
it you make it, 
and 
if you fail 
it's your own fault. Here 
you can always blame it on the weather (laughter) which a lot of 
people do, but -- everybody does, I guess, but . . . 
I asked about state regulation and 
if 
it was making farming 
harder. Henry Mick feels that the situation is a bit easier now 
than when the Commission first came 
in: 
regulation used to 
prevent you from doing a lot more than it does now, though 
there's still a lot of 
red tape. I asked about a topic his 
brother Francis had mentioned: the state's desire to buy the 
whole core area as a wilderness recreational area: HM is pretty 
sure this has to go through the Pinelands Commission. He'd rather

does. 
government, conservation. 
143: The equipment was put in about 1968, and the three 
brothers took it over (from their dad, I think) about 1973, when 
they would have been 
in their late forties if my guess at ages 
is 
right. HM recalls that Bill Haines Sr. used to do a lot of field 
farmwork by hand with his men: spraying, for instance, 
is done by 
hose still at the Micks, and by plane at Haines & Haines. They 
spray in the springtime, against rot and girdleworm and another 
couple of insects. He showed me a berry affected by rot: all 
soft 
inside its skin. Sparginosis is a worm that infests the berries 
themselves: girdleworm eats the roots of the vines: they once 
lost a whole bog to girdleworm and had to replant the whole 
thing. The herbicides to kill the grass, Phil Marucci of the 
Cranberry and Blueberry Research Center told them, can worsen 
girdleworm problems because 
if there is grass available, the 
girdleworms will eat that and leave the vines alone. Stump (?) 
disease, spread by the sharpnosed leafhopper, 
is a virus that 
affects both cranberries and blueberries. There 
is 
no cure. 
206: CC asks what was done about this before the chemical 
sprays were available: bordeaux mixture, a mixture of bluestone 
and lime, used to be sprayed on.

religion, churches, history. 
This tape calibrated on a SONY TC150—A. 
OOO:Alice Tomlinson explains that the orthodox Quakers were 
the original settlers in the region; the Hicksite Quakers were a 
splinter group, begun by Elijah Hicks with a fairly large group, 
involving some of the wealthier local families. They met in the 
same meeting house, but had their own lock and key and a separate 
time to meet; 
later they built their own place. (This information 
is extended in a booklet given to us by Mrs. Tomlinson, Union 
Street Friends Meeting House, 1814-1964 {Medford: The Central 
Record, 1964), and a pamphlet, Quakers in Historic Medford, 
n.pub., n.d.). The original meeting house built in 
1761 
is across 
the street from the Tomlinsons' home, and, as a Quaker 
schoolteacher and historical society member, Mrs. Tomlinson takes 
children through it (it 
is still 
in use) and tells them about the 
early meetings, when there was a wood stove, and the men sat on 
one side and the women on the other. They also react to the 
present day structure of the meeting house and meeting: 
And it's fun to explain to the children all 
about the meeting 
And they say: What's -- what's all this?" You know, and they 
look, and it's so plain. And I talk about the facing benches: the 
benches do face out. And meeting is held for almost an hour, and 
it's very quiet, and anyone can get up and speak, and even 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 48 
children speak sometimes. And the wedding idea is, you stand up 
in front of the meeting and face each other, and I'll just quote 
a little bit of 
it. You'd say: "In the presence of the Lord, and 
these our friends, I take thee Ephraim, promising with divine 
assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful wife, until 
death shall separate us." And then he says his part, and I say 
mine, and we sign the certificate, and the audience of the 
meeting house are the witnesses, and they sign the certificate. 
So there 
is no minister. And then people hold a meeting 
afterwards, like a regular meeting, and people get up and wish 
them good luck or something like that. But that's a Quaker 
wedding. 
025: Her mother died when she was five, and she was raised 
by her aunt Lydia, who taught in the little Quaker schoolhouse, 
run by the orthodox Quaker church. 
043: There are quarterly meetings of the Quaker community 
in four communities: once they meet in Medford, once 
in 
Moorestown, once in Haddonfield, and once in Mt. Laurel. And this 
gathers a larger group. Annual meetings are also held at the end 
of March at the Philadelphia meeting at 4th and Larch Streets. 
The region's meetings are responsible for sending their quota of 
money to the Philadelphia meeting each year: they don't have 
voluntary collection, like in churches, but are told how much 
they are to give. If they have a local need, 
like for new carpet 
in the meeting house, they tell the membership what they need and 
ask for donations. 
063: Medford NJ was named after Medford, Mass., by Mark 
Reeve, 
in 1800. 
074: QUAKER FARM CHILDHOOD: she is one of three children. 
They were not allowed to go to any public affairs in town: Aunt 
Lydia had an 
idea she didn't want them to, though the reason was 
unclear. A farmer used to go by with his truck, but Alice wasn't 
allowed to ride with him. Aunt Lydia was "a real sweet little 
Quaker lady, and you stayed HOME, you know!" (Later Mrs. 
Tomlinson showed me her grandmother's bonnet of black silk, and a 
soft dark red shawl, and a child's sunbonnet kept from her 
mother's childhood.) She attended Moorestown Friends School, then 
public school, and then Westown Quaker boarding school. They 
hadn't much money, but it was a nice farm life, not different 
from that of non—Quaker farming f

in the area. Her father 
owned a farm on the south side of Medford; Ephraim Tomlinson's 
family owned one on the north side, and they used to get together 
for hog killings G—Medford; 18GT. 
090: HOG KILLINGS: "I can very definitely remember the hog 
killings!" They needed a big tub to dip the hog 
in and scald 
it 
before scraping the bristles and hair off the skin. For sausage 
making G—Medford; 18GT you scrape and rinse the intestines with 
running water and turn them inside out. Then you slide the end of 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 49 
the intestine over the sausage stuffing machine and fill 
it with 
sausage mixture. Salt pork was stored in the third story of the 
house for winter use. (foodways), history. 
102: They burned a lot of wood for heat in the winter 
"because Daddy was kind of poor. You know, each year you're going 
to make more money, and each year you lost more money. So we got 
along, but we went to normal school 
instead of some fancy 
college." They also went to summer school, thanks to Mr.T. Lister 
Brown, whose fund paid summer school tuition for orthodox Quaker 
schoolteachers. He 
left a lot of money, and only the interest of 
it was used. They had to contact Philadelphia, and they could get 
either $225 or $240.00 for summer school at Columbia University. 
"And all 
the orthodox Quakers took advantage of that." So she had 
five summers of university. "Isn't that wonderful? We'd take our 
car and take our apartment and . . . it was such an experience to 
get off of the farm and go to New York City. 
education. 
120: Her father had a nice set of mules and she used to ride 
the mule up to Medford, till 
he got a riding horse. "And I lived 
a little better with the riding horse. But they kind of 
looked at 
you funny when they see you going down the road riding on a mule. 
But that was the farm life, and we got along with it fine." 
(animal), history. 
125: Lot of cooperation between neighbors in the farm life: 
she'd go get milk from a neighbor if they didn't have any cows at 
the right time, and 
if someone was sick, the neighbors would help 
each other and come to visit the sick. This went on across the 
religious delineations. The Bricks, for instance, were Hicksite 
and her family was orthodox. But her father, Jay Wilkins, and 
cranberry grower Francis W. Sharpless, both felt strongly that 
the Hicksites should rejoin the orthodox church. 
144:ICE HOUSES; PEDDLING: They had a great big old 
white 
farmhouse, and an 
icehouse. She remembers going to the lakes 
in 
the area in the winter and cutting ice. 
It was packed 
in sawdust 
to 
last through the summer. Later when they got an 
icebox, 
ice 
was delivered to the house. This and other peddlers would come 
down their lane ("the lane was 300 yards long"). There was a 
knife grinder G—Medford; 18GT, and a man who would grind 
horseradish fresh for you G—Medford; 18GT, and a fish man G—Medford; 
18GT, and others. It was not just one ethnic group ("there was one 
named Klein") but people who lived 
in town and did this as a 
retail business. She 
is pretty sure they didn't have land of 
their own: this was their main income. The Kleins went down to 
the shore and got the fish and brought it back and handed it out 
of the back of their truck. It was kind of messy: the fish were 
in tubs and they wrapped them in newspaper to give them to you. 
marketing, history. 
174: HAY BALING: Description of transport of hay from field 
to barn when it was loose: 
it was pitched into a horse—drawn 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 50 
wagon with a hayfork that had tines longer than your arm. As 
children they played in the loose hay 
in the barn a lot, and 
"would make a hotel" (CHILDREN; GAMES; FORTS) G—Medford; 18GT in 
the hay, piling it 
into shapes and building it up around 
themselves in the haymow. The baling machine was owned by one 
man, as 
it 
is now, and he went around to everyone's fields. Same 
way with soybean harvesting and corn picking G—Medford; 18GT today: 
anything that needs expensive farm equipment, you phone the guy 
who has 
it and make an appointment for him to come do your 
fields. First a team of horses or mules, then later tractors, are 
individually owned. Keeping the machines (as Kenneth Yates does 
in Tabernacle) 
is a business in 
itself within the agricultural 
community. 
agriculture, technology. 
212: Her dad once let his own corn get rotted 
in the rain 
while he saved a widow's crop after her husband died. "That was 
the way the farmers took care of each other. It was a lot 
different than 
it 
is now 
This place has grown up so fast! 
Terribly fast." 
224: Ephraim Tomlinson and Jerry Hockey are mentioned a lot 
in the McCarg study done a few years ago here: trying to control 
the fast growth of the area was a major goal 
of Tomlinson's while 
he was mayor. 
conservation, government. 
232: QUAKER FAMILY UNIQUENESSES: Certain people very 
definitely used the old speech. Jeannette Haines and Alice's aunt 
Lydia always said "thee." And there were certain people that you 
always said "thee" to: the older ones. Westtown was very 
definitely a Quaker boarding school, and they were not allowed to 
have silk stockings or red dresses (clothing) G—Medford; 18GT. 
Their clothes were made by a dressmaker, and their stockings and 
underclothes had to be of cotton rather than silk 
in the boarding 
school. The reason was that they didn't want the poorer girls 
feeling inferior to the richer ones. All her clothes were plain 
and homemade. They also learned Bible verses regularly. 
education, religion, history. 
261: Ephraim Tomlinson arrives home from the library and 
the recorder is turned off for introductions and settling 
ourselves into a threesome. 
262: Medford is 
lucky that it 
is not a convenient place to 
live: that has saved it from a lot more development. But it had 
been a center of life 
in South Jersey for a long time. He had 
been connected with it for 40 years, and seen it develop from 
rural 
to rural suburban. Its population has developed in a pretty 
spread—out pattern, and new residents have tended to build 
outside the actual town boundaries. 
Because Medford is not a 
convenient location for a lot of commuters, 
its new residents 
have tended to come there because they like the place rather than 
for the sake of convenience. This a major factor in the town's 
development. People come because it 
is a good place to raise 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel

children G—Medford; 18GT, and therefore its school 
is still growing 
while other schools have decreased in population. 
Haddonfield 
and Moorestown G—Evesham;l6GT and Medford are the only towns that 
have stayed in good shape: the others have become congested, and 
"people don't live 
in these towns like they used to . . . : they 
live out of town. . . . Camden 
is 
like a battleground, almost, 
and now it's spreading out into Collingswood . . . Medford has 
improved over the years rather than deteriorated." Litter, rot, 
crime all part of concept of deterioration of communities. Doors 
boarded up; houses falling down that should have lasted for a 
thousand years, 
like houses in Europe. Comments on the 
deterioration and redevelopment of Society Hill area of 
Philadelphia. 
architecture, preservation. 
380: He 
is 
in estate work 
in his law business: has done tax 
work and estate. Never liked criminal 
law or court work, except 
for juvenile and probate. "We took care of our kids HERE in the 
old days, quick and fast, and most of them never -- because we 
took a real 
interest in them, we'd usually never see em but the 
once. Except when they were grown; then they came back. There 
were so many kids that I had to take care of, when they were 
little and got into trouble, and later they came to me for 
business. So maybe we did the right thing." 
crime. 
404: 1950 town population was 2800; now 19,000. But here if 
you go over in an airplane, you can't see the houses for the 
trees, where 
in other communities there is a lot of cleared land. 
When he was mayor they had stopped tree—cutting, feeling that it 
had gone far enough. One reason in his mind was need to 
"regenerate the oxygen . . . because the plant life, the trees 
especially, use up the carbon dioxide and regenerate it as pure 
oxygen. So 
if 
you don't do it, why, someday we have too many 
people and animals that breathe air that won't have it to breathe 
one of these days. Particularly when we start polluting it the 
way we have." (plant), pollution.

000: Mr. Tomlinson's family was originally Orthodox Quaker 
G—Medford; 18GT Great grandparents got thrown out of meeting, but 
family always rejoined meeting. One member was thrown out of 
meeting three times during American Revolution because he was in 
the First City Troop 
in Philadelphia, and stayed in 
it for 20 
years after Revolution. Military involvement not accepted by 
Quakers. One man around Medford was thrown out of meeting for 
delivering supplies to Continental army during Revolution. 
Washington made deal with Quakers that they would not be 
persecuted or harrassed for being conscientious objectors as 
long 
as they raised food for the army and didn't support the British. 
The Quakers agreed readily because "their objections did not 
carry over to making money" (laughter). 
family, history,

021: FARM VALUES AND COMMON SENSE IN LAND MANAGEMENT AND 
ENGINEERING: 
Up until 50 years ago we were an agrarian society, and 
this 
is one of our problems: we've gotten away from the farms, so 
that the values you learned on the farm aren't being carried over 
into the government or into the schools or 
into our everyday 
life. Because (at one time) even the people that lived 
in 
the 
city still had uncles and aunts who lived on the farms, and they 
still had the farm influence. And this made a big difference. . . 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 53 
. You learn to be self reliant when you're raised on a farm. And 
of course you know the value of a dollar. And one of my points 
is 
that most farmers know that water runs downhill, and I'm afraid a 
lot of engineers don't really realize that, because they bolux 
things up, and some of our old farm practices are better than 
some of these engineering ideas that we have . . . particularly 
in drainage. We have a problem in this very township because 
engineers do not understand our ecology or our conditions, even 
though we went to the trouble of getting the McHarg Study 
G—Medford; 18GT that points all of this out, but they don't pay any 
attention to 
it. They go by a book that's written for engineering 
practices in the state, and 
it applies particularly to North 
Jersey, and not necessarily to South Jersey. But here 
in this 
very township we have three parts of the coastal plain involved, 
so that what would be all 
right in the 
lower part of the township 
or 
in our sand and pine district will not be effective across the 
highway or 
in where it's basically marl and aquifer (Vincentown 
sand soil -- see Plate 2 in Pinelands Comprehensive Management 
Plan). So that we really should have three sets of standards for 
engineering and draining. The engineers will 
ruin us eventually, 
I'm afraid, 
if they don't wise up and pay attention to old Mother 
Nature. 
CC: What are some of the dangers, and the things they've 
done wrong, where the old farm practices would be better? 
ET: Well, one particular one involves the Pinelands . . . 
. we found when they studied the McHarg study that the small 
streams that come out of this sand area . . .are rather small for 
the amount of drainage area. And this 
is because it is sand 
country, and the sand absorbs the rainfall and then it comes out 
in 
the form of springs. If they keep on putting in drainage and 
running pipes into this, this size pipe, and bigger pipes 
downstream and so forth, they'll eventually overload the small 
stream valleys . . . and you'll have flooding, which some day 
Cherry Hill 
is going to enjoy. (Cherry Hill developers used to 
fill 
in stream valleys, which 
is crazy: where there is a stream 
valley there will be a natural path for water and you can count 
on water flowing where the stream valley used to be.) 
water, 
conservation, technology. 
093: Medford Township used "regular farm drainage tile" to 
alleviate flooding along one of 
its roads. 
If done according to 
standard engineering practices it would have cost $50-60,000. 
They did 
it for under $5,000. Have pipe running constant clear 
water, so when it rains the area is drained to four feet down, 
and rainwater no longer stands on surface and floods but sinks 
into soil. This done around 1976. Foreman on road crew was an old 
farmer and understood traditional methods. System has worked very 
well. Drainage is pure water because it has been allowed to 
percolate through sand before drainage into lake; this a standard 
farming technique that is not used by engineers.

to have a good many thousand acres to support a tractor business

165: ET grew up on farm that used to be where the Echelon 
Mall 
is now. 
"I don't want to go back." Sight of 
it 
is too 
painful. "That's supposed to be progress, you know." 
180: FARM VALUES G—Medford; 18GT: SELF—RELIANCE: 
Boys growing up on a farm, and girls too, they first of all have 
to 
learn to play on their own, at the very beginning, but then 
very quickly they start being involved in the work on the farm, 
and they learn these various things that they have no opportunity 
to 
learn 
in the cities. They learn to make do with what they 
have, basically. The army used to 
love to get the farm boys 
because they were used to hard work and long hours, and they 
would be able to do things that they were told to do, and they 
would do them repeatedly. 
193: Alice Tomlinson recalls that she used to take the farm 
cats up 
in the hayloft and dress them up 
instead of dolls 
G—Medford; 18GT. You learned to care for animals and to milk the 
cows. You put a strap around cow to prevent kicking. Used three— 
legged stool. 
children, games. 
207: Ephraim Tomlinson notes army didn't want attorneys 
because they always wanted to know the reason for an order. Lot 
of 
local 
lawyers wound up 
in Navy, which liked having people 
reason things out for themselves. Statuses often reversed in 
services: guy on garbage truck would be top sergeant, and Ph.D. 
would be cleaning latrines. Feels that war has lost all meaning 
and value since Caesar's time; once it worked to eliminate the 
weak and leave the strong. "But now you take your very best and 
kill them off." Wonders what kind of country we'd have 
if 
so many 
young Southerners had not been killed; he has been studying Civil 
War and there were lot of excellent men killed. Medford has

states are grossly underrepresented in state decisions due to 
differences in population density. government, insider/ outsider. 
310: Veterans of Foreign Wars G—Medford; 18GT invited him out 
every time they have a dinner, though because he 
lost a leg when 
young he was not drafted. They have a Base Commanders' Dinner 
once a year and get a good crowd. Ask him to come because when 
they started out they didn't have a building, and came to him as 
mayor and he arranged for them to get land and a liquor license. 
They built the building themselves and 
it can seat about 100. 
They go to the VFW breakfasts they hold first Sunday of every 
month "because it's one of the places that you know the people 
that come 
in, whereas we go other places and we don't know these 
new people that are coming in any more." 
armed forces, voluntary 
organizations. 
338: New residents in Medford "have joined with us: they 
came here because they liked us and accepted our ways, so the old 
timer in Medford was not overrun by the newcomer, as happened in 
so many other places." This seems to maybe be starting now, 
though, and he 
is kind of worried. Hopes the preservation of 
trees and old buildings will not be overturned. Examples of 
preservation: police station used to be railroad station; library 
was bus garage; courthouse was a cranberry house. 
insider/ 
outsider, architecture, conservation. 
So, for years, the people that came here, we had a mixture 
of people: the older people that had been here for a long time, 
and the new people joining in. And they got along pretty well 
here. Of course, now the new people greatly outnumber the old 
people, and I finally concluded what's an "old timer." . . . You 
see, when I came here, unless you were born here, you could live 
here 20 years and still 
be a newcomer. And maybe even almost a 
lifetime, 
if you weren't born here. But that has changed, and an 
old timer is somebody who has lived 
in the community more than 
half the time of the majority of people. In other words, 
if half 
the people in Medford have lived here five years, somebody that 
has lived here six years 
is now an old timer. . . . And you hear 
people talk about they're an old—time resident of Medford, and 
they've been here six, seven years. But they have been here 
longer than fifty per cent of the population, so that makes them 
an old timer.

family has been around since before Revolution.

is a local group of women that sews and 
collects clothing to give to the American Friends' Service 
Committee in Philadelphia. Other women's groups include the 
Hospital Auxiliary and senior citizen groups. About 50 groups 
altogether meet at Community Center, organized by Ephraim T 
Tomlinson and others. The Center is almost a Colonial house, 
slightly younger than colonial times. Library is solid walnut and 
put together without any nails. Started by a soldier in 
Guadalcanal who sent back ten dollars to "start something" 
in 
town, and they got it all 
paid for in two years flat, 1945-47, 
with a population of 2800, 
in wartime. They sold shares in 
it to 
safeguard the common investment in case the project failed. 
G—Kirby's Mill; 18GT was a similar purchase, and now belongs to the 
historical society. 
women, voluntary organizations, religion 
TX02: (068:) Kirby's Feed Store supported primarily now by all 
the horse—owners there are now in township: 
lot of people have 
bought horses recently. Dairy farmers also buy from them. 
Homeowners buy salt for their water conditioners and bird feed 
for wild birds. They used to grind flour, wheat and buckwheat: 
"they had special flour that was very good" about 50 years ago. 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 57 
They buy some field corn and soybeans and grain from local truck 
farmers. Story about fire 
in feed mill "That's how good the fire 
company is, cause that thing caught fire one night. And . . . a 
feed mill 
is a highly flammable thing: you've heard of silos and 
things exploding out west. This thing caught fire and they had 
the fire right in 
the middle of 
it: 
it was probably from an 
electric motor that started the thing. It was while Rotary 
G-Medford; 18GT was going on one night. Everybody rushed out, and 
the firemen got there, and they were 
still open for business 
the next morning. Put the fire out 
and never got...I never 
saw anything smoke like that and 
still not break lose. We had 
to be careful 
'cause you were afraid at any moment the thing 
might really blow up just like some of them do." Really bad 
smoke. Town endangered. 
TX03: (097) He's an original Rotarian. Started in 1939. Some 
people didn't think it would last. He has 100% attendance since 
1940, 
longest in Rotary. Meets every week, group of professional 
men. Rotary history and concerns. The club sponsors the Halloween 
parade in Medford 
which gets 25,000-50,000 visitors. Only one 
left 
in south Jersey, used to be a lot after World War II. A big 
show, at night, 1000-1200 people 
in the parade, 50 floats, bands, 
fire companies. "It's quite a show." Other big show, an auction 
in June, raises $5-6,000 for youth groups. Foreign students for 
summer. One now is from Turkey. Exchange programs. Thinks it's an 
important program; show people how they are alike and different. 
voluntary organizations 
TX04: (155) Immigrants in the U.S. Ephraim objects to having to 
speak Spanish in some areas "because I think if they're going to 
be 
in America they should speak our language just as 
if we go 
someplace we have to 
learn their language." Doesn't like the dual 
status of the Puerto Ricans, thinks it 
is really bad 
in Miami. 
"When you're 
in America who should be an American, and when 
you're in Spain you should be a Spaniard." In Camden, 
in the 
courthouse, everything is 
in English and Spanish. Puerto Ricans 
that came after World War I didn't need that. Puerto Rico has 
special status.

TX05: (179) Library. Raised money. Old bus garage. Book sale last 
Saturday raised $660, $90 off of food. Need to expand. (188)

TX02: G—Wharton Tract; 25GT state took over. Lost taxes for 
townships. As tax assessor he tried to get congressman to do 
something to reimburse the communities. State only paid 10 cents

reimbursing a little. People stopped paying taxes. Good land 
is 
worthless. In Wharton Tract, can't get down roads, no 
maintenance. Four—wheel drivers and motorcycles. Selling pulp 
wood. Tractor trailers. Big holes and gullies. Used to take 
Sunday afternoon drive there.

TX03: Pinelands Commission is good but 15 years too late. Wished 
it had started years ago. (150) If earlier would've kept 
development down. Future generations need land to build on. 
People come in from Camden and Philadelphia, they're here and 
want to slam the door. Oldtime residents not against preserving 
the Pinelands but want to have space for their grandchildren. 
Circumstances of old original families. "At least for the 
original settlers here I think their children ought to be able to 
live 
in the land that their grandfathers owned at one time or 
another." Son's problem with building on 
less than 39 acres. 
TX04: Another example. New bakery built in G—Medford; 16GT. Seven 
new stores. Had all 
the approvals except septic design. Dry 
spell, effect on water table. Malfunctioning septic systems. 
Improper percolation. 
TX05: Subdivisions in G—Tabernacle; 25GT. He got permits and 
designs for lots before Pinelands Commission; others now have to 
get $5000 septic systems. Designs and renewals. He came up the 
hard way, worked for federal government. 
"What I've got I got on 
my own. I didn't get it from somebody else. My father gave me the 
whole world to make a living 
in, that's what he told me when I 
graduated from high school." 
Legal conflicts. Subpoenas. (268) 
Acquiring land for son's property. 
He's a fisherman. Commission

it wouldn't reject proposals from natives, born and raised

like the Commission tries to

Roger Brick, owned bogs, 
lived at Moore's Meadows. Gave his boy 
Norman an acre for a wedding present. Pineland said they need 2 
1/2 more. He got it and got approved to build

is more into the core area than his (Yates's) son's

TX01: Mrs Yates' family's summer home on Rt. 206 in an area 
called G—Medford Farms; 25GT. No electric, or heat, or plumbing. 
Roam all

for church. Father's car would get stuck. Started going long way 
around on paved road. Memories. Met her husband watching him play 
baseball. Local girls called her the "wicked city girl." outsider

married the menfolk built a house 
in 9 weeks. 
TX02: How he got to be tax assessor. Wanted to be educated. Took 
courses at Rutgers and Glassboro State College. The Yates were 
the G—Tabernacle; 25GT assessors for 20 years. She became the one 
for Woodland too. Conflict between running for office and holding 
federal job. How assessor's job worked. Need to know township 
real well.

the community, the grandfathers tried to

TX01: Development. Water supply and septic systems. Abuses in 
G—Lebanon Lakes; 27GT. Aquifer, pollution. Pinelands legislation 
came down on everybody, detrimental consequences to natives. Give 
leeway, common sense versus letter of the law. Mr. Yates gives an 
example of this problem; his story include mention of sitting out 
in 
the woods and just listening to his dog run (chasing rabbits) 
at night. 
He was the second developer in Tabernacle. Bought 300 acres 
of woodland near Girl Scout camp around G—Old Friendship Mill; 
25GT. Used to 
ice skate there almost all 
year round. Started 
subdividing in 
1969. First asked for a riding academy, rejected 
by planning board because the land was zoned residential because 
it was high and dry, good percolation. Went back with another 
recreational use, rejected. Asked for landing strip, rejected. 
Asked for asphalt plant, rejected. Decided to subdivide. Was told 
he was selling too soon. Yates said, "a bird 
in the hand is worth 
two 
in the bush" and "it worked out that way." A surveyor from 
Easthampton felt the Pinelands act was coming, urged him to 
subdivide and get septic designs in. He 
is still selling lots. A 
lot of people weren't so fortunate, throughout south Jersey. Put 
people out of business, carpenters, electricians, manufacturers 
(wire, septic tanks, etc.). Put in good roads, " I believe in 
doing 
it one time and doing 
it good." He supervised. (113) Sold 
lots himself and through realtors. Good lawyer to handle 
settlements. He financed, knew what it was like to come up the 
hard way. He enjoyed helping people. One parcel on Fox Chase

He was oldest. Never had sense of boundary. Moved from field to

Story about people from metropolitan area, with a dog, 
camping 
in forest but didn't go to campground. Wife looking for 
dog, husband looking for them. Separated for several hours. 8 
hours wandering in woods, never more than 400 yards from 
campsite. Should've relaxed and heard road traffic. 3 A.M. before 
they came out of the woods. Didn't know where campsite, car was.

Not taught to find way 
in the woods G—New Lisbon; 21GT. 
Trial and error. Game--go in the woods and get lost, but do 
it 
in 
a sensible direction. Look at the sun, except if 
it's noon. 
If 
it's noon, go to sleep, Starting around 3 or 4 o'clock, that'll 
give you an idea. Stars, complicated, don't do much good. If 
lost 
at night, "remain calm, the tree frog won't eat you, you'll be 
alright." Keep cool, get quiet, you'll be surprised what you can 
hear. Look at telephone lines. Face the fact that you are lost. 
Just tell yourself that you'll get out and you will get out. 
You're leaving prints. Backtracking. Can determine you're going 
in a circle. Don't get in over your head. Go 
in 500 yards, then 
come back out. "Don't think you're Daniel Boone. Go to your 
limits." (131)

Plane flying overhead. "United States Air Force. We live 
with them. They live with us." 
He has general feel for area but doesn't mean he can't get 
lost. Dangerous swamps but have to work to get into that kind of 
trouble. Swamp at night is dangerous. Stay up on high ground 
until 
light. Open swamps are more OK. Muddy, wet. Others are 
deeper, trees knocked down, slipping, dangerous because you could 
easily break an ankle, 
leg, arm, have a problem. Don't do 
it 
alone. Nothing would come eat you. Some wouldn't like you "in 
their backyard." No need or interest to do that type of thing. 
"Why did you used to go out to the swamps?" "They were 
there." Swamps are unique. Don't fool with them in the summer--
mosquitos. They will not leave you alone. Tried to 
learn about 
the swamp, know them. Knew most of the terrain, including the 
swamps. Briars. (237) 
Inheriting land. When did he know he wanted to stay in area, 
in farming? Knew that early. Wanted to see other areas, but by 12 
or 13 he knew where home was. Didn't want to be 
locked in. 
All 
of 
them wanted to move around. Knew and loved area. Most of the boys 
he grew up with had to get out, 2, 
4, 5 years. Almost automatic. 
So you know what you want. He's attracted to mountains, 
especially with snow, so he can ski. Got out of service, wanted 
to be here, "that's where I went." Worked in city for a few 
years. Lots of travel, hustle and bustle, jets. Didn't want that 
type of 
life. Settled back here. Would be doing something here, 
with or without blueberries. In his grandfather's generation, 
in 
his blood.

This tape logged from a Marantz Superscope C-202LP 
cassette recorder by Elaine Thatcher on February 23, 
1984. 
000 Pick—your—own farms are growing 
in popularity. 
They work 
for the people that have the right locations and the right 
temperament to put up with that. 
Temperament is the key. 
When 
you have anywhere from 20 to 300 people, and you have a field 
that's ready to be picked, and you have to keep them in that 
field-- keep them from going into a field that's not ready. 
"Why can't I go over there--those look bigger, etc." 
The grower 
loses control of, 
"I will pick this field today." 
The 
pick—your—own operation is 
"I think I'll pick this field today." 
Once he sees he's got the people, then he can go with it. 
He 
can say, 
"I will pick this field today." 
But it's difficult. 
If 
it's real 
hot, your people won't come out. 
They'll come out 
in the rain -- it makes no difference. 
it seems to be the time 
of year that they come out. 
It's all 
in the temperament. 
The 
growers weed themselves out. 
They try 
it, 
and it's usually a 
pretty quick decision--no, I can't do that, or yes, I can do 
it. 
You have to be willing to put up with the parking and other 
problems. 
It seems that the attitude of the pick—your—owners is 
that they get a sense of worth by knowing what they're getting. 
They know it's fresh. 
It's a positive move. 
It started in 
California, and it's made its way here. 
Doing pick—you—own is certainly a pressure release from 
you daily operation. 
You have a buffer -- some flexibility. 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 74 
A lot of the farms also have daily picking by crews or whatever. 
They may depend on the daily operation and use the pick—your—own 
as a pressure release, or depend on the pick—your—own and vice 
versa. 
The flexibility is nice. 
You're not locked into one 
avenue. 
Whenever you can increase your ways of harvesting your 
crop, you're better off. 
Unless you know exactly what's going 
to happen. 
I don't think growers who do you—pick feel 
invaded by 
suburbia, because the key 
is that they've opened up to people by 
choice. 
If you opened up to pick—your—owners and have that 
thought, "Oh, my God, we're being invaded," well, Lord, take 
your sign down, and your invasion will stop. 
There's no criticism either way between you—pick growers and 
regular commercial operations. 
it's an individual decision. 
They're out there to harvest their crop 
in the best way they 
can. 
It's a good pressure release. 
i think most of the people who do 
it enjoy it. 
So far it seems to be working. 
100 
It will probably vary--some years will be good, some bad. 
We don't know that yet. 
At this point it seems to have leveled 
off. 
We don't know where it will 
go from here. 
It's the same 
with machine picking versus hand pickers. 
Different people do 
different things. 
it goes along with the setup of the farm, the 
availability, the location, the different crops and varieties 
they want to do. 
It's all based on 
individual taste and needs. 
I think it's smart to be flexible. 
It's the same for you--how 
do you want to write this story? 
You can use a tape recorder, 
notes, memory, telephone, all kinds of tools. 
It doesn't matter 
as 
long as the story 
is told 
in 
its proper context. 
The tools 
aren't the point--how is 
it 
in black and white? 
That's the 
point.

Farming, Marketing. 
The association started March 22, 
1927. 
Stanley Kovel (sp?) 
Elizabeth White, J.J. White. 
There were nine members. 
They started with the low deck, and that's when they (the 
berries were packed 
in quarts. 
Now we're into pints. 
It was 
through Elizabeth White that cultivated blueberries were 
started. 
She sent people out to get the biggest (highest) 
bushes, and pretty soon they were upright, and this is where 
we're at. 
Then it grew from there. 
The area was very adaptable 
to blueberries through the acidic ground and all. They 
propagated more, the volume increased, we found 
certain markets 
like New York and Boston, and 
it grew from there. 
That's a 
very brief synopsis. 
In 1943, this first platform was built 
back here. 
this here is a newer section which we built in 
'47. 
The 
low deck was built 
around 1943--the trucks needed a higher 
deck.

pints.

American eagle 
quilt, made in 
1976, by the Methodist 
church quilting group. G—Tabernacle; 25GT "We just do 
it because we 
all work together." Sent in box top and money, got top of quilt 
to embroider. Presidential seal and other patterns available from 
the Tide detergent company. Can't remember what she paid for top. 
Permanent press cotton, 
filling is thin polyester. Washes 
beautifully, does not 
bleed. Red into white. Company has process 
that takes it out. Has given embroidered quilts to her boys, half 
a dozen. Likes sheets as back, no seam. (65) Embroidered quilts 
usually come stamped with design. Can't wash 
it, would spoil 
pattern. 
Give each of the grandchildren a quilt as a wedding present. 
Rolling star pattern. Wanted quilting to match backing. Eight 
point star. Patchwork. 1982. Cotton with polyester filling. Does 
not like having a lot of polyester mixed with cotton. 13th quilt, 
used only for special company. 
Album quilt. Little squares in middle. 1849-1851. Names in 
each square. Little feather design around name, does not know 
what it 
is called. Border. 
No waste. Clothes into quilt pieces. (184) Some old prints 
are so pretty but not made today. Some colors fade faster. Cannot 
buy fabric to match old prints. 
Star of Bethlehem pattern, 
large star in middle. Something 
about a nine—patch box 
in corner. Large star covers most of quilt 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 82 
but smaller ones in corners. Straight and bias pieces of 
material. 
Back over front as binding. Lots of material that 
matches material 
in other of her grandmother's quilts. (254) 
1850s. 
Especially beautiful browns in old prints. She likes brown. 
If use brown in a quilt makes it 
look old—fashioned. 
Oak leaf and wheel. Lydia Evans' quilt (see PFP83—RCCO27). 
Probably bought material. Actual 
leaf as pattern. Like spinning 
wheel. 
A number of those patterns around, 
can find them in 
pattern books (321). More common back then but not in 
later 
years, could become so 
in quilt revival. 
Father's mother (Rachel Ann, Lydia's sister, for whom Rae 
was named.) died in 1904 or 1906. Rae's father was the one who 
called her Rae. Brother was named for her grandfather. 
Large 
family but no one could take the name down except her father so 
he named children after his mother or father. He was only boy in 
Braddock family. Rae's brother had boys. Granddaughter had a boy 
and named him Jesse, a family name. People try to keep names 
in 
the family. Last name of Braddock never used as middle name. 
Jesse a popular name all over these days. (396) Cycles of name 
popularity. 
Popularity 
of 
Rachel, 
a Bible 
name, 
same 
with 
Debbie/Deborah. Hear old names again. Rebecca. Unusual to see old 
names come back. Granddaughter, Dawn Melissa, calls her Little 
Missy. 
Artistic nature of quilting. Have to be. "If you are going to 
put something together why not make 
it beautiful while you're 
doing it rather than slap it together haphazardly' 
If poor, have 
everything as nice as they could. Today, take things for granted. 
People say, '"I wouldn't put up with that,' but don't realize 
that that's the way things were at that time." Hard for her to 
understand. (460) That's the way 
it was. Things were not as 
expensive as today. 
People got used to having more. 
Triangle quilt, red and white. Does not know name.

TXO1: People need to depend on themselves rather than government. 
Sometimes you need 
it but other times you hang in there. 
G—Tabernacle; 25GT Necktie pattern, the bow tie. She made it 
about 1970. Pieces of material people had given her. Sometimes 
she will buy new material by the yard. Tied together with plain 
blue polished cotton. Dark and light colors. 
Ties are all 
print 
because using plain background. If all 
plain neckties would have 
used bright print as background for contrast. Made it as a boy's 
quilt. Made it for her grandson, 
Dan. Old and new 
material, 
samples. 
Teaching quilting. Off and on. Basics. Applique. Does not 
solicit classes. Did a couple of years for YWCA in Medford and 
Moorestown. Teach them to make a pillow, something they can 
enjoy. Piecing, patchwork, plain quilting on back. Dove design 
with olive branch, 
lover's knot. Did not want to be away from 
home too 
long. Turned down high school classes, would mean going 
out at night for 10 weeks. Did not want to 
leave husband. Group 
from New Egypt came to her house for night class. 
Young girls 
and older women. Not from retirement communities, they have their 
own people. (89) 
Good for people to have something to occupy themselves with. 
Does not like to just sit. Eye problem prevents her from reading 
or sewing too 
long. 
"My hands have to be busy." Can accomplish a 
lot 
in the evening while looking at television. Has cataracts. 
Has bought kits to make quilt tops--Mexican star, (coop?) quilt. 
Mexican star, modern looking but old pattern. Kits--material 
is cut in strips, you have to cut them in sizes you need. Some 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 84 
kits are pre—cut. Pattern she always wanted to do. $58 for kit, 
then half price. 
Old—fashioned log cabin pattern is popular in kits. 
Delectable mountain pattern in pink gingham. Another church 
group 
made 
it for a minister. 
Blocks put together and then 
brought to her group for quilting. (156) Had never seen that 
gingham done before except for small children. 
Crib quilt. Real cute. Babar the elephant, rainbow. 
Tumbling block, pinwheel, make up pretty for baby's quilt. 
Applique takes longer than patchwork. 
Rose pattern. Like a rose window in a church, buds at 
corners. 
Tulip pattern. Flowers any color but green has to be all 
alike. A teaching piece. 
Corn, green represents husk, and yellow. Could be 
in a print. 
Cut a square, put in padding, folding into triangle, put four 
triangles together. Can make a whole quilt that way. 
At class she asks 
if they have quilts they would like to 
bring 
in. 
Gets 
to 
see some beautiful 
quilts. 
One 
was from 
Pennsylvania Dutch country. Beautiful. Sunflower pattern, each 
petal 
had 
extra 
piece, 
gathered 
at 
bottom, 
stuffed, 
three 
dimensional. Brown and yellow. Really beautiful. Beautiful shade 
of brown 
in background. 
(219) 
Whoever 
made 
it designed 
it, 
different type of sunflower than you mostly find. Older quilts, 
guess ages. Pennsylvania Dutch colors are surprising, so bright. 
At Hershey Park (Pennsylvania) fair she saw 
Hundreds of quilts 
hanging around auditorium. Every color. Auctions of quilts for 
hospital 
in Pennsylvania 
Dutch country every year 
in May. Always 
wished she could go. Very expensive. "But if you make a beautiful 
quilt and spend all 
that time it ought to be worth something."

Mother made dandelion wine. Grandmother was strict where that 
was concerned. Her name was Adeline Dixon. Bought this home from 
them 
when grandfather retired. 
Methodist. Braddock side was 
Quaker and Baptist. Did not know how much they practiced Quaker 
ways. Grandmother was very strict about alcohol. Did not tell her 
that medicine had alcohol 
in 
it. Vewy old—fashioned and strict. 
Strict with all 
the grandchildren. That was they way she was 
brought up. Worked hard, they all 
did. 
Family always been 
in truck farming. Some connections to 
blueberry and cranberry families. Husband and brother used to 
have 25 acres of blueberries in Chatsworth in 
late 1930s and 
1940s. Got out of 
in 
1950s. Sold the field. Now it 
is 
all grown 
up. 
(316) Gone back to nature. Gravel driveway is still there. 
Too hard, got sick. Still grow a few blueberries, fields so old, 
not producing. A lot of hard work--trimming in middle of winter.

Wooden container to hold pints. Had to be made in the winter. 
Cleaning up. People think just about picking, "but that is not 
the way 
it works." Have to work all 
year round--cleaning up, 
trimming, making boxes, done by hand. A lot of cold weather. 
Always had colored help. They thought it was not much work, just 
poicking. "People that don't farm have no idea of the amount of 
work that goes into producing the things they go 
into the store 
and buy...Just because you plant it doesn't mean it's going to 
grow. Doesn't mean you're going to get a crop. Means you're going 
to be out there working all 
the time if you're going to produce 
and get the best you're going to get from it. 
It just doesn't 
grow 
by 
nature.(362) 
It'll grow, 
but heavens knows how 
and 
whether it'll survive or not." 
People gripe about spraying corn. Do a little spraying but if 
you don't you will get worms and people object. A choice--take a 
few worms or you spray. Spray the husk, not the corn. They do get 
some worms. This year didn't spray at all. Not bothered right at 
first, but later in the season. Potato bug--can never get rid of 
it. A mess. Likes potato, pepper, eggplants, tomatoes. Can pick 
them off and spray, but they still come back. Hibernate in winter 
in soil. "It's real 
hard work, farming." 
Used to be just the two of them, now boys help. But they also 
hold down jobs, so only can help on weekends. Crops sold through 
coop. Sell them wholesale to coop. Tabneracle Farmer's Coop on

G—Tabernacle; 25GT 
The trucker used to come to us, then he 
told us we had to go to Hammonton (to market produce). 
The co—op 
came 
in about eight or ten years ago. 
They used to be over along 
the river. 
Then they came down here because there was Indian 
Mills and Tabernacle and Medford around here -- people who would 
bring their things. 
They take your corn or whatever, and then 
they sell 
it for you. 
By taking it over there, you have less 
expense. 
You don't have to send 
it to market. 
They only charge 
11% commission. 
The other places charge 15-18%. 
I don't know 
what New York charges now. 
Plus packaging. 
(Noise from handling 
mike stand.) 
Little cardboard crates are about $.36 apiece. 
Crates are $1.25 or so. 
Then when you're paying for having 
it 
gathered, and the fertilizer, seed, etc., you have to get a big 
sum for what you take to market. Marketing, 
farming, 
farm 
markets. 
If you have high school kids working for you, you pay the 
standard 
wage --$3.60 or so now. 
It runs you 
in 
the hole. 
That's why you see farmers cut things up sometimes. 
They can't 
afford to harvest it. 
Prices are too low. 
But then the consumer 
sees that the prices are too high 
in the store. 
The farmer has 
to pay for the help, their insurance, his own insurance, etc. 
Minimum wage and social security for the workers is expensive. 
These kids make pretty good money. 
But they work hard, even 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel

starting before school 
is out in 
the 
spring. 
Who else but 
children could work like that? A man with a family couldn't 
afford to do 
it. 
You have to keep an eye on them--sometimes you 
have to say a word to them about playing. 
We don't do any day 
hauling. 
Everything we do now is 
local or family. 
Our neighbors 
are the ones who hire the children like I've been talking about. 
They're good to the kids -- they give them a snack and a break in 
the middle of the morning and the afternoon. 
Labor. 
Now we rent most of our land out. 
We have a couple of acres 
of blueberries and a couple of acres of 
asparagus, and some 
sweet corn and sweet potatoes. 
My husband is 85 years old -- we 
don't need to keep this up. 
It's too hard for him. 
But we kind 
of miss the people coming in to buy things. 
@p) 
100 We've lived here 55 years, and you get to know lots of 
people who come back year after year. 
Some of the Ft. Dix people 
who plan to be here for a while come in and we get to know them. 
Armed forces. People will see our signs for blueberries or 
asparagus and ask 
if we have other things to sell, and 
if we have 
some, we'll sell them. 
Beans, tomatoes, burpless cucumbers, or 
something like that. 
We used to have pigs, chickens, a horse. 
But my husband 
is 
allergic to them. 
We got rid of them, and when we wanted a horse 
for the asparagus field, we rented one for a couple of months. 
The horse would draw the sled with the bushel boxes on 
it. 
The 
sled 
is 
lower than a wagon, and easier to work with. 
As they cut 
the asparagus, they laid 
it 
into the boxes. 
Then they'd bring 
the boxes in for us to pack out of. 
That's easier than carrying 
a basket with you as you cut.(a) 
Technology. 
We used 
to have 
Puerto 
Rican help 
all 
the time during 
asparagus and blueberry time. 
We stopped that because at first 
we got real nice people, but within a few years we were getting 
people who wanted to hang out in the tavern at night. 
They'd get 
into fights. 
We didn't like that. 
The last couple we had, 
somebody hired them away from us, and they left in the middle of 
the night. 
They were living 
in a house on our property 
It was 
a nice house. 
The inspector said we should rent it out to some— 
one else. 
It was a two room house -- we never had more than two 
men, that's all 
we needed because our boys (sons) lived at home 
and helped. 
The Puerto Ricans came out of the labor camp at 
Glassboro, and we usually liked to get the same ones back each 
year, but they eventually didn't come back, so we cut back on our 
crops. 
Family, Hispanic, architecture. 
They didn't speak English much. 
Some would learn quicker 
than others, though. 
200 One fella I felt so sorry for -- he didn't speak English, 
and his back hurt. 
He came to the house, and we gave him some 
Sloan's liniment and told him to rub 
it on his back. 
He rubbed 
it all over him, and he sweat the next day when the weather was 
hot. 
He had rubbed 
it down his legs, too, and it began to burn 
and sting. 
It was driving him crazy. 
I didn't laugh 
in front of 
him, but I really had to 
laugh. 
My husband told him to go and 
take a bath with lots of soap and water. 
He went back to work 
in 
the 
afternoon. Ed told him, "You don't work, you don't get 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 88 
paid." 
A lot of funny things happened. 
The day labor from Philadelphia -- a lot of them were good 
workers, and they kept their families that way. 
Some of the 
women brought their children with them on occasion. 
Others would 
only come to make enough to buy a bottle of wine. 
You had to pay 
them every night. 
You had to cash their tickets for them, and 
you had to keep good records. 
Usually they'd stop at the store 
in the morning on their way 
in, and buy a can of sardines, and 
that's what they had for their lunch a good many times. 
I didn't 
see hardly any that bought lunch meat. 
They'd buy a bottle of 
soda, and I don't know whether they bought rolls or crackers or 
something to eat with their sardines. 
They took their lunch 
right out in the field with them and ate when they felt like 
it. 
Of course, that really kept us going in the packing house. 
Lots 
of times we'd be walking around with a sandwich in our hands 
because they would be coming in with their trays. 
(foodways) 
They'd bring their own trays in unless the men were carting 
them out of the fields, and they'd give them the tickets for 
their berries, and they'd haul them in with the pickup. 
Most of 
the time, though, they brought their own berries up. 
Sometimes 
you'd catch some cheating -- they were mostly the younger ones. 
They'd put sand or leaves 
in the bottom of the box, then fill 
it 
up with blueberries. 
Of course, you'd catch it, because you'd 
dump the box to see what was 
in 
it. 
One young girl brought in a 
box with sand and leaves 
in the bottom 
of the box. There's 
always 
an 
overseer -- usually 
the driver 
of 
the truck that 
brought them. 
He went out and asked her why she did 
it, and she 
said, 
"I don't know." 
Sometimes we'd have a hundred people come in, 
and they 
didn't even know what bus they belonged on. 
We had to know when 
they cashed their tickets. 
The drivers usually came out before 
the season and contacted the farmers to see 
if you could use the 
help. 
From what they told me, they'd go along the street and 
pick up people. 
The regular people knew, and would be out to be 
picked up. 
Others were just picked up off the street. 
300 One woman was a maid 
in a house in Philadelphia, but she 
loved to come out in the country, so she'd come out and pick 
blueberries on her day off. 
She always came dressed up neat and 
nice. 
The others didn't care how they looked. 
Her name was 
Pauline. 
Some of them would stop and buy if they knew we had 
corn or something like that, on their way back to Philadelphia. 
Some of them came 
in their own cars, and they would stop and buy 
sometimes. 
Of course, 
if there were too many, then we didn't get 
home until too late. 
It's a lot of hard work all 
the way down 
the 
line. 
We always took our kids with us and put them in a 
playpen while we worked in the packing house at G— Chatsworth; 27GT 
We were with Tru—Blu when we had the big fields in Chatsworth. 
They would inspect the different berries for size. The different 
sizes went under different brand names. 
The big berries were 
graded as Crowns. 
The small ones were Greenleaves. 
They would 
fill 
the cup and count the berries. 
@Refrigerator or some other 
motor comes on.) 
It's amazing how many berries are grown around G— Hammonton; 
Cartwright--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 89 
11GT -- between there and Nesco and Green Bank, Pleasant Mills. 
The closer you get to Hammonton, the larger the blueberry fields 
on both sides of the road. 
They go way, way back next to the 
woods. 
Acres and acres of blueberries. 
A man that used to come 
here 
in asparagus time told us that they had twenty some machines 
just to harvest their berries. 
They had pickers besides that. 
We used to start all our blueberries from cuttings. 
It was 
about fifteen years after we got married that we got into the 
blueberry bit -- about 1936 or so. 
We were married in 
1922.
