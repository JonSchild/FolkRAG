Interview with Julie Newman 
 
0:00:03.4 Debbie Fant introduces herself and Julie Newman, interviewed at Julie’s home in 
Seattle, WA, on November 2, 2013.  
 
0:00:24.9 Fant obtains general biographical information.   
 
0:01:24.3 Julie is married, lives with her husband. They have two children, both grown. She 
moved to Seattle in 1978 to attend graduate school and stayed. She went to the University of 
Washington's graduate school, Department of Early Childhood Special Education. Specifically 
came out to go to school in that field. Julie went from New York to Wooster, MA, where she 
went to college and majored in Geography. Wasn't interested in being a teacher at the time. 
Never took education classes. She worked for a couple of years at an engineering company 
after college doing something "vaguely" related to geography. Then she met a woman through 
contra and square dancing who was a special education teacher who needed a teacher's aide. 
She went to work for her as a teacher's aide, did that for about two years. That was her 
inspiration for going back to school, because somebody she worked with was excited about 
teaching special ed. Julie had always been interested in changing the world, and that seemed to 
be a good place to start.  The money as a teacher's aide wasn't good, so she decided to go to 
graduate school.   
 
0:03:32.4 Julie got her first job after graduate school in Everett, WA. She was in her late 20s, 
spent all summer looking for jobs. She doesn't have fond memories of that. She ended up 
working in the Everett School District, about 20 miles north of Seattle. That was interesting--
being in the town in the early 1980s.  Someone from the East Coast moving to that small town. 
She was one of the only Jewish people in that school, and the people at school seemed 
interested in that. Eye-opening for Julie.  
 
0:04:25.1 She started teaching young children, ages 3-5, with disabilities. She did that in Everett 
for about 9 years, then had her first child and took a little time off.  Then she moved to Seattle 
Public Schools, closer to where she lives, and she's been there ever since.  
 
0:04:56.0 Julie wasn't interested in special ed at first, kids with limitations, what good would it 
do. That's probably an attitude that's out there. But Diane, her inspirational teacher, talked a 
lot about philosophies of disability, how sometimes we create disabilities if someone is short 
and we put an elevator button up high. You create a disability. If the button were down low, it's 
not a disability anymore. That started to pique her interest as something more than just 
teaching children but changing attitudes about disabilities. Diane had learned in a summer 
camp about different methodologies that could be used to teach kids, and kids could learn. Julie 
saw it as a challenge.  "Ah, you said they can't learn. Just watch! We can figure out how to 
teach them!" 
 
0:06:11.5 So it appealed to her as she got to know the kids, got to know the families in her first 
job. Realized they were just kids. It happens that sometimes your kids are more different, but

everybody's different. The whole job has to do with working with families. Helping them to 
accept and understand the kids. Helping them not to be afraid. Understand that it could have 
been their kid, but just wasn't. It appealed to her more philosophically than educationally.  
 
0:07:10.7 Julie thinks it's different in every state, but in Washington when you're doing 
preschool, kids are tested and if they have certain scores, they're eligible for what is now called 
"Specially Designed Instructions," something other than typical school. There was a federal law 
passed in the 1970s that mandated that all preschool children with disabilities were entitled to 
a free and appropriate public education. Each state does it differently. In WA everyone who is 
eligible is taught. Doesn't matter what the disability is. She's had kids who are very retarded--
which is a word not used anymore--very delayed in their development. Lot of kids with autism. 
Some of those kids are now in advanced gifted programs, but they still have autism. Some kids 
with language delays, Down Syndrome, sometimes they have diagnoses, sometimes just 
delayed. So in preschool they tend to call most children "developmentally delayed," but now 
there are a lot of kids who come to preschool with a diagnosis of autism.  
 
0:08:41.5 Anybody who's between 3 and 5 years old, and Julie likes that because the kids aren't 
being put in little boxes. Hard part is knowing the strategies that work for different kids. The 
hard part is what she finds challenging and interesting--otherwise it would be boring for her.  
 
0:09:05.7 Julie uses what she considers to be a general education curriculum, so she wants her 
classroom to look like a "regular quality preschool." Within that, they individualize to meet 
everybody's needs.  
 
0:09:22.9 She remembers that, back in Everett, a mom walked in with her little boy who had 
Down Syndrome, she was taking a tour and it was her first time seeing a preschool. She stood 
at the door and said, "Well, this just looks like a regular preschool."  And Julie thought "Yes! I've 
made it." That was her goal. Not everybody thinks that way, but she thinks it’s important 
because everyone is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Everybody gets a quality program, and 
if your kid needs more help, then he gets it.  
 
0:10:00.4 It’s been interesting to see the kids in the population. She had kids with autism way 
way back, but she knows a lot more about it and what to do with it than she did back then. The 
strategies that got her into special education, what was called "Behavior Modification" is now 
called Applied Behavior Analysis.  It's similar. It’s now one of the "in" strategies used to teach 
kids with autism, and when it started to become popular, she thought, "Isn't this what I started 
out doing?" All teachers do what works for your kids, no matter what you're told.  
 
0:10:55.6 Julie has 12 kids with disabilities. There's a contract that sets limits for teachers and 
for class size. That's helpful to the teachers. If there are too many kids, you can't do a good job. 
Her conditions of work are really important for the kids' conditions for learning, that's one of 
her big spiels these days. She has 12 kids with special needs in her class, but best practice is to 
have typically developing kids in your class also, to have a class that's mixed so that everyone 
can benefit and learn from each other. Unfortunately, it's not built into program structure.

Some years she's taught additional “typical” kids, she calls it "voluntarily overloading" herself. A 
number of teachers do it, though it gets harder because with bigger classes you don't get extra 
support or staff. You're doing it because you think it's right. She's had up to 17 in her class, 12 
with special needs, 5 "typical kids."   
 
0:12:16.2 Typical kids aren't perfect kids, sometimes they're called "peer models," but Julie 
doesn't like to call them models because they're just kids. Sometimes they spend the first 
month crying. It gives the teachers perspective on what's "typical."  
 
0:12:35.2 This year she has only two kids who are typical, because sometimes the class size gets 
too big and she gets tired. Some years are harder than others, depends on the kids and 
depends on their disabilities.  
 
0:13:01.6 Sometimes Julie has a child for 3 years. She had two kids who were really challenging, 
and she graduated them last year, and now she realizes how exhausting they were. It's the luck 
of the draw. She likes those kids, but it's exhausting. So the class size is 12 kids PLUS, depending 
on what she can do. She loves the typical kids.  
 
0:13:45.9 Julie has teacher's assistants, or instructional assistants. They try hard not to call 
them teachers' "aides." In all of the classes, they're really teachers. Julie knows more than they 
know academically, but they will have or will gain lots of experience. They're on their own with 
the kids, though Julie is always there. Now there are two assistants, which is new. Used to have 
one. Also have a speech therapist and physical or occupational therapist.   
 
0:14:34.4 In her preschool, those other teachers come into the classroom to work with the kids. 
Often there are quite a few people in the classroom, and sometimes it backfires because there 
are lots of bodies in the room.  
 
0:14:52.7 For the past four years, she's been in a beautiful building. A public elementary school 
building in what used to be the kindergarten room. But it's a gorgeous classroom with windows, 
has its own bathroom, has storage, and she even has a little office, which is unheard of for 
teachers. She feels lucky about that because space does make a difference. It's easier when you 
have an appropriate, safe, bright & cheerful environment for both kids and adults.  
 
0:15:56.4 Each year in August, Julie starts bugging her supervisors to give her a list of who's in 
the class. The phone just rings and rings because they're not at work yet, and that's 
problematic. Most teachers know who's in their class in August and send them letters, but 
sometimes she runs into roadblocks. As soon as she knows who will be in her class, she sends 
out a welcome letter to each child. Then she calls all the parents when the teachers start back 
to work. In the past she's done home visits, especially for new kids. Likes to see them at home, 
play with them a bit, get to know the kids and get to know the parents in their own 
environment. See the dynamics and physical space of the home, which helps her know how to 
help the child and help the family.

0:17:11.3 In preschool, they don't start with their kids the first day of school. They have two 
weeks where the regular schools have started, and she invites the families to come in in small 
groups with their kids. The parents can meet each other in a small group, talk to one another. 
One thing preschool parents are finding out, "I'm not the only one." They're dealing with grief 
and new information that their child isn't going to be able to go to the regular school. Some 
parents have found that out by having their kids kicked out of regular preschools because the 
teachers can't teach them or they're causing trouble. So the kids come into the classroom and 
the whole staff is there, they do little activities with the kids, show them where they'll put their 
coats. The parents relax when they see the classroom and meet the teachers. Julie has been 
fortunate to have wonderful assistants, which makes a big difference. She can always count on 
them. Sometimes parents are more comfortable talking to the assistants.  
 
0:18:30.0 At the beginning of the year, that's what happens. Then all the kids eventually come 
to school, and the school starts with not a full class. With preschool as soon as they turn 3 they 
can come into the school district.  So the fact that kids turn 3 all during the year means the 
classes fill up bit by bit. They'll get kids throughout the year until they're full. It's good to have a 
full class near the beginning of the year because everyone gets to know the routines and gets to 
know each other earlier in the year. This year she didn't have very many returning kids.  There 
are a lot of new kids. Julie is a big routine person, so this year they start their day with playtime. 
It looks like typical play but lots of kids need to learn how to play so it's an important and 
stressful time for the staff. It's less structured but they still have to structure it for the kids. The 
teachers want the kids to like school.  They teach the kids the routines and do as much fun stuff 
as they can. The kids can get the routines pretty quickly.  
 
0:19:51.9 Then the teachers start to do more individualizing of the programs. The kids have 
already been assessed. (interruption) Day starts off with play, because that's what the kids want 
to do when they come into this cool room. Then they transition to a group circle time where 
they sing songs, learn their names, count how many kids are there, introduce a theme they'll be 
focusing on.  The teachers use puppets, a flannel board, usually read a story. After that, this 
year, they go outside to play on the playground. They do that every day, rain or shine. Three's 
an under-cover area to play in when it rains. That play time is about 20 minutes, and they 
always bring towels to dry off equipment. Then they have a snack time, then a book time where 
all kids look at books. Then a small group time when they come to tables and it's a teacher-
directed activity. The kids don't have a choice with that, though they do with other parts of the 
day.  
 
0:21:44.7 At the beginning of the year they might bring out toys, and for preschool kids, "play" 
is how they learn. They embed lots of learning objectives into the play time, and that usually 
depends on the skills of the teachers. It's important to remember that every activity has 
opportunities for learning. There's small group time, music time, then they go home. The school 
district provides transportation for all the kids with special needs, so there are little busses with 
car seats or booster seats in them. Sometimes the parents pick up the kids. The day has all the 
components of a typical day, in different order depending on logistics of the program.

0:22:39.1 It's a 2-1/2 hour program:  They start at 8:30 am and end at 11:00 am. Many teachers 
then have an afternoon program that starts an hour later.  
 
0:22:51.0 Julie teaches a different class for kids with a diagnosis of autism in the afternoon. 
Those kids stay for an extra two hours a day to have a program that uses very intense strategies 
such as ABA, Applied Behavior Analysis, different strategies that have been shown by research 
to work best for kids with autism. They're trying to give those kids "foundational skills" to better 
participate in the preschool. The teachers may teach them how to imitate, how to observe, so 
in preschool with 12 or 15 kids, they're better able to demonstrate those skills.  She's done that 
for about 9 years now.  
 
0:23:48.9 Each year it changes whether there's a lunch period or not. Julie chooses to keep 
them for two hours straight after preschool.  Kids with autism often don't like to eat or they eat 
very limited foods. It's a learning time for them. This year Julie has two groups that come on 
different days.  
 
0:24:22.7 One group just eats.  They're fantastic eaters. For those kids, that time is used for 
teaching them about conversations, so they can talk to each other, talk to the teachers.   
 
0:24:37.6 The other group looks at their food and wants to run away. That's another problem, 
because Julie wants them to eat. It's a problem for the kids at home, too. They employ all kinds 
of strategies to get the kids to eat--sometimes just touch the food, lick the food. Recently Julie 
has had an iPad program that enables them to feed monsters. Julie has the kids use their 
fingers to feed the monster, then Julie says, "Now it's your turn." And sometimes they forget 
and take a bite because they've seen the monster eating. That makes it fun for Julie--thinking 
up something that might work.   
 
0:25:29.7 Lunchtime is an instructional part of the program. There's also a time when they're in 
the therapy room or "motor" room, which has tire swings, bikes, trampolines. That also is a 
break between sessions of their day but it's also instructional time.  They learn to take turns, to 
request what they want. The teachers create challenges for the kids so that it's motivating for 
them to do something different. Instead of screaming, here's another way you could do that.  
They might be showing the teachers a picture, might be pointing. The teachers help the kids to 
communicate better. For that class they come back into the preschool classroom and structure 
it differently. It's highly structured, with one adult for every one or two kids and they're in the 
kids' faces for the next couple of hours. It really works. It's a luxury to get their hands on the 
kids and teach them the skills they need to know to better access the rest of their lives. She 
tries to work with parents as much as possible.  
 
0:26:55.8 Julie has two jobs:  The first is called Developmental Preschool and the second is an 
Extended Day Program. The University of Washington developed the structure of combining the 
preschool with the more intense service delivery model.

0:27:15.3 Julie got her training after graduate school, through a grant. It's two separate jobs, 
which makes her day harder. If she had to give up one, she doesn't know which it would be 
because she likes both.  
 
0:27:33.3 She has two sessions in the afternoon, so the kids get from 4-6 hours of intense 
instruction, usually one-on-one.  
 
0:27:45.4 She tells parents it's not always fun, the teachers are in the kids' faces, but she thinks 
they like to come.  
 
0:28:12.9 Julie thinks the kids who attend developmental preschool are more challenging or 
have greater disabilities than in the past because we're now serving so many of those kids out 
in the community. Some kids don't attend and don't need a "self-contained" preschool. In 
Seattle and other places, the kids may be served in the community while attending HeadStart 
or a local community preschool. There's a program that sends teachers out to schools in the 
community. The kids who have greater needs will come to Julie's program. There are more kids 
with the label of autism. She's not sure they're that different from kids in the past, but she 
thinks more kids are being identified as autistic.  
 
0:29:42.2 Julie thinks she's seen fewer with Down Syndrome, doesn't know if that's luck or 
statistical. And there are always kids that are just delayed, and the teachers don’t know where 
they're going to go. It's hard to say what will happen to those kids.  
 
0:30:14.7 The toughest part of her job is the grownups. The job itself is physically very 
exhausting, especially preschool where the teachers are up and down all day, never sit down. 
Many kids aren't toilet trained, so the teachers change diapers. They're running. That's 
physically challenging, and no down time. Julie schedules in time for adults to use the 
bathroom, one at a time. It's very intense, also because so many adults are in the same room 
that Julie supervises. She tries not to boss people around, but you're communicating with 
people all the time. Your brain is going nonstop. That's a part of what makes it exhausting.  
 
The administration, in special education, in the Seattle School District, changes very often. Not 
much consistency, and the amount of support you get from administrators changes over time 
and you end up closing your door, doing what you can, using the resources you have. Most 
preschool classes with special needs kids are in regular schools, so you look to your school for 
help. But preschool isn't really considered part of the school. So the administration and the 
paperwork is exhausting. Sometimes the paperwork seems to be "busywork" that doesn't serve 
a purpose. So the school district can come under fire for not doing the paperwork correctly, so 
that comes down on the teachers, who then have to go to more and more workshops that still 
don't teach you how to do the paperwork correctly. That's draining. That's a common reason 
for leaving teaching--can't take the paperwork anymore. And lack of support from 
administration. Hard when you need resources, something that doesn't cost money, and you 
can't get the support.

0:33:15.8 Julie has been lucky and proactive to keep her association with the Special Ed 
Program at UW. She's kept up relationships with professors and staff, so she's been able to 
have student teachers. She enjoys that.  Julie likes to talk, and it's nice to have student teachers 
that she can mold in her image and send out into the world. That's satisfying.  She's always had 
interesting, competent teachers. She can also get people to come out from the UW to help 
when she’s needed advice. That keeps her intellectually stimulated. 
 
0:34:16.8 Biggest change in theory of how to teach special needs kids: it's pretty much come 
full circle. Different theories go in and out of practice. Julie was at a workshop where they were 
talking about a general education curriculum, and she thought, "Well, it's about time you got 
back to this. It's what I've been doing for 20 years." She was trained in it a long time ago. She 
almost doesn't know how to answer the question because she's always done what she thinks is 
right for the kids. But they're going back to providing developmentally appropriate classrooms 
for kids, not teaching them rote skills but providing a rich environment with opportunities for 
learning. Strategies for kids with autism have changed, become more in vogue. Old strategies 
have a different name now. Using those strategies more consistently, the ABA strategies more 
consistently, "floor time," RDI, DRI, all kinds of acronyms. There's more information about 
teaching kids with autism, but all good teachers take what works and take as much of an 
eclectic approach as they can. Not many mandates in elementary school, which is good for 
experienced teachers. Not as good for teachers who don't know what to do, though.  
 
0:36:29.6 Preschoolers with disabilities were not in school before the 1970s. There were 
nursery schools for typical kids. People with means sent their kids to nursery schools, and there 
were Head Starts. In the 70s, when Julie was in Boston, some of the Head Starts had kids with 
disabilities. She applied for a job in a Head Start that had kids with disabilities, and that was 
something new. But a law was passed in the 70s that mandated preschool programs. What she 
did back then looked very different from what she does now, but not because they were 
mandated to do things. They just didn't know the environment in which kids with special needs 
could be educated, the "least restrictive" environment, it's called.  
 
0:38:18.8 Sometimes Julie thinks back on the students she had when she first started out, and 
she wasn't a bad teacher but she knows more now. Her ability to look at kids and see what their 
needs are, what their functional needs are, is better now. It may be related to her having her 
own kids and have a perspective on that. But also because she's had so many kids in her classes 
over the years. In the past, she would have used strategies more like the ABA strategies 
employed now. She wishes she could get a second chance with some of those kids.  
 
0:39:16.3 One frustrating thing, when kids leave preschool and go into "the big world of 
elementary school," that's very stressful for the families and for the teachers. In preschool, 
they're all with their age peers. The teachers differentiate the instruction depending on the 
child's needs. They compartmentalize the kids more in elementary school. It's a hot topic of 
conversation. The school district says they don't do that, but Julie thinks they do.  They divide 
up the kids, and you see kids that you worked with for three years who could be successful in 
the environment that you set up, and then they go and flounder. The teachers then call Julie

and complain. It's frustrating. It's discouraging. Sometimes she has to close her eyes and walk 
away. She’s been in the middle of a situation recently where she tried to help and it wasn't 
appreciated. The parent wanted help, but the teacher in elementary school wasn't interested. 
So she just hopes that it works. She can't fix everything. That's been very stressful.  
 
0:41:02.7 She also has stressful kids, but she's been able to get help. It's exhausting but also 
challenging, and jobs should be challenging.  
 
0:41:31.0 For a child who really doesn't communicate, doesn't have very many functional skills, 
they want to work on a foundational skill imitation. That's how kids learn, from imitating 
others. Kids with autism are often paying attention only to themselves. You want to bring them 
out. Julie might start by asking them to do what she does, or match things that are the same to 
notice the qualities of things that are different out there.  To begin making those judgments. 
They're content doing what they've always done, so Julie looks around to find what will 
motivate a particular kid. Could be a certain kind of toy, Thomas the Tank Engine, might be a 
potato chip. It might be flashy toys.  
 
They look around. The first thing they try to do is find a "reinforcer," something that a kid will 
change his/her behavior in order to get. The goal is to say, "You're going to do this really boring 
thing for me, and I'm going to help you and teach you, and then I'll give you something that's 
cool." Because they don't care about the boring thing, they care about the cool thing. Over 
time, you want to fade the cool thing and say, "Hey, this wasn't too bad, right? So when you do 
what I do, it might be more fun that you were originally thinking." There's a little backlash 
because "you're treating kids like robots." But by doing that you can start to get their attention, 
and that's what you want to do. Show them the cool world out there. They finally start doing 
more and noticing more. That's for a kid with big challenges.   
 
For other kids, you might say, "Wow, that's pretty cool!" (Julie uses an enthusiastic tone of 
voice.) She says it's all in HOW you say it:  "COME ON!  WE'RE GOING TO GO AND PLAY WITH 
BLOCKS!!!!!!" And the kids begin to do the activity.  That becomes the reinforcer for the kid, 
and that's ABA. The misunderstanding of ABA is "I'll give you an M&M." She says she wishes it 
were that easy, because many of the kids don't want to eat. M&Ms are her favorite when she 
can use them. But you need to use something exciting to motivate the kids, to choose what 
they like. The teachers help them to choose what they like, using an external reinforcer until 
they can find their own internal reinforcers. They also help them connect to their environment. 
That's the practical use of Applied Behavior Analysis.  
 
 0:45:41.8 She goes to work, she gets paid. That's her external reinforcer. She doesn't know if 
she'd do the same job if she didn't get paid--she likes the external reinforcer. With everything in 
education you have to use your judgment, that's the biggest key to being good at working with 
kids. Use your judgment to make practical and functional decisions, not always go by the book.  
Use your intuition, your experience to make those decisions.

0:46:26.7 Julie thinks the adult part of her job is emotionally draining. In the old days, she'd 
come home crying. Not that the kids were hard, but she didn't know what to do about the kids 
being hard. Frustrated by not having resources. Part of challenge was to take a breath, write it 
down, "what could you do about it?"  That part was emotionally draining. But over the years, 
she's frustrated but she handles it differently. She doesn't come home with it, unless there's 
something serious that happens to kids, like cancer. Those are hugely emotionally draining. But 
the job itself, the kids don't drain her, it's the adults and frustrations of not being able to do 
what you want to do. 
 
0:47:42.3 One of the rewarding parts is getting parents to open up and to laugh with their kids 
and appreciate other kids and feel a little bit more relaxed that there is a place for their kids 
that will see the good that their kids can do, will tell them positive things. That counterbalances 
the drain. Julie thinks that being older gives her more perspective that things will be frustrating 
but she will be able to solve them, or avoid them, or ignore them, and then move on. 
Emotionally it's easier, but physically it's harder for her.   
 
0:48:54.3 Julie doesn't see her job in terms of breakthroughs. More what happens is that they 
develop plans for kids each year--individual education plans. Some of that paperwork is good 
because you're looking at their present skills, where they're at, and you determine where 
you're going to go. When the kids are first in school, you don't know them well and your reports 
are just reports. They're writing goals based on kids they haven't met. Often who they are in 
person is different from their initial evaluation. So after a year, when you sit down with the 
families to develop the plan for the kid, you're surprised that this is the same kid:  "Wow!  Is 
this the same kid?  They can do all these things now." You look back, and they're doing so well. 
That's a good point for the teachers and for the parents. She finds satisfaction from letters that 
she gets from parents, at holidays or when the kids are leaving the program. Often the teachers 
don't realize how much they mean to parents, that they might have been the first person to say 
something positive about their child. They're grateful for what the teachers have done. That's 
the most satisfying time, and she saves those letters.  
 
As teachers they don't get much feedback. Kids disperse because of how the special ed 
population all goes to different schools, so the teachers don't run into the kids often. The kids 
don't come back often. What the teachers get from the parents is the most feedback. That's the 
greatest feedback, from the families and from looking back and seeing how far the kid has 
come. They don't "cure" kids, but they all make progress. The ones who go off into the general 
education kindergarten program, that's great. The other ones, the teachers hope they get the 
support they need. That's the part she doesn't always like to think about. It changes each year 
about what becomes satisfying.   
 
0:51:45.6 She does remember the little guys who she'd had for three years. At group circle 
time, when they first came in at age 3, they weren't interested. Both had autism, wanted to do 
their own thing. The teachers held them in their laps, gave them toys. Next year gave them 
little chairs to sit in. By the third year, she remembers that they put out all the little mats for 
kids to sit on in circle time and the two guys sat down on their mats.  Just sat down on their

mats. It was a miracle! They didn't fix those kids, but after three years of trying they came and 
sat down for the circle time. That was amusing and satisfying moment.  
 
0:52:33.8 Julie is in the Seattle Education Association, that's her union. That's the local. 
Washington Education Association, part of the National Association Education. She grew up in 
the East Coast where it was the AFT, in WA State it's the NEA.  
 
0:53:07.7 Julie comes from a union family, so she's a union supporter. She thinks the union 
hasn't been as supportive in many cases as she'd like, they do pay dues that add up to a lot. The 
union is helpful in contract negotiations, obviously the biggest thing. The biggest benefit she's 
gotten from the union. She feels like they haven't been as responsive as many of the teachers 
would like to the needs of special education teachers. It's been frustrating to ask questions and 
not get responses.  She hears people saying, "We pay them so much money.  Why can't they 
respond to us?" She's sure there are all kinds of reasons, lots of other union issues, but 
sometimes they're not as proactive as she'd like them to be in support of some of the issues. 
It's changed over time. It changes with who the school district leadership is and sometimes 
there's different relationships with the union. Julie thinks they should all be working for the 
same things, but that's not always the case. Julie is definitely glad there's a union. She has 
colleagues who do not belong to the union, and they don't talk about it that much, but she 
makes remarks when they get their medical benefits and increased paychecks. The union serves 
a big role for the teachers, just not as active as she'd like.  
 
0:55:11.4 When Julie is asked what she does, she says, “I'm a teacher, and I teach young 
children with special needs. Special ed teacher. That's a more common term.” They like to use 
"people-first" language, so she says, "I teach children with special needs." Children first, who 
happen to have special needs. She likes that, it fits with what she likes to do. She's a pre-school 
teacher, and often that brings up another response from people, "Oh, you're a preschool 
teacher, you must play all day." And they have to proselytize, and say, “Yes, we play, but that's 
how children learn." Even in their own schools there's a lack of respect for preschools. So when 
you're preschool AND special education, "That's the lowest of the low." She posts things in the 
school hallway talking about their curriculum, their objectives, their professional development, 
so that people know that they're "real teachers." So she says Teacher, Young Children, Early 
Childhood, Kids with Disabilities, then Special Ed teacher. She's always trying to preach.  
 
0:57:05.7 Julie doesn't think there's a difference in what she does compared with other 
teachers, though there is the perception of a difference. They see where the kids are at, they 
assess the kids, they try to take them from one point to another. The biggest difference is they 
have to differentiate a lot more. She can't just present one lesson, she has to individualize it for 
every single kid. But teachers of older kids, everybody does the same thing. That's a pill that the 
teachers of the older kids don't always see that they're the same. If they were to walk in each 
other's shoes, they'd have more of a perspective.  
 
0:57:56.2 The components of effective teaching are the same for any age kids. It may not seem 
that way for preschool but it absolutely is the same.

0:58:18.1 Julie is not a fan of using computers very much in the classroom. Kids get a lot of time 
doing that at home. Preschool kids learn from touching things. If there are other ways of 
learning, most of them, even the poorer kids, the kids who have fewer resources, they almost 
all have parents with a phone they can play with. She uses iPads for kids with autism because 
they're motivating, and there are interesting things you can do with the iPads. Other than that, 
she doesn't use much technology other than CD players. She hasn't even transitioned to her 
iPhone for that yet. She still has tapes, books on tape and old tape recorders, which work fine. 
As for paperwork, the technology has made that easier. They have lots of forms online, that's 
easier. She also uses email to communicate with parents. That's made things a lot easier. 
Handwriting notes is time consuming, and communicating is essential. So it's easier to go to the 
computer and write a few lines.  
 
0:59:54.4 the other day she sent a beautiful photo of a little girl to her mom, said, "Oh, I just 
couldn't resist." The parent loved it. That helps in the teaching in the relationships. Also 
showing slideshows with computers makes things easier. She uses technology more outside of 
the classroom than in the classroom. It's useful, particularly with kids with autism. Buy touching 
and seeing and feeling things is the best way of learning for young kids.  
 
1:00:59.0 Julie loves her job, but she's also getting close to saying she's done. Thirty years is a 
long time to be down on your knees. She'd recommend teaching special ed, or teaching in 
general, to people who try it out and see if it's something you'd really like to do. Before going 
back to school, work as a teacher's assistant. Because you have to like it. If you just think you 
like it, that's not good. One of the important parts of the job is what she can communicate to 
people like the interviewer, to her neighbors, when they have expectations of what she does 
and it's really different. 
 
 She wants to tell people, "They're just kids, and we have to treat people more respectfully. We 
have to treat people differently. We all have differences, and that's okay." It's important to be 
in the public schools and have parents of other kids get to know them, especially when they'[re 
in preschool and everybody's still cute. Get to know the kids then, then maybe more support in 
the community later for people with disabilities. That's still one of the big reasons she stayed in 
the field, working with adults is an incidental effect you can have. Either other teachers or 
community members. It's hard work, but it is challenging. Challenging jobs are good jobs.  
 
1:03:23.4 Julie thinks she's had a couple of days in the past week that she just stood and looked 
around and said, "Wow! Every body's engaged. I can actually take a minute to think of what 
everybody needs to be doing. I can maybe teach.” That alludes to the fact that often in the 
classes they're so busy, there's so much happening, she can hardly see the forest for the trees. 
Keeping people safe, making sure other people can do their jobs. She enjoys it when she can 
get down there with a kid and see good things happening. Kids being engaged, talking to each 
other. That's something that she likes to see, everybody wants to see. It lasts for maybe a few 
minutes, maybe a few days.  It comes and it goes. Julie feels basically that she does a good job. 
In recent years she's gotten positive feedback from people outside. But she doesn't think

there's one moment that you say, "I've done a really good job." There are moments when you 
feel satisfied that things are going like you'd like them to go. That's the good feeling.  
 
1:05:04.7 At the end of the year she's really happy that it's summer. She does NOT work in the 
summer. It takes teachers a long time to recover from the intensity of the year. She carries 
home bundles of things every day she should be doing, maybe she does them, maybe not. 
Always something that should be done. Every Sunday at a certain time she says, Oh, no.  
 
I need to plan, I need to get ready. It's nice at the end of the year for Julie as a teacher to say, 
"I'm done for a while." Sometimes she says she's really done, but in September she's usually 
ready to go back. It's sad to see some of the families go. She looks forward to summer. All the 
teachers take classes in the summer, but there needs to be a period of time when she has no 
input from anywhere and can do what she wants to do.
