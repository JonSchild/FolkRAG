Introductory comments. Name. Place of interview. Marilyn is from 
Spring Green, now living in Hollandale, both in south central Wisconsin 
Now teaching in Monroe School District: visual arts in the high school and gifted 
& talented coordinator for the district 
 
00:01:30 
Marilyn was born in Richland Center, Wisconsin on 
 
1954.  It was a snowy night with carolers in the hallway.  Mom says, “You were 
brought into this world with angels singing.”   8:20 in the evening. 
 
00:02:20 
Her fathers’ parents are from the Prague area of Czechoslovakia.  
They identified as Bohemians (not Slavs).  Her mother is 6th generation of 
Wilkinsons; English with a little smattering of lots of other backgrounds too.  
Machotka is the Bohemian family name. Her paternal grandmother came to the 
U.S. at age 13.  She fell in love with a man on the boat but her parents forbade 
that relationship; instead, they made her marry a foreman (Machotka) in Avoca, 
Wisconsin, a forced marriage. 
 
00:04:07 
Marilyn grew up on a dairy farm on the other side of the Wisconsin 
River, between Lone Rock and the Bear Valley area, toward Spring Green 
among beautiful vistas overlooking the river; it was not unusual to see eagles and 
bobcat.

Her first school, for Kindergarten, was a house in Lone Rock. Then 
she went to a one-room schoolhouse called Seaman School on Hwy JJ outside 
of Gotham.  There were 18 students total, 3 first graders; Mrs. Harper was the 
wonderful teacher. She would ring the school bell out the window when it was 
time to come in from recess.  Marilyn has fond memories; it was students 
teaching students; when Mrs. Harper was busy with the 8th graders then the 3rd 
graders would help the 1st graders with math. There were no 2nd graders.  It was 
like a big family. There were memorable Christmas celebrations; parents would 
come in and listen to them sing along to the piano and show the project they’d 
made, often a coloring book of their life. It was an interesting community.  
 
00:05:54 
Do you see a connection between that type of schooling and your 
educational philosophy today? 
 
00:06:09 
She endorses the philosophy of students teaching students, and 
the idea of community ownership in a school district. This is easier in small 
communities and smaller school districts.  In larger ones, it’s more challenging to 
look at that school as ‘yours.’  But there is definitely a sense of ownership and 
‘we’re all in this together’ in the smaller districts she’s taught in. 
 
00:06:50 
And your next school? 
 
00:06:54 
For three years, in 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades, she went to Dickson 
School, a two-room schoolhouse in Bear Valley.  Very rural, played on the 
hillside during recess.  Getting muddy and dirty was Phy Ed.  Public radio 
provided music and art programs. Sometimes a traveling teacher would come in 
and talk about the arts.  But it was mostly academics.  There were two teachers, 
each with their own room.  They had split classes and they taught everything.  
 
00:07:58 
In 5th grade, she went to Lone Rock.  Each school she attended 
was larger, which meant that the smaller schools were closing. Her earliest 
schools closed. In high school, she went to River Valley School in Spring Green.   
 
00:09:32 
After high school? 
 
00:09:35 
She wanted to be an architect like Frank Lloyd Wright, the 
hometown architect.  She was always amazed that in the four years of high 
school, none of her teachers ever talked about Mr. Wright.  He was very 
interesting. Out of school, she discovered a network of architects he’d associated 
with. And that fascinated me.  I really wanted to be an architect. I met a few 
people through Taliesin and found my way into that world. But as she got further 
into that world and her higher education, she didn’t like many of the classes. She 
liked descriptive geometry but not so much the engineering and chemistry. She 
went into art instead and did the art studio classes.  I absolutely loved it and 
found people like me. That was at UW-Milwaukee.  Her parents reminded her 
that she needed a job so to appease them she went into Education as a back-up.

00:11:38 
Her father was an educator, as was his brother and her mom’s 
seven sisters.  Her brother and sister are educators.  It was a natural fit.  In the 
Education classes, she found she loved kids. She hadn’t expected that.  The 
education classes helped her decide. It isn’t just the architecture; it isn’t just the 
art; it’s about people. She transferred to Platteville to get a degree more quickly 
with an internship.  She went there for her last year and did an internship in 
Wisconsin Rapids for one semester. An internship means that she was paid and 
taught with no cooperating teacher in the room.  100% of you on stage with those 
kids the first time through. I learned. I learned a lot.  She taught middle school – 
7th graders.  It was that principal that got her her first job. 
 
00:13:27 
So when did the five-year plan end?  When did you graduate? 
 
00:13:30 
1978.   
 
00:13:40 
And this principal? 
 
00:13:45 
Mr. Brimm at Parkside School in Wisconsin Rapids saw the 
connection she made with kids.  He offered to write her a letter of 
recommendation.  She graduated in December and finished the internship in 
January.  They offered her a part-time job for the fall but said no.  She wanted full 
time.  She looked throughout the spring and went to Southwest CAP, a 
community program with a summer program where she worked with young 
disadvantaged children to gain job experience.  She had done this for three years 
each summer.  She knew the job.  These were loyal kids.   
 
00:15:41 
She had to pick them up in her car, 5 kids.  There were no seat 
belts, in those days, so it didn’t matter if there was seating for them all.  She 
picked them up at their houses all over the county.  They cleaned parks for 8 
hours. It was hard work, rough and rugged. She cooked them lunch on her cook 
stove. One day, she was driving them home with shoes off in her big Bonneville.  
She got pulled over.  The kids said, “You don’t have shoes on!” and 4 pairs of 
shoes were thrown up over the seat.  They said, “Quick put these on!”  She never 
got a ticket.  Their hearts were in the right spot. They wanted to make sure she 
didn’t get into any trouble. It was a testimony of their appreciation for what I was 
giving them. 
 
00:17:05 
So after CAP? 
 
00:17:10 
Marilyn worked at Community Action Program through the summer.  
Then CESA (Cooperative Educational Service Agency) asked her to apply for a 
job.  She took it but stayed only one month before Belmont hired her to replace 
their art teacher who was leaving on short notice. They had gotten her name 
from UW-Platteville. She was hired by the principal on the spot, which is how it 
was done in those days. The next day she walked into a K-12 art room in a 300-

student school district in the southwest part of the state, 8 miles from Platteville, 
where she had graduated.  So she had a lot of established connections to 
resources – professors and artists and arts organizations that she knew.  I had a 
lot of things in place for that first year of teaching. It was a pretty neat experience. 
 
00:19:05 
What year was that? 
 
00:19:10 
That was 1979 – 80, her first year.  
 
00:19:15 
What are the successive schools you taught in? 
 
She taught for 9 years in Belmont.  Then she got married, had a child and took 
two years off.  Then she did subbing at Pecatonica School District, including 
some long-term subbing.  She went back to full-time at Monroe School District as 
an elementary art teacher, K-6, half of what she taught at Belmont.  She left two 
little children at home – that was hard. 
 
00:20:00 
I had a staff to work with, other art teachers, how amazing is that! 
Other ideas, other people who are enthusiastic about similar things as you.  So 
for me, that was a real gift.  We shared lesson plans; we shared ideas; we 
shared enthusiasm, passions; we shared worries about certain children. I had a 
guidance counselor who actually knew the children in the school. 
 
Correction: it was Woodside (not Parkside) school in Wisconsin Rapids.  This 
school in Monroe was Parkside.  It was next to a park but it was called “the 
ghetto school” as it was in an impoverished area.  But having worked with 
disadvantaged youth through CAP she felt at home.  She found the same kind of 
loyalty in those kids. These kids couldn’t wait to be in school in the morning 
despite lots of family challenges and tragedies but overall those kids wanted to 
be in an art class.  They came during recesses and free periods.  They had great 
conversations.   
 
00:21:45 
And this is something that you encouraged. 
 
I’ve always had that philosophy. I learn more from the kids than the staff.  They 
know what’s going on in the building.  But they also enjoy that time with you.  I 
enjoy it with them.  Today, I still spend my lunch periods with my students.  It’s 
just in me, I guess.   
 
00:22:15 
9 years in Parkside School.  While there, she received very nice 
awards for her teaching. Argyle asked her to lead summer school art program.  
She agreed as this would be an additional source of income and her own 
children were old enough. Three years later, in 2000, she ‘jumped ship” and 
moved to teaching at Argyle. She had just gotten her master’s, which had been a 
lot of work. Argyle promised to keep her salary the same as what she was 
receiving at Monroe.  This new school had the benefits of being closer to home,

which made it easier to be a mother. Argyle and Pecatonica (where her children 
went) shared after school activities.  So for the next 13 years, she taught in 
Argyle while she raised her children.   
 
She taught K-12 there, which felt like going backward but she knew the rigor, 
knew many of the children from summer programming, and was in a brand new 
building with an amazing art room. It had a kiln and ceramic room and a dark 
room.  She had learned dark room photography from a cooperating teacher in 
Wisconsin Rapids.  Then in Belmont, part of the reason she got the job was that 
she knew dark room procedures and could do the annual.  That was another part 
of the lure. 
 
00:25:10 
She moved to Argyle in 2000.  In 2013, I decided…I graduated the 
last group of children who had known no one but me as their art teacher. I knew 
them as kindergarteners in my first year there and I saw them leave as seniors. I 
said, “That’s full circle; it’s time to move on.”  A position to teach Middle School 
visual studies in Monroe became available.  She applied and interviewed but 
didn’t get the job. Less than a month later they invited her back to apply for visual 
studies at the high school, which is a foundations class that teaches the basics 
(drawing, painting, sculpture, clay – all of it) and coordinate Gifted and Talented 
for the district.  Oh my gosh, another direction: old dog, new trick. And I thought 
about it and I talked to my husband Ricky about it and he said, “You know, 
you’ve always needed change. You’ve always looked for a shift.  Look at all the 
places you’ve taught.” And I realized, you’re right. It’s time. Give it a try. Take a 
risk.  And again, I was not in a position to lose money.  I presented it in such 
ways and they were very good about matching what I was paid from Argyle. And 
so I made yet another turn in my career. And now as I’m working with two other 
art staff, it’s even better than having district wide art staff.  I have people who are 
with me in the room.  I can say, “How did that sound? What do think about that 
concept, you know, the principles of art and design being integrated into this 
mosaic piece and bringing in Englebert and some of these other artists that we’re 
talking about?”  And they’ll go, “I loved it!  I’ve been taking down notes. I might do 
something with it. And I want you to watch me. I have a group of kids I’m having 
a little problem with. I want you to see what I can do to improve their behavior.”  
All of a sudden there’s an energy there and we’re partnering and we’re talking 
and we’re venting and we’re growing and we’re realizing this is a really pretty 
powerful thing, having art teachers with you every day, consistently, watching 
and seeing your routines.  For me that’s my first year doing that so it’s a new 
exciting part of this classroom teaching.  
 
00:28:05 
G&T is spelling bees, math meets, working with the PTAs and other 
partners in district, lots of amazing young people in and outside the arts too. Kids 
who are amazing in math and science and engineering and kids who love to write 
or voracious readers. You watch them bubble up through the district.  It’s been a 
privilege.  Sometimes they’re disadvantaged and that’s the real amazement in 
this, how those kids persevere.  It’s overwhelming but refreshing. I need that.

00:29:40 
I love your description of why you would want to move on.  What’s 
the hard part about leaving a school? 
 
00:29:45 
Loyalty. We built a lot of friendships.  We build a lot of stuff too.  We 
built a 21-foot turtle out of concrete. I worked with a lot of dads and grandpas to 
build that.  They also built a prairie behind the school, partnering with a lot of 
community people and businesses to do that.  That work forged a lot of trust and 
close bonds, especially in a small school district with only 35 staff. That’s pretty 
small.  You know everyone. You know their parents, their husband, their 
children…It’s hard for me to abandon that. It’s hard for me to have my feet in 
both puddles, Monroe and Argyle….That was the hardest thing for me, to give up 
my loyalty to that little school, my beautiful room, but more than that, the kids that 
made that room sparkle, that were my family.  So, that’s the hard part.  The 
excitement in it all is, that’s the way education is.  When you graduate the group 
of kids out, you have to kind of push them out the door of these small school 
districts.  Some of them keep coming back to validate that there’s still a family 
waiting for them back there. Sometimes you have to push the kids out of the 
nest.  And maybe she was pushed out of the nest too. 
 
00:32:20 
She hasn’t gone back yet, and it’s already March.  
 
00:32:40 
Did it feel like a homecoming, returning to Monroe? 
 
Absolutely.  She hadn’t expected such a warm welcome as she returned to 
Monroe.  It was an amazing homecoming.  They remembered her from the 
1990s, shouting her name across a full room.  That expectation kind of washes 
over you for a minute and you think, they remember me from the 1990s.  Will I be 
able to maintain that person?  Am I still that person that they think I am? Not that 
you doubt yourself, but you need to let them know that maybe you’ve reinvented 
yourself or that you are yet a different person after 13 years.  I’d hoped that I’d 
meet their expectations since they were all so complementary.   
 
34:45 Can you describe a typical school day for you? 
 
00:35:00 
She’ll describe Argyle, before she became a district coordinator.  
She would arrive at Argyle around 7:45.  Not much before the children arrived at 
8:10. A typical day would be with 8th graders.  She would introduce the lesson 
quickly and then walk around and help them for the rest of the 45-minute period. 
That was plenty intense. Then next hour might be AP Art History taught in the 
library learning lab via distance technology to local students as well as students 
from 4 or 5 other school districts who would be watching via a camera.  She 
would get to school at 5 ‘til 8 because she had woken up at 4 am to read the Art 
History chapter and find on-line resources, to go into that classroom fully 
prepared and with discussion questions.  She has to fax all the materials and 
questions to all the other districts too. Show time!  I would leave my 8th graders 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

and jump into a college level course. Prior to the class she would have to fax all 
the materials to the other schools.  She had to do it herself; the secretary didn’t 
have time to do it, making those phone calls to get the fax machine going.  Then 
she would race to Nutrition Break where all the kids had 10 minutes in the 
commons to eat something healthy.  She would supervise that with other staff 
while eating a banana herself. They would talk about upcoming, meetings, future 
events, what was coming up in the day or what happened with a particular child.  
Then she would directly jump into her next class – high school art.  Then back to 
7th grade.  Then it was her turn for lunch but that was always with kids in the art 
room because they wanted to come in and work on something.  It was during 
their study hall.  Some were working on art.  Some were high school kids eating 
lunch with me, having discussions.  After 25 minutes of lunch, then she would 
teach elementary art for 2 hours.  Then she’d end with a high school art class.  
Elementary was always absolutely crazy because I would expect my high school 
kids to come in at lunch or over their free time or maybe at the end of their art 
period when they were cleaning up a little too early, and I’d say “Good.  I need 
you to cut out these circles.  Can you get these circles cut out in three minutes?  
And they would get their friends and the scissors would just fly. And they would 
help me get prepped for every one of those elementary classes.  I couldn’t have 
done it without them.  They would help her with technology prep too, and as the 
gopher and the running with messages to the classroom teachers. It was only 
because, I was only as good as those kids allowed me to be. And they really 
were amazing. Who needs an aide when you have such able willing little 
bodies…They wanted to be of use. She never wanted for kids to help her with 
preps and with Kindergarten, there was a lot of prep.  (laughs)  There were about 
125 elementary students in those two hours per week.  That required a lot of 
cutting and preparing for those little hands. 
 
00:40:05 
You’ve mentioned some very large community art project.  What 
about an in-class project?  Are there one or two that are memorable? 
 
00:40:20 
So many! I have to tell you about my Egypt ones  An art teacher 
and Egypt?  Its like candy!  And I went to Egypt!  I went there to see the artifacts 
and pyramids and stuff and I came away remembering the people.  I told the kids 
that.  So let’s go to Egypt and talk about that.  Sometimes I do it throughout the 
whole district, Kindergarten through 12th grade; that’s what we did last spring.  
We built a tomb, literally, we built a tomb out of cardboard, wood; we framed it 
out. Middle school kids built the mummy coffin all out of papier mache.  It was life 
sized and greater.  The elementary kids slapped gold paint on it.  The elementary 
kids made canopic jars with little Cheerios. Every grade level did something 
different and unique in the project.  Studied the hieroglyphics, the kings and 
queens, the language, King Tut’s family tree, the whole concept of what Egypt 
religion is about with one god, vs. the pantheon that had come before.  She had 
art history to work from.  Mummification?  Let’s go for it!  Your brains through 
your nose?  They just love those kind of visual concepts.  That was one of my 
favorites. 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

00:42:40 
Did you partner with science or history teachers on that? 
 
Always, though it’s hard now.  She’d go down the hallway and talk to the science 
teacher about mummification and social studies but the answer was often, “It’s 
not in my unit now; you’ll have to wait for that.”  Or they’d work together but 
always on different levels at different times across the district. It was hit or miss.  
But they would do what they could; they wanted to.  But today, because data 
drives education, it’s all about testing. These teachers knew that they really had 
to get through this curriculum and they had to get through all of it and they 
couldn’t do the little things collaborating with the art teacher as much as they 
would have done a decade ago. As things evolved, that became more of a 
challenge.  
 
00:42:50 
Is that a trend you can live happily with or are you reluctant to see it 
go in that direction? 
 
I’m reluctant to say that I can live happily with it but indeed there is nothing I can 
do about it and I realize that.  It is a trend that education is taking today and it’s 
unfortunate for the staff and I’m sorry to say that it’s unfortunate for the children 
too.  Teachers have lost the passion they used to have for teaching because 
they’re scared.   
 
00:44:29 
Teacher effectiveness has taken a toll on responding to student 
interests, to being spontaneous.  The data has to be in place via pre-test and 
post-test. This becomes more like cookie-cutter teaching.  The teacher’s passion 
is left behind. Instead, it’s lets make sure you know all the plants, or a hierarchy 
of learning so that you can find out all the plants. Teachers are challenged today.  
 
00:46:00 
Is there something that is compensating teachers for this change – 
in having to give up passion and spontaneity? 
 
00:46:25 
If teachers want to become a master teacher or take on a 
leadership role in the district, that helps the administration, which is 
overburdened, and so they are very happy to reward monetarily. If you want to 
be a lead teacher or a dean of students, they are happy to throw a thousand 
bucks to the teacher. Often a principal is also the superintendent in a small 
district; they’re overextended.  And they now have extra duties of documentation 
of 3 or 4 visits to a teacher’s room (in past years it was only 1 visit) so their 
responsibilities have increased and they need to pass on duties they used to be 
responsible for to the staff. Maybe someone would even take on MAP testing, 
which is standardized testing.  But connecting with community to build a turtle or 
build a prairie to make our school better, to bring parents into the school, to give 
back, to create something that people driving by might want to stop for, to make 
our school stand out, there is no monetary reward for that but there is respect 
gained from the other staff and administration. Those things build a foundation of 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

who you are as an educator, more than just that classroom person, someone 
linked to the community, and to the administration, and to the board.  You can’t 
separate them all out. Your reward for that is, maybe you’re just looked at as 
being an honorable person.  That’s enough for some.  That’s enough for me.   
 
00:50:10 
You are not shy about asking people to join in. 
 
00:50:15 
(laughs) You’ve got to! I’ve always just jumped in with both feet. 
What else can you do?  All they can say is no. And I’ve had plenty who’ve said 
they’d be there and didn’t.  And I’m never disappointed by that because I know 
they’re busy.  I just go to someone else.  And eventually, you link with a kid, 
though.  This is the heart; this is what works.  You work with the kids in your 
classroom.  They get excited about building a turtle.  They are the ones who go 
home to Dad: “Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Look what we’re doing!”  And then Dad 
shows up. It’s just done.  That is what works.  You’ve got to have the kids 
hooked….You’re the one who’s the glue as an educator.  You’re the one who has 
to make sure that everything else is in place…You’re the contractor. You’re going 
to be pulling all these little groups together to make something actually happen. 
That’s, you know, a real neat thing to have happen. It’s kind of “Wow, we did this 
thing!”  And I know that those fathers still see me today and they’ll come up to me 
and say, “Aww, jeez, every time I look at that turtle!  What do you think?” And 
we’ll go, “We gotta get a plaque on that thing!”  We always say that.  “We gotta 
get a plaque on that thing telling our story!”  And it’s been 10 years now. “We 
gotta get a plaque on that thing to tell our story!”  We will some day.   
 
So, those are the rewards. 
 
00:52:10 
Is there a stereotype of teachers? 
 
00:52:15 
I do.  It’s kind of properness.  I think teachers are proper.  Teachers 
are enthusiastic most of the time.  Teachers are tired.  Usually, the people in a 
community that lead, I would hope….Teachers are also that person that “I pay 
through my taxes” and so you’re kind of owned in some way.  And you always 
kind of feel a responsibility to the community to volunteer.  You always feel 
there’s a responsibility, of course, to the children in your classrooms, but that 
stereotype. You have hardworking people who always bring their work home with 
them, even if it’s not physical.  You think about that kid that could have been a 
little nicer in your class or caused a disruption during your science experiment or 
your reading, your ‘race to read’ moment. The kids lost track of what they were 
doing and how are you gonna deal with that tomorrow.  Is it being firmer or is it 
being a little less firm? Should you have maybe gone to the principal for this?  
What would be the repercussions of that?  Maybe you should have emailed that 
parent and maybe its not too late yet at 3 in the morning.  I think that’s all part of 
what the stereotype of a teacher is. (groans) You need the summer!  (laughs)  I 
guess just to unwind and to be soaking up knowledge instead of worrying and 
giving it out.  I think that shows on our faces; it shows on who we are; maybe

even at church, maybe even when we’re at the ball games at night. There’s 
always that distracted.    
 
00:54:30 
It might be a distracted look.  I have a colleague to whom a student 
said, “Mrs. King, you look kind of distracted.”  Many responsibilities. Yes, we 
probably are distracted. 
 
00:55:00 
Can you talk about the kind of support and storytelling that you and 
your colleagues have? 
 
00:55:10 
There’s always that kind of secret code.  At the end of the day 
email, “Poets’ Society meeting downtown.”  They don’t even need to say 
“Downtown” because there are two sites. means a particular bar.  Or, the location 
might be named as “Leopold Environmental Center” which means a different 
location.  It’s always on a Friday, right after school, always for an hour or hour 
and a half.  Gives the staff an opportunity to revel. It’s a time of laughter, no 
matter the frustrations.  There’s always a story about a silly thing a kid said.  One 
story from her guidance counselor friend, “I was reading to my kids today and it 
was a very powerful moment about self-esteem.  And one of the students raised 
her hand and she was expecting a wonderful meaningful story about self-esteem 
but instead it was, ‘Mrs. Sopher, is that panty hose coming out of the bottom of 
your pant leg?’ She looks down and sure enough, when she got dressed that 
morning she had panty hose stuffed in the leg of her pants and was sticking out 
the end of her pant leg.  And that’s all the kids had focused on for the past five 
minutes during her wonderful introduction to self-esteem. And they were all going 
“I saw. I saw” and she had to bend down and slowly pull out the panty hose from 
her pant leg. (laughs) That’s a typical experience with children. They keep you 
grounded.  (laughs) Don’t think too lofty of yourself. That’s just a small example 
of what kids do.

so, stories about humans, stories about oddball moments in the 
classroom 
 
00:57:20 
Or, special moments of achievement of children. You need 
reflection on a very busy week.  And I think that’s where you become family as 
staff. Little gripes between each other, they wash away.  You know, you have 
that time together. Not everyone shows up but you kind of build that group of 10, 
maybe 15, maybe a quarter of the staff. That’s pretty good.  And sometimes the 
principal will show up. The custodian’s always there. And sometimes the cook, 
and a parent might even show up, a school board member occasionally, which is 
always great.  Always love to see them. It’s kind of a real interesting, shifting 
experience every few weeks.    It might happen once or twice a month but usually 
not on a routine of every week.

00:58:45 
Of course, there’s all the acronyms that teachers have. IEP 
(Individual Education Plan), MHCDS kids (Multi-handicapped cognitively 
disabled), SLO (student learning outcome).  There’s a lot of jargon.   
 
00:59:40 
Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of jargon? 
 
00:59:45 
“Retardation” is a least favorite term that students use. It’s kind of 
associated with education as a label that has been put on students.  “You retard” 
or “going down to the retard room.” Kids use it; staff don’t.  But it wasn’t that long 
ago that we talked about ‘the retarded learner.”  Even the students in the 
program use the term sometimes.   Her goal is to banish it. It cannot be used.  
That’s the way they’re treating it in our school this year.  We have to be careful of 
the labels we put on things. 
 
01:01:30 
it makes me think of another question we have here about school 
culture.  What do you think is the school culture?  Do you fit into it and how do 
you help shape it? 
 
01:01:40 
School culture tends to focus on sports, especially in rural areas.  
It’s the only choice students have. Right now it’s hockey. Soccer.  But it’s always 
been baseball, wrestling, track, cross country, football, and basketball. Your 
better students are really loyal to the sports programs. And parents  who are very 
loyal to the sports program.  It’s hard to get art in there.  But the culture in 
Monroe, and Argyle, embraces change.  When they introduced after school art 
programs, they were very welcomed. It was a very rich program that offered 
further learning so parents were very eager to have their children enrolled, from 
Kindergarten through 6th grade. Over 70 kids showed up on the first day. Middle 
school kids came as tutors. There were up to 100 kids. They had to move it form 
the art room to the cafeteria and then to the gym. And then we brought in more 
parent volunteers.  So there is a culture of wanting more than just 
sports….sometimes I think we lose vision of that until we have someone who can 
champion it.  Before you knew it, we ended up with an environmental charter 
school, ALEA – Argyle Land Ethic Academy, after Aldo Leopold.  Everything was 
based on Leopold’s concepts. And these people came crawling out of the 
woodwork; this was a whole new culture. It wasn’t all about sports.  We had this 
little charter school for ten years; that’s why we got into doing the prairie.  They 
built a scrape on donated land to build a pond behind the school and planted 
prairies around it.  Mr. Erickson owned the land and decided to gift it to the 
community. Gifted to the community. The art club kids built an observation deck.  
It includes a woodland wetland prairie, a highland prairie, the Pecatonica River.  
It’s an amazing gift  available to the school and to the weary passerby.  218 
acres beyond that to build trails.  So how about that.  That’s our community.  
That’s our culture.  Isn’t that fun?

Is there something that you had expected to talk about that we 
haven’t yet?

China Day is a favorite celebration that they did.  Based on a flyer 
in the mailbox, she and student teacher Lindsey La Plante took a class to learn 
calligraphy at Alverno College in Milwaukee.  Marilyn took a professional day and 
she and Lindsey attended the workshop.  It was a blast.  A Buddhist monk taught 
it. While there, she found out about a 4-credit class she could take to learn more.  
She took that for professional development.  That led into an opportunity to 
showcase what she had learned at her school.  She discovered she had parents 
who had lived in China. So they partnered with her on this huge full-day 
showcase; covered religion, education.  Her administrator had also been in China 
doing administration work; he volunteered to talk about the schools in China.  
Many others with connections bubbled up too – 809 people in Argyle to teach 
about yoga, food, all the practices they knew about Chinese culture. It was an 
amazing day with the kids.  Her professor came from Alverno College with some 
of his foreign exchange students and talked about geography and history of 
China.  He loved the community so much that last year he came back and talked 
about Korea.  One unexpected outcome was a free trip to China for a month.  
Because she had taken the class, she was eligible to apply for a grant for a 
scholarship for a 23-day study tour, one of 17 teachers to work with staff there.  
She was awarded the trip.   It was the most amazing education opportunity, 
through Boulder College in Colorado. I went to China and I lived with the Chinese 
people and I learned the culture and I learned about the children and the school 
districts. So that was a whole other direction and that’s what you do as a teacher.  
This happened in 2009. How about that?  Old dog, more new tricks!  (laughs) 
 
01:11:30 
The children loved to dance with the Chinese dragon down the 
hallways. We got to play.  It was just pure, absolute reward. They displayed the 
piece in the library and filled the library with Chinese lanterns. Kids bring new 
appreciation to old topics.   
 
01:12:25 
What advice would you give to a young person about going into the 
teaching profession? 
 
01:12:40 
Especially for very amazing people who have a lot of gifts, I’ll say 
“Rethink it.” Isn’t that terrible?  Come back to it later when things settle down. 
Now is a real hard time for new teachers.  See where it goes. There are 
wonderful rewards with children in the classroom but evaluation of teachers is too 
up in the air now.  She’s afraid the direction is to make all teachers mediocre. I 
think my most effective teachers are the passionate ones, the ones that are 
creative, innovative, and are constantly reinventing how they’re teaching these 
kids in the room.  And they’re done; they’re rethinking it; and they don’t need an 
administrator to come in and give them a prescribed formula – this is how you will 
perform; this is what I’m looking for and here is how I want you to do this; I want 
you to do well;  I want you to be a 3 teacher, not a 1. And did you get that form 
filled out and put into the secretary’s desk? Is that done? Is that done? Is that 
done? Creative innovative teachers tend not to be all the little functions that a

secretary or an administrator expect them to have done.  They’re busy with the 
kids.  And they’re learning, and they’re teaching with the kids. And the kids are 
teaching each other.  And they’re learning through lots of different ways. She 
would advise them to wait for 5 years to see.  It’s a 5-year program to get an 
education degree now.  They’ll start at about $32,000.  Another field – 
engineering, science, business – they would have better compensation.  Is it all 
about money?  Maybe not.  But today education is taking a shift. And in my 35 
years of teaching I’ve never seen anything so drastic as what’s happened in the 
past three years. And it’s the tail wagging the dog. The most gifted and creative 
teachers who have the most seniority have retired because they just didn’t have 
it in them to have to take this shift and teach in a proscribed manner. The ones of 
us who are left and are still there are mentoring the young new teachers who are 
scared. Rightfully so, because if they don’t perform well, they’ll lose their job. 
They’ll be a non-renewal.  
 
01:16:00 
So a lot of staff are scared today. Is that an environment I want to 
tell someone to come into? The children in our classroom sense it. They know 
we’re apprehensive. They’re worried.  They know the administration is worried. 
It’s all trickle down. I don’t want to leave it on this dark note, but it is a shift one 
that I will watch carefully to see how it works out. Because I don’t want to lose 
these passionate young people who need to be in education. They need to 
impact these young kids and inspire them to learn…How are you going to teach 
these kids so that they are lifelong learners? How do you that when it’s data that 
is describing if you’re a good teacher or bad teacher? It’s about the numbers.  
 
01:17:15 
You said before that you can’t change that.  Do you think any 
teacher can change that?  
 
01:17:28 
Marilyn tells a story - Act 10 comes in to being in 2011.  With a big 
group she goes to protest in Madison. She went with a girlfriend, the science 
teacher in Argyle.  She had “Staff” on the back of her shirt, Argyle Orioles. She 
was quietly standing by. An AP reporter came up, asked if they were teachers. 
“I’m here just to voice my concerns.”   
“Well, what do you have to say?”  
“Well, we are passionate people about what we do. We work hard for the 
children.  And the unionizing is what keeps us, solidarity, keeps us together and 
cohesive. We’re never, never, never, never, never going to give up.”  
That night, she got a Facebook from a former student in Belmont who she hadn’t 
heard from in 20 years. She told “Miss Machotka” that she was all over 
Huffington Post. It went all over.  She got an email from someone she didn’t 
know who swore at her and called her bad words. Then she got another on her 
Facebook that said they were proud to know her and would consider her a friend. 
It helped her realize that the social network is so powerful today.  People she 
barely knew came in and congratulated her on the comment. Others were 
criticizing, including “you’re darn lucky to have a job. You should learn how to sit 
on your hands and keep your mouth quiet.” She got a flood of information coming

in from that one little 2-line AP comment that she made. And I’ll never forget that 
what you say does have an impact. Well, I wish I would have said something a 
little more changing for the legislature because I don’t think it had any impact on 
the people it should have! (laughs) But it was an eye-opener for me.  
 
She was glad to be there.  She will continue to be active.  She will continue to be 
pro-union because it brings strength, not weakness. It has brought better things 
for our students.  I think you have to be politically active. I think you have to give 
it a lot more time than a lot of teachers have. And I know some retired teachers 
who have taken it on and we’re in good hands.  I’m thankful for their energy, their 
passion.  Now she’s waiting for the pendulum to come back, and it will, but 
doesn’t know how long it will take.   
 
01:20:30 
For clarification, you are a union member? 
 
Yes, she is now and always has been a union member. When she started 
teaching she was urged to join the union because they were working for her 
wages.  Membership was a big chunk of money but she sees the benefits and 
sees how hard the union reps work as volunteers. They find that extra few 
minutes at lunch to get letters out information to staff about a meeting.  They’re 
passionate; she likes that she has such heart. So the least she can do is be a 
member.  She has been on a negotiation team, grievance committee, been 
secretary. She’s done various roles. When it became Fair Share, it was a no 
brainer.  You’re going to pay the dues; you’re going to go to the meetings and be 
informed.  And they were always very informative. They always gave me the 
information to talk to an administrator effectively.  You need to show them you 
care enough to be prepared for the meeting; the unions helped with that.  
 
Now that Fair Share is gone, she sees deterioration and fractured in staff.  Now 
that it’s voluntary, sees teachers not joining, negotiating on their own. It’s yet to 
be seen how raises will be handled now.  She urged one potential teacher who 
was thinking of education as a career but had enough gifts to go into other fields, 
“Reconsider.”  If you don’t love kids, don’t teach. I learned that my first year 
teaching. I had to work at it.  It doesn’t come easy, well, for everyone….I decided 
if I was coming back next year, I was going to love them all.  And I did. Isn’t that 
amazing, what you can talk yourself into? And it became a true passion.   Went 
into teaching art but came away loving the kids.  I think that should come first, 
over your discipline. That’s just personal. That’s how I feel about it. They know 
when you love them.  They’ll do anything. And you get it back most of the time.
