Log – L. Glass 08-21-2012 
 
[0:02] Recorded 08-21-2012, Montgomery, Texas at the home of Capn Leonard 
Glass. 
[0:40] Born 1948, La Porte, Texas where he finished high school. Boyhood 
friends were sons of pilots and tugboat captains. This became his ambition. His 
father and uncles worked at the refineries. After graduation worked on a boat 
doing a water pollution study on the Houston Ship Channel. Later hired on at a 
marina at Barber’s Cut. Worked at oil refineries for a couple of years. 
[04:45] Left oil refineries to work on and drive tugboats. Got operator’s license. 
Worked out of Galveston, two years. Worked for Brown and Root on tug in the 
Amazon River with a pipeline job. Back in the U.S. worked for Tide Water in 
Puerto Rico and Trinidad. Returned to Galveston/Houston Towing Co. Married 
his wife Debbie. 
[11:48] Father-in-law managed John Lafitte Hotel in Galveston and knew 
president of Houston Towing. Captain Glass [CG] gave head of Amoco Oil ride 
on the tug and got publicity work for the tug company. Worked out of Houston 
where family could meet him at Morgan’s Point. Moved to Sea Brook. 
[16:38] Houston pilot, Jack Rowling, encouraged him to put in an application to 
Pilots Association. October 1, 1984, he was voted in at age 36; one son was 3, 
one was 5. Other pilots voted in were Tom Gibson and Armando Luna. CG’s 
career lasted 22 yrs. After becoming full pilot, the oil crises sent tankers through 
Panama to Houston that he would pilot. Also, containers from China came 
through Suez to Houston. Could take family on rides on the boats before 9/11. 
[24:43] Involved in giving safety seminars for tugboat captains. Piloting foreign 
ships was like traveling abroad without leaving home. Felt like a guest in their 
home. Avoided having an accident during his career. 
[30:03] Son, Matthew, voted in as a pilot, 2012. Due to be full pilot in 2013. CG 
adapted to cultures and crews from European, Russian, Chinese countries. Was 
courteous and respectful. A manpower study by the Pilot Assoc. changed 
working conditions through the Port Authority. 
[38:00] The Ecuadorian ship, the Monogas, was captained by a unique man who 
owned several Ecuadorian dept. stores. It was old, beautiful, fast and graceful. 
CG often the pilot. Ship always completely loaded with freight. Crew were highly 
trained. The captain, though drunk, saluted the port on the whistle when 
departing. 
[46:42] CG saluted the Boy Scout/Cubs campout, piloting a boat with a steam 
whistle at the Battleship Texas at 11:00 PM. Wife not happy. 
[51:26] Worked with Brown and Root’s outsized cranes on barges in building oil 
drilling platforms on Green’s Bayou. The tugboats used were built to go across 
the Atlantic working on North Sea oil field: the Godfather, Mister Darby, & Doctor 
Jack; each had 2 Alcoa locomotive engines. 
[58:48] Working rules are different for pilots in every port. In Houston the big rule 
is pilots don’t pick their jobs. CG came to favor Indian food, including curry, but 
not Korean. On the Ship Channel, outbound in the AM is easterly; inbound in the 
PM is easterly. Both ways the sun is in your eyes and it gets hot. 
[1:05:40] Pilot’s Assoc. early on sent members to training schools. Port Authority 
was supportive. Currently a school in La. Is doing a mock up for training for the 
new Bay Port facility. When CG started the channel was 40 ft. deep/400ft. wide. 
It was dredged to 530 ft. wide/42 ft. deep. Pilots worked w/Corp of Engineers on 
planning to dredge the channel for safe travel while ‘economically feasible.’ 
[1:11:33] CG takes pride in training new pilots. His philosophy is to make clear 
the expectations then turn them loose under his watchful eye. He is active in 
Retired Texas State Pilots who come from the 7 Ports. If able to start his career 
again, he would do it tomorrow.
