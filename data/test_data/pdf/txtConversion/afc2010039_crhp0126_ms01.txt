EMILYE CROSBY: This is Emilye Crosby, with Timothy Jenkins, on 
December 9, 2015, at the Library of Congress, and we’re here as part of the Civil Rights 
History Project, which is cosponsored by the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian 
National Museum of African American History and Culture. And also here are John 
Bishop and Guha Shankar. Good morning, Tim. Thanks for joining us. 
TIMOTHY JENKINS : Sure. 
EC: Can you start by telling us when and where you were bom and about your 
family? 
TJ: I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 30, 1938. 
EC: Can you tell us about your family? 
Timothy Jenkins

TJ: My mother and father were long-term Philadelphians. My father 
originated from Richmond, Virginia, and my mother had been born in Philadelphia. And 
my mother was a housewife, and just a volunteer in many different church activities. 
And my father had a barbershop in North Philadelphia that was quite an unusual shop 
because of its mixed clientele of professionals and laypeople. And they gave me quite an 
exposure to all strata of life in Philadelphia. 
My grandparents are of some interest. On my mother’s side, he was a—. William 
Albert, he was—. William Albert Jones. He was a member of the school board, an active 
Republican promoter after Reconstruction, and formed an organization in Philadelphia, of 
all things, called Remember John Brown. [Laughter] My paternal grandfather was also 
interested in education. He founded one of the Rosenwald schools in Courtland, 
Virginia, called the Courtland, Virginia Normal and—. Industrial and Normal Institute. 
He was part of the following wave after Booker T. Washington’s creation of Tuskegee 
Institute, and it’s now a historic site in Courtland, Virginia. Courtland, Virginia used to 
be New Jerusalem. It was renamed after the Nat Turner rebellion. [Laughter] 
EC: So what was the Remember John Brown, what was that organization 
about? 
TJ: Well, it was basically an organization for black Republicans. It met on a 
regular basis, at least annually, and sometimes more frequently. And they dealt with 
questions of finding financial support for blacks and developing businesses and 
educational institutions. And also for other aspects of civil concern dealing with public 
issues of Philadelphia. 
Timothy Jenkins

EC: And so, did—. What—. You mentioned that your, both of your 
grandfathers were active in [the] Republican party, or both—. Were both of them active? 
TJ: No, I don’t, I don’t know about my paternal grandfather, but given the 
time, and given the fact that he was a Rosenwald institution and what Virginia was like 
after Reconstruction, I wouldn’t be surprised if he too were a Republican. 
EC: And so was he—. You said he founded—. Was he then the principal or—? 
TJ: Well, actually, I have a wonderful picture of him sitting in his wicker chair 
with his faculty around him and his students behind him, in front of this clapboard wood 
building. And it has “Reverend O.G. Jenkins, president of the Courtland Normal and 
Industrial Institute.” 
EC: Sounds like that you had a very strong background with both of your sets 
of grandparents, in terms of land and education [5:00] and politics. Were you—? Did that 
influence you growing up? Was that something you were thinking about or aware of? 
TJ: Well, I didn’t—. It wasn’t until later that I discovered my paternal 
grandfather’s history and contributions and started reading some of the old newspaper 
articles that my aunt had of her father’s work when he was in Richmond. He founded 
what is still the largest African American Zion Episcopal church in Richmond, called 
Hood Temple. I have visited there with my children, and I’ve also became aware of his 
activities in the development of different programs in northern Virginia. But that, I didn’t 
know that when I was a youngster; I really researched that as an adult. 
EC: Okay. [Laughs] So what was your childhood like in Philadelphia? What 
was your own schooling like? 
Timothy Jenkins 
4 
TJ: I had something of a peculiar educational career. I did not go to a 
neighborhood school. I went to a special school of practice. It was called the Thaddeus 
Stevens School of Practice. And it was a training facility for teachers and the production 
of teachers. And it had a student body that was drawn from all over the city and more 
concentrated in the neighborhoods adjacent to the univers—. To the school. It was at 
Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia. And it’s still there, although I think it’s sold to a 
developer and going to become either offices or condominiums. 
EC: So was that an integrated school? 
TJ: Oh, heavily integrated. In fact, there were few African American students. 
There were Chinese students. There were European immigrants who were there. And 
they had a broad concentration of Jewish, Irish, and Eastern European background 
students. It was an interesting environment because we had a very extensive field 
program. The teachers used to load us up on buses and take us down to the museums: the 
Art Museum of Philadelphia, which is quite famous; the Eels Institute Planetarium; 
Natural History Museum. Some of that had lasting impacts on me. I fell in love as a 
grammar school student with the Eastern Asian aesthetic traditions. I was fascinated by a 
room that they had at the Philadelphia art museum called the scholar’s room. And to this 
day I have reminiscence of that room, and I’ve tried to duplicate some of it in my own 
study. 
EC: [Laughs] Sounds like an interesting start. What made you decide to go to 
Howard University for college? 
TJ: Well, I was recruited by a peripatetic promoter who set up appointments in 
Philadelphia, and the school that I went to, Central High, was kind of the premier public 
Timothy Jenkins 
5 
institution in Philadelphia. So they always made it a part of their schedule to stop at 
Central High and give out literature on Howard and to solicit students who might apply 
for scholarships. And I made that application and was successful and got a full tuition 
scholarship to go to Howard, so that made sort of a selection for me. But I also had some 
family knowledge about Howard. I had a sister who had gone to West Virginia State, and 
she knew about Howard. I had a brother who had gone to Lincoln University, and he 
knew about Howard; another sister who had gone to Cheyney University, all historically 
black colleges. And Howard also had a connection with one of my neighborhood friends. 
One of my father’s clients ran a [10:00] confectionery store, and his sister was the dean 
of women at Howard, and he told me lots of the background of Howard, and all of it 
sounded interesting and especially interesting to get out of Philadelphia. Most of my 
time had been in Philadelphia, and I wanted to see a new environment, and Washington 
sounded very attractive. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC : When did you enter Howard? 
TJ: Immediately after completion of high school. That would have been 1956. 
EC: And what was Howard like in those years? 
TJ: Howard really had a character that was very stimulating. It had a very 
vibrant program of student activities. I quickly got involved in the debate society. I got 
involved in the classics group. And we had a philosophy club that was engaging. But 
most importantly we had a very rich collection of faculty members who by their 
backgrounds had been involved in a lot of the social action interests of the black 
community for decades. Rayford Logan, who was one of my professors in history, is, of 
Timothy Jenkins 
6 
course, famous for his black reconstruction studies. He also was the general secretary for 
the Pan-African movement, of which W.E.B. Du Bois was chairman. Then I had Sterling 
Brown, poet, raconteur, and linguistic critic, who introduced us to the whole business of 
dialect as a form of communication and the history of black literary contributions from 
the beginning of the American Revolution with Phyllis Wheatley, down to the current 
poets and writers of the day. And Sterling Brown was more than just a teacher. We 
came to endear him as a colleague. He invited us to his home frequently and there with 
people like Stokely Carmichael and Courtland Cox and Jean Wheeler. We were able to 
absorb both the music that he provided. He had lots of blues and jazz and a whole history 
of that sort of thing. So he created an entrée between the academy and the people of the 
field and of the folk traditions of the South. Before coming to Howard, he’d been at the 
Virginia Union and he’d been to some other historically black colleges, and he had a rich 
background. 
And his father, who was also named Sterling—Nelson Brown—and his father was 
a biblical scholar and may have started the first correspondence school for black 
ministers. His observation had been that whereas many people had gone into the ministry 
in the South, they didn’t go through seminaries, they didn’t go through college, and they 
had the barest understanding of really the scientific theology. So he started to develop a 
program that would correspond with these ministers, and they would have regular reading 
assignments, and they would have exams, and they would have questionnaires that they 
had to fill out. To my knowledge, he started this in the early 1900s. It was the first 
evidence I can find of a correspondence course through the mail to qualify people to be 
seminarians. 
Timothy Jenkins 
7 
EC: That’s interesting. I had no idea. 
TJ: But in addition to those two, we had Harold Lewis, who was a political 
scientist and deeply involved in many of the social movements from labor movements on 
through modern movements. And he was a rich source for us. I could go on and on 
[15:00] about the various faculty members. Of course, E. Franklin Frazier was my 
professor in sociology and you know his famed study, the Black Bourgeoisie. And these 
teachers offered a special access through a vehicle which was called the Little Forum. 
That was an informal reading club that assembled once a month in one of the lobbies of 
one of the residential halls, Cook Hall. It allowed a student and a faculty member to 
present praxes and interpretations of one book per session. Both the faculty member and 
a student would comment, and then it would be open for discussion, and we’d have 
cookies and coffee afterward. It’s interesting to me that lo, these many years, when I 
hear some of my colleagues on radio and TV interviews talk about their background, they 
lift up this Little Forum as one of the pillars as one of their educational preparation. It 
was particularly important because it was the only forum that we had where students and 
faculty were on a peer relationship. The opinions of students were weighted as heavily as 
those of faculty. We were free to criticize and object and protest what some of the 
faculty members were saying. And it became a melting pot for thinking about both the 
mixture of our formal studies and the current events of the time. So the Little Forum is 
one of the most important features of Howard. 
I got involved in student politics and ultimately ran for student council and 
became president of the student body, and that exposed me to, of course, the politics of 
the university and also the politics of the students and the fraternities and all that sort of 
Timothy Jenkins 
8 
thing. And most importantly, it gave me access to the president of the university, both 
formally and informally. He was Dr. Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, a real—. The first black 
president of Howard University. He was an enormously important person in the whole 
world of scholarship. He was important because of who he was but also the kind of 
issues that he spoke to. He was president of Howard during the McCarthy era, and he 
refused to dismiss any of the people that the House Un-American Activities Committee, 
the Senate committee under McCarthy, tried to expose or excoriate for being leftist 
sympathizers or communists. And throughout all of that he continued with a heavy 
subsidy of money coming from the federal government. He resisted the pressures to 
modify or expel the students. Significantly, one of the students, Pauli Murray, sat in at 
the cafeteria in the House of Representatives in the 1940s. And they—. The Capitol 
police arrested them, and they tried to get them expelled, and Mordecai Johnson would 
not expel them, as he wouldn’t expel any of the faculty who were pursued by 
congressional types. 
EC: With your politics at, with your involvement in politics at Howard, did you 
get to—? Did he ever talk to you about his negotiations or how he walked this line 
between the congressional appor—funding and what’s going on on campus, or did you 
observe that? 
TJ: I’m afraid we didn’t have exactly a peer relationship. [Laughter] The—, I 
stole little bits and pieces of his time. He used to have a house that was on campus, and 
he would walk from his house to his office—which is also, of course, on campus—and I 
used to waylay him on the path that he would use, because his secretary would never give 
me an appointment. [Laughter] And he used to sit down with me on the long granite 
Timothy Jenkins 
9 
bench behind Founders Library and have these wonderful conversations about this and 
that, but mostly it was concerning university policies and things [20:00] that we were 
upset about and things that we were demanding in terms of curricula, faculty changes, 
you name it. And that was kind of our informal learning bench being on the granite walk 
behind Founders Library. 
EC: So you mentioned the various things that the students were interested in or 
protesting. So your senior year at Howard must have coincided with the start of the sit-in 
movement. What kinds of things were Howard students engaging in before the sit-ins 
started? 
TJ: Well, the students were largely engaged in campus issues. We were 
concerned with the matter of black studies. We were concerned with having more 
younger faculty. We were concerned with some of the curricula designs. And of course 
we had the other kind of grievances about long lines and inadequate food and lack of 
participation in faculty tenure decisions, all that sort of thing. But the social aspects of 
what we were engaged in was largely off-campus during the years prior to the [19]60s. 
I happened to be selected as a delegate for the university to the United States 
National Student Association. That’s a confederation of some five hundred or more 
colleges and universities across the country. And they had annual meetings; they had 
quarterly meetings; they had various programs. And one of the programs that I got 
involved in was the International Rela—. Student Relations Seminar, ISRS, that was held 
at Harvard. I met students from around the country who were very politically active. 
They were interested in a number of questions, like the liberation of Namibia, the South 
Africa question, the business of the legislation that restricted political expression for 
Timothy Jenkins 
10 
getting scholarships from the—. Supported by the federal government. They were very 
active in some of the labor relations issues on their campuses. And that exposed me to a 
different level of political activity than we had at Howard. 
Going back to that forum year after year also connected me with some of the 
militants around the country. I can remember Barney Frank, aide to the congressman; 
Frank was an active student member. One of the guys was—. Later became the 
representative for the National Football League. Don Hoffman was active in the student 
politics and ran for local office in his home state. It was quite an exposure to people. 
And one of the exposures was to another subgroup, the Students for a Democratic 
Society, SDS. Ultimately, I was deeply involved with SDS, and they were very 
concerned about the issues of being opposed to the war. They were opposed to the 
Vietnam activity. They were also very militant on the business of draft resistance. And 
that exposed me to another, more radical dimension of politics. 
At one point, toward the end of my term as president, there was the sit-in breakout 
in Greensboro, North Carolina. And we didn’t have a direct role in that, although as I 
mentioned, Pauli Murray had been a proponent of integrated lunch counters in—. Back in 
the [19]40s, so there was certainly a tradition there, even a broader tradition than just 
Pauli Murray. Many students were in protests and demonstrations and things downtown 
against the segregated department stores and drinking fountains and other kinds of things. 
EC: Was this all during the [19]40s? Was that the—? 
TJ: This was during the [19]40’s and into the [19]50’s. In fact, there’s a book 
done by the fellow who’s now the dean of students at the, at Yale College—Holloway, 
John Holloway, Jonathan Holloway—on the history of Howard. [25:00] And he deals with 
Timothy Jenkins 
11 
three professors: E. Franklin Frazier, he—. Let’s see. E. Franklin, Ralph Bunch, and 
there was a—. Harris, Samuel Harris, the famous economist who went to University of 
Chicago and made a name for himself. He talks about, in that book, the Howard fervor 
that was in the faculty during the [19]40’s and [19]50’s, and the conflicts that they had 
with the administration and the broader society. So the—. Howard has a nexus with all 
aspects of African American political activity almost from its beginnings, and so that was 
reflected in who the faculty were and also the kind of issues that were introduced into our 
studies, it involved what the faculty used as their academic focus. And it was worked 
through the entire context. 
So in my last year and also my term as student body president, the sit-ins erupted, 
and we were asked and approached to support the students who were in the South. And 
the student council decided to make a contribution to the legal defense and to the funding 
of the students who had been arrested. And we were confronted by the administration 
that said that the—. Since the student funds were compulsory that we could not 
appropriate funds that were compelled contributions from the students to use for political 
activity that was off-campus. And so we had a big confrontation on that, and we had, we- 
-. Ultimately the dean of students forbade our use of our bank account to support the sit- 
ins. Well, we found a little twist around that: when the, when the students decided to 
have a convention in Raleigh, North Carolina, we appropriated money to pay for the 
transportation of the students [Laughter] to go to the convention, [Laughter] and also for 
the hospitality at the convention, which wasn’t really a direct expenditure of the students 
or their direct action, but it was nevertheless in support of the movement. Dean—. Dr. 
Armour J. Blackburn, who was the dean of students at the time, was adamantly opposed 
Timothy Jenkins 
12 
to our political involvement. Fortunately Mordecai Johnson was president, and so we 
made appeals to him that overruled the vice president for student affairs to allow us to 
make that expenditure. 
EC: So did you--? What are some of the other ways that the sit-in movement 
affected you or affected Howard? 
TJ: Well, I think it’s safe to say, given the timing—Fm graduating in 1960, 
June 1960. The sit-in movement started in April, in its big manifestation. Of course, I 
learned through my participation in the campus chapter of the NAACP that the NAACP 
chapters had been involved in sit-ins long before 1960. In fact, one of the NAACP 
chairmen, Barbara Posey, in Oakland, I believe, was involved in sit-ins, and we were 
supporting as a chapter of the NAACP the sit-in movement then. But that wasn’t a 
campus-wide activity until after the [19]60s sit-ins became national headlines and a 
national mobilization of students. So it’s safe to say that there was limited direct 
involvement in that until after the [19]60s. As soon as I—. In my graduating year—. In 
fact, the point of my transition from undergrad to graduate—Stokely Carmichael, 
Courtland Cox, Dion Diamond, Jean Wheeley—Wheeler—and a number of other students 
had just been admitted as freshmen at Howard. And they were, as you know, stalwarts in 
the founding of SNCC and the activities of the whole [19]60’s revolution of the South. 
[30:00] So we sort of passed each other at the door. 
In the book that Stokely wrote called Ready for Revolution, he deals extensively 
with his Howard experience. And I think it’s a six- or seven-hundred-page book, but 
almost a hundred of those pages are devoted to his life at Howard. And he talks about the 
kind of cultural and political contests that he was engaged in. But he mentions, in a 
Timothy Jenkins 
13 
complimentary way, the handoff that I had provided for the students when I talked about 
the need for social activity and relevance and demands and direct action in his book. In 
fact, he made the complimentary remark that when—. After he listened to the 
administrators of Howard, that he listened to me, and he thought I was like a man among 
boys. [Laughter] 
But my association with the Howards continued after my graduation because the 
year following my graduation, I was elected the national affairs vice president of the 
United States National Student Association, which involved some six hundred or more 
campuses, of which Howard was a member. So I came back to the campus many times 
in the capacity as the vice president of the national student association and had lots of 
involvement with the—. What was then the new organization called the Nonviolent 
Action Group, which had started on campus, to integrate both lunch counters and also 
amusement parks and other things in the greater Washington area. So my continuing ties 
to various people at Howard went beyond my period as a, as an enrolled undergraduate. 
EC: Did you attend the SNCC founding meeting in Raleigh? 
TJ: You know, that’s a, that’s a question—, I have vague recollections of 
meetings and so many meetings, but I don’t think I was at Shaw. And there are a couple 
of reports and books that dispute that, but I don’t recall being at Shaw per se. But I 
quickly got involved in a big way with SNCC while I was national affairs vice president. 
While I was national affairs vice president, I was also on the executive committee of 
SNCC and the executive committee of the Students for a Democratic Society. And so 
that, again, kept me involved in a lot of student activity beyond the period of my 
undergrad tenure. 
Timothy Jenkins 
14 
EC: I have a list of participants at the conference, so I’ll check it and see if I 
can— 
TJ: Yeah, I don’t think— 
EC: —find you. 
TJ: —you’ll find me there. 
EC: Yeah. You have told me in the past that when you were—. That in your 
involvement with the US National Student Association that you were actually initially 
interested in being a vice president for—is it international affairs? And that you were sort 
of maneuvered into the—? 
TJ: Well, my introduction and original fascination and preoccupation with the 
National Student Association was through its international arm. I had gotten involved in 
what I mentioned, the ISRS, the International Student Relations Seminar, and I had 
participated in a delegation that went to Cuba. I had gone, hosted students from Africa 
and [the] Caribbean in the United States, and so I had a real focus on international affairs. 
And it was my intent when I went to the final congress as a student to run for the 
international affairs vice president. I had—. Did not know at the time that there was a 
heavy involvement from the CIA in the international arm of the National Student 
Association. They had, they had—. In fact, this International Student Relations Seminar 
that I participated in at Harvard was funded by the CIA. I didn’t know it at the time. It 
was certainly not disclosed. But the people who were the CIA operatives, who were also 
involved in the staff and advisors for the National Student Association, were very 
concerned that a person with my connections [35:00] with the South and with militancy 
and with the Civil Rights Movement and previous chairmanship of the local chapter of 
Timothy Jenkins 
15 
the NAACP and so forth could not be trusted to keep the confidentiality agreement that 
existed between international affairs officers of the International Students Association 
and the CIA. So at the convention when I was actively campaigning for international 
affairs vice president, they did a maneuver to prevent my selection by getting the 
convention to name me national affairs vice president by acclamation. [Laughter] So the- 
-. I was, I was not elected in the normal channels. I was preempted in my effort to 
become international affairs by this group of National Student Association alumnus, 
many of which were, in fact, CIA agents, [Laughter] after their—. Or maybe during, but 
certainly after their tenure as officers of the National Student Association. So that’s how 
I became national affairs vice president. But fortunately, [Laughs] that was when the sit- 
ins were in their explosion. So I was in a much more influential and important position 
[Laughter] as national affairs vice president than I ever could have been as international 
affairs vice president. So fate has a way of working things out. 
EC: I know that the US NSA had their annual congress—is that what it’s 
called— 
TJ: Yeah. 
EC: —in Minneapolis, in summer of 1960. And there was a debate about 
whether or not to support the Southern sit-ins? 
TJ: Oh, that was, that was a constant issue. The National Student Association 
had, has a policy of, basic policy declarations and individual resolutions that are adopted 
by the assembled group at their national conventions, called congresses. And for a long 
period of time, since Brown v. Board of Education, they had been taking positions on 
integration and the issues of integrated education in particular. And this was strongly 
Timothy Jenkins 
16 
resisted by the component of the membership that was Southern: places like Clemson, the 
University of Alabama, Texas A&M, all those schools were members of National Student 
Association, and they protested what they called “politicizing,” which should be just 
strictly student and educational issues, and getting involved in other things. Well, it 
succeeded to get the resolutions passed every year on education, but with the sit-ins, it 
was a bit of a departure from strictly educational subject matter to deal with social 
integration. And so there was a walkout of Southern schools protesting that. And I of 
course got involved with that, because we were supporting a resolution in support of the 
sit-in movement. That resolution passed, and we lost a large number of Southern schools 
as members as a result of that. 
We also had issues because during the time that I was national affairs vice 
president, that was the beginning of the young Bircher movement in the collegiate 
community. The Birchers were the youthful offshoot of the John Birch Society, and with 
the presidential election with Goldwater, there was a tremendous rightwing student 
element in the United States. They called themselves the Young Americans for Freedom, 
YAF, and they were very vocal. And many of the people who now are in the anti¬ 
abortion movement and shutting down Planned Parenthood, some of those same names 
are some of the same people who were in the YAF movement in the student days. And 
so that became a major confrontation of what to do with YAF. It culminated in my case 
in a particular incident when YAF invited Bill Buckley to be speaker at their side 
convention. They tried to get him as a speaker for the congress itself, and of course 
[40:00] we resisted that. But they had a parallel meeting that was adjacent to the campus 
that we were meeting on, and they invited Bill Buckley to speak. And after Bill Buckley 
Timothy Jenkins 
17 
spoke, I gave a rebuttal of what he had to say and accused him of being slave-owning, 
fascist mentality, [Laughter] which made the YAF people go ballistic, and they— 
EC: You were so politic. [Laughs] 
TJ: —they introduced a resolution to censor me, saying that I had abused my 
authority as national affairs vice president to speak on a political issue and without 
authorization and no resolution to support me. A big conflict arose, and we ultimately 
had a vote on the motion for censorship. And that, during that time we were able to 
expose all of the rightwing ideology and how it affects educational policy, international 
policy, political policy, military policy, etc. I have a recording in the records of that 
debate. And ultimately the resolution to censor me was defeated, and I was able to 
continue my career as national affairs vice president. But the politics of the rightwing 
were just beginning to take shape, and the Birchers that we now see as the Trump 
supporters are, were just beginning to organize and test their muscles. And the National 
Student Association became one of the forums in which that clash was revealed. 
EC: So one of the things that I know that during that year that you were 
national affairs vice president, you were very active in the sit-ins and supporting SNCC 
and bringing students and various groups together. One of the people that was also 
central was Ella Baker. Do you remember how you met Ella Baker, or can you describe 
us for her? [.s/c] 
TJ: Well, Ella Baker was kind of a great eminence in the world of civil rights 
for a long period of time. Of course, long before we were involved. She had been 
initially associated with the Pullman car porters and was a confidante and friend of A. 
Philip Randolph and had supported his call early on for a march on Washington back in 
Timothy Jenkins 
18 
the, in the [19]40’s and [19]50’s. She was instrumental in the management and operation 
and founding of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and she was an official 
on their staff. She was prominent in the YWCA movement. [The] YWCA movement 
was really a shelter for a lot of militant blacks in the [19]30s and [19]40s because with 
the label of “Christian” they were able to do a lot of political activity without being 
attacked. So she had grown up in that kind of organized labor and civil rights and 
community service environment. She was adopted as an advisor to SNCC, and as SNCC 
people, particularly in Atlanta, had become familiar with her—YWCA, where she was 
employed, had an office in Atlanta and became very close to some of the SNCC movers— 
SNCC movers and shakers. Well, she became kind of the godmother of SNCC. And my 
association with her grew as I got more and more involved in SNCC activity. I was 
surprised to see, when looking at some of my old records, that the meeting that was held 
of the SNCC executive committee in December after the founding of SNCC was held at 
the Butler Street Y in Atlanta, and when I read the minutes, I was surprised to see that I 
was chairing it. [Laughter] That was the meeting at which Marion Barry was replaced 
by, I believe, either Chuck McDew—. I think it was Chuck McDew became the next 
chairman of SNCC. So that put me in interface with Ella Baker in a really special way, 
and she’s risen in the world’s eyes as one of the matriarchs of the modem Civil Rights 
Movement. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: Okay. One ofthe things that happened that year that you were US NS A 
vice president was the Freedom Rides. And [45:00] did, were you ever tempted to join 
the Freedom Rides? 
Timothy Jenkins 
19 
TJ: No, I wouldn’t say that I was “tempted” to join the Freedom—. Freedom 
Rides came a little after my—. I was no longer an undergraduate; I was no longer national 
affairs vice president, really— 
EC: Oh, okay. 
TJ: —because the Freedom Rides came in [19]61. My term was the academic 
year from [19]60 to [19]61. So I was leaving NSA at that time and then enrolling in law 
school. I had a number of friends who of course I had met in the movement, in the 
SNCC meetings and also at Howard, who were participating in the Freedom Rides. But I 
never was directly involved in the Freedom Rides except to engage in fundraising and 
other kinds of support in the North for what they were doing in the South. Of course one 
of the interesting things was I was at Howard—I’m sorry, at Yale—and William Sloane 
Coffin, the chaplain at Yale, who participated in Freedom Rides, as you know, and was 
one of the historic figures there. And of course I interrelated with the, with Bill Coffin 
many times. I, in fact, was sent on funds that he raised from the Connecticut chapter of 
the Women’s League for Peace and Freedom to support Medgar Evers’s widow after his 
assassination. So my continuation with civil rights went into my law school years in a 
heavy way. And I was one of the principal circuit speakers to raise funds, along with the 
Freedom Singers, in all of the campuses in the United States because, having been 
national affairs vice president, I had contacts who were current officers of student 
organizations around the country and was able to open their doors as supporters and as 
forums for student activists to come and lecture and speak. 
EC: I know that one of the things that was going on in the summer of 1961 was 
a debate in SNCC about whether to focus on direct action or whether to move in the, in 
Timothy Jenkins 
20 
the direction of voter registration and political power. And I know that you were sort of a 
central figure in that debate or that discussion. Can you describe that and some of what 
was going on that summer? 
TJ: I think it’s important to appreciate that there was a kind of division of 
emphasis in the SNCC membership. There had been, from the beginning, a religious 
contingent of SNCC people who largely were influenced by the teachings of Jim Lawson, 
and they tended to be associated with the Nashville student community. Diane Nash and 
Marion also came from that Nashville environment. Jim Bevel and others. And their 
orientation to student—. To direct action was as a religious expression. Their notion was 
that they were doing something that was consistent with their Christian ethic and that the 
nonviolence was also a part of it because that was the Christian way to do things. Well, 
there were others who were interested in the objection—. In the objective of integration 
but didn’t come to the question from a religious perspective. They came with a greater 
interest in the politics of it and concern with social change as a business of the exercise of 
civic responsibility and prerogative. So at a given point the people who were the 
religious contingent were insisting that they be paramount and that that be paramount in 
the ideology of SNCC. At an early stage there was a question of what the name of the 
organization would be, and it was agreed that it’d be the Student Coordinating 
Committee. [50:00] And the people from Nashville insisted that “nonviolent” be added to 
the name as a way to distinguish it from other kinds of student organizations like 
Students for a Democratic Society and Northern Student Movement and other kind of 
things. 
Timothy Jenkins 
21 
Well, at a given point the dichotomy of objectives became so pronounced that 
there was a fear of the organization splitting along the lines of the religious oriented and 
the secular oriented. And of course I was in the secular side of that question. And Ella 
Baker was instrumental in harmonizing the two diverging interests. There’s a letter that 
she wrote to me in my years as the national affairs vice president, urging that SNCC not 
have this difference that would be disruptive to the ultimate purpose. So that was a real 
expression of her influence that was critical for the survival of SNCC. And of course 
during that whole period she was very supportive of the kinds of efforts that we were 
trying to do with political voter registration as the real method of change. 
It was, it was my view, and I think it was shared by Charles Sherrod, Charles 
McDew, and Charles Jones, as the three Charleses, that supported the approach of politics 
over religion. And we were adamant that you could not really change the South unless 
you changed its politics, that all that business of wade-ins and sit-ins and pray-ins was 
fine, from a cosmetic point of view, but it didn’t alter the status and the political situation 
of black people, that that was only going to be altered when you took the control of the 
organs of state. Because the organs of state determined who the police chief was. The 
organs of state determined which roads were going to be paved. The organs of state 
determined what the budget was going to be in college and in primary and secondary 
school. The organs of state determined who was going to have access to public 
employment. And unless you took control of the organs of state, you would be out there 
as beggars, not as really determinants of the right in a material way. 
So from our point of view voting was the key. We borrowed the, Nkrumah’s 
encomium from the New Testament, the “Seek ye first the political rights, and all the rest 
Timothy Jenkins 
22 
shall be added unto you.” [Laughter] And we thought that the political rights were more 
important than the spiritual rights that were enhoused in [the] sit-in movement. So the 
direct action campaign and the voting rights campaign also were competitive on 
resources. Who were the groups that would support which? And so that became another 
aspect of the contest between. 
EC: And that same summer you’re meeting with other people. So you’re 
meeting with Harry Belafonte and the members of the Kennedy administration about this 
question too? 
TJ: Well, there was a kind of focus meeting that was held at the Cappahosic, 
Virginia, which the Kennedy administration operatives were seeking to influence the 
direction of the movement to emphasize the business of political as opposed to 
confrontational street demonstrations. And that was really motivated from two points of 
view. One, the street demonstrations were volatile. They frequently erupted or invoked, 
or provoked, violence. And they were unpredictable. And the voter campaign also had 
more statutory and constitutional justification for federal involvement than some of these 
other social things. So they were interested in [55:00] procuring a more orderly political 
protest. Well, their interests coincided with our interests, from our perspective, because 
unless and until we had political rights, the others would not be secure. So we were 
interested in promoting voting as a primary thrust because we saw that as the real engine 
for change. Now, historians have distorted that, and some have characterized—even our 
good friend Howard Zinn—as something, we were co-opted by the Kennedy 
administration to go away from demonstrations. I—. That’s not correct. We weren’t co¬ 
opted. If anything, we were co-opting them to become supporters and invested in what 
Timothy Jenkins 
23 
we wanted to do. Granted, they had a political interest as well. If they could change the 
South, if they could have more blacks voting, if the blacks who voted were more 
Democratic or ran into their politics, that would be a gain for them. But that was very 
secondary to anything we were concerned with. We didn’t care whether they voted 
Republicans or Democrats; we wanted them to be able to vote so their voices would be 
heard. And if the administration was prepared to support getting us the right to vote, then 
we were prepared to invite their support in every way we could: monetarily, politically, 
and of course through the powers of the courts. That was the nature of the relationship, 
and we had this sort of culminating meeting in Cappahosic, Virginia, and that brought 
together the assistant attorney general for civil rights, Harris Wofford, who was the 
special assistant to the president, and Burke Marshall, who was, who was to become the 
assistant secretary—. Assistant attorney general for civil rights. This was a kind of 
seminal meeting that launched an integrated, comprehensive, South-wide voter education 
campaign. At that conference, we had Charlie Jones, Charles Sherrod, and Charles 
McDew as participants, as was I. It was at that time that we established the foundations 
of a relationship with operatives in the Justice Department and in the White House in 
support of what we wanted to do. And they of course wanted to give support to the 
political change in the South as well. 
EC: I know that one of the points of contention, at least for a few people—I 
think Diane Nash, I’ve read her comments on this—that one of the things on the table was 
how the Kennedy administration would handle the drafting of the young men working on 
voter registration, and she felt that that might be a way of manipulating people if they 
were going to defer draft. 
Timothy Jenkins 
24 
TJ: Well, one of the peculiarities of the draft machinery is that there are local 
drafting boards. There’s not a national drafting board, per se. Those are locally 
determined. And the people who sit on those local draft boards are usually the nominees 
of the elected officials. So the draft board of Mississippi reflects the politicians of 
Mississippi. And they have the prerogative within the range of statutes to select people 
and to go after people to draft people based on their own motives. And of course they did 
use that authority to target SNCC activists and other civil rights activists to get them off 
the streets and put them away for [the] equivalent of three years. 
In fact, one of the organizations that I was associated with later took on that issue. 
It was the National Conference of Black Lawyers, NCBL. And during my career as a 
lawyer in the, in the trenches, one of the issues we went after was the improper use by 
General Hershey, who was then the head of whatever the formal title of the registration 
effort—. He was going after SNCC people with a vengeance! We even had one case 
where they went after one of our [1:00:00] students, activists, and imprisoned him, even 
though the statute said that the enforcement of the draft was only pertaining to people 
under twenty-three years of age, and he was more than twenty-three years of age! We 
ultimately took that to the court and got it thrown out. But that just showed that clearly 
the administration was not using all of its muscle to support what we wanted to do. It 
was manifested also in a more direct way in the voting registration question, and that’s 
where I think SNCC made its, some of its major contributions, because we succeeded in 
the testimony on the Voting Rights Act to force the administration to amend their draft to 
include a provision that said that voting-rights cases would be heard by a three-judge 
court, not by a single judge. That was critical. The whole Voting Rights Act would have 
Timothy Jenkins 
25 
had no life in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana if the judges that 
were appointed by the senators of those states were making those decisions! 
So we made the determination that we needed a provision to create an exception 
in voting-rights cases so that they would not be tried by a single sitting judge but rather 
be a three-judge panel with two of the three named by the chief judge of the court of 
appeals. That was strategic because the Supreme Court had made clear that the whole 
business of the selection of the—. I’ve lost my thoughts. 
EC: Of the judges to hear—. 
TJ: Yeah, that the business of the selection of judges was a political question 
and not a legal question. And that meant that the political process had to solve it. The 
only way we could get a political process to solve it was to have three judges because 
then the court of appeals would name the judges. As politics would have it, most of the 
judges of the court of appeals had been appointed by Eisenhower. And they were 
Republicans. And they were interested in allowing blacks to vote. Therefore when the 
chief judge of the Fifth Circuit, which covered most of the Southern states, made 
appointments, he would put two sympathetic judges on the panel with one unsympathetic 
judge. And that allowed us to win most of those cases. 
Well, that becomes part of the sophisticated way in which we were both allied and 
opposed to the Kennedy administration. Because Kennedy was really not interested in 
supporting that three-judge court. He opposed it in testimony before the House Judiciary 
Committee. And we succeeded in convincing Chairman Celler from New York, to go 
with us, and we over—. And frankly, we got Republicans on the House Judiciary 
Committee to go vote with us to overwhelm the Democrats from the South [Laughter] 
Timothy Jenkins 
26 
who voted against it. So the politics of this is sophisticated beyond the normal black and 
white of “We were supporting Kennedy; we weren’t supporting; he was supporting us.” 
It was, it was more subtle than that. It’d get down to the fine granulations of where the 
interests lie, and partisan politics is sometimes irrelevant to racial politics. SNCC was in 
it for racial politics, not for partisan politics. 
EC: I know one of the other things that you did that summer of 1961 was raise 
the money and organize a seminar. I can’t remember, what was the formal name of the 
seminar in Nashville? 
TJ: Oh, well, what I was really trying to do in Nashville was replicate the 
Little Forum experience that I had had at Howard. It was clear to me from interacting 
with the students who were the leadership of the, of the sit-in movement that they had no 
exposure to the questions of black history, civil rights struggle, racial conflict, 
constitutional context, international implications, because they were raised in a, in an 
educational system that [1:05:00] forbade that kind of exposure and information. So 
what I wanted to do was I wanted to have a kind of cram course to invite the leaders of 
the sit-in movement to sit down with some of the top minds who were knowledgeable on 
the racial implications of politics, economics, sociology, and learn. And that was the 
seminar that I put together. It was supported by the New World Foundation, the Laconic 
Foundation; it may have had some Ford money. And it was supported by Dr. King. He 
wrote a letter of support. Ella Baker, in the two-page letter that was later republished in a 
recent conference, she supported it, and she supported the concept of bringing together 
the whole SNCC mechanism to do the voter registration thing in a major way. And that 
conference I called the first Freedom School, because it was the first time many of these 
Timothy Jenkins 
27 
students who were in the South had ever been exposed to that kind of saturated black 
history and history of political struggle and the history of racism in America. So I 
celebrate that seminar as one of the few places that I had a chance to touch the pages of 
history. 
EC: I always point to that seminar to my students when they’re interested in 
protest, the sort of—. That, and actually, Stokely Carmichael’s chapter on Howard and 
sort of the intersection of education and protest in a meaningful way. It’s kind of—. 
Speaking of Stokely Carmichael, it’s kind of interesting, because the Na—. In many 
ways, your orientation is towards the political end of things, and the seminar’s located in 
Nashville, which is the stronghold of the more religious direct action phase of the Civil 
Rights Movement. And Stokely Carmichael writes in his memoir about that seminar 
that—. Getting in trouble because of his involvement in one of the demonstrations that 
came along with that. I don't know if you remember any of those dynamics at all or not. 
Do you know what I’m talking about? 
TJ: I certainly know the seminar, but I don’t know of a particular 
demonstration as a sidebar to that. 
EC: He said that they were doing some demonstrations in downtown 
Nashville, and he got in trouble for not being explicitly nonviolent in every way. And—. 
But that’s sort of a distraction. 
TJ: But we, but we selected, we selected Nashville because they have 
historically had a thing called the Race Relations Institute, which goes way back to the 
[19]30’s, and have a long and celebrated history of bringing blacks and whites and 
thinkers together to talk about issues of race. So it really made sense, from a historic 
Timothy Jenkins 
28 
perspective, to hold our seminar in the cradle of Fisk University, which was the sponsor 
of the Race Relations Institute historically. So that’s why we ended up at Nashville. It 
wasn’t because we were there by the religious persuasion of Jim Lawson or Diane Nash 
or others. 
EC: But the sort of educational mission and history there. Were you at--? Do 
you have memories of the Highlander meeting in August 1961 where this debate kind of 
came to a head of the direct action and the voter registration, and Ella Baker kind of 
pulled things together? 
TJ: There were so many meetings that it’s hard for me to distinguish one from 
the other. We had many meetings where that happened, and many of them were held at 
the, at Highlander. And Highlander was a favorable place to be uninterrupted, out in the 
woods, so we could eat and sleep with the subject matter and not be disturbed. So I can’t 
even distinguish a single Highlander meeting— 
EC: [Laughs] Sure. 
TJ: —because I was in and out of Highlander all the time, [Laughs] and we 
were always meeting on the same subjects of civil rights. 
EC: So that reminds me, there was a letter that you shared recently, and you 
told me about, I think it was leaving Highlander, and you and Ella Baker were in a car 
with a group of people, and there was an accident? 
TJ: Well, it was, it was really an attempt to injure us, but, [Laughs] more than 
an accident. [1:10:00] It was a provoked act of violence. We were going from 
Highlander Folk School, which is in Monteagle, Tennessee, to the airport in Chattanooga. 
And along the way—. We were riding in one of these little boxy Volkswagen buses. And 
Timothy Jenkins 
29 
we were in there singing and doing our normal movement stuff, and this ten-wheeler or 
eight-wheeler truck came along with a driver who saw that it was an integrated group. 
And he pushed us off the highway. And as you know, that’s the Chattanooga mountains. 
Those are very rough, steep places. And we almost went crashing over and down into the 
ravine below, but for being stopped by a tree that happened to be between us and the 
bottom. We sat for quite a bit of time, rocking back and forth such that if we shifted our 
weight too much to one side or the other, we would’ve gone down. Fortunately before 
we went down a pickup truck was mobilized and came and hooked the front of our bus 
and pulled us out of that ravine. 
[Laughs] Ella Baker was not a person who particularly emphasized her religious 
tenets. In fact, she was very skeptical, having seen ministers up close for a long period of 
time, about the ethics and importance of what they were really doing. And she used to 
always ridicule the statement that she learned as a child, “Thank God for Jesus.” She 
used to toy with us and say, “Now, what does that mean? How could that have any 
meaning? What significa—, I mean, ‘Thank God for Jesus.’” Well, after we had this 
incident in the Cumberland Mountains, and the tow truck pulled us out before we had 
slipped down to the ravine, Ella, when she was on her stretcher being taken to the 
ambulance, motioned for me to come close to her. And I did. And she said, “Thank God 
for Jesus.” 
EC: [Laughs] You know, I’ve seen some letters by her where she expressed a 
desire to be part of the Freedom Rides but that she said after this accident and hitting her 
head, she didn’t think it was probably the best use of her time to, and—. And, you know, 
there was other work that needed to be done, but also she probably shouldn’t offer up her 
Timothy Jenkins 
30 
head to the segregationists for [Laughs] on the Freedom Ride. And I never knew the 
context of that accident until you told me about that, or the incident. 
And that fall you started school at Yale, law school at Yale, and at the same time 
SNCC moves into McComb for the first voter registration project at the end of that 
summer. What was your, what was your motivation or your thinking about why you 
entered law school? 
TJ: Well, there were two prongs. One was the business of having some skills 
for [an] ultimate career and to have skills that were relevant for social change that would 
be meaningful as opposed to peripheral. 
The second was part of a scheme to make sure that we had some people who 
survived during what could have been a disaster, either through murder, incarceration, or 
the draft. Our fear was that all of the SNCC people could be wiped out in an overnight 
event if we were all vulnerably located in the South in our various projects. So the 
suggestion was made that maybe we should have some who would be out of the reach of 
those disasters, and I might be a good candidate for that, and going ahead with enrolling 
[1:15:00] at Yale in New Haven, where I would be, have a student’s exemption, where 
we certainly wouldn’t have any violence question, and I could be useful in continuing to 
mobilize white campuses as supporters and to continue to get volunteers from those 
campuses to go to the South for various stints of time, either for the summer project in 
Mississippi or the other things of voter registration in some of the rural areas of 
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. So I went to law school with that 
dual purpose of sort of being like Che Guevara in the Sierra Madres that would come 
Timothy Jenkins 
31 
back to reestablish SNCC if it had been wiped out, or, on the other hand, going and 
getting a set of degrees that would be helpful with the long-term movement. 
And thirdly, to be a Northern voice for SNCC. And I did organize concert tours 
for the Freedom Singers and many speaking engagements at all of those campuses from 
New Hampshire on down to Pennsylvania, New York, and—. So it served multiple 
purposes to be at the law school. And of course being at the law school also gave me 
another set of professional contacts and mobilizers for SNCC. William Sloane Coffin, 
who was the chaplain at Yale, was ultimately recruited to be a Freedom Rider. And 
that’s no accident. And he also brought another colleague of his from Old Westbury to 
be a part of it too, and Wesleyan University in Connecticut. 
So being in New Haven was really a Northern adjunct to SNCC. And it was at 
New Haven that I came to know Peter Countryman and Joan Countryman, who started a 
thing called the Northern Student Movement. And the Northern Student Movement was 
designed to do in the North exactly what we were doing in the South. And the Northern 
Student Movement was one of the unsung heroes of that whole era. And I was able to do 
that, having met them in New Haven. So New Haven had a lot of fallout both for me 
personally and for, I think, the movement. 
EC: What are some of the things that you think are significant about the 
Northern Student Movement as an unsung hero? 
TJ: Well, the fact that they got people who would take a year off from school, 
and instead of going to Paris or Heidelberg or some place, or Rome, that they would go to 
the South and spend a dedicated period of time working with poor people; that they 
would teach schools, Freedom Schools; that they’d create health clinics; that they would 
Timothy Jenkins 
32 
create, again, social organizations. And the Northern Student Movement was not alone. 
There was the Young Christian Students, YCS, which did similar things. And, before it 
turned more political, the SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. There were several 
satellite student organizations which were non-Southern which were critical to the 
success of what was happening in the South. And the communications were facilitated 
by the fact that they had organizational corpus that was independent, independently 
funded, and also able to be supportive and auxiliary to what SNCC was doing. And 
Northern Student Movement was perhaps the most prominent of those dedicated to the 
question of civil rights alone. 
EC: In fall [19]61, when SNCC’s working in McComb and then extends to 
some of the surrounding areas, so, I guess, so part of, so the voter registration push that 
you’re a part of sort of connects with Bob Moses, who had come to voter registration by 
way of Ella Baker and Amzie Moore, and kind of meet up in McComb. Do you have 
something to show? 
TJ: Well, there’s this letter that Ella Baker sent to me, dated [1:20:00] June 21, 
1961. In that letter, she introduces me to Bob Moses and to Amzie Moore and to a 
number of other people who ultimately were the backbone of the voter registration effort 
in Mississippi. Of course that voter registration focus on McComb was one that we 
contrived to be a kind of catalyst for statewide effort. We chose McComb because it was 
very rural, very isolated, and nobody else wanted it. [Laughter] In the competition for 
funds for voter registration, the NAACP wanted Atlanta, SCLC wanted Montgomery, 
CORE wanted Louisiana and New Orleans and Bogalusa. Nobody wanted—. [Laughter] 
EC: Mississippi. 
Timothy Jenkins 
33 
TJ: McComb. [Laughter] But SNCC thought it important to go into one of the 
most hostile and remote areas of the movement and make a beachhead there that could be 
a model for the rest of the South. And that’s how we ended up with McComb as a 
designated place. Of course, we also had, through the good offices of Ella Baker and 
Amzie Moore and Bob Moses, contacts of people in those areas that would house us and 
allow us to come and operate. 
McComb had another unique asset, and it was a building that the police would not 
touch. It had a Masonic lodge that was there in McComb, black Masonic lodge, which 
had a history of militant behavior and immunity from police violence. I don't know what 
it—. What it is, whether it’s Masonic Brotherhood or what have you, but for some reason, 
Masonic lodges became housing for much of SNCC in Jackson and other places because 
there seemed to be a Southern white abhorrence about defiling a Masonic lodge! So we 
found—. [Laughter] Once we found that out, where were we going to hold our meetings? 
We were going to hold our meetings at the Masonic lodge! So they had to find a facility 
there at [a] Masonic lodge that allowed us to mobilize our movement quite successfully. 
There’s an antidote [.s/c] that I should tell you. When we were traveling down 
from Chicago to McComb for the very beginning of our effort there, we drove through 
Alabama. And we had an experience in a little city called Deal. Chuck McDew, Charles 
Sherrod, and Charlie Jones, and I, were driving in this old jalopy. And in Deal we hit this 
dog that ran out between two parked cars. On the heels of that incident, this lady, elderly 
white lady, started complaining and screaming in the street that we had killed her dog and 
that she wanted compensation for it. This crowd was beginning to form around the car, 
and the question was were we going to pay, how much we were going to pay, or whether 
Timothy Jenkins 
34 
we were going to pay, and we divided—. Chuck McDew and I didn’t want to pay 
anything. Charlie Jones [Laughs] and Sherrod wanted to pay something. 
While we were in the midst of this, and the crowd was getting more and more 
hostile and starting to close in on us, this elderly man with a white linen suit and one of 
those fine straw hats came down from a porch that was adjacent to the accident scene. 
He obviously was a figure of authority in the community, because they cleared a path for 
him as he came through the crowd. He said, “I saw the whole thing, and there was 
nothing these boys could have done to avoid hitting that dog. And they didn’t have any 
way that they could possibly [1:25:00] keep out of the path that they were in, because 
there were cars on both sides.” And that quelled the crowd. Then he turned to us and 
said, “I don't know how long I can keep these sons of bitches quiet. [Laughter] Y’all 
boys better get out of here.” [Laughter] We drove from there to— 
EC: You didn’t need to be asked twice. 
TJ: —without a stop from Deal, Alabama, to Mississippi. And it was the first 
time in my life I was glad to see a sign saying, “Welcome to the Magnolia State.” 
[Laughter] 
EC: You never know how it’s going to go. So McComb, what was your 
assessment of McComb and the work in McComb at the time? 
TJ: Well, I guess the best thing I can say about McComb is that it’s still there. 
[Laughter] I mean, it’s still going. Students are vitally involved in the history of the civil 
rights. They’re doing student projects. They have engaged the local school in creating a 
[stable?] part of black history in their curricula. They have youngsters who have taken 
time to devote themselves for summers on this. They have scholarship programs to get 
Timothy Jenkins 
35 
the, some of the McComb students into higher education. The local community hasn’t 
just withered at the termination of our particular project. The local people in McComb 
are still there, and they’re still advocating for their rights. And, very importantly, they’re 
passing on to the next generation of youngsters the lessons of yesterday. So I think 
McComb really represents a high point in our efforts, because we established a 
beachhead in the rural and most backward corner of the country that has still survived. 
EC: And is that McComb work, does that involve Teaching for Change? 
TJ: Teaching for Change has been an institutional arm to make McComb real. 
Teaching for Change, of course, is an organization that tries to do that in a broad way 
across many different places. But the McComb project has been kind of a poster child 
for the success that can come from working with schoolteachers and with parents in local 
communities. And to make them feel that they can change the direction of the education 
of their kids by having them understand more deeply the importance of history and the 
social engagement that the community had, not just the schools. 
EC: One of the things that happened as part of the McComb movement is that 
Moses moved into some of the surrounding even more rural communities, and in the 
process, one of the people that was helping him, Herbert Lee, was murdered by a state 
representative. What was it like to be in your early twenties and dealing with, you know, 
life and death? 
TJ: Well, I particularly point to that Herbert Lee story as a teaching tool in 
mobilization of black voters throughout the state. I found one of the old WBAI 
recordings of a speech I gave in, I guess, [19]62 or [19]63, in Holmes County. And the 
focal point of that discussion was the business of the Herbert Lee story and the 
Timothy Jenkins 
36 
importance of not letting Herbert Lee die in vain. The—. Of course, Bob Moses, in his 
own saintly way, has had a tremendous influence, and all of the details of how that 
influence has been felt are still not fully known. But certainly his willingness to go out 
and live among the people in a really—. As an intellectual gorilla, if you will, to create 
an, from a grounds-up movement of people who demand change, is the symbol of what 
the organization Teaching for Change is trying to do. It’s trying to introduce through the 
vehicle of public education the means by which self-help in the community can be 
mobilized. What we’ve done in Teaching for Change is to have a website [1:30:00] that 
does that, teachingforchange.org, connected with the Civil Rights Veterans Association. 
The One—SNCC One Vote, or One Vote SNCC, I forget which—dot-org are all 
techniques to make sure that this experience isn’t lost and doesn’t cease to be replicated 
in other communities around the country. Of course, Bob Moses’s influence in the whole 
of Mississippi is a part of a legend that is yet to be fully explored and told. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: I know that I saw a documentary maybe a year or so ago at the launch for 
the Civil Rights History Project website about Greenwood, Mississippi. And there was a, 
it showed you giving a speech in Greenwood, and you were talking about the Albany 
movement. Can you talk about what Greenwood was like then, what the Albany, 
Georgia movement was like then, and sort of your role moving in and out of these 
communities? 
TJ: Well, you say it was a speech at Greenwood, but I would say rabble- 
rousing. [Laughter] 
EC: I like that word. [Laughs] 
Timothy Jenkins 
37 
TJ: I was, I was leading a sing-in. It was the only time that I’d been able to 
sing with Bobby Dylan, Pete Seeger, and—. Oh, I forget his name. Just died. 
EC: He was a folk singer? 
TJ: Yeah. 
Male 1: ( ) 
EC: Bikel? 
TJ: Theodore Bikel, Theodore Bikel. But it, Greenwood represents one of the 
triumphs in another way. Mrs. McGhee, who owned the farm, was a militant person and 
who protected her farm with her sons and the use of firearms as a device to keep off the 
Klan and their sympathizers. Greenwood was a place where, again, local people who had 
no prior preparation for politics decided they’d had enough and they were going to 
participate in voter registration. That little film The Streets of Greenwood is, I think is 
only twenty minutes long, but it captures what was the essence of social change that 
affected people deeply, where even people who couldn’t pass the literacy test and 
therefore didn’t even try to register to vote felt obliged to help carry people in their cars 
to those places. People who couldn’t pass the literacy test were defenders of those who 
did want to take the test. And it became a, really a marvel of how people could stand up. 
Also, when they cut them off from the food stamps and so forth, Dick Gregory was 
helpful in getting money for the food supplies to be shipped into Greenwood so those 
people could survive through the winter. So Greenwood represents a real place of 
triumph. Now the elected officials in Greenwood and the county are all majority black, 
as a result of the success of the Greenwood movement. Albany, Georgia as well, I 
referenced in the, during one of my songs, that we’re not going to turn our, we’re not 
Timothy Jenkins 
38 
going to let Chief Pritchett turn us around. Chief Pritchett was a, was the worst kind of 
redneck law enforcers, or this law enforcers, in the—. Georgia. 
Albany, Georgia was a peculiar place because it’s southwest Georgia. All the 
attention was put in Atlanta, and it was progressive. But southwest Georgia had the 
heaviest population of black people in the state. And southwest Georgia was neglected. 
Charles Sherrod chose that as the place that he was going to spend his primary time. 
Charles was also successful in mobilizing an organization that came around to him in the 
grassroots fashion that was consistent with Ella Baker’s philosophy, let the people decide 
what they wanted to do. The people of Albany came around and decided that they 
wanted to vote, and they had marches, and they had demonstrations, and they went on for 
nights. [1:35:00] Sometimes they were even surrounded by police, in a hostile way. They 
were—. The police were not there to protect them. [Laughter] They were there to destroy 
them. And in fact they had mobs that were, that on occasion kept the blacks from—who 
were assembled in those churches—from even leaving for threat of violence. So Albany 
represents the rankest, most ferocious expression of police-sanctioned violence in the 
country. And maybe many people talk about Bull Connor in Birmingham and others, but 
there were never, but there was never a police force that was more vicious and violent 
than Albany, Georgia. 
At a certain point, they reached out and asked Dr. King to come and participate in 
some of the demonstrations, and he, to his great honor, did get involved and get SCLC 
involved. And the revolution was really not so much what they did politically, although 
they did change the politics in the sense that blacks were elected as well as able to vote, 
ultimately—. But Albany represents, again, one of those little spots of opportunity that 
Timothy Jenkins 
39 
SNCC was able to open up as a demonstration to the entire South of what could be done 
once the people decide to do it. 
EC: I know a lot of—. I don’t know a lot. Some scholars and some participa—. 
Some SCLC folks have described Albany as a failure, the Albany movement as a failure. 
How would you respond to that? 
TJ: Well, I think it depends on what perspective you came with in the first 
place. Was it the expectation that it was going to be a headline, celebrity case, the kind 
of vast movement of thousands of people that you had in Birmingham or in 
Montgomery? No, Albany was a rural area off the side roads of history. There were no 
celebrated victories that came all of a sudden. It was gradual. It was slow. It was multi¬ 
year. And there were no demonstrations that culminated in lots of television and so forth. 
There were a handful of things that were covered by people like Sutton in the New York 
Times, but others didn’t cover it. It wasn’t a focal point. It wasn’t a flashpoint that led to 
something bigger and broader and more extraordinary. But it was, in my view, a 
tremendous success. Because people who were going to lose their homes suddenly were 
able to get farmers home support. They were able to understand how the intricacies of 
public, of the Agriculture Department had to be manipulated and understood to fill out 
the forms to get the different things. And it even [Laughs] illustrated about the fact that 
Charles Sherrod’s wife ultimately became the administrator for one of the Department of 
Agriculture’s program in the Albany, Georgia area. No, I don't think Albany was a, was 
a failure. It was just a slow-boiling success [Laughter] instead of a rampant one. 
EC: And that was Shirley Sherrod who was in that major position? Was that 
the Department of Agriculture? 
Timothy Jenkins 
40 
TJ: Department of Agriculture, yes. 
EC: Can you, you mentioned—. You touched on it briefly, but can you tell us 
about that festival in Greenwood on Mrs. McGhee’s farm? What was that like? 
TJ: Well, there were, there were, there was a, there was a peculiar confluence 
of people. The—. It was intended to be a folk festival that would symbolize the culture of 
the region. All that people heard about the South made it sound like there was no culture 
there. But the Greenwood Folk Festival was to dispute that and to show that there was a 
great deal of culture that was not seen and not appreciated. It became a kind of 
institutional way in which the larger entertainment community could express its support 
for what the people of Greenwood were doing. And so their coming together with names 
like Seeger and Dylan and Joan Baez and— 
EC: Bikel? 
TJ: —Bikel [1:40:00] gave visibility to the people’s struggle in addition to the 
music and culture that those people represented. So that was the surrounding parameters 
of what the Greenwood Folk Festival was all about. 
EC: You mentioned before that you did, helped arrange concerts or 
performances for the Freedom Singers and that you spoke at events with the Freedom 
Singers. Can you talk about the Freedom Singers and their role? 
TJ: Well, you know, there was a history of the use of music for important 
purposes. There were the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University. There were the Howard 
Gospel Singers that operated for years and still operate. One of the things that the, that 
SNCC had as a component of its whole approach to these matters was the mobilization of 
the people through song. It was appreciated that with the—. Particularly in the black 
Timothy Jenkins 
41 
community, where music and religious vocalizing was an important part of people, 
incorporating those songs and taking some of the words of those songs and changing 
them to be more focused on the current movement was one of the things that SNCC did. 
The “We Shall Overcome” is really a song that Charles Tindley wrote. He was a minister 
in the Methodist Church, and he was in my hometown of Philadelphia. And ‘TT1 
Overcome” and those—. He made it as a religious ballad, and of course with Jack [.s/c] 
Carawan and with Pete Seeger and with the Freedom Singers, we turned and said “We 
Shall Overcome” as a political anthem. But the whole business of the power of song is 
an important part of what the SNCC was all about, and it was one of the tools by which 
we could get the community investment and enthusiasm about what we wanted to do. 
And the songs had a—. In addition to the spiritual content, they also had a reinforcing 
impact on the kids who were in demonstrations, so they could feel that there was, there 
was solidarity and group involvement that gave them additional courage when they were 
locked up or when they even were in jail, they would sing those songs and be buoyed and 
encouraged to feel that they were not alone. So all the words of those songs and all the 
songs that were part of the movement’s hymnbook each have peculiar meaning to me. 
Even now, when you see the SNCC people sing those songs, they all get misty-eyed 
because those songs are so deeply connected to the history of the movement. 
EC: You mentioned earlier that William Sloane Coffin helped raise money for 
you to go support Myrlie Evers after Medgar Evers was assassinated? 
TJ: Yeah, I was of course a student at law school in New Haven, Yale. When 
we heard that Medgar had been assassinated, we were stunned and at a loss for what to 
do. And Coffin had a long-term association with the Women’s League for Peace and 
Timothy Jenkins 
42 
Freedom. There’s a great constitutional case called Uphaus v. Wyman on freedom of 
speech and the freedom of assembly. And the Uphaus of that case is in Connecticut, and 
he was associated with leftist organizations all the time. The Women’s League for Peace 
and Freedom was one of those organizations that was on the House Un-American 
Activities Committee’s list and so forth. But they are still, were still a vibrant 
organization, and they considered that the Southern movement was part of their mission. 
And they raised money to enable me to both travel to Jackson and to actually be the first 
person out of state [1:45:00] to go to Myrlie Evers’s door with a check from the 
Women’s League for Peace and Freedom in Connecticut, to let her know that she was not 
alone. 
EC: What was that like to do that? [pause] I know that in the Memorial March 
in Jackson, there was a confrontation between some of the marchers and the police. And 
I’ve heard, it was, was it WBAI? Is it the same? I heard a recording of you and Dave 
Dennis and some other people in that context. Do you recall that? 
TJ: Well, as you well know, the—. You’re talking about the aftermath of the 
funeral? Well, there’s a, there’s a public side and a private side. The public side was 
that, of course, there was this march after the funeral that was supposed to be a 
procession through a section of the city that had all been approved by the police and so 
forth. And the local youngsters—and SNCC people—didn’t like the orderliness and the 
confinement of having a police escort and so forth, and they wanted to go in a different 
direction and sing freedom songs and not be as solemn as the main body of the funeral 
wanted to be. So they broke off from the main march and were going to go in another 
direction, and of course the police made their response of trying to contain them and 
Timothy Jenkins 
43 
force them to go in a direction that they [were?] chosen. And that led to the confrontation 
that I think is recorded on the—. What’s Judy Richardson’s book, or film series? 
EC: Eyes on the Prizel 
TJ: Eyes on the Prize really describes that whole setting very thoroughly. The 
private side of that was a role that I played that had never been exposed. And that was 
while I was at that demonstration I was informed that there were a group of black 
veterans who were armed and were on the buildings surrounding the line of the march 
with an intention for violence. I was told that I’d better get up there or something was 
going to happen. And I went up to the roof overlooking the marchers just at the moment 
when John Doar, who was the assistant attorney general for civil rights, stepped out in 
front of the crowd, and Eyes on the Prize captures his statement, “I’m John Doar, you 
know I stand for what was right.” But from up on the roof they couldn’t hear John 
Dear’s words, and they didn’t know who John Doar was. And they thought that he was 
acting on behalf of the local police to contain and squelch the student protest! They had 
telescopic rifles, and they had John Doar lined up in their sights when I got to the roof. 
And I remember coming out there, saying, “Stop, in the name of Medgar.” And they 
stopped. That—. Can you imagine what the history of civil rights would have been if 
black veterans had assassinated John Doar? 
EC: No. I think we’d have a very different history, for sure. 
TJ: I’ve had, I’ve had what I consider three brushes with history. The first 
you mentioned was the business of having that first Freedom School for the SNCC 
leaders. The second was in Atlanta, when the SNCC affiliate called the Committee on 
Appeal for Human Rights was [1:50:00] organizing a demonstration to go down to the—I 
Timothy Jenkins 
44 
guess it’s Hart’s, or—the big department store in Atlanta. And there was a tremendous 
amount of pushback from that from the black leadership establishment. Their principle 
was that “We don’t have to have demonstrations in Atlanta. We’re able to sit across the 
table and negotiate these things out. So we don’t—. It’s disruptive and inappropriate for 
Atlanta to have these demonstrations.” And one of the promoters of that was “Daddy” 
King, Martin King’s father, who was opposed to demonstrating in Atlanta. We had this 
big meeting up—. I guess it was at Morehouse’s chapel, when the question was being 
hotly contested of whether we were going to have a demonstration, whether we weren’t, 
whether it was appropriate, whether we should follow the leadership of our elders or 
whether we shouldn’t. And I was one of the final speakers at that rally and urged that 
they go forward with the demonstration—. And that they not only go forward with the 
demonstration, but that they take the route of the demonstration to Martin Luther King’s 
house and ask him to come out and participate, in spite of the fact that his father was on 
the record as opposed to any such direct action in Atlanta. That was the decision of the 
group, that they’d go forward with the demonstration, and that they would call on Dr. 
King to join them. To his immortal credit, he did. When he participated in that 
demonstration, it resulted in his arrest, just two days before the Kennedy/Nixon election. 
And Bobby Kennedy sent Coretta King a now-famous telegram saying that they would 
support in any way they could Dr. King and his release and his protection in jail and so 
forth. That incident was then captured in leaflets and handouts by the United Automobile 
Workers and the United Packinghouse Workers and distributed all across the major areas 
of the United States, from Boston to Philadelphia to Newark to Chicago to Detroit to 
Houston. It is statistically agreed that at the point of that date in the election cycle, the 
Timothy Jenkins 
45 
black vote was equidistant between Kennedy and Nixon. After that torrent of leaflets and 
mobilization and communication in the black community, some 250,000 people who 
were not prepared to even vote did vote, and they voted for Kennedy. Kennedy won that 
election by 100,000 votes. So I consider that that was the second place I had some 
contact with history. And the third place was in the John Doar survival. 
EC: Yeah. That demonstration in Atlanta, that—. Was that in conjunc—. Oh, 
the grocery—. I mean, the department store is Rich’s, in Atlanta. 
TJ: Ah, yes, Rich’s. 
EC: The big one in Rich’s. 
TJ: Rich’s. 
EC: Was that in conjunction with SNCC’s October 1960 conference, the one 
that decided the organization to keep going, and you headlined the mass meeting to close 
that? Is that the same? I know it was close in time, but I can’t remember—. 
TJ: Well, the, this was—. The unique thing that I’m recalling is the mass 
meeting for the demonstration. I don’t remember an association of that with a conference 
per se. 
EC: Okay. Yeah. I—. The timing is close, but I’m not sure. 
TJ: It might have been connected, but I, but I don’t, I don’t—. There’s no 
strong connection in my mind. 
EC: Sure. One of the things that I know that you remained involved with 
throughout this period, of course, is SNCC’s push in multiple directions for political 
power, voting registration and political power. And you mentioned, not today but in 
Timothy Jenkins 
46 
another context, a white lawyer from Mississippi, Bill Higgs, and the two of you worked 
on some things together? 
TJ: Well, in all fairness, I have to say that Bill was the guiding spirit in the 
business of that three-judge court amendment being added to the Voting Rights Act. Bill 
Higgs was an unusual guy. He was a native-born Mississippian, went to Old Miss, and 
was also a Harvard Law graduate. And while he had many, many invitations and 
opportunities to merge with white upper crust of Mississippi, he chose to make his whole 
career in civil rights litigation. And he not only participated in helping to write that 
legislation, but in defending the other black lawyers who were frequently under attack in 
the courts, both federal as well as local. Judge Cox, who was an appointee resulting from 
Eastland being chairman of the judiciary committee, used to call blacks the n-word in 
court, and lawyers, and submit them to all kinds of ignominities. And Bill Higgs was one 
of the few white lawyers in the South, and probably the only white lawyer in Mississippi, 
who would take civil rights cases fearlessly throughout his entire career. 
EC: Did you ever know or hear of an attorney from Mississippi called, named 
William Reedy, Bill Reedy? 
TJ: I don't know. 
EC: From Meridian? We just met him, and I’m trying to place him. What 
were some of the things that you worked on in relation to voting and politics with SNCC 
that we haven’t talked about? The--. Were you involved with the MFDP? 
TJ: Oh, yes. Larry Guyot, Lawrence Guyot—we all just know him as 
“Guyot”—who was the president of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, gives me 
and the group of student lawyers that I was associated with during the summers that I was 
Timothy Jenkins 
47 
at Yale Law School with having found in the statutes of Mississippi the provision that 
allowed for protest voting and for the establishment of local political parties. That was 
the foundation for developing first mock elections for the Mississippi Freedom 
Democratic Party and then ultimately the participation in the Democratic party itself. 
That I think is a—. We found—. Bill Wood, who was also a student at Yale Law School 
at the time, was working with me, and we found in the Mississippi Code a provision 
which really had been put there in the Reconstruction era to protect white people 
[Laughter] who were then being excluded by the Republican party that was controlling 
politics in Mississippi. It allowed for protest votes, and it allowed for challenges, and it 
allowed for independent election activities. So that’s one of the little hooks and crooks of 
the Mississippi law that we were able to find. 
Other work in the voter registration is most important in the years after SNCC, 
where statewide mobilizations through the black elected officials, through lead—the 
leadership conference of—what is it called? The—, I think it was called the Black 
Leadership Council or Forum—that got behind voter registration in a big way, getting the 
unions and getting others and creating this multiple foundation-supported thing called the 
Voter Education Project. The Voter Education Project that was handled—. Was headed 
for years by Leo Bryan [.v/c] and then by [2:00:00] Vernon Jordan, it became a way in 
which philanthropic money could be channeled in a tax-exempt way to voter registration. 
And crafting that and putting that together and making sure that it was adequately 
supported was one of the things that we were able to do in a unique way. And I think it 
made a lot of difference, and Fm sure Vernon Jordan would be able to attest that much of 
the South and its change was largely a result of the Voter Education Project. 
Timothy Jenkins 
48 
Significantly, however, the Voter Education Project, YEP, refused to go into Mississippi. 
And so when the—. Bob Moses and SNCC went to McComb and to Greenwood, they 
were on their own, because the Voter Education Project considered that those places were 
too hot and too unlikely to have a result. So that made the heroic intervention of politics 
in Mississippi all the more important. 
Male 1: ( ) 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
TJ: That’s very finely documented in an article by Dr. Larry Rivers that 
appeared in the Journal ofAfiican American History. And what it talks about is the 
influence that Mordecai Johnson had on the whole underpinnings, philosophically, of the 
direct action-nonviolence movement. That article [is] called, I believe, “The Rankin 
Chapel and Howard University Connection to Dr. Martin Luther King.” Something to 
that effect. Mordecai Johnson was heard by Dr. King in Philadelphia at an occasion 
when Dr. Johnson was a student at Crozer Theological Seminary. And he’d come into 
Philadelphia for a weekend to hear this speaker, Mordecai Way 
tt Johnson. Mordecai Johnson was a mentor of mine, as I’ve mentioned, when I 
was a student leader. But he was a person who also had spent a lifetime looking at the 
whole question of nonviolence in international and national contexts. And he was an 
aficionado of Mahatma Gandhi. One of his vice presidents, William Stuart Nelson, even 
took a leave of absence from being vice president to go and live in India. He came back 
with such a vibrant impression of the power of nonviolence that it became a cardinal part 
of what Mordecai spoke to the rest of his life. 
Timothy Jenkins 
49 
Dr. King was so impacted by that speech by Mordecai Johnson that he said he 
locked himself in his room for the next ten days and read every book he could get on 
Mahatma Gandhi. And that was the change of his mind to see that nonviolence was a 
cardinal part of his life. Frequently it’s said that Dr. King’s inspiration came from 
Thoreau and Emerson and Carlyle and Tillich. But if you listen to Mordecai—. I mean, if 
you listen to Dr. King himself, he attributes it to Mordecai Johnson. I’ve heard him say 
that to me personally, and he’s said it to history in a way that has been distorted by others 
and lost. 
EC: Are there other things about the movement that we haven’t talked about, 
the sort of mass movement of the [19]60s, that you think are important? 
TJ: Well, I think that the—. That what we have to make sure is people don’t 
think of the movement as something that only existed when there was a thing called 
SNCC or when the people were in the streets. [2:05:00] There were successor 
organizations that adopted the techniques of SNCC and direct action that have gone into 
the women’s movement, gone into the movement for disabilities, gone into the movement 
of poor people, gone into the movement for income equality, gone into movement for 
gender differentiation and protection. All of these things, in my view, benefit from the 
seeds of the direct movement of SNCC, and the techniques and the DNA of SNCC is in 
all of those subsequent movements. 
The other thing that I would have on the record is that there are things that aren’t 
related to direct action at all but are related to social change that were inspired by SNCC. 
One of those is the National Conference of Black Lawyers. The National Conference of 
Black Lawyers was started in 1968, and—. On a call from Floyd McKissick, who thought 
Timothy Jenkins 
50 
that the black bar needed to move beyond just the narrow focus of civil rights as it was 
known up to Brown v. Board of Education, to get into other areas of federal regulations, 
federal and local economic development programs, poverty programs, housing programs, 
other kinds of applications of defending the rights of the people who have no voice. And 
I think that there’s a tendency to gainsay the relevance of those earlier movements on 
those later movements. But when you look at those lawyers who made up the National 
Conference of Black Lawyers, started in 1968, they just had their hundred and—. Not 
hundred, but their forty-sixth anniversary conference in Durham, North Carolina this 
summer. [Coughs] The people who went through that: Judge Leon Higginbotham, from 
the Third Circuit; Nathan Jones, chief judge of the Ninth Circuit; Bruce, Bruce Wright, 
New York Court—. Any number of judges, any number of lawyers—Raymond Pace 
Alexander, who handled the case, the Girard College case that established that there 
could be no discrimination in charitable-funded organizations—that was all the offspring 
of the direct action campaign that went in other directions. And I think it’s significant to 
know that institutions like the National Conference of Black Lawyers have been felt in 
other ways. They defeated the appointment of Haynsworth and Carswell to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. They have been working—. The hand of SNCC is under a lot 
of things moving in an invisible way to change society and America. And it’s not known, 
except for those few of us who have been part of both, that they’re really the same 
movement. 
EC: So speaking of that, there’s, historically and today, a very strong SNCC 
presence in Washington, DC. Is there an explanation for how many SNCC people came 
to be in Washington and something of what they’ve done in the city? 
Timothy Jenkins 
51 
TJ: Well, of course, the big magnet is Marion Barry, the so-called “mayor for 
life.” Marion Barry, interestingly enough, wrote me a four-page letter when he was still a 
student, in which he outlined the importance of blacks taking over the political structures 
in the localities wherever they lived. Marion also made sure that while he was mayor, 
every level of the hierarchy was integrated. He also made sure that women were given 
responsibilities that previously were never considered for women. He made sure that the 
programs that the city supported went in areas [2:10:00] that never before had been 
funded, like summer jobs programs and playground improvements and dealing with 
problems for the elderly and housing for the homeless. Marion Barry is an illustration of 
how pervasive this thing has been. 
But you can, you can really trace in other directions—. You could go to Harold 
Washington in Chicago and see his impact, yeah. You could look at some of the lawyers 
who were in San Francisco who had their experience dealing with the Panthers. You can 
look at the representation of the prisoners in Attica Prison and the Soledad Brothers and 
the Bobby Seale cases. The law has benefited tremendously because of this foundational 
kind of leavening that the direct action campaign required as a shake-up in the concept of 
what law should be and the due process should be and what representation of people who 
don’t have funds, and really a leveling field that takes the economics out of the business 
of enjoying human rights. 
EC: What are some of the ways that your participation in the movement has 
shaped you and your, you know, sort of your life and your work and your values? 
TJ: Well, if you look at my resume, you see that I’ve done a number of things. 
But I have to say that all of them have been related to the kind of experience and 
Timothy Jenkins 
52 
orientation that I had the benefit of being exposed to in SNCC, in the student campaign. I 
was co-chairman of the National Conference of Black Lawyers at one point. I was a 
member of the governing board for the postal service, and chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee, appointed by President Carter and confirmed by the Senate. 
But I was able, while there, to create a focus on the discrimination against blacks that had 
been hidden for a long time. Woodrow Wilson started it [Laughter] when he relegated 
blacks who had been successful in the postal service to menial jobs. He did that, of 
course, throughout the federal government. But in the postal service we were able to 
reverse that. And as chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, I was able to get 
Dr. Kenneth Clark, of Brown v. Board of Education fame, to come in and study the postal 
service and see all the systemic manifestations of discrimination that needed to be 
overturned, and the regulations were modified. I was even able, sitting in that position, to 
do something about the discrimination that had impacted Amzie Moore, one of our earlier 
participants in Mississippi voter registration, to get his pension restored. Eve had 
international expansions of this. I was a consultant to the High Commissioner on Human 
Rights in Geneva to look at the whole way in which the information highway is passing 
by poor and in affluent and sometime racially segregated communities. This, I think, is 
something that has continued in my, in my career. I was in education in different ways, 
as a professor at both Howard University’s law school and the David A. Clarke School of 
Law, but I was also on the board of trustees at both of those institutions, Howard and 
University of the District of Columbia, and I served as president of the University of the 
District of Columbia. All of those things have been part of the whole civil rights 
orientation, even my business activity, in dealing with export-import. The exports and 
Timothy Jenkins 
53 
imports that I was engaged in was from Africa and the Middle East that didn’t have 
access to the United States. I was sensitized to that exclusion during my era of civil 
rights. 
There are other aspects of dealing with the, justifying the rights of publishers to 
be heard and publishing houses to be funded in ways that bypass the big houses [2:15:00] 
that exclude. I helped put together the broadcast station WHUT, which is the only full 
commercial station that is owned by a historically black college and university. And they 
also have an allied commercial FM station. 
What Fm able to say is that for me the movement didn’t stop; it just changed 
forms. So whereas one time you’re on the street, and now you’re in the suites, but you’re 
carrying out the same mission. I wrote a letter in the twilight of SNCC to John Lewis, 
who was then chairman, saying that I thought SNCC people ought to make it their 
business to professionally infiltrate the machinery that was being created by the 
legislation that we drafted. I thought that SNCC people should migrate into the 
organizations like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, like the National 
Labor Relations Board, like the Federal Reserve. All these different things that are 
subsequent to the movement are still relevant to the movement, but they’re being 
administered by people who are indifferent to the movement. It was my observation that 
labor, after passing legislation, then put their people forward to be the people who 
administer it. We did not do that. And I urged—. I think that that’s one of the 
shortcomings of our movement that needs to be corrected. The notion that you’re selling 
out because you’re going into the belly of the beast, but you’re going in with a different 
Timothy Jenkins 
54 
mission than just drawing a paycheck. And that’s what needs to be highlighted as a 
career goal for people who are sensitive and concerned. 
I think it’s also one of the shortcomings of the movement that when we went 
through the era of Black Power that we lost connection with the more progressive 
elements of the white community and did not have the foresight to continue the alliances 
that are so critical for real social change. It’s my view that the reason we have now a red 
state/blue state kind of situation in such categorical terms throughout the South is because 
we did not fulfill the mission of mobilizing the poor white community to what their real 
interests are! And so you have people in the state of Kentucky voting to kill healthcare 
provisions that are aimed to alleviate the kind of conditions they’re suffering under, 
because they don’t want to be associated with Obama and Obamacare! If we had been 
able to do in the poor white community what we were able to do in the poor black 
community, we would have a different politics today. And I think the challenge that’s 
left for the next generation is to undo that era. Part of it was brought about by the 
egotism of some of those involved with Black Power that wanted to exclude whites, but 
also by the myopia of seeing that the problem is really broader than race; it deals with the 
human rights question, not the civil rights question, and it requires that the poor people 
who are affected by the same oppressive legislative provisions, the same migration of 
income from the bottom to the top, are not racially divided. And that’s the part of the 
unfulfilled mission that the next SNCC is to fulfill. 
We were not the first SNCC. There was a Southern Negro Youth Congress that 
was a progressive organization of the [19]40s. [2:20:00]That was the first SNYC. And 
that was molded around the kinds of thoughts that W.E.B. Du Bois had and some of the 
Timothy Jenkins 
55 
thoughts that Eleanor Roosevelt had about the need for youth to be involved with the 
questions of poverty. Hopefully there’ll be another SNCC after this that will fulfill what 
was the promise that we missed. 
EC: Thank you very much. It seems like a good place to end. Thanks.
