BRIDGET KEHOE. 
Written, Composed and Sung by M ASTER ROBERTS, the Dramatic 
Wonder, with great success. 
Bridget Kehoe you all know, 
That she's a 
young girl and I'm her beau; 
She can dance an Irish reel 
On a 
three cent piece or an orange peel; 
She's sweeter than pie when she winks her eye, 
If you heard her sing, you'd surely die; 
She is the sun of all my life, 
Some fine day she'll be my wife; 
Then I'll be happy all my life, 
When I 
wed Sweet Bridget Kehoe. 
Cluatus: 
She's the pride of Paddy's heart, ( Break). 
From an Irish girl I'll ne'er part; ( Break). 
Her age is seventeen, she's Ireland's green, 
The fairest girl ever seen; 
On St. Patrick's Day she's led astray, 
This Sweet Bridget Kehoe. 
Oh we'll start a 
big store in course of time, 
Sell Irish Liquors and Spanish Wines; 
And the neighbors all will come to see, 
The beautiful pair from the town of Kildare; 
On our Wedding day we'll go on aware, 
We'll dance and sing, drink Whisky strong, 
Come join us in our merry song, 
Of Sweet Bridget Kehoe.

Wonder, Comedian and Vocalist. . 
: 
0 : - 
Arndt my name is Jeremiah McMahon, 
I've two sons, Tommy and Dan; 
One is running. for Sing- Sing. 
- 
The other for Congressman: 
I 
work on the river inspecting fog, 
My wife for me does fret; 
But if my son Toni is elected, 
I'll be in Washington bottling heat. 
CHoltus: 
I'll buy my wife a 
new calico 
A 
rag baby to dance on her lap; 
I'll drink nothing but Champagne and Ink, 
When I 
catch a 
Political snap. 
I'll move into an Irish flat, 
I'll have oil paintings in the alley; 
I'll try and get some Senator 
For to marry my daughter Sally ; 
• 
ll put all my friends a 
cleaning sewers, 
Or in some office of Rank; 
When my term is up I'll bet I'll own 
Two gold mines and a 
bank,

I 
AM THE FUNNIEST TARRIER OUT. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
PAT ROONEY'S greatest success. 
Sung also by M ASTER ROBERTS with great applause as an Irish 
Song and Dance. 
Fix your eyes upon me straight, 
I 
feel so loose and airy; 
Oh! I 
can laugh, and I 
can joke, 
And never get contrary; 
I 
feel so fresh, I 
am so neat, 
I 
really shall go crazy; 
All hands roar and shout, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out. 
CHORUS: 
I'm the funniest tarrier out, 
Oh! listen while I 
spoilt; 
Stick your fingers in your ears, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out, 
They tell me I 
am funnier, 
Than a 
Greenhorn Chinese Cow; 
And in some German country, 
I 
will marry an Irish Frou; 
The history of my life is great, 
And wherever I 
may go; 
You'll hear comments upon my shape, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out. 
(Chorus).

THE COBBLER, 
ILssung by .
1011YNY ROACII, with great success. 
OCH! my oath is Dick Darlin' the cobbler, 
Mv tiir 
sery ?,d 
down there in Kent; 
Some say i'm an old fornicator, 
But now I'm resolved to repent. 
For twenty years I'd been a 
rover, 
An' wasted the prime of my life, 
One day I 
resolved to give over, 
. And settle myself down to a 
wife. 
SeokEN:—Ies, I 
got married, an' be a 
d 
to me. 
No •x, 
upon my sow!, a 
woman is the most obstroperous and outrage-
ous crature on the face of the earth! 
Before I 
was married 
whinever I'd go among eni they'd be lighting for me; an' when 
I 
married (Ale o' them, in the hopes to be ( phet and peaceable, 
 
n 
the day she'd beaisy if she wasn't ! Hain' wid me. 
Now, I'll give ye the contents UV my oath, that before I 
was 
married, there wasn't a 
nicer, quieter, dacenter, bother dispos-
ed, or meeker disposition'd boy than myself; but since I'm mar-
ried, lie gob ! 
if I 
didu t 
get into a 
bit of a 
light now an' then, 
I'd go mouldy. 
And divil a 
light iver I 
was in or heard tell of, 
but a 
woman was at the top, the bottom, both sides and in the 
middle of it. 
My wife she was blinkin' and blearin', 
My wife she was humpy and black, 
The devil all over for swearin', 
And her tongue kept going click clack. 
SPOKEN.—Bad luck to me, if iver I 
could tell how a 
woman., 
Longue is hung at all! 
We all know that a 
man's tongue is 
hung by one ind, but bad scran to nie if I 
don't think that a 
woman's tongue is hung be the middle, an' no sooner one ind 
strikes the upper oart of her jaw, but the other ind hits the 
liwer, an' there it is, upper an' lower, the whole day peltin', till 
at last I'd hey to give her a 
welt in the gob wid my last to stop 
her; an' thin she'd run out of the cellar, main' '
Watch! 
a.

watch ! watch ! here's this murderin' villian he's 
lie's give me a 
welt in the gob wid his last, an' he's broke 
la,: 
collar bone of me. 
A—new. wirrastew ! 
I 
do? " And 
thin, with ml waitin' for any one to tell her what to do, she'd 
up with a 
brick and let's drive at me. 
I 
can dodge it aisy 
enough ' cause I'm used to it; but another poor divil there standin 
by, an' not sayin' a 
word to anybody, he got it plump in the 
mug,. 
Up collies the police, and walks the three av us off for 
assault and batthery, an' d  
n 
the one got batthered out 
the poor divil who had nothin' to do wid it. 
But thats the way 
of it—evil communications corrupt good manners. 
But now we are parted foriver— 
One month' . 
before it was light, 
shoy'd the old jade in a 
river, 
And cautiously bid her good night j 
.M.y 
troubles of wedlock hem' over, 
Tins country I 
thought I 
would try; 
Once more I've become a 
free rover, 
And single I'll stop till I 
die. 
SPOKEN.—A 
fellow come into me shop the otherday. " Dick,'. 
says he. " Sir," says I. " 
bet you three dollars to one," 
says he, " that I 
can sole three pairs of boots while you sole 
one." "You can't," says I. " Will you bet ?" says he. " I 
will," 
says I. " Done!" says he. " Done !" says 1; and to work we 
whit. 
An' afther I'd bate him, as an Irishman ought to do, the 
dirty bla'kguard wouldn't pay me. 
But maybe I 
hadn't satis-
faction out of him? I 
wint out an' I 
bate him. 
I 
bate him till 
I 
was as blind as a 
bat. 
I 
bate him till I 
broke nearly all the 
bones in my body, all' they had to carry me home on a 
shut-
ther. 
Ile come to me aftherwards, an' says he, ' You ought to 
pay me somethin'. 
Didn't I 
give you a practical lesson in 
industhry? 
You didn't know ho-,
v 
much work you could do, 
till I 
brought it out av you," says he. 
Be gob! but I 
know 
how much work he hindered me from doin'. 
But hould on a 
bit; let me come across him again-- if iver I 
come across him 
again by .1 -- s ! I'li keep clear tiv Jinn.

From nature's lovely spring, 
While flowing from a

An example for the world to see.

THE WILD IRISH BOY. 
E 
MDR 
by MILES MORRIS, at Fox's American Theatre, Philad'a, Pa. 
FAREWELL to the dear land I 
have left far behind, 
Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
,Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
"For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the boys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they will come here, 
To a 
land filed with plenty and a 
land I 
love dear, 
I 
know they will bless me and it will give me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
There's the land of my kindred, I 
ne'er can forget, 
They may be a 
time coming when it may be happy yet, 
I 
wish to God it were now, for ' twould give me great joy, 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
Yes, to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy.

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with- great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth ; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the clearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and tit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen : 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat s 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. 
Chorus. 
SKIDMORE'S FANCY BALL! 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875 by A. J. 
'FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
1.:y the Original JAMES BRADLEY, at the Thea'ae Comitrie, 
514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Keep your eyeballs moving, 
And watch the time of day, 
The Skidmore Guards have joined together, 
To give a 
ball on West Broadway ! 
But I 
understand they'll have a 
band, 
A 
clarionet and base drum, 
The loons will smile and walk a 
mile, 
To have a 
good night's fun! 
CHORUS. 
The band will play 
In the key of A, 
As the Wenches promenade the Hall, 
Plain Quadrilles— 
That would give a 
man the chills— 
At the Skidmore's Fancy Ball ! 
Captain Brown he will be there, 
With a 
boiled shirt, stiffened with starch I 
He'll put on airs and kick around chairs, 
When he does lead the march 
With Angelina Neversmile by his side; 
Who's eyes would stop a 
clock ! 
When Intermission comes, 
He falls in with the bums, 
And takes a 
walk around the block. 
The band will play, .tei

Written for TONY PASTOR, by Wm. IL DELnnIxTr. 
I'M with you once again kind friend; 
And pleased to see you smile, 
I've been out where the sun descends, 
But for a 
little while. 
And now as I 
have just returned 
And hope to long remain, 
Of things that I 
have seen and learned, 
I'm glad to sing again. 
SFOKEN.—Yes, fin a

THE ASHANTE RECRUITS, 
TIERNEY & CRONIN'S Original Specialty. 
[Copyrighted, 1875, by A. J. FISHER.] 
behold, before you, two warriors bold, two warriors who 
rank high— 
Two privates, yes, two privates ii the N. G. S. N. Y. 
And our foes they tremble when they read our motto, which 
is Never Say Die. 
For we are two gallant privates, in the N. G. S. N. Y. 
CHORUS. 
We are privates, bold, of the N. G. S. N. Y. 
Two warriors bold to the wars we never fly 
With our gay and martial air we attract all the fair, 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
[Repeal. 
At balls and parties they do admire us, gay old privates 
two 
The ladies smile as we pass by, and ask us how do we do ; 
As through the Avenue we do drive, the people they all 
do cry 
At us, two gallant privates of the N. G. S. N. Y. 
We are two privates, &c. 
Now we'll bid you all adieu its time we were away, 
The bugle sounds, the Captain calls, of course we must 
obey; 
We are only privates now, you know, and say that with a 
sigh; 
But we hope we'll soon be Sargeauts in the N. G. S. N. Y. 
We are privates, &c.

UNDER THE ROSE BUSH, 
Sung Vith great success by MISS CARRIE DUNCAN; 
Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WHEN eighteen years old, and just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A 
gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloona 
tic) kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose- bush, 
He asked me to kiss him, I 
did not say way. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May-bedecked hedge, 
I 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
lie asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
never denied it, but then and there tried it. 
Beneath that bright- rose bush full burdened with bloom 
So like the May flowers, which served a,; a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose- bush, kc. 
At, sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet My romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath t 
that bright rose- bush, full burdened with bloei.t., 
So when to the altar I 
went NVith011t falter 
I 
had my dear Ned fyr a 
happy bridegroom.

The Dear Old Flag of Green. 
Written for PADDY and ELLA M URPHY by BARNEY FAGAN. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green— 
That emblem of purity—in solitude serene. 
With rapture and delight the Irish bosoms heave ; 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave 
No taint of dishonor at that banner c-zer hurled, 
Since first its proud foulds to the breeze were unfurled. 
May the bright suns of heaven cast their beams on thaf 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot. 
ClIORL'S. 
Then let your shouts re echo, far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free ; 
Quickly swell your ranks, and let your war cry be : 
Death to the tyrants ; on, on to victory ! 
W'ith pride we can look on the noble deeds and fame 
Of Irelands trusty warriors—immortal be their names. 
Foremost in the strife amid the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle- cry our patriots help to swell 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand. 
With courage true as steel and eager for the fray, 
Right manfully they strive to help gain the day. 
Then let your shouts, & c. 
All honor to the heroes now lying ' neath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay. 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they love so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clanging of the steel, 
Will be heard the cry of victory, as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
Old Ireland's sons will wake to find their bondage chains 
no more. 
Then let your shouts, &c.

All persons 
are cautioned, under penalty of the law, not to pirate and publish 
this song. 
You have heard of Muldoon and Mulcahy also, 
But I 
am a 
great man from the County Sligo, 
I 
am a 
great politician, I 
have money to lend, 
I 
am a 
famous constituent, 
And the workingman's friend. 
CHORUS. 
I

famous speculator, 
With money and brains, reputation and fame, 
An Irish Congressman from Killarney, 
You'll hear of me again, 
am a 
high-toned agitator. 
Bernard McColskey, it is my name, 
The friend of the working man. 
Oh, I

I'm happy to meet you all, true Irishmen, and triends. 
And companions of the workingman's friend.

Never Lose Your Head. 
Last Monday night I 
went to dine with my 
Brown ; 
While running thro' the' sloppy streets I 
du 
down ; 
I 
heard a 
click upon the paves, it was too dark 
Put when I 
got to Brown's I 
found that I'd 
key. 
friend, Mister 
msily tumbled 
to see, 
lost my latch 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it really was the fact, I'd lost my latch-key. 
I 
determined to tell Brown about it but forgot. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
first did lose my latch- key, 
And through this I 
lost my bed, 
But through all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
At dinner I 
sat next a 
charming lady dressed in blue ; 
She really was so beautiful, and so amusing, too, 
That when the hostess gave the sign for the ladies to depart 
I 
found to my a.szonishment that I 
had lost my heart. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there was no doubt about it, I 
had lost my 
heart! 
I 
couldn't talk to Brown, I thoroughly disliked 
Brown ; and when he ordered up another bottle of claret I 
felt as though I 
could have strangled him. 
And so I 
lost my heart, 
Besides my latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
When we had drank up all the wine we to the drawing- room 
went. 
Arc' while my charmer sang a 
song, I 
o'er the music bent ; 
leanin: down quite close, to hear the words which she 
did say, 
The candle caught my whiskers, and burnt them quite away. 
SPOKEN— Yes, it caught my left-hand whisker, so I 
had to 
have tho otlier off to keep my balance. 
go i 
lost my whiskers and my heart, 
My latch- key, and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
bade good- night at 12 o'clock, and when out in the street 
I 
felt myself borne up aloft, in fact right off my feet ; 
The last thing that I 
heard was some one utter a 
loud curse, 
And when I'd got my senses back I 
found I'd lost my purse. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I 
was robbed—robbed just outside Brown's, 
too. 
Ile had gone to bed, as there were no lights in the 
windows, and no police, as usual, were to be seen. 
So I 
lost my purse, my whiskers, heart, 
My latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
wander'd ' bout the streets all night, because I 
had no tin, 
I 
tried in vain to get a 
bed—folks wouldn't let me in ; 
I 
heard the clocks strike i 
and 2 and 3 
and 4

And got back to my lodgings feeling more dead than alive. 
SPOKEN—Yes, caught an awful cold, too, which, now that 
it has left me, has taken all my voice away. 
So I 
lost my voice, my purse, my whisker:, 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs,

never lost my head. 
My song is done, and I 
have only just one word to say, 
Of good advice to give my friends before you go away— 
Into whate'er predicaments your person may be led, 
Lose everything you may possess, but never lose your head. 
'
4SPOKEN—Yes, it is a 
matter of great consolation to me to 
think that 
Altho' I 
lost my voice, purse, whiskers, 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
Vet thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head.

The Poor Serio-Comic, 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with great 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," " You've children of your own," 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic. -
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who told her she was charming and neat, 
21 
THE POOR SERIO-COMIC.—Continued. 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more. 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if you can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with bAicks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
NON, these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except cirses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enougt.2 and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
rflan't 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back.

Why do I 
smile ? well, I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
dandy copper on the Broadway Squad, 
And a 
brave one at that am I. 
If there's a 
murder or fight about, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Ah ! isn't he a 
dear. 
CHORUS—

About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. 
I

Which from the public I 
receive, 
And tell her how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'd have to lave. 
I'm a

They could stand a

And sing the Swate By-and- By.

Price 40 cents. 
Published by permission. 
Dedicated to HARRY MINER, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! (Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not 1" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c.

Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Title and music composed by PADDY Muxeuv. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisitax, 1879. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once 'pore the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, & c,

the great JOHN REILLY. 
Arrah, give me your attention every one, 
And hear what I've to say ; 
It's all about a 
daughter of mine 
That's bound to have her way. 
She goes to the theatre every night, 
For the stage sure she's got spooney, 
And now she's got a 
date, and is making out first-rate, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she walks, shure she catclies the gawks, 
By my sowl I 
think she's looney ; 
On me she's brought disgrace since she went off her base, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. ( Dance.) 
Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates, 
And I 
ask her for God's sake to give it up, 
She says go away your feet ain't mates. 
Sure the actors all give her the laugh, 
And say that her act is Juney ; 
The gillies she does mash, she gets seven dollars cash, 
For imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
Shure she washed up in Pat Rooney's Sponge, 
And stole his dialect ; 
She tried to do his funny run off, 
And nearly broke her neck.

It was down to Casey,s at the old Sixth Ward, 
Now it was an elegant sight.

And whiskey there galore, 
And the boys would smile, and the girls put on style, 
As they danced and welted the floor.

At Casey's ball last night. 
Oh, we kept the ball a 
rolling, boys, 
Till the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey, swallow'd glass and all, 
With the laughing I 
nearly died. 
Then we all flew for the kitchen, 
Put the turkey out of sight, 
Little Widow Dunn, by the crowd was sung, 
And they kept it up all night.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom. 
how does the lesson fall ? 
The mil upon a 
slope cloth stand, 
It bears an antique shape ; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
• 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain ; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal. 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teacn your conscience thus to feel. 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind agnia 
With watet that has past,

A 
Cool Customer. 
A 
man entered a 
well-known restaurant the other day and 
called for a 
dinner. 
His orders were of the most elaborate 
character, and fairly staggered the resources of even so noted 
a 
restaurant keeper. 
He lingered long at the table, and 
finallyswound •up with a 
bottle of wine. 
Then lighting a 
cigar he ordered, he leisurely sauntered up to the counter, 
and said to the proprietor: 
"Very fine dinner, landlord? 
Just charge it to me. 
haven't got a 
cent." 
" 
But I 
don't know you," said the proprietor, indignantly. 
" 
Of course you don't. 
If you had, you wouldn't have let 
me had the dinner." 
" 
Pay me for the dinner, I 
say." 
"And I 
say I 
can't. 
Haven't got the blunt." 
" 
I'll see about that," said the proprietor, somewhat furious 
at the bill. 
Then he snatched a 
revolver from the drawer 
and leaped over the counter, collared the man, exclaiming, as 
he pointed it at his head: 
" 
Now see if you'll get away with that dinner without pay-
ing for it, you scoundrel." 
" 
What is that you hold in your hand?" said the getter-
away-with- free-dinners, drawing back. 
" 
That is a 
revolver, sir." 
"Oh, that's a 
revolver, is it. 
I 
don't care a 
pin for a 
re 
volver. I 
thought it was a 
stomach-pump."

I'm a 
dacent Irish woman, Ann O'Hoolahan is my name, 
And I've a 
daughter, a 
big street-walker, and Mary is her 
name; 
She wears a 
big waterfall, she calls it a 
catcher in her slang, 
She been out all night with that blackguard Terry that lately 
joined the gang. 
CHORUS. 
She comes creeping up stairs at 3 
P. X., 
With her hat and shoes in her hand, 
She's been out all night to a 
Pic-nic Park 
With Terry that joined the gang. 
When she came home last Tuesday night, oh, this is what I 
said: 
" 
Mary Ann, my dear, you're doing very wrong," when she 
says, " Go soak your head." 
The old man hit her with a 
great big stick, knocked her hat 
into the frying-pan; 
She's been out all night with that blackguard Terry, the fellow 
that joined the gang. 
She comes creeping, & c. 
She got up last Monday morning and put on all her good 
clothes ; 
I 
says, " Mary Ann, where are you going?" when at me she 
stuck up her nose. 
She stands upon the corner, you should see her, yes, you 
should, 
I'll bet she's up with Terry and the gang, a 
spieling at Jones' 
Wood, 
She comes creeping, & c.

To the back line of the ballet, 
On all the gang I

I've got.a

That's struck upon the stage, 
And I 
fear that's been ordained by fate. 
She went out the other night

And wants to double up with Amelia Dean, 
She does a

Waiting for Dr. Landis to come East,

ASSIST THOSE IN NEED. 
As sung with immense success by Miss Lottie Winnett, and

And all should assist with their mights, 
To say a

Is one of my greatest delights. 
If a 
man who is poor approaches my door, 
I 
don't turn on him with a

But I 
give him my might, for surely ' tis right, 
If we're up to assist those who're down. 
And thus I 
go on, 
With the world's busy throng. 
I 
avoid all contention and strife, 
But I 
do all I 
can 
To aid each poor man, 
Mounting upward the ladder of life, 
Every day in this town of wealth and re- flown, 
We can see hundreds hungry for bread, 
And perhaps if 'twere known there are others at 
home, 
Depending on them to be fed, 
Oh that Mammon \vould turn from his pleasure 
to learn, 
Of their suffering and aid their distress, 
How many would pray for his weal night and day, 
And the giver would always be blessed.

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE, 
Words and Music by WILL H. Fox. 
Sung by Wm. 111cALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, anti 
by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
(Chorus). 
Our Stage-Struck Daughter. 
Written by Jotm SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN and JONES with great 
success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat McMonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water; 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson wItit her lays low; 
Then thousand dollars is the salary she does ask, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
CHORUS. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
'Whit play-acting she is crazy ; 
Tier mother wanted her to be a 
servant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the Ballet or Can-Can; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man. 
As a 
slack-wire dancer she is great, 
She plays the villian's part ; 
In the character of Juliet 
She broke poor Romeo's heart. 
Written by BARRY CARTER for Miss EMMA ROGERS, and sung by her 
with great success. 
There's a 
bonny green isle way over the sea, 
Where the boys and the girls are light-hearted and free. 
It's the land of the beautiful shamrock so green, 
And the prettiest country that ever was seen. 
But the shamrock by law is forbidden to grow 
black- hearted tyrants; but soon with the foe 
An ar:-Ay of patriots determined you'll see. 
Who will fight Johnny Bull till old Ireland is free. 
Oh, thc boys won't forget '93, I 
am sure, 
When the widow and orphan was drove from the (Icor 
When Emmet, the patriot, was strung on a 
tree 
On that bonnie green isle way over the sea. 
Soon shall the day come when each valley and glen 
Shall re-echo the war-cry of bold Irish men. 
From oppressors and tyrants may they ever be free 
On that bonnie green isle way over the sea. 
Bound for Germany.

Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm a 
fellow who's fond of pleasure, 
No matter where I 
roam; 
At my hours of pleasure, 
I 
make myself at home; 
Oh, give to me the outside sport, 
On the fields I 
love to tarry; 
The boys around the parks, call me 
Pretty Boston Harry.

Oh ta-ta ta, oh, ta-ta ta, 
Wherever I

Wherever I 
may look; 
I 
always wear the best costume, 
Of any of the boys of the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Josey that's her name; 
In the summer-time, 
On the lawn we play the croquet game; 
Oh, do I 
not admire it; 
My chance I 
would not miss, 
Before my darling parts with me; 
On her lips I 
imprint a 
kiss. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, &c. 
One evening while out strolling, 
Just for a

My pet and I

Around in Central Park; 
While gazing at the fountain, 
We met a

Who asked us to take a 
walk with him, 
To visit a 
babboon. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, &c., &c.

Things Have Changed Since Hannah Died, 
Written and sung by Billy Carter. 
Hannah was a 
lovely creature, 
Long of foot and short of neck, 
Her voice was her most prominent feature, 
B,tfore she handed in her checks. 
She hock'd my clothes to elope with a 
fellow, 
I 
contemplated suicide,' 
But I 
changed my mind nd moved in a 
cellar, 
For things have changed since Hannah died. 
Doctor Tanner is a 
fast liver, 
But his liver lasted longer than him, 
If the Brooklyn bridge is finished ever, 
You can save two cents, and needn't swim. 
H. W. B. says he can't help loving her, 
But Theodore is Elysabeth's pride, 
Beecher won't pull down the blinds in Heaven, 
Fo.1 he'll find 
That things have changed since Hannah died. 
• 
Sammy Tilden was elected, 
But Rutheford he did grab the ground, 
Boss Tweed left us unexpected, 
And S—ts 
stiff it can't be found. 
Some says Hancock will be elected, 
Others that Garfield will get inside 
The White House walls, if lie expects it 
Re'll find 
That things have changed since Hannah died.

A 
Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave 
Words and music by H ARRY K ENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by Wm. H . 
KENNEDY, 528 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home agaili, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, & c.

Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me ; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me ; 
And she knew me! 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! 
She surprised me ! (Sym.) 
She paralyzed me ! ( Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gilly all the while. 
CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me— 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly ; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work. 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
handcart ! (Sym.) 
With her head stuck in an ash barrel— 
Picking cinders! 
She's a 
daisy ! 
She's terrible lazy! 
And she played me for

Grandmother Pratt's Wonderful Cat. 
Written by Billy Carter, and sang by him with great success. 
Old Grandmother Pi att owned a 
fine Thomas cat, 
A 
beautiful sky-blue Maltese, 
And this wonderful cat often went on a 
bat, 
A 
tearing, high old jamboree. 
I'm going to show that this cat wasn't slow— 
He was ringboned in one of his eyes— 
One day he did go down to Stetson's cat show, 
And he drew out a 
golden first prize. 
This wonderful cat he was hairy and fat, 
One ear was chewed off in a 
row, 
And his nose was as fiat as the crown of my hat, 
It hapyened I 
can't tell you how. 
He was heavy and strong, but his tail wasn't long, 
It was ate off all but a 
short stump, 
And I 
hope it ain't wrong for to tell in my song, 
On his back was a 
three-cornered hump. 
He could sing like a 
lark, every night after dark 
lie would get onto my back-yard fence. 
My watch-dog would bark like a 
man eating shark, 
When this cat his sweet song would commence. 
In a 
moment the ground would be covered all round 
With cats from the neighboring streets, 
Not a 
cat could be found that dared utter a 
sound, 
But they'd quietly sit in their seats. 
About midnight one night he got into a 
fight— 
He was fond of disturbing the peace— 
Through the dimness of sight of the eye on his right 
lie fell into a 
pan of soap-grease. 
He squeled like the deuce, but it wasn't no use, 
lie couldn't get out of the pan, 
The grease held him fast, he died game to the last, 
As only a 
Thomas cat can. 
Glass Put In.

Here I 
am, a 
Hebrew man, 
And glass I'll put in cheap; 
For fifteen cents a 
single pane, 
You bet I'll do it neat. 
I'll put them in most any size, 
And my price is very small; 
So, if you want some glass put in, 
I'll go and give you a 
call.

0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in? 
Say, missus, you want some glass put in? 
I'll do the job so nice and clean, 
You'll find that I'm no cheat; 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in ? 
Say, mister, you want some glass put in ? 
That's what I 
holler the whole day long, 
As I 
go through the street. 
The gang they throw big stones at me 
Whenever I 
go out, 
And from the windows in the street 
You can hear the people shout: 
Say, mister, here, and mister, there, 
I 
want to give you a 
job; 
Because I 
put them in so fine, 
And they know that I'm no slob.

We went up-town to buy us some flutes, 
And we went over on the Bowery 
And all the boys said we were galutes. ( Break.)

For with you we cannot stay; 
We must go back to the gas house 
Where we get our dollar a 
day.

Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a

Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly

But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him

Little Patsy Kelly, 
A dandy very small; 
Sells evening papers, 
On the Bowery for a

Nct many days ago; 
Introduced Inc ye's can bet, 
As Patsy Kelly's Beau.

Its naughty, but nicey, I'm still a

He lives in Mulligan's building, 
Just up nine flights of stairs; 
He keeps his Father and Mother, 
And Silks and Satins wears. 
He takes care of his Brother, 
His Sister to Jail did go; 
Oh swell the story all around, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Down around the bloody Fourth,

THE IRISH POTATO. 
Parody on the .` Old Oaken Bucket." 
110W sweet to the taste is the Irish potato, 
As memory awakens the thought of the plant! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and beautiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt; 
I 
thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On the broad sunny hill- slope adjoining the mill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing 
For some were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
CHOR us. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skimmed potato that grew on the hill. 
That delectable plant I'll prize while I'm able, 
For often at noon when returned from the field, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edilge that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
plied knife and fork with a 
hearty good will ! 
Alas! there are none of the old-fashioned flavor, 
None like the real " sin:ions" that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, &c. 
How prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As, poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth! 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it, 
Though atiected by rot on a 
long summer's drouth; 
And now far removed from that situation, 
Where I 
used to partake of the root to my 
fill. 
Fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
And sigh for the " kidney" that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, &e. 
Original Song by GORMAN and ROMER, the German Emigrants. 
Just fitty years ago to-day 
Since you became my wife, 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
So bright has been our life. 
Hard working we have always been, 
Und now, in our old age, 
We're going home to Faderland, 
Dot's where we'll end our days. 
CHORUS. 
This is our Golden Wedding day, 
A 
bright time for our life, 
Und it is just fifty years ago 
Since you became my wife. 
Und we have kept side by side 
It don't seem fifty years ago 
Since you became my wife. 
A 
family, too, of boys and girls, 
So good and true we've raised— 
Und now were going to Faderland, 
Dot's where we'll end our days. 
This is our Golden, & c. 
Sung, with great success, by Bob Slavin. 
There are a 
great many sayings I've heard in my time. 
And half I 
believe to be lies, 
While the rich man is feasting on peanuts each day, 
The poor man is starving on pies. 
It's a 
shame in the land the Italians call free, 
We can't get money our eyebrows to dye, 
The poor working girl wears her gall out for a 
million a 
week, 
And takes weekly baths in six cent rock and rye. 
CHORUS— 
Then remember my sayings, when you are insane, 
Counting the dimes by the penny, 
Remember you have a 
moustache of your own, 
While the poor working girl hasn't any. 
My name is Hart the walker, 
I 
used to wear two-cent paper collars, 
But since I 
made 565 miles, 
I 
am worth fourteen thousand dollars. 
I 
don't mix up with colored trash, 
I 
make a 
living by my legs, 
I 
eat Charlotte Russe and stewed ice cream, 
Custard pie and scrambled eggs. 
The Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Sung with thunders of applause by HARRY RICHMOND. 
In the merry month of June, 
From my home I 
started, 
Left the girls of Tuam, 
Nearly broken-hearted ; 
Saluted father dear, 
Kiss'd my darling mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother; 
Then off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I 
was horn, 
I 
cut a 
stout black thorn, 
To banish a 
ghost or goblin. 
In a 
bran new pair of brogues, 
I 
rattled over the bogs, 
And frightened all the dogs, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, 
Whack-fal-lal-le, Whack-fal-lal-le-rido. 
In Mullinger that night, 
I 
rested limbs so weary, 
Started by daylight, 
Next morning light and airy ; 
Took a 
drop o' the pure, 
To keep my spirits from sinking, 
That's an Irishman's cure, 
Whenever he's on for drinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while, 
At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a 
bubblin'. 
They ax'd me if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Till I 
was almost tired, 
Of the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
In Dublin next arrived, 
I 
thought it such a 
pity, 
To be so soon deprived, 
A view of that fine city; 
Then I 
took a 
stroll, 
All among the quality, 
'ho.) 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN—Continued. 
My bundle it was stole, 
In a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Then I 
looked behind, 
No bundle could I 
find, 
Upon my stick a 
wobblin'. 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue 
Wasn't much in vogue 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
From there I 
got away, 
My spirits 11 ever failin', 
Landed on the quay, 
As the ship was sailin'. 
Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he, 
When I 
jumped aboard, 
A cabin found for Paddy. 
Down among the pigs, 
I 
played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
The water round me bubblin'. 
When off Holyhead, 
I 
wished myself was dead, 
Or better far instead, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
The boys of Liverpool, 
When we safely landed, 
Called myself a 
fool, 
I 
could no longer stand it. 
Blood began to boil, 
Temper I 
was losin', 
Poor ould Erin's Isle, 
They begn abusin'. 
furra my soul, says I, 
Mv shillaleh I 
let fly, 
Some Galway boys were by, 
Saw I 
was a 
hobble in, 
Then with a 
loud hurrah, 
They joined in the affray, 
(Spoken) 
Faugh-a-ballagh, 
We quickly cleared the way,

JULIA. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FI SHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'LL sing in praise of Julia, a 
proper piece of stuff, 
A 
girl who knows her way about all over, 
She's been there once before, so of course she's up to snuff, 
And I'm the chap who'd like to be her lover ; 
Although she seems to favor me. somehow I 
cannot make 
An impression on her, though I 
often sound her, 
I 
really do believe, in fact a 
fever I 
will take, 
That there's not a 
living soul who can get round her. 
CII0RUS. 
You might get round a 
corner, might get round a 
post, 
You might get round a 
square, and that's peculiar, 
You might get round the town, round the country, round the 
coast. 
But ' twill take you all your time to get round Julia. 
My Julia she is not a 
Westender, you must know, 
For Whitechapel is the place where she is housed up ; 
Although she's very plebian, in fact I 
might say low ; 
Her spirits they are high when they are roused up, 
Just touch her on her tender points, and you will quickly find 
She's not a 
girl on whom you'd ever practice, 
Although to hurt your feelings, she'd not be so unkind; 
But she'd give you a 
straight, because the fact is— 
You might get round a 
corner, etc. 
I 
often try to court her, but find it is no go, 
Although I 
have more influence than any, 
For, when I 
try it on, she quickly lets me know 
With her hands that she for me is one too many, 
Ah, but yet I 
live in hopes that I 
shall marry her some day, 
Although the date's beyond my calculation, 
I 
now know she really loves me, but she never tells me so, 
And so I 
tell you for your information. 
You Blight get round a 
corner, etc.

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HIIMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contaiii nothing. but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
