TRUDELL 
 
 
I know, I know, I been there 
I feel it, I felt it, I been there 
I’m scared; I’m scared of what I saw 
Scared of what I felt, scared of my thoughts 
Scared of knowledge, scared of wisdom 
Scared of my ignorance, scared of my arrogance 
 
I’m scared of my life 
But I’m strong, strong for my son, strong for my daughter 
I’m strong for my mom, she seen it all 
I’m strong for my dad, worked himself to death 
I’m strong for my loves, all these beautiful women 
Who knew me better than I knew my self. 
I’m strong for my people, who have been captured, killed, 
Put away, tortured, brainwashed, left out to dry. 
Strong for my people who think I’m crazy 
Strong for my people who can’t see the light no more 
Strong for my people who fight every day 
Strong for my people who will die far away from home 
Strong for the sell-outs, the doubters, the vanished 
The banished, the incarcerated, the cancerated, the polluted, 
The chronic, the addicted, the consumerated, the consumed. 
I’m strong for the traditional, the rational, the practical, the political. 
I’m strong for my people who have given up 
I’m strong for my people who have been beaten down 
I’m strong for my people who have turned their lives around 
I’m strong for my people who only care about things 
And turned their lives into GNPs CODs ATMs MIAs MFAs 
Degrees of disconnection, financial portfolios instead of dreams, 
Visions of power replaced by coercion, corruption and greed. 
As long as the money flows and the casino tables are green 
As long as they think history can never be repeated 
As long as they never read the signs or open their eyes 
Or listen to elders who hear the earth cry 
As long as they allow their own children to become 
Indoctrinated by a system that is built on lies. 
 
I want to be strong, strong again 
I want to be strong, strong again 
 
But I’m scared, scared for my life 
 
But I’m strong, strong again 
 
Thank you 
 
Thank you, John…
