TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEW IN MID-SENTENCE:  And we can get going.  So the tape 
is rolling and it's recording.  And this is February the 15th, yeah, [R:  yup] and we're here with 
Roger Brunelle in Centraville.
R:  Okay, Centraville, yeah.
D:  Now do you want to walk around Mr. Brunelle, or do you want to ride?  How do you want to 
do this?
R:  Sure.  Uh, why don't, why don't we walk just a little bit and get uh (--)
D:  I'm going to bring my camera around with us.
R:  I'm not sure if uh (--)  I just want uh, hook over here all right?
D:  Okay.  
R:  And go across, just go across the street over here.  I, I want to check to see if this store is 
opened and go in and say hello to that guy.  [D:  Yeah]  Cote.  Yeah, that uh, the shoe store.  
D:  You said his grandfather was a cobbler?
R:  His father was a cobbler.  And his father lived with the Indians and everything.  [Sounds of 
cars passing by in background]  He was, he was quite an individual.  He died just uh, a few years
ago.  He was in his nineties.  And uh, everybody knew Mr. Cote.  He'd come over and work even
after he'd been retired, you know, put in some time.  But uh, oh yeah, he's opened!  [Loud noises 
in background]  Oh yeah.  
D:  So this is on Bridge Street?
R:  Uh, this over here is uh, not Bridge Street.  This over here is Aiken.  
D:  This is Aiken.  [R:  Aiken]  Okay.
R:  You know?  You see, uh, he's closed.  [D:  Oh]  February 13th to 28th.  [D:  Huh]  No.  [D:  
He must be on (--)]  But he (--)  See, you can take a look, you'll see.  He's got uh, all this stuff in 
there.  [D:  Oh yeah]  And uh, he used to sell, but now all he does is repair.  [D:  Uh huh]  People 
come in here and they'll pay as much as twenty dollars to have their shoes repaired.  [D:  Wow!]  
Yeah, because they're comfortable.  You know.
D:  Well true.  If you get a good pair of shoes (--)
R:  Yeah, you don't want to part with it.
D:  Yeah really.  
R:  A pair of slippers, you know?  Yup.  See that Cameo Diner?  [D:  Yeah]  That used to be uh, 
Brunet, Brunet's Diner.  [D:  Bru?]  Uh, Brunet, [spells] B R U N E T.  [D:  Uh huh]  And that 
was owned by that waitress's father.  [Loud car passing by]  
D:  [Makes comment-too much noise-cannot transcribe]  How about Lowell Provision 
Company?
R:  That's owned by uh, a Doyle, but he's french.  His, his father was uh, um, Irish, english 
speaking, but the, the mother is uh, is french.  The mother was french.  And they have some uh, 
some frenchmen in, working in there.  People who speak french, you know.  They sell me things.
They used to be, uh, Lowell Provision used to be on uh, in Little Canada on the other side.  But 
they moved over here when they, they tore down Little Canada, you know?  [D:  Oh]  Kenwood 
Florist, that's owned by uh, uh, Georgette.  She's, she speaks french.  
D:  So would you consider this right here sort of the heart of Centraville?  
R:  Yup.  That's it.  The church is right up there.  And uh, we'll, we'll go over and see that.  Uh, 
why don't we go in the car and I'll, I'll start uh, showing you around.  [D:  Okay, great]  Those, 
those places that Jack mentions, you know, [D:  yeah] in his books.  
D:  We visited Lionel Turcotte um, at his home.  And he was pointing out, I guess that house 
across the street from him is one of the houses that Kerouac's lived in?  
R:  Yup.  That the house that they lived in when Gerard died.  When the older brother died.  [D:  
Uh huh]  [Pause]  See there were some blocks around here.  Those were Boule's blocks.  And 
yeah, they'll always be here I suppose.  And uh, all (--)  Yes!
D:  The blocks in, like in Little Canada and, and over here, were they built by people in the, in 
the french community?
R:  Some were.  Uh, like tit Jacques Boisvert.  Jacques Boisvert was a builder.  And he built 
some of them, but most of what he built I think were, were uh, little cottages, you know?  There's
the Centraville Social Club.  I know you want to go inside the clubs.  Uh, that's a, a french, 
french uh, social club.  [D:  Uh huh]  This over here is uh, Lakeview Avenue going towards 
Dracut.  As a matter of fact you can see Dracut from here where those trees are.  Way beyond 
there, right in the middle.  This is where I live.  I live in this neighborhood.  You know, just off 
on that side.  Uh, Campaw Street.  [Pause]  Now that one over there in the, in the middle, the 
green one is where Jack was born.  March the 12th, 1922.  And uh, they lived in that building for 
about seven years.  Three years on the first floor at number 7, and four years on the, on the 
second floor at number 9.  So it was 9 Lupine Road.  [D:  Could not hear comment]  Yup.  1923 
they moved away.  Uh, they moved a lot.  But it's (--)  See, over here it's already changed.  You 
got duplexes from down the corner.  
D:  Yeah, so the, like this ranch house right across the way, that would have been since (--)
R:  No, that wasn't there.  That was a field.  I know because we used to go over and play there.  I 
lived, when I was a little boy I lived in the one behind that uh, on Lakeview Avenue.  It's a 
duplex.  Anyway we'll, we'll go up here.  And uh, in 1924 they moved up here on uh, Burnaby.  
35 Burnaby Street.  And this time it was a little cottage.  You know, uh, and Jack mentions this 
uh, this cottage in [pause], he mentions it twice in Mexico City Blues.  Uh, chorus #95.  And also
in Visions of uh Gerard.  Now you see, they're all cottages here.  [D:  yeah]
D:  This was getting out just a little bit further, [R:  yup, it was uh]  and getting into a single 
family house.  
R:  That's right.  It's this one right here.  [D:  Oh, #35?]  Yup, #35.  [D:  Cannot hear comment]  
And he uh, he recalls the little kids that he played with in those years.  And what they were, what
their names were.  Of course he never, he always changed the names, you know?  [Chuckles]
D:  Now how, how much in, in The Town and City, how much of the story of the father and 
Allah, how close was that to, to his own father?  His father was (--)
R:  Very, very close.  Very close.  He says so himself in, in an interview in french on french 
television.  Jack calls his father his protector.  [Pronounces it in french]  Protector!  You sort of 
uh (--)  Those who, who knew him and remembered him, he was stocky [unclear], he was 
chunky.  You know, tough.  [D:  Hm]  And Jack wasn't tough.  [Chuckles]  Jack was sensitive.  
Well he, he could be I suppose.  He was big.  He was an athlete. 
     See we, we're in Dracut now, but we're going to go right back in Lowell.  [D: Uh huh]  Look 
at that!  You see, it's all little, little cottages.  This wasn't, well that one was there.  You can tell 
which ones were here and which ones weren't.  That one was here.  Not that one.  Not that one.  
[D:  Uh huh]  That one, yes.  [D:  So]  That line, yeah.  
D:  All of the ones with their [word unclear] street are the older kinds.  Would these, condos like 
these, would they be built by one builder?  
R:  Yup.  Yeah, just like uh (--)  Oh yeah, the series.  [Clears throat]  Attorney Sheehan lives over 
here.  His mother is french.  he speaks french.  You know, his mother lives over there.  She's in 
her nineties.  She was a close friend to one of my aunts.  Aunts and uncles, you know, great 
aunts, great uncles.  Now we're in, again we're in Dracut.  
D:  Do people make a real distinction between Dracut and Centraville?
R:  Uh yes.  But uh, Centraville became part of Lowell only in 1850, 51.  Uh, so that we, we 
have an affinity to, to Dracut as being close, but we know we live in Lowell.  Do you see, there's 
a "D", right there.  See.  [D:  Huh]  That house is half in Dracut and half in Lowell.  [Clears 
throat]  Now we're on Hildreth Street, which is a Dracut name.  A Dracut family.  When Jack 
started going to school he went to a uh, a school that was, the building was public.  [Sound of 
cars passing by]  It was called the Billing Street School that was rented to the church, to the 
parish for one dollar and the nuns used it for all of the kids that lived in this neighborhood who 
were in the kindergarten, first, second and third grade, because there wasn't any room in the big 
school.  And he lived right on the corner on this green, this green house here.  Corner of Hildreth 
and uh, Aiken.  
D:  Uh, this house right (--)
R:  Yup, 320.  320.  As a matter of fact he mentions having a dream when he was five years old 
about this.  About this, this house and this one over here that he calls a callow stone house.  Um, 
um damned if I can find that word "callowstone".  [D:  Callow (--)]  It was one of the Kero, 
Kerouac words.  And I can't find it anywhere.  [D:  Uh]  But it's a stone house.  And it's the only 
one on the street.  
D:  Yeah, yeah, it really stands out.  [R:  Yeah]  So the family moved here after they were in the 
cottage?
R:  Uh no.  No, the (--)  Uh, you see I couldn't (--)  Between this house and the other one that we 
saw, they lived across the street from Mr. Turcotte on Beaulieu Street.  [D:  Uh huh]  But they 
lived there only one year.  And uh, we'll see that one later, because we'll be closer.  [Clears 
throat]  And then (--)  Yes!
D:  Now this house really, [R:  320 Hildreth] really fits some of the description of the house in 
The Town and the City.  The big house in, that he describes in The Town and The City.
R:  Yes, but there's a, there's a better description.  The real house is along the river.  [D:  Oh 
okay]  If you want to see that one.  I got the description right here.  [D:  Okay]  We'll read it and 
see if it fits.  
D:  Okay, great!
R:  [Laughs]  Yeah.  The, the school, the Billing Street School is right on the other side of these 
houses over there.  And I, I still haven't found a picture of it, but I'm going to put a, I'll put out an
announcement maybe in the parish bulletin to see if anybody can uh, share a picture of that 
school with me.  Because it's the first school he went to.  You know, and there, there were 
friends.  See he'd walk over here up there.  And then they moved from here to a house down the 
street.  And uh, there's a guy that lived around, around there who was friendly with Jack when he
was in the kindergarten and first grade.  [D:  Huh]  Then after that they lost sight of each other.  
And you know, of course he, he bought his book when it came out.  He says, "his book".  
Meaning that the Town and the City, a lot of people in Lowell say "his book".  And he wrote 
eighteen of them.  [Both laugh]  
D:  So the Town and the City is the one that people in Lowell really associate with?
R:  Yeah.  Or if they know if it's, if that's not the one they think of Dr. Sax.  
D:  Uh huh.  [R:  Yeah]  Uh huh.  
R:  I'm going to park right over here for a moment [D:  okay] and show you where (--)  They 
lived on the second floor of that white house.  And Jack (--)  Yeah, this white one over here.  
D:  This white house here.  Okay.
R:  That's uh, 240 Hildreth.  [D:  Okay]  And [clears throat] he used to go in that uh, attic there 
and play with papers.  They had colored papers.  See Jack's father was a printer.  And uh, he had 
a lot of paper around.  So the kids would go up there and, and play with the, the papers.  And 
from that window you could see the castle of Dr. Sax.  [D:  Oh!]  The castle.  We'll go over and 
see that.  [D:  Okay]  It looks like a real (--)  You can imagine what a five year old kid would do 
standing there in the, in the dreary months of November and uh, think of all of these things.  And
then when he's an, he's an adult, write a whole book on it.  You know, Dr. Sax and uh, Count 
Condu, and, and all of that, you know?  He mentions this place over here in The Book of Dreams
also.  It's up, it's up there.  Uh, but I'll show it to you.  There are some people who doubt that that,
that thing uh, really is, is the castle.  But Jack, in his book, says where it is.  It points out 
specifically.  He says it's near 18th and Bridge Street.  This is Bridge Street okay, and it's right in 
front of us.  Can you see the tower?  It's right between the trees.  [D:  Oh yes!]  Those trees 
weren't there in, in the twenties.  [D:  Yeah, uh huh]  That was 1928 there back there.  You know, 
when Jack was only uh, five or six years old.  
D:  It's a big old, big victorian house. 
R:  Yes.  We'll go right in front of it and I'll show you where it was in the book.  Look at that.  I 
mean you know.  [D:  Yeah]  If you're a five or six year old kid you think that's a castle.
D:  Sure, sure.  [R:  With a tower]  It would really, it would really stand out from that attic 
window.  
R:  Yeah.  Janet Lambert has an old picture of it for me, waiting for me.  I've got to go and get it. 
You know who Janet is right?  she's the, the artist.  [D:  Uh huh]  Let me tell you something.  
When Jack was in the fourth grade he had this nun at St. Louis.  French nun who took a special 
interest in him because he remembered her name when he went on a quiz show.  They used to 
have these Saturday morning quiz shows.  And one of the questions was, what's your, your 
teacher's name?  And he could remember it, you know?
D:  Uh huh.
R:  So she states in one of the thesis that I uh, uh, well she stated and this was reported in a thesis
that was written about Jack, that he was good in history and geography.  Now man the geography
of Jack, you know, you going to back up pal?  [Must be speaking to another driver]  The 
geography of Jack (--)  There it is!  This is the castle.  [D:  Uh huh]  You know.  
D:  Sure, with that tower.  Yeah.
R:  If, if ever I hit the megabucks I'm buying that house.  
D:  [Laughs]  It's a nice house.
R:  That's, that's a house.  [D:  Yeah]  A real castle.  [D:  Yeah]  A castle in a five year old mind.  
[D:  Huh]  And Jack's geography in Lowell is suburb.  He is so precise.  Let me show you.  
There's no doubt about it.  And there's some guy who, who's saying that, that it didn't exist.  
Here's Lupine Road.  This is 35 Burnaby Street.  That's taken from Visions.  Then you got uh, the
95th, then 320 Hildreth.  Okay, this is the Billing School.  All right, that's the Book of Dreams.  
240 Hildreth again.  Oh, 240 Hildreth, that's okay.  Castle on Bridge Street.  Count Condu, okay.  
All right, "a vampire flying in the rainy night river from the old dump along back Textile Field to
the shores of Centraville."  There was a dump over there in Centraville.  "Flying to the door of 
the castle which was located on top of the dreaming meadow."  I'll show you the meadow on the 
other side.  [D:  Uh huh]  "Near Bridge and Eighteenth, up on top of this hill located 
symmetrically a with the old stone castle house on Lakeview Avenue near Lupine Road."  That 
was replaced by condos.  "And the long lost french canadian who God names of my infancy.  
There stands a castle high in the air.  The king surveyor of the Lowell [monocular?] roofs and 
[stansion?] chimneys high in the air."  I'll show you that high in the air.  When we get out of here 
we'll go around and there's a magnificent view of Lowell.  Fantastic!  You can see everything.  
Everything!  That's it.  You know he was a great writer.  Dillon says he's the first american writer 
to write in american.  [D:  Hm]  That means that now we're independent.  We're no longer 
British.  All we have to do is blow up Channel 2 to get rid of all those British programs and bring
in engli(--) american comedy, american language, and the British are foreigners!  [Both laugh]  
You're afraid of that huh?
D:  No.  No.  I think that's great.  
R:  Whenever I watch that my kid, my kid loves, my kid loves uh, The Young Ones.  You know, 
and it's all British comedy, but very slap-stickish and everything.  And whenever I can get 
something like uh, The Three Stooges and uh, uh, Laurel and Hardy, I make sure that I stick the 
darn TV right there and we watch it together.  [D:  Uh huh]  Because I want him to know what 
french, I mean not french, but what american comedy is, you know?
D:  Yeah, really.  Yeah, it's like everything that's english is automatically cultured, right?
R:  Yeah.  I can believe that.  As a matter of fact I know it is.  
D:  Now, now what school is this?
R:  This is the Robinson School.  Do you want to get out over here?
D:  Sure.  Boy you really can see all of Centraville up here.  
R:  Uh huh.  Isn't that something!  [D:  Um] There are better ones that I haven't found yet.  
They're a little bit on that side.  I just had a glimpse of them you know?  [D:  Uh huh]  And I'd 
like to, to get out over here, okay?  [D:  Okay]  And what do you have?  You have some boots on,
or let's see if that snow is hard.  [D:  Okay]  If it isn't well we can still.  [Hear car doors slam]  
Wait a minute.  Can you make it?  [D:  Yup]  All right.  Oh yes!  Good.  Woops!  Oh yeah, it's 
hard.  It's hard enough to (--)  So here's the meadow sort of.  [D:  Uh huh]  High on a hill.  [D:  
Yup]  There's the castle.  [D:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just]  You see the University of Lowell here.  All
right.  Now, uh, the mills.  The chimneys that are forever pointing up.  Saint Patrick's and the 
gold dome of the Greek Church, City Hall.  All right?  [D:  Uh huh]  Now let's come, come back 
to the three chimneys.  The one on the right, okay, right under it, that's St. Louis School  [D:  
Okay, yes]  That's where Jack went to school for the kindergarten, first, second, third and fourth 
grade.   That was his school.  And then if you go up that chimney just above St. Louis there, to 
the left of the chimney, just right there you see another school.  That's St. Joseph's.  He went 
there for one year.  [D:  Uh huh]  And then to the left of that, before you get to the middle 
chimney, you see the top of St. Jean Baptiste Church.  
D:  This is great.  So you can see all of the, [R:  yup] all of Centraville and all of (--)  Now 
Centraville was, was it all called Centraville, or are there different parts [unclear]?
R:  Centraville was on this side of the river.  You see the bridge, but it's all at our feet over here.  
Before the, on this side, [D:  uh huh] before the, the mills.  The mills are on the other side.  
Where that high rise building is the uh, the student union building, that's where "Little Canada" 
was.  But Centraville was all this over here.  This is "Christian Hill" and down below, below that,
you can't see it, that's West Centraville.  But all of this part, the northern part and this side of 
Beaver Brook is Centraville.  Centerville.  See?  See, "if at night a man goes out to the woods 
surrounding Galloway and stands on a hill, he can see it all there before him in broad panorama.  
The river crossing slowly in an arc.  The mills with their long rows of windows all aglow.  The 
factory stacks rising higher than the church steeples."  [D:  Umhm]  There's not a church steeple 
(--)  Even Saint Patrick's is not [D:  yeah], is not high enough to go over the, the smallest 
chimney.  They're about the same size.  Well maybe a little, a few inches different, but the three 
big ones, uh uh.  But he knows that this is not the true galloway.  "Something in the invisible 
brutting landscapes surrounding the town.  Something in the bright stars nodding close to a 
hillside where the old cemetery sleeps.  Something in the soft swishing tree leaves over the leaf, 
over the fields and stone walls tells him a different story."  Okay, come on now, turn.  Here it is.  
He looks at the names in the old cemetery.  Williams, Thompson, Laplanche, Smith, McCarthy, 
Sotakos.  These names don't exist by the way.  Sotakos and Laplanche, I haven't found them in a,
in a book.  In the uh, [chuckles] you know, the telephone book.  [D:  Uh huh]  He feels the slow 
deep pulsing of the river of life.  I've heard some people sing about Paris.  But to write about 
Lowell this way?  [D:  Yeah]  [Laughing]  You've got to be kidding.  You've got to have some 
sort of uh, uh, feeling for, for the womb.  You know, for going back home.  That's what Jack was,
you know?  
D:  So this is probably where he was standing when he was thinking of this.
R:  He went all over the place.  He says it in the introduction to "Lonesome Traveler", that, that 
uh, he travelled day and night around the rivers, and the brooks, and the fields, and everything, 
you know, all around Lowell when he was a kid.  [D:  Um]  He played hooky so much when he 
was in high school that he was out forty-five days out of a school year.  [D:  Oh jeese]  And he 
missed honor role by one point.  He had an eighty-four average.  And he wasn't even in a french 
class, he was in Spanish.  That's how they fucked him up you know, over there.  Well they didn't, 
he wasn't fucked up, he just, it's just he, by chance he took the only useful course that I think he 
ever had in, in high school and that was typing,  because he typed.  He didn't write.  He typed.  
Truman Capote accused him of that.  Luckily he said it, because now we know  [Both laugh] 
what he thought of him, you know?  [Sounds of footsteps in the snow]  It was great typing 
though.  [D:  Yeah, really]  Oh boy!  [D:  Really]  Yup, woe!  
D:  So was this your world over here when, when you were growing up?
R:  Oh yeah.  Instead of coming up here though I'd go along the brooks, you know?  It was my 
world, oh yes.  When I read Jack sometimes I'll stop at the end of a, a paragraph, and I'll re-read 
it.  Reread it, you know, and, and think about it.  It's almost like going through meditation.  You 
know how it is in, in church and in the uh, it's so much part of.  I lived in the same neighborhood 
as this guy, you know?  
D:  So do you fell almost like you're finding yourself when you, when you read his books?  
R:  Partly.  Partly.  Because I don't think I would have had the courage to, to do what he did.  Go 
on the road like he did with fifty bucks in my pocket.  No.  I'd have my Visa Card and I'd make 
sure that I had a big line of credit, like seven, eight thousand dollars before I'd do something like 
that.  [D:  Chuckles]  No, Jack was more courageous.  He did it just (--)  You know, and he found
friends and everything.  You know?  But uh, I wanted to get back to the one "On The Road".  Uh,
even though he doesn't mention french too much, the whole tenor of that book is, is really french.
Because they're like little stories one after the other.  And before the advent of television and 
even the radio how did people entertain themselves out of you know, they didn't always go to 
bed?  They had these, these evening parties at home and one of them would get up and tell 
stories.  That still happens in a french wedding and probably in Italy.  You know, the 
traditional(--)  Someone would get up and sing a song, [D:  umhm] or tell a story.  [D:  Umhm]  
Well I remember when I was a kid and we'd go to my grandfather's house and he'd tell stories.  
Or at night sometimes we'd be telling, told some stories.  And little Jack was there and he'd listen
to them.  And when he grew up he wrote a book where when you were on the road I would tell 
my story until I was finished.  And then you, and you would listen.  Okay.  And then uh, after 
Moriarty was done telling his story, then Sal would tell his story if you remember.  And 
everybody else would listen.  Then somebody else.  So that method of writing, that's typically 
french Lowell Centraville.  [D:  Huh]  You know?  [D:  Huh, that's]  Very, very, very french.  [D: 
Well that's a good]  That's the way I interpret it.  I would say it's a, it's one way of interpreting it, 
you know?  
D:  Uh huh.
R:  And it was all stories about America.  About the United States.  Well more than the United 
States, because there's Canada, Mexico and he goes into Mexico, you know? 
side one ends
side two begins
D:  So what kind of stories would your grandfather tell?  
R:  He told funny stories.  Uh, his, his was uh, or he'd tell stories that uh, talked about the ghosts 
you know, or saints that had died.  And uh, funny stories about the uh, the clergy and the nuns, 
you know.  Although you respected them very much there was still that touch you know, of, of 
uh, of humor in them.  
D:  I get the sense that Father Morrissette comes, has that talent.  That a lot of his way with 
people is in his ability to tell stories.  Is that, is that fair to say?
R:  I think Father Morrissette has, has that touch.  Oh yes!  He loves to tell stories.  And, but his 
stories often times are, are, well they're drawn from experience, you know.  He's, he's, he has 
known presidents, like Eisenhower very closely.  Kennedy.  You know, the White House was 
opened to him twice.  And it could just happen a third time.  If Dukakis makes it "Spike" is in 
another time.  He's got a key to the White House.  [D:  Huh]  Really.  
D:  Now this is a real, there's a lot of ranch houses here.  Are these all newer houses?  
R:  Yup, these, these are new.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And that big building behind us there, that's Saint 
Louis.
D:  Saint Louis School.  [R:  Oh yeah]  What, what street is this?  
R:  This is um, Bunker Hill.  Bunker Hill uh (--)  Jack refers to it often in, in the "Book of 
Dreams".  It's weird this "Book of Dreams".  Because all he did was record his dreams right after
he, he woke up.  Ooh good!  This is all parish property right here.  
D:  This is all Saint Louis.
R:  Yup, that's Saint Louis School.  There's the convent.  There's the church and there's the 
rectory.  [D:  Uh huh]  Now we're going to walk a little bit, okay?  [D:  Okay, good]  [Long 
pause-sounds of car doors closing]  When Jack wrote his books, or when he, when he grew up 
here, there was only this part of the church.  Uh, all along you see.  But they, they built it up in 
1954.  [Background voice:  Good morning!]  Good morning!  [Background voice:  How are 
you?]  Fine, how's it going Ginger.  [Background voice:  Good.  Are you giving a tour?]  Yeah.  
[Background voice:  Huh?]  Yeah, to show people what this is all about.  So that's what happens. 
Background voice:  Yeah, they dry up.  We have to make some ashes for Wednesday.  Don't 
forget.
D:  Oh yes.
R:  Oh yes, it's Ash Wednesday.
Background voice:  The tape is running.
R:  Yeah, well it's suppose to.
Background voice:  Oh, it's suppose to run.  [Chuckles]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
Background voice:  He's recording us.  Right?
D:  That's right.
R:  Right.  He's a Sexton.  [Background voice:  Yeah]  Ginger Marin.  [Background voice:  Yeah]
Everybody had a nickname.
Background voice:  And who is this man?
R:  This is Doug.  Doug DeNatale.  [Background voice:  Yeah]  And he's doing some work on uh,
on Lowell and the french people, and all kinds of (--)
Background voice:  Well where are you from?
D:  Well I'm from Connecticut originally, but I'm working for the Library of Congress, you know,
in Washington.  We're doing a project here in Lowell this year.  We're going around and 
interviewing people in the different communities.
Background voice:  You've got a lot of history to pick up here huh?
D:  There's a, there's a lot of history in here, yeah.
R:  Yes, oh yeah.
Background voice:  There's the man that knows all about it.
R:  Um, are you going to be in the school?
D:  Yeah, I'm finding that out.
Background voice:  After we go for coffee.  Why, you want to get in now?
R:  Well. 
Background voice:  What do you want to do, just go over?]
R:  Well I can't get in now.  I'd like to just get in uh, uh, uh, in a few minutes, you know, to show 
him inside the school.  
Background voice:  If I unlock it [Another voice:  all you've got to do is walk through] you can 
walk through it.
R:  Okay, good, good.  
Background voice:  Well I have to (--)  There's some girls there.  There's some girls downstairs, 
[Another voice:  where?] but uh they're having the uh, the exercise there.  [Another voice:  Oh 
yeah!] 
R:  Oh, the cheerleaders?
Background voice:  The cheerleaders, yeah.  [Another voice:  Yeah]  But I don't know if the 
doors are unlocked upstairs.
Another voice:  I'm going to unlock the door for them.  
Background voice:  Upstairs? 
Another voice:  No, over here.
Background voice:  All right.  Unlock this door and (--)
Another voice:  Yeah.
R:  And we'll, we'll be back in about oh, probably ten minutes.  Okay?  I want to take him 
around.
Background voice:  Unlock this door and check the other door, [Another voice:  umhm] see if 
you can go upstairs that way.  
R:  Yes, yes, I'd like to go upstairs.  
Background voice:  Go in from the basement, go upstairs.
R:  All right.  [Background voice:  all right now?]  Thank you Ginger.  
D:  All right.  Thank you.  
Background voice:  We'll see you Doug.
D:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Okay.  [Pause]
D:  So there's [unclear] to the church than [unclear] section?
R:  Yeah.  See, the section, the church was a cellar.  And it went only up to here.  [D:  Uh huh]  
You know?  [D:  Uh huh]  And the, the original plan was to build over it.  It would have been a 
massive cathedral.  [D:  Oh yeah]  You know, it would have been something that, that, that would
have been worthy of a cathedral parish.  
D:  You can see with that heavy stone foundation.  
R:  Yeah, right.  [D:  Yeah]  And it was named after the crusader, St. Louis the IX, King of 
France.  [D:  Uh huh]  And they got his statue over here in full soldier uh, he's in combat, combat
uniform.  [Chuckles]  With the, you know, (--)  [Noise of cars passing by]  So in '54 what they 
did is they through the wall over in the front and took the, part of the ceiling out, and they just 
built over it, you see?  So when you step into the church you step down.  
D:  Oh.  [R:  Yeah]  Oh, so when Jack was here it was just the, the bottom part.  
R:  Oh yeah, just the bare bottom thing, you know.  It was uh (--)  And I, I found pictures of it 
when it was an old church, you know?  See, you can see how it is.  [D:  Oh yeah, yup]  It's sort of
square, you know, it has none of the uh, uh, it has none of that uh, aura of a gothic cathedral, or 
an Italian uh, uh, church, you know, like you see in, when you go to those beautiful Renaissance 
things.  
D:  Now was, was this neighborhood all french?
R:  No, that's, that's the difference between this neighborhood and Little Canada.  Little Canada 
was 100% french, everybody spoke french there.  Over here was about 80%.  See, and 
everybody, mostly everybody, but you had a few that were not.  And these are the ones that you 
got to know.  Like over there, down there, there were a few polish people.  There's a polish 
neighborhood there.  There's still a polish church.  And they're, they're national, the national 
polish.  They got their own.  They don't believe in the Pope.  
D:  That's right.  They, they broke away from the Catholic church, yeah.
R:  Right.  And uh, yeah.  All, everybody over here was french.  This was you know, a french 
neighborhood.  You had uh, and there we are.  See down the corner where we were before?  [D:  
Oh yes, right]  And uh, you had many markets, like you got one over here. Baribeault's Market.  
You have probably ten of them like that.  Little markets, you know.  Like you, you find uh, uh, 
well in the North End you've got them still.  And it's, it's not like that, that uh, attitude that people
have when they go into a supermarket.  No, it's more personalized.  Personal thing, you know?  
You go in there, say, "well you know I'd like it cut this way for me", and that way, and you watch
them cut it.  [Chuckles]  You know.  
     Over here is Beaulieu Street.  See Beaulieu and Boisvert were two of the founders of the 
parish.  [D:  Ah!]  They were both businessmen.  Boisvert built the houses, Beaulieu was a 
businessman.  [D:  Huh]  You know?  [D:  Uh huh]  And they named these two streets after him.  
And the grey one over here is uh, where they lived.  [D:  So]  34 Beaulieu Street when, when 
Jack was, was three four years old.  Four years old.  And uh, his older brother Gerard passed 
away.  
D:  And they were only here for a year then?
R:  Maybe less, could be less.  But Jack remembers when he, he used to go from this house, up 
the street, over.  As a matter of fact he describes it in uh, in detail in "Visions of Gerard" uh, 
about how that was.  Right here.  
D:  But now is this a single family house, or is this a?
R:  Single family.  [D: Oh!  Unclear]  Yup, single family.  [Voice in car in background]  "It's a 
cold crisp morning in October.  Gerard is going to school with his books, and bread, and butter, 
and banana lunch, and an apple.  I watch him going down Beaulieu Street alone.  Gangs of kids 
run around.  A the end of Beaulieu Street there's a large gravel play yard of the Green Public 
School, where because the kids weren't catholic the nuns have been telling Gerard and them and 
the kids at St. Louis de France Parochial School that they have tails concealed beneath their 
trousers,  which some of us, I for one, seriously believe.  At that street Gerard turns right to go to 
St. Louis, which is right there along three wooden fences of bungalow."  Now this Green School 
is really Greenhalge.  Greenhalge School.  [D:  Ooh!  Okay]  So he used to, he used to uh, 
change some names.  He didn't change St. Louis, but uh, he changed some names.  And that was 
the Green School.  Now there's a little bit of humor there, because really uh, uh, the nuns 
sometimes would stretch it.  But I mean I, we all had stories.  I don't know if you went to 
catholic schools.
D:  Oh I did.  I did.  [R:  You did?]  Oh yeah!
R:  Yeah, well you know.  Be careful.  Don't touch yourself tonight, because there was a little boy
who did and the next morning when he woke up his hand was withered away, and it was like a 
chicken claw.  [D:  Chuckling]  My god!  When I heard that story you know, I didn't want to go 
to the bathroom.  [D:  Yeah]  And as a result you know, I let it hang and it would frizzle, frazzle 
and you know, wet me all over my pants and everything.  [Both laugh]  You know, that sort of 
thing.
D:  Yes, yes.  I, I remember similar things, yes.  
R:  That type of story where uh, sex was such a hangup that we weren't able to explore ourselves,
you know.
D:  Right, right. 
R:  [Laughs]  Oh boy!  I remember going to kindergarten over here.  [D:  Huh]  And I didn't last 
too long.  Then I went over there and I lasted eight, nine years.  You know?  
D:  So now Jack was born in 19 [R:  22] 22.  So he was what, about ten years older than you, is 
that?
R:  Oh, he was, when he came here he was uh, oh, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old.  [D:
Uh huh]  He was here five years in this school, or the, the little one, you know, on Billings Street.
And of course it's a uh, they don't teach too much french here anymore.  But it is a french school,
look.  Ecole.  [D:  Yeah, ecole.  Yeah]  Ecole St. Louis.  And it's the big school.  "First you see 
the nun's home.  Red brick, bright in the morning sun.  Then the gloomy edifice of the school 
house itself, which is it's planks, sallow halls and vase basement of urinals and echo calls.  And 
beyond the yard with it's special, I never forgot, little enoch yard of cinder gravel."  That's on the 
other side.  We'll go in for (--)  If they left the door open we'll go in and I'll show you what the 
school looks like.  Some, some of the aspects (--)
D:  See I'd love to get, I'd love to get a photograph of you maybe standing in front of the school.
R:  Sure, okay.  
D:  Let me do that.  
R:  All right.  Tell me where I should stand, or whatever.
D:  Yeah, right about there will be fine.  
R:  Okay.  [You can hear the sound of wind in the background]  
D:  Great.  [Sound of zipper from camera case]
R:  Every morning the kids line up over here between the church and the school.  And the nun 
comes out with a big brass bell and she clanks away at it.  Kids line up in silence.  Then they file 
in.  They still do it that way.  It's weird.  Some of it has changed, but most of it has remained the 
same.  
D:  Um.  Did you have school uniforms?  
R:  Yes!  My daughter has a school uniform.  She comes to school here.  You know loyalty runs 
very very deep among the french.  All of the ethnic groups, you know?  Let's see if they open this
one.  No, it's the other one.  
D:  Well how about in your family, does your, does your daughter speak french?  
R:  Oh no.  My wife is, doesn't speak french.  We, we speak you know.  No, I guess we can't.  
They probably (--)  [D:  No]  See what happened here for many years, up until the sixties, was 
that half the day was in french.  In the morning they gave the lessons in french, in the afternoon 
in english.  And then one month, that was one month.  Then the next month they flip flopped it.  
And you came in in the morning and your lessons were given to you in english and in the 
afternoon the lessons were given in french.  But it wasn't indiscriminate.  There were certain 
subjects that they taught in french and others that they taught in english.  The english ones were 
history, american history, or history of the United States, english, math and science.  Those were 
taught in english.  What was taught in french was religion.  Uh, history of Canada.  Had to know 
the history of your ancestors, you know.  And uh, music.  They taught us songs.  And all kinds of 
things in french that we'd sing at church, or at gatherings.  Uh, [siren in background] few other 
subjects, you know.  And the kids came in to a class if it was english and we started with Pledge 
of Allegiance, you know.  And when it was french, well they had a special Pledge of Allegiance 
there too, to a flag that was ours.  You know, with a sacred heart in it and a cross, and it was 
white and blue.  You know, the blue and white would be the french colors, you know.  And uh, 
then we said our rosary.  You know.  I mean the education that we got here was uh, uh, a heaven 
education, where we were suppose to grow up to be angels.  [D:  Uh huh]  You know.  
Sometimes we've become a desolate of angels, desolation angels.  [D:  Yeah, yeah]  You know.  
But look, look, look at the physical set up.  Right here, it's dramatic.  Look.  
D:  Yeah, it really makes a world of it's own.  Yeah.
R:  See.  The nuns over here.
D:  They're doing like two arms embracing.  
R:  Yeah, and protecting the little shits, the kids.  You know?   You got that, the convent, the 
school, that's their activity.  And then the church.  And then the rectory and their activities over 
there.  And we're over here.  You know, and we're suppose to grow up to be angels and 
eventually to go to heaven.  [Siren in background]  That's a very strong idea in Kerouac's books, 
[D:  Yeah] as you well know.  [D:  Yeah]  You know, uh, "we're going back home.  Home is 
heaven."  [Chuckles]  You know.  
D:  And you got the, you get the feeling that there is a lot of conflict in that as well.  
R:  Oh yes, yes, yes!  I know a way of getting in.  Let's get in through here.  I'll bother the nuns.  
They'll let me go in the school.  [Sound of footsteps]  Yeah, well it was really uh (--)  [Sound of 
zipper]
D:  [Unclear]
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
D:  No, sorry.  You were saying.
R:  No, I said it was really, really something going through the school over here.  The nuns are 
still here.  They have a lot of uh, uh, you know, lay teachers, but uh, the same, same philosophy 
is there.  And as you point out the conflict, the conflict is there.  I see it in my kids.  Uh, (--)
D:  The strong must be, I mean the, the pull must be very strong.  You know, like you were 
saying about your you know, your daughter?
R:  Yeah, religious, oh yeah!.  [D:  Growing up here and]  Because she's, she's uh, um, my 
daughter is, is uh, strong willed, strong mind, you know.  
D:  [Unclear] one of the field workers, is Brother Soucy here?  Is that?
R:  He's right there.
D:  Yeah, one of the field reps for the project did an interview with him.  [R:  Yes, and]  And then
he was saying how he was brought up in this parish.  You know, he went away and his real desire
was to come back here.
R:  Oh yes!  "Big dirt yard, which becomes a field down at Farmer Kelly, Kenney's Meadow by a
small granite wall not a foot high."  See over here this big crack here?  [D:  Uh huh]  All along?  
There was a wall here and this is the wall that he's talking about.  Okay?  And it went down one 
foot.  And the kids used to sit here.  And it's, it spelled also the boundary, the boundary between 
where the girls would be and the boys.  Well let me tell you that right now the boys have to play 
over here and the girls up here when school is in session man.  Oh no, we can't let them get 
together, because they may go home pregnant.  [Chuckles]  Uh, you know.
D:  When they're five and six years old.  
R:  Yeah, my gosh.  You know.  [D:  Unclear]  And they throw cards against, they used to throw 
cards against these walls.  Yes, you were saying?
D:  Now Father um, Farmer Kenney, what, what was that?
R:  Farmer Kenney, there's a big farm there that was Farmer Kenney's.  They called it that.  
Farmer Kenney's.  There was a big wide open thing there.  [Sirens in background]  And then he 
says, "the big game is card slinging.  The bubble bum, bubble gum cards with pictures of movie 
stars and baseball players.  Great God, it must have been Wilmer Ban, Wilmer Banke and Rogers
Hornsby with young faces on the fragrant bubble gum cards.  They are flung against the wall and
nearest wins.  The big game a recess.  Gerard comes slowly luminating in the bright morn among
the happy children.  Today his mind is perplexed and he looks up into the perfect cloudless 
empty blue and wonders what all the bruting and furor, furor is about, is below.  What all the 
yelling in the building, the humanity, the concern.  Maybe there's nothing at all.  He divines in 
his illusive pureness, just like the smoke that comes out of Papa's pipe.  The pictures that the 
smoke makes.  all I got to do is close my eyes and it all goes away.  There is no Mama, no tit 
Jean, no tit Nin, Papa, no me, no kitige the cat, there is no earth.  Look at the perfect sky, it says 
nothing.  Little snivelly Plourde's is losing at a game of cards in the corner.  The bullies buffered 
him out.  He's crying.  He only thinks of his luck and his luck is worse.  His luck is mixed up in 
the bad and the poor.  Uh, the world.  To the other end is the presbyter, rectory where Father Pere
Lalumiere, the cure lives and other priests.  A yellow brick house, awesome to the children as it 
is a kind of chalice in itself and we imagine candles, candle parades in there at night and snow 
white lace at breakfast."
     This Pere Lalumiere that he mentions, phonetically he changed the name of the priest.  The 
name of the priest was Labossiere.  Even phonetically it's improved by him and visually also.  
Lalumiere.  You know what Lalumiere means?  [D:  The light]  The light.  And Labossiere, boss 
means a hump, you know?  And he changes the uh, the explosive to the labio.  You know, la, la, 
la to babos.  He did a lot of stuff in illiteration.  A lot of stuff in uh, uh, in poetry that wasn't 
simply attached to the rhyme at the end of a line, but at the beginning and in the middle.  You 
know?  A lot of poetry in his writings.
     And in there right, all the kids imagined what kind of house that would be, that was.  Even I, I
was an alter boy and we hardly ever went into, in there.  [D:  yeah]  But inside it hasn't changed. 
Uh, it's the same as it was, you know, a long long time ago when the kids you know, the kids 
were over here.  When he was over here.  
D:  How much contact did the priests have with the families.  I mean did [unclear]?
R:  Well they used to visit the families every, every year.  It was called the parish visits.  And the 
uh, they each had a cluster of, of families that they would visit at home and talk to them.  And the
priest would come out and say hello to the, the children.  I think, I don't know if he mentions it 
here.  "In the church, Saint
Louis de France, a basement affair then with concrete cross.  And inside the ancient smoothe 
pews and stains windows, and stations of the cross, an alter, and special alters for Mary and 
Joseph.  Antiques mahogany confessionals with winey drapes and ornate peoples, bead doors."  
Let's get in.  Wait a minute.  
D:  Well it certainly brings back memories to me too.
R:  Well yeah!  You know, you went through the same uh (--)
D:  There really is something universal about growing up in the catholic education.
R:  Absolutely.  [D:  Yeah]  You know?  [Lots of noise]  Oh yeah.  [Sighs]  Yeah, this is where 
(--)  You know Jack, Jack's best known book is "On The Road", but as far as he was concerned, 
his favorite was "Visions of Gerard".  This one over here.  [D:  Uh]  There are no periods in this 
book.  Just slashed, okay.  That's a long conversation about his, his childhood.  We may at one 
time discover that this is the real Jack here going back home like a kid.  You know, when we, we 
sit down and what is it?  What the hell is it all about?  You know?
D:  I think there was such a, I mean it's so clear that there's such a strong, strong place for him in 
Lowell.  
R:  He got this influence from his brother.
D:  You know, this you know, always comes back to him.
R:  Yeah, five books out of eighteen.  [D: yeah]  That's a hell of a big chunk.  Now when you talk
about Lowell you got to be careful about what you say.  That's why there was such resentment on
the part of the Sampas' against uh, Joe Nicosia.  You were there for the meetings.
D:  Yes, yeah. 
R:  And it's going to be even stronger tomorrow.  
D:  Now why is that?
R:  He, he didn't make the first pages of his book.  When he talked about Lowell he didn't make 
it look good.  He didn't make it look that way Jack thought about it.  You know, he, he, sure 
Lowell isn't uh, isn't sunny California, but again it isn't, it isn't the dreary years.  Jack wouldn't 
say that "Visions of Girard" is his favorite book if it were a dreary thing.  Sure he talks about 
death.  How did he talk about death?  How does he talk about heaven?  How does he talk 
about(--)  Sure he's a lot of sadness and everything, but it's not all uh, uh, negative.  It isn't.  He 
didn't view it that way and we don't view it this way either.  Sure there's a conflict over here, by 
maybe we want that, you know?  [D:  well that]  Uh, my daughter doesn't have any hangups 
about it, you know?  She's, she fights against the nuns and the nuns fight against her.  And it's 
one struggle, you know?  Really.  Oh they know she wants to take over the class.  And they don't,
they won't let her!  And I don't want them to let her take over the class.  [D:  Chuckles]  You 
know?  She's not a Kerouac type.  Kerouac, they, very few nuns would remember who he is.  He 
was, he was shy and self evasing.  I, I found that.  You know.  And, and I have uh, I have uh, 
corresponded with his kindergarten teacher who is still alive.  She doesn't remember him.  [D:  
Chuckles
