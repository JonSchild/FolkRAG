THE MEYER BROTHERS. 
Written by H ARRY Moult's, .and sung with immense success at 
TONY PASTOR'S Theatre, by Monnis and FIELDS. 
ON 
a 
ship from Germany we came, 
Three weeks ago last Thursday ; 
Dis country we are liking pretty well. 
"Wen we're coming from de ship out, 
De both of us was laughing, 
Yen we're hearing de music of Castle Garden bell. 
CHORUS. 
All say—efery day, 
Dot we are getting hoaldy, 
Und dot you can't tell us from one another, 
Und of any one asks you who we are, 
Why of course den you can tell dem 
Dere is Jakey Meyer und de odor one is his brudder. 
Yen we are walking Sundays out, 
De girls dey say we're mashers ; 
But we are understanding dis language not. 
Aber wen ley smile mid wink dree times, 
We walk den proud like peacocks, 
Und put on all de style dot we hale got. 
All say, etc.

THE PULLING MACHINE. 
An original recitation. 
Written by HARRY MORRIS. 
HE 
was an old bum, all broke up, 
Und walking down de street ; 
In his pocket dere was not one cend, 
He vas waiting to get a 
treat. 
About twendy-dree persons he had stopped, 
Und asked if dey could help him ; 
How sad he vas when dey shook dere heads, 
Und sait, " Old boy, dot's too thin." 
At last he struck a 
bier saloon, 
He approached it very shy, 
And stood in front as if petrified, 
Humming " the Sweet By und By." 
But soon he took up courage, 
Und went in where the lunch was spread ; 
He made a 
grab at a 
horse radish, 
Wen a 
beer keg hit his head; 
He looked arount 
Und sait, " Boys, dot aint fair ; " 
His ears dey flashed, his eyes sunburnt, 
Und his head stood on his hair. 
De bartender den went up to him, 
Mit joy his face did beam— 
Und says, " Friend, how much can you pull 
On dot dere pulling machine ? " 
De burn walked lip to de pulling machine, 
For his anger was aroused, 
And hollered loud, " I'll beat any man here 
Pulling in de house." 
De bet was done ; a 
little man 
De first to pull was made, 
He grabbed the handles and done it well, 
De bands showed dwo hundred eight. 
De bum he was de next to try, 
He wanted a 
good start ; 
( 
₹: I 
+Mb.,

THE PULLING MACHINE.—Concluded. 
De gang looked at de barkeeper und 
" 
Give it to him hard." 
He grabbed de handles mit deathlike grip, 
Und hollered " dot will do," 
In another second he gafe a 
kick, 
Und in de air flew his left shoe. 
He hollered " Murder," " Watch," " Police," 
Und sait, " Oh, let me go," 
He knocked de skin all off his knees, 
For he did struggle so ; 
The barkeeper at last let him come down, 
He fell on de floor mit a 
crash, 
He didn't wait to go out de door, 
But jumped (Trough de window und broke de sash. 
Out on de sidewalk dey found him 
Laying stiff und stark, 
Dey all took dere hats off und den sang 
" 
Twilight in de park." 
A 
policeman put him in a 
dray ; 
He thought it wasn't right 
To see a 
man disturb the peace, 
Especially if lie's tight. 
But alas! dot poor old burn was gone, 
He tried hard to wake him up 
By hitting him on de head und feet 
Mt a 
policeman's billy club ; 
Dey brought de cor'ner, who felt his pulse, 
Den lookt aroma rind sait, 
" 
I'm sorry 
here, bring me a 
beer, 
Be jabers, the man is dead ! 
De cor'ner's jury sat on him, 
De jurors lookt serene, 
Their verdict was, " He came to death 
From pulling—de pulling machine."

Und talk of dein all day ;

We are two cidy faders, we're 
De dwo Dutch Aldermen. 
CHOEUS. 
Oh, my, look at dat,

We are dwo eidy faders, we're 
De dwo Dutch Aldermen. 
On 'lection day we go around 
To efery poll, you see, 
We hold our tickets in de air, 
De people shond mit glee. 
We buy the beer for efeu one, 
De cidy pays for dem, 
Und den dey all drink to de health 
Of de dwo two Dutch Aldermen.

SKATING ON THE POND. 
Written by Han= Monnis, and sung by the LAN-raS BROTHERS. 
OF 
all the winter's pleasures, 
The time to pass away, 
The sleighing and snowballing, 
That we have every day; 
There's one that snits my fancy, 
Of which I 
am quite fond, 
To go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
CHORUS. 
Spread the eagle, oh, how nice, (Sym.) 
Skating backwards on the slippery ice, (Sym.) 
The pleasures of the winter, 
Of none I 
am so fond, 
As to go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
One pleasant winter's evening, 
At half-past seven or eight, 
I 
went to skate upon the pond, 
And there I 
met my fate. 
She was dressed in blue and Astrakan, 
And skipped along /a 
grand. 
My heart was won by a 
pretty girl, 
While Skating on the Pond. 
Spread the eagle, etc.

DEBI BOYS I 
THE inventive genius of Yankee juveniles has brought out a 
new toy. 
It consists of a 
tin box with a 
hole punched in the 
end, through which they.draw a 
waxed thread, makinu most un-
earthly noises— some like bens, others like sick cats, and some 
perfe tly demoniacal in sound. 
The citizens of Brookly, have 
been much annoyed by " leetle boys mit boxes." 
Our foreign 
correspondent from " over the river" sends us the following 
germanesque effusion. 
Der schades ut night vas vallin' down 
Ofer der roofs of Brooklyn town, 
Ten droo der slitreets you hear dear noise 
Of five, six hundred leetle boys 
Alit boxes. 
Dese boxes vot dey shteels, I 
know, 
Dey doesn't buy dem any how; 
Und round der shtreets dey goes in " rings," 
A-bullin' at dem cursed dings, 
Like hens I

ge THE RIVAL MUSICIANS." 
Ill tell you of a 
loving youth, 
Who deep in love did fall. 
With a 
e.ushing maid of forty-five, 
Who was wrinkled, spare and tall. 
He used to i)lay the double bass, 
And he was mad. von bet ! 
When he found he had a 
rival 
Who played the clarionet. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they ‘ver, a 
pretty pair, 
As ever vet was seen; 
he'd play her gentle music 
On his double bass machine. 
They'd walk out in the moonlight, 
And love stories he'd relate, 
And serenade at evening, 
Or neath her window wait, 
But the clarionet man was crafty, 
His hair was fiery red, 
He made this damsel promise 
That only be she'd wed, 
Yes, they were. cto. 
When the " Double Basser" heard tld-, 
It was An Rwrill blow, 
It tnakl, him feel so very weak, 
He couldn't hold his bow. 
He made his will that evening, 
On death he did decide, 
He crawled into his double bass, 
And there he calmly died. 
Yes, th• -
 w; re, (..czt 
The clarionet man was very glad, 
For now he'd claim his bride, 
He blowed so hard that evening 
He Wowed himself cross-eyed. 
Every night a 
form is seen 
With spectacles on his face, 
Playing funeral marches 
On his ghostly double biss, 
Yes,

THE LARDY DARDY DO.-1CoNcLuDLF.1 
If the duns should annoy which very often they do, 
And domestics admit you're in the way, 
Being caught in the trap, and when there's no escape, 
Then the greatest sang-froid you displav; 
So with calm, smiling face, and with unruffled grace, 
The tormentor it's thus you receive : 
I'm just off to my club, and really cannot be bored, 
And Alister Brown with thanks then takes his leave. 
Spoken—Now, that's the best of Brown, he's so eaFily put oft 
but at the same time I 
must ask you as a 
particular favor not to 
mention to him that—Cnoaus. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy, now, for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be Lad, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, never asking the price, 
For such rneanness would truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardy Dardy is no coin of the realm, 
Though I 
find it always seems with me to go. 
Spoken—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be -ron-
lered at, for you see—Cuoaus. 
With our fair sex my Lardy Dardy Do is the go, 
And it seems the sweet darlings to impress; 
I've already the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been " yes r' 
But the worldly papas, and the cautions mammas, 
When their dauzliters' affections I 
woo, 
Always say when I 
tell thorn upon -what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy Dardy Do. 
Spoken—Which is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
Er;:11 the dear girls wt add gladly share my fate, although.—CnoaLts. 
In the Times of to-morrow, if you'll kindly observe, 
Advertised there, this notice then will be: 
Mister Remus MacRomulus is now in town, 
And enabled his pupils to see; 
Will instruct in this art. and Lis genius impart, 
To the brave, to the fair, anl the t! 
-Who — able to shell wit ready L. S. D. 
Can substitute the Lardy Dardy Do. 
Spoken—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm open fr;trn ten till eix

Banjo solo. Written by PHIL H . 
Mownar. Dedicated to Mr. Frill 
Mna.mt, of Philadelphia, Penn. 
Oh, I'll sing to you of a 
nice young gal, 
Day called her Saria Jane, 
She fell in lub wid a 
clam-dealer, 
And Sammy was his name. 
He used to lake her every wheres, 
And her he'd often treat, 
He went to see her every night, 
At her home in Lombard street. 
As Saria Jane walked out one day, 
All in the summer's heat, 
She met her dear young Sam- u- el, 
Wid auoder gal in the street; 
When Saria Jane she saw this, 
"Revenge I'll have," she said. 
So she went and stole a 
sweet-potato, 
And stabbed this Clam Man dead. 
When dis young gal Sam was walking wid, 
Saw dat he was no more, 
She rushed away wid all her might, 
Into a 
grocery store. 
Oh, there she seized a 
half of a 
cheese, 
Dat on de counter lied, 
She swallowed it do ivn all at once, 
Gave up the ghost and died. 
When Saria Jane saw they were dead, 
She said she'd live no more, 
So she tried to hang herself, 
By standing on her head on de floor. 
She soon found out, dat wouldn't do, 
So another way she tried, 
Shejumped off her bed down on de floor, 
Eickfed out be foots and died.

Und ask us if we got de blues, 
Und say den, " Dutchey, can you float 
Und stag dem wooden shoes ? "

While mit dem shoes we dance.

We bit him in the mouth and said, 
Oh, how dot was for high ?

HE 
gave me a 
pretty red rose, 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said, as he kiss'd me good-bye, 
Wear this in your breast, love, for me. 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will cling : 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing ! 
CIIORITS. 
My pretty red rose, my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little token, my pretty red rose, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
I'll sing of my pretty red rose ! 
'Tis a 
dear little inem'ry of love, 
flow sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly I'll treasure its leaves 
Tho' their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls ev'ry sigh to repose ; 
Tho' now we're apart, still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose I

Or else on the Exchange ;

I'd never put a

So let them think me what they choose, 
As long as its something " proper ;"

Well, now, when I'm in the city, I 
am 
Something in the city. 
Cho.—I'm something in the city, 
Yaas, something in the city, 
You'll find it highly proper, to be 
Something in the city.

In society to show I'd peen pefore, 
So I

And purdy soon vent snipping oud der door. 
Dey vas blaying- awful purty kind ov moosic; 
Dere vas valzes, bolkas, succotaches, too ; 
Der first ting vas a " solo by a

Und der nexd vas somevon's " sympathy in Q." 
Bud der besd ding dat I 
saw blayed in my lifetime 
Vas some*g dat I'm going to relate; 
It vas blaying ov a 
lettle game ov " poker," 
Yen a 
fellow blayed two pair I 
had a " shtraight." 
I 
shtayed at dat concert purty latish, 
Till der hour ov ten shtruck twelve upon der clock ; 
My key- hole it couldn't find my night- key, 
Und my house vas blaying tag around der block. 
My boarding-house keeper vas looking oud der vinder, 
It vas yust so shtill you couldn't drop a 
pin, 
Ven a 
great big man, mit shield und club like so big, 
Came and said, " he thought he'd haf to take me in." 
Now, I

Mit two bolicemen py me all der time ; 
Yen der judge said to me, " Vat's your abbelation 7" 
I 
said, " Hans von Nicholas Gilseyhausenheitn." 
He wrode dat on a 
great big sheer] ov baber, 
Und den dat kind judge to me did say: 
"Hans, you go ub to der Island ; it's so bleasant, 
Und shtay dere yust three veeks vrom to- day." 
Und I

Sometimes a

Will dare to make some rude remark,

With, " What cheer, Capting Cuff?"

Capting Cuff, Capting Cutl; he ain't worth half a

SWEET MAGNOLIAS. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by " Les Grotesques Ee-
eentrique," HALLy and W EST. 
IN 
a 
cosy little cabin clown in Georgia, 
"Where the cotton flowers blossom fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely little girl 
Who is my heart's delight, 
And at night -when little stars were peeping, 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked in happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love. 
CHORUS. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (
Syn.) 
flow I 
love their sweet perfume, (
Sym.) 
While -walking through the scented groves of orange, 
'Neath the calm and silvery light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Now I've wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That clear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back, 
As through the world I 
roam. 
There I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton, 
As they glisten 'neath the calmly shining moon ; 
There's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. eta. 
FALSE ALBERTINA. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
While in a 
situation, 
She lived head cook at a 
large hotel, 
Near Shoreditch Railway Station, 
She vowed she loved me faithfully 
And that she would be mine, oh, 
And agreed with me to share her fate. 
I 
thought that very fine, oh. 
But she ran away with a 
Horse-guard Blue, 
I 
wish I 
ne'er had seen her, 
For I'm weeping and I'm willing, and don't know what to 
do, 
For I've lost my Albertina. 
I 
bought her fine dresses and 
New bonnets shawl and laces, 
I 
treated her to Epsom Downs, 
To see the Derby Races. 
'Twas there she saw this Horse-guard Blue, 
Who asked her to take wine, oh, 
Then treated her to the Grand Stand, 
A wretched fate was mine, oh. 
But she ran away, &e. 
I 
began to see she slighted me, 
So I 
thought I'd go one morning, 
To her and have it all explained, 
But from me take a 
warning. 
For there upon the doorstep 
My rival he was standing, 
I 
flew into a 
dreadful rage, 
And satisfaction was dem an d 
ing 
But she ran away, &e. 
My hat he then smashed o'er my eyes, 
And banged me left and right, sirs, 
A Bobby hard up for a 
job, 
He collared me for the night, sirs, 
There may p'haps be some girl unwed, 
Who's lost her false young lover, 
And if she'll have me in his stead, 
We may console each other. 
But she ran away, cto. 
MERELY A MATTER OF TIME. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Or you listen to me I 
viii sing you a 
song, 
Dot is, if I 
have your consent, 
Und yen I 
get drough, I 
hope you vu say 
Dot every word is veil meant; 
Dey talk aboud building de East River Bridge, 
Und say—yen it's done—'twill be fine; 
It vill be completed in vone hundred years— 
It's merely a 
matter of time. 
I've travelled on railvays a 
good deal of late, 
But strange to say I'm still alive, 
For a 
wonder, de engineers vere not drunk, 
Dere engines vere able to drive; 
But some day or oder we'll have a 
crash, 
An accident on some big line; 
It viii come yen ye least expect of a 
smash— 
It's merely a 
matter of time. 
Dere vonce vos a

Could make lots of money each day, 
But de companies soon put an end to their game, 
Dey saw dot it never would pay; 
Dey've got a

Vich keebs dem from stealing a

But de drivers yin find how to beat it again-..

BABY'S GOT A TOOTH. 
COMIC SONG Fon A 
LADY OR GENTLEMAN. 
Words and Music by rtoLLIN H OWARD. 
The Music of this song is published by FREDERICK .
13LumE, 27 Union 
Square, New York. 
Price 33 cents. 
Copyright, 1873, by FREDERICK BLUME. 
WELL, there, I'm so delighted 
I 
don't know what to do, 
I 
feel so awful proud, boys, 
Now tell me. wouldn't you ? 
When married but a 
twelvemonth, 
Yes, to my heartfelt joy, 
Our union it was blest 
With a 
bouncing little boy. 
SPOKEIN.—I 
was delighted at hearing one day—, 
chor,u.s. 
Dada! ( Mamma) come see! 
Well, I 
declare! 
Baby's got a 
tooth! did you ever I 
Well, there ! trait ! 
1'11 strike you ! 
Pray share my joy, 
What is more delightful 
Than a 
first tooth in one's boy 7 
Yes, I 
was sitting smoking ( sewing), 
Was reading " Tweed " had gone; 
Wonder'd if he'd meet Genet, 
If Connor felt forlorn ; 
When to my oreat surprise a 
shout 
Rang shrilly in my ear, 
Our baby's got a tooth, dada! (mamma) 
Come kiss the little dear. 
SPOREN.—Who could resist it 
Kiss it I Of course I 
did, 
over and over again 
Nurse says its the picture of its dada 
(
1) 
BABY'S GOT A TOOTH.—Concluded. 
(mamma), of course it is! 
Well, it's no use talking ; all I 
can 
think of is— 
Dada (mamma), come, etc. 
Now maybe you will not believe 
how happy I 
did feel; 
That day I 
(
dear) lost sonic thousands, 
But then I 
didn't squeal; 
My mind was occupied that day 
With only one idea, 
'Twas baby's got a 
tooth—oh ! joy! 
The precious little dear 
SPOIKtN.—It's true I 
had to walk the floor with it half the 
night, and heat the paragoric over the gas, and nearly froze; 
but then imagine a 
father's (mother's) joy as he (she) thought 
of— 
Dada (mamma), come see, eta. 
I'd let it bite my finger, 
And then ' twould chew my thumb; 
It seemed to please it really, 
With joy I 
was quite dumb. 
The day ' twas born I 
felt so glad— 
'Twas nothing unto this ! 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, I 
know, 
Excuse a 
father's ( mother's) bliss. 
SPOKEN.—Why, really I 
had to avoid all my intimate acquain-
tances that day, for I 
felt so happy that I'd have given my 
last cent away I

I

" 
Oh I

Well, then, you can imagine my ecstasy, 
when I

GIVE ME A GRIP OF YOUR HAND. 
DEDICATED TO THE CRAFT. 
Words by H. PETTITT. 
Sung by G. H. DIACDERMOTT. 
THERE' 5 
a 
language in the eyes which has 
For lovers woncrrous powers, 
And poets say there's language in 
The stars and in the flow'rs ; 
But there's another language too, 
Which all can understand ; 
And its words of friendship, trust, and love, 
Are told in the " grip of the hand I" 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
grip of your hand, my friend, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand; 
As one man to another, 
As a 
friend, and as a 
brother, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
I'd say to him who bravely works, 
Despising praise or blame; 
And strives by earnest, honest means 
To win his way to fame ;. 
To patriots, and to statesmen too, 
Who work for their native land, 
And not for pension nor for place, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to the poor and humble man, 
Who earns his daily bread, 
Who loves his home and strives to keep 
His wife and children fed, 
Who learns in self-denial's school, 
Temptation to withstand, 
And like a 
man his duty does, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to every honest heart, 
To each good man and true; 
I'd say to every Yankee tar, 
To every life-boat's crew ; 
To the soldier—to the doctor, who 
By a 
poor man's bed will stand, 
Without reward, his pain to soothe, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand! 
Then give me a 
grip, etc.

OF 
all the troublesome creatures 
That cling to a 
married man's life, 
There is none with such terrible features 
As the " Ma" of your own little wife. 
Her head is filled with suaffestions 
For the good of connubial bliss, 
She'll kill you outright with her questions, 
Take my advice just in this. 
CHORITS. 
Don't marry your mother-in-law, 
Keep out of the reach of her paw, 
You had better be dead 
With a 
slab at your head, 
Than to marry your mother-in-law! 
Should your home e'er seem lonely and dreary, 
Your wife will then send for her sure, 
" 
It's so nice for Ma to come, Charley," 
Says your darling ; you must it endure. 
And if your dear wife prove deficient 
In matters known to womankind, 
Her mother will post her in all things, 
And drive you \
veil out of your mind. 
Don't marry, etc. 
She'll keep you all day in hot water, 
And worry you almost to death, 
Till you wish in your heart that her daughter 
And herself had never drawn breath ! 
She'll make your much hoped for Elysium 
A 
desert of unending strife, 
So keep these few words in your vision, 
When you take to yourself a: young wife. 
Don't marry, etc.

I'm always happy, gay and free, 
My heart's as light as air; 
It's brimming o'er with joy and love 
For a 
maiden fair, 
With flashing eyes and teeth like pearl, 
And lips of rosy hue. 
She is, compared with other girls, 
A 
diamond, tried and true; 
I 
love her, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I

My Darling Isabel.

My darling Isabel, 
The one I 
love so well, (Sym.) 
The fairest flower that ever grew 
In a

For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I 
go my love to see, 
Down by the little rustic gate, 
She's waiting there for me; 
I 
take liar arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
Beneath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and I 
do stray. 
I 
love her, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell.

WILL A MONKEY CLIMB A TREE ? 
Written and composed by Jonx REED, and sung by Gus W ILLIA.Ica. 
W HILST walking out the other night a 
girl I 
chanced to meet, 
A 
very simple looking lass, as I 
thought, in the street; 
She had a 
lovely head of hair, a 
dark and rolling eye ; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd walk with me, and this was her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Will a 
monkey climb a 
tree ? will a 
fish swim in the sea ? 
Will a 
lawyer take his fee ? a 
Jew his money lose ? 
Will a 
hackman take his fare ? will a 
barber cut your hair 
If they say no, than, dear sir, you I 
will refuse. 
I 
thought her very witty, so I 
to her did say, 
" 
Will you go to a 
music hall to pass an hour away 
Now, miss, what do you say to this ? your answer, yes or no 
Just tell me what you really think, and if you'd like to go." 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
accompany you?" she said; " why "— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
I 
hired a 
hack, drove to the ball, and paid the man his fare, 
And when we got inside the hall saw the chairman in his chair. 
I 
shook him by the hand and said, " What will you have with 
me— 
Whiskey hot or brandy cold or a 
glass of soda and B.7" 
say ? 
Oh!"— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
A 
waiter then he brought the drinks, which came to a 
dollar 
and four, 
The same time saying, " Sir, will you require any more 7" 
I 
gave him a 
ten dollar piece, he looked at me so strange; 
I 
then said to the waiter, " Will you accept the change?" 
SPOEHN.—He first looked at the gold piece and then at me, 
and quickly putting the coin in his pocket, exclaimed— 
Will a 
ravokey) ete, 
SPOKEN.--" Will I 
take a 
glass of brandy and water, did you 
HE.—As I

BECAUSE I 
am a 
countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh ?" I 
hear them shout, 
While they take long looks at we. 
SPOREN.— I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. 
I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
I 
say, " Den] it, what, does it mean 7" and echo answers, " Dem 
it, what does it mean 7" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
asked a 
man up at the Grand Central Depot if he knew where I 
could engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he, " you're 
after furnished rooms, eh ? 
Well, sir, you're in the wrong 
neighborhood ; you don't belong here. 
Well, sir, I 
suppose 
you'll keep correct by followina: your nose !" 
I 
told him he 
was very impertinent. But as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
CII011 
Young fellah, you're too fresh, 
Young fella!), you're too fresh; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocketbook, 
Though to prove it he defied me; 
I 
went, and saw a 
man of law, 
And begged his best advice; 
"My friend," said he, " you're very fresh; 
Why, you've just come off the ice." 
(1) 
51 
YOUNG FELLAH, 
YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.— I 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
man 
of law. I 
told him he must certainly be mistaken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says be, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir; you have been on the 
ice of innocence; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
He wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him ; and as I 
came down stairs I 
heard him 
say— 
Young fellah, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me ; 
" 
Why," say g 
she, " you must he loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, I'm quite sane; 
You know L 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SPOKEN.—She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't! please don't! I 
want to go home I 
please don't!" 
Nay, borne thou shqlt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou wilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jinqo ! yes, the cause 
know 
Speak out! 
fairest creature speak! 
Tell me what secret hate thou hast! 
The tale I 
hear may make inc,‘ weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But I

Wherefore thou slightest me."

"FOOLS AND THEIR 
MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED." 
Written and composed by G. W. Mair. 
Sung by G. H. MACE/ER/OTT. 
YOU'LL excuse my appearing in this shabby lot, 
But the garments I 
wear are the best I 
have got; 
They once were the fashion, as smart as e'er worn, 
2coav fit for a 
scarecrow, all tattered and torn; 
Just three years ago I 
came in for some cash, 
Like others before me—" went in" for " the dash !" 
I 
lived like a 
lord, the lot soon did spend, 
A short tho' a 
merry time—thiS is the end. 
CHORUS. 
Ah! once I 
had cash, then I 
was rash— 
Cut such a 
dash—soon went to smash; 
Now you may see I'm all up a 
tree, 
Yes, fools and their money's soon parted. 
I 
then used to toddle to ball-room or rout, 
If I 
now showed my nose they'd no doubt turn me out, 
And those I've befriended in sunshiny day, 
.Now give me the cut, or pass over the way; 
This hat I 
have doffed to many a 
fair maid, 
.11row the brim wouldn't stand it, of the roof I'm afraid, 
And these gloves, ahem! Dent's best, once fit for a 
don, 
Now there's no hid about '
em, I 
can scarce keep 'em on. 
Yes, once I 
had, etc. 
I'd a 
gold-headed cane which I'd—aw—flourish about, 
But it's some time ago since that went—up the spout; 
An eye-glass which an air of importance would lend, 
Long ago I—for safety left that with a 
friend! 
"FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED."—Concluded. 
In a 
hansom I'd then travel thro' many a 
saeet, 
.iVoto I 
tramp it not handsome about my poor feet ; 
These boots once such a 
fit, of the best patent leather, 
They scarce now can body and sole keep together. 
Ah, once -I 
had, etc. 
This sleeve still for me possesses a 
charm, 
When I 
think of the darlings I've had on my arm 
Yes, this coat it could tell a 
good tale I 
believe, 
But one tail I 
find's given notice to leave ; 
The wind thro' my Syde4nhams often will steal, 
And nothing but holes in their pockets I 
feel ; 
They've clung to me well, so I'll still hold them dear, 
Tho' to- day I 
discovered a 
rent—in the rear! 
Ali, once I 
had, etc 
And as for the garment I 
wear next my skin, 
To be severity with that, after years would be sin ; 
I 
could once " sport my linen " so spotlessly white, 
But vow I 
am thinking it's best out of sight ! 
So, boys, should some -cash ever come in your way, 
Stich to it in case of the rainy day ; 
Take care of yourself and don't be too free, 
Or some morning you'll find yourself right up a 
tree. 
el1011US. 
When you have cash, never be rash, 
Don't cut a 
dash, or you'll go to smash; 
Then, just like me, you'll be all up a 
tree, 
If you and your money's once parted.

Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A 
change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person should never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Merlin's Health 
Granules. Why 'I Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Grannies, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man, 
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT AILS NE!" 
How often do we hear this remark. A 
man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief—all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health-lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This iz precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

diseases which the disordered liver provokes and 
produces. 
In malarial districts, where biliousness is 
most prevalent and most to be dreaded, "M ERLIN'S 
HEALTH GRANULES" will prove a great saving of 
health and money, as their timely use will avert attacks 
of Bilious Fever and Malarial Fever, and will so fortify 
the system that it will 
be unaffected by malarial 
influence.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Heath Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
lticalth Granules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Gralltik'S prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Grannies have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels— lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlia'S Ien1tii Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout_ 
WAKEFULNESS AND SOMNAMBULISM, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
ci these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No ! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep- walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

Such is the innocent and admirable corn-
position of " M ERLIN'S HEALTII GRANULES," 
that their action is most gentle and grateful, 
while at the same time thorough and search-
ing. 
They do not produce violent irritation, 
followed by increased torpidity; on the con-
trary, their action is tonic and permanent. 
The torAia'ity and loss of tone of the bowels, 
which so often occur in advanced age, will be 
remedied by these precious granules, thereby 
increasing health and strength, and _prolong--

NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, 
black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simpl,r

"COME AND LET US REASON TOGETIIER. 99 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool ; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave ; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction lie learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the bead ; but it is always the bowels ho 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of di;" _ition. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Iller:in's “ ea:th Granules. Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
