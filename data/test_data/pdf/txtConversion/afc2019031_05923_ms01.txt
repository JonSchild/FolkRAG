Interview 
[00:00] 
Sarah Filkins: This is Sarah Filkins interviewing Ann Beha, FAIA, in Boston, Massachusetts at 
Ann Beha Architects on Wednesday, November 6, 2019.  Good afternoon, Ann. 
Ann Beha: 
Good afternoon, Sarah. 
SF: 
Thank you for agreeing to share your story as part of the Library of Congress Occupation 
Folklife Project.  So for them to be able to access, I need your year—if you could just say your 
name and your year of birth. 
AB: 
Sure, Ann Beha and I was born in 1950. 
SF: 
Okay, thank you.  So what are your current job responsibilities and your position? 
AB: 
Well I am a design principal at Anne Beha Architects [ABA].  We have a fifty person 
office and my job is to develop a collection of projects that are under my wing and to work 
constructively with our teams at ABA and our clients and the other professional contributors to 
the project—engineers, landscape architects, etcetera.  I’m really the kind of home base for the 
whole project’s concept, for its aspects of service to the client and for the delivery of the project.  
And it could be a planning project or it could be an actual full design services through 
furnishings and everything else project.  And I have a portfolio of projects I’m working on right 
now that range from master plans to full design services and construction. 
SF: 
What are some of those projects? 
AB: 
Well, on the master planning end they range from rather large scale master plans that 
we’ve just recently completed for the Smithsonian for its museums, two of its museums, to more 
focused master plans.  I’m doing one for the Glimmerglass opera festival in upstate New York—
all of their 27 buildings and their performing arts programs and their facilities’ needs are under 
our direction.  We’re assessing them and finding out what they need to do for the future. 
Farnsworth Art Museum would be another good example up in Rockland, [Maine] where we’re 
doing a master plan for that small regional museum’s future. And then some larger scale projects 
would include the US Embassy in Athens [Greece] which is in construction now and the US 
Embassy in Manila [Philippines] which is a master plan first, prior to becoming a project where 
we design the full embassy and see it through its build-out. 
SF: 
Well, congratulations. 
AB: 
Thank you

SF: 
Tell us about growing up and when you first became aware of architecture or the built 
environment.   
AB: 
Oh well, I grew up in the city, in New York City and I was a kid living in a very urban 
environment with a lot of architecture around me.  In the area of the city I lived in, in the East 
40s during my time there our block was surrounded by high-rise office buildings where small 
tenements had been, and brownstones had been.  The United Nations Building complex was 
constructed down on the East River so that became our family’s park for the kids, because they 
had a beautiful park on the river.  So contextually, I lived in a nineteenth century row house but I 
was surrounded constantly by this kind of changing—changing aspects of New York City and all 
of its new buildings so they even included a Les Cass building across the street from my house 
which I loved to watch because it was made of glass block and it’s still there.  So it’s kind of a 
setting which exposed me to an intensity of architecture and certainly an intensity of kind of 
urban issues.  So that’s—that’s how I grew up.  Then you asked about how I get into architecture. 
SF: 
Did you know any architects? 
AB: 
No, I didn’t know any architects.  My Dad was moving into a large SOM [Skidmore 
Owings & Merrill] building and he had an architect for his office and that’s the only architect I 
ever met.  But when I was in college I started to—I was a history major and I began to look at  
the history of towns and cities.  And I started to write an undergraduate thesis in my junior year I 
think, on Salem, Massachusetts which had been a maritime capital of the state with, of course, 
Gloucester and the whole Cape Ann region and its urban fabric or if you say sort of village and 
urban fabric spanned 
[05:00] 
all the way from the witch trials in the eighteenth century, or even before the simple Colonial 
encampments and settings there, right through to a period of great prosperity in the nineteenth 
century when it was a shipbuilding and trading capital and was part of the China trade.  And at 
that time Samuel McIntire, a housewright and carpenter began to build these federal revival 
buildings that drew their inspiration of course, from many classical principles but were made of 
more local and regional materials.  And those are large out-scaled houses that had outbuildings 
and grounds and landscape but still a very urban flavor.  So for some reason I got going on the 
history of New England and these towns like, or cities, like Salem and how they’d been in the 
nineteenth century.  And I got very hooked on the idea of the evolution of urban settings and 
what it meant to the community and what it meant to architecture and how architecture created 
identity for those cities.  And when I was at Wellesley [Wellesley College] there was a program 
where you could cross register at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and MIT had a 
program in urban history. So I found out about that and I began to be a cross registered student at 
MIT where urban history and modern art and, if you will sort of urban planning, were 
investigated in very innovative ways, far more innovative than the way the canon of art history 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
5
might be taught in a classic liberal arts college. And I started to take those kinds of courses so I 
took an introduction to urban planning, I took the history of Paris—that was a really fun course
—I took other kinds of architectural history courses there and modern art, contemporary art.  
And all of those experiences were experiences where, as I say, innovation and the kind of 
exploration of new ideas were very present. So after taking some urban history and urban 
planning I met with an advisor at MIT and the advisor suggested that I might try a studio.  And 
by then I was in my junior or senior year, I guess I was in my senior year in college, and I started 
to take a design studio since MIT has an undergraduate program in architecture as well very 
robust series of graduate programs. And I took that studio and, I must say, I found it unbelievably 
grueling and at the same time very exciting.  So by the spring of my senior year I was in the 
game and I was applying to architecture schools. 
SF: 
Has mentorship played a role in at any point along your education?  Was there someone? 
AB: 
Now there are very specific mentoring programs and there’s more description and flesh 
on the bone about what mentoring is. I think that’s really good. Mentoring needs to be defined. It 
needs to be something that’s very accessible,  and it needs to have a road path to it where 
students can really explore their potential and understand where to go with it.  I think there’s, I 
guess, more luck—more luck than structure in the way things happened for me but I think 
faculty at Wellesley and at MIT were not mentors, but you had to have the initiative to see them 
and ask them for their counsel but once you got up your nerve to do that these were people who 
were dedicated to creating the next generation of thinkers. And that’s why they were where they 
were. That’s why they were at these incredibly eminent schools because they were pushing the 
boundaries and for them the boundary included a more inclusive design community, so women 
and minorities, and it included more, I think more inclusive ways of thinking about architecture 
and planning, so history mattered.  Contextual design and historic preservation were words that 
they understood and they saw and I saw the relationship between what MIT was doing in 
teaching urban—urban planning and also materials science, materials technology, building 
technology.  I saw the relationship between those initiatives and the work of preservationists as  
[10:00] 
well as architects.  So and they—that’s the kind of thing which is, that’s incredibly MIT, that you 
basically would build your own education out of your interest areas and the bridges that you 
think are possible between where your heart and head are and where the kind of canon of 
academic investigation is.  
SF: 
So MIT was very progressive in terms of historic preservation and the urban and its role 
in urban… 
AB:   MIT has never granted a historic preservation degree and my personal theory on why that 
is, is because they think that anybody whose educated enough in architecture and planning ought 
to understand the importance of the evolution of our cities and towns.  And preservation is just a 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
6
natural way of looking at how we evolved and how we are gonna to take our evolution into the 
future.  I mean that’s science too, that methodology is not confined to architecture, that’s a 
methodology about gathering the history of a discipline and understanding how to take that 
history into the future. 
SF: 
So you then applied to graduate school at MIT  
  
AB: 
Yeah I stayed at MIT. 
SF: 
and you completed a masters of architecture? 
AB: 
A masters of architecture.  Yeah, I stayed at MIT for three years after that.  And then I 
worked at MIT for two years.  
SF: 
You were doing research on…   
AB: 
Building codes, yeah, very exciting.  I was, I was doing two things, one—there were 
really three things I was doing after I left, not two.  One was I was working on a number of 
community based projects as a volunteer or as a designer because I had developed when I was at 
MIT, with another student,  a services based student organization that offered design students to 
community groups who needed it.  So that was something that I had developed at MIT for a 
couple of years and was part of.  And out of that I got very interested in grass-roots community 
needs in their cities and settings whether it was housing or religious buildings or open space or 
whatever.  And so when I left MIT, when I graduated, I kept on with that.  I was always kind of 
volunteering or showing up at these things.  And then I also was working as an administrator in 
the Department of Architecture for a Dutch architect who came from Holland to be the new head 
of the department and wanted to have a former student to be his kind of, if you will—not mentor, 
but somebody who had their feet on the ground and knew where all the bodies were buried in the 
department.  And I had been an activist student at MIT.  I was much too involved in everything.  
So John Habraken, his name is, he’s still living outside Amsterdam asked me to come on to be 
his assistant.  So I was his assistant for two years and John was a research architect who had a 
very distinguished academic career in Eindhoven, their technical university in Amsterdam, or 
sorry, in Holland and then had a very distinguished career at MIT on housing and systems.  So he 
was doing a lot of work on regulatory issues, international regulatory issues that were shaping or 
not shaping or even I’d say holding back innovation in building systems.  And I got very 
interested in what he was doing and saw its relationship to also the way that building codes were 
holding back the preservation of historic buildings, forcing owners to take out grand stairs 
because they didn’t comply with fire ratings, you know, dealing with prescriptive codes about 
how wide a hallway would be or how many inches a stair tread could be, so things were being 
scraped out of historic buildings in Boston at that time, this was in the mid 70s, on the basis of 
compliance with prescriptive building codes.  So the National Bureau of Standards in 
Washington had a group that was studying regulatory issues, whether they were fire regulatory 
issues or building regulatory issues and looking for ways to create what we call performance 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
7
based regulations rather than prescriptive regulations.  And without getting into all that, I joined 
that team at MIT that was looking at that.  So my third year at MIT, I was working on that 
research with John. 
  
SF: 
And what were your professional goals at that point?  What was your vision for where 
you wanted to go? 
AB: 
Well, you know I think that when you are first out of school 
[15:00] 
you are sort of taking everything you can.  I was also working for a consulting group that was 
looking at a very unusual issue that had started in England and came to the United States because 
it became such a prevalent problem, and still is a problem.  And that is the issue of landmark 
religious buildings—religious buildings be they churches, or temples, or cathedrals, or village 
chapels that didn’t have a—didn’t have congregations anymore because of migration—were 
overly, well in great need of repair and renovation, didn’t have much relevance anymore to the 
communities in which they were sited and were being left to what we then called ‘benign 
neglect’ because there simply was nobody to shepherd or steward the building’s futures.  So a 
small research group in Cambridge  [Massachusetts] was established and I think funded by NEA 
[National Endowment for the Arts] or NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] to look at 
that issue in the United States.  And they chose some  model cities and model congregations to 
study and I had written my thesis on that kind of topic at MIT and on preservation and urban 
change and so I was a good fit for them they thought and I joined their team. So I was doing a lot 
of things at once. And so in terms of what I thought the future was, I was having a really 
interesting time just kind of being everywhere, and getting to know the city in a different way, 
getting to understand who was making decisions about things, and kind of understanding the 
system of how—how preservation and community activism and research all came together. 
SF: 
Did you then start your practice after your two years at MIT? 
AB: 
I was at MIT about three, but yeah.  For—for—talk about without a parachute. When I 
was working in the communities I was hired by one church to help them figure out how to do 
their restoration and how to activate their community spaces.  They had these big parish hall 
buildings that weren’t used.  So I started to consult with them and I was consulting individually.  
And then of course they told another church about me, and then another church told another 
church about me, and the next thing I knew I had this little portfolio of urban landmarks that I 
was working with.  And from there it became a little more secular because I was working a great 
deal in Cambridge and sometimes in Boston and there weren’t a lot of other design professionals 
who had the ability to write a National Register Nomination [National Park Service National 
Register of Historic Places] or to analyze the brick facade of a building, or call a structural 
engineer about horizontal cracking or step cracking and all that stuff.  So I started to do more 
training in materials technology and attend courses and seminars in masonry and other kinds of 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
8
historic materials or what they call archaic materials and sort of become a better—better 
understand how one repaired wood windows, steel windows, what the uses of epoxies were, how 
to deal with timber framing, what goes on when you have efflorescence on masonry.  What is the 
difference between different kinds of stone and how are they applied to buildings?  All of that 
had started at MIT but I was still very interested in that and through a variety of other interesting 
groups like there was a group in New York called Restore and there was a guy at the Museum of 
Natural History, Sydney Horenstein, he used to give these tours of New York called “The Fossils 
of 42d Street” that were all about the buildings when they were built, what kind of stone they 
were made out of.  He gave those kind of seminars.  You could go to his lectures in New York 
and there were many people like the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities 
here in Boston had some really good research scientists like Norman Weiss and Morgan 
[Phillips]—I’ve got to remember his last name—and they were constantly giving afternoon 
seminars or evening seminars on these issues.  So you know when you joined these, these people 
were not a lot older than me, they were pretty close in age, and the thing that fueled them was 
just this burning curiosity for how we could make technology more accessible to historic 
buildings and repair them at a reasonable cost to their users, so many of whom, were nonprofit 
groups.  They were not groups that had taken on buildings for the sake  
[20:00] 
of owning the buildings.  They were groups that were in buildings that needed this kind of work 
and they had different missions.  Their mission wasn’t architecture.  Their mission was teaching 
music like the New England Conservatory or trying to advance dance which would be a group 
that would have been in an old church.  There were all kinds of intentions they had and 
architecture was the last thing on their minds but the buildings were big challenges for them, 
very big money pits, and very big concerns.  So we were all trying to tackle those issues. 
SF: 
And so was the Association for Preservation Technology a resource for you? 
AB: 
Yes, APT that’s absolutely right.  I can’t name the number of groups but I guess I became 
kind of a conference hound and APT was very important. ICOMOS [International Council on 
Monuments and Sites] was important, now Historic New England was important. The National 
Trust for Historic Preservation was doing more about this—they were holding excellent annual 
conferences on these issues.  And at these meetings you would meet not only other technical 
people like myself but also many people who were trying through urban policy or advocacy to 
bring their landmarks to the attention of regulators and politicians so that they had what I would 
call some viability, as either grantees through a national grant program or state grant programs or 
some other kind of way of partnering with institutions to secure their future.  It was a very vital 
time in making policy. 
SF: 
But you were one of the real innovators at that time in terms of recognizing the value of 
historic buildings, not just preserving them as a museum. But, I love what you say, “expanded 
the dialogue between tradition and innovation”. 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019

AB: 
Yeah, well thanks for the compliment.  I don’t know that I…I mean, I wasn’t alone that’s 
for sure  and there were people before me just look at Williamsburg and other places like that.  I 
think one of the things I began to realize about historic resources is that we had a very narrow 
framework for what we considered to be historic so I started to expand my volunteer activities 
and paid activities to underserved areas of the city like Roxbury [Boston] and to places where 
there weren’t a lot of resources for preserving historic buildings.  But boy was there a history.   
You know the…inevitably we re-visit the things that generations before us did and say, “Well it 
wasn’t enough this, that or the next thing”.  I think that the tradition of preservation, by the 
1970s, was a relatively patrician kind of tradition and it was important to view the United States 
and our architectural heritage as inclusively as possible.  And it still wasn’t inclusive enough but 
there were places where no one had considered the role of vernacular architecture or the 
architecture of the everyday and those are places where now those buildings have pride of place.  
So getting the ball rolling was exciting. 
SF: 
How about your registration exam? 
AB: 
Ah ha ha—I—I—I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.  So one of 
the things that—you asked about mentors, so I was extremely lucky.   In my work I was able to 
call myself a preservation consultant during those years cause I didn’t have a license and the 
nature of licensing was similarly vigorous then, as it is now, but what I did have is a loose 
relationship with Shepley Bulfinch and the senior partner there Hugh Shepley and the associate 
in charge of one of the big preservation jobs in Boston didn’t have someone on their staff who 
they felt was well enough trained to work with Dan Coolidge who was their project senior 
associate and Dan didn’t have somebody within the firm he could just turn to and say, “Look, can 
you go out and meet and talk about these issues?”  They had great people but they hadn’t really 
brought along that generation. They viewed it as a really arcane specialty so I found out that they 
had gotten this big job and I called them up 
[25:00] 
and said, “I hear you got Old South Church restoration and you know, I would really like to help 
on that.”  And Hugh Shepley said,”Come on in.”  So I went in and I worked for Danny for three 
years but not as a full time employee.  There was a very bad economy then, so they paid me as a 
consultant.  So when it came time to get registered I had enough hours through Shepley Bulfinch 
that I could do it and then I also had something else which was I became an owner’s rep for a 
community group in Cambridge and I helped them get their building built by representing the 
owner’s side of the table which was absolutely fascinating.  And the architecture firm that was, 
actually—the guy who was on the board of that organization ran a big firm in Cambridge—so he 
was willing to take the time I was putting into this owner’s rep position and also help me with 
my registration.  So I built up my hours and essentially I worked for two firms at parallel times to 
just kind of get two completely different experiences.  And then took the exam and you know 
dealt with the exams (laughs) more than once but anyway got registered, got licensed. 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019

SF: 
And then after that you felt comfortable opening your own firm? 
AB: 
Well, I was already working and had several employees. So we were just preservation 
consultants and one of the people I had was a history major at Brown and she’s now an architect 
in California.  She was right out go school.  Another person, I think had worked for the National 
Trust for a year or two and then relocated to Boston, and she was a great researcher.  She was 
again, a liberal arts major and so the three of us would do this kind of work.  We would write 
National Register nominations and grant applications for mass historic grants and just do a lot of 
the kind of technical work but also the support work to help clients get into the game of funding 
and getting money for their work. But we weren’t providing documents and architectural 
drawings and services. 
SF: 
So what were some of your early projects where you actually were providing 
architectural documents?  
AB: 
Oh God, well you know, when you first start.  I had a lot of community work so I 
continued to do quite a lot of work for churches and synagogues and other religious 
organizations.  I don’t even remember—I worked on an early project, two early projects for the 
New England Conservatory of Music restoring and renewing some of their spaces, even to the 
point of just doing paint colors and making sure that they had new rugs and that kind of thing in 
their, in their historic building.  I did some residential work for sure, quite a few projects that 
were eighteenth and nineteenth century houses that were being renovated and then some small 
school work.  It was all over the place. Yeah, just anything you could get. I mean, that’s 
something that hasn’t changed.  You, you, you get out there and you just—anything  you can get. 
SF: 
So you were building up your staff at this time, were you  
AB: 
Yeah 
SF: 
were you conscious of a particular kind of culture that you wanted to create among 
your… 
AB: 
I was working out of my house.  I was working on of the top floor of our little row house 
in Boston and you know the top floor was—it was before we had kids, so the top floor—I  had 
three or four people coming in each day and we were producing documents and we were 
overseeing construction and I hired some people who had some more experience than me.  That 
was helpful—smart. (laughs) Higher up. Yeah, yeah we were producing work. Yeah, we were 
working in Lawrence and Andover.  A lot of times people would find us because they would call 
organizations like the Mass [Massachusetts] Historic Commission or the Society for the 
Preservation of New England Antiquities and they would say to their technical people, ”You 
know look, we have this problem with our house and we don’t know what kind of addition to put 
on it, “and those organizations couldn’t just give them one name but they would give them a 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
11
series of names. They’d say, “Well these are people who are known to us. They have been to 
some of our seminars.  You are on your own but you might want to call them.”  And that’s how 
the phones rang.  And then I spoke at conferences.  There always were panels where people were 
debating issues.  And I did a lot of volunteer work and I continue to believe that’s really 
important.  Get involved in your community.  When they say, “Who can help?” Raise your hand 
because you’re going to learn more doing that than maybe anything because you learn about 
people and what they need  
[30:00] 
and where they feel stopped by their buildings.  And it’s really—still is fascinating to do that.  I 
mean go to a zoning board hearing or go to a design review committee meeting and you go like, 
“Wow, there’s a lot of stuff that architecture doesn’t do for people and there’s a lot of stuff it does 
do and it’s good to refresh on what people think.”  
SF: 
Did you have a project that presented particular challenges and maybe some things you 
learned from that. 
AB: 
in the early years? 
SF: 
Well, anytime, I guess.  
  
AB: 
Oh that’s a great question. It’s just global. There are projects that present challenges all 
the time.  It’s like pop flies, they just come at you and your glove is up.  Just catch em.  And ask 
for help because you can’t solve all of them.  But mostly, they mostly get solved when you have 
good technical resources around you and you have a really clear design vision—that’s number 
one.   And the third is when you have an owner that’s willing to team up with you and look at the 
problem and say,”Okay what are we all—and a construction manager—what are we all going to 
do together.” It’s not so good to have everybody in each corner of the ring.  You want to get out 
there together.  Construction is so challenging.  And older buildings have these secrets that they 
just kill you with.  
SF: 
and that you keep finding.  
  
AB: 
Yeah I mean you can do—you can learn a lot about preemptive investigation.  And you 
know it sort of goes back to your training where you know that there’s research, there’s 
investigation, there’s analysis of a building before you touch it but even with all that there are 
bound to be things.  And I’m—I’m sort of  a mother hen with clients if they haven’t been through 
that before.  And I really value the research and I try to help them understand how important it is. 
But I also try to prepare them for the likelihood that it isn’t going to go smoothly every day.  And 
they need to hold a contingency that’s adequate and they need to be prepared for the surprises. 
And they need a contractor who’s been down that road.  They can’t use somebody who doesn’t 
have any chops in working with existing buildings.  So we do a lot of new buildings now too and 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
12
I’d still say, you need a contractor whose been down that road. You need the right fit —right 
architect, right owner, right contractor.  Then you can do good things. 
SF: 
How about some of your favorite projects and maybe some opportunities that came out of 
that that you didn’t anticipate.  
AB: 
Well you know you always love the projects where you grow and where the client gives 
you a lot of leeway.  And you know just in the recent past, I didn’t go way back, because I’ve 
been working for 40 years now, I didn’t go way back in my memories of projects I loved the 
most.  But I loved doing Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory because I could see what 
an incredible difference that performance space was going to make to people who used it, to the 
students, and it was just thrilling, absolutely thrilling, to see that space brought back to life and 
be made accessible to disabled, have integrated HVAC that nobody can even notice.  There were 
some subtleties in there and it was really worth sweating bullets about that. That was a great 
project.  And I have loved the University of Chicago project which is more recent but you know 
it got so much appreciation.  And the thing I, you know, the university architect who is a great 
guy was working with some of the best architects in the country, if not in the world, at the time 
we were doing that job and I kept wondering why he never had a lot of time to review our 
design.  I was like telling the project manager, “It’s like we don’t see enough of him and I’m 
worried that he doesn’t come to meetings and spend a long time”.  And finally the project 
manager turned to me and said, ”Don’t you get it, he knows—he knows you know what you’re 
doing.  He just wants you to do it.”  And it’s like, oh okay, you know, that’s different.  So that 
was a lot of fun because there was a huge amount of leeway given to us about what we were 
going to do. And there was a remarkable level of support from the faculty who were super 
excited about it and a lot of fun to work with—economists are just their own community.  And I 
think the results are stunning.  And they’re really—I go back there and I go like, everybody is 
really using this building.  It’s a hub on the campus and usually the department of economics is 
[35:00] 
not where everyone goes to want to have coffee and have a first date, you know?  So it’s pretty 
cool.  I think, I loved working with the math department at MIT.  It was wonderful to get back to 
MIT.  It was wonderful to work with that community.  They are so inventive and intelligent and  
don’t ever try to pull the wool over an MIT mathematician’s eyes.  They look at the drawing and 
like in a nano second they completely understand where all the problems are.  And it was like, 
“Let me explain this to you.”  “Oh you don’t need to.” “Oh, great.”  I was bested many times.  I 
think the results of that are more, design wise, I felt the results of that are more in the family of 
it’s what MIT can do with their buildings.  They want a certain MIT solution.  I felt that the work 
at Chicago was much more innovative because they didn’t know what to expect from the 
building and they were excited about these possibilities.  So it’s a very different outcome.  I 
mean, I think the math department really loves it and I’m thrilled they do.  I think it’s, it’s, it’s 
within the, if you will, it’s within the family of what MIT would do.  It’s not as—it’s great, it’s 
just not as out there as what Chicago was like—okay, let’s roll.  So those are two—those are

three projects that I loved.  But I mean, you know, a lot of them are around not just the design but 
also the relationships with people, the fun of working together with people who are really 
creative and really excited.  That’s a lot of juice in that, in our profession. 
SF: 
How about gender equity in the profession whether you are in the field doing 
construction management, working with contractors, or even in different offices that you’ve had 
experiences or with clients? 
SF: 
You know I never worked in another office really.  I had a summer job in one in England. 
I never really worked in another office so I don’t have a lot of experience about how established 
offices treated young aspiring architects who were female.  In terms of being at the table in 
construction, I was never at the table with a lot of women but it’s better.  I mean, I see more, 
which is great.  And if you work for example in planning, if you work in the Smithsonian, that 
has phenomenal—phenomenal intellectual capital in its staff and many, many women, so that’s 
really great.  And if you work in the State Department you’ll also find—so gender equity is 
hopefully improving in client groups and when it improves in client groups that’s great too.  So 
you know I think, again—it’s sort of a three legged stool. Where you don’t see it so much is in 
the construction industry. You’ll see some but I don’t think they’re making leaps and bound and I 
have a big project right now, one of the biggest academic projects I’ve ever done, and I’ve seen 
one woman, you know—and I’ve been on the job for a year.  And it’s not, and yeah, frankly if I 
was a woman I wouldn’t want to hang out with those guys.  They’re—they—they—you know, 
they’re just—it’s just a guy—it’s a guy environment.  So they have a long way to go, they have a 
long way to go in the construction industry, in my opinion.  I think both in terms of hiring but 
also just in terms of the culture of how they are together.  There’s some smaller contractors here 
in Boston.  Boston is a great city for more female representation, not so great on greater diversity 
beyond that, that’s for sure.  But in Boston the smaller contractor’s still doing big projects, they 
do a lot better.  It’s just the really big, big ones—I just—I don’t see it.  I don’t see it.  So it’s all 
over the place right now, Sarah. It’s all over the place, I don’t have any particular insights into it.  
I’m just into kind of gutting it out. 
SF: 
But you never experienced it at MIT or when you were in school? 
AB: 
Well there weren’t any women around.  So yeah, I mean you know, you couldn’t compare 
yourself to anyone because there wasn’t really anyone there. So that gave you a certain level of 
freedom because like who—there’s no model. There were some women faculty—terrific— but 
they weren’t practicing  architects by and large, they tended to be research architects.  So there 
was no strong model of a female who started her own practice.   There were a few in Boston. I’d 
say the majority of them were married to their—it was the couple kind of thing would go on a lot 
like:  Jane Thompson with Ben Thompson; the person you just met with, Doris Cole and her 
husband [Hal Goyette];  Jane Goody and Marvin Goody; there’s  
[40:00] 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019

Susie Kim and her husband—I’ve forgotten his name [Fred Koetter]. But there’s a lot of that. 
Charlie Rose and Maryann Thompson were together very much younger.  So that happens a lot.  
And Meejin Yoon and her husband merged—nope, they’re not merged—they’re different.  But 
there’s a lot of that.  But there’s also a lot more offices that have women at the helm that have no 
relationships in the company—I’m one, my colleague Catherine Truman who was here for I 
think twelve years at least, started her own firm which is fantastic and she’s a woman proprietor. 
I have a [former] partner [Pamela W. Hawkes FAIA] who has become a full professor at Penn 
now and she and her husband [T. Scott Teas] have a firm in Portland.  You know, people have 
more lives and they don’t just end with one firm.  But the gender equity thing, well, I should’t 
say thing.  Gender equity is a—is a—is a basic right.  It’s a very, very important issue.  I think 
you can take it on in your daily life in ways that are productive and at the same time, I think you 
can’t over think it.  I think you have to do it.  And I, I will tell a small story on myself and hope 
that I don’t offend anyone but I might.  There was a employee in this firm, who, she left to go to 
another firm, a bigger firm, and I think that’s going very well for her.  And she, when she left, 
she had an out—what do they call it, an exit interview (laughs).  And so I asked the person doing 
the exit interview, “How did that go? She’s such a nice person and you know, I’m sorry to lose 
her but I understand why she’s going to this big place—bigger, bigger projects”. And the woman 
who was doing the out, the out interview said, “Well you know, she said you don’t care about 
women in the field.”  She said, “Ann, doesn’t” or something like that, “she doesn’t care about 
gender equity.” And you know, I have a little bit of a tendency to use rather direct language, so 
I’ll spare you that, I said you tell her, “I have fucking lived gender equity.  You’ve got to be 
kidding!”  And she said, “Well she said you don’t talk about it a lot.”  And I said, “That’s cuz I’m 
too busy living it”. (laughs) I’m just living it. Come on!  So it’s very interesting how people 
perceive it but it was a good heads up for me that I don’t talk about it much, probably because I 
don’t have a lot of solutions to it and I feel that one of the greatest things we can do as women 
for ourselves and for everyone else is just to be as outstanding as we can and to give as much of 
ourselves as we can to our profession, in the right way.  And that after a while words are just 
words and the living of it to me is more powerful.  But it was a heads up that, you know 
apparently, this generation, understandably, they do want to talk about it.  So I was missing that 
piece and now if people ask me about it you know I am willing to talk about it  but I think that it 
is so past me at my age that it’s another generation’s—the next generation is really looking at it 
in a their own way.  They are very worried about how they are going to manage families.  They 
are very worried about their take-home pay.  These are reasonable worries.  They are worried 
about how to deal with the demands of architecture.  These are, these are still reasonable worries. 
SF: 
How did you do that? 
AB: 
Um—well, I would say, as my husband says, “If you are mad at Ann, get in line.” There’s 
probably a large community of people who will tell you all the ways in which I—didn’t do what 
I should have been doing.  So the answer is, you don’t do it all.  I didn’t do it all.  I didn’t do it 
all, all that well.  And there are lots of people and issues that if you could revisit it you’d 
probably want to do it differently.  And you know, it’s—it’s a very demanding profession.  I was, 
I said this when I got the BSA [Boston Society of Architects] Honor Award last year.  Everybody 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
15
thought I would talk about architecture.  I said, “I want to talk about the person whose in bed 
with you.  That’s what matters. Doesn’t matter if that person’s there all the time or it’s just a 
friend or whatever it is.  I am just using a term of art, a euphemism.”  But I said, “If you are not 
lucky in the people around you, you can’t do this work.  You have to be incredibly lucky in the 
people around you.  And where luck leaves off you may just have to build a community of 
people around you who understand and appreciate what you’re trying to do and enjoy it 
[45:00] 
and are willing to help support it.  And in the absence of that I should think that you’d be very 
much at 6’s or 7’s about how to get through it.”  What I’m just saying about that, I’m not sure 
that’s any different for a guy except for the obvious caregiving responsibilities one assumes.  But 
an awful lot of the men in this office are so on tap for their kids and my husband was amazing 
about that.  So I think there is a greater viability to what I’d call a fulfilled career, if there are 
lifestyles and expectations and emotional relationships that also support that.  It never overcomes 
poor salary or bad working conditions or any kind of other equitable relationship of you to your 
employer or you to your work but it is enormously helpful in managing the burdens of 
architecture to have a community of people around you who are up for it, even if they are only 
up for it 75% of the time.  And I was very lucky.  I had a husband who was psyched about it—
not an architect.  I’ve been married to him for 44 years and I’ve got two kids who, if they were in 
pain, I didn’t hear it.  I probably hear it now that they are in their thirties but you know they 
were, they kind of rolled with it.  And as one teacher said to me.  You know I said, “Well I’ve got 
to go on this business trips, my daughter’s in second grade. I’m really uptight about it.”  And she 
said, “Well, why don’t you take her?” I said, “You’re kidding.”  “No, why don’t you just take her. 
I don’t care if she’s in class. She’s really smart.”  I said, “Okay.” So she said, “Well you know, 
what you do is take some books with you and take her with you for four or five days and you 
know, wherever you’re staying, get your client to find you a babysitter.”  And I did, I took this 
seven year old—I knew I had these meetings—I took her to a convent in Kentucky that we were 
building.  I took her to a project in Florida and I took her to Indiana and the clients—I said, “I’m 
bringing my seven year old.” They said, “Well my daughter’s fourteen. Do you want her to 
babysit”?  We had a blast.  Now you can’t do that all the time.  But it was a teacher of Macie’s 
that helped me see that, you know you don’t have to be absent, you have to be, you know, you 
have roll it in and out.  So what are the times you could go and you could spend a couple of extra 
days with your kid? 
 SF: 
Did either one of your children go into architecture? 
AB: 
No. No, somebody in Macie’s carpool, she’s now 35, said to her, “Well, do you want to 
be an architect like you mother?” And she said, “Well—I don’t like to talk on the phone and I 
don’t really like airplanes too much and I don’t like being upset at people all of the time.  So I 
guess I don’t want to be an architect.”  And when that was told to me I thought, oh God, she has 
this distorted view of this.  And I was—but it was so hilarious that I just loved it and I remember 
it to this day.  You know, okay, I guess that’s what architecture’s about—the big kvetch, the big 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
16
kvetch.  Yeah. You know, I am a really, I love—I like being around people who have a sense of 
humor and I think it’s important to laugh at ourselves and know that—there’s a lot in life that 
seems pretty serious but it’s actually pretty hilarious when you think about it, it’s kinda 
ludicrous. 
SF: 
It’s all about your perspective.  Have you ever read the book, The Art of Possibility?  It’s 
by Benjamin Zander who… 
AB: 
Yeah, yeah, who’s the conductor.  Of course, he was at New England Conservatory [of 
Music] for a long time. 
SF: 
He and his wife, who was a psychologist, wrote this book… 
AB: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah—it was the sister [Angelica Zander Rudenstine], [wife] of 
the president of Harvard Neal [L.] Rudenstein.  Angelica—very cool.   
SF: 
It’s really about how you can take the same information but if you look at it from a 
different perspective and…  
AB: 
Yeah,  yeah I mean we took a lot of family vacations—that’s our biggest memories. 
Whenever there was a vacation we were on the road.  There were a lot of things we did and I 
don’t think that’s particular to architecture, I think that’s just parenting.  And so parents who are 
really busy, you know, they have to look for every way possible to be present when they’re 
needed.  But I—you know—that’s my generation, and I think that as we were talking about 
gender equity, there are issues for other people—there are issues for this generation that I’m not 
really tuned in, I’m just too old to be totally tuned in to what their concerns are. 
SF: 
Well what would you like your legacy to be? 
AB: 
Oh. That is something that’s hard to even—fathom!   Ah…Well, I would like to have left 
a couple of very good buildings that people say are as good  
[50:00] 
today as when they were built—that give people a lot of joy.  And I’d like to have been 
somebody who explored this marriage between traditional, or between cultural legacy, and 
innovation and made that not only—present in buildings and landscapes and settings but also a 
dialogue in the profession that allowed the next generation to take it to another level.  You know 
we just broke the ice, as you pointed out.  It’s really others who come along and say, “Well now 
that the ice is broken, you know let’s go fishing and see what’s out there”.  And I like the idea 
that there are continued explorations of this and if that’s a contribution I’ve made then I think 
that is very—makes me happy.  Yeah. 
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019

SF: 
It seems that it’s very difficult for many architects to understand how to create a 
contemporary building in an historic setting and that’s something you’ve done so well.  And just 
from having worked with many of them, it’s a very—just a creative, contemporary, compatible 
building in an historic site or an historic building in an urban site. 
AB: 
Yeah, one thing Sarah, I should say, is that you never do it alone.  What’s important to me 
is that the work of the team be acknowledged.  It’s not something that’s just one person—it’s a 
big thing in architecture about the star system and there’s one person, one visionary, but gosh I 
think that’s such a myth. 
SF: 
That’s great.  Where are you in your career today?  
AB: 
Well I’m feeling very excited about my work.  I have brought along another generation of 
people who run this office in an administrative way and are primary owners of the practice.  I am 
a principal here with a lot of important projects, at least they’re very important to me.  And I 
have people who work with me in studio on those projects.  What I wanted to do about three 
years ago, was to make sure that there was a sense that there was a future here for people who 
are younger than me.  So over time I started to have discussions with some of the senior, 
particularly one, senior person who is a lot younger than me, who is in his 40’s and about being 
president and he is.  And that’s Phil Chen and he has his own way of doing things.  I think he’s  
remarkable.  It’s not the way I would do it but that’s the point, right?  At the same time what’s 
great is that it’s giving me these years to practice.  And there was a long time in this practice 
where an awful lot of my time went into HR [human resource] and administration and people 
management, financials, etcetera, and my other partners Tom Hotaling and Pam Hawkes [former 
partner] and Steve Gerrard also give and gave their measure of time to those things. But frankly, 
many of them had more time for architecture and I had a little less time for architecture.  So I 
wanted to have both the next generation active and feeling like there was a place for them which 
I think they do, and also feel that I didn’t have to—I could take all the time I had and work on 
projects, which was a luxury I hadn’t had.  
  
SF: 
So design all the way through?  
AB: 
Yeah, I mean I go to the construction sites, I try to interview for the project always and  
put the work plan together and then have a lot of daily contact with the client and often with the 
contractor.  There’s always a project manager.  There’s always a group of key contributors but I 
like to be in there and I—I think it helps, I think there—it gives—and we have a very young 
office in a lot of ways, a lot of opportunity for people here who in larger offices might get stuck 
working in a more specialized area or on a just on one aspect of a project. And here you are kind 
of doing everything and that’s a big opportunity but when you do that you have to have 
somebody on the team who’s been through it a lot and can steer the ship.  So—that’s what I do. 
SF: 
Is there anything that you wish you had known  
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
[55:00] 
before you started or when you started? 
AB: 
Well, I always wish I had taken more risks.  I think that when you talk about gender 
equity or did I feel held back and that kind of thing, I think the way I felt held back is that since 
there was really no foreseeable future—like this is what you do in order to do this.  You know, 
there was no formula in particular or I didn’t know one—I didn’t do things that I think I admire
—people like Jeanne Gang for doing—which is to explore technology in a new way.  Or Liz 
Diller to sort of refine an approach that is so sophisticated but she started in by taking a lot of 
risks.  I mean, I think frankly their work has become more conservative over time as they’ve 
learned that people have only so much tolerance for innovation, sadly.  But you know, there are 
people who are more—more  eager to get out there and make riskier decisions than I was when I 
started.  On the other hand I feel, I’ve caught up pretty well.  But I think I could have done more 
on that and when I look at what I built in the early years I think that it didn’t—it didn’t take the 
risks that it might have. But I feel better now. (laughs)  
SF: 
Is there anything else you would like to add about any specific projects or any stories or 
anything that you’d like to share? 
SF: 
Well, I hadn’t really thought of any.  I think, one of the things that I really like about the 
way we describe ourselves is that we call our work, and I’m taking about all architects, a 
practice.  And it’s not a bad word and I think that this idea that you’re constantly discovering 
things and learning new things and trying new things is quite special to architecture.  I’m not 
sure that’s as true in every profession but I have really liked the idea that practice means you just 
keep practicing and there’s a certain level of resilience that’s required because inevitably you 
make mistakes.  So I like that.  I think there is an aspect of practice that is business that is very 
hard to learn if you’re not working with a big firm and I really had to learn everything about the 
business myself.  And that is, that’s—that’s time consuming and my, my the people around me,  
my accountant, my lawyer, my husband who is a businessman were exceptionably giving in 
trying to help me set up a sustainable business.  A lot of architects do not have truly sustainable 
businesses and our firm has been extremely successful.  And that’s important because you are 
taking on the lives of all the people who are in the firm and you can’t give them those kinds of 
benefits that they need if you don’t have—take a responsible attitude towards a sustainable 
business.  So that’s something I think I’m very proud of—is that we created a sustainable 
business where ABA [Ann Beha Architects] was at the top of salaries and benefits of its type of 
firm and, and that makes me feel good.  So it’s a practice, it’s a business, it’s a personal journey 
for everybody who’s here.  ABA is not the end game for every employee.  There’s a lot of 
movement from firm to firm.  I think that’s pretty healthy.  And then I guess the other thing I’ve 
realized is that when you build a building, it’s the total package.  If you say, I just want to do the 
building as a statement but you don’t care about the way people use it or how it’s furnished or 
where they’re going to sit in the sun or how they're going to get out of the rain, it’s just not the 
total package.  
Ann Beha, Interview, November 6, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
So bringing those sort of pragmatic daily concerns to your work, the concerns we all have as a 
mom or a husband or just a person who’s a user of buildings—that’s critical to me.  I don’t like 
ideas that don’t take human behavior into account.  I like ideas that welcome human behavior 
and/or acknowledge that we are all humans and we’re going to bring a Starbucks in, so please 
don’t give me a yellow  
[1:00:00] 
couch in that lounge in the school because, looks great today, and you are going to come back in 
6 months and it’s going to be just awful.  So, I like to focus on those details and I think that 
makes us be better architects—that we are in the space mentally of the users and we value their 
long-term use of the building and their needs and I think that’s—that shows in a lot of architect’s 
work.  And then in some architect’s work, oh, my goodness, it’s really, it’s just not their 
motivation, let’s just say.  They’re just in another world. It doesn’t make their building bad, it’s 
just not a building that makes my heart beat because it doesn’t take that into account. 
SF: 
One final question.  Do you think it’s the architect’s job to be the agent of change or to 
reflect change in society—that society is already exhibiting.  Is it to be out front and sort of 
leading the change or to be reflecting society? 
AB: 
At minimum both, at minimum both, I mean, and then some.  And then it’s the architect’s 
job to monitor whether or not the change is contributing.  So staying with the building and going 
back and looking at it and being self critical about whether those things you cared about and tried 
to advocate for really mattered, is the way you learn.  And sometimes I’ve gotten on my high 
horse about, “We’ve got to have this, this, this and this,” and then I go back and go, oh God, 
(laughs) and it was so expensive and they listened to me.  But mostly, you know, what you want 
to be is humble enough to self-criticize and say okay that’s why we don’t use the yellow fabric 
because it really doesn’t work.  And you need to be—you need to be humble about that.  And 
you need to know that you may have asked for change and then maybe it doesn’t matter, maybe 
you missed something, you were so focused on one thing being important that other things that 
were important—got lost in the shuffle.  So keeping your mind open is so important.  Like what 
do they care about, what’s most important, what have I done elsewhere or seen elsewhere that I 
might want to bring to them to show an example of something that might fit for them?  You 
know, you have to be a gatherer of all of these precedents and all of this other work that’s being 
done all around the world in order to show your client what might mean most to them that 
nobody’s thought of.  It can’t just all come from you.  If you put yourself in the center of it, that’s 
one source and should be a good one, but there are a lot of other contributors who you’re never 
going to meet but when you see what they cared about in their buildings, you want to be 
someone who’s got has a broad enough perspective and enough kind of a compressed ego that 
you would bring that in and say, “Look there’s some great stuff and try it on for size.” and you 
know it’s an opportunity.  But on change—yeah—we gotta—we have to reflect on what change 
means to people and make change that’s meaningful.
