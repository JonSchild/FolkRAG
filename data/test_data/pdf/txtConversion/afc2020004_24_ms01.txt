EXILE OF MEMORY 
 
Do not return,  
we were warned by one who knows things 
You will only upset the dead.  
They will emerge from the spiral of little houses 
Lined up in the furrows of marrow 
And walk the land. 
There will be no place in memory 
For what they see 
The highways, the houses, the stores of interlopers 
Perched over the blood fields 
Where the dead last stood. 
And then what, you with your words 
In the enemy’s language, 
Do you know how to make a peaceful road 
Through human memory? 
And what of angry ghosts of history? 
Then what? 
 
Don’t look back. 
 
In Sunday school we were told Lot’s wife 
Looked back and turned 
To salt. 
But her family wasn’t leaving Paradise. 
We loved our trees and waters 
And the creatures and earths and skies 
In that beloved place. 
Those beings were our companions 
Even as they fed us, cared for us. 
If I turn to salt 
It will be of petrified tears 
From the footsteps of my relatives 
As they walked west. 
 
I did not know what I would find  
 
The first night we set up our bed in the empty room 
Of our condo above the Tennessee River 
They’d heard we were coming 
Those who continued to keep the land 
Despite the imposition of newcomers 
And the forced exile of our relatives.  
 
All night, they welcomed us 
All night, the stomp dancers 
All night, the shell shakers  
All night circle after circle made a spiral 
To the Milky Way  
 
We are still in mourning. 
 
The children were stolen from these beloved lands by the government. 
Their hair was cut, their toys and handmade clothes ripped 
From them. They were bathed in pesticides 
And now clean, given prayers in a foreign language to recite 
As they were lined up to sleep alone in their army-issued cages. 
 
Grief is killing us. Anger tormenting us. Sadness eating us with disease. 
Our young women are stolen, raped and murdered.  
Our young men are killed by the police, or killing themselves and each other. 
 
This is a warning: 
Heroin is a fool companion offering freedom from the gauntlet of history. 
Meth speeds you past it.  
Alcohol, elixir of false bravado, will take you over the edge of it.  
Enough chemicals and processed craving  
And you can’t push away from the table. 
 
If we pay enough, maybe we can buy ourselves back.  
 
We used to crowd the bar for Tuesday ten-cent beer night. 
It was the Indian, poetry, biker and student bar 
In that university and military base town. 
Trays packed with small cups of beer passed non-stop 
Over the counter all night.  
We brought all of our thirsty dreams there  
Gambled with them at the pool table, all night. 
Danced with them and each other on the blood-stained dance floor  
To jukebox songs fed by dimes and quarters, all night. 
And by 2 A.M. we staggered out 
To the world made by Puritan dreaming 
No place for Indians, poets or any others who would  
Ride the wild winds for dangerous knowledge. 
 
All night.  
 
Here there is a singing tree.  
It sings of the history of the trees here. 
It sings of Monahwee who stood with his warrior friends 
On the overlook staring into the new town erected  
By illegal residents.  
It sings of the Civil War camp, the bloodied 
The self-righteous, and the forsaken. 
It sings of atomic power and the rise 
Of banks whose spires mark  
The worship places. 
The final verse is always the trees. 
They will remain.   
 
When it is time to leave this place of return, 
What will we say that we found here? 
 
From out of the mist, a form wrestles to come forth— 
It is many-legged, of many arms, and sent forth thoughts of many colors. 
There are deer standing near us under the parted, misted sky 
As we watch, they smell for water 
Green light enters their bodies 
From all leaved things they eat— 
 
The old Mvskoke laws outlawed the Christian religion  
Because it divided the people. 
We who are relatives of Panther, Raccoon, Deer, and the other animals and winds were soon 
divided. 
But Mvskoke ways are to make relatives.  
We made a relative of Jesus, gave him a Mvskoke name.  
 
We cannot see our ancestors as we climb up 
The ridge of destruction 
But from the dark we sense their soft presences at the edge of our minds 
And we hear their singing. 
 
There is no word in this trade language,  
no words with enough power to hold all this we have become— 
 
We are in time. There is no time, in time.  
We are in a Mvskoke village, far back in time.  
Ekvnvjakv is in labor, so long in time. 
She is not young and beyond the time of giving birth.  
The keeper of birthing is tracking her energy, and time.  
My thinking is questioning how, this time.   
 
A young boy wrestles with two puppies at the doorway. 
A little girl, bearing an old woman spirit appears 
With green plants in her hands. 
Twins play around the edge of the bed. 
 
The Earth’s womb tightens with the need to push. 
That is all that I see because of the fogginess of time. 
 
I sing my leaving song.  
I sing it to the guardian trees, this beloved earth, 
To those who stay here to care for memory.  
I will sing it until the day I die.
