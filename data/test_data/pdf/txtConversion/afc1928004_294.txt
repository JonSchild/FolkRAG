By CorroN ,k; 1;11:mut. 
When we were, together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd \candor through the cotton fields, 
And hear the .To.y- bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At eveninz. when the boys were on t'uo green, 
We'd join them in the festive dance !

Cray and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting roll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land ; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand ; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away.

Hours beguiling ! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have,

She's very fond of music, at least that's what she said ;

love best. 
Permila Rosa is her name, a 
beauty she is I 
vow ; 
A 
winning smile she always givesonethinks I

Venus I'll protest ! 
Her eyes so blue, pierce me through—for the girl that I 
love best. 
She's very fond of music, Jte. 
While strolling out last Sunday Eve., just a

You see in us two nimble Mokes, 
Were called the magnet twins ! 
They cannot put the brakes on us 
As soon as day begins! 
We are like two balls of quicksilver, 
You never find us slow; 
We are never happy, day or night, 
Unless we're on the go!

High-Low-Jack, in the game! 
We are really not to blame ; 
You'll have to watch us very close— 
Now what we say is true— 
Or else your eyes .will be deceived, 
And you won't see what we do. 
Our style is quite original, 
With us none can compare. 
We bounee like India Rubber balls, 
And cut while in the air. 
At Gymnastics we take the lead, 
At dancing we're not slow ! 
And grace is here personified. 
So watch us as we go.

THE TRAMP. 
Written and sung by BEN COTTON, Jn. 
A 
poor fellow am I, 
I'm what you cdl a 
tramp ! 
Daily I 
trudge along the street; 
My feet are very sore, 
My clothes they are all tore, 
No one seems to know me, for I'm down 
Once I'd money plenty, 
And friends too, by the score ! 
But they have all passed away ; 
If I 
meet them on the street, 
They call me Beggar, and a 
Beat— 
And do not seem to know me. for I'm down I 
CHORE'S. 
Now, remember what I 
say, 
Your wealth may pass away ; 
And perhaps you will be forced to beg— 
Then your friends will pass you by— 
With scorn in their eye ; 
And will not recognize you, for you're down ! 
I'm weary and footsore, 
I 
m hungry and weak; 
I 
have got no place to lay my head, 
Except in a 
wagon, in the street ! 
Then some Policeman on hs Beat, 
Will drive me out, saying. that's no place to sleep ; 
And so I 
trudge along, 
And pass many a 
happy throng 
Of people a 
walking on the street; 
Looking at me, they've 1 )ts oi fun, 
Saying, oh ain't he a 
Bum! 
Ain't he a

The latest song of the day now is, 
Come down from tinder that; 
But here's one later, for old Maids.

They want me to have taste ; 
She watches me when I 
come home, 
To see an arm around my waist. 
My Charley comes, we then sit down— 
His intentions are honorable, too! 
And when he gets quite close to me, 
(He says, ) Close the door softly, oh do! 
SPOKES. — Of

Please, close the door softly, oh do! 
For she's peeping thro' the key hole at you,

My Charlie he's a 
handsome fellow, 
His teeth are pearly white ; 
His look-s—Hilderbrant Montrose ! 
With his new clothes cut so tight, 
He brings me gum drops to the house ; 
Then with his eyes so blue, 
He looks around the room and says, 
Please close the door, oh do! 
SPOREN. — I 
asked him when he was going to propose? 
He instantly fell upon his knees, and said, he was waiting

In the shady dell; 
When little stars are twinkling, 
Such tales of love we tell. 
Oh, she can whisper softly 
As the wind blows through the trees. 
Two loving hearts beat quick and fast, 
As her little hand I

While strolling leisurely along 
One day, I 
chanced to f,py 
The sweet subject of my song, 
She had a 
dark and rolling eye; 
She waved her handkerchief at me— 
So light and gay was her step ; 
And as I 
approached this maiden fair, 
Her distance sly, she kept.

Oh! Was'nt she a 
Beauty. [S3'm

I 
immediately approached this maiden fair, 
And offered her my arm 
She looked at me such a 
look. 
My very soul did charm. 
A 
fan half hid her lovely face ; 
She kept it there awhile. 
When she took it down, then I 
saw 
Her bright and Leautiful smile !

Ho pulled off his coat and gave a

Sung with 
immense success. 
One hundred nights in succession. 
Good evening, kind friends, it's how do you do ? 
As a 
miserable drunkard I 
now appear before you ; 
My clothes are all torn, my frame speaks decay ; 
As I 
travel through life, I'm drunk every day. 
I 
once had a 
home, two children to love, 
Through cold and hunger God took them above ; 
I 
would not support them, but left them alone, 
And thought it far better a 
drunkard to roam. 
Now, to all hard drinkers, I'll say a 
kind word— 
If you have a 
good home, be not a 
wand'ring bird; 
Shun all these bad vices, to your family prove true, 
And you'll find that the world will think better of you. 
But the day of repentance has now come to pass, 
I'll finish my song, with the drunkard's last glass; 
I'm sure I'll feel better, out of misery and pain— 
Good-night, my dear friends, I'll not drink again I

I 
should like to know the reason why, 
Who gave my girl a 
big black eye! 
She blinks and squints, begins to cry 
Whenever I 
pass her by. 
I 
met her again this afternoon, 
While walking down Broadway. 
Her face looked like a 
sick Babboon I 
Now this is what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You're too fresh, please take a 
walk! 
You're no better than a 
fraud. 
She said N. G., tra-la-lee! 
Why don't you carry the hod? 
She throws on style, with her pull-back dress, 
Gives me conundrums for to guess! 
Her love for me she don't confess, 
Which leaves me in distress. 
She said I 
was a 
happy maxi, 
A 
second Buffalo Bill! 
Go get a 
rope and try your strength 
To pull a 
cow up hill! 
She said if she was in my place. 
She'd go back to the ould sod; 
Take a 
walk, you dis.sie gawk, 
Why don't you carry a 
hod ? 
If she ever speaks to me at all, 
I'll pull off her Dutch water-fall ! 
I 
don't give a

Or if a 
Cop she calls. 
Go throw yourself off thti City Hall— 
Tie yourself to a

There is a

My anguish to control ; 
And said, vdim I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me oat of town 
As fast as I 
can go! 
And Sally fills 1110 with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, cte. 
Now I've resolved to search this town. 
Some smaller shoes to try; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by. 
I'll get a 
snazdkr pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style ! 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile!

Perhaps he's on Jim Bennett's yacht, and plows the raging

Perhaps with Babcock gone, crooked budge to btraighten

Perhaps " gone West" with Susan B. upon a

Perhaps he's gone to Cuba, for a

This Tammany King, this Boss of the Ring, 
And Connor and Dunham and thioan will sing 
With joy if the Sachem you'll find.

But all in vain, that's very plain, 
Have concluded they'll never escort Jhim again—

think I'm of the same mind.

hear this clamor : 
Perhaps he's gone with Darwin to civilize the ape, 
Perhaps with Bristow gone " to let no guilty man eseape,r 
Perintps he's gone to Utah, the Cancan dance to teach, 
Perhaps to Boston gone he is the " Third-term Ghost" to

DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind. 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Cother, and this thing and that,, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to mak ,- our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.— And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
no would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc 
Dm) night, foo 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way. 
The piecr, 
was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called he her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me. for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
taid: 
Pull down tbe blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned. 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys. 
I'm thankful I'm 'blessed with a 
good little w:fe. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

There was the Duke of Wellington,

Ho boat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the Irish won their part. 
Paugh-a-ballah! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll dio! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-an-by. ( Repeat) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a

Wherever there you go ; 
So don't treat them with disdain 
But show each man the same; 
Let all apply. that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come I

One day she'll smile, the next she'll frown, 
She is a 
creature strange, 
But there is no one in this town, 
For whom I 
would exchange; 
She's like the rest of woman kind. 
A 
riddle hard to read,— 
I'd like to know just what she means, 
'Twould plmse me much indeed!

want her to be mine, 
To me she is most dear, 
But, tho she don't decline. 
Her answer pains my ear. 
Tra-la-li, George, &a. 
tter father's a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of wordlylpelf,— 
Ha says his charming daughter 
Is a 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree. 
But when I 
speak about 
tier hand and heart, we have to part, 
For he cooly kicks me out! 
I 
see my love each thy, 
She says it is a 
shame, 
What will we do ?—I 
say— 
Her answer is the same.

BYO/M.—Yes, the more the boy cried, the more the 
father said— 
Tommy, make room, ice. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train;

With fondest of hopes in my heart. 
I'll wait where the brooklet is running,— 
Then fly, birdie, quickly depart ; 
be at the foot of the meadow, 
A 
down in the shady green dell, 
And there in the oak's spreading shadows 
Our love for each other we'll tell.

Little Robin tell Kitty I'm coming 
To meet her the same as of yore, 
The old love is still purely burning,—

Don't tarry so long in the air, 
But fly ; don't delay on your passage. 
And tell her be sure to be there

Written and sung by Faivsr LEWIS.

There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on his friend; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface, 
The kind deeds which thro' life him attend. 
I 
hear the echo sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
I 
list to its voice—and it bids me rejoice,— 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band 
Then Hurrah! Then Hurrah! 
Then Hurrah for the Minstrel Band; 
I 
will speak first of one whom we lov'd in the past. 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger ' twould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
The tall son of ' York, ho has died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
He was the pride, the pride— 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
Brave Unsworth, lie stood liks a 
Minstrel so true, 
'rill defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth, alas! broke his old Banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, ' till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding. 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
They liv'd and they died, with the boys tbat they lov'd, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band I 
The dear boys! The dear boys! 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band! 
But now I 
must speak of the prince of them all,— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan ! 
Let cy'ry one mourn, for our Chieftain is gone, 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrcf and Man. 
Let all his praises be sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud ilnd clear thro' the land. 
Ho liv'd and he died, both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band 1 
He was king! He was king! 
He was king of the Minstrel Band! 
There is also a 
name that is well known to Fame— 
* 
George Belmore, the Jockey so truo! 
His last race is run, and the prize he has won; 
To the Judges his spirit it flow. 
I 
hear the people shouting, shouting, 
As the flying Scud passes the Stand. 
The heat, it is run, the Gold cup is won, 
He has join'd the True Minstrel Band! 
Re has joined, he has joined, 
He has joined the True Minstrel Band!

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortruae-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing.

monds and spades — and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read accord rig to directions. Many or 
the an-
swers depend upon the position certai u 
cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tee dirertons have 
been made so that very little study sill suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of lettere in relation to them iron all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want tiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
1 
epulse, to venture upon asking the moinrntous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
s:nse of propriety, 
from doing, anything that would seem to be an un'ady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are sent 5S en unloved 
tedious existence, w 
hien might have been promnged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. Tuis pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection-, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards Is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
