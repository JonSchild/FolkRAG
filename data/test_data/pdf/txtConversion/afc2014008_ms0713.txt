i
tuation o
f a European-style apprenticeship i
s not only
 
an obvious anomaly, i
t i
s f
requently r
egarded as j
ust p

And f
i
nally, i

hat i
s only partially
 
dependent on c

he i
n
terjection o

n
to t
he c
ultural
 
equation could well be u
ltimately destructive.
 
The s
tart-up o
f t
he apprenticeship p
rogram p
roved t
o confirm
 
Enright's concerns.  There were absolutely n
o r
esponses t
o
 
newspaper and r
adio ads i
n Samoan announcing t
he new p
rogram.
 
F
inally, i
t was decided t
hat he s
hould speak d
irectly w

eaders i
n
 
t
he r
emote and d
ispersed v
i
llages where i
t became necessary t
o
 
f
o

he l
ong and s
low p
rocess o
f c
hiefly deliberation, p
rotocol
 
a
nd o
ratory.  Eventually even t
h
is approach was abandoned because i
t
 
became t
oo politicized, and an even s
lower p
rocess o
f i
n
formal
 
c
onsultation and consensus b
uilding emerged.  A
fter t
welve months
 
o
f apparent i
nactivity, a t
ime extension f
or t
he p
i
lot g
rant was
 
r
equested and eventually approved.  A l
e
tter f
rom Enright a
t t
he t
ime
 
r
eferred t
o t
he p
roject as "
lurching f
orward" w
ith t
he s
i
tuation
 
d
iscouraging and o
ften even enervating.
 
F
inally f
our p
i
lot apprenticeships were begun -
-
 two i
nvolving
 
pandanus mat weaving, another woodcarving, and t
he l
ast employing
 
a t
raditional house builder.  Master carpenter Togiva Vai'au worked
 
w

ST SIMONS  ISLAND FESTIVAL 8/93
 
Left Washington 7:15 a. m.,  arrived in Jacksonville FL 11:00 a. m.,  rented
 
car from Avis  (efficient but not very pleasant and expensive -
 $107 for
 
2 days)  and set forth.
 Frankie and Doug's directions were heavy on the
 
atmosphere -
-
 "You got to go over five different bridges.  .
 .
 .
 And then
 
you turn right by the ice cream store" -
-
 and light on such matters as
 
route numbers,  so I got well and truly lost and didn't make it to the
 
motel until around 1:30 really.  The hotel  (
St Simons Inn)  was within a
 
block's walk of Neptune Park,  the site of the festival;  again it was
 
extremely convenient and pleasant and served a great continental
 
breakfast,  but a touch expensive,  (
$63 a night senior citizens rate)
 
Got to the Festival around 2:00;  heard the following groups:
 
MITCHELL COUNTY BAPTIST HYMN RAISERS.  An a-capella group of local
 
male singers;  oldish mixed repertoire,  things like Swing Low Sweet
 
Chariot,  nice style.
 Good home-town group with a nice mellow sound,  old
 
timey quartet repertoire
 and one really sweet song that went
 
Let your light shine,  shine,  shine
 
Let your light shine,  shine,  shine,
 
Maybe there's somebody down in the valley
 
Trying to get home.
 
Maybe I was tired or something,  but it really reduced me to tears.
 
MCINTOSH COUNTY SHOUTERS.
 This particular group of the Shouters
 
consisted of five women shouting with three men singing and beating
 
stick.
 Their repertoire seemed to me especially interesting this time
 
round;
 I mentioned this to Worth Long  (who was there acting as main
 
stage presenter)  and he said they had dug deep into their memories over
 
the past year and came up with
 some new really old songs.
 It would be
 
good to discuss this with them when they come up for the Heritage award;
 
(
they announced to great applause they were going  up to Washington)
 
They deserve both the applause and the award;  they are singing and
 
dancing really  
well without any hokum and their texts and tunes are
 
first class
 
ALGA MAE HINTON.
 She was excellent and after some improvements
 
with the miking was much appreciated by the audience.
 She brought her
 
daughter  (age 17?)
 with her who danced with her mama giving Alga a
 
breather and adding a little variety.
 It went very well and I would
 
recommend using the mother-daughter team in future;  the girl holds her
 
head just like Alga Mae and  with that same half-smiling wise-woman
 
expression  (Whoopi Goldberg has it too) - very funny,  the two of them.
 
WASHBOARD BAND.
 An old time vaudeville act -
 an elderly gentleman
 
with a gravel voice and heaps of experienced black macho leading off on
 
"When You're Smiling","Mack the Knife" and the odd blues and old country
 
tune,  accompanied by a partly electrified,  partly accoustic small rhythm
 
band -
 piano,  washboard,  guitar,  bass.  Reminiscent of Howard Armstrong
 
and his era and kind of fun once he got going.
 
FRIENDLY STARS -
 a group of young Brunswick men with a
 
miscellaneous electronified accompaniment,  singing in pretty much
 
contemporary show-off gospel style,  every phrase pushed to the last
 
possible bearable repetition.
 But they  plainly were home-town young
 
men and they lacked the mechanical perfection of the groups they were
 
imitating,  as a result being much more likeable.
 Besides,  their lead
 
singer was the sound man and the other guys were his crew,  and the lead
 
singer also came up and did the Ranky Tank and Sandy Ree with Doug and
 
Frankie at one point-- he was quite a good dancer and obviously loved
 
the stuff.  The Friendly Stars finally began to seem to me
 symbolic of
 
the complex nature of the festival itself -

 it's all African American
 
wheels within wheels,
 and they do seem to be running by the grace of
 
God.  It was certainly instructive for me.  When I first arrived,  for
 
example,  I was ready to fire the sound man,  but by the second morning I
 
was realizing that he also did all these other things and besides he had
 
fixed up the sound considerably overnight with Worth's avuncular help
 
and advice.  It's all done with brotherly love these days,  probably just
 
as well.
 
SENSATIONAL TONES -
 Another modern gospel group but one I really
 
could not stand.
 Loud wasn't the word for it and they ground it out
 
like a bunch of pumped up robots.
 (Doug Quimby hated them too;  he and I
 
ran across each other scouting around to find a place on the grounds
 
where we weren't being deafened and he expressed his disapproval as
 
openly as I have ever heard him.)
 
ORIGINAL GOSPEL THIGH SLAPPERS -
 Doug's own a capella quartet from
 
from his high school days in rural Georgia.
 They re-formed a few years
 
ago and are having a real good time doing kind of 1950's quartet numbers
 
-
-
 lots of Golden Gate stuff -
 Preacher and the Bear,  Noah,  Working on
 
the Building.
 They had a nice mellow sound,  very enjoyable,  a very
 
dignified and quietly humorous group;  I' d put them on any day.
 Doug's
 
voice,  by the way,  is getting even better;  he is turning into quite a
 
singer
 
"N-STYLE.  I seem to have taken no notes about this group and don't
 
remember a thing about them which probably means I didn't like them.
 
Sorry.
 
RON AND NATALIE DAISE -
 SEA ISLAND MONTAGE.
 A young married
 
couple who I think were St Simons  Island born and raised but they have
 
gone off and gotten an education,  that's for sure.  I heard them only
 
once.
 They were story tellers and sang a bit too;  it was obviously an
 
act they had fixed up for presenting "the old ways" in schools.  They
 
used the real stuff,  but it seemed to me not informed with much
 
understanding or subtlety or art;  it was kind of canned in that over-
dramatic professional story-telling style,  and a hint supercilious too,
 
though I' m sure they would be very hurt that  I said that.  I wish I had
 
had a chance to hear them again;  it's quite possible they were better
 
than I thought.
 They did do some of the tough stuff and they didn't
 
sentimentalize about it
 
GEORGIA SEA ISLAND SINGERS.
 This means Frankie and Doug and
 
assorted grown children,  several of whom were Bessie's grandchildren and
 
travelled with her at one time.
 (Frankie's first husband was Joseph
 
Smith,  Bessie's second son;  they divorced.
 Frankie later married Doug
 
and had several other children by him;  therefore some of her children
 
are Bessie's grands and some are not.)
 Frankie and Doug did several of
 
the adult Sea Island songs -
-
 "Raggy Levee",  "Moses",  "Old Tar River"
 
and they are doing them better each time I have heard them.
 Doug's
 
voice has really matured and in one rendition of "Moses" he almost
  
sounded like John Davis.
 The "children" helped out on the choruses;
 
they don't know or understand the
 harmony and need to listen to the
 
records and look at the films but they did right well on the dancing -
-
"Sandy Ree",  "Here Come Uncle Jesse",  "Ranky Tank" being standouts.
 
Frankie occasionally gets too mechanical in her introductions,  putting
 
everything in the context of slavery,  but she is in there pitching every
 
minute to give content and meaning to this mystifying old stuff,  really
 
working hard in her mother-in-law's explanatory spirit,  and a goodly
 
number of times getting it exactly right.  I was impressed by her sanity
 
and her basic modesty and love for the stuff.
 
She and Doug demonstrate rice-beating as the crowning event of
 
each Festival day;  again,  it's a bit of a confusion but it is done with
 
great reverence and affection and the crowd would be deeply disappointed
 
if it either changed or was left Out -
 just the way people ought to
 
feel about ritual.  They use lovely very old achingly real working
 
implements that they obtained from an old plantation house
 in the area
 
-
-
 a flail and a fanner basket and a wooden mortar and beating sticks -
-
and the people who came to look at them closely were really impressed.
 
So was I.
 
SOUNDS OF THE SOUTH BRASS BAND.
 For me this was the musical  
high
 
point.
 This is a United House of Prayer for All People  (Daddy Grace)
 
group from Savannah,  and we heard both their youth band  (
about 15
 
players)  and their senior band  (
about 12 players)  and,  my,  they did play
 
up a positive storm.  When they played real tunes,  instead of the pale
 
attenuated pointless melodies that hymn  (and other)  contemporary
 
composers seem to be producing these days,  it was breathtaking music.
 
And it was visually breathtaking too.
 They like to play at  
each other
 
so they perform in as much of a circle formation as they can get away
 
with and all these strong young men dancing with their slide trombones
 
getting ever hotter and ever louder,  waving at the audience and each
 
other with their slides,  moving in unison and in complementarity,
 
marching when they could,  jumping when it really hit them,  was really
 
something to see.
 I kept remembering the phrase about Buddy Bolden's
 
blowing his brains out through his horn,  and every one of these fellows
 
was playing just that hard.  But magically the sound,  though louder than
 
you could imagine sound could be,  didn't ring painfully in my ears the
 
way electronic sound does.
 
And  the fellows call themselves a "shout band" as distinct from
 
a marching band or a jump-up band  (both common band types traditional to
 
the coastal area) .
 Well -
-
 putting them on in common concert with the
 
MacIntosh County shouters would be a treat for the religious and the
 
secular,  wouldn't it? The other thing I kept thinking is what a great
 
young male activity this is -
-
 absolutely exciting,  absolutely
 
exhausting,  absolutely consuming of all your strong feelings and all
 
your energies and absolutely full of strong warm fellowship,  for whether
 
you're good at it or not really doesn't much matter because the group is
 
going to carry you along.
 I saw one young fellow just standing in with
 
the youth choir moving his arm back and forth as though he had a
 
trombone in it,  smiling and kind of wallowing in the glory of the music
 
-
-
 just lovely.
 
*  *  *  *  *
 
The above performances were repeated on the single stage both days  (
see
 
attached program),  and they were the heart of the festival activity.
 
The stage had a large canvas shading that stretched back over some 40
 
rows of seats and all around were extra chairs and built in tables with
 
benches under the enormous live oaks that shade the whole grounds.  I do
 
believe this is the most beautiful festival location I have ever seen,
 
and I only hope it doesn't get so popular that it becomes over-crowded.
 
In the patio of an adjacent cultural building there was a separate area
 
for crafts that were being both demonstrated and sold. Mr.  Green,  the
 
elderly sea grass basket maker,  was there with not  just one but two
 
apprentices,  all sewing away,  along with a white couple who
 grew and
 
made things out of gourds  (including Aunt Jemimas,  which didn't sell
 
very well),  a white guy who quietly and deftly demonstrated turning on a
 
home-made lathe  (Frankie told me he was standing in for their black
 
wooden cane-carver who recently died),  a young black quilt maker and an
 
herb doctor.
 Scattered around on the grounds and suffering from lack of
 
serious signage and some kind of outside presentation were some really
 
good local net and trap makers and  a turpentine producer -
-
 all of them
 
excellent and totally genuine.
 Frankie is rightfully proud of getting
 
these latter folks to participate,  and she really does need some help in
 
how topresent them more effectively.
 Then there were about ten food
 
sources:  a coca cola wagon and a lemonade stand,  three different
 
barbecues,  a smoked mullet stand,  a lady who made wonderful devilled
 
crabs,  a Sea Island crab boil  (
shrimps,  white potatoes,  small chunks of
 
corn on the cob and some kind of sausage all boiled together -
-
 very
 
good)  and two different church congregations who produced absolutely
 
heavenly Sunday dinners with three kinds of chicken,  two kinds of
 
shrimp,  collards,  okra and fresh peach cobbler.
 
It all had the feeling of a pleasant weekend day in the park  (
only so
 
much nicer than most)  and at any given time,  approximately 80 to 90% of
 
the people there were black.
 And that,  I believe,  is the real triumph
 
of this event.  Frankie at one point asked the audience where they had
 
come from and there were some from New Jersey and Massachusetts and New
 
York and from all the southern states  (bear in mind -
-
 almost all black)
 
but by far the largest group were black families from various south
 
Georgia counties.  The Sea Islands were represented with a reasonable
 
number of attendees but culturally speaking,  in performance and in
 
attendance,  this ja a south Georgia festival rather than the Sea Island
 
festival it is billed as.  Frankie is quite aware of this anomaly.  She
 
has been working hard to build island attendance;  she told me that her
 
children door-to-door with festival flyers throughout St Simon's and go
 
to
 Sapelo too,  and each year there is a larger local attendance.
 But
 
the wonderful thing about this is that it is a real African American
 
event consciously and seriously dedicated to preserving and celebrating
 
the African American cultural heritage and I do not know of any other in
 
the entire nation.  As such,  it is unique,  and it really must be
 
cherished and even protected.
 
Frankie and I had something of a talk about the festival budget and
 
whether the event will continue to be dependent upon grants,  and she
 
simply says yes.
 I asked her if there was anything she could do about
 
it and she said,  well we pray a lot.  It should be noted that she does
 
what the Smithsonian doesn't do -
-
 she pays all her artists
 
appropriately  (and brings them in and houses them in nice hotels and
 
feeds them well,  and remember,  African American performers like Pacific
 
Islanders mostly come in large groups,)  -
-
 and she does what Joe Wilson
 
doesn't do -
-
 she pays all her grounds workers,  gofers and presenters,
 
because they need the money and she needs reliable help.  She takes a
 
small percentage  (
10%?)  from the food people,  and a larger one from the
 
craft sellers,  but basically she tells me the local folks,  including the
 
performers,  don't see much other cash ,
 and people like the smoked
 
mullet man count on it each year for school clothes for his kids.
 The
 
year they didn't do the festival,  she said she could hardly go out to
 
the island for seeing the reproachful looks on people's faces,  so
 
clearly this event has been accepted into the local black community in
 
ways that they seem ready to tolerate even if it isn't a really Sea
 
Island festival in the most purist sense.
 
My sense is that Frankie is doing the very best  job that she can do with
 
what she knows and the resources at her command.
 After all,  she and
 
Doug have to support themselves too,  and that means being on the road
 
most of the year;  she probably puts it all together in the first few
 
weeks of the summer.
 She is delighted -
-
 and rightfully -
-
 that her
 
grown children are now showing real interest in the event and in the
 
music and dance.  (
She told me she has decided that you have to get to be
 
anyway 40 years old before you appreciate your cultural heritage;  I may
 
begin circulating this as Quimby's Law.)  Anyway,  this gives me the good
 
feeling that this event might have a life that could extend after
 
Frankie and Doug just get to old to do all the work.  In that case there
 
are
 a few things that might be done now that would help Frankie without
 
interfering with the
 remarkable social and cultural balance she has
 
been able to achieve:
 
1
)
 Obtain some kind of ongoing state support for the
 
Festival.
 The absence of any state funding is a real scandal,  it seems
 
to me,  and could and possibly should be made a matter of general public
 
interest and concern.
 
2)
 Get a few young folklore students to apprentice
 
themselves to Frankie for at least brief periods;  she needs the help and
 
they need the experience.
 
3
)
 Get some good Georgia folklorist to volunteer to help
 
Frankie out with the local crafts presentations;  one of the netmakers
 
went out and threw a circular net  (
I was told)  but nobody knew it was
 
going to happen so nobody saw it.  Those guys need and deserve their own
 
presenter to help stage their own special events.  This would take no
 
more than a week of an experienced folklorist's time,  it seems to me;
 
it's  just a question of visiting around with the folks Frankie has
 
already located,  figuring out with them what they would need for
 
effective presentatiion,  and then getting the signs made and schedule
 
worked out and putting it all on.
 
4
)
 Work out with Frankie an annual routine way of helping
 
her with the annual routine paperwork.  She still forgets to send in cash
 
requests and is chronically late with applications.
 If this festival is
 
going to be an ongoing affair,  a simple ongoing fiscal calendar should
 
be developed,
 and Frankie's talents are best used elsewhere.  It seems
 
to me that the Georgia Folk Arts Coordinator might empower someone to do
 
this essential task;  perhaps a local St Simons'  business person or bank
 
manager might take this on as his/her contribution to the arts.
 They
 
would certainly get a star or two in their crown.
 (This,  of course,  is
 
a delicate proposition;  that doesn't mean it isn't needful,  just that it
 
should be handled with due consideration for Frankie's and other
 
Islander's feelings.)
 
5
)
 Try in every possible way to increase the Sea Island
 
input to the festival.
 Maybe a film showing of the available historical
 
footage could be worked out,  though this would have to be carefully
 
handled.  Certainly the availability of the books,  videos,  recordings and
 
other resources of the local public library should be publicized and
 
touted both at the Festival and throughout the year.
 The Library should
 
be encouraged to keep their Sea Island holdings -
-
 books,  recordings and
 
videotapes -
-
 up to date and available;  (
I am told that some Sea Island
 
videotapes once checked out have never been returned) .
 Perhaps
 
descendants of John and Peter Davis,  Mabel Hillary,  Emma Ramsay and
 
others of the original Georgia Sea Island Singers could be contacted and
 
invited to participate in concerts or the festival itself.
 
*  *  *  *  *
 
I don't know if Frankie is planning to apply for next summer at
 
the September deadline.
 I would certainly recommend to the panel that
 
the event be put into the category of exceptional and unusual events,  at
 
least until some stable support can be organized from the state of
 
Georgia.

Notes from talk with Frankie,  Doug,  Joangela
 
Frankie's maiden name is Sullivan;  she was born in Brunswick but did
 
most of her growing up on St Simon's.  Her first husband was Joseph Jones
 
(Bessie's second son);  after bearing several children  (Bessie's
 
grandchildren),  Frankie and Joseph divorced and Frankie married Douglas
 
Quimby who is from Baconton,  (
sp.?)  Georgia where Bessie came from.  She
 
and Doug themselves have a number of children who are not,  therefore,
 
Bessie's grandchildren.
 
Bessie had three children:
 
George Jones  (minister;  alive and living on St Simons);
 
injured a few years back in a major car accident,  since that time has
 
become increasingly miserly and excessively religious;  Worth Long
 
concurred in a separate conversation that George was a bit on the
 
tetched side and certainly extremely obsessive about religion.
 
Joseph Jones  (
alive,  living on St Simons) .
 Originally
 
married to Frankie and father of several children including Joangela
 
Jones Stephens  (
251 Cornwall Street,  Brunswick,  Ga
 31520;'  912-265-
1253)
.
 She is the oldest grandchild and very active in helping her
 
mother.
 
Rosalee Jones Wrice  (
sp.?)  (deceased) .She left a daughter
 
Johnnie Mae Brooks.
 
A group of Bessie's grandchildren including Joangela  (
and Johnnie Mae ?
)
 
toured with Bessie at one time and remember visiting Alan in New York
 
with their grandma.
 
Joangela reported during the conversation that most of the family think
 
that Frankie and Doug are getting all the royalty money;  actually,  of
 
course,  they have been getting none of it except for my personal
 
donation to the festival.)

Dear Bess:
 
Thank you so much for all the time,  effort,  and
 
energy that you devoted to the Cultural Olympiad
 
Regional Designation program.
 Your participation
 
on the panel was crucial to the successful
 
selection of this year's designees.
 
It's exciting to be part of a new initiative;  yet
 
at the same time we are acutely aware of a number
 
of components in the program that will need to be
 
refined for next year.
 The panel's comments
 
during the evaluation portion of the meeting will
 
be invaluable as we develop new strategies for
 
realizing the program's aims.  If you have any
 
additional thoughts or suggestions that you would
 
like to share,  I encourage you to jot them down or
 
give me a call.
 
Enclosed please find an SAF Expense Report form.
 
Please fill it out,  attach your receipts,  and
 
return to me at your earliest convenience.
 We are
 
also currently processing the honoraria paperwork,
 
and expect to have your checks in the mail before
 
the end of this month.
 
Again,  thank you for your willingness to
 
participate in the "maiden voyage" of this
 
important effort to identify and celebrate
 
artistic excellence in the South.
 I look forward
 
to the opportunity to work with you in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Catherine Underhill

RALEIGH  DURHAM  8/93
 
A fast overnight;  left  from Dulles  (parked car overnight;
 
cost $6.00 per day,  after first day,  time is pro-rated so
 
total cost was  $9.00,  cheaper than one-way cab to National)
 
We took off at  1:30 p. m.  on United Express--small plane,
 
uncomfortable flight,  expensive.  Dan Patterson met me and
 
took me to his house where Beverly and he had arranged dinner
 
for me,  George Holt,  Terry Zug,  C.C.  Conyers  (
sp.?)  and
 
Eleanor Long Wilgus,  recently moved into Raleigh Durham area
 
escorting D.K.s papers to the University.  A lovely meal and
 
pleasant company;  we mostly chit-chatted but nobody went home
 
until midnight.  Eleanor looked dreadful,  puffy and unhealthy;
 
she has emphysema,  various allergies,  and osteoporosis,  which
 
had caused several ribs to crack during her recent move here.
 
Apparently the local  folklore community has rallied round her
 
and she says she is very happy in N.C.and looking forward to
 
being able to get back to work.  C.C.  has gotten tenure at
 
Appalachian State and seems vigorous and enjoying life.  Dan
 
tells me he wants to retire in two years,  and seems quite
 
intent on it.
 
I spent the night  in Dan's and Beverly's  lovely home;  the
 
following morning they hosted a 9:00 a. m.  meeting which
 
included the three of us,  George,  Dave and
 Whisnant,
 
and Glenn and Sally Peterson Hinson.  After a morning's
 
discussion we came up with the rough plan outlined on the
 
following page.  Beverly Patterson agreed to coordinate the
 
details of applying for the grar s;  Terry Zug reported the
 
Dean of his School was already interested and would
 
undoubtedly sign off on an application.  Terry will try to get
 
a bit of match out of him.
 I said I would formulate the
 
results of the morning's meeting in a way that could be pEut
 
on the first page of an application.
 
Dan,  Beverly,  George and I lunched together;  and George later
 
drove me to the airport.  We did a fair amount of gossiping;
 
he wants to continue working outside the arts council if he
 
possibly can.  Beverly says he and Mary Richards hardly ever
 
even speak now.  George will be coming to D.C.  for a Fund for
 
Folk Culture planning meeting  (funded by Folk Arts)  right
 
after Heritage.  He drove me to the airport;  got home about
 
9
:30;  it  certainly looked good.

Dear Bev:  The following is my first attempt to summarize our
 
committee discussion of the other morning.  Both Dan S.  and
 
Barry B.of the Folk Arts Program are out of pocket until
 
August 30.  Why don't you call them Aug 31  (after I will have
 
had a crack at them)  and enquire how an application should be
 
handled? Maybe  just the first page will do,  or they may say
 
hang on to it  for a couple of days and send in more info,  or
 
some other procedure may be in effect.  As far as the
 
following goes,  it doesn't  seem very engaging to me,  but  I
 
think(hope)  it  is accurate and there is relatively little
 
fluff.
 Please edit ad lib and show to anybody else you think
 
should see it.  And thanks again for your great hospitality.

The Folklore Curriculum at the University of North Carolina
 
and the Office of Folklife Programs at the North Carolina
 
Department of Cultural Resources will  jointly apply for a
 
two-year $40,000 grant  from NEA Folk Arts to support a five
 
day planning meeting of 12-15 invited scholars from various
 
appropriate disciplines to be held on the UNC campus during
 
the  summer of 1994.  The conference would be charged with two
 
distinct and inter-locking responsibilities:
 
1
)  to engage in a sober and constructive evaluation o
 
"public sector folklore",  its historical development,  its
 
demonstrated achievements,  its inherent problems,  its present
 
needs,  and its potential cultural and political strategies
 
during today's rapid social changes.  The meeting would take
 
focus from two to three assigned discussion papers contracte
 
for in advance and available to all participants well before
 
the meeting.  The results of the conference,  including the
 
discussion papers,  will be offered to the Journal of American
 
Folklore as a special issue,  re-presented at a meeting of the
 
American Folklore Society,  or circulated through the Public
 
Programs Newsletter as appropriate.
 
2)  to develop a working plan for an annual summer
 
seminar series offering invited public sector workers
 
intensive refresher courses  in such timely and specialized
 
subject areas as the performing arts of Southeast Asia,  the
 
traditional arts of new immigrants from the former Soviet
 
Union,  or new approaches and analytical techniques useful to
 
active folklore work,  as the conference deems appropriate.
 
Whatever funds are not used for the earlier planning
 
conference will serve to initiate the first of these
 
seminars.
 
The two initiating agencies have evolved this proposal
 
out of their well documented interest  in and lengthy
 
experience with
 public sector folklore activity.  The
 
conference would be open to observers and its results
 
circulated as widely as possible.

The s

onfirm
 
Enright's concerns.  There were absolutely n

esponses t

F

t
 
became t
oo politicized, and an even s
lower p
rocess o
f i
n
formal
 
c

fter t
welve months

r

o t
he p
roject as "

he s

ften even enervating.
 
F

The M
issouri T
raditional Arts Apprenticeship P
rogram has s
upported
 
a series o
f apprenticeships i
nvolving Mone Saenphimmachak, a
 
Lowland Lao embroiderer and weaver.  She and her f
amily moved t
o
 
S
t. Louis i
n 1984 f
rom r
efugee camps i
n Thailand, having f
led t
here
 
t
o escape t
he political t
roubles i
n Laos.  Mone was born i
n Mahazai, a
 
v
i
llage o
f 500 f
amilies i
n central Laos, and s
he began t
o l
earn
 
weaving and embroidery a
t her mother's s
ide a
t t
he age o
f 12.  Mone
 
says o
f t
hese s
kills:  "
No one wants t
o marry a g
irl who can't sew..."
 
Even very wealthy g
irls who would never have t
o sew as adults had
 
t
o k
now some k
ind o
f handwork i
n o
rder t
o be considered
 
marriageable."  While she was courting Vanxay, her husband-to-be,
 
h
is mother was i
nspecting her weaving. As part o
f t
he p
rocess o
f
 
betrothal, Mone had t
o p
resent Vanxay's mother w
ith a sarong s
he
 
had made.
 
Lest one t
hink t
hat t
hese marriage p
re-conditions were a b
it one-
s
ided, Mone's f
ather, a
t t
he same t
ime, was concerned t
hat h
is
 
f
uture son-in-law d
id not k
now how t
o build a l
oom.  A

heir
 
marriage, Mone's f
ather i
nstructed Vanxay i
n t
he making o
f a l
oom,
 
commenting, "Why d
id you get married i
f
 you don't even k
now how t
o
 
make a l

S
ince moving t

Weaving and t
raditional embroidery s
eem t
o be part a

f
 
Mone Saephinnachak's sense o
f her s
elf and her b
i
ttersweet past.
 
She t
o

t i
s i
mportant t

he
 
says,  s
o "we may r
ecognize ourselves b

ew
 
o

i
fteen years o
f t
esting and experimentation:

contradictory but positive i
mpulses a
re t
he basic e
nergizers o
f any
 
apprenticeship p

hould never be o
verlooked.
 
+That every overall apprenticeship p

out o

+That genuine apprenticeships a

t

icky t
o a

ickier t
o keep going. I

and a g

better known as t
he a

o b
ring
 
hopeful couples t
ogether and acts as both r

s

+That i
t i
s t
herefore unwise t
o i
n
itiate an apprenticeship
 
p
