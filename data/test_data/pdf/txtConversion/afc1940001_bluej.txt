BLUE JULIETTA. Oh, an Indian girl, bright Delferetta Alfarata ?Where sweeps the waters of the blue
JuliettaSwift as an antelope through the forest goingLoose were her [gentile?] locks and her weighty
tresses flowingSo sang the indian girl, bright Delferetta Alfaratta ?Where sweeps the waters of the
blue JuliettaStill sweeps the waters of the blue Julietta.That's two verses of it.
