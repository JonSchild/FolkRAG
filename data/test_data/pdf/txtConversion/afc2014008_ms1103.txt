Dear Bess,
 
I
'm afraid I
'm behind in all m y  correspondance.
 I never seem to get
 
past the URGENT pile on my desk.
 This seems to be the year of the FESTIVAL
 
for Guam, as you will see as you read on.
 
Foremost of festivals, of course, is the 5th International Pacific
 
Festival of Arts in Townsville, Australia, scheduled for August 14 through
 
27, 1988.
 We are taking Folk Artists from all the Apprenticeship programs
 
ongoing this year -
 four Kantan Chamorrita Singers, a Belembautuyan player,
 
the Chamorro Blacksmith, two weavers of pandanus and coconut leaf, and
 
a cultural dance group whose members went through a series of auditions
 
to qualify.
 I feel good about this group, whom I feel can present a
 
fine cultural program more in tune with the intent of the Festival than
 
a pageant alone.
 We are still going to present a pageant both locally
 
and in Australia, using many of the Folk Artists as well as people from
 
the Guam community who auditioned for parts.
 This pageant has a story
 
line which depicts the evolution of Chamorro music through the various
 
outside cultural influences and endeavors to show how these outside
 
influences blended with Chamorro culture to produce our unique local
 
music.
 Kantan Chamorrita will be highlighted throughout the pageant.
 
The final auditions for the pageant take place today.
 
We received a letter from the Australian Host Committee saying
 
that a delegation will be visiting all the islands between March 8 and
 
April 11.
 A more specific fax was to follow, but we haven't yet received
 
it.
 They also sent a promotional video tape about Townsville and the
 
coming festival plans.
 However, the tape won't work on our U.S. equipment.
 
I hope they can send us a copy compatible with our equipment so we see
 
how their plans are developing.
 Its also to be used for promotional
 
purposes locally.
 
Negotiations with the airlines are proceeding nicely.
 Continental
 
and Hawaiian Airlines were asked to submit bids for charter flights, which
 
Continental did.
 Hawaiian Air called and said they don't have an aircraft
 
available and so could not bid.
 The Federated States of Micronesia as well
 
as Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas are interested in sharing a charter.
 
FSM has been able to confirm a delegation of 90; CNNI a delegation of 50.
 
This leaves Guam to carry the remaining 105 seats on a DC 10.
 We only plan
 
to send a delegation of 60 maximum, so that leaves us 45 seats to sell to
 
anyone interested in making the trip with us.
 We plan to have a travel
 
agent put together a package to sell.
 On a DC 10 the passenger load is 245
 
persons at $900 per seat.
 Of course freight space will be ours as well.
 
We are putting you on our list as an official member of our delegation.
 
T%
le  are scheduled to leave the morning of August 13 for the non-stop five-
o u r  flight.
 We plan to return August 28.
 The CNNI and FSM delegations
 
1 have connecting flights to Guam to catch this charter flight.
 
had the good fortune to attend the NALAA Festival Management Conference
 
1
0 \(
­o,T  Orleans February 5 through 7
.
 CPAC provided funds for one representative
 
from each member (CNMI, American Samoa, and Guam) to attend.
 Featured was a
 
slate of dynamic,  inspiring speakers who spoke on topics concerning the logistics
 
2
 
behind the scenes, organization of available community groups, fundraising
 
strategies, proper planning and placement of events within the festival
 
grounds, and specific festivals and how they grew.
 I came away with a different
 
perspective and renewed energy for facing the many festival events which
 
have sprung up here recently.
 I was also able to meet and talk with John Enright,
 
the new Folk Arts Coordinator from American Samoa as well as with Martin Sablan
 
who is in charge of Festivals for CNMI.
 We discussed the possibilities of
 
having some cultural exchange among our islands.
 It was decided that
 
the Festival in Australia would be a perfect place to look over each
 
other's presentations and to begin planning touring exchanges for our
 
traditional artists.
 
A few months ago our legislature passed a law mandating that Department
 
of Commerce  and the Department of Parks and Recreation put on a GUAM/MICRONESIA
 
ISLAND FAIR at Ipao Beach once a year.
 This was to promote the exchange
 
of agriculture, aquaculture, manufactured goods and arts and crafts
 
among the islands of Guam, CNMI, and Micronesia.
 CAHA was not mentioned
 
in the legislation nor consulted in the writing of the law.
 Naturally,
 
however, when planning began, Department of Commerce called on us.
 
I
'm afraid that when we first met all agencies involved came together
 
with negative thoughts, and the first discussions centered on how to
 
get rid of the legislation which created it, because:
 there were too
 
many agricultural restrictions which prohibited the importation of animals
 
and products from these islands; the various islands could not afford
 
to send livestock or groups of artists to Guam when everybody was having
 
a hard time finding funds to go to Australia; and Ipao Beach is not
 
an ideal place to put on a festival because its archeological status
 
doesn't allow any digging for fence poles or but construction.
 When
 
it became apparent that the powers-that-be were set on having this festival
 
and money was identified from the Tourist Attraction Fund we began planning
 
in earnest.
 Departments of Commerce, Parks and Rec., Public Works,
 
Guam Visitor's Bureau, Agriculture, and CAHA are now meeting weekly
 
to make the event a success.
 It's scheduled for May 6,7,8,and 9 at
 
Ipao Beach.
 All the members of the committee are hard-working, dedicated
 
people and I think it can be a success.
 I am preparing my folk artists
 
for crafts exhibits and sales, traditional food preparation demonstrations,
 
and performances.
 I am helping Department of Commerce, who is taking
 
the lead to contact other island groups living here to build huts and
 
put together performances, arts and crafts from their various islands.
 
We are able to use other events to draw from for our festival.
 For
 
example, University of Guam celebrates their annual Charter Day this
 
week.
 The various student organizations from the micronesian islands
 
each build huts to compete for a prize.
 They are willing to dismantle
 
and transport their huts from Charter Day and build them at Ipao Beach
 
to compete in the hut contest associated with our fair.
 They are gathering
 
their dancing groups together, and their home governments have promised
 
to send crafts to exhibit and sell and authentic costumes for their
 
dances.
 I draw on the same organizations for my festival in September,
 
so we are reminding them of the upcoming September event as they prepare
 
for the fair.
 I will also use the Guam/Micronesia Fair as the first
 
public forum for the Kantan Chamorrita Apprenticeship program to present.
 
The Belembautuyan Apprenticeship will also present, as will the Blacksmith
 
and the Pandanus Weavers.
 
Last week was the Department of Education's Chamorro Week Celebrations.
 
During that two-week period, our office gets many calls from schools
 
to help them contact traditional performers and craftspersons to present
 
in their schools.
 I encouraged my folk artists to accept as many as
 
they felt they could handle, and many of them responded graciously.
 
I worked closely with one high school in particular, who had a very
 
organized plan to rotate all their classes to see and hear presentations
 
by various folk artists.
 Each presenter gave four sessions in their
 
I
 
3
 
assigned topic, and the student body rotated to their pre-chosen sites
 
so that each student got to see and hear four different presentations.
 
The Old-Time Chamorro Band presentated to a large crowd each period
 
in the Cafeteria, playing traditional dance tunes and getting the audience
 
involved in the dance.
 Those who didn't attend this went to a smaller
 
presentation by two of my master Kantan Chamorrita singers who put on
 
a joint presentation of traditional Chamorro songs, including Kantan
 
Chamorrita.
 They are both real hams and were a big hit with the students,
 
even those who couldn't understand the language.
 Another site had presentations
 
by the Chamorro Blacksmith and an if
 ilwood carver.
 A third site featured
 
weavers of pandanus and coconut palm leaf who demonstrated.
 The fourth
 
site featured historical and story-telling in a variety of ways -
 a
 
master in my Kantan Chamorrita program spoke on the traditional Chamorro
 
marriage and courtship customs prevalent in her youth, another of the
 
Kantan Chamorrita singers held the classroom spellbound with legends.
 
The Belembautuyan master presented a sample of his tunes and answered
 
questions from the students.
 The library featured a slide presentation
 
of old photographs from the archives of Micronesian Area Research Center.
 
Prior to these presentations the guests were all treated to a Chamorro
 
Cook-out of traditional foods served on banana leaf with drinks served
 
in bamboo cups the students had made.
 I was very impressed by the presentations
 
and by the appreciation shown by the students.
 
Coming up April 16 & 17 is a COUNTY FAIR sponsored by the Department
 
of Agriculture.
 They have enlisted my help in contacting traditional
 
craftspersons to exhibit and sell.
 
The week-end following the Guam/Micronesia Island Fair, Continental
 
Airlines is celebrating their 20th Anniversary with a one-day festival
 
at Ipao Beach.
 They asked me to help them contact traditional craftspersons
 
and performers.
 I arranged a meeting between them and our Guam/Micronesia
 
Fair representatives to see how we might be able to work together and
 
not duplicate efforts already in place for the Guam/Micronesia Fair.
 
I am still planning the Folk Arts Symposium/Festival for Inarajan
 
Shores in September.
 I would like to showcase the presentations of
 
our traditional artists in Australia.
 The pageant will be presented
 
before we leave for Australia, so I feel that the traditional artists
 
should have their day during this festival.
 I haven't yet met with
 
the new owners of Inarajan Shores, but they have told the former owners
 
that they are definitely interested in continuing the Folk Arts Center
 
and the Festival.
 They have not yet physically taken over the place
 
so I haven't had a chance to meet with them
 The new owners are
 
Japanese who also own a tour company.
 This could  be an advantage as
 
far as supporting the center, however I hope they will be willing to
 
support community involvement as well.
 
Tony has been urging me to consider starting a Folk Arts Center
 
at a site in front of Guma Trankilidat -
 an old folk's residence.
 The
 
land is government land and would continue to be maintained by Parks
 
and Recreation.
 He is confident that the land could be officially
 
designated for use as a Folk Arts Center.
 It is located on Tumon Bay,
 
in the center of the island in a high tourist area and would have a
 
lot of walk-in traffic.
 As it is located right on the grounds of the
 
residences for the elderly, we could involve their expertise and those
 
of other artists in this part of the island.
 I am considering the pros
 
and cons -
 not wanting to put all my efforts into Inarajan Shores alone,
 
and yet not wanting to spread myself too thin.
 I do believe that there
 
are enough traditional artists and community groups to allow both to
 
flourish.
 Other things are happening, however, which may lead to an
 
entirely new Folk Arts Center sponsored by corporations in conjunction
 
with Guam Visitors Bureau.
 I heard of this in a passing remark at a
 
GVB meeting recently, and wrote a note to the speaker of that committee
 
 
I
 
4
 
to keep me informed.
 
More and more this year, I am finding my role to be that of facilitator
 
between organizations and agencies wanting to showcase the traditional
 
arts in various venues.
 Interest in Chamorro Folklore is flourishing.
 
I try to keep various interest groups informed as to what events are
 
happening so that efforts are not duplicated and artists are not overused.
 
While I want to encourage ways to showcase our artists, I feel like
 
I have to protect them from experiences which would leave them feeling
 
exploited.
 I like to see that events that I encourage artists to join
 
are well thought out, organized forums where their talents are appreciated.
 
One recent incident told to me by one of the Kantan Chamorrita Singers
 
brings out this point.
 She and others from the village senior citizens
 
center were asked by the local high school to perform at their culminating
 
Chamorro Week Celebration -
 an outdoor event in the village.
 Their
 
group practiced and dressed in their traditional finery and went to
 
the celebration.
 There they were hosted and fed and told to prepare
 
to perform on the stage.
 As they waited to perform after a disco number
 
on stage, a teacher called all the students to gather across the street
 
at the plaza to watch an ROTC drill performance.
 Nobody was left to
 
watch these traditional performers.
 So they left.
 
And so, with what is happening with the Folk Arts Center ideas
 
and the flourishing of traditional arts in general,  I don't feel like
 
I am leading any movement or breaking any new ground.
 My role at present
 
seems to be to keep my ears open, pick up pieces and put them together
 
and make sense out everything that is going on -
 then, to let everybody
 
know what is going on.
 
Attached is an outline of projects I would like to see take place
 
in the coming years, arranged roughly in order of this coming fiscal
 
year, 1988-89, the following year, 1989-90, and thoughts for projects
 
in general for the coming years.
 
The Apprenticeships for this year are going well.
 I see spin-offs
 
coming in other art forms expressed by masters and apprentices.
 As
 
far as I
'm able to tell, our eligibility for NEA Apprenticeship Program
 
funding has run out.
 For the coming year I would like to ask for some
 
money for apprenticeships written into my Folk Arts Coordinator's position
 
funding to allow time for Apprenticeship money to be considered in our
 
local budget appropriation.
 I would like to see folk artists working
 
more in the Artist-in-Schools program in coming years.
 This year's
 
residency in traditional Chamorro dances taught to elementary schools
 
has been very well received.
 
You will be receiving my Folk Arts Coordinator Position application
 
for 1988-89 shortly.
 I hope the attached outline will give you an idea
 
of my program planning.
 
I almost forgot to mention that Jack Lujan will finally be getting
 
some coal, thanks to Frank Hodsell.
 He has located a source of bitunimous
 
coal and sent inquiries on how to best ship it to Guam.
 I happened to
 
have shipping information right at my fingertips, because I had been working
 
on the very same problem.
 I had written June Anderson, a folklorist with

'd met at last year's Fife Conference.
 
She responded to my coal problem by getting touch with one of the blacksmiths
 
in her area and finding out his source; she then contacted freight forwarders
 
to Guam and got all the delivery information for me.
 Mr. Lujan was all ready
 
to order the coal when Frank Hodsell's good news came.
 We will do a big
 
publicity blitz when the coal arrives.
 
I hope you are able to travel with us to the 5th Pacific Festival of
 
Arts in Townsville, Australia.
 I 1oo)
forward to hearing from you.

HERE WE GO,

WE DO NOT KNO W!
 
This  i
s  the  first  issue  of a new
 
publication  which  we  hope  will  draw
 
together  people  from  a diversity  of
 
backgrounds  and  professions  who  share
 
a
 common
 interest
 in
 children's
 
folklore.
 More
 particularly,
 we
 
intend
 to
 focus
 on
 Australian
  
children's  folkore  -
-
 territory  sadly
 
neglected  despite  the  evidence  of  an
 
enduring,
 buoyant
 and
 richly
 
inventive
 '
underground'
 culture
 of
 
childhood
 in
 this
 country.
 From
 
Aboriginal
 Australia
 to
 the
 
multicultural
 Australia
 of
 today,
 
there  are  continuing  tracks  of  play
 
ways,  vulgarities,  taunts,  tricks  and
 
taboos  which  mark  out  the
'  domain  of
 
childhood.
 This  Newsletter  is  a tool
 
and  a resource  for  all  those  adults
 
with
 a
 personal
 or
 professional
 
interest in such territory.
 
We
 welcome
 contributions,
 
suggestions,
 letters
 -
 and
 of
 
course,  subscriptions.
 This  is sue  of
 
A.C.F.N.  i

,000 children's
 
playground
 rhymes,
 chants,
 games,
 
insults,
 autograph  album

 together  with
 a  number
 of

 As
 
well,  t
here  is  a section  containing
 
the Multicultural Cassette Series and
 
a collection  of  f
ield  recordings  of
 
folklore  for  children  in  Italian,
 
Greek,  Turkish,  Spanish,  Macedonian,
 
Serbo-Croation, Arabic and English.
 
All
 the  material
 centres
 on
 
CHILDREN'S  FOLKLORE  -
 both  folklore
 
OF

 and
 folklore
 FOR
 
children.
 
No such archive exists elsewhere
 
in  Australia,  although  the  National
 
Library  in  Canberra  and  the  LaTrobe
 
Library
 in
 Melbourne
 have
 some
 
original  field  r
ecordings  of  general
 
Australian  folklore.
 It  i
s  hoped
 
that  the I.E.C.D.  Collection will  be
 
a  major  national
 resource  -
within
 
Australia,
 and
 of
 interest
 to
 
folklorists overseas.

 124

In  B
ritain  in  1825,  William  Hone
 
r
i
oted  that  April  Fool's  Day  Jokers
 
t
urned  their  attention  from  buckles
 
r
i
 shoe  laces  with  the  change  in
 
oshion (Opie p
. 265).
 
Although  April  Fool's  Day  has  been
 
observed  for  centuries  in  several
 
countries,  the  actual  origin  of  the
 
custom is unknown.
 It  resembles  the
 
Hilarja  Festival  of  India  and  i
ts
 
t
iming  seems  related  to  the  vernal
 
equinox
 (March
 2
1)
 when
 nature
 
'
fools"  mankind  with  sudden  changes
 
in the weather.
 
I
f your roots are in Scotland you may
 
have
 heard  your
 nannie
 refer
 to
 
"Huntingowk  Day',  where  victims  are
 
sent
 on
 fruitless
 errands
 to
 
hunt-the-gowk  (or  cuckoo  bird)  -
 a
 
similar
 request
 to
 asking
 the
 
apprentice for the left-handed hammer
 
or more elbow grease.
 
In Melbourne  on April 1st,  1981,  we
 
found
 that
 children
 are
 still
 
actively  involved  in  the  old  tricks
 
t
hat mark this special day.  Although
 
not  confined  to  the  child's  domain,
 
this age old practice  b
ears  the mark
 
of
 children's
 folklore
 in
 i
ts
 
mysterious  talent  to  preserve  and
 
resurrect old tricks  and taunts,  and
 
then  promptly  bury  them  again  till
 
next year.
 
According
 to
 many
 adults,
 April
 
Fool's  Day  i
s  a thing  of  the  past.
 
J
e set out to f
ind if indeed this was
 
the
 case.
 With
 ears
 to
 the
 
playground
 we
 found
 that
 the
 
traditional  practices  appear  to  be
 
alive,  well  and  flourishing  -
 at
 
l
east  in  downtown  Clifton  Hill  and
 
out of t
own Doncaster, Melbourne, and
 
we  suspect  in  sites  urban,  suburban
 
and  rural  throughout  the  country.
 
This  is  the  one  day  when  people
 
suff
 tried and  true  old  j
okes  f
or
 
half a day (no tricks after twelve or
 
You're t
he April Fool -
 althou gh this
 
i
s disputed by some
 who say notes can
 
b
e
 pinned
 on
 backs
 in
 the
 
afternoon) .
 
"
Your  shoe L
ace  i
s  undone'  was
 
the  most  popular  t
aunt  at  Spensley
 
Street Primary S
chool  (Clifton Hill)
 
in  1981,  as  i
t  was  found  to  be  in
 
1825  by  More,  and  throughout  the
 
1
950's in  the  British  I
sles  by  boa
 
and Pete  Opie.
 O
ther  common  t
ricks
 
include:  "There's  a spider  on  your
 
back,  head,  arm  .. . ";
 sending  the
 
unsuspecting  on  f
alse  errands;  and
 
above
 all
 tricking
 parents
 and
 
teachers.
 
We  found  fake  broken  arms  at
 
Clifton Hill and Doncaster,  and also
 
spur  of  the  moment  tricks,  such  a
 
catching the investigators by telling
 
us  '
Sur  tape  r
ecorder  had  stopped.
 
(Yes
 -
 we
 were
 caught!.)
 One  
variation  we  found  was  the  calling
 
out of "April Fool's Day" rather than
 
"April  Fool"  or  "
You're  an  April
 
Fool"
 (noted
 by
 the
 Opies
 and
 
remembered by the writers).
 
Some of the t
ricks are described
 
here  by  the  children  in  their  own
 
words:
 
We
 all
 s
tumbled
 into
 the
 
classroom, and the boys all had
 
some  type or size of  an
 April
 
Fools" trick.
 
The first one that caught my eye
 
was a (plastic) piece of doggy's
 
"poo".
 This  was  put  on  Miss
 
.
...'s  table  on  her  plans  for
 
the day.
 She screamed and very
 
disgustingly  wrote  our  writing
 
on the board.
 
This was the writing that was on
 
the  board!!!"
 "The  government
 
have  decided  that  all  children
 
have
 to
 attend
 school
 on
 
Saturday  Mornings
 to
 improve
 
their  Mathematics  and  Spelling
 
Skills".
 As
 we
 were
 very
 
surprised  at  how we were  going
 
to
 fit
 it
 in
 we
 started
 
chatting,
 the  teacher  clapped
 
her hands and yelled.
 
Then Scott had a bandage around
 
his arm and he kept complaining
 
about  it.
 But  he  took  it  off
 
later in the afternoon.
 
Then there was a boy, his sister
 
put make-up on his  eye  to  make
 
it look like a black eye and it
 
really looked real.

The  Colonial  Child is  an  inmensely
 
valuable contribution  t
o  our  slender
 
knowledge  of  Australian  children  in
 
the  colonial  era.
 There  are  eight
 
papers on various a
spects of colonial
 
children's l
ife, dealing with health,
 
music, books,  home life and  the  l
ife
 
of
 the
 '
outcast
 children
 in
 
Marvellous  Melbourne',  described  by
 
Chris  McConville.
 The aut
hors  are  
well-known,  and  i
nclude  K.S.  Inglis,
 
Margarat  Ingham,  Gwen  Jones,  Robert
 
Southby,  Robin  S

e
 
particularly
 interested
 in
 June
 
Factor's
 paper,
 '
Fragments
 of
 
Children's
 play
 in
 Colonial
 
Australia'.
 
The  Colonial  Child was  r
eviewed  by
 
Michael Cannon in t
he Melbourne  'Age'
 
of July 4th,  1981,  and  I take  i
ssue
 
with  his  review  of  June  Factor's
 
contributio n.
 
(C ontin ued)

last
 century
 
approaching  the
 
known
 by  most
 
includes  '
children's games'  among  the
 
'
simple delights  . .
.
 available only to
 
a favoured minority of children..'
 
The Colonial Child (
continued)
 
Cannon s
tates that she emphasises that
 
'
only  middle-class  children'  of  the
 
enjoyed
 anything
 
l
eisure  and  freedom
 
children
 today  and
 
Michael  Cannon's  comments  fail  to  do
 
justice
 either
 to
 children,
 the
 
colonial  poor,  or  to  June  Factor's
 
article.
 Indeed,
 June
 Factor
 
expresses  a  strong  sense  of  wonder
 
that  so  much  elaborate  play  existed
 
among
 children
 even
 under
 harsh
 
conditions.
 Cannon  might  well  have
 
quoted her extracts  from Mundy (
1846)
 
about the 'milkboy' and the 'vegetable
 
lad'
 and
 their
 impromptu
 street
 
cricket,  or  the  dolls made  from  pegs
 
or  pieces  of  tree  roots.
 He  might
 
also  have  quoted  her  reference  to
 
Victor  Daley writing  in  The  Bulletin
  
in
 1898
 about
 the
 prevalence
 of
 
traditional singing games amond Sydney
 
girls -
 and their local variants,  for
 
example:
 
Johnny  and  Jane  and  Jack  and
 
Lou,
 
Butler's Stairs through
 
Woolootnooloo;
 
Wooloomooioo
 and
 cross
 the
 
Domain;
 
Round the Block and home again!
 
cigh ho! Tipsy toe,
 
ive us a kiss and away we go.
 
rbal  play  and  humour  in  particular
 
urvive under the harshest conditions,

1d traditional games and r
outines are
 
handed down orally from generation t
o
 
generation.
 Even
 the
 country
 
schoolchildren  about  to  be  '
softened
 
and  humanised'
 by  school  music  as
 
described in Robin Stevens' article in
 
The  Colonial  Child were  said  to  be
 
'
engaging in rude horse play . .
.
 (and)
 
indelicate
 familiarities'
.
 The
 
i
ndelicate familiarities may well have
 
i
ncluded
 predecessors
 of
 the
 vast
 
repertoire of sexual  and  scatalogical
 
rhymes  and  jokes  transmitted  orally
 
amongst
 pre-adolescent
 children
 
(Lowenstein 1
974).
 
As  f
or  '
rude h
orse p
lay': versions o
f
 
the game  '
Buck buck'
,
 which involves
 
jumping  on  one's  peers'  backs  has
 
been  recorded  in  Brisbane  in  1979
 
(Lindsay & Palmer) and in Nero's Rome
 
(Tylor 1871).  There i
s no suggestion
 
in  either  case  that  only  '
favoured
 
children' were players!

ITUTE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT
 
3 July, 1984
 
Dr Bess Lomax Hawes,
 
National Endowment for the Arts,
 
Folkarts Program,
 
2401E Street,
 
NW WASHINGTON DC 20506
  
Dear Dr Lomax Hawes,
 
I am sorry I haven't writLen to you sooner, but in the local dialect I have
 
been flat out like the proverbial lizard -
 that is .
I have been overloaded
 
with work and barely keeping up!
 Since I met you in Washington in 1983
 
I have had a couple of books published, given what seems to be an endless
 
stream of papers and talks, and of course, gone on with my tertiary teaching.
 
So perhaps you will understand my negligence as far as letter writing goes.
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you, as I had heard a great deal about you
 
and had read some of your work previously.
 It is very interesting for an
 
Australian to observe the way in which fcc arts are funded in the USA, and
 
encouraging too.
 Here in Australia, we are only beginning to persuade our
 
Governments that folklore is worthy of financial support.
 However, beginnings
 
are being made and later this year (November 23-25)  there will be a National
 
Folklore Conference in Melbourne.
 Part of this Conference will focus on
 
Children's Folklore -
 my particular area of interest, as you may remember -
 
and we are hoping that Doctor Dorothy Howard, who came to this country as a
 
post-doctoral Fulbright Scholar in 1954-55, will be able to attend.
 She is
 
now eighty-one but the most vibrant and up-to-date eighty-one I have ever met.
 
She will be a great hit!
 I believe that there is also a chance that Doctor
 
Kenny Goldstein will be able to come  (from the University of Pennsylvania)  and
 
I have just written to Brian Sutton-Smith to try to persuade him to make it a
 
hat trick and come as well.
 If there is any chance of your visiting the
 
antipodes at that time we would be delighted to include you in the programme
 
Your experience and expertise both in children's folklore and in the general
 
area of the organization and funding of the folk arts would be of immense
 
value to us all.
 
I thought you might gain some pleasure from the little book4 I am sending you;
 
which I produced as a sort of thank you to the children who have provided me
 
with so much material of interest over the years.
 It has done extremely well -
 
it is now into its third printing -
 so there must be a lot of children who like
 
to read their own verses, jokes and games.
 As far as I know, the teachers are
 
not turning it into some dreadful pedagogic text -
 for which small mercy I am
 
most thankful.
 I would be interested to hear of any work that is going on
 
presently in the USA concerning children's folklore, and if there is any Australian
 
material that you would like to receive, I would be very happy to send it to you.
 
Lth kind regards,
 
June ' actor

GPO BOX 1252, CANBERRA, ACT 2601. TELEPHONE 467211 TELEX AA62960
 
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
 
Ms E.  Lomax Hawes
 
Director
 
Folk Arts Program
 
National Endowment for the Arts
 
1100 Pennsylvania Avenue N. W.
 
WASHINGTON D.C.
 20506
 
USA
 
Dear Ms Lomax Hawes
 
I am writing to follow up our discussion during my visit to
 
Washington DC  in April  1986.
 
During our conversation you mentioned your planned visit  to Port
 
Moresby  in 1988  to attend a conference and we discussed  the
 
possibility of your travelling to Australia.
 
If your  itinerary  is sufficiently flexible my Department would be
 
pleased to arrange appointments  for you to meet with officers of
 
the relevant arts and heritage bodies  in Sydney and Canberra.
 
These might  include discussions with the General Manager,
 
multicultural officers and members of the relevant boards of  the
 
Australia Council;  representatives of the Australian Folk Trust;
 
Directors of the National Museum of Australia and the Australian
 
Heritage Commission;  appropriate officers of the National Library
 
of Australia and officers of my Department with  responsibility
 
for folklife and heritage programs.
 
The Department would,  of course,  meet  the related  travel and
 
accommodation costs.
 I would be pleased  if you could  let me know
 
if you are  interested  in my proposal.
 
As you will be aware from your meeting with Ms Gwenda Davey last
 
year,  the Minister for Arts,  Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen,
 
established the Inquiry  into Folklife  in Australia  in March 1986.
 
The Committee,  of which Ms Davey and Dr McKenry  (with whom you
 
net  in 1985)  are members,  is due to report soon to Mr Cohen.
 
In the climate created by the  Inquiry and  in Australia's
 
Bicentenary year, your views on the American experience of
 
folklife matters would be most valuable.
 
I believe that Mr Max Bourke,  formerly a senior officer of  the
 
Department and now General Manager of the Australia Council,  had
 
a fruitful discussion with you during his visit to Washington  in
 
November  1986.
 I read  the  report of his  trip with great
 
interest.
 
I look forward  to hearing  from you  in the near future.
 
Yours sincerely
 
P.J.
 "

Secretary
