May 20, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to H.M. Bond
May 20, 1943 Dr. H. M. Bond, President The Fort Valley State College Fort Valley,
Georgia
Dear Dr. Bond:
Thank you for your letter of May 4. We shall be glad to extend the Fort Valley project to
June 30. If possible, I should like to hear from Dr. James regarding plans for completing
the work.
By now you have received the copy of the first eight records. I went over the titles and
sources with Lewis Jones, but should be glad to have Dr. James check them and send me
his emendations.
With best wishes,
Faithfully yours, B. A. Botkin Assistant-in-Charge Archive of American Folk Song
