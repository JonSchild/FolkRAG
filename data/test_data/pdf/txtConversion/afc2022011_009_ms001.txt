Interviewee in English:   Back in the day, there was hardly any thread. Only a few 
people could get access to commercial thread. I still remember 
seeing the elderly women scraping the inner layers of the 
banana plant to get the fibers. They were good at scraping and 
making the fibers. They would throw away the banana layers 
that they had already torn fibers from. When these dried, I 
would take them and make a toy loom and weave. From doing 
2 
 
this, I learned little by little how to weave, but I had not yet 
learned the warping part.   
 
When I grew up a little, thread became more available. I 
observed the ladies when they were weaving, especially when 
I liked the colors that they used. I would ask them to show me 
how to make the warp, and then they would let me use their 
warping board and learn the process.  When I felt that I could 
do one on my own, I started one and did  what I had learned 
from the women that let me practice with theirs.  After the first 
lavalava I wove, I became more confident, so I started weaving 
without calling people to help me. 
 
02:46 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Ulithian:  Lol yam luluwal, itei semal le ye kael yam fel ngali irel yam fefaru doh deur hare 
yam deduer doh?  Bo mada fal? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
03:05 Yai dedeur sa loh ye la wolmiril ngo Lourdes Lamog

mulwe, hafasul fel fangal, habisbis iwe ngo idipli mala habe 
rumal yamem yengang sew. 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
Lourdes Lamog is a lady that is now residing in the United 
States, and she is the person I associate with weaving.  I saw 
that she had the intention to help me learn weaving.  Then, she 
left and went to the States.  So, Modesta and I started weaving 
together.  We helped and taught each other  when problems 
arose.  I had a close relationship with her because she was my 
younger cousin, and we were used to each other and loved 
working together. 
03:51 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you? 
A.   Ulithi: Mada mele dedeur ye kael yal palengpelal ngalug iyang? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
04:02 Ye paling pelal ngal yei bo ila mala sew peteg paling

need le sibe faru ngo deur mele sifafang iyang. 
 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
Yes, it’s very important because that is one thing in our culture 
that we use for almost every matter that happens in our 
community. I use them when there’s a funeral, and for other 
matters that happen in the community.  I use them as my 
clothing, and I give them to my parents, as well. I like to make 
them so that, when any of my sisters come from far away I am 
happy that she has come back, I can give her one. That’s why 
I learned how to weave, because it’s something that is very 
important to our livelihood. Almost everything that happens 
requires lavalava. 
05:05  Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you? 
A.   Ulithi:  Ifa sangal yal deur mo dedeur susuwel doh irel yam bubudoh yesa holadoh igla? 
Hare sa change tangi yathkawe ho k’kai mor irel sensei kala yam? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
05:24 Sa paling paling yal change. Ralakawe le bala mwol sew

hohoyu ngo ye mos ngo siya tobtob siya… sa bubudoh ye

so hare 1 week chog sa mwol se hapop pitgil deur sa tir farul 
irel mele sa mommai tools ka yarmat resa taptap igla. Ila mele 
ye paling yal change iyang. 
Interviewee in English: 
There have been so many changes in our weaving today 
compared to back in the old days. Weaving one lavalava with 
natural fibers used to take about 2 to 3 weeks to finish 
because it’s time consuming to prepare the fibers, and while 
weaving the fibers will keep breaking, so we will have to 
continuously keep on reconnecting them. Nowadays, it’s much 
easier and faster with the commercial thread. Also, the tools 
for the loom, back in the old days, it would take so long to 
finish a weaving sword or other weaving tools. Nowadays, with 
these new and good tools that have been introduced to us, 
someone can finish carving the tools in a week or so. That’s a 
big change. 
  
06:21 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her?

Interviewee English: 
I would tell my great-great-granddaughter to come and sit 
down so I can teach her how to start warping, and to do the 
warping until she knows. Then, I would teach her how to 
weave until she knows. When she reaches the time when she 
will wear lavalava, she would already be able to pick the colors 
she likes and weave her own lavalava. Also, she would be able 
to weave if something happens in the family or the community, 
and she would be able to help.
