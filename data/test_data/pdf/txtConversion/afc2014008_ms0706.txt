During t
he l
ate t
hirties and early f
orties, s
ome members o
f t
he American l
eft
 
saw t
he potential i
n using f
olk and t
opical music as an i
nstrument f
or s
ocial
 
change. This c
oncept was hardly new -
-
 a
 generation earlier Joe Hill and Ralph
 
Chaplin r
efashioned t
raditional s
ongs and hymns i
nto b
iting anthems f
or t
he
 
I
ndustrial Workers o
f t
he World. A
lthough t
raditional Southern protest s
ingers
 
l
ike Aunt Molly Jackson and J
im Garland caught t
he a
ttention o
f t
he
 
Communist press as early as 1931, early American Communist music was
 
l
inked t
o such European c
omposers a
s Hanns E
isler, E
lie S
iegmeister and
 
Bertolt Brecht. However, t
his Germanic approach was a
lien t
o most American
 
workers. A
lthough e
thnic music t
raditions r
emained s
trong, t
he average worker
 
was more l
ikely t
o r
espond t
o t
he c
ountry o
r popular music heard on r
adio,
 
r
ecords and f
i
lm.
 
Development o
f a
 new "
people's music" paralleled a
 g
rowing urban aware-
ness o
f American t
raditional music. John Lomax's early s
ong c
ollections
 
a
lready spurred academic i
nterest i
n American f
olk cultures. Carl Sandburg's
 
c
ollege r
eadings nearly a
lways i
ncluded programs o
f f
olk s
ongs. Paul Robeson
 
and Marian Anderson won c
ritical praise f
or t
heir s
ensitive i
nterpretations o
f
 
spirituals. I
n 1931 Tex R
itter i
ntroduced Western ballads t
o Broadway
 
audiences i
n Green Grow t
he L
ilacs. John and A
lan Lomax brought Louisiana
 
s
ongster Huddie Ledbetter t
o eastern c
olleges. Cabaret T
.A.C., an a
fter-hours
 
New York r
evue, f
eatured A
lfred Hays and Earl Robinson's "
Joe Hill" and f
olk-
s
tyled performances by actor Tony Kraber. New Masses, a
 l
eftist magazine,
 
underwrote t
he f
irst F
lrom Spirituals t
o Swing c
oncert a
t Carnegie Hall. These
 
1938-39 concerts i
ntermingled Big B
ill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Mitchell's
 
Christian S
ingers with Benny Goodman and Count Basie.
 
By t
he l
ate twenties, s
ome New York-based s
ongwriters were c
rafting t
opical
 
s
ongs within f
olk-styled i
dioms. Two t
ransplanted Southerners -
- Carson
 
Robison and Bob Miller -
-
 were two o
f t
he most successful writers i
n t
his genre.
 
Millers s
ongs of
ten dealt with populist i
ssues; h
is "
'Leven Cent Cotton and
 
Forty Cent Meat" and "Farmers Letter t
o t
he President" were precursors o
f t
he
 
People's Songs movement. Miller l
ater published and promoted t
he music o
f
 
l
eftist writers, most notably Earl Robinson and t
he A
lmanac S
ingers.
 
The a
ttempt t
o unify workers t
hrough a
 "
people's music" proved t
o be a
 
noble but u
ltimately unsuccessful experiment. Many f
actors were t
o b
lame,
 
i
ncluding anti-Communist hysteria, l
ack o
f l
abor unions' i
nterest and workers'
 
preference o
f mainstream pop culture. I
ronically, t
heir ef
forts d
id have an
 
1
 
I
f
 
important impact -
- t
he popularization o
f American f
olk music and t
he c
reation
 
o
f a
 d
istinctive musical s
tyle.
 
The o
riginal A
lmanac S
ingers -
- Pete Seeger, Millard Lampell, Lee Hays and
 
Peter Hawes -
- s
olidified t
he s
tyle and a
ttitude t
hat would t
ypify t
he f
olk
 
r
evival. Using l
abor s
ongs and Southern r
ural music as t
heir r
eference points,
 
t
his l
oose-knit, New York-based g
roup s
ounded l
ike no one e
lse before t
he m.
 
Their youthful enthusias m and i
ngenious, t
hought-provoking l
yrics had
 
enormous impact on a
 generation o
f young musicians. S
inging i
n natural,
 
unaffected voices and driven by Seeger
's c
lawha mmer banjo, t
he A
lmanacs
 
made f
olk music c
o me a
live t
o many l
i
steners. C
lassical approaches t
o balladry
 
s
eemed s
tuffy and o
ld-fashioned by c
o mparison.
 
The A
l manacs made t
heir i
nitial r
ecordings i
n March 1941, a
 t
ime when
 
i
nterest and awareness i
n American f
olk music and dance was s
trong. Burl
 
I
ves and Josh White, who both had New York t
heatrical experience, f
ashioned
 
personas and r
epertoires t
hat appealed t
o mass audiences. The man most
 
r
esponsible f
or supplying t
heir material and shaping t
heir images was f
olklorist
 
A
lan Lo max. Lo max r
ecognized t
hat s
tylists l
ike White and I
ves would help t
o
 
i
ntroduce Northern urban audiences t
o t
raditional music. Because r
adio,
 
r
ecords and f
i
lm were a
ffecting t
raditional r
ural cultures, he r
ecognized t
hat
 
t
he music's survival depended on urban channels.
 
Lo max supported t
he A
lmanac S
ingers i
n much t
he same way, l
ining up
 
engagements, supplying t
raditional s
ongs and arranging r
ecording s
essions. He
 
had known Pete Seeger f
or years; Seeger
's musicologist f
ather, Charles, was
 
one o
f h
is mentors. However, unlike White and I
ves, Seeger and t
he A
l manacs
 
were not i
nterested i
n show business. A
lthough t
hey appeared on r
adio and i
n
 
n
ightclubs, t
he A
lmanacs were most c
o mfortable i
n f
ront o
f sympathetic
 
gatherings -
- private f
olksings, union halls and party meetings. Other members
 
moved i
n and out o
f t
he g
roup, most notably Woody Guthrie, Agnes '
Sis'
 
Cunningham, Bess Lo max and Arthur Stern. "Almanac" even beca me a
 
c
oncept. An A
l manac P
layers t
heatrical t
roupe was f
ormed; a
 satellite A
lmanac
 
S
ingers was l
aunched i
n Detroit.
 
The A
lmanacs' concepts, i
deologies and musical s
ound l
asted l
ong past t
he
 
g
roup's d
isintegration. Other g
roups built upon t
heir model, particularly t
he
 
Headline S
ingers and t
he Priority Ra mblers. A
lan Lo max assembled t
he Union
 
Boys, an "
all-star" g
roup, f
or a 1944 Asch s
ession.
 
I
n Dece mber 1945 Seeger and a
 g
roup o
f New York-based performers and
 
s
ocial activists c
reated People's Songs, I
nc. I
ts purpose was t
o unify a
 d
iverse
 
body o
f s
ingers, s
ongwriters, political activists, l
abor o
rganizers and t
heatrical
 
artists i
nto a
 musical outlet f
or s
ocial change. At i
ts peak, t
he movement had
 
branches i
n f
i
fteen American c
ities and Toronto, and held national membership
 
c
onventions. I
ts monthly magazine, People's Songs, s
erved as a
 c
learinghouse
 
f
or new and t
raditional s
ongs and gave i
nformation about s
ongwriters,
 
performers and various activities. The o
rganization's i
nvolvement i
n Henry
 
Wallace's 1948 t
hird-party presidential campaign drained i
ts f
inances; i
t
 f
olded
 
i
n early 1949.

After t
he demise o
f People's Songs, an a
ff
iliated o
rganization, People's
 
Artists, c
ontinued t
o sponsor c
oncerts, book artists and promote new s
ongs. I
t
 
a
lso l
aunched a
 new, l
ess-ambitious magazine, S
ing Outl However, much o
f t
he
 
enthusiasm t
hat f
ueled t
he o
riginal movement had d
issipated. The specter o
f
 
t
he House Committee on Un-American Activities cast a
 shadow over t
he
 
o
rganization. A
 b
loody 1949 r
iot a
t a
 Paul Robeson c
oncert i
n Peekskill, NY,
 
underscored t
he l
eft's i
nability t
o win over b
lue-collar workers.
 
Even Seeger h
imself was unable t
o devote much t
ime t
o People's Artists. His
 
performing g
roup, t
he Weavers, had a
 s
eries o
f h
it c
ommercial r
ecords i
n 1950
 
t
o 1952 t
hat brought national a
cclaim. Their success g
enerated c
riticism f
rom
 
s
ome c
ircles, who c
laimed t
hey "
sold out' by abandoning t
he l
eft. I
n t
he early
 
f
i
fties S
ing Outl editor I
rwin S
ilber r
esponded t
o t
his by i
ssuing political r
ecords
 
by f
ormer People's Songsters Ernie L
ieberman, Hope Foye, Betty Saunders and
 
o
thers.
 
The performers who f
ollowed i
n t
he Weavers' f
ootsteps were not musically
 
d
ifferent f
rom Earl Robinson, t
he A
lmanac S
ingers, o
r any o
f t
he People's
 
Songsters. But t
he r
adicalism and i
dealism were gone.
 
The A
lmanac S
ingers and t
heir peers shaped an l
asting American musical
 
s
tyle, just as t
he Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong, J
immie
 
Rodgers, B
ill Monroe, Charlie Parker, Muddy Waters and E
lvis Presley had. But
 
unlike t
he r
ecordings o
f t
hose p
ioneers and t

The s
cattershot way t

To keep t

. Paul Robeson and Mark

f t

 s

ef

f
 a
 c
opy can be f

f Earl Robinson and Harold Schacter
 s
 "Spring Song" should be

Robeson may be r

is r

B
litzstein a
imed h
is musicals Vie Cradle Will Rock and No
 for an Answer a
t
 
an urban i

re milestones i
n l
eftist t
heater, but had
 
no d
irect musical i
nf
luence on t
he early f
olk r
evivalists.
 
Populist cantatas and r
adio productions, such as Earl Robinson and John
 
Latouche's Ba l
nd 
for Americans, Robinson and Millard Lampell's 7
7ie Lonesome
 
Train, and A

 s
 The Martin and t
he Coys a

re l

eave l
i
ttle r
oom
 
f
or o
ther worthy r

Because only 75 minutes o
f material will f
i
t onto a
 c
ompact d
isc, we must
 
l
imit t
he nu mber o
f r
ecordings by c
ertain a
rtists, particularly i
f
 t
heir work i
s
 
r
eadily available e
lsewhere. Woody Guthrie, f
or example, was one o
f t
he most
 
i
nf
luential s
ingers o
f t
he period. His arrival i
n New York and 1940 a
lbum Dust
 
Bowl Bollnds had enormous impact on t
he b
lossoming f
olk s

f
 
h
is work i
s i

n addition, no s

isc--either here o
r e
lsewhere--can
 
do justice t
o t
he s
tyle and r
epertoire o
f s
omeone as c
omplex as Guthrie.
 
By minimizing t
he number o
f Guthrie performances i
n t
his box we can
 
c
oncentrate on artists whose work i
s l
ess l
ikely t
o s
ee r

Guthrie will be
 
r
epresented by 18 performances with t
he A
lmanac S

everal World

I

hat Guthrie will be better s

A
lthough Huddle Ledbetter (
Leadbelly) of
ten performed a
t l
eftist f
unctions
 
and t
ailored songs f
or t
hat audience, he was not a
 political activist. A

Unfortunately, s

■ Oscar Brand. Brand belonged t
o People's Songs, and h
is r
adio shows
 
helped i
ntroduce f
olk music t
o a
 wide audience. Brand's major passion r
ested
 
i
n f
olk music i
tself -
-
 not political philosophies. Politically, he was -
- and i

- a

AT

is unwillingness t
o sub mit t
o anyone's artistic c
ontrol made h

f

Brand began r
ecording i
n 1946, but apparently none o
f h
is early s
ides
 
r
eflect t
he a
ttitudes o
f t
he People's Songs movement. (
He may appear
 
anonymously on t
he 1947 s
ides made f
or t
he National Maritime Union.)
 
■ Bob and Adrienne Claiborne. The l
ate Bob C
laiborne was a
 f
ounding
 
member o
f People's Songs, I
nc.; he and h
is wife, Adrienne, were f
requent
 
c
ontributors t
o i
ts publication. He appears with Pete Seeger on Hy Zaret
's "OPA
 
Shout," r
ecorded by Moe Asch i
n 1946 f
or s
oundtruck use. The C
laibornes
 
t
ogether appear on a 1948 ho me r
ecording, "Nu mber One S
tooge", but i
ts
 
c
ontent, condition and quality i
s not yet known.
 
■
 Walde mar "Wally" Hille. Hille was one o
f t
he most active members o
f t
he
 
People's Songs o
rganization, both as a
 c
o mposer and a
s t
he l
ibrarian and
 
music editor f
or i
ts monthly publication. I
f
 he made any r
ecordings, none have
 
surfaced.
 
■ Cisco Houston. Houston's participation i
n t
he early l
eftist f
olk culture
 
was probably minimal. He a
llegedly sang with a
 version o
f t
he A
lmanacs, and
 
t
raveled with Woody Guthrie and actor Will Geer. While apparently supportive
 
o
f l
eftist causes, Houston usually s
tayed i
n Guthrie's shadow. When he
 
c
ontributed an article and a
 t
raditional s
ong t
o a
 l
ate i
ssue o
f People's Songs,
 
an editor prefaced t
he page with an i
ntroductory description.
 
Except f
or a
 c
over o
f Guthrie's "Hard Travelin'," Houston's early s
olo
 
r
ecordings are a
ll t
raditional f
olk and c
owboy s
ongs. I
n t
his collection he s
ings
 
harmony on s
everal wartime Woody Guthrie r
ecordings.
 
■ Alan Lo max. Lo max i
s possibly t
he s
ingle most important f
igure i
n t
he
 
f
olk r
evival. A
lthough known more f
or h
is work as a
 f
olklorist, he nurtured and
 
encouraged v
irtually every performer associated with t
he pre-war New York f
olk
 
s
cene. He l
ater helped o
rganize People's Songs and actively campaigned f
or
 
Wallace-Taylor i
n 1948. Unfortunately, Lo max r
arely r
ecorded as a
 performer
 
i
n t
he '
40s. He contributes a
 s
olo vocal t
o one verse o
f t
he Union Boys' "The
 
Martins and t
he Coys." He a
lso speaks on a
 Wal
lace ca mpaign r
ecording,
 
"Yankee Doodle."
 
■ Other omissions. Not surprisingly, t
he bulk o
f t
he surviving People's
 
Songs r
ecordings c
o me f
ro m New York. Thanks t
o Mario Casetta, we have
 
r
epresentative r
ecordings by s
o me Los Angeles-based performers. However,
 
r
ecords f
ro m o
ther People's Songs o

are. The New York o
ffice r
eceived
 
ho me r
ecordings f
ro m members t
hroughout t
he country, but f
ew o
f t
hese
 
acetates survive.
 
As a
 r
esult, we are missing r
epresentative l
ate '
40s political s
ides by two key
 
Chicago me mbers, Win S
tracke and B
ig Bill Broonzy. (
Broonzy d

ecord h
is
 
"Black, Brown and White" f
or Mercury, but i
t
 was i
n 1951--two years a
fter
 
People's Songs f

ong t
o co me out o
f t
he Chicago
 
o
ffice, "Passing Through," survives on a
 ho me r
ecording made by i
ts c
o mposer,
 
Dick B
lakeslee.
 
Other missing People's Songs performers i
nclude- L
illian "Hootenlil" Marcus,
 
Toronto; and Bryant French and Norm Berman, C
leveland. No English-
l
anguage r

We hope t

IMPORTANCE: An a

evue designed t
o r
aise f
unds f
or r
eturning
 
L
incoln Brigade veterans f
ro m the Spanish Civil War. The performers and
 
the songs f
requently changed during the cabaret's run. "Abe L
incoln" and
 
"Joe Hill" were f
eatured i
n the f
irst edition o
f this show. (
Publisher Bob
 
Miller l
ater had "Abe L
incoln" i
nterpolated i
n the manic Olson and Johnson
 
r
evue Hellzapoppin' [
1938-40)). Robinson wrote "Abe L
incoln" i
n a
 theatrical
 
s
tyle and "Joe Hill" i
n a
 contrasting f
olk s
tyle.
 
Michael Loring was a
 cantor who l
ater was active i
n the Portland, Ore.,
 
People's Songs o
ff
ice. He currently l
ives i
n Tolovana Park, Oregon.
 
Tony Kraber
's "Old Paint" i
s an early example o
f a
 f
olk-styled performance
 
i
n a
 l
eftist theatrical presentation. (
Folk-styled performances were heard on
 
Broadway a
t l
east as early as 1931, when Tex Ritter sang Western songs i
n
 
Green Grow t
he L
ilnrs. Kraber would even r
ecord that p
lay's t
itle song f
or
 
Keynote i
n the early '
40s.) The matrix nu mber o
f "Old Paint" implies this
 
was not a
 T
.A.C. master but an early Keynote r
ecording f
ro m l
ate 1939.
 
Keynote owner Eric Bernay possibly thought the t
imely, l
ocalised l
yrics o
f
 
"Swing T
.A.C." made i
t unsuitable f
or r
erelease.
 
A 1947 i

f People's Songs said that "Picketline Priscilla" was r
ecorded
 
i
n 1939.

According t
o c
ollector R
ichard Markow, Labor Arts' owner i
s Ethel Polk, who
 
currently l
ives i
n Chicago. B
ill Friedland, however, does not know her.
 
Opinions d
iffer a
s t
o whether Joe Glazer should appear i
n t
his c
ollection.
 
Politically, he was opposed t
o t
he r
adical l
ef
t. Most o
f h
is a
ctivities were
 
done outside o
f t
he g
rowing urban f
olk r
evival. At t
he same t
ime, Glazer may
 
prefer not t
o appear on an anthology s
o heavily weighted t
oward a
 political
 
philosophy he f
inds objectionable.
 
However, Glazer r
emains a
 major f
igure i
n c
ontemporary American l
abor
 
s
ong. Glazer and Friedland's Songs
 for Sectarians provide a
 r
evealing,
 
a
lternative perspective t
o l
eftist politics o
f t
he e
ra. Some--if not a
ll--of t
hese
 
s
ides should be i
ncluded here.
 
TEXAS BILL STRENGTH
 
Archie Green suggested t
his c
ollection c
lose with Texas B
ill Strength's
 
r
ecording o
f "We Shall Overcome." Strength, who apparently l
earned t
he
 
s
ong f
rom a
 Joe Glazer r
ecord, r
ecorded i
t
 i
n t
he Four S
tar s
tudios, c
. 1953.
 
Originally privately pressed f
or Strength, t
he r
ecord apparently was r
e-
r
eleased f
or general d
istribution on t

tar l

Who owns t
