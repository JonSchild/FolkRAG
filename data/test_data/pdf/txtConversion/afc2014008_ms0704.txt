Dear Mr. Omas:
 
January 20,  1
984
 
In your i
nquiry of November 9 and subsequent t
elephone
 
conversation, you raise three questions concerning square
 
dancing in the United States:
 
1
/ Does the square dance historically represent U.S. dance?
 
2
/ Have any other nations of the world given official recognition
 
to a t
raditional dance such as that accorded by Public Law 9
7-188 to
 
the square dance?
 
3
/ What are the pros and cons of making the s
quare dance t
he
 
national dance i
n perpetuity?
 
I
 
The quality and extent of the scholarly l
iterature r
egarding the
 
history o
f square dance do not permit a s
imple yes/no r
esponse t
o your
 
f
irst question.  As Margaret Owen writes in her r
eport t
o the American
 
Folklife Center, Dance Traditions in the Blue Ridge (
1980, u
npub-
l
ished),  "Traditional, or folk, dance has received very l
ittle
 
scholarly t
reatment i
n t
he past and American folk dance has b
een
 
•
 virtually ignored" (p.  1
).  A special problem l
imiting the quality of
 
�
•
 r
esearch i
n dance has b
een the absence, until r
elatively r
ecently, of
 
any means o
f dance notation. Thus early printed accounts of dances that
 
s
eem t
o r
esemble s
quare dance must b
e interpreted cautiously.  While
 
certain gross generalities may b
e satisfactorily c
ommunicated i
n prose
 
—  number o
f c
ouples, caller, f
igures —  i
t i
s entirely p
ossible that,
 
should we look in upon one o
f those early "
square dances", what we
 
would s
ee might s
eem most unfamiliar.  The l
imitation of verbal
 
description for matters of this sort can be appreciated i
f we consider
 
that a Beethoven symphony and a Schoenberg symphony might s
ound much
 
alike on the printed page, but sound very different in the concert
 
hall.

In t
erms of sheer numbers of participants, the form of square
 
dance that heads the list in the United States today i
s the variety
 
known variously as "Western Square Dance,"
 "Modern Square Dance,"
 
"Club Dancing," or more recently, "American Square Dance."
 I
t must be
 
understood at the outset that this i
s not a folk cultural activity.
 
American Square Dance i
s a phenomenon of mass, national, popular
 
culture.
 In his 1
977 book A Time to Dance (New York:  S
t. Martin's
 
Press), Richard Nevell says that square dance clubs boast six million
 
members and that the 1
976 Annual Square Dance Convention drew 36,000
 
dancers (p. 205). To what degree does this enormously vital expression
 
of contemporary popular culture embody the forms of folk dance
 
tradition?
 
"The simple  '
cowboy dances' enjoyed by early p
ioneers i
n the
 
American West have been altered drastically," Nevell writes
 
(p. 2
25).  The most obvious indicators of this change are:
 
1
/ The adoption of uniform costumes
 
2
/ The substitution of recorded music for l
ive bands
 
3/ The introduction of professional callers
 
4/ Change in three aspects of dance movements:
 
a
) elimination of local variation in favor of
 
standards
 
b) vast increase in complexity, e
.g. multiplication
 
of basic figures from approximately two dozen to
 
nearly a hundred.
 
•
 
c
) polished execution of the movements attributable
 
to formalized instruction (leading to a Bachelor
 
of Square Dancing diploma), and adherence to
 
rules and regulations such as those set forth
 
in the Indoctrination Handbook published by the
 
Sets in Order American Square Dance Society.
 
Individuals within the American square dance movement have also
 
noticed a certain falling away from desirable aspects of traditional
 
dance.
 One such was the Denver dance enthusiast and author Lloyd Shaw.
 
After his death in 1
958, friends and colleagues o
f Lloyd
 
Shaw, led by his wife Dorothy, started the Lloyd Shaw
 
Foundation, established "To  recall, restore and teach
 
the rhythms of the American people:  in dance, music,
 
song and allied folk arts, as a tribute to the memory
 
I
 
Omas, January 20,  1
984, page 3
 
of Lloyd  Shaw." .
.. According to the organization's
 
brochure, these people "continued to workshop material,
 
to research ideas, to teach, and to manifest concern over
  
a growing tendency of square dancers to r
ely more and
 
more on paid callers, and on l
imited and complicated
 
patterns, and on '
club' organization; and to make l
ess
 
and less use of the very wide repertory in the American
 
folk dance, and of its free and joyous quality"
 (Nevell
 
p
.  208, emphasis supplied.)
 
Two points emerge from the above:  f
irst, that the American square
 
dance movement does aspire to preserve the forms of traditional
 
dancing,
 and second, that observers, both within the movement and
 
outside i
t, see evidence that it is not fully successful in doing so.
 
While the club dancers are numerically in the head position, i
t is
 
by no means true that they have the floor to themselves.
 In New
 
England, the contra dance is flourishing.  Many communities, large and
 
small have weekly gatherings which draw young and old from across the
 
breadth of the social spectrum.
 Some of these dances have occurred
 
virtually without interruption for 35 years.  Of particular interest to
 
students of folk culture, as well as to the dancers themselves, are the
 
characteristic contra "orchestras" that provide l
ive musical
 
accompaniment.
 
In New York State, on the edge of the contra dance region, there is
 
a different, but equally vital, tradition that i
s s
imply known as "barn
 
dancing."  Barn dancing i
s encouraged by a s
tate law that permits a
 
farmer to hold -- without obtaining entertainment l
icenses —  as many
 
as three paid-admission dances in his barn each spring before the floor
 
is covered by hay.  Caught up in the general spirit of revelry,  farmers
 
sometimes loose track of the number of dances they have staged in a
 
particular season.
 In years of a late hay crop, the barn dance can
 
become quite an institution.  As an occasional participant-observer at
 
these affairs, I can testify to the social diversity of the dancers,
 
the preference for l
ive music, and the local character of the dance
 
figures and calls.  Although either contra dancing experience or the
 
Glasswork l
eading to Bachelor's of Square Dancing would certainly help
 
one to take part in a New York state barn dance, i
t i
s important to
 
note that there i
s no easy equivalence of terminology, figures, or body
 
movement between these three forms.
 
In 1
978, the American Folklife Center documented square dancing in
 
the central Blue Ridge.  An excerpt from the aforementioned report by
 
Margaret Owen may provide some notion of the complexity that often
 
characterizes folk dance in the United States:
 
■
 
Omas, January 20,  1
984, page 4
 
North Carolina Highway 1
8 proved to be some kind of
 
territorial landmark separating the old-time flat foot
 
dancers and the more modern clog-team style dancers.
 
Likewise, the old type mountain "square" dances (which
 
are in fact done in large circles) appeared to be danced
 
north of this line and Western-style square dances were
 
danced more to the south of this l
ine...
 
These two traditions are,  l
ike those of music and dance,
 
intermingled. Square dancers may do  f
lat foot s
teps
 
while executing the patterns o
f the square dance, and at
 
most dances, "called" square dances are interspersed
 
with numbers which are played just for flat foot
 
dancing.
 Primarily, however, flat foot dancing is done
 
solo.... It can be done (and i
s done) in the home, on
 
the street, on a stage, in a parking lot, or anywhere
 
"dancing music" i
s heard.
 It can be much less formal
 
than any kind of dancing that requires a partner or
 
certain number of people....  This does not mean that it
 
is not often done en masse, or i
n fact in couples.
 Some
 
dances in the Blue Ridge bring dozens of flat footers
 
onto the floor at once.  For the sake of description,
 
this essay will treat flat foot dancing and square
 
dancing in separate sections, although the two tradi-
tions are interwoven in many ways (p. 4).
 
Elsewhere in this country,  "square dances" (by that name and by
 
many others) occur with bewildering variety in communities great and
 
small and on both the folk and popular l
evels of culture.  While from
 
some r
emote academic vantage, these dances may be seen to share certain
 
features that p
ermit them to be grouped under a general heading, anyone
 
who has had the experience of attempting to translate skills acquired
 
in one dance venue to another will l
ikely be more impressed by the
 
differences between them than by the similarities.
 A person who
 
considers himself a good dancer in his own neighborhood may actually
 
fear to venture onto the floor while visiting a dance in a different
 
r
egion (Newell pp. 203, 2
11).  Clearly the term "square dance"
 
encompasses a multitude of functionally incompatible expressive forms
 
promenading side by side through both folk and popular culture.
 
In short, the question "Does the square dance historically
 
represent U.S. dance?" requires us f
irst to say which square dance we
 
mean.  Do we mean the most popular form, the form most clearly embedded
 
in a contemporary folk society, or the form that is the most
 
traditional with regard to its retention of features from the past?
 
And if the latter, which criteria would we use -- in the absence of
 
authoritative scholarship —  to make this determination?
 
Omas, January 20,  1
984, page 5
 
I do not propose to answer any of the above questions. I will point
 
out that should some Solomon come forth to select the quintessential
 
square dance form, the suitability of that form to represent the dance
 
traditions of the United States i
s an even more problematic issue. Some
 
of these problems can be deduced from the comments of various dance
 
experts given hereafter.
 Suffice i
t to say here that the difficulties
 
arise because the r
epresentativeness of a cultural form can not be
 
established by outside authority, either governmental or academic.
 
Although i
t has been observed that square dancing of one sort or
 
another i
s engaged in by Americans from many different backgrounds, and
 
although influences of various ethnic sorts have sometimes been pointed
 
to in square dancing, the i
ssue of "representation" remains a matter of
 
the heart.  A person has to feel that a particular form stands for him.
 
The judgement of scholars that one ethnic group has contributed to a
 
dance form may mean l
ittle or nothing with r
espect to the symbolic
 
value of the dance.  No matter how many excellent blues musicians
 
emerge from the white middle class, the blues musical form  continues
 
to be linked symbolically to the secular side of grassroots
 
Afro-American experience.  Accordingly, it may be that the many
 
Americans who come from African, Spanish, Native American or
 
Continental European backgrounds would find the news that we have
 
established the square dance as our national dance to be a curious and
 
less than salutary development.  Further, i
t may be predicted that the
 
many Americans who take a sophisticated pleasure in the kaleidoscopic
 
diversity of the nation's cultural l
ife would find the canonizing of
 
this one folk dance out of many to be downright distasteful.
 For those
 
people, it i
s the very impossibility of putting forth one such
 
expressive form that i
s representative of this nation.
 
II
 
In reply to your second question, I have been unable to find any
 
other nation that has g
iven official recognition to a traditional dance
 
such as that accorded by Pu bic Law 97-188.
 Certain dances are of
 
course associated with particular nationalities and are often referred
 
to as "national dances."  The hora is associated with Israel, the
 
czardas with Hungary, the polonaise with Poland, the tarantella with
 
Italy, the bour de with France, and so forth. But the cultural affairs
 
officers at the embassies of these (and other) nations seemed to find
 
the idea of giving official r
ecognition to a dance to be a peculiarly
 
American idea. I mentioned this reaction of the embassy staff members
 
to the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax.
 Mr. Lomax observed that because
 
the U.S.  leapt into being so abruptly and in a way that threw a
 
hodgepodge of different peoples together into a political geography
 
drawn with imaginary l
ines on the landscape "we early formed the habit
 
of  'declaring' ourselves a culture."  The panoply of state birds, dogs,
 
songs, flowers, and the like, may thus be seen as a way of giving
 
concrete reality to social s
tructures that were assembled through
 
Omas, January 20,  1
984, page 6
 
political expediency rather than through the force of evolving
 
tradition.  "The practice was perfectly understandable," he said,  "but I
 
think i
t's about t
ime we gave i
t up."
 
III
 
in r
esponse to the part of your inquiry concerned with the pros and
 
cons o
f making the square dance the national dance of the United
 
States, I have talked by t
elephone to a number of experts in dance
 
matters.  Their r
emarks are quoted and synopsized below.
 It will be
 
seen that most of the commentators expressed admiration of square dance
 
as one of the great creations of American culture.  None of them,
 
however, expressed  enthusiasm toward the idea of making it (or any
 
other) the official dance of the United States, however.  The primary
 
concerns seemed to be 1
/ the possibility of giving offense to those who
 
do not feel themselves to be a part of the America that i
s represented
 
by square dance; 2
/ the possibility of creating a received standard
 
form of folk dance that will inhibit the natural, creative evolution of
 
American dance traditions; 3
/ the possibility of setting up barriers to
 
our ability to represent the cultural diversity of America to audiences
 
overseas.

 "I would feel funny
 
about endorsing American square dance as the national dance. I question
 
i
ts representativeness.  American Indian dances are really American.
 
So i
s tap dancing.  Tap i
s enjoying a big revival right now. And how
 
about '
cheerleader dancing'?  That's a truly national form. Dance in
 
general i
s important and our government should recognize i
t and make
 
use of it as a r
esource in communicating with other people abroad.
 I
'm
 
all for that.  But government should not endorse one form. I think
 
there would b
e r
esentment at that.  There should be some other way of
 
acknowledging the importance of square dance."

 "
I think a national
 
dance would b
e a dangerous precedent.  The square dance i
s not the
 
national dance of blacks, Hispanics, or 'hyphenated Americans'. The
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife celebrates the quiltwork of
 
American culture.  There you can see how difficult it would be to
 
select one over another —  one dance, or one form of one dance.
 
Moreover the square dance today is very different from what you found
 
in this country forty years ago. There are different forms, calls,
 
music;  i
t's commercial. That doesn't take away from i
t, understand, but
 
i
t is different.  Right now, the Texas Two-Step may be the most popular
 
dance in the country.
 It's part of a trend.  Might not the popularity
 
of the square dance also be a trend?
 I have taught square dancing.

Square dancers are great people and its a great dance, but when I think
 
of "national dance", I think of national heritage, and when we give the
 
National Heritage Awards we go to a lot of trouble to give out 1
5 of
 
them to different kinds of people and different kinds of art forms.
 I
 
know of Serbian-Americans who are the fifth generation to dance the
 
kolo (that's a l
ine dance) in the U.S.  There i
s no one dance that i
s
 
any more American than any other, and who are we to say to people
 
l
iving i
n this county that there i
s?" (Mr. Koenig was joined in his
 
remarks by Ethel Raim, Co-Director of the Ethnic Folk Arts Center.)

 "The square dance is a beautiful thing to watch. Once,
 
while I was watching a large dance floor from above, I was struck by
 
the way i
t expresses the fundamental orderliness that informs American
 
society despite our sometimes vigorous disagreements (This i
s a country
 
where people stop for highway stop-signs even when they know no one is
 
looking).  The square dance i
s actually a diagram of the way we
 
Americans move around our country. But there are other dances that are
 
also beautiful spectacles and are just as vivid portrayals of patterned
 
movement and of respect for others moving in the same pattern.
 If I
 
were a black or an American Indian, I think I might be insulted by the
 
selection of a single, official, national dance. As we are a nation of
 
nations, plural, we should remain a nation of national dances, plural."
 
Alan Lomax —  Director, the Cantometric/Choreometrics Project,
 
Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, (212-865-8712).
 "The square
 
dance i
s a form of European country dance that acquired a new character
 
here. There i
s black influence, French influence, perhaps even —in the
 
movement style —American Indian influence.  The caller i
s notoriously
 
American.  But there are other dances that are equally American,
 
equally old: clogging, soft shoe, tap dance.  These are also multi-
cultural.  The black "shout" i
s just as early and, in its various
 
appearances in both black and white religious worship,  i
t might be
 
thought of as the national religious dance.  The pan-tribal "
fancy
 
dancing" might be thought of as the national Indian dance.
 But there
 
•
�
 are hundreds of American Indian dances.
 Black folk dances exist in
 
infinite variety, and I am inclined to believe there may be even more
 
Latin-American dance varieties than that. And these are all forms that
 
date to the colonial period;
 i
t doesn't even count the recent
 
immigrant forms, many of which are equally old.
 It would be nice to
 
see square dance get some recognition, but i
t shouldn't be exclusive.
 
Square dancing was almost gone in the [
Southern] Mountains when I
 
recorded there in 1
937. With the opening up of r
oads and railroads the
 
isolation of communities broke down and there was no way to keep young
 
toughs from showing up at your dance.  There was so much killing
 
connected to the dances that the tradition almost became extinct.  The
 
show dances , such as those at Bascom Lamar Lunsford 's Asheville
 
Omas, January 20,  1
984, page 8
 
Mountain Dance and Folk Festival did as ouch as anything to keep it
 
alive.
 I feel very sympathetic toward the square dancers today and
 
their desire for national recognition, but i
sn't there some way to give
 
that recognition without making i
t exclusive?"
 
Ralph Rinzler -- Assistant Secretary for Public Service,
 
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560  (202-357-3069).
 "By
 
designating one cultural form as official, we run the r
isk of implying
 
that other forms are l
ess official and less acceptable.  We may also
 
tend to l
imit the possibility of r
efinement and variation, and thus of
 
the continued creativity that i
s the hallmark of our pluralistic
 
society and the aspect of our culture that makes i
t so rich.
 It might
 
even be seen as running counter to the intent of the legislation that
 
created the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress,
 
an Act of Congress (
PL94-201)  that was designed to encourage research
 
and documentation of our rich cultural diversity."

Arts,  1

(202-296-0068).
 "Make square dance the national dance?
 I tend to
 
think modern square dance has more to do with aerobic exercise than
 
with culture and that an official status for it will not effect anybody
 
else's real dance.  Whether other dancers will object to legislated
 
establishment of the square dance i
s anybody's guess.
 The polka would
 
be a strong contender.
 It was here early and has an organized
 
following, but everyone tends to think of i
t as having stronger
 
European roots than the square dance.  We shouldn't overlook the solo
 
dance traditions.  From West Virginia on south, team clogging —  which
 
evolved out o
f the old British Isles solo dance tradition -- probably
 
has as many devotees as square dance, and it's at least as old.  There
 
are black solo dance traditions -- hambone, patting Juba, buck dancing
 
-- that are mentioned in the earliest accounts of life in the New World
 
-- long before you see any mention of square dance.  We at NCTA just
 
helped t
o organize an international folk dance tour for USIA.  We had
 
representatives o
f Laguna Pueblo dance, Irish-American, black,
 
Appalachian, and so on.  The tour was a great success, but  designating
 
any one of those as THE national dance could not  have been anything
 
but awkward."

To:  Frank Hodsoll, Chairman
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, Folk Arts
 
Subject:  Bill Establishing the Square Dance as our "National Dance"
 
The attached bill has been around a long time and has never gotten much
 
attention.  This year, however, it has somehow passed the Senate, and the
 
House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service, which handles these
 
honorific matters, is planning hearings for June 28.  I thought you might
 
want at least to be forewarned in case the views of the Endowment are
 
solicited, so I am attaching not only a copy of the Bill itself but a
 
resolution passed by the Board of the National Council on the Traditional
 
Arts and a research memorandum prepared by Jerry Parsons, Research Librarian
 
at the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress, in response to a
 
request from the House Committee.  It is extremely interesting reading.
 
I have also spoken on this matter to Nigel Redden who concurs with me that
 
this is an extremely inappropriate piece of legislation, and he will alert
 
Don Moore's organization as well as other parts of the dance world.  Perhaps
 
you yourself might want to testify, but I must point out that the hearing
 
coincides with the annual convention of the American Square Dance Association
 
in Baltimore, so the meeting will undoubtedly be packed with organized square,
 
dancers, a pretty obstreporous group.  I am really afraid, though, that the
 
voice of reason may be drowned out unless some steps are taken to point out
 
to the Congress that the American square dance, worthy though it is, is not
 
really on the same level of national symbolism as the Flag and the Great
 
Seal and the National Anthem.

To:  Frank Hodsoll, Chairman
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, Folk Arts
 
Subject:  Bill Establishing the Square Dance as our "National Dance"
 
The attached bill has been around a long time and has never gotten much
 
attention.  This year, however, it has somehow passed the Senate, and the
 
House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service, which handles these
 
honorific matters, is planning hearings for June 28.  I thought you might
 
want at least to be forewarned in case the views of the Endowment are
 
solicited, so I am attaching not only a copy of the Bill itself but a
 
resolution passed by the Board of the National Council on the Traditional
 
Arts and a research memorandum prepared by Jerry Parsons, Research Librarian
 
at the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress, in response to a
 
request from the House Committee.  It is extremely interesting reading.
 
I have also spoken on this matter to Nigel Redden who concurs with me that

DRAFT RESOLUTION
 
Approved May 30, 1
984, by the Executive Committee of the
 
National Council for the Traditional Arts
 
The National Council for the Traditional Arts is the oldest and
 
most active private organization in the United States engaged in the
 
presentation of folk, ethnic, and tribal cultural expression.
 Since
 
1
933, we have worked to increase public understanding of America's
 
traditional music, crafts, celebrations, and recreations.  Among these
 
varied forms o
f expression, none has been more prominent in our
 
thoughts and i
n our public programs than the country's traditional
 
dances: the Buckdance, Charleston, Polka, Virginia Reel, Mountain Round
 
Dance, Mountain Spirit Dance, Merengue, Tsamikos, Clog Dance, Jig,
 
Khmer Ballet, Kola, Tap, Contra, and, certainly, the Square Dance.
 
Out of our half-century of experience with these matters has come
 
the conviction that each American dance form has its own values, each
 
its own practitioners, and each its own special place in the fabric of
 
American society.  The Council therefore feels it unwise to legislate a
 
special, permanent status for any one.
 
It is a position we take thoughtfully and with some regret.  We
 
do not lightly choose t
o oppose any effort to bring recognition to any
 
aspect of American grassroots culture.  In fact, the National Council
 
for the Traditional Arts would gladly endorse a statement by this
 
Congress that gives official recognition t
o the enrichment that square
 
dancing has provided many Americans.  However, we have read House
 
Resolution 1
706 and feel that its designation of the square dance as
 
"
the national f
olk dance of the United States" (
italics supplied) goes
 
beyond the appropriate commemoration of one among many American dances.
 
In this case, elevating the one implies that the others are less
 
worthy.  We do not believe that the history of dance in this country
 
substantiates such a judgement.  Moreover, we note that the few other
 
symbols the nation has chosen for itself —  the anthem, the eagle, and
 
the flag -- raise no such possibility of divisive comparison.
 
Many Americans, ourselves among them, are particularly proud of
 
our nation's remarkable diversity.  For us it is of special symbolic
 
value that our government grants to no craft, no dialect, no music
 
style, no drama, no folktale, no region, no trade, no sport, and no
 
dance a status that raises i
t above the others.  With this in mind, we
 
ask the Congress not to reject square dancing (an activity that we
 
ourselves have fostered for more than f
ive decades), but rather t
o
 
preserve a greater symbol of this nation's genius for diversity.

In your inquiry of November 9 an d su bsequen

conversation, you raise three ques
ti on s concern

dancing in the United States:
 
1
/ Does the square dance hist or ica lly r
e presen
t U.S. dance
?
 
2
/ Have any other natio ns  of th e wor

to a t
raditional dance such as  th a t accor
ded by Publi c Law  97-188 to  
the s
quare dance?
 
3
/ What are the pros and cons
 of ma ki ng  th e s

 As Margaret Owen  wr it es  in her  report
 to  the Amer
ican  
Folklife Center, Dance Traditio n s in th e Bl ue  Ridg e (
1980, unpu
b-
lished),
 "Traditional, or folk, dance
 has  received very little
 
scholarly treatment in the past and Amer
ican  folk dance has been
 
virtually ignored" (p.  1
).  A special problem l
imiting the quality of
 
research in dance has been fhe abs ence

should we look in upon one of th ose  ear

In t
erms of sheer numbers of participants, the form of square
 
dance that heads the l
ist in the United States today i
s the variety
 
known variously as "Western Square Dance,"
 "Modern Square Dance,"
 
"Club Dancing," or more r
ecently, "American Square Dance."  It must be
 
understood at the outset t
hat this i
s not a folk cu ltura
l act
ivity .
 
American Square Dance i
s a phenomenon of mass, national, popular
 
culture.
 In his 1
977 book A Time to Dance (New York: St. Martin's
 
Press), Richard Nevell says that square dance clubs boast six million
 
members and that t
he 1
976 Annual Square Dance Convention drew 36,000
 
dancers (p. 205). To what degree does this enormously vital expression
 
of contemporary popular culture embody the forms of folk dance
 
tradition?
 
"The s
imple '
cowboy dances' enjoyed by early pioneers in the
 
American West have been altered drastically," Nevell writes
 
(p. 225).
 The most obvious indicators of this change are:
 
1
/ The adoption of uniform costumes
 
2/ The substitution of recorded music for live bands
 
3/ The introduction of professional callers
 
4/ Change in three aspects of dance movements:
 
a
) elimination of local variation in favor of
 
standards
 
b) vast increase in complexity, e
.g. multiplication
 
of basic figures from approximately two dozen to
 
nearly a hundred.
 
c
) polished execution of the movements attributable
 
to formalized instruction (leading to a Bachelor
 
of Square Dancing diploma), and adherence to
 
ry
 les and regulations such as those set forth  -
in the Indoctrination Handbook published by the
 
Sets in Order American Square Dance Society.
 
Individuals within the American square dance movement have also --
noticed a certain falling away from desirable aspects of traditional
 
dance.  One such was the Denver dance enthusiast and author Lloyd Shaw.
 
After his death in 1
958, friends and colleagues of Lloyd
 
Shaw, led by his wife Dorothy, s
tarted the Lloyd Shaw
 
Foundation, established "To  recall, restore and teach
 
the rhythms of the American people: in dance, music,
 
song and allied folk arts, as a t
ribute to the memory
 
Omas, January 20, 1984, page 3
 
of Lloyd  Shaw." .
.. According to the organization's
 
brochure, these people "continued to workshop material,
 
to research ideas, to teach, and to manifest concern over
  
a growing tendency of square dancers to rely more and
 
more on paid callers, and on limited and complicated
 
patterns, and on '
club'  organization; and to make less
 
and less use of the very wide repertory in the American
 
folk dance, and of its free and joyous quality"
 (Nevell
 
p. 208, emphasis supplied.)
 
Two points emerge from the above:  first, that the American square
 
dance movement does aspire to preserve the forms of traditional
 
dancing,
 and second, that observers, both within the movement and
 
outside it, see evidence that it is not fully successful in doing so.
 
While the club dancers are numerically in the head position, it is
 
by no means true that they have the floor to themselves.
 In New
 
England, the contra dance is flourishing.  Many communities,  large and
 
small have weekly gatherings which draw young and old from across the
 
breadth of the social spectrum.
 Some of these dances have occurred
 
virtually without interruption for 35 years.  Of particular interest to
 
students of folk culture, as well as to th e dancers
 th emse
lves
, are  th e 
characteristic contra "orchestras" that provide live musical
 
accompaniment.
 
In New York State, on the edge of the contra dance region,  there is
 
a different, but equally vital, tradition that is simply known as "barn
 
dancing."  Barn dancing is encouraged by a state law that permits a
 
farmer to hold —  without obtaining entertainment licenses —  as many
 
as three paid -admission dances in his barn each spring before the floor
 
is covered by hay.
 Caught up in the general spirit of revelry,  farmers
 
sometimes loose track of the number of dances they have staged in a
 
particular season.  �
In years of a late hay crop, the barn dance can
 
become quite an institution.
 As an occasional participant-observer at
 
these affairs, I can, testify to the social diversity of the dancers,
 
the preference for live music, and the local character of the dance
 
figures and calls:
 Although either contra dancing experience or the
 
Glasswork leading to Bachelor's of Square Dancing would certainly help
 
one to take part in a New York state barn dance, it is important to
 
note that there is no easy equivalence of terminology,  figures, or body
 
movement between these three forms.
 
In 1
978, the American Folklife Center documented square dancing in
 
the central Blue Ridge.
 An excerpt from the aforementioned report by
 
Margaret Owen may provide some notion of the complexity that often
 
characterizes folk dance in the United States:
 
Omas, January 20, 1
984, page 4
 
North Carolina Highway 1
8 proved to be some kind of
 
territorial landmark separating the old-time flat foot
 
dancers and the more modern clog-team style dancers.
 
Likewise, the old type mountain "square" dances (which
 
are in f
act done in large circles) appeared to be danced
 
north of this l
ine and Western-style square dances were
 
danced more t
o the south of this l
ine...
 
These two traditions are, like those of music and dance,
 
intermingled. Square dancers may do flat foot steps
 
while executing the patterns of the square dance, and at
 
most dances, "called" square dances are interspersed
 
with numbers which are played just for flat foot
 
dancing.  Primarily, however, flat foot dancing is done
 
solo.... It can be done (and is done) in the home, on
 
the street, on a stage, in a parking lot, or anywhere
 
"
dancing music" is heard.
 It can be much less formal
 
than any kind of dancing that requires a partner or
 
certain number of people....  This does not mean that it
 
is not often done en masse, or in fact in couples.  Some
 
dances in the Blue Ridge bring dozens of flat footers
 
onto the floor at once.  For the sake of description,
 
this essay will treat flat foot dancing and square
 
dancing in separate sections, although the two tradi-
tions are interwoven in many ways (p. 4).
 
Elsewhere in this country, "square dances" (by that name and by
 
many others) occur with bewildering variety in communities great and
 
sma.17l-
-and on both the folk and popular levels of culture.  While from
 
some r
emote academic vantage, these dances may be seen to share certain
 
features that permit them to be grouped under a general heading, anyone
 
who has had the experience of attempting to translate skills acquired
 
in one dance venue to another will likely be more impressed by
' the
 
differences between them than by the similarities.  A Person who
 
considers himself a good dancer in his own neighborhood may actually
 
fear to venture onto the floor while visiting a dance in a different
 
r
egion (Nevell pp. 203, 2
11).  Clearly the term "square dance"
 
encompasses a multitude of functionally incompatible expressive forms
 
promenading side by s
ide through both folk and popular culture.
 
In short, the question "Does the square dance historically
 
represent U.S. dance?" requires u
s first to say which square dance we
 
mean.  Do we mean the most popular form, the form most clearly embedded
 
in a c
ontemporary folk society, or the form that is the most
 
traditional with regard to its retention of features from the past?
 
And i
f the latter, which criteria would we use —  in the absence of
 
authoritative scholarship —  to wake this determination?
 
Omas, January 20, 1
984, page S
 
I do not propose to answer any of the above questions. I will point
 
out that should some Solomon come forth to select the quintessential
 
square dance form, the suitability of that form to represent the dance
 
traditions of the United States i
s an even more problematic issue. Some
 
of these problems can be deduced from the comments of various dance
 
experts given hereafter.
 Suffice i
t to say here that the difficulties
 
arise because the r
epresentativeness of a cultural form can not be
 
established by outside authority, either governmental or academic.
 
Although it has been observed that square dancing of one sort or
 
another i
s engaged in by Americans from many different backgrounds, and
 
although influences of various ethnic sorts have sometimes been pointed
 
to in square dancing, the i
ssue of "representation" remains a matter of
 
the heart.  A person has to feel that a particular form stands for him.
 
The judgement of scholars that one ethnic group has contributed to a
 
dance form may mean little or nothing with respect to the symbolic
 
value of the dance.
 No matter how many excellent blues musicians
 
emerge from the white middle c
lass, the blues musical form  continues
 
to be linked symbolically to the secular side of grassroots
 
Afro-American experience.  Accordingly, it may be that the many
 
Americans who come from African, Spanish, Native American or
 
Continental European backgrounds would find the news that we have
 
established the square dance as our national dance to be a curious and
 
less than salutary development.  Further, i
t may be predicted that the
 
many Americans who take a sophisticated pleasure in the kaleidoscopic
 
diversity of the nation's cultural l
ife would find the canonizing of
 
this one folk dance out of many to be downright distasteful.  For those
 
people, it is the very impossibility of putting forth one such
 
expressive form that i
s representative of this nation.

In reply to your second question, I have been unable to find any
 
other nation that has given o
fficial recognition to a traditional dance
 
such as that accorded by Public Law 97-188.  Certain dances are of
 
course associated with particular nationalities and are often referred
 
to as "national dances."  The hora is associated with I
srael, the
 
czardas with Hungary, the polonaise with Poland, the tarantella with
 
Italy, the bourrde with France, and so forth. But the cultural affairs
 
officers at the embassies of these (and other) nations seemed to find
 
the i
dea of giving official r
ecognition to a dance to b
e a peculiarly
 
American idea. I mentioned this reaction of the embassy staff members
 
to the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax.
 Mr. Lomax observed that because
 
the U
.S. leapt into being so abruptly and in a way that threw a
 
hodgepodge of different peoples together into a political geography
 
drawn with imaginary lines on the landscape "we early formed the habit
 
of '
declaring' ourselves a culture."  The panoply of s
tate birds, dogs,
 
songs, flowers, and the l
ike, may thus be seen as a way of giving
 
concrete reality to social s
tructures that were assembled through
 
Omas, January 20. 1

political expediency r
ather than through the force of evolving
 
tradition. "The practice was perfectly understandable," he said, but I
 
think it's about t
ime we gave it up."

In response to the part of your inquiry concerned with the pros and
 
cons of making the square dance the national dance of the United
 
States, I have t
alked by t
elephone to a number of experts in dance
 
matters.  Their r
emarks are quoted and synopsized below.
 It will be
 
seen that most o
f t
he commentators expressed admiration of square dance
 
as one of the great creations of American culture.  None of them,
 
however, expressed  enthusiasm toward the idea of making it (or any
 
other) the official dance of the United States, however.  The primary
 
concerns seemed to be 1
/ the possibility of giving offense to those who
 
do not feel themselves to be a part of the America that is represented
 
by square dance; 2
/ the possibility of creating a received standard
 
form of folk dance that will inhibit the natural, creative evolution of
 
American dance t
raditions; 3
/ the possibility of setting up barriers to
 
our ability to represent the cultural diversity of America to audiences
 
overseas.

 "I would feel funny
 
about endorsing American square dance as the national dance. I question
 
its representativeness.  American Indian dances are really American.
 
So is tap dancing.  Tap i
s enjoying a big revival right now. And how
 
about '
cheerleader dancing'?  That's a truly national form. Dance in
 
general is important and our government should recognize it and make
 
use of it as a r
esource in communicating with other people abroad.
 I
'm
 
all-for that.  But government should not endorse one form. I think
 
there would be r
esentment at that.  There should be some other way of
 
acknowledging the importance of square dance."

 "I think a national
 
dance would be a dangerous precedent.
 The square dance is not the
 
national dance of blacks, Hispanics, or 'hyphenated Americans'. The
 
Smithsonian
.-Festival of American Folklife celebrates the quiltwork of
 
American culture.  There you can see how difficult it would be to
 
select one over another —  one dance, or one form of one dance.
 
Moreover the square dance today is very different from what you found
 
in this country forty years ago. There are different forms, calls,
 
music; it's commercial. That doesn't take away from i
t, understand, but
 
i
t is different.
 Right now, the Texas Two-Step may be the most popular
 
dance in the country.  It's part of a trend.  Might not the popularity
 
of the square dance also be a trend?
 I have taught square dancing.

Square dancers are great people and its a great dance, but when I think
 
of "national dance -, I think of national heritage, and when we give the
 
National Heritage Awards we go to a lot of trouble to give out 1
5 of
 
them to different kinds of people and different kinds of art forms.  I
 
know of Serbian-Americans who are the fifth generation to dance the
 
kolo (that's a line dance) in the D.S.  There is no one dance that is
 
any more American than any other, and who are we to say to people
 
living in this county that there i
s?" (Mr. Koenig was joined in his
 
r
emarks by Ethel Raim, Co-Director of the Ethnic Folk Arts Center.)

 "The square dance is a beautiful thing t
o watch. Once,
 
while I was watching a large dance floor from above, I was struck by
 
the way i
t expresses the fundamental orderliness that informs American
 
society despite our sometimes vigorous disagreements (This is a country
 
where people stop for highway stop-signs even when they know no one is
 
looking).  The square dance is actually a diagram of the way we
 
Americans move around our country. But there are other dances that are
 
also beautiful spectacles and are just as vivid portrayals of patterned
 
movement and of respect for others moving in the same pattern.
 If I
 
_
were a black or an American Indian, I think I might be insulted by the
 
selection of a single, official, national dance. As we are a nation of
 
nations, plural, we . should remain a nation of national dances, plural."
 
Alan Lomax —  Director, the Cantometric/Choreometrics Project,
 
Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, (212-865-8712).  "The square
 
dance is a form of European country dance that acquired a new character
 
here. There is black influence, French influence, perhaps even —in the
 
movement style —American Indian influence.  The caller is notoriously
 
American.  But there are other dances that are equally American,
 
equally old: clogging, soft shoe, tap dance.  These are also multi-
cultural.  The black "shout" i
s just as early and, in its various
 
appearances in both black and white religious worship, it might be
 
thought of as the national religious dance.  The pan-tribal "fancy
 
dancing" might be thought of as the national Indian dance.  But there
 
are.hundreds of American Indian dances.
 Black folk dances- exist in
 
infinite variety, and I am inclined to believe there may be even more
 
Latin-American dance varieties than that. And these are all forms that
 
date to t
he colonial period;
 it doesn't even count the r
ecent
 
immigrant forms, many of which are equally old.
 It would-be nice to
 
see square dance get_some recognition, but it shouldn't be exclusive.
 
Square dancing was almost gone in the [Southern] Mountains when I
 
r
ecorded there in 1
937. With the opening up of roads and r
ailroads the
 
i
solation of communities broke down and there was no way to keep young
 
t
oughs from showing up at your dance.
 There was so much killing
 
connected to the dances that the tradition almost became extinct.  The
 
show dances, such as those at Bascom Lamar Lunsford's Asheville
 
Omas, January 20, 1
984, page 8
 
Mountain Dance and Folk Festival did as much as anything to keep it
 
alive.  I feel very sympathetic toward the square dancers today and
 
their desire for national recognition, but i
sn't there some way to give
 
that recognition without making it exclusive?"
 
Ralph Rinzler —  Assistant Secretary for Public Service,
 
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560  (202-357-3069).  "By
 
designating one cultural form as official, we run the r
isk of implying
 
that other forms are less official and less acceptable.  We may also
 
t
end to l
imit the possibility of refinement and variation, and thus of
 
the continued creativity that i
s the hallmark of our pluralistic
 
society and the aspect o
f our culture that makes i
t so r
ich.
 I
t might
 
even be seen as running counter to the intent of the legislation that
 
created the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress,
 
an Act of Congress [PL94-201] that was designed to encourage research
 
and documentation of our rich cultural diversity."

 "Make square dance the national dance?
 I tend to
 
think modern square dance has more to do with aerobic exercise than
 
with culture and that an official status for it will not effect anybody
 
else's real dance.  Whether other dancers will object to legislated
 
establishment of the square dance is anybody's guess.  The polka would
 
be a strong contender.  It was here early and has an organized
 
following, but everyone tends to think of it as having stronger
 
European roots than the square dance.  We shouldn't overlook the solo
 
dance traditions.  From West Virginia on south, team clogging —  which
 
evolved out of the old British Isles solo dance tradition -- probably
 
has as many devotees as square dance, and it's at least as old.  There
 
are black solo dance traditions —  hambone, patting Juba, buck dancing
 
—  that are mentioned in the earliest accounts of life in the New World
 
—  long before you see any mention of square dance.  We at NCTA just
 
helped to organize an international folk dance tour for USIA.  We had
 
representatives of Laguna Pueblo dance, Irish-American, black,
 
Appalachian, and so on.  The tour was a great success, but  designating
 
any one of those as THE national dance could not  have '
been anything
 
but awkward."
