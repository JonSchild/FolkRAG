While strolling out alone one summer's day, 
Down by a 
running brook, 
A. pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
never shall forget her look. 
With dark blue eyes and golden hair. 
And teeth as white as snow, 
Her heart I 
won in the shining sun, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
Crtonus. 
When the birds are singing in the glittering sunehlak 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine, 
I 
never shall forget where first we met, 
My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A day I'll never dread, 
When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
ramble to and fro, 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
Chorus. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG By FRANK LUZ. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
t 
to yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
- 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh ! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
l'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
3Z:inning around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mas 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Rutin; 
around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus, 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie.Gordon " or some love eon& 
With sweethearts under their arm so. 
tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

THE LAND WE LOIr SO WELL. 
WORDS AND MUSIC BY JOHN LORD. 
There is a 
bright and lovely sunny clime, 
The place where we were born, 
Where the darkies sing and dance most all de time, 
And hoe de sugar cane and corn. 
And at night when our days work was done, 
With joy we'd almost yell, 
Them's the happy times we love to see again, 
In the land we love so well, so well. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling, 
flours beguiling, 
And at night when our days work it was done, 
With joy we almost yell, 
Them's the happy times we love -zo see again. 
In the land we love so well. 
(Break.) 
(Break ) 
Old massa he was ever good and kind, 
Old missa she was too, 
The yellow gals they used to dress so fine, 
Especially our loves too. 
But them good days are past and gone, 
A!:d of them we can but tell, 
But our hearts are ever turning back agOin. 
To the land we love so well.

While strolling through the avenue, 
A 
cottage neat I 
saw; 
A. maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so sycet 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said. 
That made my heart feel good. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
she's the sweetest flower here. 
And she's the dearest of the dear; 
She's a 
lilly pure and true, 
A 
fragrant mignonette, 
A 
morning-glory dipped in dew, 
.A purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and rare, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my wife, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
3 
dwell in peace and love alone. 
With my rte perfumed bouquet. 
I 
know a 
little girl, the best in all the world, 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She promised to be mine, she's happiness divine, 
And said that I 
could have her heart and hand. 
I 
met her on the street the other day, 
I 
tell you she looked grand, 
When I 
saw her I 
thought I'd faint away, 
Such a 
feeling I 
couldn't understand. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
my, she's the finest in the country, 
tell you honey she's just grand, 
You can bet your bottom dollar, 
She's the finest in the land. 
Her folks are satisfied that she should be my bride, 
So now we will get married right away. 
We invite you one and all to come and make a 
caLl, 
Whenever you come along our Way, 
We'll take down the fiddle and bones, 
And make the banj o ring; 
And dit.t2ce as we often did before, 
That good old :Mississippi wing.

We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would Lee our o2:1,

Then hurrah for the son's of Erin's Isle, 
Hurrah fir the daughters who on us io smile,

Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Arise sons of Erin, aad prove to the world 
The stniburst of freedom is once more unfurled,

OOPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A LIDDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near„ 
The columns are marehing, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. the' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor cloth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigade 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten ard stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their o\ui fathers made 
Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigade.

LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE. 
BY CHAS. H. DOUTRICL 
As through this life we travel 'long, 
And pass throughout the world; 
Toil, sorrow care and strife, we find, 
Are in our pathway hurl'd. 
'Tis true, dame fortune smiles on some 
Ere life does fairly dawn; 
But oftentimes that smile does change 
To one of deepest scorn. 
enonus. 
Remember. there's but very few, 
Who'll lend help when you're down, 
But if you've wealth at your command, 
Just pay those with a 
frown. 
You may be broke, without a 
dime, 
No sign of luck ahead; 
Your friends may pass you on the street,

DON'T GO TO YOUR RELATIENS2 
WRITTZN AND BUNG BY MANX WM. 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and frowns, 
if we depend on kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit le in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behaViOY 
CHORUS. 
Bo my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you vant a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll lid 
how often they'll invite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, chorea 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep rue afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
Chorus 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of: mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heeds, 
Chariot 
Why Frank we were only joking. 
There is none in this world so blessed as 
With so many kind relations, 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
Tye a 
hundred invitations.

.BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to'school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
lie says young man this piece of goid jrifit from 
your poelet dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but Lttle coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
CrfatTs. 
No it don't bel

me, it  
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't he i.qine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small r 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dab, among the great and fulls 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little -h)ys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
N:i!ly Brow*, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away,

MY PRETTY RED NOSE.

He gave me a 
bang on the nose, 
Oh Heavens what stars I 
did see; 
And said, as he swiped me again, 
Wear this on your face love for me. 
Oh! Lord, don't it ache and feel sore, 
Just like a 
bull bumble bee's sting, 
While lonely I 
sigh, with a 
lump on my 
eye,, 
Of my pretty red nose I 
will sing.

My pretty red nose, my pretty red nose, 
ViS a sweet little blossom, my pretty red nal*, 
Like a 
big scarlet bunion, still larger it grow*, 
As I 
sing of my pretty red nose. 
It looks like an overgrown beet, 
As bright as a 
red flannel shirt; 
'They tell me to go get it lanced, 
And say that it never will hurt. 
But I 
think I 
will bathe it with gin, 
And swear as I'm howling:with pain, 
That, well, hardly ever, as long as I 
live, 
Will I 
say you're a

am thinking of the day when but a 
little child. 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
'Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart. 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
"Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out v,-e 
would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no = Oft.

The place where we were born; 
We used to hoe the cotton, 
The sugar cane and corn. 
Oh! it's then boys, we had a

On the old log cabin floor, 
And we used to keep it up till the breaking

And dance till our feet were sore. (Break.) 
Hark, hark ! listen to the sound 
Of the overseers horn a

Shout, shout! and throw our feet around, 
Happy colored children from the

When all our work was done, 
The darkies would gather round the door,

Oh! happy nigs singing all the day, 
We dance the whole night long; 
And now we've tried our best 
To please you with our little song.

she's an aligator face, and she's always on the brace, 
She's got freckles on her feet which make her lame; 
Oh : she causes great disasters, biteing holes in

Oh this bronketis looking damsel has an iron 
foundry gall. 
And her foot looks like the left lung of a 
whale:

she lives on limburg cheese, and her breath

Pind right down her back she wears a

Iler teeth they shine like lead, sht has dandruff 
in her 11ati, 
Her ears would hold a

Memory gently leads me backward to the shores 
of long ago, 
Bright with many recollections dear to me; 
Happy faces smile upon me mid the breaking 
o'er the strand. 
Of the silvery surges made by memory's sea. 
Childhood's playmates cluster round me, friends 
of manhood's sterner years, 
Who have ceased the weary paths of life to roam; 
But amid the throng of faces there is one I 
. treasure moot, 
Of a 
mother whom the angels beckoned home. 
Cimatra. 
the vision of my mother, she who rooked 
me when a 
babe, 
And who guarded me within my cradle nest;

As she held me ere she laid me down to sleep; 
And through weary hours of danger, every 
effort gladly )inach. 
For my comfort, while she oft would o'er me weep. 
Faintly 
can still remember songs of melody she saw& 
Prayers she offered that I 
might be always blest, 
But at last she left her treasure to the Saviour's 
watchful ooze, 
For the angels beckoned her to come and rest. 
I 
have passed those youthful hours and have 
grown to manhood's ags. 
Still my fancy often bids me backward stray. 
To the sunny days of childhood when the 
hours were sweetly speak 
Wish the loved one lying now beneath the clay. 
Childhood's prayers will have been answered 
when at last my life is o'er, 
And I'll deem myself forever blessed,

treasured dam 
Whom the anels beckoned home with them to rot.

They're

Why her name on the bills should read 
Madam Du Rand, 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see, 
And her right name is Biddy McGee. 
I 
taught her the skip, the hop, and the dip. 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would trip, 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a

never could ten. 
Where she got it, or how, 'tis a

For she's so full of glee, when dancing you see,

My father was a 
farmer, 
And lived unon his farm; 
And 
I 
do remember 
The old farm house and barn. 
And the pretty little garden, 
A 
here often seeds I've sown; 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My little country home. 
Cuoutis. 
My little country home, 
On a 
bright and sunny morn, 
You could hear the birds a 
singing, 
When the day began to dawn. 
And the ducks would quack, quack, quack, 
And the chickens caekl,", too; 
The rooster he would flap his wings, 
And, cry cock-e-doodle-doo. 
lt•e'd rise up in the morning, 
Just at the break of day; 
We'd drive the cows to pasture, 
And give the horses hay. 
Then t.) the fields we'd gather, 
To hoe and rake the corn; 
At noon we're always sure to hear 
The welcome dinner horn. 
On wint r 
nights we'd gather 
Beside the cheerful grate, 
And listen to the stories 
Our father would relate. 
But now those days have vanished, 
No matter where I 
rt am, 
in meiti'ry dear I 
wilt revere, 
My dear old country home.

When the roses fall asleep, love, 
In the fading of the day; 
Does your heart then silent weep, love, 
For the one so far away ? 
And, when kneeling, pure in prayer, love, 
Am I 
thought of then by thee! 
And does, while I 
am not there, love, 
One kind prayer ascend for me? 
CHORUS. 
When the roses softly sleep, love, 
When the roses softly sleep, 
Do you sigh then for my coming, 
When the roses softly sleep? 
Softly sleep, softly sleep, 
When the roses softly sleep. 
When the roses, love, are sleeping, 
Does your heart with thoughs of me 
Ever hold in sacred keeping, 
That sweet love for me at sea. 
Is there, then, one look of sorrow, 
In thy blue eyes hidden deep ? 
Do thy lips call for the morrow, 
When the roses softly sleep. (Thorns, 
When the roses, love, are sleeping, 
Do you feel that parting pain? 
Does thy heart while softly weeping, 
Call me home to thee again ?

Pressed upon the ring you keep ? 
Do you sigh for me iu sadness, 
When the roses softly sleep.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER, 
BRUITED .BY GUS WILLIAIIS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and sloW. 
It the crowded crossing she waited long. 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout. 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
flailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
I'll help you across if you wish to go?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own avere young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
.ror all 0.1--'14 aged, buil poor and " low; 
And som eone, 
sometime, may 
lend a 'hand 
To help my inother—you understand 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away.' 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and -the prayer she BOO 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word,

SUNG BY PAT ROONEY. 
COpyright. 1881, by M IS. Pauline Lieder. 
Och I 
my name it's Jeremiah Reilly Esquire. 
I 
control a 
political ring; 
-I own forty-live big tenement houses, 
And I 
have seven sons in Sing Sing. 
I 
nominated myself into Congress, 
hi the Senate I 
passed all the bills, 
I 
blackened three or four Senators eyes, 
For telling me to take a 
dose of pills. 
Spoken— Yes, I 
was arguing on the question which 
was the wealthiest, the United States or Grant, when. 
Senator ., IcGuire from Hoboken interrupted me, ana 
I 
jumped off the grand stand and broke his nelt-tie; 
General Sherman, Don Cameron and Roscoe Sprapo 
I 
mean—Conkling shook hands with me, and one says 
to the other— 
CHORUS. 
IS 
this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
is this Mr. Reilly, the elegant swell; 
If this is the Reilly that's spoke of so highly, 
And a 
poll my soul Reilly, you're getting on well. 
I 
was President of a 
bank till it busted, 
'Pile cash assets was three paper collars ; - 
I 
stole thirteen truck loads of pennies, 
And twenty one barrells of trade 
I 
had the book-keeper and cashier sent to prison. 
While I 
had to make my escape; 
And while drinking champagne water in Canada, 
The Princess Louise got struck on my shape. 
Spoken —Yes, she says, had I 
known such a 
beauti. 
fal man lived, I 
would never have married till I 
witAl 
sixteen. 
Just then the Sheriff came in with ayarant 
for my arrest, he says — 
CHanus. 
Is this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
Well now Mr. Reilly, y6U'll go to a 
cell, 
Are you Mr. Reilly, that's spoke of so highly, 
Well Mr. Reilly, in prison you'll dwell,

While rambling down a 
country road 
Not knowing what to do; 
I 
beheld a 
fair young damsel 
With eyes of heavenly blue. 
She smiled on me so sweetly, 
trust like a 
young gazelle, 
My heart was captivated quite, 
In love with her I 
fell. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the lilies in the valley,. 
This pretty little maiden I 
shall marry, 
I'm as happy as the little birds in springtime, 
For this pretty maiden promised to be mine, 
So now 
married be, and 
live so happily 
With my pretty little Dandelion. 
Dance, 
I 
asked her bashful, how it was 
That on me she smiled so sweet; 
That afternoon in springtime, 
When we by chance did meet. 
She said it was my dashing style, 
My elegance and grace, 
That stole away her sweet young heart. 
But put mine in its place.

It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh I 
the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we like, 
So thtn we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word 'twits really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There ‘V:LS Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
'Then :fames O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gen tl y that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus,. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
alie'd really die, 
111'Guinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's phrty up.

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLE, 
RECITED BY JOB RA.RT. 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every fink* of the shingle, 
Has an eattO and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to swans, 
And I 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath, - 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, 
had not thought of that, 
my son just take them breeches ofE 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
And you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
If 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle.
