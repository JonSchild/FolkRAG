I'd Very Much Like to Get Fat. 
PATILETIC BALLAD.-AS SUNG BY BOB HARRISON. 
Oh! I'm getting as thin as a 
rat, 
Though I 
eat till I 
bust very nigh, 
I'd very much like to grow fat, 
But I 
can't and I 
can not tell why; 
I 
ain't got no load on my mind, 
On my belly I 
spends all my tin, 
Enough grub I 
never can find, 
Oh I'm getting remarkably thin 
Cuonus—Oh! I'm getting as thin as a 
rat, 
• 
Though I 
eat till I 
bust very nigh, 
I'd very much like to grow fat, 
But I 
can't and I 
can not tell why. 
I've often heard people say- that, 
How very disgusted they feel, 
To see a 
man loaded with fat, 
When he ought to look thin and genteel. 
Gentility's all very well, 
But you fat folks have got all the grin, 
What's the reason I 
hardly can tell, 
But I'm getting remarkably thin. (Cnonus.)

DOE IIARRTSON'S 
T'other morning I 
rose from my bed, 
No one on earth could excel, 
I 
devoured a 
box full of eggs, 
And a 
side of fat bacon as well; 
I 
eat off a 
loin of cold pork, 
And a 
regular stunning sheep's head, 
I 
fed off of turkey and chine, 
And I 
picked a 
cow's heel while in bed. (Cuo.) 
A 
score of black puddings for lunch, 
And a 
plate of cold fagots I 
eat, 
And saveloys all of a 
bunch, 
But I 
don't think them much of a 
treat. 
At a 
tater can sometimes I 
halt, 
Eating all the man's got in his tin, 
But I 
eat them without any salt, 
'Cos they say salt makes people grow thin., 
Shakes. 
" 
Say,Jim! what's become ob dat brudder of yours ?" 
" 
Well, Henry ! I'm right sorry to tole you dat he's 
been lying at de point ob sickness for some time." 
" 
Why, I'm right sorry for to hear it. 
What seems 
to be de ailment ?" 
" 
Why he's got de shakes!" 
" 
You don't tole me. 
Does he shake much ?" 
" 
Oh yes I 
ebery oder.day." 
" 
When did he shake last ?" 
" 
Yesterday !" 
" 
When's he gwine to shake agen ?" 
" 
Why, to-morrow !" 
"'Bout what time does he gen'rally shake?" 
" 
Ten o'clock, P. X." 
"I'll come down and see him shake."

" 
No, Bob! and I

" 
Sam! I've been a

I 
got ten dollars for singing one song." 
" 
Ten dollars for singing one song ? How did you 
do it.?" 
" 
Wal, you see I 
went to a

The Monkey's Wedding. 
AS SUNG BY BOB HARRISON. 
Am—The Gay Little Waiter. 
The monkey married the baboon's sister, 
Smacked his lips and then he kissed her; 
He kissed so hard he raised a 
blister, 
She set up a 
yell. 
The bridesmaids stuck on some court plaster, 
It stuck so hard it couldn't stick faster, . 
Surely it was a 
sad disaster, 
But it soon got well. 
Cuonus—The monkey married the baboon's sister, 
Smacked his lips and then he kissed her; 
He kissed so hard he raised a 
blister, 
She set up a 
yell. 
What do you think the bride was dressed in ? 
-White gauze vail and a 
green glass breastpin, 
Red kid shoes ; she was quite interesting; 
She was quite a 
belle. 
The bridegroom swelled with a 
blue shirt-collar, 
Black silk stock that cost a 
dollar, 
Large false whiskers,, the fashion to foller-; 
lie cut a 
monstrous swell. (Cuonus.) 
What do you think they had for supper ? 
Black-eyed peas and bread and butter, 
Ducks in the duck house all in a 
flutter, 
Pickled oysters too. 
SONG AND JOKE BOOK. 
Chestnuts raw, broiled and roasted, 
Apples sliced and onions toasted, 
Music in the corner posted, 
Waiting for the cue.

(Crtonus.) 
What do you think was the tune they danced to? 
The Drunken Sailor, sometimes Jim Crow, 
Tails in the way and some got pinched too, 
'Cos they were too long. 
What do you think they had for a 
fiddle ? 
An old banjo with a 
hole in the middle, 
A. tambourine made out of a 
riddle, 
And that's the end of my song. (Cuonus.) 
Poet. 
" 
Oh, is there not a 
happy land, a 
land beyond the 
seas—Where pot-pie smokes in endless lakes and 
dumplings grow on trees—Where gingerbread 
is 
found in stacks and sometimes by the ton—And 
when you've done your job of work you get your 
ready John—where you can read all Nature's laws in 
every bubbling brook—Where bumblebees don't sting 
a 
chap, and muley cows don't hook ?" 
" 
Why, Bob, you seem to be a 
poet." 
" 
I 
know it, and by my words I 
show it; oh, yes, 
I've wrote several effusions. 
Say, Sam, you've never 
heard my masterpiece ?" 
"; I 
would like to hear 1!." 
" 
Well, it runs thus : 
" 
As I 
was walking down the street, 
A 
pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
said to her, ' Miss, where are you going ?' 
She says to me, It's none of your business.' 
"Perhaps you don't understand the meter of it?" 
" 
No; what meter is it ?" 
10 
BOB HARRISON'S 
" 
Why, _that's gas meter. 
Sam, you know Mose 
Upsom, the fighter ?" 
" 
Yes, and he is a 
fighter, too." 
" 
Well, sir, you ought to have seen me get away 
with him." 
" 
What! you whip :Mose Upsom?" 
" 
You know how he is, Sam. 
I'll tell you how it 
was. 
He came up to me in the street and put his 
finger under my nose, and says to me, look here, what 
do you go around talking about me for? 
Now, you 
know, Sam, I 
don't go around talking about anybody. 
If I 
can't say a 
good word for them I 
don't say no-
thing. So he shook his finger right under my nostrils, 
and said that I 
had been around telling the boys that 
he couldn't chew beefsteak; so I 
told him I 
didn't 
say any thing of the kind, all I 
said was he couldn't 
chew liver as good as he used to. 
He hauled off, 
and made a 
smack for me and missed, and then he 
made another shot at me, and I stoppcd it beauti-
fully." 
" 
Where ?" 
" 
Right on the end of my horn. 
Then I 
got mad 
and went at him. 
I 
whipped him—I 
whipped him 
so bad I 
could see out of ne'er a 
one of my eyes; I 
whipped him so bad I 
was black and blue in the 
face; Sam, I 
whipped him so had they had to carry 
me home on a 
shutter. 
So I 
wrote a 
little piece of 
poetry about it. 
It runs this way : 
" 
This morning I 
rose, from my sweet repose, put 
on my clothes, and down the street I 
goes, meets one 
of my foes, his name is Mose, and he runs with the 
hose, we came to blows, and down I 
goes, in the gut-
ter you knows, where the water flows, up I 
rose, and 
home I 
goes, to bed I 
goes, put my head under the 
clothes, and what I 
knows I 
knows, I 
knows."

Changing Servants. 
Bob says he can always tell when his boarding-
house changes its servant girl, by just noticing de color 
ob de hair in de hash. 
If six drams make a 
pennyweight, how many will 
make a 
landlord ? 
If four inches make a 
hand, how many will make 
an arm ? 
If one man can eat a 
ham, how many will it take 
to eat a 
hammer ? 
If twelve inches make a 
foot, how many will make 
a 
leg ? 
If two pints make a 
quart, how many will make a 
a 
quarter ? 
Pea-nut Concert. 
" 
Sam, how can you get up -a 
concert without 
music ?" 
" 
It can t 
be done." 
" 
What can't be done ?" 
" 
Why, get up a 
concert without music." 
" 
Who said it could ?" 
" 
Why, you said so, just now." 
" 
Well, then, I'll stick to it." 
" 
Well, sir, how can you do it ?" 
" 
Why, in de fust place, you go and get a 
pint ob 
peanuts and eat ' ern." 
" 
Well, sir, what's that got to do with it ?" 
" 
Why, dat's one half." 
" 
Well, sir, what then?" 
12 
BOB HARRISON'S 
" 
Well, den, you go and get anoder pint and eat 
dem." 
" 
Well, sir, what then ?"

Well, den, you got a

And went to hear lectures and lager beer halls, 
With their smirking, perking,

They trotted to church, for their passion increased,

But in choosing two evils, I've chosen the least."

TUNE—Irish Washerwoman. 
In Simola there dwelt a 
Japanese man, 
His name was Chick-chack-tan-a-ran-tan, 
His swords they were long, and his feet they were 
small, 
This Japanese man couldn't walk at all. 
His servants used to carry him out 
Upon their backs, and the folks would shout,

This Japanese had plenty of peel, 
He lived in a 
mansion by himself; 
Alongside was his slavey's abode, 
Now wasn't that a 
curious mode ? 
He hired two men to carry him out, 
But they proved to be two robbers stout; 
He paid them well and gave them clothes, 
This Japanese man with his monkey nose. (Cno.,) 
This Japanese man he fell in love 
With Miss Souchong—Kotee, kodove ; 
He mounted one of the robbers quick, 
The other he followed with a 
stick, 
On a 
two-legged horse he looked such a 
gill, 
All went on well till he got to a 
hill, 
When into a 
puddle the robber he throws 
This Japanese man with his monkey nose. (Cuo.) 
The Japanese ladies from the town, 
Went up the hill to roll him down 
From top to bottom; when they began 
To tickle and play with the Japanese man, 
From him they nearly took all his breath, 
They nearly tickled Chickchack to death. 
He called on Miss Souchong to stop his woes, 
This Japanese man with the monkey nose. (Cu°.

A story I'll relate to you, took place the other day, 
As in the railroad cars by chance I 
started on my way. 
Just as I 
took my seat amongst the daughters, sons and 
mas, 
The door was opened to admit a 
lady in the cars. 
CHORUS. 
She dressed so neat, she looked so sweet, 
Her eyes were bright as stars, 
This lovely girl I 
chanced to meet, 
While riding in the cars. 
Her face was pretty, yet her form was bent as though 
in pain, 
And when she settled in her seat she straightened out 
again.

The trouble was, my honest friends, I'll bet my best 
cigars, 
She tried to make the Grecian Bend, that lady in the 
cars. (CuoRus.) 
I 
sat beside her to the left, a 
smile was on her face, 
The whistle blew and all aboard we started from the 
place. 
Look where I 
would, look where I 
could, from daugh-
ters to their mas, 
I 
could not keep my eyes from off that lady in the 
cars. (Cuouus.) 
Now, I 
was dressed all in my best, with clothes so neat 
and fine, 
And on my face wore a 
moustache, alas! that was not 
mine. 
We neared a 
tunnel, brave I 
sat as any son of Mars, 
And when the darkness came I kissed that lady in 
the cars. (CuoRus.) 
When from the tunnel we emerged right into the 
broad daylight, 
Oh, dear, will ever I 
forget the thing that met my 
sight ? 
The car was full, and the passengers gave vent to 
loud haha's 
For my mustache was sticking fast to that lady in the 
cars. (CrioRus.) 
Now, gents, I 
pray a 
warning take, or else like me 
you'll rue it— 
Don't wear a 
mustache on your face, unless kind Na-
ture grew it, 
For ne'er will I 
forget the day that I 
wished myself 
afar, 
The time I 
lost my false. 
mustache on that lady in the 
car. (CaoRus.)

How doth the little busy bee delight to bark and bite, 
He gathers honey all the day and eats it all at night. 
Three little boys went out to play, on a 
summer's day, 
One fell in, and he was drowned, the others run away. 
A boy stood on the burning deck, with his baggage 
checked for Troy, 
The ship went down and his hat blew off, and his 
name it was Pat Molloy. 
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to get her 
poor dog a 
bone, • 
When she got there the cupboard was bare,, and so 
the poor dog had none. 
If I 
see you and you see me, we both see one another, 
If I 
didn't see you and you didn't see me, why we 
wouldn't see one another. 
A bunky boy is U. S. G.; but this it is a 
shame, 
That Johnny Bull does not come down with the Ala-
bama claim. 
Supposing now that I 
was you—supposing you were 
me, 
Supposing I was somebody else, I 
wonder whose 
brother you'd be ? 
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle, the cow jumped 
over the moon, 
The little dog laughed to see such sport when Ben 
Butler run away with the spoons.

A 
Hole in Her Stocking. 
Ant—Harlem Bridge. 
55 
In New York once, as rve heard say, 
A maiden dwelt named Carrier, 
Whose heart was beating night and day, 
For some one who would marry her. 
Though sweethearts she'd had two or three, 
They each had got offended, 
Because she would not decent be, 
And keep her stockings mended. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, deary, such a 
fuss they made, 
You'll really say its shocking, 
No one would wed this charming maid, 
Because a 
hole was in her stocking. 
A 
barber first a-wooing came, 
To her his love he thrust in, 
Who said his heart was in a 
flame. 
So full that it was bu'sting. 
He said, while kneeling at her feet, 
"Indeed I 
am not mocking," 
But as he viewed her face so sweet, 
He did not see her stocking. (Cnontrs.) 
Next day on him she gave a 
call, 
Her hair for to have plaited; 
He could not comb it straight at all, 
Because it was so matted. 
The barber at it cried, " Oh, fie !" 
Then he called her names most shocking, 
And as she put her foot so high, 
He saw a 
hole in her stocking. (Cnontrs.) 
A. grocer next, quite full of puff, 
That came one day to court her, 
56 
BOB HARRISON'S 
Who said that he had gold enough 
Through life for to support her. 
She to his house did slyly creep, 
And at the door was knocking, 
He up the area chanced to peep, 
And then he saw her stocking. (Cnonns.) 
A cobbler next said, quite polite, 
In spite of wind or weather, 
He'd always stick to her as tight, 
As sole and upper leather. 
She ordered boots which soon were done, 
For her sweet feet to rock in, 
But as he stooped to try them on, • 
His eye fixed on her stocking. (CnoRus.) 
So maidens all, pray list to me, 
Before my song is ended, 
That if you wish to married be, 
Pray, keep your stockings mended. 
This short advice, indeed it's true, 
You'll say p'raps I'm a 
bold one, 
If you can't get cash to buy them new, 
Sit down and mend the old one. (Cnonus.) 
Why was the first day of Adam's life the longest 
ever known ? 
Because it had no Eve. 
Lub and Matrimony. 
" 
Jim, do you know what lub is ?" 
" 
Yes ; lub is an electric fluid, wrapped up in a 
woman's heart, and dealt out in small quantities to 
suit purchasers. 
Married men are the purchasers. 
D'ye know what makes man and woman lub one

man's is made ob flint; two hearts cumin' in contact,

Would that I

To ease my sorrows, to end my woes, 
To wash my wittels and cook my clothes. 
The Girl with the Coal-Black Hair. 
She was sweeter than sugar-cane, 
That cream-colored quean; 
She was the greatest darkey, 
That ever yet was seen. 
She had a 
roguish eye, 
And features was so fair, 
Her lips was red as roses, 
And coal-black was her hair. 
CHORUS. 
They all did say, she looked so -very gay. 
(

There were many lovely beauties to make the 
people stare, 
But the prettiest one among them all, 
Was the one with the coal- black hair. 
On one moonlight night, 
We went to a

She wore her richest satin

And largest waterfall. 
She showed her pretty foot 
In such a 
gallus style, 
And won the hearts of every one, 
With her bewitching smile. (OnoBus.) 
'Twas on one sunny day, 
In a 
buggy we did hop, 
And as we drove the horse along, 
The question I 
did pop. 
She says, " Young man, look here, 
how dare you ask me that, 
For you know I'm a 
colored, 
Suffrage mancipation ' ristocrat." . (Ono.) 
Why is a 
dead duck like a dead doctor.? 'Kase 
dey have bofe stopped quacking. 
Why are tight- rope dancers great favorites with 
the public? ' Kase dere performances are always en-
cored (on cord). 
Why 
is a

in, and forgot to take the crowbar out; so, all at 
once the powder ignited, and blew the crowbar 
through the man's head, but strange to say the man 
still lives." 
" 
How is de crowbar comin' on ? 
But talk about 
accidents, dat ain't nuffin. 
Didn't you hear ' bout de 
accident happened up at our house ?" 
" 
No ; what was it ?" 
" 
You see, dar was a man walkin' on de railroad 
track, and de train was behind time, ' cos de half-
past six o'clock train didn't start out until seven; so, 
de depot hadn't come in, and de man he didn't see 
de cars, but de jingineer he see'd de man; so, he blew 
de bell and rung de whistle, and de man he. didn't 
git off de track; so, de cars come along, and de con-
ductor he told de jingineer for to blow for them to 
smash de cars, but dey couldn't get dem smashed in 
time, and de cars come ' long and run ober de man, 
and cut his two legs off and two arms off, bofe his 
ears and his nose off." 
" 
And the man still lives ?" 
" 
No ; he's dead."

Oh, good-evening, white folks all, I 
thought I'd make

call, 
And tell you how the old man gets on, 
I 
try to please you all, both fat, short, lean and tall, 
While there's dancing left in old Uncle John. 
BOB HARRISON'S 
It's often I've been told, this nigger' S 
getting old, 
And soon will go to the happy land; 
But the few years that I've got, and while I'm on this 
spot, 
I'll sing and dance as long as I 
can stand. 
Oh, that's what the old man wants to do. 
When I 
was in my prime I 
had many a 
happy time, 
With the colored boys down on the old plantation; 
Oh, it's when the work was done, we all went in for 
fun, 
I 
tell you we were a 
happy population. 
But my bones are getting sore, I 
can not work much 
more, 
Soon this old nigger will be gone, 
But while on earth I 
live, and I've got a 
step to give, 
There'll be dancing left in old Uncle John. 
Oli, that's what the old man wants to do, 
Nature.

Say, Jim, dey say Nature can do ebery t'ing." 
" 
Well, I 
know one t'ing Nature can't do."

"Make Ike Gifferson's mouf any bigger widout

And when a

Her nose it was so berry long, it turned up like a 
squash, 
And when she got her dander up, dis darkey laughed,

Old massa had no hooks or nails, nor any t'ing like 
dat, 
So on de darkey's nose he used to hang his coat and 
hat. 
One morning massa gwine away, he went to get his 
coat, 
But neither coat nor hat was dar, for she had swallow'd 
both; 
He took her to a 
tailor's shop, to get her monf made 
small, 
She opened wide her  
and swallowed tailor shop 
and all.
