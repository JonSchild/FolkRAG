Public Subsidies and American Art
 
Neil Harris
 
For the Grantmakers in the Arts Conference,  Eureka

working draft
 
not to be quoted without permission
 
My presentation today addresses two simple questions,  which,
 
alas,  require  complex  answers.
 The  first  is  why,  almost  alone
 
among the developed nation states of the industrialized West,  this
 
country  so  long  resisted public  funding  for  the  arts.
 And  the
 
second is asking how government intervention was justified,  as it
 
gradually  and  painfully  emerged.
 My  method  will  be  to  try
 
periodizing our arts funding,  a story still basically untold.
 
I am an historian not a policy maker;  in fact I will end my
 
account  with  the  establishment  of  the  two  national  endowments
 
thirty years ago,  just when things really get interesting for arts
 
policy makers.
 Second,  in the time available I must operate on a
 
high level of generalization.
 Many exceptions will not quite fit
 
my account.
 But I offer so broad a picture because few others are
 
easily available.
 
The  traditional  explanation  for  American  suspicion  of  art
 
subsidies,  of the arts themselves,  evokes the Protestant roots of
 
2
 
British colonization and conjures up the misanthropic opposition of
 
Puritan leaders to theater, music,  the visual arts of painting and
 
sculpture,  to elaborate architecture,  to sensual indulgence of any
 
sort.
 Puritan values are easily caricatured; the basis for Puritan
 
iconoclasm went  far beyond misanthropy.
 But  it must be admitted
 
that  in New England and elsewhere there was skepticism about the
 
social value of the visual and performing arts.
 Such skepticism,
 
however,  is  far from a sufficient explanation.
 After all,  other
 
Protestant cultures--Great Britain, Switzerland, the German States,
 
Scandinavia--became,  in the  late  18th and 19th centuries,  active
 
official sponsors of the arts in various forms ranging from theater
 
troupes  and  opera  companies  to  art  museums  and  academies.
 To
 
explain  the  origin  of  American  attitudes  we  must  add  on  to
 
Protestantism a republican tradition that grew directly from our
 
Revolution and the golden age of American politics.
 
The  United  States,  with  some  spasmodic  interruptions  from
 
France,  was,  for much of  the  nineteenth century,  the  only major
 
republican world power.  Indeed this country was called by many The
 
Great  Republic,  to  signify  its  special  status.
 There  was  no
 
crowned
 head,
 court,
 or
 royal
 patronage
 to
 organize
 major
 
institutions around.
 This state of affairs rested on the values
 
supporting  the  very  establishment  of  the  United  States.
 To
 
radically summarize  them,  our nation state was born  in a fit  of
 
reaction against  concentrations of power and consumption.
 These
 
were  most  aptly  summarized  in  the  elaborate  pomp  and  artistic
 
regalia associated with church and state.  The great patrons of the
 
3
 
arts  in  post-Renaissance  Europe  had  been  crowned  heads,
 the
 
nobility,  and  the  churches.
 They  employed  composers,  actors,
 
painters,  sculptors,  and  architects.
 But,  to  critical  American
 
eyes,  when not used purely for private dissipation the arts were
 
exploited by patrons seeking mass influence.
 And to support such
 
sensory control, huge sums of money were raised through involuntary
 
public  contributions--taxes,  tithes,  etc.
 All  those
 palaces,
 
cathedrals,  abbeys, castles, villas, and country houses containing
 
the  art  treasures  of  Europe  seemed,  to  many Americans,  so  many
 
badges  of  shame,  levels  of  display  that  republican  simplicity
 
repudiated.
 A sense of government as small,  decentralized,  non-
interfering, non-controlling, deliberately avoiding the traditional
 
props  of  wealth  and  artistic  greatness,  this  was  part  of  the
 
republicanism that  dominated America in the age of Jefferson and
 
Jackson.
 American  judges  wore  no  wigs  or  robes;  there  was  no
 
standing army with gorgeous uniforms.
 American diplomats  abroad
 
refused to wear court dress.
 We had no elaborate official orders,
 
titles,  or decorations.
 
And,  before  the  Civil War,  the  first period  I am trying to
 
describe,  we  had  no  powerful,  national  cultural  institutions.
 
There  are  two  exceptions  and both are  instructive.
 One was  the
 
Library of Congress, which took its identity from the fact that it
 
was
 literally  the
 legislative
 library.
 The  other  was
 the
 
Smithsonian Institution,  a fluke,  if you will,  established because
 
of  the  unexpected  legacy  of  a wealthy  Briton,  impressed  by  the
 
United States as a more egalitarian and welcoming society than his
 
4
 
own. What other institutions existed in this country,  in the years
 
before the Civil War,  were  local,  privately supported,  often run
 
for profit, at least in theory, and widely various in structure and
 
interest.
 Their  influence  did  not  normally  extend  much  beyond
 
their  immediate  area.
 The  best  attended  museum  in  the  United
 
States was P.  T.  Barnum's American Museum.
 Private entrepreneurs
 
sought  to establish art galleries--Thomas Jefferson Bryan of New
 
York  did  so--but  they
 
established  lotteries
 
unions--but  they were
 
were  some
 
historical
 
orchestras
 
were  financial  failures.
 Art  lovers  even
 
to  encourage  patrons--these  were  the  art
 
destroyed as gambling institutions.
 There
 
significant  university  libraries
 
and  galleries  and
 
societies.
 but  they  were  usually  local.
 What
 
existed were stock companies in
 
few
 
which the musicians were
 
simultaneously  employers  and  employees.  Touring  performers  and
 
troupes operated under the  leadership of private  impresarios.
 A
 
bewildering  variety  of  financial  arrangements  underwrote  arts
 
organizations,  but  what  they  had  in  common  was  that  almost  no
 
public  monies  were  invested  in  them.
 Meanwhile  European nation
 
states,
 under  the  prod  of  competing  national  interests,
 were
 
expending  large  sums  of  money  gathering  art  and  antiquities,
 
specimens  of  science,  and  building,  in  Paris,  London,  Berlin,
 
Vienna,  Munich,  Madrid,  Stockholm,  museums,  theaters,  and  opera
 
houses.
 
But this contrast aside,  there did began to emerge the first
 
in  a lengthy  series  of  justifications  for official  art  support.
 
They would,  over time,  combine into a coalition.
 Artists,  it was
 
5
 
argued  in  America,  for  so  long  mercenaries  in  the  pay  of  the
 
wealthy and powerful, could,  in a democratic society, serve better
 
causes,  those of morality and freedom.
 Didacticism becomes the
 
first great lever to pry loose some official funds in the interests
 
of  the  arts,  and  this  meant,  in  practice,  hiring  artists  to
 
document reports like land surveys,  to adorn spaces,  exterior and
 
interior, controlled by the federal government, and to decorate its
 
coins, and  currency.
 The  most  notable  of  these  spaces  was,  of
 
course,  the Capitol Building and Congress turned to artists like
 
John Trumbull, painter of the famous shin piece, The Signing of the
 
Declaration of Independence, and others, to produce heroic versions
 
of  national  history.
 These,  and  the  statues  of  political- and
 
military heroes,  constituted not merely our first governmental art
 
subsidies  but,  for a considerable period of  time,  our only such
 
subsidies.
 
Various
 states--Virginia,
 North
 Carolina,
 
Massachusetts--commissioned their own statues of local heroes; and
 
a few  cities,  before  the  Civil  War,  donated  land  or  grounds  to
 
memorialize some figure.
 But statuary and painting,  like theater,
 
dance,  and  opera,  were  seen  as  private  concerns;  subscription
 
drives were mounted to gather funds to honor heroes,  and wealthy
 
citizens left or donated gifts for such purposes.
 This was true,
 
for  example,  of  the  Bunker  Hill  Monument  in  Charlestown,  which
 
literally had (and has)  its own proprietors.  Public libraries were
 
still rare;  states had to pass enabling legislation just to permit
 
municipalities to tax in their interest.  Not until the  1880s and
 
90s did more than a handful pass such legislation.
 
6
 
In the 1870s and 1880s, however, after the Civil War, one sees
 
signs  of  change  in  the  pattern  of  funding  American  cultural
 
institutions.
 The  most  dramatic  developments  of
 this  period
 
involved
 the
 private
 campaigns
 to
 found
 and  maintain
 such
 
organizations; between 1870 and 1890 one sees created,  among other
 
things,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  the Boston Museum of Fine
 
Arts,  the Art Institute of Chicago,  the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
 
the Metropolitan Opera Association,  the Detroit Institute of Arts,
 
the Cincinnati Museum of Art,  the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,  the
 
Newberry  Library,  a  long  list  of  venerable,  well  established,
 
ambitious,
 and
 today,
 relatively
 wealthy
 institutions
 with
 
prestigious
 reputations,
 important
 collections,
 professional
 
staffs.  They were created, however, largely on private initiative,
 
although,  in some cases,  local governments cooperated and public
 
authorities subsidized their establishment or expansion through the
 
gift of land,  the promise of construction money,  or the commitment
 
of  maintenance budgets.
 In Detroit,  starting  in  1893,  the  city
 
gave an annual  subsidy to permit  free admission.  The  complicated
 
public-private partnerships that are the New York Public Library,
 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  Chicago's Art  Institute,  are not
 
easy to summarize with precision.  But one can generalize by saying
 
that however important public monies were in maintaining museums,
 
their  collections  and professional  activities  were  sustained by
 
private  gifts,
 and  their  personalities  were  shaped  by  close
 
association  with  financial  and  social  elites.
 This  would  have
 
important consequences in class terms,  as the high arts,  at least,
 
-J
 
7
 
were increasingly considered the responsibility of the rich.
 
For performing institutions, public funds, even meager funds,
 
were notably absent,  with some interesting exceptions.
 The first
 
publicly  subsidized opera performance  in  the United  States  took
 
place only in the 1950s,  and that was a grant from a state,  Rhode
 
Island.
 Baltimore  was  the  only  American  city  to  have  a music
 
department  and a municipally
 
developed in the 20th century;
 
in 1935  to avert bankruptcy.
 
funded symphony orchestra,  and that
 
San Francisco took over its symphony
 
But  these were  sports.
 Until  the
 
1920s the first and only live music most Americans heard would have
 
been by bands,  although some of them were performing in city parks
 
with local  subsidies.
 Until then the first Beethoven,  Schubert,
 
Wagner,  Verdi,  Brahms,  or Mozart  would have been performed by a
 
band,  a large band with plenty of woodwinds,  if the listeners were
 
lucky.
 
Still,  something was happening to public art  support  in the
 
late 19th century that is worth considering.
 It was supplementary
 
to  the  didactic  appeals  I have  already  invoked.
 This  sentiment
 
might be  labeled Standing on Dignity.
 There were many Americans
 
who  felt,  after  the Union had been preserved at  such high cost,
 
that the reason for the collapse of national authority in the 1860s
 
had something  to do with the  absence  of visible  government,  the
 
scarcity  of  all  those  ceremonies,
 titles,
 monuments,
 massive
 
structures
 that
 had
 traditionally
 been
 associated
 with
 
sovereignty.  The federal government had largely been invisible for
 
the first two thirds of the century,
 In any event,  after the War's
 
I
N
 
8
 
end for the next  several decades a spasm of actions  specified the
 
religion  of  citizenship  and  objectified  the  power  of  the  state.
 
Thus,  in  the  late  19th  century  one  gets  a  flurry  of  brand  new
 
statehouses,  courthouses,  libraries,  public monuments,  fountains,
 
arches,  obelisks,  city halls, many of them elaborate and expensive.
 
We get as well the Daughters  (and Sons)  of the American Revolution,
 
the  Pledge  of  Allegiance,
 congressional  medals,
 and  patriotic
 
holidays.  As the century went on,  the new public buildings  filled
 
with elaborate murals and statuary,  most of them invoking history,
 
literature,  philosophy,  and religion.
 This provided work for many
 
dozens of painters,  sculptors,  and architects,  the money for which
 
came  mainly  from  taxpayers.
 Controversies  occasionally  erupted
 
around
 the
 artist
 competitions
 and
 the
 extravagance
 of
 the
 
programs,  but even in the United States there was little objection
 
raised to government' s dignifying itself and its  functions within
 
its own buildings.
 It was at this time,  as well,  that government,
 
indirectly  and  directly,  expanded  its  art  subsidies  by  means  of
 
world' s  fairs;  the  Fair  era  gets  going,
 in  essence,
 with  the
 
Centennial  Exposition  of  1876  held  in  Philadelphia.
 State  and
 
federal  governments  alike  erected  structures  on  the  fairgrounds,
 
organized exhibits,  offered land and space,  and generally enabled
 
these public-private partnerships. Sometimes fairs became occasions
 
in which great  public works  projects were undertaken  like parks,
 
rail
 electrification,
 new
 transport
 systems,
 or
 buildings
 
constructed  which  remained  long  after  the
 fair' s
 closing  as
 
permanent museums.
 Above all American fairs became places for our
 
9
 
national government to display its positive functions, things going
 
beyond coining money,  collecting tariffs,  or sustaining national
 
defense.  More than a dozen of these expositions took place between
 
the Centennial and the New Deal,  and they became places to sell the
 
public on the idea of governmental involvement with culture.
 
Aside from didacticism and the desire to dignify the power of
 
the state governmental involvement in the arts grew in this period
 
from  another  source:
 that  of  municipal  competition.
 Parks,
 
courthouses, monuments,  statuary, museums, these were,  like bigger
 
railroad stations,  department  stores,  opera houses,  sports  teams
 
and stadia, ways of showing insiders and outsiders that a community
 
was wealthy,  attractive,  and ripe  for investment.  While American
 
municipalities were not doing what they were in Europe at just this
 
time--building  public  housing,  subsidizing  orchestra,  theaters,
 
opera companies,  providing quarters for artists--the principle of
 
investing  in  cultural  institutions  as  a means  of  demonstrating
 
community  distinction  and  encouraging  still  more  growth,
 was
 
securely locked in well before World War I
.
 
Still,  it  must  be  emphasized  that  right  through  the  20s,
 
venues  for culture remained largely private.
 Carnegie Hall,  the
 
Auditorium in Chicago, the Metropolitan Opera House, Madison Square
 
Garden,  these  were  as  privately  owned  as  a vaudeville  theater,
 
department store,  or traction company,  even if their bond holders
 
and directors  sought no profits and claimed civic motives as the
 
basis for their investment.
 Internal tourism,  a not insignificant
 
force  in this same era,  was largely a private matter,  handled by
 
10
 
chambers  of  commerce,  railroad  companies,  hoteliers,  and  other
 
groups  interested  in  promoting  it.
 The  notion  that  cultural
 
centers, museums,  theaters,  opera houses,  ball parks, might add t
 
a city's  appeal  and  increase  its  economic  strength was  not,  i
 
fact, born in the mid 20th century; it was alive and well 100 year -
-
ago;  the  difference was  that  private  interests  were  expected to
 
concern themselves entirely with such developments.
 What the city
 
could, and did do, was execute plans for the harmonious location of
 
such  institutions,
 along  with  plazas,
 boulevards,
 lake  front
 
drives,  fountains,  underpasses,  and so on,  although even here the
 
plans  were  often  paid  for  by  local  clubs  and  civic  improvement
 
groups,  who presented the plans to their community as a gift.
 
Again,  there were exceptions;  in Detroit  the Common Council
 
authorized bond issues to expand the museum building,  leading,  in
 
fact  to  lawsuits  challenging  public  money  going  to  a private
 
institution,  but it was upheld.  The Missouri Legislature voted in
 
1908 to allow St. Louis to tax itself to support an art museum,  and
 
shortly  thereafter  city  funding  began.
 Los  Angeles  handsomely
 
subsidized  its museum complex,  the  origin of  today's  LACMA.
 In
 
fact  this  movement  deserves  more  attention  than  it  has  gotten.
 
Brooklyn,
 Buffalo,
 Fort  Wayne,
 Indiana,
 and  dozens  of  other
 
American  cities  contributed  to  the  maintenance  needs  of  art
 
museums.
 
Still,  a snapshot  of  arts  funding  in America on the  eve of
 
World War I
,  in 1914,  would disclose a system dominated by market
 
forces and private support;  while intervention appeared on almost
 
4
 
11
 
every level of government,  particularly the local,  it was modest
 
and largely confined to physical display,  to architecture and the
 
visual arts.
 Paintings, monuments, and mosaics might be fine, but
 
theater,  music,  opera, poetry,  dance, were not deemed appropriate
 
for official patronage.  Working musicians, actors, singers, poets,
 
photographers,  had to support  themselves,  for the most part,  by
 
doing other things  as well.  Some  taught  or coached;  worked  for
 
newspapers and magazines, or hired themselves out for special jobs.
 
Public  support was  indirect,  and would shortly become even more
 
indirect,
 through  income  tax  deductions  for  contributions  to
 
educational, health, and cultural organization.  This came in 1917,
 
not long after passage of the amendment to the constitution that
 
permitted imposition of a federal income tax.  This would prove in
 
time to be of extraordinary importance of course, and would produce
 
incredibly complex tax policies and advice.  But through the 1920s,
 
at least,  it had relatively little impact.
 
All this showed some faint signs of change because of American
 
involvement  in World War  I
.
 The  war  experience  should not  be
 
overstated; compared with the Depression a decade later, it was not
 
profound or permanent in its influence.
 But the need to mobilize
 
an  entire  population  in  eighteen  months,  to  create  a national
 
sentiment  in favor of the War,  to sell bonds,  conserve food and
 
fuel,
 accept  conscription,
 and  develop  intense  and  sweeping
 
patriotic  loyalties was a tall order.
 Government turned to the
 
arts  of  persuasion;  artists,  actors,  musicians,  photographers,
 
cinematographers,  all were pressed into service.
 Some vignettes
 
12
 
suggest  its  intensity:  Chaplin,  Fairbanks,  and  Pickford  on  tour
 
selling bonds;  Enrico  Caruso  singing Over  There,  in  Italian  and
 
English,  at rallies;  hundreds of posters designed by artists like
 
James
 Montgomery
 Flagg,
 Edward
 Blashfield,
 Howard
 Chandler
 
Christie,  floodlit public meetings,  floats,  special flag days,  the
 
Creel  Committee  on  Public  Information.
 Both Hollywood  and what
 
would  become  Madison  Avenue  went  to  war.
 Government  was,  in
 
effect,  using the arts  in ways that the Revolutionary generation
 
had  scorned,  turning  to  spectacle  and performers  for  support  in
 
defining a national purpose.
 In Europe such efforts were,  by this
 
time,
 completely
 unexceptional;
 here,
 by
 reason
 of
 their
 
comprehensiveness,  their  intensity,  their multi-media  character,
 
they were  almost unprecedented,  although they had some  immediate
 
origins in the Americanization pageants of the early 20th century.
 
And they accompanied,  as  some  feared,  high levels  of  intolerance
 
and repression.
 Arts subsidies were,  on this occasion as in many
 
others, enlisted in the cause of racial and ethnic stereotyping and
 
demonizing opponents
 
We  might  note  as  well,  in  the  period  fo l
lowing  the  war,  a
 
interlude  of  creating  community  centers  as  war  memorials,  with
 
public  funds,  to  host  performances  of  various  kinds.
 This  was
 
expansion  of  the  civic  auditorium tradition,  the  construction of
 
cavernous theaters to host conventions,  circuses,  public meetings.
 
They could be seen as a kind of subsidy to the performing arts.
 
There were also a few places where municipal subsidies really
 
mattered.
 St.  Louis  and Detroit,  for example,  which I mentioned
 
13
 
earlier,  purchased art works for their museums from public funds,
 
Detroit  actually spending hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  on  a
 
series of masterpieces recommended by its museum director, William
 
Valentiner.
 If exceptional,  they were not unimportant.
 And it is
 
during the 20s that major foundations start to underwrite the arts,
 
artists,  and museums,  especially the Carnegie and the Guggenheim
 
foundations.  Again,  tax policies could be said to express a public
 
interest in this kind of subsidy.
 
But with all the experience gained by the war effort,  and the
 
rise  in spending that took place in the prosperous 20s,  the true
 
watershed
 in  public
 subsidies
 to
 the
 arts
 comes
 with
 the
 
catastrophe  of  the  Depression  in  the  1930s,
 and  the -various
 
governmental  relief  programs  which  are  labelled  by  a string  of
 
acronyms:  PWAP,  FAP-WPA,  CWA,  and so on.  I will not go here into
 
any  details
 concerning  the  range  of  activities  the
 federal
 
government  supported  in  the  30s;  they  included,  of  course,
 a
 
federal theater project,  conservation and preservation activities
 
like  the  famous  Index  of  American  Design,  building  schemes  for
 
public works which employed architects,  federal writers
 
the establishment of  community art  centers,  the  famous
 
series,  the  living  newspaper,  the  murals  commissioned
 
projects,
 
guidebook
 
for  post
 
offices, hospitals, court houses, libraries, prisons, high schools,
 
museums,  and federal office buildings,  the posters which promoted
 
public health, museum exhibitions, trade shows, tourism, education.
 
All  of  this  has  been  examined  by  dozens  of  historians.  Less
 
attended  are  some  other  federally  supported  activities  of  this
 
14
 
period like the rebuilding and expansion of museums and galleries,
 
the hosting of concerts,  and a range of docent and instructional
 
activities which anticipated many things  the Endowments  now do,
 
including what was,  in effect,  a set of challenge grants.  It  is
 
sufficient to note that such subsidy was massive,  intense,  brief,
 
unprecedented,  and  highly  controversial.
 At  its  peak  the  WPA
 
employed thousands of artists.
 We were actually spending,  for a
 
short while, annually more than ten times the French appropriation
 
for the arts.
 The argument that  lay behind
 all this,  however,
 
was,
 
at
 last
 as
 presented
 by
 the
 administration,
 rather
 
conservative.
 Its thrust was that artists,  writers,  poets,  and
 
architects, like plumbers, steel workers, miners, and lumberjacks,
 
deserved relief  from the rigors of
 unemployment,  and something
 
approaching a living wage.
 But some administrators had a broader
 
vision of the function of subsidized art, and in their wake the New
 
Deal  programs  stirred  up  grander  rhetoric;  the  scale  of  these
 
operations--25 million people attended productions of the Federal
 
Theater,  2/3  of  them,  according to contemporaries,  never having
 
seen a play before; musicians played to aggregate audiences of 92
 
millions; 11 millions attended exhibitions of art or art classes--
led to claims about  the benefits,  the  lasting benefits,  of  such
 
activities,  of bringing culture to the masses.
 Again,  the early
 
arguments  in  favor  of  the  subsidies  were  made  around  strictly
 
humanitarian goals--why exclude  artists  from programs  that  were
 
open to so many others?
 But  once the  art,  music,  theater,  and
 
literature had been produced, it seemed perverse to ignore the real
 
15
 
benefits  brought  to  a  population  that  was,
 outside  of  major
 
metropolitan  areas,
 largely  untouched  by  live  performance  and
 
active exhibition,  at least of high culture.  Art For The Millions
 
became the slogan of the WPA leadership.
 
But the New Deal art programs,  I repeat, were brief, amazingly
 
brief.
 By 1938, after
 
by  1943  it  was  just
 
memories  and  legacies
 
just five years, the collapse had begun, and
 
about  complete.
 With  all  the  nostalgic
 
of  the  New Deal  arts,  it  is  difficult  to
 
realize that its peak was just five years, and the whole experience
 
not much more than ten.
 
years we  have had with
 
because of the anger and
 
Compare that,  if you will,  to the thirty
 
the Endowments.
 The programs were  brief
 
hostility of the Congressional opposition,
 
using  traditional  arguments  about  the  dangers  of  governmental
 
expansion,  the subversive character of the arts in general and of
 
these  artists  in  particular,
 the  waste  and  expense  of  such
 
subsidies,  and,  a newly emergent theme,  the need to concentrate on
 
the war effort.
 
It  is  striking to see how the theme of political  subversion
 
had been reversed in the previous hundred years.
 In the early 19th
 
century republicans worried about the uses of the arts made by the
 
monarchs and churchmen; in the mid twentieth century,  fears were of
 
the  left  rather  than  the  right.
 J.  Parnell  Thomas,  who  would
 
become
 notorious
 as
 the
 chairman  of
 the
 House
 Un-American
 
Activities  Committee,
 labelled  the  Federal  Theater  Project  a
 
"hotbed for Communists," and Martin Dies, also to become notorious,
 
claimed that the projects were propagandizing for Communism.
 This
 
16
 
theme,  particularly  when  modernist  forms  were  involved,  would
 
continue to be sounded by opponents of governmental subsidy.
 In
 
any  event,  what  was  not  destroyed  outright  by  Congress  was
 
transformed by the war effort; arts subsidies,  already damaged by
 
the late 1930s, were swamped by military mobilization.
 
Or so it appeared.  Despite the formal repudiation of the
 
Deal programs by Congress and by subsequent events,  the worldw:
 
conflict, and the Cold War confrontation that followed the War, set
 
the stage  for a series of new arguments that  collectively would
 
power various forms of intervention, extending them not only to the
 
traditional  high  arts  but  moving  into  newer  electronic  and
 
commercial  arenas  as  well.
 During  the  War,  for  example,  the
 
government,  in the form of figures like Nelson Rockefeller, turned
 
to Walt Disney for help influencing both North and South Americans;
 
the Office of War Information sought out other film makers;  the
 
State Department and other agencies requested art for exhibition
 
abroad or for installation in American embassies.
 After the War
 
foundations  paid  for  the  tours  of  famous  American  ensembles--
theater troupes, ballet companies, orchestras--and as the Cold War
 
heightened,
 the  theme  of  cultural  competition  became  a more
 
powerful  one.
 To  the  goals  of  didacticism,  state  dignity,
 
municipal competition,  and economic relief,  would now be added a
 
fifth reason to subsidize art in America, one that would prove,  in
 
the 60s, of greater power than any of the others put together.  And
 
that  was  the  ideological  value  of  public  art  support  in  an
 
international  contest  with  rival  political  systems,  art  as  a
 
-
a
 
17
 
justification now,  rather than as a threat,  to American democracy.
 
It  was,  I think many historians  agree,  the  Cold War which,  more
 
than  any  other  single  experience,
 propelled  forward  federal
 
support.
 
There  were  already,  to  be  sure,  some  growing  instances  of
 
state  support.
 In response  to grass  roots  demands,  and perhaps
 
some  internal  competitiveness  and  a  sense  of  tourist  growth,
 
individual states--North Carolina, Connecticut, New York--had begun
 
to provide funds for things like art museums and opera companies.
 
American  travel  abroad,  now  expanded  to  include  a  far  larger
 
public,
 impressed
 influential
 constituencies
 with
 just
 how
 
impoverished  European  governments,  were  spending  large  sums  of
 
money on the arts.
 The GI bill provided a considerably enlarged
 
group
 of
 college
 graduates,
 who  had  developed  more
 formal
 
educational experiences with literature and the arts.
 And there
 
remained some memories of the impressive if contested achievements
 
of the New Deal.
 Foundation generosity was increasing in extent,
 
accustoming people to the notion that,  from whatever source,  the
 
arts required some help; they could not simply be market oriented.
 
But admitting all this,  the energy,  the push,  the urge to get
 
the  national  government  into  the  business  of  making  grants  to
 
artists and art institutions rested on the notion of showcasing the
 
liberal  nation  state,
 contrasting  its  energy,
 vibrancy,
 and
 
experimentalism
 with
 the
 stodginess
 of
 its
 adversary,
 and
 
persuading  neutrals  that  not  only was  the  free  enterprise  West
 
better for political freedom,  it was more hospitable to artists as
 
 
I
 
18
 
well
 
grown convinced of the alliance that existed between left winger-
and  the  arts;  they  ridiculed  and  poked  fun  at  movements  like
 
abstract  expressionism.
 They  found  modern  literature  to  be
 
pornographic
 as
 well
 as
 subversive,
 arcane,
 diff:
 
understand; they were baffled by the acclaim that primiti
 
and uncomfortable with the  snobbery,  condescension,  and private
 
vocabularies that seemed to mark the metropolitan art worlds.
 
When  the  State  Department  sent  art  abroad,  as  in  the  famou.
 
Advancing American Art exhibition, when American entries at world'
 
fairs,  like the one in Brussels in 1958,  emphasized certain areas
 
of popular as opposed to high culture,  there were protests.
 But
 
through  the  50s  and  climaxing  in  the  1960s  with  the  Kennedy
 
Administration,  there  was  a sense  that  a rich  and  successful
 
society needed to demonstrate its power by harnessing the arts to
 
its  chariot.
 Parallels  with  Periclean  Athens,  Tudor  England,
 
Renaissance Italy,  were not absent from the rhetoric of those who
 
found American reluctance to subsidize art,  inappropriate to the
 
new golden age.
 International cultural exchange programs, sending
 
jazz  musicians  like  Dizzy  Gillespie,  symphony  orchestras,  and
 
various kinds of performers abroad,  had become a standard part of
 
diplomatic maneuvering by this time;  in four years,  in the  late
 
1950s,  89 countries received such cultural packages.  The Russians
 
responded in kind,  of course,  sending us various ballet and dance
 
1
 -
,
 
19
 
the
 Ed  Sullivan  Show.
 However,
 this  was  art
 for
 foreign
 
consumption.
 The issue of what and whether to do anything for the
 
arts at home remained an issue through the Kennedy administration,
 
although a series of bills introduced into the Congress in the late
 
50s and early 60s indicated a growing interest in doing something
 
about the larger project.
 
Essentially,  this  is where  I must  end.
 For  in the  1960s  a
 
whole series of new justifications for art support appeared which,
 
when  added  to  their  predecessors  constituted  a thorny  and  not
 
always  consistent  coalition  of  objectives.
 These  more  recent
 
goals,  moreover,  confused many of those trying to organize public
 
structures to support  them.
 Moralizing didacticism,  more than a
 
century  old  by  then,
 remained  important,
 of  course;
 so  did
 
municipal  competition,  state dignity,  and cold war expansionism,
 
the other justifications I have described.  Employment relief,  the
 
Depression  argument,
 lurked  below  the  surface,
 not  quite  as
 
powerful as it once was in this period of expanded job opportunity.
 
But to this were now added,  in the 1960s,  70s,  and 80s,  a set of
 
new entitlements; I mention, and I can do little more than mention,
 
just  four of them.
 They remain important today,  even central to
 
justifications  for art  support.
 Since they must be acknowledged
 
both  by  proponents  and  opponents  of  governmental  subsidies,
 I
 
present  them as  I close.
 They are  familiar to all  of you  I am
 
sure,  but  I emphasize  the  fact  that  they were  relatively new as
 
justifying arguments
 
The  first,  the  oldest,  and,  to  some,  the  most  persuasive,
 
20
 
contends  that  the  popular  and  commercial  arts  in  America--
especially  but  not  only  television--stand  in  need  of  reform,
 
uplift,  and,  above all,  competition;  they are variously seen as
 
vulgarizing,  corrupting,  narcotizing,  or hedonistic in the main.
 
Such  redemption  can  only  come  about,  the  argument  continues,
 
through certain kinds of public or non-profit funding,  like,  for
 
example, public broadcasting.
 This justification might be termed
 
the pursuit of artistic excellence,  subsidy as  an instrument  to
 
improve the level of artistic production.
 
The second set of arguments contends that various groups in
 
America, by reason of geography, region, economic class, social or
 
educational background,  have been systematically denied access to
 
the  arts.
 Bias  and  prejudice,  conscious  or  unconscious,  has
 
resulted  in  a  skewed  audience.
 Public  intervention  becomes
 
appropriate to assure some Americans of an entry to which they were
 
entitled but refused.  This argument might be termed the pursuit of
 
expansive equity,  and of new, more inclusive audiences
 
The  third  apologia  insists  that  various  cultures  wi T
hin
 
American life--so defined by racial, ethnic, gender, age or values-
-were so long refused effective recognition and nurture, that their
 
arts  accomplishments have  gone unrecognized by official  bodies.
 
Public  subsidy,
 it  is  said,
 could  compensate  for  years  of
 
systematic  and  self-serving  attention  deficits.
 This  argument
 
could be called the pursuit of pluralism.
 
And
 the
 fourth
 justification
 insists
 that
 immediate
 
institutional needs and donor preferences have combined to place at
 
21
 
risk  some  of  the  less  appealing  but  essential  aspects  of  art
 
practices:  conservation,  documentation,  record keeping,  physical
 
maintenance.
 Government support would do what others would not or
 
could not do.
 
Excellence,
 equity,
 representation,
 and  long-term  public
 
interest, this quartet of apologias, and I assume there are others
 
which I am omitting, have become an agenda for proponents of public
 
arts funding.  They are also,
 
and  private  funders  in  the
 
assumed special resonance in
 
to be sure, an agenda for foundations
 
non-profit  sector.
 But  they  have
 
the public sector,  and as the record
 
reveals,  have vastly complicated the task of arts administrators,
 
trying to mediate among them.
 Indeed,  some might argue, they have
 
overwhelmed  the  fragile  structures  so  recently  developed  to
 
translate  public  interest  into public  support.
 They raise,  of
 
course,  absorbing issues; their relative weight,  their relevance,
 
their  consistency,  their  relationship  to  older  justifications.
 
But,  as I indicated at the start,  just where the issues seem
 
to get especially interesting is the point I step off the train.
 
As an historian,  I wanted to present some of the rich background,
 
the complex and contested history of attitudes toward art subsidies
 
that  is  part  of  our  past.
 It  may  be  comforting  to  know  that
 
divisive debate,  demonizing opponents,  and widespread skepticism
 
are not new when applied to arts funding issues.
 But it also may
 
be disquieting to realize how long-lived are American attitudes,
 
and how successive generations of apologists have failed to shake,
 
for many, the sense that artistic achievement and activity are,  if
 
22
 
not  actually  subversive  to  consensual  opinion,
 irrelevant  to
 
community welfare  and  self-esteem.
 We  are  still  inheritors  of
 
suspicions that have never been effectively quieted,  and in an age
 
when contemporary art is identified with critical, adversarial, and
 
challenging postures,  the task for defenders of public funding is
 
even greater.  Ingenuity, innovation and improvisation, however, as
 
I
've tried to suggested, have been around a long time.  We can draw
 
on that record in the future,  so long as we recognize that there
 
remain basic attitudes and values that must be confronted directly.
 
In any event,  I look forward to the larger conversation.

I want to thank you for  inviting me and also to say that I
 
must stand here for artists all over the country for whom you have
 
been working, some of you for many years, in many ways, and so this
 
occasion gives me a chance on behalf of those artists to thank you
 
profoundly for your work.
 
I have been listening to your conversations for two days with
 
interest and I am not quite sure I know where we have arrived. My
 
impression is that over the first day and a half an analysis of the
 
difficulties developed that was very compelling; I was waiting for
 
the other shoe to drop and it didn't drop.  I don't know quite what
 
happened,
 but  I  sense  that  many  of  you  are  feeling  deeply
 
discouraged. So I discover I really have just a couple of things to
 
say to you.
 
The first thing is, I don't think you have been losing. I think
 
you have been winning.  I think the reason that the arts  and the
 
National  Endowment  for  the Arts  are  under  attack,  and  that  the
 
private philanthropies are soon going to be under attack,  is that
 
you have been winning.  No one would be after you if you weren't.
 
They would have no reason to. And so,  one of the things I feel is
 
that there is a certain amount of flinching going on because some
 
shots have been fired.  That's understandable,  but it won't do. We
 
have got to be in it for the long haul.  I listened to many people
 
who have said these last two days that the arts are in trouble in
 
America. I think the arts in America are really in very good shape.
 
I don't think people are going to look back and see this as the age
 
of  Jesses  helms.  They are going to  see this  as  the  age  of  Toni
 
Morrison. There are great artists working among us. Americans right
 
now  are  making  a powerful  art  in  many  different  forms.  Toni
 
Morrison won the Nobel Prize in Literature for making one of the
 
great bodies of work in fiction in the late twentieth century and
 
she  sits  among  a whole  group  of  novelists  (you might  each  name
 
different  ones:  Marilynn Robinson,  Maxine  Hong Kingston,  Cormac
 
McCarthy,  Robert Stone,  Thomas Pynchon--there are amazing writers
 
making art  in America).  Of the  last five poets to win the Nobel
 
Prize,  three have been American citizens and four  live and work
 
here because it is a climate very hospitable and alive to poetry.
 
They all live among us and teach young artists in America and they
 
are  supported  in  one  way  or  another  by  public  and  private
 
philanthropic funds for doing that.  Two of the four are doing it
 
here because they couldn't write in their own countries. For thirty
 
A
4 
years,  Czeslaw Milosz could not publish in his native country.  He
 
became  an  American  citizen,  lived  here,  and  wrote  some  of  the
 
indelible poems of the twentieth century.  he is eighty years old
 
and  still  doing  it.  Joseph  Brodsky  has  a similar  story.  Derek
 
Walcott brought his work from the Caribbean to Boston and works
 
there.  Seamus Heaney took a visiting job as a young poet at the
 
University  of  California  at  Berkeley  because  there  were  people
 
there who cared about and were alert to the art of poetry.  He now
 
teaches  half  the  year  at  Harvard.  In  fact,  there  has  been  an
 
enormous explosion of poetry in this country in the last fifteen or
 
twenty years. From a condition of muteness in the literary record,
 
a very powerful Native American literature has developed in English
 
in  the  last  two  decades.  There  has  been  an  explosion  of  Asian
 
American writing.  The kids I teach at Berkeley  (half of them are
 
Asian American)  are pouring into the painting classes,  literature
 
classes,
 creative  writing  classes.  They  have  models  for  the
 
possibility  of  it,
 and  they  want  to  make  art.
 The  private
 
philanthropies and the National  endowment  for the Arts  over  the
 
last fifteen or twenty years have poured millions of dollars into
 
the  creation  of  a  multicultural  America  that  can  share  its
 
imaginative experience and we have succeeded and we have scared the
 
wits out of people,  some people. The evidence of the polls is that
 
they are far from the majority of Americans. The health of African
 
American writing, of Latino writing, of Gay and Lesbian writing all
 
over  the  country  is  vividly  apparent.  There  are  networks  of
 
distribution for new and experimental work, and audiences turn out
 
in bookstores.  There  is too much  interesting writing to read  it
 
all.
 
Think of the power of American art and American painting and
 
American dance in the twentieth century. Their power and influence
 
have been profound almost everywhere in the world and they're still
 
alive and flourishing. American composers are being performed all
 
over Europe which is a reversal of the natural order.  This summer
 
in Vienna, what you heard was Bernstein and Ives and Ellington and
 
Copland,  over and over again.  The American arts  in the twentieth
 
century  have  been  extraordinary,  powerful,  world-changing  and
 
powerful.  And  this  continues  even  in  small  ways  to  be  true.  80
 
Langston Street in San Francisco, which was designed mainly as an
 
art space and helped along by the private philanthropies,  became a
 
place  for  a  small  group  of  writers  interested  in  postmodern
 
problems to get together and talk.  Some of them are now,  in France
 
which is particularly hospitable to writing which begins in theory,
 
the most translated and most talked-about of American writers. They
 
are not read much here yet,  but they are being translated there,
 
and  they  are  translating  European  writers,  mostly  French  and
 
Russian writers  of  similar  aesthetic  concerns,  so  that  a lively
 
international  conversation  about  the  shape  of  consciousness  is
 
going  on  well  below  the  threshold  of  public  attention.  Several
 
books of poems,  book-length poems,  mostly by women,  have appeared
 
recently--Louise Gluck's The Wild Iris, published partly by funds
 
from  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts,  my wife's  book  Death
  
Tractates, Jorie Graham's Materialism, published partly with funds
 
from  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts.  Immediately  in  small
 
presses,  articles  started  appearing  on  a new  changed  feminist
 
1
.
 
poetry of philosophical and spiritual ambitions. I have seen essays
 
(because my wife gets clippings  from her publisher)  on this  new
 
trend  in  American  writing  in  newspapers  and  literary  magazines
 
around the world--in Sabado, the cultural weekend edition of the
 
Mexico  City  paper,  in  a Stockholm  literary  magazine.  There  was
 
something about it in the Milan newspaper in the cultural pages.
 
American work  is still out there in the world,  taking part  in a
 
world conversation, and it is work that you have cultivated in lots
 
of different ways,  cultivated and supported.
 
I know that you are under attack,  but it is important to say
 
that you have succeeded in a lot of ways.  American art is alive.
 
And artists are like cockroaches.  If everything goes down,  we'll
 
find ways to survive in the cracks.  The survival of art isn't the
 
question. It is our political and cultural systems that are in real
 
trouble.  It is not our arts that are in trouble.  They are in real
 
good health,  I think.  So that is one thing I want to say to you.
 
That you have been winning, and what you have to do when they start
 
shooting at you because you have been successful is fight back, not
 
take it. Their campaign is highly organized and it really has very
 
little to do with art. Almost every organization that has taken a
 
hit has taken a hit for political/cultural reasons.  The only part
 
of  the  Smithsonian,  I'm  told,  to  take  a serious  cut  was  the
 
department  of  cultural  and  social  history.
 The  rest  of  the
 
institution suffered just a little belt-tightening.  The National
 
Gallery--dead  Italian  males  of  the  sixteenth  century  who  give
 
imperial grandeur to Washington:  no problem.  They even got a new
 
skylight.  (But what would  Strom Thurmond say  if  Carravaggio was
 
walking  among us!)  The Kennedy  Center--it's programs  are mostly
 
privately  funded--but  tax  money  pays  for  the  upkeep  of  the
 
buildings and  it  is a place that people can go  in black tie and
 
take  visiting  dignitaries  to:  so  far,  no  problem.  The  National
 
endowment  for the Humanities and the National  Endowment  for  the
 
Arts.. .that's  politics.  That's  cultural  politics.
 It  isn't  a
 
question of government support for the arts. From military bands to
 
public  monuments  to  our  great  National  Gallery,  there  is  ample
 
evidence that they aren't really against federal support for the
 
arts. They are against support for ideas that threaten about 15% of
 
this country who are going to have to learn to change or die and
 
let their children do the changing.  In the meantime,  we have to
 
fight back,  we have to find ways to fight back.
 
The excuse that they are using for this assault,  I would like
 
to talk about that for a minute.  Why is it going on? The form it
 
has taken is political; the argument for it is economic. So what is
 
the real economic story here? I think the real story is that at the
 
end  of  World  War  II  the  United  States  was  the  only  industrial
 
economy in the world that was not destroyed or badly damaged.  We
 
had an effective monopoly on the world market.  Now anyone with a
 
brain  in his head would guess that this eventually was going to
 
change--that  it  was  going  to  change--that  these  countries  were
 
going  to  regrow  their  infrastructures  and  that  they  would  then
 
compete with us and that we would become a nation among nations
 
and,  insofar as we are merchants,  competitors with other peoples,
 
that this was going to happen.  Instead we have taken the years of
 
the 1950's and 1960's,  first of all,  not as luck but as virtue.  A
 
key thing:  not as luck,  but as virtue.  Then we set those years up
 
as the measure against which the success of the American social and
 
economic and cultural enterprise was to be measured.  It's crazy!
 
Leaving
 aside
 other
 developments,
 the
 so-called
 
internationalization of capital and labor,  it's crazy.  It is not
 
how the world is constructed.  We have to learn how to adjust our
 
expectations  and  be  a people  among  people.  The  results  of  this
 
increased economic competition have bee,  all things considered,
 
relatively modest. We are an extremely rich country experiencing a
 
mild  shrinking  in  our  relative wealth.  (I  don't  mean  that  this
 
hasn't hurt a lot of people;  and it's going to hurt more before
 
it's through.)  But what we have been experiencing is what we might
 
have anticipated:  some reduction in the relative wealth of a very
 
large  and  very  wealthy  country.  And  the  result  has  been  the
 
unedifying spectacle of a bunch of what guys in business suits in
 
a lifeboat that has sprung a small leak throwing out the women, the
 
children, and the old people as fast as they can. They are doing it
 
in the name of market ideology which they claim was the source of
 
our great wealth and great virtue in the first place that we are in
 
danger of losing because of the misguided and sentimental ideas of
 
people like us.  That is the fundamental argument.
 
So let me say something about that. The first thing to say is
 
that markets  don't make  communities.  Markets make  networks.  Art
 
makes  communities.
 Religion  makes  communities.
 Families  make
 
communities.  You know the presence of  community when people  are
 
giving without knowing exactly what they are going to get back.
 
This is the opposite of the market system. The first philosophical
 
defender of the market system, explicator of the market system, was
 
Jeremy  Bentham  who,  following  on  Adam  Smith,  said,  "The  ideal
 
citizen  of  a market  society  is  perfectly  rational,  perfectly
 
selfish,  and perfectly free." No human being is any one of these
 
things.  The  market  has  great  and  useful  powers.  It  unleashes
 
entrepreneurial energy,  it can set prices,  deliver products,  and
 
probably most importantly give to a whole range of kinds of work a
 
sense of play.  One of the destructive things  about the  forms of
 
socialism that have actually been tried in the twentieth century is
 
that they involved way too much policing of economic behavior and
 
so they gave the state too much power.  There are clearly terrific
 
virtues to the market system and it is a system in which a lot of
 
people get to play and use their imaginations and practice their
 
energies  at  large,  but  it doesn't make communities.  That  is  not
 
what it does. Market values are the opposite of community values.
 
When you go to the store that has the cheapest stuff,  one of the
 
things you get to do is not necessarily look at the clerk or greet
 
the clerk. You go there, you get what you want, you come out,  it's
 
cheap.  You have had a transaction.  That is,  a market transaction.
 
When  you  go  to  the  neighborhood  store,  even  though  it's  more
 
expensive,  because it is in your neighborhood and makes you feel
 
located and known on the earth,  and you spend a little more time
 
and you say hello and they ask you about your kids, that's another
 
kind of transaction.  When you go to somebody's house and bring a
 
bottle of inexpensive Chablis and they come back to your house the
 
0Y
IN
 
next  time  they  are  invited  to  dinner  and  give  you  a bottle  of
 
Chablis of the same price,  that is a market transaction.  When you
 
get a bottle of wine for somebody for dinner and you buy the wine
 
you are in the mood to buy because it is Friday and you like your
 
friends  and  you're  feeling  celebratory,  that's  another  kind  of
 
transaction.
 
There is a book on this subject that I want to recommend to
 
you because I think it is very useful for understanding the kind of
 
society that we actually  live  in,  rather than the  imaginary one
 
under whose banner the attacks on the arts are taking place.  It is
 
Lewis Hyde's The Gift. I think the subtitle is "Imagination and the
 
Erotic Life of Property." Lewis Hyde does work supported by private
 
philanthropy;  he  is  a MacArthur  fellow.  He  is  also  an  original
 
social thinker on the subject of American economics. The point that
 
Hyde makes over and over again is that always in human life we have
 
two kinds of economies operating;  one of them is a market economy
 
which is efficient, quantitative, you can count it, it does certain
 
kinds of  things  extremely well,  and  it deemphasizes  bonding  and
 
personal relationships. Its raison d'etre is competition and self-
interest which,  in their place,  have terrific uses in human life.
 
They  free  us  up  in  lots  of  ways.  But  we  have  another  kind  of
 
economy  that  is  operating  all  the  time  and  that  our  economists
 
don't  address,  and  that's  the  gift  economy.  The  gift  economy
 
involves less intentionally quantifying behavior. In relationships
 
between two people,  friends exchanging Christmas presents over the
 
years,  it's hard not to notice and therefore to engage in evening-
out behavior.  Gifts  in  families pass out of  sight;  it's hard to
 
keep count.  In fact whenever the gift passes out of sight,  you're
 
in  a gift  economy.  Teachers  who  work  very  hard,  sometimes  at
 
unrewarding tasks, and can't really know the results of their work:
 
teaching is in the gift economy.  Healing is  in the gift economy.
 
Institutional support of our community organizations is in the gift
 
economy.  Art is in the gift economy.  Probably the classic example
 
of the gift economy
 is parenting because it is a perfect example
 
of hard,  dedicated work,  mixed with much joy,  in which you don't
 
quite know what you are going to get back for what you have given,
 
and that's the deal.
 
This
 is  not  isolated  behavior.
 It  is  fundamental  human
 
behavior.  In his book Hyde analyzes the way gifts work  in fairy
 
tales,  the ritual circulation of gifts  in Melanesian society;  he
 
studies  potlatches,  the  organization  of  salmon  rituals  on  the
 
Pacific Northwest coast where the appearance of the salmon runs was
 
understood to be a gift; he studies kidney donation,  what happens
 
to Black families in Chicago when they receive  inheritances from
 
family  land  in the  south that has  been  sold  and have  to  choose
 
between sharing it out among all of their extended families with
 
varying and pressing needs or saving the capital and maybe buying
 
a  small  store  and  getting  started  in  business.  These  choices
 
between the market economy and the gift economy occur in our lives
 
all the time. Given the way our society works, we are operating in
 
the  gift  economy when we  send our kids to  college.  There  is  no
 
special return to us from it. No return in the market system. Well,
 
I could go on about this.
 
It's very important that people in this country understand that
 
p
.
  
I
  
it  is  simply not true that we  live  in a market  economy  or  that
 
American virtue has very much to do with a market economy. This is
 
not to say that much in our tradition of individualism and personal
 
freedom  doesn't  come  out  of  it,  but  much  in  our  tradition  and
 
practically  all  of  our  sense  of  community  comes  from  someplace
 
else, because markets don't make communities. The imagination makes
 
communities.  The imagination makes communities by embodying it in
 
gifts given and made in labor that we can't know the results of.
 
This is what you people do all the time. You work very hard to make
 
things happen and you can't really quantify the results you care
 
most about.  At some time in your life you received a gift.
 
You fell in love with one art form or another in a way that you had
 
to respond to and behave in relation to.  You wanted to make that
 
experience available to other people and you are operating under a
 
real,  though  invisible,  debt  incurred.  You got  "gifted"  and you
 
want  to  give  somebody  else  that  gift.  We  have  all  kinds  of
 
mechanisms  for  translating  the  market  economy  into  the  gift
 
economy.  The patent office is one way we translate inventiveness
 
into the market society.  Then we end patents at a certain time so
 
that it flows back into the gift economy where it belongs and where
 
it came from.  Copyright does the same thing; transforms something
 
into the market economy. Then you take away copyright and the work
 
is transformed back into the gift society. All through our society
 
there are these transformer mechanism designed for this purpose:
 
they pass stuff that belongs essentially to the gift economy into
 
the  market  economy  for  a while  where  it  can  take  the  form  of
 
personal property and can play for awhile, and then they return it
 
to its proper home in the gift economy.  All of your institutions
 
belong to these transforming mechanisms. You are hard at that work,
 
either helping to put the gifts of art into the market economy or
 
helping to take them out of  it so that they can circulate in the
 
way that does the work of bonding.
 
I hope it's clear that this is not a quaint conceit,  that I am
 
describing  the  actual  terms  of  social  life  as  we  live  it.  Our
 
society,  every human society,  has a mix of  a particular kind of
 
cultural  gift  economy  and  a particular  kind  of  rational  market
 
economy  and  the  play  between  the  two  makes  the  cultural  and
 
economic  institutions  of  the  country.
 In  the  old  notion  of
 
conservative and liberal, the conservatives were people who favored
 
maximum market mechanism and minimum gift mechanism.  Liberals were
 
people who favored more gift mechanism, or gift-enabling mechanism.
 
Now  there  is  a  new  breed
 (well,
 not  so  much  new  as  newly
 
respectable)  of conservatives who claim to be in favor of a pure
 
market model or at least of government that can approach as nearly
 
to  their  ideal  as  possible.  And  it  is  craziness.  Drug  dealers
 
operate in a pure market economy.  It is no trick to operate in a
 
pure market economy. You just have to be willing not to care about
 
anything else.  It doesn't make communities. This is why we have to
 
make an argument for the National endowment for the Arts and why
 
you have to make arguments  inside your own  institutions  for the
 
kind of work you do.  You have to have art to make communities.
 
Let me  remind you  of  the justifications  that  Professor Neil
 
described in his presentation the other day for a governmental role
 
in  the  care  and  feeding  of  the  arts.  He  said  that  the  first
 
I
t
 
justification,  in the history of the republic,  for supporting the
 
arts  was  didactic;  that  is  to  say,  they  wanted  to  teach  moral
 
values.  In the second stage of the development of patronage,  the
 
justification  was  that  it  promoted  a religion  of  citizenship;
 
another way to say that is that they wanted to create community.
 
The
 third
 stage
 involved
 the
 City
 Beautiful
 movement
 and
 
competition
 among
 municipalities,
 one
 aspect
 of
 which
 was
 
competition  for  tourism,  the  location  of  business,  and  so  on.
 
Another way of saying this is that they wanted to celebrate place.
 
To help shape the moral lives of individuals, to create bonds among
 
them,
 to  help  shape  in  these  communities  a  responsible  and
 
affectionate relation to place. It would be hard to argue that this
 
is work not worth doing,  or that these are things in which e have
 
no national interest as a people.
 
I took a train through New Jersey a week or two ago.  I found
 
myself  going  past  Paterson,  past  fields  on  the  outskirts  of
 
Paterson and there were crows hovering above them and I thought of
 
Allen Ginsberg's great poem  "Kaddish"  about  a young boy dealing
 
with a paranoid schizophrenic mother,  way too young to be taking
 
her to a hospital  for  the mentally  ill.  And the rhythms  of  the
 
poem.  Ginsberg in the middle of the McCarthy 1950's "vomiting his
 
paranoia," as he said,  his boy's shame at his mother's condition
 
and therefore at his own.  At the end of the poem he is trying to
 
figure out whether to bless or curse existence,  and he sees those
 
crows that I saw.  They're going Caw,  Caw,  Caw and he wants to end
 
the poem with a prayer and says Lord, Lord, Lord, and the crows go
 
Caw, Caw, Caw, and the poet says Lord, Lord, Lord, and the crows go
 
Caw,  Caw,  Caw.  I grew up in California. What is New Jersey to me,
 
two thousand miles away? I took in that landscape and the poem with
 
it that echoes in my memory and a vivid sense of the life that had
 
been lived there with its usual and inexplicable human suffering.
 
That is the work that the imagination does. We take in a sense of
 
connectedness  to different  lives  than  our own,  different places
 
than our own,  different cultures:  Pueblo people of the Southwest,
 
French  Canadians  in  Maine,  African  Americans  in  an  Ohio  River
 
valley.  American art and American music and American theater give
 
that to us,  to make us a people.  If we don't defend that and say
 
that it matters,  if we accept the market model in which the market
 
is supposed to deliver the goods of culture--which the politicians,
 
by  the  way,  are  very  busy  deploring  out  of  one  side  of  their
 
mouths, while they want to get rid of the National Endowments with
 
the other.
.
. It's ridiculous.  It is not even grown-up, the position
 
they have taken. Their ideas are contradictory in the most ordinary
 
way.
 
I want to take up one more historical  idea and then I'll be
 
through.
 Literacy  in  this  country  developed  slowly.
 In  1800
 
something  like  60%  of  European American males  could write  their
 
names  and  25%  of  European  American  women.  People  were  quite
 
literate in New England and mostly illiterate in the South and on
 
the  frontier.  African Americans,  of  course,  could be killed  for
 
trying  to  learn  to  read.  By  the  end of  the  nineteenth  century,
 
there was something like 95%  adult literacy; 85-95% literacy among
 
men  and women,  black  and white,  in  this  country  because  of  the
