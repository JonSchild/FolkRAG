Mrs. Petrenko explained that her family came to the U.S. 
after living 
in Brazil for many years after WWII. 
There were not 
very many Russians in their community in Brazil. 
The Russian 
community here was much larger. 
She basically grew up 
in Brazil 
and had many friends there. 
She describes the events of St. Vladimir's Festival. 
After 
the blessing in the church, people get some blessed water to take 
home. 
The blessing of the water takes place at the lake. 
It is 
preceded by services in 
the church and a procession of the 
congregation, carrying icons (sometimes including "visiting" [my 
word] icons from other churches). 
She mentions that a miracle 
working icon has been part of their festival procession before. 
They also carry banners. 
She has a key to the church, and 
offered to take us there that afternoon. 
(celebration) 
The lake 
is 
in front of or across from the Information 
Center in Rova Farms, so the procession crosses the parking lot 
adjoining the church and the restaurant/ activity center that 
fronts on the 
lake. 
The ceremony of the blessing of the water 
commemorates the baptism of Russia, or the Christianizing of the 
country by St. Vladimir. 
Water is blessed in the church on other 
occasions also, but always in the church, not at the lake. 
On 
January 6 in Russia, however, she recalled that many parishes 
would have services at a nearby body of water. 
At her old parish 
in Trenton, they would bless water on January 6 inside the 
Moonsammy--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 1 
church. 
Water is put in containers beside the lake and blessed. 
The 
water is probably not from the lake, she thinks, because some 
people drink blessed water, and she doesn't think that they would 
consider using water in which people swim. 
In the past, people 
would never swim in the 
lake during the ceremony, but now, she 
says, people sometimes are swimming in the lake at that time. 
After the blessing, the procession returns to the church for a 
few more services, and then everyone goes to the feast. 
They do 
not have hall 
now, so they put up a canopy or tent for the feast. 
The feast is for the priests and bishops who come from as 
far away as Canada for participation in the festival. 
They are 
guests at this banquet. 
The Sisterhood also sells food to the 
people who come for the festival. 
This will 
be the Russian food 
that people look forward to being able to get here: 
borscht — a 
Russian vegetable soup; 
chalupsky (spelling questionable; 
she 
pronounced it hu—loop—see), which she also called "pigs 
in 
blankets," which is cabbage around a meat and rice filling. 
They 
also have kielbasa and sauerkraut, salads, chicken, hamburgers, 
and other American food. 
Mostly the people go for the Russian 
food. 
Sometimes they prepare blini, which she described as a 
crepe with cheese. They serve sour cream because the Russian 
people use a lot of 
it. 
The main food they prepare is piroshki, 
stuffed with cabbage and meat. 
Much of the food is prepared by 
women in their homes and donated to be sold. The sausage is 
purchased rather than made by the women. 
(foodways) 
As many as 3,000 people may come to the festival, but many 
more used to come. 
They would come from all 
over the country. 
Now, she says, the people are getting old and 
it 
is harder for 
them to commute. 
The young people are less interested. 
There 
are no other structured activities in the day. 
Books and 
artifacts from the monastery are for sale that day, and people 
also visit with each other. 
There is no music or dancing. 
120 
The women in the Sisterhood are 
responsible for caring for 
the church and "redressing" the church for the festivities. 
On 
Sundays the church is dressed in yellow or gold. 
Small altars or 
stands hold the icons, and they have gold runners and doilies on 
the top. 
For big festivities or any holiday dedicated to Jesus 
Christ, the church is dressed in white. 
On holidays dedicated to 
Our Lady, everything is 
in blue. 
During Lent, they use red or 
sometimes purple. 
During Holy Week, the church is 
in black. 
They usually order flowers for the special feast days from 
commercial suppliers. 
However, on the holiday that is fifty days 
after Easter, Pentecost, they decorate the church with all 
kinds 
of greens — branches, leaves, etc., all 
over the church. 
People 
also decorate their homes in that way; 
Mrs. Petrenko still does. 
She gathers any kind of tree or bush that is green at that time. 
Her daughter helps her. 
In Russia, they used to put fresh grass 
Moonsammy--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
on the floor on that day. (plant) 
Some of the kinds of greenery that she gathers for that 
day are: 
birch, because her mother has a preference for that 
tree because it was abundant in the area 
in Russia that she lived 
in; 
(There was also pine 
in that area of Russia, but they do not 
use pine to decorate on that day. 
Her mother also likes 
gooseberry bushes, so Mrs. Petrenko grows them.) oak; 
locust; 
hickory, and hickory nuts. It 
is usually too early 
in the season 
for her garden flowers. 
In the church on that day, the women of the Sisterhood give 
out small bunches of flowers that they gather in the wild, 
like 
daisies and black—eyed Susans, she says. 
Anything that is 
blossoming they put into bunches with greenery with stalks of 
wheat that they gather in the fields of farmers. 
She gathers mushrooms of many varieties. 
She thinks she must 
pick over twenty varieties, some on her own property and some in 
Browns Mills. 
There are also mushrooms in the woods around 
Jackson Township near the parish, but she hasn't gathered there. 
Other people of other nationalities also pick mushrooms, some of 
them different from those she picks. 
(plant) 
She pickles most of her mushrooms and saves them for Lent 
when she and her family eat no dairy or meat. 
All 
of the 
mushrooms that she picks were familiar to her mother in Russia, 
and her mother taught her to pick them. 
They have to be 
identified visually rather than by verbal description. 
(foodways) 
She also uses them in gravies and sauces. 
She uses gravy 
mixes, but describes her kitchen as 
including a variety, 
representing the different countries of her experience. 
She 
prepares Russian dishes. 
Borscht is a favorite of her husband, 
who likes to have soup with every meal. 
The children prefer 
American food. 
She doesn't use mushrooms in borscht because not 
all 
her kids like mushrooms. 
She stuffs mushrooms as per the 
recipe of a Hungarian lady who taught her. 
They gather mushrooms at this time of year (October) and also 
in the summer and spring when it's hot and wet. 
She agreed to go 
mushroom hunting with us. 
She knows Russian names for some, and 
others only by sight. 
On the tape she names some of them 
and 
describes them.C2913 
The name of a mushroom varies even 
in Russian, depending on 
the locale. 
She also describes some of the growing environments. 
For instance, each mushroom has its own "community," or 
environment. 
Some grow under nut trees, etc. All 
of the old 
ladies pick mushrooms. 
women. [3203 
She pickles them with vinegar and salt. 
She explains that in 
Moonsammy--B3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
her life she does nothing by books and recipes, that she lives 
out where stores are not accessible. 
She does not drive, and so 
she has learned to 
improvise with what is available. 
The 
methods 
in the Russian cookbooks take too long, too. 
Returning to the subject of Pentecost, there are no 
particular kinds of trees or other greenery that are used 
in 
the 
church. 
It is the one time during the year when the church is 
dressed in green, 
including the vestments worn by the priest. 
She recalls no other occasions on which they have church 
services outside. 
The music and language 
in church are in Slavonic. 
She 
compares it to the use of Latin in the Roman Catholic church, and 
the parishioners' understanding of 
it as analogous to the 
Catholic's.

She recounts an origin story of how and why an icon of the 
Virgin began performing miracles: 
a soldier struck the icon with 
his saber and blood flowed from the icon. 
Other stories include 
icons speaking, traveling, appearing in dreams. 
Stories show 
prominence of artifacts as socio—religious symbols 
in community, 
and tie

Discusses whether the area around the church represents a 
"Russian environment" for the community: 
the church is named 
after St. Vladimir who baptized Russia in Kiev. 
She recalls how 
St. Vladimir's church in Kiev 
is situated on a hill with a long 
stairway, similar to the situation of St. Vladimir's in Rova. 
(She mentions that her home 
is only 8 or 9 miles from St. 
Vladimir's. 
N.B. not so far from Pinelands National Reserve and 
Cassville.) 
She doesn't know why the Cassville area was chosen 
for Rova.
