Dear Bess,
 
First, I would like to thank you for coming way out to Wyoming to be with us.  Your
 
presence and ple
'sant personality added a dimension to our effort.  This letter has
 
been delayed because I wanted to include a transcript of your t
alk, but for s
ome rea—
 
s
on it never came out on the tape.  We were looking around to s
ee if s
omeone else may
 
have taped it, but we were the only ones.
 
We have obtained a small grant to transcribe the tapes, edit them, and to have them
 
printed up.  All of the others came out OK, and are developing.  Could we impose upon
 
you once again to s
end us a copy of a 20 minute s
peech where you address the same things
 
that you did here.  Or you could reconstruct the t
alk and s
end us that.  It is important
 
that we include your contribution.  More people should know of your s
ection, your work,
 
concern, and all the rest.  If you could do this and s
end it to us in two weeks, that
 
would be good and we would include it in The Proceedings of the Third Annual Plains
 
Indian Seminar.
 
Earlier this week Elizabeth A
. Dear visited as a consultant.  She stopped here before
 
she went back East to read for your organization.  She is a nice person too.
 
We look forward to receiving the 20 minute s
cript, and we would appreciate it if you
 
0
2
 could send us more information an d an  app li ca tion  form  from  your
 s
ection.
 
One  of  these
 
days when I am there, I will stop by and we can eat together.  Thanks again.

We find over and over again that where local art forms have been respected
 
and even cultivated in a dignified manner, new and different artistic
 
experiences came to be appreciated and even relished.  What might otherwise
 
be seen as "bringing culture to the uneducated" becomes a process of sharing,
 
of mutual appreciation.  I have had the unusual experience of sitting with
 
a group of Papago Indians in Tucson, Arizona, while they listened gravely
 
and attentively to the playing of a Chinese chin, a fore-runner of the
 
modern violin.  The evident interest they showed to this somewhat esoteric
 
music was in no small part due to the fact that their own musical tradition
 
choral singing accompanied by drum and rattles -- had received not only equal
 
time but an effective and interesting presentation on the same program.
 
The Cajun music of southwestern Louisiana, a fascinating mixture of French,
 
African, Indian and Anglo musical elements, has long been derided by upper-class
 
New Orleans sophisticates, as "country" music and not worth consideration.
 
Efforts to bring Cajun music into local schools, to use familiar sounds and
 
tunes as a base for the musical education of Cajun children, have been rejected
 
by local school boards with  depressing regularity.  Their children A
 to learn
 
"good" music.
 
A few years ago, the long term efforts of a group of Cajun cultural experts
 
were successful:
 spurred by a small grant from Folk Arts and with additional
 
support from the Louisiana Arts Council, the outstanding Cajun fiddler,
 
Dewey Balfa, was allowed to present programs of Cajun music in schools
 
throughout the Cajun parishes.  The children were ecstatic, and principals
 
1
.
 
and t
eachers were impressed by the depth o
f t
he historical and musico-
l
ogical analyses offered by Mr. Balfa, a l
ocal s
chool bus driver, as he
 
explained his music t
o the classes.
 
I t
elephone4Mr. Balfa a month or so later, relaxed and t
riumphant at
 
the obvious success of our l
ong campaign.  He didn't let up f
or a minute.
 
"Oh, i
t's just wonderful.  I never thought I
'd live t
o see our own beautiful
 
music played i
n t
he schools, and everybody i
s s
o happy about i
t.  But I
'm
 
beginning t
o worry.  I don't think our Cajun children ought to be l
imited
 
t
o just Cajun music; there's l
ots of other folks down here -- Spanish and Black
 
and Indian.  They ought t
o be hearing their music t
oo, and they ought t
o
 
have t
he big time music f
rom  New Orleans.  Our children ought t
o have the
 
best f
rom everybody..."
 
S
o we s
tarted back t
o work.  The f
olks are always one jump ahead of you.

I had to be out the end of last week.
 In order to try to hold to your deadline,
 
Pat Sanders drew up a response from Folk Arts, making a series of points with
 
which I completely concur.
 I would like t
o add some thoughts:
 
a
.  I am not opposed on principle to asking for additional data from
 
applicants.
 I am not, however, at all clear as to what we will do with the
 
information received nor how this ever-declining staff will find time to reflect
 
that data in its day-to-day operations or in its planning.
 Is it now a primary
 
function of this agency to amass information and circulate it?  We've always
 
tried to do that in Folk Arts but strictly in a
'spirit of individual helpfulness.
 
We never thought of it as a primary responsibility of the agency itself.  Maybe
 
we should.
 I
'm not arguing here, just discussing.
 
b
.  The questionaire was originally
 
the various fields on a voluntary basis.
 
It seems to me that this change requires
 
factor in every single question.
 
drawn up, as I understand it, to
 
It has now become universal and

know"
 
C.
 I believe that the usefulness and integrity of the information collected
 
will be seriously compromised if data from non-arts organizations is lumped in
 
with data from arts organizations.  Indeed, I really question the propriety of
 
.requiring economic information from non-arts-related organizations, such as Indian
 
tribes, educational institutions, etc.
 
d
.  Finally, it makes me rather sad to see the Endowment making the application
 
procedure ever more complex.  We used to be so proud of how we were the least
 
bureaucratic and at the same time the most effective agency in the federal govern-
ment; indeed when I first,suggested that it might save disappointment for people
 
applying to Folk Arts i
f they sent us an informal note saying what they wanted to
 
do before filling out the application form, it caused a perfectly tremendous
 
hoorah, the then head of the Grants Office telling me  that  the
 
NEA was the only federal agency with a one-step application procedure and how he
 
would fight to the death to keep me from complicating it.

Folk Arts, with its
 
then 30 grants a year max was obviously the nose of the camel.)  Oh well, sic
 
transit... We're growing up now.  But even though we do have to begin moving into

that grave new world when we will talk each to our own computer terminal and

f ever to a real live human artist, perhaps we could
 
retain some of that early-years brightness i

the new forms be a little more clearly and elegantly designed?  Design Arts
 
could help with that, I should t
hink.  The questionnaire language, couldn't
 
that be a little more interesting, pithy, even evocative?  We have a first-class
 
Literature Program full of good writers...

Informatics Proposals
 
The Literature Program has been an advocate for a revision of
 
the organizational application form,  particularly with an eye
 
toward correlating application and final report data.
 We are
 
in favor of the compilation of data which will help us assess
 
the applicants and draw conclusions about the field we serve.
 
And we understand the necessity of eliminating the multitude
 
cf u
tiappioved fci-1
1
1S.
 Nonetheless,  we have grave, reservations
 
about the material submitted for our review.
 
Literature is an individually based discipline.
 All but a few
 
of our organizations are small and are staffed primarily by
 
volunteers  (most of whom are artists).
 The filling out of the
 
complicated and ambiguous proposed forms will be an enormous
 
stumbling block for most of our applicants,  a roadblock for many.
 
Unless we conclude that only artists with bureaucratic mentalities
 
should have the privilege of our money,  the hefty burden of
 
walking applicants through these forms will fall on our already
 
overworked Program Specialists.
 
Our field is mobile.
 Organizations and individuals move frequently.
 
Staffs and structures change.
 Unless we continuously check and
 
revise data,  our data bank will be unreliable.
 Will this chore,
 
too,  fall on our staff?
 If so,  I don't know how we'll manage.
 
If not,  and this is said without malice toward those who would
 
attempt to check data without knowing the field,  I'm not convinced
 
the information will be reliable or useful.
 Forgive me for being
 
anecdotal,  but I'm reminded of the International Standard Book
 
Number service,  which,  I know you're aware,  is one of the most
 
sophisticated publication data resources in the whole literary world.
 
I.S.B.N. '
requests self-categorization,  and then has "information
 
specialists"  check and correct entries.
 When I published a book
 
of poetry entitled Alphabet for, the Lost Years, by a well-known writer,
 
the work was reclassified as an "elementa r y reader, " even though I
 
had chee
p"poetry/adult"  on the form.
 Salvation, a collection of
 
icofioclastic short stories,  came out as a "religious book."
 If
 
a large staffed,  high-budget commercial data service can't keep the
 
data  straight,  how can an under-staffed,  under-funded organization
 
manage?
 
I
 
MacArthur  to Horowitz
 
Memorandum 
11/5/82
 Pad

The Informatics plans call into question the purposes of the agency.
 
What is our top priority,  funding artistic excellence -- or gathering
 
and distributing information?
 How much in the way of useful arts
 
information can we collect through primarily numerical data?
 The
 
quality of the art we support always has been the healthy first
 
consideration for this program.
 Highly sophisticated financial
 
and other managerial information has been required only of those
 
organizations which could not function successfully without those
 
skills--e.g.,  distributors,  service organizations,  etc.
 Some of
 
our best bookkeepers run organizations we have no interest in
 
supporting -- because their ledgers are better than the titles
 
they publish or the writers they present.
 Interestingly enough,
 
we're heading toward numbers and classifiable data just at the time
 
the commercial world is beginning to have doubts about same.
 A
 
former president of R.R.  Bowker,  the parent of I.S.B.N.,  recently
 
stated in Publishers Weekly that,  "Compared
 
the nitty-gritty of
 
narrative substance
,J .
.. who needs it  Lnumbe
& ? Let's remember that
 
this kind of data gathering costs us more in pages and printing and
 
proofreading..."
 
If we must collect reams of data,  at least we might limit ourselves
 
to funded organizations -- rather than make all hopefuls jump through
 
the hoops of Intents to Apply,  Economic Survey Questionnaires,  and
 
Full Organizational Budget Information Supplements.
 If we don't
 
limit ourselves, we run the risk of losing applicants, many of whom
 
I fear will turn out to be those very grantees of whom we are most
 
proud,  those grantees of the highest artistic standards who would
 
rather create art than fodder for a data factory.
 
T
rid iviclual l
 y the forms are less unwieldy or intimidating than they
 
are collectively.
 Since our major problems are with the use of
 
the Intent to Apply,  the Economic Survey, and the Supplementary
 
Information forms, we will limit our specific comments to the
 
Application form.
 
1
)  We currently reproduce 3 pages of the application  (
all but the
 
signature pages)  for our panelists.
 We would have to reproduce 5
 
pages of the proposed application.
 Our panel book costs would rise
 
660!
 
2
)  The first page does not have a space for total project costs.
 
3
)  The first page does not include a  summary of estimated costs,
 
which our Program Specialists.€ihd an essential part of the
 
application.  (
They can tell at a glance if the applicant has completed
 
the budget incorrectly)
 
4
)  The first page is filled with question of minimal usefulness to
 
the panel  (
e.g.,  "Office Use Only,"  IRS determination letter,
 
Congressional District,  other intended applications,  state arts
 
agency notifications,  and total fiscal activity, which applicants
 
usually fill out incorrectly anywayl.
 
MacArthur to Horowitz
 
Memorandum  11/5/82
 Page 3
 
5
)  on page 3,  in our field the administrative, artistic, and technical ,
 
personnel are usually one in the_same.
 This blank will cause
 
confusion.
 
6
)  On page 4,  "Marketing " should;
-be "Promotion," which is the
 
recognizable terminology of our field.
 "Supplies and Materials,"
 
which has three blanks,  is usually one of the longest items for
 
our applicants.
 Our other long item,  "Other," has been reduced
 
from ten lines on the current application to four lines on the
 
proposed application.
 
7
)  On page 5, would book sales be listed under "Admissions" or
 
under "Other Revenues"?
 I don't understand what "Other Private
 
Contributions" means--and I help people fill out applications all
 
of the time.
 I don't understand what "Applicant Cash" means, at
 
least per instructions,  "or reasonably anticipated needs before
 
the project takes place."
 Cash-on-hand has never been considered
 
the same as expenses prior to the project start date  (which have not
 
been allowed).
 If federal grants should not be included in the
 
application, why is there a blank for same?
 
8
)  Finally,  the form is very poorly designed visually -- an important
 
factor in readability and comprehendibility.

To:  Frank Hodsoll
 
From:  Bess Hawes
 
Subject:  Application from Mississippi Department of Agriculture
 
This application came to Folk Arts rather than to Music.  The panel considered
 
it at our March meeting and recommended a rejection (
approved by Council at
 
May meeting) for the following reasons:
 
1
)  It i
s a first-time festival.  According to our guidelines, we
 
fund first-time festivals only under the most exceptional conditions, and
 
actually we have only done so once or twice that I can recall.
 
2
)  The budget showed a complete reliance on N%A for all necessary
 
cash, and no evidence of looking for other sources of funding.  Soft match
 
is of course allowable in Folk Arts grants, but in this case a totally soft
 
match with no additional cash seemed inappropriate.
 
3
)  There was no job description (
as prescribed by guidelines) for a pro-
fessional coordinator/director, indicating that the Agricultural people were
 
not taking the issues of artistic quality and program direction as seriously
 
as we require.
 
The Folk Arts Coordinator for Mississippi, Tom Rankin, had met with
 
these folks and tried to explain our requirements.  He concurs with staff
 
opinion that further planning and negotiation might produce a fundable
 
application later, perhaps next year.  But I honestly do not believe this
 
was a good proposition, and I should be perfectly willing to call Senator
 
Cochran's staffer, David Graves and discuss the situation with him, i
f you
 
would like me to.

to:  Ana Steele
 
From.  Bess Lomax IAwes
 
Subject: `
'Too Small" Grants
 
I shan't comment on the entry-level issue, since we've had no experience
 
with it.  Concerning the "too smalls" though:
 
1
)  I had thought the issue had come up originally within the context
 
of how much i
t costs to process a grant all the way through, but I don't
 
see that discussed here.  I
'm not at all sure that cost-effectiveness is the
 
most important aspect of the too small problem, but it might be a good idea
 
to include it anyway.
 
2
)  overall, though, I want to defend in whatever ringing terms I can
 
summon up on a Wednesday morning the '
'small grant" as a genre.  It seems to
 
me that the Endowment has grown and achieved its remarkably high reputation
 
through exactly such "small grants," distributing relatively inconspicuous
 
amounts of federal dollars via intelligent, humane and responsible bureaucratic
 
procedures that minimize the paper work and maximize the contact with artists
 
and their organizations.  I believe that we tinker with this system (
except
 
in the sense of shining up the doorknobs and testing for lead emissions) at
 
our peril.  We have taken so many steps during the past years to mollify the
 
large institutions; surely we don't want to tilt even further towards them
 
and away from the possibility of cultivating the lesser known and necessarily
 
small but experimental, pilot, or even openly daffy projects with genuine
 
potential for artistic engagement and excitement.

CONCLUSIONS  
The impact of this radio series on the public in Colorado has been sig-
nificant.
 Audience response to these programs has ranged from pleasant
 
-4-
to highly enthusiastic.  The programs are entertaining and enlightening,
 
while they also function to educate the public about the traditions which
 
can be found in various communities throughout Colorado.  The programs
 
have given the public a heightened awareness and respect for the tradi-
t
ions which can be found in their own homes and community gathering places.
 
The performers who were featured were given visibility in their home com-
munities and state - a visibility which has enhanced the respect which
 
they are shown for their talents.
 
The five-minute format of these programs allowed for their use on public
 
broadcasting and commercial stations which may not have been able to uti
 
t
lize similar programming of a half-hour or hour-long format.  We have
 
found the five-minute format to be a perfect length both for the listener
 
P and the broadcasting "host" stations.
 
V
,
 
The radio series Do Not Pass Me By:  A Celebration of Colorado Folklife
  
has proven to be a t
remendous success in t
erms of audience impact and the
 
visibility and respect to the performers which has been fostered by their
 
inclusion.  r
Clearly thousands of people have been reached as the result-
-
of this series and the tremendous amount of airplay which it has received.
 
The Folk Arts Program at the Colorado Council on the Arts and Humanities
 
gratefully acknowledges the generous funding support of the NEA/Folk Arts
 
Program for the design and implementation of this series.

Northeastern Colorado contains a large number of Germans whose descendents
 
settled for a period along the shores of the Volga River in Russia.  When
 
their rights were denied by the Russian Government,  many of these Germans
 
from Russia travelled across the western ocean,  and settled in Kansas,
 
Nebraska,
 and the sections of Colorado now known as Longmont,  Greeley,
 
Ft. Collins and Windsor.  Their genre of polka music,
 called "Dutch-Hop,"
 
features the hammered dulcimer and accordian.

Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife, June 26-30, July 3-7
 
You or I or both of us have been invited by the Festival people (
Peter Seitel,
 
specifically) to make a few remarks at the Festival opening, June 26 at
 
11:OOa.m. followed by a lunch as the guests of Secretary Adams.
 
To fill you in a bit, this is the same sort of event as the one you attended
 
on the Mall last year, only this year the government of India and the state
 
of Louisiana will be featured, and representatives of those entities will
 
speak along with other honored guests.  I am told the Ambassador of India
 
will be present along with major Indian cultural figures.
 
In addition to the cultural traditions of Louisiana and India, the Festival
 
is adding a special section this year titled Cultural Conservation where
 
they will present examples of artistic performances and cultural treasures
 
from across the nation that have been kept alive through the different means
 
that Folk Arts (
as well as other agencies and individuals) have been using:
 
exhibits, tours, heritage awards, apprenticeship programs, artists in schools
 
residencies.  I hope too that we'll learn of other strategies that we haven't
 
utilized here in Washington.  This program will include live performances,
 
small exhibits and educational displays, and workshop discussions in which
 
different local cultural leaders will explain how they managed to get Cajun
 
music included in the music curriculum in the public schools or how they got
 
the young folks interested in Alaskan Eskimo heritage camps.  They've asked
 
me to drop in a couple of t
imes during the Festival and talk informally about
 
the Folk Arts Program and what we've been able to help do.
 
Cultural conservation is what they hope you will address at the opening
 
ceremony, and you'll be pleased also to hear that they know it is the
 
Endowment's twentieth anniversary and that you might want to say a few
 
words on that topic too.  They'll be happy to send over a formal invitation
 
if you will be available.  If you don't want to attend, I can fill in for
 
you, or, if you prefer, they suggested we could split the bill, you talking
 
about the Endowment's overall purpose and me a few words about cultural
 
cons
ervation within Folk Arts.  They would be delighted
 an y wa y y
 
to handle it, as would I

NOTES FOR THE CHAIRMAN'S 20th ANNIVERSARY SPEECH  from Folk Arts Program
 
Most important developments in the past twenty years:
 
1
)  An eruption of interest across the nation in re-examining our grass
 
roots to determine their composition -- exposing the multiple local, ethnic,
 
regional and other identities which are so elegantly and trenchantly expressed
 
by the art forms indigenous to all these groups.  This flowering will provide
 
a well of accessible creative artistic statements where future generations of
 
artists can receive inspiration.
 
2
)  Support for the field of folk arts (which have always been there) has
 
flowered during the past 20 years.  Federally, the period has seen the
 
initiation of the Smithsonian's influential Festival of American Folklife
 
on the National Mall; the establishment by Congress of the American Folklife
 
Center at the Library of Congress; the initiation of the Endowment's Folk
 
Arts Program.  Nationally, there has been an outburst of creative activity
 
expressed through locally sponsored events of all kinds, some helped or stimu-
lated by federal funds and some not.
 
Most important contributions of the Folk Arts Program:
 
1
)  The development of a network of state and local organizations for the
 
support of the folk arts, bringing into active association with arts pro-
gramming rural communities as well as inner city ethnic neighborhoods.
 
2
)  The gradual inclusion of cultural and presentational expertise in folk
 
arts projects, making unfamiliar material more accessible, interesting and
 
exciting to home as well as outreach audiences.  This field as a whole has
 
never had steady, even-handed, professional attention and support before.

From:  Bess Hawes
 
Several months ago I received a call from the
 
State Department asking me for recommendations
 
for someone to represent the field of folk arts
 
at the Budapest Cultural Forum scheduled for the
 
week of October 21 and called by t
he Conference
 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (
the Helsinki
 
accords).
 
I made some recommendations and the fellow on
 
the phone mentioned that I had been recommended
 
as a possible delegate myself.  I forgot all
 
about it until yesterday when he phoned to say
 
I had been selected to be part of a large
 
delegation of Americans representing many
 
artistic fields and headed by Walter Stoessel
 
of the State Department.
 
I spoke briefly with Hugh about it and then told
 
them tentatively that I could be pleased to
 
attend.  My official invitation should come next
 
week after you've gone, so if you don't approve
 
perhaps you could give me a call before you go.

 Possible trip to the Pacific
 
I have been looking into the possibility of accompanying
; you on your upcoming
 
trip to the Pacific.  It appears to me t
hat i
f I spend 3 or 4 days in Oahu
 
and then preceed you to American Samoa, staying 3 or 4 days there, I could
 
accomplish useful Folk Arts business in both sites.
 (American Samoa is in
 
the process of working out a Folk Arts program complete with coordinator;
 
and we have many ongoing projects in P
Iawaii proper.)
 
Similarly, I would plan to stay three or four days after you leave Guam for
 
Japan, and accomplish some work with the Guam Apprenticeship Program and some
 
folk artists in schools projects in Saipan and Rota.
 
However, the costs of this trip are pretty astronomical.  I estimate $3500 at
 
a minimum, and, although I do believe I could make good use of the trip, the
 
Endowment just may not be able to afford i
t.  I know Folk Arts can't, which
 
brings me to enquire i
f there is a possibility that you would want to fund
 
this trip out of the Chairman's reserve.  I hope you will be able to make an
 
early decision on this matter, since reservations must be made far in advance
 
for Pacific travel.

 Application to film the history of the song "We Shall Overcome"
 
The attached application from the New York State Foundation on the Arts was
 
reviewed by the Folk Arts Panel on December 10, 1986 and recommended for
 
funding by a vote of 10 in favor, none opposed and 3 abstaining.  A summary
 
of the panel discussion is included based on my relistening to the debate on
 
tape; it is rather more full than our usual notes because I knew there would
 
be especial interest in this proposal.  The tape is of course available should
 
you want to hear i
t.
 
The reason for bringing this project to your attention did not arise out of
 
our meeting.  As you will see, the panel felt quite positively about the
 
project.  However, it had been originally presented for fundinp, to NEII where
 
it received favorable review through the level of Council but was rejected
 
by the Humanities Chair, reportedly for reasons of concern over political
 
content or impact.  I did not discuss the project with anyone from NEE.  It
 
seemed more proper for NEA to make its own independent review, at least on
 
the level of panel and staff.  I did inform the Folk Arts panel about t
he
 
history of the project, since the film director himself r
ientioned it in his
 
correspondence with me; however, the panel (
I believe properly) chose to
 
ignore t
he history and concentrated on the appropriateness or inappropriateness
 
of the project in terms of Folk Arts' guidelines.

Good Personnel.  Is video the best medium?  There is a heavy reliance on photos.
 
Did they consult the Apaches?  The Apaches are portrayed as the villians.  The
 
Indian view does not seem to be taken into consideration.  During this era the
 
Apaches were not nomadic.
 
The.superorganic approach concerning history combined with the contemporary is
 
mushy, with the living tradition left in the dust.
 
Folklore is presented like history.  Portrayal is more of fears people had at the
 
time concerning who they were than a depiction of history.
 
It is an interesting piece.  Reocmmended for rejection.

Bess Hawes left room during vote.
 
This could be a block buster project that will give genuine folk artists (
Johns
 
Island Morning Star Hall Singers et al) lots of air-time and audience exposure.
 
The fact that this song has totally traditional roots will be news to many people.
 
It is an exciting and provocative topic and could raise the consciousness of a lot
 
of people concerning the folk roots of the song.
 
Film has two good purposes: 1
) it establishes that folk traditions occur in the
 
midst of social and cultural events and often reflect the particular circumstances
 
of the period and; 2
) it makes very visible the effect that moving a song or
 
cultural item from one cultural context to another has on the artistic item itself.
 
This might clarify for many people the importance of the distinctions we make in
 
defining folk arts.
 
Might our support of this film not confuse the issue further (
folk song singers
 
such as Odetta and Pete Seeger in the same film as the Johns Island folks)?
 
But we are looking at this project as people who know and remember the sixties.
 
If this film shows people who don't know the sixties the way in which context
 
influences performance and the way performance style in a particular context
 
changes the whole communication, the film will have been truly educational.
 
We have reason to believe in the excellence of the film makers and their commitment
 
to the project.  Good lists of advisors - the appropriate people who would know
 
about the song's history will be interviewed on the film and we can trust them
 
to make appropriate comments.

Subject:
 Artists' Rights
 
Folk Arts, I
'm sorry to say, has more artists' rights problems t
han you can
 
shake a writ at.  I
'm not at all sure that anything can be done about them
 
other than complain.  I will mention the important issues briefly; should
 
you want expanded information, I can get it for you.
 
1
)  Authenticity.  Problems arise here on several levels.  The first is
 
the importation of massive amounts of imitation American folk arts (
"Mennonite"
 
quilts, "Tennessee" egg baskets, made by sweatshop labor in Haiti, "Hawaiian" shell
 
jewelry from the Philippines, southwestern style "Indian" pottery from Korea).
 
Some of this i
s ascribed to the country of origin, some is not; all of i
t is
 
fundamentally faked and all of i
t serves to drive the prices down for American
 
traditional crafts people.  The second area of concern is t
he buying up of
 
large a
mounts of locally made basketry, pottery etc. by middlemen who then
 
identify the objects anyway they think will increase the sales.  Finally, there
 
are cases where craftsworkers are hired to produce predetermined "salable" items
 
for hourly wages.  This usually results in economic and artistic exploitation,
 
and the results are always marketed as "genuine" Appalachian or %hatnot.  I suppose
 
they are, but they reflect only the factory manager's aesthetic.
 
2
)  Copyright.  American folk songs in the public domain are often copyrighted
 
as "arranged by:`  Sometimes this is done by collectors who return any proceeds
 
to the singers; sometimes not.  Radio and Television broadcasters would rather
 
pay ASCAP or BMI rights for an "arranged" version than risk a later suit.  This
 
situation hobbled along reasonably well until the new copyright law came into
 
effect which established that all public performances of son s/music required
 
copyright payment to the copyright holder, including performances of "For He's
 
a Jolly Good Fellow  at lodge meetings and hymns in church.  We had one case two
 
years ago of a small local festival being badgered by a regional ASCAP representa-
tive requiring
; them to list for him all the tunes/songs to be played and giving
 
him ;50.00 or so to "clear" t
hem.  I suggested they let him sue, but I think they
 
may have settled quietly.  I understand from some copyright lawyers at the Library
 
of Congress that the situation i
s still messy, though we've had no more active
 
complaints.
 
3
)  Exploitation.  This is legally tricky, I suppose, but Folk Arts deals
 
with artists who often have not had the education and experience necessary to
 
enable them to use good judgment in selling their work.  I t
hink of Black blues
 
musicians who signed away their recording rights for a flat fee and i
lliterate
 
2
 
painters who have sold every one of their pieces to collectors who thereby
 
corner the market for a genuine '
'
 " and then hold them until the
 
artist dies or some other event drives the market up.  These things happen
 
relatively frequently in the folk arts world and are responsible for the
 
fact that we speak so passionately of t
he need to educate our artists concerning
 
the history, provenience and economic value of their art form.

Subject:
 Special request from American Dance Festival
 
The Folk Arts Program is certainly supportive of the idea of bringing
 
authentic Hawaiian dance troupes of the first order of excellence to the
 
American Dance Festival.  Though I have not personally seen all the dancers
 
to be involved, Kaui Zuttermeister, her daughter NoeNoe and her grand-daughter
 
Haole performed with distinction at the Smithsonian Festival of American
 
Folklife in the summer of 1984 during which year Mrs. Zuttermeister also
 
received a National Folk Heritage Fellowship.  One of the other troupes
 
named performed at the Statue of Liberty celebration last year to great
 
applause.
 
I have not polled the Folk Arts panel on this issue, since there has been a
 
long-standing policy in Folk Arts that funding importing artists from great
 
distances to perform for large general audiences is of secondary interest to
 
us (
primarily for simple economic reasons).  However, I have spoken with
 
panel chairman John Vlach, who is Hawaiian by birth and keeps up with the
 
culture; t
ie agrees that the artists concerned are of highest reputation and
 
that their presentation at the American Dance Festival would be entirely
 
desirable, if funds could be made available.  Folk Arts therefore heartily
 
recommends to the Chairman that this would be a most appropriate use of the
 
Chairman's Fund.

Here are a few Arts Review contributions for your consideration.  During the
 
Chairman's and my recent foray into the Pacific, I went to American Samoa
 
ahead of him and took advantage of the time to take a look at their A-I-E
 
program.  One of their artists, a young
, woman poet, invited me to a couple
 
of her classes, which I enjoyed greatly and where I copied down a couple of
 
the original poems the child authors showed me.  I read the Chairman the
 
one titled Space and he thought it good enough to recommend to you.  I
'm
 
including the other -- quite different -- for your interest; please do
 
whatever fits your editorial needs.  I think they are both remarkable
 
considering; their authors are not only youthful but bi-lingual, and writing,
 
here, in their second language.
 
The piece titled "How You Came By What You
. Got" was written for the 19,37 Elko Nevada
 
Cowboy Poetry Gathering program book.  Its author, Kim Stafford, i
s a poet and the
 
son of a poet -- William Stafford, once a Library of Congress Poet-in-Residence.
 
Kim now teaches creative writing at Lewis and Clark College in Portland Oregon.
 
I thought the piece so moving that I showed i
t to Hugh Southern who agreed
 
completely and suggested I send it to you for possible reprint along with his
 
heartiest endorsement.  I have not spoken to Mr. Stafford, of course, but I can

What Someone Said When He Was Spanked on the Day Before His Birthday
  
Some day
 
I may
 
Pack my bag and run away.
 
Some day
 
I may
 
But not today.
 
Some night
 
I might
 
Slip away in the moonlight
 
I might
 
Some night
 
But not tonight.
 
Some night
 
Some day
 
I might — 
I may — 
But right now I
'll stay.

SPACE
 
Space is an endless black sky
 
No starting; no ending;
 
Continuously black, and leading nowhere
 
With unexplored places and distant planets.
 
Space is the endless galaxy
 
That is yet to be explored
 
Without a goal of destination
 
Just sitting -- is SPACE

 Proposed trip to Canada
 
I have been invited by the Executive Director of the Ontario Council on the
 
Arts to visit Ottawa on August 11th for a day's conference with both staff
 
and Council members of the Ontario Arts Council.  This visit i
s a follow-up
 
to Hugh Southern's trip of a few months ago when he found that how to
 
develop a folk arts program was one of the major topics on which he was
 
questioned during his recent visit to Ottawa.  I have since then spoken
 
lengthily with several members of the Ontario Arts Council staff and we
 
have tentatively agreed that a quick trip and a day of consultation would
 
be a way in which I could be of greatest assistance.
 
They have kindly offered an honorarium as well as to pick up my expenses
 
(
round trip flight and one night in a hotel).  I said that I didn't feel
.
 
that an honorarium would be appropriate but that I would check on whether or
 
not I might accept reimbursement for my travel and hotel costs.  Could you
 
advise me on the appropriateness of this?  I was told ten days ago I would
 
receive a formal written invitation, but I understand the postal service of
 
Canada i
s on strike, so I thought I should enquire temporarily without the
 
documentary backup.

 Preservation needs in Folk Arts
 
1
)  Many tribal and ethnic musical performances were initially recorded on
 
cylinders, (
a Thomas Edison invention) during the period from about 1
.880
 
to 1920 when recordings on discs took over.  The Library of Congress is
 
creeping on steadily with the project of copying on to tape the cylinders
 
in federal holdings; they may be through in another year.  There are, however,
 
many cylinders t
hat turn up in other libraries and archives; the University of
 
Indiana has a large collection to cite only one example.  Copying cylinders
 
requires special equipment, musicological supervision (
to net the speed and
 
tonal factors as correct as possible, since the old collectors used to just
 
wind the machine up tight and let '
er rip) and nerves of steel on the part
 
of the copyists since the music may or may not sound very enticing after all
 
those years.  It is a process that demands, in other words, special funding
 
and special staff.  There are only a few places in the country that can do i
t;
 
the Library of Congress is one.  To American Indian tribes these recordings
 
are an invaluable historical resource.
 
2
)  The Library of Congress has also a large collection of acetate and aluminum
 
disc recordings, mostly of American folk music, much of it performed magnifi-
cently and of great historical and musical interest.  (Aluminum disc recordings
 
were used mostly during the 1930'x, the acetate came into vogue in the 1940's.
 
The aluminum recordings are 16" in diameter and require a special cactus needle
 
for playing; they cannot therefore be listened to very easily but they are
 
holding up well against the ravages of time.  Acetate discs are also 16" but
 
are drying out rapidly, I am told; they really should be copied as fast as it
 
can be managed.  The Library of Congress again has t
he major holdings, but
 
private collectors, university libraries and archives and other such institutions
 
have extensive collections.
 
3
)  We have several times been approached by people who had old video tapes of
 
folk performances and wanted to transfer them to film because the pictures
 
were beginning to dissolve.  Video is so comparatively recent that no one
 
quite knows (
I think) yet exactly how long a shelf life i
t has.  I do not know
 
how big
; a problem this will turn out to be.
 
4
)  We are also occasionally approached by groups that wish to preserve this or
 
that folk outdoor structure (
e.p. Grandma Prisbee's bottle garden or Watts Towers
 
or the like).  This i
s a potentially enormous problem, fiscally speaking, that
 
would seem best handled locally though local groups typically do not have the
 
necessary monetary resources.  I have written the Chairman several memos on this
 
'
T,
 
problem; it seems unlikely t
o go away but also unlikely that the Endowment
 
can help much.  An organization called SPACES based in Los Angeles is
 
attempting t
o act as a national
. clearing-house for information on this issue
 
and could probably estimate how many such structures t
here are and in what
 
kind of condition.

 NASAA Meeting
 
This fall the NASAA annual meeting in Nashville happens to co-occur exactly
 
with the annual meeting in Albuquerque of the American Folklore Society, an
 
event where Dan Sheehy, Barry Bergey and I are all supposed to speak and
 
where we always handle great slabs of Folk Arts business anyway.
 
Under the circumstances, I thought I might try to route myself through Nashville
 
for one or two days to catch up with NASAA affairs and to participate in the
 
folk arts panel discussion that Tennessee Folk Arts Coordinator Roby Cogswell
 
is bringing together there, and then go on to Albuquerque.
 (
Or else the other
 
way round, starting in Albuquerque and returning through Nashville)  This may
 
not prove to be practical.  If it is not, I think I might regretfully scrub
 
the Folklore Society meeting and simply attend NASAA since it would give me an
 
opportunity to check with some of the Pacific groups that we've been working
 
with recently as well as some of the western SAA's.  I would be the only Folk
 
Arts staffer I would suggest attend, nor do I know of any SAA personnel we
 
would assist in attending.

.  I have inspected Folk Arts grants for FY 86 and R7 and can discover no
 
presence of foreign artists except in a grant currently being recommended
 
to August Council: to provide $3,400 to the Institute for Italian-American
 
Studies for partial funding of a "Pan-Irpinian Touring Festival of Music,
 
Dance and
. Video."  (
In case you are unclear as to where Irpinia is -- I
 
didn't know myself -- i
t i
s a sub-region of Campania in southern Italv.)
 
In this project, local Irpinian-Americans will be joined by a contingent of
 
10 traditional performing artists from Irpinia Italy whose trip over and all
 
expenses including lost work-time are being taken care of by the Italian
 
government.  No American federal dollars will go to the Italian artists (
as
 
opposed to Italian-Americans).
 
2
.  Folk Arts has only one category that addresses individual artists: t
he
 
National Heritage Fellowships which are so patently directed towards long-
term residents at the very least that it has never occurred to us to specify
 
citizenship.  Our organizational guidelines contain no language addressing
 
the point either; I believe this comes from the way in which we define our
 
field:  "The folk and traditional arts have grown throu h time within the
  
many _
groups that make up any nation -- groups that share the same ethnic
  
heritage, language, occupation, religion or geographic area. The homegrown
  
traditional artistic activities of such groups are often called folk arts....
 
And over and over again throughout the guidelines we state that preference
 
will be given to local artists and art forms.
 
In this context it is rare that an applicant even suggests to us that a
 
foreign artist might be helpful or useful.  I can in fact remeriber only four
 
such grants in the past eight years, all
. of them springing from the temporary
 
and serendipitous presence in the country of a touring artist whose services
 
were then requested by local communities to conduct master classes or the like:
 
a Basque xixtu player, some revered Japanese classical dancers/musicians, a
 
Scots bagpipe master, and another group of Italian artists, (
that bunch, I
 
believe from Sicily.).
 
I personally would hope that the issue need not be featured or focussed on in
 
our guidelines.  The way we have the guidelines now allows us to negotiate
 
flexibly in many different circumstances with the steady and serious intention
 
of coming up with the best possible solutions we can devise for strengthening
 
and heartening local folk arts and local folk artists.

 Draft Congressional Report on panels
 
I have a very few editorial suggestions:
 
1
)  page 14.  It seems to me that the part of the sentence I struck out
 
does not fit with the overall topic of the paragraph, (
besides,it's incorrect)!
 
The paragraph speaks to grant categories; the sentence about Folk Arts uses
 
as examples, however, eligible applying groups.  I
'd suggest substituting
;:
 
.
..reviews applications from a wide range of non-profit organizations for
 
projects designed to present and document the traditional and folk arts, and
 
from state art and cultural agencies for the development of locally supported
 
folk arts programs including apprenticeships.
 
If that's too long and cumbersome, it could be edited in either of the following
 
ways:
 
.
..reviews applications from a wide range of non-profit organizations as
 
well as from state and local arts and cultural agencies
 or
 
.
..reviews applications for projects designed to present and document the
 
traditional and folk arts and to develop locally supported folk arts programs
 
including apprenticeships.
 
I promise all this makes better sense when you look at the context of the sentence!
 
2
)  I agree with Mary MacArthur that "burden" should be changed to "
task" and
 
"recommendations" take the place of "
qualitative judgments"; "review system" might
 
well substitute for "
jury system" and I like her "calls on experts from the
 
respective disciplines who are private citizens serving temporarily (
my single
 
addition) in a public capacity."
 
3
)  In the introduction, we've pencilled in a few suggestions.
 
Overall, I think this is a clear document that gives a good account of a very
 
complex process.

 Need for Travel
 
Folk Arts is in a slight pickle.  I seriously need to go to Jacobs Pillow
 
July 24-26 to accomplish two missions:  inspecting
, the results of our pilot
 
African-dancers-in-residence grant and to participate in a workshop conference
 
of major presenters called by Liz Thompson.  I am to speak there as part of
 
panel, my topic being needs and considerations in presenting folk arts.
 
P
low it turns out that our travel moneys are either exhausted or close to.  I
 
had originally planned to go from Jacobs Pillow to Lowell P
iassachusetts to
 
visit the National Folk Festival that same weekend, but can if necessary
 
forego that section of the trip.  The Jacobs Pillow section would cost
 
approximately $530; the addition of the j
'altham visit would bri m the cost up
 
to $800.  I do think the quoted estimates are a bit inflated in our usual
 
cautious budgetary style; I also believe it will turn out that some previous
 
trips won't prove to have cost as much as we had estimated.  Still we will
 
clearly need some help.  Is there any to be had?

Dear Dean Cusimano,
 
I write to congratulate you upon the profoundly innovative action you have
 
taken in appointing Dewey Balfa as Adjunct Professor of Cajun Music and
 
Canray Fontenot as Adjunct Professor of Creole Music at the University of
 
Southwestern Louisiana.
 
The statement of Mission of the National Endowment for the Arts contains the
 
following sentences:
 
This nation's governance is based on our people's commitment to
 
freedom of imagination, thought, and expression.
 Our many
 
aesthetic and cultural traditions are precious to us -- for the
 
rich variety of their beauty and as a symbol of the diverse nature
 
of the United States.
 
It is in this spirit that the Endowment's Folk Arts Program some years ago
 
established the National Heritage awards and proudly recognized both Mr. Balfa
 
and Mr. Fontenot as "Master Traditional Artists who have contributed to the
 
shaping of our artistic traditions and to preserving the cultural diversity of
 
the United States."  I myself had the privilege of personally handing these
 
two fine artists their Fellowship certificates.
 
But this all happened in Washington, along with their appearances at the
 
- 2 -
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife and at the Library of Congress.  It
 
is of infinitely greater significance that they are now being honored and
 
recognized in their own home state, by their own peers, amongst their own
 
people.  Washington administrative agencies can admire and support, but true
 
creative action remains, as i
t always has, in the hands of the artists
 
themselves,nourishing and being nourished by the cultural traditions from which
 
they have come.
 
Your enlightened administration has created a place for these two remarkable
 
artists where they can pass along to the next generation their long accumulated
 
artistic wisdom and integrity.  May other institutions of higher learning
 
follow your example.
 
Yours very truly,

Herewith the correspondence between me and r
ts. Marianne k
'oods.  Frankly, I
 
believe her selection as a panelist for Folk Arts is not very likely since
 
she seems to have a pretty limited background in our terms.  Folk Arts is
 
just as apt to have an application from Palau as from the Ozarks, as
 
frequently concerned with Asian-American operatic styles as with quilts.
 
And Ozark quilts seem to be her thing.  On the other hand she has also had
 
mperience with a small local museum and as such might be of interest to
 
the Museum Program.
 I enclose her vita in case you want to recommend her
 
on to them.
 
I hope I
'm being clear.  She certainly is not out of the running for Folk
 
Arts; during the next year I
'll
. probably quietly try to find somebody who
 
knows her and can attest to her capacities as a panelist.  But I don't
 
think she's s shoo-in and I tried to distract her politely in my letter as
 
you'll see.

MEMORANDUM
 
DATE:
 March 18, 1988
 
TO:
 Jeanne B
. Hodges, Challenge/Advancement
 
FROM:
 Bess Lomax Hawes, Folk Arts Program
 
SUBJECT:
 
Challenge III Guidelines and Process Revisions
 
*00 
.
..
 
Folk Arts received no requests for the Challenge III program from our scanty
 
supply of institutions.  Had we done so, we would have advised most,if not all,
 
not to apply, because so few of them are stable enough to be ready to expand their
 
energies from program development to raising the Challenge III type of match.
 
Folk Arts institutions -- all twenty-odd of them -- are likely to confine themselves
 
to the Advancement program for the foreseeable future.  We therefore repeat our
 
standard request for more flexibility in Advancement eligibility schedules.  We
 
recoiruuend in the strongest terms that Folk Arts,  together with possibly other of
 
the under-institutionalized fields such as Literature  perhaps, be permitted access
 
to Advancement every year. 
I very much doubt that any year would see more than
 
three or four Folk Arts institutions applying and only one or two receiving panel
 
approval.
 Surely this would not over-tax either the Advancement staff or its funds.
 
Any remarks I might make concerning the Challenge III review process will  therefore
 
be largely theoretical.  My general experience with a functional approach,however,
 
has been reasonably extensive and largely unfavorable.
 In my early days at the
 
Endowment I worked to establish some possible joint projects with NEH (which is
 
organized by function), and that experience tended to sour me on the whole idea.
 
To give a quick example, a community once approached Folk Arts with an idea to
 
establish an archive of circus and medicine show memorabilia that had belonged to
 
a leading citizen.
 I referred them to the Archive program at NEH and observed
 
the process with interest.
 A number of appropriate experts in circus and medicine
 
show lore, American regional history etc. were sent copies of the proposal for
 
review -- generally favorable.
 The proposal then went to a "super-panel" of
 
archival experts none of whom had any interest in or experience with the particular
 
topic, and it got shot down on the basis of archival inexperience on the part of
 
the applicants.
 The thing that interested me about the process was not that the
 
proposal failed -- it was probably a pretty impractical project anyway -- but that
 
at no point along the way did any group of appropriate experts address the issue
 
of whether or not such an archive was needed (
there could have been many others
 
already in existence) or was it a good idea anyway.
 This kind of super-ordinate
 
perspective is what a good discipline panel brings to the evaluation of every
 
project -- not only a weighing of the merits of the proposal per se, but how it
 
fits in to the over-arching needs and potentials of the particular field of activity
 
at the particular time.
 
- 2 -
 
I am aware that this is not a popular view at the moment, but I must add that
 
later experience with state arts agencies that have changed their structure from
 
discipline-based to functional has further convinced me of the correctness of my
 
observations.  The functional idea is appealing intellectually, but I have not
 
seen it produce intellectually exciting results; more frequently i
t results in
 
a kind of smoothing-over effect, reducing all activities and conversations to a
 
reliable level of mediocrity.  The essential problem is, i
t seems to me, that any
 
functionally focussed panel is bound to be talking most of the time about
 
particular proposals that none of the individual panelists know anything specifically
 
about; they then resort to generalizations and come up with a kind of consensus
 
style of decision making that may make for smooth administration but has little
 
positive effect upon the arts themselves.

Paperwork!
 
For starters,  here are some of my thoughts on your request for a
 
list of suggestions on current paperwork that is unnecessary,
 
time consuming,  and basically unhelpful.
 I have put this
 
together rather hurriedly before going on travel status and will
 
surely have more to add later.

 Five Year Plan
 
The document may well be useful as an information piece
 
and possibly should be continued as such.
 However,  it is
 
relatively useless as a guidepost for actual planning for two
 
reasons:
 
a.
 It is too complicated and tricksy.
 It
 
encourages the writer and reader to spend too much time on the
 
finicky detail and figuring out what observation or concept more
 
correctly goes where than on the general thrust of the plan.
 
b.
 It come around too often.
 In the world of
 
arts funding,  it takes a long time for a change on the federal
 
level to be distributed,  explained,  and acted upon.
 Wasn't
 
there a time in history when a five year plan got revised every
 
five years?
 That seems to me much more reasonable,  and it might
 
even result  in a real plan rather than a support document.
 
2.
 Time Extensions.
 
I find myself awed by the bureaucratic buildup of what
 
was once a friendly interchange between program director and
 
grantee.
 I always used the request as an occasion for an
 
informal  review of the project and what problems had arisen;  it
 
was a truly educational moment for both parties.
 The Program's
 
recommendation now has to be reinforced by pages of formal
 
memoranda production;  the reviewing bodies up the line often
 
require additional  information as to the fiscal and programmatic
 
status of the applying organization;  paper gets passed back and
 
forth; we telephone the applicant over and over to enquire ever
 
more closely into the situation.
 What was once handled in a day
 
now takes weeks and weeks sometimes,  as supporting memoranda
 
pile up on desks and get  lost  in the paper shuffle.
 And to what
 
end?
 I am mystified as to why we care if a project gets done in
 
three months or six months?
 All  right,  suppose it takes several
 
N
 
- 2
 
years?
 I wonder if Michaelangelo correctly estimated the number
 
of years it would take him to paint the Sistine Chapel?
 If he
 
didn't, do you suppose the Pope called him on the phone every
 
three or four days to enquire what was holding him up?
 
3
.
 Over-elaboration of panel substitution process.
 
I have never in the past nine years been able to bring
 
in the named individual approved of as the official substitute
 
for an ongoing panelist.
 Substitutions typically occur at the
 
last minute due to illness or sudden catastrophe;  the program
 
director then gets on the phone and gets whoever on the
 
substitution list is available to come to Washington at a
 
moment's notice for several days out of a busy life.
 That being
 
the case, what is the point of figuring out that complicated
 
substitution form?  Why should we not simply provide a list of
 
recommended substitutes complete with short vitas from which we
 
select according to availablility?
 This would save at least one
 
humongous piece of paper and the several irritating hours of
 
time it takes to fill it out and the length of time it takes our
 
hard-working secretary to type it and for Council and Panel to
 
check it and see that it is correctly filled out and the
 
arithmetic is right and the length of time it takes for the
 
Fifth Floor to approve.
 
The procedures for getting the substitution approved
 
are too cumbersome,  take too long and are ill constructed for
 
emergency actions, which most substitutions are.
 This is a
 
situation where some delegation of authority is badly needed
 
rather than the construction of another form.
 
4.
 Overly complex and statistically meaningless requirements
 
for budget planning and other fiscal events.
 
If needed,  statistics concerning relationships between
 
overall budget size and grant amounts should be compiled outside
 
the programs.
 The pulling together of such data is extremely
 
time-consuming when it has to be done by hand,  as it still often
 
does.
 Computerization is still not fool-proof in our operation,
 
and we nearly always have to wait in line to put even
 
straightforward documents on the computer.
 Getting them out
 
again is another moment of anxiety.

SUBJECT:
 Puerto Rican F
lask
 
Dan Sheehy, who has almost infallible diplomatic good manners, suggests that
 
you might wish to make a donation to the fund that Walter Murray Chiesa has
 
set up within Fomento. the government of Puerto Rico's Economic Development
 
Administration, to buy tools for Puerto Rican crafts workers.  If you'd like
 
to do this, the check should be made out to Walter Murray Chiesa with "for
 
the folk artesans
`g tool bank" on the notation line and addressed to him with
 
a covering note to the following address:

MEMORANDUM
 
TO:
 Kate
 
FROM:
 Bess
 
DATE:
 January  10,  1985
 
Here are some of the  printed  responses we have on  file for the
 
Pilot State Apprenticeship  Program;  all of us  have heard much more,
 
of course,  over the phone.
 Bear  in mind  that  the states were en-
couraged  to set  the programs up as  they wanted  to:
 therefore,  you
 
have  Pennsylvania asking for applications  from master/apprentice
 
combinations competing for a limited number of grants,  and
 
Arkansas  pre-selecting by  panel a roster of master artists  and  then
 
asking for applications  from potential apprentices.
 Idaho  is  just
 
getting started,  but  I thought  the Indian  tribal  support was sig-
nificantly enthusiastic.
 
Finally,  I have  included  an exerpt  from a 21 page interim report
 
by one of the  three evaluators we have out  in  the  field now.
 
You'd be welcome  to see  the whole document,  it  is exceptionally
 
meaty.

Texas Press, 1955) bas been very well received and has been nominated
 
for several prizes.  As far as I can tell, there is no representative
 
of Cajun culture on the Commission, and I am sure Louisianans would be
 
glad to hear of Barry's receiving the honor.

RE:  Request for information from the reauthorization committee
 
concerning museum funding
 
t�
 
We have been asked to supply information on Endowment funding to museums.
 
The question, quoted from the record, was this:
 
"Would you provide... some estimate as to the amount of funding that you provide
 
that in some way makes its way to museums, through traveling exhibits or
 
other types of things that assist museums in bringing art to the communities?"
 
Can you please give us information on grants your program has awarded, in FY '
83
 
and '
84, that have directly or indirectly benefitted museums?  We don't
 
need a list of grants, just provide the number of grants, an overview of the
 
purpose of the grants, and the total dollar amount for each of the two
 
years.
 
Please have this information to me by noon on Monday, May 27.
 
Thank you.

Subject:
 Proposal for funding for a series of Ouincentennial
 
celebrative recordings of Latin American musical treasures
 
Robert Stevenson the prolific scholar of Latin American music at UCLA,
 
mentioned this project to me during a recent visit to Los Angeles, and
 
I was so struck by it and by the quality of the earlier recording co-
produced with the Roger Wagner chorale, that I offered to look into funding
 
possibilities here in Washington.  The works are either previously un-
recorded or poorly recorded, and, I think, could turn out to be a nice
 
contribution to all the revisiting of the Western Hemisphere's past that
 
will be happening on the occasion of the Quincentennial of
. Columbus tand
 
his successors' arrival to the New World.
 
I realize it does not fit squarely into your guidelines and that the price
 
tag is quite high, but do you see any opportunity for funding either through
 
the Music Program or any other funding source?  I am certain they would
 
appreciate any help they can get.  If you like, I could pass whatever
 
suggestions you mfght have on to them.  My extension is 5449.

Subject.
 The attached proposal for a series of recordings of unavailable
 
Latin American musical treasures.
 
When Robert Stevenson, perhaps the most prolific scholar on Latin American
 
classical music, mentioned this project to me during a recent lunch get-
together, I was so struck by the plan and by the high quality of the previous
 
recording done in collaboration with the Roger Wagner Chorale, that I offered
 
to look into funding possibilities here in Washington.  It seems to me to be
 
an excellent candidate for a quincentennial arts project, and could generate
 
an awful lot of appreciation in Latin America.
 
I have sent a copy of the proposal to Ed Birdwell.  Would you have any
 
suggestions or words of encouragement for them?  I know they would be most
 
thankful for any assistance we could give them  the total price tag for the
 
project is quite high, and they will need all the resources they can get.
 
Thanks.

Subject:
 Panel Reductions
 
Concerning the suggestion that the Folk Arts Panel be reduced to 11, I
 
want to get on record that our number has been 13 for some years, and
 
that we had already agreed to reduce to 12.
 Though it is true that there
 
is no way to determine scientifically how many individuals are required
 
on a given panel to make sound and representative decisions, I can predict
 
the steps that I will have to recommend if we are limited to 11.  Though
 
I do not think any of these steps individually reflect "bad" decisions,
 
taken all together, they appear to me to suggest a distinct narrowing and
 
constricting of panel make-up and ultimately of the information available
 
to the Council and to you.
 
1
)
 I will recommend the elimination of a State Arts Agency repre-
sentative on the Panel.  Folk Arts works closely with the states at all
 
times and besides always has a State Folk Arts Coordinator as consultant
 
at panel meetings.
 In our far-ranging field, with only 11, we will require
 
panelists to have distinct field expertise rather than general arts back-
ground.
 
2
)
 I will ask Harry Oster to step down.  He is a distinguished old-
timer and I recommended him in order that he might provide historical
 
perspective, but there is no doubt that he is now out of the mainstream and
 
cannot comment as pertinently on comtemporary performers as would be most
 
helpful.
 
3)
 I will request that Bill Ivey be kept on as panel chairman for
 
one final year.
 I might do this anyway, but if we are down to 11, I will
 
certainly request his retention with some urgency, since we will surely
 
need his experience and expertise.
 
I
'm afraid I see this as another small step away from the Endowment's
 
distinguished record of entrusting artistic judgments to broadly selected
 
peer groups.
 I have one additional money saving alternative to offer
 
that did not occur to me during our interview.
 Folk Arts could save at
 
least one panel day per year if we were to handle our policy and five year
 
plan discussions by mail with perhaps a one or two hour session once a year
 
for the required (I believe) public participation in policy decisions.  Few
 
public attend our meetings anyway, so I do not think that would be a great
 
loss, and in my view the most important policy recommendations are made during
 
grant review discussions anyway.
 
- 2 -
-
I don't know if saving one panel day per year is equivalent in dollars
 
to eliminating one panelist for three meetings, but it's what Folk Arts
 
would recommend.

As I mentioned by telephone,  I was contacted by Spider Kedelsky
 
at to e University of Massachussetts at Amherst concerning a
 
conference he had discussed with Less and me a cocple of months
 
ago.
 !he conference will concern the  presentation of
 
non-Nestern art forms .
tor nroa i American audiences and w 0l
 
center around many of the attendant problems -- effective
 
staging,  interpret Lion for cross-cultural appreciation, special

Both Dese and I were intriguea by their plans and felt Lhat it
 
wou.la be wortawnile attending,  if the dates,  arrangements, and
 
budget can oe worker out.
 Estimated cost or one person (either
 
Bess or myself)  to attend the two-;lay conference is $43a,  though
 
jo not think it would actually end of  costing that much.

.  "extend its traditional four year limitation."  The Folk Arts Program
 
states in other guideline categories that four years is normally the limit for
 
our funding of the same activity.  The panel voted to extend this rule to t
he
 
Pilot State Apprenticeship category which formerly had no such limitation.

.  "Naive and visionary" artists is standard terminology in the field.
 
I am not sure that examples would clarify the issue, s
ince t
b is refers to genres
 
and most of these artists are not exactly household names.  I would be happy to
 
take the sentence out or leave it in and answer any questions that might arise
 
at the table during the discussion of our grants.
 (
I would prefer to leave it
 
in and field any questions.)
 
For your own information, the following characteristics of these art forms may
 
be helpful:
 
;
chive  - self taught, often *childlike; '
primitiv e (Grandma ?
ioses is the  best
 
known example of this type of artist)
 
Visionary - surrealistic, religious.  Many are environmental artists with a
 
need to build and occupy space.  Articles used are usually ceramic, glass,
 
bottles, cement, found objects of any kind.
 
I
liese have been viewed in the past as being outside our guidelines.  We
 
describe folk arts as that which is generally shaped by a community
 
aesthetic rather than the sort of intensely personal vision one finds with
 
the work of naives and visionaries.  Our own definition, in short, appeals
 
to a sensibility shared by a community and handed down over time by imitation
 
and oral transmission.

Challenge III Guidelines and Process Revisions
 
woo
 
Folk Arts received no requests for the Challenge III program from our scanty
 
supply of institutions.
 Had we done so, we would have advised most, if not all,
 
not to apply, because so few of them are stable enough to be ready to expand their
 
energies from program development to raising the Challenge III type of match.
 
Folk Arts institutions -- all twenty-odd of them -- are likely to confine themselves
 
to the Advancement program for the foreseeable future.
 We therefore repeat our
 
standard request for more flexibility in Advancement eligibility schedules.
 We
 
recommend in the strongest terms that Folk Arts,  together with possibly other of
 
the under-institutionalized fields such as Literature  perhaps, be permitted access
 
to Advancement every year. 
I very much doubt that any year would see more than
 
three or four Folk Arts institutions applying and only one or two receiving panel
 
approval.
 Surely this would not over-tax either the Advancement staff or its funds.
 
Any remarks I might make concerning the Challenge III review process will  therefore
 
be largely theoretical.
 My general experience with a functional approach,however,
 
has been reasonably extensive and largely unfavorable.
 In my early days at the
 
Endowment I worked to establish some possible joint projects with NEH (which is
 
organized by function), and that experience tended to sour me on the whole idea.
 
To give a quick example, a community once approached Folk Arts with an idea to
 
establish an archive of circus and medicine show memorabilia that had belonged to
 
a leading citizen.
 I referred them to the Archive program at NEH and observed
 
the process with interest.
 A number of appropriate experts in circus and medicine
 
show lore, American regional history etc. were sent copies of the proposal for
 
review -- generally favorable.
 The proposal then went to a "super-panel" of
 
archival experts none of whom had any interest in or experience with the particular
 
topic, and it got shot down on the basis of archival inexperience on the part of
 
the applicants.
 The thing that interested me about the process was not that the
 
proposal failed -- it was probably a pretty impractical project anyway -- but that
 
at no point along the way did any group of appropriate experts address the issue
 
of whether or not such an archive was needed (there could have been many others
 
already in existence) or was it a good idea anyway.
 This kind of super-ordinate
 
perspective is what a good discipline panel brings to the evaluation of every
 
project -- not only a weighing of the merits of the proposal per se, but how it
 
fits in to the over-arching needs and potentials of the particular field of activity
 
at the particular time.
 
- 2 -
 
I am aware that this is not a popular view at the moment, but I must add that
 
later experience with state arts agencies that have changed their structure from
 
discipline-based to functional has further convinced me of the correctness of my
 
observations.  The functional idea is appealing intellectually, but I have not
 
seen i
t produce intellectually exciting results; more frequently i
t results in
 
a kind of smoothing-over effect, reducing all activities and conversations to a
 
reliable level of mediocrity.  The essential problem is, i
t seems to me, that any
 
functionally focussed panel is bound to be talking most of the time about
 
particular proposals that none of the individual panelists know anything specifically
 
about; they then resort to generalizations and come up with a kind of consensus
 
s
tyle of decision making that may make for smooth administration but has little
 
positive effect upon the arts themselves.

Subject:
 Chairman's Request for Information on Grants to Individuqls
 
1
.
 In FY 1986, the Folk Arts Program awarded 12 National Heritage Fellowships.
 
In arriving at this relatively small number of fellowship grants for this
 
category, the guiding issue for our Advisory panelists was one of quality,
 
reasonable diversity in geography and the traditions represented, and maximum
 
visibility and impact, rather than budget limitations.  The total dollar amount
 
for the National Heritage Fellowships is relatively small, $60,000 in 1986.
 
Recently, some consideration has been given to increasing the amount of the
 
National Heritage Fellowship to $7,500 or $10,000.  The current $5,000 level is
 
small compared to other major national fellowships in the arts, and we will
 
continue to debate the appropriateness of raising this amount.
 Should an
 
increase be approved, the fiscal impact on a stable Folk Arts budget would
 
surely be noticeable.
 
2
.  Nineteen eighty-six was the last year of the Individual Apprenticeship  
category.  That year the Program awarded 34 totalling $78,900.
 Superceding
 
it was the State Apprenticeship Program category, a program of grants to state
 
arts councils which subgrant monies to individual apprenticeship projects.
 
In FY 1986, 13 state arts apprenticeship grants were awarded, totalling $297,300.
 
Our Advisory Panel gave high priority to this pilot program, and a sufficient
 
level'of funding was maintained to insure that all apprenticeship program grants
 
of high quality were supported, with the effect of reducing the amount of money
 
available in the Folk Arts Organizations grant category.
 (Cf. Folk Arts
 
statistical analysis to be included in the May Council pages shows the State
 
Apprenticeship Program now consumes 10% of Folk Arts annual budget.)
 
In developing apprenticeship subgranting programs at the state level,
 
flexibility at the Federal level has been the key to success.
 State programs
 
have been allowed great leeway in determining apprenticeship grant amounts.
 
It is clear, however, that these programs have set the level of these grants
 
at the amount needed for a successful apprenticeship, rather than decrease
 
the grant amounts due to fiscal limitations.
 
3
.  A few grants awarded to non-profit organizations may be directed to projects
 
focussing on a single individual.  One example in FY 1986 was a grant to California
 
State University at Fresno for a residency in the Fresno community by Cajun
 
fiddler and former National Heritage Fellow Dewey Balfa.  Another was to the
 
South Carolina State Museum for ornamental blacksmith Philip Simmons, another
 
Heritage Fellow, to create an ornamental gateway entrance to the museum as a
 
permanent exhibit.  We expect these occasional grants for projects by individuals
 
to remain a small part of our organizational grant activity and to fall by-and-
large within our general range of grant amounts.

My c
olleagues have already expressed t
hemselves with greater eloquence and
 
passion t
han I feel f
or t
his particular i
ssue.  Folk Arts has not worried
 
much about eligibility in t
he past, and our guidelines are not therefore
 
specific on t
he point.
 
What we have worried about (
since we are e
ssentially focussed on projects) i
s
 
who i
s involved in doing t
he project, what i
s t
heir t
rack record, t
heir artistic
 
reputation, their degree of experience.  Where we f
ind t
he artistic management
 
i
s exemplary but t
he f
iscal management i
s weak, we occasionally t
ry t
o help
 
find a f
low-through organization that can effectively handle the management
 
responsibilities.
 
I
nstitutions in Folk Arts have varying careers and l
ife-spans.  There are some
 
organizations t
hat c
ome i
nto existence for a s
pecific purpose and fade away
 
once that purpose i
s assured.  The Bicentennial Commissions are good examples.
 
We would not like t
o keep any organization alive beyond i
ts internal need;
 
it i
s also not e
specially useful t
o consider a "track record" when there's been
 
no t
ime t
o make one.
 
Turning t
o t
he i
ssue of when does existence begin, I agree with t
hose colleagues
 
who say t
hat it s
hould be measured f
rom
, t
he initial artistic production, not
 
f
rom t
he moment when IRS guarantees a non-profit status.  Again, Folk Arts often
 
deals with relatively venerable organizations who simply have not applied for
 
official 501 C 3 status because t
hey did not consider t
hemselves in danger of
 
ever making any money.
 
I
t i
s becoming a t
ruism but I would hope t
hat t
he Endowment could retain a f
lexible
 
position on eligibility.  I would assume t
hat in t
en years t
he Folk Arts f
ield
 
(
and t
herefore t
he Folk Arts Program) would be quite different, perhaps more like
 
Literature or Visual Arts.  Then we might f
ind strict eligibility criteria useful;
 
now, we would not.

Folk Arts Program
 
State of t
he Arts - Folk Arts
 
There are several difficult problems that emerge from an att:(empt to identify
 
useful indicators for the field of Folk Arts:
 
a
.  Breadth of field. Just as design is everywhere, so are the folk arts.
 
Particular traditions may be highly developed and widely accessible (
south-
western Indian pottery; Appalachian string band music) or vestigial and
 
inconspicuous (
innumerable small local traditions).  We cannot therefore
 
assume, as can Opera Musical Theater and Theater by contrast, t
hat our annual
 
application load is even roughly coincident with the field.  Our field is all
 
over the map, and we may hear from any part of it at any time.
 
b
.
 Intermittency. In FY 86, 50% of our grants went to "cooperating
 
institutions" -- schools, arts institutions such as museums or media centers,
 
and non-arts agencies such as tribes or ethnic organizations.  A museum may
 
put on a superb exhibition of Ukranian folk embroidery one year, and may not
 
do anything else in folk arts for three or four years; a non-profit radio
 
station may broadcast a series of old time gospel concerts in the f
all and
 
repeat it in the spring or never again.  We have only two sectors from which
 
we can expect consistent effort over time: the state/regional/local folk arts
 
network we have been working on for the past eight years, and the handful of
 
institutions that are devoted exclusively to folk arts.  The latter number
 
scarcely more than ten.
 (There are perhaps another twenty that came into
 
existence only to take care of a single tradition, or event, or group; therefore
 
we hear from them only intermittently as well -- e
.g. the Sacred Harp Publishing
 
Company, the Italian Folk Arts Federation, the North Carolina Quilt Project).
 
Again like Design Arts, t
he factor of intermittency makes prediction difficult,
 
though certain sampling techniques might be productive over time.
 
c
.  Terminological confusion. Sampling, however, i
s made the more tricky
 
by peoples' unbudgeable tendencies to call things what they want to call them .
 
In discussing their traditional arts, Native Americans tend to use the term
 
"tribal," European-Americans use "ethnic," Anglo-Americans say "folk," while
 
Asian-Americans do none of the above and prefer to speak of specific s
tyles
 
of activities, such as "kabuki" which they refuse to classify as classical,
 
folk, popular or anything else.  Similarly presenters tend to lump anything and
 
everything from a particular group together (
e.g. listing arts, news, and sports
 
broadcasts in the Italian language under "ethnic") or they have made up their
 
own definitions (
in radio, t
he term "folk" is used to indicate any song
 
tradition accompanied by acoustic s
tringed instruments).  And even the word
 
- 2 -
 
"art" is sometimes circumscribed.  The Abby Rockefeller Museum at Williamsburg
 
limits their definition of folk art t
o anonymous objects produced before the
 
twentieth century, thereby reserving the term for visual arts only.  Folk Arts
 
is used to operate within this complex s
tate of affairs; however, it sharply
 
limits our ability to suggest easy methods of sampling the field (
e.g. examining
 
annual records of major museums to determine how many "
folk arts" exhibits
 
they mounted -- one would almost have to look at each catalogue separately).
 
d
.  Variability of needs. This i
s a factor almost too delicate to bring
 
up, but t
he fact is, a healthy state of affairs in one tradition might be
 
disastrous in another.  Marketing is an excellent example; where one group of
 
crafts workers (
e.g. South Carolina coiled basket makers) might blossom along
 
with a growing market, others (
Navajo sand painters; Ukranian egg decorators)
 
find the suggestion of marketing assistance downright offensive.  Each art
 
form has i
ts own internal criteria for success.
 This is not unheard of, after
 
all, in t
he "classical" or "
fine arts" world where arguments over popularization,
 
creativity and avant gardism are frequent, and where artistic health, therefore,
 
tends to be measured in neutral terms of institutional s
tability.  In an
 
un-institutionalized field like Folk Arts, almost every situation must be looked
 
at separately to try to help determine whether a tradition is being well-served
 
or not.
 
In spite of the above difficulties, Folk Arts has taken a cut at some possible
 
indicators.  Overall, we feel that the s
tate network may prove the most reliable
 
source for truly useful information, as will be seen in the attached charts.

O
 
My thanks to you for
the time to talk with me
 
are long,  long overdue.
 Your perspective on cultural
 
pluralism has opened up whole new realms in my own thinking
 
about the Endowment - and your willingness to answer my
 
barrage of questions about anthropology, and folklore, and
 
your own experiences, meant more to me than I can say.
 
Since our talk,  I've read several of your brother's
 
more recent articles describing the Cantometrics project,
 
as well as some wonderful yellowed clippings from TIME and
 
of 
earlier 
describing the Library of
 
Congress project on American folksongs.
 Last week I saw
 
Land Where the  Blues Began,
•  am still reeling
 
powerful film.
 I'm Tooking forward to sitting in on the
 
Policy/Planning session at the end of the month when the
 
question of cultural and aesthetic pluralism will once
 
again be raised,  and am especially eager to hear your
 
brother's contribution to the dialogue.
 
As you know,  I have been feeling a growing pull towards
 
anthropology; and since our visit,  I have decided definitely
 
to apply for

 I take the GRE this
 
• after that will start sorting through
-
 
catalogues more critically, and visiting some schools,
 
to figure out which programs would be best.
 It would be a
 
terrific help to listen in on some of the AAA conference,
 
and I would still love to go if you're sure that auditors
 
are welcome.
 Your brother's thoughts about the different
 
programs would of course be extremely valuable, and if you
 
do think held be willing to offer some advice,  I hope
 
you'll let me know when would be the best time to speak with
 
him.
 If his visits to Washington are too busy,  I do go to
 
New York sometimes.
 
My travel plans 
- also  become firm.
 By a great
 
stroke of luck, this is the perfect moment for both my
 
boyfriend and me to pull up stakes, and we have decided t
 
spend from January until the summer in France, doing
 
everything possible to learn the language well.
 I'm very
 
excited about the trip, as an adventure and also because
 
knowing another language in addition to Spanish could wid
 
possibilities for field research in graduate school.
 I
 
When you and I spoke about your trip to the Pacific
 
Islands,  I mentioned that I might be going in that direction
 
and offered my untrained (but willing!)  services,  if they
 
could be of use to you in some way.
 Sadly, the Pacific
 
Islands are too far from Europe to make that possible now.
 
But we will probably

as Yugoslavia,  during the summer;  and if for any reason at
 
all you need some digging done in France, Yugoslavia,  or
 
the countries between  .
..  I still hope you'll let me know if
 
something occurs to you.
 
Again, thank you for being so generous with your time.
 
Rather than offer pointed advice, you did the greater thing
 
of sharing ideas - and left me with so much more to explore,
 
for that.
 
Sincerely,
 
P.S.
 The attached speech is the one I mentioned to you
 
that I wrote last May.
 Please keep it,  if you'd like.
 
We have plenty of copies.
