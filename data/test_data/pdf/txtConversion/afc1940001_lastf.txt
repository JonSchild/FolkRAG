Ben Rice The Last Fierce Charge.'Twas just before the last fearful chargeTwo soldiers drew a reinWith
a parting look and a touch of the handThat they might meet again.One was a blue-eyed with curling
hairNineteen but a month agoWith rosy cheeks and down on his chinHe was but a boy you know.The
other was tall, dark, stern and proudHis faith in this world seemed dimHis thoughts were of a blue-
eyed girlShe was all the world to him.The tall, dark man was the first to speakSaying, "Charlie, my
time has comeWe'll ride to the top of yon hill togetherBut you ride back alone."Together we've rode
through many a fightTogether on many a mileBut never before have we met the foeWith a calm
and a peaceful smile."We'll ride to the top of yon hill togetherBut you'll ride back aloneYou promise
me some trouble you'll takeFor me when I am gone."Upon my breast you'll find a fond faceI wear
it to the fightWith a glad blue eye and sunny curl'Tis like a morning light."The morning light so ?
To gladden my lonely lifeBut little did she think of the fate of this worldWhen she promised to be
my wife."Oh, write to her tenderly, Charlie,Send back this fair fond faceAnd tell her tenderly how I
diedAnd where my resting place."Tell he her that I will wait for herJust on the bordering landBetween
heaven and earth until she comesThen we'll join heart and hand."This brought the tears to the
blue-eyed boyWhose heart was filled with pain"I'll do your bidding command," he said,"If I ride
back again."But if you ride back and I am leftWill you do the same for meI have a mother who waits
at homeSo write her tenderly.[ "?] "One after another she has lostA husband and a sonAnd I the
last to the country's callShe cheered and sent me on."She waits at home like a praying saintWhose
heart 'tis filled with woeWhen last we parted at the garden gateI'll [see her?] soon I know."Just then
came in order for a chargeEach soldier with sword in handThey looked at each other as they rode
onThose brave and devoted men.They charged upon that fearful fightThe fight they never could
gainAnd those who rode to death ? ?[ode Rode ?] safe back again.But among the dead and the
dyingWas the boy with the curly hairAnd the tall, dark man who rode by his sideLay dead beside
him there.No one to tell the blue-eyed girlThe words her lover had saidAnd the mother dear who
waits for her sonMust learn that he is dead. [*1?] [Contributed by "Jack ? Surname ?. Monterey,

HOPE, ONT., 1925It was just before the last fierce chargeWhen the soldiers drew their rein,For a
clasp of hand and parting [word?]For they might never meet again.Now one had blue eyes and
clustering [curls?],Nineteen but a month agoDown on his chin, red on his cheek,He was only a boy,
you know.The other was dark and stern and proud,His faith in this world was dim,He only [trusted?]
the more in thoseWho were all this world to him.They had [ridden?] together in many a raidAnd
marched for many a mile,But ever before had met the foeWith a calm and cheerful smile.Now then

they looked in each other's eyesWith an awful ghastly gloom,The darkstern man was the first to
speakSaid, "Charlie, my hour has come."We will ride together down the hillAnd if you ride back
againYou must promise a little trouble to takeFor me when I am slain.Upon my breast you will
find a face,I will wear it in the fight,With bright blue eyes and sunny curlsAnd a smile like morning
light.Write to her tenderly when I am gone,Send back that fair fond face,And tell her tenderly [?] how
I died,And where's my resting place.Tears dimmed the blue eyes of the boy,And his voice grew low in
pain,"I will do your bidding, Comrad mine,If I ride back again.""But if you ride back and I do not,You
must do as much for me,For I have a mother must hear the newsWrite to her tenderly.""She has
prayed for me like a watching saintHer pail face white with woe,It will break her heart when I am
goneI will with her soon I know." 2 "One after another of whom she lovedShe parted [husband?] and
son.I was the last my country calledBut she kissed and sent me on."Just then the order came for a
charge,In an instant hand clasped hand[,?]They answered nay and on they rodeThat brave devoted
band.And on they rode till they came to a hillWhere the revel shot and [shell?]A rifle death in the
toiling ranksAnd jeered them as they fell.And among the dead / that were left behindWas the boy
with the curly hair,And the dark stern[ /that?]man [rode?] by his sideLay dead beside him there.So
there was no one to tell the blue eyed girlThe words that her lover had said[And?] the mother at
home was never to knowThat her darling boy was dead.And they never will know the last fond
thoughtThat was sent to sooth their [pain?]Until they have crossed the river of deathAnd meet there
once again.--------------------
As I was walking in London fair city,As I was walking one morning in [spring?],I met a wild cowboy
all dressed in fine [?] ( leather ) And these are the words that that cowboy did sing. Chorus Beat the
drum lowly, play the fife slowly,Play the dead march as you bear me along,Take me to the prairie and
turn the sod o'er me,For I'm a wild cowboy, I know I've done wrong.Once in my sadle I used to be
happy,Once in my sadle I used to gay,But first took to drinking and then to card playing,Was shot by
a gambler and left here to die.(Chorus)Somebody write to a gray headed mother,Somebody write to
a poor sister dear,And then there's another fair dearer than mother,Who would bitterly weep if she
knew I lay here.(Chorus)
THE LAST FIERCE CHARGETwas just before the last fierce [ war? ?] charge,Two [warriors?] drew [ their
thar ?] rein,With a handclasp and a [pating?] word[ that ?] [For?] they [never?] might meet again.
[?] [his ? parting?]
One was a man, dark, stern and proud,His faith in the world was dim,He [only trusted?] the one he
loved,She was all the world to him.The other was a boy with curling hair[?]Nineteen but a month
ago,With a flush on his cheek and a dimpled chin,He was [only?] a boy, you know.Together they'd
rode on many a raid,And marched o'er many a mile,But never before had they faced the [?] foe But
with stern and steadfast smile.But now as they locked in each other's face,With a horrible ghostly
AFCCC-LASTF http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_lastf
gloom,The dark stern man was the first to speak,[Sayin?] , "Charlie, my hour has come. " Together
we'll ride to yonder hill,But you'll ride back alone.Will you promise a little trouble to takeFor me
when I am gone? " Upon my breast is a fair, fond face,I'll wear it to the fight,It has dark blue eyes
and curling hair,And a face like the morning light. " Like the morning light was her love for me,When
she gladdened my lonely life,And little did I think of this terrible warWhen she promised to be my
wife. " Write to her, Charlie, when I am gone,Send back that fair, fond face,Tell her tenderly how I
died,And where is my resting place. " Tell her my soul awaits for her,In the borderlands betweenThe
heavens and earth, and will wait till she comesWhich will not be long, I [ween?]. " " I'll do your
bidding, comrade mine,If you'll do the same for me.For I have a mother who awaits me at home,Will
you write to her tenderly? " Just then the order came to chargeFor an instant hand touched hand,Yea
andswered answered yea, and [onward?] they rushed,That brave and devoted band. 2 Together they
charged to the crest of the hill,Where the rebels, with shot and shell,Poured rifts of death into their
rank,And cheered them has as they fell.They turned with a horrible dying groanFor the heights they
could not gain,And those whom death and [?] doom had sparedRode slowly back again.But among
the dead who were left behindWas the boy wit with the curling hair,And the dark stern man who'd
rode by his sideLay dead beside him there.So there's no one to write to the blue-eyed girlThe words
her lover said,And the mother who / waits her boy at homeCan only know he's dead.She never will
know those last fond thoughtsTo save her woe and pain,Until she crosses the River of DeathAnd
stands by her boy again.
