Perry's Victory
Perry's Victory
AFS 1002 A1
Ye tars of Columbia, give ear to my story, Who fought with great Perry where cannon's
did roar. Your valor has gained you an immortal glory, A fame that shall last till time is no
more. Columbian tars are the true sons of Mars, They rake fore and aft when they fight on
the deep. On the bed of Lake Erie, commanded by Perry, They caused many Britons to
take their last sleep.
The tenth of September let us all remember, So long as the globe on her axis rolls round.
Our tars and marines on Lake Erie were seen, To make the proud flag of Great Briton
come down. The van of our fleet, the British to meet, Commanded by Perry, the Lawrence
bore down. Her guns they did roar with such terrific power, That savages trembled at the
dreadful sound.
The Lawrence sustained a most dreadful fire, She fought three to one for two classes
or more. While Perry undaunted, did firmly stand by her, The proud foe on every head
broadside did pour. Her masts being shattered, her rigging all tattered, Her booms and her
yards being all shot away. And few left on deck to manage the wreck, Our hero on board
no longer could stay.
In this situation, the pride of the nation, Sure heaven had guarded unhurt all the while.
While many a hero maintaining his station, Fell close by his side and was thrown on the
pile. But mark you and wonder, when elements thunder, When death and destruction are
stalking all around. His flag he did carry on board the Niagara, Such valor on record was
never yet found.

There is one gallant act of our noble commander, While writing my song, I must notice with
pride. While launched in the boat that carried the standard, A ball whistled thru her just
close to his side. Says Perry, “The rascals intend for to drown us, But push on, my brave
boys, you need never fear.” And with his own coat, he plugged up the boat, And thru fire
and sulfur away he did steer.
The famous Niagara, now proud of her Perry, Displayed all her banners in gallant array.
And twenty-five guns on her deck did carry, Which soon put an end to this bloody affray.
The rear of our fleet was brought up complete, The signal was given to break through the
line. While starboard and larboard and from every quarter, The lamps of Columbia did
gloriously shine.
The bold British lion roared out his last thunder, When Perry attacked him close in the
rear. Columbia's eagle soon made him crouch under, And roar out for quarter as soon
you shall hear. Oh, had you been there, I now do declare, Such a site as you never had
seen before. Six ready blood flags, that no longer could wag, All lay at the feet of our brave
commodore.
Brave Elliot, whose valor must now be recorded, On board the Niagara so well plays his
part. His gallant assistance to Perry afforded, We'll place him the second on Lake Erie's
chart. In the midst of the battle, when guns they did rattle, The Lawrence a wreck and the
men most all slain. Away he did steer and brought up the rear, And by this maneuver the
victory was gained.
Oh, had you but seen those noble commanders, Embracing each other when the conflict
was o'er. And viewing all those invincible standards, That never had yielded to any before!
Says Perry, “Brave Elliot, give me your hand, sir, This day we have gained an immortal
renown. So long as Columbia Lake Erie commands, sir, Let brave Captain Elliot with
laurels be crowned.”

Great Briton may boast of her conquering heroes, Her Rodney's, her Nelsons and all her
whole crew. But none in their glory have told such a story, Nor boasted such feats as
Columbians do. The whole British fleet was captured complete, Not one single vessel
from us got away. And present, some hundreds, Columbians wondered, To see all them
anchored moored out in our bay.
May heaven still smile on the shades of our heroes, Who fought in that conflict their
country to save. And check the proud spirits of murdering bravos, That wish to divide us
and make us all slaves. Columbians sing and make the ...
