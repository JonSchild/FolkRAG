MOTHER, HE'S GOING AWAY'. 
Sung in " BAtiNEY's Couirrsinr." 
Sure, now what are you crying for Nelly 
Don't be blubbering there like a 
fool, 
Wid the weight of the- grief, faith, I 
tell ye, 
Yell break down the three-legged stool. 
I 
suppose now you're crying for Barney, 
But den't believe a 
word that he'd say,

Sure you know how he served poor Kate Kearney—"

Oh I

"If he's going away all the better, 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort you can't get a 
letter, 
For yez neither can read nor write, 
'Twas only list week you protested, 
When he courted fat Biddy Maeree, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested, 
Wid abuse, sure, your tongue never rested—' 
"But mother I'—" Oh, bother I" 
" 
But mother he's going away ; 
An1 I 
dreamed that his ghost, 
Walk'd round my bed-post, 
Oh! mother he's going away."

MOLLY SAWN. 
0, Molly Bawn, why leave me pining, 
Or lonely waiting here for yon— 
While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they have nothing else to do. 
The flowers late were open keeping, 
TO try a 
rival blush with you, 
But their mother, Nature, kept them sleeping, 
With their rosy faces washed in dew. 
0, Molly, Sza. 
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, dear, 
And the pretty stars were made to shine; 
The pretty girls were made for the boys, dear, 
And maybe you were made for mine. 
The wicked watch dog here is snarling— 
He takes me for a 
thief, dye see ? 
For he knows I'd steal you, Molly, darling, 
And then transported. I 
should be. 
0, Molly, ice. 
THE LASS OF GOWRIE. 
'Twas on a 
simmer's afternoon, 
A wee before the sun gaed down, 
My 
lassie wi a braw new gown, 
Game o'er the hill to Gowrie. 
The roselind ting'd wi' morning show'r 
Bloom'd fresh within the sunnie bow'r, 
But Kitty was the fairest llow'r 
That ever blooin'd in Gowrie. 
I 
had nae thought to do her wrang, 
But round her waist my arms I 
fling, 
And said, " My lassie. will ye gang 
To -view the Carse o' Gowrie, I 
I'll take you to my father's ha' 
In you green field betide the shaw, 
And make ye lady o' them a'— 
The brawest wife in Gowrie 1" 
Soft kisses on her lips I 
laid, 
The blush upon her cheek soon spread, 
She whisper'd modestly, and said: 
" 
I'll gang wi' ye to Gowrie !" 
The auld folks soon gaCII their consent 
And to Mess John we quickly went, 
Wha tied us to our hearts' Content 
And now she's Lady Gowriel

WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN.. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And here, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign couuteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tho' richer land's -I've seen. 
Yet I 
can't forget Odd Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &c.. 
* 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
fr!end, 
He'll give. without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen ; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, & C, 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Thonah his wit 'tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &o. 
There's not a 
true-horn Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene. 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
love my, &O.'"' 
As sung by BARNEY THE GliWit. 
Oh I 
sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night, 
And the voice of the nightingale singing his tune, 
While the stars seem to smile with delight. 
Old natu-- ,ew lingers in silent repose, 
And Lie sweet breath of summer is calm, 
While I 
sit and wonder if Shamus e'er knows 
How sad and unhappy I 
am! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Shamus O'Brien, why don't you come home, 
You don't how know happy I'll be; 
I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with me 1 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep, 
4 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep— 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me? 
Oh! why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free I 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, &c,. 
Oh! Shamus O'Brien, I'm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do ; 
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you. 
Oh i 
Shamus O'Brien, Itc.

KATE KEARNEY. 
Oh I 
did you ne'er hear of Kate Kearnor? 
She lives on the banks of Killarney; 
From the glance of her eye, shun danger and fly, 
For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney. 
For that eye is so modestly beaming, 
You ne'er think of mischief she's dreaming; 
Yet oh ! I 
can tell how fatal's the spell 
That lurks in the eye of Kate Kearney. 
Oh ! should you e'er meet this Kate Kearney, 
Who lives on the banks of Killarney, 
Beware of her smile, for many a 
wile 
Lies hid in the smile of Kate Kearney. 
Though she looks so bewitchingly simple, 
Yet there's mischief in every dimple, 
And who dares inhale her sigh's spicy gale, 
Must die by the breath of Kate Kearney. 
ANSWER TO KATE KEARNEY. 
Oh! yes, I 
have seen this Kate Kearney, 
Who lives near the lake of Killarney ; 
From her love-beaming eye what mortal can fly, 
Unsubdued by the glance of Kate Kearney ? 
That eye, so seducinolv meaning, 
Assures me of mischief she's dreaming, 
And I 
feel ' tis in vain to fly from the chain 
That binds me to lovely Kate Kearney. 
At eve, when I've seen this Kate Kearney, 
On the flower-mantled banks of Killarney, 
Her smile would impart thrilling joy to my heart, 
As I 
gazed on the charming Kate Kearney. 
On the banks of Killarney reclining, 
M y 
bosom to rapture resigning, 
I've felt the keen smart of love's fatal dart, 
And inhaled the warm sigh of Kate Kearney. 
IRISH SCHOO.V
ST=. 
Oki Teddy O'Rourke kept 4 it el a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and made it a 
rule, 
If the mind wouldn't mark faith he'd soon mark the bask, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devilish crack. 
His scholars were: Jerry, Big Billy, and Ned, 
With Murrough M'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, 
Tall Dermot O'Clany, and Dennis O'Shea, 
Faith, all noble boys to drive learning away. 
SPORES —Well, my boys, says old Tea, as you are all here, I'll just 
be calling 'your names over, to see if any of' ye are missing. 
Gerald 
WShee.—I'm not here, sir.— Then where are you, agrah 9—I'm astride 
of the door, sir. —Then come in. and 
beat you. Corney O'Flaherty, 
—I'm here, but my brother Barney ain't.—Then where is your brother 
Barney 9—Faith, sir, he's dead and they're going to wake lune—Poor 
fellow I I'm sorry he's gone hone, for he was my own scholar 
but do 
you go and sit down, and don't fall asleep, or 
be altar waking you. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he's always ready, 
To hick up a 
row or the whiskey tn smack; 
With his drinking and eating, 
us birching and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row de Alow whack. 
Faith, Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton. 
And a 
chin, too! och honey, but they were all one; 
A 
grin, too, he had, and if there was a 
noise, 
he'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
A fortune he had, too :—his birch and his wig, 
A black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pretty plantation, a 
dog and a 
cat, 
And his head that he kept in an old greasy hat. 
SPOKEN.—Pholim O'Malieney, says he, one day, before you it down, 
e
- 
and up, and say your alphabet, so keep your flue fingers out of your 
head for a 
few minutes, and begin. 
What letter' that, sir- 9-1 don't 
know, sir.—Arrah, botheration to you, what was it I 
said when I 
saw 
you blacking Pat Mooney's eye 9—Faith, sir, you said: Ah 1 
you big 
blackguard.—Well, never mind the blackguard, but say ah.—Ah.--
Now, what letter's that 1—Faith, sir, I 
don't know, you ought to know 
better than me.—What makes the honey, and hold your whist 9—B.— 
That's a 
good boy. Now, what kind of a 
half moon thing do you call 
that 9—I don't know, sir.—Och ! 
botheration, what du I 
do with my 
%yes 9—He! lie 
he !— Well, what do you laugh at, sir ? I 
ask you what 
6, I 
do with my eyr 9—You ? you squint 1—And what else, sir 9—You 
see. -That's a 
good boy. Now go on.—D-E-F-G-H.—Well, why do you 
stop ?- 11t-cause I 
can't go on any further, si.—What has your mother 
got at the corner of her nose 9.—A pimple, sir.—Och, my service t'ye„ 
sir; and what else I —One eye.—Devil take you, and don't be getting 
into figures now. Say I, without the one,—I, without the one.—What's 
the next 9—It's something. sir, but I 
don't know what. —What does 
your mother open the door with 1—A string, sir, and sometimes her 
foot.—Well, did you never have anything else 9—Yes, sir K. - That's a 
good boy; and now, as you have got to L, (hell) you may it down and 
warm yourself. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For lie was always ready, 
To kick up a 
row, or the whiskey to erattek, 
With his drinking and eating, 
His birching and beating,

ROISIN DUBH. 
Oh! my sweet little rose, cease to pine for the past, 
For the friends that came eastward shall see thee at last: 
They bring blessings and favors the past never knew, 
To pour forth in gladness on my Roisin Dubh. 
Long, long, with my dearest, thro' strange scenes I've gone 
O'er mountains. and broad valleys I 
still have toiled on, 
O'er the Erne I 
have sailed as the rough gales blew, 
While the harp pour'd its music for my Roisin Dubh. 
Tim' wearied, oh ! my fair one, do not slight my song, 
For my heart dearly loves thee, and hath loved thee long; 
In sadness and in sorrow I 
shall still be true, 
And cling with wild fondness round my Roisin Dubh. 
There's no flower that e'er bloomed can my rose excel, 
There's no tongue that e'er moved half my love can tell ; 
Had I 
strength, had I 
skill the wide world to subdue, 
Oh the queen of that wide world should be Roisin Dubh. 
I-TA 1 
power, oh ! my lov'd one, but to plead thy riolit. 
I 
should speak out in boldness, for my heart's delight ; 
I 
would tell to all round me how my fondness grew, 
And bid them bless the beauty of my Roisin Dubh. 
The mountains high and misty, thro' the moors must go ; 
Tile rivers shall run backward, and the lakes oveifiow; 
And the wild waves of old ocean wear a 
crimson hue, 
Ere the world sees the ruin of my Roisin Dubh. 
THE SPINNING WHEEL. 
Mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning, 
Close by the window young Eileen is spinning ; 
Bent o'er the fire her blind grandmother sitting, 
Is croaning, and moaning, and drowsily knitting— 
" 
Eileen nchora, I 
hear some one tapping." 
"Ms the ivy, dear mother, against the glass flapping " 
" 
Lily, I 
surely heard somebody sighing." 
“'Tis the sound, mother dear, of the summer wind dying. ' 
CHORUS. 
Merrily, cheerily, noiselessly whirring, 
Swings the wheel, spins the wheel, while the foot's 
stirring ; 
Sprightly, and brightly , and airily ringing, 
Thrills the sweet voice of the young maiden singing. 
" 
What's the noise that I 
hear at the window, I 
wond er ?" 
" 
the little birds chirping the holly-bush under." 
" What makes you be shoving and moving your stool on, 
And singing, all wrong, that old song of "lite Coolan ?"' 
There's a 
form at the casement— the form of her true love— 
And he whispers with face bent, " Fin waiting for you 
love; 
Get up on the stool, through the lattice step lightly, 
We'll rove in the grove while the moon's shining brIhtly." 
Merrily, cheerily, &C. 
The maid shakes her head, on her lip lays her fingers, 
Steals up from her seat— longs tozo, and yet lingers ; 
A frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother, 
Puts one foot on the stool, spins the wheel with the other. 
Lazily, easily, swings now the wheel round, 
Slowly and lowly is heard now the reel's sound ; 
Noiseless and light to the lattice above her, 
The maid steps— then leaps to the arms of her lover. 
Slower—and slower—and slower the wheel swings ; 
Lower— and lower— and lower the reel rings; - 
Ere the reel and the IN heel stopped their ringing and 
moving, 
Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight 
are roving.

GOD BLESS OUR IRISH GIRLS.. 
God bless our noble Irish girls, 
God bless them all to- day ; 
We'll send the prayer far o'er the land, 
For other lips to say ; 
For when the tvranes hand was laid 
Upon the true and brave, 
In the tender pride of womanhood 
They rose to help and save. 
CII0ItUS. 
Then here's our own dear Irish girls, 
Here's to our maiden band, 
Who yet are seen to wear the green 
In the cause of the dear old land. 
What time a 
foeman's hireling crew 
Surrounded Limerick's wall, 
The maids of Limerick bravely stood 
To answer manhood's call. 
The spirit's not departed yet 
With the faithful who have died 
For freedom's cause— our own dear hearts 
Still muster by our side, 
Then here's our, &c. 
And walking in the funeral throng 
Which told a 
nation's woe, 
Ye showed the spirit changeless yet 
Of the days of long ago. 
The rain might fall, the wild wind sweep 
O'er bridge awl street and square., 
But firm as soldiers in the ranks 
So pressed ye onward there. 
Then here's our, &c. 
Oh, may the starry eyes which looked 
On mourning Freedom's sign, 
Yet flash their glorious light upon 
A nation's marshalled line. 
And may the prayer which maiden lips 
Have sent to God above, 
Bear to our stricken motherland 
The golden crown of love. 
Then here's our, & c. 
COME TO ME, DEAREST. 
Come to me, dearest, Pin lonely without thee ; 
Day-thne and night-time Pm thinking about thee; 
Night-time and day- time in dreams I. behold thee; 
Unwelcome the waking which ceases to fold thee; 
Come to me, darling, my sorrows to lighten, 
Come to thy beauty to bless and to brighten ; 
Come in thy womanhood, meekly and lowly ; 
Come in thy lovingness, queenly and holy. 
Swallows will flit round the desolate ruin, 
Telling of Spring and its joyous renewing; 
And thoughts of thy love, and its manifold treasure, 
Are circling my heart with a 
promise of pleasure; 
0 Spring of my spirit, 0 May of my bosom, 
Shine out on my soul till it burgeon and blossom; 
The waste of try life has a 
rose root within it, 
And thy fondness alone to the sunshine can win it. 
Figure that moves like a 
song through the even ; 
Features lit up by a 
reflex of heaven ; 
Eyes like the skies of poor Erin, our mother, 
Where the shadows and sunshine are chasing each other; 
Smiles coining seldom, but child- like and simple, 
Planting hi each rosy cheek a 
sweet dimple. 
Oh ! thanks to the Saviour that even thy seeming 
Is left to the exile to brighten his dreaming! 
You have been glad when you knew I 
was gladdened; 
Dear, are you stal now to hear I 
am saddened ? 
Our hearts ever answer m tune and in time, love, 
As octave to octave, and rhyme unto rhyme, love ; 
eatinot weep but your tears will be flowing— 
You cannot smile but my cheeks will he glowing; 
I 
would not die, without you at my side, love— 
You will not linger when I 
shall have died, love. 
Come to me, dear, ere I 
die of my sorrow ; 
Rise on my gloom like the sun of to-inorrow ; 
Strong, swift, : Intl fond as the words which I 
speak, love, 
With a 
sung on your lip, and a 
smile on your cheek, love ; 
Come, fin. my heart in your absence is weary ; 
Haste, for my spirit is sickened and dreary ; 
Conic to the arms Nvhich alone should caress thee ; 
Come to the heart which is throbbing to press thee.

BROGUE AND MY BLARNEY AND BOTHERING 
WAYS. 
It's true what I 
say, by the powers above, 
I'm getting quite fat though I 
live upon love, 
With my brogue and my blarney and botherin' ways. 
Five sweethearts I've got and sure I'm inclin'd 
To marry her first who is first in the mind ; 
I 
see them all round in the course of each day, 
And do all I

SONG OF THE LAST HARPER. 
Ah! dark are the halls where your ancestors revell'd, 
And mute is the harp that enliveu'd the day ; 
The tow'rs that they dwelt in, to dust low are levelrd, 
The signs of their greatness are sunk in decay. 
Where is the chief that strode forward to glory'? 
\\There is the bard that told valour's dread story II 
Alas I 
they are gone, and the years now before ye 
Are faintly illutuin'd by Fame's setting ray. 
0 
Erin ! whilst life in this bosom is swelling. 
Shall I 
neglect thee, the land of my birth ? 
On thy mountains ill hold with sweet Freedom my dwelling, 
And hymn forth thy praises, thou favourite of earth. 
Beauty shall weave rosy garlands beside me. 
Peace round thy shores shall with plenty provide me : 
In thy prosperous hour, 0 my country. I'll pride me, 
And the trials that point to the nations thy worth. 
LOVE AND THE NOVICE. 
"Hero we dwell in holiest bowers, 
Where angels of light o'er our orisons bend, 
Where sighs of devotion, and breathing of flowers, 
To caret' in mingled odours ascend, 
_Do not disturb our calm, oh love ! 
So like is thy form to the cherubs above, 
It well might deceive such hearts asours!" 
Love stood near the novice and listen'd, 
And love is no novice in taking a 
hint; 
his laughing blue eyes soon with piety glisten'd, 
llis rosy wing turn'd to Heaven's own tint. 
" 
Who would have thought," the urchin cries, 
" 
That love could so well, so gravely disguise 
His wondering wings nun wounding eyes 1" 
Love now warms thee, waking and sleeping, 
Young novice to him all thy orisons rise: 
He tinges the heavenly fount with his weeping, 
He brillfens the censer's flame with his sighs ! 
Love is the saint enshrin .0 
in thy breast, 
And angels themselves would admit such a 
guest, 
If he came to them cloth'd in piety's vest. 
'21 
CAN I FORGET THEE. 
They tell me, my country, that I 
must forget thee, 
Thy past is a 
volume to hide from my sight— 
:So thought of the glory and gloom that have met thee 
Should darken my day or illumine my night. 
But the fervour of love that enlightens my spirit, 
Is potent to bring thee a 
dream to my rest, 
Enrobel in the glory that thou dost inherit 
From time when thou sat'st like a 
queen in the west. 
Dispelled is the dream when the day-light comes o'er me, 
And shows in its rays all the ruins around ; 
Oh, can 1 
forget, with this ruin before me, 
The ow en of my soul whom her sorrows have crowned ? 
They say, whom ambition to high seats has lifted, 
Her sorrows must sleep, for there's sunshine at last : 
Woe ever— the present with hope is ungifted, 
'Tis dark with the horror and night of the past. 
And here by the grave where death's terrors have found 
1 
swear— and the chill's on my young brow for thee— 
That when I 
forget the dark story that bound me 
To Erin of Sorrows, may God forget me!

THE PEASANT GIRLS. 
The Peasant Girl of merry France, 
Beneath her trellis'd vine, 
Watches the signal for the dance— 
The broad, red sun's decline. 
'Tis there—and forth she flies with glee 
To join the circling band, 
Whilst mirthful soon (is of minstrelsy 
Are heard thonghout the land. 
And fair Italia's Peasant Girl, 
The Arno's banks beside, 
With myrtle flowers that shine like pearl, 
Will braid at eventide 
lice raven locks; and to the sky, 
With eyes of liquid light, 
Look up and hid her lyre out sigh — 
Was ever land so bright ?" 
The Peasant Girl of England, see 
With lip of rosy dye, 
Beneath her sheltering cottage tree, 
Smile on each passer by. 
She looks on fields of yellow grain, 
Inhales 'the bean-flower's scent, 
And seems, amid the fertile plain, 
An image of content. 
The Peasant Girl of Scotland goes 
Across her Highland hill, 
With cheek that emulates the rose, 
And voice the skylark's trill. 
Her tartan plaid she foPs around, 
THE PEASANT GIRLS.—[COITCLUDED.

Type of what varied j

A home in her kind breast. 
The Peasant Girl o reland, she 
Has left her calt home, 
Bearing white wreaths—what can it be 
Invites her thus to roam ? 
Her eye In:s not the joyous ray 
Should to her years belong; 
And, as she wends her languid way, 
She carols no sweet song. 
Oh ! soon upon the step and glance, 
Grief dues the work of age ; 
And it has been her hapless chance 
To open that dark page. 
The happy harvest home was o'er, 
The fierce tithe gatherer came; 
And her young lover, in his gore, 
Fell by a 
murderous aim ! 
Then, well may youth's bright glance be gone 
For ave from that eye, 
And soon will sisters weep upon 
The grave that she kneels by ; 
And well may prouder hearts than those, 
That there place garlands say— 
" 
Have Ireland's peasant girls such woes ?— 
When will they pass away ?"

the bar-ber's daughter. 
Sweet Seraphina Mackintosh, 
She was the girl I 
did adore, 
I 
loved her father's barber shop, 
I 
loved the pole outside his door; 
For her how often I 
felt raving, 
Mad with love both night and day, 
Three times an hour I 
wanted shaving, 
Then could not tear myself away. 
Cno.-But I'll throw myself, (tc. 
Alas! one fatal morn I 
went, 
To undergo my seventh shave, 
The barber of our loves got scent, 
And like a 
maniac did rave; 
He seized the razor, danced the " can-can," 
Smothered my eyes with lather hot, 
For fear that he might cut my nose off, 
Hastily I 
fled the spot. 
Cno.-To throw myself, dr,e. 
He told his child, the grey old willing, 
A

But he'd cut her off without a

If she but dared to think of me. 
Now she turns up her pretty nose, 
Whenever down that street I 
go, 
My friends call me a 
perfect muff, 
Whene'er I 
tell them of my woe.

THE WEDDING DAY. 
AIR 
" Nelly Gray." 
Oh don't you remember, John, the day that we were wed, 
how merrily the time passed away ; 
In our little humble home I 
was never left alone, 
Neat and clean we were on the Sabbath-day. 
" 
I 
wish you joy," she cried, " with your bonny blooming 
bride ;" 
Shure, don't they gambol, hiss, and toy, 
And galivant with Paddy. 
At them, so shy, I 
wink my eye, 
Awhile the darlint creatures, say. 
Ant :—" Be aisy, can't ye, Paddy." 
Paddy can stuff the blarney down, 
Paddy can grief in Nvbisky drown, 
And crack a 
bottle, joke, or crown, 
Such a 
broth of a 
boy is Paddy. 
Ant:— ' Low-backed Car." 
Last night I 
went a 
courting, 
And met Avid a 
mishap ; 
At Judy Riley's windy—I 
went to give a 
rap, 
But, bad luck to the cistern, 
Poor Paddy stood upon ; 
'Twas like the tricks—o' politics— 
Not to be depended on. 
Fur no sooner had I 
put 
The sowl o' me illigant foot 
On the lid, than it slipped, 
And, whish'—in I 
was dipp'd, 
Souse, head-over heels in the butt.

THE WEDDING DAY.—[CoNCLuDED. 
Ant :—" St. Patrick's Day." 
Faith! so many I've admired, I'm getting tired 
Of courting the smart little lasses at all ; 
I've tipped 'em the blarney ! but, spite of me blarney, 
They've bid Paddy, (bad luck l) good morning. 
I've kilt all my rivals again and again, 
And nine times for love, it's meself that's been slain ; 
Wid grief I 
am laden, for fear an ould maiden 
In die, without wedlock adorning. 
Ala :—" Ould Bog Hole." 
So now, who'll marry a 
nate Irishman! 
For a 
lady I'll do all iver I 
can ; 
I'm not very rich, but I'm born to good luck, 
I've a 
cow just died, and a 
dropsical duck, 
Pm expecting a 
fortune, and shure it won't fail, 
To come—when the income tax they repale; 
Shall I 
spake to the praste. to make it all right ? 
And order, for music, a 
pianny-fortniyht. 
Who'll wed a 
boy from the Emerald Isle ? 
Who'll on the suit of a 
bold Paddy smile ? 
Who'll send a 
letter, me grief to beguile, 
To Pat, number One-ty one. Lower Turnstile. 
Who'll wed a

Oh, to be sure, she don't like the brisk Irish lad.

Delights in sweet converse, and changes her sighs 
For the good humored chat of an Irish lad.

brisk Irish lad. 
The widow in sorrow declines the sweet joys 
Of public amusement, in sable all clad ; 
The widow her twelvemonth in mourning employs, 
Then hastens to church with an Irish had.

The tiniest glance of the trifles, 
That flashes from Kathleen's hair 
her voice like a 
rivulet gushing, 
Would silence the minstrel of dAwn, 
While cheating the Line she is hushing, 
When milking on Garigeen's lawn. 
Her brow than the snowflake is whiter, 
Her cheeks flushed with tint of the rose, 
Her eye than the morning star brighter, 
And her hair black and lustrous as sloes. 
She trips o'er the cowslips so lightly, 
As scarce'y their down to remove, 
And her bil:owy bosom heaves slightly, 
As if with the echoes of love. 
You follow the green banner streaming, 
And climb to the summit of fame; 
itly star is my darling's eye beaming, 
M Y 
glory her love-lighted fame. 
Place cannon and rifle before me, 
And Kathleen behind their array, 
Although into ribbons they tore me 
I'd bear my loved darling away! 
'TIS JOLLY TO HUNT. 
29 
'Tis jolly to hunt in the bright moonlight, 
When a 
man can couch in the six-foot fern, 
And the cold crisp nit. of the autumn night, 
Makes tit:, outlaw's faggot more clearly burn; 
After prayers, heaven bless him ! the fat red priest, 
Talks big of his park, as he sits at his feast; 
There is not an abbot, from sea to sea, 
But keepeth the best of his deer for me. 
'Tis merry to spend in the broad, broad town, 
When the mayor snores loud o'er his cup of wine, 
And the mercer, to clothe us, must needs roll down, 
his wool and his velvet so superfine. 
Let the mayor, heaven bless him ! so gravely sleep, 
Let the mercer boast of his vaults so deep, 
And seal up his chest with his padlocks three, 
There is still a 
bag of his gold for me. 
'Tis bonny to feast in the gay, gay bower, 
To the harp, and the lute, and the love-sick horn, 
Where they sing and they dance till the murk night hout 
Is busy as noon, and as blithe as morn, 
And the earl, heaven bless him! must needs command, 
ii is lady to smile on his trusty friend ; 
There's never a 
lady of high degree, 
But hoardeth her kindest of smiles for me.

MARY DRAPER. 
W ords by CHARLES LEVER, 
Esq. 
AIR—" 
Nancy Dawson.•' 
Don't talk lo me of' London dames, 
Nor rave about your foreign flames, 
That never lived—except in dreams, 
Nor shone, excep ton paper. 
I'll sing ' bout a 
girl I 
kno -v, 
Who lived in Ballywhaemacrow, 
And let me tell you, mighty few 
Could equal Mary Draper. 
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were blue, 
Her hair was brown of deepest line, 
Her foot was small and neat to view, 
tier waist was slight and taper ; 
Her voice was music to your ear. 
A lovely brogue. so rich and clear, 
Oh, the like again I 
ne'er shall hear 
As from sweet Mary Draper. 
She'd ride a 
wall, she'd drive a 
team, 
Or with a 
fly she'd whip a 
stream. 
Or maybe sing you " Rousseau's Dream," 
For nothing could escape her; 
I've seen her too, upon my word, 
At sixty yards bring down her bird ; 
Oh, she charmed all the forty-third ; 
Did lovely Mary Draper. 
And at the Spring assizes' ball, 
The junior bar would one all 
For all her lay' rite dances call, 
And Harry Deane would caper ; 
Lord Clare would then forget his lore 
King's Counsel, voting law a 
bore, 
Were proud to figure on the floor, 
For love of Mary Draper. 
The pars m, priest, sub-shetiff too, 
Were all her slaves, and so would you 
if you had only but one view 
Of such a 
shape and face, or 
Tier pretty ancles—but. ochone, 
it's only west of old Athlone 
Such girls were found— and now they're gone, 
So here's to Mary Draper. 
THE KITCHEN- POKER. 
Swate Widow Fag one winter's night, 
invited a 
tea-party, 
Of elegant gentility, 
And made the boys quite hearty, 
But just as they were breaking up, 
She miss'd her kitchen poker, 
And delicately hinted that 
The thief was Paddy Croaker. 
He'd stole her little poker. 
Her purty kitchen poker, 
She delicately hinted that 
he'd stole her little poker. 
Now Pat he was a 
grenadier, 
In what is call'd the grey light horse, 
And a 
cleaner, stouter, tighter boy, 
Upon my soul there never was. 
He cried out, " Blood and thunder, 
Do you take me for a 
joker, 
Do you think I'd come into your house 
And stale your durty poker. 
Your nasty kitchen poker." 
Do you think, Sce. 
Then Pat swore by the Hill o' Howth, 
And by the holy Father's, too, 
By all the ghosts in you church-yard, 
If they were gathered in a 
crew, 
Says he unto the widow. 
" 
Do you take me for a 
joker, 
Do you think I'd come to you fireside, 
And stale your thirty poker 
Your nasty. clarty poker; 
Do you think an Irish jintleman, 
Would stale your thirty poker ? 
But all that he could say or do, 
had no effect upon her, 
At length says she, " Now, Pat, will you 
Declare upon your honor 
Arralt ! Paddy wared and started back, 
his hand behind his ehoaker, 
" 
Touch my h000r, touch my life, 
There's your durty poker ! 
Your nasty, filthy poker." 
Touch my honor, Sce.

DOGHERTY'S WAKE. 
In a 
purty mud mansion, not far from Kilkenny, 
Mike Dogherty lived wid his Wirth,' mild pig, 
'There very few were to excel him, if any, 
At twisting a 
stick, or at dancing a 
jig. 
So handsome and bowld, so gay and so frisky, 
lie won all the hearts ov the girls, I 
declare ; 
If he got in a 
row, when halt muddled with whiskey, 
By the powers of mud ! lie was all the way there. 
It was one aftbernoon, about six in the mornin', 
lie fell in wid a 
most disordherly mob, 
When a 
flintily shiillalagb, widout any warnin', 
Just paid its respects to poor Do,gherty's nob. 
pool Mike ! he was kilt and settled complately, 
So home, on a 
shutter, his corpse they did take, 
In an egg-chest, so snug, he was laid chute and ' lately, 
And they made preparations for Dogherty's wake. 
The corpse it was laid on a 
three-legged table, 
They bawl'd out, " Dear Mikeytti, arrah! why did yer 
die? 
Jist pull up your boots, and wake up, if yer 
But Mike too pervarse was to open his eye, 
The company found they'd no chance of' succedi 
For the sPalpeen lay still, and no notice would take, 
So, they left off their howlia' and all t 
id( to feedin' 
On herrings and praties, at Dogherty's wake. 
When dinner was over, a 
dhrop ov the cratimr, 
Was baled out in buckets, by Barney M'Fling, 
Who, for once, condescindid to be undher-waiter 
To Paddy Magee, who'd his eye in a 
sling. 
[1] 
DOGHERTY'S WAKE.---[CONCLUDED. 
Addressing Mike Murphy said he, " Mikeyul dearest, 
%Yin yer take it in wather, or in its raw state ?" 
Twas iist thin, a 
voice, of all voices the queerest, 
Said," Barney, me boy, shure, I'll take a 
dhrop nate!" 
The ladies screamed " murther," and rushed from the 
cabin, 
And over aich other did tumble, pell tnell ; 
Said Paddy Magee, " Shure, we'll soon shtop his blabbin', 
Ile thinks he's alive, but he's dead, we know well." 
So they sat on the lid, while M'Bride fetched a 
hammer 
From Lary Malone's, at the hid ov the town ; 
Then they all set to work, (what I 
say shure's no cram-
mer), 
And wid big iron nails, by me sowl ! screwed him down. 
Let me out, ye spalpeens," said Mike Dogherty, " will 
yez, 
Alive, shure, and kicking is your deceased frind ; 
If ye don't let me out. by the powers ! I'll kill yez." 
And, with that, he let fly, and he kicked out the hid. 
From the egg-chest he crawled out, and then loudly bawl-
ed out, 
" 
By me sowl! all the lot into mince-mate I'll make :" 
Then, widout any parley, he seized his shillalagh, 
And the heads broke of those who had come to his wake. 
lie larruped them well, till his arm took to tirin', 
Altho', about that, shure, he warnt over nice; 
Said lie, " As to lave off, I 
am now desirin', 
I'll give yez, me boys, a 
sound bit of advice, 
Next time you are wakin' a 
cdrpse, I 
am thinking, 
A 
little more prudence ye'd better dishclose ; 
And, if in his presence yez e'er should be drinkin' 
Don't pass wk'. the whisky so close to his nose!"

PADDY, THE PEEP 0' DAY BOY. 
Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
By THOS. T. 
RAMSEY. 
Paddy Flinn was the broth of a 
boy, a native of Dublin 
Town, 
No man could pick Paddy up, but Pat could knock any 
man down ; 
He was the dread of the men folks, of the ladies bold Pat 
was the joy, 
Paddy turned the night into the morning, so Pat was the 
peep-o'-day boy. 
CHORUS. 
Wid his shamrock, his sprig, and his whiskey, 
Philliboo, tiptywhach, joy, 
For the twisting shillelagh or whiskey 
()eh! Pat was the peep-o'-day boy. 
Pat was a 
good-tempered fellow, och! sure it was easy 
to prove, 
If he gave his best friend a 
good bating, sure it was only 
for love. 
His father, he died very wealthy, and made Paddy as rich 
as a 
jew, 
And the goods and the chattles he gave him, 
I'm now after telling to you. 
Spoken— Faith Paddy's father died one day of the gout 
in his stomach, because they could'a keep it in his toe ; 
well, he left Paddy all he had besides what he had not got; 
there was an Wegant feather bed, made of straw ; a 
pair 
of beautiful blankets made of the best calico, rather worn 
out ; there was a 
string of brass buttons cut out of leather, 
a 
culender widout ever a 
hole in it, and an elegant tea-
[11 
35 
PADDY, &c.—[CoNcLuDED. 
kettle, full of holes; a 
pair of wooden silver spoons; half a 
dozen of knives and forks widout blades or handles; a 
pair 
of oad shoes for one was a 
boot wid cloth upper leathers ; 
thin there was an iron pot with something in it, that was 
a 
thundering great hole; thin he left him all the money 
he could get ny working, which made Paddy as rich as 
any poor man would wish to be. 
Wid his shamrock, ece. 
Then Paddy took to him a 
wife as fat as a 
pig and as frisky, 
And she cauch the fever one day by sucking too freely at 
whisky, 
Till they met wid sore trouble one day as great as the 
heart could desire, 
For the pig tuck away the pratees, and the cabin by the 
powers took fire. 
Spoken—As Paddy and Biddy were standing one day at 
the back door in front of the house talking together wid-
out a 
word, there comes Paddy O'Connor walking down 
the hill as fast as he could run up it. 
Och, Biddy you 
divil, says he, get you down to your father's cabin, for the 
pig has run away with the pratee garden under his arm, 
and the cabin is in a 
blaze. 
Och, blazes. cries Pat, why did'nt you put it out before 
it caught; because, says O'Connor, it was burned down 
before it took light, so away they run, and sure enough 
every stick that was standing was burned to the ground, 
and all the furniture that they saved was burned to death' 
and there stood the poor old father tearing all the hair off 
his bald head, and crying his blind eyes out of his head to 
think he had lived to see such a 
sight. 
Wid his shamrock, & c.

THE HOUSE THAT PAT BUILT 
WITH DIALOGUE. 
AIR:—" St. Patrick was a 
Gentleman." 
Pat Harty was a 
gentleman, who lived in state and glory, 
lie built a house in Dublin town ; I'm going to tell the 
story ; 
This house had doors and windows too, a 
chimney and A 
thatch tilt, 
Wid up-stairs rooms on the ground floor, and this is the 
house that Pat built. 
CHORUS. 
Och! this is the house that Pat built. 
Spoken.—And sure it was an illegant mansion, built all 
of mud and sticks, wid a 
snug piece of background in the 
front of the house ; every pane of glass in the windows is 
wood ; the very best straw made ot deal shavings was the 
pan-tiles it was thatched wid ; it was Pat's own freehold, 
held on lease from the lord of the manor. 
Och ! this is the house, ete. 
There's the praities, by some call'd spuds, of Pat's own 
garden growing, 
All rent and torn, you see tfte sacks, which to you I'm 
showing ; 
Behold! they're lying on the floor, nearly half a 
sack spilt. 
And this is the pig that eat the spuds, that lay in the 
house that Jack built. 
THE HOUSE Sze,.--[CONCLUDED. 
Fpoken,—Och ! faith and sure that was a wonderful por-
ker that same pig, he always walked backward to go for-
wards ; and a 
mighty great thief was that same pig, for 
he got up one morning before he went to bed, and ran 
away with the praitie garden under his arm, so he did. 
Och ! this is the house, &c. 
This is the cow with the crumpled horn, that used the cart 
to pull to, 
But it never gave a drop of milk, for this cow was a 
bull, 
too; 
Here's the dog that bit the pig, though it may strange 
appear, sirs. 
As this porker was a 
boar, he got the wrong sow by the 
ear, sir. 
Spoken. —Yes, faith! the sow was a 
boar, and the cow 
was a 
bull; but sure that was all owing to the climate, 
for the bfats grow naturally in Ireland. 
Och 
this is the house, &c. 
There's the maiden all forlorn, Pat's darling Kitty 0 
Reilley, 
That milk'd the cow with the crumpled horn, and winked 
at Paddy slyly; 
There's Pat and his shillelagh sprig, ripe and ready a 
lilt, 
And here's the praist that married them all in the house 
that Pat bull 
°eh! this is the house, tic.

Och, sure, we're the boys for warlike joys, 
As ever were yet enrolled ; 
Bad luck to the foe, we'll let them know

From the Shannon's mouth to the Hill o' Howth, 
By the bowly Pat we'll fight,

May every coward's 
corpse never be waked if he don't wake up and jine this corpse. 
Och ! and ain't we the boys to slaughter the inimy : won't we

Bedad it will

PADDY'S TACTICS, OR NO FOOL ON A MARCH. 
AIR:—" Girl I 
left behind." 
.et bogtrotters and spalpanes rail, 
At true love and affection, 
And say my Judy's false and frail, 
And will not stand inspection. 
I 
beg to say it's no such thing, 
You'll in marching order find me, 
Wid Biddy constant as the spring, 
Before me or behind me. 
Spoken—By the power of Peg Blarney, some people 
always measure other people's bushels by their own corn. 
Thin men that rail most against a 
woman, are no women 
thimselves, and the devil a 
bit of man is there about thim 
at all at all. 
Sich spalpanes are always retreating whin 
their advancing, and whin the drum bates to arms they 
take to legs, and by the powers they are never among the 
killed and wounded, they are always found among the 
missing. 
March where I 
will, hault where I 
may 
From private to commander, 
The devil a 
pin's to choose I 
say, 
They load and prime would slander, 
Then let them gab of that and this, 
This very same reminds me, 
I 
always left a 
parting kiss, 
Before me or behind me. 
Spaken—That's true for me, sure. and Paddy's no fool on 
a 
march, I 
always keep my eye on the corporal, sure when 
a 
man comes to the charge of flattery with a 
woman, it's 
always a 
sign that he is manceuvring with a 
masked battery 
and manes to break the ranks of honesty, bad luck to that

man, says I, who does not act honest to a 
woman if he is 
ever so big a 
rogue to her. I 
would have such a 
fellow 
shot by a 
court-martial and tried afterwards. 
Och! that's 
true for me. 
I 
often get sly drops of drink, 
But duty does remind me, 
Tho' quite blind drunk, I 
take the wink, 
And sober you will find me ; 
Sure and love snd fighting too, 
As well as fun and drinking, 
Faith women I 
delight in too, 
And stick to them like winking. 
Spoken—Och! nods and winks are mighty queer com-
rades, they are more powerful than words, they are like 
dogs that bite widout barking, or an air gun that does 
death widout execution. 
Faith, it aint the man that says 
the most spakes the most, but he spakes most that says 
nothing, faith, a 
still tongue makes a 
wise head if it's ever 
so noisy—as for spalpanes, faith, they are as common as re-
cruits at a 
country fair and all marching under false drill 
and worse service. 
Right- about face is to turn their back 
on an honest action. 
To advance is to bate a 
retreat. all 
the good conduct they've got is bad, all the service they've 
got they never had, their good name is a 
disgrace to the 
regiment, their glory is dishonor, and all their ,reward is 
punishment, for they get stripes to their back instead of 
their arms.

ROOLAGAN'S DRAME. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Last night in the midst of me snorin, 
I 
had such a 
beautiful drame— 
With the noise of a 
dam when it's roarin, 
To me, Phelim 0 
Dowd It was. came. 
In his hand thin he held a 
big platter, 
in the other a 
yard of a

Says I," A h good Lard, what's the matter ?" 
For he looked like the man in the moon. 
His hair stood on end like bristles, 
His eyes looked like comets afire. 
His voice, like a 
million of whistles. 
With anguish did make me perspire. 
Now, Phelim," says I. " don't fool agin, 
You look like a 
horse that is bate." 
Says he, - Me darlin mild I 
loolagan 
l'm thirstin for s'..methin to ate." 
" 
Ah ! Phelim me bye, this is owin' 
To what you have writ abouthash: 
Shure 1 
knew when I 
heard you were crowin' 
One day you would go all to smash." 
" 
Missus Hoolagan." says he, " be kindly 
Like the boarding-house dame that we knew, 
Shure ye know I 
can't ate yet. hash blindly 
So just plase me and call it a 
stew." 
Then I 
filled up his platter a 
heapin,' 
'Twas emptied as fast as I 
filled. 
You can swear that he kept me a 
leapin' 
Till I 
thought that myself would be killed. 
" 
Good Phelitn, says I 
quite affriehted, 
And in tones that would charm a 
young toad, 
"It's meself, boy, that would be delighted 
if you'd move to another abode." 
En 
HOOLAGAN'S DRAME.---LCuNCLUDED. 
Says be, 
I'll not laave this stool agin, 
me hunger is fully appased 
And I'll tell you now, Missis 0 
Hoolagan, 
You better stop lookin' amazed." 
Then says L 
while tears were a-fallin, 
tried yer big stomach to fill, 
I 
might as well try what's appallin' 
To fill the lake over the hill." 
Thin I 
took in tnc hands the big ladle, 
And shoveled the hash in his maw, 
T 
lithe little one cried in the cradle, 
In affright at the size of his jaw. 
Bat he swallowed it all like a 
jaguar, 
Till at last but scrapin' he got; 
And then like a 
half- famished nager, 
Be jabbers, he swallowed the pot. 
With that -Mister Hoolagan awoke me, 
With kickin' and roaring with pain, 
" 
Me Limerick Belle, you will choke me, 
If you try these ould tricks but agin," 
Bedad, with the hair from the mattrass, 
I'd crammed him as rain does a loud— 
You can bet then I 
worked liko a 
jackass, 
For I 
thought I 
was feeding O'llowd. 
Next mornin' I 
went to me kitchen, 
And made me girls dance like a 
flash, 
For a 
fight me old bones were a 
itchen' 
On account of the warfare on hash. 
'filen I 
looked at me bills of fare slowly, 
Through the word then my pen 1 
drew, 
Since the papers have made hash unholy, 
hereafter, we'll call it a 
stew. 
Now, landladies, if you'd be hoarders, 
Of bright silver 
ollars at call, 
Don't attempt to fill up your boarders, 
For some have no bottom at all. 
Then if they begin their old 
With faces as black as a 
cloud, 
Try cou, till you get them a 
howlin, 
Ihen send them to Phelina O'Dowd.

PADDY ON THE RAILWAY. 
TUNE :-" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
Paddy one day from Greenock Town, 
To Glasgow City, sure was bound, 
He swore that if it cost him a 
crown, 
He'd go along the Railway. 
Paddy trorn home had never been, 
A Railway train had never seen, 
He longed to see the great machine, 
That runs along the Railway. 
With that he flew in furious case, 
Tell me the Railway if you plase, 
My carcase will not be at aise, 
'Till I 
have seen the Railway. 
CHORUS. 
Hubbaboo, dideroo, fillaloo all the way, 
Three hundred miles in half the day, 
Alt 
says he get out of the way, 
I'm going by the Railway. 
Then off he flew with furious might, 
And put the people in a 
terrible fright, 
Blood and 'ouns get out of my sight, 
I'm going to catch the Railway. 
The Railway Station soon be found, 
The first-class fare he then paid down, 
Thinking thus to be first in town, 
That day upon the Railway. 
Paddy, who'd been the ladies delight, 
Jumps into a 
box with all his might, 
Chock full ot ladies dress'd in white, 
Who \\ ere going by the Railway. 
Hubbaboo, 
[1] 
PADDY ON, &C.--[CONCLuDED. 
He sat amongst their satins white, 
They screamed with all their might, 
For he put them in a 
dreadful fright, 
That day upon the Railway. 
Up came a 
chap with curly hair, 
Swore that Paddy hadn't paid his fare, 
And cursed him for an Irish bear, 
Who'd infer been on a 
Railway. 
Pat's Irish blood began to rise 
lie took the spalpeen by surprise, 
He bled his nose and bladed his eyes, 
That day upon the Railway. 
Hubbaboo, 
The peeler soon grabbled poor Pat, 
And before the magistrate, ( that's fiat.) 
lie swore he had been in fact, 
Nigh muriered on the Railway. 
For three months Paddy was sent to the mill, 
Bad luck to the Rail he.  had his fill, 
The silent dodge made hint quite ill, 
After excitement on the Railway. 
Soon he grew quite thin and weak, 
Thinks lie I've had a 
narrow squeak, 
For bedad, they'll not let me even speak, 
Through fighting on the Rahway. 
Hubbaboo, fillaloo all the way, 
Cure there was the devil to pay, 
.1 never shall forget the day, 
That I 
ran on the Railway.

We'd not set sail six weeks or more, 
When lor', the winds began to blow, 
For Mary Anne my heart felt sore, 
I 
wished myself at home with her in Pimlico; 
The sea behaved uncommonly rough 
To the gallant " Timbuctoo,"

shock, that sent her on a 
rock, 
All amongst the ehunkumehoo— 
'Mongst the horrid Chunkumchoo.

grandmother for dinner, I 
never expected to see the one— 
Cho—Whose heart was true, tte. 
They made me captive, dressed me up 
In nothing but top-boots, feathers and paint, 
You would not be surprised to hear, 
I 
felt so queer I'd nearly faint; 
Their interesting queen proposed 
Her husband I 
should be, 
But as she'd nine, I 
begged to decline, 
Her making the tenth of me— 
Very kind, but not for me.

already one— 
Cho.—Whose heart was true, &-,e. 
One day from the sweet Chunkumchoos, 
I 
took to my heels and off I

I 
soon beheld the one I 
lov'd, 
Also her children three ! 
And her husband 
oh lor' t 
showed me the door, 
Said, " There was no room for me,"— 
He " regretted" he'd no room for me. 
Spoken.—Why, why was I 
not served up at a

IRISH DRUMMER. 
IRISH DRUMMER.-[CONCLUDED. - 
Pat Fagan Malony Mahony's m name, 
At thirteen I'll bet you've heard of my fame, 
I 
was horn in dear Dublin, or near thereabout. 
One day when my father and mother were out. 
I 
very soon grew up a 
Lreat strapping boy, 
The dear girls of Ire!and I 
murder with joy, 
My mind was on pickaxes, shovels and beds, 
'Till I 
listed myself in the Irish Squads. 
My eyes wasn't straight, but they didn't, mind that 
For the one and all cried, 011, my beautiful Pat 
Sel7eatit and major, and all was struck dumb. 
Such skill I 
displayed when I ', lowed up the drum. 
Spoken.- 011, had luck to me. every blowI gived that drum was just 
like a 
thunderstorm. 
Bad luck to you, you dirty levil, says the Ser. 
grant, you've broke the drum of my ear. 
So much the better your 
honour, says I, for you'll not he able to hear what the dirty world say 
of 
on when you're gone dead. ° eh, what's your name ? Och, my 
name is Pat Fagan Malony Mahony, first cousin to Mike Murphy 
Douakoo, and second to Dooney Mactwoler, who has nineleen to call 
him father, and twenty-nine grandfather, and had luck to time but I'm 
the pig of the whole family. 
Never mind, says lie, are y 
ou ready to 
turn out and fight the king of the Chinese 7 By my soul I 
am, says I. 
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll hire Queen Victoria for my mistress, and 
I'll soon make her master of the enemy. A 
rrah, cushla you are not 
going to leave us, says my grandmother. To be sure he's not, says 
the old grandfather. 
Not without ‘vishing, us good-bye, says in v 
little 
sweetheart. 
So you see they all I 
id hold of the tail of my coat, and 
being rather old, the tails gave way, and off I 
set singing: 
Rub a 
dub, dub, this way and that way, 
Right about face, quick march away. 
We had not gone far when the Sergeant cries, Stand, 
We shall ne'er get to China by walking on land, 
So to ma ,.e a 
short story out of a 
-very long trip, 
He landed its all on board of a 
ship. 
My head it spun -round, and t,.e whiskey I 
spilt, 
So sea-sick was I, I 
thought I 
was kilt, 
Says I. stop the ship, put me out, in a 
crack, 
I've altered my iniud, and I 
want to go back. 
But the devil a 
bit would they alter their course, 
For 1 
bawled and I 
squalled till I 
made my self hoarse, 
But, och, in a 
jiffey they doctored my pain, 
When they sung out, here is China, a 
beautiful main. 
Spoken. — Be Wife' indeed, the devil a 
bit of beauty aid I 
see about 
it; it was as dingy as it dust- man, and built on the wrong side of the 
way. Hurrah ! says they, 
What for ? says 1. 
The General, says 
they. 
Bad luck to him, says I, whether he's a 
Man or a 
monkey. Are 
you ready 1 
says they. 
What for ? SaySI. 
To fight, says they. 
By 
my soul I 
am, says I. and then began the row. 
Then the enemy drew nigh, and the cannons let fly, 
And the General did shout, Now lads, serve them out, 
We'll soon make the villains to force back, 
When I 
received a 
knock, a 
dreadful shock, 
Bad luck to me if I 
could tell, 
Whether I 
was on horseback when I 
fell. 
But up I 
got and fired a 
shut. 
J 
Which roared like thunder, 
And made ' eat all wonder, 
Says I, we'll soon beat, 
'Tis best we do not retreat, 
Wneu the General did cry, 
You know better than 1; 
For all our blood's spilt, and every one kilt. 
Spoken.—Treat, it was a 
treat. Run. Pat, you devil, says I, and sure 
enough I 
did run, over dead bodies and ditches and cow-ponds. While 
I 
was sticking up to my knees in a 
cow-pond, up comes a 
tall Chinese 
bog- trotter. 
Paddy, you devil, stand, says he. 
I 
shan't, says 1, and 
so I 
sat down. 
With that he cocked his gun, and by the hohey pokey, 
he knocked my nose slap off my face. 
1 
fired at hint, and when I 
fired 
he tumbled, and wheu he tumbled he fell, but bad luck to him, he 
wasn't kilt. 
Quarter, quarter, says he. 
Oh, you dirty unreasonable 
beast, says I, do you dam; I've time to stay and quarter you on the 
field of battle? 
So 1 
took out my sword and cut him in half, and went 
away singing, 
Rub a 
dub, &e. 
When we came to headquarters, we all made a 
stop, 
For the trait of some whiskey, I 
thought I 
should drop, 
The battle deprived many men of their charms, 
For some of them had their heads under their arms. 
Och ! musha, says I, it's a 
terrible sight, 
What a 
spal peen was I 
to come here to fight, 
I've left dear old Ireland to conic here to die, 
Where I'll get my throat cut like a 
pig in a 
stye. 
13nt if I 
get murd-red amidst all this strife, 
1 
shall never forget it, all the days of my life, 
How these Chinese bog- trotters may comrades have slain,— 
If I 
live to get back, I'll ne'er comae here again. 
Spoken — Rollo, Pat, says the Sergeant, you've lost your nose. 
By 
the powers, so I 
have, says I. 
Se I 
says to Teddy O'Flaherty. Come 
along wid me to find my nose. 
Turning to the right of the left hand 
side of the way, what should I 
see but a 
great devil of a 
doe- smelling 
at my illigaut nose. 
Drop that nose says I. Bow, wow, says he. Will 
you drop it, you nasty beast, says I. 
Faith he did drop it,—down his 
beastly throat. 
Shoot that dog. Teddy, says I, and Teddy shot him, 
and I 
took out my sword to cut him open to look for my nose, but the 
devil a 
bit ot nose could I 
see, for it had all melted away like a 
snow-
ball in a 
baker's oven. 
Just at this moment who should I 
see butt the 
-u 
ugly Chinaman that cat off my illigant nose. 
Nose for nose. says 1, so 
I 
cut off his nose, and stuck it on my face. 
Dello, Pat, says one of 
them when 1 
returned, that's not your nose. Never mind, honey, sure 
80filet Dose is better than no nose. I 
knows. Now you Must know this 
Chinaman has been ill the habit of taking snuff, and every now and 
then his nose would sneeze, and of course 1 
kept on sneezing until at 
last off it went, and by the hokey pokey it knocked the Sergeant's 
eye into the back of his head, and for that they poked me into the 
roundhouse, where the loss of my own beautiful snout weighed so 
heavy on my mind that it made me light-headed so they found I 
was 
no good in China, and they sent me back to ould Ireland which made 
me sing, 
Rub a 
dub, dub, & c.

THE OULD BOG HOLE. 
The pig is in the mire, and the cow is on the grass, 
And a

My mother likes her ducks, and the ducks like the drake, 
And sweet J 
tidy Flannigan I'd die for her sake. 
My Judy she's as fair as the flower on the lea, 
She's neat and complete from the neck to the knee; 
We met Cother night, our hearts to condole, 
And I 
sat Judy down by the old bog hole.

Arrah ! cushla mavourneen, will you marry me ? 
Arrah 
cushla mavourneen will you marry me ? 
Would you fancy the bouncing young Barney Magee ? 
Then Judy she blushed, and hung down her head, 
Saying, Barney, you blackguard, I'd like to get wed; 
But they say you're so rough, and you are such a 
rake—' 
'Don't believe it,' says J, ' for it's all a 
mistake ; 
To keep you genteel Phi work at my trade. 
I'll handle the shovel, the hook, and the spade, 
The turf to procure, which is better than coal, 
And I'll work to my knees in the old bog hole. 
Singing, cushla mavourneen. &c. 
Arrah 
give me your hand and consent just at once, 
Sure it's not every day you'll get such a

THE FINNIGINS. 
I'm a 
gay labouring youth, 
I 
was reared in the town of Drumshaukling; 
I'm a 
widower now in ni7.- youth— 
Since I 
buried one Molly Moglockling. 
I 
never was married but once in my life, 
I'll never commit such a 
sin again; 
I 
discovered when she was my w 
ife, 
She was fond of one Barney M'Fiunigin. 
Her father kept cabins of mud, 
Which I 
used to go out to admire sure ; 
They were built in the time of the flood, 
To keep the ancestors dry. sure ; 
When he found I 
had Molly bespoke. 
He first got quite fat, then looked again— 
In the struggle his gizzard he broke, 
From a 
stretch of Barney M'Finnigan. 
The corpse for convenience was put. 
In a 
friend's, that lived in a 
barn, sure— 
Some came walking on foot, 
And others came mounted on cars. sure. 
Aly wife sighed and sobbed for the loss, 
I 
put her twice out., she got in again; 
I 
gave her a 
soLzh-e estering clout, 
And I 
was attacked by the Finnigins. 
The corpse was upset in the bed, 
Fi ,thtinz commenced in a 
minute, sure. 
Devil a 
stick could we get 
'Till we tore otf the legs of the furniture. 
In showers the blood flew about, 
I 
was knocked oat but soon got knocked in again, 
I 
got a 
south- westering clout. 
Which laid we as fiat as M'Finnigin. 
Howlona I'd been dead. the Lord knows, 
I 
couldn't believe I 
was living, sure, 
I 
woke with the cramp in my toes. 
And found they were bound with a 
ribbon, sure. 
I 
opened my mouth for to spake. 
Bat the sheet was shoved up to my cheeks again, 
Says I— Molly I'm awake— says she hould your tongue, 
You're going to be buried with M'Fiunigin. 
MY 
wife she came home from the spree, 
Fall of whiskey from the burying sure ; 
She showed as much mercy to me. 
As a 
hungry man would a 
herring, sure. 
Until one pelt I 
gave her, 
Which made her to cry and to grin again, 
And in three months I 
oDened the grave, 
And threw her on the bones of old Finnigin.

THREE CHEERS FOR AN IRISH STEW. 
Ain—" The Red, White and Blue." 
Some like red herrings fresh from the ocean. 
Others dont on a 
bit of pigs- try, 
Some like ox-cheek I've a 
notion, 
Others live upon puddings and pie. 
In the soup-shops thousands assemble, 
And feed off a 
soup made of glue, 
But to me there's nothing resembles, 
A rale ould Irish stew. 
CHORUS. 
So good luck to an Irish stew, 
Three cheers for an Irish stew, 
To me there's nothing resembles, 
A rale ould Irish stew ! 
When the tater blight spread desolation, 
And threatened the stew to deform, 
Old Nick too threatened the nation, 
But he couldn't ride through the storm. 
For our soldiers and sailors already, 
To blazes his strong torts have blew 
For the thing to keep good man ready 
Is a 
good mess of Irish stew. 
So good luck to an Irish stew, 
Long life to an Irish stew, 
For a 
mess for all tars in all weathers 
Is a 
good ould Irish stew. 
Then the stew. boys, the stew, boys, bring hither, 
And feast till you're up to the brim, 
May the stew of St. Patrick ne'er wither, 
Nor the name of a 
Murphy grow dim ; 
May the spud and the union ne'er sever, 
When with good meat its brought up to view, 
May the nation and the peop:e get ever, 
A good ould Irish stew. 
Then three cheers for an Irish stew, 
Good luck to an Irish stew, 
May the Army and Navy get ever 
A rule ould Irish stew.

BRIAN BORU. 
0 ! Kilmurry M'Malion's place you would bless, 
Where whisky costs nothing, and buttermilk less ; 
And it's near to that same is a 
neat little spot 
Where my grandfather's grandfather dwelt in his cot. 
Whose children from Denis to Terence and Pat, 
Each stuck up a 
pig for a 
traveller's hat, 
For 'twas land of their own, where the Murphy's first grew 
And they all were descended from Brian Born. 
In our garden, to charm both the eye and the nose, 
Nature always seemed dressed in her bes' Sunday clothes. 
And so sweet was the smell of the whisky we brewed, 
That a 
pig in the parlor would sometimes intrude ! 
Then, at the Assizes, I've ta'en up a 
broom, 
To lather a 
cow from the counsellor's room, 
For we let oft a 
chamber, as other folks do, 
Who may not be descended from Brian Born. 
But sweetest of all was that beautiful maid, 
At the door of whose cabin I've ott left my spade! 
From the window she'd peep, like a 
sly fairy elf, 
Crying,—" Mister Kilrooney, get out wid yourself!" 
It you stop till I 
open the wicket, ins' dear, 
I'll be making a 
noise which nobody can hear, 
For I 
always behave as all gentlemen do, 
Who, like me. are descended from Brian Born.
