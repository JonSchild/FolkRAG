Wee Scotch Lassie. 
Words and Music by Edwin Joyce. 
Sung by Miss Verona Carroll. 
There is a 
bonnie wee Scotch lassie, 
Who's all the world to me; 
She's always in my memory, 
No matter where I 
be. 
She's fairer than the little flower 
That grows upon the lea, 
Is my bonnie, charming, 
Little wee Scotch lassie, 
Cnonrs. 
There's not a 
rose in Scotland, 
Or line to be seen 
Or daisy or a 
buttercup, 
That grow upon the green, 
For beauty they can't equal 
My bewitching little queen, 
She's my bonnie. charming, 
Little wee Scotch Lassie. 
Her voice is far more sweeter, 
Than the linnett's or the trush. 
The cuckoo or the nightingale 
That warble in the bush. 
With her sweet enchanting melody, 
She sets thim all to hush. 
Does my little charming 
Wee Scotch lassie. 
Chorus.

With a

remember so well, 
With our thoughts free from sorrow and pain, 
We would sit in the spring for to hear the birds sing, 
And to swing on the gate in the lane.

Miss Verona Carroll's Medley. 
All Brokeirp. 
RECITATION. 
As rendered by Edwin Joyce. 
New York is a 
queer and curious town, 
You'll see something new every time you go round, 
If you'll listen, I'll tell you about it to-night, 
Should you take anything wrong, that would not be right. 
Then I'd be all broke up. 
I 
went to a 
party down to Mike Duffy's place, 
When O'Gilligan struck Duffy a 
kick in the face; 
Says he, this is nothing, threw his bat in the fire, 
When Mike O'Brien jumped up and called him a 
liar. 
And broke him all up, 
Then they took to fighting, my blood it run cold, 
Duffy tried to stop it, bu the man was too old, 
They then fe 1 
on Casey, the poor man Witq blind, 
And they left not a 
stitch of his pantaloons behind. 
But broke him all up. 
The lunch-laden table that was standing near by, 
Got upset in the melee, which caused many a 
sigh, 
Will ye's ever stop that fighting, cried Dufty's brother-
in-law, 
When some one from behind banged him in the jaw, 
And broke him all up. 
The police came in, not a 
wo7:d then was said, 
O'Gilligan to hide he slipped under the bed, 
Paddy McDermott, a 
bad man was staving blind drunh. 
He sat down on the lid of O'Gilligan's trunk, 
And b 
oke it all up. 
The police to do them, duly arrested the whcle mob, 
DATy swore it was a 
put up job, 
They were brought before the magistrate next morning 
before nine. 
And now they are in prison serving out their time. 
And they are broke up. 
By Edwin Joyce. 
The stars shine on its pathway, 
Che trees bend back their leaves, 
To guide him to the meadows, 
Among the golden sheaves, 
Where stand I, longing, loving, 
And listen as I 
wait, 
To the nightingale while singing, 
Sweetly singing to its mate. 
Sin jug, singing, sweet singing. 
AIR — I'VE GOT A LETTER. 
I've got a 
letter from my gallent laddie, 
High, ho ! heigh, ho ! all I 
can't fray. 
Save that he mentions the ship's trim and ready, 
high, ho ! high, ho ! and names the day. 
Tells of the home he's made for me, 
'fells of the lassie he's lo;!ging to see, 
Oh! how 'twill cheer me my true love to see, 
High, ho! my laddie, high, ho ! to thee, 
High, ho! high, ho! high, ho! 
AIR —BLUE-EYED JENNIE. 
Oh! those happy days of yore. 
When my heart's unclouded glow, 
Shed its radiance o'er my pathway, 
Like the springtime fresh and bright, 
When I 
floated down life's stream, 
In a 
calm and pleasant dream, 
And the light that shone around me then, 
Was love's own light. 
When hand in hand I 
strayed, 
With a 
young and rosy maid, 
Through the hillside and the meadows, 
And the daisy covered glen, 
And with many a 
garland fair, 
I 
entwined her flowing hair, 
Sweet Jennie, blue-eyed Jelinie, I 
shall see ne'er again. 
I 
shall see ne'er again, I 
shall see ne'er again, 
Sweet Jennie, blue-eyed Jennie, I 
shall see ne'er

sung by Edwin Jc:. 
My name is Paddy Connor 
From the town of sweet Tralee 
There's a 
little girl that wears spit-c;i • 
,‘.111e%; ciazy gone on me. 
She sells buttermilk on Sunday, 
Cu the beach at Coney Isle; 
There's not a 
girl in all creation, 
Can compare with her in style, 
she's a 
darling, she's a 
dumpling, 
She's the diva on the mash, 
She's Mary Kelly's c 
usin, 
And her brother he slings hash, 
Her father grinds an organ, 
Thr, old woman drives a 
dray, 
While Bedelia's on the Bowery, 
Making mashes all the day. 
Her hair is led it hangs down her head, 
Like the tail of an old dead mule, 
She stops out all night, ge.s awful tight, 
She never went to school; 
She speaks seven different languages, 
Red Leary is her pard, 
She sleeps upon a 
clothes line 
That hung out in our back yard, 
She had a 
voice just like the whistle 
Of an engine off the track, 
She's freckled-fased, she's cross-eyed, 
She has bunions on her back, 
Her delicious breath is certain death 
To any one that's near, 
For most any day she can stow away 
Six kegs of lager beer. 
Chorus.-- Repeat first four lines.

Michael Murphy is my name, fm a

On my breast to wear a 
sun flower, and go to lecture 
every hour, 
That I've the asthetic make up of Oscar Wild. 
I 
do not understand the language in this land, 
The gang yell at me when I

They say there goes Barnum's ape, 
The girls are struck on my shape. 
For I'm Murphy the asthetic of the day. 
Cnouus. 
They say I'm the embodyment of grace, 
I 
ought to powder up my face, 
I

They are all struck on my sluggers, 
For I'm Murphy the asthetic of the day,

own, wants my mug upon the thro: 
Th,ey tell her that my whiskers is so grand, 
If she'd only see this mug this form she'd like to hu ;

fliE KIND LOVING FACES AT HOME. 
OPEN UP DEM DOORS. 
Written and sung by BEN D OW
E. 
L'm thinking to-day of the home of my youth, 
Near the brooklet that runs through the glade, 
rue green grassy lawn and the orchard so dear, 
WhPre oft in my childhood I've strayed ; 
'Tis many a 
year since those scenes I 
have left, 
Through far-distant countries to roam, 
Iut where'er I've wandered I've still longed to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
Cubans. 
And though we are parted, yet ever to me 
Sweet thoughts of my loved ones will come; 
And where'er .1 
wander I 
still long to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
aow oft in my dreams have my thoughts wandered back 
Po my mother, so kind and so true, 
,Vho whispered " Good by and God bless you, my boy," 
When I 
hid her and father adieu; 
E'en now in my fancy I 
once more can feel 
Her warm, loving kiss on ry brow, 
And sigh when i 
mink that ' tis naught but a 
dream, 
For I'm wandering far from her now. , 
And though, ete. 
iy nweet loving sister, with whom I 
have played 
So oft in our childhood at home, 
Has sent to me many a 
message of love, 
To cheer me wherever I 
roam; 
My father is waiting to greet me again, 
When my long weary journey is o'er, 
And soon we will meet round the old fireside, 
To part until death, never more.

LIMERICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
As sung by JOHNNY NOLAN. 
OH, Limerick is beautiful, as everybody knows, 
The river Shannon, full of fish, beside that city flows, 
'Tis not the river, nor the fish, that weighs upon my mine, 
Or with the town of Limerick have I 
any fault to find.

love is beautiful, as fair-eyed as the fawn; 
She lives in Garryowen, and is called the Colleen Raw.. 
And proudly as that river flows beside that blessed city,

Or Julius Ceasar, or the Lord Lieutenant of the land, 
I'd give my gold, my silver plate, likewise my army, 
The Home-guards, the Rifles and the Royal Artillery; 
I'd give the crown from off my head, my people on their knees 
I'd give my fleet of sailing ships upon the briny seas, 
A

If by my side just as a

VAN DIEMAN'S LAND. 
As Sung by W31 AtubB. 
Come all you lads of learning and rambling boys, bewave, 
Whenever you go a 
hunting bring your dogs gun and snare, 
For those lofty hills and valleys we have at our command. 
Not thinking of the last farewell going to Van Dienian's 
laud. 
There were three men from Galway town, Martin, Luke. 
and James, 
They were three loyal comrades their countrymen they 
formed, 
An it's there they were .
:::ansported by the keepers of thc. 
strand, 
And for seven long years transported, going te Tan Die-
man's laud. 
We had a 
true-love on bcazd the ship, Jaze Murphy wav 
ner name; 
And there she was transported for carrying on the game; 
The captain fell in love with her, and married her out of 
hand; 
0, she gave us the best cf treatment, going to Van Die. 
man's land. 
This land in port -.
7e went to. was on a 
foreign shore, 
9 
he negroes they surrotmded us, al,oca five hundred score ; 
Thy yoked us like hores an,l sold us out of hand, 
They yoked us to a 
trate, bravely, to plow on Van Die 
man's hind. 
itle houses they bu:lt for us, wcr made of mud and clay. 
The beds we had to he upon, WAS made of rotten bay, 
0, rotten hay for beds my boys, and slumber if you can ; 
Sure, they gave us the worst of treatment, all in Van Die 
mans land. 
One night. as I 
lay down to sivep, I 
had a 
pleasant dream, 
I 
dream &l 
that I 
was in old Ireland, down by a 
purling 
Stream ; 
I 
dream'd I 
was in old Ireland, my true-love at my com-
mand; 
But when I 
awoke my heart was broke, all in Van Die-
man's land.

THE IRISHMAN'S SHANTY. 
Dopied by permission of Firs PolkT13& Co., Music Publishers, 54G 
Broadway, New York. 
Did ye's ever go in 'till an Irishman's shanty? 
Och! b'ys, that's the place where the whiskey is plenty 
With his pipe in his mouth there sits Paddy so free. 
No King in his place is prouder than he! 
CHORUS. 
Arrah ! me honey, 
! 
Paddy's the boy. 
There's a. three-legged stool, with a 
table to match 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a 
latch, 
There's a 
nate fether mattrass all bustin' with straw, 
For want of a 
bedstead, it lies on the floor. 
Arrah! me honey, ktc-, 
There's snug little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of booths that was left when the shanty was built 
There's a 
thiee-cornered mirror hangs up on the wall. 
The divil a 
face him-s 
seen it all. 
Arrah! me honey , 
He has pigs in the sty, and a 
cow in the stable, 
And he feeds them on scraps from the ta5le ; 
They'd starve if confined, so they roam at their aise, 
And come into the shanty whinever they plaise. 
Arrah I 
me honey, &sc.

tt-) has three rooms in one—kitchen, bedroom and hall, 
And his chist is three wooden pegs in the wall; 
Two suits of owld clothes makes his wardrobe complete, 
One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street. 
Irrah! me honey, &c. 
He can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate, 
But is always continted with praties and mate ; 
He prefers them when cawld ( if he can't get them hot)„ 
And makes tay in a 
bowl when he can't get a 
pot. 
Arrah! me honey. 
There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys. 
Attonds to the shanty, the girls and the boys ; 
he brats ii 
thinks more of than gold that's refined), 
But Biddy's the jewel that's set in his mind. 
Arrah! me honey, A:c. 
The rich may divide their enjoyments alone, 
With those who have riches as great as their own; 
But Pat hangs the latch-string outside of his door, 
And will share his last cent with the needy and poor.

ME WEARING OF THE GREEN, 
As sung by Aracz BENNETT. 
Oh! Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to 
i•c,w 
on Irish ground; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
f 
or there's a 
bloody law agin, the wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with Napper Tandy and lie tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould. Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for •"Vc'earin' o' 
the Green !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear. is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still. tho' under foot ' tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure • dare 
not show ; • 
a c Then I 
will change the dolor I 
wear in my corbeen.; 
But ' till that day, please God, I'll stick to ‘• Wearin' o' the 
• 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
• 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
• 
be seen, 
tind where, thank God, we'll live and die, still 
Wearin' 
o' the Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.]

yi I 
HAVE you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to-day; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and gun; 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning, 
Their dear old land to see; 
And you and me, must ready be; 
To strike for liberty. 
CHORUS. 
Well tear that British banner down, 
And we'll every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore ; 
And the dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once lucre. 
And the tune we'll play, shall be Patrick's da3 
And we'll play it o'er and o'er, 
And scon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more. 
We'.! tear, &c 
We have begged of England long, my boys, 
But now we'll beg no more; 
No more like prowling bounds we'll crawl. 
Around our master's door. 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And soon we'll strike the blow; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low. 
We'll tear, cto.

Allow me to See you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN' BARRY at the Thw.4ty Coraique, New `tom 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man ; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude: 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes r 
And often decidedly " no;" 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way, 
I 
then think what fosis we men are I 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, ice. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
beautiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt m 
ant anything more. 
SPOKEN.— Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing nipper; 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature,

did, the reply from my love would be this 
You may look, etc

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the dose of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To ei:joy the evening breeze as it sWift sped thro' the trees, 
Av wa„ i 
the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying 
Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
"'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each, 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout ,^ 4 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"To the demagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
sa). 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain! 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
Per, supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
Lc took it from the :telly.) giro the Door! 
• 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres— when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please: 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night„ 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

Your sweet lips, my Annie.

Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whispering softly " I'll be thine,"

GIVE BREAD TO THE POOR. 
),_s sung .yiti .. inlendous success at the New National Theatha, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of Lc e, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of the many poor families who had nothing in store. 
Till a 
cry came from Hoaven, " Give bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart. the New York millionaire, 
Who some time agiy sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving b 
e
.ad to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' ho has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot. g:tve his office for peace, 
While the Bads, in the White House, they sat at their ems. 
In -ale town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering wiis grttt with hunger and we; 
With his shirt sleeves 
like old Jackson at war, 
Stood Governor Wade 1•L•ts,"•••P'464 giving bread to the poor.

With beaming smite our time beguile, 
We are alwas blythe and gay.

For it wIll make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it vill Mock you, 
And whirl and dance lihe mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the ides, 
The rays of morning light.

III 
the wager, will any one pay, 
1.11 bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
bachelors say th ey 
shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find 
Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
t)r a 
sirl who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
['ha' from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thi n ', of 
the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll het you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle don n 
to a 
can 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't._ 
Some igngrant croakers wear visages long, 
Will You be: me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement i: wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
.-Nboye human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will You bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'-tht-walk. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars Jie don't. 
So all you Young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse. 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam,

Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we

'Twas in the golden summer days

In every shady nook. 
But sweetr far than songs of birds 
The gentle voice that fell,

The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow.

There's a

From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
Fro m  iho rich which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling. sighing. 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CHORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free nod will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill: 
Truth makes the man. 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Ever grinding. down their wages. 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
WhilV you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat.

LITTLE DARLING, DO YOU LOVE ME? 
Written and sung by 13Es DODGE, 
Little darling, do yon love rue, 
Will you ever care for me? 
While far from you I 
am wandering, 
O'er life's dark and stormy sea; 
Far I 
cherish you so fondly, 
And my heart will e'er be true, 
And in time I'll gladly hasten 
Back again to home and you. 
Cuorcus. 
Little darling, do you love me? 
Will you ever care for me, 
While far from you I 
am wandering, 
O'er life's dark and stormy sea? 
Little darling do you miss me 
As away from you I 
roam? 
Will you greet me with a 
welcome 
When we meet again at home? 
Shall I 
feel your hand's warm presaink 
See your bright and happy smile, 
And, far better, hear you whisper--
" 
I 
have loved you all the while!'

And there she promised to be mine, where the

I 
often met her after, 
Down by that running stream, 
And oh! such tales of love 
I'd tell to my young lovely queen, 
On every moonlight evening, 
For a

And oh! the happy nights we spent,

THE MODERN TRAMP. 
Written and composed by IIAanY WHALING,Yocal Comedian and 
Author at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
You chaps that's been toiling and slaving all day, 
For a 
moment or two lend an ear; 
And gaze on a ' Tramp" that's jolly hard up, 
And has not worked for many a.year ; 
All sorts of games in this world I 
have tried, 
To get rich, you will please understand ; 
I've sold soap for pills, and salve to cure corns, 
-4 
And I 
once led a 
temperance band. 
C./Lorne—Then please not to smile, but list to my tale, 
With sorrow' I'll pierce your heirts through ; 
Then assist if you can a 
poor tramp out of work; 
And doesn't want any to do. 
I've beat the big drum outside of a 
show, 
I 
next Liked the thimble and pea; 
But for that I 
got nailed, and got three months in jail, 
And of course that didn't suit me: 
I 
next stole a 
child, which I 
hugged in my arms, 
And for charity knocked at each door; 
And to soften their hearts I'd stick pins in the kid, 
Which made the dear baby to roar. 
C'' lor 
I 
soon found it out that game wouldn't pay, 
For the child could eat more than I 
got; 
So I 
turned it up and resolved on a 
plan, 
And blind beggar I 
tried like a 
shot; 
With a 
poodle lnd string and a 
card on my breast, 
Round every street I 
would jog; . 
But because Pd no license a 
policeman came up, 
And quietly walked off with my dog. 
C1iors. 
It's tune to be going, I'm getting quite dry, 
And I 
haven't got price of a 
gill; 
So you that have got any " coin " to spare, 
Please bestow it upon Lazy Bill; 
There's an old woman coming I'll see if she'll give 
To a 
cripple that's had with the cramp; 
A 
coin for my lodg,ings. I 
mean for a 
drink, 
For the workhouse jiHt suits this old tramp

PROVE YOURSELF THE POOR MAN'S 
FRIEND, INDEED. 
Written and composed by HARRY KEARNEY, and 
espectfully 
dedicated to HARRY W OODSON. 
There are many tip' and downs in this rugged road of life, 
And sad sufferirrgs some folks undergo, 
Through trouble, foil and sorrow, with bitter care and strife; 
Those who've vealth, -melt sufferings do not know. 
When you see a 
poor man starving, oh, help him if you can! 
And try and be a 
friend to those in need. 
Who can tell but you some day 'nay need a 
helping hand, 
Then prove yourself the poor luau's friend, indeed. 
(
lite tics. 
But this maxim is the best, help the poor man in distress. 
No matter what his station or his creed, 
For its always best you'll find to the poor man to be kind. 
So prove yourself tire poor man's friend in deed. 
Capitalists, now say that one dollar for each day, 
Is enough to buy a 
laboring man his bread; 
But on that they car toot live, wages higher they must Om 
For hunger's bitter pangs we all do dread. 
Now our preachers say the same, and for them it is a 
shame, 
In the pulpit, they say help those who .need, 
With their thousands every year, if they'd give a 
little freer 
They'd prove themselves the poor man's friend, indeed. 
There are many men now gone who helped those forlorn, 
And the poor man prays for them both night and day, 
And there's many now that's worse, that gets the poor 
man's curse. 
While their prayers are for better, now I 
say, 
Jim Fisk so good and true, on the poor man did bestow, 
Aioaf of bread to those who most did need; 
And though Tweed now lies in jail, wetell of himtbe804116

and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position eartain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing" is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under • 
standing.

want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difii• 
deaaanatoo fearful of a 
repulse, to venture, upon asking the momentous 
queation. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
reedit of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be. 
adopted by the parties to the came as their own, tmlass it accords with 
the state of their affections which fact makes a 
further explanation ma 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
