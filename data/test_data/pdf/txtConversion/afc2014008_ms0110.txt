 Old ways participant numbers
 
The situation seems to me a trifle c
lr.i
.m.
 Here are the details.
 
PAKISTAN
 19 participants invited  (
2 are from D
.C.  so the budget appears ok)
 
However, Nazir desperately wants 23.
 
INDIA
 20 invited  (
3 are from D.C. and Shirley has okayed the budget.
 
However, Nazir feels his program has been compromised by the
 
cut.
 If he can get India to bring along 2 bhajan instrumentalists
 
he can stand it, but he really wants his original number: 23
 
PORTUGAL
 20 invited  (
complicated deal with Hartford (
7roup).
 This program
 
is about $800 short now, and should really be raised to 22.
 
JAPAN
 18 invited  (
will bus in additional Bon dancers).
 Budget okay.
 
ISRAEL
 This is an extremely complex presentation involving part-time, one
 
day etc. participants and is $1600 over budget.
 If the choir
 
drops out,  (
they need only transportation at $900), Shirley
 
thinks she can handle the excess.
 
IRELAND
 20 have already been invited before cut was known.
 Nothing to be
 
done about it.
 
FRANCE
 19 have already been invited; ditto.
 
BRITAIN
 12 have been invited; Suzie is holding to 16 but even so, an addi-
tional '
2 slots are Beeded to cover room/board and spending money
 
for the 5 Canadian participants.
 The ideal here would be 19.
 
SPAIN
 25 really should come since this  I

 Anna wants to bri m
. 22 from '
New York; with the
 
two vigils (if they come) and the 4 tucrto 1
,icans,  this
 
would mean we need 28.(Anna can cut if necessary).
 
C
1;I:I:CE
 Sam has recommended 23.
 official invitations not yet sent; Sam
 
feels really badly about thiK  any cut.
 
ITALY
 
EGYPT
 
Again, a program without a foreirn component probably.
 Anna can
 
bring it in without the hupl ,cts but x
,:
ants them and  feels the ,
, 
would provide a really important cor
.ponent.
 Wi t h o uL  I

she needs 25; with,  it would be 31.

that Diaspora could help.

I think we may lose out entirely on our plan to beef up the main
 
stage if we don't make somebody or bodies responsible for planning and
 
inviting the folks.
 
I
'd recommend a committee of two -- Nick and Frank -- to pass
 
around the accompanying memo and come up with an overall plan to
 
be approved by Ralph and me.
 Tom is pretty busy with the main stage
 
cross-cultural programs right now, and I think this should be
 
gotten onto right away or we won't be able to reach such performers
 
as the enclosed list in time.
 
Am I correct in my understanding that the total budget consists
 
of $6,000 from the Musicians Union Trust Fund and $3500 from Nick's
 
old salary business?  Am I also correct in assuming that all such
 
performers should be paid union scale?

 DATE:

SUBJECT:
 Main Stage
 
During the last four weeks of the Festival when Regional will be
 
closed down and thus a smaller pool of musicians available for
 
main stage programming, we have agreed to invite a few performers
 
each week to give regularly scheduled concerts on the main stage.
 
This would seem a good time to invite as many as we can of those
 
performers whose contributions to traditional music we should
 
like to honor but who may not have been invited during regular
 
programming weeks.
 The amount of money we have to spend here
 
allows for only three or so performers per week; they should be
 
strong musicians, therefore, capable of carrying an hour's pro-
gram perhaps twice a day.
 Since some of the funds being used
 
here are Musicians Union moneys, we must pay union rates  (
$83.00
 
per day)  and thus we might be able to obtain performers who
 
could not come at the usual Festival rates.
 
We solicit the suggestions of all programs;  some of the names
 
suggested so far are:
 
Lightning Hopkins
 
Almeda Riddle
 
Sonny Terry
 
Brownie McGhee
 
Jimmy Driftwood
 
Dixie Hummingbirds
 
etc.
 
Please send any names you'd suggest to
 
We should start firming this up soon, as such folks as the above
 
are pretty busy and should be invited at once.

DATE:
 4 May 1976
 
In view of its long - standing public commitments the Smithsonian
 
Institution will keep all its facilities,  including the Festival
 
of American Folklife,  open on Monday,  July 5th.
 The Institution
 
administrators responsible for DPA and overall Bicentennial programs
 
have instructed Festival Directors to run a normal five day week
 
that week;  thus we will open a day late -- Thursday July 1.
 
The schedule for the two week period affected is thus as
 
follows:
 
Monday June 28

A number of schedule adjustments will be necessary.
 
1
.
 Contracts with concessionaires for the July 1 - 5 week
 
must be reset to conform to those dates.
 
2
.
 With the exception of foreign groups, participants for
 
week three  (
July 1 - 5
)  should be brought in a day later than normal;
 
this will be Tuesday, June 29 for most programs.
 They must also be
 
asked to stay on through July 5
.
 
3
.
 As many participants as possible from week three
 
should be moved out Monday night  (
July 5
)  so as to clear dormitory
 
rooms for the incoming participants for week four.
 We shall try to
 
terminate afternoon programs at 4:00 rather than 5:00 to facilitate
 
arrangements for early departures that evening.
 
4
.
 As many participants as possible for week 4 should
 
come in Tuesday morning July 6 rather than the evening before in
 
order to minimize overlap at Georgetown.
 
5
.
 Each program should scrutinize its staffing pattern
 
closely for that weekend.
 We will not only be dealing with massive
 
�
 •
 •
 
crowds that weekend but with considerable confusion in Georgetown
 
July 5th and 6th and only one down day in which to clean up the mall
 
and reset the Festival for the fourth week.
 It is worth noting
 
also that traffic will undoubtedly be extremely heavy that weekend so
 
that extra time should be allowed to get participants to and from
 
airports, railroad stations and the like.
 
6
.
 The Housing Coordinator should attempt to arrange
 
with Georgetown for extra rooms for Sunday (July 5
)  and Monday
 
(July 6
).
 
7
.
 Program Coordinators are urged to keep things as
 
simple as possible that weekend.
 The fewer things that have to
 
be moved on and off the Festival site on our single down day, July
 
6, the better.
 
8.
 Diplomatic walk-throughs and attendant parking re-
servations will have to be changed from Wednesday to Thursday
 
during this week and during the week of Labor Day  (
see last para-
graph).
 Accordingly the special day for the handicapped  (now
 
Thursday) must be shifted to Friday, those two weeks only.
 
9
.
 Travel Coordinators and Housing Coordinators are
 
likewise urged to keep the Georgetown staff informed as early as
 
possible about travel schedules and arrival and departure times.
 
After a quick discussion with Program Coordinators, we have
 
come up with the following tentative schedule:
 
Sunday July 4
 Arriving
 Portuguese contingent
 25
 
Portuguese Canadians
 4
 
Monday July 5
 Arriving
 British contingent
 25
 
British domestic
 16

Leaving

Since this is the middle of a two-week slot in ADAG, there will
 
hopefully be relatively little movement either in or out.
 (
Schedule
 
to come in later.)

The Administration of the Division .
is anxious to be of help to
 
all programs in working out the logisLics of this operaLi.on.
 The
 
main requirement, we suggest,  is to have a two-way information flow
 
between all concerned.
 
Finally,  the last week of the Festival will also run in the
 
above pattern - from Thursday through Monday  (Labor Day).
 This
 
should not raise any particular logistical problems but programs
 
are urged to make sure participants are invited one day later
 
than the usual schedule.

MEMORANDUM
 
TO
 Jim Morris
 
FROM
 Ralph,  Bob and Bess
 DATE:
 3 May 1976
 
SUBJECT:
 Need for Improved Communications Between DPA Administration
 
and FAF Administration.
 
Although there has been recently some measure of consultation
 
and information exchange between FAF administrators and DPA admini-
stration, we think considerable improvement is desirable.
 For
 
example,  you,  Jim,  learned on Friday afternoon that the money for
 
Native Americans we had all been waiting to hear about would not
 
be forthcoming from DOL;  you then left for two days without informing
 
Ralph, who was available in the office at the time.
 As a consequence
 
we knew nothing of this sobering development until Mr.  Kennedy from
 
Senator Hatfield's office informed Ralph on Monday morning,  and
 
began discussions of the Supplemental, preparations for which are
 
presumably now in progress.
 One could shrug this example off if
 
its effect were not being aggravated by others which point to
 
a possibly serious separation between these two operations of DPA
 
at precisely the time when,  to ensure the success of the Festival,
 
we most need to be in harness together.
 
We are particularly concerned about the processes of funding
 
and allocation of funds evolving out of the Supplemental appropri-
ation for the Festival,  should that be forthcoming.
 We have,  as
 
you know,  a number of perceived but as yet unbudgeted needs that
 
should be addressed and funded as soon as any extra funds stemming
 
from the Supplemental can be identified.
 For that and other reasons,
 
we would very much appreciate being apprised of on-going develop-
ments with the Supplemental as they develop,  so that we can relate
 
any appropriated funds to the priorities specified in the Supple-
mental request as well as to our other needs indicated above.
 Per-
haps the best way to ensure that we all remain on top of what we
 
need to know in order to function effectively would be to begin
 
(renew?)  a series of weekly meetings every Monday morning - or even
 
daily meetings if things are moving that swiftly - at which we
 
three and appropriate members of the DPA administrative unit,  in-
cluding yourself, can ask and answer questions,  exchange information,
 
and generally keep everyone duly informed of what any of the others
 
may know.
 We find the prospect of yet more meetings a wearisome
 
one, but at the moment cannot think of an equally effective alter-
native.
 We would appreciate your response to this ASAP.

should be made to have the release returned to u
s before travel
 
commences; there will  be cases where we can not get a r
elease s
igned  
by that t
ime, but participants s
hould know (
and understand)  that
 
they will be r
equired to s
ign one before they can be paid. We can
 
not spring t
his on someone as they arrive on the Mall, because
 
by then i
t will  be too l
ate to solve t
he problem.
 
HANDLING AND STORAGE OF RELEASES
 
Participant coordinators will  collect s
igned r
eleases from
 
participants. They will  transmit them to the accounting staff a
long
 
w
ith t
he superforms. The accounting staff will  f
ile the releases
 
after processing. After the Festival, the r
eleases will  be g
iven
 
to DPA for permanent f
iling.

EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE R

I
n extremely special c
ircumstances, we have some f
lexibility
 
i
n a
llowing exceptions t
o or modifications of t
he r
elease r
equirement.
 
I

generated at t
he Festival.  I
t would be i
mpossible t
o make u
se of
 
t
hese materials i
f we h
ad a hundred d
ifferent categories of permissions.
 
Other consideration s
uch a
s l

amifications, contractual problems,
 
publicity problems, and d
isruptions of accounting procedures make i
t
 
i
mportant t
o have t
he s
ame r
elease from a
ll participants. We do,
 
however, r
ecognize that some participants who are crucial  to programs'
 
p
lans may have some v
alid objections  (
religi0

o
 
s
igning t
his r
elease. Therefore,  i

,--of c
ircumstances,  i
t
 
may be possible t
o arrange p
ayment to a participant.!,r

I
-
i
 
b
.  Rain Days.  I
n Ralph's memo to you of April 6 a number of
 
possibilities were l
imned out, the choice and cost of which
 
cannot be e
stimated until you indicate which of these you
 
approve.  As for Rain Contingency Funds, there are none
 
available that we are aware of unless we are depending upon
 
the General Festival Contingency fund.
 
2 . Possible Shortfalls. As noted above, we cannot be sure what
 
the actual shortfall will be, but if we accept the shaky
 
assumption that it turns out to be as much as $
500,000, we
 
are in real trouble.
 
The gaping hole, of c
ourse, i
s presently in Native Americans,
 
precisely the program that represents the maximum political and moral
 
l
iability to us should it be inadequately supported.  But f
illing
 
that hole at this late date by reallocating money within Festival
 
programs, while at the same time maintaining acceptable levels of
 
program activity and a minimum level of staff morale poses a real
 
problem f
or us.
 
A fallback position that would free up $
500,000 i
s, of course,
 
not impossible to conceive.  You would appear t
o have eliminated
 
the possibility of reducing African Diaspora and Old Ways t
o ten
 
weeks (
a move that, however undesirable would free up roughly
 
$
225,000 - if we are not as yet locked into a guarantee of 8
00 occu-
pancy for e
leven or twelve weeks at Georgetown, and the necessary
 
rescheduling of c
ountries can be effected); the only other productive
 
fallback procedure i
s reduction in the number of participants.  Even
 
if we opt for reducing AD and OWNW to ten weeks, thus freeing up
 
$
225,000, we would s
till need $
275,000 more, which, roughly calculated,
 
could be achieved by e
liminating between 430 and 460 domestic parti-
c
ipants from Festival programs.  This could be accomplished by
 
reducing African Diaspora domestic participation from 7
0 to 60
 
(
for a total of 1
10 participants at any given time), Native Americans
 
from 1
00 t
o 8
5, Regional America from 1
00 to 8
5, and Old Ways in the
 
New World from 4
6 to 4
0 (
for a total of 9
0 participants at any given
 
t
ime).  I
f $
225,000 i
s not realized by cancelling the last two
 
weeks of African Diaspora and Old Ways, the number of participants
 
e
liminated above would have to be increased by 8
00.
 
Even the l
esser of these two possible figures represents a re-
duction in the l
evel of program activity that we cannot responsibly
 
and therefore do not recommend.  I
t would mean reducing the Old Ways
 
in the New World presence by 1
0%, Regional America's and Native
 
Americans' by 1
5%, and African Diaspora's by 2
7% below the l
evel
 
of program activity maintained in 1
975; and that in the Bicentennial
 
summer when public attendance, although inestimable at the moment,
 
will be vastly increased and public expectations much higher! I
t may
 
not be unthinkable, but we strongly recommend against i
t.
 
i
 
That brings us back t
o the beginning, the need t
o r
aise an
 
a
bsolute minimum of $
275,000 (
if we decide and can manage t
o
 
cancel the l
ast two weeks of O
ld Ways and African D
iaspora
 
programming) or a s
till probably minimal $
500,000 should t
he
 
twelve week s
chedule be maintained.  We s
imply d
o not know
 
where that money i
s t
o be f
ound, and recommend t
hat you d
iscuss
 
with Julian reconsideration of t
he Smithsonian I
nstitution's
 
position in regard t
o the supplemental appropriation suggested
 
by Dan Beard t
o John Jameson in March of this year.

We have, t

our a
reas of possible shortfall.
 
These are:
 
A
.  Native Americans.  I
t a
ppears t
hat only the EDA money
 
will f
inally come t
hrough.  The previous a
llocation t
o
 
this program was $
483,000.  We can e
xpect $ 6
6,000 f
rom
 
EDA, providing us with $
549,000 t
otal funds.  As we know
 
the funds t
o be raised were a key a
ssumption i
n our Janu-
ary Budget.  I
 need a f
allback position on this program
 
ASAP based on the new a
ssumption of a $
500,000 s
hortfall.
 
B
.  Working Americans.  I am r
easonably c
onfident t
hat the
 
Department of Labor will honor our r
equest f
or $
280,000.
 
Should this request be denied, my a
ssumption r
emains a

- that we c
ould not produce t

Response  to  post-Bicentennial  planning memo
 
It  is  difficult  to  think  coherently  and  in  any  detail
 
about  future  plans when  in  the  final  stages  of  Bicentennial
 
Festival  preparation,  so  this will be brief.
 
The  Festival  operation  suffers  overall,  in my view,  from
 
the  inevitable  pressures  of  a performance-centered  perspective.
 
We  put  on  an  event  and  then  go  home,  taking  our  information,
 
scholarship  and  experience with  us.
 Documentation,  publication
 
and  other normal  scholarly/educational pursuits  are  secondary
 
issues  to  be  addressed  at  some  later  time.
 Community  outreach
 
is  considered  primarily  in  terms  of  touring  performances.
 
In planning  for  the  future,  I urge  that  the  interests  of
 
the  scholarly  community,  the  concerns  of  the American  public
 
who  cannot  come  to Washington  every  summer  and  the needs  of  the
 
folk artists  themselves  be  taken  into  account.
 Publications
 
(films  and  recordings  as well  as  articles,  pamphlets  and
 
books)  should  be  included  in  all  budgets  both  in  terms  of money
 
and  time.
 Research  should  center  in  the  folk  communities  and
 
be more  than  a simple  talent  scout  by  a roving  folklorist.
 
I really  see no  particular  social,  cultural  or  educational
 
gain  in  the  plan  to  put  on a shorter version  of  the  1976  Festival
 
in  1977.
 Though  I am a strong  proponent  of  the  cultural
 
importance  of  Festivals,  I am struck by  the  number  of  projects
 
other  than  Festivals  or,  indeed,  other  than  performances which
 
are  appropriate  to  Smithsonian  concerns  and which  lie  immediately
 
to  hand.
 I remind  you  of  Susan Kalcik's memorandum on  the  need
 
for  an  ethnic  cultural  information  center,  the various  post-
Festival  publication proposals.
 An  enormous  amount  of  research
 
has  been  compiled  here  during  the  past  ten year's work;  it would
 
be  irresponsible not  to make  it  available  to  the  larger  community.
 
I should  like  to  see  Smithsonian  folkloric  staff  function  for
 
the next  year  in  terms  of  research write-ups  of various  kinds
 
as  well  as  acting  as  advisors  on  the  living museum  concept  across
 
the  country.
 Such  activities  could  be  certainly  combined with
 
a small  festival  but  would  operate more  productively without
 
any performance  responsibilities.
 
Should  the  Executive  Committee  approve  the  funding  and
 
staffing necessary  to  the  production  of  a short  Festival  around
 
a single  theme  in  1977  or  1978,  I shall  be  glad  to  submit  some
 
specific  program  ideas  for your  consideration.

MEMORANDUM
 
April 12,  1976
 
TO
 Jim Morris
 
FROM
 Ralph Rinzle
 
SUBJECT:
 Your April 9 memo:
 "Mini-Festivals - Post
 
Bicentennial Plans"
 
In response to your request for comments to add to
 
the original report prepared in the Spring of 1975 as an
 
answer to Mr. Ripley's memo of July,  1974, I have summed
 
up my own thoughts on the problem as posed by Mr. Ripley
 
almost two years ago.
 My thinking on this subject
 
developed as a result of a meeting with Mr. Ripley on
 
June 9,  1975, in which we discussed his memo on the
 
future of theEbstival.
 At that meeting, Mr.  Ripley
 
acknowledged that the future of the Festival alone was
 
perhaps less significant than the overriding question of
 
how the Institution will continue to serve the constituencies
 
now served by the Festival?  In the ten months that have
 
passed since that discussion,  I have considered this question
 
and offer the following observations and suggestions.
 
The Festival and, indeed,  the field of folklore and
 
folklife studies serve three constituencies:
 
a
.
 Academics who study folklife and use the folklife
 
studies of other academics.
 
b.
 The bearers of folklore traditions and the folk
 
communities they live in.
 
C
.
 The American public and their governmental
 
representatives who can be educated and invigorated
 
through exposure to folkloric materials,  and who
 
ultimately support much of folkloric research and
 
presentations through public funding.
 
Any Smithsonian folklife program must be responsive
 
to all three constituencies:
 
a
.
 Academics should be addressed in ways that speak to
 
the questions raised by their particular analytic

paradigms:
 the transmission of folklore over time
 
and space,  the dynamic of the performance inter-
action,  the cultural significance of folklore.
 
b.
 Bearers of tradition and their communities should
 
be given recognition as custodians of a national
 
cultural asset.
 They should be encouraged to
 
retain and nurture their traditions as part of a
 
wider program of cultural preservation.
 
C.
 The American public should be served by making
 
folklore materials available in forms that are
 
accessible to the non-specialist -- recordings,
 
publications, performances.
 Folklore should
 
serve the goal of continuing cultural education.
 
The above position may be termed the "applied folklore"
 
position.
 It is held by a significant number of folklorists,
 
in agreement with their social science colleagues in other
 
disciplines -- anthropology,  sociology,  linguistics --
who also hold that science must serve and be responsible to
 
wider constituencies than the academic community alone. When
 
I consider the demonstrable success that the Smithsonian's
 
folklife programs have hadwitn the constituencies mentioned
 
above over the past ten years,  I think the Smithsonian should
 
consider establishing folklore as a separate discipline with
 
its own programs alongside the related fields of musicology,
 
anthropology and history.
 
A program responsive to Smithsonian interest would
 
include:
 
folklore museum training
 
research
 
publication of books, pamphlets, recordings
 
preservation both in permanent exhibitions and in
 
live performance by folk artists and craftsmen
 
consultation, within the U.S,  as well as abroad,  on
 
our newly developed living museum presentation techniques
 
carriers of folk culture
 
for
 
L
 
-3-
Such training,  research and publication would guide
 
museum facilities elsewhere in creative and scientifically
 
sound methods of presenting folk-oriented materials,  thus
 
enhancing the present program of Smithsonian outreach.
 
Looking beyond this Summer's Festival,  it seems wise to
 
take stock of our position and consider an organizational
 
structure which would serve the interests of the Festival
 
constituencies and those of the Institution in general.
 
Appropriately, we should recognize the important innovative
 
role the Festival has played and should disseminate the
 
ten years'  knowledge we have gained.
 This can be accomplished
 
through museum training programs, publications and consultation
 
services which the Smithsonian can offer to other U.S.  and
 
foreign institutions and communities concerned with applied
 
folklore.
 We feel a responsibility to focus on theoretical
 
educational and research problems with relatively less
 
emphasis on performance alone.
 It is therefore reasonable to
 
consider a folklife program alongside similar Smithsonian
 
programs concerned with both performance and research.
 The
 
Division of Musical Instruments is one such model,  the
 
Anthropology Film Center and the Research Institute on
 
Immigration and Ethnic Studies are others.
 
a.
 Like Musical Instruments the Folklife Program is
 
committed to performances,•all of which are directed
 
by scholars and produced by DPA.
 Unlike Musical
 
Instruments, however,  it neither has nor depends upon
 
a permanent collection of objects.
 
b.
 Like the Film Center,the Folklife Program
 
to the problems of accurate documentation
 
ethnography in the areas of expressive performance
 
and vanishing technologies.  .
 
C.
 The common interests of folklife scholars and
 
Dr.  Bryce-Laporte's office are evident.
 
The Executive Committee should consider these points
 
when reviewing post-Bicentennial plans.
 A folklife program
 
should be located either as a separate entity in the Office
 
of the Assistant Secretary for Public Service or as a part
 
of the Center for the Study of Man.
 Given the strong
 
emphasis on applied cultural studies, the service functions
 
provided by the program are consonant with its placement
 
is committed
 
and salvage

under either administrative structure.
 Its social science
 
orientation would perhaps suggest the Center as the more
 
appropriate locus.
 
Regarding the second question in your April 9th memo,
 
the mini-festival plan requires considerable programmatic
 
refinement as well as budget and staff clarification.
 I
 
look forward to an opportunity to discuss these matters with
 
Bob and Bess in order to provide a careful response for your
 
consideration.
 However, your memo was received this morning
 
and the matter cannot be handled overnight in addition to the
 
budget questions posed in your Festival cut-back memo of
 
April 9th which was also received this morning and also
 
requires a reply tomorrow.
 I am not convinced that the
 
best interests of all involved would be served by four small
 
Festivals in  177 based on fieldwork done in  176, but we
 
shall review the matter and respond as soon as possible.

SUBJECT:  Your memo of April 9 re "Mini-Festivals -
- Post
 
Bicentennial P
lans"
 
Let me address myself f
irst to Ralph's response to your memo
 
which I
 have just read.  With minor exceptions here and there, I
 
am i
n substantial agreement with his position.  I should l
ike to
 
add that correlated with ;
.he rationale f
or his suggestion that
 
the Smithsonian's f
olklife programs might be more appropriately
 
l
ocated outside the Division of Performing Arts i
s the regrettable
 
but undeniable fact that f
or at l
east the two and a half years
 
I have spent with the Division there has been a serious bifurcation
 
between the theatrically oriented Administrative/Operations staff
 
of the Division of Performing Arts and the Administrative/Program
 
Staff of the Festival of American Folklife (
to date the Smithsonian
 
I
nstitution's principal f
olklife program).  You know how familiar
 
I am with this s
ituation '
ample documentation of which I
 can pro-
vide, dating back to November, 1973), a-i
d I do not think i
t
 
necessary to present any details or my full analysis of the
 
problem here.  I
t should be sufficient t
o say that I think the
 
gap i
s widening, that i
ts principal cause i
s a difference i
n
 
value systems (
both legitimate in themselves but unfortunately
 
opposed), and that i
ts consequences have been, are, and will
 
probably c
ontinue t
o be conflict, dysfunction and demoralization.
 
If i
t i
s organizationally possible, therefore (
and this I
 have no
 
way of knowing), I think the suggestion that f
olklife programs
 
be relocated within the Institution makes a l
ot of sense.  I
t
 
would reduce if not eliminate the present tension, but in no way
 
preclude cooperation with the Division of Performing Arts in the
 
production of f
estivals and other presentations of living culture.
 
As f
or post-Bicentennial plans, I agree that discussion of
 
them (
beyond what resulted in our March, 1
975, response to Mr.
 
Ripley's memo of July 1
0, 1974) has been cursory at best.  I
t
 
i
s difficult t
o judge whether any folklife program activity would
 
be appropriate when one has no knowledge of what the budget and
 
s
taff chart f
or folklife programs may be.  I have implicitly
 
and explicitly requested such i
nformation on a number of occasions
 
(
in 1
976 memos dated February 2
3, March 1
5, March 1
7, and March
 
3
0, respectively), but beyond the indications i

RE:  Mini-Festivals -
- Post Bicentennial Plans
 
I have been asked to attend the Executive Committee Meeting on
 
April 14, at which time a d
iscussion of the Post-Bicentennial Mini-
Fbstivals is s
cheduled.  I think Ralph s
hould join me for this
 
meeting.
 
The general basis for the d
iscussion will be the attached report
 
which was s
ubmitted last year and which was prepared with your
 
(Ralph and Bob's) collaboration.
 
As yoti know, d
iscussions of these plans have been rather cursory,
 
but when aske  what I would recommend regarding an operational plan,
 
I have suggested that the s
ummer of 1977 might s
ee a vastly reduced
 
Festival with the majority of the participants drawn from the 1976
 
f
ield work:  This would allow for the 1978 plans to be developed
 
starting in the fall of 1976 and thus allow sane twenty months for
 
planning, research and development of the new Mini-Festivals concept
 
before they were unveiled.
 
If you have any comments to add to the original report, or to the
 
above ideas about an operational plan, I would appreciate hearing from
 
you by C
.O.B. Tuesday, April 13.

Rain site for Transportation
 
DATE:  March 15, 1976
 
Should there be rain for a number of days and the site be
 
closed down completely, prohibiting even the use of the Dome narra-
tive center, the following locations would be suitable and interesting
 
rain-sites:  the Hall of Transportation in MHT, auditoriums in DOL
 
or DOT, a finished but not-yet-in-service Mecro Stop.
 
This last suggestion might work for other Festival programs
 
as well.  Metro is anxious for public exposure that portrays their
 
facilities as friendly, healthful environments.  They have held
 
other sorts of concerts there, I am told.  The person at Metro
 
to contact is Cody Pfanstiel, their public affairs man.  Dick
 
L. has had some contact with him also.

FROM

DATE:
 March 8,  1976
 
Before departing on my long postponed vacation  (I shall be disporting
 
myself elsewhere from March 10 through March 21),  I shall again bring
 
up an issue which has been a central concern of mine since I began
 
with DPA.
 
I do not believe the Festival staffing pattern has sufficiently taken
 
into consideration the inflexibility of the academic year.
 To put
 
it bluntly, there are only two points during the summer and fall when
 
you can fire an academic:
 August 1 and January 1.
 To give an academic
 
a termination date of November 1 simply forces an early resignation if an
 
academic job becomes available.
 
In my view,  there will be a mass exodus of Festival staff during August.
 
This will include two categories:
 folklorists and other academic pro-
fessionals now on staff,  and -- an even more difficult issue -- the
 
many many temporary workers we hire each summer who are attending either
 
.
,
 high school or college.
 
I strongly urge the DPA undertake a re-examination of the termination
 
schedule to address these problems.
 Full-time academics,  wherever
 
possible,  should be kept on at least until January 1.
 The temporary
 
summer staff is a far more difficult issue;  as you may recall,  this
 
was my principal reason for supporting a cut in the overall Festival
 
length.
 At the least,  I suggest that those responsible for hiring
 
temporary personnel should enquire closely into whether or not the
 
individual applicant can stay on through September 6.
 Perhaps we
 
might also consider recruiting a special work =
force for the final
 
four or five weeks of the Festival.

"Old Ways in the New World"
 
Festival of American Folklife
 
INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE CONCESSIONAIRES  
The sale of items directly related to the traditions being presented
 
on the Mall enhances and prolongs the cultural experience for Festival
 
visitors.
 Items sold in the "Old Ways" area should be similar to:
 
a
.  those used in stage performances, such as small musical instrum-
ents, castanets, harmonicas, ankle bells;
 
b
.  those made by participating craftspersons, such as wood carvings,
 
painted eggs, woven or knit objects, straw objects, kites;
 
c
.  those used by participating craftspersons, such as supplies for
 
kite making, paper folding, weaving, calligraphy, small looms;
 
d
.  those used by participating cooks, such as unusual ingredients
 
and spices, special cooking utensils and tools, cookbooks com-
piled by an ethnic organization or written by a participant;
 
e
.  those described or explained in workshops, such as musical
 
instruments;
 
f
.  those in some way related to a specific celebration or event
 
taking place in the "Old Ways" area, such as pinatas, special
 
breads, henna, or related to many festive occasions in a given
 
culture, such as incense.
 
In addition, a few items for protection against the sun or heat may
 
be sold, such as paper parasols, fans, or head coverings which are charact-
eristic of a particular tradition.
 
Articles offered for sale must be approved as appropriate by the "Old
 
Ways" staff.
 This approval must be secured in advance through discussion
 
and confirmed in writing.
 
The Smithsonian cannot handle the sale of any item directly; everything
 
must he sold by private concessionaires who s
ign contr
.acLs which -
specify
 
the mutual obligations.
 The Smithsonian will provide the basic sales
 
facilities such as shelter, counters and display shelves or areas, storage
 
and security.
 This does not include cash registers which will be rented
 
through a central Smithsonian contractor.
 In return,  the concessionaire
 
will pay a percentage of gross sales to the Smithsonian.
 
T
 
T
.
L i
s desirable L
haL concessionaires be of ethnic or naLionalily
 
background corresponding to the "Old Ways" program in which they are
 
participating.  To the extent possible, sale of craft and other appro-
priate i
tems will be consolidated in the hands of as few concessionaires
 
as possible, for the sake of administrative efficiency.
 Concessionaires
 
may be ethnic-owned businesses, commercial firms specializing in cultural
 
products, or ethnic organizations.
 
A concessionaire must be able to obtain sufficient quantities of
 
approved i
tems, must have enough capital or credit to obtain i
tems in
 
time for the Festival sales period and must be able to finance the trans-
port of sales personnel and inventory to the Festival.
 
Any organization or individual interested in selling crafts during
 
one or more weeks of the Festival under the arrangements outlined above
 
may contact Mrs. Shirley Cherkasky, Program C
oordinator,  Old Ways in the
 
New World", Division of Performing Arts, Suite 2100, Amtrak Building,
 
L
'Enfant Plaza, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D
.C. 20560. Tele-
phone: 202-381-6528.
 
Once the content of an ethnic program has been decided by Smithsonian
 
staff, they will advise persons interested in operating a concession as to
 
which i
tems in their inventory are sufficiently related to the live pro-
gram and will suggest i
tems.
 Other factors also will be considered, such
 
as potential demand, unit price, quality and craftsmanship.
 
A final list of i
tems to be sold will be included in contracts with
 
concessionaires, and concessionaires will be permitted to sell only the
 
items  agreed upon.

LAW AND ORDER ON THE PLAYGROUND
 
(
This article has been exerpted from a l
onger version appearing in
 
Games in Education and Development, Loyda f
-
I
. Shears and Eli M
. Bower,
 
Charles C
. Thomas, Springfield, I
llinois, 1974.
 
eds.,
 
As Fred Ferretti demonstrates in the previous article, traditional
 
childrens' pastimes rarely disappear completely; they s
iri,ply change,
 
adaptin
 o to any number of varying circumstances.  In summertime
 
sout ern California, where the afternoons are far too hot for vigorous
 
running and all,who can,seek the solace of the swimming pool or the
 
beach, "Hide and Go Seek" i
s rarely played.  Instead there i
s a "new"
 
game, "Marco Polo",in which swimmers try to outwit and outrace a
 
goal tender guarding a "base" at one end of the pool.
 
I
s this a new game or simply yet another variation on an age-old theme?
 
Folklorists dealing with traditional childrens l
ore continually confront
 
just this kind of problem, because the twin dimensions of s
tability
 
and variatioDr,are here stretched to their utmost 3 On the one hand,
 
the historical continuity of childlore is one of the most remarkable
 
aspects of the human condition.  Revolutions, wars, vast migrations of
 
peoples often seem to have had l
ittle or no effect upon the private
 
worlds of the children involved.  Some of the counting-out rhymes still
 
chanted on twentieth century playgrounds can be txxd traced to Celtic
 
languages spoken by Britons in pre-Roman times.  Spanish-speaking
 
children in the new world still play the singing games that their old-
world cousins play, though an ocean and a two-hundred year time span
 
l
ie between.  Marbles, kites, cats cradle and hopscotch go back before
 
recorded history, and, as a child in Texas, I used to thump on my brother's
 
back in a guessing game mentioned by Petronius.
 
On the other hand, variation is apparently as e
ssential as s
tability.
 
One of the perplexing difficulties in dealing with childrens' l
ore is
 
that )
r out of a hundred renditions of the "
same" counting out rhyme,
 
for example, almost no two will be exactly identical.  The continual
 
co-existence of stability and variation in childlore is indeed so striking
 
one begins to wonder whether they are not perhaps complementary, Hkzxkex
 
rather than antithetical.  Maybe, in other words, you need to have both.

In investigating this notionX one summer, I decided to concentrate on
 
watching the actual play of children engaged in those play activities
 
sometimes called "games of individual skill" such as jacks, ball bouncing
 
and hopscotch.  Such games have at l
east two points in common: they
 
circulate primarily among the seven to twIlve year old age group and they
 
are generally learned informally, by simply watching and l
istening to
 
other children at play.

Thus, in the l
ife-style of American children, there appears to be a
 
kind of fundamental need�or requirement for a bifurcated game structure:
 
one axis consisting of the unchangeable rules and the other those aspects,
 
of the game 1k which are subject to variation. Some s
tability i
s e
ssential'
 
so that you can know which game you are playing; on the other hand, there
 
are all those free-floating rules on which you must reach a temporary
 
agreement in order for play to begin.

ight
 
be extremely i
nterested t
o h
ear t
hem.  Could you and h
e possibly get
 
together and d
iscuss t
his?
 
As you can see, we are attempting t
o make some k
ind of coherency
 
out of t
he p
icture by concentrating on S
pain, Mexico and P
uerto R
ico;
 
however,  I have no objections to decorating t
he sketch we are making
 
with additional decorations p

Anyway, a

Dear Jerome:
 
D
id you ever send your v
ita i
n?
 I
 wish you would.
 We are
 
still waiting on the Canadian government to get the d
iplomatic work
 
over with so t
hat we can begin actual  p
lanning and f
ield operations.
 
Ralph R
inzler, however, was most taken with your l
etter and wondered
 
i
f you had any f
ield t
apes from Nova Scotia that we could l
isten to?
 
I
f you have t
ime to make us up a sample of some of the f
iddlers and
 
s
ingers you've recorded and would r
ecommend, we would of course
 
return i
t to you as soon as we've heard i
t.
 P
lease don't send original
 
tapes; we've had too many tragic occasions when things were lost i
n
 
the mails.

incerely,

not to mention a comparable s
ympathetic r
eaction from
 
other P

position r
egarding t
his matter which we would l
ike t
o express.
 
The r
ationale which you h
ave i
mplicitly suggested a
s t
he basis
 
for t
he possible e
limination of t
hese p
rograms -
- v

hey were not

- would be r

t
he i

nvolved t
he e
limination of F
amily Folklore/Children's or
 
one of t
hose programs mentioned i
n t
he original p
lans.  Such i
s not and
 
never has been t
he i
ssue.  The weight of t
he r
ationale i
s f
urther r
educed
 
by t
he absence of a
ny suggestion to e
liminate African D
iaspora, which,
 
l
ike Family and C
hildren's, was not i
ncluded i
n t
he original p
lans.
 
Your r
ationale i
s actually one f
or not e
liminating any of t
he
 
programs originally proposed, and we a
gree w
ith i
t.  But i
t i
s not a
 
justification for t
he e
limination of F
amily Folklore a
nd Children's.
 
Let us t
herefore not decide whether F
amily Folklore and/or C
hildren's
 
s
hould be e
liminated on t
he basis of your r
ationale but, r
ather, s
trictly
 
on t
he merits, s
pecifically t
he r
easons for and a
gainst such a proposal.
 
We can see none f
or and several against.  The l
atter are a
s follows:
 
1
.  The i
ndubitable conceptual a
nd popular success of both programs,
 
as amply attested t
o by continuing extensive popular r
esponse w
ith
 
commensurate media coverage  a
nd consistent academic commendation.
 
This, coupled w
ith t
he extremely l
ow costs of both programs, means
 
t
hey produce more value per dollar t
han any other program(s)  i
n t
he
 
F
estival.

.  We have made commitments to t
hree s

nd t
hree
 
contractors i
n t
hese programs which we believe would be u
nethical
 
t
o break (
e.g. people have moved, r
efused other jobs, u
ndertaken
 
r
esponsibilities, committed t
heir t
ime, e
tc. at our i
nitiative
 
and i
nstigation).  We -
- and t
hey -
- would r
egard a

of t

do not see how we could l

s a variety of other
 
agreements and expectations generated particularly by F
amily
 
Folklore which has p
enetrated t
he Washington, D

extensively and i
nvolved over a t
housand f
amilies i
n i
ts projects.
 
The cancellation of t
hese commitments would produce an amount of
 
public d
isappointment a
nd complaint we don't need.
 I
n addition,
 
C
hildren's Area has made contacts and arrangments w

mpressive
 
number of schools, c

l

at t
his s
tage of i

nexcusable
 
waste.
 
Our conclusion i
s t
hat t
he r
elatively small amount of money t

limination of t

The above strategies s

He next suggests t
hat B
arbara Smith, c
hairman of t
he Department of
 
Ethnomusicology at t

 (
She was one of t

i
n t

K

of t

s a good f
riend of Dr. Smith's and
 
would undoubtedly b
e drawn i
nto t
he arrangements; Smith, however, i
s more
 
attuned to performance t
han Keppler.
 
He suggests t
hat 2 contracts be drawn up; one for D
r. Smith t
o organize
 
t
he preliminary f
ield work and (
at Bess'  i
nvitation) another f
or h
imself

r. Smith has grown h
ard of hearing and would
 
probably not w

arrangement.

Thus, for an additional sum of what i
t would cost t
o get 3
2 people f
rom

os Angeles and back (
approximately $250.00 each, t
otalling
 
$8,000) p
lus t
he cost of bringing a
pproximately 7 a

f

'd l
ike to r

P
lease extend my apologies to Mr. Toalepai and my t
hanks for
 
h
is hospitable i
nvitation.  Perhaps on another occasion we w
ill have
 
a chance to meet.

Dear Mr. Rinzler:
 
Before leaving for Nairobi Kenya, Chief Fuimaono called his very
 
good friend Meki Toalepai in Baltimore, Maryland, and discussed with
 
him -the fruitful discussions which he had with your staff in Washington.
 
Mr. Toalepai is having a Samoan " Fia Fia" on Sunday November 30, and he
 
and Chief Fuimaono would like very much to have you, Mrs. Bess Hawes,
 
Miss. Rayna Green and Mr. Charlie Camp come as his guests.
 The location
 
is in a building near Fort McHenry in downtown Baltimore and if you can
 
come we will be very happy to receive you and your guests.
 Please ask
 
for Mr. Meki Toalepai who is expecting you, and he will give you a nice table
 
where you can enjoy the performers.  Chief Fuimaono hopes that this
 
occasion will give you an idea of the pleasant and unique character of
 
life among the Samoans.
 Samoan food will also be served.  Please present
 
this letter upon entering and the Samoans will take very good care of you.
 
The address and time is as follows:
 
Sunday 1:00 p.m. to 6
:00 p

Knights of Columbus Hall
 
1338 Hull Street

We look forward to seeing you there.

Dear Connie:
 
The attached memo was drawn up i
n r
esponse to a meeting where we
 
determined t
hat t
here were a number of countries whose participation
 
i
n the 1
976 Festival s
imply had to be secured, whether or not t
hey
 
were f
inancially able to send t
heir delegates.  This l
ist i
s i
ncluded
 
i
n the memo and r
eferred to as t
he "
top s
ixteen".
 
A review of t
he bases for our s
election t
urned me to t
he l
arger
 
question of our r
esponsibility to ethnic groups,and t
he suggestion
 
t
hat we a
sk for your r
esponse on t
his i
ssue.  Whether we'll call a
 
meeting I
'm not sure; Ralph's trip to t
he far east next week has
 
deferred such p
lans.  However, i
n t

or observations, I
'll be tailing you some t
