Interview with John D. Peck, Great Bend, NY 
Interviewer: Jill Breit 
Date: February 15, 2013 
 
Great Bend is a small community in north Jefferson County, situated adjacent to Fort Drum military 
base, home to the 10th Mountain Division.  When John’s ancestors first farmed their land, the military 
base didn’t exist.  Eight generations later, the military is the largest employer in the county – and one of 
the largest employers in the entire northern half of the state -- and thousands of acres of former farm 
land have been developed in the past 20 years for expansion of base operations, and construction of 
housing units for military families.  Even so, dairy farms still operate in Jefferson County, especially in the 
rich soils of the southern portion of the county.   I learned about the Peck farm from Brian Peck, John 
D.’s brother and only sibling, who works for Assemblyman Ken Blankenbush.   
 
County Route 47, where the Peck farm is located, retains its rural character.  The land is flat and 
windswept.    The view is open to vistas of hedgerows and distant farmhouses.  John and his wife Maria, 
and their children Levi and Silas, live in one of two stone houses on the farm (total of 5 houses on the 
farm.)  The Peck family, which John has traced back to colonial Connecticut, acquired their land in New 
York as payment for service in the Revolutionary War. (I have not confirmed this family story in the 
official records.  Such land grants were not uncommon in Northern New York State.)  
 
I initially stopped at the stone house that the Pecks refer to as the “old folks house.”  John D.’s parents 
and his grandmother live there.  When I stepped into this house, they all chimed in that I had found the 
old Pecks, but that I needed to go to the next stone house to find the young ones.  (John is 29, Maria 
30.)   The young Pecks had a fire going in the stone fireplace in the back room of their house, but there 
was not a good place to record an interview in that room, so we set up in the dining room.   
 
In this first interview, we primarily cover the history of the farm, the calendar of activities on the farm, 
and the economics of the farm.  John D.’s entire work force is drawn from the local population.  He milks 
40 head, and grows all his own feed except corn. 
 
In this family, the first son of each generation is typically named John.  Levi’s legal name is John L. Peck.  
This family is also very interested in politics and has served in elected offices over the generations.  John 
D. got himself elected to the Town of Champion Board when he was 18.  He served there for 10 years, 
then got elected to the county board of legislators.  He hopes to win a second term in 2013.  John D.’s 
son Silas is named after Silas Wright, a North Country native who served in the U.S. Congress in the 
1840s, declined to run as Van Buren’s VP candidate, and instead served as Governor of New York until 
his death in 1846.  The Pecks also choose Biblical names, and like the sound of Silas. 
 
The Peck farmhouse displays the evidence of earlier generations.  Family bibles, paintings, antique 
baskets, and a small library of 19th century books.  John walked me around the house, pointing out how 
use of space has changed over the generations.  The original pantry is now a playroom.  The connected 
woodshed is now a kitchen.  A former cheese-making room is now an office space.  John D. showed me 
an 1880s photograph of Pecks posed in Sunday best in front of the farmhouse.  In the photo, there is a 
white picket fence around the yard that reputedly was hit by a meteor and burned down in the early 
1900s.  A local newspaper wrote a story about it.  Just hours before this interview, a meteor rained 
down in the Ural Mountains causing considerable damage, boosting the plausibility of the story.

Terms: 
Dry hay:  In contrast to balage or silage.  Refers to hay that is cut in fields, completely dried in the field, 
and then baled for winter storage in a barn. Storing hay that is not completely dry in a barn may lead to 
spontaneous combustion.  Silage is produced by chopping the hay in the field, then storing it green in a 
silo or bunker, where it ferments.  Bailage is a hybrid of the two previous processes: the hay is partially 
dried in the field, rolled into large round bales , and then wrapped in plastic for outside storage.  Some  
fermentation takes place in this third process. 
 
Johnes Disease: a bacterial disease that is easily spread from animal to animal. 
 
Fence rows: Piles of rock from the farm that have been laid around fields, where they serve as fencing to 
keep cows in pastures.  John distinguishes between this and hedge rows, where more trees have grown 
up in the stone piles and the fields are no longer used for active pasture.  The rocks on this farm are 
primarily limestone.
