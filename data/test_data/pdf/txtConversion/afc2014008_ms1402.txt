He went a courting v

The very first thing when he ait
 
It was, "Say, young man e did ynu

"No v kind miss ," was his reply,
 
"Long ago I laid it by,
 
It wasn't worth while to str '

When I was single, went dressed a

Now I am married, Lord, go ragged all the time
 
Oh Lord, I wish I
 was a single girl again.
 
Dishes to wash and the spring to go to,
 
When you are married, Lord, you got all that to do. Oh Lord, etc.

hen I was single, my shoes they did squeak,
 
Now I am married, got no shoes on my feet.
 
ky husband's he's a drunkard, oh mama, I druther be dead.

Than to hear my darling children crying for a piece of bread.
 
Two little children, laying in the bed
 
Both of them so hungry, Lord, they can't raise up their head,

Go tell Aunt Nancy, her old grey goose is dead.
 
The one she's been saving and saving and saving,
 
The one she's been saving to make her a feather bed.
 
Down come a walnut, down come a walnut,
 
Down come a walnut and popped her on the head.
 
We took her t

Took her to the kitchen and cooked her all night long,
 
they wasn't stout enough.
 
But she broke all the forks' teeth (

Broke out granddad's teeth,
 
We took her to the sawmill (

Grind her into mincemeat and make her into sausage,
 
Grind her into mincemeat if the miller only will.
 
But she broke up the sawmill, tore up a circle saw,
 
STore down the sawmill, that old grey goose was tough.
 
Go tell Aunt Nancy, (
3 times) we buried her in the sand.
 
Along came a grey wolf, along came a black dog,
 
Along came a coyote and scratched her from the ground.
 
She broke all the wolf's teeth, etc.
 
Go tell Aunt Nancy -
 we know it's quite a shock.
 
Go tell Aunt Nancy -
 we buried her under a rock.

Old Stewball he was a fast horse and I knowed him in the days of old
 
And his bridle was made of silver and his collar was made of gold,
 
Twas a great day in Dallas, don't you wish you was there
 
You could bat your last dollar on that iron grey mare
 
Well the horses they was saddled and the word was g&vcn gn run
 
.
tnd old Stewball he was atx
'smbling like a criminal to be hung,
,
 
Wall a the kettledrum was ebanging and the word was given go
 
And old Stewb ll he shot out like an arrow from a bow.
 
Well the old folks they hollered and the young folks did bawl
 
And the children said 0 Looky look at thatx

Well old Stewball was a white horse, old Molly was a brown
 
And old Stewball beat old Molly on the very first go-round.

Wee Ann took her yoyo, to school she did go though
 
A
 
She shouldn't have taken it at all
 
E7
 
It fell from her hand and it rolled on the ground
 
A
 
And it went through a hole in the wall.
 
The daring young Annie, she went to the jannie (janitor)
 
A decent wee man as a rule
 
It's pleasing to tell that he rang on his bell
 
And he asked overy kid in the shool.
 
The kids left their pencils and paper and stencils
 
To knock on the doors all around
 
And as they were rapping and ringing and clapping
 
They asked all the folk of the town.
 
The policemen soon learned and they were concerned
 
They left other cases aside
 
The whole of the force was alerted of course
 
And they went on the 2xd T.V. and cried,
 
All over the country the common and gentry
 
Were watching their wee T.V. screen
 
Things really got goin' son, when President Johnson
 
Received an appeal from the Queen.
 
The wires were a
.-tremblin' when he phoned the Kremlin
 
To ask about a Annie's yoyo
 
But Bre t
hny agreed with the greatest of speed
 
They should raise it before the U.N.O.
 
In Peking and Paris and all round the Barris
 
They were searching in vain high and low
 
When suddenly Annie announced that her Grannie
 
Had bought her another yoyo.
 (And it was a red yoyo, red yoyo, red yoyo etcc)
 
STOP THE WORLD. I
'VE LOST MY YOYO Matt McGinn, author &

Chorus:
 Did you find a red yoyo, red yoyo, red yoyo
 
A
 
Did you find a red yoyo with a wee yellow string?

That the streets up there are paved with gold when the love come tumbling down
 
When I get to Heaven, going to take my stand
 
Going to rassle with my Lord like a natural
. man.
 
Going to argue with the Father, going to chatter with the Son
 
Going to talk about the big world I come from.
 
When I get to Heave, going to sing and shout
 
Ain't nobody there going to put me out.

Ruth Crawford Seeger
 
Anc we hunted and wo hunt d and we hunted and we found
 
A pig in the lane and him we left behind, loo-ye-there.
 
Some said it was a pig, but others said nay,
 
Some said it was an elephant with his snout shot away, look-ye-there.
 
A frog in the well
 a canary with the feathers washed away
 
A man in the road -
- a monkey with his tail cut away
 
The moon in the elements -
-
 a cheese with half of it out away
 
An old poreu,jne -
 a pincushion with the pins stuck in the wrong way
 
An owl in an ivy bush
 the Devil and we all ran away.

a for Pronunc at1 on
 
y ou  w  ii note that w th very few except ons, all letters
 
of the alphabet are pronounced in on]y one way, as set
 
forth below.
 
is most important is that all letters be pronounced,
 
except where noted differently.
 
Some examplos of this rule, and  how r
ig the contrast to

 t
.h regard to the last example,
 n bngl sh E
l  is pronounced
 
variously, as in -  eiderdown -  e1 g it  -  either -,  whereas  in
 
Spanish, although more frequently than not used as a diphthong,
 
E
l  is always pronounced  -ee.  Note that pronunciation of A

As regards accen:uat on: 
the general rule  s to place emphas a
 
c
D 
on the penult m to syllable of all words ending on a vowel  or
 
l
into or "a", except whore a written accent changes this.
 
'
)hen the l
ast syllable ends on a consonant, othern than n or
 
than the emphasis is on the 1 at syllable, except where a
 
written accent changes th s.

Andy's
 Gone with Cattle
 
Our Andr's g
one with c
attle now-
Our
 
hearts are out of order—
 
With drought hets gone to battle
 
Across the Queensland border.
 
He's l
eft us in dejection now;
 
Our thoughts with him are roving;
 
I
t's dull on this selection now;
 
Since Andy went a-droving.
 
now
 
Who now shall wear the cheerful face
 
In times when things are slackest?
 
And who shall whistle round t
he place
 
When Fortune f
rowns h
er blackest?
 
OH, who shall cheek the squatter
 
When he comes round us snarling?
 
His tongue i
s #vowing hotter now
 
Since Andy crossed the Darling.
 
now
 
OH, may the showers in t
orrents fall,
 
And all the tanks run over;
 
And may the grass grow green and tall
 
In pathways of t
he drover;
 
And may g
ood angles s
end the rain
 
On desert stretchesi sandy;
 
And when the summer comes again
 
God grant t
twill bring us Andy.

You'll forget the ram-stag mutton on the banks of t

One night when travelling sheep, my c

T here was not a star to luminalte the sky,
 
I was dreaming I suppoaej,
 for ny eyes were partly closed,
 
When a very s
trange procession passed me by.
 
First there came a k
en garco with a swag of blankets blue,
 
A dingo r
an beside him as his mate;
 
They were travelling mighty fast, but they  hzited as they
 
"We'll have to jog along, i
ts getting 1ate4
 
The pelican and the crane, they c
ame in from off the plain
 
To amuse the comoany with a Highland Fling;
 
The dear old bandicoot played the tune upon his flute.-
And the native bea r
s sat r
ound them in a r
ing.
 
The drongo and the crow wmg us s
ongs of long ago,
 
The frill-necked lizard listened with & smile,
 
And the a
niu s
tanding near with his c
law up to his ear
 
Said:  'Funniest thing I
've heard for wuite S Whilel '
 
The frogs from out the swamp where the :
itmosphere is damp
 
Cane bounding in and sat upon the s
tones.
 
They each unrolled their swags, an d produced

One Sunday morning as I

I am a native of Erin's I

and from the maiden whom I adore.

Oh, my name i
s Bob the swagman,
 
And I
've had many ups and downs
 
I once was well-to-do boys, but
 
And I
'm forced to go on rations
 
The Old Bark Hut
 
before you all I stand,
 
while travelling through the land,
 
not I am stumped up,
 
in an old bark hut.

Ten pounds of flour, t

That's all they give to a hungry man, until the seventh Day,
 
If you don't be might sparing, you' l
l go with a hungry gut-
For that's one of the g
reat misfortunes in an old bark hut.
 
T
he bucket you wash your feet in has to carry water, too,
 
And they'll say you1r

And of furniture there's n

Except the s
tool I sit upon-and that's an old gin case.
 
I
t does us for a safe a

Or the flies would make i
t canter round the old bark hut.  (
Chorus)
 
In summer time, when the weather's warm, this hut is nice and cool,
 
And you'll find the g
entle breezes blowing in through every hole.
 
You can leave the old door open or you can leave it shut,
 
There's no fear of s
uffocation in the old bark hut.  (
Chorus)
 
In winter time- preserve us alit to live in therets a treat,
 
Especially when i
t's raining hard, and blowing wind and sleet.
 
The rain c

s black with soot
 
That's a substitute for pepper in an old bark hut.  (
Chours)
 
S
o beside the fire I
 make my bed, and there I lay me down,
 
And think myself as happy a
s the king that wears a crown.
 
But as you'd be dozing off to sleep a flea will wake you up,
 
1hcih makes you c
urse the vermin in the old bark hut.  (
